&gt; Unmoderated communities are never successful 
---

---
The community moderates itself.
---
&gt; the sub reddit would be a complete shit show. 
---
Nope.
---
&gt;The fact is that on a large scale, people love low-effort, low-engagement posts and will upvote them more than high effort posts that require discussion and engagement.
---
Cool story.  This subreddit belongs to the community, not to the mods.
---
---
---
It’s because 39% of the posts on this sub are talking about the same thing, rather than just commenting on an existing post. If that keeps going up I hope we hit a 50% removal rate.
---
This has been confirmed by our boy Ion.
---
Gul'dan's orcs did, not "the horde"'s
---
&gt; People are creating a ton of threads about the same exact thing when other threads already exist.
---
so make it a megathread?! but no, let's hide it because *some* users are *annoyed*.
---
I don't love it but I also want healthy realm populations after the initial boom so I am willing to tolerate it. I don't like some of the things layering is allowing people to do and I hope Blizzard can reign most of it in before launch.
---
Why would they? It worked that way in vanilla, there's no reason to change it.
---
That axe on a Paladin, is far stronger and scarier, it will proc off SoR, SoC and Judgement and unlike a warrior they dont need a baby sitter to carry them in order to perform well.
---
Nice bait
---
Feral tanks are quite good on the pirated servers.  In fact, it's optimal for a guild to use 1 feral tank.
---
lmao okay, was just an honest question but if you're gonna be snarky about it I'll drop it
---
Try sorting by new for a couple of hours, you'll soon realize they're almost being too lax with deleting threads. 
---
Every couple of days, there's a new topic that gets posted several times an hour for hours and sometimes days on end.
---
Back when Russia didn't have its own servers, there was an unspoken, quietly established fact that Warsong was exclusively Russian-speaking. I'd sometimes meet English-speaking people there stumbling around and trying to communicate, and everyone would ignore them or write some stupid shit to them that barely made any sense. I often found it sad, because they likely left WoW after this treatment.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But anyway, all this to tell you that French, German etc will probably just pick one server and stick to it, making it unofficially their language-based server.
---
The only problem is figuring it out on launch day, cause you don't want to land there.
---
There certainly "wasn't one before with a different time." Watch the TBC video I linked towards the end of the post. That is arena season 2 (before 2.4) and there is no 1 minute tracking on the enemy flag. There is only tracking on friendly flag which is in line with patch 1.6.
---
Yeah definitely keep an eye on them.
---
Naw I like my job and have decent hobbies. I could allow classic to take over 90% of my free time and devote everything to it, or I could skip it. Al my buddies that never played vanilla are super hype for it, but I did vanilla and I had my modern ‘classic experience’ on a great quality (relatively) pserver
---
Layering is sharding technology that they have not even gotten close to doing what they're claiming it can do.
---
IT's still bouncing people to different "layers" when they hit "shard" boundries - which is why people fall off the bird flying from A to B   or are just running along when everything phases to a different shard for no reason.
---
People have been proposing an alternative to "Layering" which is 100% exactly what Blizzard proposed layering to be -  without the entire process being virtualised  and thus full of bugs with a 2month deadline fast approaching.
---
Layering the non-blizzard way would be:
---
Blackrock Server 1
---
Blackrock Server 2
---
Blackrock Server 3
---
They could neaten the realm list up so it lists a single server then has the sub server.   It pre-allocates you to the one with the lowest load and tells you that you are selecting Server #  and this cannot be changed.
---
Bang you're locked to Blackrock  ~server~Layer 2
---
You cant jump layers at a whim,  you cant interact with people not in your layer,   it cant be abused to farm or avoid pvp.  IT does exactly what they wanted in regards to splitting up the population so the servers dont fall over.
---
Remember how layering is not a big deal?   Nether is this.   Come the time when they said they'd turn layering off -  merge the server databases so  Blackrock 1 2 &amp; 3 become just "Blackrock"
---
Think of all the gameplay bugs they could get fixed if they stopped trying to make sharding work on an entire wold server scale when it was designed for fragments of a single zone in the first place .
---
Nothing free about being a slave in chains horde scum.
---
Idk but I’ll be trying it out. 12 year old me loved getting into old IF, the IF airport, under SW
---
Have you _seen_ moonkin form? Kind of speaks for itself...
---
So thread nr. 687 about topic X that day is adding to some sort of discussion? Sort by new for a while, you'll see the same exact topic posted 10 times an hour. How is that worth shit to anyone?
---
You dont need shamans, they make consumes fot that, i.e. the elixir of poison resistance
---
You better not level then
---
Literally just go to the Wowpedia or Wowwiki pages for Trolls or Horde cities that have troll NPCs and look at the different names. I don't copy them but I look at the different patterns and come up with one of my own
---
why aren't you listening to the users that ask you to make this into a megathread? why are you listening just to the ones that tell you to hide this information?
---
do we want this fixed or hidden?!
---
The alternative is to just release classic as it is without fucking around with "sharding-lite". 
---
People were waiting for this for a very long time and are bothered that it's being fucked with. Maybe you should just not read it.
---
You can only really have 1 role at a time in classic no matter what class you play. Pick a class with the role you like the most.
---
I explained, the community does a terrible job of moderating itself. See 4chan, r/CA, the default subs (the only decent ones are extremely heavily moderated.
---
If you think an unmoderated sub would be better, then go make one and see how it turns out.
---
The whole Point of layering is a healthy Population a few months in. 
---
I See your solution to try to reduce everyone rushing on Server A, but it would still be a heavy overload for the First Server in its group.
---
This whole Problem will BE cool to watch when we See those Population Spikes on each of the inofficial nationality realms
---
Oh shit you must know more than the actual people testing these route during stress tests
---
Probably shaman yeah, but their melee dps isn't great in raids. They are damned painful in PvE though. 
---
Another choice might be the druid as you have all three roles covered, again though, feral dps isn't great and balance is very weak.
---
Who's advocating deleting every discussion? I am certainly not advocating that. isn't that a straw man? But a new one every few minutes, and that can happen in "peak" hours.
---
Now I see where the confusion seems to be coming from. New proposal threads are not as "new" as you think and we did have a private conversation about this. Plus, a post getting traction is not the only factor considered in allowing a post to stay. If that were the case, then every meme on the planet would hold the number one spot.
---
Is Smoking Heart of the Mountain an exploit? It’s BiS and is level 50.. your logic is flawed. Obviously blizzard didn’t intent to have these items become best in slot but that isn’t going to change. Also as others have mentioned no changes will happen, remove an item from the game that makes feral dps only slightly viable and you have an out cry for a replacement. Then everybody else want their class changed.
---
you can skip fireball but i would still take fireblast. just too good to pass
---
Have a guild?
---
Wut
---
My feral plan:
---
1: Skinning and enchanting from the beginning. 
---
2: make "smoking heart of the mountain".
---
3: enchant gloves 5+ skinning
---
4: loot knife from "the beast"
---
5-8: skin "prestine hide" = "breastplate of bloogthirst"
---
6: get leatherworking insted of enchanting.
---
7: elemental lw = make fire resistance gear = tank Ragnaros
---
8: create 420 "rugged armor kit" = 1200 darkmoon tickets = "darkmoon neck"
---
;)

Language specific RP servers are likely not going to happen at launch. They will want to see significant demand, otherwise they will be dead servers.

RP is already pretty niche anyway. And moderating them is a huge money sink for the company.

The real solutions to have a healthy pop? Is to split the subs. It almost completely eliminates the tourist problem. Layering isn't the solution to that problem.

Naxx isn't super hard, it just requires a lot of time and dedication. Spider wing and the first boss of the other wings are pretty easy. If you can get past Patch then Grob, Gluth and Thadd are pretty easy too. 
---
The hard part is that your raid probably still needs gear from AQ40 and BWL, even MC in some cases. So you have to plan a ton of raids or you won't progress very far into Naxx. That's the hard part imo. And once you are up against 4H, Loatheb, Sapph and KT, yeah those are pretty tough.
---
Well if a regular contributor to the ice poseidon sub thinks it's gonna fail, I guess we're doomed.

got it, thanks for the help
---
I explained this in a comment below. We have had layering megathreads in the past. However, since we only have 2 stickies and rotating threads it is quite hard to justify holding off a rotating thread for a megathread, especially one that has been done before. We are just like you in the sense that we find out WoW news in realtime. When this happens we have to scramble to get a megathread up and replace a rotating thread.

Lol wolfshead helm was always used to 60 by powershifting druids. It was used that for 12 months through 4 major patches in 2006. If they thought it was an exploit they had a funny way of fixing it.  
---
  
---
Vanilla had lots of 'interesting' mechanics. Ignite rolling, world buff stacking, wep skill being super strong etc. The point of Classic is to bring them back. You can whine about them being exploits if you want but Blizzard definitely won't be 'fixing' them lol.
---
LOL, I have a whole playlist of all these WoW Classics! Can't help but sing a long whenever I hear this one!
---
There is definitely room for both, the whole classic vs retail thing is just silly. If you enjoy retail good have at it and enjoy the game, same goes if classic is more up your street just enjoy the game that you prefer to play.
---
No way because I'll be there
---
For rogue, if you are any race you should be going sword or mace for leveling.  It is faster than dagger and fist weapons are few and far between.  Once you hit level 31 or so you can spec into swords then forget about maces, or you can choose not to and just take whatever your best damage option is.
---
Okay new time for new boxers
---
We learn from this that horde players don't sleep.
---
First of all leeway only gets activated when both players are moving so all the rooted clips are invalid and then also these 2nd swings are just delayed animations because you can clearly see at 13:10 that he hits him with a auto attack and a mortal strike at the same time.At 32:14 he jumps which causes the long range on the attack,that is also the reason why you can jump novas because the server doesnt update your position when you jump.The rest also looks fine to me since you always have to add 3 extra yard to tauren.The problem with leeway overall is that it probably existed and it was useful for the time back then since the average ms was like 120ms+,but nowadays where the average person has a ms of 50 and the server also being better at handling higher latency we dont need this technology/mechanic anymore. And I am saying this as an warrior main myself who would profit from this.
---
I understand that as I've told you. I know what a new thread is and what isn't.
---
I've searched for a thread that proposed the same idea (which is releasing 3 versions of every server name) and I couldn't find one - which is why I was shocked when you removed it.
---
I asked you to perhaps link me one as I could've missed it, and you still haven't.
---
Anger management is amazing, it generates rage  during combat.
---
Both were still used in TBC by feral druids. You're telling me Blizzard went 5 years without changing an item but suddenly they will on Classic? Get real.
---
I want to buy, and wish to sell.     /shrug
---
Check out the Warlock Classic Discord, one of the members has recently created a guide for drain-tanking. I'll PM you a link to the discord as I'm not 100% on the invite policies, though you can find it by googling anyway.
---
Sounds like minor inconveniences at best nothing there is game breaking in the slightest
---
With no RPPvP server, the best I can hope for is a PvP server with a lot of RPers.
---
its the best solution they got, i dont say its perfect.
---
tourists arent just retail players trying classic. its a big part, yes, but the problem definitely gets solved without it. servers still need some kind of anti-tourism-mechanic.
---
"I don't use social media." posted on Reddit
---
Does the pet AI issue (whatever it is, I dont know the specifics) affect warlocks too?
---
You dont need gold, traveling form is way better compared to a mount than people think ;). Get that "smoking heart of the mountain" asap
---
" I exercised today, burning 500 calories.  I earned this 1500 calorie McDonald's meal."
---
10+ years later and people still think WoW is gonna die. Funny shit.
---
That's just the server rules. Blizzard isn't close to 100% enforcing them, but if a guy is spamming twitch emotes in /1 day in day out, he will be dealt with
---
Will be playing a prot warr, my main mostly was warlock and dk throughout wow, so this'll be fun.
---
Me too. But I still felt SO great when I got that staff. I got it late in Vanilla, by subbing in for a healer in a raid that had MC on farm. Nobody else needed the eye of divinity, and I already had my eye of shadow... definitely a high point in vanilla for me.
---
You don't defcap warriors tanks either. It was necessary back when healers had a huge latency and couldn't react in time. Now it doesn't matter except on a few bosses where the tanks will be one-shot by a crit.
---
there was no map indicator, at all, in vanilla.
---
i specifically used to hide the flag for a very long time.
---
No doubt people are watching Cdew oneshot people and wanting to be him
---
This is a post from the Tumblr WoW-Confessions. You guys should check it out if you think this post is cool :)
---
Oh yeah? So with an 8 hour queue so you fucking morons can cry on Reddit about queue times?Or if they make more servers to handle the huge influx then a ton of dead servers after a month? It's impossible to just release "as is" when they are expecting probably 10-20k on a server, and there should only be 3k.
---
 Maybe you should use your fucking brain and think about the consequences like a sensible adult instead of bitching. They wouldn't introduce layering and deal with all of your whiny asses if they had an alternative that was going to work.
---
What are best PvE races for horde warlock? I'm interested in Orc but open to Troll if there is a noticeable difference.
---
Pretty much all of them.... 
---
Except Silithus, that zone can burn in hell
---
i didn't say its gonna die. I'm just saying its going to be a huge disappointment to a lot of vanilla players who expected something more refurbished
---
Hunter has one of the more complicated rotations of all the classes.
---
This might be one of the worst posts i have ever seen on this sub.....
---
You still have time to delete it.
---
That all falls directly at Onyxia's feet.
---
Keep the downvotes flowin' guys
---
You may be correct. I am going off historic information and math. Mathematically druids will always have crit and crush where warriors are able to get crit off real quick and crush eventually.
---
It's been proven that jumping into the instance portal gives a hidden 10% damage and healing buff
---
I don't think it IS the best solution they have. I think they have other reasons for doing it. Maybe it's easier on their end? 
---
If they were serious about getting a healthy pop they would start by splitting the subs. I don't think they want to do that. They think classic will be a good advertisement for their upcoming xpacs. I don't think it will be. The games are too different and cater to different players now.
---
I think you are a massive dissapointment tbh
---
Early Kalimdor was always so fun. It feels like I'm exploring deep into the wilderness with stone talon, ashenvale, The Barrens.
---
Honestly, all of Kalimdor is fun, but even I have to admit STV is the best zone haha.
---
I love the cleanliness of elvui. And I'm pretty ok in configuring it. So I'll definitely use it for classic as well.
---
Thanks for that insight. I hit 60 about 4 months before BC and my guild disbanded because it was actually one of the original world PvP guilds on Archimonde, formed by my high school friend during the original beta (It was called Entara Pax, my friend's mispelling of the Latin "In Terra Pax" or "Peace On Earth")
---
It split up because of BGs, then I joined the horde guild Knights of the Alliance (KoA) which had been around since Ultima Online I believe. I was pissed that after finally getting some decent gear it all became completely obsolete after like a day of questing in Outland, coincidentally I also met my wife around that time so gaming took a backseat for a while. I started playing again during WOTLK because my wife and I were in different cities for a bit and WoW allowed us to "hang out" every night. Shortly after Cata was released my account got hacked and blizzard's customer service demanded a photocopy of my ID three separate times claiming it was "too blurry" until I just quit. When I heard that MoP was in the works I felt literal sadness because I remembered when Pandarians were an April Fool's prank. I have a buddy that plays current and I can't make heads or tails of what WoW even is anymore. 
---
When my wife and I played people were already starting to have that kind of attitude you mentioned, probably due to the dungeon finder. I distinctly remember us rage quitting several groups because they'd blow up at her for accidentally forgetting to dismiss her void walker, or because the tank would lose aggro; everyone was just so whiny about every single wipe. I'm not a roleplayer, but I play RPGs because I'm trying to fulfill a fantasy, not show everyone how big my epeen is. I liked having a fire spec for my mage because I liked fire spells and burst damage and I wrecked in PvP, but even in lvl 30-40 dungeons I'd get guff for not being frost spec. I get not wanting a fire mage if you're running dungeons with fire-resistant mobs but min/maxing drives me insane.
---
I think players with our idea of how the community should act just need to organize a very etiquette-centered progression/social guild if everyone brings their modern attitudes into classic, which I know many will.
---
No, its Joan. And she's snarky.
---
Reddit is a glorified forum. Not social media.
---
Why are you guys engaging with this troll? In another thread he complained about gold exploits because he was rolling a healer and couldn't be arsed to farm for it. This guy is obviously a troll and you're all biting.
---
Not really, there’s only two quests there. The Ancient Egg and Saving Sharpbeak. Hardly worth a whole level of XP.
---
Go and find the language files. Easy googling and just choose a word from there. Doesn't have to be your own language of course. Could be a human raised by the highelves before the war and so he has a Thalassian name. Same with undeads and Common. Or a warlock who has gone so far into fel magic that he has adopted a name in Demonic. Or I believe the language is actually called Eredun. I named one of my warlocks Sumalesz, which is (sort of) one of the words Archimonde uses in his spell to destroy Dalaran.
---
You are a horrible person
---
Why would people expect something more refurbished? The whole point of classic is that it’s the same game from 10+ years ago.
---
Many bugs!  Handle it!
---
What are ''all these issues''? Every Beta tester who has made a video about the game has said how they love it. The biggest problems the game has right now are Layering and Streamers, i dont care about Streamers and they'll take away Layering in a while.
---
I dont see how Blizzard is doing a cash grab either, they're going out of their way to make the game as Vanilla as possible.
---
*montage*
---
Thank you. That is what I strive for
---
in what situation?
---
mage:
---
dungeons? cc'ing, counterspelling, maybe even kiting a bit when tanks dead etc.  
---
single target damage rotation? spamming 1 button.
---
For MW, being a mobile healer with HoTs and wears leather? Closest would probably be druid.
---
For WW being a quick attacker wearing leather, I guess rogue or feral cat? 
---
In retail I main a monk and will be rolling a druid for classic.
---
23 Skido^o^o^o
---
This was posted yesterday, good work.
---
No class will feel like a monk. Closest you can get is a rogue/warrior/shaman
---
I cant open the bug document. Is the bug document bugged?
---
&gt; Is Smoking Heart of the Mountain an exploit? It’s BiS and is level 50.. 
---
Armor isn't the same as weapons.
---
Stranglethorn Vale is one of the main reasons I’m going PvE server
---
Orc has no PVP benefit really, troll is the best pve option.
---
But on which layer?
---
Yeah you are right about that. I think it's technically possible for a feral to be defcapped but he will be so gimped it's not worth it. The druid will just have a massive HP pool and tons of armour/dodge that it isn't really a problem. The healers like it too (at least priests do) because they can use their more efficient but slower heals instead of their mana costly but fast heals because they don't have to snipe so much. Paladins with their ultra efficient 1,5s heals will usually top off a warrior where the priests can't. A feral however will take far more damage so you don't have to snipe.
---
Its much harder to feel full eating doritos though.
---
That’s not true. Worst class is not at all what hunters are.
---
Yes, they will be low on the totem pole for dps after 1+ year into vanilla. But unless you really care about the dps charts it’s just a dick measuring contest.
---
Why does it matter if a warrior does more dmg than you, they are a different class. You provide utility, you provide a 10% AP buff that benefits all physical classes, including the warrs.
---
And hunters will always be good at pvp, from the start of vanilla to the end. They will always have fantastic burst damage combined with excellent utility that makes them excellent at all forms of pvp.

RAID PVE only on the scale from 1 to 10 with mage being 1 and all hybrids 10. Even a 10 is very simple rotation/priority list
---
Mage - 1 
---
Warlock - 3
---
SPriest - 4
---
Rogue - 5
---
Hunter - 6
---
Warrior - 6
---
All hybrids to be competitive are a 10
---
Druid for sure.
---
Can you mention the reddit post without links? That said, I’m sure streamers and their audiences are jumping over themselves to talk about this now. You might not have to do anything more.
---
&gt;You don't defcap warriors tanks either. It was necessary back when healers had a huge latency and couldn't react in time. 
---
I mean the current meta is to just not even cancel heals though...
---
While reddit is definitely shifting towards social media, It's not quite there yet.
---
r/uselessredcircle
---
None of the druid forms can and the weapon speed and damage is also completely irrelevant.
---
**Shaman**
---
Love
---
* Variety in levelling specs
---
* Ghost wolf at 20 is amazing
---
* Lots of extremely useful totems, other people love them too
---
* Disintegrating people with chain lightning 
---
* Class fantasy is awesome
---
Don't love
---
* Having to respec mana tide for raids and ele/resto for pvp
---
* Not having totemic recall 
---
* When your totems aggro a random patrol 50 yards behind you
---
* Water totem quest
---
**Priest**
---
* Buffing random people
---
* Levelling feels really smooth
---
* Lots of different heals to use
---
* Smiting blasphemers 
---
* Stuck in healer spec for raids, so either respec or suffer through awful killspeed outside of raids
---
* No mobility
---
* Pressure to play dwarf if alliance
---
Two of my top picks as well, alongside mage and paladin. I can't decide either.
---
It is true, and moonkin are the chillest and rarest of them all. They know they look ridiculous, they know their spec is suboptimal in every respect, and they plum don't care. Moonkin are to be treasured.
---
I can’t wait for the elitist’s in the starting zones /yelling and brand new players to STOP KEYBOARD TURNING lol
---
Like I said, most memes. The one I was referring to in the other comment was an edit of a movie poster.
---
We're all gonna make it brahs
---
Is the answer "because we have beta access"?
---
My two mains were shaman and priest. I think I have to go warrior.
---
I agree, splitting the subs would help with the tourism problem.
---
i think the mainreason why they didnt do it is because they want people to be able to play both. Lately i suspect them to be afraid of the playerbase being too small with split subs. That would atleast explain why no language-specific realms are planned.
---
They want retail players saying "maybe ill check out classic b4 i quit retail for good", that way they can maybe keep that sub up much longer. same other way around. 1 sub for both games just eliminate the entry barrier when switching.
---
Is that Alliance? Correct me if I’m wrong but I remember at least 4 or so quests that chain to that temple for Horde side.
---
Address but not fix Lel.
---
what

silence horde poopyhead
---
And yet the Orcs still went to AShenvale to chop chop chop down all of the Night Elves trees
---
Don't forget Scourge-lite and their lich queen
---
Oh, yeah. Alliance. Alliance in general doesn’t have much to do in that zone.
---
Newsgroups.

thats reddit for ya.

Min range is not bugged, that’s how it was in vanilla.
---
I dont think I'd play classic beta even if I get invited to one for level 60. I've ne er played vanilla so I'm gonna wait to play the real deal and not spoil the fun for myself.
---
Not yet. We're all waiting for them though.

Still boring

Disappointed that the obvious choice, Tauren Rogue haven't been mentioned yet.

I downloaded it just to see and hear the login screen.

Maybe paladin? They can lay seals while they heal. Every hybrid raids as a healer though, with the exception of a feral off tank.
---
Hey there! I am sure this message comes too late but if you are still looking for a guild I'd love to discuss your plans for Classic. Feel free to hmu at wildgunmen#1302 at bnet or wildgunmen#9537 on discord. Whatever you choose, good luck in Classic!

My main for all my time in World of Warcraft, and my main in Vanilla, was a Druid Engi/Miner named Rillik (Zul'Jin). I was 7, and loved mining and engineering because I thought they were the coolest professions. Gadgets!! This post speaks to me.  
---
...in real life, though, I have a tendency to not really care what 'identity' I'm mixing and matching my ideas, values, habits, aesthetics etc. from as a devout Christian who loves pagan imagery, animism, real druidic lore, lucid dreaming, goth and the occult... so, uh, I might just be weird.  
---
Scratch that I know I'm weird.
---
I, no lie, check like 3 times a day just to see if for some reason someone turned on the wrong servers.
---
Hahaha, thats sad dude. I'm going to download it anyway too, just to be ready for Launch.
---
I once said i rather have blizz release an expansion/game earlier and fix it in the months afterwards than just straight up wait a lot longer. That made sense to me back then.  
---
Then came Battle for Azeroth.

BLIZZARD PLEASE TAKE YOUR DAMN TIME!!!

Yeah I don't know if Classic WoW is the game for you then

Ya that's probably true. It's just sad that it's at the cost of classic realms population health. They are probably more worried about retail still. 
---
I doubt classic will have some sort of renaissance like people are suggesting. Guess we will see (or won't see since they don't publish numbers)
---
Min range is supposed to be 8 yards, there is video evidence of that not being the case.
---
It's really easy to check since we know frost nova is 10 yard radius, currently you can stand at the edge of the deadzone of a hunter meaning you are supposed to be less than 8 yards from the hunter and not hit them with frost nova.
---
Thanks, I did a little searching and all the negative comments I got from here are from... hunters. It seems possible that people are really that petty to try to make their class more "rare" by keeping people away from it. It's pretty disappointing, but oh well.
---
why? because it took so long for the worldfirst? ragnaros was "open" from day1 in theory. people had to level up, farm gear, do the attunement and then farm MC a couple of weeks to actually summon him.
---
And what happened to #NOCHANGES ?? The beta has a flightpath vehicle arrow, retail raid frames, retail castbar location, wrong sounds, tons of bugs that weren't in vanilla..
---
Classic WoW is a shipwreck waiting to port
---
Hey there! If you are still searching for a guild I'd love to speak about your classic plans. We are looking to add a few solid players to our core group and I'd like to see if we are a fit for one another. Feel free to contact me on [battle.net](https://battle.net) @ wildgunmen#1302 or discord wildgunmen#9537  
---

By the time you are 60 in game you will be stronger than Saitama IRL.
---
Hey now, Protection Paladin is a meme spec too!
---
He wasn't unkillable. The game was new, people had to level up, guilds had to be created/raiding schedules established and executed to gear up players/mechanics learned, and they didn't have 15 years of knowledge about the game behind them.
---
Exactly. The only time I've spent on WoW betas was just to test out some classes/specs on training dummies.  Different strokes for different folks, but the thought of grinding levels on Classic (or even retail xpac questing) with no permanence, and then doing it all over again a few months later seems so unappealing.
---
That being said, I'm glad that enough people do enjoy doing it, so there is meaningful feedback and bug finding.
---
In the beta, players thought it was bugged or the level cap was going to go up because no one was getting past trash.
---
This question is bad
---
what do you mean by renaissance?
---
If the realm census addon gets a bit more popular we should have a rough estimate about servercount etc
---
It’s a cool data set.  But what should i take away from this?

---
I had a post about the stress test deleted recently because it supposedly violated rule 1, the rule which states content must relate to classic wow. I have no idea what a post about the *classic wow* stress test could relate to if not classic wow.
---
The more generous interpretation is laziness or poor reading comprehension, the less generous is that some of the mods are dicks.
---
I don't really care, given the change in quality of this sub it has mostly turned into something I only check occasionally for news, but it did seem pretty silly.
---
Hey there. If you are still looking for a home we should speak. I could give you the typical info dump but I'd prefer to actually chat. Hmu on bnet wildgunmen#1302 or discord wildgunmen#9537  
---
Good luck out there!
---
Woosh
---
Thank goodness, I’ve been waiting months for this post to get the info about your huge feeling.
---
Now I can finally sleep tonight.
---
Just RP as an undead without a tongue. Then you can ignore everyone and insist you're just staying in character. 
---
*taps forehead*
---
Going to play undead rogue when classic launches, because my human rogue I played in vanilla is dead and came back as forsaken
---
Spriest is a hybrid, no?
---
Wow reddit mods suck. What a surprise. Everyone knows this. Inb4 i get banned boys
---
You're right. I assumed Trolls could be warlocks. I never played Horde back in the day. I guess Orc versus UD in pvp is down to personal preference eh? Stun resist versus fear/charm break?
---
I see,  I just feel that PMI and the additional interest from a 30 year is a waste of money.  Save for another year or two and it will pay off in the long run.
---
Min range is supposed to be 8 yards + the combat reach of each of the players. Everyone has 1.5 meter combat reach, it’s pretty much the distance between the center of your character to the edge of your character model. 
---
So 1.5 combat reach + 1.5 for enemy player+ 8 = 11 yards, which is the correct min range.
---
For example, max melee distance is 5 yards +1.5+1.5 = 8 yards. There’s is still a 3 yard deadzone between ranged and melee attacks.
---
Another way to think about combat reach is think of the giant raid bosses like ragnaros. He is probably 15 yards wide, so 7.5 yards from the center to the outer edge of his model. If you calculated melee attack range with no combat reach from his center then melee players would have to be inside him to attack him. But his combat reach is 7.5 yards to the edge of his model, so you can be outside of his model and be able to atk him properly.
---
Orc. The stun resist is impossible to underestimate in pvp. The two strongest classes against lock are warriors and rogues. Resisting kidney shot or intercept is huge.
---
If they wanted the Sub money so bad, they could have sent invites to all players, priority to older accounts, and keep the Sub requirement.
---
But hey, streamers pull more people, although the streamer is the only one playing hah!
---
There sick! So you made these your self ? I need to learn how
---
&gt;  but bringing 1, 2 or 3 more exotic specs in a raid of 40 people just doesn't matter.
---
You will have a lot more than 1-3 exotic specs applying to your raid. There will be lots of rejected ret paladins and boomkins.
---
Classic WoW is the game for anybody who has a way to enjoy it. Almost like video games are designed to be played for fun or something.
---
I would agree with this...
---
Main a monk and have since MoP. Druid would probably be closest to the class in classic.
---
For WW I would say rogue is probably close than cat Druid, but they’re about the same either way.
---
&gt;I think it's technically possible for a feral to be defcapped
---
You could push crits off the table with 440 def, which I don't think is possible to get, and you can't get rid of crushes as a druid.
---
The mods have encouraged a subreddit culture of hating retail WoW and retail WoW players.  
---
In August we are going to have a huge problem, as thousands of retail players come to this subreddit to discuss Classic WoW.  Will they be welcomed by people with maturity and respect for people who play retail WoW, or will they be met with hate and ridicule for people who have different views on the game?
---
Dang, I thought misdirect was a really cool ability, I was hoping it was in classic. Thanks. I'm debating if I want to tank or go pure DPS, and trying to find the right one if I go damage.
---
Yooo i got perma banned on the retail sub because i called a person an alliance dog lmao
---
The opportunity cost of holding the amount of cash to put down 20 percent and then pay an accelerated mortgage off during historically low interest rates is a bigger waste of money.
---
Feelings don't have much to do with the math, I encourage you to look up some great articles on the subject that break it down better than I will be able to.
---
Lol they aren't selling the damn game. Cash out? Our 15$ a month is barely going to pay for all the man hours to make this work. You guys are seriously underestimating the cost to put this into action if you think this is just an "Easy cash grab".
---
I wish it was only 50

Used by whom though?  I never saw any powershifting druids, except maybe in pvp?    If it was so few people that blizz didn't even know about it, then it means nothing.
---
Thanks. Seems like a bit more utility than my old Rogue. Maybe worth looking into if I decide I want to go DPS.
---
Herb/ench, have a friend make the potions you need. Herb money pays for the expense of leveling enchanting. Also, druids make fantastic herbalists for several reasons.
---
You’ll never close the gap on a skilled hunter and they can always just pull their pet back preventing you from doing a damn thing
---
Both itemization and talents were terrible in patch 1.1.0.
---
Am in beta and have tested exp runs. The number of people on at launch will render all these routes to be useless. While youre trying to tag 10 boars I'll be grinding higher level mobs.
---
&gt;the "retail bad classic good" threads    
---
This is why this subreddit has a bad reputation and many people don't think it will be a good place to discuss Classic WoW.   There is to much hate towards players of retail WoW.    
---
It would be better if people can respect different views on the game and that all expansions of WoW have pros and cons.
---
Very cool man! Thanks.
---
Hunters were pretty screwy back in classic too.
---
You checked out the Spelladin build at all? It's not too terrible as far as meme specs go. Though I fully agree with AP Ret being horrible.
---
*But who will tame Humar the Pridelord at 23 if nobody is playing a Hunter??*
---
I'll roll on a Pvp server. Rp rulesets don't really get enforced, sadly. Hoping the community comes together and picks an unofficial Rp-pvp server.
---
For real. I got temp banned just for disagreeing with a mod's point of view. Literally just disagreeing. He got all pissy and banned me for it.
---
If they fix shit by the time PvP ranking is released I'm fine with it.
---
He was running around with actual bloodfang and daggers.  The transmog king ahead of his times.
---
I dunno if you can say it was literally impossible, but MC at launch was a painful bug fest so the 'race' wasn't really that exciting. Whoever got the kills just came down to who raided first after bug fixes went through.
---
Ironic that best buy is a *retail* business
---
Spriest isn't a meme tho,if your raid is lock heavy bringing 1 spriest is a buff to raid dps
---
Get fat while playing Classic WoW

If bugs like bow makes wrong sound...kind of...is game breaking for you then yes play something different. Most of the bugs are #nochanges bugs but are not game breaking.
---
Hey sorry, what is the Y axis in? Thousands? One’s? Tens? 
---
Was it 700 players? 7000? 700,000? I’m just trying to understand
---
Really?  Did they get nerfed in TBC?
---
Nice post. Littered with facts instead of brainless mouth diarrhea
---
Quality content.
---
Yes it is irrelevant. They're trying to recreate the vanilla experience. Having a shit tonne of people on one server isn't that.
---
It was fleshed out enough to be an actual DPS class and unlike other Hybrids you didn't need to do any shenanigans or rely on one key item to be able to DPS.
---
Just the other day we had a thread here of people [claiming the boundary of Ironforge and outside Ironforge were always sharded even in Vanilla.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3g04q/is_this_how_vanilla_worked_legit_question/) I thought I was taking crazy pills because everyone was so sure of themselves.
---
Why is he using a hunter weapon?
---
*Mankirk for real nostalgia
---
* Patch 1.5.0 (2005-06-07):
---
The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now always happen while Ragnaros is in combat. However, these lava eruptions occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.
---
The maximum range of the Wrath of Ragnaros spell has been increased. 
---
* Patch 1.4.0 (2005-05-05): Ragnaros now stays up 2 hours rather than 1 after being summoned.
---
So 1.4 made learning the fight a lot easier, since you could get a few more attempts. The change in 1.5 made the fight much easier.  The kills prior to 1.5, I believe, relied on lava eruption bugging out after a wipe and they just wouldn't happen at all.
---
O just got randomize since the character is deleted in to days.
---
Neither leeway and batching should exist. They are like wanting to cap people's fps at 20 to immitate vanilla.
---
Yeah I was also thinking of that. As long as private servers can find a location to run their servers, their product will be *even better* than it is now, and it's pretty damn good already.
---
That's it!?   I saw fucking enhance shaman doing that much dps...   I thought this was a viable dps spec?
---
I'll bet you a months sub on that "fraction" part. You're being extremely defeatist if you think 99% of players will drop off in the first month. 
---
Also I q2 2005 there were over 3.5 million active subs.
---
There is a mega thread every Monday just for finding a guild.
---
"Ah man, I could have been running through those dungeons getting that attunements right now"
---
Nothing will happen. That is the point. Never again will your gear be completely useless after a patch/DLC.
---
Examples?
---
How you gonna make post like these but also want blizzard to listen to your hunter feedback? This is why the community is ignored.
---
As a person who has played the stress test and blizzcon demo I will say this.  They've got it pretty well figured out.. sure some bugs here or there but none that I personally take issue with.  If you want a perfect game then let me know when you find it.  I'll be here.
---
The future really rides on how Classic performs. If it’s a huge cash cow Blizzard will most likely keep milking it with TBC and see how long they can cash in or rehashed content.
---
How do soul shards affect pvp? 
---
I feel like the question of how shards affect raiding is asked pretty often, but how does needing soul shards affect wpvp, bg's and dueling? 
---
Is it a neglible requirement or do you find yourself having to take extended breaks to go farm shards? 
---
Like if I'm dueling in front of org am I going to have to go fly to azshara to get shards every halfa? 
---
Bonus question: how does this compare to ammo?
---
Am Horde player, but Loch Modan was a huge loss.  Cant wait to see it and the dam again.
---
Honestly, that would be amazing, but it's not possible as Skorcha said, we can only have two stickies so we have to prioritise.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4dfbk/meta_what_is_going_on_with_the_moderation_of_this/erw03e5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Start reading there. Your question was answered.
---
&gt; I do not think the intention is a well polished game for beta and it never is. 
---
Blizzard almost never changes stuff after the Beta. I'm trying to be optimistic, but I doubt they'll fix even a quarter of these bugs. It wouldn't shock me if they fixed none of them.
---
Its a Beta for a reason, to find and explore Bugs to report.
---
With how dead the beta realms from my experience it is 700 for sure.
---
I doubt they will increase the level cap past 40 so not much point in playing it.  Might as well wait for release.
---
Didn't they say they might?
---
Frost Nova should also get benefit from one of the players hitboxes, making it effectively 11.5 yards which is still more than 11.
---
Blizzard needs to have some accountability and transparency here. I know that's not Blizzard's language, but there are glaring issues both with Hunters and the game itself. I'm a hunter player myself, and I'm considering re-rolling just because this is ridiculous. Scatter DR with trap? :(
---
Azshara is my favorite zone of vanilla too, though I dont remember it being my favorite for lvling or questing it was for the look and feel.
---
Aye, this is what made Mind Vision so critical
---
Oh boo hoo, cry me a fucking river mate
---
Low priority
---
Based on polls I've seen, hunters seen to be pretty unpopular already. Given this, I wouldn't be surprised if hunters become extremely rare at higher levels.
---
Or lots of people are reporting memes the moment they pop up. It turns out low effort junk is disliked. Who knew.
---
That doesn't make sense because you only needed 1 or 2 shamans in a raid.
---
So the potential 1.5 mill active BFA subs are going to make up the majority? You're not actually serious I hope?
---
Well, I read it before downvoting. Your welcome.
---
I'll stick with my dagger/shield agi/spirit build.
---
Do we know if phase 1 is going to include armorless level 60 mounts? And if so, does that mean it will be cheap riding skill + expensive mount, and only changed to expensive riding skill + cheap mount in a later phase?
---
And even if we don't know that...if it *is* the case, does that mean someone could save money by buying riding in phase 1 but waiting until phase 2 to buy the actual mount?
---
People weren't really using it in vanilla as far as i know, because feral tank/dps wasn't a thing in vanilla.  IIRC Druids got a major update somewhere around AQ40 that made those specs non shit.  That was the first time I remember hearing about a feral tank druid anyways.
---
On the low, low chance that Blizzard looks at this subreddit, here's the potential bug list:
---
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=0)
---
1 on 1 warriors are trash unless they have great gear.
---
For real!
---
Leeway is the bigger problem.
---
Thanks for at least giving me a chance :)
---
Mostly, but I would say orc is a no brainer because only two classes can fear you whereas many classes can stun, anyone can basically with eng grenades.  On top of that, your hardest counter (rogues) have several stuns, so the stun protection (in my opinion) goes a lot further than WOTF does.
---
In the beta, the enemy flag carrier is only shown on the map if they are visible to a member of your team. If not, it either doesn’t appear or it shows where it was last seen. I remember it working this way in vanilla.
---
Downvoted, did not read.
---
So silencing them is somehow a good solution? Especially in regards to layering, it's important that people keep talking about it, and it's important they people get a fair representation. If Blizzard doesn't want thousands of posts complaining about layering, maybe they should actually listen?
---
Second time someone has mentioned them. They a private server guild?
---
Because warrior is the only end game tank class and also is the best melee damage (and honestly best overall damage) class for a significant number of endgame encounters. 
---
You also needed up to 8 warriors in a raid for certain bosses so there was always plenty of slots to go around. Even mediocre players could earn a steady raid spot in a decent guild if they knew how to hit shield block every time it came up.
---
Thanks for the plug!  I really appreciate it.  Come by my channel anytime and hang out and ask questions.

---
Why no humans for PvP?
---
As is! Didn't you know software is magic behind a screen!
---
Rebirth. Ya we will get a rough estimate.
---
The vast majority of players in the beta are not streamers.  Sure maybe 50-100 people got in because they were streamers or prominent youtubers but most people are not. 
---
I'm in the beta and I have never streamed a game in my life.  I don't know what metrics they use for invites but I did play during actual classic quite a bit and have been mostly subscribed to WoW since.  I was likely just super lucky. 
---
The reason the population is so low is because there is 0 motivation to play.  They will likely not raise the level cap past 40 so once you hit 40 there is not much to do.  You can't even practice leveling since the servers are so deserted and won't be comparable to launch.
---
&gt; I don't see an alternative
---
Then it's even more important for these posts to keep showing up. People have been offering logical alternatives for over a year now. If you can't see any of them, then clearly there aren't enough.
---
Which has always been kinda weird to me, considering we have the Wildhammer clan literally right there, and a large encampment of high elves to the north. Figured there would be more Alliance story. Maybe it was cut content.
---
How are we supposed to know someone is a "retail player" unless they specifically say so?
---
Also rule #2 still exists
---
Let's not forget people didn't know what the hell they were doing. Going from 1-60 didn't take just 6 days as it does now, it took a LOT longer because people didn't have leveling routes ground down to most efficient paths we have now. So getting 40 people to 60 and have the gear, while not knowing *ANYTHING* about the fights took a lot longer.
---
I'm the type of altoholic that levels halfway and then switches, I'm doomed.
---
This is how the subreddit has always been. Some of the moderators have friends and/or relationships with streamers and/or people associated with Blizzard. Their internal discussions aren't "hey, how can we screw ppl over and help blizz?" but they are definitely influenced by Blizzard whether they realize it or not. It's troublesome because the moderators believe they're being objective, even though they're not.
---
I don't understand why people are surprised by this number. Blizzard only sent out a handful of invites to content creators and another handful of dedicated players. If these were the numbers from say the stress tests and/or a open beta to all then "surprising" would make sense. 
---
I watched Asmon and Esfand have their discussion about "Classic dying" and I found it strange that people can say "Omg Blizz didn't invite many people" and on the other be surprised by "look at how low the population numbers are!" 
---
Now if somebody had a concrete number of the total invites sent out compared to the average daily active users that might actually be useful information...
---
More like,
---
“I do not think the intention is a well polished game ... and it never was”
---
good thing there is still two months for them to debug.
---
You’re aware reddit search is bad and people can say the same thing and use different enough words that search completely breaks right?
---
Lol they chopped down some trees so the next logical step is genocide? 
---
Scourge Lite? Lich Queen?
---
lmao she is the #1 enemy of Arthas, would of fucking destroyed him 1v1 if he didn't get saved... She frees souls from the Lich King's grasp and gives them free will again, single handily formed the Forsaken with the sole intention of destroying the Scourge.
---
I won't be crying about queue times, even if they're huge. If other people cry about queue times I'll just ignore it. You should probably do the same and not let someone else's gripes bother you so much. 
---
Maybe they really don't have any good alternative. It's also possible they just thought we would bend over and take it(like you are) without complaint. I have thought about the consequences. It will take slightly longer for some people to do their level 5 starting quest. Boo hoo. There might be a queue. Boo hoo. Have more servers and merge them later if it's that bad. I'd rather have server merges than layering. If I trusted they would deactivate it after a few weeks it could possibly be acceptable. But they'll probably change their mind or come up with some excuse why it needs to be extended.
---
If layering were starting zones only I'd be maybe ok with it. But for some bizarre reason it won't be. In the end the launch is going to be a mess regardless, even with sharding woops I mean layering. Maybe that's why I'm not bothered by the idea of just going in raw.
---
Hahaha omg, this made me laugh
---
You have to admit a level 30 mace being BIS is kind of fucked up, isn't it?    
---
Think about weapon normalization.  They did that because slower weapons were vastly better than fast ones.  Shit had to be changed so that people could get upgrades.   Getting upgrades is a fundamental part of the game.   If a low level item is so good that you can't upgrade it, then it's busted, and breaks that aspect of the game.
---
I'll concur when he provides a link.

There is no actual source other than realmpop data and the Acti/Blizz investors call. Estimates range from 1.5 to 2.7 from what I can gather. Mind you this doesn't include China since their subscription model is different. 
---
Not only that but Blizzard games have been losing players in their games at a rate of one million people per month according to the last investors call. I'd have a hard time imagining these players are dropping D3, Hots or Sc2 since they're relatively "dead" if you want. I prefer to call them more niche in the market. 
---
Granted a large amount of those players could be from Overwatch and Hearth stone as well. Currently all Blizzard games seem to be in a downward trend. 
---
I'm fine with busy servers. I just don't want it to dilute the community and economy aspects of the game. Something Nostalrius and the bigger private serves had issues with.
---
&gt; People are creating a ton of threads about the same exact thing 
---
Because tons of people want to talk about the exact same thing
---
Do you see a "Layering Megathread" anywhere?
---
That doesn't change the fact that pummeler is supposed to work that way. It increases your attack speed by 50% and is usable in shapeshift form because it has no spell or cast associated with it, it's just a buff.
---
Closest to a monk is a rogue but no class even close to monks exists in classic.
---
Most people wouldn't read it. The point of repeatedly talking about layering is to make people aware of how bad it is, even if they don't want to listen.
---
This hurt my bones
---
&gt;Unmoderated communities are never successful
---
Actually, free speech is always breeds success
---
Europeans wouldn't understand

close, but trolls are actually the root of all problems

I love those posts, so maybe i wasn't clear. I'm STRONGLY against the just bitching and whining posts, with no alternative suggestion.
---
Don't forget to stretch!  You can stretch a lot of muscles form a seated position, or just using your chair.  Not stretching properly can lead to a lot of low back pain.
---
1) Won't be, this is vanilla suck it up.
---
2) It was the same BIS helmet all the way through wrath. Don't have to play it.
---
3) Feral tanks even on classic wow were a thing, if anything they were better than pirate realms.
---
4) Yes, it is.
---
If you aren't a warrior/mage/rogue you're a shit DPS. If you aren't a paladin/priest you're a shit healer.
---
So why bring the other classes? Because the raids are a *FUCKING JOKE* in comparison to now, until you get to AQ/Naxx 40 where things step up dramatically and a variety of classes help due to utility.
---
Delete this
---
...but we did this on the stress test. On the launch of the stress test. There were hundreds of people around me and it still worked, I literally have proof on my VOD.
---
Aww, the animation and the sound while navigating through Warcraft 3 TFT menu - i'll never forget it.
---
Fake. Wow players don't play during the day
---
You don't need to know.  There will be tens of thousands of retail players coming here in August. They will see comments insulting/hating/belittling them. They see it now in this subreddit.   Not everyone is like that, but there is still a lot of comments like that.    
---
Rule number 2 has never stopped people here insulting and mocking people playing retail WoW.   
---
Hopefully there is just more respect in this subreddit for people with different opinions on things.    
---
A lot of people play retail WoW, see the pros and cons of BFA and other expansions, and can't wait for the Classic servers to launch.
---
Lmao. Did you not play the hall dungeon in WC3? Jaina and Sylvyanas are no match for the lich king.
---
I'm the opposite lol, Trisfal, Silverpine, Hillsbrad... all such amazing zones with sad but interesting stories... 
---
The barrens is like 90% walking and 10% planting some seed for a tree-hugging cow who walks upright.

The moderation is a disaster in this sub. Over modding and arbitrary modding galore. Not that the content or discussion on the sub is really top notch but a year ago this was an enjoyable daily browse.
---
Dude we all know that you people don't need to say this every time we say something about the beta. We're reporting bugs we know what the point is. That doesn't mean we can't have fun during it.
---
Also complaining about it being dead is because there might not be enough testers left to do instances soon. If the counts keep going down there won't be anyone to test the lvl 50 or especially 60 instances.
---
Nobody yet has responded that Ragnaros wasn't actually available on release. The Majordomo encounter wasn't available either.
---
If you enter making a flip all the gear you want will drop.

If you are the only who made a flip, you will win all the rolls.

In the year 3028312, the combined might of the Astral Federation clashes with the remnants of the Ulox Union. In a stunning victory, the Ulox will finish off the AF and usher in a reign of terror unseen before in the universe. Years later, a small deployment of of Ulox scouts will happen upon an ancient artifact on a long lost world. Eventually, after years of study and development, the Ulox will unveil their masterpiece and ultimate downfall. Obsessed with their latest invention, the empire they've built will crumble to the ground. Celebrations for the fall of the Ulox break out across countless worlds, all unaware of the true danger they reintroduced to the world -- WoW Classic.
---
Haha right
---
Shamans could straight up tank till 40 in vanilla. Everything looks like that will hold in classic. They’ll start to look less good to folks as folks approach 60.
---
What the fuck? When did I say 99% of players will drop?
---
There is something wrong with the that private server. Unfortunately private servers were over estimating base damage. They also had quite a few bugged items. A lot of the DPS videos we see, they are abusing weightstones, damage enchants and cobalt crushers/ blackvenom blades etc. 
---
Kinda feels like the "poor get poorer" but it was a private server error :'(
---
Model editing gets you banned and that's client-side only as well
---
The issue with that is there's been no official response regarding it,  so people come here look see nothing recently then post. 
---
Theres moot point using the search function to find a thread several days old to reply to it.
---
Try and bring a thread back that's too old and you'll get le ban hammer too. 
---
if they dont want mass threads about layering... maybe address the issue with a megapost / sticky  instead of constantly sweeping it under the carpet maybe?   The bulge in the middle is getting pretty big from the amount of sweeping they're doing.
---
Ironically, I feel that you have an easier time voicing criticism on their official forums at this point, but only because nobody cares what's written there for the most part. If people are complaining on reddit then it hurts their image. That they do care about.
---
Yall act like vanilla was hard lol. Havent people on provate servers 10 manned mc? You can take 40 druids to a raid and easily clear it.
---
From Human Pala pov:  
---
UD  
---
\-- Rogue:  Either Grim/Neilyo minmaxer or 12 yo edgelord, don't disrespect either jic  
---
\-- Mage:  Hes either gonna be good enough to make me wet myself if there isnt LoS nearby -- or another 12yo choker  
---
\-- Warlock:  Fear use and pet choice often tells the quality of the player -- from mouthbreather to Drakedog  
---
\-- Priest:  Often a king of the server, Stier racials, priest classic privilege, and strong allies make this guy feel like a godfather, cross server  
---
Orc  
---
\-- Warrior: Male = coinflip king or 12yo, female = another likely godfather of the server (hoodrich reborn)  
---
\-- Hunter:  Fk your stun resistance, your cheetah world kiting, and your viper cc chains -- youre all good and lucky and fk you  
---
\-- Shaman:  Pala worst nightmare, male and female both insane threats, special pala-sham rivalry emotions for the iconic orc race choice too  
---
\-- Warlock:  Either 12yo edgelord with broken hands, or, if female, a probably pvp god player  
---
Tauren  
---
\-- Warr:  Big dummy or gigachad big d\*\*k Pat reborn, Males will have some that are TERRIBLE bots, Females will have some that are INSANELY good  
---
\-- Hunter:  Very likely bad, unless female, then coinflip  
---
\-- Druid:  Either pacifist mom gamer bowling pins, or super good balanced player 1v1 gods, or giga cheesers in dumb specs  
---
\-- Shaman:  Female coinflip gods, male bad versions of grauth usually  
---
Troll  
---
\-- Warr:  Rabblerauser irl or super minmaxer pve godfather  
---
\-- Hunt:  Fine?  Or horribly late in taking off cheetah, idk  
---
\-- Mage:  Supreme ruler mage of the server (pve and pvp), earnest pvp choker, or gimmicky PoM 12yo that forgets about spellbatching  
---
\-- Priest:  Either godfather of the server or a disappointment to everyone he comes across on the server  
---
\-- Shaman:  Secure versions of orc shamans -- care the elemental ones especially
---
Was thinking or hunter or priest so at least I’m fine there. We’ll see when it’s closer to release thanks :)
---
I said this jokingly, they didn't take it too well lol.
---
Wotf is the reason to roll undead, but cannibalize can be quite nice.  
---
Orc is clearly better though, as resisting a stun is an auto-win vrs most classes.
---
Orcs and humans. They have the coolest animations imo, and I play a Troll so I'm not just telling you my favorite race.
---
I feel like delay until they are ready.
---
Like the phases things will help this, because we don't have a confirmed timeline where we know "it will be X date for phase 2 and Y date for phase 3" they can delay by weeks or months before the next phase to make sure everything is worked out.
---
I am not arguing that it shouldnt work.   I am just worried about rolling a druid, and then blizzard decides to nerf it.
---
But I've been Horde, back when I was an edgy teenager who wanted to be the cool bad guys. I've seen that story all the way through mostly.
---
Hard to resist the call of something similar but new.
---
It's almost like... were like... at War with these people... or something. 
---
The World PvP in Retail for me this past week has been pretty fun as I am leveling a fresh Ret paladin, ive had maybe 4-5 organic WPvP fights and its surprisingly one of the few things that I am enjoying about BFA.
---
I play Vanilla Pserver and i spend 50% of my time in some pointless feud where a single gank has turned into a little 5v5 World PvP skirmish  and next thing I know the couple hours I had to level, are gone.
---
I'll take the second scenario over the first any day, nothing like going to War!
---
Hey man, I can definitely tank Naxx as a NE Warrior.
---
I am a new player currently sitting on my main character in the late 80s
---
AND I HAVE ACCESS TO THE BETA
---
So yeah, it’s random as hell, feelsbadman to all you longtime players, my account isn’t even 2 months old.
---
Good advice!
---
OH SWEET MERCIFUL CRAP MY ARMS HURT JUST READING THIS!
---
Yeah this thread is moronic..... pservers have survived with thousands of players for over a decade with a more broken client
---
&gt;lmao she is the #1 enemy of Arthas, would of fucking destroyed him 1v1 if he didn't get saved... She frees souls from the Lich King's grasp and gives them free will again, single handily formed the Forsaken with the sole intention of destroying the Scourge.
---
sincerely, Nate Blightcaller
---
They haven't fixed this yet? Slightly worrying.
---
It absolutely wasn't a thing in vanilla, I played an ass ton of WSG (exalted on two characters and then some), i KNOW enemy flag carriers were NEVER on the map, so having that evidence is really great.
---
The only way you knew if they were well hidden or exploiting was /target and mind vision.
---
Well it looks like 1,463 people on this sub disagree with you so it's a good thing that's not your choice to make, I guess.
---
Wouldent that mean there's enough interest / concern / discussion about the topic to warrant something more than....     more talking about it because there's nothing else being done tho it still raises enough concern for.... would you believe.... people to want to keep talking about it?      See how we're going around in circles and will continue to do so until something breaks the cycle.
---
In this case rather than pushing for the boys in blue to address the community's concerns...     the solution is to just censor the shit out of all threads mentioning it.
---
Is that Horde Mountain Dew in the cooler? 🤩
---
lol
---
I'm not dead sure about pummeler, but the wolfshead item was used well into TBC as there was no real alternatives added. TBC also added more items with the "+ x attack power in cat and bear form" where in vanilla I think there are only like 4-5 items like that. This is the druid version of weapon damage. 
---
Beyond TBC I don't know, didn't play wrath much.
---
Except it does change balance. Blizzards stance for these reworked games so far is not fixing exploits so I don't see them changing it.
---
Against same level NPCs, weapon skill is not important.  On the order of 0.4% damage increase for 5pts, but if you are for some reason attcking something 3+ levels that is when it gets really good.
---
Rogues have lots of good swords while leveling anyways.  Warrior on alliance will likely end up using a staff or axe early &lt;25, and an axe again around SM.  I wouldn't equip vastly inferior gear for the weapon skill.
---
Ya man it's just a giant charity and they aren't making any money. They already have tens of thousands of people subbed to try and get in the beta, paying for, but not even using the product. That's not a cash grab... It's a... Cash re-location... Into blizzard wallet.
---
Just a bit of warning... the game doesn't feel the same after switching from PvP to PvE.
---
I made a character on a Pserver, got ganked so much on my way to 30 i decided to try a Pve version of said Pserver..
---
i got to about level 34 before i realized how gutless this game is without the danger of an entire enemy faction competing against each other.... Switched back to PvP and have not looked back since.
---
Hot pockets, doritos, shitting in a bed pan, sitting for 40 hours plus, replaying "live to win" that's how I want to play classic for two weeks straight.
---
So what are we supposed to do? Ban anyone who says they don't like retail?
---
Yup, never got into it when I was younger, and when I was old enough I played other things like RO, Maple, DN and whatever else that popped up. I always felt it was too late to jump into retail.
---
I play FFXIV though so that scratches that itch already for me so I don’t think I’ll ever touch retail WoW. Classic seems up my alley though since I was a huge fan of actual RPG elements in a mmo.
---
One of the biggest issues that made Vanilla a lot harder than classic is the 1.12 patch.  1.12 characters are MUCH MUCH more powerful than their earlier counterparts.
---
You need tranq shot for ... the big core hound in MC, whose name I forget. Also a few others that have similar mechanics
---
I never really went oom unless I was hard chain pulling. Earthbind kiting is just so OP I felt like I basically didn't have to worry about mana.
---
You do you, boo
---
And I'm saying there is no reason to "nerf" it because that's how it's supposed to work.
---
I'm in. Shadow priest at your service. Praise Christ
---
You're meant to be representing the  community as you're moderating both the official classic reddit and discord.
---
Going "oh well! too bad so sad!"  and nuking all the posts has deemed the same results - more people posting about it because it's big enough concern to be talked about frequently.    Is not constructive.
---
You could do what you do for the stuff that you personally care about tho,  which is you know message your budd's at blizzard and go yo maybe look at this the community keeps posting about it constantly so it's a genuine concern.
---
But nah.  Only two stickys.  Cant be bothered.   Right?
---
Idk, my latency on private servers is 20-30 ms and it definitely wasn't that low during vanilla. We frequently had to raid in the middle of the night because the lag was so bad. 
---
I guess Americans and especially Chinese/Aussies have more problems with latency.
---
Yeah I think it might be a low priority, aesthetically it looks awkward but it doesn't effect gameplay at all, that I'm aware of. I'm sure it's on Classic Devs to-do list.
---
Hell, we didn't even have thottbott iirc.  If we did, I don't recall using it on my first character.
---
People will be Pugging MC and Ony. You will raid and meet people at the times you're online playing.
---
Ah okay, i didnt know thanks for responding
---
They're moderators for the OFFICIAL classic wow subreddit and OFFICIAL classic wow discord.
---
If they wanted to do anything other than mass censor it they could have - and would have a long time ago.   They have the contacts to go "yo - the community wont stop talking about this.  i'm having to delete X posts a day asking about it.  is it worth a bit of a look on your end as it seems to be a big issue in the community"
---
Damn I had go back to look and fucking lol
---
who said anything about policing anything?     
---
what can you personally do about it?  don't insult or mock people who play retail wow.
---
Hibernate made core hound packs easier. Probably a way around that though.
---
YEP! Thottbott was a MASSIVE help to early game quests.
---
I remember leveling as a resto druid, using bearform as that was the only VIABLE way to level.
---
Things are very VERY different.
---
I didn't say it was a charity dumbass, grow up. It's a hell of a lot of work for a "Cash grab". They are intending on this being sustainable for years, so no, not a cash grab.
---
As long as the Alliance is the upvote.
---
And why aren't there gnome druids. Urmygurd they would be so cute! Little kitty cat form, cuddly little bear form, the tiny cut moonking 😍.
---
One thing to keep in mind with Kargoz is all of his material relates to Vanilla Private Servers so may not apply to Classic.  
---
His Warlock triangle-trapping strategy does not work because the imp can be 1-shot.  
---
His early wand guide does not work because mail takes an hour to send between toons and cloth drop rates are much lower on Classic.
---
But yes, his videos are very good and I still recommend them often.
---
A few other really good YouTubers (that I follow) are MadSeasonShow, SilviteSoltis (for gearing guides), Platinum WoW (check out his Vanilla Flavors series).
---
bobby b, when did u get here?
---
THE WHORE IS PREGNANT!
---
I always thought the surv hunter spec was quite hilarious.   IIRC I leveled as surv on my 1st char.  The 31 pt talent was a bleed that did almost no dmg.   It was totally trash.
---
Quit thinking everyone is out to get you. You aren’t that interesting, nor is your preferred topic, and your solutions are extremely unlikely to be original just because you didn’t see them somewhere.
---
&gt;stop disliking things that other people like!
---
begone troll
---
is that why u are here, bobby b?
---
I ASK YOU, NED, WHAT GOOD IS IT TO WEAR A CROWN?
---
Yes, it is cheap skill / expensive mount in the beta. I don't know if that will change.
---
Hunter is actually the one class I have never played and I was really excited to go hunter main for Classic.  Then I did some research and watched current gameplay of hunters in the beta.   Not a chance.  Hunter pet AI is completely broken.  They will run to hit an enemy once then run back to your side.  Can't FD/Trap in BG's.  Melee leeway is completely messed up.  Reduces hunters deadzone even further.  Hunters already have to work harder than most classes to prove themselves in raids.  Having additional bugs that didn't exist in vanilla will only make it more difficult.
---
You can mumble gibberish all you want, I'll concur when he provides a link.
---
Straight to personal insults eh? Nice bud. No. The sub requirement to get a beta invite is quite literally just a cash grab. You even have to select the option on your account so "just for people interested" isn't the reason. It's just for money.
---
It's kinda smart because they could basically sell a potato and say it runs classic fine and it will.
---
It’s not. Notice I didn’t say they were adding something. I said they think they are adding something.
---
I didn’t know being egotistical and acting like a child counts as being “normal” these days.
---
I want to believe you, and make a feral tank druid.  But I don't want to be stuck healing on a druid.   That would probably suck ass.
---
I mean it happened. I distinctly remember blinking away and having a status effect. You setup to avoid certain trades or risk it.
---
I think our gaming philosophy is pretty much the same. 
---
I do it for fun, not as a second job. I want to do well and I research tips and strategies, but if I screw up, I screw up.
---
I know how your wife felt about the void walker fiasco. Warlock was my first and only toon until WotLK. I would forget to dismiss my VW in dungeons sometimes and then other times I'd have the right pet but wouldn't dismiss him when we'd jump down to bypass packs of mobs only to have my demon merrily bring them all straight to our group to go on a murderous rampage. 
---
My wife played a Druid and got flamed when her Starfall pulled mobs from the next zone. She went healer and did well and loved it until it became fashionable to chain pull dungeons and los your healer while they're getting mana. 
---
My wife didn't really understand my addiction to the game back when we were dating. We were already living together and worked the same schedule, but then I got put on the opposite shift from her and she started playing just because she missed hearing the sounds and watching me play. 
---
I remember back then I ran Mik's Scrolling Battle Text addon and it makes distinct sounds when you're oom or low on health. One night she told me "All this time it sounded like you were killing it and racking up a high score (like the sounds from a pinball machine) but in reality you were getting your ass kicked." lol
---
I played Ultima on Nintendo back the day but never got to play Ultima Online. Missed out in that whole experience. I never was a part of anything epic in WoW, only so so at pvp, but love it all the same. 
---
There are times when I thought if wow is still a thing when I'm 70 users old, I'll still be playing it, but here lately I think I'm just done with it. I'm pretty excited about Classic but seeing the division it's causing between the players only reaffirms this isn't the game I grew up playing. 
---
I wish you all the best in life and your endeavors in the game, whichever version you go with.
---
Ion said hopefully a few weeks but fully gone by phase 2.
---
Demonic sac a succubus and shadowbolt spamming probably the way to go, or voidwalker sac for hp regen and just use it for extra lifetapping.
---
Much as I hate to say it(as a former druid) I don't see them being mandatory for anything. Having at least a few would be very helpful, sure, but no vanilla content I can think of absolutely required a Druid.
---
Agreed for the basic feel, but for more in-depth, I'd go to 40 when you can get the ultimate in a tree. Also respeccing is basically free in beta, so you can test out how it is to heal as a holy or disc priest, for example.
---
You ... didn’t play vanilla anywhere near release, did you? It was a buggy pile of shit. If the server stays up for an entire week it’s ahead if some vanilla servers. Hillsbrad world battles would regularly crash pvp servers.
---
Some abilities being a bit wrong isn’t bad. Hunters are bad, but there’s no reason to expect they wont be fixed.
---
They said 100% it will be gone before phase 2 with them slowly removing them after launch since they will be needed less.
---
Hunters? Don’t care
---
It's not a sub to get an invite, its a perk of being subbed. God, thats so hard for you people to understand? They were limited on people on the server. They had to distribute it. What better than to give it to A) already paying customers as a perk, and B) give it to people already ACTIVELY playing, so they know it won't just end up sitting in a random email box of someone who played years ago. You can select the damn option YEARS ago and not even play anymore, so thats a terrible argument. 
---
BTW insults? You being a smart ass isn't any better, so don't act all high and mighty.
---
Don't customize any of your looks/race/class right when name reservation goes live.  Just grab the name on whatever race/class without any appearances tuning.
---
Then, a week later, delete that character and create one with the fine tuned appearance you want.
---
Most people will either create characters and reserve names within the first hours or do so on launch day.  Nobody is going to snipe your name if it is unreserved for 3 random minutes on August 22nd.
---
I could live with some scuffed pet behavior, but if FD doesn't instantly drop combat or scatter &amp; trap share DR hunters are gonna be mushroom tier in pvp
---
Is this the balcony Vaelastrasz?
---
This to 100%.
---
The only thing that was announced was that there won't be any RP-PvP servers, as those were not around back then as well.
---
I'll play hunter bugs or no bugs. Still more fun than other classes.
---
😂😂😃😂😂😂😨😨😨😄😄😣😣😣😣😤😤😤😤😤🔝🔝🔝
---
Blizzard never cements themselves into anything, and even when they do they just decide to not honor their commitment. The best "concrete" answer we've got is that it will be gone when phase 2 drops, which as far as I'm aware could be months after launch. Of course they could just go back on that and leave it in even later.
---
That's not a bad died, that's a specifically controlled by serveral doctors and constantly measured and adjusted diet. 12000 of steamed chicken, potatoes and fruits is not the same as 12000 of cake.
---
The reason MCP has no upgrade to it is because anything better than it would *actually* be busted. It's the fastest a weapon can get, therefore it's the best for pure speed, making it best in slot for specs like Feral Cat and Spelladin. Is Thunderfury busted because nothing is better at TPS than it is?
---
I know what you're gonna say. "Thunderfury isn't a blue though!" True, but there are random greens that are close to BiS for Priests and Warlocks until past AQ40.
---
I'll be honest, half the time I draw her, even though I've had her with face tattoos for many years now.. I still forget to draw them in sometimes..........
---
Nobody is sitting on New spam reporting memes lmao
---
&gt; it's not only difficult to find genuine 2006 vanilla footage on the web
---
It's ridiculously difficult, depending on what you're looking for. 
---
Good job, great post.
---
Do you think we expect aggresive layering at first, the kind that has caused a bit of an uproar, then it being relaxed to less noticeable layering?
---
Is this serious or no? What makes it complicated in Vanilla? I genuinely don’t know
---
i would role play as a troll who only spoke troll, so whenever i was in groups they wouldnt know what i was saying unless another troll was in the group.
---
They've said a few weeks and before phase 2.
---
The main takeaway that keeps coming up in all their talks about it is that it's a technology to deal with the launch. Therefore you should expect it to go away once the rush dies down.
---
Look out boys, we’ve got a mathematician over here
---
Yes
---
&gt;BTW insults? You being a smart ass isn't any better, so don't act all high and mighty.
---
It's fairly easy to act high and mighty when the other guy is throwing insults like "grow up" in 2019. 
---
Giving people with active subs a perk? Why? They are going to be a tiny portion of the people that want to play vanilla. The census data on classic interest showed most people having quit sometime between wrath and WOD.
---
I'm planning on going Feral OT as well, here's my plan: Skinning + LW to start, but don't sell the green items crafted for levelling, but store them on bankchars, same with drops. Once you get the recipe and mats for the trinket, drop skinning, level up enchanting with the stuff you've stored until 265, drop enchanting and re-skill skinning (which doesn't take too long). Level an alt for Herb/Alchemy.
---
I really wanted the priest class for horde to be belf in vanilla hate all the other races.
---
Yeah, there werent 10 raid guides out before content launched back then, lol
---
Am I the only one who remembers hiding in the alliance ramp to roof and watching all the alliance walk past me as I sit there cause they can’t find me. The EFC was never showed on the map
---
39*
---
49 used the "Was waz [[Kang the Decapitator]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2291) 'n shiet"
---
The warrior can taunt if that happens...
---
I remember a few expansions ago Blizzard promised to fix their ancient auction house UI in WoW. Nothing happened.
---
Then at BfA launch the big servers had major slowdowns on the auction house, and Blizzard did a couple of quick fixes with yet another promise of a major overhaul. But they haven't said anything more since as far as I know.
---
The armorless will not be in classic *at all*.
---
Undead paladin. Casting any type of holy spell is pure agony.
---
I, for one, welcome the apocalypse
---
You are putting your head in the sand because you weren't there in 2004 when it launched. Starting zones were a shitshow because overcrowding. It isn't possible to alleviate that without the modern engine. Otherwise you have stupid amounts of sharding that would be far worse than layering.
---
Because its just one way to do it. Hmm let me think, give already paying customers a perk, or just send it out to anyone.... hmm.... thats a real tough one
---
druid/rogue is good.
---
But -- play what you want to play? Whatever would be fine.
---
I dunno about that, from people I know that got an invite, which is 4 out of 25 people.  One person got to level 4 got bored and never touched it again. I think one person already did everything back in the day including Naxx and didn't even bother installing. Other 2 people I think got further, to like level 10-20 but with 8.2 coming people are going to be prepping for 8.2 Mythic progress soon so no time for classic.
---
I think the main problem is they invited people who are currently subbed and have been subbed for long time + streamers. They should have given keys to give out to content creators, so that people who actually want to play classic would get in.
---
Tanking as feral is possible, you can DPS as feral (it's just not the best spec, as the DPS can be lacking), and raiding pretty much resto is the way to go.
---
Feral DPS in raiding is really painful, you have to play out of your mind to compete, and the other DPS competing with you can basically be brain-dead while keeping up with you.
---
But as for solo PVP/PVE, feral is fine. It's the highest end you need to worry about.
---
(For the record when I am talking about raiding specs, I mean AQ era and later for raids, MC/BWL you can have half the raid be moonkins and clear the place)
---
People were also trying to gear out by collects tier 0.   Not what's actually prebis.  Because nobody knew any better
---
I’ve got bad news for you
---
Depends what you use shards for.   If you sac your VW every duel and spam shadowburn, then yeah you'll run out of shards pretty quick.
---
Keep in mind that Blizzard will have an internal build not released to the public, where they normally have majority of bugs squashed before they do a large update on the live beta client.
---
I'm worried, but I think we'll be fine before release.
---
Hunter for 15 years, on Horde - planning to go Alliance this time, as I've never experienced it.
---
Shit, I can't keep all these expansions straight anymore. It's been like 10 years.
---
Send it out to just anybody? You have to go into your account settings and select classic wow. I ready said this. It isn't going to sit in some unused email inbox. 
---
Now your whole argument is based off you not even reading what I said.
---
There are plenty of us who enjoy spending time on new to be the glorified trashmen of this subreddit.
---
i was on the test not beta, and it was 100% because of layering. the way they're layering is actually horrendous because they layer the entire continent the starting zones have lots of people but as you thin out when you level the few people in your layer could be anywhere 
---
in tbc you had to wait 2 hours not 2 days, it was a queue that was gone after 2 days. but thank you for making my point, instant gratification pieces of shit will ruin classic for months and end up quitting because its not an instant gratification game. 
---
its the entire argument for layering, if you can't remove layering with a 15k pop you can't guarantee you'll remove it when phase 2 starts so the only point of it is to play through the starting zones smoothly.
---
&gt; First Horde
---
And the second Horde put Teldrassil to flames and killed countless innocents too. Horde 1 and 2 both pretty big on Genocide.
---
More like stop mocking people who like things you dislike
---
I think you’ll probably have to make one.
---
If you make an RP walk only or first person view only guild I’m in.
---
You know full well that saying you don't like that thing is going to be interpreted as "mocking" those people who like it.
---
Shoo.
---
Agreed. I always make my own, never liked any of the compilation UIs.
---
Yes! Give us this option.
---
he'll figure it out, 11 year olds aren't complete imbeciles. vanilla lvling gave abilities at a reasonable rate such that he won't be overwhelmed
---
and even if he doesn't, he'll have fun anyway
---
You could always buy an edgemaster's handguards if it's bugging you that much. Play what you want to play.
---
It IS though, what are you not getting? You can select that box YEAAAAAAAAARS ago. I did it like what, maybe 6 years ago?
---
STV + Un'goro
---
He wasn't unkillable. Your average raider then was only slightly more retarded than they are now and there was a lot of fire to stand in
---
They said at the latest it would end when p1 ends, but in all likelihood it would be a few weeks or a month.9
---
It kind of comes with the territory, unfortunately.  Every single person who quit wow at some point has opinions on why they quit wow.  That means every person who wants to come back to play classic, which is its core audience, have opinions on "what went wrong" so to speak with retail wow.
---
It does get too extreme at times and I'm definitely not innocent of it, but when that sort of opinion is both a common denominator and is related to the subreddit, you can expect alot of it.
---
Absolutely, we would walk up to a boss and be like "that looks scary let's see what happens when we poke it with a STICK". Only way you knew it was a raid boss, was because it was SKULL LEVEL compared to you at 60
---
By explaining in full detail. 
---
Inb4 we have engineering. 
---
Engineering should have been part of tinker class. Its not like the concept of a tech/cyberpunk warcraft character didnt exist. They had heliocopters and demolition teams, and submarines back in wc2. wc3 had the alchemist and goblin tinker hero. 
---
Just make it similar to GW2 has for engineer.
---
The servers will be so packed you won’t notice it. The worry about layering now is people abusing it to hop layers and farm rare mobs ect.
---
Don't think there is a definitive answer, but I would expect it as they were testing varying population levels with the last stress test. That to me implies they are trying to determine what population level each layer should be on launch day.
---
Like I respect and like your idea but it's a waste of xp
---
Ok. Now you are just factually incorrect. You can't have selected to opt in to the classic beta 6 years ago. You can say it again in caps lock, but it won't change anything.
---
*looks at druid* yep that's pretty normal.
---
This is what I thought as well.
---
Been doing that since crash bandicoot 2
---
I think blizzard's 10,000,000,000 IQ is just setting up Classic to have no hunters and just have the Huntards playing the broken class so we know who all the bads are.
---
Totems are group wide, not raid wide in classic. You want more than 2 for sure.
---
Vs a good Hunter you don't.
---
I meant 1, auto correct -- I edited it.
---
I'n rolling shaman but I'm rolling it to be one of the best shamans!
---
They said it would be gone by phase 2 because phase 2 introduces world bosses.
---
I’m rolling Druid and engineering.
---
There is absolutely nothing more satisfying than using a gnomish death ray and obliterating a gnome.
---
Yeah man, top quality nerds. Play gnome/dwarf in most roles. Monkeynews and Tribe (both stream the beta)  are from there. Their realm first naxx kill on pserver is on youtube too  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVS6YnSMe28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVS6YnSMe28)   
---
Worth a watch, impressive run
---
Moonkin hits with the weapon and therefore gets procs.
---
I'd say druid would probably be best, but Shaman or Paladin both can do melee or heal
---
if its not the nicker in classic riot
---
Specced Balance while leveling for hurricane (thinking it would be like the Diablo 2 Druid Hurricane)
---
I only respecced to get innervate for MC... 
---
... the talent tree revamp was a godsend.
---
It's like 150 in the USA.
---
You should go back and edit more of your posts.
---
I'm American, and I never said anything about free speech. So whatever you like, whenever you like, but I don't have to listen to any of it. Which is precisely why I would join a moderated community - to filter out the pointless, off topic, low effort speech.
---
Feral druids are at least on par with warriors for dungeons and ok as dps. For raids, druids can main tank almost all bosses, but on average a warrior will be the better choice. They make great off-tanks, though - switching to cat after their add is dead. Here's a great guide: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
"I want to just call people bad names and i don't want to get in trouble for it" ..... basically what i heard.
---
Seems about right. I leveled through the war effort and certain low level mats sold for big gains during that time. Also economy is different on every server on bigger ones there was more gold around.
---
yep/
---
No, this is farther into BWL. I totally forget the name of the boss though. It's the one with two raised areas on opposite sides of the room with the middle ground floor full of mobs during the fight.
---
Hunter = Mordekaiser
---
There are no wrong decisions :)
---
Also most peoples exercises probably dont come close to 500 calories.
---
None of this is a problem in retail, why would this be a problem in classic?
---
There will be a ton of people playing Classic who never quit WoW.  A lot of retail players will try it and play it between major retail content releases.  
---
We kind of need this subreddit to be for everyone, not just one segment of players. Everyone playing will come here to ask questions, discuss and get info on Classic.
---
Telling someone to google it when its such an obvious answer is only natural in the internet. Welcome to the tradition eh!
---
I highly doubt Blizz is going to nerf an item, it was like that back in Vanilla, it's going to carry through to Classic. They care about bugs, not the substance of the game.
---
Because if you push button in the wrong order and not at the good timing, your dps will be 1/5 of what it should be at.
---
Way harder than mage and warlock pushing one button and hoping for crits and no resist.
---
Depends what you're looking forward to in classic. 
---
About 40 of these bugs don't phase me but as someone who looks forward to wpvp and raiding the most, there are about 5 or 6 that are pushing me to roll another class as they essentially break or significantly gimp the gameplay of the class.
---
Shit, guess i will just live with the fact you reported me. You know, because nothing bad will happen to me because i did nothing wrong..
---
I probably wouldn’t worry about the differences and just consume some general Vanilla content. 
---
The differences between wrath and vanilla are mostly nuance and numbers. The gameplay is mostly similar. 
---
As for Cata obviously the map is different too

In almost every dev interview they've said something along the lines of "Our utmost intention is to bring people a complete classic experience". Obviously some things (looking at you hunter bugs) they're having trouble recreating. I think it clearly implies though, that they won't be nerfing items or re-balancing. It would go against all of the philosophy they've stated publicly. Could I be wrong down the line? Hell yes. Just my interpretation of what the devs have doing/saying throughout the process.
---
My guess is that, once the game is actually released, that kind of content will tone down and it will be more focused on the actual game.  Hopefully that will help.
---
I think right now everyone is excited but doesn't have much yet to talk about, so they keep dredging up the same tired topics.
---
You don't know that.
---
No way.
---
They weren't, and there's no way they would be better.   Makes no sense.
---
To be fair the bfa devs are probably too preoccupied with creating new content to fix old bugs. The classic devs are focused solely on investigating / fixing bugs and implementing layering.

---
I have records of about 1-2 months free gameplay due to server issues and remember plenty of bugs besides that. This will be mild.
---
no...it's a melee/caster spec, just like elemental is.
---
You want Boar, if you can get it (Spirit+Strength), Gorilla if you can't find any boar (Int/Str), or Owl (int/spr) if you can't find any of that. Tiger (str/agl) or Wolf (agl/spirit) if you can't find either of those, Whale (stam/spr) or eagle (stam/int) as an absolute last resort.
---
And you should be trying to weave LBs between your auto-attacks, not using shocks, shocks are horribly inefficient on mana and should only be used in group settings for their 2ndry effects (interupt/slows etc) or if the fight will end before mana becomes an issue.
---
In Solo play, you use mostly lightning shield and maybe flameshock (if the enemy will last longer than 12 seconds) and/or a couple LBs and only shock mid-fight if you need an interrupt or the enemy is going to run. This gives you time to get in several ticks of mana regen before you need to rebuff LS, and overall helps you make it through with minimal down-time. 
---
Use totems any time you can pull enemies back to back or Searing totem to supplement damage if you pull 2+ enemies (it's highly efficient damage to mana and can even be used on solo enemies if they'll last more than 15 seconds).
---
This applies the same when playing elemental as they and enhancement play pretty much the same. The only difference is that elemental typically leans towards slow 1hders+shield (or a fast 2hder if it's a good staff) and has faster LBs (2 sec vs 3 sec), while enhancement leans towards physical and uses slower 2hder (something 3.5+ speed so you don't clip your autos while slipping in LBs).
---
Always use rockbiter while soloing, until basically 60, OR the enemy has high armor.
---
in groups always use Flametongue unless the enemy is highly resistant/immune to fire, in which case use Windfury. (Windfury should generally never be used unless absolutely nessecary OR in PVP).
---
if you decide to level resto, same deal, same gear, same technique, just your heals will be faster/more efficient and your support totems better. (Gear like you're elemental, but try to get a 3.2/3.5 speed staff to use since you won't have 2 sec cast LBs though you might be able to pick up the 2hd axe/mace talent from enhancement if you're primarily raid healing and can skip getting healing way)
---
&gt;It IS though, what are you not getting? You can select that box YEAAAAAAAAARS ago. I did it like what, maybe 6 years ago?
---
Just for reference.
---
The Nicker stole my mount.
---
How do you get that quest? Long time hunter here haha
---
I played pve back in vanilla and that’s what I prefer. I leveled on a pvp server for a bit when taking a break from my main during tbc and almost all of the high levels were in battlegrounds, not doing world pvp. 
---
I just want to quest and chill, or do battlegrounds when I’m in the mood for competitive pvp. Battlegrounds won’t be in classic at release, and I don’t feel like being target practice for bored level 60s since I won’t be leveling fast.
---
I'll probably just roll on an RP server until they hopefully implement an RP-PVP server later. I love RP and world PVP, but when it comes down to it, I value the former over the latter. Still, it'll be disappointing to have to choose between the two.
---
I deserve a classic wow that was promised, not one with layering and hunters not working.
---
Need if you are going to immediately equip/learn it. Greed otherwise = you are likely to sell it. 
---
Some people claim that they should need BOEs as everyone “needs” gold but they will be going on my ignore list if they do it on any run I am tanking on.
---
Close, but (all+problems)^½ is the root of all problems, actually
---
Someone can get there running a survival melee build maybe?
---
Can't say for sure. I turned in cloth at different levels and got the same reward, but I didn't really test it.
---
missing elemental shaman
---
For me, it's the pacing. I main WW and I love to be constantly on the move and having some button to press. Also the attacks have great animations
---
LBRS spiders, that freaking mother's milk poison. Basically makes the rest of the dungeon undoable without poison removal.
---
Boring
---
Retail players don’t like retail either in slot of cases. Just feel the need to collect/keep up.
---
There’s nothing in the game more thrilling than turning in some quests at Nesingwary and seeing hundreds of skeletons on the ground. Pure danger.
---
I'm not wasting my time arguing with some condescending little punk. I misread what you wrote and accidentally put 6, I thought you were talking the Betas box in general, because yes you could opt into upcoming betas. Once I saw you specifically said the classic, because I thought we were talking betas IN general, I changed it. Still valid, a fucking year ago I opted in. A year. Go bitch and cry some more about layering when you have no other alternative. You don't know shit about the real world if you don't think it costs money to get this up and going. They are paying many people months of time to do this.
---
I’m just happy to level through them all in maxed out settings this time around!
---
I suppose we have to agree on not agreeing then.
---
Because I see absolutely no reason why other people must adjust to YOU on a EUROPEAN server and speak English or even waste their time learning it despite never needing it in their private life outside of this one game. And the last time I checked Europe was more than just England.
---
Try to think about this in a logical way without involving your feelings on the matter: You are asking people that can't speak English to go out and learn it just for people like you. Learning a language is an extremely long process and incredibly hard if it's self-taught and you are asking a stranger to do it just so you can communicate with them.
---
If you (or people that think like you) want to communicate so badly then perhaps you should learn their language?
---
I can't stress this enough: This is NOT an English server, It will be a European server and people WILL form their own little groups and stick to them.
---
Fuck, I kept reminding myself that I needed to buy another yoga ball because my dog popped it, but I recently bought a nice executive chair 🤦‍♂️ guess who's selling a chair
---
Ah shit you're right. I'm really wanting my priest to be the healer as it'll make strat farming easier with shackle, but no poison cleanse  :(
---
Any idea if first aid antidote works on that bosses poison?
---
UD healer, played one on unofficial WoW classic couple of years ago and loved it. Played mage during BC-WoTK and furry warrior WoD. Haven’t played since. Looking forward to getting into the game.
---
There is no melee build in 1.12
---
Right click reporting has existed for awhile in retail. Has it caused a mass problem of people being banned for minor infractions?......
---
Opinions differ quite a bit so I would encourage you to think about how you want to play. Daggers are slightly slower to level if you are just going to quest and grind your way to 50+. But if you like PvP and you will be often partying with friends or running dungeons, daggers are still just about as good, and you’ll have an edge when it comes to fighting off gankers (assuming deep sub tree talents) Personally I never liked the play style of swords and maces so I always go daggers.  
---
Night elf essentially gives you a free rank in increased stealth, but gnome and dwarf both have nice bonuses that only apply to pvp, and human has a small bonus in weapon skill for pve. I’ll be doing Dwarf because I think stoneskin is a powerful tool for world pvp and BGs.
---
Well, sleep *is* for the weak

---
Survival really isn't a sustained melee build, more of a collection of some nice general stats and a few oh-shit buttons for when you do find yourself in melee and need to either end the fight fast or get out of melee range.
---
Human racials are considered weaker than Gnome/Dwarf racials.
---
So animation is purely race and sex dependent. If you like melee button mashing I would suggest either Rogue or Warrior. 
---
Warrior is more of reacting to procs and other things. Plus threat management is big for you since you have no threat dump. 
---
Rogue is more of following a rotation while managing combo points on the target and keeping a buff up on yourself.
---
Are you Alliance or Horde? Horde got a fun windfury totem for extra shenanigans.
---
A lot of current retail players will try it, realize it's actually challenging then run back to the comfort of retail where they can get everything for little to no effort.  Best those types stay there because they're the reason original WoW got ruined in the way it did to even prompt classic in the first place.
---
Instagob
---
Troll everything
---
Horde are far from bad guys in Vanilla.
---
There's heaps of bugs at the moment that are relatively insignificant but if you're into pvp there are some pretty game breaking ones. To list a few:
---
Delay on FD dropping combat, FD not working in BGs, scatter and trap sharing DRs, pet actions are delayed, intim not stunning through shields, pets going passive after one attack and the melee leeway mechanic (unsure if this is a bug). 
---
Put together these make me a bit wary of playing hunter if your goal at 60 is pvp.
---
Well, looks like that’s two people suggesting you’re just wrong.
---
&gt;you can at least drink and get sent overseas ~~to die in a war.~~
---
Let's just ignore that bit. It *is* America, after all
---
You're so cool
---
You accidentally wrote out in all capital letters YEEEEEARS. Then said 6 years? Or you assumed I meant Betas in general when we were specifically talking about classic beta. That doesnt make any sense. You even said it was a typo. So what's the story you're going with on this? 
---
Condescending? You're the one that started throwing out personal insults about my intelligence and how I should grow up. 
---
&gt;Go bitch and cry some more about layering when you have no other alternative. You don't know shit about the real world if you don't think it costs money to get this up and going. They are paying many people months of time to do this.
---
Amazing. It does cost money. It's called an investment. You don't demand money for products that you haven't finished yet, unless you want to be labeled with terms like "cash grab".
---
Rather ironic since classic wow can probably be ran on a craiglist 50$ pc.
---
Both anti-venom and restorative potions should work.
---
Don't take this seriously, the guy can't even do a proper rotation when he did the hunter test and was wrong in gear bis with 12% hit.
---
He ran his casters test with nightfall proc 100% up time aswell which never happen.
---
Razorgore is the first boss of the raid.
---
Look we're like 2 months out, there is no way all this is getting fixed in 2 months. Be realistic.
---
I would say it depends on phase and gear. In phase 1+2 I would definitely go deep prot with anger management. You can still taunt bosses and mobs in MC so threat isn’t a big issue, whereas survivability, defence, resistances kinda are. I’d link you the spec I’m planning to go but I’m on mobile and I have it saved on a laptop.
---
I remember twinking 20-29 WSG back in the day.  Capture the flag was intense and hiding the flag when there wasn't a priest around was common.
---
Mind Vision is back baby!
---
This is fake. This guy is a phony.
---
Yeah, let's just completely leave out an entire server type that was available back during vanilla because it'll potentially have a small population.  /s
---
Come on. What happened to #nochanges? All we're asking for is at least one RP-PVP server.
---
Preach, I used to love the stuck in combat bugs of vanilla dungeons precisely to match around with starting every fight with a huge rage pool.
---
So I think the high level first-aid item was AD rep, which might not be till a later patch...but I'm not 100% sure what phase AD rep is coming out in.
---
There's purification potions, but those are pricey. Maybe jungle remedy, but I feel like that might be too low. Sorry I have no definitive answer, it's generally hard to make a party without somebody who can clear poisons.
---
As a old time rogue i don't remember anything being an issue, but i was never a group leader so i never had to make sure a party or raid had what it needed. I just focused on staying out of the fire while doing as much dps as possible.
---
Duuh 😕
---
I would say Soul Shards are way more of a hassle in PvP than ammo. Ammo can be bought or crafted, but shards have to be farmed. They also make a huge difference in PvP especially if you're playing Destruction which is the most popular PvP spec.
---
Of course you can shards from targets that grant honor, but you can't really rely on being able to do that like you can in PvE.
---
Instructions unclear, just signed up for a triathlon.
---
More Serpent Stings!
---
Sure thing man, you're right. Move along, I know you're probably out for school break or something.
---
Its because the game was too new and gear guides, BiS, general knowledge about talents, spells, and mechanics was still not fully known to everyone. Imagine not knowing you needed fire resist until you got to rag and then not knowing where to farm all the gear yet or what the fr cap was.
---
There is no way they don’t have it back for AQ opening.
---
Random math-y question for tanking: how do blocks, dodges, and parries get calculated? Is there a hierarchy, like if at first you don't dodge, then you attempt to block, then parry? Some other method?
---
Blizz literally told the RP-PVP community in a bluepost to make noise about the servers if we want them included in classic, so that's exactly what we're doing.
---
*Very very slowly*
---
&gt; However, since we only have 2 stickies and rotating threads it is quite hard to justify holding off a rotating thread for a megathread, especially one that has been done before.
---
what?! are we back to news on paper? isn't this a virtual space?!
---
the moderating group is treating this like it's spam and this is not ok. the abundance of messages appears because the problem is real, it's affecting everyone and is persistent and therefore it is normal to have a recurrence in posting.
---
so plz tell me where i have to donate so *we can buy more megathreads so we don't run out of them*. 
---
&gt;We are just like you
---
be like us and allow equal place for "arts stuff", "bugs", "old and new memes", "elite gameplay" etc, at the same time.
---
there is also a big chunk of users that know that a new or old meme will not make the game more enjoyable but fixing bugs and broken features will. pushing out these errors will make it more visible for everyone including blizzard. plz stop diminishing this.
---
After some research, it seems the quest chain to obtain this item requires you be Horde to start, even though the quest that gives you this reward isn't faction specific. Any idea if you can skip the into quest with Fallen Hero of the Horde
---
Trolls
---
Auwch, I remember back on Nost I joined an American guild with my paladin instantly topped the meters because I could just snipe everyone in the raid. 
---
As much as I'll miss meeting interesting people from beyond the pond I'm happy that you will finally be able to play the game with a good ping.
---
I think they were joking ;)
---
Argue the points. Don't attack the person. People won't take you seriously if you do.
---
I find your lack of faith disturbing
---
Your instincts have failed you.
---
I’m really leaning towards orc rogue.
---
During vanilla I made it to level 47 as a warrior before BC came out. Going to roll a warrior and hopefully see all the raid content this time around!
---
Nagas belong in slave pens
---
And that's what I'm expecting as well. There will definitely be people who get pulled over permanently, and people who play both. But those I think will both be outweighed by the people who aren't happy with how much more challenging and time consuming it used to be and will go back to retail, and that's fine. Some people won't like what Classic is going to be, and that's perfectly fine. For them there is retail, and again, that's fine.
---
I expect the breaking point for people is when they hit 20 and aren't able to immediately get a cheap and easy mount.
---
This wasn't a respectful argument to begin with. You were extremely condescending and a smart ass right off. That's why you got the reaction you did. I would have gladly seen your point of view and portrayed mine, but just because my "language" contains more slurs than yours, it means I'm personally attacking you, and you aren't. You can sub consciously personally attack someone, which is what you did.
---
Cries in casual
---
I don’t care about the gear, I care about the one Alliance you left alive in the background. Good job overall, I do see two skeletons though!
---
Go back and read your original comment, and then tell me you were being respectful at the start.
---
I like your comment but I cannot understand why "stick" is capitalized. When I read it I feel strange yelling it.
---
Hour a day? OPs regiment is like less than an hour a week if you play every day. What does 10 pushups take? 30 seconds? Lol
---
Classic will belong to the true gamers, the originals who wanted a challenging game with laborious endgame content, not the try-hard baddies who complained endlessly about the game being too hard prompting Blizzard to dumb it down to the point you could strap a monkey to a computer now and he'll be level capped with full raid gear in two weeks.  
---
All of this of course forgetting that when WoW originally came out all of us playing games like Everquest and Final Fantasy XI were like "omg that game is dumbed down, no real challenge, they're ruining MMO's" lol
---
Oh...I guess it won't be authentic because more people will get armorless mounts in classic than in 2004, since they'll know it's limited and rush for it. That would have been cool though.
---
The grind is definitely worse on BFA imo. At this point its closer to playing Borderlands in terms of loot.
---
I agree, I honestly cant think of a PC release that has as much hype around it as Classic, except for Cyberpunk 2077 but that's way too far off.
---
Oh, I have already decided on going warrior for classic. I tried it out on all 3 stress tests and liked it a lot! Can't wait for it!
---
I don't know, I haven't played retail in a almost a decade now.
---
Please fix it. As a hunter enthusiast I’ll be so torn if I have to pick another class :(
---
People complaining about material camping are hilarious. You do realize Chinese gold farmers are a thing right?  And minus WoW Tokens they will be back in full force.
---
 "Lol they aren't selling the damn game. Cash out? Our 15$ a month is barely going to pay for all the man hours to make this work. You guys are seriously underestimating the cost to put this into action if you think this is just an "Easy cash grab". "
---
What's disrespectful there? "Damn"? I run a trade company, i swear a ton. I don't give a fuck. It's not meant to be hurtful or personal. I went on to explain our sub barely pays the man hours it took to put this into action. Not once was it a personal attack. Everyone can underestimate things, that is NOT a feat of lack of intelligence.
---
Let us never forget the 180 lookback that must accompany. 
---
Extra points if you are a hunter and waste a disengage jump turn just to be extra fly.
---
Same thing happened to me. My classic relative post got deleted the same day the mods allowed some generic MMO video stay.
---
Mods: What the hell? Please follow your own rules.
---
It's amazing how some people thought that building Classic was supposed to be as simple as copying Vanilla's old code onto a modern server infrastructure, clicking a magic "Run" button and throwing the doors open.
---
It ain't that easy.  Millions of little bugs &amp; details like this are a great example.
---
I’d rather have it delayed. I don’t want a half ass rushed game
---
Slam has no CD
---
On one hand, that's awesome, but on another hand, the sides of the screen move so fast when you turn that it'd probably give me a headache.
---
&gt; Is Thunderfury busted because nothing is better at TPS than it is?
---
It's a legendary, so it gets to be busted somewhat.   But yes, it's broken as fuck, and had to be nerfed, because people were still using it throughout TBC.
---
It procs from spamming slam
---
No truer words have ever been spoken
---
What kind of puss puss deletes their comment? You're a sad man
---
lol yes it is, don't be daft
---
Don't forget the drama it brings.

What about the world buffs.  If that exploit isn't changed then it completely fucks up the pve aspect of the game.

You're the exact person I outlined. Welcome to the other side of toxic.

no they just think outside of the box and normal war crimes dont apply to them just like everybody in times of war
---
Just be patient, enjoy the journey. My guess if you are first time Classic player it will take you about 3 month to get to level 60.

it would be nice to have a blue confirmation for this.

Demon Hunters should have been Spell Breakers, and by that I mean in class design. Though Spell Breaker is much, much different than a tinker and I don't think it has a place in a fantasy MMO. It's so jarring against the setting, even Gnomes are bad in this.
---
If PvP items are released in phase two, how long will it take post release (knowing BGs are going to be phase three) to obtain a PvP trinket? (Insignia of the horde)  How much world PvP grinding will be required to obtain one in phase two?
---
I doubt anything will be pushed back, but I also doubt most bugs will be fix.  As it stands the bug list is large, and the bugs that are being found indicate much more is wrong.
---
I like to treat instance portals like they're the paintings in Super Mario 64
---
Who knows if we’ll even get post classic content, if we do I could see her being involved, but if no classic+ we wont see her
---
Seriously doubt it.
---
Where did you pull that number from? Your ass?

Until debuff slots get expanded you only spam starfire, but post AQ you have more flexibility

Great discussion! Thanks all

I mean, phase 2 literally doesn't function with layering, so it's definitely going to be gone by then. Whether or not they'll stick to the "probably gone in a few weeks or a month," really depends on the playerbase/tourists moreso than Blizzard themselves.
---
Imo that thread with  10 min video stood out because it had actual proof and wasn't just some ungrounded bashing... What's the purpose of this subreddit if discussion about hot topics is forbidden??? Patting each other on the back and praising developers???
---
[You don't know how it works](https://youtu.be/skWzi3o4oGI?t=176)
---
More of that RPG based game design that is completely absent in retail.
---
Playing a hunter in classic was an epic ordeal. Your class was tanking, healing, and dps all-in-one. Not something to master lightly.
---
You're clearly being flamboyant and swearing for no reason but to invite a response. You get one but you took it way too personal. I seriously hope you arent running any sort of company.
---
I did play the game in wotlk, they weren't as easy as people claim them to be when you first got to 80 and did them in questing gear. Most people only have experience of them further into the expansion, after they had gear from normal dungeons, after they got gear from the vault, after they had pugged naxx and so forth. 
---
It was pretty much the same as stepping into cata heroics.
---
5 minutes of burpees,
---
Fahk that
---
It's actually a very far from a good community, nice try though
---
haha
---
I vaguely remember hunters naming their pets their own name so as to try to confuse the /target to not actually targeting the player. So Mind Vision would be a little more difficult to pull off
---
&gt; but that just creates a perception of bias to a class,
---
yeah it's really hard to say "we are aware of these lists of bugs from all the classes and we are working on them"
---
Psh...*shakes head*.
---
Lol
---
If you're pulling the 'First Horde' bullshit then the whole racism and slavery thing was the Alliance of Lordaeron, not the Alliance. :)
---
You can't brush away the actions of the Horde under the leadership of Blackhand/Guldan and later Doomhammer without also disqualifying the Alliance under the leadership of Terenas.
---
I want them to fix the hunter bugs for obvious reasons, but a 25th reddit thread about the hunter bugs isn't bringing more attention to the issue to Blizzard. They know. They know about all of these bugs because they've all been reported many times in-game, through the forums, and again here. We also don't need a 3rd megathread on layering. We all know about it, Blizzard is well aware how a lot of people feel about it, there's no reason to keep spamming the same posts every day. It is spam and most people are annoyed by it, regardless of how you feel.
---
Do WSG Tokens give XP per turn in?

Yeah layering seems to be the main target.  They were also deleting threads talking about the inaccuracies of Beta.

You stupid??? How many threads do we need talking about the exact same topic? I couldn't care less what little Timmy's ideas are to fix the layering issues.

This video is from 2.0 PRE-EXPANSION patch (late 2006) and the ENEMY TEAM is on vent talking about his position off-map, leading me to believe it did show on the map after a certain amount of time in 2.0. And yes, I know 2.0 is not 1.12, but this is speaking to the latter half of the OP post.

This would be so much simpler with an app. It could be customized per event with a timer, logs, etc.
---
Look up my comments on reddit -- I swear quite frequently, its my general way of talking/vocab. I type as if I were talking to the person irl. Yup, I run a very successful company actually. You can act like you weren't, but you were the first to take it personal here. Sub conscious or not, it still counts. That's my last comment towards you -- Take care
---
Alliance kiddies have bed time.
---
In vanilla, you could only charm pets at level or below.
---
look. now you are making me cry. telling me that spellbreakers wont be a thing. 
---
Wait, are you saying spellbreaker doesnt have a place in fantasy MMO, or tinker doesnt. 
---
Cause the era of a tinker in a fantasy setting would be like 1600-1850. Which is what gilneas felt like. But even without that, with how techy goblins and gnomes have been from wc2 to now, it totally makes sense for their to be adventurers who purely use tech. Plus it would make it so that there is another class that isnt reliant on magic. Rogue, Warrior, kinda monk, kinda hunter. 
---
But seriously spellbreakers are the best. 
---
1. Immune/resistent to magic
---
2. Steal summoned units. Water elemental, raise dead, dancing rune blade, totems etc
---
3. Steal buffs. Bloodlust, powe word stamina, hand of freedom, etc
---
4. Give back debuffs, slow,  uh i cant think of any others
---
5. Wear heavy armor, yet still have it be a dress
---
6. shield and badass weapon. 
---
7. Specs would be... uh. Antimagic, focusing on negating enemy spells, buffing allies with spell resist, and reflecting spells. fuck it i cant think of other specs
---
My max lvl priest still rocks benediction transmog but with transcendence set &lt;3 its the greatest and im so thankful they never reskinned it.
---
&gt;Yup, I run a very successful company actually.
---
Sure you are. Take care
---
In vanilla, you could only charm pets at your level or below.
---
cadaver rot is disease and a show-stopper if you cannot cure it.
---
That's true. I guess it could be potentially viable on bosses where you don't use instant poison and instead use stones, for like half of MC at least. But still major problems.
---
&gt; We also don't need a 3rd megathread on layering.
---
yeah we need one permanent bugs megathread and direct ppl to post there. SINCE IT'S BETA ANYWAY.
---
You only need rank 2 for a pvp trinket so it will be really easy.
---
You could get it the 1st reset the honor system is released without much trouble.
---
It's a bug. And it annoys me incredibly too.
---
Also makes it really hard to tell if someone's actually strafing or just running that direction.
---
I'm fairly certain half the things happening in the undercity would constitute "bad guys".
---
I made a thread here about how the official forums deleted and banned a user for questioning the accuracy of beta.  The mods here deleted my post because it was a "witch hunt".  For who im not sure.  They said I needed to provide more "evidence", this after the OP had two screenshots of the post that was banned, and the Blizzard response to the appeal.
---
In short, the mods here either flat out suck, or they are doing Activision's bidding.  Either way this sub sucks.
---
Right? It's hilarious how these idiots want to avoid streamers and can't stand them yet they're constantly talking/crying about them.
---
O shit i didn't realise i had some many trolls after me i could be a full time streamer and make millions a year. This is the part where i point out you aren't assmongold and maybe, just maybe things have been polished sense 2016.
---
It probably read his browser cookies and browsing history and put up a related ad image.

I'm just kidding, they'd never do that.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlfdu/the_definitive_hunter_bug_compilation_sheet/
---
This post covers it well.
---
You get experience for battleground mark turn ins.  At least that’s how it’s working on the beta and how it worked back in classic.
---
That said it would take you an insanely long time to level only doing battlegrounds so it’s not really viable.
---
Only place i hear people bitching is here in r/classicwow
---
&gt; true gamers
---
&gt; try-hard baddies
---
You are everything that's wrong with this community.
---
Long live Oxhorn!

How do people like you even exist?

The bare minimum I would do would be an upper/lower split totalling 4 sessions a week.

I’ve min maxed on pservers for half a decade now. Managed to maintain the eight hour workday and 30-60mins of exercise per day whilst doing so.
---
He’s probably black and gay. This is way too specific
---
Let them play other classes. I'll take my chances.
---
It has been a thing for some time now. I wouldn't be concerned. If anything remove it under #nochanges but if your complaint is "i don't want to be banned" they you probably deserve to be banned.
---
Great, thanks a lot!
---
I'm always amazed by the amount of people that don't realize reddit is a third party site and game suggestions are kind of wasted here. Post on official forums
---
Yah, so what if I am?  Is that a problem for you?
---
Funny how people are carrying this metality when most people will genrally play the game how ever the fuck they want and the minority thinking like elitests will struggle to have fun like the rest of us
---
lol you're so salty and toxic it's ironic you think you're actually a good person. Obviously this is an example to show how anyone can get silenced for literally anything  they say. What makes it a problem is how completely subjective any offense could be. You are so daft it hurts.
---
Then open your fucking eyes and get out of your bubble
---
Blue = Ages 12=18
---
Red = 18+
---
Wow. Racist, and an elitist. Must be some fat nerd.
---
If someone tries to make fun of me for not playing the correct spec I will just block them
---
Not wasting my time with a loser like that
---
Gone by phase 2 and people still carry on like its going to destroy classic... man if only they were more open minded to layering lol
---
Why, because I have always resented the whiny casuals whose louder voice led Blizzard down the path of mediocrity and ruined what was a great game?  You know it happened.  All the crying betas who loathe the very notion of challenge cried and cried and cried until Blizzard started dumbing the game down for them which then turned away the real gamers.  I'll never forgive any of them for being weak and demanding the bar be lowered for them.  At least now with Classic we don't have to worry about Blizzard dumbing that down for them, too.  That's what Retail is for.
---
100% agree and every1 should do the same
---
Why black out character names from over a decade ago?
---
Sounds to me like you have your **wishes** about how things would work confused with reality where we don’t even know if the current server architecture supports 30,000 players like vanilla originally did.
---
People don’t understand that sharding is done to offset loads and even vanilla had issues with AQ opening as a great example. 
---
To the best of my knowledge no one in the industry has demonstrated a system where that many players simultaneously in a single area works well. 
---
In many ways retail as it is set up is a step forward for stability but a step back in terms of scaling the amount of players.
---
I suspect they will go back on their word somehow once they have enough players at 60 in order to keep them coming back. I just don’t know exactly what they will say. I suspect they will use the “unprecedented popularity” of the game as an excuse though.
---
Have you ever considered seeing a therapist? Seems like something you would benefit from in the short time I’ve seen your Reddit account
---
And for those of us who have been living under a rock, what's a meme spec?
---
I promise you it's live servers. Very little is impossible to get to in the game. I can't remember all the details, but I'm fairly sure the top of karazhan could be done by getting up on the mountains between duskwood and redridge and slowfalling (maybe using a model changed campfire for some extra height).
---
And anyway, with the boat rerouting, *everything* in the overworld was trivial to reach.
---
Easiest is to get Blood Guard mount. And it is black.
---
Ya she would probably be involved with anything they do add.
---
they are ok tier.
---
Honestly it hurts me too, I really want Spell Breakers. Also I was talking about tinkers.
---
Gnomes are a bad fit, like why would anyone be able to do anything when they have planes, nukes, radiation, mechs, guns etc? Goblins are skirting the edge because a lot of their stuff is half hazardly pieced together and often blows up, they are more of a steam punk vs a sci fi vibe. 
---
I'm not arguing with speall breakers, like I said they should have been introduced in Legion over Demon Hunters. It would age much better and have a better fit as a whole while also being able to play exactly the same if Blizzard wanted.
---
A good warr can time taunt or aoe taunt for the pet to auto him out of trap, but on the flip side a good hunter can control his pet
---
Good find. This is huge. Blizzard needs to see this one.
---
I played a bit on a WotLK server recently (WotLK has the map indicator for both teams). The very first thing I thought when I saw that was how awful it makes WSG compared to Vanilla/TBC servers. People just rush the flag carrier as soon as he picks up the flag.
---
Honestly I wanna see a raid guild made up entirely of meme specs and see how they do. Could be interesting...and/or hilarious
---
The nice thing about the internet is that people can always just move on.  Since the mods want this place to be a shit meme house with no real discussion allowed, the people who want a sub full of that will stay here and the people who want real discussion will move elsewhere.
---
Spec that are "sub optimal". You have to say it like the emperor saying "unnatural"
---
It's not currently. Honestly I dont think they'll revert it. All the eyes on it would just make it linked more often.
---
Trust me I'm all for nochanges, but this weapon is just not worth the trouble
---
Holy hell...
---
I remember planning to do something like this and only did it for like a day before it became annoying. You don't do this while doing something you like, unless you are a massive fitness freak who enjoys working out.
---
I remember 10+ days I think maybe 20ish? I wasn’t good and was new to mmo’s and didn’t have any addons to begin
---
Ignore the troll. Don't engage, don't bite. Downvote and move on.
---
Meme specs are specs that are fun but not optimal for raiding/meta PvP.
---
It's a spec that isn't optimal.  Usually a dps spec from one of the classes with heals.  Boomkin, Elemental shaman, Spriest, etc...
---
Is that... a:\ floppy disk drive?!
---
I think you both underestimate how much we do communicate/the amount Blizzard reads this subreddit and their own forums whilst also overestimating how much sway we moderators have.
---
We know it's a big deal, the community knows and Blizzard knows too. We are still in beta testing with lots of work going on, lots can change in the next two months or so.
---
Weren’t poison mobs in one side of Maraudon? I want to say it was the purple side for some reason.
---
Yeah or give a reply inlines of "its a beta we are working on it" 
---
So far I've found nothing about it from Blizzards direction, it feels like half the community took to their defense and the other half started criticising layering in various levels. While I can understand the frustration about the same topic over and over its not strange and most likely healthy for the game to keep the discussion going.
---
Man some of these names are bringing back memories. I was gonna say just STV.. since I love the pvp aspect. But so many of the ones thrown out I totally didn’t even remember! Guess 15 years will do that to you
---
Gotcha, that's what I thought it might be but wanted to verify so I could keep up on discussion. Thanks!
---
The responsible person in me agrees that removing it is smart, the 12 year old barrens me needs it back
---
German and French realms were available before RP-PVP.
---
There was a sudden and stark change right after Blizzcon.  This place used to be all about #nochanges and preserving Vanilla gameplay.  
---
Then all of a sudden EVERYTHING started getting downvoted to crap.  If you talked about how Shield Slam buff might be an issue...you'd get a solid -30 votes, where as before post like this were received positively.  Any real discussion thread (positive or negative) was downvoted like crazy, it was kind of shocking.  Thats when all the garbage memes started filling the place.
---
Personally I think Blizz astroturfed this place and tried to put some mods in to tow the company line.  i haven't seen anything to change my mind about that since.
---
you can't do ALL off-spec, but I think you can run a considerable number of them and still clear content fine if the players are good enough and dedicated
---
Thanks for your opinion OP, goodbye.
---
There are a lot of posts in this subreddit that just drip with disdain for current WoW and the people who play it, too. One of those is fine, one less so. 
---
I get it, I hate WoW in its current form too. Don't pretend there isn't a real animus towards the people that play it that might have the audacity to try out Classic too, though.
---
&gt; Sounds to me like you have your wishes about how things would work confused with reality
---
Because people were upset by it. I don’t understand why you’re insulting me. I got flamed super hard for my comment and now I’m getting flamed for not having it?
---
???
---
Imagine being this jaded.
---
Its obvious because its all about layering. Shits getting annoying as fuck hearing people bitch about something thats gonna be in the game temporary. You got people bitching on the beta about layering when its a fucking BETA to test BUGS! Along with most of those people bitching about layers on streams don't report any kind of bugs or experiences with it, just a clip and they go "oh wow layerings gonna ruin this game wooow arghhh ummpphhh rudda rudda".
---
based friends &amp; family
---
If they know this why havent they confirmed this? Oo
---
Its not a strange reaction keeping the discussion going considering the situation. I'd say its healthy for the game to keep talking about it, how else will Blizzard know we really care if we just dropped issues?
---
That is completely removing trust, and not many trust Blizzard even if there is clear signs of improvement.
---
Would be pretty cool if in BFA, we see Chromie and learn the Bronze Dragonflight are running a simulation to see if things would turn out differently in Vanilla era (aka our Classic).
---
I'm sorry, i forgot sarcasm wasn't a thing anymore. 
---
The problem of easy report hasn't been a problem for years.
---
Kinda weird to have been in a guild on the classic server for 2 years when it isn't even released yet. How'd you manage that?
---
I experienced a similar situation, but I started off as enhancement.   It was at the start of the game, and no one knew what they were doing.  We were raiding MC.   Everything seemed fine, but then one day the officers told me I had to respec to healing.   I told them I wouldn't respect, until I wasn't competitive on dps anymore.   Raiding became a hostile environment after that though.    I could barely get invites, and I never got gear.  One day when I was talking to one of the officers, they  let slip that they decided I wouldn't get any more enhancement gear.     
---
I quit the guild, changed factions, and made a rogue.
---
can we please make an uproar and complain to blizzard, twitch and all of asmongold sponsor, etc about hox toxic and insensitive he is, using such verbiage like "retard" which is highly offensive and ignores real autism issues we have in the world.
---
*criticizes someone for “wishful thinking” then goes on to provide more wishfully thinking*

You gotta pay the troll toll
---
Wasn't Varian wrynn enslaved and forced to fight in an arena? Kinda hypocritical if you ask me, imo horde has its good and bad and so does alliance.
---
Wow that makes me want to play alliance.
---
The blizzard customizable party frames for SURE! Being able to make them rectangles with class color, showing debuffs, percentange health, move them around etc are amazing! You can make a party profile and raid profile!
---
Do iron grenades stun level 60 opponents?
---
Please don’t think such negative and foul thoughts your grace. Your actions alone would’ve saved us from the disaster that was Season 8.
---
DID YOU HAVE TO BURY HER IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?
---
Fury has always been viable dps.
---
I never said I had a classic guild?
---
Does a class's race really matter? I was planning on playing an Orc or a Tauren Warrior. Does race make any real difference if I am not playing at the absolute highest level?
---
&gt; The problem of easy report hasn't been a problem for years.
---
Can't report anyone when no one plays the game anymore
---

But seriously, it has been the system is dog shit.
---
You are out of your mind, it's gonna be a huge success
---
How big of a bubble does it have to be before it's the fucken ozone layer? Do we have to listen to every zit community and Thorne 99%. This isn't a problem. If anything reject it under the blanket #nochange. If your excuse is "i want to be a dick" then enjoy your ban.
---
Pls just ban this moron already
---
Nah, it'd take people away from world pvp. Rather it like it is.
---
Yes your grace. It was something that was far beyond our control. These foul humans known as D&amp;D (most likely Lannister’s I bet.) Absolutely just took the show and drug it into the ground. I’m sorry what’s happened Bobby B.

You enjoyed running around a pole chasing a druid for 20 minutes?   Fuck me, I wanted to kill myself that shit was so frustrating.
---
This genuinely makes me sad, I was thinking about playing hunter in classic and I might have to change my mind.
---
SEVEN HELLS, NED, I WANT TO HIT SOMEONE!
---
Dude honestly had no idea until now that layering would be eliminated in phase 2, now I seriously can't believe people act like this is a issue and are bitching and moaning this much about it. 
---
Honestly I think this may have also been a little of Blizzard's fault for not spinning the wording on this one a little bit marketing more on why it's a good thing and necessary at launch. 
---
Would very likely put many people off of the initial play that could even lose more eager players that are new, could you seriously imagine beginning to level with literally thousands of other people that just started also?
---
Well, you need primary specced healers.
---
Upvote for great content!
---
Downvote for orientation...
---
Upvote for Classic hype!
---
but as it stands - its not and blizz has stated for the full duration of phase 1 which will be minimum of 2 months. there will be level 60s speedrunners hitting 60 in day 5. We will farm the ever living shit out of those devilsaur.
---
the creation of twinks at a much quicker pace and those who speed level farmed and able to gather quick wealth to twink their 19s will also have a serious headstart into the Rank 14 grind at lower level as opposed to 60s BG.
---
How many times you gonna repost this?
---
wtf is with the hostility?
---
Another class reliant on the MCP farm.
---
You max your dps by weaving the “spell” shots in between your auto shots. If you walk or cast a spell during the wrong part of the shot animation, it’s a massive drop in DPS.
---
r/classicwow and r/2007scape are like long lost brothers.
---
Did you pick New York too? Because, again, there are no WoW servers in New York.
---

---
lol you are literally exactly the annoying, toxic woke guy I was talking about. If you think everyone is a jerk wherever you go the problem is you. I bet you fill up your ignore list because people talked about politics in world chat.
---
Leeway is confirmed correct to vanilla. Per AI wont get fixed. Its an issue with the legion hunters they ported over that they haven’t been able to fix in nearly 3 years.
---
There’s pictures (like the last one) that you literally added in objects into the world.  This was literally impossible on live servers.  You could model change technically even though it was glitchy at best, but *adding* things like trees like you did in the last SS was and still is not possible.
---
Is there another way to enter a dungeon?
---
I'm pretty sure I've only entered instances while my feet are on the ground when I accidentally jumped too early. I find myself deeply disappointed in myself when this happens...but at least I tried.
---
unpopular opinion - I honestly was looking forward too easily reporting people who broke the rules.
---
Taken from [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack\_table](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table) 
---
Here is the order of precedence: 
---
Miss, Dodge, Parry, Glancing Blow, Block, Critical Hit, Crushing Blow, Ordinary Hit
---
If private (pirate) servers will service the needs of the country where official distribution channels will not, the Australian populace have already shown they will take the best product/service available to them. We suggest Germany do the same.
---
everyone knows Stan Marsh has the Sword of a Thousand Truths and not OP.
---
like what because after doing 5 fresh servers on the priv scene, I didn't really seen none. It was frustrating but it was also an experience and created more social interactions. It's a different meta
---
You should find s therapist. That’s the only concern you need rn
---
You did look at your title :)
---
Because this wasn’t done on live servers and he probably proved that.
---
Your average 200 pound person burns 150 calories per mile of running. If you eat one chic fil a sandwich, that’s 3 miles of running.
---
That's true, which is why you're not supposed to do that. Instead, a lot of people just do IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros). As long as your carbs, protein, and fats limits are reached daily (+ calories), then you're doing it. A mix of healthy and cheating here and there tends to  stick a lot more than immediately going full health-nut.
---
I levelled my priest holy back in vanilla.  No spirit tap.  No wand spec.  It was slow but I wasn't in a hurry.  I spent a lot of time in groups either questing with friends or running instances.  I really enjoyed the compliments I got for being such a great healer.  I had one group who had such confidence in me I was running SM-Cath at level 32 after doing the rest because they wanted to get it done.  I always saw that as one of my proudest achievements.   I think I was the only one to die, but I had Spirit of Redemption so everyone else lived.  
---
When I see now that priests are one of the fastest levelling specs I initially didn't believe it.  But I really did it the hard way.  It might not be my favourite play style but I think if I levelled a priest again now it would be shadow and know that I have the skills to still heal instances even if I don't have the talents to make it easier.
---
We don't live in some kind of age where regular and frequent access to the internet is some kind of rarity.
---
Most people who know about Classic and plan on playing it probably have regular access to the internet and seek out information about it.
---
Kids or adults aren't just stumbling on to Classic WoW news going "Oh! What is this! Think I'll sub and play this without knowing anything about anything!". That just doesn't happen.
---
I guarantee you, with a very high level of certaintyz that a vast majority of people going in to classic have either played it before, or at the very least are aware of Warrior being annoying to level.
---
Jani mods think they are the arbiters of whats right and wrong to talk about but fail to realize if a post doesn't get upvoted almost no one sees it anyways. They like to pretend their job is more important than it really is and in reality they just make everyone's experience way worse than it would be if they didnt moderate as much
---
I played holy pally and that definitely made me laugh. Made me remember all the good times
---
Can you even use the official forums without an active subscription these days?
---
Used it on a 39 Twink and tbh not having mortal strike really sucks
---
Imagine trusting a company like Activision Blizzard after the millionth time they've fucked over their customers.
---
I remember way back in the day hunter pets had this weird thing where both the pet and enemy would keep trying to get behind each other, so they would do this little dance around... right into other mobs.
---
More like Human corruption let a Black Dragon capture and almost kill him, some Crimson Ring Orc that runs illegal gladiator matches found him, trained him, and wasn't even mad when he refused to fight for entertainment.
---
Then he joined the fights when his friend Valeera was up against a tough match. Eventually he took him to Thunder Bluff and helped him discover his past, leading to his return to Stormwind and the ousting of Onyxia.
---
If it weren't for some bad Orcs, your king would never have survived. If it weren't for the Horde, he never would have returned.
---
I am gonna sound very principal now; but I think it should be removed because it lessens player interaction like a lfg or a group finder (not teleporter) does, obviously far from at the same level, but a little.
---
&gt;TK
---
i tanked the opening packs in tk as a full heroic geared prot paladin. runs for the t5 shoulders were a pretty common pug where most were in blues and kara gear.   
---
i'd say your tanks were poorly itemized (didn't have avoidance cap) or your cc was lacking.   
---
tbc badge gear/ new dungeon gear pretty much did make kara obsolete same as dm in vanilla i guess. i think those catch ups were okay because they didn't shove you into the absolute end game it was closer to 'this content is kind of dying now after a year and half heres a step up, wrath went over board though, i skipped ulduar quit after naxx 25 came back did icc 10 and quit again, gearscore was probably the single most instantly repulsive thing i've ever seen in the game.
---
It would probably help with the mod overwork if they banned the blatant trolls with dozens of negative posts.
---
If you're in the same guild you will be in the same layer the whole time.

Build your character along it. While its looked down upon its hardly banned and being a tinkering night elf druid would give you a good reason for leaving Teldrassil.
---
If you are going to complain about gnomes(and god knows im not a fan of them) you gotta complain about the whole worldbuilding overall. As gnomes with high tech was part of the original idea of azeroth. As I said before, gyrocopters and submarines and demolition teams were their contribution to the war effort in wc2.
---
I do not yet, what guild are you planning on joining?
---
You can tame any tame-able beast in beta as long as the color of the level is yellow, green, or grey. Mobs that are 2 levels above you are still yellow.

Model changing worked by changing a model in the game world with another model from the game, and had a ton of applications in the exploration community.

what would be the best race to play on the Horde for a warrior. Does it match up against the Human Warrior?

I do. it's jarring as shit. With all of those things how does anyone do anything? Tech revolutionized the world for a reason, it shouldn't be any different even in a fantasy world.

I think you are right.  Makes sense.

---
It's only enough to matter if your guild decides it's a deal-breaker for them.
---
I'm having trouble finding great articles telling me to invest money with leveraged funds.
---
Am I describing razorgore? I don't even remember. All I know is this SS was taken farther in somewhere.. sorry lol
---
They lost 8% of the total wow player base this expansion. Wow will die if blizz keeps fucking around.
---
Nobody will be buying crafting materials at launch. If you go herbalism, you're better off making a bank alt and just putting all the herbs there for a few months until prices pick up.
---
Even if you take both of those professions, it's likely you'll have to farm quite a bit pre-40 to have the money for your mount right at 40 unless you get some great AH profits. Leather is typically just vendored while leveling at low levels due to the market being totally flooded.   
---
However I wouldn't recommend stressing about having a mount right at 40. From 40-44 the value of drops skyrockets immensely. As a warrior who trains the majority of his dps and tanking abilities, I tend to get my mount around 43-44 in Tanaris or Feralas without deviating from questing/leveling.
---
I think Orc is the go-to for Horde, but I could be mistaken
---
Are you sure you play wow?
---
Okay
---
I live in NZ and played on a Central US server in vanilla.  During raids I regularly had ping levels of 300-500+.  For many fights I spent it with the camera panned around to look a the wall whilst I watched health bars (I played a priest).  Pre-casting (down ranked) big heals was my friend.  I got pleasure in knowing my ping well enough that I could time things right for the heal to land at the right time.  
---
By the time I stopped playing in Wrath I might still have been watching health bars, but I could keep half an eye on the rest of the fight as both my ping and computer were significantly better.  I don't think there will be any significant issues with Classic.
---
I want to give you props for the job you do around here. It takes a lot of dedication to volunteer for something like this and most people simply wouldn't be interested. It's honestly commendable that you commit yourself so heavily even though you're absolutely awful at it. It's not easy to show up and continue to do things you're terrible at and I just want you to know I admire the dedication.
---

Would be a cool addition of Chronormu...possibly that may be part of the quest that no one has ever done.
---
Pro Tip: Drinking copious amounts of alcohol makes enemies weaker! Try it for yourself and see!
---
my favorite battle setup still was the anime basement with moldy walls and carves in the cement "GET OUT"
---
Something to consider... There are so many bugs reported and unresolved right now that it's not likely adding more players is going to address this.
---
In other words, at this point adding more players isn't going to fix anything, it will just overwhelm the current team who is already behind on addressing things reported in very early beta.
---
Lol manual crowd pummeler only has 3 charges youd need atleast 10 for most raids... not the biggest exploit...
---
This actually gave me a cool idea:  
---
Scaling raids from expansions back to level 60 and the gear ofc.  Tbc and wotlk had some really cool fights
---
That's a horrible example. Classics launch will have an incredible amount of players. Blizz may screw a lot of things up, but if they are estimating 3-10 layers per server with 3k each, thats a shit ton of players. That's way, way, way too many.
---
Race can make a big difference depending on class and whether its PvP or PvE. PvP tends to be more noticeable.
---
As for Orc Vs Tauren Warrior. Orc tends to be better all around. Axe spec is really good for PvE DPS and Stun resistance is tops in PvP. Blood Fury also helps Orc for PvE DPS. Tauren Warrior is ok for tanking, but is actually only a marginal amount of health that you gain over Orcs. War Stomp is ok in PvP, but for a long list of reasons, stun resist is better.
---
Its a small, but noticeable difference for PvE DPS and fairly noticeable for PvP.
---
i prefer the nicklet
---
The perfect game would be them taking my original world of Warcraft cd, and using every system from back then the same way. Not an 8.1 client that they will put a wow token in after a month with the horse shit excuse “preventing gold selling” .  They will 1000 percent fuck up classic. They already has the game as close to perfect as possible. I found the perfect game back in classic 1.9.
---
One of them is being entirely wasted so that's obviously not going well.
---
We're already planning this.

Peoples posts are annoying. They also typically bypass all other places already in the sub to talk about said topic

Then why are you even here?
---
This
---
Yes, level doesnt matter, it just does less damage than Thorium Grenades, but much much cheaper.
---
What a range,
---
Few weeks to 3+ months.
---
The all problem with that as an act of aggression is that the Orcs had no idea that the trees were sacred to the elves. They were simply forest and rather than the elves attempting diplomacy with the (mostly demon free) Orcs (although wouldn't have worked with Grom), just began slaughtering the Orcs without quarter. So what do they Orcs do? They defend themselves and find a way to stop the attacks by drinking demon blood and killing Cenarius (which was admittedly *not* a good idea).
---
Sylvanas is a whole new cookie, and everyone who isn't a major fan of her or doesn't detest the Alliance doesn't like her.
---
Do I need to google it for you? If you gave me enough cash to put down 20% on a home, I still wouldn't do it. That money would go into the markets where the average annual rate of return is double the interest rates being offered on mortgages these days.   
---
There is also an argument to be made that it is more responsible to put less money down, than to use your entire cash reserves on putting down 20% and not have an emergency fund of some kind to go with your risky home purchase.   
---
So really you're telling someone to save 20% plus an emergency fund, and be able to budget for for more expensive 15 year mortgage when all of that cash would make more money in other investments because, to reiterate, rates are so low that it makes no sense for most younger buyers. I'm sure there are scenarios where the overly prudent method you described is best, but it's not realistic or even necessary for most.
---
Again, it was on live...  I don't understand what's so hard to believe. Exploration videos from vanilla does so much more crazy stuff on live than my screens. 
---
The censoring is mostly force of habit from back then. Would you be satisfied if I posted some uncensored screens when I get back to my computer?
---
A big fat phony!
---
Tauren hunter, herbalist/skinner. Taming pink tallstrider, Mazzranache at level 10. It just feels so immersive foraging and hunting in the forests of Azeroth with my favourite pet all throughout slowly leveling to 60.
---
If you are PVPing you will want to do an Orc the Hardiness buff that gives you 25% stun resist is so good. If you PVE it is less noticeable but you could do Tauren warrior as it gives you a larger hit box and the increased stamina is always good for tanking.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
thank god
---
Just report me when you see me. Bet nothing happens to me. Thing is, i bet nothing happens to you either.  Only people who have reason to fear easy reports is people who have no place in any community.

That is assuming the leaf won't be there though.  Do we know that for sure?  What makes you think it won't be there?

random fun fact.

michael phelps apparently eat 12k calories a day while training.
---
Getting massive amounts of people to subscribe in order to get into a beta you don’t intend to invite them to. Allowing only subs to reserve and realm pick early. Getting free publicity using streamers to get more people to sub under the presumption that they will get into beta. Making it on the 8.0 client so they can drop a cash shop in the game since they never removed those files that should be useless in classic wow. You don’t see how it’s a cash grab because you’re Stevie Wonder.
---
Lol or they could just not offer this.
---
wtf were you selling?   Devilsaur gear?
---
that's what happened to Stalvan
---
I thought Rag wasn’t even in the game at launch? I thought the only raid was UBRS?
---
 I thought people said that xbow from LBRS was BIS.  Is this just BIS for dwarves?
---
I'm holding out for an all-treehugger guild.
---
Haha yep, people have been using the [For the Children!] achievement HORRENDOUSLY INNAPROPRIATELY since Wrath, so I'm kinda glad this weapon wont exist personally
---
And when I say slowly I mean *FUCKING* slowly!
---
Now that you mention it I think think I've ever walked into one of those things...
---
run back to Flame Crest and get milked :)
---
It would work just as well. You would face the same 2-3 combos all the time will.
---
Not one plays the most popular MMORPG in the world? Guess they should just cancel wow all together. There is no point in making wow classic if no one plays........ o wait..... i forgot millions of people still play this game every day and it has been the most popular MMORPG sense the day it launched.
---
You're right, it's not possible to add things using model changing (as far as I know). I didn't actually add things though. What I did was change a lot of small stuff to trees, like rocks, wisps of grass etc. That's why it seems like there are more trees than usual.
---
There wasn't one before.  I played so much WSG hardcore 10man High Warlord groups.  I was an offcarrier (not prim carrier) but as both the carrier and the one hunting them down.  There was no stupid flag indicator.
---
I had to run around with Human Tracking or Beast tracking (for the druids).  To find their hidden carriers.
---
Vir'jin
---
A large portion of the negativity aimed at classic Wow is handwringing over things that the community just doesn’t have enough information about that are actively being looked at (*looking at you layering*)by Blizzard as evidenced by the blind ST they just had. 
---
I expect to see things cool off after launch.
---
Leadership is a major thing to consider. The Horde is pretty much a massive group led by one leader while the Alliance is several groups with several leaders and (often) one supreme leader. 
---
The Horde has gone through complete overhauls. The First Horde disbanded after WC2, and Thrall's Horde was formed at the start of WC3. The atrocities began with Garrosh's rise to power and formation of his True Horde. The Horde is figuratively broken apart and that (eventually) leads to Sylvanas' Horde, which is pretty bad and pretty much only radical Orcs, Forsaken, and maybe some Goblins agree with her.
---
 In comparison, all that has happened to the Alliance since WC3 is the loss of High Elves, allies in the Night Elves, Draenei, etc., and a shift in supreme power from Terenas to Anduin/Bolvar to Varian and to Anduin/Greymane.
---
We need to unionize. No one log in for a week. Then we all will reap the rewards.
---
If I wanted vanilla-ish I would have gone to a private server.
---
As a hunter it was a fun spot to use tracking.  Human for most classes, beast for druids.
---
yeah but as nature damage, not as a rebuff that needed removal
---
At firsr they werent gonna do zandalari paladin but then they did. It was possiblr cuz voljin had died

 I don't want to be around this.
---
4 Hordes: First Horde with Blackhand, Gul'dan, and Doomhammer. Thrall's Horde with Thrall. True Horde with Garrosh. New Horde with Vol'jin and later Sylvanas. The Horde that Thrall led was far and away completely different and focused on so many other values than the First, True, and New Hordes (especially with Sylvanas and Garrosh).
---
Troll is best if you can get yourself tf
---
I'm more upset that they went about locking all the posts about the news on the EU servers because apparently it's racist that we don't want to play with each other.
---
I think it might be Thunderfury!
---
Still doing it.

Damn. Human rogue was my main back in vanilla and youre giving me some serious inspo right now
---
She's a dude, bro.

I just don't see why you care that much that 1 in 1000 people escape a stupid gank.   Who gives a fuck.  This isn't a big deal.
---
Nothing, I’m not worried about a 13 year old stealing my girl.
---
You find a new healer.
---
U don’t know what an exploit is... Kevin Jordan would laugh at u
---
Test this on the beta. Have one warrior chase somebody and attack them. I guarantee you that the leeway won't be as consistent as it is if the target being attacked is running in place.
---
Treants yes. Trees, no.
---
They fucked up in cata with raid finder and the sub numbers show they have fucked up year after year worse and worse. How can they bring back millions more when they’re already down millions from the long lasting line of fuckups. The only way for them to not fuck up is for classic to be classic and they already added layering.
---
Whenever I read these types of comments it screams someone who has never actually dealt with a large group of people in a social environment.
---
Right click reporting punishes people who would state something that someone doesn't want to hear. Being blunt caters to making stupid people feel "virtuos" and "justified" in reporting something. Classic wow involves so much more talking and social interaction then any other point in its lifespan. I am probably a likely person to be right click reported cause I don't like saying "GOOD 4 U, WE ARE ALL DOING SO GOOD, EVERYONE GETS A GOLDEN STAR"
---
Yeah, you definitely get Fireblast. The efficiency is high for an instant, and it's just too useful to pass up.
---
If you're questing as Frost, especially on a PvE server, you can ignore so many spells until later levels when you have a mount.
---
Arcane Missiles, Dampen Magic, Flamestrike, Amplify Magic, Blizzard, Fire Ward, Frost Ward, Scorch, Fireball after lvl 18/24(?), Frost Nova after rank 1. All these can be easily ignored until you've gotten the gold for your mount. 
---
I'd consider buying Flamestrike after getting 5/5 Shatter though for the double crits in situations where you can AoE to save time.

What's to stop a community from hosting 3v3 events in the Gurubashi arena, locking it down with a raid or so and rewarding some amount of gold to the winner?

Bo basically 40-60 beta testing is for after release?
---
It’s a hunter weapon
---
They don't know his exact position.  It's clear in the chatter.  The reason he sees their flag carrier is because they're in vision of his team.
---
They only talk about "last time he was X"  and they know he's exploiting because he has done this before and it wasn't an uncommon thing.
---
If you listen to them early on in the chat they don't know his where abouts... That's why they're talking about "LAST TIME WE SAW HIM HE WENT X"
---
..and warriors.
---
Just uninstall it, it will go away since you dont actually have beta access, just have it installed!
---
Problem solved!

Delta Airlines sold 50 plane tickets.  According to their metrics 50 people were passengers on that plane.  Very interesting.

I'm missing something. What's wrong with the name? It's a giant razor blade and it's called the nicker. It's good for a sensible chuckle at best. Did they remove the razor blade appearance?

So does shamas. And Paladins.

Nicker sounds like the nword. It was spammed conststly the nicker stole my bike or ban the nicker
---
I book marked [zUI](https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI) to look at whenever I get access.
---
The AV weekend followed by layering decimated the population. Beta is absolutely dying/dead if you look back from jun 9 to now.
---
They won't have enough beta testers for instance content at 50/60 without template chars at this rate. Layering made it look dead which made it die for real. It's in an extremely hyper aggressive mode since AV to maximize test data. 
---
I understand why, but they're gonna lose all their volunteer testers. It's already too late for most new invites to 1-60 if they send out invites. They really need to kill layering.
---
I accidentally didn't into the portal.
---
Don't worry about that guy.  He's in several threads spewing false information.  He thinks WSG flag carriers were shown on the map in vanilla when out of vision...

Do you know if the stun shares diminishing returns with rogue stuns?
---
DM has an arena too, right?

100% this, right at the time of blizzcon this subreddit turned into mostly worthless memes. I guess thats what happens when you go mainstream, just a bunch of people upvoting "funny" posts that make discussion posts less attention

In retail if you get auto muted from right click reports, you can still play the game.

In classic you won't be able to find a group for anything lol

People like you pretend "trump bad" or "hillary go to jail" is a crime to say.  Your opinion won't get you banned. Just don't be a toxic asshole.
---
I don't think there are any kids in the beta.
---
I did not expect to see such enthusiastic Shaman representation!  It’s good to see!
---
Quote me on it. Come back to this in 3 months post launch, and eat it. You think phase 2, a smoothing transition phase to allow the community to experience MC free of superior DM loot is coming out anything earlier than 3 months? 
---
Ya, Blizzard is launching phase 2 before a MAJORITY of the community is 60. They certainly wasted their time creating a phase 2 for that. Use your brain.
---
Let's hope they'll fix it. The current hunter sounds are the worst. It feels like playing a mage.
---
A Cash Grab is when a company releases an unfinished/poor quality product and then runs away with the money, none of those things point into that direction, yeah its obvious how they want to make money with the beta by giving it only to subscribers and its obvious what they're trying to do by inviting streamers like Pokimane or Destiny who have never played wow into the beta but that still doesnt mean the game will be a cash grab, it wont affect the quality of the game at all, it might be scummy but, again, who cares?
---
The cash shop is just fear mongering.
---
Can prob run the required mile before this finishes.
---
Stop copy pasting this as a reply to the guy who literally said this already.  He's specifying how it works in Vanilla.
---
There are no kids in the beta from what I see
---
You must have been very bad at pvp then.  Because pets may not have been perfect but they were crucial in pvp.
---
No, it wouldn't. I just want to pretend the lore after wrath never happened.
---
There must always be balance to the force.
---
all stuns share the same DR
---
You mirin' brah
---
If I got the entire group to report you it would, because the system doesn't care and is highly subjective
---
$75 a month for wow...have fun with that.
---
Some of it was luck I think, like GM Island. Although in my experience, the European GMs didn't really care about people exploring.
---
Changing models is not detectable server side unless you did something stupid with it, as far as I know. Collision was evaluated client side based on the current model, so people changing barriers in battlegrounds were more susceptible to bans I believe.
---
Also the spiders drop loot, which let's you cure the poison....
---
r/woosh
---
Classic =/= retail and news flash it's not the most popular MMO anymore. Also that was really quick for you to forger what sarcasm is
---
That's actually a really cool concept, love it!
---
You can also be screwed if your assassin going for the title in warmode of all the opposite right click you, you get dc'd and a mute placed on you.
---
Who said he was my king? I play both and like both equally. Lol and youre thinking of the orc rehgar. I mean same for horde if it werent for the racist leader in durnholde who taught thrall there wouldnt even be a horde.
---
What wpvp?  Running around ganking some lowbies trying to farm?
---
That sounds like a dream! I forgot about Mazzranache! The nostalgia!
---
I paid an IRL friend of mine $50 to front me the gold to buy my level 40 mount.
---
Can we not say nagger in game either?
---
This is in-game: https://imgur.com/qruD5TK
---
This website tells me 200+ms for LA servers.
---
Only people i have personally seen been silenced are people trying to get silenced and racist assholes throwing around the N word. Calling someone a butthole won't get you banned unless you call everyone you meet an a hole. If you think literally everyone is a a hole, maybe its you that is in fact the a hole.
---
Hopefully she leads us into WoW 2.0 and they do a new, different expansion besides BC.
---
Well it’s more “even if you murder civilians they aren’t actually dead” so why not advance science?
---
Yes, a rare spawn spawns in there sometimes.   It's not very big iirc though.
---
[Back Door Job] [For The Children!]
---
Except coordinating with the opposing faction is against TOS.
---
If I'm wrong what is the most popular mmorpg right now?
---
I get that. And I think it would have been beneficial to do more staged types of tests like you suggested, template characters. I do not really see anything wrong with that. From a game development perspective that makes sense as well. Limits the variables and forces the players to test exactly what you wanted them to. 
---
I am also willing to bet that a lot of people, myself included, would not want to get burnt out on a Beta with no long term reward. Things are being tested. Layering has been shown to be a serious issue. Thank god we had the Beta to figure that out!
---
That's amazing. I've got too many try hards that want to go human warrior/rogue with my guild. Plus I'm a friend of a friend so can't really convince them to go full gnome/dwarf.
---
Yeah I plan on doing treadmill desk + adding in pull up bar workouts, mixed push up workouts, mixed p90x ab ripper workouts throughout my sessions. Should stay pretty solid 👌
---
There was tons of World pvp. People get ganked, they have their guild come, then the other persons guild comes, huge wpvp fight. Happens all the time, or happened.
---
what is tf?
---
It isn't how it worked. I played a mage all through vanilla. You could not just run through the entire blizzard without being slowed. If you were unlucky, something might get as far as halfway before being slowed. Never would 100% runspeed get something all the way to the other side.
---
I hate this stupid fake spell-batching bullshit. Why would you put artificial lag in a game?
---
Laugh because he didn’t get Tunic of Westfall as an Alliance Rogue.
---
well too be fair. The explination could be that 
---
1. Due to the constant wars, there is a constant resource deficientcy reducing the amount of high build cost and high maintence cost things are built. Why build a steamtank that takes a whole factory 2 months to build and a full 15 people to maintenence it when its in the field. When you could instead build 20 ballistas and man them all with the same resources. 
---
2. Between wc2 and WoW classic has been about 20-30 years. Not enough time to teach everyone how to use or build the tech. Plus with gnomernon as fucked up as it was, the gnomes havent had the oppertunity to train other races in their technology. or minimallly so. 
---
3. Tech isnt high priority. Gyrocopters are great and all, but any mage,shaman, warlock(maybe) can take them down super easy. Siege tanks can be destroyed by any middle level spellcaster, and artillery can just be replicated by mages. I mean, mages are one man artillery pieces back in wc2. More mobile, cheaper, more survivable, more versitile and equal if not more damage than most siege weapons. This one kinda is extension of my first point.
---
So while tech is impressive and all. Magic figuratively and sometimes literally blows it away. Magic causes any technological advances to stagnate. 
---
Why create new fertilizers when the local druids can just help your crops. Why design a cannon that can self destruct and kill a crew, when a wizard can just cast fireball(wc2 version or dnd version). Why create flying machines when a mage can just enchant a flying carpet. Why build a car when you can just enchant horseshoes to make your horse go faster. You get my point, anything that technology can do, so can magic. So there is no/minimal motivation to ever advance technology on a societal level.
---
Played vanilla wow since beta.  That never happened.
---
I'm sorry that's a lot to you, but that's not the point of this post.
---
Thousand needles. It was where I started to really understand the game. I grinded a ton on the centaurs and basilisks there on my pally
---
Thankfully Transmog doesn't exist so we can actually see people's gear now
---
Thunderfury
---
I literally have zero idea what that means, but to be stating that while also trying to deny what i'm saying is being very ignorant of the areas that are trying to use this the most. MOBA'S are the highest games where this is used, HOTS, Dota, League of legends, they are all known for being highly toxic.
---
The problem with automation of reporting is it doesn't matter if your opinion has truth to it, your total sum of actions no matter what will be averaged by the thought level of the community. If the general community believes in something and you are out of touch, you are more likely to get reported.
---
If this still doesn't make sense I have a much MUCH better example however it is only a comparison so less pure in a sense of actual representation. Automated report system works very similar to reddit thumbs up thumbs down. Those who say what the reddit thread want to hear get thumbed up, those who don't generally get ignored until you tick someone off then you get thumbed down. AKA, automated reporting leads to conforming
---
Temporarily suspend all Layering until out of combat.
---
Simple.
---
Have you ever heard of someone telling their guild to report a person and also seeing them banned? That doesn't happen.
---
He just happens to have a friend in exactly the same place playing on another layer? Why would they not just group up and 2v1 the person in the first place? If anything the layering outcome is the better one because at least the victim gets a fair 1v1 instead of being gangbanged from the start.
---
Yea but not in 82 minutes, is what they're saying. Probably like double that lol
---
I also have, and it happened pretty often for me. I could force it to happen almost daily if I wanted -- go out, find someone or a group of people and start a fight. They get help, I get help, etc etc etc
---
When leveling I vendored half of my crafts and disenchanted the other half, not going into specifics or I'll ruin my own money maker if the servers are really that limited.
---
At maxlvl Hide of the wild will be your biggest profit maker I made atleast one every day for 15g fee and it was a late stage into the game. Once you start making them yourselves with alts and AH sniping you'll be making bank. Feral druid gear will be highly tipped as well since not many will grind the various reps for a shitty recipe but I did because I had enchanting as well. (thorium brotherhood/those furbolgs in felwood).
---
I mean, the potential solutions are painfully obvious. You ask as if there's no way to prevent these problems.
---
- Don't allow layer changing during combat
---
- Add a 20 second "cast time" to change
---
- Require being in an inn or city to change
---
Yes. I unfortunately decided Balance was a cool spec in 2005 and the best way to level was being a ghetto Enhancement Shaman.
---
I mean it's not that you cant, it's just not preferable to have an item that shouldnt be read out loud. That being said, I wouldnt recommend tossing "nagger" in chat either. Not sure how itll work in Classic, but depending on the context you're asking for a 24h mute in Retail

what makes the human warrior so much better at tanking than other races?
---
Rolling ignites and cordinating, frost is basic.
---
I simply asked where you heard it
---
My post was downvoted to zero and your comment was upvoted. Just wanted to know if I did something wrong? 
---
I only just saw Classic listed under "Live" today . I didn't mean to upset anyone.
---
&gt;it's literally what we've been asking for.
---
Yeah, thanks idiot.
---
This is a really good rotation! An alternative I used: 
---
Cheap Shot -&gt; Backstab -&gt; Sprint+Vanish (Sprint is activated to avoid any AoE Abilities/Shouts that would bring you out of Stealth and will confuse lesser skilled opponents)  
---
Sap (Lock the target in place and out of combat, when its safe to do so) -&gt; Cold Blood  
---
Cheap Shot -&gt; 5 Combo Evisc -&gt; Blind -&gt; Restealth out of Combat  
---
Preparation -&gt; Sap -&gt; Repeat from above
---
The benefit to this is that if they panic and choose to trinket the first cheap shot, your plan is still to sprint + vanish anyway. If they choose to trinket either saps or the blind, they'll need to do it quickly enough that you aren't already stealthed and out of combat. 
---
Synetic's example is great though! The fun of a Rogue is locking your opponent out of the entire fight, which can be done multiple ways.. it's just not always so easy to execute under pressure :)
---
when he opens the map at 2:29 he sees himself/the alliance flag. the horde flag doesn't show up anywhere
---
If being mad is pointing out someones laziness, then by all means consider me ruffled.
---
Sword specialization. The extra hit on swords is insane, its a pretty large dps boost and in turn a larger threat boost. Human warriors with tf are just stupid.
---
It wasn't this significant. Anyone who says this is working as intended is a fucking liar who stands to gain from the current shitshow state of spell-batching and melee leeway.
---
The thing is that ranged weapons "reload" in the background, no matter what else you're doing.
---
Hunter's rotation is based around Aimed Shot, which has 3 second cast time and 6 second cooldown.
---
So you fire your weapon normally, then immediatelly start casting Aimed Shot, and by the time the cast time is finished(3 seconds later) your weapon has already "reloaded" and can be fired normally again. This is also why Hunters gravitate towards slow firing, hard hitting weapons with Speed of 3 or more.
---
Is that difficult? I never seriously played a Hunter, but it can't imagine anything hard about it, especially with reload times add-on. Oh and there's no fucking way your DPS would be "1/5 of what it should be" if you fumble with the timing, that's just straight up bullshit, I'm calling it out.
---
Didnt you read what he just said?
---
Oh yeah, there's no way in hell that items getting into classic in its original form.
---
With the way things are now, all it would take is one joke on one server and people would flip out that somehow Blizzard didn't think 'Oh. Ooooooooh.' and somehow let it through a second time a decade and a half later.
---
Potential moonkins out there, listen to this person; they speak the truth.
---
Always use your pet to pull and give them a chance to get some agro. Even with their agro ability, mobs will sometimes ignore them. Dots are good, but mixing shadow bolts in with them can sometimes up your agro and cause the mob to attack you. As a lock, it's not about burning down your target as fast as you can, gotta take it slow and stay safe.
---
Hate the break it to you, but regardless of classic, the retail lore will be the lore for Warcraft. This idea that a simulation is being ran, is actually your best bet at getting alternate lore. They won’t drop a 15 year game’s plot because some people don’t like where it went.
---
How can I upvote this twice?
---
I always thought if a teammate had vision of the enemy flag carrier, you could see it on the map. Was that ever the case?
---
I've also found that many lock players are deviants themselves. They have unique and weird interests, they have odd careers and music tastes. The stereotypical nerd doesn't play a warlock, the hardcore 40k fan who can quote the Codex Astartes by heart does. I think how the people of Azeroth (at least on Alliance side) disapproves of warlocks resonates with their own lives. I come from a long line of social workers, teachers and government employees, but I'm studying nuclear physics, in a country where nuclear power is banned. I'm not saying every warlock is like that, but as a warlock class leader for 3 years I've spoken with quite a few and they all are in very unique situations. I've also found warlock players to be the best at the game. They learn stuff fast and they rarely make mistakes even with such a threat delicate class.
---
nice
---
Layers once beat me up at school and took my lunch money
---
Only mongoloids thought there was 10,000 testers or some stupid shit like that.
---
Wuhhh? You most be on crack. From my experience the horde is almost entirely just screeching 12 year olds.
---
Iconic getup. Perition's is the best looking dagger in the entire game and I don't care what anyone says boobshoulders looked awesome.
---
Isn't devilsaur and hide of the wild 2 different specializations of LW?
---
They probably stopped after seeing 1000000 bug reports on innane shit.
---
Lol I'm pretty sure it's just shit stirring from both sides, as you can probably tell I'm Horde
---
Whatre peoples thoughts on professions trinkits and what class uses them for phase 1, preraid? What other trinkits are good for pve/pvp?
---
i.e. smoking heart of the mountain being good for moonkin/feral tanks or philosophers stones.
---
Trolls and Gnomes. Basically everything wrong with Azeroth. Can't we deport them to Draenar?
---
do roids and die that's your fault man
---
Especially when combined with links to raid boss spells, such as [Pounding].
---
You don't use the words "pulling" and "LOL" when simply asking something.
---
Layering is dogshit. The only reason he says who cares is because being able to escape from world pvp gives him a hard on. Alot of people care. And god forbid that it ticks alot of people off of playing classic = less views
---
What was wrong with the format blizzard had?
---
So there's only a couple thousand people in the beta, or so?
---
Yeah but that’s literally only one boss. Most of the time you can get away with 3, maybe 2 and a Druid.
---
Well a walk can outdo a soda maybe depending on the distance and intensity. But eating a whole cake on top of your calorie limit is going to take about 4-5 separate walks of good intensity/distance.
---
Another PB/J sandwich is probably a walk and a half if you do a decent walk.
---
Yea!
---
I never thought it was going to be a direct copy, but can you ELI5 why it’s not that simple? As somebody pretty ignorant on the subject I would’ve assumed they could’ve just booted up a (much) earlier build?
---
Eh, priest is probably a better feeling than druid for that.
---
I just don't understand what you're trying to do. If it's gold you're after, you can solo trib runs as a hunter once phase 2 hits assuming it isn't nerfed, for not only more gold but far less hassle than trying to play 5 toons at once. The fact that your comp includes 3 mages (so $45 a month to level/play 3 of the same class) tells me you're not doing this for class variety in a raid environment depending on guild need any given raid night.
---
Is playing this game solo and guildless your end goal?
---
Anyway some of the sandfury mobs in ZF apply a poison, in case that is one of the dungeons you plan to be doing.
---
2s we’re constantly healer and warrior and priest-mage-rogue was strong af in 3s but it was still fun
---
Patiently wait with my healer at the graveyard because I'm dead too. :|
---
I mean, they have TWO MONTHS before launch, that's more than enough time for a multi-billion-dollar game dev to fix some bugs.
---
What's the diminishing return rate on stuns? I plan to do a mace rogue and was wondering if iron grenades are worth my time in my rotation if I lose stun time compared to cast time
---
Does every conversation you have lead to someone thinking you are out of touch? If so, maybe you should learn to have conversations that aren't political. If the only conversations you are capable of having are political or otherwise triggering maybe you should try not trying to force your world view on everyone you meet in game.
---
Exactly.
---
*"Lets argue for something that's not working as intended because it benefits my chosen class"* 
---
That's what's happening in this thread.
---
I played a mage through all of vanilla. This shit is broken. Anyone who tries to claim otherwise, e.g. turdas, can go fuck themselves.
---
You better be, thats how they getcha... or i should say her.
---
would prefer on time as i've taken a week off for it
---
Ion also said Phase 1 would last 2 months.
---
The players don’t need to be near each other afaik
---
This is mostly true, exercise of some small amount and proper nutrition can speed up weight loss compared to just calories in/out. Getting your metabolism moving and other things really can impact your weight loss. 
---
Also, doing some minor strength training even just a wee bit is good to keep your body from eating muscle instead of fat.
---
A light exercise of mainly weights and a little dieting can go well. If you really want give it some extra loss then add a bit of cardio.
---
Good luck trying to ignore half the server, obviously someone would rather sell a low to mid level twink item then wear it. It just makes more sense.
---
Too be fair, your faces of layered post deserved to be deleted.  But so does the instance portal one.
---
Thousands who never played actual vanilla, or spent the last several years on private servers?
---
Weeeeewoooweeeeewoooo!!!!!!! FBI, OPEN UP!!!!!!
---
Is +30ish armour from the leather shoulders better than +3 stamina from the cloth shoulders in WC?
---
I'd laugh because you don't even have BiS Shoulders for twinking
---
Yeah it was pretty loaded question
---
what's awesome is that they can advertise classic on their shitty $250 school laptops 
---
I played classic on mine and the framerate never dropped below 60
---
I hope people are aware that the stress test had some realms that were heavily and aggressively layered, so seeing this was common... and deliberately so. 
---
We really need to wait and see what actually happens come launch. 
---
Also... *its temporary*
---
"Were gonna paint the streets of STV RED with blood!.... TWO COATS"
---
does anyone have a website or excel doc that shows BIS gear for mace rogues as you level?
---
It's not a real problem, so just suck it up and let it go.  Stop whining.   Blizz is trying to keep the game from dying, and you are more worried about missing out on 1 in 1000 ganks, because of layering.
---
Finally. Someone gets the joke.
---
I was joking man. I distinctly remember stepping foot into anywhere of blizzard and instantly being frozen. It IS BROKEN.
---
These aren't the Droids you are looking for
---
Judging by your post and comment history, your premonitions are nothing to take seriously. You seem like a dumb ass, basically.
---
I don't believe the mods even look at the reports. I report stuff all the time And none of it gets deleted.
---
I would probably cry that twinks are unfair  and ruin the game.  despite the fact that there are twinks on my team that help me get wins.
---
it only was for the trailer don't overthink it
---
Best professions for a rogue for leveling? How about overall end game utility?
---
I was thinking of going skinning/mining until 60, then dropping skinning for engineering. But iirc, engineering is a money pit, albeit a fun one. Would herbal/alchemy make more sense? Especially to get mats for blinding and vanishing powders.
---
One concern I have is that it'll take a while to build the in game economy. Everyone will be struggling for gold, so I'm wondering if we're overestimating the value of gathering professions early on.
---
The issue with that is you volunteer for it.   That's entirely your  choice, entirely your effort and time for exactly 0 reward outside of knowing you were a part of it.    
---
It's insane that you allow shitpost after shitpost  of people posting subpar memes about how fun it will be when they come back - naga stole my bike.  oh my god they renamed the nicker.  why no tauren paladins?    
---
But you're shutting down posts of stuff people think is really important and can majorly effect the gameplay.  AKA the Layering "discussion"
---
Saying you know it's a big deal,   then following it up with "the community knows and blizzard knows too"   is like being spat in the eye.    "You think you do, but you dont"    And all the anti classic rhetoric that suddenly flipped to omg its great when it became obvious it would be money printing press and not an ignored flop.    The community demanding changes,  transmog, yadda yadda yadda.   Blizzards entire announcement about layering....   "You think you do, but you dont"
---
Can you see why that holds absolutely 0 value to us and provides absolutely no reassurance.    Quote me on this - We'll be walking into classic riddled full of bugs and literal sharding (its still popping the streamers into different shards based on shard phasing locations - so "layering"  is just "sharding" and is not acting like a "layer" at all)   Months after it goes live.
---
You will contribute to this by censor censor censor censor censor.
---
If an issue is constantly on the front page,  it attracts more attention.   It forces action to be taken because it will be causing a bad image,  people just seeing talk about X and how it's bad.   Then action is taken - and promptly - to resolve the issue in a favourable manner.
---
Censoring it so the threddit is fulled with poppycock like OMG TAUREN PALADIN I MISS  and nothing but positive posts, with everything that can be even remotely seen as negative in any way being censored... then you're being nothing more than an unpaid corporate lackey.  
---
You're doing their work of keeping the narrative on the advertiser / shareholder friendly track while copping the flack that's associated with a customer base getting sick of it's issues falling on deaf ears, being censored to oblivion and as we'll see with classic - blatantly disregarded so the issues carry over well into live.   Remind you of the retail situation?   no? 
---
Things starting to make a little bit more sense now?
---
Yeah that looks like razergore ledge there, awesome picture though man. I loved healing shaman cow all through that back in the vanilla days can’t wait to do it again.
---
Nope, both Tribal LW.
---
As a Hunter on the beta: depends what you want to do. PvP is pretty much off limits, especially dueling/WPvP as there's so many broken things you need to go right to win a 1v1 (mostly pet actually attacking and FD actually working so you can trap). Kiting is also hard at the moment because melee distances seem a bit off (hard to know if this is bugged though or just leeway) and sometimes the first auto-shot after stopping movement is delayed.
---
When I started playing in TBC, I actually thought you had to get hit by one of the falling icicles because of this lag in damage. I played a warlock and noticed the lag in damage when using rain of fire. I still thought it was a cool spell back then lol
---
You’re thinking of Wotlk.  In Wotlk there was a mechanism where you picked your loadout and just hit the drop totem button and you would drop whatever you had set to your loadout.
---
If this shit keeps up, dps warriors are gonna be like 50% of all players...
---
Blizz already said there will be a cooldown on changing
---
I don't jump.
---
I Levitate.
---
I would take the stamina.
---
OMG YOU'RE RIGHT THIS HAS LITERALLY NEVER BEEN BROUGHT UP
---
P'at
---
I was a mage through all vanilla. I spent literally hundreds of hours AoEing shit in every way imaginable.
---
Blizzard did not fucking work like this. The delay on the slow is at least twice what it should be.
---
You're probably right.. It was so long ago and I'm old now lol. Thank you! Same dude, so stoked.
---
/bow

"But despite my opinions, I only remove posts that break our rules. The quickest way to a failed forum is the shut-down of dissenting opinions by people running the circus.

---
This was posted by a mod in the "looking for Classic WoW Moderators" stickied post. And I couldn't agree more. I really wish we were all a bit more friendly towards each other.
---
Neither dim returns or CC were significantly different from TBC.
---
First step back home after a long trip away, HELL YEH!\~
---
Lol dude, reread what I wrote. I'm not suggesting anyone do less. I'm suggesting it's pathetic.
---
Hi not suggesting anyone do less. , I'm dad.
---
In vanilla, Blizzard ticked at set intervals, regardless of when the mob/player entered it.
---
Not true.  His views are tanking lately and he has lost many people by whiteknighting classic instead of adressing glaring issues, like The video above. You can almost call him a classic whiteknight now.
---
Theoretically they could. They have a 1.12 build running in-house. Practically there have been many bugs/exploits patched out over the course of the games life that releasing that build would be like offering up cheats with your newly released MMO. Also server architecture has changed since then, this needs to be accounted for as well. So it's not really feasible to just use the old code. They thankfully could use their new code and adapted the old data to work with it, which is a robuster way of doing things, and probably the only reason we're getting classic at all.
---
Alliance warlocks down with druids pepehands
---
**But how do you feel about layers?**
---
That is one of the most amazing pictures I have seen in this thread.
---
This sub is getting to be pretty much garbo
---
Ok, tell me when to cast multi shot again.
---
It's not at all obvious and the rotation changes depending on your weapon speed.
---
REEEeEeEeE!! Haha but honestly? Fine at starting zones but level 20/30 plus areas it should be removed.
---
Can you not.
---
It could be fun, but it would really only be open to the top raiders on each realm, no one can compete with top raid gear. You also might need to make rules about engi items/resist sets that were very powerful in vanilla.
---
It's all about context.
---
&gt;The AV weekend followed by layering decimated the population.
---
What happened with layering after the AV weekend?
---
Skinning will level with you and provides a good amount of income. 
---
I'd recommend Herbalism if you don't mind grinding out the levels. It's steady income that you can save for the moneypit of Engineering :)
---
I just think it looks better lol, why did you think I chose a nelf rogue instead of Gnome or Dwarf
---
Gotta make rooms for shit meme posts
---
I played Horde most of the time, but I am really looking forward to Ashenvale and Darkshore (including BFD).
---
FFXIV
---
I don’t get it
---
Woah now, I just want to role play as an alcoholic, I don't want to become one in real life too.
---
That would be how it actually worked in vanilla. Even if you got super lucky and entered exactly after a tick had gone off, at most you'd get halfway through before a 2/2 Arctic Reach Blizzard slowed you. No fucking way would you ever get through the entire thing.
---
Damn.  Two good items.
---
The 31 feral and balance talents were also hilariously awful. Balance got Hurricane and feral got cheaper shapeshifting. Feral was barely a functional spec before patch 1.8. It was like playing an arcane mage using Arcane Missiles as your main nuke.
---
I've cleared MC-naxx on a lock, whats your credentials?
---
Once you’re prepared to be third on the dos chart because of your racials (or the appropriate other ranking), it really won’t matter. Particularly on horde.
---
When it does matter, it’s a chance to miss or do reduced damage, and not a big one.
---
How does spell power work? if you're a paladin and you have 1000 spell power and you use [Holy Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20928/holy-shield) do you do 1130 damage?  and when [Blessing of Sanctuary](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20914/blessing-of-sanctuary) if cast on yourself or someone else it does 1035 damage? or is it a different damage value on you vs other friendly targets?  
---
I see under "Effect #2" on spell details for Holy shield it says Value 129 (SP mod 0.05) is that a spell power efficiency thing and you get nowhere near +1000 damage with 1000 spell power?
---
Yeah, I know you were being sarcastic. I was agreeing with you.
---
Just found a screenshot showing you my devilsaur set + crusader on lvl 55 if you had any doubt still. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/gkawq5O.jpg
---
Can't find a screenshot showing gold in my bags but the Devilsaur set ran at 400g on my server and Crusader 100g so it's safe to assume I was making bank, this was my first char on the server so no outside help.
---
Short answer: 
---
You'll need to farm shards at some point.  
---
You can store shards in the bank.
---
If you're spamming Shadowburn off cooldown (instead of as a finisher) you're going to need to farm a lot of shards. 
---
It's not too much of a hassle since you can grab 2-3 low'ish level mobs at a time. 
---
I played Lock from Vanilla through TFT and never really had an issue with a lack of shards. That said, I did farm shards when spamming 30-39 and 40-49 bgs because you'll burn through them somewhat quickly. 
---
At 60 I never really noticed it, grinding 5/10mans you can shard every mob and fill up your bags for BGs / to refill your bank.
---
He wants to multibox, why do you even care?
---
If you're solely looking for money, in a fresh server skinning/herbalism is hard to beat. Mining is fine too, but I prefer Herbalism.   
---
As far what professions a rogue *needs*, once you get to max level, if you feel like changing, engineering is a good one for rogues for sure.
---
Simple version is that it's not all old code. There's quite a bit of new code, working together with old. They have gone through and changed it to work like old vanilla as far as players see it. But it's not just a copy/paste. Lots of things will need to be manually tweaked to work as it did in vanilla. They've done a lot already, but things slip through. This test helps to catch those.
---
It's more complex then that, but that's basically it.
---
Do you have a link?
---
100hp to defuse chest is so good though but i agree tunic is the best.
---
Isn't Blackened Defias better?
---
\*sheep breaks\*
---
WHO DA FUCK WAS THAT?
---
I'd rather kill everyone in style, thank you very much. &gt;_&lt;
---
You are now officially welcomed
---
Some classes come online earlier than others, but by 30 you generally have a good feel of a class and can try out a few different specs.
---
So what we know so far is Blizzard are NOT emailing anyone in regards to being invited to the closed Beta or stress tests. 
---
If Classic WoW has appeared above the WoW play button in a drop down tab. It is one of two things, it's an elapsed stress test invite, or a beta invite (unlikely a beta invite as Blizzard said weeks ago they were 'significantly slowing down inviting players to the closed Beta') .
---
Sure shill. 
---
I really want Blizzard to be lazy and ruin classic. I’m wishing for that. 
---
I’m also wishing for all the background I gave as to why I’m likely correct. 
---
Garbage reply. Blocked.
---
I got second hand embarrassment reading this.
---
I would like to see a druid only raid. I mean, 40 druids vs. Onyxia worked. It would be interesting to see how far they would come.
---
There a very high chance they look at this, I highly doubt they are unaware of that list.
---
Some people have to make every post a fight. I'd hate to meet those types in real life.
---
I like the ability to essentially guarantee myself preraid bis, rare drops, and going to make a serious attempt at grinding the deathcharger mount in strat dead. Likely to just full clear live and dead for orbs &amp; recipe too
---
Nice research!
---
Every spell works differently with spell power. Some get 100% value out of it and some get basically nothing. You really have to look at it on a spell by spell basis.
---
rich bastard
---
I can't wait for the headlines: wow classic failed: layering made the in-game economy collapse
---
And
---
Here's how to farm 1000g/hour jumping layers farming black lotus!!
---
Mage - 1
---
Lock - 2
---
Rogue - 4
---
Hunter - 8
---
Feral -  8
---
Difficulty in achieving max theoretical DPS for your class/spec in a raid setting (warrior higher than rogue because no threat drops). Drop hunter a few pts if you aren't going for absolute 100% percentile DPS and feral is very niche.
---
&gt; phase 2 literally doesn't function with layering
---
&gt; When you could instead build 20 ballistas and man them all with the same resources. 
---
Because it's a tank. It would rip those apart without trying.
---
&gt; Between wc2 and WoW classic has been about 20-30 years
---
There's a reason they were left out of WC3, it's super jarring and really takes away from the theme/aesthetic of the game. It's like if the Terran or Protoss suddenly made a stop in Azeroth.
---
Tech isn't high priority because Blizzard intentionally nerfs it's usefulness for plot convenience. Kind of like how they forgot the Alliance had a floating space ship that could shoot death lasers. An air force is never put into use in WC. Anyone who has air superiority would own a battlefield, magic or no magic. They forget about all the advantages that come from this tech for the sake of plot convenience because Blizzard has notoriously cringey writing. They make tanks able to be beat to death by Orcs with clubs because otherwise the Orcs would never win. It's never written well and makes more inconsistencies in the lore than it does world build
---
It would be a shit show. The thing that made arena work in BC was the addition of resilience. Classic isn't designed to be balanced as far as pvp goes and something like double pom pyro would obliterate people.
---
lol it absolutely does. Get out of your bubble
---
Yeah I played BM in arenas in Cata and I definitely remember my pet following rogues who vanished for a couple seconds.
---
I dont remember if they could attack them and break the stealth, I dont think they could. But you could use it to aim a flare at least.
---
Mobile gaming sure did poison regular gaming
---
Meh no fishing hat no talbar mantle no visible enchants.
---
Ill gladly take him on.
---
Show me someone with a fishing hat enchanted with 100hp and the AGM bubble and im running for my life
---
Chromaggus and Gluth doggies also engrage, iirc.
---
So I haven't been hearing the the streamers or reading the forums has Blizzard been patching this beta test client and providing patch notes? Or is this same beta client released so many weeks ago that only streamers and others got front row access to market this new version of the game to us peasants.
---
Okay cool. I tried clicking play and it says no servers available so I'm assuming it's for stress testing.
---
I also don't have a WoW sub (haven't for a couple months now) and I thought I kept hearing that you have to have an active subscription to be invited or participate this time around.
---
WooooSh BRO HAHA
---
Paladin love, paladin life.
---
No but if I did I could always just downvote you because you hurt my sensitive feelings and don't agree with me.
---
Your completely missing the point, normal conversation isn't sunshine and rainbows, theres disagreement and agreement. People over emphasize on negative actions over positive. How i live, others may disagree and the ability to talk about anything like we are doing right now in a system of automated reporting is near impossible.
---
But nagger has no racial connotation. Can I not say spec? Kite? Puke? All of these are as similar to a racist word as nagger. The whole thing is just absurd and plainly retarded.
---
I believe you are right, sir. Not mention why would the flag holder not be seen on the mini map?
---
Yeah in that case, you seem to have an elapsed stress test invite which is just sitting there to allow you the option of uninstalling it. I know it's a bit confusing (And exciting!)
---
That's correct, I believe to participate you require an active subcrition to WoW.
---
But I don't believe you require one to be invited to either the Closed Beta or Stress Tests, if that makes sense.
---
If anyone has noticed I've made a mistake with this information feel free to clarify.
---
&gt;I'm not surprised that only a small fraction of the beta pop hit level 40 already, as that is definitely how it will be come release with higher levels.
---
Not entirely indicative because as the Beta cap rises and it takes longer to level to the new cap more and more people will simply not be playing it naymore virtue of it being beta. On Live people will have a greater motivation to get to cap because it's live and the initial end game rush hype will drag a good chunk of the population up.
---
Ya man. I'd just afk and level up. The tell myself "it will be better next bracket"
---
Haha did anyone ever do that quest though?
---
As someone who wants to play a Hunter, I'd prefer if more bugs were fixed first given that the class is a bit of a mess. At this point I've been waiting so long to play I wouldn't mind putting off a little longer even.
---
Bert saytre
---
Fear was significantly changed to break. Blind was removed from prep. Stuns are on the same DR (maybe kidney or cheap are not),  Trinkets 2.1.2 PvP Trinkets: Insignia of the Alliance, Insignia of the Horde, Medallion of the Alliance, and Medallion of the Horde have all been redesigned. The trinkets for all classes now have the same effect: Dispels all movement impairing effects and all effects that cause loss of control of your character.
---
Just a few monumental changes to balance PVP arena.
---
i have the same thing: i already downloaded the stress test few weeks back and i have the option to "launch" "Beta: World of warcraft Classic" but the play button is greyd out so i cant really start it. other friends dont have this
---
Not really. I had a Rogue in retail once named Abackguy which got reported for a name change. I then changed it to Awhitedude and for some reason that's fine. Even when used in context the way Blizzard bans people is for blind and blanket statements. Hell this is the company that made the ok sign a ban worthy gesture.
---
Weird. My play button is active but when I click it I get "No servers available."
---
Meh he had a genetic heart disease and wasnt aware of it. Did tons of drugs when he went to Thailand and it gave out. Steroids absolutley made it worse but was not the sole cause
---
In an ideal world you'd have 8 shamans, one for each group. You can cut a couple to make up for caster groups realistically though.
---
&gt; Only people i have personally seen been silenced
---
It's like there's a whole world that exists without you or something
---
The best part of this is the computer
---
How do you make money with skinning while leveling? Do you just vendor the leather or put it up on the AH?
---
Guys, it is a post about Layering.
---
Eastern Plaguelands and Hinterlands, so much memories.
---
The helm was common knowledge. I remember learning about it from the official druid forum, it was mostly used to skip the Furor talent and still be able to shift into bear and Feral Charge immediately. Don't remember about the pummeler.
---
You ape, you're the reason were in this mess to being with. Shut ur mouth
---
If you're team mates or you have LoS on them, they will display on the map for a short time. It's not a constant marker.
---
Darkshore is one of the best Alliance leveling zones in terms of efficiency but jesus I hate that zone and Ashenvale. I feel bitter toward most of Kalimdor.
---
\*cough\* black lotus have random spawns can't do it with lotus \*cough\*
---
&gt; Ok, tell me when to cast multi shot again.
---
It's instant cast so in any window between aimed/auto shots that's available.
---
It's funny that he called you a toxic asshole earlier while trying to say people who don't want right click reporting are just looking to not get in trouble when they call someone a name.
---
i'M jUsT mEmEiNg
---
Lmaooo
---
I think they renamed Barak's Head too
---
Insane that some people know these things
---
Not at all.  Hunters were one of if not the most popular classes during Vanilla.  The very narrow focused classic wow Reddit community consistently dismisses hunters because of the poor scaling and subsequent late tier raid production.  Hunters are by far one of the easiest classes to level and play.  I raided with the same guild through all of Vanilla for MC,BWL,AQ40 we had 2 40 man groups.  I don't think either group had less than 5 hunters in the raid.  We combined groups for naxx and still raided with 5 or 6 hunters.  Obviously it wasnt an optimal raid group but we only failed to kill 5 bosses in naxx.  When you used to be able to kill people standing on the roof in gadget and everlook, we would routinely have an all guild raid of nothing but hunters that number between 30-40  He'll we used to joke Hunter alt was mandatory to join the guild.  Hunter is such a pariah in this Reddit people fail to see the class appeal outside of this echo chamber.
---
What would make you think that blizz wouldn't be looking at this sub? There are many community managers that are constantly watching /r/wow, even if they aren't posting regularly the content does get viewed by blizz. And it isn't like this is some grassroots community on the fringe of the userbase. Besides the official forums this is literally the 2nd biggest community for classic users out there.
---
Depends on how popular you are. Getting spammed with requests from suggestions several times per minute is probably not very convenient.
---
imagine this was a new company noone knows with a very promising mmorpg. They have no idea how big it's gonna be, let it be a shitshow.  that's the beauty of launches in any games. It is what it is. 
---
we as the players will need to adapt and everything will be fine in a 10-14 days. 12k cap with queue. The tourist will weed themselves out very shortly.
---
&gt;It's even come to the point where big hunter profiles in the Classic wow community is thinking about rerolling another class on release due to all this mess
---
So... it's for the best?
---
/r/classicwow on Asmongold: Who Cares?
---
I mean.. Look at the window. It's art lmao
---
Just ignore them and go on your merry way you delicate Delilah
---
&gt; there's just no alternative
---
Many servers, smaller in size, common login server to avoid name repeats, then merged once initial rush dies down.
---
Also it's not just about alternative but scope too. As someone pointed out, layering should be only done in non-contested areas, not literally everywhere on the continent.
---
As an avid Simpson's fan I'm not sure if I'm missing a WoW joke here, but I could swear it was "the stinger" not the "nicker"?
---
Chances are that his friend is on the same layer, or afk, or in a full party already. It's not an issue
---
you chose male NE to look better ? wild
---
Then get more stickies. If it's a reddit limitation you should be petitioning them for more.  Its not like they're a limited resource.
---
I will be the next Kungen!
---
hahaha 'the pishew of the arrow' man this must be a hard community to please
---
Because slippery slope to BFA or some nonsense, right?  lol
---
Not for damage. Defias is loaded with Stamina whereas Tunic is Agility for days.
---
My guy feeling tells me yes.
---
I just moved on to Darkshore from Teldrassil and, solo after doing some grinding(I'm level 14) I have ~70 Skinning.
---
If I cut that in half, that would definitely not be enough for stuff in Darkshore.
---
I can't remember any specific poisons or diseases of big inconvience but as a Priest I really hate curses, especially the healing debuff ones.
---
My first MMO too! It drove me CRAZY that I couldn't jump. Man I loved that game... I'd actually love to have pre NGE relaunched if this whole "old mmo" fad continues. I know it wouldn't be very successful, but man the feels
---
Report for sexual harassment and see his life ruined
---
Blizzard got you covered.

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5482/recipe-kaldorei-spider-kabob
---
Need to rock Anathema as holy to tilt people
---
instant cast ya right, gl hitting it while moving haha
---
You wouldn't. They're probably all cowards and snakes.
---
Enemy flag carrier is on their stand in the middle of the alliance base. It shows up as a blue flag instead of red, however, but it is certainly NOT the alliance flag since he is carrying that, and it moves right when he opens the map.
---
You will be, Blizzard's.
---
Nothing says freedom and honor like enslaving and sacrificing draenei for demonic magic :)
---
Now that's what I'm talking about
---
I'd suggest only those who have played it understand the real damage that layering would do yes, heh yes you actually need experience with something before you can pass judgement? Is it different where you live in the world?
---
That's not the Horde we know.
---
Vendor it, at least up to heavy leather. Everyone takes skinning (being by far the easiest prof for levelling) so there's no money to be made on the AH. Just keep an ah mod on and scan it every now and again on your bank alt so you not what stuff is worth before you vendor it.
---
Cringe
---
The hardest part about Hunter rotation is downloading an auto attack timer and fire shots between the self filling bar. It's so complicated and advanced that us simpletons have a hard time understanding all of this.
---
In the vent they talk about going to "the night elf's ear" at one point, they say "last time we saw him" because he literally goes off of the map window itself.
---
"Vision of the flag carrier" is not even a thing, man. How would the game even determine that? And there's nobody on his team even in the enemy base, closest guy is out front of the tunnel.
---
I never said more herbs, read it again if you don't understand.
---
that type of stuff use to not really bother me. I actually feel it's a responsibility now to raise awareness of such issues because the alternative is a fucking death trap. It's not possible, especially with the current technology to regulate behavior with automation. But it's very very alluring because automation will always cater to the largest group of any one thing. While slowly isolating out all minority of thought.
---
Nice of you to provide an example then.
---
Please say you name him Legolas or Legolaus
---
But they won't kill layering. Blizzard has made it clear that stability of server and client trump immersion and player experience every time. People are gonna be apoplectic on launch when they walk through the gates of IF and are greeted by 4 others players.
---
Also the availability would drop the cost of black lotus overall.
---
No, because you're a total dick about it. You're getting upset because people have different interests than you, and then you start acting like a whiny prissy bitch because you can't stand that. Nobody wants your forgiveness because having different interests isn't something that needs forgiven.
---
I can only hope you're a troll who doesn't actually care about Classic, because people like you only make the community, and the game it's built around, worse.
---
Then why didn't they rename the Naga race?
---
[Ferocious Butt][Pounding][For The Children!]
---
In the epidoe it is the stinger. They made a WoW joke because The Blackrock Slicer used to be named the Knicker thus Moe saying, "we can't use that no more"
---
I started in WOD and just played CLASSIC for the FIRST TIME.  Truly THIS is the way the game was MEANT to be played.  THIs is the REAL world of warcraft upvote if u agree plz
---
The blackrock slicer uses to be called the nicker.

It won't until the mods ban simple image posts.  Every big sub is just nothing but low effort bite sized memes, but some prevent those except in self posts and real discussion starts to come up.  Like /r/leagueoflegends
---
Must be Asmongold.
---
Toxic child? LMAO maybe. Short sighted? Highly ironic coming from the retard who can't even understand the negative effects of layering, thats pretty short sighted and I never asked for anyone to be banned from anything in my life, thats also pretty toxic when they havent done anything wrong.
---
As someone who played an Orc Rogue mainly for PvP in vanilla when fear didn’t break in damage... I wished I had rolled Undead frequently. PvE was nice though because I always topped meters.
---
Same here my friend! Going to be many looong nights in front of the computer grinding away, exploring and having fun.
---
As a Horde, I remember often just barely popping in to feralas when I was doing thousand needles. Then on to Tanaris.
---
Data doesn't use contractions, boi.
---
Strength is the best stat damage wise. But you’re right, stacking Intellect is the best choice.
---
People keep saying dead servers omg server merges omg dead servers, when in reality if they released with 30 servers i'm getting maybe 5 of them would end up ghost servers. I'd rather sacrifice those servers then end up with 30 dead servers because layering fucked the game and everyone went back to pservers.
---
I used to play with a rogue who liked to play drunk (both IRL and in game) and swore that he crit more often when drunk
---
We desperately need a megathread to dump all these layering whiners into.
---
It doesn't bother me either, I was just pointing out the irony while also pointing back to my original point of these people being just as toxic or more so than the people they call toxic.  I just wish Blizzard would stop trying to be the rock against the tide when it comes to speech. They really should do as little as possible when it comes to policing the community on language. If someone doesn't like it that can always ignore them. The game was better when this was their approach, now their policing methods just match the boring sterilization that we see in current wow.
---
r/portalkeeping

Vision of the flag carrier was for sure a thing, and on the beta the way it currently worked as of last week, was if you had vision the flag carriers location updated in real time on your map, if your team lacked vision, then the flag was stationary at the last spot you had vision.
---
I haven't seen this anywhere but the regen on the classic servers are crazy high as well, you're full mana in a few seconds after a kill.
---
I think you will find it got all memey after blizzcon because the amount of subs skyrocketed, not because blizz has gone all Illuminati
---
r/swgemu is a pre NGE private servers, pre CU too. Check it out, if they updated this game to todays graphics, that game would be a freaking gold mine. SWG still has the best crafting, and resource system in any game ive ever seen witha crafting system.
---
It's literally not a thing and never has been. If you can cite a source I'll be impressed.
---
I have the same. [Client](https://imgur.com/0uBsKoI) Finally answered my question on how youd select your accounts. Didnt have that when i last logged in. Was just beta/stress and BFA.

I knew I was missing something. Thanks buddy!
---
Thank you all for the replies!
---
So, while Rogues goo about pick-pocketing mobs and opening locked chest in an area, all a druid can do while also waiting for opposing players to come to grind is wiggle their butt?
---
I hope you get replies. I started one of these for the Thrall realm, but mods removed it
---
Everybody who affiliates him/herself with gym culture, atleast has heard of Zyzz.
---
Spoken like a true retail player
---
Read the scenario in the OP.  It was quite ridiculous.
---
You’re damn right brother.
---
But somehow he provided no proof of hearing it. Ion, in an interview, said phase 1 will be "fairly quick".
---
Haha I don’t remember replying to this at all: that’s tockaray that responds as Gilme, bitch lol
---
You might have a stroke of luck and light/medium leather being sold on AH for a good price, but usually it sells for so low it's not worth the deposit.
---
it's profitable, easy to do, less interaction with people. Yes its also very ironic of the situation however thats how it always goes. If blizzard started removing more automation and figured out how to use it to benefit everyone i'd start respecting them again. Because this problem is stemming out to almost all social games right now, not just blizzard ones
---
&gt; atm Hunter is the most broken class on the beta and it's not looking like it's getting better any time soon.
---
Oh god, its *JUST* like the wow forums were back in Vanilla.
---
Interesting, I would have thought that LB resets your swing timer. Is it confirmed that it doesn’t on beta?
---
Shit even just the furblog herb offhand
---
I love Australia, but I hate you! :‘(
---
Just kidding, I love you too :*
---
I do the same thing. Turned out to be super helpful in Elder Scrolls IV. So that was nice.
---
False
---
Layering has been on awhile, but after AV it was turned up to hyper aggressive. I've had mobs layer in, hit me, layer out over and over. Experimentally we've found 4-5 layers with ~20 people in a zone.
---
It might be turned back down now, because I saw people in IF today, but I can't say for sure.
---
Happy cake day to you sir!
---
This item used the be called The Nicker but Blizzard gave it a name change. Must have found it offensive or something.
---
I meant the current layering in beta which is absurdly aggressive compared to what'll be at launch. We're talking &lt;5person layers
---
I won't be crying about layering. If other people cry about layering I'll just ignore it. You should probably do the same and not let someone else's gripes bother you so much.
---
Wtf is with all that non-classic stuff :D
---
shit, after this routine for the leveling process, by the time you get to rags can bench your toon out and just go beat him up yourself. bounce that big ol fire elemental off your rock hard abs.
---
They havent said anything just yet, so its my assumption as much is yours 2,5k. From what we know, they icnreased cap to 3,5k at the very late of vanilla and also we know, that having 6-7k people is completely fine. 10k+ is too much. I think it makes perfect sense, that server will hold more people, but we will know for sure, once they say something regarding this
---
Everyone has to farm consumes, some just have to farm more than others.
---
Bobby B does it again
---
Will old unattainable mounts such as ivory raptor make a return?
---
It's really a non issue, layering is temporary, move on
---
A BIT OF WINE NOW AND AGAIN, A GIRL SQUEALING IN BED, THE FEEL OF A HORSE BETWEEN MY LEGS?
---
Yeah the companies need to just put their foot down and mention there is an ignore feature. They're never going to stop people from offending each other and to act like people have a right to not be offended makes more problems than it solves.
---
Best bot ever
---
Depends what your speccing towards. As a feral, I personally wouldnt. Almost none of the useful stuff is useable while shifted. Im going herb and alch, at least i can gather herbs without shifting.
---
Gonna be so fun to twink again
---
No Lucky Fishing hat, weapon enchants. , Talbar Mantle too
---
You dont have that in retail because there you only do it for shits and giggles. there is no meaningful content outside mythic raiding and m+ dungeons.
---
Now in vanilla if 2 same faction guilds stand in front of a world boss, have a strong rivalry, fended off the horde and hundreds of people start reporting the maintank of one guild before the pull, so he gets kicked repeatedly, then this will be a huge problem.
---
imagine caring about transmog when getting twink BiS lmao.
---
Also, look at that picture, and tell me that set of gear looks good in the first place.
---
pretty sure even against physical damage the stam is more EHP.
---
I see. Thank you.

Yeah zero space is a hardcore blizz fanboy, i wish hed spot spending his moms money on shit. Be careful though, he seems like the person to dig into posters past/quasi-personal info. Realizing now im responding to his post not yours, too lazy to copy paste...  
---
Long story short, this is bullshit ea/Activision shit that some people cant help but defend
---
I agree, not having right click reporting just makes the community worse because people now how to go out of their way to report people.
---
It should be gone by phase 2 so 3-4 months.
---
I'd prefer if the developers didn't try to create a story where regular WoW and classic WoW existed in the same canon. Just have them in separate canons. Having Chromie as a way to introduce Classic was fun but I'd rather they leave it there. Let Classic+ stand on its own legs.

If pservers are anything to go by, vanilla WOW community is extremely racist and I'm glad this isn't going to be named that.
---
This makes me laugh far more than it should. But i guess that's the point.
---
Private servers are not as nearly as broken as Classic though.
---
For melee - rogue, because its basically easy mode. You can pick and choose your fights and get to sneak past stuff.
---
For ranged, hunter is probably a good class, strong at levelling. He might even learn a thing or two about being responsible for his pets.
---
He probably wont enjoy healing or tanking to be honest. Most kids dont.
---
it was item linked in chat to type offensive things in the game and it's not worth the trouble to go through every report and ban every user that does it, after a certain point it's just easier to change the item name
---
all the "ook me in my dooker" jokes in pandaria aren't as bad as a a huge portion of your playerbase, including children, seeing people type incredibly racist shit in chat because an item name triggers them to go mask off
---
Pls at least mention classic here at not just defend bfa
---
This data just proofs that they don't got enough testers because you have to be subbed to current shit game to be eligible. Also, with this few people they still layer people and have issues with it? Dear lord...
---
The latest stress test was actually a Simulation Launch. You downloaded and installed the 'Live' client. Chances are, they are going to continue to update it and, once installed, you will technically already have the game come launch. This is why the option is under the 'Live' list and not PTR.
---
Level out and twink at 39 like a big boy
---
I like how all 4 of your points are entirely false.
---
no you can't say that because its RACIST
---
its RACIST..
---
RACIST..
---
I wonder when those people will stop saying that.
---
Sure, they're probably watching but are they really taking an interest in fixing these things?
---
I've reported the same bug since Vanilla til Cataclysm about 20 times on live+PTR and it never got fixed. I downloaded WoW again last week and played on the starter account and the first thing I did was check if that bug still exists, yes it does fucking 15 years later it still exists so I don't have that much hope in them fixing it all in the next 2 months.
---
I’ve played wow with my dad since 2005. It plays an extreme role in our bonding. You are making a smart choice
---
that frozen throne menu hits the nostalgia right in the feels

Somehow people ironically memeing the ridiculous dialog has convinced people the movies are good now lol.

---
Not only low effort, but not respectful/civil. This is a real issue, in classic and gaming in general
---
I didn't scroll at all, I just read the tweet that was linked. Just read it from the post.
---
eVeRyOnE iS sO tOxIc!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
cant spam if you cant reach them haha
---
thats soo true, i hate blizz for that... after the wotlk pre patch came out at the end of TBC the whole pve changed (nerfed). Every class/specc got some aoe skill so basicly you did not need to plan anything in a normal dungeon or heroic. You just went in, pull everything and aoe, repeat. Previously you needed some planning like, omg we need a mage for cc or a lock for banish etc, after that patch the whole pve system was a faceroll..
---
The other thing what bothered me was the replace of party buff effects with raid buff effects, like shaman totems, auras etc. You needed to make proper raid groups to maximize your raid dps (give a wf totem for the melee groups or boomkin + wrath of air totem for casters), or healers mana regens (shadow priest for healer group). You needed to plan and think before... that was removed too.
---
A junky will always remember their first fix
---
I'm pretty pissed I have a long shift I couldn't get out of that day.  I won't be able to start until about 5 hours after launch.  Kind of weird obsessing about that but it really bugs me.
---
Apes did this.
---
Thanks for the reply. It's been a few years since I've played and I want to start up a shaman again. I thought for sure there was something that could drop for at once in vanilla but I guess I was wrong. Thanks again
---
You forgot the Dutch, negen en negentig.
---
Clearly superiour.
---
I think APES runs primarily Gnomes, but I could be wrong.
---
MCP is not an exploit. It is a weapon that was designed to go fast. You know why you only see Feral and Ret using it? Cause it's a shit weapon on anybody else, and Blizz never touched it for that reason.
---
World buffs were explicitly changed in patch 2.1.0 so that they wouldn't work on targets above level 63. Blizzard realized how broken it would be for people to stomp through the new raids with world buffs stacked to high heaven like that.
---
No
---
Wow. Are there really not even 1000 people on the beta? That is mind shattering low amount of people.
---
My name got reported for a name change just because it was a phrase and not a name. Apparently a lot of names are technically against the rules but they only care if someone reports. Awhitedude would no doubt get removed if someone reported it too.
---
Context is everything. If people are going to write “[Nicker] stole my bike!” in trade chat constantly then it proves that the community isn’t mature or responsible enough to handle such things. Blame these idiots who can’t keep the humor between themselves and friends but have to spam it for the masses. If people used the link just like any other item it wouldn’t be an issue.
---
If I were Blizzard I would change it too because apparently a lot of their customers are dumbass children who can’t be trusted with sharp objects and ruin things for everyone else.
---
Eagle eye doesn't mean someone has eagle eyes transplanted into them. Maybe youre not a native english speaker so ill give you the benefit, but let me know if you need me to expain the "sellout" concept
---
Lloooooollllll
---
I like the sword and board for NE, but the casting animations are kinda odd.
---
Yeah that’s not it.
---
No this is the very exclusive closed beta.
---
SoR --&gt; HoJ --&gt; JoR --&gt; Flash my healer

Thats what I'd do

Isnt Europe objectively "more free" than literally everywhere else?
---
A sane person would guard his health, whatever the case may be and he should have felt his health may have some problems. This only shows to me how rare common sense sometimes is.
---
Depends on how them retail boys act scooter. If they don't like us classics they can go back the way they came! *chews on piece of wheat
---
Not worth the trouble? But kowtowing to stupid people who are pretending to be offended by something that is CLEARLY based on a razor is worth the trouble though?
---
Look at the proc. Look at what the item looks like. It's a razor blade. What happens when you shave? Sometimes you nick yourself. Hence, the name: the Nicker. There is no context where this is offensive. 
---
So to change the name is to give validity to pure stupidity. And that in itself is annoying. It really is amazing how childish and immature our society has become. And things like this distract from actual, real issues going on.
---
With huge inspiration from Dysphoria (Hunter Vs World). I decided i wanted to attempt some Dungeon Soloing while on the Beta. This is just the first half of Uldaman :) . Cant wait to figure out how to Solo some more dungeons. Any suggestions would be helpful too. This is my first video with editing and i know its pretty wonky
---
Careful man... you're about to get black bagged and your blizzard account permanently banned lol
---
skipping spirit tap/wand spec is okay if you're always in groups, but for solo leveling/questing, these are essential. These days, all priest specs for leveling recommend immediately maxing these talents. I'll be leveling holy as well, but not sure about going as deep as Spirit of Redemption.
---
The leeway is much shorter in that video than on the beta.
---
But he wasnt aware of the condition...
---
He was in peak physical shape and had better nutrition than 99% of the populace.
---
Millions of people every year do drugs and are absolutley fine. Freak circumstances kill3d him. Was such a huge idol to me when i was younger
---
&gt; Apparently a lot of names are technically against the rules but they only care if someone reports.
---
It's intentionally left vague so they are free to do anything they want. 
---
&gt; the community isn’t mature or responsible enough to handle such things
---
Just put them on ignore and stop being a delicate Delilah. The fact is knick a real word and the knicker is a good way to describe a sharp edge. Should they take out the [For the Children] achievement too? Hell should we ban anyone for doing the old anal [Backstab]? Policing language is as futile as yelling at the moon, let people police it themselves Blizzard should have no obligation for it and the only reason they do is to virtue signal.
---
It's mostly based on cast speed and the base it set at 3.5s to get 100% of the spell power. A 1.75s cast spell would receive 50%. Dots receive 100% due to the long period they last and instant casts and attack damage receives a minimal percentage. But there are other factors based on how each spell works too, like spell rank and spell design.
---
Calculating Holy shield spell coefficiency, I recon, is one of the more complicated calculations to do. Luckily, someone usually does stuff like this for us; [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)
---
And both in this link and the spell details of Holy Shield says 5%. Blessing of Sanctuary apparently receives 0%.
---
You’re really scared of losing your broken leeway huh? God I hope they fix it before Classic goes live.
---
I might be wrong, but I think grenades are an incapacitate effect like gouge, so it shouldn't affect your stun DR. 
---
I also seem to remember something about cheap shot not being affected by DR, so it really only matters for kidney.  Again though, might be misremembering.
---
If you dont like something, downvote it. If something breaks the rule, report it. 
---
But to report something that you dont like is just... stupid?
---
What's off with pet ai currently? For me it has always been kinda interesting. Is there now real problems or are they just using pet ai from retail and that doesn't match with vanilla?
---
Good thing is that Blizzard have their team and they dont listen to random people with "good" ideas
---
Horde is pretty much an evil faction.
---
How many of you guys talking about how bad things are in the game 1) actually have beta access and 2) actually played and remember vanilla wow?  
---
I've been in the beta since the first few weeks and it feels, for the most part, fine. There are  definitely issues but as far as most game launches go, and as far as how it stacks up vs. vanilla or pservers, it's actually doing pretty well and feels great 99% of the time. Not going to give the whole "lul its beta" line, but the game certainly isn't in as bad of shape as clickbait youtubers and keyboard warrior redditors that don't actually have beta access  would make it sound.
---
Don't be the rabble that the outrage culture rabble-rousers want to rouse. Report the issues you find if you have beta access, and just have fun with the rest of us when the game releases.
---
Wait...I don’t even understand this. You want to let people grind 5 more levels? But not release any new content for that level?
---
A substantial percentage of the undead quests involve murdering random alliance civilians and/or working on the plague to kill them all. 
---
The undead in vanilla were flat out evil.
---
The difference here is community involvement. The game is much different now than it was in 2004-200X insofar that the entire community is much more connected, informed and hyper-aware of all of these things. Back in the actual vanilla days, outside of the blizz forums there were very few out of game resources and congregation areas.
---
Today as it stands, social media platforms such as reddit, and moreso probably streamers and their popular followings on other platforms (mainly Twitter but also instagram, discord servers, etc etc) are all able to understand more in-depth about these issues, and also able to congregate and make noise to more accurately quantify the userbase's desire to see things like bug fixes and patches on specific problems.
---
I'm not trying to say that these differences will assuredly lead to fixes, but they most definitely give blizz a **much** better gauge of what the community is asking for. This is all in contrast to way back in retail days where you just kinda had to hope that enough people had made formal bug reports to bring enough attention to these issues and get them placed higher up in the worklog for a dev team to actually tackle fixing them.
---
I am absolutely hopeful that we will see some serious change for the better when classic actually launches. Although not too ignorant to also know that blizz isn't the same company than it was back then too. The only truth is that we're gonna have to wait it out to see what launch brings us and decide what to do from there.
---
He doesn’t have sponsors.
---
Current version gives you mana free casting but in Vanilla Innervate just returned % of your mana over time.
---
not noticeable at all unless you're comparing yourself to an equally geared, equally skilled human warrior. And even then, 2% max? Imagine wiping a raid because of your sub-optimal race choice. Makes no sense. Racials only matter for pvp.
---
I haven't played since the end of MoP and im stoked for a return to form. Vanilla is in my top 10 favorite games and I really excited. I likely won't be able to play much because life happens but I'm going to give it mt best. 
---
I went warlock in vanilla and it was pretty fun. I'd recommend going into the affliction tree for the increase in dot dmg and to increase shadow bolt dmg in the destruction tree. Demo wasn't all to good in vanilla imo.
---
 #nochanges, a true Vanilla experience.
---
That's sharding though not layering
---
fuck no.  #nochanges 
---
haha now I get to be the no changes dick.
---
They won't. There are far too many "professional victims" in today's society, unfortunately.
---
I am remaking my first character so that he may still "live" on the server.
---
Though I am not playing him in the true sense, he will run all of my daily errands and spend time in town at the bar telling stories and enjoying his drinks.
---
My bank alt is a retired dwarf hunter, revered for his prior triumphs in naxxaranas over the scourge lord, Kel thuzzad. He will spend the rest of his days guarding his accumulated treasures in both stormwind and iron forge while taking weekend fishing trips to STV and participating in the occasional matches held in WSG.
---
I have a strange theory about Chromie.
---
I think the theory is dependent on classic WoW’s success. Typically, in ALL sci-fi, going back in time changes the future. I am curious if Chromie went back in time to change some future event? 
---
Maybe change how things went with Lichtenstein Boy or the Burning Crusade, etc.? Maybe a patch 1.13 or a different expansion following classic? 
---
Don’t shoot me. I know we are scared of what the current devs could do. Especially given the greatness of TBC and Woltk (in my opinion).  
---
It will be curious if we see a new string of lore development due to Chromies actions and intentions.
---
On the Blizzard forums mark the link as "preformatted text".
---
For MW sure but Druid has the 3 roles that monk does and the melee specs play quite similarly.
---
Layering is the reason why I’m thinking about not coming back, but who cares.
---
Fyi you can only have two stickies. Its a reddit site limitation.
---
I always look forward to the break that 1k gives me. It’s a mindless grind fest that I can zone out and get at least a couple levels as well as a good amount of gold from trash drops.
---
No, you can't be racist.
---
No, you can't even be a bit racist.
---
No, you can't talk about greasy specs or greedy kites or thieving naggers and pretend you aren't being racist either.
---
Live with it. Or go play a different game.
---
If you think companies wanting a personal hand in moderating massive discussion forms that are directly responsible for community opinion is a conspiracy theory then there's no hope arguing with you.
---
I disagree, the 18.9 DPS / +15AP 1h sword from BFD would like to have a word with you.
---
Especially if you're a Rogue.
---
\&gt; removing it is smart 
---
pandering to political correctness is now considered smart? ugh this shit has gone too far in 2019
---
I don’t see how not receiving any gear till level 65 will make people do old raids?
---
Actually when you come back you realize how difficult everything was and soon it will become irritating. My guess is class fever is to die down within a 6 month time. Wonder how soon people will want a tbc and wotlk server to follow.
---
The amount of layers is dynamic. So at launch server might have like 10 layers (number is just example not fact). After player load starts to even out, the amount of layers start to lower as well. So couple weeks after launch we might have 3 layers.
---
This happens as long as only on layer is required (one server) or when phase 2 hits. Ion said that when world bosses are up there can't be more layers.
---
Benediction....
---
*drools*
---
Can’t fucking wait to get one again!!!
---
Serious question, were Classic servers always full of these kind of people? Or is this an influx of Retail Cata/Legion babies?
---
Or are people just salty they can’t play the beta? If they can’t understand simple reasons why Blizzard would gift the beta as a perk to subbed players then I don’t know how long it will be before they start demanding Blizzard make X or Y change in game and ruin the whole thing again.
---
I’m looking forward to playing Classic with a bunch of dudes that have grown up and actually want to have fun with people that can relate to them, I played it with 12 year olds before I’d rather not have to deal with armies of them again lol
---
I have been using old Reddit so long I nearly forgot they made a new Reddit.
---
\&gt; vanilla WOW community is extremely racist 
---
Humans, when anonymous, love dark comedy and saying shit that's overboard. 
---
This isn't a vanilla wow thing, its an anonymity thing.
---
I prefer The Nikker
---
That’s a pretty good idea for gankers. It won’t be common but it’s yet another way to abuse layering among hundreds of other ways.
---
Layering is an absolute necessity for launch to not be a complete shit show. The exploitable issues within layering are the problem, not layering itself. How else do you expect to have reasonable server populations without having hundreds of servers at launch?
---
getting to 65 in vanilla quest greens would actually be fairly hard for some classes.
---
[lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)
---
Put me on ignore, drink a coke and stfu.
---
Your neckbeard is showing.
---
And raiding BWL/AQ/Naxx would be easy.
---
Ganking is when you kill a Grey's, everything else is just pvp.
---
Yeah you might need to check those priorities buddy.
---
You could, it just didnt do anything, like you couldnt use it to get up to something.
---
You're*, you fucking Cretin.
---
You’re my idol
---
Blizzard missed all the time in diablo 2 too.
---
The hunter in he wants that weapon for pvp
---
As a Rogue who immediately goes and runs BFD @ level 22 for the quest sword, I feel attacked.
---
im having the same thing. Got my hopes up :(
---
Shh, don't tell the USians, they've been told since birth they are the freest people on Earth, as they recite the Pledge of Allegiance, hide under the desk in active shooter drills, and die without health care if they get fired.
---
lol good pt.  New players would just sort of be fucked.
---
No.
---
The world is not ready for The Nicker again just yet
---
10/10
---
Wait and see is definitely my approach, I'm just worried about my class selection at launch because I'm already a bit iffy about Hunters being pretty much obsolete after BWL but atleast you had PVP to fall back on. Most of these bugs are PVP-minded so that's a big worry especially when your first char can dictate your entire Vanilla economy/pve-experience.
---
They're checked. I just moved states and got way too many things to do than just to start focusing on study straight away. Gotta save up money for a vehicle then I already have other hobbies and things to do.
---
This will go down as the most under appreciated memes of this reddits short history. Bravo.
---
Solution:
---
No layering
---
Combine realms later on
---
Yes. PVE server has also about a third of these numbers. It's REALLY empty.
---
Lol you are going to be seriously upset when you realized how clapped warriors are even at top tier gear to every class.
---
Ah this again, gamers living in a society getting upset that blizzard is taking away their n-word joke. 
---
How will you ever manage without it.
---
Gnome for ultimate immersion.
---
i dont understand the hostility, but well... here we go.
---
There are apples and there are wines. 
---
Take Zelda: Ocarina of Time for example. When it was released it was without a doubt the most advanced game. It invented stuff like autofocus which is used by all games today. But that game is more than 20 years old. Take it and play the remaster on the 3ds or put the original game into an emulator and play it on 1440p with 60 fps.  
---
Play it today. And what do you get? a fkn masterpiece of a game. It is STILL amazing by 2019 standards. It aged like a good wine.
---
When Vanilla was released, it was groundbreaking. No one is denying that. And one of my best gaming moments of all time is from a 14 day trail in vanilla wow. Now port it to 2019.   
---
And what do you get? Classes and specs that are just straight up not playable. Completely unbalanced. Extremely slow gameplay, which is all very trivial (look up the world first ragnarok kill. the rogue Pov... the guy is not moving for 3 minutes straught). And a lot of stuff is gated behind heavy grind or other timegates (there are still a lot of people who said that reaching pvp rank 14 in a reasonable time was only doable by account sharing).
---
For people who value these things, Vanilla didnt age like a fine wine, but an apple. And I dont know about you but i wouldnt eat a 14 years old apple. 
---
Its all about what you value in a game. There are many reasons to be excited about classic. But I dont know why someone has to fight about it like that. If a discussion comes naturally, fine, but your post just asked for a fight
---
It’s hard living in a society, you should rise up.
---
I don’t think getting to 65 in normal vanilla leveling gear is hard at all for any class. It’s just slightly slower.
---
That Asmongold starts streaming at about 1PM
---
This is literally Retail 2.0. And look at how well that turned out.
---
As far back as TBC (When blizzard in my opinion started the trend of making bad mistakes, that would snowball to an insane level later on) there was immediate pushback on every single stupid decision blizzard made. And there would always be massive retards who got off on defending blizzard. 
---
Now look at where we are in retail. The retards got their way and the game became unplayable.
---
We have 2 options to go from here. Be giant retards and call everyone who complains "toxic" and run this game into the ground too. Or maybe, and just here me out here, actually fucking listen this time.
---
He is just trying to cope with living in a society, beat to just ignore them.
---
The two most annoying bugs are FD not dropping combat in PVP and the pet randomly refusing to attack mobs which are meanwhile beating your face in. The latter one is incredibly frustrating.
---
10k from what I have heard
---
Get ripped or die mirin'
---
100% serious, you should just explain the classes to him and let him decide which one seems like the most fun or interesting. He's more than old enough to adapt to the play style and learn to excel at whatever he does regardless of what class it might be.
---
But **MOST** importantly, rather than him being fully capable and top tier at controlling his character, you want him to have fun. You want him to enjoy his experience, and the only way for him to do that is if he is interested in gaining the knowledge to do so.
---
Maybe he could find it difficult to get invited to dungeons or raid groups if he for whatever reason wants to play as a melee hunter. So what? If he is having fun levelling at a snails pace questing in random areas, then he's having fun. And he's always got his parent to carry him on their closely levelled main/alt when you two play together.
---
The great and wonderful thing about wow is just how noob friendly the game is. There are no restrictions on what you can do if you truly want to do it that way. And the option to delve deeper into the ideology of min/maxing and being as powerful as possible is at everyone's fingertips if they choose to make that choice to be competitive.
---
I'm being totally honest when I say that you should give him the freedom to do what he thinks will be fun in his own head. Help inform him about different things, such as class differences and gameplay types and whatnot, but let him come to his own decisions without too much advice about what you think would be best for him. You'll both appreciate it in the long run.
---
I roleplay in the world where Engineering is mandatory on every class in the game, so its fine for me.
---
&gt; The patch to make feral nonshit came in AQ40 iirc.
---
That's when the gear started having feral stats on it, prior to this the 31 point feral talent was heart of the wild, so it was garbage tree, with no real way to realistically DPS. But we're operating on a patch further along the timeline so we will have a decent talent tree to play with, with talents that are going to make feral that much better.
---
I played in vanilla way back when, walking into MC not knowing what any of the bosses did, not know what spec was "BEST". Now we have done it a billion times, we know where to get things, what specs work, how to DPS and heal even. Information share is that much different.
---
Blizzard isn't looking at fucking with the mechanics let's get that straight. They are trying to bring back the old version of the game, but some things cannot be preserved (old 1.1 talent trees). But what can be preserved, are item stats. Along with that, how classes interact with some items. (Like Manual Crowd Pummeler).
---
The game is going to be a joke compared to how it was back in the day. We're much more informed, we know how to play the game now. Anyone who has played Retail for any amount of time will find the mechanics a joke leading up to AQ40/Naxx. And even those two raids, are going to pale in comparison to modern LFR raids.
---
And yes Wolfshead is disgustingly overpowered for a long time, because on how Furor works. As such it was messed with later down the line because of this, as power shifting was an issue. It meant that high skillcapped druids would power shift and basically break "Blizzard Math" in terms of how much damage the feral should be putting out. (As Blizz can't realistically take into account power shifting when you need to take into account latency, and player skill).
---
So again, if you don't like how it operates, you don't have to play classic. It was like that back then, Manual Crowd Pummeler is like that back then., we never realized how strong it was until we were deep into AQ/Naxx. (As all other feral weapons were stat sticks or pure garbage) And Wolfshead, is just adding to the complexity and skill ceiling of Ferals.

 Monkeynews and Tribe both roll gnome warrior, the recital is incredible for pvp.
---
Dude. OP spent hours doing research, and you are countering with "From what I recall from 15 years back...". Bring some evidence of at least make a valid point to why OPs evidence is unreliable.
---
Yea, fuck opportunity to progress in life, you can progress in a game that was released 15 years ago and is coming out again
---
You should be embarrassed if you actually meant that. SO much cringe
---
Chromie has been around as a questgiver since classic...
---
Lets wait and see
---
Totally on your side. It's insane people want this removed and the amount of pandering to political correctness is insane.
---
Yep. Honestly this weapon should be changed in the pserver core as well with how much blatant racism there is in every pserver world chat I've ever seen.
---
&gt;Must have found it offensive or something.
---
Yeah, seems fine to me.
---
Btw, can I stay at your place tonight? My Dad has 'ghost club' in the woods tonight so theres no sheets on my bed.
---
So timewalking?
---
Interesting! I wonder if hypothetically you were just going for threat and not mitigation if Attack Power and Strength are far superior to spell damage with all the low coefficients on that list.
---
Jfk more of this trash.
---
If it was the same as vanilla you'd have 4 months to get it, so pretty much anyone that can play an hour a day would have it.  
---
In vanilla it was really just a mark of someone that started in the first couple of months, and seeing as in Classic everyone will start in the first it will never have the same prestige.   
---
They could make it a lot harder to get than in vanilla, like for those who hit 60 in the first 6 weeks, but that's not really vanilla like at all, it's more like adding an achievement for levelling quickly.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
did you just say that Super Mario and Zelda has lost its soul after Nintendo released the juggernauts Odyssey and breath of the wild?
---
1-50 would take about the same time as 50-60 don´t you think?
---
Have you not seen the earlier posts in this sub? They already are asking for TBC aka post Naxxramas content, and classic isn’t even live yet.
---
No one wants sharding. Layering is necessary for there to be no changes. Nice self portrait.
---
Say it bro, it’s just a gamer word, come on just say it, I know you want to ;)
---
Some people like the slow pace of classic, some don't. Try to enjoy it for what it is and don't enjoy it based on this subreddits frothing hype mindset.
---
Still a better solution though. The layers were a cool idea. Turned out too disruptive in the beta. They should just admit defeat and go with sharding 1-20. No shame in learning. :)
---
farm that karm like a boss
---
It’s interesting how irrelevant PC was back then.
---
They should admit defeat and just not do any of that bs
---
Idk what that is unless you’re talking about magic cards
---
Havent you seen Black Mirror”Striking Vipers”?  its cool...
---
It's called the forums, which all the beta testers have access to, and which people outside the beta don't need access to.
---
This has also bothered me for 15 years. I doubt it will be fixed now

---
I think we should be vocal about layering, but arguing that the economy is the issue is just wrong.
---
This is very interesting and I just spent a very long time analyzing that footage and trying to make sense of it.  There are definitely 2 flags being tracked in that video as shown on the map however both are Alliance (this is a common glitch). I think both flags started being tracked during the TBC prepatch (2.0.1). 
---
I tried to find another video with flag tracking and I ended up finding this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRo85GgLlEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRo85GgLlEs) . If you jump to 1:07, you can clearly see that both flags are shown on map. Initially I was really surprised that there was another video with both flags on map and everyone in vanilla gear. However, its interesting that this video was released Dec 16th 2006. This is important as 2.0.1 was launched Dec 5th 2006. Which goes along with the story that your video is from 2.0.1.
---
I also found this video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR6igwESg6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR6igwESg6c)  that claims to be 1.12 and was released on Oct 18th 2006, which makes sense considering 1.12.1 (technically 1.12.2) was the current patch at the time. In this video there is no flag tracking at all because the hunter's team never picks up the flag, going along with the idea that enemy flag tracking was never in vanilla.
---
I would be interested to see if someone might be able to find the change in some patch notes somewhere, there are no changes listed for WSG in 1.11, 1.12, or 2.0.1 so I don't know when it happened but according to the videos it definitely did. 
---
**Keep the videos coming. I want to find the truth!**
---
[Oh no..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtkq9Y9pDuI)
---
this thread is silly, i'm all for calling out bugs but this thread is borderline just saying "DO UR JERB BOI"
---
Everyone has the ability to install the actual live client in the launcher now. Servers will be online when the next live simulation stress test happens in July, then again beginning August 26/27.
---
stamina &gt; agility at level 19 bracket. Hands down.
---
Because the private servers will be getting taken down, more than likely lol
---
Same, 1-10 was a breeze. No need to eat or drink and mob died with ease
---
Still you're talking about layering, not phasing.
---
Props! I feel like this is why the beta was so early, they expected people to have the time to really get through everything and the devs to address each issue that is found
---
Well, maybe for us hardcore fans it would be best, but losing a lot of casuals because of 1-3h queue times is not a valid business strategy. I fully understand and respect that, and to be honest, we need those people to make the game thrive. Sure, sharding in faction zones will be annoying, but we will be out of there in a couple of hours anyway.
---
You'll be better off. First couple zones will be nuts the first few hours.
---
Will the game have an in game calendar where you can create events?
---
retail is objectively more challaging.
---
mixologist's tunic
---
barman shanker
---
green offhand sword?
---
wicked leather pants?
---
First phase is like 2 months.  They're not going to keep it in for world bosses,
---
Nah dude.  I have been a part of many video game communities.  The private server community is a literal cesspool of racism and nazi talking points.  It is worse than your average video game community
---
How sad are you from a scale of one to GAMER that you can’t make n-word jokes in trade chat without getting banned? I mean it’s JUST A WORD bro
---
That could be campfires changed to trees
---
there is no troll warlock in classic
---
When was the last time you played Vanilla WoW? I've played Warrior on multiple Vanilla private servers. I've been playing this game since November 23, 2004. I have 100% percentile parses on Retail. I'm not some idiot who isn't remembering the game correctly.
---
The portals thing is a screenshot from WoW, your post is a bunch of streamers' faces, and layered.com, whatever that is. I would have reported it as not having to do with WoW classic if I had seen it. If you're going to advertise for whatever layered.com is you should probably explain why its relevant to classic.
---
Im sorry but if you break ahead of the pack (1-6) it's completely in your hands to get 1-10 in under 1:45 pretty easily. After that area no one was ever around me to compete for tags.
---
Yes, nothing about OP's post screams elitist.
---
Laugh at his headgear and enchants....
---
Nothing he is alliance. That healers on the other team bruh.
---
They have cool spell animations especially with the pony tail :D
---
Yes, that's one of the QoL changes they're keeping.
---
didnt everyone said that classic will have huge numbers due to hype and will decline afterwards? 
---
isnt that exactly what happened?
---
&gt;  but losing a lot of casuals because of 1-3h queue times is not a valid business strategy.
---
Blizzard thinks all those people will drop off and quit anyway. They think none of the servers will have over 3000 people come phase 2 because otherwise they will have to keep layering in. They won't even put up enough servers for the EU to not have to self segregate on unofficial servers. This is a side project for them so that they can try and lure people into buying BfA.
---
He shit the bed hard.
---
The guild I was in when I first raided in vanilla with my mates was called Mighty Midgets. As the majority were gnome or dwarf, but I was human so ruined it :P
---
I totally forgot you can still opt-in to pvp on a PvE server!
---
That just settled it for me, thank you /u/ashen_dayman
---
yes, yes it fucking was.  
---
and its so blatantly obvious too.
---
All i wanted to do was be a Dark Iron and by the time i unlocked it i was burnt out.
---
It's not actually instant cast. It's got about a half second cast, same with auto shot.
---
Tin foil hat warning. Also, what's up with that username?
---
Ion was interviewed saying a few weeks. Given it’s a launch-only failsafe precaution it’ll last 4 weeks tops once the launch rush dies off and the broader population is out of the first individual leveling zones.
---
If you have to ask you're seriously stupid
---
So back then all game world files were stored in .mpq files in you world of Warcraft folder. You simply had to open these files with a special program and change the models. So if you wanted to change the model of a campfire, you searched for it's location, removed that model, added another in its place and renamed it to campfire. Done.
---
if you can't tell that hes trolling then your are a right at home here on reddit.
---
Not at all, it's just the way I've found to integrate layering in the lore
---
While leveling agi is better than strenght, especially early on. If yoj kill a mob with 6 attacks ig requires a lor more strenght to get down to 5 hits so crits help a lot more
---
I don't get it
---
Preface: I have not played Beta. Mained a hunter in Vanilla with high level PVE/PVP experience.  
---
I went through the bugs and most of them are not gamebreaking and I expect the obvious bugs to get fixed. Hunters were a VERY clunky class in Vanilla and you had to play around a lot of garbage/broken mechanics, so I'm not surprised to see a thread with folks jumping ship! Honestly, probably a good call to do so now. Polymorph, fear, blind are just a tad more reliable than FD/trap :P  
---
The main ones I would be worried about are bugs 5 and 33 (range and FD trap.)  
---
Bug 5 - honestly, we need more evidence/videos on this one before I pass judgement. Any changes to range, deadzone, melee attack range etc are all gamebreaking for our class.     
---
Bug 33 - FD trap was never 100%... sometimes you'd stay in combat weirdly. In this video the guy's pet is getting beat by half a dozen mobs while a rogue is beating on him. FD trap was 100% when you'd scatter, FD/pet passive. That would always drop you from combat letting you trap. It was a finicky maneuver and sometimes you'd stay in combat and get screwed which is what seems to have happened to this guy. FD/trap is not Blind or Skillcoil. Hunters have very shitty CC, which is good otherwise they'd be OP.  
---
Others:  
---
Bug 20 - I am fairly certain this is how aspects worked in Vanilla. The !Aspect of the Hawk macro recast it every time. That is how it worked in Wrath and TBC I recall.  
---
Bug 25 - an annoying bug, but pet happiness was VERY buggy in Vanilla just FYI. Pets were prima donnas and happiness doing odd things like this happened pretty much the entire length of Vanilla. Hopefully gets fixed, but if not it's not far from the original!  
---
Bug 29 - I may by confused by this one. The combat log shows an Aimed immediately followed by an auto-shot at the same time, which is how I thought it worked?  
---
Bug 31 - Entrapment should proc when immolation trap/explosive trap is triggered (not on ticks). In the vid it doesn't proc when explosive is triggered. Would need to see more tests and combat log. I think entrapment can be resisted? Honestly though, Entrapment+frost trap was optimal in most situations in Vanilla. It WAS a very buggy ability **to the Hunters benefit** for much of Vanilla. IIRC it didn't DR and the aura followed the hunter around constantly rooting people. I really hope it is still OP in Classic!!  
---
Bug 32 - This may indeed be a bug, but IIRC there were always issues with the trap animation in Vanilla. Sometimes you'd perform the animations, sometimes not. Playing side-by-side with friends you'd see that you'd do the animation on your screen, but on his screen you wouldn't do it. My point is, this is the kind of clunky mechanic that did exist in Vanilla, so I'm not surprised to see it back for Classic.  
---
Bug 48 - I'd like to see some clips. Might be wrong, but I think Intimidation could dodged/miss and it would use up the charge? Might have happened here. Just spitballing.  
---
Bug 49 - I'd like to see what other players see when you FD. Would be an interesting test, but yes Health and Mana should go to zero.
---
seriously?  Well, I guess I won't be playing wsg.  fuck exploits.
---
&gt; Actually when you come back you realize how difficult everything was and soon it will become irritating.
---
For some people the difficulty will be irritating, for others it will make success far more satisfying.  We'll have to wait and see what the proportions of that are.
---
I like feralas, often an overlooked zone. Nice storyline and quest hubs.
---
There's a whole lot that's dumb about the n word. First that it's racist because you are telling people they can't say it based on the color of their skin then the fact you act like making a joke is in the same line as being a holocaust advocate. Your argument is quite literally retarded in that it has no depth of thought and forgets all about context because 'blanket subject' is bad!
---
No Fiery or Crusader? Laugh at this scrub.
---
Yeah let's get rid of all the jokes. That will surely make our society better. The majority of jokes get to deal with stereotypes and making fun of some category of people, be it the blondes, policemen, irishmen, old people, lords, lawyers, mother-in-laws, jews, women, men and so on. To supersensitive people all of them can be offensive.   
---
I don't want to live in a world where the only jokes you can use are the super innoffensive "christian" jokes,
---
I would say Nelf Female Hunters are more often than not guys, but the rest is legit.
---
I don't respec to heal a dungeon. I start in enhancement and then go some resto talents not going elemental - with trying more and more dungeons as healer at around 60 to get priority on healer gear prior to raids. Even at lower levels in instances I tend not to use elemental spells for DPS - saving mana for emergency healing as it can be needed.
---
Im so curious how he wouldve impacted the current body building community. He was way ahead of the curve. Rip
---
What happens when do that?  Does it target the one that's closest?
---
I would be interested in the stats of how many children will actually start to play 15 year old game :-)
---
You'll be fine leveling that way but still start with the recommend spirit tap and wand spec. You'll still be able to heal fantastic while getting those and then can do holy for even better healing while not hindering your solo leveling speed. Find groups or someone to duo with but those two talents will help you immensely during solo content which you will have to do occasionally
---
It's blatant that he wrote "your" instead of "you're" like 90% of the people online?
---
I mean, most people will need at least a month to reach 60, maybe longer. Even high-end raiders will take quite some time if they didn't book vacation. If the idea is that the majority tries MC without DM loot, less than 2 months on your first big raid is "fairly quick".
---
[The Nicker] stole my bike.  Good times
---
you can avoid this and grind some mobs.
---
i will do this before i enter crossroads and skin/grind mobs in the og area to skinning 60
---
For Strat dead there is a disease debuff, no poisons in there. Also want strong heals for Rivendare’s aura damage.
---
It’s rank 11, not blood guard. Lieutenant General
---
My take for about a month is that their internal alpha produced a very stable and reliable client that needs very little fixing. This is expected since the reference client was already a complete data set and only needed to be ported onto current architecture.
---
This Beta was more a hype drive than it was for testing. Everything I’ve seen points to this being a pretty polished Beta before it even went live, which bodes well for launch.
---
He is right though. This has NOTHING to do with performance.
---
This is about world bosses. Layering them means duplicating world boss loot. Sure, they can do whatever the hell they want, but this would be a new level of impact that could actually kill the classic progression completely.
---
Can u link me to where leeway was confirmed correct
---
It made me feel happy to look out that window
---
Ashenvale is the BEST for world PvP. So many ambush crossings stops along the main road, I just can't wait.
---
Fair pvp is not ganking ;-)
---
Not having a joke that is literally just the n word is political correctness?
---
Literally says 700
---
I love the fact there's no original collectors edition lol.
---
karma whoring it up like a boss
---
There are few pleasures in life greater than calling for friends into a game when you're being GY camped by nelf rogue twinks and showing them what real twinks look like.
---
There's been a lot of hype around Classic, good reception on twitch etc. People being excited to play the game your working on tends to boost morale more than anything.
---
It's hard to prevent crunch, companies get more value out of their employees and employees invested in their project want it to succeed. With both sides having motivation to engage in it, you're not gonna be able to do much about it. The good news is that the game seems pretty far along, hopefully it was scheduled well and employees won't feel pressured into doing it.
---
I would be 100% without a doubt letting the Blizz devs trading their health and wellbeing to address the issues. 
---
WoW devs have proven themselves to be incompetent and literal morons for about a decade now. I would sleep fine at night knowing that their paychecks were being earned to be productive. I mean they've collected one for producing literal garbage for a while now, might as well earn those dollars.
---
Depends what you consider a key item tbf.
---
Spriest dps is pretty balls, and they definitely need mana pots and demonic runes to even do mediocre dps during raids.
---
That offhand sword is the green quest reward fro  WPL. After you defeated the last caludron boss. The weapon is called Intrepid Shortsword. Quest name is Mission Accomplished!
---
There was a thread on reddit once where the guys that took the photo actually elaborated on how it all happened. Really funny how the original people behind it were found.
---
I'm not gonna find the relevant though lol, sorry.
---
Stamina on gear doesn't scale nearly as well as damage. Sometimes damage upgrade get rid of stamina on gear.
---
Hopefully the moderation continues and increases.
---
Or you know adults that work, have classes, go to the bar, have social interactions instead of playing a game all night
---
No that won’t be in the game.
---
Five hours actually sounds like the perfect amount of time for people to stop clogging the login screen so you'll be able to get in by then.
---
You're either trolling or not intelligent enough to be on the internet.
---
It defaults to the one with the higher IQ. So pretty much the pet every time.
---
Because of layering?
---
When levelling I would love to take on a few mobs at a time for the thrill of it and end game I want to do PvP mainly...
---
Although if I get the gear, raids too :)
---
That's a shame. Great tool for raids
---
Basically the same as Super Mario 64
---
Can’t wait to feel like I’m playing on a freshhhhh pserver due to language-clusterfuck EU servers.
---
ive got to ask, what bug is this?
---
It's always "casuals" who get the short end of a stick. People flipped their shit during stress test, when there were 3h long queues without layering. Another thing about layering - have you ever been in a situation,when your MT sits in a hour long queue,because he've got kicked from accout for afk before raid? When layering will be gone - you'll be able to experience that and see posts about bringing layering back here
---
Which is why I'm not currently playing on one. If classic is as bad as it is now, I guarantee private servers will become more popular than ever since they can data mine the shit out of classic. They just need to find a place to host it.
---
I hope they work 90 hour weeks since the game is a mess.
---
&gt; No, it isn't. Its multiplying it by however many layers there are. You can hop layers, you can't hop servers in Classic.  
---
Seems like you missed the point. If you take the definition of the word, yes they get multiplied. But not in regards to the game, because if you can hop layers, meaning there are layers, then there are also more players!
---
On a realm with 3k people there are e.g. 100 lotus available. On 5 realms with 3k people each there are 500 lotus available. On 1 realm with 5 layers and 15k people there are also 500 lotus available. **Layers do not change the amount of materials available per player in the entire economy**, and that's how the economy works. In fact, this is a requirement. If there are 5 times as many players on a server, there need to be 5 times as many materials.
---
There are literally millions of jokes that don't involve being bigoted. And nobody is saying "no sterotypical jokes ever", context matters. If you're talking to an Asian friend you've known for 5 years and your relationship is close enough you can both probably tell racist jokes to eachother. However saying the n word in barrens trade chat is different.
---
goggles are better in vanilla, Fishing hat is common quality afaik
---
Yes, stupid.  It isn’t the N word - it’s a giant razor that “nicks” people.  Changing the name to appease pearl-clutchers such as yourself is the very definition of political correctness.
---
In the distant future all humor will be illegal because it offended someone.
---
Or just get a stationary bike.
---
This is a frickin beta though... if enough people are up in arms over an issue in the BETA of a game, then maybe that should be allowed to be voiced as often as possible. 
---
It is just straight censorship to avoid the issue.  I have no doubt there is some money behind their decision to keep removing most threads regarding layering right now.
---
Where am I arguing? of course that happens. I was just pointing out the massive jump in subs since the announcement, which absolutely does lead to the influx of meme's and low effort posts.
---
Don't be such a snarky knowitall
---
&gt; It's a pretty simple thing to understand 
---
It seems like you understood the word "supply", but missed the word "demand". If there are 3 layers, meaning 3 times as many nodes, meaning 3 times as much supply. Then there are also 3 times as many people playing on that server, meaning 3 times as much demand. Layers do NOT increase the amount of materials available per player on a server. In fact,  their materials are required. Otherwise there would be LESS materials than in vanilla. The only thing that changes is that a single person (!) is able to harvest more materials in a short time, meaning there can be a change in who gets these materials. Kinda like an increase in the difference between poor and rich.
---
Can I ask you what exactly the joke is? I just want you say it from your mouth and maybe think about it for a second.
---
People like you are so boring. Stop exaggerating everything and being really anti "sjw" or whatever the shit.
---
It’s not on the live client that we all played last week either.
---
Good job man! 
---
It doesn't look like hunters are as buggy as people say when I watch this vid. How are your experiences with bugs?
---
The utility part actually sounds great...
---
I'll have to research the kinds of buffs they get
---
Blizzard aren't going for any "hype cash" , since it's people who generate this hype themselves just to be disappointed
---
Aside for Lefty, the Gnome Monk, in Theldrin's Arena team.
---
It's because hatred of blood elves to kaldorei when they exiled them.
---
It sucks that that's necessary. I just had a self-deprecating joke downvoted and argued against as if it was a legitimate criticism of myself and my group. Or maybe they thought I wasn't in that group and was directing criticism at them from the outside. Who knows? tl;dr for every joke, there are those who will not get it and get angry.
---
Reddit sucks ballsack man.  So basically, people can't handle opinions of opposing natures, so they are able to report them and eventually get them removed.
---
Yet at the same time, most of the threads being removed are about the same topic, which makes me think there are a lot of people who are on the other side of the fence.
---
ALSO, those threads are always upvoted in the hundreds/thousands.. so you are telling me fewer people can remove a thread even if the majority are fine with it?
---
Yea, sounds fair to me.
---
imagine not knowing what frostmourne is at first glance. why are you even on this subreddit?
---
I once walked in and the boss there nicked my gear.
---
No kidding... kind of sickened by realizing that is what is going on now.  These threads tend to have hundreds, if not thousands of actual upvotes, and it seemingly takes way fewer people reporting it over nothing, just to get them removed?
---
2 overpowers in a row? hmmmmm
---
After few decades you start to understand you cant do shit about stupid people.
---
Dont overdo it aswell. Listen to your body and give it around 48 hours to recover inbetween workout sessions.
---
Hunters have the FD/trap combo. Hard as hell to avoid. If you do manage to anticipate it then getting out of range for an intercept is almost impossible as you are probably wingclipped, plus there’s the fact the hunter won’t leave the trap. Basically the hunter has a free in combat fight reset
---
Haha .. you must be new to Blizzard games. They'll admit it...after 4 years and 2 expansions, when they ruin X more things because you were having fun the wrong way.
---
They are still working on it all, thats what the recent stress test looked at i think, the servers had different population setting i believe, layering isnt finished and shipping as it is now in the beta, blizz seem to still be working on it.
---
Never really got this argument post-BC. Every class was viable in 3's and the game had so many comps.
---
Stam rules. Tunic of Westfall (with stats enchant) is for DPSing VC and WC runs. Also useful when moving through slightly higher level zones to speed up mob kills.
---
Yea, good luck with that.  There is always money behind censorship when it comes to crap like this.  
---
Blizzard is going to do layering.  They want to put on the facade that there is mostly nothing wrong with it.  Their official forums are moderated to oblivion already.  
---
The rest of us never get an actual chance to voice our concerns, and that is how a corporation is going to continue operating in today's age.  Sadly, they count on having some white knights who they will never censor and will likely support as much as possible.
---
Big cope.
---
As for flags not showing in some TBC videos: flags only showed after a certain amount of time passed.
---
Yeah you’ll instead learn about raid times and dates via the guild info tab and most guilds will have a discord channel where they can post a signup page etc.
---
Anyone have any confirmation of guild banks are currently in Classic Beta? Running a guild without them is tough..
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
Thank you! It's so weird to me to see this, right after playing the launch of a fresh private server, where I literally had to go from the Dwarven starting zone all the way to the Troggs in Dun Morogh for a spawn spot that isn't camped.
---
There wasn't a snowball's chance in hell you'd get a mob tag anywhere in the starting zone. It was hilarious and a completely different experience to this, which quite frankly seems rather deserted for a "launch simulation".
---
I am really curious how it will work on actual launch with layering and all. There's something special about seeing 600-1000 people in a starting zone, but that might be an experience we won't get.
---
Yea, becoming increasingly clear that Activision Blizzard is not really treating this as some kind of come back/chance at gaining old trust back. 
---
They are just playing the dirty PR game, and I am sure it will work for their methods of making money.  Spend as little as possible to get a decent burst of revenue, but forsake the longer term of the project (as they have been with everything) as it would cost more money to improve and maintain them.
---
It's like you have just opened the thread, seen the word hunter and then commented.
---
&gt; World buffs were explicitly changed in patch 2.1.0 so that they wouldn't work on targets above level 63. Blizzard realized how broken it would be for people to stomp through the new raids with world buffs stacked to high heaven like that.
---
by that logic they should be limited in classic too.
---
They aren't even hard to get for Alliance.
---
Anything to get more clicks. Please don't share ads.
---
Annnnd there I get the joke....
---
Well it does affect gameplay.  Cone of cold is heavily affected by this, and the same crap is happening in retail currently with ALL cone abilities (such as shockwave).
---
Appreciate everyone's feedback. I'd been reading a lot about its effect, and so many people were arbitrarily inflating the % extra dps from +weapon skill.
---
Same here, but Warlock looks promising

I mean do what you want but I don’t get this. Why would you want someone to give you such a detailed guide for something so basic. Play yourself make your own experience that’s my way at least.
---
But aye if you wanna play WoW on rails go for it
---
I feel like if they prevent layer changing except in rested areas, then it would pretty much eliminate hopping a layer to avoid PVP, or to mine nodes. It puts a bit less pressure on removing it in higher level areas, though I do feel like removing layering asap is necessary. Like even 1 week in.
---
The bugs are pretty bad. One pretty prominent one you can see in here is when I fight baelog. Even tho I’m sending my pet to attack he attacks once and immediately runs off. You can see me spamming attack and trying to fix it with hitting defensive but in the end I had to dismiss and resummon my pet. 
---
Most bugs currently are with pets. When you are killing one mob and send your pet to go attack another, if the previous mob dies before your pet reaches the target the pet will stop in place for about 3-4 seconds then start running back to you.
---
Pretty sure i remember seeing a video of 40 priests killing onyxia, unless memory is failing me

---
Why would they put out phase 2 when most people still haven't hit 60?  Doesn't really make any sense honestly.
---
back in Vanilla (but only the last two months of Vanilla) I started as an UD/WL  and it was cool yet I had no idea of the game in general over the years playing the game taking breaks and playing the game again I realized that the only thing I like is raiding and I moreover I like responsibility therefor i will play Tank and since the only viable Tank is the Warrior I will reroll :D
---
Who killed Draenei? Archimonde and Kil'jaden they sent legion to kill them. Using orcs as their slaves to do job.
---
Zul'steven
---
I fly back from Ireland on the 29th and my mate and I will be spending the week off grinding. Let's just say when the missus found out she booked an extra week in Ireland lol
---
I don't work a job where I have to skin puppies. I have a minimum amount of moral integrity. 
---
Having standards is not the same as envy.
---
Errr, most people are going to need way more than a month to hit 60.   Average is likely going to be what.. 200~ hours?  And that is still way faster than the average back in vanilla which was anywhere from 240-300 depending on class.  
---
Most people are not going to be spending 5+ hours a day grinding it out every single day of the week.  Those people will, of course, exist and they will hit 60 much faster, but they wont be the norm.
---
&gt;Btw, can I stay at your place tonight? My Dad has 'ghost club' in the woods tonight so there's no sheets on my bed.
---
Well of course you can, Ethan. Tommy, you wanna join?
---
Wouldn't have to hate retail if it wasn't so bad.
---
People also take on "playing retail = supporting modern wow gameplay/decisions".  I wouldn't say this is the fault of moderation of subreddit culture as this was a culture war that's been going on and growing  for over ten years.
---
It's up to us to shame those who needlessly shame others for doing the same thing that they themselves love to do.
---
Being drunk actually lowers mobs lvl making it easier to hit them roflmao.
---
Heal sluts have nice asses, what's the problem?
---
The people working on classic are not the ones working on retail.
---
But even if they were, the people doing QA and bugfixes are usually several steps removed from the people making the big design decisions. The people who make those decisions that "ruin" the game, are rarely the ones who pay for it.
---
People like you are so boring. Stop exaggerating everything and being really anti "anything remotely offensive" or whatever the shit.
---
That's an incredibly dumb question but I'll bite:
---
If I want to shape the market as a consumer I pay for products that I like to encourage the market to steer towards such products.
---
Wow classic is amazing and I'd like to see more stuff like it. I can do that while refusing to pay 7.50 to reserve a name and considering that a scummy scam tactic.
---
This may be a bit off topic but I'm hoping someone can answer my question. I've been told about some tanks using intervenercept but can't recall if this was TBC or Vanilla tactic. Also how the hell is it used? I vaguely recall a mention of it being used to avoid a few initial shots when starting a fight but sounds sketchy.
---
This is a change that I welcome. I deleted a level 30 alt before so my new main would be on top.
---
Cool meme
---
There will be no guildbank.
---
Yes.  I’m doing it.  I never played it really.  Only mained horde later in life.  I’m horse now and have been on and off.  To be honest I’ll end up playing both sides at some point.  But yeah.  Ready to immerse
---
This is how you deffend... the middle of the map.
---
Have some cake.
---
While I agree it might not be massively hard, I would still say it's 10x harder than any of the other vanilla dps specs, perhaps with powershifting ferals as the exception.
---
!RemindMe 4 months "laugh at this post"
---
I'm having the exact same conundrum but lifelong Horde player thinking about playing Alliance. I like the idea of experiencing zones actually for the first time but know I'll feel like a traitor if I do :/ afraid I have no answer for you!
---
Since i've already taken time off, I'm happy to deal with a few bugs so long as I can have that delicious melty classic goodness

Sounds like you might enjoy twinking.
---
Love to see epic gamers fight for the right to say the N-word. Seriously, out of everything to be nostalgic for you chuds choose barrens chat. Lol.
---
but almost no retail players put down anyone. it's just a few, so why put down all retail players?
---
Haha, yeah I remember seeing it. Serious dedication to the craft.
---
Oh god really? Night elf males are the worst looking characters imo
---
Apparently some of the bugs were also bugs in Legion (what classic was forked from) and they still haven't been fixed there. I'm not very optimistic Blizzard will fix it. There was a post yesterday outline 49 bugs that pretty much entirely break hunters.
---
MC/Ony were in at launch.
---
Tbf, rolling ignites is usually handled by the classleader, no?
---
The items in early patches were completely differently itemized, and talents of all classes were completely different as well, so it wasn’t that they didn’t know (after all it takes like 5 minute to check which stats is better by dueling someone, for healing items you do not even need to duel anyone). 
---
The early players of wow were mostly experienced mmo players from games like Everquest and more nerdy than the average private server neckbeards. I am sure they theorycrafted from the first second they got a new item.
---
If people wanted to get fit they would go to the gym. But actually they want to play wow so please don't. Also what's the reason for wanting to be fit? Being more healthy? Lool ya drinking protein shakes 3 times a day sounds like a healthy diet. What a joke.
---
Before you start calling me fat just don't. I'm a Marathon runner. But when I play wow I just play wow ffs. And please, your training plan is suicide the amount of DOMS you'll get from these especially for untrained people is ridiculous if not dangerous.
---
Yes I do encourage people to exercise. But not like this. Start gradually and avoid supplementary food. Focus on how you do your groceries do some research and you'll be fine.
---
I hope Hunters are a broken mess at launch. I'll play a hunter anyway. The fewer people playing your class makes you all the more valuable!
---
Huh? No, I think you misunderstood me. We shouldn't shame retail players and we should shame the people shaming them.
---
Until Day 2 when you log back in ready to hit level 10 and get out of the starting zone, and suddenly the place is filled with dozens of L60s...
---
Honestly, so much fuss over layering acting it like it will be a permanent issue. It will only be for the first phase max, could be disabled earlier or irrelevant if there isn't enough people to fill the prime layer before needing to add a second layer.
---
That everyone on the same level thing isn't going to last more than the first few days. Heck, a shit ton of people are going to have MC/BWL on farm in the first month If the expectations from all of the guild appsI've seen are to be believed. High school me could keep up, 8-4 me can't. Going to have to find an old people's raid group.
---
There is a trinked from maraudon that removes poisen.
---
You didn't have to click the post
---
This is a big thing that people don't seem to remember. Sure there is players who just quit Classic after a while but mostly we just don't see people online all the time. At release people are super exited and want to spend 24/7 with game. After some time people start playing other games as well and come to Classic every now and then. 90% people are just not going to quit but instead they are not playing WoW every single day.
---
You can't jump out of water when you've bound jump to your mousewheel. You can swim up by jumping but once you reach the surface you can't jump anymore which was annoying in pvp but also on the fish boss in TBC.
---
I submitted many other bugs that didn't get fixed but didn't persist on them, the jumping one was a pet peeve of mine.
---
Thats literally what you said, but i love the argumentum ad hominem when you have no counter arguments, really makes you look smart ironically hahaahahah

I completely forgot about core hound tooth. Super simple design but so good.
---
Fuaaaark
---
I honestly think it's far more insulting to black people to remove it. As if they're so fragile we can't even have items in a video game sound slightly homophonic to a "bad word". I feel like that sentiment is far more racist than any joke, even mean-spirited ones, will ever be. 
---
Should we remove any item named "Cracker" in the game next?
---
I finish a month off work 2 days before classic launches :'(
---
Apparently some of the bugs were also bugs in Legion (what classic was forked from) and they still haven't been fixed there. I'm not very optimistic Blizzard will fix it. There was a post yesterday outlining 49 bugs that pretty much entirely break hunters.
---
&gt; Damn i gues i roll a mage instead then.
---
[You might want to watch this...](https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentGrotesqueMallardYouWHY)
---
They've said that most UI "improvements" will not be removed. This is one of the things that is in the beta and it'll stay.
---
i can't wait to be shaped by all these single husky dudes
---
Mouth breather
---
According to her bio, she can't bring major changes to the timeline. However she can do small things like with Captain Joseph Redpath. 
---
Poor guy died trying to defend Darrowshire from the scourge and got turned into an undead, but everybody remembered him as a traitor who turned against his own people. 
---
When Chromie discovered the truth, she sent adventurers back in time right in the battle of Darrowshire. She didn't change the outcome of the battle nor saved Joseph but now everybody remember him as the hero he was, not a traitor.
---
BUT DUDE, OP is saying it will ruin our lives to roll hunter and has been ruining lives of players for the past 15 years already, what are we gonna do??
---
My bank alt.
---
Second will be a female Tauren rest shaman because why the fuck not?
---
Weren't hunters buggy as shit when vanilla launched originally? #nochanges
---
&gt;companies get more value out of their employees
---
This is BS. It's well know since the Ford studies, when you raise hours worked above 40 hours per week, you gain productivity for 2 weeks, then it crashes so hard that it erases all the gains.
---
This is especially true for "mind" work like software dev. When you're tired you produce more bugs and invent less clever solutions.
---
I have the same problem as you. Long time Alliance player but Ive encountered NO ONE irl that will be playing Alliance. Im in a pickle with which to choose
---
Oh the pearl clutching, what will the world do now that you can't express yourself as a cryptofacist, oh the humanity.
---
By the end of vanilla we were bringing in ALTs and randoms from IF for the eye ^^
---
The fact a comment like this gets downvoted is why I'm happily staying away from this subreddit. I'm gonna play a hunter too regardless. All the bitter people saying these bugs won't be looked at in the two months we have left blows my mind how salty people get. You do you, man!
---
I'm not so sure. 8.2 is out in like.. a day. Would they want to entice people over to the classic beta at the moment? (I don't know).
---
Wait for him outside the WSG portal with my Shadowcraft geared rogue and backstab him then get jumped by 6 R14s
---
Where is the proof for this, so many reasons why FD wouldnt work or put you right back into combat.
---
God damn I spelt the title wrong...
---
Maybe the solution would be to hire more people to work on it then. WoW has generates an overwhelming amount of money over the years, likely more than any other computer game that I am aware of. I could understand Blizzard as a small independent company having issues hitting release dates, but that was because they were small, underfunded, and unwilling to put out a pile of shit. Blizzard was sold to a dogshit company, and has since been a dogshit franchise in all categories aside from original wow. I have zero sympathy for the devs of this game at any tier. 
---
On the day Classic WoW is released all problems should be fixes, no fucking excuses. If the problems persist the playerbase will poof very quickly. If this was a free to play option and it had issues on release, then that is one thing. But they are spending a lot of money spreading the word about Classic Wow implying that it is ready for release. 
---
Devs that work for this company need to be working around the clock figuring it out, otherwise they need to quit and find another job or go on strike until activision decides they want to splurge the extra cash to bring in more developers, which I assure you they have the money to do. 
---
Zero sympathy from me. If Classic WoW fails, it will be the final nail in the coffin for this once great franchise. It's sad because I loved this game in it's original state and it broke my heart watching all the awful garbage they implemented. Sometimes less is more.
---
Oh here’s another one ready to rise up, it’s just a word bro cracker is just as hurtful let’s rise up
---
Definitely play how you want but there's no shame in content for those who also themselves decide to play hardcore either.
---
fair, I suppose I should word it "companies **perceive** more value out of their employees"
---
alright settle down there buddy
---
Why did you make a new account just for this?
---
Yeah I mean every other generation got to say it why can’t we?! Rise up!
---
Let's be real.  Vanilla wow was a hot turd at launch.  We just didn't know it at the time.
---
tbc was a far better designed game.
---
I think it was used in both - although I believe it was TBC that added intervene to the game which functioned offensively and defensively.
---
There’s a lot of ways for it to be functional. For instance, in a dungeon if a caster pulls aggro, you can intercept the mob and close the gap straight away. 
---
You’ll need to be able to stance dance efficiently if you want to be a “good” tank. 
---
Tactical mastery is your friend here.
---
It's the case in a lot of brackets tbf. I had a 29 rogue that I later moved to 39, got myself BiS agility sets and BiS stamina sets and the damage difference was negligible but the survival was not.
---
Again with the downvotes, unreal this community. This is a perfectly fine comment. I'm in agreement with you.
---
I get it. Thanks for correcting me.
---
That’s it bro, R I S E  U P
---
How about the rez sickness only challenge
---
Destroy his waxed elven butthole with my thick and juicy Orc mace.
---
That’s actually part of what I’m looking forward to. The mad rush as everyone tries to turn in that first quest.
---
Nice clickbait title
---
&gt; yeah we need one permanent bugs megathread and direct ppl to post there. SINCE IT'S BETA ANYWAY.
---
We don't have one right now, and there have already been numerous complaints about it being removed.
---
Who peed in your Cheerios today?
---
I love how disagreeing with something automatically means I’m a shill. Go back to your pserver.
---
You know that I’m in the beta right, so don’t pull assumptions.
---
I’m switching from horde to alliance I feel like it’ll give me a rejuvenated experience. There are a tons of zones I haven’t ever really explored or done quests in. New cities to learn and npcs to meet. Also cause I wanna play Paladin
---
This sub in a nutshell.
---
It's a 3min CD isn't it?  How bad can it be?
---
human sort of sucks for casters but tbh i doubt anyone will give a shit
---
the racials are slightly more important for priests and melee but casters who cares
---
like the gnome 5% mana is so trivial of a difference it really does not matter
---
True. since OP mentioned BC  i was mainly refering to that, were there were a lot of classes (not rogue) were rather limited in their team choices.
---
So they played the few comps that worked and there is nothing wrong with that.
---
Wrong.
---
Rather have bugs because I got 2 weeks of work. A delayed release would screw me over big time.
---
&gt;make a serious attempt at grinding the deathcharger mount in strat dead
---
It has been discussed previously. There was a video on YT of a guy having his own pserver chain killing the baron, just watch it before you dream too much about this mount.
---
The drop rate of this thing is so low that it's absolutely unfarmable !
---
You would need to make thousands of runs without even a guarantee (or you could just get it on your first run).
---
The fact that you can't jump in R6 infuriates me.
---
But if literally 40% of the posts are about it, maybe thats a real issue. I get that it's tiring to hear the same posts, but we had the same situation with loot trading. What if r/classicwow banned all loot trading posts and we never got to the compromise we have today?
---
When almost half the posts are about an issue, thats because people are concerned. It's almost like an illusion that everybody is totally cool with it because 99% of the layering threads are banned.
---
This would be good if there were an addon that made you drink if not tipsy
---
Currently level 117. That just sounds so wrong to say.
---
Because of the ability weapon speed normalization that came in patch 1.8 (Classic Beta is using the word formula right now) This axe is very good on 2h shamans and paladins, still good on warriors too, but not so much.
---
You can't overpower on a miss.
---
yeah im wrong
---
Classico has no banko, por favor
---
There has never been Finnish servers. Still for years Stormreaver-EU in retail has been kinda Finnish server. 90% of all trade chat and guild recruitment happens in Finnish. So I am pretty sure that if they don't change their mind with regional servers there will be unofficial ones.
---
Skirmishes were the best iteration arenas had in the game and were present in classic in the pre-patch.
---
It was just 100% e-peening without rewards. Simply showing who's king.
---
I'd like to see this come back in classic+ when content is released.
---
But no rewards, especially no gear, else it has to be balanced for the 3v3 minigame that is arenas today.
---
You’re ignoring every part of my comment that doesn’t align with your delusions
---
Someone link that Tooth artwork with the Gnome girl mage vs dinosaurs in Un'goro!
---
Those are actually pretty fly nice work
---
I was pinging between warlock and hunter as my farm alt, now I got the decision made for me!
---
Thank you Blizz...?
---
There should be addons, that do that
---
That one level from 29 to 30 and 39 to 40 is a big difference believe it or not. Also it's like a whole server of twinks and you can do higher level dungeons without oopsy leveling. 
---
We spent 6 hours farming essence of undeath for my gnomish deathray for example...against 58 Elites. Also ZF, mara, st, and hinterlands quests at 40 for BIS.  It's all been a blast tbh up until things died off. Found some bugs had some fun
---
After regaining control of my old account. (I thought I lost it but before the stress test i tried a bunch of old email/password combos and eventually got it right.) 
---
 I played around with old characters and it was nostalgic but retail doesn’t do it for me. 
---
I’m excited for the talent tree and leveling and building stats and gearing up for raiding. Meeting people and interacting with the economy. Retail really doesn’t have any of that anymore
---
Yeah the mount isn't a big priority for me but I will likely waste my time eventually and count my strat dead runs, to a certain point. Can't win if you don't play!
---
Skirmishes were a lot of fun in the pre-patch.
---
I'd like to see them again at some point.
---
Reddit is a circle jerk by its very nature. The upvote system pretty much ensures it. Most people don't want their karma nuked stating an unpopular opinion.
---
I've tried opening up a couple discussions on layering. Not even "MY IDEA FOR LAYERING!" or "WTF BLIZZ" posts, but just general discussion on the topic. And four out of five times, it gets deleted for [low-effort content]. Even when you take the time to articulate what you're trying to say its low effort. It wouldn't even be so weird if they just said "nope, no more of these layer posts, new rule." But at the moment they just tell you to use a day old thread buried in the fourth page of Reddit to have a discussion about something on a forum...
---
Trying to farm (eg tyrs hand) at the same time as the other faction = escalating fights
---
[http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
Vanilla was not the best time of wow simply because it didn't have the jump statistics /s
---
We had weekly raids on Grom'gol with shamans sitting on the watch towers shooting chain lightnings into the midst of us.
---
Every sunday evening stv and other parts of the world were mayhem on my server (Kel'thuzad - german realm).
---
They were making changes to the right click menu to remove the reporting feature.  It is much easier for them to just make a second change while under the hood (so to speak) than to open and modify a separate area of the game.
---
Horde has a large Asian guild on it called &lt;Brother&gt; they might be that bump
---
You should read up on Warcraft 3
---
So does this mean that discussing layering on this subreddit is not allowed?
---
@MrPeaky I'm late replying to this, but are you planning on using Isboxer as your multiboxing program?
---
I'm completely against mods banning a classic related topic at large... but damn, do you have to respond like an asshole?
---
Not sure if this counts, but the stereotypical Night Elf Male Hunter, is too tall to fit through 90% of doors on their mount.
---
&gt; they probably can't even take out sharding
---
As an RP server player in BFA...  wut.
---
Welcome to dungeons, drive ins and dives!
---
*y‘all
---
Acting like if a real world general didn't have the ability to use special bullets that instead of outright killing enemies made them friendly to their cause they wouldn't be all over that like flies on shit. If such a thing existed here there would be world wars within weeks as countries desperately tried to convert anyone they could.
---
Is it the same though?
---
We've been actively combating that attitude for the last two years. We don't care about retail, I don't think any of us are actually playing BfA, and we don't want to moderate a subreddit where people spend more time shitting on another game than they do talking about the game the subreddit is devoted to. If that's the subreddit people want to post in, I'd implore them to make /r/wowsucks and have fun. 
---
However. What we try very hard not to do is police opinions, you can post and say 'I hate layering', 'I love layering', 'Add guild banks', 'Remove Gnomes from the game' and we won't touch it (unless it's obviously a troll post - and if it was removed wrongly). 
---
We set out what conversations are welcome here as threads in the rules (It has to be about Classic, it shouldn't be a reposted topic, etc, etc) but if the conversation goes off course we don't tend to purge it unless it breaks one of the other rules (Politics, witch hunting, encouraging cheating, etc). If someone says 'I love this about Classic' and makes a thread along those lines, and someone else says in the comments of that thread 'I love this too, and it's why retail sucks' we're not going to remove that.
---
Mythics give me the slight hint of the old days of people begging for a summon from the warlock because they're too lazy to run.
---
Its annoying, its a disadvantage to be sure, but it isn't so awful that it can't be overcome. You have death coil which your primary way of trying to skirt the fear issue with Undead enemies.  
---
Its mostly a bitch when you're taken by surprise. Beyond that its just a mild irritant.
---
Not true at all. Trolls put out tons of threat with their racial. Doesn't have to be TF. Daggers, Ironfoe, ED lots of good weaps.
---
I start my honeymoon the day before launch. RIP
---
I would start with this:

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0bZVZEizseMzVo
---
When you enter BWL and might want imp shield wall for vael, broodlord and chromagus I would swap out 2 points from imp taunt (or revenge) Keep in mind that imp revenge prices gives you a slight increase to threat, even on immune mobs.
---
When you start gearing for threat and got a fair amount of crit I'd go for:

This is what I needed! Thanks a ton, and stance dancing is almost the only reason I play warrior, so satisfying for me personally. That being said when I fuck it up it goes downhill so...so rapidly.
---
When sylvyanas ambushed him outside lordareon he was nerfed because the FT had been damaged due to illidan and his spell so his powers were literally being drained. I've played the campaign like a dozen times each.
---
There's been a druid only guild since Vanilla. Why stop at one race when you can just go one class?
---
Hmmm, my 2 cent : if you want to burn calories in the right way you have to run and lift as well. I literally eat whatever I want whenever I want and I don't get fat. For me, it's like 60% work out, 20% diet, and the other 20% is getting laid and having a decent sleep every night.
---
You should be more worried that it has only three charges, meaning you would have to farm it multiple times for each raid.
---
Meh. I compared hunter's T0 vs pre-bis.
---
Yes pre-bis is a bit better, but not game changingly better.
---

---
Your prayers have been answered.
---
Many classes has abilities that make it easy to get out of combat, so it’s not that simple unfortunately.
---
I'm taking a different approach to classic, so I can't really say much in regards to your issues honestly. Not that they don't matter to me, but I see things in a different manner. I don't have as much free time anymore, so my approach to classic is strictly casual. Moreso than that I've made it a personal goal to take my time and enjoy the content more than I did the first time as well.
---
I understand your concerns and the frustration that it must cause being in that kind of a position. I am competitive myself, and I could easily get tangled up in worrying about being left behind server launch and how it would affect my enjoyment and experience overall. I don't really have any greater solution however. Except maybe to say that we should try to search deep to find not just the meaning of our enjoyment, but where that meaning comes from. Maybe in doing so, we can understand better what we find important and different ways to focus our ambitions and enthusiasm in ways that could possibly bring us more enjoyment overall.
---
&gt; This is also a pretty sick video in general. Clicking hunter keyboard turns and wrecks people to Breaking Benjamin. Incredible.
---
peak vanilla, truly
---
PC were crap and internet connections were crap too.
---
There are a lot of people that were raiding or entering big cities with the camera focused on the ground to get something like 6 FPS.
---
By leveling up to 30 you will risk a burn out during release. Because you brain will say "Oh no, not this again".
---
Druids are offtanks, so it's not like you are pulling every boss.  Any fight where you aren't pulling, then you don't want to use it, because you can easily maintain 2nd threat without it.
---
Gonna address a few of the comments here.
---
100% Blizzard has not installed any sort of moderators that are paid or compensated to defend Blizzard. The company can go f*** itself for all I care, I just want a god damned good version of Classic with as few changes as possible. I'll repeat what I've said before that I think layering sucks and especially in its current form seems quite abusable which makes it suck more. For the people in the back: I've been a mod here for over a year and I think **layering is a fucking awful idea.**.
---
Beyond that, we have *always* tried to remove posts that come up that are highly repetitive/reposts. This includes asking the same boring question (usually directed to Simple Question Sunday) or, more recently, the recent rise of "Layering sucks" or "Guys, we NEED layering" without any new or significant discussion.
---
However, I can see how we may be too aggressive with removals lately - this isn't by any means to hide layering or to defend Blizzard (see first paragraph). It's to not have a flood of the same repetitive posts coming through moreso than we already have. Either way, we discuss literally multiple times a week in our Discord about whether we're overmoderating, undermoderating, or moderating just right. We hear the concerns and try to adjust as we go, but since there's a team of us, we don't always get on board at exactly the same time, no do we make decisions instantly since we try to get several mods to provide input before adjusting how we go about moderating.
---
Someone said we "encouraged a subreddit culture of hating retail WoW" but I disagree - we *constantly* remove circlejerk/shitposts that serve no purpose but to crap on r/wow or retail. I actually like modern WoW to an extent, but I don't believe any of the other mods play modern WoW. Regardless, we have no interest in circlejerks and will continue to enforce removal of that when we see it (which often relies on people to report it).
---
Right now, we're discussing two or three majors concerns about our moderating:
---
1) Are we not harsh enough on shitty memes? If we change our moderating of memes, it will be to be harsher on them - especially label memes. We have no plans to allow even more low-effort memes through.
---
2) Should we let people repost the same (almost word-for-word) text post/question, or remove it and tell them to discuss it in an existing thread / ask in Simple Question Sunday?
---
3) How should our moderation practices change closer to / during launch?
---
Please ModMail us your thoughts, or talk to us on the r/classicwow Discord (especially in the #community-meta channel).
---
I'm traveling right now, but if you comment to this comment, I'll try to reply when I can.
---
Someone did the math and normalized "mobs your level" needed to kill to get next level and halfwya was like 44.
---
I never said I thought you weren't just that everyone already knows this. It has become a standard response to any criticism of how the beta is being run.

---
Shhh, don't let them know then I won't get taken raiding.
---
By WoW standards, 2-3 months is 'fairly quick'.  Most major patch cycles (X.0-X.1) are about 5 months, with X.1.5 being around 3 months.  So, for WoW, 3 months would be around their normal timeline for 'minor' content releases since P2 is just DM and World Bosses.
---
This is just objectively wrong. If you’re a casual and it won’t affect you, that’s fine. Logging onto Reddit to spread misinformation isn’t
---
Dude like I said your just trying to pick a fight about vanilla with someone who likes vanilla.  Go elsewhere.  It was fun for a bit but I'm not looking for discussion with someone who has an axe to grind.  I'd rather have a discussion with someone who wants a discussion.
---
Why an I crying in the inn right now
---
BWL on farm in a month? Think you might just be underestimating the gearing aspect of the game. 
---
You will need extreme dedication and Method level like preparation and coordination for that to happen. I seriously doubt a “shit ton” of people will have that on content that A: was already cleared and B: from a playerbase that will mainly consist of grown ups with other priorities in life.
---
Well truth is hard when you don't like it. He should have guarded his health and not risk it.
---
Source on that?
---
Male Nelf rogue was my first character, I thought they looked really cool and badass as a kid. I have a fond nostalgia for them
---
The fact that its gonna be a fresh launch is what makes it extremely fun
---
Holy shit, I forgot that was a spell
---
Perhaps it was like that for the US but not for the EU. I had 10ms on private and 150ms in Vanilla. Lag was definitely a big issue, it was the mainreason why I was swords on my rogue and not daggers.
---
https://i.imgur.com/2279QVV.jpg This was during Vanilla, you can see the MS on the top : 181ms 
---
Looking at my other screens it seemed like 150 would be a good average, it never dropped below 100 in a raid and went up to 220.
---
Moderating is great here. Please don't kill the memes. People who disagree can go to the WoW Wikipedia page.
---
I believe I've read somewhere that for levelling a fast 1-h and shield earthbiter is also better than a WF + any speed at basically all stages, your DPS is slightly lower but your survivability goes way up so you stop less and will farm faster.
---
4 days in there will be level 60’s everywhere
---
Nice work!  Dysphoria's vids were what made me reroll as hunter when TBC came out, and why I'll be playing one in classic.  Can't wait to try some of these runs out.
---
Your’e horse now. Is this something I should worry about?
---
That's what I'm going to do. I'm also gonna try my hand at playing a priest or shaman, since those are two classes I've never really played before. I want to keep my Classic experience as fresh and adventurous as possible.
---
gotta get out asap to get ahead
---
There is something about the warcraft humans vs orcs box art that just makes me so nostalgic.
---
BWL doesn't release til phase 3 lol and majority of guild ads I've seen are try hard all think they'll be 60 in 4 days played and have world firsts
---
My only problem with the memes is they are insanely repetitive.
---
You nutters are the ones spreading misinformation about how easy it is to change layers, how it will destroy pvp, and the economy.  You people don't even understand the system.
---
Paladins can't use staves
---
LOL
---
They might do if they know 8.2 is going to be shit.
---
I wish I knew how to ignore him but I don't find the option anywhere (new to reddit).
---
Wait until you find out that Chuck Norris *is* your mom.
---
Yep and batching should have been left out too.
---
I mean it also increases crit chance by 1% per 60 which is the equivalent of wearing a second belt gloves or bracer. So it's not totally trivial.
---
This! The feeling of completely starting fresh is so freakin exciting. You also cant compare it to just a new expansion, because there is no previous content.
---
And the other big thing is, you dont have the problem of the server getting shut down (like on private servers).
---
&gt; The mods have encouraged a subreddit culture of hating retail WoW and retail WoW players. 
---
I agree that this is the case and this is bad. But saying it's bad without understanding why it happened doesn't help solving it.
---
In this case the reason was top-down communication from Blizzard (You think you do, but you don't), direct action against Nost and a long silence after that. I understand that many people are butthurt to the max and lash out. I maybe would too if I wouldn't have had a pretty good time in Legion.
---
IMHO the solution is to promote the incredible transparency and willingness to change some of Blizzard since the Classic announcement. It's pretty unprecedented for a publically held company to do that. It's also a massive investment that already paid off in the very positive sentiment of much of the community. You should focus on expanding that part and passively convert people instead of saying
---
&gt; culture of hating retail WoW and retail WoW players.
---
Again: it's not wrong. But it also isn't part of the solution. Most of us just want to become the game the best version it can be. That passion is sometimes misguided, but it's still passion. You know what would be absolutely terrifying? People only posting memes and cosplays like in /r/wow. I mean more power to them and it's really funny and cool at times. But it's stuff orthogonal to the game and if posts are only that, it means the game is stale.
---
Amen !

Switching from ally to horse. So ready to embrace a whole new side of this game. It’s the perfect time to switch!
---
Laugh again because he is a night elf.
---
The color looks wrong? Looks similar to a green sword you got from Un'Goro?
---
What point? Paladins and warlocks get a free mount at their class trainer at lvl 40. It costs like 1g to learn. Nobody is talking about epic mounts here. 
---
With epic mounts, you are correct, they will be added in phase 2, as in the original game, they arrived with dire maul in patch 1.3
---
No, and the official forums are removing most posts pointing out potential issues and abuse with layering or asking for clarification on how they would like to see it work optimally.
---
This is honestly looking more and more like beta's for other recent expansions. Doubt they'll ever remove layering at all, its good for cost-cutting which is what the people holding leading positions at blizzard are all about. It's gonna work too, by the time people realize it's never gonna be removed most people will be far too invested in their characters to quit solely because of that. 
---
They'll probably just make it a less intrusive version of sharding with higher player caps due too less data needing to be processed by the server per character compared to modern.

No way I'm gonna survive OG to Tanaris xD
---
I would expect most of the problems regarding layering technology to manifest themselves in the beta. Perhaps most of these situations will be fixed or circumvented before launch.   
---
Not to mention that Ion nicely explained how the layering tech is going to work, and how it's going to be scaled down to one layer, in the video interview from about a month ago.
---
Stranglethorn Vale for sure. That zone just has so much going on, and so many quests to complete... Plus the wpvp! So much fun.

What........ every single of my comments has been calm and rational. What on earth are you on about? Do you think I’m someone else?
---
 Can we please start a guild called the geriatric ward
---
I had that on my 2-h enhancement shaman. She was a beast and would cut gnomes in half in PVP when WF proc’d. I still have it in the bank. I can’t wait to farm that axe again 😊😊
---
Well, there will be still one if you're alliance and you're willing to grind for ages. WS saber is armorless.
---
Ca ... casuals ? Ewww gross !
---
For the record there is barely any content for the first phase or two so the bugs will likely be fixed at least by BWL.
---
Human isn't great for PvP in vanilla. Gnome is the best alliance race for it to compare to on the horde.
---
I really don’t think thats an unpopular opinion mate
---
&gt; Layering is an absolute necessity for launch to not be a complete shit show.
---
nope, just wait in a queue, join another lower pop server if you can't handle lots of other players ruining your precious fun or just wait out the launch for a week or 2 (kinda like everyone who played every expansion ever) lots of suggestions, none require layering, stop slurping up the diarrhea blizzard are squatting out. 
---
You are acting like an mmo has never launched before and the world will end if people can't log in reeeeeeeeeeeeee.
---
&gt; if I don’t pee pure clear I feel like I’m letting myself down
---
I am no scientist or doctor, but IIRC "peeing pure clear" can be a bad thing. There's such a thing as drinking _too_ much water.
---
Spoke like a true NE huntard, now roll need on that shield
---
Prebis shoulders are truestrike ones from UBRS kappa
---
This makes me feel very elite for sitting in EU, not having any streaming audience an still having got beta access.
---
Insert tauren leeway here, basicly you can blink and tauren will stilll hit you
---
Easy enough to do. It’s how we used to roll. Particularly if it was a decent upgrade.
---
I think undead raid can work well 2. trolls also and humans. When I think about it except of paladin is there a roll troll can‘t do? They basically cover all of the horde
---
Yeah, there's a downvote button for that.
---
I will play as downvote.
---
For real. Minimum play time for just hitting 60 is like 6 days. People will be 60 in the first two weeks but gearing up a whole raid takes time. I can see a world first Mc clear within a month of release though.
---
Everywhere seems very unlikely. And even then, if they rush 60, they'll likely be well behind on gear. Gearing in vanilla was so much harder.
---
Run away little girl, run away!
---
Right??? I feel like it was one month ago when I saw the „70 days“-post. Now its 65
---
Just stop
---
Even if it was, some people don't spend all their time in this Reddit? :P
---
Ghost Club using bed sheets. Aka the KKK.
---
thank you for the reply.  that is good to hear.
---
It is. 90% of the people arguing about layering vs no layering, there are tons of bugs that probably wont be fixed and many also says vanilla will just lose 70-80% of the populazion in the first phasr
---
OMG! Thanks! It's even EU!
---
Phase 2 isn't a big phase, it's honor, dm and two world bosses... I can see them doing it in 2 months
---
Seems like an unpopular opinion with all the bullshit in this sub.
---
If you're OK with farming, then no problem. One video I tend to think about when this topic arises is  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWQ6ucy-QEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWQ6ucy-QEk) 
---
The video is certainly useful info for anyone considering feral raiding but particularly those wanting to DPS...if they are concerned with keeping up with the best DPS class/specs.
---
n00b.
---
Like a wise man said “He’s speaking the language of the Gods”
---
Yes, you still can find both on YouTube.
---
thx I will watch this.
---
What are they even doing? Hunter has still bfa mechanics, server lags just like in bfa, layering doesnt work as intended, instead of fixing bugs they keep inventing new problems, their decisions are outright moronic. Meanwhile other people are doing better job for free. Zero symphathy with these clowns.
---
77 days was legions patch cycle,  I can see them dropping phase 2 77 days after launch
---
Not true. I hear podcasts all the time from classic developers etc. and their main worry was lack of content at all times.
---
To the point where they made MC so hard that people thought it was literally bugged, and there were rumours that the raid would only be able to be cleared once they increased the cap to lvl 70.
---

This comment got me all kinds of chuckling

Record for 60 is under 5 days btw.

My sub has been inactive since cata.

---
Invite in the mail after less than a week.
---
Conclusion: Blizz aren't only inviting long time subs.
---
As for the keys idea, that's so bad it beggars belief. The notion that anyone whinging at a streamer for entry would be worth a damn for testing is laughable, we've already seen how appalling the sycophant train is with current numbers.
---
Human sucks for any PVP.  Gnome and dwarf are best for alliance pvp.  
---
Gnome is also best for casters. 
---
So gnome warlock is bis in both aspects.
---
I believe they're pretty lax about invites too
---
Time for a quick divorce :P
---
Just take it for what it is. It’s the first “official” server like this, no matter how it is it will be close enough and good enough for me. I’m excited
---
&gt; including a popular post with a 10 minute video showing many instances of layering bugs.
---
I just spoke to /u/Meoang who removed it, they thought it was a repost at first but realised they were mistaken and have now re-approved it. We do make mistakes, send us a modmail if your post was removed in error, it does happen, we're only human/troll/orc/dwarf. 
---
&gt; a low effort meme while this remains up.
---
Our rules about what memes are and are not allowed were written due to feedback from the community. In the run up to BlizzCon last year with a drought of things to talk about all we had were barely relevant memes being posted, and drowning out any opportunity for discussion. The reason we only allow a higher quality of memes is to enable that discussion, the same discussion that you are accusing us of deleting. 
---
I'm well on team #banthememes, but the post you linked falls perfectly within our rules as written. See the [long form rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/rules) if there is any confusion or ambiguity. They are written as they are to cover as many cases as possible. 
---
&gt;  since mine includes many carefully selected screenshots and formatting.
---
However nothing about it is directly from Classic. We do not allow memes about streamers, they are not Classic, we don't allow memes where a single Classic related word is pasted over unrelated images, either. Whilst I feel this is adequately apparent, I will go through Rule 7 in the long form rules and try to be more specific, but the short form sidebar rules will stay the same as there isn't room to expand Rule 7 and elaborate.
---
&gt; When you are deleting 39% of your users' threads there is a problem somewhere.
---
Take a look through those removed posts, because genuinely I don't see a problem. A lot of them are recruitment posts, which are redirected to LFG Monday - is that the quality content we want? Many of them are completely non-relevant memes (lifted from Google Image search with a Classic title), which do nothing to discuss Classic in the slightest. One of those discussions was literally a cartoon picture of a dead horse, that's not valuable discussion being lost. 
---
There are dozens upon dozens of constantly reposted topics. How many threads do we need saying 'my single-sentence solution to layering' that present the exact same solution we've seen on a daily basis in at least 140 characters or less? (I know it's 140 characters or less, because it's setting off numerous filters - significantly longer posts get auto-approved, because they actually have content to discuss) Do we want a daily reminder that vanillafriends.com is a great website and it exists? (And it totally is a great website - hence it being included in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/discords)) Do we need 5 posts for each video that gets posted? When TipsOut still did YouTube content with every video he put up there'd be 5-6 links to it before he got around to posting it himself, as much as it was funny to tell him he can't post his own things because it's a repost it accounted for removing 5 things for the 1 thing kept. 
---
Yes, we remove a lot, and we also remove things by mistake, however the vast majority probably aren't removed by mistake - take a look at the notabug list, most of them really weren't appropriate to be posted here, and despite what you say most people really don't read the rules. If they are removed and you don't think it was appropriate, send us a modmail, we often over turn things because when you're going through a queue of up to 100 posts at a time you can sometimes make the wrong call, and fairly often Automoderator hits something it shouldn't. There's a reason we link to the modmail in our removal message.
---
What other people said, but you might alsl be able to Sell/trade lvl 30+ skins to a lw creating stuff for mount
---
He also didn't eat 12k calories. He debunked that myth, stating that he still ate a lot - which was between 8k-10k. It was also during the 2008 Summer Olympics, where he competed in (I believe) 8 different events. 
---
He _had_ to chomp down a lot of food because his body needed that energy for him to be able to perform at the highest level.
---
It took top level guilds 154 days to kill Rag the first time, I don't think it's going to be on farm in a month.
---
Did Ion say 10,000 people had access to the beta?
---
I was thinking average, even for people really pushing for 60 early. But yeah, that’s straight up world record fast.
---
It's hard to develop the meta because private servers have going at it for years, however I'll say there are ALWAYS meta changes even without "number changes" or skill changes in the game.
---
I’m in the same boat as you lol I saw dysphorias videos near the end of vanilla and swapped from playing my shaman to hunter and just tried to solo anything I could
---
SHOTS FIRED
---
There is little to no way they step on the toes of 8.2 just cuz. The next big thing for classic will be in July, zero doubt about it. Best guess would be a completely open stress test, build hype just a month before launch and get tons of usefully data? Sounds like a win win to me
---
And now this is deleted lol.
---
friendships will be forged and rivalries will made; it's going to be great!
---
that would be cool
---
I have no doubt that Classic will succeed even with layering or after brief period of it. OldSchool RS is still going strong after 5+ years of different design philosophy. But it's not the game design that I loved from 2004-2007 era.
---
WoW devs could make decisions from the original design standpoint that *were never made*, but instead they choose to make those same decisions that logically lead to the current timeline of WoW. For example: people are discussing whether to add more instances/raids to Vanilla - that's the design philosophy that lead to current dungeon/raid tier model. If new content was to be developed, they could choose *the other way*, i.e. to not add instances but more open world with increased realm pop.
---
Never heard it used that way, but okay.
---
On a private server, where xp gain is noticeably faster than has been observed in the beta.
---
Why spend millions on development and risk ruining it when you can just reuse TBC and make some simply cash
---
&gt; MC/BWL on farm in the first month 
---
What in the fuck are you smoking?
---
Well, if you wanna sit in queue all day @phase2, then go ahead an join the streamers realm...
---
Don't need it with the dual +15 agi enchants

Let's just get the game out first shall we, there's no rush.
---
/r/classicwowplus/
---
You would prefer an unplayable state more than a suboptimal state?
---
Because youre an industry leading company and have the core values of classic in mind. While tbc is the easy route theres alot of easy routes that arent always the best, not bad but not the best.
---
I played vanilla on a small laptop with like 200 ui addons on it. This time I don‘t go into that kind of stress so I will play with the default one. Tbh its kinda pretty (:
---
This is awesome, good job man.
---
Hey you forgot to shit on retail in your post. /s
---
Bro if you get jumped by 6 R14s you REALLY pissed some people off
---
I mean there are shill companies who make legit a lot of money by swaying public opinion one way or the other for their client, there was a channel 4 documentary about it.
---
I'm not saying it's the case here, there are a lot of useful idiots in the world but some of the shit you read in this place makes you wonder.
---
Very true!
---
Doesn't give them much time to fix things if they wait to long for an open stress test.
---
A bit tired of this constant "classic good, retail bad -upvote!" posts. Yes both games have their pros and cons. And I actually happen to like retail and will most likely like classic as well (having never played it when it came out).
---
I plan on maining a warrior so I tried orc in the stress test. Did a WSG and instantly considered that I should go undead instead. Obviously we didn’t have our trinkets yet but a free fear break seems so much more useful than stun resist. Am I wrong in thinking this? Orc may be better for pve but undead just seems so much better for pvp purposes. Cannabalize also seems pretty handy for leveling. Basically if I care more about pvp should I just make my warrior undead? Or do things get better once you get the appropriate trinket to fight fear?
---
They should do a massive curve ball and release a whole new expansion or patch. Like scrap TBC and work on emerald dream or hyjal. I mean that’s wishful thinking but they don’t even need to boost the lvl cap, just give more quests and a new area to explore.
---
the servers will be capable of holding more than 20k people without lag
---
So dueling an undead lock as a human warlock won't mean he can just roll me with will of the forsaken, it's more of a slight edge because he can break one fear?
---
&gt;However nothing about it is directly from Classic. 
---
I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bn1qpg/this_kingdom_shall_fall_and_from_the_ashes_shall/) post which was removed. I reached out to mods but never clearly got a specific answer why my post was removed but instead I was just redirected to the rules as if I was speaking to customer support. I started a back-and-forward conversation with the mods and I presented some criticism towards some of the mods in that conversation and I was blasted-in-the-ass by them, which is really odd when thinking of what their purpose is - to serve the community. If the community is not happy with you, it is your fault not the community. I tried to bargain or meet at middle ground but this mod was so stubborn that I just buried the hatchet. From my experience it seems some of the mods are really difficult to deal with and as servants of the community it's important for you to remember your true purpose.
---
A self regulated community is way better than a community where you call your dad at the slightest infraction.
---
They were paid to acknowledge the Classic hype :P

Thank you very much 😇

The only people who want to play on the streamer servers are the sheep lmao. Have fun playing on a server where every player is blindly following and manipulating the economy to work for the streamers only, while every else gets shit on. 
---
Have fun dealing with players in stormwind making a huge patterns out of themselves around asmon while donating him gold and items, really do go ahead and enjoy it!

I understand beta. The name thing is also a little bit difficult. Because why should you be allowed to create a name without an active account? So you create a character without one and maybe you will never play. The only solution for this in my opinion is to not allow people to reserve names at all..
---
Yeah the continents can support another 2 major content patches at least
---
Depends what kind of pvp, for solo pvp it's a big disadvantage if you're planning on going destruction. If you're going SL you can pretty much facetank everyone with drainlife and use deathcoil for a breather, as UD I barely ever used fear in duels.
---
For organized group pvp where CC is more important with tremor, grounding and wotf you can imagine how useless you will feel compared to your Horde warlock opponent but it's not a dealbreaker since there's a lot of other ways you're useful. Either way if you're serious about pvp and you weren't planning on taking engineering, you definitely need it as Alliance.
---
Because new gear would totally fuck up all the itemization going forward.
---
Zero chance. If they were going to add more people to the beta they would have done it by now. There's nothing to really gain by sending out more beta invites.
---
Personally i dont know about raids, but I used to tank dungeons to great effect on my prot pala. Would love to see your video.
---
Europe is objectively the freest place the live on the planet, americans wouldn't understand.
---
If he slapped my healers ass, he deserved it.
---
There likely was before, but over the last few weeks, mainly from when people hit 40 cap, it's been really quiet.
---
And the layering makes it even worse - its layering when there's like 5-6 people in a zone (WHY???), so you end up with 1-2 people on one layer and 3-4 on another, and chat doesn't appear to be cross-layer, so one side can be /1 LFG xxxx and so can the other, with both not seeing each other.
---
Playing alliance warlock has clear disadvantages in wpvp (while horde warlocks have disadvantages in BGs because of paladins).
---
You will have to shift your playstyle to more dmg and less fears/charms in wpvp. Its not the end of the world but some UD shadow priests/rogues/mages will kill you in scenarios where you could have won as a horde warlock.
---
If you have strong connections to the alliance (emotional or friends playing there), then you can play human for sure. Difference between gnome and human is irrelevant from my experience, play what you prefer.
---
This is completely different. Top players know the game inside out now and the standard is so much higher.
---
Actually I have been thinking about this sometimes. Wouldn't it make the leveling easier if you were drunk ingame all the time, because the mobs are lower? If they are lower or green you crit more, they hit you less etc.?
---
Or is the mob level only displayed lower for your character but does not really go down? I mean you could go for orange/red mobs with alcohol
---
Maybe, but I dont think they will let 20k+ players in, that is unplayable.
---
I don't smoke, I use gummies. PNW Life man.
---
No, Joana’s old world record is 4d20h, and he says he’ll easily beat it this time, because of auto-loot and more planning. You’re thinking of the sub-4d private server records.
---
It be fun as hell to see “what could of been”. Like I said it could easily be worked on during the time of release till majority of players have naxx sets
---
Gnome priest: definitely a fantasy
---
Yeah, I'm fully agreeing with you on that. Just not on the MCP thing.
---
I think the tick labels are very clear.
---
Yes, we're trying to censor posts about a mechanic that (to my knowledge) none of us like, that I've said plenty of times is just sharding with better branding, we're trying to censor posts about it, yet despite our best efforts they keep reaching the front page and staying there if they present any form of discussion whatsoever. And we're trying to do it for an organisation we've had contact with through conversations that move at a rate of one single-sentence message per month, and we're doing it because we just *love* Activision so much. C'mon dude, take off the tin foil hat. 
---
You can post about whatever you like as long as it relates to Classic (and doesn't break other rules), however if it discusses the exact same issue as another recently posted (typically within 1-3 days, at the rate the subreddit moves now), larger and more successful, thread you will be told to use that thread.
---
This is for 2 reasons: Firstly your opinion will be better highlighted in that thread, than sat on 0 with 2-3 comments because people don't want to write yet another response to yet another contentless layering thread, and secondly it allows for other discussions to be hosted here too. If we approved every layering thread there would be no opportunity to discuss anything else.
---
Server lags just like in bfa with 80 people using abilities. Vanilla did lag on client because of graphics not because of bad networking.
---
At this point theres nothing to do\test, so even if they invited 10k 700 peak now doesnt surprise me.
---
Its all known issues hunters, layering, leeway being top 3 things rn.
---
The only people posting on the WoW forums are active BFA players, you think Blizzard should be listening to these people about Classic? Nice brain you got there.
---
That's what I was thinking, 2 min cooldown isn't short, but literally everyone has said why bother rolling an alliance warlock because of all the undead.
---
Ah yes, where you accidentally pull 20 of them.
---
I am old and I hate it but I love this picture
---
Fiery on skinning knife, so you can resell it when you are done.
---
The servers can, but the game itself can't.  There aren't nearly enough resources in the world to handle 20k concurrents.
---
Well i hope not since theres lots of issues on the current build.
---
In PvE you only *need* to be Human if you're competing for world firsts. In your case being Dwarf is only going to make your DPSMate numbers slightly weaker. As long as you learn the encounters and do your job nobody is going to blame you for your race.
---
In PvP, I think the racials matter more. The Rogue's main weakness in Classic is CC. The Stoneform and Escape Artist racials both help with this whereas Perception does not. That's why I think Dwarf and Gnome Rogues are superior to Human for PvP.
---
I think it's better to optimize for the PvP racials. You don't want to be in a guild where they only want Human Rogues anyways.
---
Tauren shamen. I like the idea of just being part of the horde because thrall helped our kind. Being a peaceful tauren shamen who is one with the natura placing totems to help out other members of the horde but if you treating his life he can go mad and fight for it. I will play herb/alchemy because of the nature connection and only attack players from other factions if they try to attack me.
---
&gt; okay for the game to have more bugs than it did twelve years ago?

Pretty hard I'd say. WoW early 2005 was oozing with bugs left an right.

Plenty of posts are up and not locked on that topic. As an EU player it's a topic I'm fairly concerned about, however the bigotry directed towards Russian players was not allowed and never would have been allowed here. Rule 2 applies regardless of what is being discussed.

So because of the gnome racial vs humans, humans suck for pvp? I know gnomes have escape artist but I can't imagine it making the race suck right?

-too many buttons
---
-need a whole bag slot just for shards
---
Their all servers work through sharding. They might be just adding a mechanism to make sure that people in world boss zones and their respective raids will stay in one layer.
---
The comment that world bosses are somehow less compatible with layering than, say, leveling, is already ignorant because it shows that the main issue to them is not game world integrity but loot balance??
---
Change that to 18 for all my uk buddies
---
&gt; join another lower pop server
---
This solidifies the fact that you have no idea what's going on here. There will be no low-pop servers at launch. That's not an option. There's expected to be several million players at launch and there will likely be only ~20ish US servers. Current wow servers are built to have &lt;10k active players at once. 5 million players across 20 servers is 250k per server. Blizzard can't handle anywhere close to that.
---
Do you actually think Blizzard is going to make it so 90%+ of players can't play, just to appease some whiny redditors/forum posters? That would unquestionably be one of the most disastrous launches in video game history, and would turn people away from the game.
---
Sure, they can just add more servers, but if you have hundreds of servers, most of them will be dead after the first few months.
---
&gt;You are acting like an mmo has never launched before and the world will end if people can't log in reeeeeeeeeeeeee.
---
Lol. I'm not the one crying on reddit about the state of the game. You are. I'm just explaining to you why Blizzard has and will continue to ignore you. What you're asking for is completely retarded.
---
If you'd actually rather not log on than deal with layering, then I pity how stubborn you are. Feel free to not play, though. We won't miss you.
---
I probably do plan on going SL, just because of how strong it is and how much fun you can have, however I will be swapping to destro for big crits once I need a change.
---
Thats this website in a nutshell, it's always been an echo chamber by nature of the system up/downvotes. You are supposed to downvote things which don't contribute to the discussion but people just downvote things they don't agree with, even if the person is making legit arguments and articulating themselves well.
---
I know this might be uncouth depending on your muffin preferences, but one of my friends suggested "Bran Gang" (apparently Bran Muffins and Old people are a thing) with our tabard being the muffin icon. Or "Get Off My Lawn" with the gnome icon.
---
Yes, and it's quite necessary for Nefarian's class call.
---
I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt regarding the low-effort meme, but then again, I was never told that my post was removed because of that, but rather I was sent to "rule 7" which is a massive cluster of things. Again, in between the first and the second time we had an ongoing conversation where I tried time-after-time to get a specific reason, which nobody provided, and so I posted it again, because I thought it might've been a personal mod opinion rather than an actual rule violation. 
---
Also, here you go with the "the image is not Classic-specific" again. What does that even mean? Are you saying that since Undercity exists in retail that the meme is not classic-specific or are you saying that it's too much of a generic advice animal post to begin with? I even asked specifically about this in the conversation and never got any specific responses.
---
Please report them, they should be removed. They're not about Classic, they're about Retail, and that's the stance we've always taken.
---
Either way, it's bugged. They removed fishing within Ironforge at some point. Not sure where we are in this mesh of patches lol
---
Feral is literally so useless, that if you play it people will kick you and tell you to play a rogue instead or play resto.

I have played alliance all my life, and want to play an alli lock, however I am definitely considering undead lock for the new feel of the game alongside playing an alli druid. It sounds like it will affect it once we are in the big leagues.
---
Lets summarise this post... Horde still think it is still not an evil faction.
---
not you
---
Level 19 twink. Classic subreddit. Warrior pictured in TBC armor.
---
Blizzard doesn't care if you reroll. Do you still pay a sub if you reroll? Yes? They don't care. 
---
Only way Blizzard or any big games company these days will fix things is if they think the cost of fixing it is less than the potential loss of not fixing it, ie players not paying the sub because of some of these bugs. If it costs 10k to fix all these bugs but their analysis estimates only 1k of lost profits from keeping the bugs, guess which they go with.
---
Megathreads aren't a catch all solution. I wrote this is another thread towards the exact same question, so I've copy pasted it here.
---
&gt; Megathreads are great for some topics and not so great for others. Streamers and layering, mostly due to the nature of the discussion, being two things they won't support well. I'm mostly speaking for myself, but here goes:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Megathreads tend to be great for moments of excitement, when the community is all reacting to the exact same piece of news, and when the news won't update. Instead of dozens of threads popping off with single-sentence content all of those threads get removed and redirected into the megathread. Which is why we've used them for things like the stress test in the past, Blizzcon, and so on.
---
&gt; Another thing they tend to do is lead the discussion. The less popular opinion gets buried far more quickly, and the more popular opinion looks like overwhelming consensus. For this reason alone we don't want to use a megathread for topics where there are a lot of varied opinions (layering and streamers being just that). They're also not great for reflecting updates to that news, because you can't change the title, you can't wipe away the previous discussion (without removing it - which we don't want to do), and so on.
---
&gt; Finally, we have 2 stickies. We had to get rid of the bug report sticky to sticky this, and still maintain our weekly posts which from previous feedback were widely appreciated (and in the case of LFG and WSIP overwhelmingly necessary).
---
&gt; Instead of using a megathread we're simply removing nearly all single sentence posts, and directing people to post comment-length posts in the body of a relevant post, as there is always a fresh layering/streamer thread every single day, if not several, that we wouldn't ever remove (because of the level of depth gone into, or because they talk about something rarely discussed in relation to layering). This helps each of those threads get more traction, and also helps the single-comment posts actually get seen when they're in the comments of a successful post.
---
How can they make 5 layers of concurrent players into 1 realm? "Expect it to go away" is just magical thinking because you have not demonstrated how they're going to split the populations. Obviously the game will have **more players after phase 1** than at launch. This is Classic WoW we're talking about, not modern expansion with expected player drops.
---
The topic isn't forbidden - it's all over the front page nearly every day. That video was removed by mistake and has been re-approved.
---
Hunter has a dead zone that will destroy you in pvp and literally every bad or accidental pull will be blamed on you or your pet. Feral is just like a rogue and warrior put together but a lot worse than either. Warlocks have to farm non-stacking shards to use their abilities, so if you run out mid fight, your dps goes to shit and you have less inventory space.
---
To answer your question, i dont think they will and dont think they need to. The vast majority of adult and expierienced classic Players i talked to - those who want to play the game and not an interactive stream - is going to actively avoid those servers. 
---
Besides that, a 5k population is enough to form a healthy classic economy.
---
There are many quite significant unresolved bugs, so at this point before they're resolved, adding more bets testers simply does nothing.
---
Yup
---
are you talking about the same alpha and beta bfa forums that blizzard deleted only to create massive shitstorm after bfa launch because bfa was full of bugs?
---
I almost didn't care about this. Watched a streamer for an hour on my break at work one day and now my addiction is full blown all over again.
---
I'm gonna work Mon/Tues that week and take the rest off to pound out some serious levels for 5 days of pure WOW bliss.
---
We generally assume people can figure out for themselves which rule was broken within a removal post, but a follow-up by DM (which is why we include a modmail link in a removal) is the go-to way to get clarification if something didn't make sense.
---
Can you link me the conversation? I'm pretty sure we distinctly told you it was low-effort/not classic-specific, but it was a month ago and I have literally hundreds of messages since then - and Reddit sucks and doesn't have a search function. If you could DM it to me, I'd like to review what happened and I can see that we improve going forward.
---
Classic-specific means that if it isn't obviously about Classic, then it probably will be removed, *especially* if it's a low-effort label-type of meme. If someone takes time to photoshop something in using Classic assets, but the overall message isn't necessarily Classic-specific (but at least applies in some appreciable way to Classic), it might stay. Essentially, you made the lowest level of meme (a label meme on top of a generic image) and the text itself was generic and could be applied to Retail. So, that combination = low effort = removal.
---
There has to be *some* line drawn for when things are removed. We try to be consistent, and the current cut-off is that a meme has to be obviously about Classic without needing to read the post title.
---
"I'm so glad I have a team of superiors to make decisions for me about what I can and cannot talk about, if I had to think about these things myself it would be too much and hurt my brain!!"
---
literally you
---
The only thing wrong with 'locks in classic, was the soul shards. That's it. A raid night consisted of s shard grind to fill entire bags.
---
Otherwise they're ace and always have been.
---
You know there's only 48 hours in 2 days right, some of the fastest leveling runs done are 4+ days of time played. There's no way there would be dozens of 60s by day 2.
---
You mean gnomes for nukes right?
---
I’m committed to switching over to horde, I’ve never made it past lvl 10 on this side.
---
Now I just need to decide if I want to play rogue again or something else.
---
Uhmm what icon ?
---
Long time Horde player here, debating the same thing. I like the cities, I like the zones, I like the feel. I just don't like most of the Alliance races as much as Horde races.
---
Yeah, there is a reason why lot of people love fresh servers in the private server scene, even if it means leveling another char
---
Is it like, 4 days 20 hours non stop or on /played ? Cause non stop would be insane haha
---
&gt;I know gnomes have escape artist but I can't imagine it making the race suck right?
---
Warlocks have very limited mobility so escape artist is quite impactful compared to human which essentially gives nothing. WotF is a big disadvantage in duels/casual bg's, but paladins give an extra dispel for premades and imo a lot of pvpers will be rolling orc where available for the stun resist so undead may not be as common as they were in vanilla.
---
So you say I should take at least 10 days off. Noted.
---
Or 600k retail gold.
---
but layering seems to still be one of the most prominent issues in classic. if they kill it now we won't be able to uncover new layering interactions, bugs, odd behaviours.
---
What they should do is send out 5-10k new invites and set a level 40 optional character template to start as when they raise cap to 50 or 60.
---
I was surprised with the low number of people invited. yes we don't have exact numbers but i imagined estimates would be in the 50-70k invited. turns out it's more like a maximum of 10-12k on 2 realms.
---
Also from my observation, everyone rightfully assumed that each layer will have around 2-3k people and instead of a server pop being capped at 3k it will then be capped at 9-12k and have 3-4 layers. However, it seems like its way smaller than that. Even with 300-500 people online there are still several layers active.
---
Phasing and sharding has always been a shitty addition in modern wow. and it is starting to become obvious that layering is just a small modification from that tech to remove cross realm grouping, as evident by all the behaviours.
---
More flexibility? You’re not going to use Moonfire or Insect Swarm in a raid
---
Its obvious because its all about queue times. Shits getting annoying as fuck hearing people bitch about something thats gonna be in the game temporary. You got people bitching on the beta about layering when its a fucking BETA to test BUGS! Along with most of those people bitching about queues on streams don't report any kind of bugs or experiences with it, just a clip and they go "oh wow queue times gonna ruin this game wooow arghhh ummpphhh rudda rudda".
---
Costs money they won't do it.
---
You won't clear naxx anyway.
---
Do you have any source material, that can verify your claim ?
---
If you are horde then yes.
---
Pretty much any time someone mentions leveling times, they are refering to /played.
---
For some reason that distinction seems to be lost on a lot of people.
---
Say if i said i'm going to be 60 in 7 days, i'd get responses like "No you wont it took people months to hit 60". Obviously people are referring to their /played.
---
We cant realy "shape" anything tho
---
People who played private servers are a small minority of the people who will play classic, and an even smaller minority of the people who will play at launch. People aren't going to just leave the game in droves because Blizzard doesn't agree to the arbitrary requests of a few reddit neckbeards. 99% of players could quit and they'd still have a larger player base than any private server ever.
---
If you'd rather play private servers that have countless bugs, poor network infrastructure, awful support, scuffed markets, and no guarantee that your character or server will even exist a few months from now than play classic with temporary layering, then you're cutting off your nose to spite your face. It's laughable how stubborn you'd have to be to do that.
---
Your post is honestly pretty garbage. Type of shit that makes me leave subreddits.
---
You get to sit in a queue for making a bad life choice.
---
It was interesting. Early on it was a pain since everyone was on the same quest chains and fighting over mob spawns. I hope Blizz ditches or limits layering in spite of this because having people running all over the place with you was part of the fun.
---
Then the hardcore people started pulling ahead, learning fights, sharing strats. Of course we don't need that part so much now, but you began to see the split as the more casual players took their time leveling. 
---
And the crafts picked up - you had a choice. Take time to gather and craft or go grind more quests out. 
---
It will be different on classic. Things have changed. The playerbase is a different age group. The Internet has matured. Streaming has erupted. We can look up interesting tidbits we had to discover before. But we will all be in the same places. We will have goals that we cannot accomplish on our own. We will have to coordinate to get dungeon groups together. We will be limited to our own servers and get to know our populations.
---
In quest zones we will use general chat and make conversation while auto running from one side of the map to the other. In towns we will spam trade chat with WTS/WTB as we craft or shop, organize bags, or wait to find a dungeon group. Our guilds will matter to us rather than just being a way to gain the guild perks. 
---
I'm hopeful.
---
Pretty sure rag/domo weren't even spawnable for a while, class mechanics/talents were very different(power creep throughout vanilla), and internet was sometimes unreliable.  Not sure if there were any limitations on how many attempts you had on Ragnaros like they later introduced with Vael/Nef.  And of course the fact you can look and just see the entire list of abilities and potential strategies before you even see the boss spawn.  I would say the players are slightly better.Keep in mind WoW wasn't everyones 1st MMO and some people had been raiding bosses for years before and transitioned their entire guild over as a part/whole, these were the world first type players not the guys who never even played a PC game before.
---
I have a sit/stand desk with a stand for my roadbike under it. Gonna grind while I grind.
---
Almost certain it isn't possible to obtain enough int to gain +60 from 5%.
---
I know you don't want to hear this [u/Azzmo](https://www.reddit.com/user/Azzmo/), but nothing was lost from you shitty meme being deleted.
---
Same. Always wanted to play a healer, and dwarf was my first race back in Vanilla. Classic for me is the perfect opportunity to commit to a class I have always wanted to play.
---
Think that's how you got the lil spider pet
---
I'm a long time Horde player. I originally wanted to go Alliance but rolled a Horde because I was young and my friends thought the Horde was "cool". I've seen almost all that Horde had to offer.
---
Part of me wants to do it all over again, but deep down I know I can only really pick one. So I'm going to roll Alliance this time and see it all over again from the other side.
---
warlock - lazy assholes
---
hunter - bigotry
---
feral - bigotry
---
I cant wait to sit in a queue the first day then have to go to bed early to get up for class. Still excited for it though
---
And it's not out til phase 3
---
If you don't mind playing a chick Alliance has the best females by far.
---
Worst part about warlock is that they are generally useless for group content. All your utility is either useless or very low impact and your damage isn't anything to write home about. And to maximize dps you have to strain the healer.
---
For group PvE content you're basically a poor mans mage or a tag-along raid buffer.
---
Can I create a new [battle.net](https://battle.net) account for Classic as long as i pay the subscription?
---
Or do i need to buy any battlechest / bfa etc.
---
basically can I create a new account on a new email and just play classic for 15€ a month? Need to hide from Work  Colleagues and SC2 players ;)
---
It won't be gone, because their revenue depends on modern server infastructure; they have sharded everything because unused server % is waste of money.
---
Mark my words they will just add another mechanism to sharding such that world boss zones and raids will be forced to co-exist in a single layer.
---
Warlock= Soulstones
---
Hunter = Arrows/dead pet
---
Shaman......OOM
---
Damn where's muh tin-foil hat, that there Blizzard have darn infiltrated muh favourite place to talk shit about em!
---
Holy shit, throw the bowl away and clear your head of those paranoid delusions
---
lol, people have been playing private vanilla servers for years. 
---
youre already behind.
---
Debuff limit says hi and lesser mobility then almost any other class.
---
Always played Lock in vanilla. A lot of buttons, yes, but even the other classes have this problem... Isn't it?
---
I've been playing on a popular pserver while I wait for classic. They didn't offer any PvE realms so I ended up on a PvP world. I'm level 42 at this point and it's frustrating to try to level. There is a never ending stream of characters that come by, hide until you're down to 25% health, jump out and gank you. Not to mention, they're always at least 3 levels higher. Usually more like 6 levels higher. They rarely corpse camp, but gets old when 4 different people do this in a 20 minute span.
---
I find STV and hillsbrad to be unplayable.
---
Sometimes I login to play and get ganked a few times right away. That generally ends in me logging off.
---
So yeah. PvE realm for me.
---
That's because even the top level guilds back then were absolute dogshit. 
---
The world first Rag kill from 2005 has been [recorded and the vid is available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br1hXGXJ7Tg). If you look at it, you will see a garbage raid composition, people who use almost no consumables (no fire protection pot!), bad group composition (no shaman in melee group), healers who waste mana on DPSing, memespecs, a misunderstanding of optimal itemization, and a DPS meter dominated by a rogue who doesn't even use slice'n'fuckin'dice.
---
With regular /target usage, being alive takes precedence over distance.
---
Assuming hunter feign death interacts the same way, you'll always get the pet.
---
That's great! You both can spend it in Azerroth
---
&gt;  there have already been numerous complaints about it being removed
---
so bring it back and make it permanent during beta, maybe you will get gratitude :).
---
i mean no one wants bfa bugfest launch to be repeated in classic.
---
AFAIK it's just a matter of setting up a sub with an account and you'll have access to classic. No need to buy game copies. So yeah, should be fine to make another account. Hide away my friend!
---
Correct me if I am wrong but ... do they usually hotfix things on a beta instead of just rolling out all the fixes in big batches?  I would expect even if they had say 10-20 bug fixes for hunters they wouldn't necessarily implement them until they push through with a large patch.
---
WOTF is powerful, but only makes them immune for 5 seconds and has a 2minute cool down. i think its power is overplayed as you can chain cast fear.
---
Just the subscription.
---
Assassins blade in the left hand. What’s that in the right?

Frostnova him and laugh about him not being a gnome.

I appreciate the comprehensive reply. I considered PMing you since I read you in your Youtube videos as a confident and actualized man who don't need no ego boosts or jollies from malignant behavior...but then I threw up my cyber hands and closed the /r/classicwow subreddit tab for the first time in a year and a half because of all of the deletions today. I actually ended up with THREE comment replies that did not go through because threads were locked while I was typing. Three in one day in the same subreddit! 
---
&gt;Beyond that, we have always tried to remove posts that come up that are highly repetitive/reposts. 
---
I see this layering issue is a protest beyond the scope of "stop talking about key bindings" or "we only need one thread about your favorite zone". People need a platform on which to make ourselves seen/heard by Blizzard and Blizzard needs to know how many people are displeased by what they are currently planning to do to Classic. Protests and collective communication only work when everybody is visible; imagine those Hong Kong videos if only the first 1000 people were allowed the march and the other 1,999,000 were held back. 
---
The moderators have let a good amount of layering discussion go on which is laudable and I don't agree with the Blizzard puppet allegations but damn, man. If Blizzard can't perceive the buzz going on about this because peoples' voices are just being deleted by some dude or dudette in some city then this layering thing is probably going to go live and you guys will share some responsibility for shaping the social atmosphere to appear more consenting about this than it actually is. 
---
I appreciate the time you guys put in. I appreciate that you've left this thread up. Your decisions come from an honest intention to keep the subreddit clean, usable, and fun. Please consider distinguishing community outcry as something other than spam. It is not spam. It is not intended to annoy. It is an honest and hopeful attempt to make Blizzard see.
---
nah i only jump if blink is on CD
---
16 for all my german buddies
---
I don't think you can fd with the flag though.
---
This ain't it chief
---
Why did you make this post if you weren't there in 2004?
---
Because if you were there you wouldn't have made this post.
---
Blizzard has stated Blizzlike caps, meaning ~3-3.5k players.
---
No goddamn megaservers, please.
---
All I can say is have fun with your dreaming buddies. The rest of us will be playing the game as intended.
---
berseker rage makes you immune to fear anyway just need to time it right.
---
25% stun resist is not as reliable but has no cooldown so in a bg zerg situation it "procs" more often than WOTF on cooldown
---
Bloodfury and Axe +5 is hands down the best PVE racial on horde Side, alters your BIS items so you dont have to compete with rogues over Swords and therefore faster raid equiped.
---
it comes down to preference, do you want to 1v1? probably WOTF for on demand 
---
BGs, PVP Zerg, PVE? Orc
---
Im pretty sure that cats and bears are the only ones who can use both claw and bite in classic
---
Good response mate. 
---
I think OP was annoyed that their shitty meme was deleted, and wrongly thought it was the moderators fault rather then their own fault for posting shitty content.
---
And people can't be serious that there is a blizzard conspiracy to infiltrate the mod team, listen to how ridiculous that sounds!
---
Blizzard stated explicitly a few weeks ago they are drastically slowing down invites because they have the population they need for the beta.
---
Sorry, but it’s wishful thinking.
---
&gt;People who played private servers are a small minority of the people who will play classic, and an even smaller minority of the people who will play at launch.
---
How retarded do you have to be to think this, a certain WELL KNOWN server which you might know about though I cant name had over 300k active players with 15k online 24/7
---
This MINORITY are the whole reason you are even getting this game in the first place, have some fucking respect for the players who you (probably) a couple of years ago where screeching about on the official forums blizzard shut it down reeeee! how do they get to play for free and we don't!
---
&gt;If you'd rather play private servers that have countless bugs, poor network infrastructure, awful support, scuffed markets, and no guarantee that your character or server will even exist a few months from now
---
It's ironic but so far the beta has been a worse experience than private servers, bugs upon bugs upon bugs ofc you wouldn't know these things yet you still talk about them like you do :) classic.

Guild Name: Tempest
---
Server Type: PvP
---
Region: NA - East
---
Faction: Alliance
---
About us:
---
Tempest is a guild dedicated to high raiding efficiency and strong game knowledge with proactive community members. Our mission is to complete all available content and compete in the top echelon of the server. To ensure our success, and fulfill the guild vision, many individual aspects will be sacrificed for the overall benefit of the guild. Coordination centered on concepts such as: reputation, recipes, gear, and world events require necessary amounts of teamwork at the potential cost of individual gain. While raid times will not be moved for server firsts, it is the leadership’s expectation that all content (with the exception of MC), be cleared the first day/week of release. Furthermore, raid members will be expected to min/max to the best of their abilities to properly contribute to raids. Members that demonstrate they are not able to play their characters to the highest potential will see limited gear acquisition and raid invitations. The leadership recognizes that the above described environment is not for everyone and may be different from guilds you’ve previously raided with.
---
Our current members are private vanilla raiders with experience in all available content of raiding, pvp, world bosses, and farming. Over the years we have learned to prioritize collaboration, professionalism, dedication, and competitiveness.
---
Raid Schedule:
---
9 PM – 12 AM EST (6 – 9 PM PST) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
---
Loot: Loot council decision.
---
Attendance: All aspiring raiders will be expected to attend at least 90% of the raids.
---
Initial plans: 3rd week MC clear. We will not be moving raid times for server firsts, but all newly released content will be cleared the day/week of release.
---
Basic Requirements: All professions, buffs, consumables, and gearing is expected to be min/maxed to provide top tier raiding performance.
---
Potential applicants should have a hardcore mindset and experience min/maxing in some WoW expansion, with detailed classic knowledge preferred. If you are interested in being a part of this guild, regardless of your background and experience with the current leadership, you are expected to fill out the following application: https://forms.gle/11UVtbgguU8AExWYA

"Each time someone mentions a streamer"
---
I pity the Alliance players who will do this challenge.
---
This is called class disign, despite being horrible in vanilla. Warlocks are supposed to use lifetap and trade their much bigger life for mana. And they do that when they need to move and/or are waiting for consumables' CD. This stayed till MoP. Well, only destro actually did not need to cast life tap at MoP. This is core mechanics.
---
Cant wait for the day one road to tag mobs in elwyn forest  :)
---
If you ignore all the Warriors giving you a sour look, gathering regular tanking gear is one way to go for a paladin. If you look at many of the paladin sets there is little to no spell damage on them and if there is it usually includes healing as well.
---
There is no proof that layering will be gone phase 2. They will probably make some solution to force world bosses and raids to single layer in phase 2. They have only sharded server infrastructure for finan ial reasons so whatever solution they come up with it will be shards with some custom code added, i.e. "layering" or "no layering in phase 2".
---
Shadowcraft?
---
I wanted to play warlock or hunter... seeing pets being absolutely dogshit bugged through and through, I will roll something else.
---
&gt; This solidifies the fact that you have no idea what's going on here. There will be no low-pop servers at launch.
---
&gt;just wait in a queue or or just wait out the launch for a week or 2
---
classic redditor just cherrypick what you want, ignore the rest and downvote anyways.
---
Yes! To both especially the get off my lawn with the gnome banner Hahaha I would join your guild for sure

I predict this will go swimmingly.

no no no nono :"P please no. already rescheduled my vacation from late july to last 4 days of august with 2nd  week of september.
---
Dude, he's being hyperbolic for effect. He's not being literal. It's like saying the idiom 'I could eat a horse'.
---
It aint about where it went. It's about Cata ruining the game for everyone that was currently playing at the time.
---
1. Throw your bowl away and get your head clear, there is no conspiracy
---
2. If you are really serious about forcing change then the best place to get this to happen is through Blizzard forums/tickets/feedback avenues. Blizzard pretty much ignore anything that is posted on third party website, hell they pretty much ignore feedback on their own channels if it doesn't fit their vision/timeline/whatever
---
Good luck with the 82 minutes come launch
---
Here we go again. I have done almost the same on live servers back then. Not on some private shit. Still, if you call Life Tap, a core class mechanic, a DPS loss then you probably have issues with playing your lock. You always life tap as you move. Life is a resource for warlocks and you use this spell when you move or your consumables are on CD.
---
15% shadow vulnerability is huge. So your only point that stands is the hit rating.
---
Looks good - even if obviously fake - except that with the new Classic client you wouldn't be able to launch the game on this computer.
---
In b4 delet
---
Why are there constantly funny memes on the front page then?
---
They hinted that they need to change it when World Bosses come out. That means like forcing world boss raids and the zone into a single layer.
---
Which is really beside the point, because layered leveling experience is even worse than marginal world bosses.
---
Sounds like private servers aren't that bad and official release is not that far.
---
Thanks for bringing a happy post to these forums. And I envy you for a firsttime wow experience.
---
anyone who has tried model editing knows this is possible.
---
Nobody. My guess is someone who didn’t play in that era three this together.
---
The issue is that layering is discussed to death *hourly*. 
---
A lot of it is handwringing based on misunderstanding and misinformation and it doesn’t help that Blizzard is pretty mum on the subject beyond saying that layering will be removed before phase 2.  
---
Im on the side that I’m really tired of seeing the page long posts chicken little posts about how layering will be the end of the Classic -to the point that I’ve filtered it out, because I either get called a shill for supporting it, or it’s just the same stuff repeated over and over and over.
---
Retail Vanilla record was 7.5 /played
---
Same here. Going to casually level to 60 this time. Also going Hunter since it is the best class for me for relaxing leveling.
---
Only played during the stress tests and got to 10 with that but my enjoyment wasn't hampered by the bugs.
---
I also didn't noticed them, but then again, I ain't looking for them.
---
It would be nice if Blizzard communicated better about all these things though.
---
I'm planning on making a forsaken and prioritizing loarderon zones. I will only go to other zones for dungeons and notable quest rewards.
---
Marginal content like world bosses forced into single layer meanwhile the whole leveling experience will be layered.
---
This post doesn't solve your problem. It's not going to stop folks from posting about retail. I'd anything this post will just invite hostility.
---
For a warlock : 
---
- Logging 30m earlier than the rest to farm soulshards so you can summon their lazy asses when they log late or give out healthstones
---
- Soulshards taking up all your bagspace
---
- Being on MT duty so when the fight starts you have to move your imp close enough for the tank losing out on dps due to time and not being able to sacc pet, you're also susceptible to the odd cleave but luckily you can take a hit with your 6k hp
---
- Once you played an UD lock with Cannibalize every other race feels broken to play as lock
---
- As a lock you will look more at the threatmeter than the dpsmeter or hp% of the boss.
---
- You'll always lose your spot to a mage for 5 man groups because drinks are expensive.
---
- Having to lifetap all the time can get really tiresome compared to a mage who can just nuke and evocate/managem.
---
- Having to deal with knowing that you caused a wipe because all healers panicked and spamhealed you after you went overboard with the lifetaps and the tank then went down. (it's a joke but I definitely saw it happening a lot.) :&lt;
---
- Not being allowed to do maxdmg because of the limited debuffslots
---
- Having people whisper you all the time asking for a summon no matter where you are and them expecting you to find more people in that zone
---
- And last but not least : https://i.imgur.com/m7uS47p.jpg :), I imagine there will be less around this time but I got asked this on almost a daily basis.
---
Lock was a really fun class, one of the most fun times I've had in WoW was in Vanilla when I used to solo/duo entire instances which is why I'm still not sure wether I'm going for a lock again or hunter/mage. Hunter for a challenge, mage for easymode no worries.
---
One of my old favorite WoW series was Stupid Mage Tricks. The mage Faxmonkey would employ similar kiting methods for some of his kills, and it really made me rethink what all could be done in the game when one knew how to manipulate it the right way. 
---
Your video was entertaining in the same way, and I liked the music too.
---
Layering is removed when most of the players have quit and servers only have 3k players.
---
The rogue D1 set.
---
Die in the next 5 seconds I guess?
---
1. Google Petopia. Best hunter pet resource out there.
---
2. Dps is normalized between attack speed. So your 2.0 pets will do the same dps as a 1.2 pet. The different is the faster pets hit less but more often.
---
3. Not sure, but I don't think so. 
---
4. Ranged attacks can't glance. 
---
5. Howl only affects melee attacks
---
6. I imagine they would retain buffs.
---
7. See #1
---
8. The way it should work is the Warrior is buffed with the normal amount from Howl. Then reduction modifiers from the stance kick in afterwards.
---
ROFLCOPTER
---
Ah yes thanks
---
Exactly. Some people just want to watch the sub burn.
---
You wana fight? SW GATE RIGHT NOW!
---
Which is more efficient at making gold, a highly geared mage AoE farming without gathering professions or an averagely geared alt mage AoE farming with gathering and skinning?
---
You scepticism proves that you know absolutely nothing about model changing. It's stupid that you are *this* sceptical about something you have zero knowledge of. Just appreciate what he's doing.
---
Honestly you'll be fine then, as Horde you were also annoyed by paladins dispelling every dot but you could troll them with Curse of Tongues. :)
---
&gt;I am not sure you need tactical mastery at all..... I dont see you much stance dancing
---
There's life outside raiding, for me warriors are unplayable without 5 points in TM.
---
At that point it's more about stressing servers, finalizing layering tech and getting more info for how many people will play at launch
---
No, they will have less players as there is always a spike on launch vs the settled population base. Look up any online game in the history of online games.
---
You haven't heard of Joana?
---
It won't be removed phase 2. They will add a solution to make world bosses appear in one layer. It will be renamed like from sharding to layering. Their server infastructure is and remains maximized for profits, not maximized for authentic vanilla servers.
---
The main issue is people not understanding why breaking the game world is always bad - not when it's exploited, not when it makes content like world bosses difficult to access - but ALWAYS and especially when leveling.
---
&gt;However, it seems like its way smaller than that. Even with 300-500 people online there are still several layers active
---
Even with 100 online on alliance in beta. My theory is they are 3-4 people per zone with the rate at which it updates each layer cranked up to every 1-2s. This way they get as many layer transitions as possible for testing. I'd say the stress test was tuned a great deal lower. 
---
&gt;but layering seems to still be one of the most prominent issues in classic. if they kill it now we won't be able to uncover new layering interactions, bugs, odd behaviours.
---
I agree, but if it's tuned so aggressive that they lose testing muscle for everything else, abd reduce sample size for layering 
---
From an engineering standpoint layer swap transitions could be tested with unit/integration tests. A multitude of contexts is what will bring out errors, edge cases, and race conditions. 
---
Each player loss is a loss in the complexity of the context created. Also they have/had stress tests with toooons of people. 
---
I'm sure they have a reason, but I think they've gone a bit overboard fixing a temporary "feature" and killing their ability to test permanent content. Most of the bugs I reported weeks ago at 1-30 still exist. I know they'll release fixes in waves, but those fixes and new content need fixing. They're starting to run out of time and volunteers to do all of that rapidly.
---
&gt;From design philosophy standpoint layering is a new technical compromise and feels like a slap in the face to the old developer mindset that was weighing pros and cons of even instanced dungeons. 
---
    This is my main complaint about your post. The emancipation proclamation was a slap in the face to most the founding fathers but its praised today. A new age required us to move forward. The 2004 game devs never thought they'd have millions of players flooding fresh servers at the same moment.
---
Silithus had also pretty tough ones.
---
1.  Yes, but I don't think they will have the focus for both.  Maybe BM is different?  idk
---
2.  dps would be the same.  atk speed is different.
---
3. good question.  idk.  I wouldn't see why it wouldn't on a boss.
---
4.  no.  I have seen controversial answers on this.  The most consistent I have seen is the the +5 racials is the equivalent to 3% hit.
---
5.  Yes.  Next physical atk.  The range is short though, so you only get it if you are standing really close for some reason, or the pet isn't attacking.
---
6. idk, it should
---
7.  like this,  https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php
---
8, idk prob
---
Lol. I played on private servers. Most of them were shit, and the ones that weren't never lasted.
---
You're projecting pretty hard with all this "reeeeee" talk. Again, you're the one with the problem. I'm just telling you why your problem doesn't matter to Blizzard and most people who are going to play.
---
Warlock has the same issues with pet management.
---
"LFM one more dps"
---
Regular tanking gear mitigation? or regular tanking gear threat? I was talking about more in a hypothetical bubble so forget about there being angry warriors or anybody else being in the world. I was just wondering what caused more threat out of attack power and spell power on a paladin.
---
Don't judge the player, judge the mindset. Could also be said about the human.
---
This is much of what is wrong with gaming in general, i thought about it while reading steam reviews.
---
Everybody demands or atleast thinks they deserve their recognition or their opinion to be highly valued.
---
They write reviews of early access games claiming it is utter shit cause some things does not work (duh it's Early access), they want their changes implemented or they not gonna play. They                   think developers should answer them at every hour.
---
And so this translates to us. As gamers and group. We also build up these ridiculous ideas. We feel entitled to so much. And we should have expectations within reason. Nothing wrong with that.
---
But any player, whether they are retail, private server, old or young. Will look at it differently and we cannot bash some "sense" into anyone.
---
We can steer people in the right direction and be a good community, friendly, welcoming, helpful.
---
And that is what we can do. So i don't see a problem at all, but it requires all of us to behave, not only those who will join at later stages as we expect or feel entitled to.
---
Im with you on all things you listed except blizzard. After you get evo and mana gem you should be able to have the mana to aoe with nova/blizz.
---
Mate you are embarasing yourself. Google a bit before spewing nonsense.
---
warlocks useless in pve, lmao yea keep dreaming mr mage
---
I suffer from the same dilemma as you. I cant decide between these 2 races and that goes for 3 months now.
---
At the moment I prefer troll voodoo style and their racials. But I prefer Undead movement and cast animations.
---
**Devouring plague** has a cooldown of 3 minutes, is very mana intesive and can be decurse by paladins and other priests though. 
---
**Shadowguard** can procc Blackout like every of these 4 racials, but it has a special place. Because it can procc on any attack or cast that targets you and it is a very very nice feeling, when a mage or a hunter surprises you from behind and get stunned with their first attack. :-)
---
The game world has a limited amount of resources. 10k private servers already need dynamic respawn, 20k would be absolutely unplayable without custom spawn times.
---
I replied to Soupasoka [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4dfbk/meta_what_is_going_on_with_the_moderation_of_this/erwz31f/) with the thrust of it being that
---
&gt; How many threads do we need saying 'my single-sentence solution to layering' that present the exact same solution we've seen on a daily basis in at least 140 characters or less? 
---
In this specific case, as a matter of a game mechanic being introduced that precludes the possibility of community, I believe that most of these should be allowed to remain because this is the primary place that the non-subscribed community chooses to congregate. It's valuable to collectively express ourselves to Blizzard. Every person visibly speaking out against layering, either in its currently iteration or in any form, is someone who may be perceived by staff in Cupertino as part of a large group. Maybe large enough that the concerns are  made known to Ion Hazzikostas. 
---
In terms of general deletion policy in general I suppose that % drops significantly if the 13 of 39 deleted posts having to do with layering had not been deleted. Which is my point: I think you guys do a good job here and I am thankful for the time put in. I gladly took a day ban when I talked politics, my other deletions felt legit, you always reply to mod mail quickly. It's the context of community outcries that I'm concerned about. No matter what the issue: layer, loot trading, or something else...if a large percentage of people are trying to be seen making their opinions known about a very pertinent game-related issue then they should be allowed to be seen. They're doing it with good intentions and in direct relation to the game they want to love, including my [blacked.com](https://blacked.com) propaganda picture of streamers disgust faces when they got [layered.com](https://layered.com)
---
"You think you want layering removed, but you don't" - Blizzard, probably
---
Mhm
---
The 77 day number is for their 'minor' patches (X.X.5) that I mentioned in my post.  And I also even said that DM would be in line with their 'minor' patches.  However, they have also slowed down since Legion, as 8.1.5 took 91 days from 8.1, and 8.2 is going to be on 105 days since 8.1.5.  So it wouldn't be unreasonable for it to be longer than their Legion cycle time.
---
So, 2-3 months like I said in my post?
---
Can you send me your mac mini config ?
---
&gt;classic redditor just cherrypick what you want, ignore the rest
---
Says the you who picked two sentences to respond to and didn't even have a rebuttal.
---
The thing is...I won't have to thanks to layering :)
---
You're the one who has a decision to make.
---
Layering should have a mega thread. I'm sick of seeing the same posts over and over again from people who don't even understand how the system is supposed to work. I just report it all as spam at this point.
---
Is there more to do at 60 for hunter or rogue? I feel like I want to play hunter because of solo farming, fun in bgs, tricking new players into attacking my pet, etc, but bgs don't even come out for months and rogues are more fun in world pvp stealing devilsaurs and killing auctioneers
---
I'm excited to see the entire general chat spanmed with "this is our chosen unofficial RP-PvP realm" to let everyone know since blizzard is giving a blind eye to RP-PvP.
---
Same here, the only reason I don’t play WoW regularly at the moment is my friends were always max level and didn’t wanna level another character they’ve already done. I’m super excited
---
 There are hundreds if bot thousands bugs overall. At this point ita obvious they are not fixing anything at reasonable pace, except few "reseearches" there and there.
---
 All the memes aside privates has better client than actual blizzard and we are just over 2 months away from launch lol. The shitshow will be glorious when people realise blizz released another barely alpha worthy game.
---
nice repost from friday fam
---
A lot of people hate modern WoW with a passion and they hate Blizzard even more. If Classic were be sold to a different company they would cheer for months. There's no point in arguing with them, they're too jaded and bitter people.
---
The people working on Classic WoW are the people who worked on retail WoW up until the announcement of Classic WoW. They are not different. They accepted the horrible state the game is in on retail and they are now in charge of restoring Vanilla WoW, having taken many missteps already.
---
It's important to bring this up to avoid similar mistakes popping up again. Just see with layering already, it's completely broken, no matter how long it's there, it's going to ruin immersion in one way or another. It may be a necessary evil at launch, but that doesn't mean it's a good addition either.
---
Idk but they are so coordinated and ridiculous that I always chuckle when I get ganked by them. I really miss there actually being horde in STV on beta
---
Gear doesn‘t make much of a difference for AoE farming. Additional stam and int gives you a bit more leeway for pulls, but since Blizzard has such a poor spellpower coefficient, gear doesn‘t matter too much. So I‘d say the guy with gathering profs pulls ahead.
---
Disney did with star wars lol
---
Once Classic is out it's on maintenance mode. The devs can relax and rest then.
---
Soul Shards
---
No raid spot
---
Ammo and meat
---
Yep, basically this. And it will be super fun, and will definitely happen.

First I want to thank you for your detailed reply and I just want to say that the decphering of the rules doesn't work if you take into account what is currently present on the "hot" page of classicwow, and that's where the discrepancy came up. Even if I "think" it might be a low-effort meme, but I see similar posts, the rules won't matter because if a post exists for more than 24h without being removed, that is a clear sign of what is allowed to be posted, more so than the rules can ever show or say. Anyways, I've sent you a message where I pasted all of the conversation.
---
Au - something something - ism...
---
Queues and free transfers off realms with long queues
---
What on Azeroth are people in this thread talking about? 
---
What's layering and how is it a good/bad thing?
---
It’s the 2018 i5 model, with memory upgraded to 32gb.
---
Dr Claw. It's always Dr Claw.
---
It seems likely to me that Blizz are being mum on the subject because they want it out as soon as they can, however they can't put a definitive date on it, nobody knows how many people will join and that's the deciding factor. 
---
This is hurting the discussion and causing (I imagine) many people to be in the same boat as you when it comes to the topic.
---
you may want to reread the question
---
Engkish isnt your firat language is it ?
---
This is exactly what I did when I started back in '05. UD mage and then picked up mining/engi, because it sounded cool, and people said to get mining as it works well with it.
---
I was never a rich mage. But I still have that OG mage, and I still have mining and engineering on him.
---

---
Would it be better if all could reserve names and then for sure you a lot would just reserve some names and never play afterwards
---
1. reason i asked is since pettopia doesnt include this info.
---
2. thanks
---
3.  .
---
4. that is good to know :)
---
5. are you absolutely sure ? afterall the spell does specify "physical" but not if ranged or melee. Theres a comment about using a macro to cast multishot whenever it is up.
---
6. would be nice if that is the case
---
7. again petopia has limited info

8. "should work" doesnt exactly apply to 1.12.1 or classic as things arent as they appear, for example most would assume sitting down and being critically hit should trigger reckoning or enrage etc. but it should not. many would also assume spellpower have no effect on weapons but that isnt fully true either as there are exceptions such as Hakkars axe.
---
Use wow forums. There is less censorship then here.
---
Oh man, a dads guild filled with 9 to 5 dads making stupid jokes. I'm in.
---
You are 100% right.  People are settling for a worse game out of some fabricated fear of long queues and pathetic need to level uninterrupted.  IMO layering is the opposite of what you want in Classic.  Overpopulation is *good* in Classic because it forces people out of their mindless leveling routine.  Of course, Blizzard has no ability to see the ramifications of changes, no surprise there.
---
I need to know where you got your ability to know the future from. 
---
If you’re this cynical, why even play?
---
I have the beta b.net app, and it gives the option to download WoW Classic next to retail. NOT where "in development" section where the PTR and BETA should be. I'm EU and never gotten any beta/stress test available.

Gummy is one of them I’m told

---
I know most changes that lead to "new age" WoW were praised, although they were wrong changes from this different design philosophy standpoint.
---
There is no such thing as objective "move forward", and certainly no "requirement" to do so. Instead it's mostly just badly understood principles (without knowledge of all their consequences) that are implemented through mass suggestions and the perceived certainty of progress. John Gray has commented on that: https://youtu.be/jmRBHCclzZk
---
Without going too much into politics (because the rules of this subreddit prevent me from refuting your claim, i.e. this discussion takes place in an inherently skewed environment), I'll just say that I agree that the 2004 devs didn't expect millions to come, but layering is not a solution to login problems, it's just their modern server structure that they have to use to minimize servers idle resources.
---
The game releases at 3PM PST on the 26th where I live.  I work swing(2:30PM-11), so I'll be taking at least the 26th and 27th off from work.  Maybe the 28th too if I have the PTO.
---
Sadly you cant compare it. 
---
Classic will be fun, but remember we are just walking roads that others walked before us. 
---
I know streamers and wannabees will declare world firsts. But the world first ragnaros kill will not be the world first, because the world first was years ago. 
---
Wearing a thunderfury in classic will not be the same as wearing a thunderfury back in vanilla.
---
because he wants to get the vanilla game play and not some legion hybrid with sharding?

i would also like to know what are your reasons to trust this company blindly.
---
Warlock, Hunter - you base your performance and perhaps even put your life in the hands of AI which was coded entirely in a week by a intern 15 years ago
---
Feral Druid - you can kind of do everything but situations where doing everything is necessary or welcome don't really exist in the game

Blizzard can have more servers than a private server.  They could easily start with as many servers as they need and condense them down over time.
---
Can we also please start removing posts of people just saying how excited they are for classic?
---
Both are the same counts
---
40 mans were tuned around 25 solid players and 15 fools.. if everyone actually uses their classes to the fullest and doesn’t “afk” throughout fights I think we’ll be fine.

People used to do BWL with 1/4 of the raid in a slideshow FPS wise
---
Not worrying *yet*, still ages to go. It could be backlogged &amp; considered easy fix or they could be batching roll outs of some fixes. 
---
It absolutely must be changed before live though.
---
More like rush to tag a mob as it spawns
---
Probably some intellectuals, but my bet is on three friends wanting to have fun, I am on board every time for that
---
Care to explain? I'm not worried about login problems, surely the world integrity is more important than downtime or queues?
---
Insert hunger games quote 😁
---
3. Shaman can be a good dps (watch some Unbreakable videos), Paladin is only for buffs.
---
5. Watch some generic leveling guide, don't spend money 'till lvl40(you need tons of gold for your first mount), but the most important thing is: just enjoy the adventure, read everything, don't rush!
---
Makes sense that beta is getting less popular. I guess most are waiting for the live game. No point in burning yourself out with a beta on a char that gets wiped.

You mean the design philosophy that led to WOTLK's success? Since it was during WOTLK that the game had the most players.

I think you should familiarize yourself with the "appeal to popularity logical fallacy".

If Pservers are overtuned as stated - i’m going to laugh so hard. Our casual guild cleared 4-5 bosses of Naxx opening week.

Well it makes senso to compare them because itd the same franchise. Just like people compare the dark souls 1, 2 and 3, the star wars movies, game of thrones and asiof, different albums from an artist etc. Comparisons between stuff of the same genre will always happen let alone the same franchise.
---
Modern expansions have had much better launches than Vanilla did. But what does that matter? There are good game lauches all the time, yet it doesn't mean anything if the game doesn't feel like Classic.

Well we were having enough fun to have &gt;600 people on ally before the mega aggressive layering. It is what it is though.
---
I'm just gonna FaP in your face.
---
a bit? this sub sucks donkey dicks now.

Yeah well LFG isn't gamebreaking either.
---
Layering, like LFG, has effects that make the game worse, and in a way that permeates throughout gameplay.

Great reply. Personally I think memes that bash retail players should be removed. It makes the community look cringy, insecure and not welcoming.

I started as horde back in vanilla.  My one alliance I have was leveled strictly through pet battles.

I’m tempted to level an alliance now just for a change.
---
i loaned 60 gold at level 48 from a friend to buy my first mount

You are talking about a minority, though, while OP is talking about a majority.
---
Assuming OP will be at least average then he will be the same level as the majority (not literally the same, but around same bracket). People with MC on farm in the first month will be a very small fraction of the player base.
---
There are multiple copies of the world running concurrently. (Think phasing but expanded)
---
Basically that means you can be running around the zone and poof someone you were running towards disappears into another "layer".
---
Herb/mining nodes are on different layers, as such it's rife for abuse. Oh black lotus in this spot? Let me hop layers and gather it on the next layer too. Oh getting ganked? Hop layers poof they disappear.
---
Slap back because I'm the healer and I'm a paladin. King's Honour!
---
Most people barely had 2 dedicated computers - i’ll be running dual-screens 24/7 which makes questing a breeze even without addons. It meant on my first time in any dungeon I could pull up an overview. 
---
Information was valuable back in 04’ now its an expectation.
---
So characters ... does this mean I I have a main(level cap) and 4 alts (which I only level between say 5-15) then I would only be 20% of characters reaching max level.  If so this doesn't seem that bad since I would imagine most people would make several alts to feel out all the other classes, especially after maxing out the level cap.  I think in vanilla I had characters of every single class but only mained and leveled 3 to 60 (all on different servers with different sets of alts, so some alt classes repeated).
---
There are many specs a lot more useless than feral. You are not useless as an offtank and its somewhat viable even as a dps with the right rotation and gear. They are one of the best levelers and are good dungeon tanks. They are far for being useless
---
The humans racials dont suck BECAUSE the gnomes are better (for pvp and for casters). 
---
The human racials suck for pvp all by their own in the game design - for pvp and for casters. 
---
Escape is a 1min CD. Its super damn strong.  Id say more strong for warriors to use it out of a Nova for example. But still snares/roots a huge part of PVP. 
---
Also the increased intellect is really nice.
---
How will they split 5 layers of people into 1 layer in phase 2?
---
The assumed removal of layering is like the assumed removal of sharding. It doesn't take a genius to point out that their server infrastructure is now sharded everywhere, so they will just add some custom code to it to force world bosses with their zones and raid groups into single layer.
---
Raptors too.
---
Layering as hurt, but also after AV weekend a lot of people who aren't interested in BIS just felt there was nothing left to do on characters that will be deleted (last part hugely important distinction from how Classic will be).

Honestly I think that the mods are keeping this sub from going to complete hell. The sheer amount of topic of the week, I hate retail, and 0 effort karma grabs would get out of control very quickly. Im all for discussion but I dont really understand why people feel the need to post their opinion over and over when the same one has been posted 1000s of times already. People are losing their damn minds watching other people play the beta and I am really hoping that the gatekeeping, REEEing, and general douchebaggery drops off when we actually have game to play (and that it doesn't translate into the game community)
---
The only good bug is a dead bug!
---
Sorry my optimism offends you so. 
---
I hate the boneheaded decisions Blizzard has made as much as anyone. 
---
I loathe the changes made to the game in the last several expansions, and I don’t trust them implicitly, but at the same time, I do feel like they’re trying to recreate the experience as best they can, knowing there will be tourists and people who never got to play Vanilla, and know that there *will* be population fluctuations, and doing the best they can without having to resort to universally unpopular strategies like server mergers.
---
If this makes me a shill, as I’ve been accused of, then whatever. I feel like compromises need to be made to deal with the initial overpopulation on realms. Nobody wants ridiculous queues and nobody wants sharded zones throughout the entire game.
---
Screw that I'm buying blues I only use 4-5 levels.
---
nah cos the context is 'MC on farm within a month'  
---
so that context then passes to the statements about time-to-60.  It's absolute terms not relevant terms, so if you're saying 7 days to 60 in this conversation, it's implied that this is 1 week of real time not /played
---
sorry to be pedantic :D
---
I've tanked since WotLK and I don't think I could have without my taunt mouseover macro. A mob runs to your healer? Mouseover and press the button, mob comes back. Never had to lose focus of your target.
---
Had the same for intercept, it was incredibly easy to use this to catch up to people in dungeons / battlegrounds, just mouseover and woosh. 
---
And the throw that I had at one point that silenced people (gag order??). So if I see someone casting in the distance, I could mousover interupt them and they'd come running in my melee range while I was still tanking the other mobs.
---
WF MC should be done first or second week. You don’t need 40man to really be able to clear mc with good people and the mechanincs are trash simple for people who raid as a living. I’m not even sure 60 is needed to enter the raid.
---
Because geared Warriors with a Healbot are Gods in Vanilla.
---
Nah dawg its obvs gonna take another 154 days to get Rag down again. Everyone forgot the strats.. (/s)
---
All pets*
---
Many top guilds are going to have rag down by week 2 or 3. And it's going to be a joke from there.
---
It's not a matter of skill involved at this point, or needing to nerf the boss. It's a matter of time invested to get 40 people at 60, attuned, and have the FR for the tanks to survive.
---
The Knicker I think since someone said 4.0

I have been apart of many MMO's right from the start and nothing excites me more than WoW classic again!
---
That feeling lasts about 15min. Then you'll type in /who to find out about 120 ppl are already lvl 7 while you are stuck waiting for mob spawns as a lvl 2.
---
Then your anxiety will come back.
---
BWL will be on farm from first day by top 10% guilds. AQ and naxx probably in a week . 
---
APES cleared naxx like what? 1h30 after release?
---
and BWL prep/gewr req is a joke compared to naxx
---
You could argue private server is different, but the values will differ like 10% up or down, no huge differences.
---
i am gonna push to get 60 at a reasonable rate but i'm also going to take time out to have fun, do professions, joke around etc because a big part of classic WoW is the journey and not just the end game.  I'm not a fan of leveling alts so i don't wanna just blitz through the leveling for the sake of getting to 60
---
I agreed with you. 77 days is 2.5 months. I was concurring
---
Ikr xD xD xD
---
I’m running classic on a 7 year old AMD A6 APU with 4gb of ram on high settings. It got a bit stuttery during the AV test, but runs just fine otherwise.
---
Pretty sure if trolls would have had proper foot armor instead of just running around barefoot all the time they would have been one of the more popular races in WoW.
---
I want to know as well so I’ll wait for answers. I want to donate my old PCs to friends so they can play classic.
---
If it has a GeForce it’s really really good. 
---
I don’t even have that on a 2014 MacBook and it runs amazing
---
This is probably the main reason why it can go from a few days to several months to get to 60. While obviously a lot comes down to efficiency, those taking several months probably only play two hours a day or something like that, where as those that hit 60 within the first week are literally just playing WoW and spending a few hours on preparing food (which is mostly already prepared pre-launch) and sleeping only for the time that is needed.
---
Inb4 potion sellers, charging ridiculous prices for your elixirs, ruin your day.
---
&gt;There is no such thing as objective "move forward", and certainly no "requirement" to do so. Instead it's mostly just badly understood principles (without knowledge of all their consequences) that are implemented through mass suggestions and the perceived certainty of progress.
---
I can't tell if this is about history or video games. I'm not really looking for a historical debate, it was just an example that I felt was similar. Both groups had a very limited perspective of the future and both groups could possibly have a different point of view with our current knowledge.
---
It might be cynicism, but really I've literally been there and seen how these companies handle games. I unfortunately won't get to play Classic, but I'm still interested to discuss the game. I might get a chance to log on briefly in 2020 or 2021.
---
Nice fro
---
I think you will be fine, WoW has never been the most graphically intense game any ways so you should be good.
---
You failed to see my point.
---
Germans can talk English, but they're more inclined to CHOOSE to not talk English.
---
&gt;You clearly haven't been in Germany ever
---
I'm drive through Germany 4 times a year, and I stay multiple days each time.
---
I’m looking forward to it overall but it’ll never be like it was back in Vanilla. That’s Ok though.
---
"16 debuff slots is stupid. It is a technical solution to a hardware problem that no longer exists..."
---
Argh you're right, I know I know it from somewhere but I can't think!
---
Actually.. whenever you harvest a Blotus its on a timer. If you can figure out which layer you are on you can do say, Silithus herbing laps and cross out each layer per loop..
---
Funny enough if it works how it seems, it may actually be more farmable then ever.
---
So here is a quick guide :  
---
\- Don't play retail (BFA)  
---
\- Don't go in the Alliance (Those guys don't know how to fight)  
---
\- Play what you feel you'll be enjoying the most o/  
---
The leveling is part of the amazing adventure of WoW and people tend to forget about that.  
---
I can't remember memorable moments of my pexing starting Cataclysm till Legion, because it was most likely a rush on my end, it wasn't difficult, it wasn't memorable, oh sure it was epic, with the great cinematics, the story-telling and such, but it felt dull and empty. Nothign felt dangerous or rewarding, you were just lucky sometimes or something somewhat funny happened.  
---
In the end, you'll be playing a real MMORPG, just have fun and try to get help if you struggle, even whisper this lvl 60 warlock that just happen to be there for help. Hell, he might even give you a GP?  
---
Write your own story man, create your character, enter the world, live the adventure! o/
---
Thanks that answers that question. Never thought I would have to be querying PC specs again, I left the PC arms race when I quit WoW 6 years ago!
---
The best area to play as begin leveling is actually ghostlands, even though it was added in BC it follows the paradigm of classic more than the cataclysm content that is the main world now. 
---
Other than that just thinking about what role and gameplay style interests you. Do you wanna be front line, defender, back line, crowd control master, healing , support ? What do you enjoy doing will help you know what kind of character to make in classic. 
---
I’m working on an Adventure Basics educational learning plan to help out all the players coming to classic as Wow first timers, you didn’t have the experience we have had in Vanilla’s original season.
---
Great track!
---
No guild bank. People used to use separate alts as guild banks tho.
---
Leeway is not confirmed correct. People on both sides of the argument are arguing that it did or did not exist by using 15 year old laggy videos as “proof”. One person looks at one time stamp and says “look, he hit from so far, leeway existed!”, then another guy looks at a different time stamp in the same video and says “look, he wasn’t hit, there was no leeway!”.
---
He asked a yes-or-no question.
---
This bot doesn't even check if the post I replied to even had the word "or".
---
0/5 no effort.

---
Current wow plays a bit like whack a mole, which does create a bit more excitement in mundane tasks like spell rotations. The story and the gameplay has moved forward so there could be a culture shock. As for classic wow, expect a lot of ganking and tough leveling if you are behind the curve. With no battlegrounds high levels will have very little else to do but hunt your ass down and make you corpse run.

---
What you could do, is set up and trial account to test if it works  
---
I totally assume if you can run Current WoW, you can run Classic
---
I mean, you'll probably have to change potatoes pretty often but it should work. We talking Idaho Russets?
---
Ah, no, /played! But he also says he won't be getting "world first" because the one who does won't be sleeping at all. So he expects the "fastest" leveler to be someone who stays awake for four days in one go... Will be interesting to see how it turns out!
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion here but I think I prefer this kind of exploits being possible in the first 2-3 weeks of server life than having to wait 3 weeks to level up to 10 in Mulgore because of overpopulation...
---
Anyway, I think the server players or auction will not be unbalanced due to this during a few weeks. I just **really hope** blizzard shuts off layering as they promised a few weeks on...
---
Hatespeech btw. Fucking npc mods
---
No one has figured out a good solution to crunch time in software yet (in my experience). It is compounded in the gaming industry because there are a lot of young devs that are really passionate about working on games so they are willing to do it. Also, towards the end of a project you can't just bring on more people because it will take to long for them to learn the system and code base to contribute in a meaningful way (and the experienced guys slow down to teach them). I never worked in games specifically but I used to crunch very very hard in my 20s. I do it much less now but it still happens. There has never been a software system deployed that did not have bugs (to my knowledge) because it is basically mathematically impossible to complete a 100% test of all use cases. No real insight here, just keep this in mind when all of the "lazy" and "incompetent" dev posts start flying. I would absolutely hate the playerbase if I worked on games so I have a lot of sympathy for those guys.
---
So just because asmongold tweets about needing more beta players you think blizzard will invite more?
---
Level up a toon on pservers. Take the time to read quest and enjoy the scenery. When a new server opens up it's not a good experience at all. Trust me on this one, you won't enjoy it.

Copy and pasting what I told another gentlemen. 
---
I feel that what you said is true, even though it's more related to the downfall of current wow and the nostalgia every that played back then feel towards this game.  
---
Don't be too harsh towards people though, everyone is here to enjoy his playtime :)
---
There's plenty of reason to think they won't be fixed since they've been broken in the same way on live since Legion.
---
&gt;Meanwhile other people are doing better job for free.
---
PServers are not Classic and are full of inaccuracies and bugs. Scaling and authentic Classic experience to millions of people using a modern engine requires significant engineering effort and it's a labor of love on the part of the devs. Fuck off with you entitled attitude. Nobody is obliged to crunch and sacrifice their health and personal life to give you a toy to play with.
---
I like your second point a lot, in all MMOs in the past ive pretty much just hit accept quest, killed my X mobs, and moved on. Looking forward to taking my time with this one :)
---
That's awesome. I'm posting it on my discord if you don't mind.
---
Except if you are in the Alliance of course. I hope you'll die after 4 misses on a lvl 4 boar.
---
Imagine if those were all just bugs originally and now they fixed hunters to not be OP in 1v1
---
Warlock - you have to carry soul shard and manage it and deal with pet Misbehavior, and mages have cc and stronger damage so you get to put up with being annoyed by them as your rival on group comps. 
---
Hunter - you have to carry ammo, learn feeding pets, learn managing pet behavior and glitches in its behavior (like warlock), generally we expect any hunter to be somewhat ignorant and cause is some trouble on any given activity - but proving yourself as a cc master and very good control of your pet to not pulling everything in a zone without realizing it likely feels very rewarding. 
---
Feral - it’s just unfinished as a spec but I’m not a major expert

Just change it to crunches, you dingdong.
---
Situps ARE bad for you.
---
It's been almost 15 years. The game has been data mined and theory crafted to hell and back, the content will be trivial to the current playerbase. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.
---
The hardest part will be leveling efficiently and pre raid gearing for bis.
---
The real question though: do you really think you can handle the potions?
---
Developing an addon to exploit a feature that will be in the game only for a few weeks ([source](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow)) seems like wasted time to me. I hope Blizzard stay on their words and disable layering quickly
---

In empty areas, not on launch I would presume.

A new pservers just opened up. You can literally stay over the spawn of a mob, a new one appears as soon as the other died. Black lotus every 20 minutes. You like this solution better?
---
That one doesn't mean the twink is impressive, that one just means the twink has an impressive friend.
---
Big fucking yikes at the comments in this thread. Crunch is NEVER okay and often just leads to a worse quality, buggier product down the line. Nobody is obliged to sacrifice their personal lives and wellbeing to give you a nice toy to play with on time. So far the Classic devs have indicated that this project is nothing less than a labor of love for them and I sincerely hope they August release date is a date that was well-planned to avoid crunch for the team.
---
No patch notes but they have been patching and fixing bugs for sure

Nah, vanilla launch increases the numbers over time: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_gapvINEFyA/UfKCQPB0OhI/AAAAAAAAFFM/XbER2QNSACQ/s1600/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin.jpg
---
Yeah the layering got turned up the moment it came back up from AV that was a big time 1-2 punch. 
---
It's a shame more people don't want to try and get the BIS stuff, because imo that has been the best part of the beta. Not in a min-maxing type way, but the challenge is way beyond anything you're supposed to encounter in 5 mans. I have a helmet from a searing gorge quest that took 10, a chest piece from killing several level 50 elites, and a death ray from farming lvl 58 elites for hours on end. My pants came from Maraudon which is crazy difficult at 40. My MH is from a Hinterlands quest that involves going into ZF as is my carrot on a stick.
---
If you think doing stairs or gahz is intense normally try it at level 40. We've had to prepare for each of these things as thoroughly as one would prepare for a raid. I've had a very very good time with it.
---
How about you just relax. It's better than taking 3 hours to complete the starter quests.
---
WoW even in Classic was never made for 8,000 farming the same location.
---
Shadowfang
---
Settle down beavis
---
His name is ButtFart88.  I dont think I'd describe him as a "snarky knowitall".  The term I'd probably use is "troll" or "manchild".
---
Thats because you have selected only one realm.
---
If you wanna see the chart from the image, you have to select both, pve and pvp realm: https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?dateFrom=2019-06-21&amp;realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvP&amp;realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvE
---
It is a big time investment for stuff that has absolutely no permanence. I understand why they see it as a waste if time.
---
When I was bored walking through the barrens I would jump and try to do 360's with the mouse to continue running on the same line when I reached the ground.
---
Looked funny with a large kodo.
---
Yes but here's an easy way to try. You can level up to 20 free on retail and it's using the same engine. Install it an give it a go.
---
There will also be a competition for quests/mobs, so things might not go as smooth as one would hope.
---
Runs fine on my I5 laptop with Intel 620, so you'll be fine. Just download retail if you want to check, classic is less intensive than that.
---
Are you on the wrong sub. I almost never see mentions or comparisons of modern wow here.....
---
They also got Stratholme's entrance wrong, this is the TBC Stratholme.
---
But we wanted a release date. In all honesty they’re not going to give an update on every bug fix. The advantage of having so many testers is that they’ll find far more to fix than they could. I have no doubt in my mind they’re working overtime to fix it.
---
I’ve felt this way every day since experience vanilla and bc and every day since they were over.
---
I believe Joana always did his speedruns on new servers, but i am not sure. But yeah not everyone will be able to get ahead of the pack on launch for sure.
---
If you are going to places see a mana user farming drop your mount (unless you travelform everywhere) and blast a innervate in their face. If you have a macro make sure its in caps "YOU ARE INNERVATED" when you cast it on people, so they know you got their back, then ofc a mark of the wild, if its a pet always a mark **and** a thorns, you can ignore the thorns on the player if you like.
---
I can so feel the rage of running into you guys in a BG.
---
this. i dont see how they can enjoy twinking and pressing 3 buttons basically.
---
i've never got to 60 in vanilla because i've spent so much time playing bgs on level 49 as a rogue. wasnt a twink, just a regular rogue having a lot of fun
---
Fuck off with your entitled attitude.
---
If you are leveling up a melee buy the upgrade of your weapon until level 15 are the vendor. The trashy grey sword or axes. Even the smallest of upgrades will make you level up faster and you won't miss the coppers.
---
Loved the 39 bracket so much
---
Howl adds a flat amount to your weapon damage, both melee and ranged. You can see that number in your character screen if you hover over the weapon damage it shows 123-234 (+X). It works like a scope but only for a single attack, so faster weapons gain more dps for the calculation of the next normalized instant attack.
---
Given this you can calculate how much ap your howl is worth on average. It's not much but better than nothing.
---
In the case of 1. Petopia does show clearly that cats can have both abilities(remember to look at the family for what they can be taught). There’s no practical reason to have both though, imo claw is better.
---
And if you see that on a lvl 39 shammy - just pay dead.
---
Ive never had a server in my native language, i dont really see that as a problem.
---
Yes but unlike LFR layering is only going to be a few weeks
---
Well, classic is not an unknown game people will discover. You should probably check expansions launch for a more accurate comparu.
---
That graph has far too low a resolution to show launch spikes
---
Duskwood is hands down the best leveling zone in the game. Cool creepy vibe the whole time, roaming giant skull elite, fantastic quest chains immerse you in the zone. There is nothing else like it!
---
Username checks out
---
You have to be a troll warrior with engineering or you suck.
---
That counts for individual plans, but there will always be one person who is furthest ahead, with the least amount of competition for quests/mobs, on every server. And besides knowing your route, not sleeping is the best way to become that person after the first day.
---
WotLK was still a success, but it was fundamentally different from the original design. I have no doubt that later designs were also succesful, even BfA is relqtively speaking, but there was a certain magic to Vanilla's design that was succesful for its own and different reasons: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_gapvINEFyA/UfKCQPB0OhI/AAAAAAAAFFM/XbER2QNSACQ/s1600/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin.jpg
---
Neigh?
---
If the speed run I watched of a troll hunter with blue hair is genuine, then the place was rather empty 😅
---
Despite what a lot of people here will say, modern wow is still enjoyable - just not as a "permanent game", so to speak. Treat it as a themepark - arrive, check out the main attractions, visit the different exhibits, ride the rides, then when you're bored move on until they add new stuff.
---
The visual quality is still great. The story  is still fun (although not sure how long that will last). The new patch (coming this wednesday) is bringing a lot of cool shit. For me personally (and for a lot of people) the main "irk" is the overall game design direction that blizzard is taking. Its still a fun game for casuals or new players to dive into.
---
There are a lot of issues that Retail does wrong though. It heavily dilutes the sense of community, as well as sense of accomplishment. You are rained with epics, you can find group without ever talking to anyone, etc. This all results in you being alone in a sea of people, showered in rewards, and having to grind to keep up in power. A lot of us are bored of that.
---
That's where classic comes in. THe original game, made by gamers for gamers. Game is harder, game is longer, game is tougher, game is more fun. Grouping is almost mandatory, there's a lot of social aspects, there's a lot of actual old-school RPG elements etc. 
---
Classic and retail are 2 completely different beasts. Both are good (and bad) in their own ways. Classic is not faultless - it has plenty of faults. Its just for a lot of people the "good" of classic outweighs the bad.
---
There's not really much you need to know, enjoy your fresh view - just keep in mind that going into classic from retail will feel a bit strange. Older graphics, less functionality, etc. If anything, i would say wait until classic comes out, play classic, then if you dont like it try playing retail.
---
You made the perfect choice for your needs, as a header endgame you’re still very valuable due to innervate and cres + strong healing.
---
Enjoy yourself
---
because it was new and not many people instantly jumped on new games like they do now. times change. 
---
now everyone and their mothers with a sub will join on classic release because why not? subbed anyway 
---
\+ all the people that are waiting for classic 
---
its gonna be way diffrent then the launch of wow
---
Its not better than taking 3 hours to complete the starter quests retard. If you want Sharding go back to bfa and do world quests.
---
It only appears to go down.
---
It’s the mods fault
---
If you were on the recent undocumented servers new realm launch on Saturday, if you dislike layering in the starting zone you're a moron.
---
Oh yeah because private servers are identical to blizz servers:-)
---
The community might be toxic but not because we downvote shitty repeat posts
---
Most people will play on rppvp servers when classic releases
---
First day grad school just happens to be the day of launch 🙃 ...
---
Sometimes I feel like the world does this on purpose.

I'm lucky Google is good. However I don't want to install an addon in my work browser \^\^
---
I can't believe in 2019 this simple functionality is not standard !
---
Thanks anyway.
---
Take a laptop with you and send her off for a long massage on the beach. Theres some time to get the feeling of the launch
---
Agreed. But we got what we got. Not that I think we should be grateful enough that classic is even a thing and just shut up and stop constantly complaining, though.
---
The dev teams have their hands full with a strict deadline to work on. If after launch the lack of communication still exists then we should totally take a stand with the justified grounds to do so. But until then what other options have we got?
---
Kinda sucky, but it is what it is.
---
The nice thing about retail is that you get a good feel for the classes at early levels. I highly suggest playing all of the classes to level 10 to see what you like/don't like about them. Also try out both factions to see which one you enjoy more. Also do the same with professions to see what you like.
---
Once you know your preferred faction, race, and class, I'd start thinking about what you want from classic. Just want to enjoy the ride? Want to raid in player vs. Environment settings? Want to dominate other actual players in player vs player combat? Depending on the answer to this, you can either play what makes you most happy, or what dominates the most in the field you choose. 
---
Also retail isn't all bad, so level a character you like up in that too and experience the whole story!
---
&gt;But Blizzard can not seriously leave a whole class in such a state
---
Legion Enhancement was an amazing spec to play, then during the BFA beta turned out to be brokenly boring. They didn't fix their issues the entire beta, and launched BFA with a broken spec so most Enh went Demon Hunter (similar to Enh) or Ele. Instead, they promised to fix them for 8.1. No fixes were made. In 8.1 they said 9.0.
---
So there is a precedence.
---
Did u expect a beta without bugs ?
---
Forget the fact it's a meme.  A post being upvoted doesnt mean its "right or correct" just popular.  Conversely a post being downvoted doesn't mean its wrong or bad, just unpopular.
---
Especially with those who've seen it.  I know it's a bit of an odd idea but upvotes Nd downvotes are not some sort of unbiased statistic.  It all depends on the people who bother to read the post that day and whether they agree or disagree with it.
---
Oh I didn't notice that it was both realms lol that makes more sense now.
---
No fish gear.  Nub
---
Jimmy: A WoW Story and Time Gnomes slapped pretty hard, too.
---
I play on Moonglade so it’ll be the EU rp-pve sever for me.
---
I played a NELF male right up until I instanced along humans and realised I was cartoonishly tall by comparison. Changed to hide,  never regretted it :P
---
I think you're confusing formal language and well written sentences with being elitist... OP's not really bashing or excluding anyone in their post, just listing up the ruleset of their ideal server.
---
Balance is good in PVP where you need spike of dmg and you won't get oom in a 30 second fight.
---
Feral is the only other viable tank in the game. The best off-tank in raids because of threat and high armor/health. Hardcore guilds use feral as off-tank. You give 5% Crit to the main melee group.
---
Resto druid are awesome in PVP. The best flag runner. Super fun to play and the PvP gear set have a speed bonus. You don't just heal but use all forms and abilities. I can't think of an abilities you don't use, not like most class who use a simple rotation.
---
Transmog? :D damn son you need to get off retail
---
&gt; Bruh this shit isn't even real....sky looks fake
---
are you actively trying to make it worse for you than it already is?
---
&gt; Says you who picked two sentences to respond to and didn't even have a rebuttal.
---
no u
---
&gt;The thing is...I won't have to thanks to layering :)
---
and a dead game in 6 months :) oh well least we'll always have pservers which we have established you are "above"
---
Just use a single button macro. You push it until all dot are there then it's sends shadowbolt.
---
No..I'm gonna leave it like that as a marker of my stupidity.
---
For what it's worth, rare nodes tend to spawn instead of common nodes:
---
Gold would spawn instead of iron.  Silver instead of tin.  
---
Server hopping works to farm rare nodes, but not in the way you described.
---
Why do people have to ruin a good joke lol. ”Oh he doesnt even have the ring and bis trinbket!!!!”
---
I usually line my char up with auto-run and tab out for maximum efficiency, so far so good but I’ll tell you when my game starts crashing!
---
This is actually how it worked. But also it wouldn't show until some time has passed, too.
---
What do you mean?
---
never lasted? they are still running what kind of backwards shitty 4fun servers were you playing on lmao
---
I rly did some kind of this back in the days during tbc. It helps your brain to keep on track after hours of gaming
---
Modern WoW is the participation trophy side of WoW
---
Well they’re not inviting more people to the beta so I would guess that affects the population
---
Ghostlands doesn’t exists in Classic 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
given time, I am sure I can.
---
A very strict set of rules only a small minority of players have any interest in abiding.
---
I am? Where?
---
sure go for it
---
Look at me I have 5% more dmg on the meter. Everyone else is useless and don't bring any utilities.
---
Are there any streamers and content creators not playing beta after being invited? Like played beta then switched back to bfa?
---
actually you should want to have both as bite has a 10 sec. cd with a higher dmg per energy cost. and claw is more like the spamable no cd version.
---
Read your own comment and think about what your silly down arrow press tells me.
---
You’re very butthurt
---
Personally I have so many memories playing with friends at a young age as horde, so horde it is! I'm pumped for all of the nostalgia that comes with it. Maybe way later I'll go alliance if truly bored.
---
There's a recommended server that put noobs in low pop servers.
---
certainly casting spells with a cast time will interupt autoattack swing timer?
---
Yeah, he said what is the advice for starting wow Right now first
---
Its closer to .50% and thats as a Mage in T2 gear. Its definitely still BiS but its nothing I'd write home about.
---
Question: at what rate does focus restore at ? 100% identical to rogues or ?
---
Actually I wish it was. Love this zone
---
Clearly miss read on my part, I apologise
---
The xbow from LBRS is just easier to get than the handcannon, but the handcannon is actual pre-BIS for every race. I don't think we'll see it for realistic prices in p1, where it's the most useful, so 99,99% of people will strive for the xbow and some very lucky few will get the gun.
---
&gt; huntard bigotry
---
Would you use the correct term?  It's prejudice.
---
&gt;prejudice
---
&gt;an irrational attitude of hostility directed against an individual, a group, a race, or their supposed characteristics
---
Bigotry on the other hand is people who refuse to see anyone's else viewpoint:
---
&gt;big·ot·ry
---
&gt; intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.
---
That's wildstar. lol
---
How about the cloacking device?
---
WoW classic is just to make us wait for WoW2. They will change the formula a bit and start a new game from scratch. Splitting the community makes no sense if they would want to continue development on retail.
---
Does it have to be someone? Could be no one. Could be ooga is a bug in the machine.
---
God i hope every hunter doesnt switch to warlock... i was happy thinking that it was going to be same as usual with warlocks being in demand due to nobody wanting to play them.
---
As far as we know now, there won't be RP-PVP servers at launch.
---
feral druid, ret pally, shadow priest, enhancement shaman, balance druid activist
---
I cannot even imagine what a small brain you must have to first have CLEAR arguements of people explaining why it wasn't like this in vanilla and then providing evidence where you can CLEARLY SEE that there isnt a phase in the hall out of IF, AND STILL NOT BELIEVING IT .. HOW DENSE CAN YOU BE? honestly?
---
Leveling on a fresh can actually be quicker than leveling on an existing server. Once you get passed the initial zerg, literally everywhere is totally empty.
---
Yeah, I can't wait. And I don't think I'll even play it that much. But just the prospect of being able to log-in for 2-3 hours a day and eventually getting 60, probably somewhere around christmas break, is so good. Not to mention that trying to decide between Warlock or Shaman is almost like playing the game right now.
---
Well private servers are the same exact (completed game) client with a core that’s been worked on by multiple teams of people for over 10 years. Classic is recreating it in a new client rewriting new processes to work with vanilla and worst of all have to appease everyone in the classic wow department that isn’t a developer and has no idea what kind of work is needed.
---
Time to abuse some adderall
---
Hunter: 
---
1) People will assume you suck and treat you poorly because if it. 
---
2) Easy to play, difficult to master thus you will probably suck when first learning to play a hunter. 
---
3) You're going to a lot more arrows than you think.  Get ready to always buy arrows every time you enter town and if you forget, you'll end up being the meele huntard that everyone hates in the dungeon.
---
you need like 6 or 7 locks for shadow weaving to be better than just another warlock
---
This guy fucks
---
Not the hunters, it was the pets - everybody always blamed the pets... hunter! dismiss your pet!!

---
Pretty Schaweet
---
&gt; Why would anybody choose to RP on classic instead of retail
---
For me, anyway, Vanilla RPing feels a whole lot more simple and down to earth. Easier to get immersed in.
---
There's nothing stupid. If your talking about min-max that's stuff people who never played says. That single piece of gear or potion will top the little racial. The most important thing is having a good premade group on voice chat anyway. Also engineering is not worth unless your planning on buying chinese gold.
---
Good game launches happen all the time, but what does that matter if they don't play like Vanilla?
---
If I remember correctly Naxx gear is pretty much on stat caps when you take in account buffs etc.
---
If they were to do anything I would suggest alternative raid sets for other specs and also hard elemental resistance themed raids etc.
---
I loved the Felwoord -&gt; Winterspring questing, also how that transisioned. But my all-time-favorite has to be Duskwood.
---
Because what I posted is so bad it requires a settle down post...take your snowflake ass and find a way to rid us of it.
---
&gt; BWL
---
How exactly are they gonna do that when BWL is not in phase 1?
---
Yeah that seems like a very reasonable thing to be worried about.
---
Change the 21 to 18 for EU servers
---
intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.
---
"the difficulties of combating prejudice and bigotry"
---
synonyms:
---

---
As a developer, it would be weird to take fixes straight to live. The point of beta is to test all changes, including fixes.
---
From a code perspective a change is a change. You should test all changes, period.
---
I can't tell you how many bugs I've created from fixing other stuff.
---
Programming is hard
---
Upvote = Classic, Downvote = BFA lol
---
Does not make a difference passed 20. Same dungeons, same place to level. It's just for the starting zones.
---
Well done!
---
It's just cosmetic
---
From what I can tell it’s mostly about character names and a different writing style
---
I never objected to the notion that something wouldn’t suck with layering. That’s important to the whole argument. 
---
I’m just suggesting that people are naive to think something which sounds harder to to do or game ruining wouldn’t be implemented. 
---
There’s tons of examples why this is stupid. 
---
Layering itself: was first announced as starting zones only. 
---
PvP only talents: Wad said for years they would never do this. 
---
Flying in Azeroth and flying in the last expansion. Was said to be not an option. 
---
They always find shitty ways to ruin the game and they use the ignorance of Blizzard shills to run PR for them all the way up until the point they screw shit up. 
---
No thanks. I’m not letting that happen, at least in a conversation with me.
---
dang it, I was wanting to get that gun on my dwarf hunter.  Now everyone wants it.
---
You usually have one heal priest spec into shadow weaving and refresh the debuff with mind flay every now and then. SPriest is not a buff to raid DPS.
---
Hunters: Eyes of the beast annoyance/griefing
---
Rogues: Ambushing people during questing / when fighting mobs
---
Rogues: Engineering sheep trolling
---
Dude come on comparing slavery to layering really?
---
* AFAIK the off-hand frill stat bonuses are caster oriented (i.e. no stamina or monkey) in 1.12. They may have changed at some point, but that is seemingly irrelevant since we are getting the final 1.12 versions. Note that shields and regular gear do get these affixes... just not the offhand items druids can use.  
---
* If you dig around in sixtyupgrades.com search it will give you every possible affix for (almost) all of the random affix items.
---
Also seeing a Tauren with a big mace alsways makes me smile

Do you think the people that like to RP are going to disappear?
---
Is the recipe from level 1 for Spice Bread not available in classic? I believe from TBC whenever I learnt cooking I just purchased simple flour and mild spices from the vendor and you could go to like level 50 cooking.
---
The better part is that when you lower the work week below 40, productivity doesn’t decrease either. I believe Sweden tried out a 4 Day workweek and it went swimmingly.
---
I never played retail before and the best thing is to be able to level with a friend. Wow is all chained quest and if you level 30 minutes alone you won't be able to catch up. It's a unpopular opinion but I was surprised how fun retail was. The dungeons should be longer so people talk to each other but that's the only thing that was bad about it for me. Don't imagine you will have a completely different and better experience. Wow classic is just a huge grind fest.
---
Just put everyone on the same layer at level 15. If the mobs are too packed they then have the option of instances.
---
Without PvP-RP .. no. Not rly.
---
Speed running to the quest givers to turn in and accept quests as fast as lightning before you die from the dots/blizzards/multishots/ambushes
---
2 minutes cooldown on layer switching would fix all the problems. It's not like 2 minutes is a long time in classic.

Wow is 2 years older than youtube. Some of these old videos are from google.video but once they merged alot of old videos are lost.
---
If you have never watched a full episode give it a try. "Make love not warcraft" is the name of the South Park Episode, you can stream it for free through the official page in almost every country. Even if you don't enjoy the humor, you will enjoy the wow part ;)
---
Rogues are by far the best griefers. Second comes druid. Stealth is just the best ability because they never know if you are still there.
---
Eye of the beast is fun but any good player will see tru your trick.
---
If you are not talented enough to do your job you should do something else. Not every job is for everybody. Vanilla wow was made by less people with lower budget then classic or single bfa expansion.
---
Current Blizzard is just bunch of overpaid morons collecting pay checks for doing nothing.
---
I kinda wanna run straight to the AH just to see it empty. World first auction right here
---
My concern is after layering ends and then you have the issue on multinational servers of maybe getting a 80% to 20% online faction imbalance.
---
I believe it is important to lock shards and servers to at a maximum 40 to 60 of each faction to prevent things becoming roflstomps as well as producing a good pvp environment on that server.
---
Thing is, for some people real time and /played is nearly identical ;)
---
When classic releases I better not catch any of you blits trying to chakk my wolsh!
---
Wtf is this?
---
No cake for you.
---
That's what happens when you boss fucks you by committing to a summer release.
---
Starter zones can only handle a certain amount of people before becoming overcrowded. In the beginning there was so many people killing everything that you might as well pour a stiff drink and do something else for the night..now repeat that every night for a month.
---
Go outside, get some fresh air and enjoy the world.
---
After party of Club Thrall
---
Doesn't mean you couldn't put a 2 minute cooldown or be out of combat to switch layer. It would help a lot prevent frustrating events.

Layering

I’m doing this for a week. Then back to work. I plan on getting to around level 40-50 in that time and then SLOGGING the last 10-20 levels. Figure it can do it all in a month or two tops. 
---
Though it may be slower because I’ll be rolling two characters off the bat. My solo/duo leveler and my friend group leveler to help my new player friend learn the game. Either way I’m looking forward to helping whoever I can along the way.
---
Only lvl 19 twink I ever used was a warlock. Was pretty cool. The difference between a normal character and a twink was absolutely absurd. I remember passing through Southshore with him and people attempting to gank me. Good times. 
---
I preferred to twink at 29, and a bit at 39 in TBC. Was fun.

another question, hope you wont mind :)

Does Humanoid &amp; Monster Slaying apply to pet as well ?

###[&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt; | North America | Alliance | PvE | Casual Raiding + Social](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse)    
---
#####Newly formed guild recruiting players of all skill levels interested in a casual raiding experience and having friendly people to play Classic with.
---
***
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
**&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** is a North American based casual raiding guild occupying *Server-TBD*. As a guild, we look to maintain a focus on understanding and supporting your guild mates as we all traverse Classic raiding together.&amp;nbsp;    
---
A lot of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and friends!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [website](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse) and [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;

#馃攷 What we look for in members 馃攷
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of &lt;The Winged Expanse&gt; and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.&amp;nbsp;    
---
#馃摐 Requirements and Rules 馃摐
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#馃搮 Guild Events 馃搮
---
**Pre-Launch:** For those of you that are looking to make friends before launch, be sure to stop by the Discord and say hello! We're all here to make friends and play some games at the end of the day. Wouldn't it be cool to start Classic with some buddies?&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Launch:** On launch day, be sure to show up and have fun with everyone! Make groups for leveling, introduce yourself if you haven't already, and have fun!&amp;nbsp;    
---
We'll be attempting to create the guild within a few hours after launch. Ten silver doesn't sound like a lot, but it can be when everyone is just starting out!&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Post Launch:** Immediately after the game launches, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.

#鈿旓笍 [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) 鈿旓笍
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 8:00pm - 11:00pm Central Standard Time (CST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 26th. Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This gives members three months to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing!**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 15 Melee Damage, and 15 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
Loot will be determined by a rotating loot council. Loot council members for the evening will be decided at the beginning of the raid night and will consist of high ranking members of the guild.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our website and application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;

**Our Application:** https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd
---
Asmon lives like a sow
---
**Server: EU**
---
**Guild: &lt;Hubris&gt;** 
---
**Faction: Horde**
---
**Realm: TBD PvP**
---
**Loot: Council / List**
---
**Raid Days: Mondays and Thursdays.**
---
**Raid Time: 19:00 - 23:00 (server time)**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Expectations:**
---
We expect our members to be somewhat competitive. One should always bring consumables, world buffs and a good mood to raids. It’s not mandatory participating and ranking in PvP, but we highly encourage it. 
---
**About Hubris:**
---
Everyone has their own definition of fun. Our definition is being a part of a tight-knitted community with social and good-humored individuals; who always strive to be the best but never forgets to have some fun while at it. 
---
We are looking for like-minded players who share these values. Because there’s no point spending time collecting world buffs for an MC speedrun if not everyone is on board.
---
We are mostly made up of Norwegians and Swedes who came to play together on private servers. We are a light-hearted bunch who have our fun min-maxing the game and testing the limits of WoW’s mechanics and gameplay.
---
Most Hubris members played retail vanilla way back; where most of us are now pushing past 30. With age comes responsibilities in the shape of families and careers. So as much as we want to spend our days in our underwear, farming dungeons and raids, we can’t. That’s why it’s important for us to find players in a similar state of life and mind. Individuals who still want to min-max, without wasting any of our precious little time. 
---
We want to build a guild where we can enjoy some good banter on discord, while simultaneously being a force to be reckoned with in-game. We will have our cake and eat it too!
---
**PvE:**
---
Previous experience in PvE include:
---
* Clearing MC in mostly greens on the second lockout
---
* [Killing Hakkar in mere seconds with 50k+ ignite stacks](https://youtu.be/11M--EYik_s?t=2849), ~~getting half the guild banned~~ 
---
* Clearing Naxx, both retail and private server
---
We will probably not go for any world firsts as it would take up too much time. But we do think that aiming for server or faction first is still feasible. During progression, we might add Wednesday as an extra raid day.
---
A high emphasis is put on improving boss tactics, theorycrafting and finding the optimal raid setup. When content is on farm our clear times are estimated to be:
---
* Below 30 mins MC
---
* Below 60 mins BWL
---
* Below 30 mins ZG
---
* Below 70 mins AQ40
---
To keep raiding from getting stale we usually try to spice it up with some speedruns. This is a great way to keep content exciting and fun while waiting for the next patch update.
---
**World bosses:**
---
One of the most exhilarating and rewarding aspects of vanilla is by far: Contesting World Bosses. Ginormous PvP battles, mixed with great boss fights and top-notch loot and gear.
---
The GM of Hubris was one of the organizers and a founding leader of the world boss alliance at certain private servers. Where we at one point in time had a monopoly on all the world bosses and their loot for several consecutive months.
---
There is a great competition killing the world bosses, and it’s hard to act alone as a guild. This is why we will also make strategic alliances with other guilds for a higher chance of defeating our good friends:
---
* The Demon in the Taint(ed Scar)
---
* The Four Haters Of Sleep
---
* Azur[\[Typhoon\]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18542/typhoon)
---
**PvP:**
---
More than half of our members aim to achieve rank 10 or higher. Two special nutcases, who more than likely are complete masochist, will also torture themselves by going for rank 14. Many more will go for R12 &amp; R13. 
---
We plan on becoming the strongest horde premade on the server/battlegroup, and by doing that control the brackets of the server. We do believe this is highly achievable based on our previous PvP experience and skill, and the best gear from PvE content.
---
**Additional Information:**
---
Vanilla is finally back, and we’re hardly able to keep it in our pants. We hopefully piqued your interest in some way and hope to see you join the ranks of Hubris. 
---
**All exceptional players are considered.** 
---
You don’t need to be a hardcore player to be a vital part of our guild however. Come join us as a regular (social) member, with all the benefits of being in a great guild, without any of the pressure! We will run weekly soci-alt raids, that will consistently clear all raids (progressing through phases).
---
**Thank you for reading. We’re looking forward to hearing from you.**

You may have a point there, but I generally find that dungeons while levelling don't contain enough AoE packs to be worth it.
---
That's it. From now on I will start saying Burg Schattenfang.
---
it's not the optimism, more like the naivety.
---
no one wants bad things to happen somehow some are worst than other. if the solution to huge queues and population fluctuations and ghost realms is layering with game breaking  economy, avoiding pvp, [using legion numbers](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/legion-numbers-are-being-used-in-classic-proof/204023) then how much vanilla is left?!

---
i mean i have survived all of the vanilla inconveniences and i'm still willing to do that again. i have played 2 months of bfa and quit.
---
&gt; If this makes me a shill, as I’ve been accused of in other posts, then whatever.
---
you jump to conclusions like you're trying to ridicule the fact that [astroturfing is real](https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/).
---
&gt; I feel like compromises need to be made to deal with the initial overpopulation on realms

sure but who's gonna trust these cocksuckers that are now running acti-blizz.

so tell me mr candide, don't you feel like some skepticism is needed? because i'm all for smoking my brains out and believe i'm the chosen one but at one point the effects wears off :)
---
 Hunters:
---
* kiting rares to cities
---
Wasnt that fixed / nerfed after a glorius and legendary  Kazzak pull to Stormwind ?
---
Yes, im using ElvUI in BFA, but in vanilla i did not start using any addons until i was in BWL so i will do the same when i start in classic - no addons at all.
---
So what is it?
---
I played wow since it released till wotlk in top 50 progress guilds. stoped witch cata.
---
3 weeks ago i didnt know about classic release.
---
a old friend contacted me about it and if i want to play again. i said no
---
2 weeks ago i started reading a little about classic.
---
1 week ago Nostalgie hit men the face like a sledge hammer and i cant stop thinking about it
---
1 day ago i started playing on a new private server.
---
lvl 15 now and i am sooooo hyped
---
2 weeks vacation approved and nolife will start again
---
He has been known world-wide for years.. millions of athletes know of him.

Warlock: Debuff limits, Squishy clothie, Soul shard management is a pain in the arse, pet pathing can get you into bother, to a lot of people you're a soulstone/healthstone/summon machine.
---
Hunter: Pet pathfinding as with lock and arrow/ammo management, pet management isn't exactly horrible but it's something you need to pay attention to quite a bit, you can use pretty much all weapons in the game and hunters get a bad rep for taking weapons that other classes need above you, so people get apprehensive about taking you to a raid/dungeon. Hunter has a high skill ceiling so you need to be pretty good at the game if you want to be a great Hunter. And last but not least, your dead zone. If you get CC'd in your dead zone in PVP then you're fucked.
---
Druid: If people are only wanting to follow the meta, you'll almost be guaranteed to be resto in a raiding guild. Mages/Locks can outdamage an oomkin. Warriors are better tanks than feral druids and rogues are better dps than feral druids.
---
I'll have two days of just full on no life, then a few days where I can still play a lot of hours and then I start at university again, so it will slow down after that. I'm sure it will take a few months for me.
---
Fucking can't wait, holy shit imagine the day before on discord.

**[Horde] [EU] [PVE-Server]**
---
**&lt; Wipe in progress &gt;**
---
&lt;WIP&gt; is a freshly formed guild, created by people tired of drama. Raiding should be a fun and social event, where difficulty comes from killing bosses, not from navigating a Game of Thrones - like maze of officer politics. So if you want a guild that aims for steady (but non-hardcore) raiding progress, read on!
---
We plan to raid on **Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays 21:30-00:30 EU Server Time (20:30-23:30 UK time).** Our aim is to eventually clear all the content, and we have experienced players and raid leaders to guide people towards that goal. We will be happy to teach newer and inexperienced people, all we ask is that you approach raiding and preparation with effort and dedication, and show same respect towards other people (and their time) as they do to you!
---
We expect our raiders to attend most of the raids, however will be understanding if life gets in the way - just please let us know in advance, so we can adjust and prepare.
---
Our main 40man raids will use EPGP system for loot distribution, while our alt/20man raids will be rolling for items (barring a few exceptional items).
---
Most important rule of our guild is to follow Wheaton's Law: **Dont be a dick**.
---
(It is however perfectly fine, and at times expected to call someone else a dick!).
---
We are currently **open to recruit most of the classes and roles!** - and we always accept social applications from anyone willing to join us!
---
So if you're ready to hear immature jokes about toasters, have fun doing dungeons and quests with your guildies, and work towards good raiding progress - please come check us out!
---
Feel free to message me here or on Discord (Thirteenera#8084)
---
Warlock: You're like a mage, but worse. Also you are on summoning bitch duty so get runnin boy and dont forget to farm those SS, you're gonna need em.
---
Hunter: You fall off real hard at endgame, you exist for tranq shot.
---
Feral Druid: You need to put in 20x the work to do half the dps of rogues, totally worth it right? Also hope you like Gnomeregan.
---
This seems really important to you, so I’ll just say that you’re correct buddy.
---
We are **The Remains**, a semi-hardcore guild with experience in several MMORPG's. Looking to return to one of the first MMORPGs we played. TL:DR We are looking for progress, but that essential community feeling is just as important. **Playing Horde on EU PVP server**

---

---
* A nice and friendly environment to call your home
---
* A teamspeak server to communicate with eachother

---
**What are the pillars of The Remains?**
---

These kids commenting have no clue what to do, think they will clear naxx the week it comes out, meanwhile when the raid for MC starts they just wonder why they cant enter, attunement quests what are those?
---
This is why Classic is so interesting to me. It's a great game and all. It was great back then, and it will be great now, despite whatever problems it may have at launch. But the biggest thing is that it's the first day one fresh launch of an MMO that I've been at all excited about in a literal decade. And that's huge.
---
Level with two gathering profs for cash to buy epic riding.
---
Then I’m dropping one for a main prof. I’ll eventually drop the other when I finally get another alt to 60 with two gathering prof.
---
The thing is though? It’s a journey, man! Enjoy it no matter how long it takes.
---
When I was leveling my horde warrior in WLP, I was questing 3 other horde warriors at around 52 or so.  We were ambushed by a level 60 NE hunter who murdered all of us.  She kited us all over the place, used traps, had her pet prevent us from charging, just amazing effective.  I was very impressed.
---
She then shadow melded and nailed us again when we rezed up.  Multishot crits fucking hurt.
---
The 3ed time we planed out how were going to fight her, after a long dragged out fight with her, she kill 3 of us before I killed her.  I rolled a hunter alt the next day.
---
If you want some amazing 1 vs 2/3/4s play a hunter.
---
You can easily get out of a world PvP gank with just a simple group. That's not ok and it will destroy the experience.
---
Getting ganked in the world baby just layer me up!

---
Happy Cake Day!
---
I can't wait to play classic but I have absolutely zero desire to play on release... it's just gonna be a clusterfuck. I'm trying to take some time off work the week after, that should be manageable but still packed enough!
---
&gt; mathematically
---
think you meant *practically*
---
*Blizzard(Activision) Whispers:* For only $120 you can be level 60 with a boost
---
4. You will be called out as a ninja-looter for using NEED on all loot rolls.
---
Dwarfs have a underrated skill called treasure hunting! You can find chests, stealth through mobs and get there before anyone else. That alone is why I always roll dwarfs on hunters and rogues.
---
For the Alliance side, the best times for RP for me were the House Guilds feuding, the Scarlet Crusade, and all the Northern based RP that still flourished right up until MOP.
---
After WOD it just kinda died, don’t get me wrong though there was plenty of player lore and toxic shit, but it was weirdly fun to play in this RP environment.
---
Also plenty of the outfits used were vanilla items, because it had a simpler look, which was really liked.
---
With vanilla your going to get old zones, old factions, old items back, giving more life to the Northern area, and even the South, also I do recall many people often saying, I wish we were back in classic for this reason and that.
---
So classic has its appeal to me and most likely to many others.
---
They absolutely did.
---
Classic will be the unwanted, unloved adopted Child Blizzard HAS to keep but secretly hate it.
---
You're expecting fixes from a Team that decided to destroy the Economy of the Game straight from Day 1.
---
Classic is basically Harry Potter living in a Staircase at Blizzards HQ.

Looking forward to getting to know you!
---
I really can't explain why they joined the Horde
---
I played from launch through WotLK and those thousands of hours hold some of my favorite gaming memories ever. 
---
In vanilla it took me weeks just to get to level 30. Every quest felt important, you would slowly explore every area, every blue drop felt like winning the lottery and you had to actually communicate during dungeons. 
---
I took a few years off and then briefly tried MoP but it just wasn’t the same game. I started a monk and leveling up was so quick that it wasn’t even fun. It just felt pointless. Granted, I got some exp buff for returning to the game but still. I got to level 20 in one sitting and when I started teaming up for dungeons, no one seemed to care about anything. It was so easy, no one cared about drops and most of the time no one even said a word to each other. I realized around level 55 that this wasn’t worth the time. It felt like a chore to level, gear was so easy to come by and everyone was just trying to hit the cap as soon as possible. 
---
I can only imagine what retail is like now. Not sure if they still have it but I know they were offering a free jump to max level on a new character. Seriously? To me, half the fun is watching your character grow, learn new skills, gear up, etc. 
---
So yeah, I think a lot of us feel like you do. I’m very excited to essentially start from scratch and experience WoW all over again.
---
It was not even nerfed in BC so don't expect any.

Yes, all classes had way more abilities (buttons) - especially compared to the 2 button action we have today.
---
The nice thing about being hyped for classic is that you are probably not going to be let down. Looking at you, no man's sky, Anthem, SW Battlefront 3, BFA, WOD, and the list goes on.
---
Noob question, what is this staff?

Haha so edgy. FUR THE HORDE HUEERHERUHEURHERHERER

You must've been fun to play with in both PVE and PVP.

Benediction/Anathema Madseasonshow has a quick episode on it. Never played classic when it originally was released but unique weapons like this seem really cool.

Damn dude tell me more about your in-depth knowledge of the Classic team composition and their budget. Did you deduce all this financial information out from a stress test, Sherlock?

Just fuck off.

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.

Ashenvale is awesome
---
As a new player it feels a bit discouraging... I've been playing wow for less than a year and I'm having a blast discovering the "retail wow world" but I'm also super excited for Classic. 
---
I was lucky enough to be on the first two stress tests and I had a great time grouping up with others to defeat some low level mobs and just having a laugh on chat.
---
But there are so many comments just shitting on people like me because we also enjoy retail, saying we won't last long cause we like easy things or that we will ruin things for the "true classic fans" and I'm like... I just want to have fun on both games? :s
---
A hostage situation that is 1 GM ticket from being released.
---
yeah idk man, people are weird on /r/classicwow
---
Where do you put that ? You mean tabard ?
---
Just had a quick scan of classic db, that’s pretty damn cool tbf, still trying to get familiar with everything priest. Will definitely be watching this video later when I’m home from work. Cheers pal!
---
Did you even see my comment? I said view minute 8, ffs man
---
Not really relevant for PvP but you are right.
---
Here, have some cake.
---
The most important factor in PvP is a good premade with voice chat. I always thought a single potion would top the best racial.
---
&gt;Also, look at that picture, and tell me that set of gear looks good in the first place.
---
I mean it looks really cool? lol
---
The weird thing is, 5000 gold for a serious (and you had to be serious to get scepter) raiding guild in classic wasnt that big of a deal. There were people who had a few thousand gold just themselves. Which means this wasnt a "We need gold, how can we get gold?" kind of thing, this was a "We're dickheads, how can we annoy the server?" thing.
---
They did it "for the lulz", not for the 5000 gold. 
---
Which is both hilarious and dissapointing.
---
I imagine this is because some idiot got in their ear and told them they could "mold" a community that comes from /v/.  
---
I wouldn't name bald names though.
---
F R E S H
---
Leveling up with a friend. Because it's mostly chain quest in classic 30 minutes and you won't be able to play together.
---
Top 10 title click bait formats that make me want to blow my fucking brains out
---
Unfortunately there won't be any mobs Haha
---
Sounds like something I respect deeply. Its a world where the players write the story. The players have real impact and the players decide.
---
The servers could gank the shit out of them, blacklist them forever or jusy pay up.
---
To have a communitie driven game you have to take the good with the bad, no ToS is broken and I love it.
---
Respect, here have some cake.
---
Yes it is.
---
I dont think you understand what click bait is? The title states exactly what the article is, nothing more and nothing less.
---
OP, I agree. Rarely have I started with everyone else in an MMO. I think SWTOR was the only one I started on day 1. Sadly, that didn't work out well ;(.
---
Welcome to reddit...
---
You can definitely level with a friend in classic. Just have to do a bit more grinding in the end.
---
every raid shoukd have a balance druid!
---
What? No, not for their damage. As a mascot.
---
Because it will last 3+ months. Probably more than 4 months. When you have 6 Phases, and a minimum 2 years of content...well, that is 4 months/phase.
---
However, the content of the Phases is also important. Phase 1 will be longer than 4 months, because 2 raids and leveling. Phase 2 be shorter than 4 months. Phase 3 longer, because 3 raids and BWL being much harder than MC. 
---
It is a no brainer that phase 1 will be the longest phase, minimum 4 months.
---
I know on the red dead redemption subreddit they defined a low effor meme as "If you took away the meme-text overlay (or the badly shopped cowboy hat), would the picture still have anything to do with the game? If no, removed for low effort."
---
Just a suggestion, but if you define what you guys consider low-effort then it removes the subjectivity of the judgment, and people won't have any grounds to get all pissy with you.
---
Name checks out. ;)
---
Please report them, last I checked with the others we were on the same page of removing then except in unique circumstances.
---
I'll be enlisted and either during basic training or transfered and during "freshman week" (so to speak) during launch....
---
RIP
---
It's not entirely unwarranted at this point.
---
Devilsaur legs and hands
---
I applaud your effort to layout a case, which is more than just about anyone else has done.
---
Tell you what, let’s check back at the end of phase one. If you’re right and they renege, then I’ll gladly eat my words and chalk it up to naïveté.
---
I don’t want to click the article, I want to get all the information in the reddit post itself.
---
Yeah, but one of the reasons they added thanks was to stop account sharing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
No of course nobody did but... having an entire class working almost flawlessly on private servers but then being full of bugs on the "real thing" is kind of disappointing.
---
I only hope we can expect Ooga Gang representation on every server when classic goes live
---
What evidence?  There are spots like this in vanilla.  No need to resort to name calling and whatnot.  Makes you look like you don't know what you're talking about.
---
At the end of the day, If people are not ok with how things are moderated here they are welcome to go make their own subreddit moderated in the way they want.
---
What a lot of people fail to understand is that Moderating generally isn't fun and you very rarely get any thanks from the majority of people. Rather you get abuse for a decision that is correct based upon the rules.
---
These people give their time to us for free to maintain the space that we converse in and go to a lot of effort to do it. How many of the individual's complaining have had such responsibility ?
---
The subreddit would be a nicer place if people weren't the way they are and weren't generally chasing internet points by wanting their own threads upvoted.
---
If people didn't downvote things they didn't like rather use downvoting as intended for downvoting content which isn't fitting to the subreddit aka stuff not classic wow related etc.
---
As such I will say thank you to the staff team here that puts their time forward to manage here and the discord and how they have helped bring the community together which has helped things such as Vanilla Friends Thrive as well as many communities some of us run.
---
You dropped this \

What my friends and I would usually do (because we weren’t going to always be on at the same time, but played roughly the same amount of time) was plan on doing the quests in certain zones together. Like “yo, we’re ready for desolace, but don’t start the quests there yet we’ll do them tomorrow!”
---
Sadly I wasn't able to get release week off and will be doing a 60 hour work week that week...... but I got the week after off so that will have to be catch up.
---
There are plenty of other places to post your "art", keep this sub clean.
---
And the population has been decreased, alot of people got bored of playing the beta. Who knows.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Exactly how would a GM intervene here?
---
Doesnt work against classes that arent warriors.
---
Oh I see, you're using the "free dictionary" that's flipped the definition of bigotry form it's normal definition from "intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself." to prejudice.
---
For me it will depend on the gold I save and how quickly it looks like P2 will take to come around. If I got lucky and saved a substantial amount, I may just get the 100% in P1 and get the class mount in P2.  I will be leveling slow, so it may not be a difficult decision.
---
BWL isn't in phase 1.
---
Fair enough, still not clickbait though :-)
---
Not unless you always are together all the time. Or do some fishing while you wait. I'm sorry but you go to the bathroom and your behind in a quest line.

''I lost my wife on our honeymoon just outside of Nesingwary's Expedition in Stranglethorn Vale during the summer of 2019.... those brutes came out of nowhere and jumped my wife all at the same time. We were warned about going on a honeymoon to such a jungle but my wife insisted she wanted to see the Elder Mistvale Gorilla with her own blue eyes''
---
''Our son is allmost (lvl) 15 now and dreams about travelling to Stranglethorn himself to avenge his mother. That jungle brings nothing but horror to everyone that enters it. I prefer the walls of stormwind''
---
I would agree and they shouldn't wait for launch to do all the fixes.  I just "with no knowledge at all" expected they would do multiple patches with multiple fixes.  That being said with it having been over a month(?) I would have expected them to have released or be near releasing the first wave (would also probably cut down on people continuing to report the same bug that has already been fixed/in-progress).  With retail having an update soon not sure if that would further delay bug fixing on beta (not sure if the personnel are completely separate or are rotated around).  If so that would delay the 1st patch fix potentially even longer which is getting a bit too close to release for comfort.
---
Instead, will be 1,000 levels 1s in every starting zone on every server all trying to kill 1 wolf. Group up and it will still take an hour to do 1 quest
---
5. You really need all those items somehow

**&lt;Hellion&gt; [EU][H][PVP] Hardcore light!**
---
📜 **Introduction**
---
Hellion is a guild for people that want to be able to mix serious raiding with real life obligations. It's a guild for those of us that want to clear all content at a steady pace, but in a sensible and time efficient way. 
---
We are now looking for more players of high standard that know their class and play it well, prepares for raids in terms of consumables, pre raid bis gear, enchants and strategy. The goal is to build a tight community of highly skilled and like minded players.
---
It's a big plus if you have experience from raiding in vanilla, but it's not a requirement.
---
⚔ **What we expect from you**
---
= You can level to 60 somewhat fast (4 weeks is the absolute deadline) and commit to 3 raids a week, 3 hours per raid. Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00. 
---
= You know your class and play it well.
---
= You can think and act in stressfull situations. 
---
= You show up prepared to every raid. Strategy, consumables, pre raid bis gear and enchants.
---
= Willingness to build a positive reputation for the guild. You represent all of us when you wear the &lt;Hellion&gt; name. Act accordingly.
---
= You are a team orientated player, what's best for the team has priority over you. We gear the raid to progress. Be cool with a transparent loot council and realize that you will get your stuff faster if we kill stuff faster.
---
💝 **We offer**
---
= Mature and experienced vanilla guild and raid management.
---
= An opportunity to clear all the raids in Classic without insane commitment requirements.
---
= Laid back atmosphere.
---
= New friendships that will hopefully last a lifetime!
---
☠ **Raid schedule**
---
Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00.

---
You were 60 and geared. People in classic will not.
---
We might just steal that wording.
---
Be prepared to do a lot of fishing.
---
haha yeah, gods that truly walk among us
---
This video was made by an old friend who came as a tourist for our raid! We had Ragnaros on farm at that time, so we used to bring the casual guildies in our runs to get some free loot.
---
That video was made at 2005/-6’s Tarren Mill and the guild was Elite Order! If some of you were into Deathwing or Tarren Mill servers you could PM as we reform the server community again.
---
Ragnaros took less than 10 mins at that time, after his nerfs. Twenty well geared members can carry another 20 green/blue geared players into this tier 1 raid. So if some of you can only play as casuals don’t sweat it too much. Just be social, make friends and get into a guild. Your family will help you out :)
---
Thanks for watching, take care.
---
Fair point :P it does take a lot of effort to properly quest together with friend all the way :-)
---
While I don't think they'll do it, retail DOES have the system in place for this kind of thing already where there are world bosses that exist on every shard but the save for them are personal. All they'd have to do is turn it on, it's in the client that classic is ported on.
---
At 40 farming the $ for a mount doesn't take that long.
---
So you suggest that he should play as trap?
---
Any number of ways including resetting the quest to be available again.
---
If you want to join a hardcore guild. Find one first, and than join whatever they are joining.
---
In the LFG monday treat there are alot of guilds advertising , try find a guild that fits you there.
---
Also have some cake.
---
And I'm still no closer to figuring out the race/class I want to play 😭
---
You can innervate non-Mana users as well and it's actually even more fun to see their reaction. Doing this to the main tank in raids while they talk about using your cooldowns correctly is also good.
---
Know your memes guys: [Greeting Traveller](https://youtu.be/R_FQU4KzN7A)
---
When I compiled stats from this website for stress test and beta, there were a total of around 12,500 characters recorded at all levels. Only right around 10% of those were leveled up to 40. Assuming most folks have not created an excessive number of alts in the beta, the estimates that around 10k have beta access seem accurate.
---
I think one of the reasons Blizzard limited beta access so tightly for the first couple of months was that they anticipated that many beta testers would not make it to higher levels and would try the game for a bit and then set it aside, either not wanting to put in the effort on characters that will be wiped, or not wanting to spoil the game or burn themselves out before launch. So they probably anticipated that if broad beta access were extended early on, large numbers would try it for a bit, get to 20 or 30, and then leave, never to return.
---
However, they may want large crowds to surge in particularly in the later phases of testing to gauge the likely launch population and to better test their final layer tuning and server provisioning estimates. So if that's the case, assuming they want bigger crowds later in testing, it makes some sense that they would not want them to arrive until very late in the beta period when they're more likely to stay interested for the final week or two.
---
If that's their thinking, then I'd expect in late July or early August, after another open access stress test, they'll open up the beta to all active subs for the final couple of weeks of testing before early access begins, to pull in a fresh crowd of testers and build some renewed hype leading up to launch. I don't expect them to allow any very wide access to beta before the last couple weeks though, since they know burnout will set in quick and the hype bubble would pop too soon if it opens too early.
---
My last leveling though STV says differently.  I beat a groups of 1 v 2s, a few 1 v 3s at about the same level, and one 1 v 5 when I was about 45 or so, and 5 34s attacked me while I was helping a warrior with his WW Axe quest.  Fought every class.
---
Fucking casual.
---
In the upcoming days to classic I started a new character on vanilla got to 60 in 3 days and got bored and didn't play again 
---
I will do the same with classic but I will enjoy it more
---
Do you need Beta/Stresstest invite to create your characters or can you just download the client 2 weeks prior and create it, cause I'd really love to get my old name back.
---
It’s a well known meme [Greetings Traveller](https://youtu.be/R_FQU4KzN7A)
---
You realize that this is the single most important soundeffect for the class? The one you will hear millions of time as a Hunter?
---
Actually, dumbass, today, you can say thousands of things that can get you banned without actually being reasonable.
---
I want to be able to call people stupid, snowflakes, idiots, retards, without being banned, because those words are harsh...but not harsh enough for a ban. The N word, yes should be banable. But "idiot" should NOT. Add me to your ignore list if I call you an idiot.
---
If I say in chat, during a political discussion : "The vast majority of terrorists are Muslim" I should NEVER be banned. But with snowflakes today, and right-click report...I would be banned.
---
Why should I be banned for saying the TRUTH? Over 99,8% of terror attacks ARE done by Muslims.
---
Right-click reporting in Classic (where most player will be above a certain age and most will be conservatives and right wing) would have been a stupid feature.
---
Alliance has gnomes. That means you should roll horde so you can kill gnomes
---
I can’t wait to make a soundboard for raids/arena
---
I know one streamer who went back to playing a private server because there wasn't anyone on the beta.
---
What? Did you even read the post, or even understand how opening the gates work? 
---
The quest is available to anyone, anyone could go through the quest to obtain the scepter and open the gates. The guy who did it on their server just refused to do it, he isn’t breaking any rules at all.
---
Quest doesnt need to be reset. Its not a "one time per server thing". Its more like "Its a super long, hard quest that unlocks content for everyone after at least 1 person finishes it". The problem was (i guess) that only 1 guild on that server had the power to finish that quest (it involved a lot of endgame raiding etc).
---
You cannot force a guild to complete a quest. They can just say "Oh we're waiting until our players come back from holiday, the 5000 gold was a joke" and thats it.
---
So you do it on demand? It's not automatic?
---
I can see how that would be troublesome if (or rather, when) people abused it.
---
Its missing the ranged shots not getting blocked bug.
---
It's almost as if we have perfected the way the game was supposed to be played over all these years of min/maxing... and we still love it.  I'll see you all in BRM.
---
Does not make any difference. Passed 20 it's pretty much the same zones, quest and dungeons. There's all kind of guilds. Local people, age groups, new players, casual, harcore. You can find one right now. Aim at a guild that have 200+ person on discord. Start making friends it's important even low level. Getting the whirlwind axe you need the guild effort at 30.  Exchange of bags. Professions are all wasted, you craft the same thing over and over. Guildies will be happy to craft, upgrade and enchant you gear for free.
---
&lt;Celestial Born&gt; [NA - PvE Server - A] is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
About Us:
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail. We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured. To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization. We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
Purpose:
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience. Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS. In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended. In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks. Please refer to the Charter at celestialborn.com for the napkin math behind this. We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience. Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule. With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
Loot:
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
Recruitment:
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as a non-core member. Such positions remain selective, are held to all of our member expectations, and aren’t necessarily precluded from raiding. If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at celestialborn.com and read over the Charter. The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading. May you find your perfect guild!
---
"World of Warcraft has been out since 2004, and was in various stages of development before that. And amazingly, it was developed with a team around fifty people and shipped with about sixty."
---
Oh 40 isn't a problem, I was referring to the level 60 mount, the 100% one. Sorry for any confusion
---
This would be the one addition I will miss about the current format, say what you will about retail but I still love a sweaty 3s match any day. 
---
I hope we see more duelling comps like the one held in the beta, that would be the closest thing we’ve got to it
---
ME TOO!!!
---
Very well said. 
---
I always thought how bad it is that nowadays everyone knows everything. The best spots, the best quest routes etc. 
---
And that this will have a negative impact since it won’t be special to have those things anymore (since YouTube is full of tutorial &amp; hint videos.) but now that I think of it...
---
At least we will all do the same. Imagine back then when in general not so many people knew about the best grinding spots etc. 
---
Now that basically everyone has access to this information, there might be awesome world PvP around those spots.
---
I definitely understand where you're coming from, I wish we knew a bit more about the timeframe of the phases!
---
Save 5 earth root when leveling early on to put towards your cure poison quest. 
---
When you are doing your bear form quest you will be in a cave fighting a moonkin. You might go oom and die especially if you are freshly Lv10 and dont get lucky with hits and crits with your spells and staff. It is actually a neat little trick to clear the area and then pull so you are just outside of the cave so you have the option of chain rooting and getting some space until your mana comes back or let a moonfire tick - you can apply this to any melee mob, it is just a patience exercise due to the five second rule :)
---
Also, there are two flight paths in Moonglade. The one in town is for druids only and is FREE. The other one outside of town costs money. 
---
If you have a harder fight you can try regrowth and rejuvenate before pulling and shifting. This will let the HoT components tick, not sure if the ticks generate threat though.
---
If you are in bear form and dying you have to shift out to heal or pop a pot. This means you are in a more vulnerable state. A little trick you can use, especially when soloing, is to pull mobs to the edge of a ledge. When you are dying, jump down. This gives you time to throw off an uninterrupted cast and shift back. When you shift back, fight towards the top of the ledge again and repeat. You can do this in SM cathedral by making large pulls at Lv60 and running to the top of the small waterfall. You can also apply this technique to ZF stairs if you are fast enough to avoid evade bugs.
---
Teleport moonglade is an access point to a fishable zone at higher skill levels meaning your fishing could be maxed out well before you reach the 50+ questing zones.
---
Save a very low rank moonfire for annoying shaman totems, and chuck on some hots and buffs so a mage doesnt spell steal an innervate on their first try.
---
Hay m8 - the Layering will not take away from your experience back then. It will be just like that.
---
One Layer will be Holding pretty much the exact Player numbers of one Server back then. Just that you have a couple Servers on one Server pretty much ;)
---
The only downside may be that you won't recognize the People you have met at Level 5 because at Level 10 you might be in different layers. Besides that you can still compete for 1 spawn Point with 4 other People ;)
---
Bah, a night of farming in Azshara solves that also.
---
I think the majority of WoW roleplayers will be staying on retail for roleplay for a whole host of reasons, and therefore the Classic RP community will be a fair bit smaller. However, there are certain roleplay concepts that only really work in vanilla's time-setting, like roleplaying a Scarlet Crusade guild that doesn't just get tossed out of Stormwind for example.
---

Well, when you all going all "Fun mode" it feels that some of this testing the game has been disconnected, when i asked in public channel in IF when i saw at least 40 people there for an duel to test something i had to ask in Guild chat instead for help after half an hour without any response, i tried both yell and general chat in IF. No response at all.
---
Tell me about it!  
---
That's the toughest thing this time around.  Back in highschool and university I could sure put in a lot of hours.  Now I work 7-630/7 mon-fri, have a wife and other obligations.  Going to be very hard to juggle things this time around, hopefully I can find a "old people" raiding group too.
---
Indeed
---
1 person escapes a gank and it's the end of the world!!!  the sky is falling!!!
---
Still no cake for you, you can't handle my cake!
---
Yes thats a good point to find a big guild for the start
---
All the reasons you listed about not liking it
---
fine, loser pays for the drinks. or maybe makes a post here saying that he was wrong. 
---
damn, those accents are pretty dope!
---
Crunch time is never okay.
---
But it shouldn't be the responsibility of the consumer to consider crunch time when buying a product. My responsibility is to make sure the product I'm buying is worth the money and time I put into it. The company has the responsibility of making sure their product is good enough (for people to buy them) and making sure their labourforce has proper conditions to produce said product. 
---
Now as you say, crunch time often leads to a worse product and this is where the interests of the consumer and the company converge.
---
Thanks for sharing! Tier 1 and quel ;)

#&lt; Light's Hope Survivors &gt; ll Horde – NA – PvP ll Loot Council for BiS + DKP
---
🕗 **Raid Times:** Tues &amp; Thurs 8–11 EST, Optional Monday for progression
---
**About Us:** Our goal is to be competitive in raiding as well as battleground and world pvp. To foster healthy competition, players that go the extra mile with regards to performance get rewarded with BiS items via Loot Council Lists, DKP for other items. 
---
We tuned our methods on pservers and bring that experience to the table for Classic's release. We plan on being active in wPvP and with world bosses, and expect to join Horde coalitions and partner with like-minded guilds on our server to that end, as well as forming premades for BG in the latter phases. We strive for success in PvE as well as PvP, but having a good time is of equal priority. Lok'tar Ogar, For the Horde
---
**Our Experience:** Our core played together on a pserver as a second raid group for our parent guild before F R E S H happened and the war of attrition became too much. As a guild we went 8/9 AQ, Separately, We have 15/15 Naxx experience.
---
**Expectations:** Members must be ready to excel in a competitive environment. This means they will bring all required consumables and world buffs, and perform competently each raid. New classic players are welcome as long as they are willing and able to learn at a reasonable pace. We strongly encourage PVP participation, but it is not required. 
---
Exceptional players are always considered Right now we are looking for:

What addons do you recommend?
---
Cheers m8 - Inofficial is not a actual word? :D
---
Probably a lot of Germans that make mistakes here because in German it is inoffiziell ;)
---
The umlaut and the tilde? iPhone does that for me automatically.
---
I believe even Naxx will be cleared fast by casual guilds. Not blindingly fast but our progression will not be anything like the previous one..
---
Everyones acting like raiding was a hard skill check - it wasn’t really. Mostly simple mechanics (like living bomb) that wiped raids.. because people had shit PCs.
---
I beg to differ. If you play with a guild and do a run every week, no matter what drops someone will get an upgrade becuase if nobody wants their loot they can trade you. In the meantime there are plenty of ways to get garaunteed gear - warfront quests, weekly chests, and benthic gear which releases tomorrow. And anyway I've never seen borderlands fans complaining about loot drops.
---
It's a real MMO.
---
Easy for me as paladin mount is horrid so I won't bother with the level 60 one, I'll just get a normal mount.
---
lol, yeah.  Best I got was lvl 8.  It was nice to get that refresher.
---
Every time you launched the game &lt;3
---
True. I am talking about launch month tho, so before any serious amount of people start raiding.
---
It's automatic for some, but it can be on-demand by inviting someone to another layer.
---
But the troublesome part is being able to swap basically on demand to another layer, thus destroying the whole point of classic, which is the mindset 1 world. None of the phasing stuff where people disappear randomly from the world, if you see someone in a zone, they are going to remain there until they decide to leave.
---
You do you bruh 🤣👌
---
From what I can gather we will not have to wait until phase 2 for our class mounts.
---
I will not be buying a normal mount. I will get my almost free level 40 mount and do my quest for my level 60 mount.
---
At the current time we don't really have clarity - even if there isn't RP-PvP I plan to support RP and grow it on the PvP server that my community will then be forced to roll on.
---
Now I hope we do see a RP-PvP server because they are great and stable servers but like any server its about the community that rolls on it to support and grow the server as well as moderate and manage it.
---
No warlocks? What? Ah seems like I remembered this wrong. I knew about druids
---
Bug
---
No shit. We obv meant after the phase releases.
---
Of course Borderlands players like Borderlands loot. I’m saying its far from the RPG part it used to be.. some people like it, feels like a treadmill to me.
---
Not true
---
Good idea.
---
Gnome ftw
---
Hahaha nice one
---
Eh, blacksmithing can be quite grim. But all gathering professions and leatherworking are fantastic to level with. 
---
If you're a caster - let's hope you know an enchanter, because wands are going to be in massive demand and will be manipulated on the auction house.
---
It does reset the swing timer.   
---
Only place where I know it didn't was on Nostalrius but even private servers fixed it eventually.
---
Regarding Bug 29 - Every autoshot has a 0.5 second windup time. You can tell there is none for the autoshot after aimed... benefits us for once. I want them to fix this one dead last x)
---
is this a serious post?
---
&gt; I've decided to play a Warlock even though I played a Paladin in vanilla 
---
I'm in the exact same boat bro !!! Also very much hyped by Classic. Looking so forward to play it. More casually, because life has become more important than in the past, but still very happy !!
---
That would explain it! Nah inofficial isn't a word for us :) 
---
It's generally un*, so unfavourable unofficial undetermined undesirable etc. But English is borked so indecisive etc still confuse things lol.
---
I want to reach Hot so i needs your strongest cake!
---
Well we're doing things like running mara and ZF as well as farming WPL and EPL. We're finding bugs no one would be finding otherwise while we're having fun. And believe me we're finding a fuckton of them. 
---
Blizzard needs us to do everything to find everything. 
---
&gt; when i asked in public channel in IF when i saw at least 40 people  
---
...there were 40 people in IF?
---
So /u/Revuledroh is what we druids amongst ourselves calls a questing impaired individual, it is what can happen when you snack on to many dreamfoils and dont use the buddy system. While he is a full druid by right his wise council should perhaps be taken lightly. This issue is usually solved once a secret meeting place in the form of a class channel is established but for now you'll have to excuse him.
---
If you innervate a non-mana user you cant innervate the mana user that is low on mana you might run into later. 
---
The melee character ofc gets a thorn by all proper druid ethics. 
---
In raids innervate is used to trade for power infusions or to artificially inflate the feral druids dps.
---
My bad, misunderstood your comment (mixed up and thought you said Classic was made by less people than Vanilla).
---
I think a big part was because the game was the Casual MMO of the market. It had built up a strong universe beforehand which attracted the fans of warcraft and offering what was a casual MMO was a big attractor for a large number of mmo players back in the day.
---
This then passed through the media as well as through limited word of mouth.
---
WoW got where it was because of the circumstances around it. In all sense they got incredibly lucky with the world becoming more open to people talking about gaming over the years etc as well as the game being far more inviting than things like DAOC.
---
Nothing else to live for
---
For me, it’s about the community. You have to actually talk to people, to do stuff in the game instead of the queue in get it done without saying hello mentality. 
---
I might be biased ofc as I found my wife in-game :)
---
Yeah dur, point is they are way less broken, or atleast seem less broken atm.
---
Actually loot drops in old wow were equally as bad if not worse due to the lack of personal loot. RPG games typically have random loot drops and require you to grind for high power items. You're right though. Personal loot is far from the old system where one player could easily snatch everything and ruin the raid for everyone. Titanforging exists too and that's a system which I agree should be done away with. However, I'd take personal loot and garaunteed weekly items any day over what wow used to be like. It should also be noted that a lot less items would drop per raid.
---
Why even mention it then? Getting BWL down fast when people are already geared isn't that impressive.
---
Yup, reading that post I am just shaking my head.  My greens and SM blues do fine in the level 40 meta, not dominating like with the 58 templates, but fine.  
---
Doing all of that stuff to be a little better at 40?  Hilarious.  Doing all of that and then having the population fall off by &gt;50%, huelarious.
---
Although killing Grey's gives a huge honour penalty so there's that to discourage people at least.
---
What about EU servers complaint? There is almost no threads left on this subject. All the popular ones were shutdown really fast for no apparent reason.
---
In game cutscenes?
---
will of the forsaken and the orc racial are pretty good
---
he was asking about human so i was only considering alliance races
---
gnome is considered the best caster alli race but its a very small difference
---
Install the Blizzard client then launch Retail WoW (no need to even install, you can stream it). You can play for free up to level 20 and if it's playable on your laptop, Classic will be as well.
---
I remember wanting to main a troll priest based off the PCGamer articles I read, then when I got to the character creation... I went all in on an Orc Shaman and never looked back.
---
Though I do recall not knowing what the hell I was doing and my fiancé at the time getting extremely angry for not helping her with Thanksgiving dinner.... or wanting to take a break. I made it to 15 by the end of the weekend though!
---
That won’t happen lol
---
No, i think they will stay in BFA, with their pandarens and demon hunters.
---
I am actually very interested in an MMO experience that stays static. Go at my own pace, not worrying about a new expac rendering my progress obsolete and possibly adding or changing content in a way I dislike.
---
I enjoy the feeling of getting levels or gearing up moreso if it's more time consuming and "difficult". It just feels more rewarding. 
---
The familiarity of it will be a big draw because it's a world and characters I am already aquatinted to. It'll be like visiting an old friend.
---
Yup, not sure if you disagree or havent played retail for so long that you are not aware. Anyway, here goes. The main quest lines since WoD are usually concluded with some sort of in-game cutscene with prominent lore characters. Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4O8e7YZQus
---
&gt;No one has figured out a good solution to crunch time in software yet (in my experience). 
---
Delay release dates so the crunch is less intense/not required? It’s really not that difficult.
---
So it's essentially what I know as server hoping from back in WotLK. I don't like that being a thing in Vanilla to be honest. As you said, it doesn't match the idea of segregated servers.
---
Then it's not a problem anyway because its open to do. Either way no hostage situation.
---
https://discord.gg/Z7kWAMF 
---
Wow Classic LFG discord
---
Since WoD you sure?
---
Getting tp 60, and getting 1k gold in 2 months ain't a joke.... Even if you could, it just seems crazy wasteful.
---
I wasn't sure if you were trolling at the start, you are basically an echo chamber parrot at the start. Bawk bawk.
---
Some people prefer the alliance zones and cities, music, lore. I'm very on the fence to my preferred faction having played both about 50/50 since vanilla. I'll be going alliance though once classic is release because that's the first faction I rolled and it's got real nostalgia value.
---
As for why "being alliance means they don't know how to fight" just...lol man.
---
You do make a few valid points though so it isn't all a troll.
---
9/10 of the beta people left the game. I'm afraid this could be the same case at launch.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
Hi talking about launch month tho, so before any serious amount of people start raiding., I'm dad.
---
He‘s a Male Night elf. He wants his own ass to get slapped.
---
Well the first one was in Wrath but WoD was when it was really integrated as part of the main questing experience. Every expac since TBC has had some sort of high-fidelity ingame cutscene.
---
Posts a #metoo on this subreddit
---
Fuck you.
---
The streamers on the beta have way too many followers and fans to not have gotten their twitch donators invites when they visited the HQ. 
---
That was very likely part of the deal.  We market your game you make sure our fans have invites.  
---
Nothing else really makes sense.  The people with 2004 accounts are in their 30’s and 40’s and don’t watch streaming, and surely don’t donate cash to streamers.  
---
So a few streamers have quit or switched back to BFA, and the population reflected it.
---
And is that a good thing?
---
Some DPS is always better than no DPS, but by comparison Warlocks are very close to the bottom of the list of main DPS spec choices.

**&lt;Zz&gt; | Alliance | NA - PVP |  6pm - 10 pm PST Sunday - Thursday (as needed) | Hardcore PVE and PVP Guild**
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:** Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and will look to form a 2nd raid before the end of the first month in preparation for phase 2. Once phase 2 begins we will be pushing to get as many people to Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**What we are looking for:** We are looking for players who want to play Classic with a hardcore mentality, we will be pushing to be one of the best PVE guilds in the world as well as pushing to be one of most feared PVP guilds in our battlegroup. **We are also currently recruiting players who want to focus on professions (Herbalism, Mining, etc.).** 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM me with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
That’s what they made laptops for.
---
And if everyone knows about "the best grinding spot", it's not the best grinding spot anymore. People are treating Classic like it's a solved game. The game's mechanics might be solved, but how people use those mechanics will constantly change. [It reminds me of Ice Climbers in SSBM.]
---
Look at the post i replied to.. he seemed to be sure it wasnt an easy feat..
---
The lack of pandas, demon hunters, worgen, and especially blood elves are the main reason I'm going to RP on classic rather than retail. As another user pointed out, it's a lot more down to earth.
---
Not sure if trolling lol. Anyway, its pretty great yea. No matter how abysmal the progression and various other aspects of retail is, these does a fantastic job at concluding epic quest lines. 
---
its not huge and hardly something that can save modern wow but its cool nonetheless.
---
you are correct.  
---
Your question is ?
---
Summit1G is now only playing BFA after being lured back into the game by the Classic beta.
---
I posted a thread of pictures of an old german vanilla guide book that i found. Cool pages with correct stats of things and such.. was deleted 2hr in for no real reason. 
---
Hate to say it but mods on this sub are gay.
---
Ah 2004, I remember those days. I was a Refresh bot in FFXI. Good times with kitty cat girls.
---
Oh WoW? I didn't start playing until that South Park  episode came out, so I guess that was 2006. I remember getting to 60 thinking I'd get to raid and kill that cool Ragnaros guy, but everyone was waiting for TBC.
---
Well to me its lazy storytelling and forcing players to watch cutscenes
---
I understand you can't see that crap anymore... But comparing WoW to WoW is like comparing Fifa to Fifa or COD to COD...
---
It will always happen and it's fine like that.
---
Why wouldn't you compare WoW to WoW? I know they are quite different but just because they are different doesn't mean it invalidates them to be compared, right?
---
 no it didnt lol.
---
Before I go into this, I'd like to qualify my comment by saying I am a working software developer in the UK.
---
Throwing more people at a project does not mean it will go faster or bugs will be closed off sooner, in fact it can often mean the opposite. They are likely working with spaghetti code in some places, trying to unpick new functionality from old. Throwing 4 engineers/developers at a ticket/bug doesn't mean it gets fixed 4 times quicker, because that is the nature of software development, pair programming can sometimes speed things up, but that is only really true when coding new functionality, not fixing bugs or working on existing legacy code.
---
Me and my colleagues define a project manager as "Someone who thinks 9 women can deliver a baby in 1 month", your comment seems to share that attitude because it is often something assumed by lots of people who do not have any actual industry experience.
---
The part of your comment that annoys me most though is that "devs need to be working round the clock figuring it out" - fuck no, this is terrible. I wouldn't want someone building my house if they were exhausted from "working round the clock", because what they build would be dog shit. The same goes for developers. Tired me writes bad code, then well rested me has to come in behind tired me and fix / refactor what I've written when I was tired. Outside of this, the developers working on this are real people with families, children, etc. Not some super human who spends all his time sat at his desk hammering out code. There is some reasonable expectation that at the end of a sprint you may have to stay late or work over a weekend, but that will only be a couple of days maybe, but certainly never round the clock to get stuff finished, because that not healthy.
---
It required to complete pretty much all of the end-game raiding content, gather an incredible amount of materials and kill hard open world bosses. Only top tier raiding guilds were able to do this - all for a single person. The entire guild had to work to help a single member get the quest done. And you could only do it for one person at a time as well. 
---
So a guild doing this, and then refusing to use the quest to unlock content meant that unless you had another top tier guild on your server, you had zero chance of opening the gates.
---
Bloodlust in raids was pretty fun. It has no place in vanilla but it definitely made TBC raiding more fun.
---

Hardcore guilds require way more time commitment than most people actually sit down to realize.
---
That said you could pick based on aesthetic preference, or just apply to guilds and if you get accepted just roll their faction.
---
Uhm, lazy? It probably takes 10 times as long to make that cutscene as it would to have it play out in game. You hated the Wrathgate cinematic as well?

Crunch time is coming and it's going to be really bad. Layering doesn't function properly and has very poor community perception. Hunters and to a lesser degree warlocks have completely broken pet functionality. Hunters core toolkit is bugged and needs substantial work. 
---
People think 2 months is a lot of time but it's really not especially when there's a lot of meaty bugs.
---
I feel bad for the Devs, this beta is months too late. They were deceptive to the consumer and made it sound like the game was a carbon copy of vanilla and it couldn't be further from the truth. They have a massive workload for the next 5+ months.
---
Stoneform is better. Changes your match ups against classes that are strong against you. It's just hands down best in slot for PvP.
---
Bring back mainstream 1337speak
---
never played classic, can you lock your xp?
---
Hey, as long as they stream gank these streaming jackholes, I'm all for them!! Kill A$$mondgold and his like!
---
I might be in the minority but i liked achievements. (Not the whole ”Link achieve” craze but just earning the Achievement for stuff was something i liked)
---
Just checked on can you run it website. Says I can run World Of Warcraft Vanilla, but not BFA (Says my card does not meet requirements) ill install trial and see what happens
---
This right here. How my vanilla relevant posts get deleted but bullshit reposts stay ?
---
I wanted to roll an Orc, until the pick screen where I noticed the Tauren warrior. Plate look badass on those guys :D
---
That’s probably true.
---
But I’m sure at least everyone playing retail will try it plus a bunch of people will come back for it.
---
So if 5-7mil people try it you would have 500-700k actively  playing which is plenty.
---
Trying to stay connected with my dial up on my undead rogue 😂🤣
---
After playing beta for a while it is significantly more rewarding leveling, completing a quest, learning a new ability and getting a new useful piece of gear.     
---
   
---
And it’s nice that the gear looks like shit until very late in the game. It’s nice that traveling is a slog, or that you have to find your own groups. It makes the world feel gigantic, your decisions matter more and it’s much more social. 
---
It’s not perfect, and there are things I miss from later expansions, but it is more enjoyable in many ways.
---
Mages just iceblock in response.. And so on
---
K then don't play classic you ungrateful buffoon
---
https://youtu.be/5uA1Hi9AKZo
---
I wouldn't listen to most of this advice. Even though this is a long write up much of this is wrong. 
---
Auto attacks will indeed reset on any cast. There was a defect on many private servers where it did not
---
Shocks will be your primary damage. If you don't use them your kill speed or dungeon contributions will be low. That is why you need Mana and Regen. 
---
Whole point of this is that you can also flex into a healing position without having to respec.
---
I like the cinematics i dont like that they are main story points
---
Happy to help and you too :)
---
not really.  you level with gathering and if your guild needs a crafter or you get a rare recipe, level up crafting at 60.  crafting professions are never good to level with.  as for wands, only priests really rely on them, and you can buy the few you might need on the AH, although i think there is a good item progression that doesn't need them at all.  certainly not worth leveling enchanting just for that.
---
I played on a private server. No beta for me.
---
I think achievements could work but it would have to have far fewer imo. Like feats of str for server firsts, high ranked pvp etc. Achievements should be something to strive towards but not be as prominent as it is today. 
---
Either way, there are considerable upsides to achievements for sure.
---
The best pserver group launched a fresh on Saturday, that's why.
---
It's not needed to be honest, private servers have a (decent) solution which is dynamic respawns. More players killing a mob = faster they respawn in the early zones. This helps the early zones because they are going to be highly contested. As the levels go up, more people end up quitting, or just instancing for a while.
---
This also prevents abuse, as dynamic respawns on high end mobs will end up screwing the economy.
---
So phasing, kills the "WORLD" feeling, as someone can just shard hop when they feel like it by getting invited to another shard. Feels a lot more empty of a world (WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID)
---
Then what is the point of mentioning MC/BWL as one term? 
---
I am happy to find someone so optimistic on behalf of the thousands of clueless people usually playing this game, but I seriously doubt that you will be hitting even half of the predictions you have made in this thread.
---
Didnt that drop the flag? Because the game thinks you died?
---
"Nobody is obliged to sacrifice their personal lives and wellbeing to give you a nice toy to play."
---
Can you tell that to my workplace that has us working for 5 saturdays now and extra 1hr every day because we are behind in stock? 
---
Because in the real working world, you will do extra time to make sure he gets his toy or else you can search for a new job.
---
Wouldn't it be griefing?
---
Agreed. I haven't been following the beta (been playing on a private classic server) but what you're saying, to me at least, is the logical answer.
---
Maybe they're having internal build issues and are waiting for a decent release candidate?
---
Honestly I'd just prefer they learned their lesson from the initial WotLK launch and rather push the date back for a quality product. 
---
Fingers crossed
---
Alright, just for arguments sake. Lets say that Illidan had gotten an equivillant to the ''Arthas' demise'' cutscene from Wrath when we defeat him in TBC. 
---
I think I understand what you mean though. Like, something such as the opening of AQ was way cooler in game than any cutscene could have ever been and not because it looked great or anything but because it was in the actual game and you were there with people. That is your point right?
---
You've been to the Barrens.
---
Cal-zone
---
The class mounts are terrible, especially in pvp or while doing anything like grinding.  They cost mana, interrupt your regen, and can be counter spelled.  I will use the 60% to level with but the 100% mount would need to be free or very close to it for me to go for it over the regular mount.
---
it was not uncommon to have an alt you only play with someone
---
i had a warrior alt i only leveled with a chick and it was a lot of fun
---
like combat is a bit of a.struggle solo when you cant handle adds a lot of the time
---
two people generally can handle a two or three pull rather easily making combat feel easier.
---
im honestly not l9oking forward to solo leveling 1-60 , id much rather do it in a group but yeah its much easier to have an alt you only level with someone rather than a main
---
I was in primary school, all my friends were talking about this game called world of warcraft. I played a lot of warcraft 3 fronzen throne during the time, so I thought they were talking abotu a custom map and didn't get the interest in it.  
---
roughly 4 months pass of them talking none stop about this and I begin to find it strange so I ask one of them about it and I'm told it is a game in itself and if I want to try it? so I visit my friend and I'm burrowing his account to make my first character.  
---
looking through the characters I decide on a troll because it looked fun, and a hunter as I like archers, I log into the game, look at this insanely vast world in a game genre I have never seen before, and the rest is history mixed with some gaming addiction and a very old account of my own.
---
A guild from Frostwolf Germany did the same thing and from what i remember it was the only server where no GM intervened and they refused to open the gate for about a week. People were extremly pissed about it, because we had many big raiding guilds on the server and they worked together with the guild to open it and got fucked lol.
---
Cede Maiori and Grandmasters where the guilds which later became Affenjungs INC.
---
gnome for the lulz
---
Gummy uploaded the "Ooga Gang: Official Trailer" on youtube, but I don't actually know whether he controls one of the characters.
---
I will reconnect with my old server (both alliance and horde) and guildies. That’s a huge plus for me. We will immerse in a world with people we used to know, pvping, battling for resources, trolling its other, surpassing obstacles together (like group quests or killing difficult rates) and general have a grand adventure while leveling. 
---
Back then we took pride on forming a strong server community. In BFA I find that the only community can be foster only within a raiding guild. 
---
I feel that the game back then encouraged players to forge allies, enemies, associations with other guilds and so on. It’s hard for me to describe it but I can tell you this: I still remember around two thousand nicknames from that era, both from horde and alliance. 
---
There were badass hordies which I would run away in sight, there were trolling guilds that everyone will try to screw them up as retaliation, people who played their class so well that they would have an automatic instant invitation from me when I was running dungeons or battlegrounds. I miss that stuff. 
---
Tl;dr: BFA best for solo play, Classic best for community play.
---
Well, I don’t understand this “hey guys let’s just take their word for it!” attitude for a company that has had nothing but missteps for a couple years now and actually firmly held the belief of “you think you do but you don’t” for so long.
---
I wouldn’t put money on it, but I am more than 50% sure there will be a server or 2 that will have such high population that they’ll at least say they’re planning on keeping layering into phase 2 for them, possibly nixxing the idea with a “well be prepared for long queues!!!” type response when the rabbid backlash comes out.
---
Let’s get one thing straight, they only committed to layering ending after phase 1 because they are fully expecting classic to essentially fail and have like a 10% player retention after 2-3 months
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
​**Intended raid/play times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings (CET Timezone). More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
**Aditional info:**
---
\- While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core. 
---
\- Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet. 
---
**Bottom line:**
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/) ​ or check our Discord here [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK ](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
​P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

---
We are working at least 45hr every week. Can you send those studies to my bosses?
---
&gt;Everyones acting like raiding was a hard skill check 
---
I haven't said that anywhere in this thread. To have MC/BWL on farm in the first month you have to:
---
* Have 40 people level up to 60
---
* Have 40 people with decent blue gear
---
* Have 40 people attune
---
* Have 40 people reliably show up for raids
---
Hardcore nerds that will take a month off work for Classic probably will, but 99% of community will not.
---
Ok so youre saying that the first people who reach high lvl that also has the required herb skill to gather Black Lotus will create a monopoly and sell the lotuses for far more than theyre actually worth?  
---
Ok thats fair, i can see that as a valid point.  
---
But the main purpose of Black Lotus is for Flasks right?   
---
So to actually get the recipes for flasks ur gonna have to farm Balnazzar, Ras, and Drakkisath, the people who will rush to 60 and abuse these things are gonna be the top guilds who will use these themselves to create flasks to speedclear the content. Before some fast lvlers or casuals get to 60 i really doubt the few extra black lotuses that actually go on the AH would make a big differance, because casuals who would BUY the black lotuses from the auction house are probably gonna be quite far behind them anyway and when they hit 60 and wanna make flasks the AH will probably be filled with black lotuses, or there will be 0 of them.
---
I'm pretty sure even with the crit buff it falls behind another person receiving windfury. Maybe alliance...
---
This is how I remember it from my vanilla r14 days as well. I can't say for sure that I am right. But in my memory it was like that
---
This. Vanilla RP will be a lot more grounded than how retail has become.
---
What do you mean not being able to see huge crowds? Every server, and every layer is gonna be fucking jampacked, you wont notice it.
---
People love being pedantic on reddit
---
It wasn’t a hard skill check, but a lot of encounters back then were hard gear checks. And a few select ones were coordination/communication checks on your raid.
---
No amount of skill or addons will save you from dying if you dont have an onyxia cloak in BWL, just like it won’t save you on resistance demanding fights. Having 40 people dancing smoothly around Heigan or splitting properly on Thaddius is not hard from a skillcheck point of view, but just as any heroic pug has taught us, the more people, the more mistakes. 
---
People may be used to more complicated mechanics, but they will also be used to every class having a full toolbox if things get dire. 
---
Sure, if it makes you feel like a hero to clear content for the 10th time before anyone else, by my guest, but claiming that casual guilds will clear Naxx fast (even if the term is subjective) seems rather delusional to me.
---
Theres a certain feeling I have towards loot in Vanilla WoW that I haven’t seen in Retail in years.. getting an upgraded weapon at 60 felt like a real powerup. Nowadays it doesn’t feel rewarding, everything is a stat stick.
---
Im not saying its bad, i’m saying I don’t like it.
---
Surprise, People passionate about Classic are also passionate about modern WoW. Some of them do not really even want to switch from a game they've invested years in to one that is just beginning, but, modern WoW is really trash at this moment, and people are discontent. It is a game with no character.
---
Additionally, saying the games are targeted towards different audiences is wrong. Both games at their times were targeted towards casual players. Vanilla wasn't "wow super hard game dont play if u scrub" level of a game. IT was a game for everyone and had something for everyone it had sandbox elements. Retail respectively is also for more casual players, but it somehow has lost the spirit of an MMO. It is a theme park and getting your limbs out of the cart is forbidden.
---
&gt; There weren't enough quests to go from zone to zone and I was nearly always broke because I couldn't afford buying abilities. 
---
This is something that seems a common view, that there are not enough quests. This hasn't been my experience at all. I have played on a couple private server with blizzlike exp, x1 ( vanilla was so long ago so I can't remember such details as exp). I like to complete all quests in a zone and when you do you are always outleveling the first quests in the next zone. There are a lot of quests to put it mildly. 
---
 Also once you hit high lvl 40:s if someone prefers to grind rather then quest there are great areas for that. You can start grinding Timbermaw rep in southern Felwood for example. Gives lots of loot and nice to do a rep grind while you level. Once you hit 50+ you should go to BRD and prepare for 60. In BRD there are endless amount of quests to keep you busy for tons of runs.
---
 Also not being able to afford buying abilities is something that can be fixed by a simple google search. In classic you can't buy every single skill rank from the trainer. Also you need to plan out things a bit. Also small things like always taking the quest reward that sells for the most etc. Getting a mount at 40 is easy if you have a little bit of a clue.
---
&gt; I really want to understand why you all want to play so badly short of just 'nostalgia'. What's your main reason? 
---
Because it's a rewarding game. I like that it's slow going that is why I played on x1 exp private servers. The journey to 60 is almost the best part. You get to know a lot of people and you get attached to your character you have worked hard on.
---
I’m hyped but I’m afraid the bubble will burst for me once I realize that I still have a demanding job, a 5 month old son to look after as a priority along with many other responsibilities. I wonder how much of the fund was the fact that I was a 19-24 year old with little responsibilities outside of a part time job and a uni lectures.
---
Felwood, Duskwood, Plaguelands
---
I could have sworn that the enemy flag carriee would appear on the map only after a longer period of time, so as to eventually make it possible to find him. Source: I played a lot of WSG in late Vanilla/Early BC
---
How about people who created their acc in classic get that. Or the longer you havr been actively subbed the earlier you get access. Or any other non money related system. Come on mate, don't be so unimaginative.
---
You can't. BGs do not give XP.
---
&gt; realised they were mistaken and have now re-approved it. We do make mistakes,
---
The problem is that you guys tend not to like admitting your mistakes.  When a user appeals a moderation action, the default response to is to defend and justify.
---
Users are happy to tolerate moderator imperfection, but it's a two part deal - you guys have to be willing to admit your imperfection through action.  Words aren't enough.  "Hey guys, we make mistakes!"  "Hey mods, I think you made a mistake here.  "No, we didn't - stop questing us."
---
Did you miss the constant shitting on BFA or saying Classic will kill retail or retail is for imbeciles that always goes on?
---
Play Warcraft 3s frozen throne xpac (human campaign) might clear a bit of it up
---
In vanilla servers were 3k dude
---
Honeymoon &gt; Wow anyway.
---
You lose what ,1 maby 2 weeks?
---
I expect the release day and first weekend to be one big queue with lag anyway.
---
As opposed to current retard wow the game is actually fun. Questing where I can read and engage myself in the story. Exploration for new grinding spots/treasure chests/fun of exploration. Difficulty in gameplay, in retard wow you can one button macro and top dps, but in classic you have to pay attention to what you’re doing. Pull one mob too many as a warrior and have a nice trip back from the graveyard. Community, retard wow has 0 human interaction and there is no need to converse with any human, but in classic working together and making friends is built into the game with style. Retard wow is jam packed with meaningless tasks, classic wow everything you do will add up. You have goals for gear in classic and you can obtain them, but in retard wow if you want the perfect piece of heat you have to roll the slot machine and pray for the super mythic titanforge double socket bis traits. Classic is better that’s why retail is dying.
---
They're not going to have to pay for a mount, so really we should just be supportive
---
Classic vs retail leveling is like get to vs get through
---
!remindme 1 year
---
I really disagree with you, not too much point arguing further - we will have to wait and see.
---
Back in Cata I had a Worgen druid with a few trinkets like Orb of Deception. Counting human form and wolf form, all my druid forms, and my trinkets, I was up to 9. I would constantly brag to my friends about NINE FORMS. NINEFORMSBRO
---
Good times lol
---
Seems the more mature RPers will move to classic. That, imo, is brilliant.
---
The more tough the game is, the more achievement you feel for being successful at it, and this is all the more true in an MMO!
---
Imho wow got that level of tedium and difficulty just right: it's not so bad as to outright turn people off but hard enough to make each new level and piece of gear feel meaningful. On top of that it captures the feeling of being in the actual world of warcraft lore.
---
I think you're a little biased. It feels like a power up when i get a new item because I can see that I'm doing more damage, killing mobs faster, and competing with stronger players for dps rankings. Especially so in mythic+ where I'm supposed to be doing about 1/3rd of the damage. Getting an upgrade and running mythic+ again makes me feel stronger and more efficient.
---
Yes, you are that person. People like you are the reason classic has personal loot lol.
---
thats why when making friends u gotta make sure to remember the names and add them to friends, or [battle.net](https://battle.net)! so you can keep playing together.  
---
I guess Layering is even beneficial in that manner haha, the fact that you "might" not see the same person for some time encourages you to add them to friends so you dont lose em

I've answered that elsewhere in the thread, and I'm on mobile so can't type a lengthy response at the moment. I'll try answer later.

All raids will be cleared the moment the server goes live.

Aq 2.5hr

Naxx 2hr

Either is great for pvp. I'd say having a chance against mages is better than winning rogue vs rogue matchups but it's not an obvious choice so I'd say what you'd secretly prefer out of the two is the better option.

Looking for Sunday afternoon or morning raiding guild.
---
Or a guild that raids Saturday Night and Sunday Afternoon.
---
I plan to play a resto druid and have a bunch of raiding experience from classic and most expansions.
---
Thanks !
---
RNG is RNG. I’m not going to stop rolling on obvious upgrades because I won the last 2 pieces. 
---
I also haven’t heard about personal loot only the trade window. PLoot in my opinion is stupid af.
---
You mean giving everyone Ashbringer and Thunderfury in an easy to complete class quest wasn't a good idea? who woulda thunk.
---
It's probably stupid to you because you steal loot.
---
My point is that storytelling through cutscenes is lazy
---
But it takes much more work, time and resources than in-game representation?
---
How is rolling on loot stealing it though? Ms / Os, mostly PUGs.
---
You dont need gear to do molten core really, the only obstacle would be ragnaros as he can hit pretty hard.  
---
Im pretty sure APES will manage to get into molten core and attempt to clear everything except ragnaros in the first week.

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**
---

Because you need other people to succeed
---
&gt;100 hours to 60 is entirely possible
---
Can you provide a source for that being done, ever, in the entirety of vanilla WoW? Actual vanilla, that is. Speedrunners had two years to figure it out, so if it was possible they definitely would have done so. 
---
&gt;especially if you're using Rested XP,
---
One bubble of rested XP (5% of a level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting.
---
So in two weeks, you can get a maximum of 42 bubbles, 2.1 levels, of rested exp... if you get summoned to a nearby inn or city the second you log in, never leave, and ignore the 1.5 lvl rested exp cap. 
---
To get from 1-60 in 5 days /played requires not spending more than 6 hours of grinding on any one level, so the maximum possible difference rested exp can make in 2 weeks is slightly less than 6 hours. 
---
Can you provide a source for someone doing 1-60 in 106 hours of actual vanilla WoW?
---
Well, now I'm sad I can't tank a little bit more time on it.
---
What "new" era do you plan to shape exactly? The one that was released 15 years ago and nobody remembers fully, that's why we can't implement things properly, or the classic 2.0 with artificial additions to the game to make it feel authentic?
---
IE: Black and white filter on a color movie
---
You're acting like layering for a few days is some sort of catastrophe, when in reality it's a mild inconvenience.
---
That's illegal
---
chances of getting a beta invite were always next to zero.
---
Always thought the paladin mount looked awesome. What don't you like about it?
---
Unless it is a real upgrade for a group member.  Don't be a greedy goblin.
---
On the other hand my guild who is clearing nax on private servers love to bring at least one feral just to buff the fury warriors/rogues most people who are saying you wont get a spot in raids dont know what theyre talking about. 
---
Will you have to put more effort in? Sure but its worth it if its the class you wanna play.
---
&gt; There weren't enough quests to go from zone to zone
---
Well yeah, quest levels were not zone by zone, so you often re-visited zones. This is something I actually *like* about Vanilla, because it makes zones feel more like actual places. Contrast Retail, where you are led by the hand through a zone, and completely forget about it not ten seconds later.
---
Also, there were enough quests to level from 1 to 60, but you had to have the knowledge of how to level through them, and where some of those were to be found. This means that knowledge of the game made you better at it - again, something that I adore about Vanilla.
---
&gt; I was nearly always broke because I couldn't afford buying abilities. 
---
Almost like you had to apply your brain to not be broke - you know, actually appraise which activities net you money, and which don't, and then comparing that knowledge with the things you like doing, and thus, finding a a way of making money. 
---
So basically, and I realize this sounds a bit harsh, you don't like Vanilla because the game doesn't play itself for you. Which is exactly why other people *like* Vanilla: You gotta apply yourself a bit if you want to get somewhere. Some find this inconvenient and unfun; For others, it's the essence of engagement and enjoyment.
---
lets be reality, most people won't even have saved enough gold to get either of them before P2.
---
You misspelled Shaman.
---
If all you want to do is bother people roll a night elf priest and mind control people into lava/mobs
---
You're definitely maining a Gnome aren't you
---
Beacuse it takes much work it makes storytelling not lazy ? i'm not talking about cutscenes being lazy i'm talking about STORYTELLING
---
No they don't, Kidney Shot is on a different DR than Cheap Shot (and other stuns)
---
Update: Just finished my handover. 
---
Boss was a dbag wanted handover 9am Monday. basically put me in a position with no notice to have to get all paperwork done over the weekend. Had to drop my 75 year old mum to the train station at 7am so she could get to her doctors appointment since I couldn’t drop her there. Drove 1 1/2 hours to his place to handover. No way was I going to play passenger after finalising so had the OH pick me up. 
---
No discussion to send an email notice out, he told my colleagues instead of letting me break the news, tried to get me to return uniforms (wtf), if I hadn’t emailed him every job still pending for customers I doubt he would have asked. 
---
Free and easy now waiting for my new job to start. 
---
Guys, don’t settle for a shit boss.
---
Power guilds and players will dominate within HOURS...   not good
---
It wont matter much for what..2 years..or even on all classic. Even rn you can start playing and dont miss nothing. Only cosmetic stuff.
---
For me im debating..i have some irl stuff that i have to finish and i know even working and studying at the same time that i will always find time for wow..

If a company has to rely on 15 year old games like classic and wc3 remake to lead them to success , let alone thr fact that even diablo 2  was a way better product compared to diablo 3, i do not want these shitty developers to change anything as it was. They are not capable of making appealing gameplay to save their lives. If you just watch their Q&amp;As mixed with kevin  jordans reviews on it , it turns to a fucking cringe fest. Do not let these people ruin our experience. It will turn to a corrupted money grabing project. Hell they are trying to to this now by not giving EU specific language servers to obviously save money. Gtfo with these suggestions now!

Don't think they just let the treants get away..that's extra wood

I love the battlecow just sitting in the lake
---
Ah. My biggest fuss with personal loot is I miss the little things WoW used to have, and killing a boss and having people gather around inspecting the gear was one of those little things.
---
Personal loot kills yet another minor detail to the game. It doesn’t feel like the boss dropped the item, it feels like it was conjured out of nothing for killing the boss.

Back on my vanilla server(Proudmoore) the best geared tank on in the best guild was a Night Elf. For the life of me I can't remember his name, but he was a legend on our server. Guild was Serenity.

Lol I'm heading on my honeymoon today and my poor wife has had to list to me say "what a great summer my first trip to Europe and WOW classic," she doesnt get why WOW gets looped in with our honeymoon on level of excitement.
---
I'm not saying they'll never get a spot and will never get into a raid because of their spec, they're just much less prevalent as their counterparts. However, a lot of people will try to take the easy route and just leave out feral/balance. Especially whilst pugging.
---
There is 2 more month left. Why would you not expect Blizzard to fix this by then?
---
If it has been reported plenty of time etc. just chill out and wait for them to fix it. Maybe hunter is at the bottom of the fix list for whatever reason... Just wait and if it is not fixed by release time - Blizzard will get their fair share of shitstorm
---
This won´t happen again with how thirsty everyone is about streaming firstkills.
---
I started a fresh account on taiwanese realms and its been pretty good. only thing is i guess the games not big at all there because their biggest realm im on is shadowmoon and its near empty and the AH has some things not in stock that you'd see in even some dead US realms.
---
I suppose that's a fair complaint, but with how players are today and how they're desperate to be efficient I don't think blizzard can realistically make a good decision here. If they keep it, the fanbase will complain about ninja looters. If they remove it, it's innacurate. Sometimes there are design issues with old games that we just miss when we're young. Non-personal loot is unfortunately one of those issues.

Woah. That was very well made.
---
True! Wrote wrong. Ment the leggings are bis:)
---
0/30/21 (or maybe 1/29/21) is a good hybrid spec for this (i.e. nature's swiftness plus 16-20% more mana plus feral plus maybe nature's grasp). I think it's a fun class -- you can do almost anything. I liked playing a hybrid in pvp too -- mostly healing, but getting off clutch bashes or pounces or feral charges. And you're very slippery with the travel form or dash. It's not easy to know when to press all of those buttons. Makes it interesting.
---
And you are really the best at some things, like mobility and quality of life (and flag running) -- fish form, travel form, stealth, etc. The +15% speed boost in forms from the pvp set is great if you can get that. (I think rank 10 is not too hard.)
---
Don't treat regrowth like flash heal; think of it more as an inefficient long duration HoT. e.g. it's good to put it up before you go into bear form for a long time (where you will regen). If you need more throughput then you don't have any choice but to use it, but it uses up a lot of mana.
---
Don't out-level your friends, I guess? maybe have an alt to play when they're off? or work on your professions or something?
---
I'm just glad we're gonna have an mmo where levelling is actually part of the experience and its not just a rush to max level (where the 'REAL GAME' begins)
---
Or give an answer to the problem, insted of this bullshit, please

And also one for "Did I just get into beta?" / "The Beta just showed up on my launcher, but I can't connect!"
---
&gt; Minimum play time for just hitting 60 is like 6 days

lmao
---
If anything, people will be faster on classic.
---
It's the internet I really didnt expect less. I'm not all that interested in classic but when I heard it announced I was happy for the people who truly love this version of wow cause at least they dont have to worry about there progress gettimg deleted or scummy admin practices of private servers. Just sad to see some people in th3 classic community are petty like OP lol.
---
You can eat Fear with your Felhunter, you can't eat stuns. You can charm rogues while they open up on you, but it's not quite the same. Neither technique is relable because your Fehlhunter might eat a Shadow Word:Pain or a Corruption instead, but it's a thing. Fear is less of an issue for Warlocks in my opinion.
---
Personally, I'd go UD Warlock 10/10 times just for aesthetics, but if you really want to tryhard PvP, Orc gets more mileage out of their Racial. There is no cooldown to it, so it will be useful more often than WotF. Maybe more importantly, it helps out a bunch against Melees, all of which (Rogues, Rets, Warriors) use stuns and most of which give you a hard time.
---
Desolace. It's such a chill place and most of the time its a low pop zone. (In my experiance)
---
Its like gaming when its raining...
---
Now draw a female nelf warrior!
---
I feel Agi/spirit like Wolf + a fast one-hand and shield feels better. And gives vetter sustain dmg. As ago helps the flurry uptime and spirit to regen your mana. Offload a flame shock into totems and regen mana. Searing/stoneskin only and you are good. Other totems are too expensive.
---
Never oom and decent sustain dmg and also, can tank 3 mobs never dipping dangerously low.
---
Fuck off please :p
---
Vanilla wow was made in 5 years as well though - in a time where Computer Games just didn't make the same Money they do today. It is a completely unfair comparison.
---
Also how do you know how many Blizzard employees are working on Classic? Do you seriously think it is 50+ employees on this atm? xDD
---
Also they are constantly working on the game. Doing stress tests, Fixing bugs etc. 
---
Just because your precious hunter bugs have not been adressed yet - which they will - is no reason to talk Blizzard down.
---
If you want to give anyone the blame it is Activision. 
---
I love the Phrase "Current Blizzard is just a bunch of overpaid morons collecting pay checks for doing nothing" although it is probably Activision collecting the pay checks :p
---
Please inform yourself before you make Statements like that you obviously have no clue :)
---
Empty ah is exactly the reason why i wont play in the first month.
---
No money, no proper backpacks.
---
For me. Nightmare and i guess for many other warlocks aswell.
---
Yeah that was the joke I was making. Which no one here got lol due to the downvote count.
---
You healthy noobs. While you're wasting time pushing up, I'm gonna be going big dick NEET energy. All that wasted time that could've gotten you to 60 at a real gamers pace. Cant wait to see you in STV kids, I'll give you all the push ups you want ;)
---
I don't remember it having this many toxic people to be honest. It had its trolls, it's the internet, but the toxic severity is way higher now. For example, toxic in 05 was "alt F4 and uninstall noob". Now it's " you're autistic, drink bleach get cancer and kill yourself".
---
&gt; On WoW's Forum the Guild already said it was a joke and was giving the $$ back. They will be opening the gates soon. 
---
&gt; There is a post on the forum over there where this guild said they did it as a joke and will be opening the gates soon. They have returned any $$ that people gave them. 
---
&gt; Err, it's a joke if you didn't realise.
---
yeah sounds nice. but i dont want to actively play feral in pve anyways. as soon as phase 3 starts i will be running flags for the next 3 months and start pve when aq40 comes out.
---
so my goals are phase 1: rush 60, get dungeon gear, go motlen core for some epics
---
phase 2: farm more gear while getting rank 4-6 from open pvp
---
phase 3 onwards: run flags for the rest of my life
---
Did you just assume his gender?!
---
That's one of the problems imo though. Having dead servers you need to merge.
---
Have played on some private servers as well as back in the day but discounting private server experience what felt the greatest for me was no doubt hitting rank 11 on my dwarf warrior. I was a lonewolf so never played with pvp premades so made for a much slower grind going solo. Rank 11 might not seem that high but it was very time consuming but I had a fantastic time. I hardly did any 60 PvE so the gear I started with was total shit. Felt very cool to have the full PvP rare set as well as the special mount from rank 11. The full rare PvP set together with the item rewards from being exalted with WSG, AB and AV wasn't close to having access to late game raid gear but it was enough to be very strong in PvP nonetheless.
---
&gt; his
---
I see what you did there
---
Oh you’re right, greedy shits is way more respectful/civil.
---
You guys are doing a great Job keeping a toxic very large subreddit sort of clean :)
---
While getting almost nothing in return... Thanks every1 =)
---
I actually went to gamestop to grab Everquest 2  wanting to try out something bigger than Runescape. That goddamn original box for WoW though... it immediately caught my eye and as soon as i opened the Velcro flap and saw the alliance races fighting a dragon my mind was instantly made up. Logging into northshire as a human warrior the place seemed crazy huge and then discovering it’s just a starting zone and seeing how big the work was. Absolutely game changing for me as a gamer.
---
Yeah maybe, but then main cities might be insane with 10-20k people. Not sure.
---
BfA isn't bad due to bugs though.. It's bad because every single core design decision those dumbfucks made is antithetical to what makes WoW good. Pruning every class, removing tons of abilities, azerite gear getting WORSE with ilvl, etc etc. And to top it all off, the big feature of the xpac was allied races and the trolls/humans didn't come out for a YEAR. A FUCKING YEAR. It's like the devs are actively trying to deter players... But no, they're genuinely just that bad at design and that out of touch with players.
---
But bugs were not the issue in all of this tbh
---
Damn i hope they make a short trailer for the opening in the same quality as retail cinematics. Imagine seeing c'thun in HD...
---
&gt; where they normally have majority of bugs squashed before they do a large update
---
First time I see
---
No they cannot
---
I dont know about you but i absolutely HATE being rooted as a rogue, it leaves you completely humiliated and open to focus.
---
As good a reset dwarf racial is, its on a longer cooldown and potentially you CAN vanish and get a cheapshot off still in between bleed ticks etc.
---
i prefer this one , TBH:

Man, haven't you learned anything from pride month?
---
That‘s exactly my hype for classic. Fresh new servers. Leveling will be so much fun with all those new guys hanging around!
---
Yes it is in the beta right now.
---
I am sure they care a lot
---
You use slam once every 30 minutes at most though
---
Well, the thing is you seem like a sensible person, as I am. I would be completely realistic if I had to wait in a queue, and if the servers went down after I sat in queue for 2 hours. I've been gaming for like 18 years, so I expect this. 
---
But, somehow people still completely lose their shit when they can't play on launch day. I guess Blizz was just trying to choose the lesser of the 2 evils, which I can probably say would be to go with layering. They would be completely bombarded with emails and reports if there was an 8 hour queue tbh
---
To anyone reading this far: This guy is legit and you can take every word of him at face value. I’d trust him to look after my dog.
---
My two cents (there is no right or wrong. Just different decisions will lead to a different subreddit in 3 months and you have to decide what subreddit this will be)
---
1.	Not nearly harsh enough. The one good thing memes can do is hit the front page and advertise classic. But for that we have way too many low quality memes and artworks. The constant “here is my computer” or “look what i have drawn” or “look i printed out that other drawing and put it on my wall” make this subreddit look like r/wowclassiccirclejerk. I always have to spend 5 minutes downvoting the lowest tier of posts and hide them. They drown out other discussion. I don’t care if discussions are tired or even plainly wrong, at least there is talk. I usually like the “meme monday” or whatnot approach, but that kills memes about very recent events. Most generals memes can wait a few days though. If they can’t, then perhaps they are not so good.
---
2.	A bit, yeah. Votes can handle that to some extent. Especially let them up if there is outrage. I used to be a proponent of combining them into single posts years ago but that drowns out the discussion. Reddiquette makes sense here. It could annoy us but just because we have seen them before does not mean everyone has. And we have **a lot** of lurkers and tourists. Once things get too ridiculous - when they jump the shark a and turn into an utter circle jerk intervene. Usually that is when the community comments that this question/point/discussion is tired and gets upvoted. And that is almost never when a significant amount of people gets upset. But usually: Downvote, hide, report if you have to and move on.
---
3.	You will have to run a much tighter ship. I don’t mind the openness to confrontation of this community. Even though people can be new levels of stupid. At least they don’t cross the line and use slurs or heavy insults. I am mainly pointing at quality of posts. Do they lead to discussion? If they are memes etc. are they artwork? When r/gameofthrones went through the stages of grief there were times where 15+/20 posts on the front page were artwork. Artwork after artwork. That was their coping mechanism when there was not much good left to say.
---
You can message me any time in Discord if you just want a different/outside perspective on things.

I was looking for something like this but sadly the download is broken.
---
Is it possible you could reupload this or send a link in DM?
---
You thinking that you would be able to do the same things as streamers is kinda cute.
---
Idk if that's real to be honest lol but interesting
---
It will be like it was in the past. There will be the few elite that will blow past all content.
---
 **&lt;Semper Danica&gt; \[EU-PVP\] \[Alliance\] \[18+\]\[DK\]**  
---
**Language:** Danish  
---
**Time zone:** CET  
---
**Guild type:** Semi-Hardcore PvE and PvP  
---
**Raid times:** 20:00-22:30 (subject to change) two times a week. The days will be decided by the raiders once we are at that point in the game.  
---
**Loot system:** TBD by the raidteam(s), either DKP or loot council based.  
---
Semper Danica (SD) is a 100% pure danish speaking MMO guild. Our members are all 18+ and are expected to behave mature and respectful, but still with plenty of room to have fun.SD is a multi-mmo guild, which means we also offer activities in other mmo games. We were founded back in 2002 and have been active in several MMORPGS through out the years. We have always had a strong presence in WoW since vanilla and plan on keep this going forward. We are trying something new with Classic since we in this game will be going Alliance as opposed to our normal Horde tendencies.  
---
**What we offer:**  
---
* Downing content in a timely manner.
---
* Laughs and good times, but in a respectful environment.
---
* A good mix of classes and specs, with room for some of the more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavor to the raid; a Feral druid with option to OT and provide crit buffs, a shadow priest that boosts shadow dmg and so on.
---
* Dungeon runs, whilst lvling and afterwards to gear for raids and acquire gold.
---
* Plans for organised Battle grounds.
---
* Spreadsheets/lists with overview of guild professions and guildbank.
---
* Helpful and knowledgeable environment.
---
* Social activities in-game and RL where we have yearly Christmas and summer parties/get togethers and smaller stuff through out the year.
---
* Active in other games.
---
**What we seek:**  
---
We are looking for players that are willing and motivated to participate in raids and the social aspects of the game. We don't just want people who can top the meters. Situational awareness, survivability and most importantly fitting in well with SD both during raids and outside of raids is of great importance to us.

Hi, can you give me an idea of what the pay id like? 
---
Or do you do it for free?
---
They need to do another wave, lots of people have dropped off due to both the imbalance and just the general grind of getting to 40.
---
I wouldn’t mind cheaper mounts.  Horses really aren’t such a luxury.
---
"big hunter profiles", "Nutty"
---
Who the fuck is Nutty and why the fuck should i care if he doesnt play hunter?
---
Explain this to me and i may grab my pitchfork.
---
I wasnt the one who mentioned them in one term.. so idk.
---
And i only made one prediction.. top 10% guilds will clear bwl within a day after release and aq/naxx after 1 reset tops. I base myself on what i've seen on pservers and then toned down my expectations a bit. I might be wrong but noone can tell now
---
The servers will crash a few days before being 100% stable, you are good to go
---
fuarrRRR top warrior AU for sure
---
Whoever they are, this is their legacy now. I hope they tell their grandchildren about their moment in the sun.
---
I heard APES Will be back this x around, and for them i thibk your timings are about spot on.
---
Results which dont affect 99% of the people complaining. So again why does it matter so much?
---
Wow what a trip down memory lane, I starred as male human bartender in Hunter vs world 5. I don't think i ever actually watched it until today because my internet was too shit back in the days.
---
"rise up"? wtf are you talking about?
---
Imagine this would be the case in a classic private server in 2019. People would tear it apart.
---
But honestly, I just can’t see them release the game with that many class bugs. Either they will fix 3/4 of them. Or they might even... delay the game.
---
&gt;	A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.
---

---
I don't like the armour or horse mounts in general
---
Healer is killed so my noob-ass dies aswell
---
Even worse
---
That kids face is so punchable.
---
I actually prefer the grind. I love putting on some music and grinding mobs for a few hours. Sometimes I even do a little RP in my head and pretend I'm Demi Lovato, Legendary Slayer of Green Dragon Whelps.
---
In theory, sure. You can also schedule more time and/or resources at the beginning of a project too but that estimate is really hard to do. There are outside factors that come into play also that are outside of dev control. Im in a position now where I have more impact in that area but these decisions can be made very high up. What do you do? Fail and then tell a VP "See I told you so"? It can happen but it can also be really bad for your employment prospects.
---
as a german i feel the need to tell you, that (from experience) people here tend to help you out and even if they are bad at english they gona try to explain certain things. 
---
i, for example, wont start on a german server, i just get anxious about how items, mobs and other stuff is pronounced or written in german. but i can see the problem many people here have in terms of language barriers and the lack of english knowledge.
---
&gt; But it shouldn't be the responsibility of the consumer to consider crunch time when buying a product. 
---
Why not? I mean obviously by far the most responsibility lies on the employer. But consumers should be aware of things like this when they are buying a product. Like if something was made with actual slavery it would be pretty irresponsible as a consumer to buy it anyway. 
---
In this case it might not not a bad enough offense to outright boycott the company, but generally in the games industry, consumers also have some responsibility in how their games are made. And we can help making sure workers are treated well.
---
I would suggest the faction you have played the least. Personally I have played so much horde, pretty much know every single quest inside and out. Going horde would make for very fast leveling when classic comes out no doubt but might just go alliance so I can experience something a bit different even if it will be a lot slower going.
---
Yeah I don't play with sound but I can see the difference between day and night on retail.
---
Would you rather play with annoying gnomes or edgelord undead?
---
This is one of the reasons why fresh priv servers are so fun to play.. just everyone being at the same pace and at the same zones is so fun.
---
I was there the first time and it wasn't as great as some people remember it. It involved a lot of waiting for stuff to respawn.
---
The lore and stuff especially in vanilla is much better alliance side and I just love their cities and always missed them when playing horde.
---
May the light have mercy on your soul levelling paladin though! If you can push through you get one of the strongest pve and PvP classes at the end!
---
For brewmaster, nothing will even remotely translate over, brewmaster (and blood dk and vengeance DH) were designed where tank design philosophy shifted away from “tanks have more HP, more armor, more block than other classes and have to generate threat to be an effective tank” to the current active mitigation style of tanking, so stuff like managing brews and stagger is completely void from classic.
---
Once again, mistweaver’s style of healing compared to the classic healers doesn’t translate over at all, mistweaver was always the one with the unique healing kit with stances and melee DPS rotations and channeling soothing mists and being really mobile. Closest thing is priest or paladin since in BfA, monks are focused more on tank healing and those 2 healers are all about efficient single target healing.  
---
If you’re thinking about windwalker primarily with its playstyle of never pressing the same button twice and managing two resources at the same time, rogue is relatively close in playstyle to a windwalker, and if you’re not interested in that then fury warrior might also be a possibility but fury doesn’t really play like a windwalker.

MORE DOTS!

They have been fixing stuff already in beta
---
Point to the part where I said crafting professions were food to level with- aside from leatherworking, which alongside skinning is quite a good passive money maker as you level if you just vendor the leather you work.

Sorry but as someone that went through chemo: Screw you.

As a long time shaman player I earthbind, searing totem, flame shock, and start healing while he’s attacking my healer I’m healing the healer, and keeping him (the rogue) dotted up.  Then I probably throw down a warstomp (Tauren) or just straight up resist his stuns (Orc) and hit him with my flametongue weapon. (Hope he is wearing his fire resist undies)

Rolled ally in Vanilla and played horde since TBC. Looking forward to being ally again.
---
The tweaker clans shall return ;)
---
He obviously just means the aesthetics of it.
---
artwork kind of sucks.
---
Considering the size difference between that puny human and the  tauren with his big wooden weapon id go for Horde in this case
---
Because there are already laws in place to protect the labourforce in most Western countries. If you feel that these are not sufficient, there's ways to lobby for more regulation. 
---
&gt; Like if something was made with actual slavery it would be pretty irresponsible as a consumer to buy it anyway 
---
But it isn't.
---
Gms killing  classic this early?
---
Hopefully they will remove it after a few days at most,  otherwise classic will be less then what it should be.

The sense of accomplishment. The struggle is real but so is the reward for doing so.

get it fucking done BOYS

Theres an official classic wow forum

its cool and sucks at the same time, the tauren model is what seems of

If it were me:

1. Unlock the gates, triggering the 10-hour event in which the offending guild can obtain the scarab lord title and mount.

2. 10 hour temporary ban for members of that guild.

Feign death.

I can just hear the sound of drinking it in osrs too.

|  This is technically still incorrect as 1.6 adds tracking to the friendly flag carrier but it gets rid of enemy flag carrier tracking as well which was my primary issue. Seems like Blizzard took the private server route on this one.  
---
There are a couple other examples where they went the thing that makes more sense in the "spirit" of vanilla, but at least there's no tracking the enemy flag carrier, which greatly changes the meta.
---
Look if you do less damage than the tank or not providing heals or valuable buffs, your not getting loot. 
---
But you can come along though.
---
Yeah, if you think everything is fine, then obviously don't do anything about it. I was talking about the people who are "ah, this is awful", and then pretend as if they are completely powerless to do anything as consumers. 
---
The last thing I said: Gamers usually don't care much though, they just want their games.
---
We must protest for a longer one than.
---
Why not go read some other posts? Why be a tool and insulting. If the poster is excited, let him/her be excited. You do you and !@$!@ off
---
gnome is better pvp overall 
---
dwarf is better vs rogues.
---
Well I started vanilla in Jan. 2006 after I wanted to buy a new PC game for a computer I just bought during Christmas. The guy at Best Buy said Undead were the best race and he explained this video of a Rogue killing level 60s in PvP with the starting dagger.
---
 I remember logging in as an Undead Mage. I kept seeing people run by with the same little pet but with different names and wanted one too and kept wondering how to get one so I asked. They said it is a pet that only Warlocks get, f*ck I made a Mage I thought. I found my map and opened it and did not realize at the time that you could zoom out, I thought the map of Tirisfal Glades was the entire game and end game must be in the Undercity lol. I was very surprised and it was a holy sh*t moment when I discovered that you could zoom out on the map. The world was way, way bigger than I ever thought possible. I had never seen something like that in a game, it was crazy.
---
It was always going to. 
---
WoW has never had a good community outside of the game itself, every forum is a shitshow of casuals complaining about parts of the game they have no experience playing. 
---
Best advice is to use reddit for the occasional large, well-written informative posts and curve all of this dick-measuring shit.
---
People who want to raid will still enjoy retail more, and people who want to play a more traditional RPG with no real worry for endgame content will play classic. That's all.

Hey, don't censor yourself, be free. Let it all out, because in the end, you responded.
---
Leeway and layering, my friend
---
This is at the top of the list of issues with WSG, along with the “recently dropped flag” debuff (implemented in patch 2.3) and the fact that using certain speed items causes the flag to drop (????)
---
Alliance is better in both PvE and **organized** PvP because of paladins. For PvP pug:s horde is better.
---
Oh lmao, why did I think that they removed bug reporting
---
Play with yourself in the meantime.
---
Trust that we all have the same idea of fun and you are right! Perfect. How do I feel this morning?
---
Not with PoD
---
Main alliance. They will either come aswell or youll just easily find new friends on your side.
---
But check the thighs on the human. Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. Think of the power he can get behind those strikes.
---
Yeah of course its just one of those specs where youll have to do twice the work to get yourself to stand out not really a lazymans class/spec

I do believe you've mistaken r/classicwow for r/classicwowplus

**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **(RP)-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.

2 Months to remove a flag. This is terrifying.
---
Back against the wall so the flag isn't showing.
---
Wouldn’t it mostly depend on population size of each faction?
---
This is the driving force behind the reason I play EvE Online.
---
Have you seen the steam tanks? Have you seen the ballistas? 
---
The tanks arent exaxtly up to ww1 standards. Id say that 5 ballistas could take down one siege tank in a couple volleys. Besides, the tanks werr designed to attack walls and buildings, not other weapons or people. 
---
Uh, tech/gnomes werent left out in wc3. That was when steam tanks were introduced. Weaponized gyrocopters(with machine guns and bombs), and morter teams. Goblins showed up in shredders. 
---
I really wouldnt compare terrans and protoss with gnomish tech. Gnomes are like 1800 cyberpunk. Terrans are 2300 stuff. Protoss are like year 3000+ stuff. 
---
Blizzards writing...has been less than consistant. Its not like it would be hard to show why aircrafy wouldnt be used. Just have shamans create a lightning storm over the battlefield, or mages create blizzard, or druids tornados, or archers shooting down any air stuff. 
---
Wc2 and wc3 both had air units. Dragon/gryphon riders for wc2. And too many to name for wc3. Their weakness being how long it took to train them, their cost to train, speed, and clunkeyness to use them. Get a few archers or towers and bye bye dragon. In a world of hunters with magic arrows, i dont see air power being much of a concern. 
---
The only time air superiority would matter is if aircraft got to ww2 levels. Where they could bomb ground forces from so high up they couldnt be seen easily. But until then, they always have the spell casters and archers to worry about.
---
fuck that, I want to be an elemental shammy.
---
And the CC for humanoids will help as well. CC in general sort of will be very necc. even when leveling. When fighting demons/elementals try banish, or with demons enslave as well. use (carefully) fear when figthing multiple mobs (finding out how savely or not you can do this). Curse of weakness. curse of tongues - all very valid choices and sort of necc in vanilla (classic).
---
Warlocks are quite impressive soloing through world content - almost a mini army by itself - but the playstyle is nothing like you are used in retail.
---
Because it's a slower paced game and nostalgic reasons, that's it.
---
I also can't wait to see what changes they will be making to classic 2.0 and the new addon development.
---
Call of Warcraft?
---
What do you mean this thread? People haven't stopped talking about it in every classic related sub, forum, stream etc. Get with thw times bro
---
Me2 actually. 31/20 elemental!!
---
&gt;Leveling on a fresh can actually be quicker than leveling on an existing server. Once you get passed the initial zerg, literally everywhere is totally empty.
---
This makes no sense as on an existing server everything is empty from the beginning and there is no Zerg to get past.
---
Kill him.
---
One of my friends was a pretty successful balance raider back in the day. But my lord, did you need to sink the time into it and know your class inside out.
---
Why doesnt everyone have their personal military to protect them from assault or break ins? Why do we discipline people who get caught doing these things they weren't supposed to do. Its like we are punishing people for doing natural things like striving for the easiest way to get the most stuff while other people are not doing a better job of making it hard for them.
---
Do you think this is good for all taurens ?
---
I'd think you would need a decurser?
---
I honestly think the mounts are important economic sinkholes for Vanilla and makes the economy better and gives people something to work towards. That said, I hear you :P
---
Play what you want to spend your time looking at, because if you choose something that is based on other people it's not organic, try them out and play the game for what it's supposed to be, fun.
---
Im not sure. 
---
Typically people who like pvp play horde, i think this was confirmed by Ion or one of the devs. I think they states that the class fantasy of horde draws in people who want to pvp. This is a generalization though. 
---
In modern and through out the history of modern i have noticed that when i have played horde i win more often and can pug rbgs with better teams. For arena it is fairly similar though.
---
Irrelevant in this situation - these are projects with specific release dates and the necessary work must be done on a hard deadline, even if general productivity is lower for those extra hours. This isn’t assembly line work.
---
I've gone down this road with people and I wouldn't bother. The average person has no idea whatsoever client/server infrastructure, scaling, sw development or even how their computer works outside of double clicking in icon. Trying to explain how and why porting classic is different from a pserver is like slamming your face into a wall. What the classic team has done in the time that they did it is really impressive but people are still gonna scream bloody murder because the beta doesn't match their memories from when they were 12 or whatever private server they were a hero on.
---
What are your main choices?
---
Well I'm not going to rush through leveling, that is just my plan to get a good experience at launch (for me that means being able to play a lot during those initial days, as it is an experience that can't be had again).
---
Also, I've levelled through vanilla and TBC so many times that the "journey" part is quite different for me know. Still enjoyable, but in a different way and "planning" things doesn't ruin the journey anymore, because I already know so much about the process.
---
I just noticed something,,,, you are playing on an empty server.... so unless you log in the 1st one you have to multiply your time x3.
---
**&lt;Nebula&gt;**
---
(EU PVP Alliance - Semi Hard-core)
---
**About Us:**
---
Nebula began as a small group of friends, some of who have lived the vanilla experience given to us in 2004, some of us haven’t. Some of us hardcore, some are not.
---
Yet the main goal for all of us is the same. This is a game we are super excited about launch and simply put can’t wait for the fun times ahead. We are a group of adults, 
---
from each corner of Europe. We love banter and a good atmosphere.
---
Guild reputation is important to us. So, whether your jam is smashing skulls in AV, grinding Timbermaw rep or competing with us in end game content, Nebula would be happy to host your stay. We also foster a very active Discord which has grown steadily along with the build up towards launch in August!
---
Our philosophy is: **For the guild, not a person.**
---
**Our Goals:**
---
Straight up raiding. Our ranks include many highly experienced players who have spent 14 years raiding on wow. Our raiding environment will be serious, yet positive and enthusiastic. 
---
If raiding isn’t your jam, our ranks also include many socials/ pvpers who are here for ride! 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday + Thursday + Sunday 18:30 - 22:30 BST (or 19:30 - 23:30 EU server time). 
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Recruitment has been very positive as we inch towards launch. We still have slots for the following specs:
---
Mage x 4
---
Resto Druid x 1
---
Warlock x 1
---
Rogue x 1
---
DPS Warrior x 1
---
**Application:**
---
Please apply via this link: https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnNEavPo4j?i=x4oZnqGA.
---
Or contact Shane#2310, Zyepox#1969, Ethario#1412 or Nakkie#3039 on Discord.
---

Why is horde better in pug PvP?
---
If you guys haven't checked out Hurricane on YouTube, nake sure you look at his other work. The guy made these for pservers, and around the time Nost was shut down Blizz scooped this guy up if I'm not mistaken.
---
Same thing happened to me earlier last week. 
---
But im not retarded so i checked my email to see if i actually got and invite and also i checked the internet for other information. 
---
I say ”retarded” in a loving and friendly way, sir.
---
Remembering back it was def Ion on one of the QandA's where they were talking about warmodes one-sidedness
---
Except on high pop servers there's always people leveling and so you'll have competition the whole way (as well as higher levels ganking you) and you can never out level it no matter how fast you level.
---
Ask for a refund
---
Layering whiners? Lol, you are an idiot if you think that addressing the biggest issue is whining...
---
Its good because thats how Classic was.
---
**&lt;The Dazzle&gt;**
---
**Loot System:**  Loot List / Loot Council. Brief explanation- All guild members will  create a small list of items they want from each raid, rating each item  as they wish (This is a one time list, created before the first guild  raid). A master list will be created and sorted by each individual's  rating multiplied by their attendance %. Each time an item drops, the  member at the top of the list will be asked if they want the item. If an  item drops and the list is empty, it will be distributed via the Loot  Council. Direct Message me for more details.
---
**Raid Times:**  Monday, Wednesday 7-10 CST. The raid will stop at 10:30, guaranteed.  The first official guild raid will be scheduled in late October or early  November to give our members \~2 months to reach level 60.
---
**About Us:** Casual/Semi-Hardcore is subjective, so let me break it down for you.
---
* We  are a new guild (20 members) that is focused on PvE progression. PvP is  welcome and encouraged, but the guild's priority will be raiding. Drama  will not be tolerated. Age doesn't matter, as long as you act like a  mature adult. We plan on experiencing all of the content, even if it is  at a slower pace than others.
---
* If  you are a working adult or a student that wants to continue to focus on  your schooling, we may be the guild for you. We will not be pushing for  server firsts, demanding quick leveling times, or requiring  attendance/consumables.
---
* We  are only raiding two nights a week, so the raid will be built for the  best chance of success. Attendance/BiS Gear/Consumables may not be  required, but they will be considered when building the raid and  distributing loot.
---
**What We Provide:**
---
* Experienced leadership. Our raid leaders cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx (Up to 4 Horsemen) before TBC released.
---
* A  relaxed and mature environment. Jokes, memes, and rippin' on each other  in good faith are fair game. Racism and the like will not be tolerated.
---
* Guild first mentality. There will be a lot of dungeon grinding and quest help
---
* Our discord will be full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, raiding, professions, add-ons, etc..
---
**What We Expect From You:**
---
* Mature  attitude. Be willing to help others without being condescending. Be  willing to receive criticism so you can learn and make the guild  stronger.
---
* Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* Discord  - you are not required to be vocal, but it is expected that you are  listening to the raid leaders and responding if necessary.
---
* When  it is raid night, we expect you to be there on time, with the proper  PvE spec, knowledge of the fights, and a mature attitude.
---
* Loot isn't your first priority. Loot comes slowly in classic, the success of the guild will provide loot for everyone.
---
**Class needs**
---
We are recruiting all classes (meta specs) at this point. We have our main tank(s), but would love another warrior or two that want to off tank when necessary.
---
If you are interested, please feel free to message me. I will respond as soon as I can.

Unbalance is why people play MMO's

That sounds like a Blizzard answer.

How the fuck do you get to 60 in 3 days? Did you not sleep or was it some scuffed private server?
---
What do you hate more: male night elves or undead rogues?
---
Will of the Forsaken baby
---
Well, unless you can take the week off from working, it's not going to matter that much. I get why they're opening servers on weekdays but wish they'd launch on the weekend.
---
You are not alone.  Half the fun of WSG was the hide-and-seek during a tie 1/1 or 2/2 capture. 
---
/lay in the alliance base, as horde, always worked.
---
My favorite spot was on their ramp inside, or going out their castle door to the left, there was a small hill next to their wall.
---
It's vanilla wow I did 20 levels a day with minimal effort, even my friend who had never played before was at the same speed

**Recruiting all classes &amp; specs (except for MT)**  
---
**Raid Schedule:** two days \[1\]main raid Sunday 8-10:30pm \[2\]progression raid Wed. 7-10:30pm EST

---
**Intro:** The foundation of AP is a group of friends that love video games, raunchy banter, and cannot wait for Classic’s release! Welcoming everyone – from the most experienced to ‘I’ve never played WoW before’. While we will be progressive in PvE content, it will be at our pace (we all have lives: careers, families, school, etc.). Will also have scheduled WPvP &amp; BGs events - because who doesn’t enjoy killing gnomes.   
---
**Expectations:** For any member it is to have fun and enjoy the game! Aimed at those that wish to raid, the expectation is to meet the raid schedule, come prepared with BiS/pots, and know the fights (or at least do some research beforehand).  If any questions, feel free to PM me!

Well, its not like they were bug free in vanilla either ...
---
I alone have created 11 chars on the beta servers. 6 of them is above lvl 10 and 4 is above lvl 20. A lot of people ive spoken with have done the same.
---
Were these named after Kevin Jordan too???
---
You played yourself.  
---
GG
---
I feel exactly the same except I don't play retail. I'm also switching from melee to caster. I've planned out what race and class to play and what professions, alts, talents, addons to use but I still think about classic every day.
---
Can't wait, it's going to be fucking awesome.
---
Had you only checked Reddit I'm sure you would have seen this posted once every 10 minutes lol
---
refund asap, just lousy attempts from activision to milk more money
---
You didn’t get scammed, 100% your own fault
---
it saves you the hassle juggling group leader or getting the leader to invite charname which can be handy if they are in fact chárnámé or have a very long name or something similar. 
---
its a pretty minor convenience but its convenient in a very pleasing way
---
I had a e girl friend in wow with 14 lol
---
I believe most are scared they will just fuck it up.
---
Zyzz was not a bodybuilder and a total asshat who only made the bodybuilding image negative. Anyone who thinks going out partying and doing a boat load of coke with a combination of steroids is completely stupid... And for the amount of gear this guy was banging his physique was dogshit.
---
He's nothing more than a meme. No half decent gym goer was ever inspired by him let's be real
---
Vanilla is recreated in the current engine under the name Classic WoW  
---
The specs are as it should be, as this will be a recreation of Vanilla WoW  
---
Changing or patching this, is Post Vanilla.  
---
So either we get TBC or ClassicWoW plus ( /r/classicwowplus ) and im in for both options tbh
---
The biggest issue?  ROFL!!!  No, not even close.  It's irrelevant.   You missing out on a couple ganks in the first 2 months won't do shit to the game.
---
World buff stacking exploit will destroy the pve aspect of the game.  That's the biggest issue atm.
---
1-20 doesn't take the same time as 40-60. Also the amount of time it takes to walk through zones is pretty significant. Unless you power leveled somehow I find this highly unlikely
---
more like 20-30%
---
Ahead of what curve? There's plenty of coke head party goers who take a bit of gear, you ever been in a gym?
---
Source?
---
I believe a ton of the people who demands the exact same game are gonna be miserable once they play it. There can never be 100% balance but some classes are outright useless and possibly barely playable with extreme effort.
---
Dude idk if any of you care but city of heroes has an insanely populated private server that sprang up 2 months ago ive been killing time on there having a blast while i wait
---
How the fuck could you put the deadwind pass at the top?
---
&gt;Males NEs hunters I hate the most.
---
We all do - if only for those 1000+ variations on the name "Legolas".
---
Embrace the inner waveness.
---
I used to have dreams about that place. It's haunting.
---
Not even the roids it was the copious abouts of coke combined with roids.
---
If you take roids at least try and cater to your health as best as you can
---
Easy you just have to have people run to azshara with the quest items to get the douses and then summon them back just need to have a few dedicated people grind a bit of rep before then
---
You will be invited to raids when people become desperate in filling those 40 slots
---
On Youtube just type classic wow, there is tons of tips etc for You.
---
Regards
---
Lots of things can happen in 5 seconds also fear goes on DR and wont last that long next time.
---
From where I come we generally use green=good and red=bad but you do you
---
I couldn't have said it better. One thing to point out is the average age of a male player in 2005 was 28 and female player was 32 (http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001365.php). I am sure the average age is going to settle slightly higher, but I would be surprised if it's over 30.
---
I haven't missed them, I'm here every day. They just are so infrequent they aren't noticeable.
---
This is a question that should not be asked, much less answered. Part of the charm is the mystery.
---
Kindof glad to see eleven and westfsll st the bottom only zones I really got to deal with alliance side during the stress trst
---
you won't be in crowded zones dude, unless you're in northshire or something the zone will have 2 other people max, theres like 40 people per layer and that layer spans your entire continent. and the amount of people drops dramatically per zone by the time you're in westfall there is no one around you, no one at the quest givers, no one killing harvesters, no one killing knolls, or defias no one. its a dead zone.
---
Why do you put Elwynn forest at the bottom? Come on man, didn't you know goldshire is in Elwynn forest?
---
Deadwind pass amazing and westfall bad? Lol
---
I dont think thats a wise option since to lvl up it takes ages
---
Wait for it
---
Honestly it amazes me how much people remember, I was about 14ish, I remember pretty much nothing of my initial WoW experience other than the odd "snapshot" like parts of Molten Core on my Gnome Mage or running through Duskwood on my NE Priest (my first character but I soon played something else).
---
Have you tried playing on oceanic servers? Although latency could be a big issue. Hopefully classic brings back a ton of people in Taiwan
---
Working as intended. :D
---
Those people tend to pull away, but there are some lulls in quests, unless you're going to go start a new zone full of green quests, again running into more people.
---
So you either grind yellow/orange mobs to bridge the gap, or run into people in a similar level zone.
---
My man
---
Trying to. Just recently came back to WoW after a 2 year break. I have a lot of catching up to do.
---
/thread
---
Get tailoring and grind some cloth. Ez. Also sell those for the mad profit
---
But if theres no other top tier guild who even cares? If they're the only ones capable of raiding AQ then they're only hurting themselves
---
well your biggest counter are Rogues and there is simply nothing you can do as a W-lock when that Rogue is also undead.
---
Given equal player-skill.
---
Shoulda mentioned soulkeeper was an alternative for the other two.
---
I hardly remember much from my first time round and looking back I feel like I was such a noob, I want to re-live the experience with more knowledge and a more mature mind and basically play better, although my time is more limited I feel like I could give it a way better go this time around.
---
Damn, I did not even play on Frostwolf but I remember those guilds because there was so much bitching on the forums about them. Crazy!
---
This is way too ideal. This is fresh layer leveling. You will have way more competition than this.
---
I am way more scared of the 39 twink enhancement shaman with this bad boy. I have seen them one shot level 6's from a WF proc.
---
I can't change the color on that site.
---
Yeah, just a friendly elbow strike in the ribs to fellow ennemies, nothing more, but many people are on edge lately. I mean, I played Alliance myself on Rp/PVP servers back in Tol'Barad and I loved it  
---
People can't take a grin these day ;)
---
Damn this is news to me. I’ll definitely buy a mount depending on how close we are to phase 2 when I hit 60. 
---
Will we still be able to get level 40 quest mounts
---
This \^
---
If you really have nothing pushing you either way then let someone else make the decision for you.
---
What is reasons to bubble hearth for 1000, Alex?
---
I'd probably say class balance although it isn't listed. I hate retail where every class is the same. I did play Vanilla as a rogue, so at the time I didn't really pay attention to what was viable and wasnt. In TBC everything was viable tbh. You could almost play whatever you wanted. As of right now I'm basically between Hunter and Spriest, and Spriest isn't really even viable. Hunter is mediocre.
---
In TBC I would probably play Enhancement Shaman, Feral Tank, or Shadow Priest. Just having more options would be much more enjoyable. But, I will still have fun either way.

**&amp;lt;Incarnation&gt;** Alliance **|** NA-PvP **|** Hardcore
---
Raid Times: M TU W 7-10pm PST
---
System: Loot Council
---
Hi Everyone! Incarnation is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community.
---
We are a fresh guild, meaning that we do not have “core members” or “clicks” yet like many other guilds. Just because we are fresh does not mean we lack experience. We have a wide range of experience ranging from World competitive Naxxaramas clears in Vanilla WoW (14th), private server Naxxaramas clears, US server first endgame content of different expansions of WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including but not limited to rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 arena gladiators from various expansions and even pro gaming experience through various games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining.
---
We expect all our recruits to know their class, game mechanics and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic.
---
We are hardcore in the sense that we put a lot of time in preparation for the raid (farming consumables/pre-raid gear, knowing all boss mechanics) so that when we do zone in to a raid, we are fully prepared and ready to clear. We are raiding 3 hrs per day for only 3 days and not excessively long hours because we pride ourselves on using raid time efficiently.
---
**Goals:**
---
\-Build a positive and strong community.
---
\-Strive to effectively and efficiently utilize time invested in the game to be the top guild in the server.
---
Warlock x1

They aren’t unbalanced,
---
That’s just what people say when they aren’t very good
---
So your definition of fun is how you look?
---
Played a feral on private server, was able to tank and dps in raid up to naxx.  Was really fun, and the versatility of the role (being able to dps/tank at will, sometimes healing decursing, plenty of different thing to do in raid depending on the encounter or raid composition).
---
I hope they bring the BC class balance in sometime. I'd like to be a Moonkin for awhile.
---
Racials my dude
---
Shamans damage (Windfury totem) can be unpredictable and they can only dispell poison. If a fight isnt won in the burst - they have lost. 
---
Paladins Will still have mana when everyone else is OOM so the warriors Will keep going, They have a built in perma Skull of Inpending Doom with hand of sacrifice.  And they can bubbel -&gt; spam heal with no way of being stopped for 11seconds.  And paladins dispell poison AND Magic in 1 global. 
---
Like in anything. Organized Controll beats disorganised unpredictability every time. 
---
TLDR; 
---
Horde need to win in a burst window
---
Alliance needs to survive that burst and then they’ll win.
---
Why the fuck would you sub
---
So you think when we all leveled up our character and played the race we wanted, it wasn't a wise option?
---
for PvE you cant actually claim there is anything close to class balance tho?
---
FUCK LAYERING
---
Glad to have you back! I didn't answer because I saw some people already did. You'll have more than enough time to catch up until launch. Also make sure to make your character on the 13th of August. You won't be able to play but you can reserve a name and choose a realm at least
---
Wildly asymmetric balance is fun, homogeneous balance is not.  Currently Modern WoW has homogeneous balance, so that all the DPS specs have roughly similar 'engagement' in their rotations, and roughly similar DPS, and roughly similar utility.  Once people complained enough about unequal DPS (because people hate being low on meters) that got balanced, but then utility had to be balanced too, and it 'wasnt fair' when a single-button DPS spec could do similar damage to a complex rotation spec, so they had to make them all equally complicated.
---
Classic is more fun because even though it's less balanced, it's intended to be asymmetrically balanced.  That is, Ret/Moonkin/Ele weren't intended to do as much DPS as a pure DPS class, but they were *supposed* to bring enough utility to whatever they were doing that they would be equally in demand (even though they mostly failed at giving enough utility to do that).
---
If they decide to add more content to Classic in the future (be it more lvl 60 or TBC or a new expansion) I really hope they're able to preserve that philosophy, even though it's much more difficult for the developers to manage.  So rather than straight DPS buffs, I hope that hybrid classes get literally anything else that makes them more useful in raids (something like a group-wide innervate talent in Moonkin tree, additional support totem options in the Ele/Enh trees, and maybe a group-wide damage/defense CD in the Ret tree).
---
It is on the list :-) Just listed as specilization viablity. Since perfect balance is not really good for the game, as you say so yourself. However, making every spec viable is great.
---
Yeah this is true lol. Just wait till Mc is on farm and you can bring your boomkin!
---
Are you unable to read 2 posts worth of context or did you just scan through looking for an argument?
---
"I don't agree with your stance so you're not allowed to say it"
---
Hunter - 
---
* the current state of beta shows they are FUBAR, something like 50 or so different bugs are reported already
---
* pet management in dungeons are a clusterfuck with the retard pathing AI
---
* ammo can be annoying and you have to keep more anyway, because the max DPS thorium ammo is expensive and you don't want it on trash
---
* even the old deadzone could fuck you over, let alone the new one, PvP seems to be out of question for us unless it's spamming arcane shot from may range in AV
---
* even the bread vendor girl in Ironforge is more respected than you
---
* hunters are the worst scaling class in game, by the time you get to AQ40 people will only bring you because tranq shot and because they like you as a player but not the class you play
---
* you can't roll on any DPS accessories because it'll go to rogues, warriors, whatever, before it goes to you
---
* you can't roll on any weapons without being called out
---
Heretic!
---
Everyone that participates in the online bodybuilding community knows who Zyzz is.
---
Whichever faction I roll will have advantage. Why ? Because I'm that good.
---
I was an officer in &lt;Perfect Dark x&gt; on Deathwing EU and i remember your guild :)
---
I was later on in &lt;Precious&gt; on Deathwing untill free transfers to Tarren Mill opened up and i migrated there to join &lt;Ace of Spades&gt;.
---
Good times!
---
lol because night elf male
---
AQ20 was easy to raid by guilds who hadn't cleared BWL yet.
---
For me its  way less obvious, like a milder version of it. I could be wrong but for me it was night and day, then again I haven't played retail in a long time
---
I'm rolling a pally when classic is released and I cannot wait for this. It's the kind of stuff that really ties you to a character. You feel as though you've been on a journey together.
---
The steroids weren't necessarily the problem.  Combining them with coke and other bad life decisions is what did him in.
---
Yes? This literally happened. What else could you possibly describe the burning of Tel'drassil as?
---
Even if you waive it off as not the intended outcome, the only orc who shows any remorse whatsoever is the dude who planned the entire invasion and he was cool with invading the Elves just not killing them ALL! 
---
Literally every other Orc has not expressed so much as a hint of self-reflection.
---
This is why BFA is so fucking dumb, it made it factually impossible to defend the "new" Horde as anything different from the old. Fuck, even the old Horde had them regretting their actions afterwards, now they don't even spare it a thought. They've actually gotten worse!
---
I get this a Classic sub so people aren't as likely to be following retail but this literally was used to sell the expansion. How can so many people express this "new Horde not Old, they're still good guys" view and know this?
---
I either jump or RP walk
---
I am seriously considering starting a guild called 'gaming geezers'. I mean it.
---
Wow was about as popular to the mainstream in 2005 as leg warmers in 2019
---
As for popularity in 2019, I hope it becomes popular at least for a bit, we need some slower paced mmorpgs back on the market
---
Well i would think that some other guild would just go do the quest line and get their own sceptre and open the gates.
---
Why go through all the trouble of ganking them.
---
Don't forget to stand and stretch often! Blood clots are serious...
---
Well hold on, you're ignoring your own distinction here. What is class balance and what is spec balance? You're asking for spec balance, yet we already have class balance because literally every class has raid spots, just not every spec and role that class can do.
---
You wanting to be a Ret Paladin doesn't mean Paladins as a class are unbalanced. More importantly how would this impact PVP if a Ret could do as much damage as a pure DPS class and heal and bubble and offer group utility. You're not even consistent in what you're asking for and have ignored an incredibly important part of the game.
---
&gt; I joined a guild (RIP Pinkslips), I ran (really badly) dungeons, I culled an unspeakable amounts of boars, bats, wolves, dragons, bears. I developed a wall street like mind at the auction house and rejoiced at every single overpriced transaction that was paid to me. I formed friendships that have lasted even to this day. Every day I logged in to that game (nay WORLD), I felt at home. I knew the people there and it became a comfortable space where I looked forward spending time. 
---
This part of your post really hits home. I feel you entirely fella. All of that, and thensome, very much put the World in Warcraft. Much love, and let's hope it's the same way the second time around, albeit without the horrendous queue each day.
---
"When everyone is super no one will be".
---
Rather then having everyone be equal we should celebrate individual strengths and abilities. 
---
So with this in mind you get a downdoot sorry.
---
I have been out of the classic loop. I did play vanilla back on release and am considering coming back for this, are there any changes to the game or is it 100% the same front end? What about PvP instances etc? One of the things I wasn’t huge on with OG WoW was it I wanted to hop on for just a hour and do a instance or get some PvP in a lot of times it wasn’t feasible until the first expansion (if memory serves me right).
---
&gt; try them out and play the game for what it's supposed to be
---
i read this part
---
You're dumb for that, man, if this is what is going to be populating classic 2.0, it's going to be so easy making gold
---
Why on earth would you assume they gave you classic, beta, or anything like that when you should be aware it "requires" a sub in the first place, dork
---
you got scammed by your own stupidity
---
I should have kept to spec balance my bad. I agree class balance is ok spec is not
---
I played a private server to level 10 on a race and class I don't intend to play for awhile in classic. In my case, gnome mage. It helped a lot. I went back and got it to level 12 a week later, but knowing itll be pointless since classic is out soon turned me off it. It scratched that itch though.
---
Enjoy buffing the entire raid every 5 minutes (or 15 with a fuckload of reagents).
---
I think OP's point is that a majority of players will be leveling up and working toward raiding. Yes, there will be tryhards at the top ahead of everyone. But there will also be tons of people leveling up their new mains. That's an exciting feeling for a new server.
---
Good, that was an important part. I don't mean level all to 60, play around with them, look at casting animations, melee, whatever matters the most to you. Chances are you can see it all within the first few levels, same with racials.
---
Cause you probably don't want to pick something based on other people and come level 40 or 50 you get sick of looking at it, a lot of time invested into a mistake
---
true
---
I used to watch faxmonkey too lol. I mainly remember his DM north farm.  Now imma have to rewatch whatever made it to YouTube. There’s a ton of old WoW videos that were uploaded to google videos that never got reuploaded that I miss watching :(
---
Teld and Mulg not in S-tier? Shit opinion.

---
* **Semi-hardcore | PvE &amp; World PvP**
---
&gt;The Kor Kron Vanguard is an experienced World-PvP and PvE guild returning to Classic WoW.
---
ℹ️ **Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
&gt; We are able to integrate both casuals and semi-hardcore individuals within our ranks.
---
👀 **What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
🎯 **What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
&gt;We have been refining our methods to bring you the best possible experience of open world PvP. No previous experience required.
---
❓ **What we expect of members:**
---
* As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire  to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.

You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
📅 **Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not to be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1 (CET/CEST).

I keep seeing the addon on recent videos, any idea what it's called?
---
I wanna be a rogue with healing powers- fuck first aid.
---
I usually play in the evening so it's usually dark  but it is so refreshing to play in the morning or kid day but working people will always have that kind of problem.
---
More of class x in a raid means more people want to play it. It balances out surprisingly well.
---
I am looking for a guild that won't be using the World buff stacking exploit.   It's a cheat, and I don't want to trivialize the pve aspect of the game.   Faction doesn't matter.  I am thinking Feral Tank druid, or maybe hunter, though I am not 100% certain.
---
Mass-appeal was never a sure sign for excellence.
---
The thing WoW achieved was getting people to play a game that would otherwise never touch a game. They managed to make mmorpgs a possible leisure activity for people that would otherwise watch Giligans Island or Wheel of Fortune. 
---
The only thing that can be said about such a product is, that, on top of everything else, it must be trivial.
---
They fixed retail nighttime during legion. It’s noticeable. Just as dark as it was during vanilla.
---
mulgore(or orc/troll starting zone) -&gt; barrens -&gt; stonetalon mountains -&gt; ashenvale -&gt; desolace?arathibasin?badlands?1000needles? -&gt; tanaris?Ferelas?Unguro?Felwood -&gt; Silithus?Winterspring?Eastern/WesternPlaguelands to unlock the lvl 60 dungeons (like the scholomance key)?  
---
alternate for alts maybe ...
---
too bad it’ll look nothing like this cause of layering...
---
What because boomkin doesn’t do as much dps as a fury warrior? The game wasn’t designed for everyone to be capable of doing the same exact things. 
---
Its designed to give each class a role, and for each group to have a demand for each roll.  If it was perfectly balanced you would be able to raid with 40 warriors.
---
Also the meta isn’t something you have to follow. If you want to make a guild and bring a few boomkin or ret paladins, then do it, it’s not like you can’t clear content with them. You need to look more at what each class can do, not what they can’t.
---
That is ebon mask the ST rogue mask, boots look like the ones off the princess in BRD. You cant see your chest because of shirt and tabard.
---
...a game can be successful without it being its peak. 
---
Without vanillas success there would be no tbc or wotlk, aka the golden age of wow.
---
Yeah but i dont want to grind a job without my journeyman backpacks.
---
And i usually go for herbalism for cash.
---
Goal in every vanilla gameplay is to have 3 journeymans before lvl 21 and a soulbag.
---
Both factions will have hardcore guilds. Don't play a faction you deep down don't enjoy so you can raid cause it'll bite you in the ass.
---
sorry that a drawing had to interrupt your 24/7 flow of layerposting
---
Awful lol
---
I dont think hybrids should out DPS pure DPS classes.  But atleast they could have mana sustain?
---
I mean at least you'll finally finish the bed quest
---
Essay time...
---
So I'm rolling Alliance and thought I was dead set on **Paladin** but I just tried leveling one up and was extremely bored with the play style by level 13. I still felt pretty weak even though I had some decent gear for my level. Plus the whole ret/prot being bad in raids thing has put me off too. Bah.
---
**Warlock** and **Hunter** sound great but I'm playing alliance so warlock is kinda eh given how many people play undead and hunters are cool but I hear they're not particularly demanded for raids plus I'd feel forced to play a female character because NE males are so awful looking. Shadowmeld is too strong/fun to pass for Dwarves. Might level one as a farming alt or something.
---
Back to Warlocks, I'd have to roll a human because I don't like gnomes and human male casters don't look fitting so I'd feel forced to roll female which is something I'd rather not do, at least for my main character.
---
**Warriors** are a no go for me, I don't fancy tanking or the rough leveling experience. They'd make a fun alt when I can transfer it gold/enchants/gear though. The same goes for **Rogues**, I figure they'd be a lot more fun to level once I'm already 60 with another class. Plus I want to be a class which is sought after for raids and quick to gear which rogues aren't particularly due to how many will be playing the class. My irl work schedule means I will only be able to raid every other week.
---
**Priests** are definitely a viable choice, they're great levelers (when they get a wand) and will always be wanted by any guild. I'd roll a dwarf male most likely due to fear ward and their animations are great plus I'd never have an issue being invited to raids or PvP events but I'm not sure how much I want to be stuck healing. It's something I need to think about. They can AoE farm DM lashers and low level dungeons once decently geared and partner up to run duo DM farming which is handy for fueling alts. Shadow priests are great in PvP too. I have a soft spot for shadow spec, it's just a shame they're not super viable in raiding.
---
**Druids**, just not interested in shape shifting at all. Plus if I was to heal I would just roll a priest instead.
---
**Mages** are probably the best class in the game on paper. They can solo farm tons of places and have some of the best DPS in the game, have a high PvP skill ceiling, can conjure food/water and teleport. However I'm not a fan of being squishy and I would likely have to roll gnome because 5% int and escape artist are too good to pass up. I think in the right hands a mage can be very powerful but I don't particularly like their play-style especially when leveling.
---
So basically I need to figure out whether I want to heal or DPS. Yes to healing means Priest, no likely means a Mage and suck it up.
---
Or make them create language specific servers for countries that tend to not want to speak english.
---
By chance do you mean PVP?
---
i don’t want to sound like a shill but you’re paying for a subscription you’re going to be paying for two weeks later anyway.
---
Everyone wants "somechanges" if they have ever played the game, but the effects of "somechanges" is often way bigger than you imagine.
---
For instance you can say "just bring Arena to Classic, it won't affect anything" but it WILL. It will mean less BGs, it will mean less world PvP.
---
From a PvP perspective, a spec like Elemental Shaman is one of the strongest in the whole game. Just because it is not viable in Raiding, they should do what exactly to "fix balance"? Buff them to make them viable in PvE and now they are gods in PvP?
---
You say "there is still totally broken specs". How so? Garbage tier in what? Raiding? No specs in the game are useless. Sure some talents are not viable like Healing Well and Moonkin Form, but all trees has great talents. Some talent trees are "leveling trees" but that is OK. Some trees are PvP trees and that is OK too. Some specs are Raiding trees, and that is OK too (An SL/SL warlock (raid spec) is horrible in PvP for instance).
---
Classic is, by accident of random items and rock paper scissor, actually one of the most balanced instances of the game ever in PvP.
---
Blizzard has still to this date not been able to balance specs, 15 years later. What sort of brilliant patch notes do you have in mind to suddenly make 1.12 perfect for all aspects of the game (leveling, pvp, dungeons, raiding, solo grinding +++)?
---
On the other hand there are some changes most people would be OK with like adding systems to avoid BG dodging.
---
Do you guys not have language tutors ?
---
&gt;with our tabard being the muffin icon.
---
Horde, better players ...
---
How are druids second? Stealth means nothing for the class when it comes to griefing.
---
🦀🦀🦀$15🦀🦀🦀
---
Nah. Blizzard has been pretty good with servers for launches for the last few expos.
---
Yo I got a sick deal of moss agate for you
---
other people on the server can turn in the items as well
---
why tf would they get banned lol, you're the kind of player classic doesn't need, a retail care bear
---
WoW was only popular in 2005 due to the limitations in computer technology and limited games on the market. 
---
Great game, but todays age, theres too much shit saturated the market and with so many options available, it divides the playerbase. With all this pubg, fortnite, apex, etc. 
---
2005 was a simpler time. WoW was the first of it's kind minus runescape. And yet it's still the most successful mmo because it is well polished and not the China p2w animay-style shits
---
im all for nochanges, but how do these drastic changes sound? 
---
😐
---
I think some people were able to get some high raid shoulder enchants on boe whites to give to twinks. Better than talbar.
---
Sorry I don't have enough time in my 35 hours week ;-)
---
Nah, if you farm gnomeregan and put all the effort, you will be at around the same dps of top rogue (the question is, is it worth it ? For a few try hard that love it apparently yes but for most people no).
---
But even without farming the gnome mace, the dps is still decent as long as you powershift. I was mainly tanking with my feral but when i switched to dps gear, i wasn't last. And i have never farmed gnomeregan outside of a few time to see what difference the weapon would do.
---
TLDR: I want to feel like an adventurer in a world. Not a hero on my own.
---
Honestly I'm sick to death of some of the aspects of the current game and I want the sense of adventure that comes with the classic setup and difficulty.  
---
Simple things like one I noticed recently, while stealing the flames from capital cities, I had to keep speaking to Zidormi because there are multiple versions of that zone (Undercity for example). Because it is obviously easier from a dev perspective to leave the start zone or leveling zone intact and just instance out everyone else past that content. It really doesn't feel like a living world when I can just turn off the fact that sargeras stabbed the planet. Or the fact that Sylvanas wrecked Undercity. Instead of retiring that older content and developing a new narrative they just stick a switch on it. 
---
World of Warcraft shouldn't be a game where it tries to make me the hero and take me a on an adventure similar to games like Uncharted (masterpiece btw). I should write my own story. I was one of many who took down Rag, I was one adventurer that helped someone in a village somewhere and I was that guy that become a PVP warlord by my own choosing. Some of this has been recaptured in questing recently but it's still written like I'm the only one who can help. Nothing makes you feel like less of a hero than everyone telling you that you are a hero when I know very well that the two people beside me are doing and hearing the exact same thing.
---
Also fuck layering 😜
---
Not first day but first few weeks of launch... a rogue joined my guild that was a hubby/ wife team leveling the same char, they never told anyone they were duo'ing. 
---
Turns out the wife started cybering with some other guildies pretty much immediately. The husband kept getting weird whispers when he was on the character. One of the guys cybering the wife gave me gold for my mount ('a guild master should have a mount, pay me back later').  
---
Then of course the husband cottons on, shit goes down and all the cyberers gquit. Never had to pay back the shaman that gave me my mount gold, woot!
---
Thanks for explaining! I’ve never been much into PvP other than very casual battlegrounding, so hadn’t thought about this. Best time I had PvP:ing in vanilla was when I managed to gather a full-paladin team for a battleground. Never seen so much AFK-rotation by horde 😅
---
Did someone say OOGA GANG?
---

---
Help us take over the world!
---
Alliance for sure. They have much smoother leveling and are much better placed for raids. Plus the AV advantage later for farming AV more effectively.
---
Stuff like that is why I can't wrap my head around you lot wanting to play classic so bad. So many QoL improvements have been made over the years I can't imagine playing without. Totally excited FOR you guys though!
---
And your real name was Mankrik all along!
---
[Horde] [NA] [PVP]
---
I am looking for a guild that will be raiding early Saturday or Sunday mornings EST. Weekday raiding is possible for me if the raids end around 10:00pm EST or earlier. I will be playing Resto Shaman and have experience raiding as a healer in WotLK.
---
You'll be in Asseroth. 
---
But really missing the initial rush will be nice at least.
---
Australian’s playing WoW PvP (usually on Blackrock) had a special form of leeway..
---
Every enemy gets +5-10 yards on their moves while we get a -5 yard reduction on ours. Can’t wait to play the game on 60ms
---
So mad, so jelly.
---
Very informormative post and something I was looking for. You are a bit aggressive in your tone for no reason but you aint wrong. Peace.
---
&gt;Wildly asymmetric balance is fun
---
as long as you are one of the people on the top, eh warrior?
---
Why do people pretend like they know what they're talking about on here? 
---
If you e played Hunter you know multi shot isn't instant, can't cast while moving 
---
If anyone reads this be careful of misinformation on here already by people who don't even play the class they're talking about
---
Epic shit nostalgia had be build one in BFA 😂
---
atleast -1023%
---
The persistent community is so much of the experience though.
---
Delusional
---
R/titlegore
---
If you don't care about this guy, why share his video?
---
As someone that has experienced burnout, this is 100% on the company not providing resources necessary to do the job. Burnout should never happen. If someone is burning out at their job, leave immediately. Your employer doesn't care about you.
---
Yeah world record is like 4.5 days played and thats after Joanna already had alts and tons of speed runs. I doubt many people will get close to 5 days played if any
---
My proffessional estimate is a chance of 37,2%, but who knows. 
---
I will play Classic anyways.
---
It’s the same game it’s like comparing any two expansion eras
---
Exactly, it is a matter of perception. 
---
It is really hard to measure coders work, sometimes a really productive move is to replace thousands of badly thought out lines of code by a few dozens really well crafted one. 
---
But as a manager if you make them work 16 hours a day, your bosses can't accuse you of not doing everything to make the project succeed (discounting the increase in bugs and shitty code that becomes technical debt as soon as it's written).
---
Very unlikely. If a couple weeks to a couple months of layering means you’ll never play the game then the game probably isn’t for you.
---
Yeah they are quite low...
---
Why would they either? It is actually a great solution to the Problem. If People wouldn't find every single way to abuse this System...
---
I just hope everyone abusing it gets an insta ban forever :)
---
Oh dear lord I really hope I don't have to play with crybabies like you when classic is out
---
That's easy to say when you are the super one... Holy shit...
---
&gt; By the time when and if they remove it, all servers are already affected 
---
I don't understand why you think that.  
---
Just join  2 month later, nothing will feel different.
---
Can Layering be abused - hell yeah.
---
Should it only affect the starter area's - YES 100 %, or else IMHO it would ruin the gameplay
---
Seems like its time for paladins to rise.
---
People mostly. Hangin with folks, working on shared goals, getting local...giving a shit how things work out. Retail for me is generic, quiet and seems more like a solo game with guest stars than a mmo outside of bg’s/arena’s. 
---
Much of this has to do with me and how I play. I know the things I like about the old game are still present but the way to get to them has changed and requires a lot more work and active participation to access. I don’t have the free time to invest to get those things in retail but they come free of charge in classic. This is the main reason.
---
 Other than that, I like the sense of danger. You aren’t Superman and you need to mostly be awake while leveling. Professions having a real reason to exist is cool. I like the old setting as it felt more immersive but that may just have been because we spent more time moving through it,
---
And finally......no one calls you Champion.
---
Yes it is - which makes is sad. 
---
But a lot of People said already that they kept Meeting the same People over and over in the beta so there is some Kind of System one would hope :P
---
Also it will be removed after 2-3 month so we will all be fine in the end at least :)
---
The reason is pvp. How can I have fun if the lowbies I want to one shot can just escape from me. 
---
Its honestly amazingly toxic.
---
Then that can be traded.
---
The cake is a lie!
---
Runs just fine on my work Dell Latitude. Intel integrated graphics, 8gigs RAM, i7.
---
Also my favorite.
---
It's because it's a classic sub. Everything that happenend after vanilla is non-canon in the minds of most people
---
The highest dps warlock spec is DS/ruin which is mostly demo(until demonic sacrifice hence DS) and a bit of destro(until Ruin) . Also dot dmg isn't great for raiding because of the limited number of debuffs you can put on a target. Get outta here with that fake news
---
Dont ban the memes.. I dislike subreddits that are too harsh on the memes, they become boring and lose interest fast.
---
This place has had some really good discussions, and most of the memes put a smile on my face, especially after a long day at work.
---
But yes, the retail vs classic hate needs to stop. The jokes are fine but some people go too overboard and it becomes pure hating just for the sake of hating.
---
Not in Vanilla it ain't, that would be an awful experience. Tank is constantly oom, there's no taunt, almost zero ranged DPS :/
---
&gt;Its designed t
---
It wasn't designed to do shit...  The devs clearly didn't have a fucking clue, and just pulled shit out of their ass on the fly.  The chips just sort of fell where they fell.
---
Not sure if ALL of those were fixed in 1.12, but I know mass majority of it was taken care of at the very least. I am not about to dig through patch notes though. I loved it when random Dragons showed up in Org though. Good times. Same with Hunters dismissing, and summoning their pet in Org when it had that nasty ZG disease.
---
Zero, they don't want empty servers a few weeks/months after launch and layering will fix that.
---
I like to think that word of a director of a project of a multi-billion company means something. But yea we'll see.

The actually thread is awesome, the guild talks about wanting a legacy - people saying “noone will remember X wow guild for doing Y”  And here we are 10 years later talking about it.
---
You should def launch a kickstarter. I won’t donate money to it, cuz it’s dumb. But do it anyway.
---
&gt; Uhhh, didn't you just disprove your own ridiculous claim that the game was balanced.
---
I think that in your rush to argue with me you somehow thought I said that Classic was balanced, when I specifically said that it isn't.  Everything I said above was in support of the idea that, when balance passes come for future content, that they avoid the homogeneous balance seen in Modern WoW and try to more successfully implement the asymmetric balance they tried to achieve in Vanilla.
---
I am ready to play because classic is the best feeling wow and all my boys are going to be playing so again it will be Me And The Boys!
---
You mirin?
---
logging queue
---
i know people are kind of joking, but our guild was one of the first 'late night raiding' guilds. we started later in the evening and finished around 11pm. this let us get all the older guys who had families and work to sort out before sitting down to play for the night. This set us apart from the EU hardcore raiding guilds that were starting around 6pm and meant we had a decent share of very capable players that just couldnt raid with other guilds.
---
They actually didn’t do anything wrong, the first responses were pretty on point - if you have a problem with it go and get the scepter.. oh wait you can’t? Well time to decide whats easier, gold or the scepter.
---
I'd like to add that a spec not being the optimal for pve dps doesn't mean it's utterly broken.
---
Ret, balance and ele for example are all viable in pvp. Shadow is arguably the strongest of all specs in 1v1. You dont call arms broken just because fury is the better dps spec.
---
Most specs work in atleast one aspect of the game.
---
They can release the game whenever they so desire, there is a reason behind the date. Summer vacation is over, it is inside of a work week, why would this be?????
---
Well big boy, it is to keep the allure of the game, keep you playing for some hours and then having to go back to your responsibilities, teasing you and keeping your mind on the game the whole work day, then when you get back home you cant wait for more gaming, and you certainly cant wait for the weekends to come around. THis will make ppl even more addicted, constrant teasing and HTG.
---
The Stress Test last week helped scratch the itch for me. I've also got the FFXIV Shadowbringers expansion coming out on Friday to help tide me over until Classic releases.
---
Already found me an old guy guild.  Nice real life expectations leveling speed and dad with job raiding hours.
---
keep sucking their dick, i dont care
---
lock casts curse of weakness
---
troll priest casts hex of weakness
---
undead priests casts touch of weakness
---
warrior uses demo shout
---
at that point all he has is a lot of health but hardly any dmg as the debuffs apply to both weapons. his dmg is gonna feel like a greenie or less.
---
Female Orc Shaman dual-wielding daggers. 
---
Female Orc Hunter/Tracker range-melee hybrid.
---
Female Night Elf Druid with feral cat actually being useful in PvP, rather than phatass boring bear auto attack and/or dot kiting.
---
Better looking Tauren. My dirtiest fantasy.
---
&gt;Starting a sentence with yikes
---
 Thats an oof from me dawg.
---
&gt; had that nasty ZG disease. 
---
Funny but that one, and the spell from Mayor Domo (?) has been patched, so you couldnt do that anymore with pets.  
---
Some server had to under go a backroll, to clean up that nast ZG disease :D
---
Why are you even on this subreddit if you hate them zo much, boycott them?
---
You seem very angry, who hurt you?
---
&gt; other people on the server can turn in the items as well 
---
What does that have to do with anything?  If another guild can unlock the gates, the problem doesn't exist in the first place.
---
&gt; why tf would they get banned
---
The scumbag guild demanding gold would get banned.  It's not about refusing to open the gates, it's their prerogative to do that whenever they like since they put the work in to completing the quest, but the whole server has to contribute in order for them to even start that grind.  It's a global effort, and demanding payment for it is wrong IMO.  The punishment should fit the crime and if they want to deny a whole server access to content, I'd be quite happy to deny them access to the rewards.
---
&gt; you're the kind of player classic doesn't need: a retail crybaby 
---
I believe that scummy behaviour like this creates a poor experience for everyone if it's left unpunished.  Your own reply and the other downvotes I'm getting are a clear indication that I'm in the minority, but I can handle that.  I'm not crying, unlike you.
---
Don't give geth any ideas, last time they asked "does this unit have a soul?" and the Homeworld was lost... Keelah se'lai.
---
Lately it's been frothing vitriolic hate with the layering and EU server debacles. Can't wait to see what opens up the next level of salt mine.
---
This movie was on last night and I must admit I watched the whole thing
---
Even on high population servers almost every leveling zone is completely empty. 
---
yes on occasion you can have some high-level people ganking you if you leave the PVP switch turned on but even then it's fairly rare
---
I started horde and switched alliance for BG queues on stress test.
---
Are you trying to say WoW and Runescape were the first MMOs? That line in your last paragraph confuses me
---
You have negative karma :(
---
charge, hamstring, use stance/weapon swap macro, bloodrage, demoshout thunderclap disarm etc. laugh at him trying to kill me
---
People just want their "team" to "win" and generally speaking will trash the other side to try and make their point. It doesn't serve any purpose, change anybody's mind or do any good. It does get your opinions validated though, which gets people in the cool kids club for whatever bubble they live in. Hopefully it gets better when everyone can play the game they want.
---
0%
---
I would love playing classic but yes, the layered version is not for me.
---
What do you think the chances are that they will fix the pathing mechanic that lets you solo half the bosses in Uldaman?
---
This guy has had a bad experience with a nelf he thought was female.
---
Executioners cleaver was a better weapon for horde 49s.
---
Chances are low that they remove it before launch.  Depending on the population of servers, some servers will likely have layering removed faster than others (maybe weeks instead of months?).  If a server never gets to a low enough population that would allow them to remove layering, what do you think they will do?  So some servers might be stuck with layering for quite a while.  Might be best to wait a few weeks and see how server pop pans out if you do not want to play with layering.

# &lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST
---
**INTRO:** This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. It does not matter if you are new to classic or a veteran, All I want are dedicated players willing to do what it takes to down bosses. If you can do this, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
\-week 3/4 MC clear
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
**RAID TIMES** \- EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST

I disagree, much closer to -1%.
---
So, no remove Trolls posts?
---
Amen brother!
---
Keep attacking him from behind because he's probably a keyboard turner
---
i see this a lot and i kind of want to stress this as someone who made a shit tonne of groups for heroics in tbc. dungeon finder does nothing different to what i did it takes the first 3 dps first tank and first healer it can find.   
---
wrath dungeons didn't have lfd but were made so easy by a combination of things tanks being over tuned and easy threat machines mostly, so were turned into aoe fests that just ruined dungeons, at the end of wrath lfd came out changed nothing except waiting around making groups wasn't a thing anymore, then cata dropped with hard dungeons again with cc requrements and all the players used to wrath dungeons did a shit and pissed and moaned on the forums it had little to do with lfd. lfr is a whole other realm of stupid but lfd is not an issue really its not.
---
wait till this guy gets to stv
---
Because after the first few players discovered places like GM Island, blizz put these places basically on a separate instance. And to get there via new method involved minor forms of hacking the game.
---
You never got punished for walljumping and exploring places in the open world...as long as you weren't being dumb about it and safespotting or something.
---
WOW won't even be close to the most popular in 2019.
---
It was removed when they raised the level cap to 40 weeks ago.
---
- It's a solution to a very real problem for which Blizzard has no better remedy at the moment. 
---
- It an be abused, but mostly for PvP. Most players were on PvE realms historically, so be definition, layer-abuse can only affect a minority - even *IF* every single player on every single PvP realm was affected.
---
- Whatever issues here are will likely quickly disappear as the number of layers goes down and (hopefully quickly) approaches zero.
---
So, basically, the chances of layering never being implemented because it can be abused in world-PvP that does not have lasting consequences since there's no honor system while layering is active - are zero.
---
Alliance smoother leveling? 
---
I have to disagree with you.
---
Until lvl30 I probably prefer Alliance (really like wetlands and Duskwood), but 30+ horde does have better questhubs.
---
I love the idea of Shadowguard stunning out unsuspecting attackers
---
Think of classic like a chess game. Each peice serves its purpose for a more complex game style. Not everyone is equal, as it should be. That's true balance. 
---
Modern WoW is like checkers. It's boring. 
---
Hunters, pally, shaman, druid all shine in pvp while warriors, mages, locks, and priest shine in pve. Every class has it's own thing going for them. Boomkin are bad but they can still do some burst.

Bloodlust, windfury and mana tide totems are some of the big ones. Shaman have all the buttons. Seriously, your screen will be covered with spell icons in every slot. If you’re the kind of person that likes having a a reply to every question, well, here you go. The downside is that clutter often masquerades as complexity.

# &lt;MERCENARY&gt; - Horde | US-East | RP-PvP
---
Focus- Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, lowlifes and no-lifes. If blizard does not launch classic with RP-PvP realms we will be rolling on whatever PvP realm the community decides is the unofficial NA RP-PvP realm. *the PvP part is the most important part.* 
---
Schedule- Raid time currently projected for every other week, Mon and Tues from 1930-2300. This lets us hit two raid lockouts and get back to PvP, farming, and general tomfoolery for the rest of the week. 
---
Loot-DKP
---
Leadership- Last played retail in Cata. Adults with no tolerance for wasting the group's time
---
Membership- Seeking people with a goals-based mindset who want to be in Azeroth to escape the overbearing culture of politics and memery that has invaded all of the internet this past decade. It does not matter if you are a MAGApede, a Hilldawg, a Bernout, a Fascist or a Communist. Can you get out of range of Rain of Fire and press buttons in something resembling the correct order? Fantastic, you're hired. Total noobs are allowed. Although leadership has extensive experience in private servers, expecting everyone to have played technically illegal copies of a 15 year old game is a stretch.

Come on by and say hi
---
Small issues.... we just neeed to follow the light and it ll happen.
---
Throw the Mac in the bin and join the master race
---
I'm not joking. I'm eager to join a guild where people understand that being a dad means you won't be able to join every raid, where people know that some day you do what you have to do for your family and don't get kicked instantly for not being active enough.
---
That if your child needs comforting or your support, you drop the game and prioritize your kid. Too bad if it's in the middle of a raid. I play WoW for fun and to calm my nerves, not to become the greatest Pokémon master in history.
---
I've been declining every guild invite because I can't come on every day or be online at the same hours. I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
---
Everyone in WoW is rooting for you believe me!
---
Hey what about the undeads ? :o
---
Lol - so how do you feel about say, iPhones? If you use technology at all a lot of parts are built in a chinese factory that has suicide nets to prevent workers from jumping.
---
Its not slavery but its something.
---
I thought your honeymoon would be classic wow?
---
Abusers are a huge part of the problem for me, yes. If they can atleast fix that...
---
And crowded starting area's or launch servers..i mean at least they would be fair. On private servers its 10000 people for 1 boar aswell and its not that bad. I find layering worse
---
See how many active players blizzard had on the last expos
---
No, neither Krethis or a firerock keep their abilities once tamed.
---
Blizzard could actually make trailers like this since it includes relevant game play and not just unplayable heroes jumping around like an anime. I mean, yeah Blizzard makes beautiful trailers, but you can make hype trailers too using in game footage like this.
---
Frequencies were gradually improved but with WOD they overhauled the whole thing adding multiple loops for different actions whereas there was only one loop before. What we have now is essentially identical with the WOD system but the spell loops tick much less frequently. I love that you think you know things but you actually don’t.
---
Man, I was running my settings super high with a 5 year old laptop in the stress test and barely lagged at all... you might not worry so much on what/if it can run max settings and just pick what you feel is right or what you can save the most money on... Just my opinion though
---
Shut the fuck up and just don't talk if you just gonna say shit like that you dumb retarded fuck
---
Looks like the links to the Bnet posts are dead.. Anyone have a working link/ transcript?
---
Was weather effects in the game at launch? If I remember correctly those were implemented quite late in vanilla, but my memory isn’t what it used to be so don’t take my word for it.
---
Not sure whether the Tauren is male or female. Looks odd.
---
Except WoW was pretty dead in 2005. Shoulda been "2010 or 2020".
---
Those same laws and regulations lead to us outsourcing to third-world countries. Cheap labour + no health and safety regulations = cheapest goods - in a free market we have there is no way to compete with this kind of production.
---
Getting my first child 4 days before launch...
---
Well IF they remove it completely then maybe. I have trust issues with actiblizz tho. 
---
I have been looking forward to fresh server classic launch for ages and 2 months of layering kind of taints this
---
I started in 2006, I'll turn 50 (eww) 7 days before launch!
---
None of these things have an inpact for wPvP really
---
It's great for hamstring kiting, generating rage without hitting or getting hit
---
Seems like Im out of cake. Maybe next year Ive some for you
---
Horde because Orc

Rooting a mage thata about to aoe farm looks fun.
---
Escape Artist is insanely powerful and you’ll be using it so much. It’s arguably the most powerful alliance racial. Stoneform has its uses but it’s more situational and has a longer cooldown.
---
At what expense? Merging servers is way better. Costs more $$ tho
---
Wait so basically only one guy in the guild actually could complete the quest and get the scarab mount? Or could you make sure several people got the necessary quests done before ringing the gong?
---
You are mentally challenged also ?
---
Because they would complete it minutes before the others, making all there work for nothing.
---
What's stopping other guilds from getting the scepter?
---
Cant you instant cast the mount with hand of Edward the odd? That's a pretty big plus
---
Every level you gotta get up and do 10 pushups and 10 situps.
---
Thank you so much for this!
---
That escalated quickly.
---
Can those tables slide out or are the chairs on wheels? I mean its to far to the keyboard and mouse to be able to play?
---
On the same page as you. The fresh start is the most attract part of wow classic. Truly can't wait to be start over.
---
Yeah if this exists I'll be thrilled.
---
is this r/Eve ?
---
That's part of a larger discussion irrelevant to the issue at hand. Blizzard is developing Wow Classic in Irvine, CA, not a third-world country.
---
Wow you're dramatic
---
addons.
---
Is that on a fresh server? I mean only using gear they made or quested? Seriously curious.
---
&gt; Even one of the admins of the classic hunter discord is thinking of re-rolling if they don't fix these issues.
---
Wow, it's the end of the world really.
---
I mean, even the discord admin??? Jeez
---
Alright guys, let's take a piss break.  *15 minutes later* Alright, so piss break again? *20 minutes later* yeah I can't hold this anymore guys, piss break.
---
The backpedaling, clicking, keyboard turning players of 2005 will surely remember spell batching and appreciate this decision to implement this to preserve ‘class balance’ and ‘flow of combat’.
---
Yeah, my job is 40 hours/week and it definitely has a lot of deadtime where things sometimes simply can't be done and there's not enough time in the day to begin so you're left with an hour to just browse reddit or find something else to do. If I worked 35 hours a week, I'd get the same amount of work done.
---
Others in my work though work voluntarily (but they feel obligated) to work over 40 hours a week.
---
&gt;  i did it takes the first 3 dps first tank and first healer it can find.
---
there is still a difference. LFG tool in BC would take just the same first 4 people and you and mix it together into a group. But the quality of people would drop. Because there is some form of barrier that many people who rely on the LFG tool to get into groups, just don't overcome.
---
Good luck getting that strafing bug fixed. That was one of the best features of the game from Vanilla-Wrath!
---
you cant force
---
That bring some memories... Me and my brother spent hours on his mage trying to get on top of / under Orgrimmar, behind the wall in Silverpine Forest, into the Caverns of Time, into Mount Hyjal or into Zulaman (before it was released in tbc)...  
---
I don't think wall walking/climbing is possible with legion/bfa client the classic is based on which sucks... :/
---
sad but still glad to know it now :) thank you \^\^
---
The Quadro is aids let me say that now. I built my friend a workstation computer for 3D modelling and low to mid-range Quadro’s benched lower then the usual gaming GPU benchs.
---
Honestly i’d look at the RX GPUs and am a little concerned with the other selections.. i have a 10 year old computer that runs a Radeon 6870 so I want to know why a Mac has only taken it 1 generation further. I’ll have a look into it.
---
Hmm alright thanks.  Sound about right.  Thanks for the intel
---
"Posted February 20, 2006
---
that cracked me up "we dont want be remembered as the guild who... yadda yadda" like ANYONE will ever remember the famous WoW guild that accomplished x task within the game rofl"
---
Well... that prediction went south, didn't it :D
---
Downvoted to hell!!!!!
---
Bro that footman is 2 seconds from being human paste
---
I think the tables go over the arms of the chairs.
---
Back then I had a naked lvl 2 dwarf rogue named Hahausuck that I had gotten over to the gates of org, and when I was bored I would go on him and watch the 60s duel from afar. And try to predict the end of the duel, then stealth over part way and break it at the last second, run in and try to land a SS on the losers back as his health hit 1.
---
I would miss a lot, or mess up my timing and get fucked by regen. And I could only do it a few times before they would start hunting and camping me. But by the time BC came out I had over 30 honorable kills on that rogue, all level 60s.
---
So my vote goes for rogue.
---
&gt;At what expense? 
---
To them?  None.  To us, forced to read endless threads about fucking layering.
---
As someone who played Oldschool Runescape on its re-release, it really is everything you could hope for, enjoy it!
---
Lol. There many adjectives between flawless and terrible, I like cheap, convenient, fast, etc.
---
Yes some people are talking about epic mounts in this thread. The class specific ones were not available on release.
---
Uhhhh what? Between 2005 and 2010 WoW was so big it was hard to find people who hadn't at least tried it.
---
Please no delays. My leave has already been approved and it's a real pure bitch to get that moved.
---
horde 
---
undead have wotf
---
orcs have stun resist
---
tauren have extra range with leeway (you best believe all wars gonna be tauren)
---
and trolls.. well trolls dont have anything great
---
We don't know this for sure. It was true in Vanilla, but this is Classic. With how many players are coming back and coming from retail, I think Horde's going to be pushing 60/40 on Alliance in terms of population on PvP realms
---
its not a great solution, if its abuseable... holy shit
---
No kidding..guess I pissed off the OP?
---
Great video my man congrats :)
---
You are the only light in this dark night full of pessimism due to the tons of bugs with our beloved class
---
Same goes for me....reversed
---
Well if you are the first to enter a zone, of course its gonna be empty.
---
I just need a metal compatible graphic card
---
The faction with the advantage in wPvP is usually whichever one strikes first. 
---
Orc stun resist and Will of the Forsaken can be annoying, but it's not some insurmountable challenge to fight a horde player.
---
alliance always excels thanks to paladins
---
All of them do?I answered with things that greatly affect wPvP. Me thinks you might not understand WPvP.
---
Once Horde gets to Scarlet Monastery level stuff, it's Horde all the way.
---
Well you can - the dev's could literally put locks in place on the servers that say of a 3k pop 1.5k are always alliance etc and 1.5k are always horde etc.
---
This is how pathing should be working for vanilla. A lot of stuff soloed in the same way in DM east and North. So I would say 0%. I did put in a bug report for mobs leashing in dungeons tho. If you don’t attack a mob for around 8 seconds it’ll just reset. Same with bosses leashing. I don’t believe the three dwarves are supposed to be able to leash one and reset the other two.
---
He's not wrong, the game was "dead" in 2005 by today's standards.

wall jumping was dead in legion and classic uses legion client im sure it won't work anymore...
---
Literally just dont exploit the labour of your young work force working a qualified job for a barely liveable wage based on the areas they operate out of.
---
Its figures out, and has been for basically ever, just employers will always.exploit their workforce if they can.
---
After a server has been layered, it's forever tainted.   Like Herpes.
---
It’s incredible how our minds can see what’s important to us everywhere, even if it’s not there :)
---
if they want to shoot themselves in the foot so be it, doesnt sound like they were actively impeding other guilds efforts to finish the questline
---
although i would felt some schadenfreude if detheroc was a PvP server and the other faction managed to complete the questline , ring the gong, and camp the area to prevent that guild from ringing the gong during the window
---
Zero
---
Warlocks are crap dps in MC and BWL, any competent mage or hunter will outdps them. Hardcore guilds will never have more then 3 warlocks in early tiers
---
Make them all NE males with the long braids
---
No chance that happens.  If it ruins everything for you, then don’t play the game.  Or you can start playing after it’s removed and you’ll never know it even existed.  Choice is yours, nobody cares what you decide to do, so do whatever you want.

Well well well. What do we have here? Don't be fooled! &amp;#76;e&amp;#69;pic&amp;#82;edditor&amp;#54;&amp;#57; is just a bot out for your karma.     
---
Fun fact: 'Yes' is this bot's most posted word by itself... and it posts a lot.
---
Lol this is only quest givers
---
I scored two crack rocks this morning.   How you doin?
---
It was designed to the extent that I previously described. In essence of any fantasy mmorpg there are classes and races that do different things, and roles that people need to fill. To say the least this was definitely intended.
---
He has a point really.  $15 a month for Classic WoW is highway robbery.
---
I put on my lucky fishing hat.
---
There something you need to talk about?
---
How does it cost them less to have layering - layers are basically servers on servers. This myth that it will cost them less, is perpetuated by people that don't understand layer.
---
This isn't the place for art posts
---
Time.
---
Yay! Cake! :) 
---
Boo! Wait a year! :(
---
:D
---
Really? Imagine how useful it would be to be lowbies!
---
That setup looks trash
---
? I didnt downvote you man lol
---
I actually bought that laptop so i can play classic in school when it launches...
---
STV
---
They're both top notch annoying and can perform Mostly the same annoying actions in terms of harassing people; one from a distance and one close up, but Rogues you just never see coming usually which makes it more frustrating. Either of those classes with Engineering makes it all the more agonizing.

Uhm that’s pretty stereotypical nerd stuff. Especially the being of “edgyness” you’re describing here.
---
RP intesifies

In the US. If you were an EU player, they pretty much were (1.3 came 4 weeks after EU release), so, very few people reached 60 in EU before the class mounts arrived.
---
source?
---
Yup. I don't want every class balanced, just I'd like specs like enhancement, shadow, feral, ele, ret to bring something unique so they are invited, and not just a buff that makes bringing only 1 of them useful. But, I know it's hard as fuck to do that.
---
Damn.. (  Does every class has some issue on beta?
---
classic will be dead before phase 2 anyway, the game is already an abomination of 1.12.
---
Didn't they also eventually let the gates open after a certain amount of time passed?
---
Really?  Shamans were meant to be tanks too.  Druids and Paladins too.  
---
Only 1 class could tank on release, and druids weren't really able until the expansion was over.  Paladins had to wait to TBC.  Druids too really.
---
Shamans never did become tanks.
---
On Launch? There were a lot! Each Expansion sold a shit ton! Just 60% of the initial launch players left.
---
Well, I respect your approach. I'd be the friend that just tells them to quit nagging about the authenticity of the game haha. It is what it is.
---
I do agree. Although I know it's hard to balance while keeping each spec unique and classic like, I would prefer more specs being able to PvE
---
You play a class, not a spec. One of the worst parts about tbc was how classes were changed entirely due to their spec. Vanilla specs all still use the classes base purpose.
---
We get these posts 12 times a day, because people want to raid as boomkin. Lets change the entire game so I can play boomkin. BOOMKIN!
---
Aye, I recall those two indeed being patched. I still hope to see a dragon kited into org though. Lmao. A rollback just to stop the disease from constantly re-spreading upon spawn or login? That's wild.
---
Did i say something else?
---
All i said is that he probably tries to kick healer for being lowest dps.
---
A joke about braindeads thinking dps is the only thing that exists.
---
I watched him stream beta, he seemed frustrated at several points with quest items being fought over (harpy crates in Durotar)
---
Ill admit that STV is a lot less efficient for alliance. Also probably Felwood and maybe Badlands. But the other post 30 zones are pretty great. Plus don't undersell how much better pre 30 is for alliance. You can literally go starting zone ----&gt; Westfall ----&gt; Redridge -----&gt; Duskwood ----&gt; Wetlands and almost perfectly in order. Horde go starting zone ----&gt; Barrens ---&gt; Stonetalon ---&gt; More Barrens ---&gt; Stonetalon ----&gt; Ashenvale ----&gt; Super more barrens ----&gt; then Stonetalon ----&gt; then Ashenvale again ----&gt; and if needed 1000 needles. Its so much less efficient. None of the above zones can be completed in the level bracket it starts without a very very hefty amount of pure mob grinding.
---
Easy peasy, and the main reason im furious at Blizzard still.
---
High Elf Spellbreakers. THE most iconic race/class combo ever, arguably. The only close ones are Human paladin (Arthas/Uther are super popular), Orc Warrior (Gromm, 'nuff said). Other than those two, High Elf Spellbreakers are the ultimate in class/race fantasy and I will never forgive Blizzard for the atrocities they committed by giving Horde BE and then shitting on Alliance with Purple Emo Elves.

He left blizzard again shortly after

A good arms warrior with blessing of freedom is a decisive advantage.  My vote is Alliance.
---
Hahaha. Love this so much. Nicely done on the setup and meme.
---
This is an online game which will be constantly updated.  If you want to play hunter, it might be worth toughing out.  If Blizzard fixes it a month after launch you'll be bummed that you didn't roll class you wanted to play.
---
True
---
I think this board's admins are pretty commies or "influenced" by blizzard reps.
---
My posts are also deleted when i try to start a discussion about various comparisons between vanilla and classic.
---
Sad.
---
To be fair, both those arguments defending layering are perfectly valid.
---
And 10 squats.
---
What about the rep needed to summon him?  don't you need honored or revered with Hydraxian Waterlords to get the water to douse the seals?
---
My feedback is a downvote. I hope that helps.
---
Horde because of race abilities
---
Convincing a friend to do that is pretty impressive
---
This will be a blessing. You'll be off of work a not sleeping anyway, might as well power level to 60 as well.
---
I started playing right after BC released, played 7 years straight until WoD released and decided to leave indefinitely. I was so out of the loop that I didn't learn about Classic until a month ago and only thanks to Reddit lol. I got really excited and unpacked my PC, working on making some upgrades and changes, and in the meantime I've been playing retail to get back in the swing of things. I also don't have access to beta but hope to catch the last stress test at least! If anyone is looking to form a guild and wouldn't mind including me, I'm game 😁 US FL here - not sure what my main will be but my plan is to level one of each at least.
---
I don’t understand but if your happy buying a new PC that has the specs of a 5 year old budget build i’m not stopping you.

Amen. Gives this guy a medal.

\#no Classic wow: The world of Layercraft
---
one MILLION dollars!
---
Can you go into detail how layering doesn't work properly? Its literally there so thousands of people aren't competing for the very slow respawn of mobs in classic at the start if the game - something I can imagine everyone in the community wants given they understand what playing WoW on a release without it is like - which is fucking mayhem. 
---
Remember the first quest in Vash'Jir In cataclysm where you need to kill 8 Naga? Took me 45 minutes on cataclysm release. Is that supposed to be fun? Would I prefer some layering where the server is likely still going to put me with a lot of people, but not eye-gougeingly painful when you want to just play the game as opposed to praying those with instant casts dont tag a mob before you? 
---
I'm aware there are ways to exploit layering, but personally, I'd take a slightly fragmented world over sitting ontop of lazy peon spawns competing against thousands of people in durotar to complete a fucking quest.
---
I played the shit out of 39 when I could, untill they added EXP to battlegrounds and I did not turn it off (I was only a few EXP away from 40).
---
The way it goes (very, very simplified) is this:
---
1. Obtain neutral rep with a faction (doable only via killing elite bugs, which drop an item you can turn in for rep. Only you can get these items (meaning you have to be present in the group farming them), although you get buffs over time that you can give to other players to let them also collect the it ems for you (they cant turn in, they can just collect to give to you)). This takes a VERY long time of playing. If you have 2 people collecting these, it basically takes twice as long. Three people 3x as long etc.
---
2. Get 3 chains of quests, that ask you to make some hard shit like speedrun an endgame raid, kill a world boss, bring a lot of crafting materials etc. Again, all quest items are given to one person per raid doing the quest.
---
3. Finally turn in all 3 quests to receive a scepter. Only the person turning in the quest gets the scepter. This person can now hit the gong, starting the event to open the AQ gates.
---
Multiple people from different guilds can get scepter - it was not uncommon to have 1 horde and 1 alliance scepter bearers per server - however it was quite rare to have more than 2 people with the scepter by the time gates were opened. So yes, it is a case of "only 1-2 scarab lords per server, maybe 2-3 in extremely rare c ircumstances)
---
You could wait to ring the gong, sure. However the amount of time it takes to grind this really was very long, and combined with the fact that other guilds could steal your glory, and start event at a time when you didnt want them to (as well as having the honor of being "the guild that did it") meant that it was basically a one person thing.
---
ZG one? I imagine it makes them soul bound by 1.12 at least
---
Still your objective is completed - raid is open for everyone.
---
Nothing like farming HKs in STV while waiting for queue either.  19s is a trash bracket.
---
Don't talk about my chinese anime mmorpg's like that :c they were my childhood even if they were pay2win garbage!
---
I had fun gosh darn it!
---
Ehh horde pretty much runs every aspect of the game so downvote for this mis information
---
Known to who - the spreadsheet doesn't mention when or how they were reported.
---
you would be right. but is making the first 10-20 levels easier in exchange for an economy’s longevity worth it?
---
Evidence suggests a 49-51% ratio over the multiple polls we have see on this forum. 
---
So what you think really doesnt matter since you dont seem to have any basis for it? The discussion is obviously assuming equal amount of players.  Otherwise the argument only comes down to ”who has more people” and there is no topic of discussion around that since we cant even play the real game.

**&lt;IRONFIST&gt; - \\\\ Horde - PvP - NA Central Standard time // - Tuesday/Thursday 7:30-10:30 (Raid)**
---
IRONFIST is an adult guild that understands we are no longer in our teens while playing WoW. We get that you have a job, a family and sometimes other obligations that are more important than making it to an event, raiding or even PvP. We also understand you play video games because sometime you want to just relax, and get away from all lives obligations (or even the kids).  We are not about having toxic people in our community, if you feel like you would rather spend time trolling people or being an ass-hat, then IRONFIST is NOT the community for you. 
---
We raid on Tuesday and Thursday from 7:30 pm - 10:30pm and we will have a clean up raid on Sundays (times announced by RL that week). We will also be hosting other PvP event, and other stuff to keep the game interesting and fun.

---
Thanks!
---
But some people do!
---
Indeed. The OP is legit just dismissing incredibly important arguments for using temporary layering. No sign of intelligence in their post and I feel my IQ has gone down after reading it.
---
It was just a bit rich reading the whole “would YOU knowingly support this..” while everyone I know owns iPhones and has cheap sweatshop made clothes.
---
I haven't exaggerated nothing. And yes for alot of players it will affect their gameplay and most likely the decision of playing or not. Just because you don't care doesnt mean noone does. If there are endless posts then by definition there are alot of people that find aspects of layering negative.   
---
Ofcourse some exaggerate but alot of them are real. Dont throw the baby with the bathwater
---
oh, clever! you said the thing people said in 2017! :O
---
i laughed so much!
---
Maybe your processor thermal paste needs reapplying as it has just simply burnt to a crisp and is no longer absorbing the heat when your computer needs to start kicking more power out
---
Don't tell me how to enjoy my ~~gametime~~ reddit
---
Just because they could tank doesn’t mean they were meant to. It gave some flavor and playability in five man dungeon content. 
---
Druids and paladins can tank five man content just fine as well, even ten man Ubrs. Raiding is the endgame. There is a ton of content before then. What is nice about vanilla is endgame does not trivialize precious content, so tanking five mans as a Druid or paladin, will and can be always viable.
---
How? $15 for potentially 720 hours of entertainment. It costs more for me to see a movie for 1.5 hours with a small soda and popcorn.
---
Tbh my wife will be off of work and i will have to work. The fact, that I’m not going to sleep anyways, let’s me hope that I can do some leveling progress - right after I enjoyed cleaning up my son...
---
I don’t think people realize what a unique experience this is. I see so many people wanting to race to 60 and I don’t understand why. Perhaps because it’s the current mindset of retail..faceroll all the content in a few weeks. 
---
Wait until they realize that there’s no experience boost and leveling takes a very long time. Wait until they try to faceroll content but can’t because they have no gear or gold to respec again. Wait until they realize they don’t have the gold to buy things they desperately need and have to advertise in a city to use their professions (and level them) to make some. 
---
Min/maxing looks good on paper but it’s not going to work as intended for most people..at least not in the beginning. It works as it does in the beta because of the level cap. People can gear up over a few weeks at 30 or 40 and be much stronger than normal when the cap gets raised allowing them to clear things they normally wouldn’t be able to if they hadn’t stopped to gear up.
---
To each their own, but I would put forth..this is something that will probably never happen again. Enjoy everything about it. Much more important than clearing content the quickest is becoming the most reliable and respectable player that you can be. Having the patterns and recipes that no one else does. And just overall not being an asshole (except in barrens or trade chat..perfectly acceptable there..haha). As you said, it’s essentially opening a brand new mmo on release day but already knowing it’s by far the greatest game in the history of mmo’s. What a wonderful time to be a gamer. Look forward to the economy crashing again. Everyone knows the economy crashed in 2008 becoming of WoW..haha.
---
That's really interesting.  The thought of zero items on the AH has never even occurred to me.  I may also participate in this event.
---
So ... private server and not Classic beta?  Wrong subreddit, friend.
---
I disagree with that being the only reason.
---
Well yeah, but a rogue can stun, a hunter can daze/scatter, a warlock can fear, a priest can mind control, a mage can poly. 
---
In the case of druid I think stealth is a qol mechanic, but doesn't really offer the openers a rogue has.
---
Blizzard get more money if players can acces de game, your point is just childish
---
No honey, i'm Not leaving you alone at the altar. That's just a surprise divorce.
---
One of best ideas I've heard was to actually relocated her in Classic. Put her somewhere completely different spot. This way we could get authentic "Where is Mankirks wife" back to Barrens chat.
---
Skin all critters (rabbits, deer, sheep, etc.) as you go and you’ll have no problem leveling up Skinning. Immediately buy a Skinning Knife and train Skinning as soon as you have 92 copper, then resume questing in your starter area while skinning all critters and other skinnable beasts.
---
Sneaky edits are the best.
---
The only thing that shield is going to do is reverberate like a gong as it smashes into his helmet. Punting the poor humans head into his chest like a game of whack-a-mole.
---
So by that logic, once you have paid off your mortgage for a few years you would get a line of credit on the equity and invest that?
---
&gt; And yes for alot of players it will affect their gameplay and most likely the decision of playing or not
---
Right, I am sure a whole horde of players is going to quit, because they failed to gank someone in the first two months.  
---
I would pay money to see that actually.  Some dbag tries to gank a lowbie, and he jumps layers, and then the person deletes their account.
---
I had this happen the other day and it seems to be linked to an issue with gameux.dll. I got around it by renaming wow.exe to wow1.exe.

We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Sundays, 7pm-11pm EST. Raids will start after plenty of time is given for players to level and gear up. Aiming for early November.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.

---
Not classic beta but I'm playing on a vanilla private server, thought it was probably a better idea to post here?
---
I think you get the most meaningful results when you set the filter to level40 only. In example on the pvp realm there is a huge amount of 1s, most likely created as asmon follow arounds.
---
Welcome back brethren.
---
like you, i could handle these bugs (even the pvp ones for me) if there was a some assurance that it would be fixed by 60. 
---
i havent played since wrath so i do not know of blizzards track record for this stuff aside from reading negatively colored posts of reddit about blizzard. i dunno how many grains of salt to assign these posts.
---
I was gonna say no that you never change your faction but then i read that you were alliance so yes do it.
---
The economy of what? Crafting mats and items?
---
Not having layering is only delaying the economy going through inflation. Classic is a stagnant game version so it's only a matter of time until the economy is fucked up, layering or not.
---
They lose money on fire extinguishers for the 6 servers they'll be stuffing every launch player on without layering
---
Wait I can‘t remember: no warlock pala mounts for lvl 40 either?
---
Most raid drops in this quest were single drops, i.e. only one item dropped, regardless of how many people were on this exact quest step. 
---
Depending on how quick the server was with the war effort, you could realistically do this quest for 4-6 people. But to do it for every raider in the guild would take a year.
---
&gt;  720 hours of entertainment.
---
ROFL!  wow
---
Oh look, this 4-panel meme again.  Better go report a layering thread to balance it out...
---
I thought about that but then I wouldn't be able to run more modern, demanding games and have zero issues, for example Dishonored 2 and Mordhau top out at about 15% CPU usage on high graphical settings
---
Looks like the chairs slide in perfectly under the table
---
Hmm okay, thanks I'll give that a go!
---
I think everybody did this at least once
---
Good thing it's not you then
---
Do you know what [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)) is ?
---
Several could, it just took time to gather the items needed.  There were instances of multiple Scarab Lords from a single opening.
---
At least he'll be casually fucking...
---
This sounds like it could be the beginning of the next expansion!
---
Would it be possible to report those people for abusing the layering system?

[A] [NA] Priest and warrior duo.

Looking for a casual, adult guild focused on dungeons, PVP, professions, reputations, and leisurely fun.
---
We are two busy adults that can’t commit to set schedules of time but plan to be on frequently. 
---
Willing to respec as needed but will be tanking and healing as much as possible.  
---
Just looking for cool, casual folks to level with an enjoy the game differently than we were able to 15 years ago given our life changes.
---
Leveling on an undocumented server as we speak, you can absolutely heal 5 man's as Enhancement. It's awkward until about 22 and then it evens out. Word of fair warning you will end up LOM / OOM quickly. 
---
Also, Crescent Staff, reward from WC quest is seriously fucking great. Even if you're following Joana's guide or you've got your own strategy- take the time to finish that quest and hit WC. That staff will take you far!
---
None of this matters when the masses of slippery undead frost mages can endlessly kite even enemy mages. 
---
The shaman/paladin matchup really doesn't define Horde/Alliance pvp, it's not like both sides will be running many of them. 
---
Also, most PvP shamans run elemental, so it's not like they have one target to choose from to blow up.
---
I think he means more like first mainstream games that really grew a huge community
---
The "Blizzard guys who decided to sell out" are not a billion dollar megacorp.  They are some nerds who started a video game company and were presented with the opportunity to solve all their financial concerns for the rest of their life.
---
Not sure if ringing the gong is an instant click or has a cast time but if it is instant you fortunately/unfortunately can't stop someone from corpse jumping their way to ring it.  If it has a cast time ... well then, that would be interesting.
---
WTF is this? could someone pls explain?
---
Unless people make a big enough stink about it, which I hope they do, RPPVP servers are the best
---
numero uno
---
Why are PC gamer always wants me to play their fucking dumb pc shit ?
---
Can you actually ignore from right clicking their name? 
---
I've tried on an undocumented server and it doesn't have the option to ignore, only Whisper, Invite, Target and something else, not Ignore though.
---
They better figure out the layering-stuff really quickly.
---
I quit WoW during Cataclysm because I didn't like what the game had become, and was playing it on and off at that point. I think WotLK was when it went downhill. Quit video games altogether recently.
---
But damn I am getting hyped up about this. I'm gonna take a break from games until August 13. Then I'm getting classic.
---
I'm gonna be a Tauren Shaman. That's what I made the first day I played, but I thought the character got deleted and ended up playing a Gnome Warlock after that.
---
Hope I don't get addicted :P
---
Credit to him. I just found it while googling for a world map.
---
Well, you can have Warriors, priest and mages so yeah you can clear every raid.
---
Going to the bathroom must feel like a patient ripping off the IV lines.

It's a repost from /r/wow so basically it's not a complete repost, only a half one
---
Gnomes can be Mages

Hold up, hold up! It's possible to enter an instance portal WITHOUT jumping!? What patch was THAT implemented in!?
---
no
---
The actual material investment for the scepter quest chain is fairly small, oyu only need 20 arcanite bars, 10 sapphires and 10 diamonds. The market value of all of this is between 400 and 800g. 
---
The material investment was more on the server wide war effort, which had nothing to do with the scepter quest.
---
The scepter quest required several long and hard grinds though.

Recruiting: All Classes, though some roles are filling up.  
---
Intro: TGIF was created by a few typical, mid-30s, former raiders. After searching for 1-night a week raid guilds, we found none that fit our mutual availability...and so TGIF was born! TGIF was created to provide busy adults with the opportunity to see Classic WoW's raid content with the most minimal time requirements - 1 night, 3 hours a week (even during progression). We understand that the limited raid hours may result in slower progression in the later phases of vanilla, but we're excited to build a community and progress as efficiently as we can during our raid-time. Also, we think that there are probably a lot of other talented players out there who want to tackle Classic, but don't want to have to push work, sleep, or family obligations to the back-burner.
---
Expectations: Given the limited schedule, we need to have strong participation and preparation. We require a 75% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. We will start raiding as soon as we have a critical mass at 60, hopefully 2-3months after launch
---
Schedule: We will raid Friday from 10-1am EST (7-10pm PST).
---
Optional Scheduling:
---
Organized PvP Premades
---
PUG Raiding: 40man raids will be hosted on Saturday/Sunday for any unfinished content, and no TGIF preference given to those who can or can't attend.

---
i'm honestly curious did you play vanilla? not being a dick or anything  
---
but my experience without flying which has always been a max level ability per zone cold weather flying, lvl 68 flying etc.  
---
is the only place pvp happens besides being ganked by someone much higher level is outside instances and even then its a "i'm just killing time" gank not "lets start a fucking race war" gank.  
---
world pvp in vanilla is just extremely over stated it happens but its some douche camping your low level corpse that runs away the moment anyone else shows up.  
---
i'd say battle grounds and dishonorable kills did more harm to world pvp than flying ever could.
---
Nowdays big games are really, really big. League of Legends for example had something like 100 milions active accounts (used monthly) and it's not alone.

##**⭐️Who is Nostalgia?⭐️**
---
Nostalgia was recently founded by a core group of friends that have been gaming with each other for over a decade. Though we all play a variety of different games, the hype of Classic WoW has us eager to relive the wonder and excitement in a version that was much more simple. Though we have ditched the huge CRT monitors, fan grills on our computers, and are now grown ups who work; we are looking to recreate the Classic WoW experience through this social and progressive guild. 
---
We are not a longstanding guild and are also not looking for world firsts or Rank 14 pvp, however we welcome all of the possibilities. Our main goal is to create a relaxed yet competitive experience exploring all of the endgame content possible while helping people learn and build friendships - pretty much the Classic WoW experience.  
---
##**⭐️Who are we looking for?⭐️**
---
- If you’ve never been in a guild, we welcome you to have us as your first.
---
- If you’ve never played WoW before you’ll have 60 levels plus our support to figure it out ;)  
---
- If you’re a die hard veteran who’s farmed every raid and done it all you’re more than welcome too. 
---
- Our goal is **Quality over Quantity**, **Maximum Efficiency**, and **Good Vibes**. If this speaks your language welcome to Nostalgia. 
---
- We are currently recruiting **all roles**.
---
Brother, if that's trash my setup is the London sewers.
---
I got my blood clots(DVT) in April so already on thinners at launch. Problem solved.
---
frostwolf (de) affenjungs inc (cede+gm) did that too
---
alvinx even wrote a song about it

---
Yeah from my understanding blizzard had a bunch of changes in vanilla that went in during early TBC because it just worked that way in the timeline.
---
Big question is, will there be a DBM-style mod available for Classic within the first week?  It's not that the fights were necessarily harder in Classic, but every person in the raid had to be aware of the mechanics without the crutches we've all come to depend on nowadays.
---
Could your guild do new BFA content without Deadly Boss Mods?  I don't know if mine could.
---
that has to be the absolute worst posture for gaming I can imagine
---
Must have been 2005ish, i remember being on the phone with my friend who i used to play RuneScape with, who had talked me into going over to wow with him, he took the leap about a month before me so he had a decent heard start. 
---
we were on the phone because neither of us had figured out VoiP of any kind yet. I swear our (parents) house phone-bill was worse than the WoW subscription every month. 
---
I remember being on the phone and agonising over what to name my character. After what i now realise was far too long deliberating a name, i settled on: "Taurenhunt"..... the paladin.... 
---
Jesus... 2005 me was an idiot. not saying I'm not an idiot now. but damn...
---
Thx for all the feedback. I’m thinking I’ll keep with my dwarf loyalties. 
---
I dunno if I’ll be MT in a raid but at least I’ll be leading dungeons with friends and likely OT in raids.
---
Plus I like pvp and I love stoneform to mess with blinds.
---
whoa thats pretty cool. not a sneaker person but props for making something neat
---
This worked! Thanks a lot!
---
I couldn't agree with this more!
---
It took a petition to get classic wow. What do you think it will take to make it great?
---
Hunters were always kindve buggy, I'll probably still be rolling one because the class flavour is exactly what I want and it's nostalgic for me. 
---
Also, the less hunters the better.
---
&gt; ROFL! wow
---
Okay? Are you trying to form a thought here? 
---
&gt; Ohh look the tried and true, bring up something totally different as a comparison. I spend 5 grand renting a fishing boat out. WOW is cheap.
---
Now you're just being ridiculous. They're two comparable forms of entertainment value. $15 for 30 days (yes, 720 hours ROFL!wow) of entertainment is very, very cheap in 2019.
---
If you honestly want to be that pedantic: an argument could be made that even at the same price, Classic WoW would offer *more* entertainment value than a 1.5 hour movie; one you just sit and stare at, the other you actually interact and engage with.
---
And after much searching, as someone else mentioned, the off hand is a green boe. https://i.imgur.com/2xL7iNM.jpg
---
have a bunch or taurens on mounts perhaps?
---
uhh thats not the same but yeah if you want to state it that way sure :P
---
Stoneform is less situational than escape artist and can be of benefit to a wider number of situations. Both are good but my issue with escape artist is that part of it’s benefit is eroded because slows are easily reapplied. I think it has more value for a warrior as they have fewer options to burn to break roots and slows.
---
Stoneform will always be strong but it has increased value when the game launches because there will be so many horde rogues around. Beyond the obvious things, devouring plague was beastly and this clears it. 
---
I don’t think the answer is black and white and there are other factors to consider like can you handle staring at a dwarf all day or maybe a tiny gnome frame is more sneaky (totally is), or maybe pink pigtails are your thing... 
---
I had a few rogue thinks back then and my favorite was human....perception was huge for room clearing with sap and the combat animations seemed to be really well timed with energy regeneration so it was easy to get a feel for things by simply watching the toon....I know this is a little “out there”.
---
This time around I’d probably go dwarf.
---
Beep boop. How did you comment so fast!? Oh wait, &amp;#76;e&amp;#69;pic&amp;#82;edditor&amp;#54;&amp;#57; is a bot out to be annoying for internet points!     
---
What a comedy genius! Maybe you should do a joke bot instead.
---
best wow song ever :)
---
"wir wollen 5000 gold haben weil kein bock besteht das zeug umsonst zu farmen"
---
macs are really good for surfing the internet
---
Yes, I didn't realize I wanted it so much until it was first announced at blizzcon. I've been subbed to /classicwow since we had only had 3k and I've been creeping here every day. I've beta tested previous wow expansions and been hyped before but nothing to this level. I've never taken off more than a couple days for a release but for classic I'm giving myself 3 straight weeks of no-lifing to start this thing out right. Beyond pumped.
---
I think nostalgia will play a big roll in you getting started. I'm not saying rose colored glasses here, but those first few areas will be a damn blast from the past if you played as a kid. For me Ironforge is my one true city love, and the constant struggle with the horde gankers means I will never defect!
---
Out of all the 9 classes, it's the less impactfull for sure
---
The alternative would be to add more servers.
---
I didn't main a druid, but i played one on the private servers as a bear tank. I built a strong healer set as well that i would bring with me and be able to decurse like the best of them in raids. I loved being the utility player of the raid. The only thing i wasn't a fan of was the fact i couldn't main tank so hence the reason i won't be playing one come classic. But druids are by far one of my favorite classic classes. They are wonderful for leveling, pvp and pve. The way you are wanting to play a druid is exactly why they are awesome.
---
That feeling when 0ms over voice coms
---
Pun intended?
---
**Guild : &lt;**TBD (In the process of picking the name... Input in the Discord would be appreciated!)
---
**Faction :** Alliance  
---
**Server :** PVP
---
**About Us :** I was the GM and raid leader of an alliance guild on thunderhorn for the first year in Vanilla before we switched to horde on Garona. We were a top 3 guild on the server. We have done the hardcore thing and a majority of us have careers, wives/husbands , children, etc. We are looking to progress at a decent pace without no-lifing the game or getting divorced lol. We will raid at max 3 nights a week, will do a lot of PvP as well as guild events. We have the experience in our officer core to get stuff done.
---
**Loot System :** Its a hybrid DKP system. Its in the discord. If our guild sounds like something you are interested in, click the discord link at the bottom of this post and come check out the DKP channel and ask any questions you have. Its the best loot system you will find and its not even close.
---
**Raiding :** As noted in the About Us section, we will progress pretty quickly due to our knowledge of the raids as a whole. Been there done that. We probably cleared MC / BWL over 50 times each , AQ40 about 10 times. Nax, I cleared 8 bosses while some of the officers cleared the full zone. After we secure our needed classes, we won't mind people playing an off-spec here and there either as long as they play it at a decent clip.
---
**Expectations :** This is where we differ from almost every other guild you will find. We aren't trying to go nuts. Vanilla isn't rocket science. We won't be trying to no-life it and won't hold you to those expectations. All we ask is when we do raid, show up ready to go. Give it your best and have fun. Do this + follow the simple guild rules and we will be one of the best guilds on the server.
---
**Rules :** Pretty simple. Don't be an ass to other guildies. Don't be an ass to others on the server. Be helpful to guildmates. Be mature. Don't make the guild look bad. Pretty much if any of these rules are broken its the deuces for you. We are a no drama guild. Period.

---
To be fair, they're remembered far more than any guild which did the scepter quest.
---
It is basically working as intended lol.  Their alternate is going back to ... basically sharding.  That would be a shitstorm all its own.  Launches are never going to be perfect ... pick your poison (reddit here seems to prefer sharding mostly now).
---
But private server megarealms with dynamic spawns!!
---
Yeah, no. It's classic, not pserver. With Blizzlike concurrent population cap. Because, surprise, surprise, it's actually Blizzard!
---
I don't like layering but yeah. It's better than dead realms. I think there could be an argument to be made for server clusters that are designed to be merged over layering but.. Well. It seems Blizzard is not going for that route and it has it's own downsides too.
---
League of Legends or Fortnite. WoW is not even close to those giants.
---
Not really no. Its possible to ring the gong during the 10 hour event - rewarding people with the mount and the title.
---
So worst case scenario, they open the gate. Best case scenario, they open the gate and you also become a scarab lord.
---
You are very misinformed.
---
The Alliance of Lordaeron is completely extinct, all of its member nations have been destroyed with the exception of Kul Tiras.The Alliance of vanilla shares exactly zero member factions with the Alliance of Lordaeron, which was comprised of the six remaining Human Kingdoms (Stormwind was destroyed before the Alliance of Lordaeron existed, and was restored after the Alliance of Lordaeron was disbanded), as well as the elves (who left as soon as the war was over).
---
The interment of orcs was sponsored by the human kingdoms and was decided upon by said human kingdoms. Those human kingdoms being the Kingdom of Lordaeron, the Kingdom of Stromgarde, the City of Dalaran, the Kingdom of Alterac, the Kingdom of Gilneas, and the Admiralty of Kul Tiras.
---
That is the entirety of the Alliance of Lordaeron. Exactly zero of those kingdoms are members of the Alliance in vanilla.
---
Whereas even the Warsong Clan and the Burning Blade Clan and so on are **still** part of the 'New Horde', which is just the same barbarians who destroyed Azeroth lead by a nicer guy. The Alliance of vanilla is composed of dwarves and gnomes (who were not part of the Alliance of Lordaeron), of Stormwind humans (who were destroyed in the First War), and of night elves. None of which have anything to do with 'racism and slavery'.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

And have half die in a few months?

trolls have foot odor
---
The concept of layering isn't the issue, starting zones are important. The issue with layering is the unintended consequences.. hopping layers to abuse resources or escape world pvp etc.
---
&gt;There are outside factors that come into play also that are outside of dev control. 
---
Money. The word you’re looking for is money.
---
I had to find it. It's a green BoE named Dimensional Blade. https://i.imgur.com/2xL7iNM.jpg
---
Probably since it's an exploit.There may even be automatic systems in place to combat layering abuse come launch as far as we know.
---
You can just mindlessly spam dungeons while watching Netflix if you're a tank. Takes no effort beyond a one button macro and WASD keys.
---
That's what I'm telling everyone, even if you think you won't like classic, you have to experience the chaos of launch day. Its a once in a lifetime experience.
---
Okay, its a twice...
---
I'd rather have no layers at all and 500 players fighting over every spawn in northshire than layering. 
---
They can just remove layering and activate dynamic spawns for the first day.
---
Or worst case have layering just for Day1.
---
Yup I come to rp pvp for the threat of pvp and to see the community. I dont really like to participate but I feel more immersed being surrounded by rpers, or stumbling into an event I didnt know about.
---
I dont want to play in a dead server, no ty.
---
"everyone is gonna die at some time, might as well finish it now."
---
Leaf was I believe introduced in patch 1.4, which would be Phase 2, and Blizzard said that the drop tables of bosses would be accurate for what items were available in each phase. The LBRS Xbow is just easy to obtain and has hit on it, hand cannon does not.
---
Are you roasting male nelves?
---
you are aware that this feeling of freshness will be gone in a week or two with everyone who plan to play 20 hours a day for a week ?
---
Vanilla gets pretty bursty around AQ/Naxx ...
---
Amen.  For me, I never got to play vanilla WoW.  Yeah, sure I want to hit 60 and do some raiding, but the journey mattering is the key part.  It's been forever since the journey has been the key part, rather than the destination (the last time it was for me was, actually, when I started playing).
---
Quick answer: I like roleplaying and roleplayers, and I like classic WoW. Therefore I will play Classic on a RP server. I do not like retail WoW.
---
I thought you meant metal frame, apologies.
---
If those tables fit with the chairs... It's unbelievably perfect
---
True, because Elves evolved from them
---
Welcome to F R E S H
---
This is actually a good point. Layering is bad, but it is necessary overall for the good of the servers long-term.
---
Blinking also prevents this
---
\#no changes
---
What isn't there to understand, not no changes except for things we don't like. We want 0 changes at all and this shouldn't be changed either. Working as intended.
---
Then your net drops :P
---
Yeah from how the stress twat went imma chill out and wait till the population dissipates
---
I always thought the same but Freedom can be easily purged and FAPs do the same so I'm not so sure anymore...
---
Cool, yea it’s always interesting when people silence the nay sayers with effort and dedication
---
yeah, i kinda was aiming at the bigger construct here, missing time. Hey apparently hadnt had enough time to balance azerite gear, balance specs, balance PvP, unfinished warfronts, empty professions etc.  
---
it was just UNFINISHED, fuck, they even left the fucking beta fishing vendor in the game for the first 2 days and didnt fix the reagents he sold afterwards. the entire fish oil market is ruined forever because a lot of people bought guildbanks full of that stuff from said vendor.   
---
Design-wise it was bad yes, but that game wasnt only bad designed, it was unfinished.
---
I feel you bro I'm hyped but I got a demanding job and a fiance. I said to my fiance that I wanna play but would only play it if she played with me. She basically said only if I changed my work so we have more time.
---
A rogue with improved sprint and preparation can break movement impairing effects 4x with two sprints and two vanishes. For that reason, I'd say go dwarf if you plan on having those talents.
---
Basically yes, I don't see the problem with having more servers than necessary at first (let's say for 2 months) and then merging them one by one. It was already told but I would love to have something like :  
---
Varimathras 1  
---
Varimathras 2  
---
Varimathras 3  
---
Varimathras 4  
---
Varimathras 5  
---
That are in fact just different layers of the same server, and you can't shift between these until they have been merged back into one after the "Release"   
---
And you can choose the server/layer of the server whenever you create a character
---
I really hope that no one takes this comment seriously,  because it's a gross exaggeration. I can tell you for a fact that Warlock pet functionality is not "completely broken" at all because I just put 15 hours into one on the stress  test and had no problem whatsoever. The game felt very much like vanilla wow to me, so quit your doomsday bullshit please.
---
I'm hearing rumors of people 0 to mc clear in 5 1/2 days
---
Thank you for your contribution :)
---
Yeah the alternative is they actually add enough servers. And i would prefer having rough ques for a few weeks over layering anytime. I understand that people might have different opinions but thinking that i don't know how que's used to be is false.  
---
If layering is what Actiblizz has learned about launching classic then i'm not playing. People seem to not understand that layering has to do more with $$ and not having dedicated servers instead of running them on layering reliant servers like retail.
---
that's what we were, we had a good mix of people with responsibilities etc. You've just reminded me of the time one of the women in our guild went afk just before we pulled a boss, which wasnt that uncommon as she had a small child, anyways - this time she comes back on vent and shes like 'omg....guys....omg....eeuuuuggghhh...sorry....my son....euuuuuuughhh...just spewed everywhere!...im cleaning it up right now!...euughh' and this is just causing hysterical laughter with half of the guild and a chain reaction half spew across the other half as they hear the horrible noises. good times.
---
And eat a banana.
---
Was getting the same problem at my end and after checking that link I fixed the problem by changing compatibility mode to run in Windows XP / Windows ME.  
---
If you've already got 100% CPU, kill the rundll32.exe process in the task manager.
---
Also, mods are going to delete this because it has nothing to do with Classic; should be in the Private Server sub.
---
As a rogue you can sneak into the enemy cities, where they feel safest, and screw with people. That alone is worth the price of admission for me.
---
It was group only without Sated, so only the big dick caster group got to enjoy it.
---
Dual Specialisation - I just won't be able to afford 50g respecs as often as I'd like (several times a week) as I'll have to save as much gold as I can to buy both parts of Benediction.
---
Trolls make the best mages and shamans in pve settings.
---
That's kinda cool and honestly adds more life to the world. A community event if you will.
---
The correct word in the title should be “were” because the changes are plural. I hate to be a grammar nazi but I was raised by English majors
---
You can have a nice conputer built on an old case
---
I actually agree up to the point they started demanding gold.  It might not be "illegal" or against Blizzard rules, but it just doesn't sit right.
---
You're also absolutely right, the best solution is for another guild to get the scepter and open it up themselves, problem solved.
---
Right, I get so much entertainment value out of my account as I am doing other things, like sleeping....
---
You know what you are right.   I am paying $7 a month for Amazon.  That's 720 hours of entertainment too.   Wait, that's half of what WoW cost.  
---
Wow is expensive.
---
OP was making a joke abou the South Park show, not trying to correctly identify the sword.  Why are you all taking this so seriously?
---
Tanaris. When you got there you just got your mount, your 40 talent and you were out of STV hell. And you got my favourite dungeon ZF to look forwards to. You could feel the beginning of the end when you entered that zone.
---
This is some weird add gatekeeping.
---
I was told it was earthroot. TIL
---
Shamans can dispel disease too :)
---
Check this video out, druid as a main tank is definitely viable with the exception of a few raid bosses. :)
---
https://youtu.be/oyWQlXtkuJ0
---
This sub is great but the mods ruin it
---
That moonkin for the bear form is much easier in classic than on private servers btw.
---
One trick regarding popping potions for druids in classic is that you can make a macro like this:
---
/cast Bear Form
---
/use Health Potion
---
/cast !Bear Form
---
to pop out and back in instantly - so there is zero chance of taking damage in caster form using this macro.
---
Look at this guy, using $Year jokes in $Year.
---
Stoneskin reduces damage taken from melee. There's a totem that removed poison, but even that doesn't work the way you describe.
---
But if you add servers due to overpopulation in starting and low level zones and then the player base thins out, which it will, you have a bunch of dead servers. I don’t think that’s a great option either.  
---
I also think you have a larger population of people who have MAYBE a few hours to play each week, and asking them to wait in line is not realistic. The people playing 10+ hours in one stint are going to be the cast minority, most people have too many other things going on.
---
I am already seeing people talking about addons tracking which layers people are on and linking Arena timers and respawn timers.   
---
So yeah, except if we see Blizzard taking a step saying it's TOS or EULA restricted to change willingly from layer to layer and withdraw many ways to do so, I just can't get on board with this tool
---
Is this sub a meeting or a forum/discussion?
---
Right now they're running a meeting! They have a set agenda of what can and can not be talked about and they're limiting the amount of talk on each subject.  That's a meeting. If that's what they want then they're on the right path
---
If they want a forum where each person has a voice and all the voices together can be counted then they'll need to make some changes and quick.
---
Only the alpha models of them, which sadly won't be playable in Classic WoW.
---
Yeah even BFA had a ton on release.
---
Tanaris, it feels like the first zone where true world PvE starts to occur and it's just a memorable area to me as I spent so much time there back in vanilla.
---
Idk man, when your 3rd stun in a row is resisted by that orc warrior you start to question your choices.
---
I guess to anyone who want's to keep updated with hunters in classic, beta testers, everyone in the Classic hunter discord and for sure to Blizzard since all of these has been reported multiple times by beta testers.
---
if you can observe it. problem is you won't be in ungoro 3 days after release, but the abusers will.
---
Male trolls, hands down.
---
&gt; Because in the real working world, you will do extra time to make sure he gets his toy or else you can search for a new job.
---
I would most certainly be brushing up my resume.  You are talking about 45 hours + whatever Saturday is, I assume 8 or 9 hours based on the rest of your post.  Any job I've ever worked 50+ hours a week was a job I wanted to work those hours, mostly for the additional overtime pay.
---
Slap his ass back from afar as I kite the shit outta him on my druid FC.
---
Hey man I totally agree, I had a "Low effort meme" taken down where I applied text over a South park image saying "Me and the Boys heading to classic" with the 4 WoW characters from make love not warcraft, and then someone just posted a image of the boys sitting in their chairs with no text and just a title and it was allowed to stay up.
---
So tbh idk.
---
Holy shit that’s amazing thanks for sharing.
---
Because real life happens on the weekends. Raid 2 days during the week, go to the gym the other 3, enjoy evening weekends with your friends/family and other obligations.
---
There was some hacky fuckery you could do though I think
---
i mean yeah you can do it. But you can't get TF!
---
The wave was inside us all along
---
It's likely they have all of the bug reports they can handle and address, so adding more people to the beta duplicating existing bug reports isn't going to help anything.
---
Sounds like a actiblizz problem. I guess the game was never designed for a mega server. I won’t be loosing money if people abandon servers. What if everyone stops playing completely and their is only a need for one server? Who knows- layering was never in classic WoW, sharding whatever you call it. It completely ruins the experience. That small tight knit community everyone loves and cried for won’t be there. If there is a “static layer of a server” that you cannot wham bam poof out of that’s cool as ITZ mentioned. Being able to blatantly abuse the game mechanics by getting friends to invite to another layer is trash. The game will fold on itself- and I can see blizzard not getting rid of it if no one complains because they are greedy and Sounds like a actiblizz problem.

---

Weekend plans are too subject to change while during the week, everyone pretty much knows they will be home from work and available.
---
When I got into the first stress test I got the email an hour before the servers shut down
---
“As a working adult” That’s your problem right there.
---
Friday/saturday is usually inconsistent for people as there is events that happen there. It's much easier to form a schedule around a week day or sunday where you can consistently show up.
---
Great post, very nice research! 
---
Take my upvote.... and my axe!

For anyone still unsure about pvp realms. I tried a pserver to see if I would like pvp servers. Around level 25 or so I knew I wanted to do it... a lot. I rerolled a hunter leveled him to 29 and became the Ashenvale Guardian. I would see where the horde were ganking alliance and rally a group of lowbies to clear them out. I made friends with the levelers and they would wave to me as I passed. I watched generations of Alliance come and go, join my groups and return to questing. It was absolutely my favorite pvp experience I've had in a game. The times I got ganked and the anger I felt at the annoying level 60s pales in comparison to the fun I had with that first Ashenvale raid.
---
Somehow implying that it's either layering or queues and there is no alternatives at all!
---
Alliance is closer to Blackrock for t1 and t2 but horde has better placement for zg(grom gol), aq (tb) and naxx (uc)
---
ok, so if it's fair you want a company to pay for extra overheard. Will you feel the same about extra servers if they raise the price to play? Expectations on "paying for something extra so i can get what I want" to be put on someone else is a very childish thing to do. It cost money to spin up and spin down servers. it cost labor to pay admins/engineers to do all this. Buying internet is expensive. The fact that people are tossing away a good compromise over  "wHy dOnT tHeY jUsT sPeND mOaR MuNNy?!?" just shows their lack of experience waiting on a 3-6 hour queue.
---
Pretty impressive in vanilla? 
---
Nah fam you could walk up to a 60 and just have a nice convo with them and then ask them for some help and could get ppl to say yes 
---
The community is just different now
---
No. Wow is not expensive. Jfc. Mmo subscriptions are among the cheapest entertainment you get. So is netflix
---
You won't be seeing anyone anyway with all the sharding.
---
It's a completely different client.
---
This is why I am going to play again. I played the end of BC through cataclysm and a smidge of Pandaria. I have like 7 characters at 80+. I just feel like I’d be so far behind in all aspects if I tried to play retail now. 
---
I’m excited for a fresh start to the economy as well. Think about it, no one is loaded with gold. No one has high level characters to go farm crafting materials with. The auction house won’t be flooded with rare items.
---

Done
---
Hey, I support layering. But the EU server thing is a very big deal for many people. Please don't talk it down like that :b
---
WSG isn’t in first phase
---
Damage for trying to 1 hit the level 10's. Stamina for trying to beat the other twinks.
---
Won't the community be affected by having it the way ITZ said you will get new populations randomly merged onto you - you won't know these people and they won't know you. So you can't even interact with them prior to it happening, it would flood their economy with objects on the AH etc.
---
We saw back during the original period of the game what happened with server merges and the different etiquette that each server had led to clashes.
---
It also creates a feedback loop where the management thinks they just need more overtime to fix all the shit.  It's basically one sign that your company is not that good to begin with.  Like, as an investor, I would not invest in a company that is straining their workforce.  Turnover is usually too high to maintain quality employs or produce innovation.
---
&gt; I'm aware there are ways to exploit layering, but personally, I'd take a slightly fragmented world over sitting ontop of lazy peon spawns competing against thousands of people in durotar to complete a fucking quest.
---
A "slightly fragmented world" kills the server if it's permanent. All they need to say is "this will be for a month", "this will be starter zones only", something. The radio silence is worrying people.
---
Personally I think blizzard has absolutely no idea how many people will play so they are hedging their bets as long as possible.
---
As somebody who's a project manager (in construction not programming) we don't all have the attitude of throwing more people at a job means it happens faster. 
---
There is a fine line between too few people and too many people.
---
Stone**form** makes you immune from instant poison. From the game's perspective instant poison proc is a "debuff" that ticks a single time. You're immune from poison debuffs, thus it cannot proc on you for 8 seconds.    
---
This along with the armor increase, means for 8 glorious seconds, you'll see quite a significant damage reduction against a Rogue.
---
You can enter MC as early as 50 or 55 IIRC.
---
That is true but WPvP will be at its highest in before BG's giving the alliance the advantage for that point in the expansion for raids.
---
It doesn't really exploit the economy at all. There's a set amount of layers and you cannot recreate them. All you can do is switch between them, but ultimately there is x amount of resources for every 3k pop. Having 10 people lock down on the farm for the entire 12k (or whatever pop the total server will be), doesn't create more devilsaurs, it just means a small number of people have it.
---
Then you go watch TV instead of playing wow and everybody is happy, why are you barking here?
---
...you realize that’s how reddit works, right? Mods are there to help maintain the quality of the posts and discussion on a subreddit.
---
It’s not so I don’t have to think, it’s because I’m confident they can identify what are reposts, shitposts, and all the karma farming bullshit that gets posted on here and they can remove it.
---
Servers clusters have downsides yes, but they arent by any margin worse than layering. And it would be just as temporary as layering. Layering ruins classic for alot of people.
---
Dude. Fuck. Yes. Great setup man. This made my week!! Glad you got it all worked out brother!
---
rofl, how was that in the least bit aggressive? god
---
Could care less about the spelling burn.
---
I'm not even slightly surprised in regards to Addons being able to track it. Someone will make that, for sure. Blizz could add something to essentially Alert them to accounts with any Addon that ties into their Layering I suppose. Even if they say they're tracking it, it'll be hard to tell. It's only an invite away outside of an addon, right? I suppose if they see people doing it frequently, they should know especially based on their expectation of how often layers change for individuals. At the same time I could see some collateral damage occurring with the .001% of people that just get caught in a weird void of switching layers. They're putting it in regardless it seems, so, most of these layering conversations are pointless.
---
The thing is a layer is a server - this is what people don't understand having more layers isn't them saving money all of its virtual nowadays, they aren't the servers that some people got for charity auctions.
---
Layers are in place to maintain the survival of servers in the long term as Blizzard expects most of the initial wave not to continue with Classic because nothing will roll over into BFA. They expect BFA players to use it maybe during lulls at the very most and that they will have a small number (in comparison to the numbers playing retail) to play Classic long term.
---
Now they might get proven wrong but we will have to see.
---
aware
---
Game, set, match.
---
Notice how the beta STILL hasn't implemented players' key chains because key chains and database information related to it was completely removed from retail a long time ago. The only reason they were able to bring back talent trees relatively easily is because the current talent system uses the same infrastructure as the original one did just simplified.
---
The other problem is that you simply can't believe anything Blizzard says. They claim to have a reference client and whenever someone points out something fishy, they just say "Oh we compared it, and our shady ass beta which has all kinds of problems is definitely 100% accurate. Believe us." 
---
Yeah no. It's a little too easy to say that, and they've been saying it a little too often given how obviously different it is from the original client.
---
Gaybro here. Feel free to add me man. Pics and stuff on my profile (rated G lol)
---
It’s a rough life.. but someone’s gotta live it
---
I play Hunter in BFA. I really didn't realize how much I took for granted on the class until I tried Hunter in the Classic Stress Test. 
---
What bugs the most is that the only stuff that scales is Aimed Shot, Multishot, and Autoshot. Arcane and Serpent scale with spell damage, and pets don't scale at all. They really modernized Hunters for TBC, but in Classic it's painful. 
---
Long story short, I love Pet classes, but I think I'll get more mileage out of Warlock.
---
One of the most exciting times in WoW for me was the launch of the Cairne server.  Pretty sure it was during TBC, but it was FRESH and FRESH is always BEST.
---
So? Does that change anything about what selling out is? Do I have to be happy that they took that offer? What's your point?
---
Could've sold to a company that's not known for running developer companies into the ground. They chose that this money is more important to them than their product. Yes it happens, I don't need to celebrate them doing it, though.
---
 Just find a working professionals guild who raids on the weekend (sober being optional) for a nice reprieve from life.
---
So, what is it you think you are paying for that justifies the pricetag of $15 a month?
---
Looks legit!
---
Do tell.
---
Yea grom gol beats out the alliance camp in stv, desolace, badlands with kargath instead of running down from loch modan, swamp of sorrows with stonard, feralas, felwood central placement, better FP in winterspring, stonetalen mountains, I even prefer the horde story in ashenvale.
---
Why can a UD mage kite a gnome mage better than they can back?
---
I chirp him because he didn’t finish the STV tourney and he’s missing the hat.
---
I chirp him because he doesn’t have enchants on his weapon.
---
I can already tell from here that he doesn’t have the Arena trinket.
---
Then I beat him on my hunter duel after duel once we leave WSG as he gets frustrated and says how much cooler his life is than mine and all I do is play WoW.
---
You're exactly right about Blizz wanting more more money... who doesn't. But since they work backward from legion to develop classic instead of working forward from 1.12, i suspect it would have been way more development time and that isn't free. So while we can all speculate, I think Blizz's bean counters are probably better than ours.
---
Company I work for staffs a small amount of additional workers each shift and will ask for volunteers to leave early when things are slow or smooth, but they have the ability to retain those employees in case workload increases.
---
Some people love getting off early or being able to easily fit in an appointment without having to take vacation time or a reprimand to accomplish.  Productivity is same, but less overtime is paid because the additional work hours from overhiring are offset by the volunteers leaving daily.
---
When do they announce the delay? As soon as they announce any date in the first place, people set up vacations from work. So a delay is going to ruin all that. A whole lot of people would be screaming about it.
---
Ah well ill be in that life with you my friend as soon as we go live, stay strong :)
---
I did a male NE rogue myself. The extra stealth level was awesome for PvP and duels against other rogues. It allowed me to murderize a decked out t3 gnome rogue with mostly blues and greens via stunlock. He hated it, his guild found it hilarious and took me on team BGs for until BC started. Never underestimate the power of stealthed stealth! 
---
I think this started the fall of my guild since it made me want to go back to my rogue instead of staying the primary guild healer on my dwarf priest....my bad.  Ah memories!
---
there is not a single spec that is useless. every spec/class has its place somewhere in the game, this just proves your inexperience.
---
Rosetta Stone
---
My Druid had so much health with that offhand and the STV hat.
---
The tunic is possible since he had barman's shanker and that piece also drops off the same boss.
---
So by your math, organized horde beats everything? I agree!
---
Enjoy your single player game!

All of what you said is nonsense, lol. They release it on a weekday because they have more people on hand for problems that will arise.

Well shit, hunter was my main in TBC and I was looking forward to nostalgia.
---
The chairs just come with cup holders?
---
This was a hot topic that was brought up to me the other night.  Based on the tweet  [https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641)), I am expecting loot being dropped by bosses to be much different in Phase 1 than in Phase 2; i.e. Majordomo's chest won't exist until Phase 2.
---
As much flack as some users may give the idea, my team and I actually look forward to this.  It means there isn't a huge power creep right at the start.  A slow rolling experience for us to enjoy.
---
Some users I've talked to say this will cause massive burnout.  Others say that this ideally follows the power creep we experienced back in Vanilla.
---
Honestly, it's all going to come down to how long Phase 1 is.  And while "experts" say it will only be 1 month, there are others that state it will be 3 months.  Me?  I have no idea.  I'm just looking to ride the wave.
---
If you decide not to play because of layering, you were always going to end up quitting the game. You’d find minuscule detail that isn’t the same and quit over it.
---
This was common back in vanilla also happened on my realm jaedenar
---
Out of every game release this year, nothing excites me more than this.
---
yikes, a meme among memers.
---
You name the servers Kargath 1, 2, 3 etc.
---
. and when they become low pop they collapse just like layers. It's basically layers but you cant hop between them to abuse the system.
---
I'm actually interested in an RP PVP realm for the first time ever because of my experience in a private server recently. I got so into some light RP that a group was doing when we were hunting horde in Ashenvale. Just the simple shout of the raid leader to regroup to Maestra's Post and the responses of "Aye Captain". Or the final "Push them back to their camp!" As we ran them down and held them at their gates. It was so cool lol, but I don't know if I can convince my friends to follow. (Or if it will even exist.)
---
Lol you should really take a step back and look at how flustered you are over a simple conversation about chairs and tables 
---
This is not normal behavior.
---
Druid is the jack of all trades, master of none.
---
You can pretty much do everything in the game, but you aren't gonna be the best at it. In a way druid is the best class because of this, yet in another way its the worst class, because its shit at everything except flag running in WSG.
---
Hahahaha amazing 🤣 sounds like a really fun guild!
---
My point was that the "golden age of WoW" was exactly what most people think RUINED the game.
---
Yes, classic feels more difficult and makes you think more before making a move.
---
I was home from Iraq on mid tour leave a few days before release.  I played it to level 9 on my mage, said "cool", then logged out and got back on Everquest.  But that was mostly from the sunken cost fallacy, since my monk was epiced and had a lot of Plane of Time gear.  The AAs were just so vast that I felt I needed to really catch up on them.  But came back early February and played on WoW with everyone in the barracks for the entire leave break.  We were viciously jealous when one of the guys got his mount before us.  Also, I walked into a buddy's room and saw him playing Playstation laying on the bed, turned to see his laptop and shaman killing mobs.  Looked at him, looked back... WTF.  He was botting a horde character to outlevel and camp the rest of us.
---
I’m also excited for launch. I didn’t start Vanilla until Christmas of 2004. It’s not the same as that initial launch day.
---
I’m ready for this.
---
Dont forget cleansing disease, and purging seals and blessings.
---
You're right about how PvP shakes out usually. 
---
I was more or less talking about hypotheticals, considering the boom that is expected. It's a feeling since the multiple polls don't accurately count the sudden influx of players from retail and that are coming back, only the ones that are here. My only basis is retail, where Horde absolutely crushed Alliance in all content aspects, PvP and PvE on majority of the PvP servers.
---
Well there isn’t
---
I would not make the Auction house separated if I were to do something like that, as you mention the economy would suffer from that.   
---
Tbf the layering "solution" is a huge middle finger to the build up of an economy like it was before in classic. People are already talking about farming the devilsaur again and again by jumping layers. Let's not talk about compo farming  
---
I am totally against layering, and I would most likely prefer the respawn timer being upped as we saw on multiple extension by now. For the unique reason that a flow of new people will come in.  
---
And that is only if they put a limited amount of server in there.  
---
The best way to deal with this would be having X servers than automatically block people joining them for 5 seconds if their pop is +/- 50 people than the others servers. Making people joining at random if they don't want to play with friend or don't know where they are heading. And for people that want to play together, you just have to push your way through a bit and try to join the server you want.  
---
But here the main problem would be the number of servers and the max pop in each one of them.  
---
I would prefer that by a large margin tbh
---
That never happened on my realm in vanilla.  But i hope there’s more antics like that!  That’s hilarious
---
Pretty normal for the internet. Sad, but normal.
---
What if I played a troll rogue throughout all of vanilla? And I regretted it often bc armor didn’t look that sweet on my hunched, big foot, lanky-boi? I just loved their personalities haha
---
The great and humble Bobby B. Baratheon, that's what. Who, I mean.

**&lt;LEGACY&gt;  \[A\]\[PVE\]\[EU\]** 
---
**Guild:** Legacy
---
**Server:** TBD
---
**Servertype:** PvP
---
**Who we are:** Formed by a group of older players (28 – 35 years of age) who played World of Warcraft off and on since the first public beta. Raided in Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, Cata and Legion. We have experience in guild and raid leading from 40 to 10 man.
---
**Raiding days and times:** Wednesday / Thursday / Sunday /Monday - 20:00 to 23:00 CEST (final days will be decided later on)
---
**Our Goal:** Take some time to level up and then steadily progress through the content. We want to form a team of people who know their class and get satisfaction from playing it to the best of their ability.
---
**Plan of action:** We will pick a pvp server, where we will form a guild and start leveling up. And when we have enough people at the appropriate level, we’ll start the attunements and gearing up to head into Molten Core and go from there.
---
**What we expect from you when raiding:** Keep to the raiding times, be prepared and stocked with the needed pots, food, etc. Know your class, and know how to gear it. The more prepared we are, the faster our progress is.
---
**Loot system:** We will be using Loot council, based on attendance.
---
**Who are we looking for:** People who want to get the most out of the limited time they have to play WoW. Players old and new are welcome. Previous Vanilla experience is nice, but it isn’t a prerequisite. Being able to commit to our raiding days/times and keep to them, otherwise we will need to replace you. Ability to communicate on a mature level through discord. Be open to get help and help others to advance the raiding team.
---
**Interested?** Send me a PM or leave a comment for more information. Or join us on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/QXeWg78
---
Where does it say that?
---
This sounds like a pretty good idea, but honestly layering seems so bad that just removing it is better than keeping it. Sure 1-10 will be a bit of a shit show for a day, but it's better than the game being a shit show for weeks.
---
There are plenty of alternatives lol.
---
A) Multiple splits of the same server that eventually is merged back again
---
B) High pop launch, optionally with dynamic spawns.
---
This is amazing haha I’ve never heard of this before
---
Had the physical game discs early. Was able to have account ready and log in almost as soon as it went live. Got the name Mia on Earthen Ring. Did a /who and saw no one else on. Went to bed.
---
Proceeded to then be unable to play because shortly after was when the now legendary queues and servers on fire happened. I likely could have leveled out of the zone and been away from everyone. Of course, I only played on that server for like 2 weeks before I realized none of my friends were there like they said.
---
I really wish the series had been finished, honestly if murloc RPG 3 was released I would be almost as excited for it as classic.
---
Which is why I think there really would be an argument to be made for those. Especially since if the population decline doesn't go according to Blizzard's expectations server clusters as I see it provide a more flexible way to handle that than layering. But honestly? The idea is simple enough. It's been mentioned everywhere. Blizzard knows about it and for whatever reason, it seems they're not considering it.
---
So I've made my peace. Layering is a solution and one that isn't the end of the world, really. I'm hoping they fix worst of the abuses but even if they don't it's a temporary thing.
---
Except the launch day chaos won't be there will it? With sharding of the first few zones that chaos unfortunately won't be seen by many.
---
I mean, having Shadowmeld does grant a boost to stealth.
---
I'm jealous. My wife only cares about lying to the world via Instagram.
---
i love the fact that there are still people who think they were serious. i played on frostwolf on alliance side and i knew that they would open it a week later in the middle of the night. they did this because they didnt want other guilds to disturb their raiding progress(no lags). everyone in the top guilds got informed
---
layering doesn't prevent this, it might even make it worse
---
Dude there absolutely are garbage specs that aren't viable anywhere. We have a road map for what _balance_ with in the Vanilla mindset looks like, and its Burning Crusade talent trees. 
---
That said, if you want to take it slower, I think Blizzard just needs better itemization and it would help the struggling specs _enough_ that they can be somewhat viable for the majority of content.
---
As a family dude, all of your obligations happen on weekends. Birthday parties, weddings, cookouts. It's just not a consistent time to be around. On the other hand because the next day is a workday, I know I'll be around at 8:00PM on a Tuesday.
---
The other guilds used their resources to help the terrorist guild and got backstabbed IIRC

---
This is the best part of vanilla WoW imo.  Even back then, I would jump on a new realm opening up just to relive the "fresh" feeling.
---
The world PvP is so fun when everyone is leveling up.
---
Lying about? You brought it up, now I have to know.
---
Maybe next time add a timezone to those Charts
---
Uh...yea? Even operating at a non-profit level companies need enough revenue to continue operations. But sounds like you have it all figured out dude. Hopefully you become an exec where I work.
---
&gt; All the bitter people saying these bugs won't be looked at in the two months we have left blows my mind how salty people get
---
You are new to Blizzard's beta process then, I assume? You're in for a ride.
---
I love WOW but retail is no longer an MMO. It still has tons of players but you don’t need them for anything but raids now. You can solo everything while leveling and never worry about dying. Mana potions are useless because no one can even go OOM anymore. I want that experience when I first started playing WOW again, needing help and joining random players to accomplish the same goal.
---
Wow players generally dont have jobs or at least not very involved ones it seems. Im with you OP. Weekends are best for me by a mile. No way im raiding Mon-thurs i work 11 hour days and need gym time
---
Come on man it's not THAT often. It's only once ever 11 minutes.
---
MOAR OF IT KEEP IT COMING FRESH MEMES WELCOME
---
Once all the servers are merged who cares? You may have to learn new people that’s fine- but I’m
---
Sure there will be a list of turds (I use to write names on a notepad for classic) that you didn’t wanna be around. As far as server crashes that’ll go away once they merge it’s not permanent. Layering? It may never go away, that is completely up to actiblizz. 
---
Not only this but why not just put time and resources into a World of Diablo? In the image and design of classic WoW? World of Starcraft whatever- instead of diablo immortal poo. Why? It’s too risky and they could looze money as it would also compete with retail WoW. Don’t even have to be that dramatic - bring back classic into retail. Bring back the talent trees, gameplay, etc. too much to name.
---
I’d would of much rather like to hear that for the next expansion or a World of Diablo than a mobile “Diablo Immortal” that followed market trends. Diablo on my phone that is a re-skinned hash of all the other action rpg games on mobile? I don’t even like mobile games - idk who does but it’s def geared to dip into more people’s pockets.
---
The frame work for classic WoW is there and they took forever to finally to do it after seeing private servers. Quick and easy cash grab that wasn’t too costly.
---
Screw that it’s not a NEW game it’s RE Releasing a game, it better be damn near perfect. Screw New Blizzard... I mean Activision.
---
In one the videos someone interviewed them. They're just 3 brothers. They never gave a reason.
---
Man... most of those clips are from Karmond.  People like him... ya know who actually test stuff in a beta... deserver to be recognized.
---
Could you or couldn't you? :)
---
I agree about leveling, i always opted for high rate vanilla pservers  because it was absolutely not enjoyable at all for me. But I think it will be atleast a little bit better on retail due to more english speaking players, high pop realms and much less bugs. But I don't see why so many people think leveling is fun or a part of the "journey". I've never enjoyed it, I'm more of a PvP player though, all i want to do is hit 60, and get engineering then get some blues. Once I've got that I'm set to just spam BG's all day.
---
Except linking things outside of reddit is kind of what reddit was made for in the first place?
---
when your guild has made some progress and in Phase 3/4, you maybe can get a ZG raid full on saturdays :)
---
BWL won't even be released the first month, but every raid will definitely be on farm within a month of its release. Hardcore guilds will be getting Onyxia drops from the first week onward. 
---
You have to figure that Dire Maul will be released before BWL. A lot of the items in it were ridiculously good. So basically people will be going into BWL with two pieces of tier 2, the best blues available, people largely getting 60fps, better network connections. 
---
Yeah. Even mediocre guilds are going to melt content. I have the feeling that Activision is going to gate the SHIT out of the raids just because of how fast people will clear them and the fact that I bet almost none of them work and they're having to scramble to make sure all the boss scripts run correctly.
---
If they had just opened up Naxx on day one, every boss in the game would have been cleared within the first month without question.
---
Almost every problem you'll encounter with reddit can be fixed by using old reddit.

Ohh I see what your suggesting its different to others rather each server has a block of layers that are not freely swappable but you can choose to join X when you login.
---
That could arguably work I guess. Though I don't know the logistical side for Blizzards server architecture.
---
I would suspect the biggest issue might be the whole join 1,2,3,4 or 5 etc. Also the concerns of the dev's that it would prevent friends playing together due to the +/- 50 thing.
---
Gnome rogue. Mainly because removing snares is a bigger deal than stoneforming blind or a bleed imo. Also, rogue vs rogue are normally determined by who gets the open, and since you're alliance it's not like you will be fighting against dwarf rogues in bgs and world PvP.
---
But... It kinda depends on what you want to do. If world PvP with very minimal bgs/ranking is your goal I'd almost say dwarf is stronger. In bgs however, and vs a rogues most annoying match up, escape artist is king imo, esp in wsg.
---
Big mood.
---
Different client.  
---
You are on the wrong sub here, with your issues.
---
It will be a financial success for Blizzard as many, many will play and continue to play. Will the gaming experience offered live up to expectations? Unfortunately I doubt it.
---
Expectations are sooooo high and the amount of muscle Blizzard has get less and less with each passing year. Decisions like layering will hugely affect the experience.
---
My prediction. Classic will be very much worth playing but it won't be Vanilla or as close as we'd like it to be. We'll bitch and moan (and play) and bitch and moan (and play) some more.
---
Bloodlust / Heroism basically created an interesting dynamic with DPS that makes it stronger the shorter you can make a fight.
---
I think TBC was when almost all boss fights were pretty freaking long, but many fights in Vanilla could be done in like 3-4 minutes. Getting that down to 2 would make BL/H so freaking strong and something to work towards.
---
There was no p2w back then, it didn't exist at all.
---
Lineage 2, EverQuest, wow was definitely not the first of its kind

---
Warlock pets can unlearn all talented abilities when unsummoned. You're right... Very minor...
---
Why would they when there’s already a discord for every class in classic?
---
They love layering kek
---
I believe undead shadow priest is the best for pvp due their unique skill.
---
Knowledge really helps, when levelling don't buy every skill, it's very pricey! Buy the things you need and use.
---
But the big overarching reasoning that I believe is behind virtually every classic supporter is simply that working for something feels rewarding.
---
Everything else is a subpoint or facet of that I feel.
---
I had undead priest back in vanilla.
---
Devouring plague is really nice in pvp. 
---
Pvp i would go Undead. 
---
Pve i would go troll.
---
oh shit oh fuck
---
except Kargath 1 will be twice as big as 2 and 3 combined because everyone wants to start where all their friends started (which is most likely the first server).  
---
Kargath 1 would have the same but slightly weaker problems than normal servers without layering.
---
Found the Reddit police! 
---
No wonder this sub is full of downvotes.
---
Reminds me when a guy sits in the left lane doing the speed limit to “enforce it” lol
---
Shaz was actually buffed, he didn't have a blink ability so you would just tank him and have ranged kill him while went afk.
---
This is awesome. Thanks so much for taking the time to post it!

I still play BFA but Im thinking of Classic the entire time.

Considering many of us have grown up with wow and become responsible adults, it’s just that we’ve learned time management and how to prioritize. We aren’t the stereotypical wow nerd of 15 years ago (anymore).
---
They have *already stated* a bunch of times that layering isn't permanent.
---
There aren't a "long line" of people even playing bfa..lol    
---
Its people who have mutliple accounts for some reason.People like swifty who have 10 wow accounts active so they can get a bunch of beta invites to multi box are what is going on.

There is a reason they don't release sub numbers now.

a) people wouldnt spread between those servers if they cant switch back and forth. the first server would be completely packed and would have nearly the same problems as servers without layers.  
---
b) dynamic respawns can be abused aswell unless they add a fuckton of exceptions and limitations. Layering could be even better if they add enough exceptions and limitations, which they didnt do yet. Hopefully layering doesnt go live like its on the beta right now.

I started late in classic. I never did hit 60 before BC, but there were no meta data sites, no addons..really no way to know anything but to play, explore, and learn (WHERE THE HELL IS MANKRIK’S WIFE!!!) 
---
My first 2-3 days playing I meleed everything with a wand..no spells, no ranged..melee attacks..lol. Keybinds???? What the hell are those??? There’s an auction house??? What do you mean “Have I been to Orgrimmar? ” What the hell is Orgrimmar? It took me probably a month to save up 1 gold because I kept buying the dumbest gear thinking I was upgrading...lol. But the experience was real. It was brand new. And while I’m going into it with knowledge this time, you can’t rush the experience. It takes however long it takes. I can’t wait!!
---
If you build your lock right, one single fear break and short immunity shouldn't make a whole fight. 
---
Warlocks like.. counter warlocks with felhunter, shadow resist on their armor, shadow resist on lots of their tier gear, and the shadow damage shield skill. If that fight is short enough to make WOTF decide it you built your lock wrong.

Can I have some money?
---
I recently went on a private server to try out some classes to see what I'll go for when classic launches and was lucky enough to catch the launch of a new server with several thousand people going at it right when it launches. There is something beautiful about small groups of 4-5 people forming around the spawn point of every mob, inviting each other into groups and spawn killing them over and over again (said server decreases spawn times as population in an area increases). Items that only one person can loot at a time are a real pain in the ass though, sometimes a line forms and all is well, but most of the time it's 20+ people standing in a ball and spam right clicking. 
---
It is the kind of experience you only get on launch and I really hope that layering is not so extreme that you won't have this experience in classic at all.

Truth

I posted about how good it felt to do a jogger raid on the stress test in a raid full of lvl 1s... got deleted for being low effort. Fuck me for being excited about the game that this subreddit is about?
---
Taking pride in being an angry internet person is definitely the mental gymnastics move I expected from you 
---
Well played 🙄
---
You would be locked into that layer after creating a character. Chaining the auction house to all layers might prove bad but only if neckbeards have alts and a lot of free time across all layers. By that time though hopefully all layers would be merged.
---
...and consumes...and engineering.
---
Yeah, good times. Problem is, there isnt that much left to find out. Im sure there are certain things left which are different from private servers and not yet fully explored/theorycrafted, but id guess 99,5% of the game is known by now.
---
subpar "retail bad classic good" karma whoring
---
color me surprised.
---
Stupid class anyways. Sounds good to me!
---
Businesses get to do whatever they want. There isn't anymore to it. Call the Better Business Bureau or your congressman. A business will keep it's clients happy or they will leave. In the case of Classic it will need to appeal to the more hardcore player to continue. Clearly they will try not to disappoint their core but if they do then we can play private servers.  If they make the game "Disneyland", which I highly doubt they will, then it's easy to go play something else. This isn't communism. You see this anxiety with every beta mmo for any hyped game. Nobody owes us shit. I knew when I resubbed that I might not get in. So be it!

&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Horde has racials that were tailored for PvP, most of them are to deal damage (will of the forsaken aside), alliance racials are support.  
---
In world pvp will matter if the alliance have a holy pala or not, if they have a holy pala horde lose, if they don't have a holy pala horde wins. FoL holy paladin spam are op as fuck.
---
Hey now, be honest, the free jump is Max level -10(110 right now) so you only level through current content. 
---
I came back after stopping in Cata when they announced classic to see what it was like. The free jump was to 100 then. I had a lot of fun for a bit in Legion, then the lack of community really started boring me, especially when BFA hit and the classes just seemed empty without artifacts giving them unique features. I felt like each class was the same as another of the same type. It feels like there are only four classes -tanks, dps, ranged dps, and healers. Just play a monk, druid, or paladin to have almost everything covered. I lasted a month in BFA before I stepped back out again and said I was done....now I keep looking at Classic again lol
---
IMO Gnome is the best race for PVP as a lock anyway. Stun resist on orc is ok but a reliable, fairly short CD for Vanilla root and slow removal is HUGE. Locks have no real way of slowing enemies so Between dispelling magic slows with felhunter and the Gnome racial, you can gain tons of control in a fight.
---
I can run retail on a 4 year old i5 (not sure on gen) with no discrete graphics card. It runs smoothly at graphics level 4 (looks rough though). I can't say for certain but I think you will be able to play it just fine.

This is what I’m most excited for. Fresh start to the best game ever.

What happens to duplicate names when the servers merge?

Uh 700k is a pretty damn impressive amount of views though
---
Probably a combination of many folks not wanting to give up weekend nights when they prefer to go out, the gravitational pull of Tuesday resets tending to push teams that are trying to be competitive to raiding Tuesday / Wednesday, and at least some of the population of players that are most into raiding being in school or unemployed, so that late nights on weekdays are not an issue.
---
That said, there are weekend guilds, mostly filled with folks like you for whom weekend raid nights just fit much better around other things. They're not as abundant as weekday teams, but there are plenty that run Saturday / Sunday or (less common) Friday / Saturday schedules.
---
*Mandark
---
Because my life sucks.
---
That depends what your definition of "garbage" and "broken" is.
---
The variability of different situations is so big, that saying a spec is flat-out 'good' or 'bad', is far too coarse and unspecific. 
---
It all comes down to "what are we balancing towards?". When WOW became a phenomenon, Blizzard explicitly began balancing towards two things above all: end-game raiding, and arena. That's the "timeline" we've already had for the last decade. So if you're looking for a WOW where balance in raiding and organized PVP gets priority over everything else -- you kinda already got it in BFA.
---
Classic WOW became reality, precisely because many people objected to that vision. When it comes to diversity, Vanilla is still king. I sat yesterday and toyed around with Priest talents, and realized I could spec in a dozen different ways, tweaking little details depending on whether I was in group/solo, doing PVE/PVP, in raids or out in the open world, and so on.
---
That doesn't mean Vanilla is perfect, but neither was TBC -- each change just overhauled the meta and switched around the pecking order. Resilience got implemented because people disliked the fast pace of Vanilla PVP -- but it ultimately made DOTs too powerful. So they changed it to affect DOTs, and suddenly the game was all about outlasting and slowplay, and bursting/crits were out of question.
---
I was under the impression that's exactly what people were longing for in Classic: tinkering with specs, classes, items and gear to create something fun and original, even if it meant sacrificing the utopian ideal of perfect balance.
---
49 is a Warrior twink bracket.  You get your instant and your mount plus you can finally get some hit gear.
---
Horde has WotF, Alliance has paladins. In BGs and group PvP, that comes out to about even for warlocks. Also, since Alliance locks are rarer, you'll get geared faster, and a bit of gear advantage trumps racials easily.
---
This post is ignorant as fuck
---
It looks like the point is both have different positives. Retail is ahead on the storytelling aspects and classic is ahead on MMO elements.
---
The forums kept telling me not to expect the same meta as those trash private servers I was playing on!
---
I was in a Naxx raiding guild and we still had some soccer moms in the raid with potato PCs who were essentially doing no DPS. They were only there because their husbands were healers or someone important. You can actually look at videos and see people keyboard turning and just standing around even on Naxx kills. It's a laugh.
---
If you actually had 40 even mediocre players with PCs capable of hitting monitor refresh framerates, every raid including Naxx would be a joke.
---
I'm LAUGHING at people who actually think you're going to have to go all out on world buffs and consumables. It's going to be way easier than people think.
---
Seriously, a large chunk of bosses in Naxx are actually freebies. Even guilds who couldn't kill C'Thun could get Noth, Razuvious, Anub, Grand Widow, and Maexxna.
---
If there were even 10 people in the raid that weren't retarded, Heigan was a freebie too.
---
Loatheb, Gothik, 4 Horsemen, Patchwerk, Thaddius, Sapphiron, and KT were the only non trivial bosses in Naxx. And of those, a lot of them are a joke mechanically but truly did need gear.
---
The other thing that you can't underestimate, and it only became clear with hindsight, is that many people were absolutely idiotic when it came to gear acquisition. A lot of people in my guild just passed on items because they didn't want to waste DKP on them even though they were actually important upgrades because they didn't even understand which gear was the best for progression. I'm not expecting people to be that retarded the next go around.
---
Saturday's are to random where as weekdays tend to follow a set schedule, for most anyway
---
That's very interesting, do you have that spreadsheet on google docs? If so, I'd love to take a look at it
---
The only changes I noticed were mostly interface-related. Like being able to mail more than one item, autoloot without holding shift (interface toggle), suggest an invite to a group, loot sharing (that 2hr trade window for party members) for major raid instances only (MC, BWL, etc).
---
You don't have to do the quests, you know. You can just kill things to level. Unless you're a warlock who needs to get the imp--that quest you must do.
---
Unlike alliance where dwarfs are clear cut above the rest the racial's for horde in most cases won't matter. That odd scenario where you'll gain an edge is so small that it's honestly not worth it. Play a race that'll appeal to you and don't force yourself to commit to playing something you "hate" for min-maxing purposes because like I said, that odd time where you'll benefit from it doesn't happen enough to justify playing something you won't like.
---
For me personally, I cannot for the life of me stand the troll aesthetic nor their casting animations. That's why I would roll a female UD priest. For you that might be different.
---
I beg to differ on them not being any worse.
---
With layering the economy and community remains just that servers economy and community. With clustering you are merging economies and communities.
---
If the argument is what community is there in a month? Well then why does layering matter?
---
If it’s what economy is there in a month? Then why does layering matter?
---
Outside of breaking immersion while playing merging servers is in fact worse than layering.
---
&gt;ok, so if it's fair you want a company to pay for extra overheard. Will you feel the same about extra servers if they raise the price to play? 
---
Fuck yeah that's fair! We are paying them each month for a product and it's not unfair to expect the company MAKING MILLIONS off of it to provide us with the best product they can.
---
You wont see a Rogue coming in Wpvp and Bgs even with your fellhunter out, which by the way, is the worst pet you can use against melee. (imp doesnt count)
---

&lt;Alpha&gt; | Horde | EU-PVP | Wed/Sun/Mon| 19:00pm-00:00am CEST | Semi-Hardcore | DKP
---
Recruitment◆
---
We're always looking for exceptional players of any class as well as potential Raid Leader(s)/Class Leaders
---
Head over to: [ ](https://forms.gle/mowrhbzLLACzr2G1A)[https://forms.gle/RwvkqSVTiooGR4f77](https://forms.gle/RwvkqSVTiooGR4f77) and fill in the form if you feel like you want to be apart of &lt;Alpha&gt;
---
We will also accept social players as long as they contribute in some way or form.
---
Introduction◆
---
All applicants should have a good attitude towards raiding. You will be required to dedicate yourself to min/maxing as well as having alt(s) in the future. When the World Boss phase kicks in, some members will have their own schedule for when they will have to camp a world boss spawn so this will mean that you have to put some time away for that too. In all, TIME and ATTITUDE you put in into the Guild will be rewarded. 
---
Member Expectations◆
---
You should be able to handle constructive criticism if/when it's directed at you. Banter is expected but when you receive constructive criticism you should be able to handle it in a mature way and consider other options than your opinion on the matter. As well as being able to adapt according to what the group needs at the current moment.
---
During progress raids our schedule will be quiet demanding and the schedule will be worked on until the launch of Classic. It's really important you understand this before even thinking about applying. 
---
World of Warcraft is a team game and communication is the utterly most important thing when raiding. Therefore you will be required to have Discord and have a working headset &amp; microphone, and you have to be able to understand/speak proper English.
---
Raid Schedule◆
---
We are set on raiding at least 3 days a week (Wed/Sun/Mon) and about 4-6 hours per session depending on how it will go during the Raid. That means you have to be flexible with the set raiding times.
---
**If you have any questions before applying add: Noox#2597 Onimon#3168**
---
Horde obviously. Bcz ally is f4gz.
---
From what I've seen through videos and stuff, Alliance had a much higher population in vanilla than horde.
---
 So while horde might have an advantage in terms of race abilities and stuff, given enough players I think they will end up being overwhelmed a lot in world battles.
---
That thing you describe kind of jiggered some memories for me. I think that might have been a thing that happened back in vanilla.
---
I know exactly what server you are talking about.  Believe me even with layering as someone who has played the beta...the time mobs take to spawn compared to these dynamic private server mobs heavily outweighs 3k people in Elwynn Forest at a time.   
---
Classic = LESS total people you see around you, LONGER spawn times by a heavy amount.
---
Pservers= MORE total people around you, INSTANT respawns in most cases.
---
TBH sitting at one mob waiting to tag it every 5 seconds isn't a good experience for me, its not how it use to be and its a stupid way to cheese the system.
---
Disgusting... hiding himself as one of us
---
This would have impacts on the economy. A lot of gaming of the market just before the layers merge. Also splitting it up that much might make it impossible for friends to play together if they get full. Finally it kind of misses the point of layers, since each subserver will quickly become a ghost town; forcing devs to collapse layers a bit sooner than they otherwise would
---
As someone who lives in a part of the world where Winters are rough and too cold to enjoy over half the time, I say go ahead and push the release back a month. Classic is a labor of love. Happy people do better work. No forced overtime.
---
like using layering to find a desolate layer with the best grind spot.
---

---
more realistically you’ll prob be sitting in a queue but alright
---
On this subreddit you also get banned **extremly** easily, sometimes 3 times in a row just to make it a permaban, and then they wont answer your appeals.
---
As long as there are no empty layers there won't be an issue

---
Do you guys not play WoW at a restaurant?
---
Damage reduction by forcing mobs to run around was how I leveled lock. Used succubus for increased damage and the fact that I could nail a point where she had aggro for like 1 - 2 hits taken, I would pull it off, and the mob would usually die running to me or only hit me once. It was more efficient than Voidwalker and she did the most damage of all my pets specced for it.
---
Completely agree with you there
---
Ya whenever steam opened up to games still in development. Green lighting or whatever they called it was the beginning of the saturation. 
---
Also a new game came out back then and you basically have to upgrade something on your computer. I'm still running an old i7 3000 something. Still runs everything I wanna play now. Wow was the first time I could play something on the same hardware for 2 or 3 years straight.
---
If you want to play alliance, come join us! Our guild is filled with a bunch of late 20-30 somethings.  
---
Going to be a great ride and need a couple more people to fill out our group ;)
---
You just assumed I was angry, I'm not in the slightest, I'm just dissapointed in human beings incapable of performing the most basic tasks, such as getting a decent setup for computer usage if you plan on sitting there for 8+ hours a day on launch.
---
Downvote me all you want, People are allowed to voice their opinions, and you are allowed to vote.
---
Have a nice day, I wont respond to this again.
---
without layering you too may experience 1h-3h queues to see the character select screen.  Not being able to get out of combat or receive loot to complete quests.  servers being down for hours at a time.  Having no monsters to kill for your quest because there are too many people in the same area and walking to an empty spot to just grind xp.
---
Everybody doesnt have the freedom to pick and choose where and what times they want to work. It is not as simple as "jus go find another job"...
---
Fuckin Mustard Tiger
---
tfw theres STILL no wc3-like race specific armor in wow
---
they really dropped the ball on that imo. Could have made armor so much more interesting
---
I rock that staff on Enhance Shaman while leveling.  It's cheap af on the AH.  Great top end dmg for WF fun!
---
ah yeah forgot they were free, right?!?!?! .. lmao
---
Why would you lock a character into that layer if your limited each server to having +/- 50 of each other at any one time ?
---
I know it is wrong to love this post, but I really do love this post.
---
Ya it always does. But that picture sure makes me feel like horde are gonna be on top.
---
FAPs are much more expensive and don't have a healer attached to them.
---
Your last bullet point is by far the worst to deal with.  
---
"Can I have food/water pls"  
---
"Portal to SW???"  
---
"Int buff pls"
---
Aaaand I totally forgot that part, yeah spiders are non issue, gonna go downvote my own post.

“I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed” good lord
---
8+ hours a day at launch? Damn lmfao 
---
Stay angry fellas
---
And hating streamers too
---
Because Blizzard has a history of not fixing bugs basically every beta they do? honestly its kind of delusional, if you think they will fix even 10 of these bugs
---
Troll priests are probably the more reliable of the two whereas undead are better every 3 minutes. 
---
Shadowguard can proc blackout giving you free stuns against melee, and touch of weakness is an MS effect that is really strong seeing as these are rare (Warriors have the other one)
---
Devouring plague is excellent damage and self heal boost but with a lengthy-ish CD at 3 minutes and their other one, I forget it's name, it's pretty bloody useless.
---
Hahaha. I mean there's the odd weapon procs that puts a disease on. Somebody could even get mind controled and your own team could put devo plague on. It COULD happen.
---
Ideally you would want str and spell damage. Mana can be delt with as shaman have pretty efficient ways to deal damage. Flametongue on a fast weapon with those two stats and smart searing totem use is more than enough damage. You shouldn't have mana issues with that.
---
Soul link is good for Wpvp but useless in Bg´s and Raids its also hella boring.
---
&gt;It's hard to prevent crunch...
---
Haha, what? It's super simple to prevent crunch. Be flexible in release schedules and demand that people leave work at a reasonable time.
---
Problem solved.
---
I think what you meant to say is "It's hard for companies to want to prevent crunch when it's so easy to convince their employees and customers that's it's necessary."
---
They can't.
---
Laugh because he's a twink which means he has no success at max level and can only prey on lowbies.
---
The person in a casual guild getting upset about loot going to any person for any reason is someone that isn't raiding with a casual mindset.
---
You prefer the hardcore mindset, and you explained situations where being in casual settings created mental stress for you that does not exist for people with a casual mindset.
---
You can't play Horde and complain about height when every single race except Forsaken are tall as heck.
---
Well said
---
Except that if you report someone here, you might get your self banned and the guy you reported did not get banned. Also you wont get a reply to your ban appeal.
---
How far did he punt that gnome?
---
A. This is layering... it's exactly what they're talking about doing with layering. You hop on a server, it fills up, splits X amount of times as needed, they shut down layering and merge it all back together. 
---
B. Dynamic spawns are even easier to exploit. It's not even a decent solution.
---
true but if you see one if PVP you better run the other way
---
I enjoyed a similar experience in OSRS. An amazing experience. Glad I can also be a part of WoW classic also!
---
HeyGuys! Poggers! OmegaLuL!
---
The mistake excuse is kinda lame.
---
Not to mention that that’s basically server merges which are worse than layering.
---
It's fine, this is no big deal whatsoever. If someone cares so much about \~possibly\~ dying in a fair fight they're playing the wrong game. 
---
If someone tries to gank me and I get them to 5% while I'm casting a final Mind Blast, one of two things will happen. 
---
1) They abuse layering and vanish from my screen. **I've won** and the other person knows they've lost, **I gain no honor or loot**. 
---
2) They don't abuse layering so they die. **I've won**, the other person knows they've lost, but **I gain no honor or loot**. 
---
Besides unless his friend is a paladin he's probably going to die from dots any way.
---
Trinket counterspell
---
Nope, saturation won’t matter. Classic WoW is good because it’s objectively a good game. And it’s population come this summer will reflect that.
---
That's literally what layering does lol.
---
They're surprise mechanics and they're extremely ethical.
---
I work for a very large cloud based CRM company. Often times we have to rush a release out so that we can lay the groundwork for a release 1-2 major releases away. I am sure this is not unique, a good example of this in WoW would be something along the lines of: 
---
- Release 1 contains a backend code fix that doesn't change Pet AI but applies pieces of code/fields that are necessary to lay the groundwork for the ultimate fix.
---
- Release 2 contains the actual fix leveraging the fields/APIs/dynamic code necessary to actually fix Pet AI.
---
I could potentially put these all into one release, killing 2 birds with one stone. That would ultimately go against Agile Methodology/typical 2 week sprints. But it will also impede my teams regression testing. By adding the fix in 2 different patches my team is able to test any regressions caused by the additional fields/apis/code etc when they aren't actually do anything. This isolates any defects/issues that are introduced with the ultimate patch that fixes the Pet AI and allows us to narrow down our scope to exactly what we changed with that patch.
---
Obviously it is more complicated than this. The root issue is still money. But, when you push a patch to millions of users they do a large chunk of your regression testing within hours of the patch going out and often uncover things that you would never think to test for. Thus a staggered approach is often more valuable than a "all at once" approach.
---
Why?
---
I remember this, the forum was full of hate and insults and no moderator cleaned it up, like no consequences at all + the 2 guilds asked some GM if they get punished if they won’t open the gates and he said, no problem, do whatever you want. hilarious shit.
---
Hope you have good luck in making your own guild, because nobody will bring a balance druid over a mage for dps or a resto druid for druid utility. It was a trash spec back then.
---
And if you're even a day late, all of the streamers and farmers and anyone making money from the game will pass you dramatically.
---
You would think pushing shit out of your ass would have been easier
---
Just my boy www.twitch.tv/highwarlordstino
---
Log out/ log in into another layer continue farm.
---
It will be a better/different experience than fresh pservers.
---
:&gt;
---
It's body is kinda short. It's way better than what I could do tho, so I won't say it isn't good.
---
Maps are client side. Also, due to the way wow's engine works (at least back then), if they were server-side objects, you would'nt be able to see them from very far away. They would spawn in when you get close to them just like other players and NPCs. This is most definitely a client-side mod.
---
Currently what causes the pet issue is if it’s in passive and the mob hits you before your pet attacks. The pet will bug out and only attack the target once and then runs back to you. I think it’s a bug but if proven otherwise I can accept it lol.
---
&gt; Right, I get so much entertainment value out of my account as I am doing other things, like sleeping....
---
I said potential. Was I wrong to assume you'd know what that word means?
---
&gt; You know what you are right. I am paying $7 a month for Amazon. That's 720 hours of entertainment too. Wait, that's half of what WoW cost.
---
&gt; Wow is expensive
---
I can't decide whether or not you legitimately don't understand how money works, or you honestly just want to argue. I like arguing too so if it's that one i can keep going here. If it's the former, then yes Amazon is cheap *as well*. Amazon being cheap, however, doesn't nullify the fact that WoW is also cheap.
---
There wasn't.  This was added post-Vanilla.
---
I have some friends who still love it, most of them are in guilds that are still friendly, talk, and raid together. I imagine it is a lot like when I used to go to boring LARPs, you go for the people you still like and not for the game itself. Or a little of both of you still enjoy raiding I would suppose. 
---
Since Classic requires a sub, some people hating in retail will probably give it a go just to see where things are at comparing to where they were. I know I will, I think that kind of comparison for yourself is always good. I also think it will be good for Blizzard devs and may help them with future retail updates or a sequel to see what worked in Classic vs Retail and vice versa. Anywho, everyone is entitled to their own bad tastes. :P
---
One of my favourite zones for sure, it's so calm and so peaceful.
---
Horde numbers ally skill and pally.
---

probably about the amount of cheese she can consume in one sitting
---
No, you just gave incorrect anecdotal information in the face of extensive research and evidence.  You being overwhelmingly downvoted is one of the few proper usages of the downvote button.
---
Thanks for this btw
---
Aren't shaman and paladin two of the most played classes? The census data always shows them at like 7-8% which is huge for being faction locked. 
---
Undead mages aren't exactly slippery compared to gnome mages.
---
Relative to a serious raiding guild, 5000 gold isn't THAT much.
---
&gt; Not mention why would the flag holder not be seen on the mini map?
---
Why would they be?
---
Consider that blizz is not saying anything, at all, about the various exploitations of layering during the first phase.  That means they are either working on making it better, or they aren't because there is no better option for them as a company.
---
So I suppose we could keep on with a bunch of threads that do literally nothing towards either of those goals or we could opt to not.
---
Honestly if layering is in live like it is in beta, I don't believe that would be enough to keep people on pservers, if it was, I'd rather not play with those people anyway.  Might weed out some of the insufferables.
---
Reasons I want to play: slow leveling, being broke, being challenging (all the reasons you don't like)
---
Troll has an effectively zero mana cost 20% mortal strike.  They also get a shadow orb shield that can proc blackout on those who melee attack them.  Undead get a disease that dwarves shrug off (but is still better).  Trolls are cooler though...
---
Most Instagramers only show the very best parts of their lives. The world thinks we are sophisticated world travellers, but we are actually dead broke and borrow money from her parents all the time.
---
He's not entirely wrong. There is stuff like Patchwerk where you do need a certain amount of gear. I just don't think it will take people that long to get the gear required because of how many freebie loot pinatas there are in the game.
---
True, Blackrock mountain is going to be a bloodbath
---
But it is so much easier now than it has ever been in the past.  I have found my last 2 jobs and my most recent promotion from simply submitting a resume online.
---
My old man saved up a couple thousand dollars and moved us two states away and took the first job he could get.  If he wanted a better job, he had to walk into a place and fill out an application.  The range we have now is ridiculous.  If you have some skillset to offer then yes, you do have quite a lot of freedom compared to our past.
---
If you never wanna do the struggle of changing specialization would Gnomish not be the best choice overall?
---
Resto is what people will expect you to play in PvE and great PvP healers.
---
Enhance is pretty bad DPS in PvE, and PvP relies on Windfury Crits to kill anything.
---
As someone who played enhance for a year on a pserver, don't do it.  The sheer amount of people who give you crap for playing a hybrid class makes it not fun.  Getting groups is very hard, and raiding is depressing being at the bottom of the meters after putting in 3x the work of other classes.
---
How is looking for group for a game that isnt released more important to be stickied exactly?
---
Oh it IS a bug, the question is if it was a bug in Vanilla.
---
This doesn't maybe work for the game industry but whatever.  
---
Doesn't always work. The customer needs to know 'why' something is delayed. And if you delay something for the 4th,5th,.. time they get annoyed and start to complain or just go somewhere else.  
---
The problem in IT is that a lot of non-IT people think it is easy to just write some code and do things. But that's not the case. We need to look at different use cases, do research about the project, maybe learn some new API or framework. Debugging is also a huge part, that's mostly why game devs ask the gamers to do it for them aka betas and early releases.   
---
When you are someone in IT people just expect you to do overtime and be on call even during vacations. I learned that the hard way.
---
Even of those blogs do come back, the answers are moments away... then that's the end of that discussion.
---
Finally I have found my people.
---
Yeah actually thought about that, but then I thought people who are really that interessted would ask and had it on the todo list for the website anyways.

Laugh at him for rolling Night Elf.

---
Funny how I grew up playing those crappy p2w games rather than WoW because of the subscription model. Now that I actually got a job, I wanna see if I really missed out on something big with classic.
---
Hi! What was your main’s character name? I used to play a human female warrior for “elite Order” in Deathwing and Tarren Mill servers
---
No duplicates allowed, that name is already in use.
---
To Northrend!
---
What disease will they be cleaning?
---
Disagree, this community is for and about Classic WoW - and that includes discussing how it differs from and may be superior to retail WoW. Just because there has been a huge influx of BFA refugees here in the last few months doesn’t mean this sub should be turned into a r/wow proxy for bored retailers waiting for the next expansion, trying to ban critical comparisons of their game with Classic.
---
Me and the wife are redoing the basement in preparation and the children are going to stay with their couisins for the weekend after launch. 😀
---
Can I get some of the cake?
---
You are mostly likely gonna have to go resto then when your guild has stuff on farm, you can collect enhance gear
---
Yeah 19 is a pretty dumb bracket for twinking. 29 is a little more exciting but I definitely had the most fun on my warlock whose path to 60 was eternally blocked by my need to grind arathi basin
---
Dynamic spawns fuck the economy up for a long time after they're disabled because of the rapid influx of raw gold and materials.
---
I'm a fan of dynamic spawns, but I can see why people don't want it, as it by far has the largest impacts from the get go.
---
Merging would likely not need to be done very often and people have already suggested steps to keep it painless.
---
You'd rather have every server be a 30k pop server where you never see the same people, where layering ruins immersion, where it's exploited by people, where everyone can farm smoothly and never venture out of their comfort zone?
---
It's fine if you want that, we just want different games.
---
Dwarf. Blind and bleed break is too good. You usually have improved sprint anyways so you don't really lose anything.
---
Sorry I'm being dumb, what do you mean by TF??
---
Learn to read, i said retail players not retail the game
---
Hi being dumb, what do you mean by tf??, I'm dad.
---
Take it from this man. He probably knows what he is talking about.
---
I remember I played Resto at 60 - and then sometimes when there was a Little raiding "break" waiting for new Content I would specc Enhancement for a couple of weeks just for the jokes. 
---
That was a lot of fun!
---
But maining enhancement is simply put not very viable sadly...
---
Dude, buying sharpening stones off the AH and spending 3 hours farming gnomergan is completely fucking different c'mon
---
At least you know your progress on classic won't be wiped. There's lots of people who played vanilla, but are now adults with responsibilities. Hopefully you still manage to have fun. :)
---
You can but at the lower levels mage farming is built almost entirely around blizzard so they can pull 10+ mobs and kill them before they can ever get to the mage.
---
They are true ass hats but I love a game / community that allows assholes to exist and operate as such.
---
If I were in their realm with my guild we would most certainly pay up, or talk to other guilds and pay up and then proceed to blacklist every member from that guild in the present and future.
---
Back then rivalries mattered a lot and, like in real life, your social skills got you way further than your mechanics ever could. So befriending a lot of good players in good guilds would get you a spot while being top5 dps but immature wouldnt get you far. And I loved that.
---
Funny to see IO mentioned here after all these years. I joined awhile after AQ had been opened so I wasn't involved in the drama, but I think it's fairly amusing. Acquiring the scepter was a long process and took a lot of effort so I don't blame anyone for wanting to take advantage of being the only one putting in the effort.
---
It’s simple, get a divorce right after the ceremony. /s
---
What about ele? Sort of the same same?
---
Don’t go in thinking that all classes/specs are created equal. Some specs are just bad dps-wise (retri paladin / balance druid), some are decent with gear and time (feral druids, warlocks) and some are just good all of the time (mages, rogues, warriors).
---
Why classes without top end dps are brought is because of utility.
---
Pvp IS unfair.
---
Things take time, but are therefore also alot more  rewarding.
---
I don’t know if it is just down to mindset, but grinding centaurs in Desolace to be a bit closer to a level higher feels alot better to me than grinding a reputation in BFA for a cool looking new Allied race. I don’t know why.
---
Hello! Currently guilds from the Tarren Mill server (including those who transferred there from Dunemaul and Deathwing) are going to play together. We gathered around 15 of them by now!
---
I plan on fasting the first 5 days of WoW Classic.  I'll be taking 1-2 walks per day and stretching every so often, but other than that, I don't see myself leaving my chair enough to excuse calories.
---
I mean, eh. It'll be out of the game in just a few weeks. The issues it remedies are ones that can cripple a server for years. I'll take the trade off.
---
for the ~~weekend~~ month after launch
---
Undead are good for PvP because they add more damage and survivability with Devouring Plague, and WotF is a CC breaker against Priests and Warlocks (also Intimidating Shout).
---
Trolls are marginally better for PvE, but not like on Alliance side where you pretty much have to roll Dwarf to be competitive. The 10% cast speed increase every 3 minutes is nice, but not game changing unless you're going for the absolute optimum all the time.
---
If you like the aesthetics of a Troll, go Troll. If you prefer Undead, go Undead. Both will work just fine.
---
There's a big difference between expressing discontent with BFA and shitting on people who are content with it.
---
You have to Keep in mind that those private Servers have a System for spawning in place that makes Mobs spawn WAY faster... While you sometimes only wait 30sec to 1min for a respawn in crowded Areas on a private Server it would be much more on the normal classic Servers. You would not be able to kill something with 2000 People competing in one Zone.
---
Dynamic spawns on the other Hand are a quite nice solution. 
---
With this the Problem is that the economy is not made for 10k+ People on one Server so they would Need to increase all spawns which is a lot of work - and still probably Need more Servers which is a cost factor which is why Blizzard would not do it.
---
Exactly. It's a fun idea, but as a main character. It's not fun. It looses its charm in a week or two when your damage and pvp is essentially playing a slot machine.  Ya ganna land on that sweet windfury crit and possibly 1 shot someone? Or are you going to white hit a warrior for 300dmg and get rekt while some mage kites you around.   
---
Remember windfury only hits 20% of the time roughly. So more times than not you're a big ole wet noodle.
---
Ele gives you those big dick chain and frost crits.
---
I remember picking a medium pop server with a dumb name and never having to queue.
---
They weren't in vanilla.
---
This reminds me, will you earn xp in bgs or wpvp?  How do you get gear w/o outleveling if you can't turn off XP?
---
BoF
---
Is that chance on hit for 35 energy more valuable then better stats gear from bwl and up? Probably not
---
Yes.
---
You go OOM in seconds.   It's great fun in pvp but not great in PvE
---
Yeah but that only happened after blood elf became a playable race. I'm 100% serious. It changed the Horde demographic immediately.
---
So when the factions are roughly balanced we will know that the two of you chose the same. 
---
RemindMe! 3 months
---
In classic there was a rogue on every server that was renowned for being 'That Rogue'
---
On Silvermoon EU, there was an Undead Rogue that used to live in IF, when you shouted out his name in chat and run around, he would guarenteed gank you if he was on, spamming his name as he did it. The pit that runs between IF bank and AH was his main preying grounds waiting for somebody to fall if the bridge. Me and my two buddies are already drafting up plans for our Gnome Rogue team.
---
Not saying it's perfect. But it is one of the better Solutions available given that Blizzard will not rent more Servers simply for the Money. 
---
Give me a good solution without renting new Servers, abusing, Long Queue times and 25k People on one Server. 
---
There is no better solution xD
---
Dynamic respawns would be much of a Change and mean more Servers etc. 
---
Give Blizzard a good way where they don't have to pay more and everyone is happy and you are the winner xD GL

---
They're of the least played classes of their respective factions, you pretty much answered it yourself.
---
This had the potential to be a great post... until OP forgot to formulate an opinion
---
Laying is completely understandable and acceptable for the first few days.  After that?  Nope.
---
And if you're doing a lot of rogue v rogue (like you might in a 19 twink bracket) it lets you see them in stealth before they can see you.  As well as having the most base agi, which is a bigger deal at lower levels.
---
Because getting 10 STV chests (or rare spawns, or herb/ore nodes) in 5 minutes isn't how the game is supposed to work you, fucking dolt.

I'm convinced layering is a boogeyman.  People don't like or hate layering, they hate layer jumping (by accident or by design).
---
All blizzard needs to do is make layers more sticky and nobody would give a fuck.  No layer hopping for you unless you're in friendly or sanctuary territory.  Solves the vast majority of the problems, don't really care if someone wants to fly from Felwood to Darnassus so they can layer hop and go back to herbing in Felwood.
---
No. They are one of the most played classes of their respective faction. I was saying the census data shows that their will be tons of them.
---
Have the mods decided to ban discussion of Classic WoW that is critical of retail and/or the demographic that plays it? Such as substantive comparisons of features, design philosophy, etc? 
---
If this is just going to be a subreddit controlled/censored by retail players I’m no longer interested in visiting.
---
Because it applies to more than just roots? 
---
Gnomes are alright, but WOTF is miles of escape artist for flexability.
---
Go resto until you have sulfuras 乁( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ㄏ
---
Actually, you only really need about half the raid to survive on Heigan. That fight was ALWAYS a joke. That's almost entirely a tank check, because if your tanks can do it, all the melee has to do is follow.
---
And don't forget about the completely bullshit advantages that people have on fights like that now. Your raid can literally use a free boost character, go into WOTLK Naxx, and just PRACTICE the dance for however long it takes them to learn with no real downtime or prep. You didn't have that luxury before. Imagine being able to do that in 2006. "I can just PRACTICE the boss mechanics solo without wasting anyone else's time." Yeah.
---
People are vastly overestimating how hard it's going to be. The number of advantages available to players is immense.
---
Even with the way lower numbers back then it was still BY FAR the most popular MMO by an obscene margin. Hard to call it dead when it fucking murdered every single other online game out there.
---
I plan on going full Resto and dueling Resto Droodz for hours out front of Orgrimmar.
---
Looks like Im out of cake.
---

Haha damn, I exaggerated sorry!
---
Shimmering flats is my favorite, its like a big grindy PvP battle arena. Get ganked by horde teamers, rally all the alliance up and push them into Thousand Needles and Tanaris solidifying hold on the grinding.
---
Sounds like a smooth plan!
---
&gt; general grind of getting to 40.
---
Those people won't be playing classic long if lvl 40 is a grind
---
No, its not!
---
It was a large percentage of all internet traffic until youtube came on the scene in 2005.

My point was implied, but I've been wrestling with the thought of why classic seems more appealing to me than retail. On paper it would seem that the more upgraded game would be the superior one. Through my recent experience and observation I realized it's the community and potential to make friends that is most appealing to me. The Classic environment gives you no option but to coordinate with other people in order to experience all the content, and that ends up forcing you to make friends, and games are more fun when you play with friends.
---
No I don't want that and I see your point of view. It's just fucking tough tbh. Not sure what the best solution is.
---
&gt;o resto then when your guild has stuff on farm, you can collect enhance gear
---
And that's how you get your raid leader never to give you the eye.
---
Once you get T2 and more specifically T3, you are basically a Warthogg without the \*brrttt\* sound, but hey you got cool lightning
---
But they didn't give a definitive date, so people are losing their minds.
---
That said, there are a bunch of videos out there showing weird shit like people just randomly getting phased into a new layer mid cast on a mob, without grouping or anything, just being phased over for no discernable reason.  It's pretty worrying system behavior.
---
Played enhance in BC, so it's always disappointing to hear it's useless in classic
---
Source on it being against the tos? Can you cite where it says that
---
I think an underrated aspect of world pvp is the centralized locations of flight paths and their proximity to major areas. Zones like Feralas have a central horde FP and an alliance FP to the far west. This zone would favor horde as reinforcements or passersby are closer. Some other examples are STV(Horde), Ashenvale(Alliance), Arathi highlands(Alliance). 
---
It's pretty even aside from racials which matter more in 1v1 or small group pvp.
---
I don't see anything wrong with comparing them, its healthy and I'd even encourage it to happen more.
---
Retail has huge problems and I would love to see it change for the better because of classic influence. I'm a vanilla player but do I really want to run mc and bwl forever? of course not, I'd love to see retail fix its issues and produce a game thats worth playing like classic is
---
Just remember that we're going to have to wait millions of years for creeps to respawn with so many people playing.
---
Probably Omar and 2 of his laboratory grown indistinguishable clones.
---
Join us brother
---
Ok I edited in my point
---
Hmmm, I was in a vanilla guild called Deus Vult for a while ... was it a christian guild ... Mind blown.
---
Layering is the one Blizzard went with and hopefully they have enough time to tweek it before launch. Still beats waking up at 4 AM to try to log in.
---
19 is so boring, I don't see how anyone deals with it.
---
and entire phase 2 &amp; 3 cuz we ranking. kids, poppa &amp; momma got to fight for our factio - country.
---
Or just don't be so greedy and pay it. I mean even if you sub, someone can be faster.
---
You have to be subbed to play, does it really matter that much, to sub 2 week early?
---
Yea, I did as well and dual wielding as enhance was some of the most fun satisfying game play I've had in WoW...a shame it took them an expansion to get it right.
---
The groups of people hanging around leads to socializing and emergent gameplay, which blizzard seems to be ignoring these days for the cold efficiency of keeping players in the Skinner box - but the thing is that the people are what keep many players in an MMO. Hiding players from one another prevents that. Being in the same virtual space standing around a mob spawn invites interaction in the way sharing a general chat channel does not.
---
Yes, it's annoying to have to camp mobs, especially early on when you don't have s lot of other things to do, but when you ease that up at the cost of other aspect of the game, I think it hurts more than helps the experience.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/XqkFIZB6FgA) is an interview of Oxhorn by TotalBiscuit on the radio show BluePlz back then. Pretty interesting. I love the man's work!
---
That is 100% PoD the Nicker is a razor blade on a stick.
---
There wasn't much ooga in the video...
---
Haha yeah i know right?! 8+ hours!
---
Casuals
---
I wish I knew the proc rate on it. If it's at least 9%, it may very well be worth it considering the rapid striking from a combat rogue in a raid. If not, then I'd lean towards it being replaced by BWL. I'm curious as to what other Rogue mains will say.
---
Anyone that played Vanilla knows that.  I am not going to try to find the TOS from back then.
---
You're right but the morons on here will say differently.
---
[I was a day 1 Vanilla Druid Player](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/845647), playing [Until BC, where I was the #1 Arena player in the world](https://imgur.com/5DlRzJz). I plan on rolling Druid again and have been in the beta nonstop since I got in day 1 :).
---
For leveling - Feral is your best bet, especially in 1.12. Feline swiftness is huge for leveling speed, and feral can heal dungeons just fine (just carry an intellect set of gear to use - cloth is fine). 0/30/21 Is your best bet for all-around usefulness in the late 50s/early 60s as well, as you can tank, dps, or heal anything just fine.
---
*But once you've graduated past fresh-60, are out of low level greens, and are ready to Raid/PVP:*
---
Resto is your strongest spec. Feral and Boomkin are fun for PvE and PvP they absolutely can contribute - but you'll always rely on guild to carry you. Feral can tank or DPS - but its unlikely that you'll ever be optimal. You will have to work 2x as hard, and farm 2x the amount of consumables (hours a day) to be about 90% of where you'd be as a true DPS/Tank class.
---
No class can tank, DPS, and heal optimally - If they could, everyone would be a druid. If you are ok with being a sub-optimal player for Tanking and DPS, that's fine, just make sure your expectations at end-game are there (You won't ever be on the cutting edge without being carried by your guildies and will require more time and effort to be "almost" where everyone else is).
---
Resto is where Druids shine. Pure Raid PvE, you need a few druids to cover the shortfalls of other healers. Huge NS burst heals, HOTs ticking everywhere (saving the GCD of other healers), Rebirth combat res, etc. I always ran 8/11/32 spec - The PVP Healer that doesn't lose much in PvE but makes you the (IMO) best PVP Healer.
---
Think of Druids as Support - Not true healers. Your tools are based on peeling and mitigration. You can heal fine, but if you roll up to a PVP battle as a Druid/war vs a Priest/War and expect to out-heal the priest, you're ganna lose. You have more tools are your disposal to impact the game than other healers, but not many of them are heals. You're expected to FF to lower armor/prevent stealth, Root who/when applicable to peel and/or isolate, know when to spam rank 1 rejvs to bait purge/dispell, know when to Feral Charge+Bash to stop a heal, Know when to rank 1 MF to dot someone, kill totems, etc. Do you use NS defensively to HT yourself, or Regrowth yourself (knowing you can get away to then utilize the hot, and then swiftmend?, or do you NS Root, knowing you can walk away and heal/drink/stealth. You can also use NS offensively, to root someone and isolate from their team, or even to NS Hibernate Shams/Druids as well.
---
You need to always position yourself to be able to run away. While druids are the best at running away, when caught, you have far less tools than other healers to push them away (Fear, Plate, bubble, BOP, LoH, etc).
---
Be ready to lose - A lot. Druids are far more fragile/room for error than other classes. But - If you're willing to put in the time to learn not only your class, but other classes, and how/when to use your abilities to neutralize their advantages, the sky's the limit.
---
Forgive me, I primarily play PvE. That’s definitely true for PvP servers.
---
You level as feral. You can stay feral and. At DPS if you work really hard and farm Manual Crowd Pummelers, etc. you could also go hybrid HOTW spec 0/30/21 to tank and heal. Your best bet is resto, but this is only someyto worry about at 60.
---
I think what he ment was lack of content at level 40.
---
Yheres not much to actually do, like at level 30, you are in much more of a "grind zone" from 40-50 then anywhere else in the game tbh.
---
Basically what you said heh.
---
High school you was in class 8-3 as well wasn't it?
---
Tbf neither can the Paladin.
---
Doh!
---
Yea. After 5 days, you will start seeing 60s.
---
Skip the ceremony, fake your death, get loot.
---
So you can base your “sky is falling” viewpoint on ifs and maybe, but anyone else that offers their own speculation aren’t allowed to use if and maybes? What sort of shoddy logic is that?
---
Also, if the layering is able to be efficiently abused for material gathering, it’ll primarily affect the launch era of the game. After a few weeks, it’ll even out.
---
Dynamic respawn. Boom, problem solved.
---
If I've told you once I've told you a million times - Don't exaggerate!
---
but the fact's don't fit OP's narrative!
---
Good attitude...
---
depends on the dedication/preparing of the groups.
---
Noggenfogger (slow and mini), deviat supreme, low level scrolls, water walk, water breathing ( maybe shaman and wl stack?)  detect invisibility, JuJu's....
---
there are so many trash buffs that hitting the FAP / Freedom is not as easy as it may seem on the first glance. Everytime you did not hit the FAP you jsut spend 1.5s doing absolutly nothing towards winning the fight. 
---
In more casual enviroments you probably wont see any of these shenanigans. But even if Freedom gets dispelled instantly, it will still have removed all roots and slows when it was buffed.
---
Look it up a bit and it seems to be 3.5% only on white hits [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=6944](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=6944)
---
I'm pretty sure Touch of Weakness can proc Blackout also, just like Shadowguard. Same with Devouring Plague but I may be wrong. I believe certain Shadow spells like Shadow Word: Pain could proc Blackout off the first application of the spell onto an enemy, NOT any of the "ticks" of the DoT.
---
You will likely be able to participate in the Jul 19/20 stress test so not everything is lost.
---
Rolled a druid as my first toon on vanilla release in 2004.  I love druid but if I could offer one piece of advice is make friends to play with.  Druid can do it all but not as good as everyone else.  With a partner or group a good druid shines.  My favorite thing about a druid though is how high the skill cap is.  You could play vanilla druid for months /played and you will still have lots to learn.
---
Also when the game launches look into some cool macros and addons for druid.
---
Careful, man. You're wading into some serious brodude territory

**What Can You Expect from Us?**
---
A documented community past is nice and all, but we want to maintain the mentality of what have we done lately for our community members. We want to build a strong, thriving, long term Acolytes raiding guild in World of Warcraft Classic. No one wants to join a guild that is dead 4 months into the game. We feel our history shows that we maintain long track records in the MMO’s we join.
---
Just a few items we can provide you as a member:
---
* An environment to progress and successfully complete raids and goals
---
* Active Discord to chat about World of Warcraft Classic
---
* Scheduled guild raid nights
---
* An environment where we get things done and have a fun time doing it
---
* Experienced and friendly players to help all levels of gamers
---
**What Do We Expect From You?**
---
We are looking for people who love World of Warcraft, who enjoy raiding and are looking to take part in a fun and exciting time in the history of World of Warcraft with these new Classic servers. Many great memories will be made.
---
We expect the following from you:
---
* Level-headedness
---
* Team players who value their peers and guild
---
* Active community participation
---
* Sense of self-worth and pride without arrogance
---
* 18 years of age or older
---
* Harassment of other players/members is not tolerated
---

---
Thanks fella. Whelp, that answers that then.
---
Troll is better for PvP overall but less bursty than UD
---
I love it. Also, totally agree with you. I think most of the fun of classic was being confused as fuck and teaming up with the equally confused noobs around you. It forces you to actually enjoy the game and explore the otherwise irrelevant aspects of the game. By not guiding you towards the most efficient way of playing the game you’re forced to discover more about it m, which in an MMO, is the whole point of it. Retail is so streamlined and designed to guide players towards the most efficient way of playing the game that you lose the sense of community and exploration that the game has.
---
What the other guy said, but also
---
More pvpers tend to pick horde in general due to racials. So horde generally has a more pvp oriented population. When ainplayed horde more people were willing to help out in random world fights, and more people knew what they were doing. In organized pvp, this evens out since everyone there should be into pvp.
---
A holy/prot pally in organized pvp is the best healer in the game. Maybe 1 out of 50 pallies in a pug will heal, with most being ret, one of the worst specs in the game. In pugs, your best class gets switched into your worst class
---
Or make it so you change your layer, but only from a major city.
---
Well it's a bit different grinding to 40 if your character is going to persist vs getting wiped. I imagine a lot of people want to avoid burnout.

---
Not true. Literally the only thing that ticks me off is layering. I was on board with all the other changes but layering is a dealbreaker
---
Forget the name, but there is a link to a list of his addons on his twitch page. (Give him a follow while you are there!)
---
DP has a long cooldown and can be instantly removed with cleanse/cure disease/stoneform. I just don't see it as that amazing when a fight is more than a 1v1 vs someone who can't remove it.
---
I think you already have enough of an advantage as Horde. No tremor totems or WoTF to make one of your best defenses useless.  Shadowguard will always be procc'ing and can be instantly refreshed, it's like having a 2nd DoT on demand.
---
Thank you for this. I’ve wanted to try something new and settled on warlock, but I can’t help not liking the level 50-60 looks. I played enhance shaman in vanilla and that’s the aesthetic and gameplay I like, the leveling is just a slog.
---
No, I'm not. You must be brand new here from /r/wow. Take your time, look around a bit. It makes sense that you haven't seen all these threads pop up time after time.
---
Atleast credit the original artist. /u/srgrafo
---
 i can check out some Hunter Vs World videos and some PvP videos to see what I can find
---
Nope. I'd rather have to hop in queue when I get home, take a shower, make dinner, have a nice cup of tea, then log in after 3 hours in queue than have my game time made a fucking joke by layering.
---
Log out/login to new layer, continue farms.
---
If you play resto you need to always act like you are so sorry that a binding didn't drop, and that of course you'll take the eye of sulfuras but really you don't really need it that much tbh.
---
It felt like there was more to do at 30 than 40 and a lot more played when that was the cap. 
---
Since most players quested to 30, the lvl 30 end-game had more "meat" to it and players seem to keep playing after having bis. But with the lvl 40 increase, questing was a non-options so most just grinded Dungeons til 40. This method sorta prematurely killed the lvl end-game because you basically had everything from those dungeon before you reached 40. 
---
Plus, altho lvl 30 &amp; 40 meta's are fun in their own way, there not nearly as vast as the lvl 60 content. Then you add some burn-out or players not wanting to burn-out, and I think you end up where we're at in beta atm.
---
They gave out keys to people with old account ages because they specifically wanted people who could identify if things match the way they were in vanilla. Yes, this might have had the side effect of those with active subs only playing the beta part time. If they want a higher population I'd imagine they will send more invites out to the same category of people.
---
Only there's never anything constructive about it.  Its always is or devolves into shitting on retail and those that play it.
---
No it isn't. In that scenario, you can't jump from layer to layer like you can right now. In his scenario, you basically are playing on a single unified server until such a time as the tourists are gone and Blizz then starts merging you together with your pre-assigned merge group.
---
Me too lol
---
Yeah, Stealth/Vanish/Shadowmeld/FD would all drop the flag (or fail, can't remember which) in TBC for sure.
---
You mean the don't cheat to ruin the sense of accomplishment attitude?  The attitude that was prevalent in Vanilla wow?
---
So why did you marry her? I still don't understand why people not only start a relationship but marry people they have little in common with.
---
Just get more fckn Servers would be a better Alternative.
---
As a strategic leader of a software company, there is a solution. It’s called managing expectations and not promising dates before you know your capabilities. 100% this is the fault of upper management and sales pressure. Thing is, devs give an estimate...and an estimate is treated as a promise even though it isn’t. When you take your car into the shop, they give you an estimate...how many times have you been given an estimate on something only to have a repair guy, or service worker find more shit wrong and tell you it is going to cost more and/or take more time and have to order parts, etc? Happens ALL THE TIME...but somehow this is unacceptable in software and devs get ragged on because it’s not an exact science. To further the problems, the devs don’t push back and quit some gigs which only enables this kind of bullshit. Therefore, upper management over-promises to keep customers happy...but it leads to a toxic situation.
---
&gt; i remember it was the only server where no GM intervened
---
Why would a GM have intervened in any case on any server? There's no way to compel a player to complete a quest, no matter how that player came to be able to do so.
---
Manually opening the gates 6 months down the line (or whatever time period it was, too long ago to remember) I can understand, clearly a server is not capable of opening it themselves.. (although arguable if they can't open it, they don't need it open)..
---
Yeah, I played the last three expansions at launch with no issues! I was pleasantly surprised! This time will be no different...will actually be putting in my vacation time this week. I can’t wait!
---
Yeah but not in mage v mage like the comment above talked about.
---
Let's be honest, they're probably gonna F anyway so it's a win/win.
---
No need to blind and restealth.
---
Cheap, vanish, ambush, tea, kidney, backstab, backstab, sapper they should be dead unless you got unlucky with crits. If you don't kill now you can blind.
---
Horde, because shamans provide refreshing aloe heals, which kill the most germs.
---
"*like ANYONE will ever remember the famous WoW guild that accomplished x task within the game rofl*"
---
This comment on that forum post didn't age well. 13 years later and here we are still talking about it haha.
---
Tbh from what you just told me, it sounds like you'd enjoy priest the most. Fear ward is so strong. I was really split between lock and priest but a friend wanted to heal and I love dps and lock has been my main since late cata so I didn't have much of a choice.
---
Another advantage you'll have with priest is that you'll be really valuable for your guild/raid group and you won't have to compete too much for gear.
---
I guess it's mostly up to you if you want to heal or not but some people told me you could pvp in shadow and then still use the same build to heal in raids. You won't be the top healer but you will still be valuable.
---
P. S. Such a shame dps and tank paladin aren't viable. And they are really boring to level. But you get a free mount and are extremely hard to kill which is also important to consider.
---
Layering is so bad that if you wander STV looking for a member of the opposite faction to gank, you'd be fortunate to find even one. Source: I've been trying :(
---
i love the honesty in this post, have my upvote
---
no dual screens? that is kind of important in gaming in this day and age...  
---
I can't hardly function if I have to alt tab every 2 minutes to check discord, reddit, Spotify or youtube, wowhead, twitch, and all the other gaming web sites.  Doesn't even look like you can get a good view of the TV for background noise when you are on a flight path or long run.  You do you, but I do not like this battle station.
---
Yea shaman do really well in groups, pref melee heavy ones because of WF totem, they're an amazing support class but are super fun to level solo, too, because they have a literal utility belt to take care of most situations, and ghost wolf is that good ish.
---
It's just a legitimately good mmorpg. Them having a centralized official server that won't be modified questionably, is very enticing. Maybe I will play for a month, maybe a year. I don't know, but I definitely want to enjoy the adventure again and especially enjoy the very end of endgame content that I couldn't before.
---
I'm sorry you find it painstaking and boring, but I find new MMOs to be pretty boring, more anti-social oddly enough, and otherwise pointless. It's all about what appeals to you. Play what you like, walk away from what you dislike. Pretty straight forward!
---
Its been a long time since I've seen this much baseless conjecture in one post.  You pulled so many numbers and percentages out of your ass haha.
---
Does Viper Sting still work at least. Gotta be able to spam that.
---
Sorry to disappoint, There is a limited amount of content so it's spread out in the episodes.
---
Any golden age has to cause a negative otherwise the bit after it would be the golden age.
---
The game shouldn't have flying or lfg queueing systems imo. The classes however were well designed in wrath and tbc, more viability all around.
---
Just don't add too much healing outside of healers ofc.
---
Making specs like ret / boomkin / enh / ele / shadow more viable would mean not everyone roles warrior/rogue/mage...
---
We already have a lot of changes and they decided to put out the best version of classic from the beginning without all those bugs / exploits / unnerfed items and bosses. If we get an improved version, why can't they improve the class balance too?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the non-tier phases come out a bit quicker. Phases 3, 5, and 6 will likely be the longest.
---
resto shamans are not good pvp healers. resto is a pve spec, if you pvp you go ele.
---
It isn't just shaman vs pally directly. As a hunter main, a group with a pally is so much worse than a group with a shaman.
---
Is blessing of kings cheating?
---
What about farming lots of consumables?
---
If you can’t FD/trap, you cannot PvP. Period.
---
Trolls regenerate their hp....and there's nothing you can do about that.
---
This setup is absolutely horrible for gaming period.
---
What does that even mean
---
This.
---
It’s not re releasing an old game because they’re using the new client to run the old game.
---
2005. In 19 we'd append "classic".

I bet you have a second monitor and an office or desk chair at least putting you miles ahead of this one.
---
possible outside factors include :
---
unexpected obstacles that were missed in the design process.
---
unrealistic delivery timelines set forth by business (this is the bane of my existence to be honest)
---
quality control / organizational limitations. for example, some companies require change control documentation before changes can be implemented (even for testing purposes). if your quality control department has to sign off on your change control documentation, and they dont get to your change record as expected due to work load or whatever, your testing is pushed back until they approve your change. 
---
these companies have a large number of moving pieces, all made up of different groups and people, getting things to work like a perfect machine is never realistic. there are certainly factors outside of money that come into play, but i would agree that, for the most part, money is the major contributor in some form or fashion.
---
Ahh look another angry redditor coming in to act better than other people bc of how they like to sit while they game
---
Congrats dude
---
Fear Ward Baby
---
Shaman does not have bloodlust until tbc, unfortunately.  
---
The clutter will mostly come from all the various ranks of spells you would have to use
---
And sometimes your resist never works too
---
No im basing my viewpoint on video evidence that iv sen of people abusing layering. Thats not an if and maybe. I dont think you're reading my comments correctly.
---
They are using BFA macro system.
---
So if Blizzard said they wanted to add LFG for a "few weeks" you'd be OK with it?
---
It's not only due to employers, as a software developer myself I know far too well that what seems to be an easy task isn't always easy, and if I've promised it, I'd rather put in another hour or two of my time than have to go to the boss with my tail between my legs.
---
Young guys has a tendency to overestimate how much and for how long you can work. I can easily do 12 hour days for a week in a row, probably a few weeks, but I'd be losing efficiency and the quality of the work I produce will start to drop from day 2, which in turn results in having to spend even more time.
---
It's a negative spiral that is really hard to realize until you've already hit the wall.
---
Not in my islamic elitist tryhard guild, either.
---
It reminds me of the hype me and my friends had for SWTORs initial launch. That game had everything I ever wanted in an MMO (I still think vanilla SWTOR is one of the best games I have ever played). I am so ready to get into this game.
---
Orc -&gt; Undead
---
Horde 100% due to the tram connecting SW and Ironforge. Makes ganking both cities easy AF! If you don't know this you haven't world pvpd for real lol
---
what QoL are you referring to that people excited about Classic wouldn't consider game ruining?
---
I mean grinding to 40 on a permanent sever vs a beta has very different motivation involved
---
Upvoted you guys for not writing “Tauren Mill.”
---
And RPG elements. Classic appears more dependent on individual stats (weapon skills, defense skills) as well. Makes the game harder, but more fun in my opinion.
---
exactly. and bad press can lead to skeptical investments, which leads to a loss in revenue / angry share holders.
---
We did this kind of shit with the auto translate in final fantasy 11... The sex puns were glorious
---
Think you're reading a little too into that. They're probably best mates she just thinks games are stupid. Sometimes it's nice to have different hobbies in a relationship.
---
This is the true answer. For it it will be to slow down and enjoy the journey rather than trying to push. An hour here and there as opposed to binging and long nights in Ulduar.
---
Doesn’t matter - shitting on retail is perfectly legitimate as long as it occurs in the context of discussing Classic WoW (ie. a comparison). Criticizing retail players I am fine with as well, having seen similar condescending/negative posts upvoted there prior to the beta. In addition, it’s easy to stifle criticism of retail by claiming it’s an attack on retail players, so I don’t support such a rule.
---
lol right?
---
I'm going Enhance for leveling but I'm switching to Resto for end game. Get the chain heal going.
---
I played/gonna play pally, and to be honest I find healing in battlegrounds to be the most rewarding part of PvP. Then again, I’m mostly a PvE player.
---
I always wave when I get mind visioned 
---
Then I panic
---
&gt; in tbc you had to wait 2 hours not 2 days, it was a queue that was gone after 2 days. but thank you for making my point
---
i was making the same point but you're welcome, lol. nobody wants to wait for hours to play even 48h after release. 
---
&gt; instant gratification pieces of shit will ruin classic for months and end up quitting because its not an instant gratification game. 
---
instant gratification has nothing to do with this. "congratulations, you waited 4 hours in queue to be able to play, though if we had done our job you wouldn't have to." fuck off. the technology didn't exist in 2004, it does now. there's just no excuse. 
---
&gt; so the only point of it is to play through the starting zones smoothly. 
---
bingo. it's exactly why they're doing it.
---
I'd go with PvP if I were you. Here's why:
---
Ganking sucks, I know.
---
But:
---
One day you will be 60. When that day comes, and you've raided all the raids you wanted and dungeoned all the dungeons you wanted, there will be a content drought. Classic is classic and will always stay 1.12 (i sincerely hope anyway) and having PVP on your server enabled by default allows for more dynamically created content for and by players. Noobies getting ganked and calling out for help? You can help them out. Starter town being held hostage by enemy faction? You can organise a team and deliver justice upon the heretics. And so on, and so forth. I don't say that PvE servers cannot have content created for and by the players, but because PvP is enabled there are just *more* options to consider, keeping you hooked for longer.
---
That's my 2 cts anyway.
---
How many of these bugs are actual bugs, and how many of them are just the way Classic works? (honest question)
---
I played the hell out of Vanilla, and all I recall from that time is every hunter complaining about everything all day long. So I'm trying to understand if this is different, or more or the same.
---
8% overall, but only available on one faction so more like 16% which is not tiny
---
I just plan on waiting a couple days. I am in no rush. I want to see how server populations look. Pick a good one, then start. I don't have any reason to be there the instant it launches.
---
Haha thank you was driving me mad!
---
Shadowguard procs also against Casters and ranged. :-) 
---
It actually is a nice feeling, when you get ambushed and your attacker stuns himself with his first attack, giving you time to prepare.
---
If there's 5 times more players and 5times more ressources it does not change the economy at all. And besides, it would be for the launch, there isn't really anything early that impacts the economy. Dynamic means dynamic, so you can have blizzlike respawn on devilsaurs black lotus etc. eventhough there's 12k pop, if you so please.
---
Very true, and I worried about this myself. But you know what, for me, the game is just fun to play, period. Even before beta I dabbled on a pserver and reach lvl 54. Then got in to beta and had so much fun getting to 40(same class, same race too). You'd think I'd burn out but I just haven't, at least not yet. And now I'm leveling up my second character.
---
Do I care that they'll both be deleted? No, not really. I get that people feel tied to their character and their progression, but would anyone work so hard on progressing their character if it wasn't fun in the first place. When I have free time, I like to game for fun and lately, the classic beta has provided that for me.  The world is so vast that everything takes a while, and even when you're "done", you got 7 more characters to play :)
---
i remember losing my shit the first time i saw this one. so good. so so good.
---
For me it is "why do I even have viper sting on my bar with dwarves and pallies around" as horde then "this might be the best ability I have in pvp" as alliance
---
Call them whatever they want, but they did get remembered by the  one guild that refused to open the gather rather just another one who did.
---
You mean with a)? No because on layering you can switch layer. That would not be possible on the split servers.
---
I wasn't 100% sure on this so didn't want to put it out there but thanks for verifying.
---
Oh goodness, seeing this gave me flashbacks. Loved this game.
---
Also hunter will be asked to kite a lot
---
Hunter is honestly one of the hardest if not the hardest imo - and thats coming from a warrior
---
A. the difference is that with set split servers from the start you would not be able to change between server.
---
B. Depends on how it's done.
---
And lastly, I just said there's more options. I'm not saying it's better or worse.
---
That's my worry! I can easily get to higher levels but I don't want to spoil it or get burned out. I'm hoping to find a good middle ground
---
There might be room for highly personalised guide / gameplay blogs. Can't imagine they'll have a wide appeal, but could be fun.
---
Freedom isnt easily purged. You cant choose what purge hits
---
This is why people laughed their ass off when streamers started ranting about backlisting people and reporting them for ganks. It's ridiculous and entitled.
---
The alliance have paladins and one of their specs is essentially dead, meaning that there's a flat 50/50 chance for them to be holy and  help you. The horde have shamans and there's 33% chance you'll get a resto to heal you. 
---
Of course those numbers are not exactly accurate because the majority of shamans and paladins know their place in classic.
---
Another reason to go alliance if you like PvP is that it would seem that the horde pop, at least according to classic beta data, is greater, therefore you'll have a longer que time to grind honor in Bgs.
---
I'm not saying that these options are necessarily better, I'm just saying that there is more options than layering and queues.
---
Server mergers are drastically better than layering. It's a one time event that's not a huge deal when the servers involved started at the same time. Layering as currently implemented makes the game a joke 24/7.
---
&gt;They say they?d rather be known as the obnoxious guild that held their server hostage than forgotten as the kind guild that opened new content.
---
They got what they wanted.

Spoken like a true orc rgoue ninjaing everything in the world as per usual.
---
&gt; A) Multiple splits of the same server that eventually is merged back again
---
This is either a troll response or just really dumb. That's literally layering, that's what they're already doing.
---
That's like a 3% chance of occurrence
---
Probably a moot point for the first year.   Dungeon tier sets don't come out until Phase 5, when the AQ war effort starts.
---
Why would anyone want to play a spec with 3 buttons, shit dps and no mobility in pvp relying on windfury RNG to win ?
---
I just got invited to beta 2 days ago.
---
I'm a streamer I hope anyone that ganks me get banned.

&gt; I'm more concerned about the Merge process at the end though. I feel it's gonna be a bit of a train-wreck.
---
They've tested this already in three stress tests (technically the first stress test was two tests over two weeks) and will be with the third.
---
That is not true! People in the 80s 90s had it waaayyy easier to relocate and to find a new jobs.
---
Hubby and I played a druid (me) hunter (him) combo when we first started playing WoW, and that's what we will be playing in Classic.  We are definitely casual PVE, we took our time leveling.  My spec was definitely hybrid, sort of a restokin because I like casters.  It's a great combo because it provides good dps but also allows me to switch to healing mode if we get overwhelmed, while also having good utility.  I can remember getting mobbed in I believe STV (where it feels like we spent an eternity) at one point and afterward looking at each other like "how did we survive that?"

0.3*0.3*0.3 = 0.027 = 2.7%

**\[EU-PvE\] &lt;Truefaith&gt; \[Alliance\] Filthy Casuals Warning!** 
---
**About Us:** \- We are reincarnation of vanilla WoW casual guild. Friendly and laid back, yet raiding capable group of nerds. Guild got to like half-way AQ40, which if you ask me is quite impressive for casuals, and that’s on Quel Thalas which was a realm added later, not at launch
---
We don’t focus on PvP tho certain individuals with questionable sanity and paladin toolkit (Sorry John) can teach you the ropes in all of the battlegrounds. We will not actively discourage PvP either (but seriously stop wasting time and come to MC ok?)
---
**What We Provide:** 
---
\- Hunter loot and Chuck Norris jokes
---
\- Knowhow … we were there, we did it, we had amazing time so we wanna do it again
---
\- Dire Maul sightseeing tours with a guide (Im so salty with will not be there at launch)
---
\- Friendly environment of adult people, we will all jump into the dungeon to help you with your one dumb quest and we don’t care if griding levels is more time efficient
---
\- Pooling resources, we work together to get our crafters up to speed. Especially if you get some of them juicy patterns from the goblin in Dire Maul (Yes I love the place!), get people Onyxia cloaks and resistance gear…
---
**What Are We looking For:**
---
\- Being casual guild makes this easy, we welcome everyone with good attitude, bad language is perfectly fine as long as it’s a joke. Insulting guildies is a no-no, but we like a good drama, just keep it civil
---
\- Open mind, WoW classic is very different from retail and if you were not there, you will just have to trust us. If anyone says something about class/spec not being viable we will mock him. If you didn’t expect group healed by druid and tanked by fury warrior with hunter jumper cables being only rez, to run DM north tribute runs, you are in for a surprise friend. You will also see paladins in cloth healing in MC, its actually really funny (Sorry John)

Right because I would want to play on a server where I have to ignore half the community?
---
Sounds like such an amazing classic wow experience, you know the game that focuses on community and communication ?
---
Everyone is at there own pace, it doesn't matter.
---
They said that farming the rep for the douses will take approximately 3-4 hours, which is a lot considering the vast majority of time spent week 1 is gonna be lvling, thats why they said theyre gonna "attempt" rag week 1, their biggest enemy is honestly just time, considering these boys clear MC in 18 minutes with good gear, 3-4 hours spent on rep farming is a lot of time they could be doing other things.
---
You can poke fun at those you love and still love them
---
Yeah, beta is not a good indicator of how Classic is going to be. I just got beta but I'm not playing it because there's no point burning myself out on a temporary character when it's just a mere 2 months until release.
---
Lol you people care more about shareholders than the people actually creating your game. Shame on you.
---
\[H or A, pref H\]\[PVP\]

LF morning raid guild doesn't matter what days except Friday. Planning on playing lock but if you have a preferred class you need i'll probably play it. Semi-hardcore raider that has gotten aotc on nearly every raid. Taking a vacation to level so that I can be ahead of the pack and hit 60 quick and would like to jump into things quickly.  My battletag is Razkae#1574, shoot me a message.
---
This is actually the correct. Most alliance guilds were informed and didn't mind that much. Alliance had their own guild merger to deal with during that time anyway, Simia + DPF forming Addicted after BWL so some extra time was nice for everyone.
---
Yeah WoW was definitely not a particularly original game, but it was a massive landmark for the genre. It was an extremely accessible MMO that attracted more casual players who maybe couldn't stomach some of the unforgiving and time-consuming systems in other games.
---
I don't think it's very balanced that hybrids can do all roles. They can excel at one role and be mediocre and niche in the others. That's why I think warriors are bullshit because they are excellent tanks AND excellent dps. No question about it, they are the best class and that's why you see half the server rolling warrior. 
---
Feral tanks are decent tanks with super high threat. Feral dps is not great, but not terrible. Boomkin is completely retarded but 30/0/21 is really powerful in PvP. 
---
Ret paladins do pretty trash dps but they have some utility like very high uptime on Nightfall and quite good AoE dps. They also take much of the loot the warriors don't need. 
---
Prot paladins are awesome for AoE threat especially of your warriors are not skilled enough to do it. 
---
What really sucks is hunter dps which really falls off after BWL and they don't have any other role. They still provide nice utility but their damage is garbage unfortunately.
---
Bullshit excuses for a bullshit system. 
---
Tell the costumer why they’re delaying. If you get angry because they’re delaying your video game so the devs don’t have to work themselves to death there’s something seriously fucking wrong with your head.
---
Also stormstrike takes up a debuff slot so might not be allowed to use it in raids.
---
How bad is resto leveling ?
---
Undead or Gnome? 
---
Which one is best for PvP? PvE?
---
That only applies to rogues..... and most of the ppl will roll undead
---
Very happy to see so much testing go behind it. Wonderful. I'd be happy to be proved wrong for sure.
---
Why not just ignore what they are saying? It's obviously not meant for you.
---
Mage: Undead or Gnome?
---
Which race is best for PvP? PvE? Whats ur pick?
---
I'm probably thinking way too far ahead, but better to get it out of the way in my mind.
---
I see what you are saying, but if the footman is good, he is moving to the left as the log comes down and maybe gets the shield in position to glace the blow off, or just moves out of the way while sticking the cow in the neck while he is swinging that log overhead. 
---
Who am I kidding...he is just gonna eat the log.
---
Lol activision has more than enough money to give the devs some normal working hours. In fact people are way more efficient working normal hours.
---
They have more than enough revenue. It’s greed that powers this behavior.
---
I've always gotten the impression horde draws the biggest and most obnoxious kinds of people which is why i so much enjoy killing horde
---
1 video is not extensive research. Reading one patch note is not extensive research.
---
Poopsocks galore soon
---
Report him, then you will get an option to Block/Ignore. For some bizarre reason Reddit only provides this option when you report someone.
---
Cdew seemed to do pretty well on enhance at level 40, im guessing the gap between them and other classes is too large at 60?
---
Half the people trolling shamans want to dps in raids, and half if those even know how horrible the dps is, but think they're special enough to get a spot.
---
Anyone who played vanilla knows the hardest boss in the game is guild drama. Most guilds will have a glut of dps and struggle to find enough healers. The decent guilds will look at the dps charts, see that their shamans are doing one third the dps of others classes, and get this sorted out.
---
The bad guilds will just fall apart or lose all their decent raiders.
---
MaNGOS had been in developent since 2005.

---
It gives you an easy to use Authentication and World content server daemons with many powerful features.

---
wonder if there is a message on it
---
Excuse me, what about Lineage 2 and MU ?
---
It can be counterspelled yeah
---
He looks like he's thinking "I can take it" lol
---
ears not long enough to be night elf
---
Can confirm that in the beta, you can send your pet on a target you see in stealth and if they move away from you and disappear your pet will chase them down. Did this in wsg yesterday
---
Controversial specifically means comments or posts with close to a 1:1 upvote to downvote ratio, so at least it’s not sorting through “bad” posts necessarily
---
Ninjas gonna ninja.  With the return to community, that can be fixed.  Blacklisting a player works wonders.  It did in vanilla, it will in classic.
---
If you systematically need to have your workers do serious overtime it means you need to hire more people. If you want to reach those deadlines you need to hire more people.
---
It’s insane to me that we have to go back t a 100year + old topic about why 40 hour work weeks should be the max.
---
These exact same excuses where used by factory owners employing children/working people to death.
---
Why does everyone refuse to learn from the past?
---
for ?
---
Nope, restrictions will also be based on the legion API. No more decursive or one button rotation macros. Z
---
That is a lot of salt!
---
I’ll repeat my comment:
---
It’s insane to me that we have to go back to a 100year + old topic about why 40 hour work weeks should be the max.
---
I think that bit will be fine. What I'm more concerned about are the bugs people are finding in beta where they can exploit forced layer hopping. I'm sure Blizz is working on that but I'll feel better once it's fixed.
---
I mean the tagging mobs one was a huge nerd rage inducer for me back in the day. Not getting a mount till 40 is also something that comes to mind. It's been so long I kind of forget everything that has changed but I am sure there are more. I actually plan on checking out Classic when it launches just to remind myself how good I have it these days lol. Seriously though more power to you folks who want it. Glad they are finally giving it you as it's been requested for a long time now.
---
I highly doubt it will make it worse.
---
But you're correct that layering has absolutely nothing to do with login queues.
---
I've always done it solo
---
Yup, I'll most like make my shaman 30 ele and 20 resto. Now for the last point, I'll go EM if I'm focused on PVP and NS if I'm needed for the raid. Altho I do plan on having a lvl 60 shaman, it won't be my main or 1st 60 so raiding might not happen much.
---
But those sweet sweet chain lightning crits in AV will be a ton of fun!
---
No you just miss understand. You would have multiples of the same realm like ragnaros 1 2 3 4, that players can not switch between unlike layering where you are constantly switching layer.
---
Good bot
---
Hence it should be clearble first or second week WF
---
Mages are not nearly as good griefers as rogues or hunters, but healing difficult mobs with polymorph while warriors etc are already struggling with them have guarranteed me a seat next to Satan himself
---
Nah, do it progressively. 2 X Your level.
---
That way when you hit level 60 you creep up to 120 pushups.
---
LAPTOPS, ALL OF YOU
---
Are you famililar with a calendar? Its June not the end of August...
---
I mean as a Paladin I’m not even remotely concerned about warriors until AQ40
---
I don’t even attack warriors while leveling because they’re so weak lol
---
I don't mind layering. I just want the exploits fixed.
---
Horde have slightly better racials, but I have memories from vanilla of getting steamrolled by alliance premades (better than horde premade)
---
&gt;When was the last time you played Vanilla WoW? I've played Warrior on multiple Vanilla private servers.
---
I played a Warrior on ACTUAL Vanilla WoW, I'm also a 2x Gladiator from Seasons 2 and 3 as a Warrior.
---
You playing against some helmet headed kids on a private server which is just full of the absolute shittiest players you could find is not a good barometer.
---
&gt;I'm not some idiot who isn't remembering the game correctly.
---
You absolutely are an idiot, this much is certain.
---
You literally have 2 ways to close distance on a player and one requires you out of combat, you have one of the most reliable (and overall weakest) slows in the game and you have no real way to reset a fight.
---
I'm gonna skip Mages Warlocks and Druids since you already admitted defeat on those (despite Warlocks maybe the easiest class for you to 1v1).
---
So that leaved "Rogues, Hunters, Priests, Shamans, or Paladins".
---
This is all with equivalent gear.
---
Rogues smoke you 100%, if its not through a stun lock into death then through a bleed kite, he sits in your intercept/charge deadzone with 70% (YES 70%) crippling poison on you whilst he just lets you bleed out, he eventually comes back in when his cooldowns permit and reapplies his poison/bleed again.
---
Good rogues can 100-0 a Warrior without even being hit, you literally dont have the toolkit to handle them straight up.
---
Hunters lol, easily going to ass blast you in equivalent gear, they are going to trap you at the start get distance -&gt; feign -&gt; another trap -&gt; shoot you&gt; intercept into other trap -&gt; they move away -&gt; they kite and the fight is over.
---
Again 1v1 they absolutely demolish warriors.
---
Priest my god, you wont even get through their shield before dying, no matter what spec they are you will be smoked. Rage starved smacking a shield that doesnt allow you to generate any rage while dotting you and ruining you the whole time. 
---
Honestly this is the class you listed that let me know you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
https://youtu.be/REs0GtRJOAE?t=347
---
Here is a Disc priest beating two geared warriors at the same time, had he correctly shielded at the start he likely wouldnt have even damaged the entire fight.
---
Shamans.
---
Oh man are you going to be really upset by good shamans, no matter the spec they are going to absolutely ruin you.
---
Frost Shock kiting you around, all their damage is unmitigated by your armor, dedwarrior
---
Same for Paladins really, they are going to whittle you down regardless of specs, ret might be your best bet to beat them but really its a toss up if they just crush you with Socom procs.
---
All in all Warriors are easily the worst 1v1 class in the game, thats their point, they have massively exposed weaknesses that when covered up (healbots) make them into little murder balls.
---
If you go in expected your choice of Warrior to carry you into godhood as you stomp around on other classes you are woefully misinformed, go watch a no nonsense classic video like Laintimes and look at the amount of work he needs to put in to BARELY beat bad players of each class whilst rocking top tier gear.
---
You think you are going to be running around white critting like MAydie for 1800 when in reality you'll be critting for 800 once before never touching your opponent again.
---
Who gives a shit. If we all get kicked off the server because it crashes then we all get kicked off the server because it crashed.
---
If we don't then we all play together.
---
Doesn't matter, as we're likely to share our experience no matter what!
---
having played through the harder cata dungeons and tbc heroics playing with whoever wanted to come it was not different at all. you coached the shitters through the dungeon and it was fine, it was the exact same as tbc /2 groups.   
---
saying "there's an intangible difference i cannot explain" is not an argument.  
---
like whats the difference between the guy who replied to my /lf1m dps H SL vs the guy who queued for it? suddenly this guy became a brainless ape incapable of human speech wtf kind of mental gymnastic is required for this thought process?   
---
again the reason LFD gets a bad wrap is because it was released in wrath, just before cata, so all these players used to absolute cheese dungeons, never having to talk to their group, suddenly had to talk to their group and not knowing the fights, what to cc, what to burst and how to control boss fights they blamed their group and subsequently lfd. so dungeons get nerfed hard. suddenly lfd is a joke only worthy of leveling grinds to do occasional quests.

now lets look at dungeons in the modern era, do you chat to your mythic+ groups? fuck no but you had to go through the effort of picking them individually right? you had to walk there and summon right? theres your time investment so whats gone wrong? it's because they're wrath dungeons 6.0 too easy from the jump and speed run by default. absolutely nothing to do with lfd more to do with gearscore/ilvl honestly made a bunch of elitist retards out of the worst players. 'look at my gearscore' 'look at your itemization'
---
Of course it will be.
---
Don't watch the water boil.
---
Put the ingredients in already. 
---
I'm hungry.
---
I tried it on the stress test and it sucked dick with leeway
---
You don't get xp in bgs in vanilla. I think that was added in wrath or cata
---
I am pretty certain going Enhance. also want to tank as a shaman as long as I can.
---
Though when I look at it, an Elemental build with the intent of primarilly meleeing might be the best "enhance" build there is. 
---
In all honesty you would have a rough time gearing Enh anyway, so if you intend to Raid it would just be easier to gear up as Resto. But find a guild who doesn't mind lesser performance as long as it isn' preventing completion (which enh would not as long as you don't fail) and you should be fine as Enh.
---
That's probably a good idea. I'd say I will follow suit on that but if I'm being honest, I will still probably going to join the chaos on day one and stick with the server I picked come hell or high water just like I did with my original main.
---
That only removes charm, fear or sleep
---
Perplexity has played dwarf too tho
---
Enh was also messed up on Pservers. People have already tested that it's not quite as bad in actual Classic.
---
You either play with Gnomes or you punt Gnomes, the choise should be obvious.
---
You know what the furbolg offhand grind entailed right? 
---
A random 60 wouldn't just help you for hours and hours to get the rep...
---
I did this when it first came out. It will be great to be reset to this state again.
---
Well, in the current retail game the classes are so perfectly balanced that everyone has practically the same spells and abilities. Everyone has a stun, some form of cleanse, ranged/melee spells regardless of class. It’s all snowballed into this silly thing where no class feels very unique anymore. Your class is your lens in which you see this game, and homogenized classes mean a very stale game. Sure, rogues and mages are different because mages cast spells and rogues use melee, but the core abilities usually have similar effects and patch to patch, there is constant balancing going on to ensure raid/PvP viability.
---
For what its worth I remember the first few weeks being really engaging on a hour by hour level. People were linking greens in chat and congratulating each other. It lasted way beyond the first day. 
---
Don't let the hype fool you, tons of people will be trickling in over time. You will have no shortage of people who're experiencing what you are, when you are.
---
Because there is a "world". It's alive, it breathes, it lives. Your name means something, your class means something, even your spec means something.
---
Where did you get 64 days till classic? It comes out next month lol
---
Thought that was for the upgrade quests, not the Tier 0 dungeon sets.
---
I didn't once make mention of overtime. In fact the method I described above reduces the need for overtime because you are fixing less and testing less per sprint. Instead of one giant patch you are making several smaller ones that fit together like a puzzle.
---
You will though need on call staffing the day of patch launch/push. Typically we take volunteers and end up shorting the rest of those people's work week. But I am also at a very good company.
---
Retail WoW just isn't even an RPG anymore, it's more like a loot based action game. I mean, you don't even get any talents or skills from level 100 to 120... what is even the point of those levels existing? So the mobs in the world can scale and get harder to kill? It's just backwards to how Classic works. Sure there are a ton of QoL features missing, but the game is so fundamentally different that I don't think they will be as noticeable as you think.
---
Whoever they are,  they are doing the Lord's work, and must be protected at all cost.
---
If I have the money to buy a regular Epic Mount, I'll buy the mount.
---
If Guild consumables and other duties takes a majority of my earnings I'll wait, do the quest and sell my services to other Warlocks so they can save money.
---
I know this would be against the "no changes" and I would usually prefer that as well but the 0.5 sets seemed like such a waste by time they're introduced. And I wouldn't mind seeing this sets introduced at the same time BWL is, their power level seems more inline. Plus, it'll give players something to do while waiting for the BWL weekly reset. Because by the time they normally introduce 0.5, there plenty of better things to do and most will already have better gear and no incentive to complete the 0.5 quest line.
---
All of Classic content will be released in 6 phases so BWL will not even be out in the first month.
---
A. I mean, if it were just THAT easy, don't you think they would have done this already? This is literally the easiest and probably one of the better solutions, but they're not doing it for probably a legitimate reason(s). Pretty sure it's off the table unless they're given more resources. I can't disagree that spinning up servers would be great, but uhhh it's off the table it seems. I mean, you may as well just say "Hey, Blizz has money and infinite human resources, just spin up 1000 classic servers", based on that logic. Layering would be the next best thing it seems, with whatever restrictions they have going on.
---
B. That's a vague and unacceptable answer. Dynamic spawns are crap and vastly more exploitable than layering or sharding or whatever. It's been proven in a ton of videos and writeups, along with clear evidence in the auction house.
---
Yes, I read your initial statement. hard to miss since it's right there. I'm not disagreeing with it nor am I not saying that you're saying it's better or worse; so I'm unsure where you're going with that response and why you reiterated. I agree there are more options, probably simply not explored and/or tested or even having time to test it since they're already knee-deep in layer testing. It's all probably too late at this point.
---
Well the root break is massively better on its own. However there is so many ways to break roots. You have vanish, imp stealth and then all the different trinkets and potions that can be used. 
---
I think gnome is overall better for premade pvp, and less gear reliant(they don't neccesarily have to play imp sprint unlike dwarfs), which makes them better overall. 
---
I still pref dwarfs though
---
Laugh at him for twinking in the first place.
---
3 buttons plus the 20 other ones for totems. 
---
I mean, are you really complaining about a VANILLA class having 3 buttons for primary attacks like that is not AHEAD of the average?
---
Enh actually needs a lot of buttons at the ready, especially in PVP. I mean you actually would use 2 ranks of Earth Shock and Frost shock as needed for either damage or just the effect.
---
&gt; They were deceptive to the consumer and made it sound like the game was a carbon copy of vanilla and it couldn't be further from the truth.
---
Nostalrius was able to build this in a basement... with a box of scraps! It's pretty sad that an unofficial nonprofit server is more blizz-like than Blizzard's attempt.
---
That's insane. Speaks to the dedication to the game necessary, but also that you need social skills to be the chosen one. I suppose it was the guild master or the most active raider who got the honor then. Thanks for the write-up.
---
&gt;every multiplayer content has been nerfed to the point where a mindless keyboard smasher can complete it.
---
For the world content, that's true.
---
But raiding has always been at the core of what the endgame of WoW is about and raids in modern WoW are vastly more complex and engaging mechanic wise than they were in Vanilla.
---
The difficult part about raiding in Classic will be to assemble the group, after that it's pretty much going to be easy mode for most raids.
---
Well i think the problem wasn't that they delayed the opening, but rather that they decided to blackmail the server for something that essentially was a community effort. From what i remember, only the US GMs were not very pleased about this and EU didn't give a shit.
---
But i don't remember every detail anymore and google didn't give me good results.
---
You can't get Darkmantle till AQ anyway. So it would be 6 piece Shadowcraft. Which again depends on the proc rate.
---
Fisty rogue.

NA | PvP | Alliance 
---
**Main Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesday: 9-12 EST
---
Wednesday: 9-12 EST

* Reliable raiders who can consistently perform at a high level.  This includes preparation such as consumables and enchants.
---
* Players who are willing to accept constructive feedback on performance and make adjustments
---
* Team players who are committed to a fun and productive raiding environment
---
**What we offer:**
---
* A transparent loot council system based on raider preference and guild needs, with item priorities published ahead of raids in a viewable spreadsheet

---
* A community for vanilla wow beyond raiding

Alright cool! Consider yourself lucky. I have read numerous of comments in here, saying they would wish they could experience classic all over again. It's something completely different, and my best advice for you is to not follow any guides besides the most fundamental class guides in classic. Finding yourself confused and simultaneously amazed about the world, spells, what new zones to conquer etc is amazing. Have a great ride! :)
---
They think they can walk to rag and kill him but you need a certain amount of fire resist first. To level professions to make the gear or farm it for all 40 raid members will take more than 2 weeks at the very least.
---
That's a pro move
---
Even Joana knows his record is going to get smashed buddy.
---
&gt;zone would favor horde as reinforcements or passersby are c
---
In Feralas Alliance also have a FP on the far east side on the border of 1k Needles. Granted, in order to get further in they either have to run through the wild area and agrro everything or run on the road through the horde town.
---
At the very least you should link the different builds you're considering.
---
What are they doing to destroy the economy? I haven't heard the news yet.
---
&gt;B. That's a vague and unacceptable answer. Dynamic spawns are crap and vastly more exploitable than layering or sharding or whatever. It's been proven in a ton of videos and writeups, along with clear evidence in the auction house.
---
What a sad bunch of lies.
---
No, you see, Blizzard has the reference code. Therefore it must be  "working as intended" and we're totally just remembering things wrong.
---
Dungeons are going to be interesting for dinging healers.
---
&gt;Be flexible in release schedules
---
Did you see the state of this sub before getting the release date ?
---
If they were to postpone launch, you would have to call the Marines to protect Blizzard employees from the raging crowd (and I wouldn't bet on the marines ! ) :D
---
I use a chair from my dining table set.. its a leather L shaped chair and I swear its the best - no back pain ever from playing. 
---
My biggest problem with PC gaming is hunching forward.
---
So what about eventual dead servers that we know will come?
---
I don’t like layering one bit but this is the problem I can’t solve
---
Yeah only World Bosses were affected by the leash, any lesser beings are still kiteable.
---
Druids are the best.
---
They seem to really care in what they're doing, honestly. I've watched them talk about it in a couple videos and they're pretty content on delivering as promised. I don't know what physical, financial, or virtual restrictions they have going on that made them choose layering, but it seems they're using their best tools available for it. Pretty sure those devs love vanilla as much as their audience does. Hoping for the best regardless.
---
Yikes dawg
---
&gt;I mean, are you really complaining about a VANILLA class having 3 buttons for primary attacks like that is not AHEAD of the average?
---
It really isn't.
---
There was an excellent post on here a couple days back by one of the mods regarding this. I'll try to find it.
---
What a sad, sad answer. Again. Keep replying with literally nothing to show. That works really well for you fella.
---
Even if it's not permanent, it's effect will be. The people who race to 60 will be able to exploit the hell out of layers before they are gone, and that will completely wreck the economy for the remainder of the game's life.
---
What's gonna be your guys duo?  I will also be leveling with my wife (Pally/Lock).
---
Don't level resto. Enhance is meant as the leveling spec.
---
Limited games? The 00's had a shit ton of PC game releases. What are you on about?
---
Not sure how useful that is. I would prefer boat/zeppelin routes.
---
My Tauren shaman in classic was named Porkgrinds
---
Loved that name
---
yeah! I just posted the comment, the whole album is in it and has the routes :D
---
I bet the truth stings.
---
You can also opt out of the remastered graphics and play the original, during the stress test it wouldn’t let you go above 4 on the scale. Should be good bro.
---
You’re excited now... wait until 50 of us are gathered in the Barrens try to complete same slow spawn rate quest.
---
Ugh...ty.
---
You have nothing to show. You make baseless claims with no shred of evidence.
---
Jesus.
---
The Gnomish Cloaking Device does not require Gnomish Engineering to learn, create, equip, or use. It’s available to all engineers of 200 skill or higher.
---
Its either layering or 2 day queues. When all the weaklings leave they’ll probably remove it.
---
omg. Flashbacks
---
Oh man, 2006 comments
---
Thanks for your work bud
---
Keep the ban hammer lubed up, OP all upset that their 45 pixel strimmer memez got deleted are the type of folks dragging this sub down quickly..
---
&lt;That's Rough Buddy&gt; NA PvP Alliance is a group of individuals who have a deep passion for World of Warcraft.  Many of us have been playing since 2005.  Some of us even meeting back then creating great friendships that have lasted 14+ years. Currently our roster is sitting at 30+ dedicated members who are active on discord or playing together on private servers to pass the time waiting for release.
---
We are looking for all players who want to be part of a Semi-Hardcore guild planning to be in the top 5 for our server to clear Naxxramas.  This will mean raiding 2-3 times a week with attendance needing to be on the higher side as well as knowledge of your class or willingness to learn to help us get over those hurdles on tough boss fights.   
---
Our raiding philosophy is to have fun.  Watching videos and passing tests to prove you understand the boss encounters and your role will be required to join raid groups as well as a minimum gear level with full enchants and consumables.   Once those requirements have been met, mistakes won't be punished. We're here to laugh, to cry, to kill some bosses, and get killed by bosses as a team.
---
Please add me on discord @ Smalls#5019 for more information!.
---
Those are some stringent demands to level...but whatever turns your crank.
---
All the phase 1 pre-raid BIS lists exclude tier 0 gear.   I think it's all coming out later.
---
Stranglethorn Vietnam....me and my enhancement shaman can't wait
---
We always played this in IT class in school back in the days! It was amazing!
---
Sure is...
---
Do i have the money to sue a billion doller company? Hell no.
---
Chances are im gone loose - pay for everything and end up jobless. 
---
Should i just go gamble with my life like that? ...obv not.
---
Exactly. 
---
None of Blozzard's big games have been terribly original as overall concepts, but they were able to deliver graphical appeal that was easy on hardware and streamlined interfaces that were intuitive. They took existing models and made them more accessible.
---
What the hell, lol how is this fair? This would mean horde is ..... downvote? Oh come on, where's is the love for the horde? Well I play both... FOR AZEROTH!
---
Having an opinion doesn't mean others cant disagree with it.
---
I was like 12 years old when wow came out. I was obsessed with making Twinks
---
So much so that I made two before I even got my main to 60. I talked to people and got help for all the gear I needed. Yes I would help them with my main for whatever they needed help with, but a lot of the time people wouldn’t expect anything in return 
---
But you keep telling me about my experiences on vanilla wow
---
Was human trinket in classic? only played since tbc
---
&gt; flashbacks
---
I see what you did there :)
---
Lol so messed up haha
---
Layering kill world pvp because you can just switch layers to avoid it.
---
Layering abuse can allow group of aoe mage to level faster than any one else.
---
Layering will allow top guild to abuse it to farm devilsaur/black lotus and other things that can permanently fuck up the economy.
---
Yes it is. Any of those abilities to get out of combat is enough to say the combat is over if at least one participant chooses.
---
I mean a simple google for "dynamic spawn exploit" does indeed seem hard for you to comprehend based on your short and disappointing responses. You literally have nothing to show or refute, at all, and are otherwise just projecting very hard at this point. Your post is a waste of time, it seems, as you're not bringing up any more valid pros or cons. Just replying with "sad" is, well, sad in itself. Keep responding with your one-liners to my replies though - it's giving me a good chuckle each time.
---
It’s not worth getting ever. Let alone in Naxx.

Thanks. I appreciate the insight.
---
I mean, a lot of streamers are Alliance. Asmongold is pretty obnoxious :P
---
You can't say the same for the Horde. Have you ever tried punting a Tauren? It doesn't work.
---
Amen
---
I'll take the Karma hit with you: I too want a toggle. 
---
I want a toggle for HD textures and models of everything they've re-textured/re-modeled in the modern game. I want to play the glory that is original World of Warcraft in HD. (Except those awful animations; they can keep those.)
---
I hate the new models with a passion, even in the current game. I hate them so much that I would not even play Classic if they were toggleable. I had to find a new main because they ruined the taurens in retail.
---
So no, I would not like the new models, not even a toggle. This isn't even a #NoChanges thing, I just think they look fucking horrid, stupid and bouncy.
---
If it was toggleable, it would be nagging me in the back of my mind that someone might be using the new models, making me look like a bouncing idiot on their screen. 
---
It's fine if you like them, but keep them in retail please.
---
I remember seeing a ton of Orcs and Trolls dancing on the Valley of Trials campfire. That was an interesting sight for a first time MMO player! 
---
I ended up exploring, and somehow got to Stranglethorn Vale. As a level 5 Orc Warrior. Someone walked up to me in Booty Bay and asked why I was there and if I needed help. I replied "I'm a Noob" and ran off, haha.
---
Sad
---
Look at the down votes, most likely all by people with 0 factual information about weight training, bodybuilding and diet
---
How stoneform works is well documented so it works the same on Pservers and Classic.
---
It was popular because it was the right product at the right time.
---
See Fortnite for today's equivalent.
---
Erm. That's a bit of an extreme way to look at it don't you think?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXylJZuVLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXylJZuVLY)
---
Twink meta go!!!!
---
They most likely have a very small team on classic wow. It will probably take too much time to change all the models
---
Now we know why duskwood is haunted
---
Probably, but it's genuinely how I feel about  the new models.
---
Lotros legendary server has a guild callef Grumpy Olf People. But i think you need to be 50+ to get in

Are you me?
---
You want to tank and do melee dps.
---
Why not roll a warrior? They are extremely good at those two roles, while the shaman is really bad at those roles. 
---
I mean sure, you can find a mediocre guild struggling to fill spots that might let you in as a dps shaman. If you were a warrior you would be sought after for those roles from even the best guilds.
---
People often say to this argument that warriors are overpopulated. They won't be. It isn't possible that there will be too many warriors.
---
Also, every single poll I've seen, every single one, show there being more shamans than warriors horde side.

I think perhaps its the new animations that bother you? They bother the heck out of me too. A toggle for the models wouldn't have to include the terrible animations.

Do you have one with zone levels and dungeon locations and levels?

Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding
---
Synopsis: Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
Focus: Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
Playstyle: Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. Wed/Thurs 6pm-10pm(11pm if progression) EST.
---
Are we a good fit? - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
If Interested Contact Me Directly. Thank you for reading this post.
---
I'd really like to use the new models too, I think retail wow looks fantastic. I'm not super bothered by classic character models, but I can't help but think how much better my character would look with the effort all those artists and animators put into them. 
---
I understand others just want to keep 100% authentic, so a toggle would be great. Though its probably a lot more complicated on the backend than just putting a switch somewhere
---
Everything you can exploit on dynamic respawn, you can just as well exploit even easier with layering just by switching layers. And things like gurubashi arena chest, rare mobs, black lotus are only exploitable with layering.
---
And  dynamic respawn don't ruin world pvp at least.
---
You don't even have to count calories to lose weight, just pay attention to your body's signals. Are you eating because you're bored or sad? Don't. Are you eating because it's mealtime? Don't. 
---
Eat when you're hungry. If you aren't hungry it means you've over-eaten for so long that you need adjustment. Just wait, it'll take some time but real hunger will return. 
---
Everytime you over-eat youe body makes you a little less hungry the next day. Everything is beautifully managed like that by nature.
---
Both are good. But dwarf is better imo because it allows you get the edge on your 3 worst counters: hunters, warriors, and rogues who get the opener.
---
Mostly, yes. If it was the graphics only in a toggle, I could maybe  be okay with it.
---
Nah man. Games like FF7 Remake are drawing WAY more eyes than Classic.
---
So are most classes

I got no source other than first handed memory of getting exalted with WSG in 1.12, but I'll say I remember being able to track EFC if you could mouse over them or had line of sight during the x-realm BG patch.  So, until someone on your team had sight, EFC's would not be displayed to everyone else.  And if that someone died and the EFC escaped to the tunnel or building I recall it going away.
---
I'm impressed

Hi impressed, I'm dad.

They’re actually quite bad but still entertaining.

Been there, done that a couple times now with F R E S H classic private servers. It truly is a great feeling and experience.
---
That isn't healthy to not do cardio though
---
By far the biggest game in by far the smallest most niche genre.

Good old Detheroc.  The salt and forum drama was intense.  Was fun playing horde oragnized pvp groups and shitting all over the premades from Imperial Order.  Good times...
---
Welcome to Instagram
---
"the first server would be completely packed and would have nearly the same problems as servers without layers."
---
Most problems will be on the starter zone, if you see your starter zone is too full you can just recreate your character on another sub server. And most people wouldn't be dumb to choose the first one anyway.
---
Some of my fondest memories from vanilla are when a Horde guild &lt;The Tide&gt; and an Alliance Guild &lt;Ye Olde Goon Squade&gt; blockaded Blackrock Mountain and ganked or mindcontrolled into the lava anyone who tried to go to one of the Blackrock dungeons, then when people complained they said they were 'Enhancing your RP'.
---
At the time I wasn't too fond of it but looking back it was pretty funny.

I logged into retail and made a Druid. I casted at mobs endlessly and never ran out of mana, never had to worry about pulling too many and never had to work to get anything. That’s not fun for me. If it’s fun for you, ok....but I don’t get it anymore than I get kpop

Feral Druid:
---
* If you're playing feral correctly, your DPS rotation is extremely complicated compated to other classes. You will have to cat-weave in the middle of your rotations and time it perfectly between energy ticks.

* While there is nothing wrong with feral, you will need to put in ten times more effort to remain competitive with other DPS classes.

* You will have to find a guild or convince a raid group that feral is not just some meme spec. Be ready for a lot of diplomacy. Never mess up or there's a good chance you won't be coming back.
---
* You will have to farm Gnomeregan... A LOT.
---
* You will rarely die in PvP, but you will hardly do any damage. Be prepared to be a dedicated flag defender in Arathi Basin.
---
I will be leveling one for sure, but be prepared to prove yourself.
---
I imagine it'd be quite a bit of work to make the new models to work with old animations.
---
Propably wouldn't use them, but I don't see the harm.
---
What do you mean by creep? Please tell me you don't mean mobs.
---
Very debatable.
---
Ion said [two months for each of the first two phases](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=572). We'll probably get BWL and BGs just after the New Year.
---
It's not supposed to last very long either. A few months tops from what I understand from dev interviews.
---
I recently found some weird specs and itemisation for people who play melee or tank hunters, tank or  shamans, arcane powered hunters, poison rogues , spell powered warriors, which ironically do work for 5-10 man and in some situations on raiding. 
---
Specifically I am going for the spell power warrior setting. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg of the crazy things we might see during classic’s lifespawn just because some people like to differentiate from others. 
---
I remember a dwarf priest was main tanking Onyxia and some tier one bosses back in my old guild. Smite priests + retr paladins combo, melee waving warlocks, slam spec warriors, sockadin pvp burst, protection warrior pvp spec (requires a trinket from naxx for the +2k crits) and some other goof/odd balls might try something :) 
---
Ofc in order for those to succeed they will need to go really try-hard, compared to the ordinary rogues or mages who do competitive dps just by existing.
---
You're just wrong.
---
Not currently, but that could be an easy fix!  That said, I know someone already made one recently (w/o flight paths).  I can't seem to find it rn though.
---
Afaik layering will still be a lot of players per layer, so on launch you will still have a ton of people in each starting area (at least enough that there'll be more players than mobs). The only difference will be that the mobs take a lot longer to spawn, right? I don't see how that is any better. I'd much rather  get my quest done within a couple of mins, and get into multiple groups within the first few minutes of playing, than wait around forever so mobs finally spawn, praying that I won't have to wait another eternity if someone tags it before I can. You'd have to limit layers to like 30 players per layer to not have any issues with getting enough mobs and I prefer to see 100+ people as I start the game on launch day tbh.
---
Credits to u/compatshe for the awesome art.
---
Damn :(
---
I'd rather quote Ion, who said [two months for each of the first two phases](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=572). We'll probably get BWL and BGs just after the New Year.
---
So you want to group with someone for an instance, and you have to go back to a city to change layers? Fuck that.
---
Have a cooldown of 3 minutes after you pvp or gather a node/chest to prevent you from changing layers. No changing while in combat.
---
&gt; We'd rather be remembered as the obnoxious guild that held a server hostage than one forgotten for bringing it new content. 
---
Fucking love it.
---
Hunter: you will spend all day on the LFG channel failing to get invited into PUGs.
---
Makes more sense to just play enhancement.  He'll, some guilds give shaman priority on the eye.
---
WoW was my first entry into the Warcraft series at all. Around level 15 or so I said to myself, "This is just a watered down version of Ultima Online... but it sure is nice not having to chop down trees for wood to make my own arrows, or kill wildlife to get food to cook."
---
this isnt vanilla, its classic. not everything is going to be the same. the population and projections for classic are going to be massive. The 3k you are speaking of was how many (roughly estimated) concurrent players played on each server, not the max it could hold. You really think Blizz is going to have a cap at 3k per server and host 100s of servers on launch? Lets say 500k people come back, and we know its gonna be a hell of a lot more than that, but for example, 500k, thats 167 servers. just for half a mil. Plus, what happens when the rush ends? Give it a few months, less people are playing, blizz said they wouldnt merge servers. So, now what? They have 167 servers and you are bound to find 10-15 that will have economical issues and people will just transfer off till the server dies.
---
Different? Yes. Better? We have yet to see. If layering remains, private servers will have had better launches/classic WoW feels.
---
100 squats will burn like hell with all that lactic acid
---
Cool. I'd rather be able to actually play the game.
---
Oh holy shit, I didn't even notice that until now lol
---
Yo can someone ban this guy? He's literally impersonating the ooga gang guys with a fake youtube channel. They have their OWN channel, this kid is straight up trying to steal their content and pass it off as his own...

EU - Alliance - PVE - No loot council - Hiya, me and my partner are looking to join a guild has a casual schedule but skilled/well prepared players. Looking for something thats focuses more on high quality raiding over quantity i.e 3 days a week would be fine. Planning to play druid/x (warrior, priest, rogue, or mage). Druid would like to offtank. Not a fan of loot councils due to past experiences of officers just using them to gear themselves and their clique. Willing to consider a loot council guild if there are set-in-stone rules in place on how its done.   
---
I have extensive raid leading experience from TBC, WOTLK and Wrath. Partner was a bank officer and a very successful mt for a raiding guild for a number of years.
---
That shit is toxic. Social media in general is. Even Reddit. You need to get ahead of that shit.
---
Just choose a good one.
---
The social aspect of Classic is what makes it so appealing. 
---
You don't simply quick a button, get thrown into a full group of faceless "Heros" and absentmindedly kill some boss for a piece of loot that is good, not great but better than not good. Regardless you've got badges that let you get that piece of gear everyone else has and is considered the "best".
---
While retail may have better story telling devices / elements, I think they miss the mark in the bigger picture of things. When I stopped playing after Cata / MoP I felt like every quest was me, some tremendous and special savior of the world, needing to go out and kill 20 Naga or else the world would be destroyed. By the end, every quest was white noise.
---
In Classic, it's more "bare bones" storytelling, but I really felt like some random traveler who slowly gets more and more credibility, brushing elbows with key lore figures, but by the end I'm still another brick in the wall, maybe more proven than most. This let's me live out my power fantasy and gives weight to everything I do.
---
Classic has a story that is wholly player created and owned before you even get to the dungeon. Finding some friends, finding a group, finding and getting accepted into a guild with similar minded players, proving your worth as a great healer, DPS or leader in general, building trade relationships with farmers and guild bank alts to move wholesale materials behind the Org Zeppelin... These types of interactions give us a World rather than a Theme Park.
---
I've always been orc at heart ever since reading *Lord of the Clans* and the Warcraft III campaigns, so when the game was announced there was naturally no other role I was going to be than a proud green orc. I didn't buy the game at first though - I made a toon on a friend's account to try it out. 
---
I wanted to name my orc Brox or Broxigar but of course those were both taken. *War of the Ancients* fans really took to him. After all, he made a god bleed. While Thrall made me want to roll an orc, Brox made every orc fan go "*Fuck yeah, I'm rolling a warrior."* I guess being a Saurfang makes you automatically badass, but the legend of High Overlord Saurfang was yet to be revealed, as was the fact that he was the little brother of Brox. He was just badass. If you are an orc warrior reading this and haven't read the *War of the Ancients* series, do yourself and favor and marathon it.
---
But he was taken. So I rolled with Brox's orc friend in the book. Who got crushed into nothingness, black hole style, by some crazy tidal wave of time-magic.
---
Gaskal was born. 
---
...until level 8, when I crafted my Copper Battle Axe and decided I needed my own account. Gaskal was really born then, and I've identified with my main's name so much that it's become my username in several online games. And, of course, reddit.

That looks like a recipe for neck and back issues.
---
God why do I have to look at all the negative stuff first.
---
Hyyyypppeeee!!
---
Pro tip: skip the lazy peon quest and kill some boars outside the starting area. You don’t have to complete every single q to level in this game. It’s almost like they put mobs in the world tied to no quests for people to kill.
---
You don't need the TOS from then, you need the current one.
---
What ever you have to tell yourself, the mythic raiding does have some more mechanics... but it is like any other pve encounter, once you learn it, you learn it. 
---
2004, everything was hard... You died while leveling, the first 5 times i went in to any type of instance we wiped over and over again. 
---
The type of people that get to have a "challenge" in high level raiding are a small % of the player base in BFA, don't try to act like it is not..
---
Don’t get me wrong I’m trying to add onto your comment. 
---
&gt; I am also at a very good company
---
Exactly. Activision - blizzard is a shit company if they have these serious crunch times with the profits they make. Very simple.
---
I do feel like they did accidentally make it balanced. If they tried to balance it they would probably knock over the whole delicate house of cards. 
---
The only thing I will point out is that druids did more damage on private servers, and it didn't change much. They were still pretty much excluded from premades, other than wsg weekend.

[A] [NA] [PVP]

Long time raider since vanilla LF semi hardcore pve and casual pvp guild. I’m looking for a guild that has a team first mentality, raid preparations and knowledge are an requirement, and knows how to have a good time! I am available Mon-Thurs 7pm-10pm CST. I plan on playing rogue with a mage alt. I will be grinding to 60 from the start in order to quickly get pre-raid ready. If you think I would be a good fit in your guild, feel free to message me!
---
I want a combination of both. Not a pretty wallpaper but a one-stop map for levels and navigation options.
---
Sorry, u/compatshe is either deleted, banned, or doesn't exist.
---
I need to be leaning forward while i game. Idk why but sitting back feels awkward to me
---
Cool concept for console gaming, but wow does this look bad on your back for PC gaming, you'd have to lean so far forward to use the keyboard.
---
HAHA XD

I would rather have repetitive threads be closed than have it turn into r/wow where the entire sub is a wall of screenshots, low effort memes, or fan art and if you ask a game related question, it gets deleted with a weak canned mod response because how dare you pollute the sub with on-topic discussion.
---
No, I believe that was added later.
---
W H O L E S O M E
---
This is true if layering isn’t put in correctly for strictly the starting zones. Blizz has no idea how hardcore some people are lately. People be pushing mc in a week and pulling off crazy leveling speeds.
---
I see what you're saying, but I have to disagree and here's why; Dynamic Spawning is permanent, which is far more destructive. Layering is temporary, which seems fine as long as it is removed within 1-3 weeks(although the sooner the better). Exploiting Layering takes coordination and communication with other players, where as dynamic respawns can be done solo, with high frequency, and repeat. It can easily destroy part of a market.
---
Neither of those ruin world pvp. Even if they hop layers, they'll probably just pop into another area of pvp ending with the same fate. Its equivalent to hopping on an alt and playing and questing elsewhere, or going somewhere else in the world to get away, or even calling in reinforcements from a guild to help you. There are a hundred other ways to avoid world pvp and make it good or bad for anyone, other than layer hopping. There will always be groups of friends together ganking too, regardless if layers existed.
---
Bro I use the edge of my bed, a tv dinner tray, and a 55 inch tv from 2013.

---
Undead Priest is great for PVP because of Will of the Forsaken. Troll Priest is great for PVE because of Berserking.
---
Going more in depth, Undead Priests have the Priest racials Touch of Weakness and also Devouring Plague, while Troll Priests have the Priest racials Hex of Weakness and also Shadowguard.
---
**Touch of Weakness:** The next melee attack against the caster will cause 8 Shadow damage and reduce the damage caused by the attacker by 2 for 2 min.
---
**Devouring Plague:** Afflicts the target with a disease that causes 152 Shadow damage over 24 seconds. Damage caused by the Devouring Plague heals the caster.
---
**Hex of Weakness:** Weakens the target enemy, reducing damage caused by 2 and reduces effectiveness of healing spells by 20% for 2 minutes.
---
**Shadowguard:** The caster is surrounded by shadows. When a spell, melee or ranged attack hits the caster, the attacker will be struck for 20 Shadow damage. Attackers can only be damaged once every few seconds. This damage causes no threat. 3 charges. Lasts 10 min.

Are we even watching the same video? I’m referring to the gnome in IF.

A toggle would mean you can look at the old stuff while someone else uses new. Why would you refuse to play on the basis someone else sees new models? That's insane.
---
Do you still have the regular full Azeroth map with no drawings?
---
everything is working as intended and it was those fucking idiots on private servers who have tricked people into thinking the class should be playable, how many times do they need to be told that nothing on private servers is accurate?
---
Just to emphasize, warcraftmovies premium is a S\*C\*A\*M, a couple years ago I bought premium access, and not only is Holyfroggy correct that they have nothing in their archives, the site is set up so that you can't actually cancel your subscription, at least I couldn't. I tried contacting them (got ignored ofc), looked ALL OVER trying to find a way to unsub to no avail. I literally had to cancel my card to stop the payments.  
---
Don't use Warcraftmovies. Stick to Youtube.
---
Will be interesting to see how the populations are. Horde was always smaller until Blood Elves were introduced and they make up like 50% of the population.
---
&gt;19s is a trash bracket.
---
This, so much. There's like 3 or 4 "traditionally viable" builds (priest, hunter, rogue, warlock maybe). Stuff really opens up at higher levels, especially since you can really start to build on your talents.
---
Got you, I misread your post or took it as aggressive. Multi-tasking atm! So my apologies for coming off as equally aggressive. 
---
Yes, the answer is for Activision to hire more devs/better enable their now non-existent support staff to be able to head off T1 and T2 issues. Our support staff diagnoses 90% of our defects, so development only has to work on a fix. 10% of our defects Support fixes themselves without needing a code change. But either way we are given them in such a way that we have concrete steps to reproduce so we can hit the ground running for a fix.
---
There are going to be SO MANY layers at launch. Will be so fuckin stupid. 
---
That feeling when a private server feels more like vanilla than Blizzard's version.
---
The cost of changing the removing the DR between scatter and trap should be minor, so my bet is that one will be fixed. Fingers crossed. Not so sure on FD / trap, but that was an overwhelmingly used strat and PVP so should really get some priority, IMO...
---
Merging servers are way worse. 
---
* Looks like your game is failing
---
* Server you're merging with may be predominately non english.
---
* You can lose your character name
---
* Raiding guilds might get ruined because the members leave for better guilds on the new server
---
O V E R P O W E R
---
Oh good I'm not the only one.  That actually looks awful to me.
---
Feels bad to be alone :(
---
My thoughts exactly. These private server teams provided more than I’ve previously thought.....or blizzard is just truly sucking. I can’t get over the strafing issue on the stress test, and the backpedaling. I felt like these two things are very basic, and something that should’ve obviously been figured out prior to beta. I don’t understand how you can throw a beta out with such an obvious error that takes 2 seconds to see. Makes me worried for sure but we’ll see, there’s still two months.
---
I wish I was dead :( ugh being poor sucks I'm glad this country is collapsing
---
It isn't useless.  Enhancement shamans personal dps is cheap, but their overall contribution to the raid is quite respectable with nightfall.  You will be middle of the pack with nightfall and improved totems.
---
Elemental
---
My first experience in the online gaming world was a MUD called Illusia. It was fantastic and really got me into the genre.
---
Years later I picked up FFXI and I played it for many years. Once all my friends left for WoW I gave in and tried it out. You are correct that WoW made the MMO scene really casual. Compared to its predecessors the time commitment wasn't there at all. Hell, it took me well over a year of playing pretty hardcore to hit the level cap in FFXI. Not to mention exp loss on death.
---
Well yeah, you poke a 300kg mass of beef killing power and it doesn't end well. Gnomes can fly quite far if you have a running start.
---
For me, mostly accidental pulls of unaware or ignorant raid members. It sucks to wipe because one person just wanders around or is simply standing way too close.
---
Because if it's uncomfortable after less than 2 hours of use then what's the point.
---
OP needs a setup where they should be so comfortable that they could take a power nap in the chair for those times when the group is forming and you're already at the dungeon entrance
---
I think you uses .gifs wrong
---
As a former rank 8 gnome warlock, I can say WOTF is a mild annoyance. From a PvP standpoint, you can simply facetank anyone who breaks your fear with Soul Link. If they kick your searing pains, swap to drain life. 
---
I wasn't a gnome because of the racials, I was a gnome because I could stand in a bush and DPS everyone without being seen. All snares are easily reapplied, what is escape artist going to do? Maybe break frost nova so you don't get crit.. but you're already running felhunter, so you have plenty of resists. 
---
From a PvE standpoint, the reputation buff makes attuning easier. Humans make gear look decent if you can get it. Recommend rolling female because human male is a potato.
---
Probably why it's low on the list of priorities
---
In the early days, having a kid is like being a surgical resident. Eat when you can, sleep when you can, and don't mess with the ~~pancreas~~ kid when it's sleeping. I wouldn't play WoW when there's a lull in the madness. Do the self care stuff you can't do when the little one is awake.
---
"Getting gear in vanilla was just as easy as it is today"
---
**Scuse me while I run around in full blues and 2-3 purps by lvl 21**
---
I bet you it's before the new year, even before Christmas break.  It would make end of the year numbers look good even though they will be inflated due to the "new" content.
---
Met my husband during BC. We're ready for August :D
---
I relate to this a lot, and vanilla leveling really has no diminishing returns for me. But historically burnout in games always comes when I least expect it, so it pays to be careful.
---
I can't tell you the number of times I've been in one of those "once I finish grinding out x, I can move on to y and z!" situations and once x is done I realize my motivation to do y and z is totally gone without warning.
---
Hunter: the 49 known bugs aswell as everything else others have mentioned

\&gt;good arms warrior
---
He's gonna have FAPs. Now add windfury.
---
You need quite a lot of STR to equal enough to minimize the number of melee swings by one. Agi is better for melee. However both of these are wrong. You want Stam/Spirit gear as much as possible. This minimizes downtime and maximizes survivability. A large amount of your damage comes from searing totem, lightening shield, and weapon enchant. I think if you added these up it would equal roughly half of the damage to a mob with the other half being melee and shocks. Windfury is great 1/5th of the time. When you drop a mob in two swings and a shock its a good feeling. However in practice it just doesn't work that way. 
---
The better route is consistency based. Lots of spirit/stam/int in that order(at least for a pvp server). Keep your melee weapon "new" by picking up the top weapon from whatever instance is close to your level. Enhance until 40, elemental after. The 31 point talent in elemental is a 3min win button for world pvp. You will take about half of a person's life with CL crit. 
---
After 40 your kill would look like this. Weapon enchant(if needed), heal(if needed), LS, Searing totem, Mana totem(if you will stand in for the duration).. LB, LB, FS, melee until dead. By the time you are ready for the next pull you will have regenerated most of the mana spent if you keep to the 5sec rule. You can easily kill 10 mobs before having to drink. I would recommend using a fast 1h dagger with a shield and FT weapon. Otherwise if you can pick up a staff like the one from ZF use WF weapon(only because of the proc). 
---
In world pvp being safe(1h+shield), consistent(no WF), and dangerous(Elemental Mastery) is key to success. 
---
2H enhance is squishier(no shield), inconsistent(WF), dangerous when lucky(WF).
---
Ahh, the "fresh" meme incarnate.
---
This lasts for about a week.  After 2 weeks it'll be like the server has existed forever and that "fresh" feeling is totally gone.
---
Depending on how long Phase 1 lasts at the most. Hopefully the server issues settle down quickly so layering can be retired.
---
SOURCE.  There's not much to fuck up.
---
Vaelastrasz -&gt; People who don't know how to watch a threat meter.
---
Probably why people are saying that 1.12 make the game easier
---
Not a bad choice but from itemization/talent/spells/classes and few nerf of the content, 1.12 make Vanilla easier as it used to be in earlier patchs.
---
i want to wait in queue for 2 hours if it means the game isn't fucked for 2+ months.   
---
how is it not instant gratification?  
---
*  **Instant gratification** is the desire to experience pleasure or fulfillment without delay or deferment. Basically, it's when you want it; and you want it now.   
---
*  **Instant gratification** refers to the temptation, and resulting tendency, to forego a future benefit in order to obtain a less rewarding benefit.   
---
&gt;bingo. it's exactly why they're doing it.
---
&gt;people who think 'experiencing classic' is getting your quests done efficiently are in for a bit of a shock, streamers do not represent the experience well lol.
---
&gt;nobody is making this argument
---
??  
---
they had instances in 2004 dude. they just used it for dungeons and raids only, because instancing the open world went against the games model of being an open world mmo.
---
Free action potion.
---
Seconded. Can't spend 18 hours a day seven days a week on it this time round. Wish i could get the time off work though, i totally would.
---
Free Action Potion ^((I hope))
---
I think you replied to the wrong comment. I'm also questioning the statement
---
People forget just how OP holy paladins are in pvp. A warrior with freedom is a death sentence for anyone. Cleanse. BoP. Bubble. LoH. All of their buffs. Massive amounts of armor and quick Flash heals. 
---
They are just so fucking OP.
---
I'm in my thirties with a job and a kid. The game is grind enough for me as is without having to wait for things like mana and walking everywhere. Different strokes for different folks. Like I said I'm totally stoked for you guys that want it and I'll even be logging in for nostalgia purposes myself. Who knows maybe I'll even end up being a convert lol.
---
LOOT THE FUCKING HOUND PLEASE.
---
I get back from deployment the day after it launches I’ll be behind :(
---
I'd /wave to my fellow alliance player and carry on
---
Yes. We've tested it. It failed our tests. So it gets an F and needs to go away.
---
Sounded pretty bitter, more so with the other reply. Obviously it's good to have different hobbies too and no two people are going to have their hobbies completely overlap anyway, but I could never be with someone who thinks my most important hobby, which shapes my personality (gaming often does, as does many other "big" hobbies), is stupid. Way too often I see people speaking nonchalantly about sneakily getting some gaming time, having to lie and being shamed for just doing something they like. It's not part of a healthy relationship. People should support eachother, even if you aren't personally into it and sharing important hobbies reinforces the relationship. Relationships don't last and are just a disposable thing when the only contact to eachothers lives is watching Netflix few times a week.
---
I'm another long time Vanilla Hunter player leaning towards Warlock as well for Classic no joke xD
---
Same. Someone start a discord.
---
Well I mean, you shouldn't be going anywhere in a MMORPG PvP setting without a group, if you're not running with a premade...you should expect to git shit on. That goes for any MMORPG with PvP.
---
WoW's peak was 2008, not 2005
---
So.. is layering still engaged on the server?
---
Because if so, that is pretty clear evidence that Ion's description of layering as engaging only when the server is full is.. less than truthful. If layering is engaging when there are &lt;1000 people active on the server, the system cannot possibly be working as promised.
---
They should just do this dynamic spawning heavy in the starting zones depending on how crowded, then have it reduced. We all want to see everyone possibly in one area of the game at a time and some mob competition. A good balance of that will make a very good launch. You can’t please everybody, someone will always complain, but to receive the least amount of backlash would be to release it this way, and that way they can be savage blizzard when someone does complain and they can say, “you think you do but you don’t” and reddit praises them for eternity.
---
Agree to disagree.
---
I’ll take layering over mergers any day of the week and twice on sundays.
---
I mean first, yes it is possible there will be too many warriors. If everyone took the advice of "just roll a warrior for dps" then you are wasting 80% of the loot. Also you don't get more warrior loot just by having more warriors. People seem to think that just by rolling Warrior they will be guaranteed that 1100 dps gear setup. When like 1 warrior total will likely be getting to that point, until shit is on farm and no one cares.
---
Also, I played Vanilla. Day one till TBC. I played warrior already. i raided already. I was sought after already. I have no interest in doing Vanilla again the same way I did it. I want something new. Also, I don't care if I raid and very likely won't bother to do so seriously. Even if i did, there is no issue with finding a guild more interested in just doing it and less in doing it well. 
---
Also, because everyone deserves to play how they want and no, I never asked to be included in content I would "not be viable" for so I am not screwing anyone else over.
---
A lot of people had done this to practice leveling routes.
---
You know, it makes it also pretty easy to defend too.
---
Idk.  Idk anyone that was dumb enough to try it,lol.
---
obviously which ever side has the most popular streamer.  It is a huge advantage to be on the faction, when losing a pvp battle, be able to run away and kite the enemy into two or three other players that are questing near by.  The sheer number of bodies makes PVP so much nicer for the faction.  I was pretty pissed off being on a 1:8 ratio server for most of the time playing wow and I would just realm hop because anytime I thought I was going to kill an enemy, another one to four players come along and save him or her.
---
It's funny people complain how long it's taking and they want to play now. Then you read this thread and everyone wants the game to come out polished. You cant have both. 
---
I would play the game now and have them patch fix bugs. That is what they have done a lot of in the past, they are just bugs that where not know about untill it was exploited.
---
And a part of WoW has always been how you're viewed by the community and the new models would ruin that.
---
He is going to stick with his dagger/shield agi/spirit build.
---
Some bugs is apparently there since legion was relased and is due to the engine. I dont have much hope for those to get fixed as they aint even on live
---
Yeah agreed, do not level as Resto. Don't put any points into Resto until after 40 or 50. Make sure you're prioritizing Spirit on your gear to make up for lack of specialized healing abilities and let any groups know to mindful of your mana as you'll need to drink more than a Priest or Druid, even if they're also off spec. A lot of folks will argue to do your Water Totem quest after you're done leveling, because it is quite a trek all over Azeroth. If you're planning on healing dungeons off spec, I would get your Water Totem quest done by 28. Mana Tide can be a huge boon and help you keep up with chain pulls or mass AoE pulls. 
---
Of course, this should go without saying, always have down ranked healing spells easily accessible. From 22 to 30 Lesser Healing Wave and Healing Wave ranks can get redundant / awkward. Lesser Rank 1 / 2 and Healing Wave Rank 4 / 5 should give you a nice curve from "Not Much Damage" to "Oh Shit Big Heals, Big Heals".
---
Side Notes:
---
Spirit is probably the single greatest stat to pump while leveling. Spirit in Vanilla regens your mana AND your health. 
---
This in combination with Earthbind Totem to "weave" your auto attacks adds something like 50% damage reduction for solo questing / farming. 
---
Dump a couple points into Imp Ghost Wolf as soon as you can (at 20 or shortly after) will let you get out of dodge in a hurry should things get messy.
---
Absolutely not. Maybe for people who play WoW already, but not for the general gaming population.
---
Ya and I want gnome druids but they refuse to put them in the game. I'll just have to dream about the tiny little moonkin form they would have 😍
---
Horde will have the advantage, all the dicks play horde ... well except Asmon
---
Well if you are ignoring totems as "buttons" then you would be ignoring other situational buttons. Therefore yes, it is. hunters if you dumb down their rotation almost don't even have a single "button"
---
On which podcasts were they? I
---
Would really like to hear what else they have to say
---
Interesting. Wouldn't a single bstab after the tea work better so the kidney is 5cp assuming one initiative proc?
---
I'm a big fan of showing off and ccing someone for long periods before finishing them. Which cc abilities share diminishing returns?
---
Ok sure, but *barely* it's more your gear etc.
---
Saying you wouldn't play this game because someone else's face has more pixels is literally insane to me.
---
Read the info in the Shaman section of the Vanilla theorycraft discord.
---
Classic is "perhaps" a dead end, but it's kept a steadily growing base on Pservers for 10+ years and will get a HUGE boost come release.
---
You have to imagine there are people like me who don't touch Pservers for the legality reasons and I have to imagine there are 15-20 of me for every Pserver person.
---
I resubbed for the stress test last week. I played classic for 11 hours straight. Then I went a rolled the same thing in retail when it was over.
---
The entire time I thought exactly what you were thinking. Every little stupid change was clear as day. Modern WoW is a gross perversion of the classic game.
---
you farm 5 resets on gnomer in less than 30 mins. that yields 2-3 maces on avg. 
---
3h on gnomer will yield 12-18 maces (slowest possible case, i. e. 30 min per 5 runs). more than enough for the whole raid.
---
farming gold is exactly the same as farming a item. you just kill stuff or run around collecting stuff. 
---
only ppl that make it a big deal out of farming MCP are ppl that have never done it.
---
Die because I'm level 14
---
Yeah thats my plan, only watched a few basic class guides but am hoping to figure everything else while playing..
---
It seems like Alliance is better than Horde at pvp these days.  I think pallies are objectively better at shamans for raiding so the more serious raiding guilds will go ally.  Then of course raid gear is the best pvp gear, so they will get geared faster.
---
The only reason I want TBC is female blood elf Paladin. She was my favorite character.
---
I don't mind it being a toggle, with the vanilla models as default. I would personally stick to the vanilla models, but I couldn't care less what other people decide to use.
---
Whats this? Where is it from?
---
" buy level 60 boost at l u c k y g o l d d s .com , best prices quick delivery" ..Spelled out in dead Gnomes.
---
Rip.
---
He looks happy :)
---
What the fuck is even the point of this bot - farming karma? It's post history is just pages of spam.
---
Saps* your healers ass
---
Chain heal really isn't as broken as you think.  After you get tier 2.5 and 3 pc t2, then its kind of broken.  Even then a good priest can keep up.
---
Even the raid dps warriors will often tank 5 mans. Every group needs a tank and they aren't just the best at it, they are really the only decent one, absent feral and, even less so, prot pally.
---
But you're right though, and I'm not being sarcastic here. If you aren't planning on raiding you really can play whatever you want. Have fun!
---
Man, I still can't believe there's not an FP at Rebel Camp in vanilla. That run is ridiculous.
---
I remember rolling a dwarf paladin, getting to level 5 and rolling a gnome mage instead. I also remember Ironforge being attacked by this giant boss nobody could kill. Skeletons everywhere. I also remember seeing a paladin with the spinny mace (can't remember the name)

#  &lt;Coup&gt; | NA |Alliance | PvE Server | Middlecore Raiding | Fri/Sat Evenings PST (exact days/times TBD) 
---
&lt;Coup&gt; is a guild with almost 15 years of history, originally formed in vanilla on the Shadowsong-US server. Coup was a top raiding guild on the server during vanilla, scoring several server firsts across BWL and AQ40, including server first Nefarian. Since then we’ve stuck together through almost every expansion with a fairly consistent core of 15-20 members, and are looking to ramp our numbers up to have a healthy community in classic, as well as to support the 40 man raid scene.
---
I’m referring to Coup as “Middlecore” because we plan to raid, but won’t likely push hard on bleeding edge progression. We will always welcome a wide variety of players and playstyles. This ranges from people who always want to play at the top of their game, all the way through to those who want to take the scenic route through the game.
---
Due to the nature of 40 man raiding we will need some consistency in the raid roster, but we also place no pressure on our people when real life happens. If you need to take a sabbatical from raiding or the game in general, we may backfill your role, but the guild will still be here and you will still be a member when you get back. We’ve always treated this game as part of our hobby and not a job, and we’ve been able to maintain many of the same friends and guild members for over a decade as a result. We hope that in Classic we can maintain that M.O.
---
What we are looking for:
---
* We want to build a community first, and then our raiding team later. More than anything we want to find like-minded adults who want to enjoy the game with us.
---
* At some point (ideally around or before content Phase 2) we would like to get the point where we are able to consistently clear current content while it is current.
---
What are aren’t looking for:
---
* Toxicity, racism, bigotry, homophobia, or other generally awful behavior. During the Blizzcon opening ceremony Chris Metzen always used to end with a saying; “Be good to each other”… We intend to do just that, and invite people that will conduct themselves in a positive manner.
---
If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to me via DM here on Reddit, or via discord @ Evilmonstar#7541.
---
Thanks for reading, and we can’t wait to see you in Classic!
---
i'm sorry but i think that was out of character /s
---
This is TBC Ret pally talents with crusader strike and divine storm
---
3 Brothers... The sequel.
---
I played druid during early beta then vanilla as my main. Was a complete retard during the grind phase to 60, and leveled up as resto/balance while using cat form, so yeah....
---
But after that I got myself a brain and played it as a healer, and cleaned AQ40 and mid Naxx.
---
What I loved about it was world pvp, you are almost impossible to kill. And usually you can win all your 1v1 even if it took 10 thousand years.
---
Do not underestimate lower ranks of healing touch (and all spells in general - can save you when you are almost out of mana), even though its only good if you have plenty of healing bonus on your gear. Only use root rank 1 for pvp (to save mana). Try to get bonus armor gear for pvp, along with macro to switch to them when in bear form (Warden Staff, UBRS trinket).
---
The worst is when they're far enough to where they should just die by themselves but they run to everyone else
---
I think the tide is turning on pvp racials.  It used to be wotf was so insane, but people are now realizing you don't spend that much time being feared anyways.  Rogues would typically go orc and I'd argue that gnome is a bigger boost for for pvp than undead is.
---
I am absolutely certain that they will not/can not fix all the bugs before launch and maybe not even later (pet ai). They might fix some of them somewhere along the road if we are lucky.
---
If you are war mode grouped with someone who isn't, you have no problems seeing eachother once inside an the instance. Don't see why layering would be any different.
---
An alternative solution might involve meeting stones.
---
I made up a new level 60 talent tree which includes divine storm and an early crusader strike
---
I tell people this all the time,
---
Classic: Is a fantastic MMO**RPG**
---
Retail: Isn't a bad game, but it's a shitty MMO**RPG**, solid Single player Action Adventure though.
---
I mean... There's really not many boats to remember.  You only have 3 ports.
---
Undead can remove poly if they happen to not get the first cast.
---
Is it game breaking? No, but it's better then what escape artist has to offer
---
Same here, and playing with Sharding Jr. doesn't qualify as playing the game.
---
My WoW diet was always just forgetting to eat because I was too busy playing.  If it couldn't be done during a flight path I probably wasn't going to cook/eat it.
---
Once I started working again and didn't play WoW as much, I gained a lot of weight.
---
You don't downvote a comment that you disagree with. Do you not know any reddiquette?

I was in the original beta and can confirm that an old account does not get you a key.

lmao, I forgot about this gem
---
Very true. But they werent this bugged. I still have the same demons on retail on my lock from vanilla that is lvl 120. I confirmed this with my vanilla screenshots. In the beta ive had 5+ different voidwalkers at least.
---
Boss will resist all your shit.  Getting crit and hit for melee and spells isn't doable.  I think a couple items like that exists, but that's it.
---
My, you're a tall one!
---
Wasn't crusader strike base skill ? Or was it a talent, don't remember.
---
Taurens cant ride raptor mounts in Vanilla. It was changed in BC to allow them to.
---
Oh? How so, that's interesting.
---
Like a wotf bug with batching or something?
---
You can stick your reddiquette up your ass. I couldn't care less about your made up rules.
---
I wish I'd expressed my sentiment this way. You've contextualized my confusion in a clearer manner and I'm editing this into the OP.
---
Ok, say you want to group with a friend for a quest then. You get my point I'm sure.

BB to EPL is no joke like a 12 minute FP.  Could probably bang out 2 miles if you had a treadmill next to your desk to hop right on.
---
Lmao classic
---
Two chicks at the same time, man.
---
The aren't even good as nightfall bots. Much better to let offtanks to that for bosses and bring in an actual dps class.
---
Enhancement shamans do not bring anything resto cannot.
---
Murlocs, Ned! In an open field!
---
I did. One is the NG/Moonglow build and the other is Feral charge/Swiftmend (standard healing builds). Where to put the rest of the talents  is kind of irrelevant to my question.
---
And to try other classes. Point was that they found 12500 characters and thought that meant 12000 accounts. But id say its less than 6000 accounts in beta
---
Acting superior to retail players because you apparently play the "better version" makes you look pathetic. Condemning retail players for making condescending/negative posts when you're advocating for doing the exact same thing makes you look hypocritical.
---
We already know the differences between retail and Classic. It doesn't require 200IQ to realize that, or 200 discussion threads/memes about it.
---
&gt; Don't out-level your friends, I guess? maybe have an alt to play when they're off? or work on your professions or something?
---
My suggestion is to make an alt to play with friends.  Every time I've tried to get people back into WoW they wind up rarely playing so you might as well make a char just to play with them and then have your actual main on the side.
---
The world record was done on a realm that was already established. I can see Joana, or other crazy people mange a 6 days /played to lvl 60. But those people won't be even 0.01% of the players base. And they will be Hunters / Warlocks.
---
I see most extreme hardcore guilds to have their entire 40 man raid roster hit lvl 60 in 7-8 days /played, which translates in 10-11 days in real time. Another 10 hrs /played for gearing up. More hours for farming and professions that WILL BE NEEDED for a world first MC.
---
I really can't see ANY guild clearing MC in first 2 weeks. In the 3rd week? IT IS POSSIBLE, but improbable.
---
Does WOTF remove poly?
---
/u/Savers10
---
I would be surprised if they allocated more than 3% of their resources for classic tbh.
---
If you're grouping with a passer-by they're already on your layer.
---
If it's a friend who just logged on, there are other caveats (for example, being on a gryphon).
---
It's just a free quest at 40, no need to do anything other than "hey here's a pony"
---
I think you mean people like skipping the shot parts of wow (travel, questing, leveling) and focusing on the only good parts (pvp, dungeons, raids).
---
Very cool! I never appreciated how few shared flight paths there are. I think this is one of the main reasons switching factions can feel so totally new!
---
Starting a new MMORPG on it's first day and *knowing* it's going to be a good game is very rare. I've played a few MMORPGs during their first days and after a few months, the hype goes away and realise it's just a generic MMORPG, and then it's just not worth putting in time and effort into the game. But I know WoW Classic is going to be great!
---
I'm 100% convinced that "layering" is just sharding with a different word attached. The clip where Cdew gets invited to a group and the game just arbitrarily shifts them to a new layer is REALLY egregious. That one doesn't even make sense. Its 3 players who were already in the same layer. When those players invited Cdew, if the system actually worked how Ion described it, at WORST he gets a lag spike while the game "shifts" him onto the.. layer he's already on, since thats where they were.
---
Instead, it just made an entirely new layer just because a group was formed. This is no bueno and we really need a Blizz statement on what is happening with layering right now.
---
Are you me? Friends / Friends of Friends in Discord are now like "Level 30 already? Psh he's gonna get burned out"...
---
I'm not saying anything but I'm secretly thinking "No you plebes, I'll be the level 60 who helps your gimp ass get your WW Axe and ultimately parley the remaining, committed players from our 'Guild' fantasy into a real, true raiding guild..."
---
Pretty much this, Warrior, Mage and Rogue are the best classes in the game by far. It always bothered me that Warriors got to be the best tank AND were the top dps they were the only class in the game that didn't have to pay the hybrid tax...
---
I was a pretty hardcore Halo 2 player back in the day, competing at MLG tournaments and making montage videos and stuff like that. I made fun of WoW players because it was the "cool" thing to do without ever knowing anything about the game.
---
I went over to a friend's dorm to hang before heading out for the night. His roommate let me in and a moment later he threw his headset against the wall and yelled "fucking GANKERS!"
---
I had no idea what this meant. And then he explained what ganking was. Me, being the terrible person that I was/am, was hooked on the idea. "What's the best class if you wanted to be a ganker?" I asked.
---
A few days later, I'm sitting at my character creation screen for an undead rogue with a mohawk and s&amp;m face straps trying to come up with a name. Its 2AM and that Chuck Norris commercial for the Total Body Gym comes on my 13" TV/VCR combo. It was destiny. Totalbodygym was born. Little did I know that this was also the height of the Barrens' obsession with Chuck Norris.
---
I was home.
---
Bringing back and reusing old WOW related content , the true spirit of r/classicwow
---
If you think people won't be level 60 in 4 days and the market fully manipulated within a week you have the wrong expectations.
---
Hate bursting that bubble, but if you can get past that you'll enjoy classic.
---
Getting "time lapse" every week on Chromaggus during progression
---
Oh please, woe is them for working hard towards the end of a big deliverable.  This whole "Working their devs to death"-theme can cry me a river.  I was an analyst/associate in IBD and when I decided I didn't like it anymore, I quit.  Nobody holding a gun to their heads to stay there.  And there is nothing wrong with crunch time.

People that don't understand mechanics on chromag and don't bring resto pots.
---
Scepter is worth about 40,000 gold in just time alone. This server was getting off easy.
---
Not counting all the running around (which easily adds several hours for a full raid team) and all the expensive items you have to collect, obtaining the scepter requires roughly:
---
1. 40 people killing the 3rd boss of BWL, we'll call it 1 hour.
---
2. 5 people farming rep for ~3 days /played.
---
3. Completing Sunken Temple, we'll call it 1 hour.
---
4. Farming Dragonkin for several hours, we'll call it 6 for both fragments.
---
5. Farming elite Dragonkin for several hours, we'll call it 2 hours.
---
6. Killing a 40-man raid satyr, we'll call it 1 hour.
---
7. Beating a 40-man raid encounter, we'll call it 1 hour.
---
8. Clearing BWL in less than ~5 hours. We'll call it 3 hours.
---
9. Killing Azuregos (if not already dead), we won't count this.
---
10. Farming Molten Core until the goggles drop. We'll call this 1 hour for 20 people.
---
11. Killing a 10-man chimera and some group farming. We'll call this 1 hour.
---
12. Kill a 5-man ape, we'll call this 1 hour.
---
13. Kill a 15-man Dr. Weavil, another 1 hour.
---
14. 5-man elite farming at a 4% drop rate, we'll call this 2 hours.
---
15. 2-man farming at a 6% drop rate, we'll call this another 2 hours.
---
16. Defeating Onyxia. We'll call this 1 hour.
---
17. Defeating Firemaw in BWL and some trash, the raid might already be cleared, so we won't count this.
---
17. Defeating Ragnaros. We'll call this 1 hour.
---
18. Defeating a 20-man raid shark. We'll call this 1 hour.
---
That's roughly 785 man hours. At 50g per hour, the scepter should be worth about 39,250 gold.
---
With all the materials needed, we can easily call it 40,000 gold.
---
This server was getting off easy.
---
Yes, they did.
---
When you activate stoneform it will remove all poisons, bleeds, diseases and all their effects and make you immune to any further effects from being applied for the 8 seconds it lasts. In Vanilla this includes Blind.
---
Go resto, stick with a good guild and they will eventually be able to hand you some good enh gear out of the raids. Then you can go have enh fun in pvp and dungeons.
---
Made up rules? Yes, made up by the creators of reddit.
---
https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette
---
Probably
---
If this client doesn't have the improvements for multithreaded CPUs, probably not, outside of questing.
---
The cake is a lie.
---
I just want to make sure I am not on a server with any big streamers and that I pick the same as the rest of my friends that plan on playing. Too much time investment these days to just pick blind for me.

that cracked me up "we dont want be remembered as the guild who... yadda yadda" like ANYONE will ever remember the famous WoW guild that accomplished x task within the game rofl

Oh, innocent one... if only you knew.

Blizzard has a history of not releasing anything a couple weeks before the winter holidays or anything during. Even the Christmas event starts when December does.
---
"I want to go Enhance at 60!"
---
.... you think you do but you dont
---
They need this reserve name option to evaluate the amount of people at launch. Today, Blizzard believes that Classic will be a flop. A BIG flop, actually. They expect less than 500k returning players.
---
The name reserve will be a huge wake up call for Blizzard.
---
Every week, without fail. Then the RL would be like a grumpy dad "I'll turn this raid around and we can go home!"
---
Yes, I don't recall anything from above about the flag carrier being "seen". I do remember that after , like, 10 mins of both flags being pulled, they would show up on the map.
---
As an alternative, when Zul’Gurub releases, try to go for the class trinket from the Edge of Madness.
---
My mom is coming to visit me from half way across the country the day after it launches. Maybe I should just sit in my basement and ignore her just like old times.
---
**&lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt;  NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding**
---
Raid times:  **Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 6:30 PDT**   (To be clear – this means ONE night per week) 
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt; is the raid schedule.  The initial group is comprised of people that played classic together many moons ago, most of whom are too old to play like we used to, but are also powerless against pull of nostalgia.  As such, in order to keep our wives happy we'll be raiding one night per week.  To begin with we will alternate between Tuesday to Monday nights.  This way we can run the same raid timer twice without playing twice per week.    
---
Because of the limited frequency of our raids I expect us to run MC/Ony exclusively for longer than your average multi-night raiding guild.  A subset of the guild is welcome to start attempting new content as it releases, but my primary concern is getting MC on farm.  Once we come to a consensus that MC has little left to offer, we will shift to BWL, and so on.  Members will obviously be free to pursue other raid timers during the weeks where we return to a raid on Monday before the reset.  Once Molten Core is on farm (which I don't expect to take terribly long) we will raid every Tuesday instead, using each reset. 
---
DKP for the loot system.  Pretty basic, blind bid, 10% decay every week, the specifics aren't nailed down yet but DKP isn't particularly complicated. 
---
The tentative date of our first Onyxia, and hopefully subsequent Molten Core attempt, is mid October.  I realize that giving only six weeks or so to level is counter to the whole casual appeal of this guild, if a member needs more time than that it's not a problem.  Many of us, myself included, are going to attack leveling with an unhealthy zeal that will only be able to last so long before divorce becomes imminent.  Our first run may include a few level 58 healers, it may include a few PUGs, these things should not be a source of stress.  We are not going for any records, the most important thing to start with is to get in there and start teaching the fights.   
---
One note on the casual nature of this guild: it doesn't mean I'm looking for lazy raiders.  We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class / at least make an effort on consumables.  Molten Core is not particularly difficult, but I would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible.  In order to do this we will need to remain focused during the raids.  That said, we're pretty easy going. 
---
On that same note, I would like to run this with as close to 40 active raiders as possible.  Seeing as we'll only be raiding once per week – my hope is that the majority of members will be at every raid.  Life is never so straight forward, so I will be recruiting some alternates, but for the most part I'd like to keep the roster tight. 
---
We're all very excited, this should be a lot of fun.  Here's hoping some of you join us in the Molten Core and beyond. 
---
PM me if you're interested.    I will start an email list and keep everyone updated.  Because our schedule is so simple, I see no need to make a website, if our members want one I will make one.

Right now we can take any class, if you're unsure of your class at least give me what you're considering.  Druid is the only class I'm almost full on, I can probably only take one more.  If you need help deciding, I am a fountain of classic knowledge.  Most notably I still need a main tank – who will be the one raider who gets loot preference.  As such this position is going to require a little more vetting, if you're interested in being main tank make sure to note it in your PM. 
---
Thanks for reading!  See you in Azeroth.
---
I mean, Joana was a hunter, so he tamed his armor and bought his bullets.
---
When 5000 gold was a *lot* of gold.
---
Just like sharding was only supposed to be temporary, right babe?
---
The scepter is useless if the entire server isn't turning in millions of trade goods for the war effort.
---
Yes indeed. It is on the list :)
---
C'mon now. There's a big difference between using a blessing that your class picks up via a talent and forcing 40 raiders to stack world buffs to come to raid (or get kicked from the group). OP could have definitely worded their post better, but surely the communication came across to you. No need for the sarcasm.
---
Unfortunately not, they have the download available for everyone right now. That’s how they did the open beta last week
---
[This will help !](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tcs6FkhqxI54jR4miD0eytsjZJ1YWYO6PzEjKMdnTJk/edit#slide=id.g4530334760_0_64)
---
Nothing. MC will be cleared after the first reset.
---
Yeah if MC is open on Launch it will definitely take 3-4 weeks before it gets cleared. Everyone on a roster getting to 60 + getting pre raid bis will take a bit of time even if everyone hits 60 in 7 days played
---
What makes you think it will only last a few days? I'm expecting at least a year of layering.

This person has kids

Okay so the first comment got deleted.  [Here's the album of the rest of the pictures](https://imgur.com/a/3A5ermu).  Here's where I found [the original picture](https://forum.twinstar.cz/threads/azeroth-pre-tbc-hd-megamap-with-levels-and-subzones-very-detailed.102438/).  Feel free to use any of these, just remember to cite your source :D
---
I found a nice picture a while ago, but it turned out it was kinda outdated, so I decided to make my own.  This one, unfortunately, still has the potential to be inaccurate on release of Classic, because I'm not exactly sure if places like Thorium Point will be in the game at launch.  From what I heard, neither do the devs, they want to gauge the community on an issue like that.
---
I originally made these images for a video series I do called Beginner's Guide to Classic.  I felt like the pictures would be more useful to the majority of us here, considering the video is more tuned towards newer players, returners, retail "tourists," etc.  I talk about mounts, FPs, boats, and even go into the Night Elf Wetlands run.  If you're interested, [here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrtsGnDj4Hk)
---
I very much doubt that every server will be full of hardcore guilds, all the more if they launch more servers at some point after initial launch. Back in actual vanilla those servers lagged behind often times, sometimes to the point that there was only 1 guild that could even complete the scepter quest.
---
I accepted the deletion. That happened an hour after I'd had a long post I typed out blocked by "this thread is locked". Then the deletion. Then the locked thread thing while I tried to reply happened again. That was when I made this thread. I do not reply to troll posts or posts I think warrant deletion. I mostly reply to substantive topics. To have two  of those deleted while I was typing in the same day was (it actually happened a third time) made me hope that we could, as a community, get some clarity on what threads that break no rules will or will not be deleted or perhaps, even, get the mods to stop deleting threads that do not break rules.
---
&gt; **no guild raids on city’s** 
---
Never underestimate how early people will start running to enemy zones in raids. First raid I encountered on a fresh server back in 2005 was pre-level 10 :P (I think they highest level they had was around 20).
---
You were contributing nothing to the discussion. Clinging to the "rules" (because they're not actual rules, they're suggestions at best) just makes you look desperate.
---
You could sneak in a backstab first but it's usually a waste of cp because there is a good chance that cheap + ambush would be 5 cp.
---
Abilities only share Dr with themselves. So you can full cheap and full kidney.
---
Imo int+mp5+stam is better than spirit. int is very important to have the big mana pool to use and it also increases the crit chance on heals, Spirit is pretty useless for shammy. 
---
Just have a high int set with some mp5 jewelery while lvling for off-spec healing dungeons e z. Spirit won't stop a shammy going oom.
---
I might actually wait a week or two. Not because layering or anything like that. I just feel like the first zones will be flooded with low levels. I think I want to let people spread out over levels and zones first.
---
Thanks, very helpful.
---
I'm taking a "Half Blood Prince" approach to Joana's 1-60 Guide (best shit ever by the way), like that guy did to his potions book in Harry Potter. It's like a dry run to 60 for me.
---
Legit scrawling notes over his guide with things like "60 Peacebloom, 60 Earthroot before Orgrimmar at 12" and cancelling certain sections to instead farm WC or align reqs for SM quests. It's like a min / max guide tailored back to level professions / cooking / fishing in line with leveling. 
---
In my experience getting in front of the "Zerg Level" is important, but getting in front and prepared to dominate the AH (at least to me) is just as critical.
---
Aw man, I went from 100% excited to 0% real quick.
---
It shouldn't but he said undead removing sheep so I was asking him what bug he's using.
---
What I said holds true, and nice catch phrase there Mr Back.
---
Pretty sure warrior, locks, and mages still shine in PvP. I don't disagree with you but druids only really shine at FCing.
---
Im arguing that its not a cheat or exploit...
---
It's because the system is dynamic and player numbers are constantly changing. They need to constantly adjust layer numbers.
---
Haha sorry to be a buzz kill
---
And that war effort is useless unless a guild puts in ~800 man hours to get the scepter.
---
Yea all I can think about those chairs how sweaty their asses and thighs are going to get.
---
I don't know exactly if it was possible, but if other guilds still had the possibility to do the quest then I think it's ok.
---
But if they didn't it's just an asshole thing to do imho.
---
That would make population control on each layer almost impossible.
---
A noble dream. I also would love something, which would make shadow priest more desirable in classic raids, but I think no changes are better in these regards.
---
Btw: I heard years ago Blizz balanced the classes in vanilla around how much utility vs power they brought? So how much utility a class brought to the table the less good are they in fealing damage, which is why shadow priest or ret palas weren't a common sight in raids. Did I hear this wrong or could it be true?
---
[right here!](https://forum.twinstar.cz/threads/azeroth-pre-tbc-hd-megamap-with-levels-and-subzones-very-detailed.102438/).  Meant to include this in a comment with the post but it got deleted.
---
If you can, change to paladin!  Otherwise, tauren all the way! Moo!
---
Remember to keep your innervate on cooldown all the time.  Keep extra stacks of consumables for buffs and revives.
---
When’s launch again, and how many realms are going to be available? (I haven’t played in a long time since most expansions ruined it for me, haven’t looked into this I’m out of the loop).
---
Comments like this make you realize how many people on this sub were actually 3-9 years old back in 2005.
---
2005 had Halo 2 multiplayer, CoD2, BF2, Battlefront 2, God of War, Guitar Hero, Civ4, GTA: SA, KoToR2, Guild Wars, Quake 4, and more I’m forgetting.
---
How about adding travel time to the routes? Might be useful to set a timer for making food or taking a sh*t. 
---
Would be greatly appreciated.
---
Can you explain how troll is less bursty than UD?
---
I hope you're right because otherwise this setup is awful.
---
For real my pc cant run it? Why?
---
if the pet is staying within like 10 yds of the rogue im not sure that is actually broken.
---
i honestly dont know if target visibility for the pet is based purely on the player or it's own radius (wrong word?)
---
My back hurts just thinking about that.
---
It’s been a long time since I’ve raided but I remember certain color combinations for the drakes in the first part of the Nefarian fight meant the different between wiping a few times or clearing it in one go
---
Wow, someone else who hates the new models as much as I do. It seems rare to find others who hate the new models. The new cast animations, run animations, and weird wallace &amp; gromet look to characters now I think is absolutely horrible

**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday

Prot/Holy Pally's are unstoppable in a world without Resilience. PvP is all about survivability
---
All the main spots will have people on them. You also didn't answer the question but just avoided the point entirely.
---
&gt;Typically people who like pvp play horde
---
I remember the Horde being about 80% angry 13 year olds playing undead rogues back in vanilla so this indeed checks out.
---
( at least all the ones I met as an alliance player on a PvP server were , I may be wrong though)
---
I don't understand why there hasn't been an unoffical declaration for a RP-PvP server. This has happened with other MMOs, I don't see why we can't just decide on a realm being the unoffical RP-PvP for EU and NA?
---
Makes me want to cry.
---
This isn't classic.
---
&gt; shitting on retail is perfectly legitimate as long as it occurs in the context of discussing Classic WoW
---
There si a difference between "shitting on" and "discussing"
---
If the only thing you can say about, for example, leveling on retail is "its sucks because its easy" then its adding nothing to the discussion, this is shitting on retail and shouldn't be allowed.
---
Now, if for some reason (everything hypothetically), we are talking about changes in the classic wow leveling, you could add that adding the retail leveling design would be a downgrade because X, then explain X, and Y, and then explain Y. This is fine, you are describing how something works in another patch in the same game and why you don't think its good, therefore it shouldn't be added.
---
Manually click polymorph then backpeddle circles around the sheep
---
It says a lot about your argument when you start by saying every multiplayer content is mindless and end up changing your argument to "retail is bad".
---
You made a claim regarding the difficulty of multiplayer content in retail, I'm presenting to you why that claim is objectively false, that's it.
---
The fact that you assume I didn't play Vanilla or that I enjoy retail just because I'm explaining why endgame raiding is more engaging in retail is hilarious, grow up a little mate. I'm able to dislike retail as a whole and enjoy Classic while not having the delusion to think literally everything was better back then, shocking I know.
---
1. I was under the impression everyone had a base 5% resist for Stun. Not 10%.
---
2. Yep
---
3. Yep
---
Answer 1. Nope
---
Answer 2. 30% that I know of unless you have something that adds more besides just being an Orc. An Orc Warrior can get 45% that I'm aware of, but it requires 10 points into Protection
---
RIP wow or RIP honeymoon?
---
No because then you'd be too close to the monitor. Monitors that huge you want to sit back a bit at least where the chairs are now. Sitting right where they keyboard is makes it not only hard to see everything, but murder for your eyes.
---
Guys who wanted to get fit just to bang chicks would be inspired by him, for sure. He was a total asshat, which was alluring for dudes who just wanted to get laid. There was nothing wholesome about him, just "Get aesthetic as fuck and then fuck some sloots. We are all gonna make it, brah."
---
Could you add boat travel points to it ?
---
The problem is that layering is not actually working as it was described by Blizzard, and this video demonstrates that.
---
Further, currently the beta has less than 1,000 concurrent players at all times, but nonetheless, the server is still getting layered hard. 
---
This video provides evidence of people getting layer shifted while in combat. It shows people getting layer shifted when they form a group, EVEN IF they were both on the SAME LAYER TO BEGIN WITH!
---
We haven't gotten any kind of statement or clarification from Blizz on any of these issues. If layering is a system that is supposed to ONLY kick in when the ENTIRE WORLD has more than 3,000 players, why the fuck is it happening on a server with less than 1,000 players? If the only way to shift layers is supposed to be to re-log or to be invited to a different layer, why is there a clip of Cdew getting invited to a group by two people he can see, but all three of them getting shifted off the layer they were already on?
---
I agree with you; it's not a cheat and it's not an exploit: it's part of the game. That said, the mentality is tiresome and unfun and I can't blame players for not wanting to meet those requirements to step into a raid. This is clearly the basis of the OP's post: they want a raid group that isn't requiring it to raid.
---
Semantics aren't worth arguing about when you know what they were trying to communicate. If you really wanted to say that, though, why didn't you say, "It's technically not an exploit/cheat if it's part of the game." No need for runaround sarcasm to get that point across.
---
Out of curiosity, what's your nationality?
---
I'd be surprised if the removed it within the first six months.
---
The post doesen’t reference WoW’s peak. It says ”What’s the most popular game this year?” which could be WoW even though it didn’t peak then.
---
I used to have with a friend on a RP-Server a Guild called (TBC): Pigmy Power. 
---
We were only dwarfs and gnomes. It was freaking funny doing T-4 Content. Remember my Gnome-Warrior. The Shilds and Hemelts were bigger then my chara.
---
I'm pouring one out for my fellow millennials. I'm quite close to not having to ask dad for money anymore. It's taken a lot of sacrifice, skill, educating myself, and a metric butt ton of luck. I hope my fellows will find even better times ahead.
---
As if you ever walk into an instance portal on retail rather than being LFG menu magicked in.
---
You're right, this is not offensive, and you'd have to be stupid to be offended by someone linking an item like this. But remember, this name still can't be said out loud without being a little too close to offensive. Again, its not a big deal, but it would mean in YouTube videos and Twitch streams they'd have to call it something else anyways or risk demonitization or whatever the heck twitch does. And when you realize that, you have to ask. Whats the point of leaving it with it's old name?
---
It's not the fact its offensive, its the fact it risks being CLOSE to offensive, almost exclusively when being read out loud
---
If I wasn't contributing to the discussion what do you think you're doing now?
---
How many people do you think are in beta? It’s like 20K tops, and that’s from people who are harvesting that data while on. As low as BFA’s sub numbers are they dwarf the number of people in Beta by orders of magnitudes.
---
But what if we're just two friends questing in Westfall and want to group up for a quest? Having to fly to SW to be able to quest together is ridiculous, and it's just creating more problems than it's solving.
---
Wtf hoe do I get on there. Please
---
Why so upset? Did someone criticize your taste in video games?
---
No. If I can log out and login select another layer that has a completely different resource timer and then I’ll just “layer hop” repetitively to gather resources. Pretty plain sight that I answered your question.  Because it’s the same as getting invite except now I do it easier and just log out and in requiring no friends.
---
One layer nothing else. You can adjust for population numbers as time goes on.
---
Looks like im out of cake. Better luck next year.
---
I played since beta. In classic I only leveled but did not participate in any raids. With BC I entered my first guild and including WotLK, this was probably one of my top 3 favourite gaming times.  I still raided more or less regularly in Cata but this is also when I stopped playing. I leveled MoP a bit after the content was cleared already and got bored immediately. Tried again in Legion and was overwhelmed by all the new things but the content was cleared as well so got bored again. Now I leveled to 120 and just doing random stuff like farming mounts and some raids. As another thread already said, I hope classic gets back the community feeling, careful dungeon/raid running and just different shenanigans. In BfA I feel like I'm only grinding different stuff without any communication at all because it is not necessary. I got the Lucid Nightmare because I thought it is cool to get back some story and exploration as in the old days ;)
---
I’d like it if every zone that can spawn black lotus are single layer zones.
---
I mean a lot of the older generations think it's stupid and that's fine. My misus would play an FPS with me but she wouldn't touch an mmo cos they look gay... Which is fine by me. Both of us having an unhealthy obsessive hobby would be devastating lol.
---
Depends what you call high FPS and high settings.
---
At 1440p on the highest settings, my i7-9770k and 2080ti still sees FPS drops of 50% or more in certain scenarios.
---
Never seen the new models in action, but from this video you linked they all look to be desperately out of of breath which is pretty obnoxious but they're otherwise pretty great looking.  I wouldn't mind if they switched to these or put in a toggle, but I also still enjoy the original, so don't really care either way.
---
Unfortunately this video demonstrates that layering is simply not functioning as Ion described it, at all. Right now it is functionally identical to sharding. It is arbitarily shifting players around, it is creating new shards when people form groups (even if they were originally on the same shard) and it is currently still actively layering people on the beta, even with less than 1,000 players online, which is pretty much concrete evidence that it is NOT operating with any type of population parameters right now.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I played an Undead Lock in Vanilla/TBC, and my main job in PvP was killing Holy Paladins. I remember Curse of Tongues being the key to victory.
---
As a dwarf paladin I’m taking the 60% Mount at 40 and then grind Gnomeregan rep at 60 for the 100% Mechanostrider Mount.
---
If you want to PvP seriously you will want a regular mount anyway.
---
I’m of course going for my pally mount at phase 2 as soon as possible.
---
Crimson (Horde-PvE) is recruiting.
---
Introduction We are a group who have been playing and raiding together for several years now, and are looking to step into Classic and progress at a quick pace. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding but go hardcore preparing for and during raids to make quick progress.
---
Goals To be the best guild on our realm, and one of the best in classic, while we maintain a good quality community of friends.
---
What we are looking for Solid players who want to push the limits of Classic and their class, while also being reliable and able to make our raid schedule.
---
Looting For our 40man raids, Loot council is current plan, though DKP is still on the table. In 20mans, when available, we will generally roll for items except a few exceptional items.
---
Schedule Our tentative raid times are Monday: 19:00-23:00 CET Wednesday: 19:00-23:00 CET Thursday: 19:00-23:00 CET Sunday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
We shall use extra raid days to do guild dungeons, 20man raids, and farming when 40man raids are cleared for the week.
---
We require 90% Raid attendance.
---

# &lt;Hope Rises&gt; - casual-friendly/“mediumcore” - 1 raid/week
---
Greetings, travelers!
---
Do you love Classic WoW as much as the “hardcore” and “semi-hardcore” crowd, but want or need to enjoy the game with more freedom to play how and when you like? If so, then we may be a great fit for you!
---
&lt; Hope Rises &gt; is a guild I founded back in 2014 on the principles of positivity, loyalty, and freedom. Though our Mythic team eventually transferred for greener servers in Legion, the guild will be getting a rez for Classic and we plan to keep those same guiding principles intact! As such, we already have a stable core of players confirmed to return who are highly loyal and dedicated to the guild’s long-term success. In conjunction with our founding principles, these are our guild’s disctinctives:
---
* Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, we will “officially” raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points)! **Raid time: 8 or 9pm Central start time (we’ll take a guild vote to choose when the time comes), raids will last 3-4 hours as needed**
---
* We will also have optional raids on Saturdays at roughly the same times as the official Tuesday raids (again, we will choose as a guild)
---
* It is a priority for us that we all have the freedom to show up to raids (particularly early on) with a suboptimal or PvP spec so long as everyone is also willing to change to a more meta role if the raid becomes stonewalled or profoundly inefficient because of it (this will likely only be necessary way down the line — like AQ-40 to Naxx).
---
* We will select a well-populated PvP server that does not have any major streamers on it.
---
* Many (but not all!) of us want to savor Classic at a calm but steady pace (though pure speculation, I envision most of us being raid-ready approximately 3-4 months after launch, which averages out to about 2-2.5 hours /played per day). A few of us will still no-life it. :)
---
* We will also have numerous casual members whose primary interests will be leveling alts, playing the AH, farming gold, etc., so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.
---
Many of us have raided for years at a competitive Mythic level in retail WoW. Though we are a competent group looking forward to crushing PvP and raiding through Naxx, enjoyment of each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame is our top priority. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here or DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355).
---
Thanks, everybody! Hope to see y’all in Azeroth! 
---

Someone replaced the character model client-side or what?
---
It will run it
---
&gt; I can't hardly function if I have to alt tab every 2 minutes to check discord, reddit, Spotify or youtube, wowhead, twitch, and all the other gaming web sites.
---
Sounds like serious ADHD dude. You should try to relax and focus on one thing at a time. It'll reduce your stress levels for sure. If you're gaming, you don't need to pay attention to anything else. All of it can wait. Nobody is going to die if you ignore all those websites for a bit while you game. Those are downtime activities when you're bored, not all the time activities. And why do you need the tv to be on? Again, you're gaming, not watching tv.
---
We've found Mankrik, now where's his wife?
---
Meridian 59 and EverQuest are generally regarded as the birth of 3D MMORPGs. There were some 2D MMOs and text-based MUDs that were their influencers though.
---
What if the Ooga Gang summons Angwe?
---
Phyto's are had as af to get man.  You don't forget running mara like that.  Shame he didn't have fungus shround on also, but hard to tell on UD.
---
I might be wrong as it have been a long time since I played vanilla wow, but isn't there a Horde-Druid-only flight path, from Nighthaven to Thunder Bluff?
---
looks like you have drawn the path for the Might Elf Druid one.
---
My point was its very easy to get as a raider. If you look at his history he also talks about how you shouldn't use consumes for pvp.
---
Lets not pretend that the hardest part of vanilla is the prep and organization. If you can make a raid night go smooth because you timed a world buff turn in then why not?
---
Its a casual and hardcore mechanic. casuals can enjoy the raid, and hardcore players can stack as many world buffs and logging off as they want to speed run or world first content.
---
Pvp as enh and do what I'm doing enh brothers.  Wait for TBC. Our glorious day will come.
---
You mean like almost every piece of Shaman pvp gear? Just an example.
---
Also, today I learned 5% is "all your shit"
---
Also, way to be bitter? I guess because I actually had data to back it up, you need to continue the shit train on Enh in any way possible? The dps will be enough to complete most of the requirements for raids with adequate gear. Its not a dumpsterfire like all the pserver people think. Thats all I said so no need to find other things to throw out to "win" an argument.
---
When name reservation is open to anyone, you'd never know who only reserves a name "in case I ever want to play" but if you put it behind a paywall there will be lots of people like me, who just won't bother until release.
---
Don't think it's a good tool for accurate predictions but I guess it might give them a vague idea. Interesting point
---
You can't reliably run Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood, Wetlands without a fair amount of mob grinding, and by quest difficulty alone, you'll need a buddy (or a ton of patience).  There simply is not enough quest experience from Westfall quests to rely solely on that zone, even including the quests that require you to kill L18+ mobs to complete (that are famous for hitting very hard).  It is possible to ping pong a bit from Westfall to Redridge, back to Westfall, back to Redridge, and then to the early parts of Duskwood, but again, you'll really need to weave in some mob or dungeon grinding to be able to reliably stay in single zones, otherwise you'll do Westfall 1, Redridge 1, Westfall 2 and find yourself stuck around L17/18 with only the Redridge quests in the mid-to-high 20s.  And if you're following the optimal route, you're ping ponging between the zones and it's hardly different than the horde grind.  
---
Having tested leveling on beta over six characters now, I actually found the horde grind to be more streamlined than the Alliance one.  Particularly when you look at recommended questing paths, the horde get to stay in adjacent zones (Barrens, Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Thousand Needles) while the optimal Alliance route sends everyone through Darkshore/Ashenvale, Loch Modan/Wetlands, and Redridge/Duskwood (and potentially even Stonetalon) all before hitting L30.  That's quite obviously horribly inefficient, yet the sequence is almost universally recommended by leveling "experts."
---
Queues are a better alternative than layering. The entire layering crowd is just thinly veiled #changes.
---
hit the nail right on the head.
---
Your still not answering the question why restrict logging into a layer or making a character on it if its +/- 50 other another ?
---
Getting people to show up on progression nights.  Funny how many more were available for the farm content.
---
Exactly!
---
Not sure if you know me, but people legitimately referred to me as the reddit police. I even have a PoE character named that.
---
When I talked about posts, I mean actual text posts or link posts and not comments. I would not say that those low effort memes on the top of our front page are “full of downvotes”.
---
And for posterity, I know Soupa and he knows me. He asked some questions and I gave feedback.
---
How does that work? Do we create the characters early but can't play until later, or will there be a web form?
---
Also, Unionize! Our grandparents did, and could afford to have 1 working adult per middle class house, and still buy a boat. 
---
As far as sacrifice, I feel you there man, I could use some of that luck tho..
---
Exactly. I've stopped bothering with threads like these because everyone's so hyped up on DP. You barely use it because you try to save it for classes that won't dispell it, so you basically use it every 10 minutes. SG scales better, and is up all the time. Wotfk is okay, but there are barely any Alliance Locks.
---
 The argument for troll in pve is stupid as fuck too. Faster cast speed? For what? If we're talking shadow, nice - that helps mind blast. Which has a CD. Not even close to being any type of relevant.
---
no offense, but you're talking to the wrong guy if you think you can pull the theory of deferred or instant gratification out of your ass and try to apply it to this argument. and no, before you start, we're not even in the realm of deferred gratification here, because you're ignoring very important presuppositions that has to exist. 
---
I really don't care enough about this, I spent 3 years in uni and that's enough. if you want to think that layering in world of warcraft classic somehow has anything to do with instant gratification, then be my guest. 
---
it's really not more complicated than "how much do I weigh the ability to play at launch uninterrupted versus having to deal with layering for the first 4 weeks, hmmmmm."
---
That's kind of the point of capture the flag. It makes grabbing the flag more dangerous, forcing teams to work together.
---
Being layered in and out constantly and seeing players disappear around you ruins the immersiveness. The biggest appeal of classic to me was existing in one cohesive world.
---
I want this to be a different timeline, similar to WoD but with a good game instead.
---
Yes, it's because i posted a video a very long time ago about helping on MMO champ + current wow sub reddit. Which got downvoted abit. Ever since then that karma has struck with me, it's not going to change i am afraid unless i get help with it ;(
---
You as the player have to catch the target in stealth first, then can send a pet, pet will chase that stealther down to the ends of the earth from that point on. Really amusing to see it sniff out an invisible rogue
---
Holy crap! I now know what I'm building on my lunch breaks at the wood shop.
---
Or we could just let people say what they want (aside from actual threats/etc.) and let the votes decide, and avoid making unnecessary rules to protect feelings.
---
&gt; Save 5 earth root when leveling early on to put towards your cure poison quest.
---
Skip your cure poison quest, you learn abolish poison like 2 levels later anyways, and you don't need to have Cure trained.
---
When someone says aesthetics I think of arnie or Frank Zane not some coke head
---
I'm not much of a computer guy, but it seems that your CPU is outdated by like 10 years and your GPU is outdated by 5 years. I imagine the GPU wont be your bottleneck, but the CPU maybe if you are trying to get above 30 fps... which is amazing compared to the standards back then!
---
Did you played classic ? 
---
A night is not enough my dude
---
I don’t understand what your asking - please don’t explain.
---
Shame hunter is totally destroyed for classic unless they fix a magnitude of bugs
---
First option i do believe i read
---
Wow close to the most popular game until its peak, genius.
---
oh snap
---
Are you saying he isn't a dick or he's a dick who plays alliance
---
Yea off the top of my head Blizz in their infinite wisdom, invited a few Retail streamers that are hardcore into M+ and Mythic raiding because of course they'll want to abandon gameplay they excel at, enjoy, and make money off of. So a few Method Mythic raid team streamers like Josh, AutomaticJak got invited and played like 1 day. I know I've seen other people but I can't remember off the top of my head.
---
My own advice is to focus a lot more on quality and focus for your submissions. Submitting a dozen videos of you just playing isn't the level of high quality content I think you want to strive for.
---
How many Druids do you take? How many Warriors?
---
If it’s anything like the diablo3 launch you will probably be waiting for stable servers more than being able to play. At least the first few days. The launches I have witnessed of blizzard so far have all been pretty terrible :-(

Crusader-Strike existed in Alpha/Beta Talent-Tree but was trash because of shit-Scaling. Anyway Divining-Storm would be Way to OP!!! a class who just faceroll AoE-Damage and Single-Target-Damage as a hybrid-Class is jsut the Current-WoW state we have with Retail-WoW

haha sure, if u play un the German server wich will be set from the comm :P
---
Yes I did. I was also in the beta.
---
What makes you think there still won't be a shitload of new characters being made after a month? A month isn't a long time.
---
ohh your not the guy that origianlly started the discussion. They mentioned something about +/- 50 of each layer/sub server wouldn't let you log into it.
---
smells like BS?
---
If they are a guild speed clearing BWL ( which you had to do to get the scepter... well, 5 hours isn't really a speedclear by modern standard ) then delaying AQ40 just annoy them.
---
and that's assuming there's no other guild clearing BWL on the server have / are about to complete a scepter.
---
and how exactly is the server being held hostage when only a ridiculously small % of the population could do AQ40/20?
---
And why go to such length for 5000 gold? As opposed to selling some BWL loot?
---
Thanks for the reply m8. Im really considering buying a new machine used. I just need to be able to run Classic at 60 fps constant.

These guys were EVE Online players

Hey. If you are still searching, let's talk about your plans for classic. You can reach me at either wildgunmen#1302 on bnet or wildgunmen#9537 on discord.
---
nice nice thanks
---
Okay, but that's not the way it worked in Vanilla.
---
Same here, it's an internal struggle i'm having with leveling TOO much and possibly burning out or something. Currently my plan is to just take a bunch of different classes to level 20
---
Cocaine for weight loss, beer for weight gain.

I'm ready.

More explanation what do you mean? I’m lost in the sauce.

Why would you ever use new Reddit? It looks too awful for words.
---
Create two innervate macros:
---
First one /yells that you are casting on #target.
---
Second one silently casts innervate on yourself.
---
Yeah I did the NE one, there should be one to Thunderbluff... damn... well people are asking for a bunch of possible stuff to be added to the map so... I guess I'm gonna be updating the map :)

Come wotlk my dear, I will make vault of archavon 25 man raids first every week and auction your fucking loot and take the mount for myself. If you want the REAL wotlk experience
---
A Pokemon game, a madden game, god of war 1, battlefield 2 and call of duty 2 came out in 2005.

Sry i didn't make myself clear there ... a little bit of context:

it is a bug that happend after a Warsong Game. I left Warsong while dead and now i'm kind of a "living Wisp". I can use all of my abilites and even log off and still stay a Wisp :)
---
I wish I had advice.
---
Make a LinkedIn profile, keep it stocked, learn python even if you're not an engineer, entertain even the most silly recruiemt emails. Take a nature wall at least once a week, even if the closest nature is the slightly larger park down the street with denser trees.
---
Don't be afraid to apply for a weight class you don't think you can compete in...we have a very low unemployment rate.
---
3.5k layer would be the majority of the server. Also, I cannot believe you think MoP and classic can be comparable. Excuse me but I have played vanilla wow since release and plenty of times. Every class is perfect. The game is designed around being a TEAM. You have to work together and synergize with other classes to find success. You will be countered by classes, and you will counter classes. That’s what makes it rewarding. I cannot reason classic wow with someone who tries comparing it to MoP. You are honestly not a real classic fan. I don’t think you even played vanilla wow when it came out years ago. You probably started in wrath when classes can just kill things at will and was stupid.
---
Ask a hordie and they'll cry about AV. Horde hage racial advantages for sure. Paladins when used by  a high skill pre made beat shamans.
---
It’s all relative though. The most popular game 2005 could have had 1 million players. The most popular game in 2010 could have had 50 million players even though wow only had 10. This is making WoW a more popular game in relation to other games in 2005, even though it had more players in 2010. Look at the post again

Good catch. I didn’t know all this.

---
r/thathappened
---
Thanks Kappa...
---
If that was your point, you did a pretty bad job of getting it across before now. Why beat around the bush? It's like the antithesis of communication.
---
I don't look at people's history; I'm not that bored. I also don't care if it's "easy" to do or not. Many people have real lives outside of the game and can't dedicate to twisting their real lives around being logged in for a world buff. Now, if the raid says "hey be in ten minutes before raid to get the world buff turn-in" that'd be fine, but just expecting people to have all the world buffs is understandably something a busy player might want to avoid. There's nothing wrong with being up front and honest about not wanting to be a part of that specific culture.
---
The real issue is that he's not talking about it in a very kind or respectful manner. Calling it a 'cheat' or an exploit isn't conducive to getting invited to a group, if only because it's not a cheat and it's not an exploit. OP should reconsider that part of their post IMO. But I don't think you or I will change their mind about whether it's an exploit or not, especially if they think consumes are cheating when it comes to PVP. ;P
---
"We are SO gonna do that"
---
-Asmongold, probably
---
Same Phylosophie with TBC: Hybrid-Classes didn't bring DPS they brought so much support with them so the whole raid benefit from it. Also other classes brought also Utilities so even Hybrid-Classes could do a lot of DPS. Because they also benefit from other classes.
---
probably talking about layering abuse
---
Totally agree. This “reference client” talk is getting pretty rich. Blizzard is just teasing all this obfuscated information through its often misinformed community reps. They talk the talk but do not walk the walk.
---
All the beta says to me so far is that they have gone about this project the wrong way.
---
yes, strong back support is key.  A plush kind of chair like in the picture is going to strain their backs and make them tire of playing quickly.
---
Scoffs in retail
---
UD shadow priest so you can face and then devour their corpse.
---
You can do that more than likely.  Idk if it will be high settings though.
---
The thing is buffing those specs into viability would almost certainly make them insanely OP.
---
TBC is the xpac that did better in that regard whilst still upholding - some -vanilla values, albeit not nearly as much as i'd like to have seen.
---
Haha I’ve thought this exact info. Win win imo. We either get a great classic release, or the greatest private server in vanilla wow history.
---
Cool thanks. Will level and pvp as feral, and if I end up in a raid guild again I'll give it a go:) cheers
---
Very true. But also will still find a way to make things work. Need more hunters to put in bug reports. Pets are a huge issue and might be taking more time than the autoshot and quiver issues
---
Having a good time.
---
what do you like in enh sham ? if its the fast paced gameplay , i dont think any wow class could fit !
---
Makes me sad how clicking on paladin just gives holy gear
---
I remember flying from Darnassus to Tanaris, going to Taco Bell, coming back, and still be flying
---
That’s stress test, not beta. They said they aren’t inviting any more people into beta
---
He's a dick who play alliance

OR just make layering until lvl 25/30 zones.... would fix every problem

By no means does it guarantee it. Just saying there is a correlation between the small number of invites given out and account age.

There's a 15 year CE thing in the gear store, looks like a classic thing but the store wont load for me right now to check

---
I would very much enjoy a lot of bugs slowing down the early game so people have more time to spend for social interaction.
---
There should be no other option then a release on time, maybe delayed by 24h of crashing servers.
---
They've got enough feedback with videos. They just need to start fixing. I'm already already going mage. Unless a miracle happens, I don't see me going hunter. I also see hunter mods on the discord re rolling. Keep in mind some of these bugs are still in retail since legion. I'm not very optimistic
---
&gt;otherwise you'll do Westfall 1, Redridge 1, Westfall 2 and find yourself stuck around L17/18 with only the Redridge quests in the mid-to-high 20s.  And if you're following the optimal route, you're ping ponging between the zones and it's hardly different than the horde grind.
---
wut, ive levelled alliance around 15 times from 1-40 in vanilla, and not once did I have to ping pong between zones. No grinding required, you can just follow the natural progression of the zones easily with no need to backtrack at all
---
Sodium is named NA in honor of the saltiest region on earth, North America
---
There won’t be one. Only people with the original CE can redeem the rewards from it in Classic.
---
Disarm Rotation!
---
Common baby I've got Blessing of Protection.
---
Man that looks really uncomfortable having the keyboard out so far...
---
He's just fucking clueless
---
I mean its pretty cool though
---
Oh. So like connecting each layer to a timer on resources/rares and etc? Idk if I’m understanding this correctly? But if so yes that sounds good. One minor thing though - What about avoiding ganks. It could be a big griefing mechanic and work to avoid or to set up ganks.
---
Those are the only 2 solutions.
---
Either limit server pop to 3k and have giant queues or have layering.
---
Unless you think it is a good idea to allow 15k people on a classic server.
---
We need murloc rpg part 3
---
Even if enhancement shamans do twice the dps in classic than they do in pservers they are still a low dps spec.
---
I guess you could. There's a vague use for cure poison that I'm not sure if it was ever relevant in game in that if you needed to remove a ton of different poisons (or stacks?) you could cast abolish and then spam cure.
---
Nobody fucking plays 49 Twinks. That bracket was always super empty. People do mostly 19 and some 29 or 39.
---
i have played both ... i feel a big loyalty to horde though

---
Because there is only few beta testers versus the crowd of the release... I hope it won't create exploit only funny bugs.
---
Congrats on playing one of the most fun classes in the game! Seriously, you’ll have a blast I think.
---
Definitely take the time to enjoy battlegrounds a bit while levelling, especially at 29 and 39 as between feline swiftness at 29 and travel form at 39 you’re the fastest class in the BG and just an absolute demon at flagrunning (you also have nature’s grasp, prowl, rejuvenate, and other tools that make flag running so much fun). 
---

---
He has a couple videos on his channel showing the editing process and each layer of the video
---
My point is the post doesen’t say ”When was WoW the most popular?” It says ”Which game was most popular this year?” There’s a difference, just pointing it out like a bitch
---
Yeah, it's your CPU. It's 7 generations behind the latest and almost 11 years old.
---
Problem is, a new CPU means a new Motherboard, a new CPU cooler, and new RAM.
---
And would cause a ton of new balancing issues, but hey let’s try to make one of the hardest to kill classes one of the best at killing. Get real.
---
Those are issues (if I’m correct) that are a result from them using the legion client. Coding the entire game and fixing issues takes some time. Imma keep my hopes high. Mainly want that feign death not dropping combat bug fixed. But there’s never “enough” feedback. Just need to keep pushing.
---
#I like both "retail" and classic!!
---
^^you ^^guys ^^are ^^the ^^ones ^^who ^^bitch ^^all ^^the ^^time.
---
That elemental devastation talent that gives you 9 percent melee crit is a trap.  Its not nearly as good as it sounds.  
---
Enhancement is a competitive spec IF you twist totems and use nightfall axe.   
---
Plain elem would probably be superior to whatever nonsense build you cooked up.
---
What faction/server type are you playing?
---
I live in a very nature-tastic place. Part of my sacrifice is living here. I have a networking degree, (physical stuff, not coding) and can't find jobs that pay a livable wage that use it. 
---
If travel wasn't an issue, one could lay fibre for 70K a year, but the home time balance would make it impossible to see my kids and chronically mentally ill spouse.  
---
They pay off, I answer phones for a living, and have a 2800 Sq FT house that only cost me 100k.
---
Thorns huh? A druid of taste
---
In reality you bake in extra time on top of your projections to buffer for the unexpected.
---
Most of the “crunch” I’ve seen is from misallocation of resources. Either too few people, someone raises the alarm too late,
---
or someone in middle-management doesn’t protect their reports and make it known help is an option (because it reflects poorly on them).
---
It’s one of my standard interview questions for any leadership role — what do you do when you start getting behind, or running out of time? You’d be surprised how many people respond with “more hours” instead of “more people”.
---
The issue with dynamic spawns is that they are area based so if you stack a large number of individuals in a region you can promote the spawning of key materials or mobs.
---
It also changes the leveling dynamic to generally focus grinding over a mixture of questing and grinding.
---
Also if your statement is that it doesn't change the economy. You cannot claim that layering affects the economy.
---
Because an L60 is going to be flat broke with zero faction?
---
Indeed. I hope they fix the hunter. It's been me for so long. Would be a shame to change
---
Play the free trial of retail WoW.
---
If you can run than you can easily run classic since it takes less resources to run
---
Good video again. I do really enjoy his face expressions. That is the best part. I do have one question: When will we see rest of the world? Keep up the work
---
The mooman has bigger biceps than the pink skin's torso. I go with the cow.
---
Hey buddy, no one ever even brought up that talent, nor builds. Please keep your issues to yourself.
---
Enh dps is not as bad as pservers and is competitive enough to complete most raids. That is it. Move on.
---
The only time I can play is on the weekends or after work on the weekdays. The most crowded times. With a large Queue I literally wouldn't be able to play the game. It's gonna be a hard pass from me. I don't care if they do change it. Get rid of Leeway and Spell Batching to while they are at it.
---
Well it does as long as they provide enough servers to spread the final numbers come phase 2 - during phase 1 layering is a scaling system to allow people to actually play the game.
---
Now that doesn't stop people getting queued by the login server rather than the game server though.
---
this is not funny
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed/Thu/Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore |Point-based Loot Council
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm practice &amp; preparation now. We most need Resto Shamans atm, but accept all great people who are willing to work to be their best.
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed/Thu/Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
**Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.**
---
**Looking for**: We are seeking a few more Resto Shamans atm, but great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within Epoch please send let us know and we’ll chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild Jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot our Guildmaster a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up our assistant GM on **discord:  XvK#7740**

? I'll play classic and I hope it does fine, but I'm also 100% sure that it's not going to be the biggest or one of the biggest games out there.
---
you will for sure get 60 but its just a matter of at what settings
---
They did it because they'd spent weeks completeing the scepter questline and putting their all into the war effort, for the other raid guilds on their server to just chill and wait while reaping the results of the "terrorist guild" effort. At this point the guild in question is just like "well ok, we're not getting any world firsts anyway, so let's just tell the other guilds to fuck off".
---
Just the amount of runecloth required for the war effort far exceeds 5k gold (something like 400k bandages serverwide?), asking for a little in return from all the other raiding guilds that'll benefit from AQ20/40 being open doesn't sound that far-fetched to me, tbh they should've asked for way more.
---
I would think arms warrior would be closer than rogue.  And more raid-able.
---
They got 15y range now thanks leeway
---
It's a sad commentary that a ragtag group of pserver basement-dwellers are able to create a better Hunter experience than Blizzard with all their talent and money.
---
It ought to be faster to fly to Duskwood and then follow the southern zone border if you're not a Druid, Hunter or Shaman.
---
Doubt it as there’s almost nothing that’s unknown at this point.  One of the few drawbacks to Classic IMO.  Is what it is tho!
---
I ran the stress test on a pretty bad laptop.  It worked but if I tried to go to windowed mode I got some "cannot start 3d accelerator error".  Tried some things I found from googling the error but nothing worked.  Full screen was fine though.
---
But it will have opened the gates which was the issue in the first place.
---
You kill him because he is an alliance rogue
---
You're creating a situation that won't often exist.  If that doesn't make any sense, that's okay.  You have to think it through a bit more.
---
Consider that if you are logging on to quest together in Westfall, then you likely logged *out* in Westfall together, so you were already on the same layer.
---
If you've been questing independently then taking a gryphon or one of you happening to log on in a city (a non-contested zone) is not a big stretch.
---
The only scenario that would work how you describe is if you and a friend arrive at Westfall independently, on foot, on separate layers and only then decide to group up.
---
Forsaken
---
This is a wonderful story. You, sir, are a true Rogue.
---
I mean you can define it as "low" all you want.
---
But their numbers would meet any overall requirements for each raid tier, and that is all that actually matters.
---
If anything I'm economical, not greedy. They're two pretty different concepts.
---
Moreover, this is how we as consumers can influence the market. This is how we can say "I don't like the way you do stuff, do it differently." I'm merely trying to play an active part in the shaping of the market on my side and that can include boycott of products/services and complaints about them.
---
With Blizzard's history I think it's warranted to call them greedy. This is not a one time thing. The fact that they have an ingame shop in a subscription based game with a full AA title price expansion every 2 years is another strong indicator. They should focus less on where to squeeze money out of their customers and more on delivering a good product. The money will come by itself if they do. The way they are treating their customers right now has been damaging to the game and the community for years. EA is not a company you should take as a role model (to be fair EA seems to be at least trying some things to better themselves)
---
Since you’re asking you must care about more than just looks...so it’s pretty much a no brainer...troll all the way,
---
But not necessarily by the standards back then. People were playing Halo: Combat Evolved, Starcraft, Warcraft 3 at the time. It was a subscription model that charged monthly with millions of people eventually playing. Comparing it go a f2p game today is disingenuous because this was the first time a paid upfront game had gathered so much success. Everyone in the media and pop culture knew it too.
---
troll cuz voodoo mask mon
---
omg your username lmao
---
Its a beta test. They are enabling layering before the server is full in order to test it.
---
I've seen so many requests lately that layering needs to be turned off in the beta, or that x person at Blizzard lied, but else are they supposed to test these features? People freaking out about layering being abused is just as bad, they're testing it and getting data and feedback, if they can prevent a way for it to be abused they need to do this testing first. If launch comes and layering is still as much of a fiasco as it is now I'm ready to freak out, but for now I think it's better to just chill out.
---
Always upvote Morbo.
---
Probably Goons by look if it.
---
This was the starting zone mind you.
---
I think most people completed supplementary content at L30 instead of L40. Things like leveling professions like mining/engineering took a decent amount of time, and they got pretty high skill levels, so when the level cap increased there wasn’t much more to do there.
---
Orbs proc against range attacks and scale with spell power too. Also DP is magic and can be dispelled by several classes. Troll hex is a curse and most mages or druids don't pay attention to that.
---
May I ask why he should change to paladin? Afaik palas are a lot worse for tanking and dpsing
---
That's the kicker though, isn't it?  The body of a BUD/S initiate eating 3000 calories a day is malnourished and underweight, the body of a person playing WoW all day eating 3000 calories a day is a fat slob.
---
That's how you break your knees, man.
---
WOTF is a good talent but it really only counters warlocks. it does help if a warrior ends up fearing you as well. But trolls berzerking is really fun to play with especially if you do some fun play like gear swapping to give you below 50% hp and popping it right away can help give you a good damage spike.
---
BWL houses a not so well known boss called Chromaggus. Whoever designed that boss must be a bloody psychopath. The spell weakness changes are cool, different breaths every week so you have to adapt is pretty interesting, lots of dispelling, but what's this? A 10 minute debuff that randomly stuns you for 3 seconds with no internal cooldown and can only be removed with sand that only drops in limited quantity inside the raid itself?!! I FUCKING HATE THIS DEBUFF SO MUCH I WANT TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME AND MURDER WHATEVER SICK FUCK DESIGNED IT!!!
---
Okay maybe not murder him, but definitely "persuade" him to change the debuff. Frequently I would just fake a disconnect whenever we did Chromaggus.
---
I hopped onto retail for a little bit after adding game time with a token I had on one of my toons so I could do the stress test.
---
I decided to create a void elf to check it out on my retail account. I knew I was done with retail as soon as I turned in a quest and the green item that I was getting as a reward turned into an epic quality item. My only thought when that happened was, Nope this is stupid. Why am I getting epic items at level 21 from a quest reward.

No chance. There's no game to buy for Classic, just a subscription.
---
They already released the 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition and it has no rewards for Classic.
---
Hunters are great at kiting Warriors, for sure. But if she was a Mage, it would have been even worse for her. Mages are definitely the best 1vX in Vanilla.
---
Hi in.
---
and run 100 feet
---
I'm being downvoted for asking a question... 
---
I thought the scepter was unique, but I guess "anyone" can get it if they have the resources.
---
I'm not going to a gym until the release WoW Classic Mobile.
---
Baron Geddon bombs were the worst, I think we even had a /gkick out of that fight.  We also had a guy troll us once that got raid kicked, when we had like 39 on raid night and needed a ringer to help out.
---
Also, the Geddon bombs were super frustrating because it was SO EASY to avoid any problems as long as you fucking ran to the back when you got it.
---
Cannibalize w/ evocation is a dream. Berserking for creating drinks/food/portals is very convenient. 
---
Some things I’ve seen others consider for racial choice are the casting animation, mount, tier set appearances.
---
When does the game release??
---
Shit post
---
Hi! Just curious, do you know how much of a difference there is between BFA and Classic in terms of how well they run? Like I presume Classic will run smoother?
---
I didn’t play in Vanilla, were these bugs present at that time?  Someone from Vanilla please say something because this could just be a very good recreation of the old school experience.
---
That's fine, I know it's an extreme opinion, but it's how I feel about it.
---
Don't have to be good at it.  Being bad at it is sufficient to increase uptime.
---
 They bring nightfall, improved grace of air, and imo wf totem.  Restore cannot stop at and goa, so they only drop wf.  You add that to their personal dps, and they are in the middle of the pack.  Top of the pack is no one else is using nightfall. 
---
 They can also be put in the group with the main tank, which will net a threat boost, which could translate to even more dps.
---
If you do the math, they are absolutely viable.
---
Horde pvp
---
Since you love enhance as it is now it would be crazy to miss the chance to try windfury when it was it’s most game-breaking.
---
I totally agree but MP5 gear for the majority of the level grind is not really an attainable stat. Spirit / Int and Stamina are the top stats, you can find a great mix of items with all 3, I don't believe any items pre 30 even exist with MP5 let alone Spirit / Int and Stam and MP5. 
---
Up to level 40 there are roughly 4 items that add MP5: https://classicdb.ch/?items&amp;filter=maxl=40;MOD_D=5:1:40;
---
3 of those items are gated behind PvP content, which will not be available on classic release.
---
Unless I'm mistaken and this stat can roll on green BoE drops, MP5 is really a post 50 stat. And by that point if you want to heal, start dumping points in Resto, as MP5 will help and you can achieve level 60 through dungeon grinding.
---
I noticed that “animated chain necklace” is not showing up in the item database. Is the database still being worked on or is that something that may need to be fixed?
---
Getting 40 people to show up on time
---
She wasn't always this way. We would only borrow here and there. We used to attempt to live within our means.
---
&gt;You can literally go starting zone ----&gt; Westfall ----&gt; Redridge -----&gt; Duskwood ----&gt; Wetlands
---
No, you cant. Westfall will only get you to 14-15. Redridge is lvl 20 zone.  
---
You either go starting zone - loch - westfall - loch - westfall, or loch - darkshore - loch.
---
While barrens can easily get you to 20 with a little trip to south stonetalon.
---
Yeah, another good point. Basically the majority of level professions was done at 30, and even tho they can be maxxed at 300 now, there is very little reason for any to level that high, compared to the advantages that could be had at 225 &amp; lvl 30.
---
Level 19 Twink Warrior Guide Step 1: Don't make a warrior twink, instead make a rogue or hunter.
---
Guide complete.
---
I'd love to see Open AI play a 40vs40
---
Feral druid  (assuming this is endgame) - to deserve your spot as a tank or dps, you need to farm manual crowd pummelers.
---
Forgot to mention the name of my Tauren shaman: black boy. Because my Tauren had black fur and I was black. My parents thought I was going to be reported for racism or at least cussed out.
---
There's not much difference. Only in video memory required really. And since BFA has multi-threading support, it actually performs better.
---
To be fair, this could've been naxx enchant era.
---
Talbar was made a thing of the past for a little bit when those were accessible to twinks (normally during tbc).
---
No weapon enchant though is a BIG yikes
---
Considering Hurricane does promos for (small-ish) private server projects I'd say just by the nature of how small the PS scene is/was he's gotten a lot of attention for his work.
---
Guy's brilliant at what he does.
---
**RISING**
---
We're **&lt;Rising&gt;!** A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on an EU-PVP server.
---
**Introduction**
---
We have all been waiting a long time for Classic WoW and we are looking to build our roster of players now so that we can really hit the ground running.
---
The main focus of our guild will be to build a community of friendly players that are keen to help each other and get the most enjoyment out of Classic. We believe that having a group of supportive players will be a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
**Raiding**
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 11:30 CET for progression raids, although I do not expect we will need all 3 days to clear the current content (at the start).
---
If you do sign up, we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is young, we're starting to get a core raiding team together, at the moment our preference on roles for new raiders are:
---
* Strong - Restoration Shaman
---
* Strong - Mage
---
* Strong - Fury Warrior
---
* Medium - Warlock
---
* Medium - Restoration Druid
---
* Weak - Hunter
---
* Weak - Holy Priest
---
* Weak - Rogue
---
We're running a Loot Council system for raiding with the goal to be as transparent as possible. While we know this can be a turn off for new members, we want to make sure that the loot that is distributed is fair and also rewarding for those who are loyal, attendant and good members of our community.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this will be much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. Personally, a lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid a capital cities.
---
There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members. So I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, willing to help their fellow guildies and be able to have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up on time and so on.
---
If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website https://rising.shivtr.red/. You will need let us know a little about yourself to ensure that we share the same values.
---
Additionally, if you have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord @[Rising] Boo#0059, @GlenCoco#3702, @mizi#3868 or @QFierced#7447.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
I think we borrowed around 20k last year.
---
^^Watch ^^your ^^back
---
I am bro. I am.
---
I'd think hunters would be very useful for all the undead instances where it's only them or priests for CC.
---
It sounds like we're in the same position, but have different attitudes. You want a modern game with conveniences and that caters to your schedule, and I want a faithful reproduction of vanilla World of Warcraft. You might find what you're looking for in a different game, such as BFA or Fortnite, rather than trying to turn vanilla WoW into something that it wasn't. Otherwise I think you might just be setting yourself up for disappointment. Best of luck.
---
I'm glad you had fun.  
---
I also excited and looking forward to Classic.  
---
But overall, I am thankful that you're going to play alliance with Asmongold.
---
It's 25%.
---
In my experience as a vanilla raider, arms wasn't really viable in raids.  The only time I could see this is being possible is if you're playing on the horde and you have shamans to drop windfury totems for you.  I played alliance, so anyone that wanted to dps in raids as a warrior was fury spec.
---
"Class rotations are boring and slow, there's no flying, too much grinding and leveling takes way too long"  It's funny you say that because I can guarantee there will be this complaint thrown at classic when people get into it again. I've been playing in the beta for a few weeks now and I love it but all those things are what people moaned about back then. The community makes it so much better though :)   
---
What class / race / side are you planning on? :D
---
Actually you have to take into account that stunning the enemy three times in a row is already extremely rare. You have only 0.8% chance (0.2\*0.2\*0.2) that this happens as a hunter.
---
Now out of that 0.8% you have 2.7% that the three will be resisted, which means you have roughly 0.000216% chances that will happen.
---
I'm 27 years old and I'm happy that they removed it, if you wanna be a fucking nazi you can go do that in your private life and not broadcast it in my video games, thanks
---
Naxx, actually.  Could be applied to BoE/Whites and traded back.
---
I didn't say it can't run it. Just that you may not get 60fps on high settings under all circumstances.
---
Make sure you try every spec and a ton of talent combinations until you find what fits for you. Druid probably has the most flexible talent trees. Be prepared to spend 50 gold on respecs a lot lol. Also be ready to carry 2 or 3 sets of gear on you at all times so you can heal or tank when its needed. A good druid is probably one of the best supports in the game not just in terms of abilities but as a player support. Group lost its main tank, druid can step up and save the dungeon run. Same for the healer. Some one is trying to escape a gank. Hots and roots to the rescue. Remember that you are first and foremost a support class, that can specialize in whatever type of support you want to do most
---
I played the Vanilla open beta briefly back in 2004, but I didn't start playing retail until summer 2005.  By then, most people were 60.  But being a teenager with time on my hands, I caught up pretty quickly.
---
This time around, I will have a lot less free time.  I'd like to take it slow, but my primary motivation for playing is to socialize with friends, and I don't want to miss out on months of early dungeon and raid groups.  I'm thinking of doing the no-life thing (but primarily on weekends) until 60.
---
Either way, I hope the first phase lasts long enough for more casual players to get to 60 and experience some early Ony and MC in greens and blues.  That should be great fun.
---
The main thing I plan to change this time is to be more efficient when leveling.  That means no leveling trade skills (except skinning) until I hit 60 and have a mount.  And although I love the low-level dungeons, I will probably just do them once for the quests, and not farm them for the good drops.
---
Didn't say I wasn't bored, just not bored enough to look at anyone's posting history. :P
---
If you're looking for laptops, I picked one up on eBay for about 550 basically brand new (had one minor scuff and dent on the shell), it was a return... £1050 brand new.
---
If you're from the UK, check out speedyauctionsuk on eBay
---
You are partially right.  Resto is really the only viable RAID spec that shamans have.  However, if you're in a really good guild and can pick up some unneeded hunter gear and a beastly 2 hander, you'll be pretty much a god in pvp as enhancement.  Go watch an Unbreakable video if you've never watched one.  He's pretty much regarded as the best enhancement shaman back in Vanilla.
---
Lots of mass vs little mass
---
If it's anything like the orginal launch I look forward to standing in line next to you while we wait for our turn to kill kobolds for level 1 quests.
---
It won't feel the same as starting a new MMO. Everything is already discovered, every meta is known, every move can be already planned ahead of release. "Empty AH" - that won't change a thing. People already know what will sell well, what new people would break a bank for.
---
Yeah, I was going to say.. EverQuest was an absolute sensation during its time. Blizzard learned a lot from it.
---
Thank you. I’ve been wracking my brain trying to remember Illegal Danish.
---
They implemented Layering
---
In 2005 every town had at least one computer arcade business that was full of nothing but wow players.
---
It was mainstream af.
---
Eyyyyy
---
Stopped reading at «INVITE TO ASMON LAYER»
---
"Dear Blizzard, please do something horribly inefficient because I'm another armchair developer for Reddit.  
---
PS. If you don't explicitly spood feed us every bit of info to bug fixing, like we're micromanagers, the consequences will never be the same."
---
Nope, ret aura uwu
---
If you mean your personal dps spamming shocks and stormstrike is competitive, then you're crazy.
---
He doesn't mean it was the first mmo, he means it was the first streamlined mmo with a much more casual approach (in 2005 anyway). No xp loss, no gear loss, optional pvp, easy to understand skills and talents. It turned mmos from being a niche market to being something "anyone" could play.
---
Even as horde, you're two hand fury as opposed to arms.
---
I didn't start during original vanilla but played other game's day one of launch and it is a satisfying feeling.
---
As I said, one can dream :D
---
Spoken like a true PvE carebear!
---
You're stating you are playing "casually", yet are asking a "min/max" question.  
---
Regardless, play with whatever race with which you identify and do not worry about racials. Add some RP elements to your decision and go with that.
---
Awesome. I hope it's every bit of fun as you hope!
---
Wait...what? You subscribed for one month in the last 10 years and you feel blizz should cater to your aesthetic sensibilities and go against the overwhelming demand of a player base that was so overwhelming it forced blizz to create another game?
---
What an entitled asshole.
---
Chill it's a joke
---
I play on PVP only.
---
&gt; Just the amount of runecloth required for the war effort far exceeds 5k gold (something like 400k bandages serverwide?), asking for a little in return from all the other raiding guilds that'll benefit from AQ20/40 being open doesn't sound that far-fetched to me, tbh they should've asked for way more.
---
They didnt have to do the war effort. The scarab gong questline did not require that either. If they wanted to make a scepter, they could have just skipped the war effort completely, and let others complete it.
---
But they chose to do it. Probably because the rewards from turn ins were actually quite good. Rares, BOE epics, rep, etc.
---
And if other guilds were chilling - all the more reason to go ahead and ring. Your guild gets a scarab lord, their guilds dont. If you dont care about world firsts, thats good enough of a reward in itself (considering back in classic there were very few unique mounts or titles. The only titles came from PVP, the only mounts came from racial vendors, PVP or the few rare drops (baron, zg tiger, zg raptor, brewfest ram). So having someone with a SL title and black scarab mount was VERY prestigious. Like, a lot.
---
I actually expected some logic seen as wow is all numbers and stats but obviously deep down we all just wanna be brahs
---
I think he is trying to say 100 million league players is a lot of salt. He worded it very poorly though.
---
Holy shit dude. They bought you a car? nice!
---
I had to sink my tail between my legs to borrow 500 to fix my families only car, or lose my job.
---
Here are the reasons I think (I'm STILL undecided) I'll go Dwarf:
---
* PvP Trinket, Vanish, and Improved Sprint all break movement impairing effects
---
* If you go sub, you'll also have reduced CD on vanish and the ability to reset all your CDs
---
   * 2 sprints, 2 vanishes, and a trinket are enough to make Escape Artist seem redundant.
---
* Stoneskin brings something new to the table, especially since we don't have cloak of shadows
---
The only real reason to go gnome, i think, is because its absolutely hilarious. In vanilla, i feel like the majority of the good alliance rogues on my server were human (probably because humans are optimal for raiding and raid gear &gt; pvp gear), and I barely remember any of their names. But the one gnome rogue that kicked ass? We've kept in touch to this day.
---
Whatever you choose, I think you'll be happy. I rolled an undead rogue in vanilla and I loved it. I never felt gimped and never felt like I didn't have enough utility. I never felt the need to reroll to get different racials. I have a feeling it will be the same with classic. Flip a coin. Pick what you think looks funny and unique. Those are equally valid reasons to pick one race over another. I just don't think that level of optimization will ever really affect gameplay in the long run.
---
I totally meant to reply to this earlier. I feel the same as you do; I'm really hoping to get ahead of the general population if only because it'll make the game a little quieter and therefore more fun for me. 
---
I had the same thought about making mistakes after getting tired...that would really suck and I don't want to get stuck in that rut, either. I was thinking of just trying to get out of work at an appropriate time on Monday (easier said than done sometimes), and then napping for a little bit (honestly any kind of nap would be better than nothing), hyping up on caffeine...and then zooming into the game to get moving. I haven't done a 24 hour session in probably a decade, so I'm not sure I can do it, but it surely can't hurt to try if it means getting ahead of the zergfest, right?
---
Best of luck in your attempt for your 30 hour session. :D
---
What is 8 times two? 16 is a high percent for one class
---
Sorry you commented without understanding :(
---
everyone has a base 5% resist, which is what I think his question is. So base + orc = 30%.
---

I had a Paladin in Vanilla with Naxx gear, 5/5 Avengers, and DEoI. The TBC prepatch with 6s Crusader Strike was literally the best few weeks I ever had playing this game.
---
I **really** hope Phase 6 will eventually introduce some week-long pre-patch holidays once every few months.
---
Technically the title got added in tbc. There won't be any "scarab lords" in classic. The mount is there tho.
---
I believed this too, at first. But after talking with some guys from a private server guild with the experience needed to pull this off, I think rag will die first week. They have every minute planned. Have their leveling routes planned and practiced. But what really changed my mind, is hearing that the 40 man raid group has an 80 man support group that will set up warlock summoning positions for them while leveling, help mob tag them out of the starting zones, and do all the gathering/profession farming they need. And they have private test severs where they've already run mc at lv 58 with greens for gear. It's way more crazy than I had assumed.
---
Sadly I think you are right.
---
A big part of the classic reboot appeal at least to me is that for the duration of classic, we won’t have any class rebalancing. Can’t wait to enjoy the game without worrying about your class / spec getting cucked every patch
---
&gt; All your utility is either useless or very low impact
---
Calling their utility useless is about as hyperbolic as you can get.
---
Try bringing 0 Warlocks to MC and let me know how Garr goes for you.
---
Alright, thanks man
---
People aren't thinking in terms of benefits to the raid,  they are thinking highest personal dps, and assuming that's the better option. 
---
In retail it most often is outside of niche fights in mythic raids.  But that's not how it was in classic at all. Every class and spec brought something useful,  you just have to know what group to put them in for them to be effective.
---
No char protriat or hp bars? He's alive, just viewed as wisp - probably client side only. Repost from another players POV.
---
I'm not talking about his post, I'm talking about him misspelling. Don't be stupid.
---
He used the words spaghetti code, he knows what he’s talking about.
---
If it's around for longer than two weeks, we are screwed. Blizzard is betting that Classic will not be popular beyond the initial surge, and they are betting against the continued erosion of the game. If it is popular to where me must endure layering when more people are in the 40-60 range, it will not be a fun time.
---
Okay thanks for the clarification that really helps. I 100% rolling Orc Hunter if the stats stacked in that way.
---
Leeway:
---
The biggest problem I see is how much the average player's mechanics have increased since Vanilla. Even if someone knew that bug back then the odds of them implementing it were low.
---
Today I think any player who's capable of getting to Plat+ in league of legends (easy as fuck) will be A-Ding against range all day, if that 12yd melee hit boosts my deadzone to 12yd I'm super fucked as a Hunter.
---
I did hate many things about legion but for me personally it had enough good things to balance out the bad compared to BFA and WOD.
---
I mean, they'd get Scarab Lord anyway as no one else on the server were actually working on completing the questline. They'd get it if they rung it on day 1 or on day 20.
---
Can you elaborate? Why would me asking for more manpower working on the project come across as me trying to be an armchair dev?
---
Short, simple and to the point. Kudos, sir/madam
---
His backs watched. Alotta gnomes gonna get skinned.
---
What does pet a.i mean?
---
Why so much Gnomeregan?
---
It won't happen, as the previous commentators have stated.  
---
Also, I think it's great that it won't. Adds some indication of the OGs of Vanilla. You see someone playing classic with a mini-diablo, zergling or panda cub and you know they were there in the beginning. #respect
---
Un Goro and Winterspring.  
---
But everyone knows the Barrens is where the party's at
---
&gt;I think he means more like first mainstream games that really grew a huge community
---
Runescape had about the same amount of players as EverQuest, the difference is that Runescape was free and ran on every crap PC at the time.
---
For its time, EverQuest was a massively popular game and was really the first fully 3D MMORPG to attain that status. The late 90s / early 2000s was a different time where you had to be a real turbo nerd to be playing an online fantasy RPG.
---
WoW released a more accessible title in the genre at the exact time when the internet began to explode in popularity and admitting to playing online videos games was slightly more socially acceptable.
---
Timing is everything - EverQuest was Myspace and WoW was Facebook.
---
MC will definitely be cleared by week 2. 1 is possible but unlikely
---
It’s doesn’t matter tbh. Even with tongues we can still out heal most dps and bubble out of anything.
---
Alliance is by far the leaders in pvp in Classic not even a debate.
---
My senior year of engineering masters starts the day before, we’re all gonna be making some big sacrifices 😂
---
great, fuck hunters
---
I think they mean that 100 million LoL player represents a lot of salt, not that you're salty about anything.
---
As someone who played Holy Paladin for 99% of Vanilla, just get used to Ret being useless until the end of Vanilla when they will hopefully release TBC talent trees like they did for the last month or two of vanilla.  At that point, they let everyone grind out grand marshal swords without the rank. I grinded out the sword and had full tier 2 as well as a few tier 2.5 pieces from raiding (2.5 is the best ret set in the game).  With that gear and the talents that added crusader strike, I remember getting a 4k judgement crit on a mage in AV.  It was the highlight of my childhood.  I guess my point is that in Vanilla, with only Crusader Strike added, geared ret paladins were already OP.  Unfortunately we only got to play that way for a month or two before TBC released.
---
Westfall really made an impression on me. The calm music and helping those poor familys with the harvesters.
---
Can't wait for my RNG sword proc + WF Proc and insta kill a squishy.
---
&gt; GeForce 2 with a 800MHz Duron processor and probably like 128MB of DDR memory.
---
Just looked up because that sounded like at least 2x as much as it would have been for that time period. Turns out the GeForce 2 had 16-32MB. How times change!
---
This was great!
---
I think the best solution I’ve heard is to force the ~2000 highest-level characters into Layer 1.  Layer switching for groups would force everyone into the highest-level player’s layer.
---
Holy shit
---
Seriously if that human is not able to doge such an obvious strike he is a waste of training...
---
But in the long run that human will be paste, with the reach and power advantage ...

&lt;Name Tentative&gt; | [NA-PVP] | [Horde] | Midcore [Days being Discussed: Monday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday]
---
-	We started as a small core of Final Fantasy XIV players who played back in the early days of World of Warcraft. At that time, we had not met but performed in our individual guilds. However eventually after raiding together in we decided to form a new guild for WoW Classic.
---
Our Experiences:
---
-	Experiences vary and not everyone has been to Blackwing Lair or Naxxramas, so we welcome new and old players alike to join our guild and raid groups to learn and experience the raids.
---
Expectations:
---
-	We expect punctuality and a cooperative attitude in a competitive environment. Perks and Officer positions will be determined by performance and chemistry within the guild/raid group.
---
-	Players are expected to come prepared for raid; Guild will help with supplies if needed. Preparedness includes food and potions as required per a fight.
---
Jobs Being Sought:
---
-	Currently we are seeking all positions for our raid group.
---
If interested we have a discord for talking about the game and the preparations for the WoW classic servers: https://discord.gg/FJYk4rb
---
We look forward to seeing all who join us!
---
I was in the vanilla beta and never got another beta invite until legion, and didn't get a classic beta invite.  I probably know this game better than 95% of the playerbase and I'm willing to do free testing for Blizzard, where's my invite?
---
Turns out it has nothing to do with account age or being a loyal subscriber.  It's either be a streamer or fuck off and hope for the best.
---
That laugh HOR HOR HOR HOR HOR HOR HOR HOR
---
because you have very limited insight in what blizzard is doing
---
Ooga Gang is immortal. They are immaterial and transcend reality. They were here from the dawn of time and will remain until the end of the world, after all else had faded. In time, you will understand their judgement.
---
People were also still playing older games like Starcraft or Warcraft 3. If we only went by titles that released this year, we wouldn't be talking about Fortnite, League, dota 2, etc.
---
i cant really remember the details but our main tank was skilled enough to kill the rogues every time on nefarian
---
I still use class and spec forum websites,  they are still very much a thing.  And class discord's are blogs and forums at nearly immediate speed
---
Undead master race.
---
I've noticed there's a symptom of reddit  where everything has to be exaggerated to the extreme for validation.
---
Sure, anything is possible
---
Then you still have axe specialization and bloodfury
---
FWIW people keep citing Kevin Jordan saying Vanilla had dynamic respawns, which is technically true, but deceptive. There was a slight modifier on them, nothing super crazy. Additionally, Gurgthock mentioned that the current BFA implementation of dynamic respawns is **not** supported in Classic.
---
Found the DM
---
Nice one, cheers! :)
---
On the one hand, having 15,000 people on a fresh server (like the private servers) isn't Blizz-like, yet layering is also not Blizz-like. I like the idea of layering because having each layer the population of an OG vanilla server is great, and then merging the layers after the inevitable population drop-off will help from keeping servers dead. Classic WoW is likely not going to see constant growth like WoW saw from 2004-2010, so layering seems like a necessary evil.
---
On the other hand, we've seen layering get abused. Also, I think part of the reason Blizzard down-ported from modern WoW is so all of their backend technology works to support servers (like layering, having Classic servers launch from the same client, payment processing, customer support, etc.). But now there's all these echoes of modern WoW in the beta. I just watched a video called "12 Quality of Life Improvements That Weren't in Classic" and I'm just smfh like "wut y doe."
---
Overall, I prefer having official Classic servers, but Blizz is often in a lose-lose situation. Can't make everyone happy.
---
Rather be a 'gullible idiot' than a pathetic waste of life like yourself.
---
Have a nice week!
---
Speak for yourself. Travel, questing, and leveling are some of my favorite parts of the game. That's why I'm a classic fan.
---
Plus an additional like 15% from talents if they spec into it XD. RIP alliance rogues
---
He is only going to lvl and nothing is really that hard. Let him pick something he likes. 
---
Well the game is 12+, but you as a parent have to deside what your kid can handle.
---
Personally I think it's fine. I got my Gameboy at that age and classic isn't violent or anything.
---
Movement impairing effects are roots and slows.
---
Stuns, polymorphs, charms, fears, incapactitates are considered effects which cause loss of control of your character.
---
Pretty sure it doesn’t stack, it just changes orc’s base stun resist to 25%
---
This comment largely ignores the massive history of MMOs well before wow. It was an era when game companies were creating games with content instead of cosmetics and loot box lures for cash grabs.
---
My biggest debate when I play... Idk if I will pick the Zergling again or go for the Diablo.
---
so no moonwalking either?
---
I’m blind, can you point out what he means?
---
Looks disgusting to me, paladins should not have attack abilities.
---
I changed names all the time, I think I joined EO to tank Illidan as a pala warrior. I think then I was Ieros/Archangelos/Sangran or something like that. I remember a warrior that brought a classic two handed axe that increased magical dmg taken by 5% just to push that extra dps on the boss. I'm pretty sure that was you...
---
Ever seen a car crash into a tree? Hint: it's not the tree that breaks.
---
There’s no other MMOs even close to the size of WoW though, it’s not saturated, it’s shit
---
Paladins with HOJ, shadow priests with blackout, bm hunters with intimidation, destro locks, fire mages.. I'm not sure about grenades and tidal charm..
---
I made a little spreadsheet with a few columns such as fun factor, raid viability, farming/pvp potential and leveling efficiency all ranked 1-10 and added the points up. Ended up with Warlock barely beating mage.
---
I’ve specifically seen clips of people doing exactly this
---
I want to play hunter, rogue, or warrior but the combination of the relatively bad racials of the dwarf is forcing me towards humans and elfs which looks alot worse unless you play as a female...
---
Being the only scarab lord on server is different to being one of the two/three scarab lords.
---
Wow it looks like people have differing opinions and yours isn't more valid than any other opinion.
---
It did exist and there was also Holy Strike. It was a strictly better Heroic Strike afaik due to it dealing Holy damage.
---
They should ban all these "possible" and "viable" questions.
---
&gt; and you know they were there in the beginning. 
---
you can buy it right now on ebay lmao
---
People still turn PvP on PvE servers, plus often it spreads in a city due to buffing, leaving bg's etc. And you would turn PvP on and call his name.
---
Even better
---
In 1.12?
---
It’ll be ruined in short order don’t worry.
---
Layering didn't exist in 2004 either but that doesn't seem to be an issue for you?
---
Sure we can do this, but warrior's get MoP's entire kit.
---
So that’s what happens when you walk into an instance portal
---
theres a rough pentagram that centers on duskwood
---
Agreed. I’d love new models and new casting animations in Classic as an option, but it’s not a hill I’d die on.
---
Hopefully we get some kind of TMorph hack to make the changes.
---
Generally I agree, and I'm opposed to a lot of the crazy alarmist stuff that has been getting churned out on this sub recently.
---
However, layering is described as basically an entire new server stuffed into an existing server, that only activates and populates when population on the base realm exceeds X. If there are ANY layers active when there are less than 3,000 players on the beta server, to me, that shows that the layering tech cannot possibly be working as described.
---
Further, I see the testing of the contraction of layers to be just as important as the testing of the creation of layers. And if the layers are factually not contracting when they are not necessary, that seems like a very big problem to me. And when we have had weeks of silence on the topic of layering now that we've had a chance to try it out and it seems to NOT be what was promised.. that does become concerning to me, and is worth a bunch of whining forum posts about.
---
In wrath it had 12m peaking, I'd call that mainstream. In 2005 it was not mainstream yet, might of been mainstream in your group of friends, though.

My wife and I alternate an exercise ball a computer chair (which I got her due to some back problems), but our computer room is too small (and doubles as a movie memorabilia room) so we had to put them on different walls.

Really excited tho, putting a meal plan together now, will cook the week before, so that I won't have to cook or do anything that might take significant time away from the game.

"Curve" is the Ahead of the Curve achievement, which you get for clearing the current top raid each season on Heroic or better. "Rio" is your raider.io score/profile.

---
I have some bad news for you ...
---
&gt; too much grinding ...
---
Uh oh ...
---
&gt; and leveling takes way too long.
---
Nicely trolled, 7/10.
---
Raiding anything beyond BWL or AQ as a Hunter in Classic if you care anything about being competitive you will be sorely disappointed. It's my favorite class in Vanilla but Hunters got no benefit of scaling off gear upgrades, they need to fix this issue as they are dead last in dps of pure's by a huge margin in later raid content.
---
You can definitely tank 5 mans. The PvP side of things will depend on what kind of gear you have available.
---
Apparently private servers have been overestimating druid feral damage a bit, but it was never spectacular anyway. I feel that druids are much more valuable in PvP as healers, but you could easily FC with that build.
---
Homie, Its ok to be a clicker while you level. I rep ground Argus for my Light Forged while hung onto my  new born daughter in my left hand.
---
I got the bonus dmg on beasts enchant on my lvl 19 twink just because of the looks. Simpler times back in the day
---
Mods can we please got “Cata Kid” flairs on this sub?
---
I’ve been seeing a lot of misinformation in threads only to find they’re mostly coming from people who didn’t even play back in the day.
---
Same, not the kinda people we need in classic,  they need their own dedicated server to fuck around on
---
Pretty much the same. Your CPU is only one generation newer than OP's and is still ~8 years old.
---
Still good taste. Why kill your enemies when they're willing to kill themselves
---
Yeah, I remember that. Used to pick a decently geared warrior in the BG (in the waiting area) and then just follow that dude and keep him alive. Was lots of fun.
---
Could you two be swayed to join horde?
---
Yeah. It's the same for my side of the family. I've only ever borrowed one time to pay off $700 debt to my school so I could go back.
---
Haha maybe 😀 so the noble warrior will return after wotlk again😀
---
This isn’t fake, zoom into the figure ontop of the tower
---
You're going to have the same "issue" (gearing up) if you play any class casually. There's no difference if you're a tank, healer, or DPS.  
---
Having said that, every class can still (casually) grind out Best in Slow (BiS) gear, outside of raiding. So the real question is, do you want to play as a tank/warrior? That's something you need to answer.  
---
But do not think that because you're a DPS or a Healer, you'll have the ability to gain gear easier or faster than a tank.  
---
Mining/Engineering is for min/max people. If you're playing "casually", this isn't something you should worry about. I would say, learn engineering if you think it's fun and useful to your character and it will do just that. But it will not be game changing.
---
I’m so pumped!
---
Lucky you, you’ll be having sex and play classic
---
And so long as you don't purposefully hunt people trying to RP in the world. If you corpse camp two or more people who are clearly RPing rather than playing normally, that's a dick move and was a common agreement on RPPvP realms as something that should not be done.
---
Sure, kill them once if you're super trigger happy. But then move on. Any more and you're actively disrupting RP which annoys people and breaches the RP server rules.
---
I didn't main a druid in vanilla, but I'm planning to in Classic. I recently made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3b97c/with_10_buttons_or_less_your_macros_can_access/) on macros. I'm super excited to macro and hotkey the hell out of my druid. You can see (an unoptimized version) one of my druid macros in the OP. I think I'm going to post a full list of my macros and setup later this week, since people were interested.
---
I think they're the highest skill ceiling class in the game. With a 0/30/21 or 0/31/20 (plus or minus Nature's Grasp) spec, and appropriate gear swaps, they can actually play their versatile role over the course of a raid. You'll generally play one role in a given fight, but over the course of a raid night you'll likely play all three.
---
I agree 100%, so long as it's done conservatively. It's clear and also admitted by Dev's that certain specs were incomplete and they were NOT happy with how they lined up. These were fixed in future patches, however in Classic we are stuck with 1.1.12 which means there are several specs that are broken and useless in PVE.
---
both
---
Fox only. No items.
---
Compare:
---
The virgin Perception, Stoneform and Shadowmeld 
---
VS.
---
The Chad Warstomp, Hardiness and Will of the Forsaken.
---
Mmmm I'm pretty sure it does. Just like it stacks with the defensive tree's 15%. Everywhere I've read or heard talking about orcs with 30%.
---
Ur ignoring the fact that enhancement sucks and that was his point.
---
Are there going to be German servers though :P
---
And back then CoD = WW2 shooter, not MW
---
Wish they'd bring back the pre 1.9 prot tree. HS at 21 and Repentance at 31 made so much sense. Your full tanking kit came online 10 levels earlier and you had an interesting and thematic but still optional skill at 31 with repentance. Putting BoK at the top of the Ret tree was dumb though, should have replaced that with Crusader Strike and left Prot as-is.
---
All Shadow, Elemental, and Balance needs is better mana scaling on spells. Ret just has low damage.
---
&gt;Also if your statement is that it doesn't change the economy. You cannot claim that layering affects the economy.
---
This is completely true, and I do not think layering really impacts the economy either.
---
Yes dynamic spawns are area based and yes theorically you can stack players and somehow promote the spawning of things, I don't really think that's an issue as long as the dynamic spawn area is a large enough area. Obviously if the spawns of creatures depends of the amount of players in say 10 yards and you stack 5 people in that range, you can force fast spawns, but if dynamic spawns considers say the amount of players in an area bout half a zone worth, then you can't really stack enough players to do anything signficant, because the amount of players needed to make spawns fast is way too high.
---
Does dynamic spawn change the leveling dynamic to focus on grinding? I don't really see how it does, as long as quest objects are affected too. On all the previous pserver launches with dynamic spawn I don't think I've grinded more than I would on any launch. I would try to skip bad quests and do as many high lvl quests with grinding to catch up in experience from the quests skipped, but I would that with any launch, in fact with on a proper launch with 3k players split between the 6 starting areas, I would probably be forced to 5man group grind as any quest object would be far too camped with about 500 people in each starting area.
---
What day does this launch again lol.  I’m tempted to try it out.
---
Thanks man, very useful reply. I will cook up my lunches on Sunday night and repeat on Wednesday for Thurs &amp; Friday. I will use dry rub style spices on my protein I think - Should be able to mix it up that way.

You should have seen the No Man’s Sky sub before it turned into people ripping the devs a new one

It was like this post over and over and over
---
I always go for the mini-diablo on my main. Diablo 1 was the first Blizzard game I played. I soon found out about Orcs v Humans and picked that up and the rest is history.
---
But the original game that got me into Blizzard games was Diablo, so I have to pay respects to them mini-diablo.
---
That’s kind of how it was in Vanilla, too. Nobody in raid gear bothered to do the T0.5 quests. It was mostly used as catchup-gear (with AQ20/ZG) and as content for dungeon-runners who didn’t really raid.
---
I haven’t checked the stats on them to see how they compare to BWL — are they mostly on par?
---
Too right, though I assume any Rogue that attacks me as a Paladin is suicidal anyway.
---
I could be wrong then! I’ve just heard others say 25% but they could also have that incorrect. I hope it’s 30% though, I’m rolling Orc warrior lol
---
Yell at my healbot to psychic scream and refuse to acknowledge their humanity.
---
I replaced it at 22 with a dagger and sped up my kills and lowered my downtime big sad
---
Dps warriors depends how many are online between 6 and 8 dps warriors depending on who shows up and 1 feral druid who is bis at this point because he has no competition for drops your not gonna top the meters but hes regularly jumping in to off tank and what not so you just gotta be cool with that
---
Yup, and you only get 3 character slots before launch.
---
Choose your names wisely.
---
are you me?
---
WOTF is heavily overrated you will be fine.
---
To this sound, I'm timing my aimed shots!
---
When did I claim otherwise? I'm sorry that you don't enjoy most of classic.
---
As a babby UD rogue back in the day Paladins reinforced my hatred of the Alliance, until I eventually rerolled Alliance and took up the glorious path of the Light. Lux Vult, fellow crusader, Lux Vult
---
TBC was my favorite expansion by far. So much so I'm playing a TBC private server. But I realize they can't release Classic TBC and give the option of staying on Classic Vanilla or it will divide the community and kill potentially both games. I think adding content to Classic with sideways/catch up gear/alternate itemization without raising the level cap is the way to go.
---
Hi, /u/Grant_discpriest

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4r4hm/are_classic_servers_down_right_now/). 
---
Nope that's right, and that's why everybody who says "omg if you buff hybrid dps they'll be OP in PvP" is an idiot. TBC buffed group utility, dps of hybrids was still mediocre, but instead of joke support talents like Improved Weapon totems, 3% spell critical to group, and refunding some hp as they do damage they were given awesome support skills like  Unleashed Rage, 5% spells crit for group AND +3% hit to the whole raid, and refunding mana from their dps in addition to HP.
---
Did you play the stress test?
---
They're 4 many times when summit joins them
---
&gt; a class who just faceroll AoE-Damage and Single-Target-Damage
---
You mean like mages and warlocks?
---
Trying to stay awake for the whole raid. I was on the east coast but on a west coast server/guild.
---
I remember you! We reform the old vanilla guilds btw! Ender, Elite Order, In Nomine Mortis, twenty four seven, Amaterasu , Northwind Gale  and others are going to play together in a common server. I’ll send you a discord link if you want to join us ( or just join Classic wow community). 
---
And yes, that axe guy was me! It did 15% increased magic damage debuff and blizzard nerfed it a few weeks before sunwell. Shows how valuable that axe is going to in classic :)  which was even better since it was a minus resistance debuff!
---
I found Asmongold’s mom
---
it'll be funny when all the asmongold fanboy zoomers quit at level 20 because they dont actually like vanilla.
---
If you're willing to buy a game for whatever it's sold on eBay on the off chance that someone will give you some sort of acknowledgement, than 1) I'm saddened for you and 2) you've put in the effort, you deserve that /bow or /cheer, lol.
---
Most of BWL gear is better, iirc. Which is why I think it would be best if available at the same time. If your BWL gear is BiS, then these 0.5 pieces could be a great since it'll take weeks of raiding to get most of that gear.
---
But they still got their wish of being noted and having held the server hostage until someone else did it.
---
Fuck off. Waiting in a Queue is not gameplay and it never has been. No one will pay to play a game that they can't actually play.
---
What is a graffikort lol
---
You're greatly overestimating the damage they would be able to put out with a Heroic Strike clone and an AOE that would take up a substantial amount of mana.
---
Sounds like a good idea.

---
In case you've never played: read the quests, enjoy the lore of where you're questing. Old timers like us will skip that (what do I have to kill? How many boar livers?) But the story and world are really well done. The beginner level quests have yours to later ones, and it's all connected in near ways. Don't worry about hitting level cap asap. If it's your first time, enjoy the magic 
---
It's like going to Disneyland for the very first time. It's okay to small the flowers, admire the views. Barrens chat is toxic but the zone is beautiful (and coming from an alliance player, that says a lot. ;))
---
Great opportunity to make new friends, team up with them and share those precious quest mob kills. 
---
Also, layering will help a ton! Although that's a pretty controversial topic around here. :)
---
Can we get a "Crusty Boomer" flair for people that care about this sort of thing?
---
Hey man, marrying into money is a time honored tradition. so, hi5!
---
My best friends lil bro married into a family of "salt of the earth" farmers who as a wedding gift game him and their daughter a 3 bedroom house and 4 acres of farmland and access to a pole shed.
---
Go NS regardless. I used to do ele mastery but NS has way more situations to be used than EM.
---
In wow they have this feature where you can invite people to a group and then you all get credit for killing stuff
---
No but seeing thousands of players running around sure shows what's gonna happen
---
I think Super best friends sounds like a perfect home, read my post in pve alliance us and let me know what you think. We're all about working folks having leisurely fun
---
It's kind cute ...
---
Thank you for feedback!
---
It's pretty funny you chose all the classes that are basically a dime a dozen.
---
&gt; Looking at the above, mage or rogue seem better than the warrior, but as I said I also love "topping the chart" in damage in bg's. So I'm stuck. 
---
This is wrong. A capable warrior destroys both of those respective classes with ease. As a warrior your real threat comes from shadow priests.
---
I love these! They are AMAZING!
---
LOL, in BC I had someone ask my paladin to make him some water.  I told him I had to drop my pants to do that.
---
When it comes to PvP and 1v1 PvP in particular I highly recommend Shadow Priest. I know it‘s not on your shortlist but give it a thought.
---
Besides that a well geared and well played Warrior just wrecks stuff.
---
A bug huh? Report its bitch ass.
---
I agree. Tbc was the best times for classes. I would never do that much dmg with my elemental shaman but it was enough and the utility was too good. I think blizz should have gone that way a little bit longer in vanilla.
---
Warriors in pvp were absolute beasts BUT you need the gear, so if "anything is good enough" then I'd go rogue as you'll get the most bang for your buck with the minimal gear requirements. Can't comment on mage as I never really played on all through wow.
---
Given that you don't want to depend on premades and are looking for a strong class 1v1 and don't seem to care much about PVE you should rule warrior out.   
---
They shine brightest when they have some PVE raid gear and a premade.
---
Upvoted for reality and manhood.
---
I'm hoping we see Gorak buy some new armor when he reaches Razor Hill/Sen'jin Village! It seems like it's an episode per quest/holiday so we may see a Midsummer episode next! I just can't wait for more Gorak!
---
I'm gonna do the best I can to collect the mats needed for the Dreadsteed quest and wait it out, if necessary. I'm hoping to hit 60 in roughly two months time, so hopefully phase 2 won't be too far off by then. No way I'll buy a regular mount in the meantime because the Dreadsteed is just way too cool!
---
We know theres an internal build right now. But there hasnt been an update in weeks. Literally since I think 1 week before the level cap?
---
So theres been no real chance to address hunters. They fixed some of the early bugs with the class in that patch weeks back, but those were minor. Proof:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/major-bug-auto-shot-broken-is-now-fixed/183442
---
The class just hasn't had its large pass yet. This is provable by the fact that we can tame pets 2 levels higher than us still... Does anyone really think thats going to go live? I don't think its cause to panic at all. Theres been 2 major patches in beta so far. Just two.... According to blue posts the internal build has hunter fixes, attack normalization fixes and a small hit table fix.
---
This is part of the fun!! Find different ways to level! If you can’t handle it play BFA ^_^
---
Top flag carriers are Druids by default!
---
I mean they could just use the new animations anyway. It's all client-side anyway.
---
Troll has some cool stuff for shadow, like Shadowguard proccing Blackout and giving spell pushback.
---
Needs more underboob.
---
Bring a balance or two to buff the mage/lock crit and give your priests innervate.  Bring a feral or two to off tank/buff your melee.
---
Boom, everyone is happy.
---
Warlock weren't such a thread in DPS. Warriors where crazy and Mages yes. But those are not Hybrid-Classes who can do everything. Those are DPS-Classes and they should do DPS! That's why DPS-Classes went DPS and hybrid-Classes went Heal.
---
I saw someone recruiting for a guild recently and they explicitly stated:
---
&gt; 2 weeks vacation at launch required
---
fucking LOL
---
Weird how you can directly fly from orgrimmar to gadjetzen but not ratchet
---
Did you receive an email about the beta invite, or did you just have access?
---
Yeah, maybe, and that's what I did before. It's just offensively NS isn't all that needed since chain lightning can be reduced to 1.5 secs anyway and has a cooldown. Maybe something like CS&gt;NS+LB or CS&gt;LB&gt;NS+LB.
---
You're thinking like a solo player, stop and think. For something that needs x kills, grab some people near you and work as a team. Chances are those people you see around you at the start will be the same peeps you see through your time on that server. Make friends, team up, kick ass, remember you're not in Kansas anymore.
---
When did you start playing WoW? 🤔
---
I intend to do PvE, I just don't think min maxing matters nearly as much there (since I won't be in a progression build).
---
But did you even have to communicate to get through the raids?
---
lol i like the screen whats wrong with me
---
Warlock: soulshards. Enough said.
---
Feral druid: doing a freaking complicated rotation with a lot of swaping but still doing less dmg than the rogue.
---
Hunter: not getting the name xXlegolasXX
---
Just accept you were wrong. It's okay man, how else do people learn.
---
Isn’t sharding in to start with? If so surely you group up with someone and have free reign?
---
I haven’t been keeping up to date so this ya be replaced by layering already
---
Sometime in Vanilla
---
Models with collision like trees or building's wouldn't work because it would affect actual character positioning and be potentially exploitable. 
---
Character models on the other hand, no reason not to have a toggle; besides the fact that it would take time to add, which devs likely don't have seeing as the game is coming out so soon.
---
Yes, if you are a hybrid STFU and HEAL if you want to do any raids....nice balance indeed.
---
Regardless Orc is 100% an insane PvP race.
---
Whichever has overwhelming numbers. Therefore on most servers, Alliance.
---
Well drop that part of the argument and warriors outside of a premade do not shine as bright as some of the other classes. Warriors will stomp through players hard if they have a healer behind them. But 1v1 alot of classes will just keep you at range and roll you.
---
It's easy if you are a hunter. Rogue is pretty decent with knife throwing too.
---
I think Classic is a little different since the itemization is more RPG-like and it isn’t ilvl dominated. Stuff from DM will still be BiS when those raids are available.
---
Screenshot the email invite with the date
---
There was a beast warrior on my server that you just ran from. He was like an unstoppable freight train that needed a few Spriests just spamming fear. AV's had literal teams dedicated to stoping him if he appeared on the battlefield it was rediculous.
---
I remember in WoTLK if you used bladestorm the same time you were sheeped, you’d actually turn into a sheep for a fraction of a second, and then pop out and start bladestorming 
---
You couldn’t use bladestorm while stunned/CCd but it felt great to see the stun, and then have bladestorm work a quarter of a second later
---
Suuuuuuuuuuure
---
Layering is still in the game and it’s fucking annoying so how about blizzard fix the shit then maybe people won’t post about it so often?
---
I leveled 1-10 in 3.5 hours on the launch of the stress test with a mega scuffed route.  The 2nd day I did it in just over 90 minutes. 
---
It will be ok, don't worry.
---
Warriors are very gear dependent and that definitely shows up more in PvP. If you can a) grind out the gear and b) find a buddy that will toss you a couple of heals, then play a warrior.  
---
Mages are multi-class specialist. They can definitely focus fire, but in a BG, you can take on 2-3 people at once. Not nearly as gear dependent as warriors, but definitely more squishy.  
---
Orc stun resist is not the end all be all to fighting them. You should be able to adapt and not just stun-lock your opponents. Rogues have the advantage of planning their attack and therefore work well in solo and in group play.
---
Btw this is a troll post
---
Its for a friend, how you managed to achieve this?
---
Unless you are playing Orcs.
---
Orcs, by default, being the superior race, even if when they are sitting down, you have to assume that they are jumping, flipping and do a 720.
---
As long as he is not playing on an EU server it'll work :-P
---
MMOs are not the smallest niche at all.
---
Have you tried [https://vanillafriends.com/](https://vanillafriends.com/) ?
---
In Classic WoW quest items don't share so u have to kill as double the amount of within a group. (which I will be) the more you know.
---
I'm looking for it aswell, this was a classic. No idea why Lazydork removed it from youtube
---
Orcs do suck to play against as alliance but there are more undead players than orcs anyway. So i would say playing an alliance rogue is more than fine. You don't have to stun to beat someone. It is nice for control but generally i was able to stun as an orc rogue my warrior buddy who was an orc warrior plenty. Yes a resist happens. But in the end you are a rogue, just pop a cooldown and reset the fight. 
---
I think the class you will have the most fun with will be classic rogue, go sub and have fun doing the lords work locking players down and stun fucking them to death. If you need a spec i will gladly send you the one i use to full to dead players as a rogue.
---
If you want to keep close to a Ret paladin then rock a human warrior and get yourself an arcanite reaper for starters and find yourself a good pocket paladin and you will rock so many people in BG's.
---
Dont believe the other guy. Classic will be way easier to run than bfa.
---
I guess the best way to put it is that Blizzard is notorious for setting release dates that are unrealistic, and cost themselves a lot of bad publicity and loss of revenue as a result. If the Devs they have can't handle the work load or aren't equipped to be able to deliver for the set date then someone, likely those who make these decisions, should stop having jobs at Blizzard. This isn't just with WoW but just about every unpolished buggy abomination they have released in the last 15 years.
---
Get the fuck out, bigot.
---
Did you forget the part where you’re playing a multiplayer game?
---
&gt;I am mainly focused on PvP. Most specifically, bg's. Doing the most damage in bg's.
---
Based solely on this then Mage is def the way to go. Just go chill at a packed spot in a BG and spam AOEs, the thing mages excel at, and you'll easily be near the top of damage done. 
---
Mages are also a great 1v1 class, but have a higher skill floor than rouges and warriors due to multiple mechanics like kiting, mana management , spell timings ect.
---
Gnome is the popular pic for Ally mages since they get a bit more int than Humans and a racial that's great for avoiding melee classes.
---
During the stress test on realm 13 their was a huge raid of level 15 horde in westfall. Alliance made like 4 full raid groups to fight them, eventhough many were under level 10.
---
The horde kept shouting the macro for "O O G A G A NG Z H I T" and "O O G A" so i made macros for "O O G A UR MO M" and " M A G A", which i shared with alliance so everyone could start spamming them.
---
I was a mage so when i died in the middle of the horde i just rezed on top of them and spammed arcane explosion, which eventually broke their ranks and alliance started chasing them to moonbroke. I remember me and this rogue chasing this undead mage to the coast while i was spamming "M A G A" the whole way
---
Well I’m going to shame you for shaming the people shaming the people shaming retail players. 
---
If shaming people is so wrong then why are you doing it? Shame on you!
---
Hope you like the taste of your own medicine, which is medicine for terrible people. People like you. 
---
Shame! SHAME!
---
Have the servers with the same name (Kargath 1,2,3,) All share name databases, it fixes the issues layering has, which is tearing the community apart in many, many pieces (6+),abuse, etc and solves the issue of a merge issue.
---
from [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)
---
&gt;If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
I’m switching from alliance to horde with my friend. Also from a PvE to PvP. Even though I had some low level horde ults on different servers back in classic, I’m super excited to get the full Horde leveling experience. And sure I’ve played the horde dungeons when LFG came out, but I think it’s going to be a nostalgic but amazing new experience to actually run the horde zone dungeons in classic. Overall, I’m fucking stoked.
---
Haven't found it yet
---
Derpina hair!
---
It’s not a dead meme, it’s classic.
---
I would absolutely hate to have a union in my job.   Unionizing doesn't work for majority of industries.  I don't know why it gets pushed around on reddit so much.
---
It could be my memory being off, I haven't played in a long time. My bad!
---
It’s an if and maybe of long term ruination of the economy. You presume it’ll have a lasting impact, with no evidence. “*If* they do this, then *maybe* our economy will be forever fucked”
---
devouring plague, checkmate forsaken!
---
Clearing MC for a year and only seeing one binding.
---
The OP is a noob lol
---
Yes and we had giant queue times.
---
It was super fun getting home from school and not being able to play for 2-3hours.
---
Definitely, a little cheat I do to make my life easier is to use an “instant pot” electric pressure cooker, it lets me cook frozen chicken is the same amount of time as baking thawed chicken.
---
Then I find tastey premade sauces to throw in there and cook together, such as teriyaki, green chili wing sauces, anything I can find to flavorize it without adding too much time (or carbs for my goal) to the process.
---
&gt; a) people wouldnt spread between those servers evenly if they cant switch back and forth. the first server would be completely packed and would have nearly the same problems as servers without layers.
---
and this is exactly what happens with layers.  1 realm with 100k players, and 9 realms with 1k players.  unless they cap the number of layers, in which case realm 1-4 have 25k players and a 10 hour queue.
---
Woah, a calm rational comment in this sub? I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
---
Ok so I played vanilla from launch, including 60 rogue, 60 warrior and 60 mage, including rank 11 with two of those, so I might be able to throw some valid opinions for you here.
---
Now, the first thing to address, is the use of the word "best". There is no hard objective way of defining that. The most important thing is, what is best for YOU? Owning people in 1 on 1's? Or contributing in a meaningful fashion to helping win the battleground?
---
Remember, in a battleground, the objective is not to kill other players. Killing other players helps you fulfil your objective, but it is not the end goal.
---
All three classes can do both of these, although warrior can have a slightly harder time in one on ones.
---
Let me break down the pros and cons for each of them more, from my direct experience in PVP. All three classes are specific tools that must be used in different ways.
---
Warrior - he can be a huge wrecking ball, but he cannot do it on his own as a fresh level 60. He needs two things - 1, good gear, especially a good weapon, and 2, friends to help dispel him and support him. If you have these two things, they add up to greater than the sum of their parts and you can truly become a killing machine. If you DON'T have these two things, playing a warrior in an aggressive style can quickly become an exercise in frustration. You have to play more defensively and protect your own teammates, rather than lead the line.
---
Rogue - Playing a rogue requires a cold and calculating mindset. He is uniquely suited to achieving certain objectives, such as capping flags or hunting flag carriers. He is also very powerful in 1vs1, but ONLY if he gets the opening. He is very weak in wide open spaces when he is spotting first, especially by classes that can put a DOT or other type of stealth denying mark on you. He feels very powerful in certain situations, but very weak in others. 
---
In a mass brawl, a rogue cannot and should not stand on the front line, or he will quickly find himself CC'd or dead. He should be in the backline looking for isolated enemies.
---
There is a lot of technical study you need to understand before you can play the rogue to full potential. Do you know what a stunlock is? Do you know how to apply one? Do you know the advantages of using the hemo attack? Do you know how to combo your seal fate daggers attacks correctly? You must learn all of these moves and have them become second nature.
---
Mage - the mage is also extremely powerful, and less gear dependant than both other classes. The mage can fulfill two roles at the same time - high burst damage and crowd control. Sheep and snares are amazing in BGs. With sheep, you are effectively deleting one player from the game for 10 seconds, and with a snare on a melee class, you are doing it to two players. 
---
The mage requires extreme quickness of thought and action. You will die extremely quickly if you get things wrong. You must be totally confident in your abilities. Do you know how to do a double shatter combo? Can you blink out of a stun before an opponent can apply any damage to you? Can you iceblock a deathcoil in mid-air? You must have quick reactions to be a mage.
---
Right click his name and hit report
---
We were talking about rogue stuns not chance on hit stuns.
---
Grenades, HoJ, and warrior charge - are the real contenders here. Blackout is random and relatively rare, so is mage's impact, BM hunters aren't specially common in PvP, Locks don't have stuns (never saw anybody putting points into that improved Rain Fire in my life). Let's not even talk about Tidal Charm which will be ultra rare without dynamic respawns.
---
I agree with the OP a little bit. Stuns aren't that common at all, and Hardiness is a passive - and completely relying on random procs in PvP isn't possible. Yeah Hardiness will save your ass more than once, but so will the other Horde racials, which also have this to them that they can often be included in rotations in PvP. War Stomp for example is savage when played properly.
---
It will say "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic" if you're in.
---
Yes exactly.  My head-canon is that the Goblins don't want to be directly associated with the Orcs in order to maintain business relations with the Alliance.  The flight master in Ratchet is a goblin, so he's not gonna fly you DIRECTLY to the horde capitol.  Whereas the flight masters in Gadgetzen are separate for Horde and Alliance.
---
Yeah how do you turn that on? Is it push to talk or continuous?
---
There's still going to be 500 players fighting over starting area spawns with layering. They limit each layer to 3000 players. Take 3000 and divide by all starting areas based on data gathered fr beta for races and you'll get an idea of how many people will be there.
---
During the stress tests, some of the loot item quests were overflowing with people.  It's a big problem and the reason why layering will exist.  Even with layering you might not be able to do those quests.
---
Right so you kill more, get the items, and a bit of extra XP and loot. We've had three stress tests so far (first one being two tests over two weeks), and it hasn't been hard. Sometimes mob spawns delay you a bit but layering ensures you do get mobs to kill, it just might take longer. And there's bottlenecks occasionally with items that need to be looted off the ground and are one per player (Teldrassil Relics quest, and the item to loot in a dresser by the Furbolgs, etc.). These respawn though and you eventually get it - again depending on how many players there need those items it could take a while, but you can always skip those quests and grind a bit or quest elsewhere.
---
The stress tests are ensuring these things are smoothed out but it's why we have layering. It'll be fine.
---
I mean, that was the most non-committal answer I think you could get.  He literally said;
---
&gt; If you are going to ask me to ballpark a random number....
---
And 
---
&gt; We don't want to lay out a rigid schedule....
---
So, I wouldn't put any weight behind those numbers.
---
“Shadow priests”
---
Frost mages are the real warrior counter honestly.
---
next time youre on add me, bhell#1125
---
The lootable quest items have a very large respawn timer on Pservers. They're practically instant in Classic.
---
To be fair, I do think Blizzard will likely get there, but I predict it will be after launch.
---
Hmmm, as a developer I could easily see myself putting this on the backburner for 15 years haha.
---
The amount of people who use scroll wheel to jump is probably extremely low.  And while I understand why you might have it bound like that (I'm assume from playing CS), it's probably safe to say that bug only effects a very very small portion of the playerbase.
---
I guess the real BG reward was the friends we made along the way
---
It also removes poisons from raids bosses and some threatening PvE scenarios.
---
Reddit users are some of the most dense MFers out there
---
Except it doesn't provide more dps. It provides more burst potential for sure but your rage generation will suffer tremendously on long fights. It's only somewhat viable for Alliance because they don't have Windfury, what makes Windfury good you ask? It provides **a lot** of rage from the extra hit.
---
It's close to impossible to time Slam right after an auto attack perfectly. You will lose about 0.1-0.2 seconds and then you also factor in the delay while you're casting Slam + your inability to move. And like many people know, the worst part is how your swing timer is reset **after** the cast.
---
I feel people tend to forget why Warriors are such monsters in PvE, why they scale so well, so let's put it out here for all to see.
---
Better gear = more hit and crit. 
---
More white hit = more rage. 
---
More white crits = **even more rage.**
---
Auto attacks is the main source of your damage and rage, and any loss from this source will cripple the your overall output.
---
Oh right, the whole "no changes" thing. Perhaps I'm misremembering vanilla, it has been quite some time.
---
Stress test(Which this thread is about) was all current subs.
---
"Honey, we need to talk...."
---
Your not in. Your a retail player....
---
I'd put more weight behind those numbers than speculating Phase 1 will last any longer.
---
Ahh so maybe I'm [not in](https://gyazo.com/bf5f0c01796ab9fe8645769309cc790c)?
---
I remember when a guild tried something like this on my server. The server just laughed as this lame attempt. The server knew they wanted to get started in AQ right away so the server played the long game as most guilds where still happy to clear BWL for an extra week or two. The guild just couldn't help themselves as they where losing progress by not opening it so after a week they rang the gong.
---
Flametongue weapon, searing totem, auto attack.
---
This, other have linked videos from classic wow.
---
The effects weren’t as prominent as they are in this video
---
iirc from the books the advanget humans had was that they reproduce very fast so had a lot of soldiers and natural affinity to magic.
---
Correct. You did not get the beta.
---
When was this literally ever said? If a post’s focus is on Classic WoW, it will be kept and encouraged. 
---
If a post is created for no other reason than to shit on Current WoW, it’s going to be removed.

&lt;ATLAS&gt; HARDCORE | NA | HORDE
---
**CURRENTLY ACCEPTING ONLY EXCEPTIONAL MAGES / 1 DRUID**
---
ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.**
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

---
Sorry to say it buddy. They are just doing preloading stuff it seems.
---
Totally agreed with this. I hope that classic is considered a small enough project that there isn't too many hands on top of it.
---
True, especially for offspecs.
---
They actually asked the the other competitive guilds if they want to go AQ real bad that weekend and all refused. So they did this Joke to troll the rest of the server. I even have recorded evidence. Can link it when I'am at PC
---
I moved to a pvp server in wrath and i am so glad I did, couldn’t imagine going back to pve
---
That's not true, most guilds in Nax bring 1 MAYBE 2 out of a 40 man raid, dream on they are not viable beyond BWL.
---
Blew my mind with berzerking for food, holy shit
---
Honestly, Rogue is the best class in the game IMO. You have so many tools for solo leveling or just fucking around, and the fight mechanics are super fun. I feel like Vanilla is a giant playground for Rogues.
---
I haven't played WoW seriously since Cata, only played MoP and WoD for a couple months, and haven't played Legion or BFA at all. Yet Classic has actually invaded my DREAMS. I've been literally dreaming of playing Classic. It's so close, yet so far.
---
Short answer is yes.
---
Yeah, but you don't know what they tested. Maybe they were testing that people went to the right layer so they just tried with a bunch of people. Or they are in the process of tweaking it and it's still not working as intended. That's what the beta is for after all.
---
[See my response here](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3e4i8/_/ertct9j/?context=1)
---
&gt; Based solely on this then Mage is def the way to go. Just go chill at a packed spot in a BG and spam AOEs, the thing mages excel at, **and you'll easily be near the top of damage done.**
---
As a frost mage the importance of CC's can't be understated since they're the best class for controlling and turning the tides in BG's. You're not going to be topping the charts by doing that unfortunately. You're supposed to use a classes strengths to your advantage. Now, if he's more concerned about farming HK's for rank 14 then a warrior is best. Melee classes scale the best with Rank 14 weapons.

# We are &lt;Fury&gt; | Horde - NA - PvP | Loot Council + Loot List | Competitive
---
2 Weeknights on Monday &amp; Thursday 8:30–11:30 EST.
---
Our number one priority is having fun in this game, &amp; fun for us means being competitive in pvp, world pvp, &amp; raiding. We, the leadership, are going to aim to be a top guild on a server &amp; encourage members to reach their greatest potentials in pvp &amp; pve.
---
We plan on being foundational members of a Horde coalition on our server that works together to control world bosses &amp; strategic areas of Azeroth. On our current private server, members helped lead &amp; kill world bosses early on in the server.  For battlegrounds, more than half our members aim to achieve rank 10+, including our main tank. We will host &amp; encourage members to host premades throughout the server’s life.
---
**Officer/Member Prior Experience:**
---
The vast majority of our members come from different private servers, with the current GM helping lead the #1 NA guild on the server, &lt;Soon&gt;. Members are well versed in raids, bosses, &amp; pvp, &amp; are always willing to share info &amp; help new members that need assistance.
---
We expect members to be competitive, come ready with consumes and world buffs, and perform each raid. Pvp will be encouraged, but not required.
---
We are recruiting **all exceptional players**, especially resto shamans. All spots are based on performance &amp; attendance come launch. If you think you’re a dedicated player, this is the place for you.
---

Mistakes happen. If you haven't made a mistake in your job or hobby (and a hobby is exactly what moderating is, which is important to remember) then I'd be impressed.

Your arguement is off topic and retarded

Nah.

Warpath got the sceptre and made a truce on the Forums letting ever one know the day and time they would open it.  Hundreds of H and A showed up and made like a sweet honor guard thing..

Trolls are cool mon
---
... What lol no, not at all. They aren't catering to my aesthetic, they already did that. That was my point.
---
What I'm saying is, why is it not possible to have the new look and feel they have dedicated time to over the years on the original story? Like watching your favourite movie from the VHS era in HD. The movie is still the movie it's just more clear. It's not like plot points change. The effort to dig up or recreate a system from 2004 HAS to be work. There's no way it isn't.
---
Either way you're getting what you want with a toggle as a current subscriber to the retail version? You're not going to pay them more for classic and you're probably sure as hell not going to cancel your retail if they gave you a new model toggle (I assume, although some people seem pretty passionate against the ability to choose).
---
They gain so little by catering to people playing retail already. No money gained.

I always thought it'd be a cool puzzle mechanic to have an area with lava surrounding a thin, winding path, and if you stood on a certain spot, got drunk on a certain drink, and auto ran, you'd follow the path perfectly

Rogue's are op in both pvp and pve, Warriors are op in both pve and pvp once geared, Mages are op in both pve and pvp and Locks are op in both pve and pvp in the later stages in Vanilla. Hunters get the SHORTEST end of the stick in Vanilla, it's almost like you haven't played one. If you haven't at max level in Vanilla then STFU you have no idea what you are on about.

Nice, one more and this one came prepared.

unfortunately i cant tell you if it works all the time - it just happened, i thought i was funny, thats why i shared it with you guys

I love trolls but their plate helmets, lack of shoes and posture are deal breakers for me.
---
Yeah I mean I always take EM when I switch to ele leveling at 40 and it is quite addicting. It’s probably one of the most underrated strongest wpvp abilities when leveling. I swear that shit took out 40% of peoples health bars with just using earthshock with it from 40-50. I remember getting jumped in ungoro n roasting two melees from a nade em cl combo n they were like ??? Waiting to release spirit.
---
I would recommend Mage to pretty much anyone that didn't make up their minds yet.
---
They just have so much QoL abilities. Making your own drinks, portals, breaking stun effects with blink, evocation, sheep, counterspell, shields. The list goes on.
---
Also, each of the three talent specs are viable in multiple phases of the game.
---
In addition, you can pretty much solo anything that can be frozen.
---
To top it off, they do very decent damage in both PvE and PvP.

Im down to ague this, but not on the thread, send me a DM

Hey everyone. I'm guild leader for a guild I'm putting together for classic.
---
You might recognize my name from other posts I've done on this subreddit highlighting some in-depth information about WoW Vanilla. [Post on Blackwing Lair](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs6mxw/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_warn_you/)| [Post on Honor System](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0m1gb/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_talk_to_you/) . If you see what type of effort I did for those posts, just **imagine what I'd do for you as your guild leader**. Food for thought.
---
* Currently we have a core group of 30 people ready for Classic.  We're recruiting heavily on the front end so we can have a solid core on launch which will pay dividends over time.
---
* We are HORDE and will be on a PVP server. For some reason I need to explicitly put this here because some bozos always ask if we are rolling alliance. No, we are not. All alliance must die.
---
* Most of us are around the age of 30. All of us have jobs, some have kids. **We might be an ideal fit for people who want a guild that is aiming to eventually progress.**  Also, if you're younger you're still welcome to join of course.
---
* We haven't decided on a name yet because we are more focused on getting the right people first.
---
* **We will have a heavy PvP focus**.  We have numerous Vanilla rank 14's and I personally love world PvP.
---
* Yes, we will definitely do PvE too, but understand we will most definitely not be a 'World First' or 'Server First' type of guild.
---
* **We don't have a raid schedule yet because it's just too early to tell.** I can't even tell you what I'm doing next month lol so it doesn't make sense to me to post a raid schedule for something that is 4+ months away.
---
* Most of us live in Central or Eastern US, but we don't really care where you live.
---
* **Experience is not needed**. Would actually much rather have an easy-going person who is easy to talk to instead of a pretentious know it all.
---
* **I'm more concerned about culture fit than skill fit.** People can always learn/improve -- it's more important to have the right personalities. Come hang out in our discord to see if you like us.
---
* **No class or role restrictions**. We have a google doc that has a class breakdown of everyone who is planning to play, so you're welcome to take a look and go from there.
---
* I've mentioned 'culture' a lot so let me best describe what I think our culture is: regular dudes who like to play video games. We have bankers, statisticians, real-estate developers, academics, mechanics, food/alcohol distributors, nurses, etc. Come from all walks of life.  **A sense of humor is required for sure, but you aren't expected to be chatty if you just wanna be chill**. You're completely welcome to join and just be a fly on the wall for all we care.
---
Message me here or just join our Discord if you want to check us out:  [https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF](https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF) .  I'm Adam on there.
---
Don't forget the only reason we're getting Classic is because a developer got the old 1.12 data working on the modern engine and server infrastructure.
---
Horde, because alliance are a bunch of pansy sissy-boys, who are also complete scumbags.
---
The OCD in me agrees with you.
---
"Forgot" to aim Nef's head away from the rooted rogues after their class call. In one year of BWL, I can count on one hand how often I survived that fight.
---
Do others see you as a wisp as well?
---
Thousand Needles is amazing in classic.  It has a lot of quests and you can get 3-4 levels out of the zone in one go from 28-32.
---
&gt; Blizzard has a copy of the Classic 1.12 client; but chose to use a modified Legion client instead, because they thought it would be more economical.   
---
Or they thought that over ten years of bug fixes/improvements/hardware compatibility to the game client itself are worth retaining. That means that when retail gets a e.g. graphics hardware bug fix, network stack improvement, etc Classic gets it too.   
---
Is it more economical? Likely.    
---
Is it also better for Classic in the medium to long term? Absolutely.     
---
People would have criticized Blizzard either way. If I was in charge I'd do what they did: use the retail client's core, but essentially build a Classic version of the game onto it. 
---
It created bugs, which is bad, but once those are solved there are little to no downsides.
---
As if 1-10/12 isn't totally on rails anyhow.  Literally just clear every quest in the starting zone.
---
Just to clear something up, I am by no means "a noob", I've been 2.5k ranked in Arenas (top players were 2.7 or 2.8 k at the time, and yes I'm aware it's a private server and they're known for being "worse" than retail). So if that's affecting your judgement, don't worry.
---
Not going to lie.  There will always be a soft spot in my heart for ffxi.  I loved that game.  I honestly view that time as the golden age of MMOs.  Ffxi, wow, gw1 just to name a few were all fantastic.  I loved every minute of them.
---
No one quits wow. There's just different lengths of breaks.
---
I get that reference.
---
Aren’t you the same guy that said you wouldn’t play as long as there is layering?
---
&gt; Have the mods decided to ban discussion of Classic WoW that is critical of retail and/or the demographic that plays it? 
---
Yes, however this has been the rule and how it's been enforced for 2 years. We have occasionally allowed substantial posts that are not insulting, and we have also occasionally had a few slip through. By and large, however, they're removed - don't make one and expect it not to be removed. This goes also for posts that are positive about Modern WoW, post them on /r/WoW. 
---
We're not here to talk about BfA. That has been the express purpose of this Subreddit since it's inception, to be a place where Classic players can discuss Classic. Why would you go to the Call of Duty subreddit and talk about Battlefield? 
---
&gt; If this is just going to be a subreddit controlled/censored by retail players I’m no longer interested in visiting.
---
That's a fairly strange way to interpret 'we don't allow discussion of Modern WoW here'. I'm sure with recent expansions to the mod team several of us do now play Modern, but this rule has been enforced in the exact same way since Classic was announced. This is a Classic subreddit, it's for discussing Classic, if you want to discuss Modern, go to /r/WoW.
---
Believe it or not people make mistakes. It's very often as simple as that. :)
---
Ah yes - Blizz came in to “put us in tow” after Blizzcon, the same time they fired multiple Community Managers, left our discord, and we lost communication with them for several months.
---
I feel personally attacked by this post. 
---
Too accurate mate.
---
I for one am glad they are using the new client. The games engine has improved over the last 15 years and why  would you want to use an engine that had more limitations? The amount of bugs is disappointing but using the new engine allows for more content in the future.
---
Playing a Warrior in BG's without a pocket healer is definitely a waste of time
---
Careful you’re going to trigger some warriors.
---
Lol this dude has been complaining non stop here
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore 
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing. 
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first. 
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient and players should aim for 80%+ attendance. 
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game. 
---
&gt; Core Raid spots available for:
---
&gt; 1 dedicated offtank
---
&gt; 4 fury warriors
---
&gt; 2 rogues
---
&gt; 3 resto shamans
---
&gt; 4 mages
---
&gt; 3 locks
---
&gt; 1 resto druid
---
&gt; 1 mm hunter
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit. 
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
Goals
---
I hope you guys make sure you have your shit buckets close by.
---
I didn't know that existed.  Unfortunately there's about 4 guild names on there that could have been mine, but I think our guild name was Nemesis because after seeing that it sounded very familiar.  I'm probably going to get on discord to contact the guy some time tonight.  Hopefully I've found the right guild, but if not, maybe he'll at least remember my character and can help.  I was one of only 2 (maybe 3) dwarf paladins on the server with full tier 2, so I kind of stuck out.  Thanks for the link, my dude!
---
Uh, I'm sure I'll be able to find a guild that isn't full of elitist try hards. Dude other suboptimal dps specs like elemental shaman are also viable enough if you know what you're doing and come prepared. Balance can do mid-tier dps on the charts believe it or not
---
Thanks that’s some good info! Are people generally willing to help in game?
---
Yep I'd say it's 
---
1) Top damage done
---
2) Good at 1v1.
---
For me. PvE and "supporting" fall on the sidelines. 
---
I know, I know, bg's aren't about "who got the most kills", but that's just what I want out of the game.
---
Based off what you said I'm leaning towards mages the most now. Against a "premade warrior" can they do anything?
---
Yes i do ... Just made 2 Videos ...
---
without mount i needed 9 seconds to reach a destination
---
the same destination with mount is 8 seconds
---
considering that mount is 60% and wisp 50% it should still be there
---
You have to go to every zone in classic.  You can't skip any.
---
“Turbo nerd”
---
My new favorite
---
True, but I don't believe the base building and/or tree *models* have changed too much for that to be an issue. (In the original game areas I mean. The new WSG/AB is waaay too different and would have the exploitables that you mentioned.) Just slapping higher resolution textures on them would be lovely. 
---
For example the [streets of Stormwind](https://i.imgur.com/JeXWthX.png). Ignoring the color difference because the pictures were taken at different in-game times, I'd love to see the HD textures like this be an option for players. It would definitely have to be down the line though, because yeah it's too close to release I'm sure.
---
You are rolling a Warrior in Classic, it's funny all of these no changes posts are always from people playing one of the big 3 op classes in Vanilla W/M/R ofc lmao...IDIOT.
---
Troll are also a good choice for pvp due to Hex of Weakness
---
The reason we’re getting Classic is $$$, pure and simple - Blizzard is bombing with recent releases; the best thing they can do for their bottom line is re-release old classics, with new graphics -
---
Starcraft Remastered
---
Warcraft 3 Remastered
---
WoW Classic Remastered
---
—
---
Think about that; the only good games Blizzard has nowadays are their old games
---
That's not how it works.  Anyone who wants to play shaman will roll horde, you can't double the faction numbers to say how popular shaman will be.  Because ultimately the pally numbers mean nothing to shaman picks, and vice versa.
---
Man i hope thats the case. I really wanna be a shaman, but its kind of discouraging seeing how many others want that too. Its the most popular class on horde. I take that to meam that there will be a lot of competition for shaman raid spots. 
---
All i wanna do is cast big dick chain heals, so my hope is that every other shaman tries to make windfury montagues. More earthfury set pieces for me!
---
Well,  you weren't wrong! Eesh
---
You walk away. What he going to do, Run 40% slower while invisible?
---
I'd think they'd want to keep as many subscriptions as possible. Seems like that would make more money then scaring away customers. 
---
I think the team handling classic is just doing weird tests on thresholds with layering, and otherwise seeing how it plays out with each stress test. 
---
I also think you should take off the tinfoil hat.
---
Although this post makes absolutely no sense in any shape, way or form, it also makes a small amount of sense.
---
Hell people were a lot more helpful back in the day, I remember doing my WW axe quest at level 33ish. It got too hard for me rather quickly, so i asked for help and some 60 stayed with me throughout the entire chain. Great times.
---
You might want to read what execute does.
---
LMAO at people saying they'll skip zones.  This is classic, not retail.  The only zones you can skip are the other level 1-10 zones.  Everyone has to go to every zone.  There are too many gaps in quests unless you grind out 2-3 levels at a time.  In classic you literally have to go to every single zone to get to 60.
---
This is the most insane thing I've read in weeks.
---
why is everyone assuming there won't already be people farming on the other layers? all of this "ruining the economy" shit makes no sense if you think about it for 30 seconds.
---
Doesn’t make what I said any less true - the truth of the matter is that I WANT to play Classic wow; I really do - but it’s hard when critical issues such as layering, countless hunter/other bugs, and so on; continue to exist
---
Ass burgers?
---
...because when people want a Classic WoW experience, they think of Legion/BFA..
---
Do you know how often large solid chests were spawning?Are they present each reset?
---
Execute has nothing to do with what weapon you're wearing.
---
Thanks for your contribution to the thread
---
World first mc will be within 2 weeks. Even on pservers with just 10k players they were able to do that.
---
That's how Execute works bud.
---
&gt; This would have impacts on the economy. A lot of gaming of the market just before the layers merge. 
---
It would impact the economy, but there's ways around that; multiply the respawn rates of high value mobs/nodes/herbs by the amount of layers. If the respawn of Devilsaurs are 10 minutes, with 4 layers that would accommodate to 40 minutes, and so on. The action houses could still be linked with all other layers. However, this would also be a nice thing to do even with the current layering system.
---
&gt; Also splitting it up that much might make it impossible for friends to play together if they get full. 
---
It would not make it *impossible.* If, for example, Silver #4 have a cap of 3k, queues would be initiated, but your friend could still perfectly join you. With the current system, by phase 1 when layering is suppose to be removed, if the server is still highly populated, queues will take effect anyway.
---
&gt; Finally it kind of misses the point of layers
---
Blizzard have been using layering to fix the problem of overcrowded areas, which is [not what it initially was suppose to do](https://youtu.be/VhR7DYS0MFY?t=116). This is why we've seen these random phasing elements in the beta/tests.  
---
&gt;since each subserver will quickly become a ghost town; forcing devs to collapse layers a bit sooner than they otherwise would 
---
This would not become a problem, because the whole idea is to combat this in the first place by merging layers (or servers if you like) whenever they become a ghost town.
---
Yeah but then you have to be a gnome.
---
Crazy town is over there -&gt;
---
Escape artist and it's not even close. Mages are the most prevelant class, artist shores up your weakness against them. Artist gets you out of more things against more classes than stoneform does. You only get an advantage against warriors, rogues, and ferals for the most part. If you're a good rogue, you don't need stoneform against warriors. If you're rogue v rogue, the openener dictates the matchup most of the time. And there will be like 4 people playing feral across the entire game. So you won't run into many of those.
---
Escape artist gives you play against Shamans, Mages, Warriors, Hunters, Rogues (cripppling).
---
I mean, I'm not really of the No Changes crowd.  But I didn't think the discussion was about what we would *like*, but rather how it was in Vanilla.  Context.
---
I mean... Theoretically your team could Devo plague you when you get MCed. I guess that's something... Otherwise shaman have the worst friendly dispel of all the healers.
---
BFA has already made more revenue than Classic ever will.
---
That "pro tip" doesn't work when the thousands of people starting up all rely on doing that too. Imagine 1000 people starting on a server, 10% do what you suggested, that's 100 people killing boars outside the starting zone. Even grinding to level 5 to start professions and skip the mayhem may be problematic, even 3% is 30 people roaming around for copper and peace bloom.
---
Yeah same,I want to play classic but not gaming pc i could've had one but missed the opportunity!
---
The most i gotten was in Cata as i played a lvl 20 hunter twink for free :c
---
This is again, great advice. 
---
I am also going to get a heftier water bottle for work, as I find I don't drink enough at the moment.
---
Because I actually care about the game; and can’t stand mediocrity from a developer that has the resources to do hetter
---
This is my biggest issue with this debate, to get angry at the idea of an optional setting. They already have the graphics toggle for terrain, aren't people going to snap because some user see grass?
---
I've leveled Alliance 1-30 on every class in beta, so even excluding all the times I leveled characters during Vanilla, I feel competent to opine on this.  
---
But personal anecdotes aside about things we did in 2005 (or in the last few months), let's look at the numbers.  There are ~35 quests in Westfall, and excluding the L44 "Sweet Amber" quest line and the L28 "Legend of Stalvan" quest line, the remaining quests provide a total of 28,280 xp.  At L12 (common time to start Westfall), you need 10,100 xp to hit level 13.  
---
Here are the xp values for 13-20: 11,400; 12,900; 14,400; 16,000; 17,700; 19,400; 21,300; 23,200.  
---
Assuming you started at L12, that 28,280 xp would get you about 7,000 xp into L14.  Recall that Westfall quests range in level from 9 (Furlbrow's Deed) to 20 (The Coastal Menace).  You naturally pick up xp while completing those quests, which for mobs ranging L10 to L20, will be between 95 and 145 xp per mob.  To get to L16, you'll need to have killed approximately 150-180 mobs along the way.  (You'll also have needed to travel to Stormwind and Redridge, but we'll conveniently pretend that's not the case).  And this assumes you were finishing L18+ quests while level 15 or below.  Not exactly a safe assumption, and certainly not the optimal way to play (and therefore irrelevant when we're talking about who has better questing hubs).
---
There are also ~35 quests in Redridge, ranging from L14 to L27, and half of them cannot be accepted until L15 at the earliest.  The last 10-15 require L18+ just to accept, and a number of them require you to grab a group (and ping pong between zones, e.g., the Theocritus quests, Dry Times, etc.).  If you start at L16, you can probably accept nearly all of the quests in Redridge by the time you complete the ones you can accept.  Still, assuming you complete the quests at a roughly level-appropriate time, you'll receive 46,840 xp from completing every last quest.  (And, again, this requires that you travel between the various Human starting zones).  That would put you about 15,000/19,400 xp into L18 from quest xp.  This is obviously impossible because 11,400 of this xp comes from quests that are not even obtainable until L19+.  It also requires that you handle quests in excess of L25 (including elite quests), at L20 and below.  But let's still assume that you can pull this off and pick up xp from 200 mobs along the way.  That would put you around L20.  
---
That leads us to Duskwood, which has quests ranging from 20 to 35 (excluding L40+ quests).  About half of these can be accepted before L22.  More than half are L25 and above quests.  Again, completing every single one of these quests nets you 80,000+ xp.  That's enough to get you from L20 well into L23 before mob xp.  (Assuming you can reliably complete L35 quests at L25 and below).  That's not a safe assumption and it would be a truly awful way to play (and is impossible or nearly impossible to do solo).  And, AGAIN, completing those quests would require you to travel to other zones.  
---
Hopefully you can tell from the above that's it's not at all practical to just park yourself in Westfall/Redridge/Duskwood and complete the zones in one go (and it's not feasible without grinding).  You have to ping pong between them just to complete the quests within the zones, and to stay at a level that allows you to play smoothly, you'll need to either group up (which will require more mob grinding due to the xp split) and/or grind extra mobs solo.  Or you can rely on a full bar of rested xp every time you play (and still grind a lot).  In any event, it's not something I would recommend to anyone over weaving in Loch Modan or Darkshore and jumping back and forth between Duskwood and Wetlands.

“hOw DiD i CrIt 594?!”
---
Exactly, and here I am sharing my feedback/experience with it in hopes of a better final outcome.
---
This is amazing, this thread deserves so much more credit. Out of curiosity, how did you get into the Emeral Dream back then?
---
&gt; Saying you wouldn't play this game because someone else sees your face with more pixels is literally insane to me.
---
But that's not "your face with more pixels", it's *a different face*.
---
Each reset there was a chest in armory, sometimes it was locked and you needed to LP it. You can't open it in combat and there are always 1-3 enemies next to it. On lvl 40 I was pulling aggro when I try to open it.
---
Now I'm about to open up a can of shame ass. How dare you shame a shamer for just trying to shame the shamers. Shame on you you shame-hole.
---
I wonder if it has something to do with this being a beta that is capped at 40.
---
I mean I know there is soooo much to do at level 40, what with all the end game.
---
There’s no way people have just capped level and decided, “hmm, there’s nothing to do now”
---
So two contradictory answers from two different mods, great.

What if I want to make a thread for in-depth discussion of how Classic WoW’s design philosophy is amazingly superior to current retail? Is that talking about Classic or talking about retail?
---
Ghost towns past starting zones in a closed beta and level caps during stress tests, all with toons that will be gone in a few weeks? Must be a conspiracy.
---
Hi Gimlir! We were guild mates in Recognize! I played a human warrior named Delin but was mostly a backup Raider since I unfortunately was too young to stay up for the entire raid duration :(. Im cousin's with Mankind, a Dwarf pally who was also in the guild. Still friends with Kokiri, Swenla, and their brothers if you remember them from Recognize.
---
You have to do the Level 10 quest in your starting area.
---
Right but lets say I'm currently leading the race and I just hit 20 in southern Darkshore. The next person is lvl 18 and in Redridge. (I think this is as iirc Joana on his vanilla world record run has gotten a 2 level lead already by level 20). If I go to Ashenvale and do first third of the zone or so and get to 22 or so before going over to Duskwood, I still won't face enough competition to significantly slow me down even if all of those 18s from Redridge come, there will only be a handful of them at most.
---
I guess you're right if you're talking about a level 14/15 transition from Darkshore to LM or something but by level 20, the leader should be far enough ahead that even if they have to "backtrack" (so to speak) it won't mess with them too much.
---
&gt; pallies are objectively better than shamans for raiding
---
That's an odd perspective.  Chain heal with +Healing is so incredibly strong, you can downrank to r1 and still put out the best raidheals in the game.  They still have lots of buffs from totems, I could see some guilds looking to bring 8 shamans just for that.
---
Pallies are good too, but I know less about them since I play horde... I just think you may be undervaluing shammies.
---
Getting stomped by a female gnome with purple hair then having her laugh at you afterwards is pretty demoralizing.  If I was an alliance melee class I'd go gnome.
---
Why did he leave?
---
That's all well and good, until someone cannot play Classic WoW at all because the 1.12 client has a 10+ year old hardware compatibility bug in it that has since been fixed.    
---
People want the Classic WoW game, nobody is scrapping after a graphics glitch, sound distortion, or an unreliable network stack to "reproduce the accurate experience." That's just silly.   
---
They've gone above and beyond to get WoW Classic as accurate as possible. The bugs are unfortunate but I have confidence they're working on them and will continue to do so.

[EU] [Alliance] [PVP/PVE]
---
Hi! Seeking players to level to 60 and do dungeons.
---
New-ish player to Classic but highly motivated to learn. I plan on playing a lot starting day one. I'll be rolling a Paladin on a PVP server but am open to playing on a PVE as well.
---
If you're interested please PM me or contact me on Discord: Akira#9699
---
no it isnt...
---
Try osrs
---
Right, and the default position too often is to simply side with the other moderator.  I've seen way too many capricious moderator actions to be dissuaded from this opinion.  I'm not saying it's *always* the case, and I'm not saying you guys are terrible or something.  But the default inclination is generally to justify the prior moderator's actions.
---
For example, there could be two posts that could both be conceivably removed based on the sub's rules.  One will go untouched.  The other will be removed.  This is already capricious.  But then if the removed post is appealed, the reviewing moderator will uphold the removal.  Now you've doubled down on the capriciousness.
---
Curse of tongues always makes me laugh(cry) trying to mount it’s like 5 seconds
---
&gt;Personally I liked the way old Blizzard did things: release it when it's ready.
---
What planet do you live on?  They always released the game with bugs.
---
bummer, thanks for the response
---
Croc pot recipes and veggies boys. Get that water going and oh boy. Your gaming for 18 hours straight lol.
---
yh nuts as hell
---
Delightful news!
---
The main difference is that 1 pally can buff the entire raid while 1 shaman can only buff their group.  I think there's a reason outside of some of the earliest raiding world firsts, most of the world firsts were from alliance.  Shamans are good, but pallies are better.
---
Your logic: Gaming company wants their game to fail to make other game look good and make investors happy. I wonder if Blizzard employees read posts like this and have a good laugh in the break room.
---
Doesn’t solve the issues of merging. Each of those builds its own community and economy which is then fractured upon merging. At least with layering your economy and community will be the same the whole time before and after merger.
---
That’s how I feel. I remember how big the world felt when I first started because I didn’t know where anything was and the size of the game was almost intimidating. I feel like switching would bring back that same feeling of awe and wonder.
---
It’s supposed to be catchup gear along with the other new dungeon loot from 1..9/1.10 so that players can get into AQ without waiting months for MC gear
---
I'm not talking about STV being empty, people are saying that the layering even turns Westfall and Ironforge into ghost towns.
---
Does this include quests where you have to pick up x number of items across an area?
---
I.e. looting miner's gear in the kobold mine in loch modan; there are multiple spawns in the mine and you need to collect 4 of them - if they respawn almost instantly, can you just stand by one spawn and click it 4 times?
---
Are you sure?  Last thing I heard from streamers was that the game is already dying.  That's right, before it even came out they are talking about how low the pop is and how it's dying.
---
r/cutenoobs should get a WoW version :p
---
&gt; Except that if you report someone here, you might get your self banned and the guy you reported did not get banned. 
---
We don't know who reports what, reports are completely anonymous unless they're made by a moderator. It looks like [this](http://prntscr.com/o61wf1). When we look at a report we look at the whole conversation and action however appropriate.  When it comes to Rule 2 we don't care who started it, because that leads to a cycle of toxicity and also indicates to people that it's okay to be disrespectful as long as you feel it's appropriate, and we will action on each comment that crossed the line. Best advice is if someone is disrespectful report it, block them, and leave the conversation.
---
However, you've never been banned according to our logs, so this all smells a bit like drama-stirring bullshit - or ban evasion. 
---
&gt; Also you wont get a reply to your ban appeal.
---
We've recently updated to New Modmail, which means that modmails are less likely to get buried under an abundance of messages, for a while we've had a period of very poor responsiveness until we moved over, but since the changeover I don't think any mail has gone completely unanswered. We won't continue a conversation endlessly, but your first mail will always get answered. 
---
The difference being is that Old Modmail works like Reddit does when browsing by New. New posts go to the top, replies bump it back to the top, and everything filters down. This means that if one of us didn't feel it was appropriate for us to answer a mail (for which there are a lot of legitimate reasons, such as concerns about bias, having no opinion either way, or not understanding what is going on, etc) it would eventually get buried. New Modmail prevents this by archiving things as they get answered, meaning we typically have no more than around 15 Modmail needing answering when we answer them on average about every 2 hours. 
---
TL;DR: We've worked to fix the slow responses. I think we're doing pretty alright now.
---
Owl is the best leveling pet anyway. And Darkshore is the best leveling zone after the starting ones. Your friends should be coming to you.
---
ayyu I envy the one who will life tap 7/24.
---
So yes...with a huge astrix. 1-59 are gonna be a blast, and at 60 you can farm your pre-raid faster than anybody else simply because you can form groups the fastest and make sure nobody else is rolling on your tanking drops. The raid situation is where you run into serious trouble. There more wanna-be raid tanks than slots for them, so you're not going to get a slot in a good guild regularly clearing content. In addition to tanking the raids most guild tanks are expected to be on often to help tank 5mans, attunements, quests, all that good stuff. This responsibility drops over time as the guild stabilizes, but in the earliest MC/BWL phases it'll be a big time sink.
---
So there's 2 ways you're going to gear up as a casual then. First, you can tank PuG raids. This gets much easier once ZG and AQ20 come out, since you have 3 different places to start farming gear from. It's hard to progress into BWL and beyond as a PuG, but you can do quite well in MC, ZG, and AQ20. 
---
Second, find a guild who needs an OT or maybe even MT for their alt-runs. This is ideal since these groups are usually composed of good players who know each other. You'll never get TF this way, but you can rack up some Might and maybe even Wrath. But realistically, you're gonna be the PuG tank guy.
---
As for Engi, year it's pretty awesome for a tank. Mining is strong since you can farm your own arcanite (you'll need a shitton). And engineering is great for some desperately needed utility while soloing, and can help boost your threat while tanking. The shield is good for threat, not so good for tanking, it's a tool you will want to use situationally, but a strong tool to have access to. Frankly I think the various threat-building tools are stronger pushes into Engineering for a warrior than the shield, but nothing wrong with the shield.
---
I agree with the 60/40 thing at the start. Then all the "Hordies" who only play blood elves (like half of the horde) will get annoyed by the hunched backs and reroll alliance or go back to 8.2.
---
ideally i want to rep farm to get the Rams but i could always return at a later level to grind them
---
This is pure hysteria. You think the few handfuls of people who are going to race to 60 are going to become some WoW Mafia and disrupt the economy for years to come? God damn, get a grip.
---
What are they going to do, farm too many Shadowfangs? Single-handedly farm the game's entire thorium supply until it stops respawning and have monopoly on it? 
---
People had hacks and trainers and gold generators in vanilla WoW but the game chugged along fine. This sort of ludicrous attitude towards a small minority of people is what breeds conspiracy theories, give your head a shake friend. Streamers pose a much bigger problem than this to-be mafia because they have the power of many vs. one - and even Streamers won't "wreck the economy for the remainder of the game's life."
---
Go fucking pound sand dude.  Seriously, why do you have to talk crap on Blizzard all the time?  The game is going to be fine.
---
Lost two women I wanted to spend the rest of my life with because of WoW.
---
Failed in two university graduations because of WoW.
---
Had a thrill while doing so.
---
Although I want to tell my younger self "be the best version of me",
---
I'm surpisingly willing to embrace the bitter sweetness of this ERA again..
---
Not only that, but as the poster noted, I'm as hyped as I never was ever.
---
You don't need pre-bis to clear MC. You dont even need 40 60s. I guarentee there will be MC groups the first week. I'm not sure they'll get Rag but they'll get enough gear/other gmates to 60 that a second week kill is very possible.
---
Typically we do, sometimes threads in their own right can be perfectly innocent but inspiring that toxicity. If the thread contains more hateful comments than non-hateful comments, typically the thread will get removed.
---
You're not looking at the big picture. If Classic surpasses retail then they would lose money in the long run because more players would switch and they'd sell less expansions.
---
What about for healing PvP.
---
feral 10
---
warrior 6
---
rogue 3.
---
i suppose hunter is around 8 but 1 button spam mages n locks look like 1
---
Personally I also hate getting ganked and spending time trying to run away from a corpse camper seems so inefficient. 
---
My plan with WoW is if I'm leveling alone and get ganked more than once I'll switch to my Alt. I plan on having at least 2 60's eventually so I might be frustraited I'm not on my main but that's my choice. I can either be ineffecient on my main trying to avoid getting ganked. Or I can just log into a diff char and hope for better luck. The chances both your characters in two zones are both getting corpse camped is slim. 
---
Most people will gank you while they run by and then just go about their day. Honestly lots of people are busy and would rather get to their destination than deal with you.
---
Gurl, do you even hellfire?

---
Lol this is as good as people bragging about execute crits.
---
Not sure about 1.12 but at launch execute didn’t scale with AP. So the only thing that could give you more execute damage over anyone else was the talent reducing rage cost, therefore increasing the extra rage available for execute.
---
I'd rather have fucking queues than this garbage.
---
BWL probably wont be out for at *least* 2 months post launch
---
Yep, we need more REEE and Layering bitching.
---
Did the Armchair Developer conference let out early today?
---
Rets bring nothing holy paladins don’t tho
---
I will be tanking as a casual, ~5-10hrs per week. Just realize that at 60 you will mostly be tanking dungeons, not raids. This was what I went through during vanilla’s time too, as I was just starting a career then and could not sit up for hours on a work night to do raids. Tanked a lot of 5- and 10-mans, and was the tank for ‘B-team’  on easier raids like ZG or already-clearer early raids. I still had a blast though. This time around my intention/goal is to obtain and upgrade the Valor/Heroism set. As a casual, this will take some time. I’ll see where things go if/when I finally cross that bridge.
---
Whispers you *"hello friend top gold best price 10USD per 100g join us now at site.com!!* in broken English
---
Anyone could do the quest and any number of players could turn it in within a short window (10 hours I think) of the first player turning it in.
---
Execute's maximum naked damage at Rank 1 is 380. Therefore it can crit up to 760 damage with no gear added stats.    
---
594 is completely normal therefore. You just didn't full up the rage bar enough.
---
The beta servers are empty, its probably not even layering.
---
I had a total blast in the classic wow beta! Such a nostalgia trip!
---
Got my rogue to level 15, and I had so much fun that I decided to main a rogue in classic. 
---
I got that first screenshot by going to an asmongold event because I couldn't find a tank for the deadmines. It was actually a lot of fun, and it reminded me of the legion prepatch event with the invasions all over Azeroth. Anyway, I don't know if layering bugged out or something, but I was lagging like hell when everyone else vanished and it was just me with the dragon. Super cool screenshot though, I made it into my desktop wallpaper.
---
Here are some more I got

BFA set the record for day 1 sales for a WoW expansion. In Legion the player base is rumored to have gotten back up to around 10mil.
---
According to that graph it ended 2005 with about 6 million players. That's not dead in today's standards.
---
As a comparison, Dota 2, the most played game on Steam, tends to have about 10 million monthly active players.
---
Gentleman and...gentleman, this is what a peak comment looks like
---
Horde is so far and away better at PvP in Classic that its not remotely close. Rose tinted goggles for Pally apologists always amuse me
---
Buy the regular mount P1 for sure. You'll want to have it anyways for pvp, and particularly as a warlock it opens up the option for you to partially do the dreadsteed quest then sell DM runs for cash to other warlocks.
---
&gt;  think Blizzard's worst nightmare is Classic becoming a huge hit
---
Oh noes, free money, what will they do now? What a nightmare!
---
Hey, facts are not allowed on this subreddit so could you please delete this
---
We have no submitted posts from you, on this account. 
---
Regardless, on EVERY removal comment and message, we say please message the mods if you believe there was an error. We make mistakes! Please reach out if you think there was one.
---
Mind blown.
---
That would make a whole lot of sense
---
Same as a pally 95% of the time.
---
The other mod seems to believe that merely mentioning retail is enough to warrant removal rather than what the post’s “focus” is so which is it?
---
For each layer with a black lotus, there will be a layer worth of people wanting that black lotus. It's not like they will be uncontested.
---
Oh sorry, I misread. It's been a long day for me - I thought you said "Have the mods decided to ban discussion of WoW that is critical of retail and/or the demographic that plays it?", hence my very different response. 
---
It's a case by case thing, if it's a thinly veiled post about Modern masquerading as a post about Classic, it'll get removed. If it's actually about Classic and references Modern that's fine.
---
Well you are mentioning warrior's threats, but only mention Shadow Priests. Well everybody who played Vanilla knows Frost mages were just as big of a pain for Warrior's as SP's. It even made warrior's run frost resistance gear.
---
Think how overcrowded the Forsaken start will be.  Almost every mage and priest will be undead, and so many rogues and warlocks.  Undead mage and rogue are very popular.  
---
If you care about playing the first day and week you could be hours ahead on a troll.
---
I only say this so people won't be disappointed in three months, but WoW definitely is not the hottest game right now. The Twitch numbers don't necessarily reflect interest to play. A lot of it novelty and exclusivity.
---
We'll see. Maybe it will blow up in a crazy way. But it's better to have tempered expectations and be surprised than to have high hopes and get disappointed.
---
Can’t expect a populated server but every mob to kill as well. Which is it do you people want? You’ll get over it and it’ll pass. Not everyone is leveling the same pace, with the same route, with the same skill, with the same knowledge. I personally level with no guides whatsoever, just use my memory and occasionally look up some things on the DB to make sure I’m not missing any of those quests that start in a city. Once you get to level 30 it starts to really break apart. You notice it more when you get to the 20s also. 
---
Besides, do you want to meet people? This is how, you’ll be saying to urself fuck it I’ll group for any kill quest and maybe meet some cool people to continue leveling with, maybe even go to higher level mobs to grind in weird areas. I’ve done launch servers 3 times now, not once did I ever say ok this is just completely out of hand. I had the occasional wtf I can’t tag anything moments, but that’s part of the “rush”. It’s really not as bad as people are saying.
---
&gt; I would absolutely hate the playerbase if I worked on games so I have a lot of sympathy for those guys.
---
As a developer, I have grown to hate almost all playerbases for one reason or another lol.  If I worked in games, I probably wouldn't frequent any subreddits or communities.
---
Who cares, Blizz can always merge later.
---
If Classic becomes more popular than retail they would actually lose money in the long run because more players would switch and they'd sell less expansions. Blizzard knows this. They can't let it happen.
---
I agree, I favor the alliance, cause I'm a chill dude in my "old" age. Horde mentality has always been pretty douchey. I defiantly choose horde when I was 19 because I wanted to eat people as a zombie.
---
More subs means more money for them. I don't think shareholders give a flying fuck which version of the game you play as long as they are getting your $15 every month.
---
It's cute that you think the .1% of private server players leaving will make the game dead, but youo can believe whatever you want to believe.
---
The fact that you're actually smiling at the possibility of the game being dead shows how terrible your intentions are. You don't give a shit about Vanilla. You just want everything catered to you. Bye, Felicia.
---
But what if they sold a digital versions for real fans to buy. It could come with cool desktop images, classic wow music soundtrack, and in game pets. All for a small fee. They could call them microtransactions!
---

---

---
You're not entitled to your opinion, you're entitled to your informed opinion. Nobody is entitled to be ignorant.
---
Oh I play casually from time to time, it's always a fun chill game, that and wow was my life during my early teens lol
---
I don’t care who’s life gets ruined. GIB CLASSIC
---
I got all excited there for a moment... but nope... I was from Shadowsong EU :D
---
a couple good reasons is they have an actual resurrect with no cooldown.  They have divine intervention to save a failed pull, if someone else has a res spell or jumper cables.  The buffs blessing of salvation and blessing of wisdom can speed up dungeons and group questing more than druids.  They can heal and do well at healing for raids.  
---
As prot, they can tank anything up to molten core or onyxia.  They have some good aoe grinding if you want to twink them out and it is probably the best farm spec, maybe some righteous orbs or SM armory.  Again, salvation and DI are really good for group or duo content.
---
Rets real place is PVP and they can wreck some absolute face with PVP gear.  They will put out a lot more damage than druids, even though they can't flag carry the same as they do.  I think a holy specced paladin would out survive a feral resto druid for flag spinning in AB or AV, but would be skill dependent on both sides.
---
Again, please show me where that is said.
---
Bug 48- Intimidation is like a Raptor Strike, it's on-next-swing for your pet's attacks. But I can't remember if the pet is supposed to hold onto the Intimidate until it finally connects an attack or a miss or dodge would just eat the skill and you'd be boned for a minute. I do not have official documentation for its implementation in Vanilla, though.
---
Meanwhile on Medivh we had Ally + Horde working together with the Tanaris cross-faction AH funneling supplies (from Ally to Horde since server pop was 3 ally for every 1  horde roughly) and between Ascent (Horde top guild) and The Transcendent (Ally top guild) and we got world first gate opening because of it lol.
---
Check out some mage pvp videos, [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebYNoVS9T2kA)
---
&gt; Except it doesn't provide more dps. It provides more burst potential for sure but your rage generation will suffer tremendously on long fights. It's only somewhat viable for Alliance because they don't have Windfury, what makes Windfury good you ask? It provides a lot of rage from the extra hit.
---
Except that it does provide more DPS. It can, and does, hit much harder than hamstring for a similar rage cost (unless you have the pvp gloves) and a 1 second cast time. Again, it is only worth using when you have a 2 hander, when you are above 40 rage, and when Bloodthrist/Whirlwind are on cooldown. Everyone knows why windfury is good and generates rage. Windfury can also proc off of a slam so not sure what your point is here.
---
&gt; It's close to impossible to time Slam right after an auto attack perfectly. You will lose about 0.1-0.2 seconds and then you also factor in the delay while you're casting Slam + your inability to move. And like many people know, the worst part is how your swing timer is reset after the cast.
---
It's not that hard to time right. Even if you have a few 1/10th's of a second delay, a swing timer of 1.2 with a 2 hander is better than a 3.4-3.8 swing timer for an auto attack *when you have the rage to spare*.  
---
&gt; I feel people tend to forget why Warriors are such monsters in PvE, why they scale so well, so let's put it out here for all to see. Better gear = more hit and crit.
---
&gt; More white hit = more rage.
---
&gt; More white crits = even more rage.
---
&gt; Auto attacks is the main source of your damage and rage, and any loss from this source will cripple the your overall output.
---
Nobody forgets this.
---
those are free, is that even fair to count them?
---
He clarified, I retract this comment.
---
Which I hate honestly, catch up gear just ruins the game on so many levels. Look at retail today, you can't even make it between expansion before you're gear is absolute, and every patch has catch up mechanics.
---
Just like I feel no game should last 15 years and should instead be whole new games as squeals. If you game is so robust that it requires catch-up mechanics in order to appealed to new players, then just throw in the fucking towel and make another game. Why one games has live forever is beyond me, you basically have butcher/remove/nerf previous content in order to do so. The whole practice astonishes me.
---
Or quite possibly, the OP dumped a near-max rage execute that was mitigated by armor (20% off the top)...
---
&gt;Against a "premade warrior" can they do anything?
---
You can slow them down, that's pretty much it. Against a warrior that out gears and out-skills you that has a priest attached to them there's not much any one solo class can do.
---
Also alternatively you can look at Warlocks, they have a bit worse aoe capabilities but from what I can tell do better 1v1, especially with the Soul Link build.
---
Very cool stuff. I'm a huge lore nerd and tend to breaks here and there. I remember a guild that would let me tag along to see the story of the raid play out. Alot of good people still out there!
---
Developer for a small SaaS startup company.  One of the first devs on, been here almost 5 years now.  In the beginning this was so bad, but thankfully upper management has gotten better about not giving specific dates.
---
Tell those people to leave feedback about how they didn’t like it.
---
The point of the last test was to test different layering amounts each realm had different size layers. They wanted feedback on it as well.
---
I played on realm 3, I also provided feedback about what I did and didn’t like. If blizzard ends up rolling with realm 3 type layers. All that means is that people didn’t speak up enough about it.
---
Everything i encountered so far isn‘t a big deal ... 
---
there are still a few things that are definitely a game changing experience... leeway, the Hunter pet bugs and layering are the major issues
---
There are ton of solutions already, that is just an outright error. However, the issue lies in the work force not unionizing, company morals being utterly bankrupt once you reach a certain monetary threshold - likely due to management being to far distanced from the workforce and enough workers that its easy to discard someone rather than proper worker treatment.
---
I agree.  I am spoiled by the new models and graphics.  I would like to see it as an option that can be toggled.
---
 Why has this sub become so toxic and hostile? Comments like this make this just make the quality of the sub go down every day
---
It used to be the final talent in TBC; Crusader Strike wasn't in vanilla.
---
Ok but a wisp mining is the best thing I've seen in a while
---
That's not correct, you can get it from the respective trainers in the other starting zones.
---
Wait that doesn't even count the dragon fight in Moonglade right?

Dude, what the shit.

those tables are an abomination.
---
Yes but no
---
I just get up before sunrise and play before work.  Then I play in the afternoon into the evening after work.  I get the full spectrum of night, sunrise, morning, afternoon and evening effects.  All I'm missing out on is high noon showdowns in STV.
---
There is no beta realm 3
---
Most people think they put layering to an aggresive mode on the beta realms to get data about the different zone transitions.
---
Kill him, he has no enchants, wrong shoulders, no fishing hat etc
---
The level of unreasonable negativity, nonconstructive critique, and paranoia is absolutely unreal lately. The crazies are making other crazies more crazy somehow.
---
And where are you getting this info? 
---
4 months of sub = 1 xpac money.
---
With all the money from players coming back to classic the money from subs will exceed the loss from sales.
---
Where am i get this numbers? out of my ass like you.
---
Not really. SoC was changed when those abilities made it into the game so you have zero clue on how it would impact anything.
---
We're only getting a handful of servers for each region. There will be hardcore guilds on all of them.
---
Nice, ty for info.
---
Cringy quote. Just don't be such a dick. No need to feel so attacked if someone reacts to your comment.
---
This is why it makes me laugh whenever people who play modern wow assume vanilla was this insane super hard core game that was impossible for casuals to play
---
Classic is based on the BfA client, not the Legion client.
---
Get on your 19 DK twink and kill him.

Fear has diminished returns? I feel like when i fear, sometimes it'll break early, but i notice consecutive fears lasting a long time. Im on pservers though, so it's not "real" numbers.

What addon for autoshot?

---
You lost me there, not sure under which stone you are living or what kind of weird political view you have on things. But to label learning a foreign language as "a waste of their time" is...beyond me.
---
There’s going to be layering. So don’t play. 
---
also - see you August 26th.
---
Before phase 2 is the only definite end date. But ideally 2 weeks is what they've said. 
---
I don't think they can really say definite dates, because it all depends on server populations (i.e. layering will stay longer on high pop servers vs low pop servers) and things they haven't decided on like what point is it better to allow queues vs layers, etc.
---
If they come out with a definite "this date" or "this population" that's all subject to change. So, not until they are sure what dates/values/population, we won't hear anything.
---
Except Macabre on Mannoroth. They had the first scepter in the world. And if it weren't for their own shitty Alliance not finishing their War Effort in time, we would have had world's first gate opening too.
---
WoW was just short of 8 million players in vanilla, that's pretty huge
---
(wow peaked in popularity during wrath js)
---
as a colour blind person it took me a long ass time to realize there were horde flight paths shown.
---
Troll for PVE and Undead for PVP
---
Holy shit, I can't believe this actually worked!  I definitely remember the names Delin, Kokiri, and Mankind.  Recognize is not at all what I thought the guild name was (I guess I've smoked too much weed in the years since).  I was too young to stay up for the whole raid durations back then as well, but I did it anyway.  I'd put on some headphones and put a blanket over the bottom of the door so no light could leak through and that'd usually buy me a couple of extra hours to finish the end of the raid.  I've been watching a lot of the WoW Classic beta streams on Twitch and it's got me so pumped to play this game again.  I've got a couple of real life friends I'm hoping will come back for Classic, but I was also hoping to reconnect with some old guild mates.  Mission success.  Are you guys planning on playing classic?
---
Why do dps gear faster than a tank?
---
You report them the old fashioned way. With payback.
---
Really hope so, i'm planning on playing hunter for the release and from what i'm seeing right now it might end up being a rogue (':
---
On Azgalor, there was a horde guild that did almost the same thing (they switched names a lot but I think at the time it was Zenith, the leader/opener's name was Stormheart I think, tauren warrior). But instead of holding the event hostage for gold, they demanded that everyone leave the zone so that nobody but their guild got the rep when the gates opened. So instead they left and were raiding or something. Some horde member got in touch with the top Alliance guild and literally formed a coalition between Horde and Alliance to go kill Eranikus and get the last part done for Brethren so they could open. 
---
Zenith showed up and it was a mad house, there were probably over 200 people fighting, and it was impossible to tell who the friendly horde were from the Zenith horde except for clan tag name. Stormheart wound up opening the gates shortly after because they knew they couldn't prevent Brethren from finishing the quest with the additional help of the horde friendlies, and shortly after the event began. 
---
I'll never forget somebody wrote and recorded an awful song about the whole thing and the final line was "Zenith loves the penith" and to 14 year old me I thought that shit was hilarious.
---
I really hope they make an rp-pvp server. I have never RPd and probably never will, but really want to play an alt to just enjoy the atmosphere and immersion and life other players bring to the world.
---
Sidenote, there is/was addon(s) that could portay to others (respectfully) that I do not intend to RP but will happily play along?
---
Did you check to see if The Glowing Fruit quests were available in beta?
---
It really wasn't that big of a deal. Several other guilds were close to the scepter and stopped because of Imperial Order's progress. They were ready to finish and open the gates if this kept on. 
---
It was entertaining though. 
---
And then the bastards opened the gate in the middle of the day. Logged in and everyone's in Silithus farming those huge elites.
---
So what happens when after the first few days there are still tons of people causing all of the issues that layering was solving in the first few days? The issues that layering solves arent time sensitive to just a couple days... it is sensitive to the bottleneck of players that are going to try out Classic WoW. Probably it will thin down a ton at lvl20ish
---
I keep seeing games named and relising they are old to some people, man we are getting old. Feels like yesterday 19 years ago playing diablo 2 online.
---
Cutting Edge (BOD - also 7/8M Uldir) 2 raid day/wk Retail player w/ vanilla exp looking to switch to classic. LF semi-hc 2 day guild that realistically expects to be within top ~3ish of 2day guilds on their server. Fine with 6:30-10CST M/W/Th (have Tuesday commitments) Would participate in occasional premade pvp, help others gear preraid bis, etc.
---
Looking to play Fury (Fine with OT and like tanking 5 mans) but I’d also be fine rolling rogue if the guild expects plenty of wars.
---
aRe NuMbErS oFf?
---
Activision-Blizzard wouldn’t release the game with hunters being completely broken, w-would they? 👀
---
Then the term "dead" in this context has lost all meaning in 2019. A game with hundreds of thousands to millions of active subs being "dead" is absurd. There are games that are several magnitudes more niche than that are perfectly playable. Wow may have not been the most popular game in 2005, but calling it dead bh any standard is just flat out stupid.
---
Yes it does. That's step #7.
---
It just doesn’t make sense that you are an experienced PvP player but also too dumb to figure out the answer to your question since it requires minimal research.
---
I'm having trouble finding Northrend
---
Well also if you duel a rogue has a human lock you can see stealth quite far with felhunter + perception. It's cheesy, but it's there. May bring you some smiles to BM some rogues in duels.
---
**&lt; Middle Management &gt;** Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild, NA-PVP, Alliance 
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council w/ Loot List - The Loot Council is comprised of the Officers and Class Leads with a monthly update of priority based on individual contribution and gear priority requests submitted by each member. 
---
**Raid Times:** Plan is to Raid Tuesday and Thursday with Sunday or Monday as our clean up date. Raids will begin at 9:00 PM EST and last roughly 4 hours.
---
**Who We Are:** We are a group of old Vanilla Raiders who kept in touch and have played on and off over the years. We are not super tryhard and we don't expect you to be, most of our members are late 20's to early 40's and have lives that will take prescience. Our experience ranges from MC / BWL to others who cleared Naxx.  Our goal is to have a strong core going into release and begin raiding by October. 
---
**Class Needs:** Currently open to all classes
---
**Benefits:** 
---
*Discord 
---
*Website 
---
*401k Match Program 
---
*Vision &amp; Dental
---
If I play Alliance, my rogue is gonna be Gnome.
---
&gt; This is pure hysteria. You think the few handfuls of people who are going to race to 60 are going to become some WoW Mafia and disrupt the economy for years to come? God damn, get a grip.
---
Uh... yes? Of course it will happen. You severely underestimate the kinds of players who are willing to spend 12 hours a day minmaxing everything they can. If you think everyone will play fair, you're extremely naive. Even on the beta, people have already been abusing the shit out of layering.
---
More importantly, I don't really give a shit what you think will happen, because it doesn't matter. Layering should not be in vanilla for a single second. It's completely antithetical to the whole fucking purpose of classic wow.
---
Any raiding guild could have been working on the scepter at the same time. Several servers had multiple gong ringers.
---
**&lt;Thralls Deep&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Raid times:** 8pm Formation, 830 First pull - 1130pm EST Wednesdays/Thursdays. 3 Hour raids max
---
**About:** Thralls Deep has a veteran group of leaders who have cleared most, if not all content in vanilla from private servers. We plan on raiding, ranking and hosting guild events throughout the life of Classic! We are looking for players who are looking to rank and have quick, clean and efficient raids.
---
**Recruitment:** We are recruiting everyone and all classes. We are looking for players who want to step up and be at the top of their game.
---
**Loot:** Loot council: rewarding those who are on time, who go above any beyond and have consumables. If you show up early, or on time, have consumables and help the guild as a whole, you will be rewarded.
---
**PvP:** We planning on ranking as well as hosting premades to be the top Horde premade on the server competing with the Alliance.
---
**Info:** If you are interested, feel free to message myself on reddit, or leadership on discord for more information.

Brings back memories
---
One or more of "timerbling seeds" and "timberling sprouts" needs to be done.
---
I read somewhere that you can get the glowing fruit ones when you have those just in your quest log - that does not work, one or both need to be done.
---
I did not have the time during the test to see if 'sprouts' alone unlocks the quests, and I'm not going to be doing 'seeds' cause it's garbage.
---
You could argue warrior is a hybrid, since they can do dps and tank.
---
It keeps 5 mans somewhat relevant in the later patches so they aren’t completely abandoned, and introduces caster gear to help them be on par with melee instead of miles behind for fresh 60s. Like was mentioned above, 0.5 isn’t worth anyone’s time except for casuals trying to catch up. Even tier 0 is almost entirely bad 
---
I feel like you’re angry about the concept instead of looking at the actual implementation. All of the catchup gear is way worse than even 20 man raid gear.
---
Doubtfully.
---
Incoming thread delete!
---
Not shown: round the clock babysitter for a week straight.
---
I can't wait either. Just counting the days, passing time, doing great stuff IRL though, don't get me wrong, but this is one of a very VERY few things I've come to actually expect and long for. I never set any goal or release ever, I don't ever go like "oh in 3 months I'm done with this" or "this day, this comes out" but for Classic, just the character creation is a step I long for cause it makes something to look for earlier than the 27th of August. So yeah, definitely hyped too!
---
&gt; just go do the quest line
---
The quest line took ~800 man hours spanning over multiple raid lockouts. It wasn't that simple. Only top tier guilds and dedicated farmers even had a chance.
---
Welcome home friend
---
You can't just "delay release dates" and expect to maintain high regard with your clientele though.
---
The problem stems from software projects being hard to estimate time/complexity.  If you're estimation is off in the beginning, then so is your timeline - it doesn't matter if you had 100 devs on it, or 5 devs, if it's mis-estimated then the result is crunch time.
---
Gummy played a Troll Rogue on retail btw
---
Conversely, you can tell the players that are raiding at a high level because none of the gear matches.
---
They will need Ony buff to kill MC with blues and greens
---
&gt; The problem is that you guys tend not to like admitting your mistakes. When a user appeals a moderation action, the default response to is to defend and justify.
---
Well, I mean, I did just literally admit we made a mistake. :) We do make them fairly frequently, however if we can justify why we did something of course we will. Just because *you* feel that the action was a mistake it doesn't mean it is. 
---
If you send a modmail saying 'I don't think this ban is fair' or 'This shouldn't be removed' it will typically (not always) be replied to by someone other than the person who immediately made the action. It will always be archived by someone different to the person who answered it. This means a bare minimum of 2 people will be involved in every modmail, and all of us know that if another Moderator wants to overrule a decision one of us made they are absolutely entitled to.
---
You should look into the problems that come from server merges like that, after a community has already taken root.
---
Oh, sorry friend, we were on the subject of 2005. Yes, it was large in the MMO community (which was small back then to begin with) and it was a lot of peoples first MMO, so yes, it was new and exciting to those interested. When BC was announced and the South Park episode, that also helped out, then it just kept climbing and climbing, as most things do if they're doing well.
---
Wow amazing post. Thank you
---
Not a single part of what you just said is correct lol.
---
[A][NA][PVP] - DPS/Off-Tank Warrior, possible flex
---
LF Guild for casual-hardcore raiding 1-2 nights a week. I value maturity, experienced leadership (prefer any Naxx experience), and a fun but similarly experienced/serious culture. 
---
I would ideally like to roll Warrior at launch, but am slightly flexible if the right guild is chalk full of warriors and in strong need of another class that I am interested in. 
---
My career highlights for content as it was current:
---
•	Played a mix of retail and private servers since 2006
---
•	ICC 25H 11/12 as Ret Paladin
---
•	Firelands 10H 7/7 as legendary Rogue, 6th guild on Stormrage-US
---
•	Dragon Soul 10H 8/8, as legendary Rogue, 8th guild on Stormrage-US
---
•	Cutting Edge: Will of the Emperor 
---
•	Arena highest rating 2150 as Warrior
---
•	Pandaria Gold Challenge Modes completed on Warrior and Rogue
---
They actually get PAID 63sil to get it. You roll into SW Cath, and you accept a quest, and dudes like. "Here you go honorbound paladin!" and you gain EXP and some coin.
---
on my druid i soloed the spider boss in LBRS to get my Wildheart boots (I wanted to collect the whole set, I thought it looked so cool). just stealth down to her and then alternate hibernate and starfire. took a while but i got those boots eventually (and a whole lot of silk)!
---
Well if they didn't suspend accounts for having a conversation with someone less people would have alt accounts inflating the numbers. I think i have like 5 active accounts I don't play but a game on once a month.
---
Nah, we would have blown the mage away.  4x warrior charges = dead mage.
---
He's saying the percentage is 8% globally. If you assume an even split between factions then the faction-locked classes are essentially double percentage for their respective faction.
---
I.E. - 2k players on a server, if 8% of them are Paladins, then it follows that 16% of Alliance are Paladins.
---
Don't pretend you speak for us all.
---
Blizzard can make engine enhancements, add achievements and graphical improvements, change the meta for all I care.
---
I want classic for it's primary mechanics and world. The no changes crowd is cancer

I would rather mechanics be based on 1.12 for consistency rather than some mix.
---
You can farm them from the back door of gnomer. Takes literally less than 2m per run and the boss literally only had mcp on loot table. MCP also works as a soft taunt for prot off tanks.
---
Fresh is the most exciting part of WoW. It's why private servers are notorious for always for the next fresh on the horizon. Everybody is on an even playing field so there's the illusion that you have a chance at being one of the best.
---
Shadow priest is extremely strong, but I’m going to be honest, many people play to win the objective and not to have the most kills, but if ur goal is to just roll people with minimal skill, then go shadow priest, they are just not great in groups, especially on horde Bc they’re the only class who can reliably dispel magic. They just suffer a bit from mana issues. Kind of a noob spec so to speak and not particularly impressive by any means if you’re leading kills. 
---
If you want to play a real DPS class for pvp, have access to easy gold farming, constant easy money by just sitting in a city with reagents in ur bags, then go mage. Mage is one of the best classes in the game, and you can farm gold very easily solo, and buy the best bind on equip gear such as belt of the archmage early on, chromatic cape, gloves of spell mastery, mats for ur robe of the archmage, engineering supplies, epic mount etc.  when you get good at mage in vanilla pvp with consumables/engineering trinkets, you can be a killing machine with ways to a  couples ways to get ur mana back up quick unlike other classes. 
---
Just look up some mage pvp videos from vanilla and shadow priest and see which one looks most interesting taking into account the things I’ve said.

Boomkin can be very strong in PvP, feral is weak in PvP until WoTLK.
---
I'm not as hyped as I was for tbc, but I was 19 and no lifeing wow at that point. I will agree with changing class. I'm currently having trouble deciding what to play but I know for sure I'm not playing paladin again! I too want a different experience.
---
its the literal definition of instant gratification vs deferred. would i rather wait for a good game or play a mediocre game immediately.   
---
you spent three years in uni and now you're done being educated? i guess i can only know i tried.  
---
yes that would be the difference between instant gratification and deferred gratification that you said was complex and required acknowledging very important presuppositions(without outlining any of them, and then completely disregarding the statement in the next paragraph??? following it with a strawman of 4 weeks, when we'd already agreed on 2 hour queues for 2 days).  
---
really good arguments by the way i appreciate people who disregard or completely ignore every argument with vague nonsense like "because you're ignoring... some intangible thing i made up"   
---
and then "i don't care" but damned if i'm not going to assert i'm right and align myself with the view that ruins your experience. the way you argue is extremely nonsensical.
---
Ehh.. you can’t really compare battle royals which the games end in 10 min, to an mmo. Completely different player base imo
---
That's fair. It's hard to determine which is which on this sub sometimes.
---
Lol. The two biggest vanilla private servers were shut down in 1 year. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
🙂
---
The Apes guys are also much more especially equipped to test stuff in detail like they are due to their deep knowledge of Vanilla. Big name retail wow streamers all played Vanilla at a time but wont have the knowledge that the Apes guys do. Yet it is still very valuable to have people playing the game as a test, stressing servers, doing normal things just by playing to see if the encounter problems.

I would probably just drop the Thicc Hide entirely. Just finish the Feral Instinct and Primal Fury.

If you're going full tank, you're gonna get DR on Armor anyway.
---
Layering will be in release, maybe with some fixes and blocks around the abusers.  As far as the problem layering aims to solve - it's working in that regard.  A majority of the playerbase doesn't even know wtf layering is, or they are already gonna be used to it coming from retail.  So long as blizzard bans abusers, I really don't see it changing much, or it needing to change much (provided it's out of the game ASAP)

 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore 
---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.  
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday 6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST.

* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time. 
---
Contact/Join us:
---
* Discord: https://discord.gg/tyQpeJ3

* If you have specific/private questions feel free to PM me, or Join the discord and PM any of the officers

It’s because of that chat, isn’t it. Lol

Layering and leeway will fix it all
---
then just give me a link?
---
Ele/Resto hybrid for levelling. Then full Resto in endgame.
---
Did Enhance from BC to Cata and would again, but 2H auto-attack life ain't for me.
---
Untrue! Every one should have a lvl 5 alt named. "\_\_\_Enchant" you mail low value and low vender price greens to, whose dust is obviously better then just vendering.
---
Good point! Thanks!
---
Alliance have a huge advantage in AV. Horde win in AB/WSG/world PVP however.
---
My phone was acting funny after I saw that.

you have to remember the beta is small. And you're seeing alot of drop off in play because they've hit max lvl for the beta. There isn't much to do at 30 or 40 because you were never meant to be stopped there. You were always meant to move forward towards 60 at whatever pace you want. There is plenty to do and it is fine.
---
How do you know exactly what to change about the guide? Are you doing it in beta?

---
There are gonna be a metric fuck ton more people on classic wow launch then any private server launch.  It's hardly even comparable.
---
Blizzard should do time locked progression servers up to certain expansions.

I want even paying attention to the chat.

Originality isn't exactly Blizzard's forte. They're amazing at making games polished and accessible but they're not original at all.

Useless in what? Many of the offspecs work in solo or pvp etc.

The rep grind is what took the most time - and im sure there was more than one guild who had a player that was interested in doing it.
---
The rest of the quest line didnt take that long, its mostly just going between places and killing some boss (or doing stuff like speed clearing BWL).
---
This is WoW. There is no try. There is only the trap.
---
I think people will be so pumped they'll be sure to help you out if you ask a question. You can always add people from here to your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account to help you too, if you feel a little shy about asking in general chats. :D
---
uh wow had commercials with Mr fucking T. i'd call that mainstream.
---
That's so awesome.
---
I am \*so\* eager to find out what names they pick for realms. :D
---
It's because they are stuck at a lower level.  It'd be like if there was 0 endgame at 60.  They are playing on characters that will be gone in a couple months I'm surprised it even got as much playtime as it did.
---
The warlock quest just looks like pure fun so Ill probably wait to do it.
---
Laughs in Shaman
---
In 2005 they were.
---
It’s bc the game isn’t designed to end at 40. What do you expect these beta players to do? Play the shit out of the beta after doing much of the content available at least once and risk feeling burnt out? They’ve put a ton of hours in the beta, trying to max their characters out. Which is what you’d do in the game anyways. Wait until pvp starts up in classic, servers will be wild, people will be grinding gold, devilsaurs, Black lotus, tyrs hand. It’ll all be nuts. Beta is just the test drive man. The streamers are also preparing for classic, and enjoying their summer because I assure you they will go so hard on release you will forget you ever asked this question.
---
&gt; -- Druid: Either pacifist mom gamer bowling pins
---
Why is this so accurate?
---
It was exactly like that in Vanilla. Blizz offered a bunch of free Servertransfers.
---
It's a chance on hit that lasts 4 seconds... so no?  You wont even be OOC before the proc disappears.
---
I thought classic wow was about more than just endgame?
---
some of them I just wont do if they are mobbed
---
don't warrior also get 15% stun resist from talent
---
Aoe farming with reckoning?
---
The rep grind is about 360 of the ~800 man hours.
---
That's 785 man hours, with plenty more for running around and doing prep.
---
But then silvermoon 1 has all of the issues that a server would have without the split servers or layering doesnt it? The exact issues that are trying to be avoided with a solution like this
---
This is the most useless comparison picture I think I've ever seen. Why not just show the same picture twice?
---
Didnt they say only starting zones are going to have layers?
---
That was difficult, too, at least where I was. Everyone was out in the world camping spawns in Elwynn trying to kill stuff 5+ levels higher than them, thirsty for that sweet, sweet XP.
---
Ok you are definitely correct here, i did a little googlin’ and see pure clear urine from too much water is a sign of out-of-wack electrolytes and not good.
---
Thank you.
---
I’ll tone down my water intake I guess, or maybe I need to only drink Brawndo, The Thirst Mutilator!
---
I know of rogues who won’t even attack orc warriors because of the resist lmao
---
Definitely! During leveling (Dungeons) you don't need to spec 100% protection really so you can do both.
---
That’s not true. This private server had 15k people in queue, 12k people in game.
---
Ever seen that Twilight Zone where the gambler dies and goes to heaven? He wins game after game, money piling high, and the angel comes to check on him and all the guy can do is rant about how he’s going insane because there’s no thrill no excitement he just wins and wins and he’s bored. 
---
...and then the angel tells him, “oh no, this isn’t heaven Mr. Gardner...you’re in hell!”
---
Muhuhahahahahahahaha!
---
That’s retail for me. :)
---
RemindMe! 64 day "It's time dude"
---
What if you and your friends pick a server that turns out to be the one a bunch of people or streamers choose to be the most populated one? Do you just re-roll?
---
I'm doing exactly that on a private server. My two characters when I played vanilla were hunter and rogue. I'm either rolling mage or warlock this time but want to level a few to 19 to help sell myself on my main
---
Blue weapons are always worth it early on. You buy a blue sword at 20, it will be better then any green quest reward until easily 35. 
---
Sure you might not get that mount will 43, but you will be 43 while all the copper pinchers are still 37, dying to ogres in Arathi Highlands.
---
Yeah, I've been thinking this as well. No way I get server first cuz I'm not planning on rolling hunter so I'm thinking it makes more sense to have a good enough route to stay ahead of the pack but working professions so I'm more prepared to actually do stuff at 60. I want to bear tank so I'll need the enchanting trinket but ultimately I'll end up with engineering. This is gonna take a lot of money obviously and I plan to level with mining and skinning. Getting ahead to 60 and getting a nice foothold in the devilsaur/thorium market will be really important for me to fund all the other profession work I'll need to do.
---
If a single raid boss makes your utility highly valuable then what class doesn't have amazing utility ? How many groups or raids have you been in where someone said "we sure could use a warlock" ?
---
Warlock CC is some of the least useful for group content, their pets don't do much for dps or tanking, their cleanse spell is one of the weakest in the game, their silence is bad and their party buff is weak. The only good utility they bring is healthstones (which half the party shoves in their bag and forgets about), summon which is mostly just a convenience thing, and soulstones which can actually be useful (but only if you fucked up badly).
---
We might have different definitions of crunch. If you don't think they crunch at google, apple and amazon I don't know what to tell you. Also, a hell of a lot of software is developed at companies that aren't specifically software.
---
I'll give you that my phrasing wasn't perfect. "In my experience, most companies use crunch time to achieve deadlines instead of implementing other solutions." Better?
---
Countdown to classic has episodes with Kevin Jordan, Mark Kern and John Staats.
---
Money doesn't always solve the problem, and neither does hiring more people. You do need to hire the right number of people in the right time frame, by if you're behind already and you just hire up, you'll often lose time getting those people up to speed, and the more people you have on a team the more time is spent just communicating ideas between people n^2 growth problem).
---
Understanding your problem and being able to estimate it early on, and being willing to delay something that isn't finished, are the real ways to avoid crunch. The problem is that that all falls on senior managers who'd rather push the pain down onto their "disposable" work force.
---
My goal is to get ahead of the initial surge of players by logging in VERY QUICKLY (lol) but if that fails I'll probably follow the Fed-Ex Route that was posted here the other day. It's good to have a backup plan! I mean, sure, it's not super streamlined/fast, but neither is sitting in the starting zone sadly flailing at kobolds or wolves or nightsabers for hours in five man groups.

Losing our MT to poachers. Happened to our guild 4 times.

Whats your solution to the inevitable huge mass that tries classic WoW up until lvl 15-20 but then decides its not for them and stops playing. How does Blizzard account for that with its # of servers and ultimate anticipated population when the dust settles?

Current wow is chasing down 7 murlocks.
---
Classic wow is running away from 1.
---
And I have absolutely 0 idea who they are, despite having played this game since launch. I still remember this story from back in those days though.
---
I'm in beta, what would make the game more fun for me would be players actually logging into the damn game.  I'm tired to this giant empty world.
---
Everyone playing beta is treating it like retain: Consume, quit, consume, quit.  No one is living in the world anymore
---
A gaming mouse can be good for that as well.
---
It depends. If you're questing on a group of things that there's lots of competition on, many people will accept group invites to finish that quest faster - do send those out! Early levels are especially hard as you have almost no buffet room for mistakes, so two people makes it a lot faster and safer. 
---
Some people want to solo for the xp (you get less xp per kill in a group, but kill faster). I don't understand that but it's okay.
---
Invite anyone you see questing on the same area. Chances are you have several other quests in common.
---

---
Thank you for this write-up! I've been busting my head between going for moonglow vs siftmend/charge build for PvP (while still be efficient in PvE). As much intriguing the -0.5 sec on your spells is (fish for NG procs with rank1 imp. moonfire or low imp.regrowth for fast spells especially 1 sec roots, efficient mana and range dps to help with finishing targets off) the utility of bear charge, imp stealth, swiftmend and generally stronger base heals might take the edge considering pvp. At least that's what I took from your post here.. please re-assure me :P
---
I took 8/30 off work. Grinding for 4 days over Labor Day weekend is going to be the perfect way to start.
---
That's your experience, but this guild isn't mentioned anywhere in the wiki histories.
---
This kinda nails it. There were a ton of “popular” MMOs out there, all taking aim at that Everquest throne: Dark Age of Camelot, Asheron’s Call, Shadowbane, to name a few. All of them still catered to the hardcore gamer demographic though, with a core of tedious leveling, super specialized classes, and massive time sinks, plus some “twist”.  It was still a super-nerd thing to do.
---
WoW just seemed to turn it all on its head and suddenly even that jock kid was talking about his orc hunter or whatever. Interesting times.
---
What if its not just a few days of hardship? What if its more like two weeks?
---
What are the orange ones ?
---
The most frustrating moment in BWL was realizing the raid leader didn't get the Razorgore fight and why where failing at it.  Because it was a casual raiding guild, people simply couldn't do their jobs well enough on Razorgore to win.  The solution was put people through it over and over again until they got the experience required.  We should have pulled on Razorgore every 10-20 minutes until people could do everything needed on autopilot. Instead he tried to change his strat or analyze went wrong after every wipe and as a result we had about 1 pull every 50-60mins in a 3 hour raid.  
---
This resulted in 3 months of going no where on Razorgore until the entire raid finally had enough practice to beat him.  On the positive side, the rest of BWL was a breeze after that training period on Razorgore.
---
The one Murloc who just has a nifty healing pot in his pocket while you have 2 skills
---
And then you were in queue for 24+ hours!  Oh wait, that never happened, since the wait time drastically reduces over time.
---
The vid is an extreme example, and even in this example the person didn't end up waiting as long as implied, I guarantee it.
---
You are creating a boogieman that has never been a real problem before.  We have all endured queues and been able to enjoy a game.  It's not a big deal.  However, layering directly effects the quality of a game in a negative way, and might last weeks BEST CASE SCENARIO.
---
It is, however, the endgame exists at 60 to extend the life of the playable content out for as long as possible. There is no endgamefor40 content so there is only so much that is replayable/doable.
---
I think that's called TBC :D
---
Both HazelnuttyGames and AnnieFuschia went back to BfA, and I haven't seen any recent Classic videos from them.
---
Cultural enrichment simulator.
---
I don't know how people are justifying this.  Imagine they decided to put in LFG for "a few months tops".
---
Hunters are probably the most OP class in the game while leveling. Pets are just way too powerful. But they don’t scale later on - so I believe you had no trouble killing any class. 
---
I believe the poster above was pointing out that once you hit 60 - kiting is far more difficult and kiting MULTIPLE classes becomes impossible unless all of them are warriors - which is a rare scenario that was exampled above.
---
It's easily true, it's a fraction of what classic launch will see, just think about it.  We can pretty much assume anyone who logged on for a private server launch will be there for classic launch.  Then you have everyone who plays retail that will check it out, brand new subs from streamer hype, and anyone returning to WoW from the old times.
---
&gt; 15k people in queue
---
I'd prefer not to have to sit in a 15k person queue on release.  People always forget to mention that people have to pay a subscription time to have access to this stuff. If I'm paying $15/month then a reasonable expectation is that I can actually play and not sit in queue.
---
&gt; EDIT: Downvoted for inciting discussion. Jesus Christ this sub's toxicity gets worse with each passing day.
---
Lol, what? New to Reddit?
---
There’s certainly different steps of the process to get in good shape. But I feel a basic, easy to start/follow routine which can help lose weight with little to no exercise can really motivate those needing to lose it.
---
Once someone sees a steady measurable improvement of themselves, then they can go full moto and start lifting weights, adding protein supplements, and work on the body they want.
---
If they lift weight and diet, sure they are improving, but the added weight in muscle mass may mask the weight lost from fat and demotivate those not seeing improvement on a scale.
---
Yea I understand that but it had many negative effects that people really werent happy about at the time, they are aiming to avoid that.
---
See! There you go, 2 finger to move, and use your 9 key thumb pad to be somewhat compitient.  Bonus, the light show by healing with clique is attractive and your kiddo will probably loose thier mind!
---
You'll be able to sleep after a week or two most likely. You **will** be getting up regularly, but if you can find out what works for your kid, you should be able to go back down fairly quickly. Personally, I really struggled the first week until my parent's discovered that she slept in the [baby swing](https://www.amazon.com/Graco-Glider-Gliding-Swing-Affinia/dp/B00PTL1MD4/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=electric+baby+swing&amp;qid=1561399157&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-14). 
---
Hardest part was learning to accept that it's **okay** to sleep and learning how to balance things with your spouse. Being able to alternate shifts and trusting your partner to deal with it when they're up to bat is key.
---
Ah yeah you just said 40-man raid which I didn't think was it since on my server it was about...200 people fighting it lol.
---
I kept seeing this argument that all classes are identical in modern wow due to balancing them, but after playing some modern wow it seems more to do with blizz having redesigned entire classes.  My enhance shaman now feels like a warrior with building up maelstrom to cash in on other abilities.  I don't think balancing in classic wow would be the same thing. Buffing damage would be as simple as having better itemization or reworking the debuff limit that gimps some specs.  Nothing to do with how the class plays/feels.
---
[I've done a similar thing a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlity/someone_posted_this_map_here_a_while_ago_and_ive/epye2d8/) and used the map you've linked. Note that it has about 25+ spelling mistakes that I have fixed in my version of the map. For example, "The Tranquil Gardens **Cemetary**" is spelled "Cemetery", or "Camp Turajo" or "Nortwatch Hold" in The Barrens is "Camp Taurajo" and "Northwatch Hold".
---
Well you still have 30k+ population realms where you will never encounter the same person twice thanks to layering.  Enjoy your immersion.
---
Mistakes seems to happen quite a lot here.
---
Note: The big round of layoffs you're mentioning had absolutely nothing to do with development of engineering. Blizzard has been drastically increasing the size of both those departments which makes those layoffs irrelevant in this context.
---
To quote Facelessone001 (deleted his comment) 
---
"See the wow commercials. You are wrong. Wrath was even MORE mainstream, but it achieved that status in vanilla." 
---
Na, it wasn't mainstream, bc is where it got juicy, especially with the marketing, usually the catalyst for things going mainstream. It's okay though, the Mr T commercial was in bc, and it was funny.
---
You must think pc gaming was huge back then, too.
---
After how many times its not just a mistake anymore?
---
omg i remember finding this one after faking sick to get out of school on... a Tuesday... so no wow on patch day but this was the next best thing.
---
Even in those instances give me any other straight dps class over a hunter every time.
---
Yea I know myself too well.b I'll for sure flip flop on my "main" 100x over.  Trying to get that out of my system now.
---
If they keep layering for more than a Day people will be furious and it will kill the reason we loved WoW so much. 
---
You met the same fucking people again and again while leveling. If 90% of players are in different layers, that won't happen!
---
I’m sitting here at the DMV waiting to get my license renewed and just burst out laughing at “Camp Nacho.”
---
If you stacked all the world buffs, then you could go into the raid without talents, consumables, and class buffs, and still do comparable dmg to everyone else.
---
T0.5 was never designed for raiders, it was additional content for the non-raiders to advance their gear without raiding and help them out a bit in pvp against the raiders. 
---
What I would love to see those is them rethinking the set bonuses. The stats on the gear are shit, all 3 caster sets have 0 spell damage, the set spell damage bonus is a joke as is the +resist and +armor bonuses. They could make T0 relevant again by looking hard at the set bonuses instead of the straight-outta-beta shit it is right now. It's just sad that basically nobody wants the BPs that drop from Drakkisath who is pretty much the pre-raid "endgame."

This summer, get ready to ooga down your boogas, with 3 brothers.  And there's a Tauren there, sometimes maybe.  Raptors!
---
Based on the number of actual builds we've seen on the beta client, you cannot actually make that statement.

No, you did not respond a certain persons ban appeal, it can be easily proved.

Meal prep once or twice a week, takes maybe an hour total and that’s including waiting on cook times. Then instead of cooking lunch / dinner each night or ordering delivered junk, just zap your meal in the microwave and head back to your desk, use auto run and munch away

Be ready for people parking a couple of alts without charms to check every few hours. (And as soon as they get one, they swap out with another alt that doesn't have it.)

Tauren Shaman(me), and my brother Tauren Warrior(tank) are looking for more players. We have full time jobs but will be playing after work most days and on weekends. Looking to be 60 by phase two. Don't come at me trying to get us to join your guild. Sorry, no thanks.
---
Which is why layering is a bad solution to begin with.  They need to label servers as full or open, with people knowing they will be in significant length queues if they join a full server, then create servers as needed.
---
Then, as servers get smaller, they need to aggressively merge them.  This likely would not need to happen often.
---
&gt; I believe the poster above was pointing out that once you hit 60 - kiting is far more difficult and kiting MULTIPLE classes becomes impossible unless all of them are warriors - which is a rare scenario that was exampled above.
---
I've never won a 4v1 at 60 against other 60s, but I have won multiple 3v1 at 60 against non warriors(and died horribly trying as well).  You simply have to pick off the the most dangerous class to you first and then kite the rest effectively.  Lower level players are even easier to kill in this regard.
---
Just a quick note that it looks on the map like both the alliance and horde flight paths in Moonglade are the same one, when in reality the location shown is just the horde flight path and the alliance one is a bit east of the path rather than west of it. I only mention it because I know plenty of people who were unaware of the alliance fp even after leveling multiple characters to 60.
---
If people choose an overpopulated server just for the chance to see a streamer, that’s their own problem.

A lot of people think layering is the best solution and would be more disappointed with server merges rather than the plan that is short term layering for the initial waves of people.

Same!

I just submitted my time off sheet for the days too. I'm also going to ask if I can leave 2 hours early on Monday and start my vacation a little early. I believe that WoW launches on the 26th in NA, anyway, so that'll give me a few hours to get home, do whatever chores I need to do, eat and then play for 7+ days, for as many hours a day as possible.
---
pretty accurate

If a product was being developed using literal slave labor, are you absolved of any responsibility for buying that product, too, as long as it's high quality? 
---
I'm not saying crunch is as bad as slavery, but that's the logical conclusion of the ethical argument you're trying to make.
---
It's fine to say "I'm okay with some X maximum level of human misery involved in the product I buy", because in reality almost anything you buy involves someone being exploited along the way, and some of that exploitation is rather minor in the grand scheme of things. But to claim that the consumer has zero responsibility on any level is pretty grotesque.
---
99% will not put in the time and effort but will feel entitled to be treated as if they did giving the 1% and even harder time of being accepted.

Hahaha. I wonder which one of you he didn't like. For me I always wanted to kill this one DPS warrior so I'd always try to aim boss mechanics at him.

bold claim
---
I had a lot of fun with asmongolds army too, it was a really good event that probably would not have happened if there was no streamer

It was at -2 when I posted the edit. Obviously wouldn't be saying it had been "downvoted" if it was at +1

I think you are drastically underthinking this.

We moved over to new June 12th, so unless it was in the last two weeks I wouldn't be surprised. I gladly admitted above we failed to reply to a lot before moving over, however I don't think we've missed any since.

And to reiterate, you've never been banned according to our logs, so this all smells a bit like drama-stirring bullshit - or ban evasion.

Differing opinions are okay. But if you feel that way then retail is truly the game for you

It's actually opposite but similar

Take it slow. Read all quest text to learn the lore. Alot of those quests are no longer in the game.
---
Going to the keep in arathi highlands just to buy out the scrolls as alliance, advantage! (The guy that also sells the first aid books, he has like 20 something odd scrolls for sale at low rates)
---
no layering please and thanks
---
Yes it is possible. This is what you can do. 
---
Play your class and tank, tank whenever you want all the way to 60. Tank the 60 dungeons as well. Now what you should also do, is reserve any plate DPS gear when ur 60 in those dungeons when ur a tank. Collect all that pre-raid bis dps gear as a tank. Build that dps set while also building a tank set. This will give you the option to DPS raids now, because I figure there will be some PUG raiding going on at some point on the more popular servers. From here you will get ur chance at good gear as items will be on roll and not some loot council/dkp system that you could never gain traction on due to sporadic raid appearances. 
---
Do what u wanna do, then gather a preraid tank set and a pre raid dps set as ur initial goals. Those will take you some time since ur casual and unlock a new path of potential raiding opportunities when they pop up because you got the gear for either tanking/offtanking and dps. 
---
Yes engineering/mining is always worth it in general. Engineering imo is a must Bc it adds a whole new element to combat, and provides some nifty items.
---
Personally I am beyond psyched for the game, I took a week off of work and am going to binge the game *hard* on release.  But even as excited as I am, I have to say the appeal of a beta would be fleeting.  Knowing that anything I do is going to be wiped clean as we approach release really puts a damper on the game.  Participating in "meaningless" progress to an endgame that's capped at some level would really make it feel like a fun sandbox distraction than a real MMO, and even as desperately as I want to play I have no doubt I'd get tired of beta access.
---
Never played ret, but enhance does, they help tanks and melee dps more than resto
---
&gt; No one is living in the world anymore
---
Well yeah cause the world gets deleted within 2 months. Hard to grow attached if you know it's immediately going away.
---
neutral paths,  horde and alliance can take them, probably should have done a map legend, mb
---
1. There are tons of issues with server merges that many players feel  far outweighs the issues that come from the short term plan for layering
---
2. How about the people that choose servers early on before they are labeled as "full" or "high pop" and are then inundated with people. Are they forced to re-roll if they want a better playing experience? Also what if your friends want to play with you but your server is "full".
---
Good we are better off without them
---
Dual-wield ironfoe, thrash blade, hand of justice, sword spec, WF proc, oof.
---
so many people never got the 100% mount, at least on my server 100% mounts were on the uncommon side. I don't recall exact numbers but maybe 10 of the people in my raid guild had them. This was even true for warlocks and pallies because the quests weren't exactly easy from what i have heard.
---
There are several Classic discord servers. Some even dedicated to only one class.
---
Very interested in your macro post, hope you will post it!
---
Warlock pets unlearn their skills on summon... Enjoy...
---
That is what I was getting at. Why will 60 be much different?
---
They don't need all 10 developers working on layering (and in fact that would likely be detrimental), for one, and for two, we have no idea how the implementation of layering actually functions. For all we know most of the problem could be solved by tweaking a few constants. It's not possible for us on the outside to know how hard these problems actually are to solve.
---
I am looking foward to classic because I never had the chance to enjoy vanilla WoW at my own pace. I had a friend that constantly urged me to level and he would even power level me at times.He even was like "wtf are you doing reading the quest quest?" Ruined the experience for me.
---
Now I intend on taking my sweet ass time hitting 60. Still gonna go with mage, though. Love that class.
---
Doubtful and willing to make that bet.
---
ill have to look for them, i do alot of my content search on mobile so discord isnt always the best for me to keep up with discussions.

About Us: &lt;No Bedtime&gt; is a guild created with the mindset of completing all content WoW Classic has to offer in a competitive time table. The goal in mind for the guild was to harbor all different players from Casual to Hardcore Raiding, to create a mature community that you would want to be a part of and meet new people with similar goals and aspirations. Ideally the goal is to shoot for top 5-10 in terms of PvE progression on the realm of choice. We will be rolling on a non-streamer realm to avoid the plague of immaturity that many of their followers bring.  
---
Experience : Personally I've cleared and been a RL for all content until Naxx (AQ 9/9) playing across three different roles. This experience was in the Pserver scene but has provided valuable feedback for progressing forward into Classic. At the same time I was acting as the second in command, where this time I would be acting as GM. Playing on NA ping, and acting as a GM will be a new journey that I'm excited for!
---
Expectations / Closing Statements : If you are looking to join, then I expect you know how to conduct yourself among other humans with a sense of morality and maturity. We are looking for people who are enjoyable to be around but who also have a goal they would want to achieve. There are different ranks among the guild of which you can find your fit intermittently for the time being or a more cemented spot in the Raiding Roster.   
---
If you are interested in joining then you contact me via Discord and/or fill out a guild application or catch me in game; if you are interested in being a pivotal part of our success and joining the officiating ranks of (Class Leader / Council Member) also message me via Discord. Don't hesitate just message me!

And you have zero idea how difficult that is to fix. It could potentially be a one line fix.

yah, in a video by a streamer...   Most people don't have a cult just sitting idly by for anything dear leader wants.  A video that was cherry picked out of countless hours of footage too I might add.
---
It's like watching the unbreakable video, and thinking Shaman are overpowered.
---
Obviously, you have to make sure you don't trip over the gnomes when zoning in...

And for horde, you have to make sure you don't trip over all the squished gnome bodies when zoning in...
---
You’ll notice that the person I responded to said he wants to be in the Classic Beta, not stress test and was complaining about the rule that you need to be a subscriber.
---
A streamer isnt the only reason a server can end up highly populated. the game is more fun when you feel you are playing with more people, its not as easy to perfectly choose a server with just the right population, a lot of people will error on the side of choosing a more populated server for their enjoyment and it could lead to a massive server like "silvermoon 1". also what about people that choose Silvermoon 1 without knowing it would become the over populated server with issues? Are they forced to re-roll once it becomes bloated to have the same experience you or I want?
---
yet here you are, using reddit.
---
thanks for stopping by!
---
yeah there are spelling mistakes all over the place, I knew that going into it :(
---
If you want to fix the spelling errors go for it!  I'm going to update this map anyways, I'm missing at least 1 FP that someone pointed out, and then I'm gonna add zone levels as well.
---
Dumbest shit I've read today
---
Ah, thanks for the corrections! I quit before zandalari actually came out, so my bad there.
---
As for the azerirw gear, the reason it got worse was, for example, you could have an ilvl x azerite shoulder with 2 ability unlocked. As you use them and level up azerite power, you unlock the third ability. Then you finally find a replacement at ilvl x+5 and it would have one ability unlocked and the rest requiring you to level up azerite power more. So you would lose the buffs and abilities from azerite gear in exchange for slightly higher ilvl and stats
---
That may be it but it's not the vibe I'm getting while actually playing.
---
You literally mention modern WoW throughout your own post.

Discord has a mobile app...

You're damn right I'll still be arms with wearing my Ironfoe!

---
I think grouping up and making new friends is a solid way of making it more fun. Find people that you enjoy talking to while playing on discord. To me WoW classic is a lot about socialization (digital socialization anyway) and since I spend the majority of my time on an oil rig working mostly by myself for weeks on end, I enjoy the banter
---
One of the problems with the game is how bad the quest UI is. No wonder nobody reads the quests. Why not have them as a scrolling text in the middle of the screen with the npc model next to it.
---
I'm well aware and trust blizzard will do what they can. I'm not saying they will 100% fix everything, that's more what you're referring to. The idea they don't resolve the majority of these bugs, or at least the class breaking ones would be damaging to their classic launch. I'm sure a build on their side already has 50% of them fixed. Just an assumption but I'll stay optimistic. As a blizzard gamer since 99 I'm confident in the perspective I have.
---
Oh ok.. Me and A LOT of other players think that waiting hours to play in a world with far to many people fighting over quest mobs and resources isnt a preference over layering. So Blizzard trying to find a solution for me and the rest of the tons of people that feel that way seems reasonable doesnt it? or no... its just some cheap cash grab by Blizz and also they are personally trying to insult Kru5ht...
---
You would certainly be brushing up on your resume to go work at another game dev with crunch?
---
Crunch is part of the game dev job description
---
Holy moly, I don't know how to get that information without doing it myself.  And I already did this once and it took..... too damn long lol
---
too much potassium could give you kidney stones. maybe a banana every other level.
---
Your willing to bet that it will only be a few days of the initial masses of people trying out Classic WoW? And they will mostly stop playing after a few days? Seems really unlikely to me
---
Free server transfers are an option just like before.
---
If you choose a server, the population count states *high*, and you notice there's queues, would you still pick it?  
---
I personally wish, if this idea were the case, that it could state the population count, ex. Silvermoon 2 (1303). It would make it extremely easy to pick a well balanced server. But yes, if you choose a server that happens to have a high population count, you would need to wait queue, not re-roll.. Even if, the idea is that there would be enough servers to go around just like it was back in the day, so the odds of a server to become so filled that queues would be hours, is *extremely* low. And you know, it wouldn't be hard to do some research to find which servers the big name streamers will play on.
---
In Vanilla people literally ran 24/7 bots that teleported to nodes and that didn't permanently break the economy. I don't see how someone on a 100% speed mount getting 5 chances at each node could beat that.
---
" Gives players an incentive to so something other than just level to max asap "
---
This is why WoW classic isn't really like the vanilla experience. The mentality of players has fundamentally shifted since those days. It used to be all about the journey. Leveling was slow as hell but as much attention was put into that experience as the end-game content. You would explore just for the sake of it, you'd stop to chat to, help or even gank other players because you weren't really in a rush.
---
Now MMOs are always just a race to the 'end game'. That makes everything before the end game a grind, an obstacle that must be overcome as quickly as efficiently as possible. I do think developers have something to answer for as they've definitely 'leaned-in' to this mentality and encouraged it with streamlined leveling experiences, exp boosters and a greater focus on end-game but they could argue that they're just meeting the needs of the customers. I guess that's why you sometimes need to stick true to your creative vision and take feedback with a pinch of salt!
---
All this is why  I think MMOs went out of fashion compared to 2002-2010. The success of WoW Classic beyond the first 6 months is a good litmus test for this theory though and I hope the hype sustains itself of a while as that will be a clear message to developers.
---
Nah, see that horde warrior on the right won't ever make it into WoW, so this is a moot point.
---
GOD KNOWS THE TAUREN WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE HUMAN, SAME ARMOR AND ALL, NO FLAVOR ALLOWED.
---
its not about being stupid, its about playing with their friends&amp;family. sometimes i wonder if this sub is full of independent solo players? the amount of "cant choose faction"-posts is mindblowing.  
---
there is no way anyone would create a char on a different server if he intends to play with his friends, the merge COULD be as late as 2-3 months in as far as we know...
---
Aww come on don't leave us. We promise to be at least... 1% less toxic going forward.
---
That was a lie. I'm sorry.

Imagine i have some chocolate candy in ten different packs, each with a thousand pieces. Over time, some of those candies melt together within the pack.  Even if I combine one or two packs at a time, those pieces will still be melted together.  That's server merges.
---
Now imagine the alternative.  I keep moving pieces of candy between the packs.  They never have a chance to melt together.  Always shifting.  That's layering.
---
One gives people the opportunity to melt together with others, one doesn't.
---
Wow, some people put so much time into their setups. Hard to believe this is real.
---
You have to go the extra mile! (Or go combat rogue)
---
found the ooga gang

did they mention if theyre going to have linked AH at launch or if each city is going to be its own auction? I remember linking AH was a patch but I cant remember which.

Read it then post. That wouldn’t happen.

&gt; You don't even have to count calories to lose weight, just pay attention to your body's signals.

This is terrible advice lol. You realize that people overeating is due to their own bodies signals right?
---
It increases raid dps by 50% and raid health by 30%.   It's totally broken, and completely trivializes pve content.  
---
For example, I have seen Skeram in AQ40 pushed through the phases so fast that his clones disappeared.  This was a pre-Naxx patch.
---
It literally breaks pve content.
---
Request a refund, youll even get it automatic in the first 3 days
---
What about people like myself that plan on playing as soon as the game releases and the populations of servers and the whereabouts of streamers are completely unknown? Feels like a game of chance that the server I choose doesnt become the overpopulated one keeping me from playing the game without huge Q times or 200 people killing the same mobs as me.
---
yeah, BfA is bad

upvotes to the left

---
Sorry I misunderstood - I thought you were being sarcastic, and were against having a bug megathread. 
---
We can only have two sticky threads, this isn't some internal policy, this is just how Reddit works. We don't get a say in that, we're not the site admins. 
---
We have to choose carefully how we use them, we use one of them to reduce spam by having our rotating weekly posts. LFG Monday, WSIP Wednesday, and Simple Question Sunday are utterly vital for the subreddit to run sensibly. 
---
We have one that we can use flexibly, and for now we need more moderators because our existing team spending upwards of 2 hours a day clearing the queues is far more time than any of us have to give. We're using that last slot to advertise for moderators, and once we're satisfied with the number of applicants we will un-pin and likely return the bug report thread to being pinned. 
---
We can't have a megathread for every hot button issue, because there are just too many - at the moment we're being asked to make them for layering, melee leeway, language-locked EU servers, and discussing streamers. We'd have to start making decisions based on personal opinions and pick which of those is the most important issue, which we don't ever want to do as moderators, and I can't imagine the community really wants us to. Additionally putting one single issue in a sticky thread does not allow for quality discussion, it creates a circlejerk of the lowest common denominator.
---
The WoW art team has always been on point despite what the rest of the game is like.
---
The short answer? Experience. 
---
I'm on Private not Beta so I fully expect things to shake out differently (particularly with turn in order, drop % and rare spawn timers).
---
Mostly I wanted to make sure that from 10 to 30 I'm keeping professions current (Herb / Alch / Cooking / Fishing) and from 30 to 40 I'm highly focused on building up my gold to pop my mount right when I ding. From 40 to 60 I try to leverage the work I've done with keeping professions current into making real money on the AH. This is where Fishing / Alchemy and even Cooking (as the server economy matures) have excellent synergy and start making real money.
---
But there's general ideas as well. In a perfect PvE world you can run from Splintertree to Zoram'Gar no problem. I'll be in the managed chaos PvP world and I know it's not worth it to run past Astranaar as a level 20. Doing it at 25 when it's still a green turn in and I'm farming herbs, yeah that makes it a little less tense.
---
I have multiple friends who are making zero effort to get into beta to avoid burning out on grinding a character that will just get wiped because they want their Classic experience to be perfect. So its more that than just not wanting to grind to 40.
---
Don’t listen to the people who felt shamed by other people for playing hybrid. That must be an exhausting way to live. Play what you enjoy and laugh at the idiots that don’t understand. The great thing about vanilla was you lost some and you won some. Every class could be good if you put the effort and thought in.
---
He thought Blizzard didn't give him enough creative freedom.
---
In that scenario free server transfers doesnt sound like too bad of an option, but it would make the game feel like a revolving door of new people transferring on/off of your server..
---
Indeed. Good thing is I’m having my own business and can work from home. That will help everyone!
---
In retail, every expansion, totally changed my chars - my spec - my playstyle.
---
Basically every time I started getting decent, I'd be starting over again.
---
Then instant specs came along, and now it's impossible to play Holy Disc priest, or restro bear druid, or a shock a din.  My character loss all sense of identity, I didn't have to make hard decisions, I just switch to whatever is needed at anytime, and be just like everyone else.
---
On top of that by the time I had geared up, and was ready to think about raiding, the next expansion was just around the corner, why grind for months when I could get better for free as soon as next expansion started.
---
This time I can put in the time to truly master a class and not have to worry about my play style being totally removed from the game next expansion.
---
Power bottom situation.
---
Addons fix that.
---
Pally mount is a spell on the global cooldown, can't mount if silenced and takes a good 10 seconds if you've got curse of tongues on you.

Color me jealous.  My parents don't have $7,000 to loan me, much less GIVE me which I assume is what most people mean in these scenarios.  Take it if you can though.  No shame in needing help as long as you're actually trying to get better so you don't have to!
---
OFC they will still cap the number of concurrent people on a given server, what the fuck? did u think they would do mega servers and expect 98% of the fanbase to die down to remove layering? And realms wont be numbered, that would be fucking stupid aswell cause everyone would go to 1-4, as you said.  
---
Your whole point being "Even with layers it will be a shit show" is even supporting it, anything else would be utterly unplayable for anyone who couldnt prequeue with teamviewer.
---
That's not blackmail, it's a good old fashioned shakedown. Bribery, extortion, racketeering. Everything but blackmail.
---
Assuming that you level quite fast (~8days /played) and are still in P1 :
---
People don't have much gold and the vast majority isn't even 60 yet. The other level 60 are also trying to spare gold for the epic mount... so playing the AH is *veeeery* limited. Plus, Diremaul isn't available yet. 
---
You shouldn't have more than ~450 gold (already in the BEST case scenario) once you hit max level in those conditions.
---
Maybe you could farm Maraudon as a warlock? Assuming you'll be in green gear and since voidwalker is so heavily nerfed, I don't even know if Mara will be doable solo that early.
---
Well yeah good luck getting your mount in one night.

Razorgore wasn't fun at all with a dial up connection.

You believe undead is the best in PVP because you’ve heard it from someone else and haven’t put any logical thought into it. Think about it for 1 second.
---
if you're a shaman thats not up his own ass and actually willing to heal you'll have the least trouble of any class finding a raid spot.

OP is just ripping shitty memes from facebook and reposting them here lmao

Legendary FPs

I played on Detheroc and remember this happening. IO was easily the top guild on the server so the holdout probably could’ve gone a few more weeks before the next top guilds completed the quest line. Community shit like this is one of those things that makes vanilla so fun.
---
The animation issue is that a lot of the old spells dont have new animations. I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to use the old animations only it there is not a new animation, but it might end up looking weird. Who knows though.
---
Duh, ofc there are. But Im sure they discussed these and didnt went by dice roll and i dont see a better alternative. I used to think soon-to-be-merged servers are better than layering, but to imagine how itll play out in reality made me change my mind.
---
Ofc fighting over resources and mobs is apart of the game. Standing in durotar at lvl 2 trying to pick apples off of a cactus with 45 other players right clicking the same cactus is too far.. and thats the level of impact there would be if blizzard doesnt implement  some sort of solution. Nobody wants to take 5 hours to get a couple levels in the starting zone, especially not after they waited 3 hours to log in.
---
It definitely was not visible on the map in vanilla. I used to sit looking for where they would emerge from the base, then notify the team where they were running to murder them. Usually to be ignored by my team mindlessly zerging in the middle, and have to do it all myself.
---
HAHAHA too true
---
DP gets dispelled by the 2 most active healers on alliance. DP is one of the worst priest racials. People really need to learn.
---
or.... we've already hit cap and tested til our eyes bleed.

Yeah classic is like "kill or be killed" whereas current is fully asymmetrical warfare, psycho killer stuff. 
---
PS love the Murloc with the chefs hat
---
I am readying my battlestation now, buying all sorts of improvements for this special day
---
Did you play classic WoW at release?
---
Yeah most of their benefits involve stuns or stun resists
---
For those worried about layering farm abuse, there's nothing to worry about unless, the layering pop cap is less than a normal server cap, I mean the image illustrated shows 3k per layer which I believe is less than classic server cap of around 10k. A bit of clarification needed here. So if it was 10k cap per layer, then dont worry, the other layers gona be full just as much as yours and also, there wont be an influx of materials, which isnt really a bad thing because the more mats there is on the AH the cheaper they are, but yeah I guess the early 60s gona have a headstart but thats just how it is with or without layering.

&gt; Horde was always smaller until Blood Elves were introduced
---
This is so false.
---
There are a lot of Discord servers, even specific to just one class (it's quite easy to find them, for example, google: wow paladin Classic discord, etc.). Aside that, the WoW forums I guess Xd
---
There's saying retail is bad because of X,Y,Z design principals.  It's another thing entirely to be unwelcoming to people *because* they play retail

Barrens chat is absolutely wonderful. I'm sad I won't be experiencing it in its full glory since my first characters are going to be Alliance this time around.
---
We have several thousand viewers at any given time, whilst no one is sat on /New waiting for shit memes so they can report them (I hope, get outside, ride a bike, read a book, hell, play BfA if you're *that* bored), it's not unlikely that most of the time there is someone new refreshing /New and then seeing things they reckon should be reported.
---
wanted to change my night elf to a blood elf during TBC, but while i was researching how to do it i was warned it was a bannable offense so i chickened out.
---
Unless they remove it, it's probably going to be pretty awful for Hunter PvP in Classic. As it stands right now, Mages have even been reporting inability to get within Frost Nova range without taking hits from Tauren melee. It's not just Hunters, it's all ranged classes that will be affected. It completely breaks kiting and gives melee an unfair advantage. Melee, especially Tauren Warriors, are definitely going to be the PvP meta if this remains in game.
---
Hurricane's videos are probably the best wow content I've ever seen. That guy is the best.
---
It’s more than unionizing if one working adult per house is your goal. In fact unionizing now will have almost no affect on reaching that goal at all.
---
Take a look yourself then.

Sort by Alliance, Warrior, Patchwerk. The most ideal situation for 2H Slam. It sadly doesn't show talent builds or skill usage but the item sets of all the top contenders only show dual wield.
---
Slam only has 1 benefit. It hits harder than HS and that's it.
---
You spent talent points to achieve this but you will still ignore this skill during Execute phase. It's not like I don't see where you are coming from but the downsides cancels out the benefits in the long run. You're being forced to cast while in melee range and these bosses in vanilla has a lot of CC.
---
If Slam truly is the winner in DPS and all the private server players got it wrong, then I'm sure the top guilds in Classic will reflect that. Then we'll finally see an end to this silly debate.
---
You're kidding, right? The beta up to 40 is such a small part of Classic. There will be raids, pvp/honor system, more dungeons. I hope you're kidding. And like someone else mentioned, these characters get deleted in (likely less than) two months. That's another part of why no one cares too much at this point.
---
Hm, i See. I guess my Heart was always pretty high, didnt have that problem at all. The higher itemlevel + the stronger primary trait always countered my t2 traits.
---
But you are right, ive never thought of that. Truly bad design by blizzard yes. Feels like a fucking hamster wheel...
---
I dont hate the idea but it still has its drawbacks
---
This may be an unpopular opinion, but I prefer the old Wow to BfA.
---
Edit: Thanks for the kind gold stranger
---
It's going to be crowded mostly. Either skip those quests, come back later...etc. In the stress test, I found knocking em partially off as I'm running around for other quests to work best. Check back in those areas as it is convenient, but dont just stand around one spawn point. Better to go off killing random mobs or doing other quests.
---
Personally I'm going to delay my starting time to avoid the worst of it. As I'm EST, I'll sleep after work Monday as the servers come up. Then start playing fully rested 4-6 hours later. Also will skip some potential server instability/logon issues in those first few hours.
---
Other guy was right, lock could kill a holy paladin super fast and if there wasn't a warrior to babysit the bubble was the only thing that would delay death
---
Basically im monky
---
Wait, are there murlocs in Tanaris?
---
Can you imagine how badass it would be if 40 heroes were killing bosses while a thousand man army kills the endless waves on insects trying to mess up with the boss fight?
---
I get what you saying but if it's just fun playing regardless of progress or lvl, then it's always enjoyable :) If at anypoint the game feels more like work than fun, then I move on to somthing else.
---
The last game that I had this much hype for was Fable 3 - I literally had sticky notes and was counting down every single day.
---
Fortunately, this time around, I already know that Classic doesn't suck colossal ass (like Fable 3 did), so now the hype is **real**.
---
Off topic, but I’m going to miss TB and Blue Plz, this time around. Every time I see that pic I feel bad :(
---
Biggest issue is a single person or small group of players can monopolize and thereafter control the market of those high lvl resources, namely black lotus
---
It's more fun to afk attack as a ret paladin for 30 seconds, I agree. More time for YouTube
---
No, and from what I heard it was really rough
---
How did the Hunter handle that? Frost Trap + lucky Entrapment procs on all 4 of you?
---
Totally banned right now.
---
I haven’t seen that any where. Can you cite that?

**&lt;Sharp And Shiny&gt; | NA | RP - PvE | Progression Raiding Guild**
---
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
---
**Who are we:** &lt;Sharp and Shiny&gt; is a PvE progression focused guild made up of a mix of folks with original vanilla and private server experience as well as other MMOs. We are currently looking for more to round out our pre launch roster.
---
**What to expect from us:** Those who choose to be a part of our guild can expect to be a part of a focused but relaxed raiding environment that will clear fresh content quick and effectively. In classic, we want to put a larger focus on having more casual members or socials to in the future allow for more out of main raid activities, such as PvP, dungeons, and raid PuGs, which we hope will reduce the onset of raid log mentality.
---
**What we expect from you:** We have a 80% minimum raid attendance requirement. We intend to be in Molten Core 4 weeks after launch at the latest and have a hard leveling time cap of 6 weeks to hold a raid spot. After hitting cap, we expect each raider to be working towards their pre raid BiS as well as farming for their raid consumables. We expect every member to act mature, especially to those outside of the guild, as we will be very conscious of our guilds reputation on the server that we choose to play. Mainly just don't be a dick.
---
**Why RP-PvE?:** The community. While the guild itself is not RP restricted and we have no RP expectations for any of our members, we are rolling on a RP server to avoid the elitism and toxicity that is sometimes prevalent on PvE and PvP servers. We also plan on possibly holding server community events that we believe will be more accepted on an RP server.
---
**Raid times:** Sun/Tues 6:00 - 9:00 PST with a potential third day added come phase 5
---
**Loot system:** Loot Council
---
**What are we currently looking for?:**
---
Fury Warriors
---
Mages
---
Warlocks
---
If you don't fit these rolls feel free to contact me, as we will always be welcoming of exceptional applicants of any class.
---
 **If you have any questions or want to apply, come join our discord.**

I think it only increases melee range without decreasing your shot range but I might be wrong. Still very bad news for hunters.
---
It was this, tons of people in the starting zone and it wasn’t as bad as you make it up to be.
---
&gt; PS love the Murloc with the chefs hat
---
*Cookie has entered the chat*
---
It would be somewhat of a game of chance, but the odds are in your favor, and even if, re-rolling your level 15 character to another server is not going to be the end of the world. You will notice this very early because of queues. People will not pick servers with queues in the first place.
---
It's allways going to be a compromise. If Blizzard is continuing the plans by using layering as a way to control overcrowded areas, [which originally it wasn't](https://youtu.be/VhR7DYS0MFY?t=116), the side-effects would still be some of the examples shown in the video of this post.
---
If they can somehow fix these problems of overcrowdedness, but still retain balance of economy, one cohesive word and layer hopping exploits, then this idea would *not* be a good one.
---
Don’t take advice from this guy, clearly uneducated immediately stating that because UD get WoTF that they’re “great for pvp”. That’d be true if arena existed, but in open world and premade BGs where alliance have more stun heavy classes and their top 2 healers have disease cleansing, DP gets dispelled instantly. There’s 0 logical reason that WoTF is better than hex of weakness and shadowguard scaling. Just think for 1 second about it and you’ll understand. UD look better so if you’re going for the aesthetic, then fine. But for vanillas PVP style it’s absolutely wrong to think UD are better.
---
Exactly, the complaint that "I want everyone else to see what I see" falls flat. Does that mean everyone needs the exact same monitor, graphics card, etc?
---
You must not have played horde in Vanilla like I did. I watched the sever balance go from 3 A to 1 H, and then flip almost overnight to 1 to 1 in TBC.
---
This doesn't sound too bad. If you are measuring in "man hours" of course it is going to be a big number. In retail if it takes a guild 2 weeks to clear the raid playing 12 hours a day that is 6720 "man hours".
---
True and my anger steam more from the invalidation of previous that's been trending in a lot of loot games lately, BFA included.
---
Sweden has never tried a 4 day workweek.
---
I’m not really following this sub much, did they redevelop the game from scratch or are they merely re-releasing a patched version of vanilla from pre-burning crusade?
---
Golds too hard to come by in classic... you may have 25c and some boar meat
---
It isn’t. He’s wrong.
---
dude got his PhD in alliance 1-30 leveling
---
Right? In the modern WoW, I can't level through Grizzly Hills as Blizzard intended (before Activision mind-controlled it, of course). That's why Classic is better. Can't wait to experience a truly complex RPG once more, with intricate combat rotations.
---
I'm confused... You are posting on a 3 month old Post. You also clearly read through my prior posts to see that I plan to roll a warrior. Somehow you missed my multiple posts talking about how if anything changes should happen it should be a Nerf to warrior DPS. Weird man...
---
Uh, yeah? They're games, are they not? The statement isn't "Most popular game where you're forced to pay for a subscription", it's "most popular game" period.
---
Hey to each their own! When I'm leveling on a fresh server I don't place a lot of stock in itemization, pre 50, for the exact reason you mentioned. 
---
Even a great BoE that's perfect for me, I'd rather auction it for gold or hang on to it and sell when the server economy matures.
---
I like Crescent Staff because you can still hit hard but the stats allow you to flex into a healer if need.
---
Until they are spread throughout the game yes. I just want the option, nothing more or less.
---
The class mounts are a spell so they cost mana, interrupt mana regeneration, use a global cooldown, etc.
---
For me, the ideal situation is layering implemented as they planned with bugs and hopping exploits fixed as much as possible. A lot of peoples criticisms of layering seem to be the exploits and bugs and not the root idea itself. I agree those bugs and exploits need to be addressed
---
For sure. I doubt it would take nearly as much work as people here seem to assume, but it's ***still*** extra work that the developers don't have time for; especially with the weird outry from this community.

&lt;Invictus&gt; Now Recruiting PvP/Alliance/NA/Semi-Hardcore/EST
---
Introduction: We are long-time MMO/ WoW players that are new to the vanilla WoW Experience and are looking for more similar and likeminded players to form a community experience with.
---
Member expectations: We understand that some members have jobs and schedules that may prevent them from regular participation. While we expect some level of activity, we do seek to accommodate players who may find themselves unable to frequent scheduled guild activities.
---
PVP: For phase one we will be encouraging WPvP and city raids while we build a repuation as a notorious PvP guild in our server’s community. For phase two and beyond we would like to begin farm rank 10s through premade bgs. Should there be a demand for it then an Elite placement team pushing for ranks 11-13 is to be expected.
---
PVE: Our events schedule includes phase one raiding and beyond. Our goal is not min maxing but a fun raiding experience in our own time. We will be using the loot council system in the utmost fair way possible for efficiency and fairness.
---
Schedule: Raiding on Tuesday and Wednesday 8:00 - 11:00 P.M Eastern Time. PvP events will be spontaneous until further notice (Phase 2)
---
Recruitment: We currently are looking to recruit class leads for every class. We also have openings for almost every spec and class on our team. We currently have special positions open for our raid team. Mages needed
---
Message an officer to get into the discord or for any additional details and our special organized guild events. Valdaram#1800 or MilesDauss#1563 (Admin) (Bnet) Or Valdaram#7767 On Discord
---
I mean you use it on melee in 1v1 and it will make you crush anyone that way out gears you. I watched my level 58 undead priest buddy kill a full t2 rogue.
---
In hoping a ton of people dont realize launch is on the 26th in NA and it will be less populated
---
The suppression room.....
---
These rumors are hilarious.
---
He never worked for Blizzard, he's said that multiple times on Reddit. In the end it came down to his location.
---
Ding ding, this is the reason I always played on these servers, and don’t tell anyone, but it’s exactly how you suspect it would be. Typically the player base is a little older and a little wiser.
---
Haha. 
---
They rolled the server back 5 minutes to get rid of it.
---
I won’t leave. Like I tell all my girlfriends, I’ll always be with you but I want to also be with other people too
---

---
Horde has the advantage in World PvP. Alliance everywhere else
---
Yea everyone was trying to do everything at the same time and it wasn’t really that bad at all. Read ITZ comments on the thread I linked.
---
Problem is, the game's not out, and most everything has been hashed out already. There's not much else to do but talk about the currently existing game.
---
They shot that episode on bc alpha clients, yea, I would love to get the boys back together for bc.
---
The implementation of this catchup gear is really smart though. You need to do dungeons, spend gold, do long quests, so it's not free gear, it's a lot of effort. It's not better than previous gear, but it allows you to stand a chance in a AQ raid.
---
The notification settings arent specific enough l. It’s either every part of everyone’s conversation or it’s muted entirely, I like forums where I can go back and read discussions other people have had
---
They’re easy to outplay.
---
Yeah, have never played a Troll Priest so I only remembered how awful Shadowblobs were (except for proccing Blackout). You do have a point, Touch of Weakness is pretty decent.
---
Ah you're right. Been awhile. I seem to recall locks getting an instant mount at one point with a talent. Idk if paladins have a similar way.
---
We have near record low unemployment rates with the highest worker wage, executive pay gap since the abolishment of slavery in the US. 
---
Unions are designed to allow workers a large voice and transparency in their share of what a company takes home.  While I agree that things like a FDR era wealth tax would help draw wealth away from the uber rich, you, nor I can do that. You CAN talk to your coworkers about forming a union to allow a unified voice to allow you to negotiate better wages. Else, you can let your boss pocket more of your earned wages.
---
This was already the top post all weekend, it's a little soon to be reposting.
---
Enh/ele hybrid at 60, super excited for it and plan to keep it even if I cant get a raid slot I'll find a pug somewhere
---
Im honestly just worried about solo play as anything but enhance
---
The prospect of leaving past burdens behind, experiencing new opportunities, and being roughly on par with everybody else is very appealing. 
---
I wish current wow would release fresh realms at fixed dates and prohibit character transfers to then for 6 months
---
you think there wont ever be more than 5k people online at the same time over level 30?
---
^ this guy knows what's up. Honestly the worst thing about being a feral is the community. Devoting hours to master something just to be told its shit by bads who don't know what they're doing is very frustrating.
---
You will be told that its impossible to tank fights that you have personally tanked. You will be told that your damage is awful by people who are below you on the meters. Community conception of ferals is rough and it is persistent. 
---
But as /u/meerkatattack said, bad feral druids running around giving us a shit reputation are even worse.
---
because he isn't part of the ooga gang.
---
&gt;But we are planning on remaking this exact combo for release!
---
Same with my SO and myself! My promise is that I'll be their support/healer class for any and all Alts.
---
Lol wait really? Jesus I feel bad when my mom buys me lunch
---
Lol, first thing I though of as well when I saw the pic.
---
Getting the boys back together
---
So we can repost the shit outta this
---
Looking a bit ratchet there bud
---
It’s all good. Just me being a noob
---
We never got TF or HoR.   Not that HoR mattered.  TF was what was broken as fuck, and made a huge difference in progression.
---
I think statistically speaking, it takes about a year of clears to get 1 TF.
---
black lotus still has a very high respawn, how damaging can a few days with 4-5 layers be, EVEN IF one guild manages to get ALL of them (which is completely ridiculous)
---
Wow really,  I didn't know they were that bad.  Are they only pumping out 60-70% of other typical DPS?  Will need to get a damage meter working and monitor this.
---

You mostly just get abuse, so I guess if that's your kink I guess that's payment of a kind. 
---
Other than that sod all.
---
Doesn’t stack
---
Except layering is contenent wide and irrelevant to lvl. They may be able to modify the tech reasonably easy to throw all lvl30+ on to the same layer, but that is not how the tech was designed. It would require code changes. Also they'd have to modify the logon tech to be aware that the 30+ layer is full and to queue those players.
---
&gt; Support for wide screen ratios (16:9, 16:10 and 5:4) have been added as a fullscreen choice. The video options have been enhanced to list individual display resolution modes. At this time, windowed mode will still be limited to a 4:3 ratio. 
---
This is going to totally break PvP, those with widescreen monitors will have an advantage over everyone with a CRT by the simple fact they see more of the game world. Way to ruin the game blizzard, launch is totally going to fail now.
---
\#ThanksObama
---
About the same as this beta, except this one has layering and even better leeway!
---
I don’t keep up with lore, but aren’t u suppose to be a overpowered general in BFA? I mean legion had you wielding one of the most powerful weapons

Just scroll up on Discord then. Still better than Reddit.

I see we are still making sure we show our insecurities
---
"GUYS I SWEAR CLASSIC WOW IS BETTER THAN RETAIL! LUL RETAIL!"
---
Hardly new era, its revisited content of hype and nostalgia, so the magic of new content is very little since so many people read and watched classic content. Also the competition is stronger than ever, with already private server guilds speed running raids.
---
I run one
---
Feel free to stop by https://discord.gg/22uwhHH
---
Add more servers blindly? No
---
Add warsong 1-5 with shared naming conventions with merges of smaller sections (ie 2 and 3) when needed. Yes
---
Something I noticed about paladins is that you don't really get a good weapon in that level 6 to 10ish range. Even if you pick up the kobold shovel (white that drops in the mine) there's not anything else coming from quest rewards, IIRC. You do get one-handed options but as far as I know, there aren't any two-handed ones. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd say that that contributes a LOT to feeling pretty weak. Paladin starts out super strong but by about level 10 you start feeling weaker and that has to be in part due to the lack of weapon upgrades.)
---
If you need to feel useful though I'd go with priest, too. A hybrid spec that allows you to be viable in raid as a healer and as dps in battlegrounds/wpvp would be ideal to save you some coin on respeccing, but I don't know a lot about that.
---
Nice dude *-*
---
Man I feel for you. Fortunately, my university doesn't begin until September 3rd and I told my thesis supervisor I would be unavailable the week of launch. But come September 3rd? Who knows how much time I'll have. So much for classic summer!
---
Attacked from cover, with aimshot-&gt;Multishot killing 1 of us before we located her.  I charged into her freezing trap, she scatter shot the other warrior and kited the 3ed.  She dropped a frost trap to slow down the chase and kited the other to death.  By the time I was out of the trap it and had caught up to the kite, it was 1 v 1 and I she easily killed me.
---
When it comes to hunter vs group, your primary goal is quick kill, followed by stringing people out so you're only kiting one person at a time.  Hunter mobility + traps makes this process every effective.
---
Yes it did BUT if you held the flag and made it back to your base as a hunter you could FD in order to drop you from anyone who already had you targeted. And you'd just pick it right back up again
---
No. Layering is contenent wide. It is not a per zone technology. You are thinking of retails sharding tech that can balance by zone across a server cluster.
---
Yeah, only to have the same problems in Warsong1 because everyone and their mother wants to start on the server where their server started. How can you guys assume an even distribution over these servers lmao?
---
Means the loot system is fucked up.
---
Good luck racing the guys who want to be the first to post something thier
---
Shut up dude. You're imaging anger when there isn't.
---
I did not say 2004 was more difficult than current mythic, I said it was more rewarding...
---
Currently mythic raiding is very hard, but not nearly as rewarding. 
---
Think we got 4 boss's down in EN, then the guild decided to transfer servers, they invited me but I declined... To many times over the years have I paid to transfer for a fleeting social structure of a guild, but everyone always gets burnt, no reason to pay cash to chase.
---
Besides I was only doing mythic to see if I still "had it" and I did. I prefer PvP to the punch of the clock working that is raiding.
---
You could you know... Just not play classic and stop trying to defend retail. BFA is shit, if you enjoy consuming shit, well that is your choice. Have fun
---
People have /played 18+ days in a bit over a month, with limited levels. There is no problem

---
That's just a myth alliance players tell themselves. Any above average shaman or priest will purge it in a second. People are much more knowledgeable than in 2004-6.
---
It depends how long it lasts. On the last private server, a single guild monopolized devilsaur for a few months. They drove the price to imsane numbers and it took quite a long time for the price to drop and stabilize even after they stopped. I can see a large enough competent guild controlling all the layers, especially when you cam have a macro to hop your whole raid to another layer at will.
---
Originally Blizz considered sharding fir the early zones, but too many crybabies though that was a bad idea... so instead blizz creates Layering gech which is worse and more game impacting because its across the whole continent. Though in layering defense, it does help solve other issues which is why Blizz probably went that way. T
---
Lmao another angry lil fella 
---
“This setup is absolutely horrible for gaming period.” 
---
Someone sounds a little flustered over what someone else is doing? 
---
Get a life
---
Yeah I don’t even play feral - or even like most ferals because the reality is what it is. I do honestly feel bad for the hard working guys that usually have to raid in guilds below their skill level (while still taking verbal abuse from idiots) until their reputation gets them into a better one.
---
I'm fine with it aslong as it's an option, I absolutely detest the clumsy gait the new model Taurens get, but at the same time I don't care at all about something that is totally cosmetic and togglable.
---
&gt; If a product was being developed using literal slave labor, are you absolved of any responsibility for buying that product, too, as long as it's high quality? 
---
But it's not. If the moon was made of cheese, would you eat it?
---
&gt; I'm not saying crunch is as bad as slavery, but that's the logical conclusion of the ethical argument you're trying to make. 
---
No it's not the logical conclusion of my argument. 
---
&gt;  because in reality almost anything you buy involves someone being exploited along the way, and some of that exploitation is rather minor in the grand scheme of things 
---
This is an absolutely meaningless statement. What kind of exploitation are you talking about? If you have knowledge of any exploitation taking place, you should report it to your local authorities. Which leads me to my next point. 
---
&gt; But to claim that the consumer has zero responsibility on any level is pretty grotesque 
---
No we definitely do have a responsibility as I said. If crunch time makes the product worse than it could have been otherwise, then don't buy it.
---
Shamans are so good in world PvP, they have a tool for every encounter. Of course shamans seem to be one of those classes where most are average, but a handful are godlike and make you wonder why you don't roll shaman.
---
deleted in 3...2...1
---
Can’t wait for the edgelords to get banned in classic for the song they say everyday in world chat. Man, Classic will be a breath of fresh air with the unpoliced world chat.
---
I feel like you're mad in your personal life and are just projecting that everyone else is angry
---
You just can't play shit with this setup. Destroy it.
---
It's an old school hunter trick. If someone is tabbing through targets, you can often but yourself a second or half second where they target your pet and fire off a spell or ability. Even if it made the person stop for tiny moment while they had to check if they'd selected the correct target or not.  
---
Typically as well is you'd make you're own name with an ASCII character and spell the pet with regular letters. So anyone macroing /target Kazparov would get the pet.
---
Isnt the expectation that the release of Classic will be much more chaotic with more people?
---
Classic isn't for you mate.
---
Lol I did this in 2004 while at work, and someone uploaded it to thottbot. 
---
It was replaced by an interactive map someone had created, but I love that the same problems create the same solution 15 years later.
---
Are you stupid ? Ofc its dying, the cap is 40 most ppl Think the game starts at 60 , + investing alot of time into a beta char is just wasted time, so stop being retarded
---
It's all relative. If all you've played is current retail WoW, vanilla was a grindfest. If you've played FFXI, lineage 2, etc, then vanilla is pretty tame. Someone who considers themselves a casual player in BfA probably won't be able to achieve much in Classic WoW.
---
Shh if they don't realize there won't be any queues
---
Another point is that enchantment is boring to play. People tend to forget this.
---
Theresa is a beatiful RPG element in this case tbh

Or just 1/7th of the community is allowed to play
---
Again, you're moving the goalposts. Where did I say that 2h fury does more damage than dual wield?  By the time you're at patchwerk, you should be geared to the point where you will have the +hit and endgame weapons where dual wield will always be king of dps. 
---
My argument is that using excess rage on improved slam while using a 2h fury build is a better use of rage than using hamstring.
---
If I type "LFG Deadmines" in Westfall currently, wont I get replies from people on different layers? This situation is not nearly as niche as you make it seem
---
Its annoying when a name you want is taken and you never find the player who got it.   I'm scared that jerks will just hoard names on toons they no intention of using
---
I am the GM and MT of a hardcore guild. Most of us are taking off 1-3 weeks off work at launch. Looking to be top 5 guild server. Tuesday/Wed 8:30 PM est. Would you be okay with OT and raid organization involvement.
---
I'm kinda 50/50 on this. I mean, on one hand, I do agree with you. The journey is half the fun. On the other hand...that's me, not everyone.
---
And also, I dunno, I don't intend to come off as sarcastic I guess, but...what makes people think everyone doesn't already know this stuff? Lots of the minmaxers are people who played on pservers or during Vanilla and do remember the things you've described.
---
There \*is\* something to be said about how it comes off on paper and how it feels when you're actually doing it—I can admit that much! When you go to the trainer for a new batch of spells and you've just spent 10 or 15 or 20 silver training in your professions and have nothing you can afford to buy... It really does feel bad. :') But to assume all of these Race to the Finish people will be shown what's what by the game, put into their place... Eh. It comes off a little elitist/holier-than-thou? The average goon probably won't be as good at minmaxing as they want to be, but for the large swath of competitive folks out there, I think they know what they're about and have done their research.
---
Though to be fair, we'll all be hanging out in the starting zones for a while trying to get tags on things, so that'll cut into people's "get to max level faster than Joana's record" goals (though to be fair, there aren't many people who have that mindset right now).
---
&gt; I'm 99% positive it's the same sharding tech they have always had. The simply reduced the number of shards per server.
---
Somone clearly haven't played retail since sharding was added or they haven't played classic.
---
You are a Champion empowered with a relic called the Heart of Azeroth, which give some impressive power ups.
---
So, the player character is well-trained, accomplished, and uses enchanted equipment to battle. It isn't invencibility (far from it), but it allows the Champion of Azeroth to do truly heroic deeds.
---
Thanks man :)
---
Emerald dream was on its own map (as all instances are), and you could change which map an instance portal would send you to. There's a lot more going on to make it work, but that's the general idea.
---
I think I have a couple of more screens of the overhaul, but it was mostly done for a video project so I didn't bother screenshotting much. I'll take a look on the old drive tomorrow.
---
I see you're making a big deal out of a joke. Someone's insecure himself. Take your own advice. Laugh and move on.
---
Yes i agree, if they can fix these problems, with any sort of solution, it would be perfectly fine. I don't believe there's going to be an answer which doesn't intail some sort of compremise, wether that be shitshow launch, dead servers, or exploits down the line. The argument should evolve around what retains the classic experience, while minimizing these issues we've seen currently, and I think this idea has potential to solve that. But I might be wrong, and we should have an open mind to find the best solution.
---
I used to just spam hamstring with PoD.
---
i'm levelling as enhance, just as i did the first time round
---
Honestly? No.
---
Discord is hands down the best crowdpowered tool for these type of things.
---
Okay thank you for sharing
---
If wow classic was made free to play with a giant fomo based cosmetics shops i bet it could challenge at least the pc only titles for top monthly players.
---
Yea I assume it's a slide over situation for getting in and out. The largest prob with recliner setups. I went with wall mount monitor arm that swings in and out.
---
https://photos.app.goo.gl/oRij4yb5PiK66NrX9
---
Sharding was in classic?
---
This guy wants 6 hour queues, move along...
---
The fuck are you so toxic for?
---
While it's true that this system has some downsides it also has upsides. If someone spams gold seller ads or nazi propaganda you can mute them quicker than it would take for a GM to investigate.
---
You'll be unmuted when the GM review shows that you have been wrongfully muted and in cases of abusing this system to silence players for lulz/trolling/the reporters just being assholes there should be ramifications for abuse of the system.
---
If people get punished for abusing it, they won't. Easy as that. 
---
Now I'm not taking a stance on how this should be handled for classic. I'm merely saying that you're totally overreacting and being toxic as fuck for no reason at all.
---
&gt;  The end user experience is what suffers. Things like seeing empty cities because of an empty shard,
---
So you think dead servers don't happen?
---
&gt;  or seeing 50 people appear out of nowhere while getting rid of the quest mob you were about to kill or the node you were about to gather.
---
You don't layer switch unless you are trying to.  The *only* exception to this is them collapsing two layers into a single one.  This is something you may never actually witness once it goes live.
---
Oh, you know when else it happens?  Right when a server comes back online.  Try standing around in town right after a reboot and watch as "50 people appear out of nowhere" as they **LOG IN**.
---
Cinematics like these would be amazing in game, I'll remember to watch them first time the new content drops haha
---
Part of me wants that brand new feeling back, but the rest of me is more like, "Thank God I know to go to the trainer and learn feed pet this time."
---
Let me get this straight.
---
You believe that sharding is to save money by having less servers?
---
You *don't* believe sharding is to prevent dead servers once all the looky-loos go back to BfA? AKA dead communities?
---
Someone already killed named scorpion in VoT. This realms is ancient /s
---
Though I played for a bit of Vanilla, I never hit level cap.  Between that, wanting to experience the raids and some fun World PvP, I'm stoked!
---
That's less damage but sure I guess it works
---
So. Server merges is out of the question all of a sudden? Are they unable to merge servers now? They're just an indie company after all.
---
Though thatd be far from the monitor. Maybe the chairs roll in somehow. @OP, inquiring minds want to know
---
&gt; was 5 years old, and my favorite part of the game was jumping off of cliffs and dying
---
Dude, i'm almost 40 now and that is still one of the more fun things to do in retail, finding out if you can jump off something and die.
---
There is absolutely no answer for holy paladin in premade vs premade. Holy paladin are so powerful for the group it is unstoppable.
---
Playing on the Pservers and back in the day we would absolutely wreck. AV. AB with all five points. WSG. Didn’t matter.
---
not really possible to macro it with 1 button though lol.
---
I love the idea of these player controlled mafias. its entirely different for black lotus though, because black lotus cant be griefed on your same faction (like sheeping devilsaurs). Means you somehow have to "control" EPL to keep ANYONE out, this is maybe easy in the first 2 weeks, after that the tryhard mass will arrive.
---
That money is for drinks, no one should expect me to fuck my horse sober.
---
Usually when I see people talk about crunch time none of the anger is aimed at the actual developers. It is the fault of the publishers for setting strict release dates and demanding games be released then no matter what
---
Game developers need to unionize to gain basic working rights, but nobody wants to risk their job
---
Yes. Because server merges were a thing back then. It just required more resources.
---
Well then we have bigger problems, don't we? 30+ is part of the permanent population. They're not tourists. They're not going to quit two weeks in. If we have &gt;5k high levels, they can't disable layering.
---
Sorry guy but this is a very bad post all around
---
You are naive if you think that is completely ridiculous. Illegal in-game transactions are made into total operations by groups that do just that. That’s spanning over many gaming titles.
---
Fortnite is a sandbox game, rust too, not wow really.
---
Racist.
---
The engi shield is literally game changing.
---
This guy wants layering
---
Unfortunately that's not what vanilla was like. Think rock paper scissors and the classes who can throw multiple "roles" don't do them as well as the ones who one trick.
---
Idk. Have to wait and see launch day.
---
For a new layer to spin up, it requires X number of people to be on it. You aren't going to have a layer designed for thousands, and only have a couple hundred people on it. 
---
You also can't control what your native layer is. So you are going to tell me, a group of people are going to keep making characters on launch day until they end up on different layers. Then level faster then everyone else so they can get to a Black Lotus before others do, all while hoping they are on a low population layer, because you won't know what layer is going to have people leveling faster or not early on. 
---
There is so much RNG for this doom and gloom to even be possible.... The amount of stupid sheep mentality in this sub is ridiculous.
---
Crunch is only unavoidable if the company fails to properly allocate time and resources for a project
---
That what I am witnessing.
---
Is the stress test not part of the beta?!??!
---
Pretty sure one of them beat Venruki in a duel
---
I'm not having this conversation. sorry buddy. calm your shit and move on
---
Layering is in classic, sharding is on retail.
---
There's one of them you haven't played if you believe they're the same thing.
---
Iunno man, I think classic is a game you can play at any pace and find people just like you.
---
yes, but read my other comment. Black Lotus IS FAR HARDER to 'control' than things like devilsaur. Youre asking that NOBODY of ANY FACTION gets even ONE black lotus in the first few weeks? are u serious? How are these groups able to keep 10k players magically out of EPL?
---
That might actually be better... The hype will have leveled out a little bit by then and everything will be busy, but not crazy levels of busy. Sorry about the 60 hour workweek though...that shit's rough.
---
As you  can see in the picture there is a cow holding a big stick. Human is smaller than stick, therefore i think the cow has the advantage.
---
Vaelstrasz. That MF was a guild destroyer if you had a few mouth breathers that didn't know how to watch their debuffs and threat.
---
That's my choice, too.
---
Now I just need a good name.
---
Oh I see, thanks.
---
I'm pretty sure that GoldenEye on the N64 didn't have jumping. I can't remember if Perfect Dark did or not.
---
&gt; then the whole racism and slavery thing was the Alliance of Lordaeron
---
So the Undead
---
What specs are absolute garbage? And in what?
---
Those little bastards at that logging camp!
---
Tenderizer.
---
It kinda is. But it depends on what you do with it. The campfire change was something you could do to easily get advantages. Just change it to the dark portal, and with creating a "campfire" you could float through the air and access locations you shouldn't be, like in battlegrounds. 
---
I don't know how much of a detection system they had back then, but I can't imagine they check every single file every time you start up your game. The only thing that would get you banned is talking in chat about it all the time and/or floating through the air in cities or battlegrounds, because that way you get reported by several people.
---
You could see people disappear once every hour during the first months because in a normal situation nothing happens. People don't get invited twice per minute and layering will be gone within phase 1.
---
Or you get have server merges and throw together independent communities and economies into one with issues such as identical names. Not impossible to solve though.
---
"People disappearing" is a horrible argument against layering. Farming issues, e.g arena trinket abuse and more are pretty decent arguments against layering.
---
In order for workers to have any sorts of rights in America they need to have a union, and there is currently nobody fighting for the rights of Game developers.
---
Companies have spent years trying to feed anti-union propaganda and judging by the comments I see on reddit all the time, the propaganda had worked
---
If you buy a game developed unethically you are voting with your wallet and saying you are ok with this
---
Cool.
---
Yeah I suppose everyone has a different threshold for what they’ll happily play with and I certainly didn’t mean there weren’t issues, just that it was specifically worse than what else I’ve experienced if you happened to be less experienced than you are.

There's the gun for the Ashenvale quest.
---
You clearly didn't read my post. I realize what arguments people give to differentiate layering and sharding. I'm saying I don't believe it.
---
Here’s the thing , blacklists happened in vanilla. I think soda expressed his message incorrectly but he’s doing some normal vanilla social stuff by using a black list if it’s organized well.
---
i like classic more beacuse of community and stuff 
---
thank you for coming to my ted talk
---
The reason you see it less is that instead of 1000 layers it's 7 layers.
---
I dont think 30+ players will definitely stick around. I can see the hype die down and people stop leveling, even in their 30s or 40s. I could imagine people quitting when they suddenly realize how empty the endgame in classic is and how leveling was 80% of the game, or all those minmax-parse-raid-hardcore players getting hit in the face with the monotonocity of damage rotations and class imbalance.
---
But yeah, generally, having fewer layers when leveling up sounds good, but it also changes the world perception/game flow by a large margin. EPL is supposed to be nearly empty if you managed to level to 60 in a week. With only 1 layer of EPL existing it would kinda feel unreal to be ahead of the pack and still see a packed zone.
---
If by some wild miracle I manage to save up enough gold, I would probably train the skill (I think you still have to have riding to cast the spells?) and then do the questline. There's no reason to drop all that cash on a mount for a month or two, unless it's something I really want for giggles (like another race's mount).
---
Congratulations. You alone have thought of a new innovative idea 
---
1. Never occurred to a multi-billion dollar company
---
2. A subreddit full of salty neck beards
---
Merging servers is a completely new and innovative idea that absolutely has no repercussions. Just ask any pserver players that had the lovely experience of losing their name, friends list, and guild on top of any semblance of stable economy and server progression.
---
vanilla wow was a casual friendly theme park MMO.  it's success was directly related to these qualities
---
That is a good points, but when you design an MMO strictly around vertical progression, what other outcome do you expect. Once the level cap is reached or the raid tier is finished, what is left? That is a concern I have with Classic WoW. The playerbase is so different from 2004. Especially, these hardcore streamers who min/max.
---
I played Silvermoon EU, started alliance and ended up joining &lt;Turncoats&gt; to even out the Alliance/Horde ratio before xrealm BG.
---
Wow had no where near that amount in vanilla, get your head out of your arse, those are TBC numbers. We all love vanilla but be realistic.
---
or mega servers
---
People defending this because it's only "a few months tops" is mind boggling. How far the classic community has fallen at this point.
---
I’d also like to add, even though you’re more viable in PvP than PvE, if you do the High Warlord grind there’s zero itemization for you at rank 14.
---
Source: rank 13 feral.
---
What if Angwe was played by 3 people who now decided to roll 3 separate characters?
---
chill dawg i was jokin
---
Except in group PVP, it is expected your group ALSO is helping you. Melee can be controlled with slows and roots. Spellcasters are much more difficult to control. So if your group supports you properly, they can keep melee off you and casters won't be able to touch you either. 
---
Not to mention his setup has decent armor bonuses too, so with 20-25% physical DR and Soul Link, melee aren't exactly training you either
---
This is not true, players never give a DHK no matter the level spread. DHKs in vanilla are reserved for certain specific NPCs only. Generally ones that would be considered "civilians."
---
Youd still have to run around an area filled with others, lotus can NOT be abused like nodes can. Do people actually think they'll be able to abuse this to such an extreme too??? Like ouuu you'll get a few extra nodes from mining, and a few extra lotus maybe. Only thing that is gonna do is drop prices because of the such high supply.
---
Holy fuck...
---
Read the rules:
---
&gt; 4) Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour.
---
Ive seen that on rule34
---
No need for the hostility. Undead are preferred for PvP because in addition to have WotF they have DP which adds shadow damage and sustain.
---
Very slightly, really. It's better dps for the raid to have a resto do that and take another dps class.
---
Not exactly the same but similar.
---
I originally rolled a human warrior after reading through the box manuals and stuff and got through elwynn and westfall after several days of playing. Nearly as soon as I stepped into Redridge my character died and a zombie with a mohawk appeared before me and began to eat my corpse to my horror and amazement. It was from that moment I knew what I really wanted to play in the game. Had to delete my warrior(alliance) to make a horde character and I played that UD rogue like a total shitass all the way until Cataclysm. I was so terrible in the early days, but it was so fun being able to backstab or ambush oneshot lowbies and cannibalize them.
---
I kinda wanna go to zones right off the bat and be the first person to ever visit these zones ya know
---
it's a beta, its a quality assurance process.. why treat it as something else?
---
I'm not in the beta but I would actually prefer if streamers weren't allowed to stream anything from the beta and actually treat it like a proper beta test.
---
Posts like these scare me, why would we even consider changing anything just because tryhard streamers get everything they want with maximum in-game privileges? 
---
They make it look easy, they are often forced to rush through the main focus of the game just to stay ahead of the curve and min/max everything with BiS.
---
Just sit back, ignore streamers and enjoy the game as it is intended when it is released.
---
Actually surprised so many people still don't understand that layering is not about having 5x more people at all levels.
---
Aw man.. I didn’t mean to come off as elitist or that I know anything someone else doesn’t or that they’ll be put in their place. Not being able to show tone sucks. My apologies to anyone if it seems that way. I just personally remember setting goals of “I want to get this level and I’m not stopping until I do”. 15 hours later I wake up with the keyboard stuck to my face, imprints of keys in my face, and a puddle of drool on the floor..lol. 
---
There probably are many people who play private that will excel faster than most. I honestly didn’t even account for them. Like knowing the fastest ways to level, where to go, etc. I honestly wish them the best experience they can have..I’m hoping it will be more entertaining than a private server..I’ve never played one personally, so I don’t know how the competition or progression is on them. 
---
Thanks for another viewpoint my friend!
---
And Shadowguard proc's blackout if you're planning on going tri-spec or shadow.
---
It's a pretty huge advantage honestly.
---
EU servers are just Blizzard's way of influencing Brexit.
---
It will take a long run for Wow to overtake League tbh
---
 - Stress test client   
---
 - Stress test is over   
---
 - All realms are offline.
---
In the original open beta I watched a gnome rogue run through a tauren warrior over and over again. Tauren player was keyboard turning, so it looked like the gnome was just running through his legs over and over and stabbing him, and the tauren was too big and slow to react. It's great imagery.
---
If anything Retail is a theme park MMO. Retail has a fix path layed down for you, while Classic puts you into a world to leave your mark on it.
---
Yeah no i'd rather wait in que.
---
Am going with find gnomes, Aimed shot when they are fighting a mob and low hp
---
everybody was able to participate in the classic stress test as long if you had a wow account, since you were only marked for the stress test that’s the error screen you get
---
Or you can just make more servers like a smart person. I will take server merges over layering any day of the week
---
Shadowguard is amazing lol. It scales super well with damage, and if you bind rank 1 and keep it up it's basically a permanent low mana aura that makes all attacks, spells and ranged attacks have a 10% chance to stun your attacker.
---
&gt; In order for workers to have any sorts of rights in America they need to have a union, and there is currently nobody fighting for the rights of Game developers
---
Game developers should be fighting for game developers. That's what a union is. If they feel their work conditions are unsatisfactory, go on strike. That's how unions work. If the classic team is being overworked, go on strike. I definitely won't be paying for classic if the game is released in it's current unfinished state.
---
this guy wants megaservers and I do too
---
Perplexity played dwarf for 2 years, and hes lost to Payo 4 times on stream now. Just because you made some flashy pvp videos it doesnt make you the best.
---
Retail BAD
---
Classic GUD
---
This would be more likely #thanksbush but even then not really cause Twitter didn’t exists. 15 years is a long time
---
my very first character I somehow wandered out of the Valley of Trials and saw Ratchet, the sea, and the small river that separates Durotar and Barrens. I sauntered down the hill to explore more by the river and was slaughtered by a lvl ?? crocolisk. I then realized I probably should not have wandered that way and returned to my rightful leveling grounds.
---
Server merges are dumb.  You'd rather play on a dead server, have your community suddenly destroyed because 30-50% of the population is suddenly new because they merged one or two other dead servers with yours.  That's your "fix"?  
---
You'd rather all of that happen then someone appear or disappear?  "Oh noes, a BG ended, and suddenly the premade that was in a BG just appeared before me!" -- "WTF!  10 people just vanished! FUCK THIS -- what?  They just all went into Warsong?  Oh, nevermind."
---
People that say the game is ruined for them because some appears are liars.  People have always just appeared or disappeared.  So have mobs.  The game has always worked like that.  These exact numbers at these exact times in these exact spots?  No.  But it doesn't matter, because it's always been a part of the game.
---
You are just intentionally trying to make yourself not like Classic if people appearing is your deal breaker.  No one will care if you don't play because of it.
---
Is 2-3 months of layering really capable.of destroying a game that is supposed to last 2+ years?
---
Suppose there are 8 layers on one serer. That's 8 times the amount of resources for people who reach level 60 early. Even bots can't increase their return by that much.
---
There are only like 3,000 people playing the beta.
---
Salty, delicious rogue tears OMNOMNOM
---
I tend to lean in that thinking as well, that Horde players are looking for a more aggressive play style. I say that even as a particularly aggressive Alliance PvPer, but I get frustrated by how passive people can be in general chat when WPvP happens on my faction.
---
That said I think it certainly differs from server to server. A single, but large, Alliance PvP guild can tip the scales as far as who has a harder time with WPvP on a particular server.
---
phone bad
---
Worst ones for me were the ones just southeast of the inn by the lake in redridge mountains
---
Just go on strike 4Head
---
Troll's look retarded but their casting animation is the best part!
---
*sees people raiding without lag*
---
"Oh its 2019."
---
Blizz has the capability of having servers with 20k+ people on it or more.
---
Dont tell me it cant when pservers that are ran in some guys basement in a foreign country can. When suddenly a company that is being paid 15 dollars a month by 100,000 people cant. 
---
We should be discussing having mega servers. At least one. WITHOUT population cap. WITHOUT layering. I think it is doable.
---
The problem is that releases are built for the "customer" and not necessairly for playerbase. I understand that we feel like we are the "customer", but we aren't. The people who own/run/invest in these companies are the customers for these products. They are essentially buying the companies time, resources, and manpower to make them things that will give them a reutrn on their invest. We are just the vessels for that return. 
---
Deadlines are meant for those individuals, not us. At the end of the day, a week, month, or even year pushback of a product doesn't matter to you and I. However, for the actual "customer" this means millions of dollars. So ensuring that products come out on time gives the customers confidence in Blizzard/Activision/Software Companies. I think one people realize that we aren't the reason these AAA title games get made, the better of we will be with our expectations.
---
Oh please stop with the twitch emotes, we cant fucking see them here..
---
I forgot alllll about "applying" to guilds. Guild applications in Vanilla and BC gave me more anxiety than my college apps.
---
I think you are better off opening with bleeds on orc warriors, jokes aside.
---
those ergonomics look horrible.

My guild literally had to hold turn-in competitions where we'd raid boost the top 10 contributors in MC to get the general populace help with the turn-in shit. (They'd send stuff to us instead of turning it in, and accumulate points they could trade in for MC/BWL boosts).
---
Maybe. Are me you?
---
I thought this was changed in 2.0.1?
---
And ruined the game for people more than a few weeks of layering would.
---
Lose your name because someone else on other server has it. Now no one outside of your guild remembers you.
---
Losing your guild name for the same reason.
---
People manipulating the economy. Server merges can make you rich buying items on your server that are cheaper than others before a merge and selling them off after.
---
All of a sudden months in having hundreds of players you've never played with/seen before
---
Yes. None of those things matter. Only thing that matters is you complaining about layering.
---
It sounds like the sacrifice is worth it on the whole. Truly, all I want is a modest home with some land around nature. Also some flexibility in my schedule. I have entertained the idea of diving more into IT, however I ponder if it would be in vain if my goal is to live in a small town. What are your thoughts on that, if you have the time to answer?
---
I was in High School from 2005 - 2008, and even "the cool kids" athletes/etc played WoW. And all the girls knew about all the guys playing WoW too. I'd say it was mainstream even in Vanilla. This was with a High School that had 2500 people. (Largest in my state.)
---
Classic WoW is Pane #1 leading into Pane #2.
---
except when you're about to die, just switch layers bro!!
---
are you wearing a red shirt by chance?
---
Yea resident evil vs resident evil 6, 2 totally different games but people still compare them
---
the cancer of the internet, always wrong and can't admit it, but hey its worth ruining games for millions if it means never having to admit to yourself you're a greedy little shit head.
---
Good lord the ignorance. Toss in Totem of Wrath and Wrath of Air totem, congrats elemental shaman is now raid viable. However, any shaman  in a BG that's dropping totem's of wrath instead of novas and wrath of air's instead of WF for the melee is basically playing for the other team. This notion that you can't make vanilla's terrible pve-specs raid viable seems to forget that TBC even existed.
---
Totally forgot that, thank you.
---
I think you are drastically overthinking it.
---
You shouldn't use the summoned mount if you plan on pvping...
---
The mount is summoned via spell so curse of tongues will slow you down, you can mount up when oom, and casting the mount will stop your Mana regen.
---
If there are fixed spawn locations and spawn times, you can control it pretty well. Also, you can collude with the other factions as mentioned. People say blizzard will take action against this, but I honestly am not sure of that.
---
Respawns yes, other stuff is really the same. Better than the past really.
---
Yeah I realised it, I left it up to sort of discourage people being too brutal early on to lowbies lol.
---
You want starting zones with 3000 people in each one?  That doesn't sound like fun.
---
"No u"
---
Feral charge is one of your most important abilities as a Druid.
---
It's an interrupt. It's a root. It's an escape tool. All in one. 
---
Swiftmend is huge. I cannot overstate how much it changed my druid when it was first introduced to replace innervate as the final resto talent. I will never play my druid again without it :).
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Barrens.chat is a good one with less complaining than here.
---
That sounds fun! I don't plan to make a guild, because it's too time consuming. But if you find such a guild, let me know, I'd love to have a char there.
---
Er, no. Voidwalker laughs at this analysis - well, at least until I sac him for a 3k shield and .5 sec cast a replacement to reestablish soul link. The imp literally couldn't be hit. Succubus was invisible and could be left on stay, out of harm's way. That's 3 of our 4 pets that prove the BS in your assertion. I guess you only ever attacked 'locks with a felhunter out?  
---
Protip for those who didn't actually play vanilla; Warlocks were not reskinned huntards. But sure, sit there and spam Whirlwind. See how far that gets you against a SL warlock.
---
If im not mistaken, you counted 360 hours for farming rep and then another 3 days/played for 5 people farming rep - i dont understand why.
---
Most of the 5/10/15/40 man bosses you mentioned do not take an hour. From Orgrimmar/Ironforge to the thing and killing it is maybe 30 minutes - at most.
---
Also all the Elite farming for the draconic language books is much less tedious than you think.
---
So ill give you that if you count total hours over all the people involved it might reach 600-800 hours. If you look at it in real time tho a guild can complete all the steps (after the initial rep grind) in a few days. Aka less then 50 hours /played.
---
You are doing it backwards.  Use the questline to get the skill but buy a regular epic mount to use
---
No, they're not. 
---
People overeat pretty much solely because of emotional problems.
---
Short term would be a few days, but they want to have it for month!
---
I'm sure you worked your ass off, yeah.
---
What was your name in PDx?

Also in john staats book he basically says they worked until 10pm every monday and wednesday for 4 years. 
---
Then on top of that their crunch was til 10 pm 4+ days a week and with the real committed coming in on weekends. This was prior to press releases (like E3)
---
At least they provided pizza for the late nights.
---
So you want to pay an extra $15 just so you can avoid a few silver in gear damage?
---
Time lapse was the easiest tho. Free Agro wipes!
---

The extent of the info we have from Blizz on how long layering will be is: hopefully just at the start of release, and certainly wont be used during phase 2.
---
Its probably going to be used as long as there are enough people to make the playing experience awful for people. Depends on how many and for how long the "Classic Tourists" play
---
This happened on thunderlord US too, though they didn't demand money. I think the guy with the scepter hearthed after the entire server had met up for the ringing, and he came back later with just the guild and did it in the middle of the night.
---
I agree, we all want the exploits fixed.  However, I think most overreact.  Saying that it could destroy the balance of the economy and the server.  But you have to also assume blizzard is aware of the possible exploits and can be ready with the banhammer.  They could have developed some sort anti-cheat software to detect abusers.
---
Fixing the exploits of layers is difficult to do without impact other areas of the game (like most of the "suggestions" or "fixes" we see proposed here).  I think it's probably easier to detect and ban cheaters than it is to make it 100% exploit-free.  And seeing as the end goal is to remove layers entirely, this could very well be their approach.
---
3 days /played @ 5 people = 360 hours. I didn't count it twice.
---
Any padding of the estimates is still less than travel and organizing time. And this is assuming you don't have multiple attempts.
---
Lips are the best!
---
&gt; If there are fixed spawn locations and spawn times, you can control it pretty well.  
---
thats not how Black Lotuses used to work iirc.
---
&gt; They will probably make an example of a guild 
---
I think they wont do anything, even if exploited/controlled heavily :/
---
Someone had that bug in AV on the AV weekend. I saw a wisp coming at me and figured "Oh, odd. Guess he's running to his corpse to manually release, after losing their graveyard" just to be backstabbed to death by a wisp two seconds after.
---
I was so confused lol
---
"No reply"
---
I'm assuming by then they will have an official realm list out? Might be a good time to coordinate with your friends.
---
I popped a lip...pew pew...you die
---
While you agreed with me on principle, for some reason I feel less comfortabe than before. (jk)
---
ya, the economy is a huge mess atm. about 75% of US population lives check to check its gr8. Unemployment rate doesn't dictate quality of life unfortunately
---
Aw shit, here we go again.
---
The problem is that this isn't necessarily a numbers issue. Bugs in code aren't like a pile of rocks that need to be moved. You an't just throw more bodies at the problem and expect the work to be completed faster.
---

---
Everyone says this, and while it's not a bad idea...this is basically what sharding is.  The biggest difference is that layers are world-specific, while shards are zone-specific.  And seeing how they developed layering specifically for Classic, I doubt this will be an option.
---
Especially considering how pointless it felt once you finally had the gear... and then you fight a priest and realize you'll never make a dent
---
Leveling is really half the experience.
---
Go for the real grind and get rank14 ;)
---
Yup. He's been at it for a month now with this account. And his crap rip posts go to the top everytime.
---
No, he wants to pay an extra $15 just so he can avoid making friends.
---
My advise, unless you are a *rockstar* programer, you are trying to compete with India and China for the same job they are willing to do for 5 grand a year.
---
If you want to do physical stuff, like wiring, PC repaire, ect, you would get more work for more money as an electrician. 
---
But truly, if you can make due and gain job exp where you are, there are rural places like the Mid West who need their 10+ year veteran IT people, and are willing to pay for them and will provide that nature you want. 
---
All in all, I took my degree and couldn't find entry level jobs here (West Wisconsin). Many of my classmates left the town for the bigger twin cities or went to work for Epic in Madison and slept on couches cause they are making 12 an hour, and the top of the class people got the 1 or 2 decent internships that turned into good jobs at the hospitals and banks.  If you are not exceptional, I would avoid IT.  If you are exceptional, or can scrape by at a job that pays shit, till you cut your teeth, you can do ok.  (but FYI, a 4 year electrician makes 65K a year here and the union has $20 co-pay medical)
---
BWL gear druids don't "kill mages in an opener", they aren't rogues. If they know the fight is coming mana shield helps, if we add in items like grenades that can favor the mage as they only need a few seconds to gain a big advantage, the druid has to have constant pressure.
---
Hey Malt, I used this on realm 15 -- the busiest realm in the lands. We were able to still get server first 15 on stress test. My 1-10 was under 1:44 and my final time was 4:45 (I didnt play it well). The Tauren starting area is great if you login, hustle asap and follow these steps.
---
playing UD rogue on Lights Hope rn, WotF is incredibly useful if you are gonna be out ganking. Locks and spriests will instinctually fear you away when your stuns wear off, WotF totally blocks thatw ithout wasting your pvp trinket
---
Classes being strong in certain areas and weak in other areas is a key factor in good MMO design. If the balance of the game is centered around PVE content, this will inherently create imbalances in PVP content. If it were the other way around, it would have adverse effects on PVE content. 
---
That's the way it goes and that's OK with the vast majority of us.
---
I think you mean "friendships will be neglected"
---
it's a good idea, but zone-specific layers is basically what sharding is. No way they are gonna do this considering they developed layering specifically to keep the entire world together.

Hi, I am looking for a pseudo hardcore raiding guild doing atleast 2+ nights a week of progression. I plan to play Paladin if alliance and druid if horde; specing healing for raids with enough points to tank for dungeons. Also interested particularly in guilds aiming for server firsts as I have booked the first 2 weeks off of classic while I've been routing the last couple months on beta/private servers. Please pm, 
---
Thanks
---
Baseline 1 str = 2 ap, it becomes 2.4 if you spec 5/5 HotW because HotW increases your total str.
---
also bad at the game
---
Gets destroyed by Warrior+Paladin or Warlock+Paladin.
---
They tried spinning a question on Jeopardy about Leeroy, out of 3 people, 3 of them had a blank stare, mind you it was a college championship as well. 
---
It definitely wasn't a trend, at least not in Florida, BC and wrath is when people started openly talking about it here. Consoles were the cool thing where I was, nobody cared about socializing online with a bunch of other people they probably didn't know, they all wanted to bring over a controller.
---
I said this in another comment, but I'll mention it here as well. For smaller companies, I agree with your sentiment. It is in the companies best interest to not drive their workers too hard and to put out quality content. For larger companies, the project managers, team leads, design leads, developers.... They answer to one all powerful being. Investors. You may feel like you're the "customer" when it comes t a video game like WoW, but you aren't. You are merely the vessel for the real customer to get their return on the money they invested.
---
You can use the stuck command as many times as you want, it'll put your hearthstone on CD if that's up though.
---
To be fairrrrrr
---
Why are you talking about narratives it’s a fucking meme lol
---
Even if what you described was possible.  It would be so easy for blizzard to detect and ban these people.  It's shouldn't even be a concern, but people think it will ruin the game.
---
There is no way to guarantee that each of your accounts will always be in separate layers.  Also, you’re willing to pay $15/month on the off chance a separate account can mitigate a few inconvenient deaths?
---
Regret?
---
Woops, thought we were naming prophets.
---
I can do that for free.
---
Being obsessed with other peoples’ opinions to the point of lying to satisfy yourself is disgusting, fake, and as a concept needs to die.
---
The only thing that makes the playing experience awful for people is layering past level20!
---
You're likely to shift to a layer where you agro the same mob only now it has 100% hp.
---
If we are talking about the same posts, the ones about international realms, there weas barely any confronting or racist inside. Those 1% could have been muted one by one. Instead you decided to block the whole conversation, one with high importance for many players. In my opinion your behavior was worse, than that of some few, that nobody cared about.
---
He's not undervaluing shamans, paladins literally never run out of mana as healers and have a ton of defensive cooldowns to help keep themselves and others alive.

Ohhhh man. This brings back some memories. Such terrific storytelling.
---
But isn't that also part of the appeal, all the server issues, low-spawning mobs.
---
Will remind us of what it was really like back then :)
---
I always read this, but blizzard can very easily detect and ban this type of behavior.  Idk why people are freaking out about this.  If it's really the case that people exploit it to such degree, people just assume blizzard is gonna be cool with that?
---
Why doesn't he just dual-box, and use his other character to keep himself alive?
---
Gank people who are a much lower level.
---
Hopefully they allow people to make alts of the opposing faction so you can get a ton of hate messages.
---
A skilled Hunter, no doubt about that. But a Gnome Mage could have also used cover to blow one of you up, and then poly'd one while kiting the other 2 warriors with Blink, CoC, and Novas and smart use of Coldsnap. With Ice Block and Barrier, I feel like he could survive quite well and stay in both your deadzones easily, especially if he had EA. He could probably kill those two warriors in a couple shatters, while the 3rd is still sheeped.
---
A skilled Warlock might be able to 1v4 you guys as well, depending on his spec and gear level.
---
Classic 2.0
---
He was just layered too hard

---
yes, all of the 4 horde priest racials procc blackout. 
---
but touch of weakness and shadow guard are the only spells who can procc blackout passively as a reaction to an attack. thats special and there is nothing comparable for allie priests.
---
difference is, that shadow guard is triggered by every kind of attack, while touch of weakness does it only against melee attacks.
---
As I've explained in this thread again, we used this exact path on realm 15 during the stress test and got wf 15. There is literally no mob competition after camp narache, so efficiently starting out strong is the way to play. I made a ton of mistakes in my 1-6 and still had no competition after that area.
---
I was going to play a hunter at the release, with everything they've done so far i'll be a good little stealthy rogue
---
Played  enhance shammy for a long time and want something similar in classic, since enhance is kind of trash for pve. Was thinking rogue might be similar in style? Thoughts?

We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.    
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.   Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message.     
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.   
---
 We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

---
You leave no mark in Classic/vanilla. One could argue you leave more of a mark in retail with the changing of the zones as you quest.
---
You know the reasons. It's either merges or layers, and Blizzard went with layers.
---
The only reason I disliked legion is because it still contained all the same things that made me start to dislike WoW. I hate the idea of dailies and love the idea of reputation farming through other means. I hate the idea of Titan forging and love the idea of actually getting a BiS and being done with that gear slot. I hate the fact that dungeon finder is generally how groups are formed and that at any point you can get grouped with someone from realms that aren’t native English speakers... I loved the fact that while you’re leveling in classic you generally meet others, do quests with them, talk about life and then form a dungeon group to complete quest chains. 
---
Classic has the ability to create such a satisfying and meaningful experience. A lot of people talk about it like it’s some drug, some terrible addiction, but the reality is that after growing up experimenting with drugs, partying, going through girlfriends, etc... the thing I most closely relate my experiences in classic with is being with my family on a fun trip or being out with friends camping. There’s something incredibly adventurous and personal about it that makes it much more than a video game. 
---
I met and bonded with so many people playing WoW and what’s funny is that I’m still friends with most of them. Whereas the people I met in high school, college, partying etc... have all kind of faded away because our experiences together were fun but generally pretty empty.
---
It’ll be really cool to see what playing again is like after I’ve lived through 10+ years without it.
---
Multiple branches? **blasphemy**
---
Everyone knows there is only one working version of code at any given time
---
Sorry I wasn't explicit. I did not mean lvl30+ zones, I meant lvl 30+ players. The layers would still be contenent wide.
---
I see this as an absolute win. You get the bump uglies with the woman of your dreams and skip all of the first week bullshit and can come start playing when the tourists leave.
---

I've got an fx 9590, gtx 970 and 32gb of ram and I had mad screen tearing no matter the settings on the stress test and I'm not really sure why.
---
Every 3rd grader's presidential strategy: "Why don't we just print more money??"
---
I imagine if you could alter the boats path and not get detected then they probably didn't have much detection going on. I was young and wow was my after school life. I didn't want to risk being banned.
---
Parallel universes for different expansions... Count me in... lets go Morty
---
The drop rates of most of those quests are lower. In TBC Blizzard increased the drop rate for quest items as part of speeding up the path to 60 for new players. Most private servers use TBC as the reference for quest rep gains, experience, and quest item drop rates because they don't have anything else.
---
So say you have 5 layers running. Layer 1,2,3,4=Players level 1-29. Layer 5=All Players level 30-60.
---
stress test is over bro
---
Besides you playing alliance I think we would be a good fit. If you are open to switching factions, I'd love to have a discussion about your classic plans.

Those are all control classes who excel at cc and 1v1's.  If you want to pair a paladin with something, they will do best with the heavy hitters who will benefit most from their blessing of freedom, cleanses, and heals.  So warrior or lock.
---
Until the resto is in melee with the tank when they needed to be back at range
---
Those are the only counters against these comps, though?
---
My guild got HoR on second rag kill ever but never saw TF. We DID get a rogue from another guild who had TF which pissed our main tank off something big lol
---
Seconded
---
But /u/boduar didn't say straight to live. They just said batching them, which is what everyone does for development unless the bug is catastrophic like a 0 day security exploit. I don't know how Blizzard does things, but they must have internal QA even before releasing it to the Beta build. Because as you said, programming is hard.
---
Oh yeah for sure. And that's all the more reason to make sure the product is good enough to live up to it's value. By never pre-ordering and by being critical towards companies that have a history of failing expectations or being consumer-unfriendly.
---
I mean I guess, if you happen to wander into the arena in STV, Gadget, DM.  But otherwise, no.  There aren't Horde Blood Elves in Vanilla.

**&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an **EU PVP Alliance** guild that intends to aim high in Classic. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
**What to expect;**
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it, and we do it properly. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. Although we hold heavy emphasis on PvE content, PvP will not be absent from the guild's many activities. As for our activities, our members are not expected to, but are encouraged to join us as we embark on many open world journeys!

I vaguely remember this as well. Then much later one we learned a new way to killed the drakes and just always one shotted them. Something about grouping up by the throne.

Lol, nice callout on those moving goalposts of his. +1  
---
It's cute how he deflects by claiming SL/NF is just for beating warriors when it ruins EVERYTHING in 1v1, and is a great multitarget spec for BG's and WPvP (specifically thanks to its sustain). Also funny how he doesn't know the difference between "low damage" and "low burst". SL/NF had probably the highest sustained damage across multiple simultaneous hostile targets of any build on any class (Thanks again, crazy-good sustain!) and it also had the capacity to get suddenly, tenaciously bursty (Nightfall procs during a SB cast + the first or both bolts crit.)  
---
But it looks like he's just a warrior main, absolutely too dense to understand or accept the obvious. "MELEE GOOD" is all he seems to know.

Thank you yet again, I just realised the cooldown of Swiftymend in Classic is 15s in contrast of 25sec in retail.. **That's insane!!** I mained rogue since Vanilla (but druid was actually my first character) and recently in Legion I went druid healing in pvp and managed to get 60points off 2.4(RBGS) in a single season without having any achieves prior to that (had stopped playing in Wotlk and started Legion and I've never pvp'd seriously). Although the reason I went for druid healing was so I can get achieve tickets for my rogue,  I fell in love with the resto pvp.   
---
So now that I have all this knowledge and practice with the mechanics/macro, I can't wait to pvp heal and be uncatchable and immortal **in a version of the game where everything is way less mongo** while the basic strong points of the druids still remain untouched (and actually even more powerful since now in retail powershift is nerfed).  &lt;3
---
This describes my previous experience with being a tester, and frequently talking to devs. The devs would make a very strong point to tell their project managers that their estimates were \*not\* set in stone. It was especially frustrating because in some cases we weren't just iterating on an existing thing, but doing something that had literally not been done yet (at least not by anyone in the company, and the only other info would be confidential stuff that other companies would keep to themselves). They should have known timetables would be guesswork in some cases. Yet I literally overheard conversations that went like this:   
---
Dev: OK, so I got an idea of how long this will take. I should be done in 3 months. 
---
PM: Oh... well you have to up that, because we already promised it'd be done in a month and a half. Including all of the testing and bug fixing. 
---
\*1 Months later\*
---
Dev: Ya this was actually even more complicated than I originally planned, we can't hit this deadline, or even the timetable I originally suggested.
---
PM: Damn, ok well just keep working I guess.
---
\*4 Months later\*
---
PM: OK, well the guys I promised this to are mad at us and have just cancelled the project/feature. We'll maybe include it in the next generation. 
---
It's the same reason I'm not on player's side about how often and how detailed or transparent devs should be. In a reasonable world devs \*could\* be transparent and things would be chill. In reality their words of "I think I can do it in 2 weeks" will get turned into a commitment. Any delays, or even worse an out right cancellation gets met with rage. If some devs can't even get their message across to their co-workers (potentially), what hope do you think they have of appeasing passionate fans who don't work in software development?
---
None of those things ruined the game for me and I went through 2 server mergers.

Basically you're just entitled

A lot of people are.  Im uneducated, but I see people advocate for both sides religiously.

Goodness I can hardly wait. Seeing this again makes me realize how much Vanilla meant to me and it's like entering a time machine and experience it all again.
---
It was still 10 or 11 days on Nostalrius, with a consolidation of guilds, to get that fast of an MC clear. If the 2 weeks of layering holds, they'll get a whopping 3-4 days of farming. Doubt that will ruin economies for the rest of classic.
---
I see a lot of people talking about racials which are better on the horde side for pvp but Alliance is the better faction because we have paladins.
---
Happened to my guild too. We were like a 2nd tier guild behind the best groups. When the top guilds needed a new tank or something they'd take ours.
---
I was like 15 years old at the time but I tried to tell my guild leader we should just gear up like 6 tanks and take a bunch of tanks into raids since we had MC and BWL on farm. At the time it was a stupid idea I guess but I can see it being viable these days. Having several tanks per guild

Warrior/Shaman is pretty amazing too.  If a Warrior gets heals from a shaman AND has windfury totem dropped for him, good luck trying to live through those windfury procs.
---
Same :) though it'll take some time getting used to "For the Alliance." I'll also switch main (though considering classic alts are probably a no-go) and try Mage (played priest, lock, pala before). New faction, new class and new game (I started playing early TBC). Lok'tar Ogar!
---
/u/jaredletosombrehair isn't wrong. Classic is the theme-parkiest MMO of it's time. The goal posts have changed now, and it almost begins to look like a sandbox, but compared to actual sandboxes it really isn't one. It's just a very good themepark, using just enough sandbox elements to make a *really* good balance.
---
Layering isnt a big deal. You're just entitled.
---
Destroying doesn't have to mean physical confrontation, it can simply mean "better than".
---
I've never seen a mage who could 4 v 1 effectively.  There's just too many available warrior charges and it's a lot easier to follow a frost bolt back to cover than an aimshot.
---
I think the idea behind layering is to avoid the inevitable server merges that would have taken place months after launch. Eventually when the tourists get bored with le hidden gem that is classic wow they'll go back to BFA or whatever they're playing and the layers will get smaller and smaller until they no longer exist. The only other alternative is to have a ton of servers and then when the tourists leave you have to start announcing server merges which would be a colossal shitstorm and all the dumbasses with sub zero IQ's will say classic wow was a failure ect ect. If anything layering is actually proof that blizzard is taking this seriously. If Jay Allen Brack wanted to be a petty bitch he would have just let the scenario I described play out and he could say "I told you so" and pull the plug on Classic.

IIRC, fixed spawn time per zone, in one of many locations in the zone. You would have to have multiple toons camping each spot.
---
All 3 are good combos. Blessing of Freedom is great for mage and hunter. I'd say rogue is the weakest in that combo though. A rogue receiving heals is pretty good, but against other healer + dps class combos you will have a harder time. Rogues excel in 1v1 situations while hunters and mages can CC one person long enough to burn down another.
---
&gt; Destroying doesn't have to mean physical confrontation
---
Well not with that attitude.
---
OMG lol that's awful. So basically these comps are just... bad?
---
Warlock+Paladin a little better at least? What spec?
---
Yeah its not ideal. But what about 3 hour long Q times or 50 other players in the same mine as you making your quest take an extra 1.5 hours?
---
I think alts are pretty reasonable if one of the two classes is a face-roll easy leveling class.
---
I plan on maining a NE Warrior Tank and a Human Mage Alt. The Mage alt will level super easy when I need a break from my tank and also be good for making some spare gold along the way.

I have a lot of bad feelings against the murlocs in STV near Gromgol that jump you when you fall down the ditch.
---
Lol what?
---
I played classic as a raiding shaman and let me assure that Pallida are much better for classic raids for two big reasons:
---
“Infinite” mana is not a joke, once geared Pallies don’t actually run out of mana.
---
Blessings.  
---
Blessings effect the whole raid.  Kings and wisdom are the ones everyone points to (and the fact that it is easy to compare the stats between blessings and totems).  But the real differentiator is **blessing of salvation.**
---
Threat is a real limiter in classic for the entire expansion.  Alliance mages, warlocks, and fury warriors essentially get to do 30% more damage before having to worry about threat, and since threat is an issue in 99% of raid bosses, it puts alliance laughably far ahead when it comes to raiding
---
I'm sure he isn't doing all of those at once. It can be nice having a guide open on one screen while doing the task on another. You could have music playing in the background during that too. 
---
Personally I like to watch anime or netflix while doing world quests or levelling since those are simple tasks that take very little of my attention. Having two or more monitors is a very useful thing.
---
Any quest involving collecting lots of pages for a book...
---
I love The Missing Diplomat. Right up until the point it finishes, and I go 'huh'. I will offer sexual favours to Omar if in a later update that quest line gets can actual conclusion.
---
guess im just better at using my rested xp lol
---
I want to be elemental for pvp, and will be restored for raids because it's what the class is best for and I enjoy healing raids. If I didnt enjoy healing I'd roll something else.
---
I feel that the leeway mechanic is just as bad if not worse than most hunter bugs.  I feel really bad for the hunters out there.
---
GF and Rollin Shaman + Warrior Combo, its gonna be sick
---
You dont think, say, a MM or BM Hunter would fit into this category? I figured their one weakness (the deadzone/melee range) could be negated by Freedom. They hit hard, have lots of tools, ways to peel for the Paladin, etc.?
---
I've leveled multiple characters to 30 but none to 40 because I don't want to bother with that (and have no friends playing) just for it to get wiped.
---

---
I vaguely recall a blacksmith quest where you found an item sticking out of the lava in a hidden room in LBRS. That's my pick.
---
Kinda hard to say. Traditionally, it's always been down to the individual server and which side had the biggest PvP guilds. Let's take the last big private server--a big portion of the community's veteran PvPers rolled alliance together and formed a guild comprised in large part of the kinds of players who grind for R14 on every server. So many of them were in that one guild that the horde barely had any. So alliance won the server's PvP scene from the very beginning. If they'd gone horde, it would have been horde that won.
---
That said, there are some factors that can play into the distribution. I haven't really worked out the exact dynamics yet, because it feels like they don't all apply to every server even when it's the same community, but here are some considerations:
---
- Alliance is considerably stronger in PvE, which means competitive hardcore guilds are more likely to go alliance for min-maxing purposes. Those players are also more likely to be hardcore PvPers, so there tend to be more alliance premades.
---
- Paladin is a far better PvP healer than shaman. This gives alliance an advantage in BGs, but not so much in world PvP since a holy paladin running around alone isn't dangerous to anyone whereas shamans are better than paladins at ganking and other kinds of random PvP out in the world.
---
- Horde has more PvP players in total, so they tend to have long BG queues. This is another reason for hardcore PvPers to roll alliance: instant queues. As a result, horde has more people looking for WPvP while alliance can sit in a city all day doing BGs. It's kind of a double-dipping effect: more PvPers and more time for WPvP.
---
- The geography hugely favors alliance. All the horde cities have easy backdoors to their faction leaders, so alliance raids can just sneak in and kill them whereas the alliance cities are extremely difficult to invade with a raid because you have to fight your way through the front gates and all the way into the back of the city. 
---
- Also, alliance has much better access to most of the first half of vanilla raiding. MC, BWL and ZG are right next to alliance capitals which makes it more convenient for them to control these zones and move there quickly to ambush a rival horde raid, or just get into the raid itself more easily than horde raiders who have to set their hearthstone in the Kargath inn in Badlands because the trip from Undercity to BRM takes like twenty fucking minutes.
---
- Horde racials are a bit better suited for WPvP because they're more universally useful. Tauren stomp and extra hp, orc stun resist, even WotF is useful against several classes. By comparison, the only alliance racial that's broadly useful is for gnome melees while human and dwarf racials pretty much only target rogues. Fear Ward is nice in premades but not that great in WPvP where you're often alone.
---
But like I said, all of these things can be outweighed by a server's demographics. They're also things that applied only to retail vanilla and private servers, and we don't really know what form the PvP dynamics of Classic realms will take. Population size, cross-realm BGs and Twitch culture might create a completely different PvP enrivonment from what evolved over the years up until now.
---
I missed IO when they left Sargeras to go to Detheroc. Thanks for reminding me of this classic moment.
---
Usually SM/Ruin, no real need for Soul Link if you have a pocket healer.
---
whatever you say buddy
---
Only problem I have with that is people would eventually try to find a way to exploit it in some way.

I think simply having objectives like the did in BC would be great. Control a contested zone and get a buff for the hour.

I see you are completely missing the point. People aren't making a big deal out of this joke, people are sick of having the same garbage jokes on the frontpage of this sub every. Single. Day.
---
From the day Blizzard announced classic /r/classicwow is obsessed with hating on retail 24/7. On top of that people on this sub are desperately looking for retail players that shit on classic, to the point where they claim retail players who are NEUTRAL about classic are also hating on classic and want it to fail.
---
You'd think people who are hyped for the re-release of a 14 year old game would be a bit mature than that, but this sub is a fucking cesspool of insecure manchildren its' fucking sad and pathetic.
---
I got my 60 warlock mount the night before TBC dropped! Felt good
---
10 silver please, need to learn sword skill.
---
It literally wouldn't, because the person actually having to view the model, is the same person that opted to toggle it on - meaning they actually *like* the new models.
---
You either haven't thought this "extreme" opinion through, and are just biting at the chance to shit on the new models.  Hate them all you want, but boycotting because of a toggle doesn't make any rational sense.
---
huh

Class quests in general, I just like the feel and vibe of questing to enhance your class specifics from totems to forms and mounts etc....

Layer the starting zones and thats it.  Once people hit westfall, barrens, silverpine, loch modan, or darkshore then let the sh*tshow begin.

I liked all the pvp except for arenas. You could choose your flavor. Quick and dirty honor grinding in AB or a day long struggle in AV. Personally, i preferred AV. It was very immersive, and we could team up with the other top tiered raid guild that we squabbled with. In 2006 there were really only 2 horde raid guilds on the server i was on, believe it or not! Plus the AV gear rewards were the best for raiding.
---
Weren't the goons on venture co? At least a big chunk of them?
---
i'm gonna play it again, didn't know there was a 2game lol, but you should link this one:
---
https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/574187
---
it has the Stranglethorn Fever expansion, you can find the link of the 2 game there too.
---
1) You leave no permanent mark on the world in classic the closest you can come is leaving a mark or the community. Which does not make a sandbox.
---
2) Classics endgame if you want the best gear is a fixed path that is laid down for you. You start in dungeons then progress down the line of raids, just like it is in retail.
---
Shit joke
---
Adding completely different things like this to the game kind of defeats the purpose of a *Classic* server, don't you think?
---
Thought it was supposed to be the vanilla experience again, not the vanilla experience plus some battle royale mechanics.
---
Yeah, that was our other other "wow diet" where you forget to eat. Or I'd have a rotary pizza cooker, set a pizza, forget about it and find it spinning the next morning. At least it wouldn't overcook and burn them.
---
Not all work, and in particular developer work, is about having more bodies. Lots of times devs on my team (not a team I ran, I was just a tester) would reject more people working with them on a particular task. Simply because what they were working on is not exactly a task you can cleanly split up without causing more issues. Yet that single task could be blocking other devs from even starting on other scheduled tasks (like in cases where the architecture or underlying tech was changing or just being developed from scratch).
---
Not everything is about hiring more people. 
---
Sometimes if you are behind you're choice is either overtime, or delay. I think it should be delay, but I'm of course not the guy making those choices.
---
All of those pve classes work in pvp as well, aside from arguably alliance locks (but they’re still good imo) Pally is also superb in pve, just as a healer. Druid sucks in everything but can do everything so it’s meh
---
Have a look at lenovo thinkpads. My t420 cost $100 and i are fully upgradable. You can hook up an external graphics card with a gdc adapter. Bit of a project but definitely worth it if you're up for it.

I remember finding a treasure map in a sunken ship in westfall.i only did it once like 15 years ago but it left an impression.

Any horde representing? I was in &lt;Mist&gt; and it'd great to hear if any of the old guild were planning on playing again.

---
Who summoned those demons.... Oh right orcs. Both factions have been real Mcassholes.
---
Almost nothing you say OP is accurate at all. 
---
You dont understand the tech, sharding and layering are clearly different. Yes they could share code, but they have completely different purposes. Are you a software dev? Yes I am.
---
7 to 1 layers would put 15k people in the same world, so 1000s of people in the same starting zone. You are suggesting they do what your #1 concern is later in your post.
---
Server resources dont work like you think. A "server" like Doomhammer isn't hardware, its software. It can run across multiple physical devices and have physical resources added and removed from it on the fly. So they are not trying to save resources by using some tech. X players is x resources. Maybe certain configs balance better and utilize resources more efficiently for better overall stability, but I highly doubt their underlying reason for layering is cost related. It's about user experience looking at the big picture. Looking for healthy pops on servers a year from now. Reducing needs for disruptive servers merges and transfers.
---
With that said, I agree with your #1 concern. What does it mean for the most popular servers when layering has to be removed @ phase 2? Likely queues and that sucks. But really smart people have spent time debating pros and cons of various options. As a software dev, I think they are making a reasonable choice. Not the only possible choice, but a reasonable one
---
When I was playing stress test the other night they were definitely playing with the layering settings during the evening.
---
In the Mulgore starting area with the boar people I could watch players and mobs phasing in and out constantly (within 20-30 yards or less sometimes) while standing still.
---
I think it's going to be wacky, but I'm going to overlook the first few weeks if they can just turn it off when most of the tourists give up or people start burning out on leveling and stop being on 12-16 hours a day.
---
I mean, in retail that's how War Mode works if you want to quest together.
---
I'm glad I'm not going to be ganked by full tier 2 players while leveling like when I rolled on p servers
---
"After I gain 20 more levels, get some MC gear, some blue pvp gear, my rhok delar bow, and level up engineering this guy is in trouble if he isn't naxx geared by then"

No worries, I'll try figure it out if we get another stress test. 
---
It gave 850 + 70 exploration possibly without a prereq when I did it elsewhere.

Need a poll put up stat asking if you have subbed for beta, stress test, and if you plan to sub for char creation.

It starts off completely random with a wrecked raft in un'goro, I mean why do you even have a raft in un'goro?!?! Anyway, then you go all over kalimdor, you go to winterspring to learn how to get the videre elixir in feralas, then you go to freaking gadgetzan to die and do a quest while dead (only one in the game), back to linken in un'goro and guess what, back all the way to felwood to get the mats, to summon an elemental in fucking tanaris again, and then you end it all by killing a big elemental in un'goro and getting some of the most unique items in the game as a reward.

People are always going to find a way to exploit every system. Doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try something because of it. 
---
That said... I’m a pretty ardent #nochanges person and this.... isn’t awful. 
---
That said, I don’t want to go full retard on mounts and pets. I think the main contents should be gold, rare materials, consumables, honor, and maybe something unique to these chests. 
---
I don’t want the chests to be so valuable that it becomes the only thing people want to do, it should be a side-activity.

While most probably disagree with me this is one of the reasons i'd love to see more 'classic' content, beyond just 'classic' at some point.

&gt; That means they are either working on making it better, or they aren't because there is no better option for them as a company.

Or they don't give a fuck because they are Blizzard after all.

It is a hypothetical if it had existed in the game.

Shit I didn't even think about this, I'm sorry man.  It's looking like I'm going to have to update this map anyways, so I'll see if I can change the horde color.
---
Most wont hit 60 until P2 probably.  Those that do hit 60 during P1 will probably just get their epic mount since it is so important and only a few hundred gold cheaper.
---
Honestly speaking, the pally/lock mounts suck because it resets the mana regeneration timer.  They do look great though.

Youre gonna be disappointed and bored

Class quest or the chicken quest in westfalls
---
Well Classic isn't retail, in fact it's supposed to be radically different.
---
Tbh a lot of people are going to be bored by classic and that is fine it's not a game for everyone and the effort to reward ratio is just too small for some people. Thus why the expected population reduction after only phase 1

That would have been such an OP combo for wpvp.

At 1:23 and the part at 2:30 is also pretty funny how all 3 of them get juked.
---
To be fair, in vanilla we also cleared the first couple of bosses of Naxx in the first week as well.

Naxx the first 7 or so bosses of Naxx were actually much easier to do than finishing aq40 if nothing else, Naxx didn’t force you to spend hours going through trash

Nobody reads the quests because of the UI? Jeez, nobody show those people a book.

I really like the In Dreams quest line with Tyrion Fordring.

Say that to everyone in WoW circa 2004 - 2005. 
---
Plenty of people paid to sit in the queue and then deal with server instability and client-side DCs when they logged in. It was often laggy and unstable, sometimes with 10-15 minute queues at peak times.
---
Oh I agree. The mounts would be like a 1 in 1000 or something. It would be a side activity for players who prefer World PvP and exploring contested territory. I am trying to figure out ways it couls be exploited. The chest spawns could be tied to server population, so fewer spawn as the population drops.
---
No, it was a funny comic.  Even if WoW is not the “most” popular 2019 game, you get the joke.
---
I dont know. Ive never been smart enough to figure out how to exploit things before others. But there will be people who do figure it out. Especially with items that OP listed at stake.
---
1:23  they aren't trying to kill him, they killed him earlier in his stream. They were just fucking with perp.

I don't get how 2:30 is an outplay, they kick his heal and kill him
---
So forcing people to pay $7.50 to reserve a name then your realm merges with another where someone also paid $7.50 to reserve the same name as you. Now neither of you may get that name after a merge. That wouldn't piss them off?
---
Developing a name for yourself on your server only to be forced to change your name?
---
Creating a guild name whom people across all servers recognize because your a top 10 guild in the game only to have it snatched away by a troll.
---
I don't think you understand the economical impacts this also creates. Say my realm is farming top end content for awhile, top end gear will be cheaper. I see I'm merging into a realm where no one has even cleared it yet. I'll buy up everything worth less on my realm for weeks straight if I can sell it for more after the merge. 
---
I'm thr entitled one somehow? Only aspect that affects me will be the AH. I'll increase my gold my 40% taking advantage of it. I STILL Think thats bad for the overall server economy.
---
Yep apparently I'm entitled and not looking at thr bigger picture of it all.
---
I want to play a Holy Paladin but my buddies are going Horde. Looks like I’m going priest.
---
What about the rep grind for the things that dowse the seals?... Rep grind with TB to get fire resist mt gear... I think it will be slower than on private servers because the armor debuffs won't stack in vanilla making fr gear needed more.
---
Same, tho I got into BFA beta instead of Legion. (Unrelated, was also in Diablo III's beta) When I was in BFA beta, I submitted tons and tons of bug reports on everything I did, and I did grinding of multiple characters through new content. So no, I don't think there is any preferential treatment for previous beta players who were useful, either.

Streamer or fuck off sounds tempting to say, but I have two friends who are not streamers that are in the beta for Classic. (Both 2004 accounts, mine is 2005.) I am a small-time streamer but do not have beta access, so eh... I think it's just random. People are reading way too much into it.
---
Warlock pala loses hard to rogue pala. Not that either are particularly good duos.
---
I know this sounds like trolling, but don't ignore staff damage.  Some of the highest DPS weapons early on are staves.
---
I mean outside of Vanilla / Classic, the mode certainly could work in an MMO.
---
Black Desert Online did a BR mode and it was actually pretty amazing when the hackers didn't ruin it. Especially in that case for a game where it took ages to get a character to a playable gear state, the BR mode was separate from the main game progression (as it has to be to work as a BR) and it meant getting to play the main game at any level.
---
ah yah, theres plenty of money sinks like that, I dont pay for health insurance, or any insurance really. Ride a bike. Saves a shit ton of money. its easier to not pay for health insurance if you have money since paying in cash can give up to 70-80% discounts, though on average 50%. It's a very ironic loop
---
They wanted to kill him but failed miserably. At 2:30 all 3 of them get juked but one of them is so slow and useless he actually kicks the 2nd cast by pure accident.
---
I'm hoping for only dwarfs. The only real concern is decursing, but there are items that can do that for you. Having a shit ton of hunters is fine since there are very, very few DPS race bosses that you can't depend on warriors and rogues for.
---
It'd be nice to have to come up with new strategies for encounters as old as Classic's.
---
&gt;barely any
---
Because it was taking my full attention at work to try to monitor the 3 threads and remove the offending comments. When I couldn't commit any more time I locked them.
---
I don’t remember a specfic quest but two quest chains come to mind. Darrowshire in EPL and the fallen Hero chain that starts in the swamp of sorrows.
---
Never have been banned sarcasn is a thing but i do jump from accounts and some of them are strictly for calling people on thier bs so they get chat restrictions occasionally if i actually played them more then once in a blue moon I would expect at least one of them to be banned for it by now have enough proof of that just by a few streamers that have been banned i.e wings got banned and his chatlog was pretty tame.
---
If he got kicked it doesn't sound like he juked them at all lmao, are you hydra?
---
&gt; I've had mobs layer in, hit me, layer out over and over.
---
Not to be rude or lessen the experience you've had, but that sounds like a beta test, alright.
---
No it doesn't.
---
Require people to go back to a location that grants rested XP before the layering switches over.
---
movement speed increase huh.. Spurs and carrot for warriors 2019!
---
I expect people who have questions that don't mention in their post anywhere that they also play retail to be given info with only a third or so of the responses taking a stab at retail.
---
If anybody mentions anything about also playing retail, or saying something like "on retail I don't have weapon skills, what is the deal with this how does it work?" I expect them to get shat on endlessly because this place is becoming a literal cesspool of circlejerking wankery.  
---
People can't just be happy that they get to play Classic on official servers, they have to go out of their way to shit on anybody that doesn't like what they like because RETAIL BAD CLASSIC GUD.
---
Thottbot, Wowhead, Allakhazam? Those were around within a year or so from launch. And there certainly were tons of addons available.
---
That said, I do think looking up stuff on sites takes something away from games, at least until it comes to endgame things.
---
Well most of the time the chests would be junk. The drop rates on a lot of the items would be very low. It would sort of be like a slotmachine.
---
2 more whole months of posturing guys. Keep it up :D
---
Old pservers it was actually bis to have the 4 set through naxx. As in bis game. Well just have to see how the proc rate turns out, most modern post nostt pservers have really low rates so it doesnt replace tier gear, so you cant go off of any of those databases. Like i said, well just have to wait and see.
---
 Ack in the day I had no idea what a MMO was. Paying to play a game, after you had paid for it? WTF?
---
Took me until BC to finally jump on board.
---
1. Arms warrior for the big cleave damage. The paladin should go ret for more autoattack damage. Holy or prot really doesn't help uptime much might aswell just do more damage with autos.
---
2. No idea but plenty. You can get Archeus from duskwood at the same level as a guarentee and seems a lot easier. https://classicdb.ch/?item=2000
---
3. No, summon stones were added in TBC. In vanilla the stones are just some very alpha version of a LFG that is not used by anyone. 
---
4. Basically the just the fact you have to RFK and kill mobs in stonetalon which is just a big time loss in all the movement.
---
5. You should really group for the elite, the mobs themselves should be able to be duo'ed at around 33-34, you can even group for this aswell. There will be tons of warriors out that looking to get it.
---
6. Never duelwield.
---
You won't compete for One-Handed weapons. Warriors want 2H for leveling and most of the good one-handed swords are from quests.
---
Imo, there's nothing funnier than a gnome rogue with the tiny effect from noggenfogger's elixir ganking someone who clicks their targets.
---
Because big shit is happening that might make Blizzard/Activision quit resting on their laurels.
---
I know this isn't /r/squaredcircle, but this classic vs. retail stuff sounds a LOT like AEW vs. WWE.
---
* An old product (which basically holds the monopoly on their respective art) that has not needed to change...has not changed..."We're the biggest MMO/Wrestling Promotion in the world. What we do **must be** the right way to do things because we're the most successful!" Albeit, having to compete in its earlier years against formidable opponents (WCW and Everquest). Some would even say that these competitors forced the best out of our old heroes, and could be attributed to the success of them.
---
* Old school "hardcore" fans trashing the "casual" fans
---
* Berating the old, out-of-touch men behind it all (Vince McMahon and Blizzard/Activision)
---
* Shouting about obvious "wins" that the old bag doesn't have (Emancipation of Jon Moxley/recalling CM Punk's stuff and "You think you want it but you don't", Nostalrius, spouting numbers from each expansion (*objective data?* \*pikachu face\*)
---
Thing is, do you think that *we* know about these discrepancies and the powers that are behind our "enemy" companies *don't??* Of course not. Both retail WoW and WWE are both well-aware that they are making a product that is not the same as it used to be, and that there are large numbers of people who don't like that. 
---
Both products are:
---
* Catering to a more "instant-gratification" dynamic.
---
* Definitely prioritizing quantity over quality.
---
* Making things easier (simplified, easy-to-follow storytelling from WWE's end).
---
* remaining steadfast to their current strategies.
---
They're marketing to kids, y'all. 
---
We aren't meant to enjoy retail WoW because it's (likely) not made for us. It was meant to supply the kids who are momentarily bored of Fortnite to be able to hop on and run a quick LFR raid and hop right off...or watch a quick match between Styles and Nakamura...why is their primary strategy to hit each other in the balls repeatedly? Oh yeah, kids like it.
---
Sorry for my rambling excuse for a hypothesis. I hope someone finds it interesting.
---
1. Yes, true, and this is why I specifically did not talk about "leaving a mark on the World", because that doesn't truly happen in this game.
---
2. Best gear is relative. And also, there are always going to be cookie cutter builds, just like in any other game in existence. What I'm trying to point out that despite this there is a lot of freedom about what character customization.
---
They always come out of stealth to say shit and then they kill. Are you their number one fan? Get off their dick lmao, they're fkn awful.
---
This sub is too autistic for you. These people dont want social lives or girlfriends. They want to escape reality. Do your kid a favor and not pick up this habit again
---
Jeez, only 500 people peak on the pvp realm and 400 on pve?
---
That doesn't seem like enough people to truly test the tech in the way they need to...
---
I can't remember the name of the device, but during BC someone use to play 5 shaman at once with a hardware device...that was epic for a while.
---
As another user already mentioned.  Rogues can break roots in multiple ways already.  I definitely think it's stronger to have a blind break + vanish security against dots.
---
This makes me sad since my wife will be out of town at a conference the whole first week of launch. She doesn't want me to duo level with her mage while she is gone so I'm using her as my cloth dump while I level.
---
i do cash only places for med tests and what not. You can buy cattle penicillin on Amazon for like 30 bucks that is the same stuff as human, just not 900 dollars. 
---
You can buy a suture kit for 10 bucks, ect
---
Awesome UI dude
---
No need to be so upset friend, if you can't tell the difference between a gank and some fucking around I guess that's that
---
oh yeah it was there my main was an Enh shaman got to R13 so I pvp'd a lot, was it as strong as it seems on current beta? perhaps not maybe blizz will tune it a little but it was there! The windfury's never lied.

I imagine they’ll be much more aggressive on C&amp;D’s but some servers are outside of US legal reach
---
It would work differently in Classic, since you be using your main characters. Instead of opening the chests right away, they would remain locked, this way players would die and be upset they lost a special item.
---
Both spec heavily rely on respecs in order to pvp and pve at the same time. Mage has it a bit easier as they could play deep frost in both pve and pvp, but it won't be that good in pvp due to wasting 5 points in WC. 
---
For me mages are really overrated in world. They lose a surprisingly high amount of matchups, and the 1vX situations are rare. Rogue are super super slow in stealth even as sub. Getting the fights started is often really annoying as a rogue, and killing bad/undergeared opponents feels unrewarding.
---
Worst part about being a mage is people asking you for shit.
---
Worst part about being a rogue is gear dependence.
---
I don’t think it’s up to blizzard so much as whether they can figure out who to C&amp;D for running this server or that.  Otherwise they already would have.
---
I didn't get my 100% mount till halfway through TBC because those quests paid out so well. I did manage to unlock the fast flying pretty early on. After riding around at 100% going back to 60% was painful even though you were actually flying
---
Gotta be the benediction priest quest. Required to do world boss and win the drop, then without interference complete a solo protect quest that tests your character requiring using consumables and some planning/timing. And no better feeling of equipping that beauty after it all.
---
Looking for horde or alliance guild, west coast usa or Hawaii, PvP focused (pvp realm, obv) but also raids
---
Rogues can be really CD dependent when playing solo. Also, competing against warriors, warrior tanks, and hunters for weapons(you could apply this to all those classes though). Lastly, you get looked down on as a class that doesn’t contribute.
---
Why dick around?  Arms/Holy all the way.  Maybe take the 5 Crit talents from fury first and respec to mortal strike at 40, but then you get sweeping strikes, which is vital to this leveling combo, 5 levels later.  Straight arms won’t hurt at all.  
---
Only the useless meeting stones will be in the game, and SFK is not necessary.  Getting the blue staff reward from deadmines is necessary even if you don’t plan on using staves long term, it is such a boost it’s worth it.  Same goes for Crescent staff horde side.
---
Yes, I do.  
---
I wonder if there is a search engine on the internet that could have provided an answer faster than asking this question?
---
You made a mistake. In game all female night elves are usually dancing and I'm various stages of undress.
---
*most
---
A lot of the pservers have put themselves out of Blizzard’s reach by hosting in eastern Europe.
---
I'd rather deal with that.
---
midnight EU so I think its on the 26th for NA
---
There is no harm in having a toggle, it's all client side and would have zero effect on anyone else.  Some of the people in this thread are borderline insane.  
---
Even if it doesn't get added in an official capacity I would be shocked if the modding community didn't take it upon themselves to find a way.  They can already change models in retail and had been doing it completely unhindered until the recent ban wave, which was seemingly a mistake in the auto detection system in blizzards side anyways from what I understand.
---
This answer right here is why you should stick true to your rogue roots, if that’s what you want. I’d do the Tauren Druid route if you want to try something new.
---
Imo
---
Rogue / Shaman
---
Hunter / Shaman
---
Mage / Shaman
---
It's simultaneous allowing for time zone differences, isn't it?
---
I have no friends feels bad man v.v
---
thats how it was in vanilla, maybe no one remembers but a good rogue who learned to back-peddle properly could melee kite other melee and run circles around a hunter.
---
The Relics of Wakening. No other race outside of Nigh Elves is forced to group up to complete content so early on in the game. If you are a new player, it can be frustrating and harrowing, and indicative of things to come. 
---
It's brutal and I love it.
---
I disagree. I think Warlock/Paladin is actually a really good combo.
---
Rogue: Melee. Ranged dmg not really an option. Better damage when stealthed, but will be seen in stealth a lot of the time in lower levels. Can be repetitious. Poison can be a PIA, also takes inventory space.
---
I rogued a lot in Wotlk and it was a freaking blast because of the sheer number of options available to the Rogue. It was so much fun Vanishing, leaping, and using all the abilities available in the Rogue's tool belt. But, there are less options in vanilla/classic.
---
Mage: Aside from being a glass Cannon I don't think there are too many negatives. You definitely have some "save my ass" abilities that help you get out of a tight spot. You might get asked a lot for food, water, and portals from strangers when you're in town and that may become annoying.
---
I don't see this as shitting on current WoW. If anything it just shows how far you've come. From noob adventurer to defeating the big bads as champion. Not just in-game, but we're much more experienced than we were in vanilla or earlier expansions.
---
If you're focused on comparing at the same level-up process, both games have a different focus.
---
I enjoy both games for what they are!
---
You reserved your name on that server.
---
They reserved their name on theirs.
---
Nobody guaranteed you wouldnt roll on a future dead server. Both of you wont lose the name, only the one was transferred, of course they would get to keep it if they didn't transfer.
---
It's like when sonethingnwas offered as limited time only, so you rush to buy, only for it to be offered again years later. You got the years of exclusivity that you paid for.

The worst part about being a mage is having to drink after every 1-2 pulls just to remain on par with melee dps during a 5-man dungeon. Sure you can nuke the shit out of something and topple the dps meter but then you miss the next 2 pulls because you drinking.
---
The worst part about being a rogue is losing your combo points when swapping targets. Group target mob went from 50% to dead in 1 second? So sorry you just lost 5 combo points.

wow, thanks this is awesome
---
It's not like private servers actually violate any intellectual property laws by themselves, they're just emulators with zero blizzard code. The client side users are the ones arguably pirating.
---
I imagine blizzard will keep aggressively pursuing legal action though, as it's not like private server hosts have the energy or legal resources to defend themselves.
---
Ban for what though?
---
what kind of fps are you getting and on what settings? going to be using a 2018 MBP and hoping i can run on high-ultra and get around 40-60 fps

---
How about instead of being a douchebag you fact check it and see you're wrong next time.
---
It wasn't merely "large" in the MMO community. It completely redefined the genre. There are almost certainly orders of magnitude more people in the MMO community who started with WoW than people who played something else before it. 
---
Vanilla wasn't mainstream in the sense that frat boys were playing it, but in the context of gaming it was instantly extremely popular and easily the most approachable MMO. A lot of people resented the game for what it did to the genre.
---
Hunter epic weapon quest line (for the bow that turns into a staff)
---
Alliance has the advantage in ALL group content. The reason why is paladins. Their buffs make a big difference in organized content. 
---
Horde has better racials for PvP on average but it's like the difference between warriors and solders - warriors might be better individual fights but soldiers fight better together. 
---
So horde usually has a distinct advantage in random BGs, alliance usually has an advantage in premades.
---
yeah you can't really see the quests for your faction and level on wohead.
---
yeah you can't really see the quests for your faction and level on wowhead.

A lot of them will naturally close their doors
---
Wow, what a privilege that we have the one and only arbiter of enjoyment on this subreddit! Since this guy went through not one but TWO server mergers and the game wasn't ruined for him surely no one else could have had a negative experience! I'll admit I was one of those people that quit a server because of a merger, but now I realize it wasn't because it destroyed the economy, resulted in nearly every native guild disbanding, caused severe faction imbalance, or anything else like that. It was because I was entitled all along! Thank you so much for clearing that up for me!
---
without the captions this comic is so bad, i mean what's even the punchline here?
---
1. Arms/ret
---
2. 40 mins
---
3. No
---
4. Sure sounds like fun. RFK as alliance isn't that normal but with a tank and healer i'd think a group would still be easy to make
---
5. Probably 36 or so. Questionable if it's worth it at that stage as you can get bonebiter by then anyway.
---
6. I would go bonebiter as it is good for at least 10 levels and sweeping strikes is just ridiculous for cleaving through stuff with a healbot. You can go fury if you want, I don't think it's terrible - but it is nearly always worse. If you're doing mara/st/brd you'll find an upgrade somewhere for sure, annoying thing with arms is it might require a respec though. The good thing with fury is you can use whatever weapon you come across, even 2hers work well.
---
Devouring Plague is very overrated. It is a huge mana cost and easily dispelled by paladins, other priests, and every dwarf. Hex is good dispel protection, and blackout procs off shadow guard are great.
---
As rogue: A warlock getting full DoTs on you is basically a death sentence since this is pre-Cloak of Shadows. You might be able to kill them first, but a lot of the time they'll get you from beyond the grave. 
---
It's one of the main reasons why I prefer Undead over Orc for rogue: WotF gives you a better chance to kill a Warlock before it's too late and Cannibalize can sometimes save you if you can get a heal from it between DoT ticks after you kill them.
---
enjoy getting your shit kicked in by the alliance when the game is actually out :)
---
Tbh with layering the game won't be playable for the first phase anyway, so I don't might some bugs if they are fixed within phase 2 :shrug:
---
Never taken money from my parents since I reached adulthood, but god damn if my sister hasn't taken 3x that on her own.
---
Is that even a valid defense though? Why was Nostalrius shut down? If it was legal, it shouldn’t have been an issue.
---
Yes, but it has *worked* as a system in retail. Slight modification and it could be a solution, worth exploring I would imagine.
---
This sounds exactly like something a sissy boy would say
---
 \*Each time someone mentions a streamer: **20 squats** 
---
This one bothers me. I have been playing on a private server recently and Barrens chat is just a bunch of moron spamming. "Invite me to Asmon's Layer"
---
I wouldn't be able to stand for a week after 30 minutes of Barrens Chat.
---
12345 qwert, fg, zxcvb
---
Modify with comfortable buttons of your choice.
---
MMO mice are a meme and generally overly heavy and pretty shit. Poor sensor quality all around. Get a strong 5 button mouse that reviews well for consistency and build quality.
---
But.. but.. clicking is an authentic vanilla experience.
---
I felt for wings, my chat logs were the same.  Riot views anything that is not praise to someone as reportable.
---
Btw asking someone to stop dying is a reportable offense. Welcome to riot logic
---
Yes you can.
---
Here's every quest made available to a Horde player when they hit level 40:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quests/min-req-level:40/max-req-level:40/side:2#100+11
---
Ah well theres the difference. There are tons of people like myself that would rather not deal with that, we would rather have layering (unfortunately) so that we can actually play the game for the first bit
---
Ah, yeah I prefer the lottery to stay in Retail.
---
Most of them will close voluntarily. But if Classic turns out to be a complete unauthentic shitshow then don't be surprised if you see private servers popping up again.
---
Fair enough, I just hoped that flairs would be something that could work in either view...
---
This and stick rpg.
---
For classic, you definitely don't need an mmo mouse. I have a G502 which has middle mouse, forward and back buttons, and 2 extra buttons and I'm able to play a Druid quite well (cat weaving requires probably more buttons than any other spec). I clicked until Wrath and the best advice I can give is to stick with it and don't give up. Classic is super simple, you should have no problems starting fresh as a non-clicker.
---
Personally, I use 1-5, q, e, z, x, and my 3 extra mouse buttons only. Each one has both a shift and control modifier, netting me 3x 'buttons' for skills. I also have some alt modifiers that are bound to non-combat abilities like mount disenchant, etc.
---
But, but, everyone tells me streamers will ruin classic 
---
:p
---
I took over car payments for my parents so they could afford to put my sister to ucsd and pay for her apartment so there's that haha.
---
All I remember was rolling a dwarf paladin, taking a week and probably an embarrassing /played I made it to level 5, where I finally learned that I could use one of my abilities to heal myself
---
It's usually pretty matter of fact. Also expect to be told exactly how to equip, what consumables you need to bring, and what recipes and raw materials you need to grind for. In the end it's not about DPS at all, it's about being a dependable member of a team.
---
ya, i'm definitely not disagreeing that people make not so great financial decisions. However, i don't have easy access statistics on irresponsible spendings. Though the amount of new phones that constantly re-sell is definitely suspicious. It may be a part of it, but there are two bigger issues to me. money distribution and the actual job availability quality.
---
Money distribution is a no brainer. Technology efficiency is causing more money to be funnelled in smaller groups. You can't just "print money" so the truck automation example coming soon. 100 billion dollars going through automation means 100 less billion dollars for the average worker.
---
But secondly, job quality. This one i havn't gathered statistics so i can't give a definite number but, if you chunked out the lowest paying jobs available and only showed the number of workers who generate revenue to pay for everything and have a decent extra amount of cash to save, it would be less then 50% of US population. This is the real number that people need to look at, not unemployment. Cause that type of job pay wont ever be available to everyone and is going to keep dwindling.
---
It is just part of the reality.
---
killing 20 harvest watchers
---
Think about your poor parents now. Are they going to play classic? They don't have anyone they can train to farm for them! You messed up OP, you're supposed to have kids of your own by now!
---
...the entire tweet is literally talking about nothing but the loot.  He's explaining what loot tables will be applied to each phase.  Are you having a stroke?
---
Layering or not, it takes a different sort of person to actually go to the effort to boot up a wow vanilla server.  Never understood the appeal at all.  Turns out they do have a reputation of being some of the most toxic people in online gaming.  That is mostly what I am referencing.
---
They wouldn't be able to ban it because it's an unavoidable side effect of the system they created. People abuse it on retail all the time, but economy means a lot less on retail so no one really cares. 
---
With that said, I think a lot of people that don't think this is a big deal are people from retail that don't remember how important economy used to be to the game.
---
I can't reason with unreasonable people. I just hope they make 1 unlayered sesrver for all the whining children saying it'll ruin the game. Have fun with your 2 hour login que and fierce competition for every mob when leveling. Maybe you'll be able to grind some high level mobs without 200 people competing for the same 12 mobs.
---
Yeah you can change layers mid combat. It happened to Asmongold the other day.
---
Yeah that's exactly it, you were entitled

**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
First team: Tues/Sun, 8pm – 11pm CST 
---
Second team: Wed/Mon, 7:30pm – 10:30pm CST

**Loot System:**

Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---

Most mouse buttons have 1 or 2 keybindable buttons on them unless it's super basic. Regardless, Classic will make this much simpler on face value as there is a fraction of the different abilities making it easy to get the hang of it while leveling. Find a few easily accessible buttons to use, use those same buttons with Shift/CTRL modifiers and you're good to go.
---
Who am I being disrespectful of?  The original wow developers?  lol
---
Naw I'll just play on a low pop server because I'm not entitled
---
Only person that can answer this is you friend.  But I think there are some pros to switching.
---
1. You'll get to experience the game over, in a different light. As someone who absolutely loves the human starting zones, I've been playing undead on private servers and have grown to love these areas too.
---
2. Horde just have better racials.  I know you can split hairs and say it's preference.  But I don't see many reasons to pick racials for PvE when the content is 15 years old and already pretty well known.  I don't think all the pve racials that ally's get are important.

Hi, /u/lucasdens

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4uosg/finding_a_guild/).

It has nothing to do with streamers, you can join a friend’s group to deliberately induce layering to get Black Lotus nodes.
---
I think you completely misunderstand how readily this can be exploited. Especially when it comes to gathering professions.
---
Lot of butthurt in these comments
---
Yes you can,  by zone you can drill down the quest results by level range and faction.  You may want to try before saying it's not possible.

Archeus is pretty sweet! Didn't know about that one.
---
I just signed up for vanillafriends and tesief isn't registered.
---
&gt;  I realize what arguments people give to differentiate layering and sharding. I'm saying I don't believe it.
---
This might be the most stuipid thing ive ever read.
---
What do you mean you "dont believe it"?
---
What? Of course they can ban for it, lol.  Blizzard can do whatever they want.  They are gaming the system and cheating.  They will can and definitely will ban offenders.
---
Honestly spend the money on a razer or corsair mouse that has the 12 or so buttons on the side. 1-8 are extremely easy to use and with shift and alt modifiers you have 24 easy to use keybinds right on your mouse. Completley changed my game. 
---
People hate on it but i highly reccomend it.
---
Are there any good ones but the rewards from DM and Mara quests?
---
I think you mean with layering game will be more exploitable. The whole point of layering is to make the game more playable during phase 1
---
You are right waiting in queue isn't gameplay... So gameplay doesn't suffer from it.
---
Unlike layering which directly and negatively impacts gameplay.
---
&gt;No one will pay to play a game that they can't actually play.
---
Accept they have, every single time, and they will again.
---
You can instant Hearthstone though ! And if you have the proc as you kill a mob you should be ooc to cast the mount I think
---
Literally every person in their 20's that I know do this...its sad, sometimes I think to myself "damn I must have the most boring life out of anyone I know" but then I realize what u/Pathayne is saying and feel better :)
---
Ehm ... Shamans have a thread reduction totem you know.
---
It's because Detheroc was one of the most active PVP servers at the time. Just so happened that the best PVE guild was alliance. The Horde just cared about world PVP dominance and battlegrounds eventually. Imperial Order were a PVE guild on a PVP server.
---
I like the arms idea - Sweeping Strikes immediately at 30 sounds OP. Would fury with improved cleave work at all?
---
ITT: A bunch of people who can't figure out the tables are on wheels
---
OP, where did you get those tables?  I want one.
---
I agree 100%
---
I got 9 right - the rating points question stumped me.
---
49 elemental shaman was probably my favorite of 10 or so thinks. Such a fun bracket.
---
You need one of every spec of every class in the guild, but just don't get suprised if you don't get picked for something like a first attempt on BWL. Later on down the road everyone will get a chance, especially when Molten Core turns into Molten Chore.
---
Well there we go, it wasn't textbook mainstream, I'm not arguing people liked it, but it wasn't a household name yet. I know of some friends who came from eq to wow when it was released due to wow being much easier and a chill experience, even the Diablo crowd at my school called wow too nerdy when it was announced, later when they saw those sexy BEs they changed their mind.
---
See I see games like that and my first thought is still how new they are and how it was much better playing shit like Tribes and the original Jedi Knight and BF1942 and CoD1 and GoldenEye etc etc etc. 
---
Thanks for reminding me what an old fuck I am.
---
just cap DR on HK's in the open world ezclap
---
Yeah, 36... We'll probably be doing SM around 39 anyway - agreed it seems like a waste of time then.
---
Do you know if the ST class quests will be available at launch? In which case we'll do ST for sure.
---
Well Classic isn't out yet.
---
(Though lets be real, a $15/mo game won't touch something like League)
---
They can but they won't. It would be impossible to police and too many grey lines. Simply not possible. Feel free to disagree with that point, but it would be an absolute nightmare from a moderation POV.
---
See thats an inconvenience not a game break problem yet to see a problem with layering
---
100 gold please need mount
---
Unbind q and e from turn. I used 1234 qe and then modifiers shift+1245qe crtl+12345qe alt+12345qe. Also mouse buttons and wheel+ modifiers. This has been my general mmo buttonset since vanilla, modifying depending on if a game makes use of the modifiers in different ways.
---
Honest question: do you not see the absurdity in telling everyone they're entitled because they disagree with your opinion? I want to believe you're a troll and just really bad at it.
---
No, you do not have access.
---
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
No benefit to taking more than 2-3 rogues in a PvE setting. Top guilds will likely have rogue spots filled. Very rare to see 'Recruiting Rogues, x, x'.. because the class is usually pretty common and not particularly painstaking to play at a decent level in PvE. Hitting the top top top echelon is a different story, but there will probably always be an overabundance of average rogues.
---
Get a naga mouse. I dont know how I lived before getting one.
---
You don't need a fancy mouse, you can do it with just keyboard binds, but I really like 12 button grid mice. Its just simpler for me personally and its already in my muscle memory. I would recommend one to anyone willing to drop the money on one.
---
I would at least get a mouse with 2 side buttons. That'll offer you 3 buttons including the Mouse Wheel push. So thats 9 inputs if you modify with ctrl/alt/shift. 12 I guess if you can do it with scroll up and down.
---
Again, you absolutely don't need a mouse with a bunch of buttons. Tons of really great players play just with keybinds on the keyboard.
---
You don't have access. I'm rolling on a private server till the official version drops
---
I did the same thing with that painting
---
Unfortunately.
---
Born too late to play classic back in the day, born too early to have my own kids now. What a shame 😂
---
Yes more released content
---
They're entitled because they think they deserve something, not because I disagree.
---
Basically made the same comment without reading yours lol. I can't imagine looking at anything Halo and thinking christ that's an old ass game. 
---
I'm old enough to get confused when people say MW2 because I still think of MechWarrior.
---
The easiest way to get into using hotkeys is to use them from the start. If you level 1-30 with clicking and then decide to start using hotkeys then you will have muscle memory conflict and try to click out of habit.
---
The best way to make sure you continue to use hotkeys is to only assign hotkeys that you don't have trouble hitting. If it is a bigger trouble for you to use a hotkey than to click then you will fall back into clicking. Test your reach with your hand and discover what keys you can easily use and stick with those. Consider rebinding your mouse wheel to act as hotkeys. If you use camera zoom all the time and don't want to rebind it then you can still use modifier keys like shift+mwheel and alt+mwheel to perform abilities.
---
It is also important to know that you do not need *every* ability on a hotkey. It is perfectly fine to have a bunch of lesser-used abilities that you still click on. You're not ever going to be in such an emergency where you need to hit your Prayer of Fortitude hotkey 0.2ms faster than it would take you to click on it.
---
I've always been for a cleaned up classic. The no changes  people are delusional.
---
Id imagine most people serious about playing classic would rather play on official servers and the pvt ones would die organically. I hear a lot of people complaining about private servers having no longevity, thats horrible to play a game like wow.
---
I second this. I got the Razer mouse that has 12 keys. Was a leaning curve but I love it . I use 1-4 on my keyboard as well as F,R and the rest are on the mouse . I will probably change up some in classic since I. Hold polish up a bit . Still find myself clicking some things. But highly recommended as well
---
Yep
---
DM as is Deadmines or Dire Maul, because Dire Maul won’t be out for a while.  Maradon is 40-50+ dungeon so there’s a lot you can do between then.  I think there’s staff of westfall and staff of purifier.  Those do way more dps than other weapons of the same level.  Later on(45) get the ZF staff The Chief’s Enforcer, has a chance to stun and once again does a lot more dps than similar martial weapons.
---
Can we just nuke this subreddit please
---
And lower the heat/raise the AC a degree or two.
---
The one where you have to kill 8 boars
---
Impossible? Idk man, I don't think it would be too hard to programmatically detect and flag abusers.  Something about how often they are swapping layers, items gathered after swapping layers, time intervals on how often you are swapping layers and where (like if you always swap while in black lotus areas and always loot a lotus after swapping).
---
This is just off the top of my head.  I wouldn't call it impossible.  Will some people fall through the cracks? Maybe, but you can make the anti-cheat on the stricter side, with a multiple-offense type system.
---
It would take effort and time to do it, but I definitely wouldn't call it impossible.
---
bless, you think 3.5 million subs is a lot.

This is wrong sub to come to for fitness advice.....

My honeymoon was awesome - we went to Mexico, saw some Mayan ruins, took in the local fare and wildlife. Unforgettable trip. WoW will still be here when you get back, and after spending an entire week in the company of your new spouse, they may be due for a break from you.
---
lol damn this quest. always a pain even in dead servers.
---
Surely what you're ending up with is just layering with extra steps? 
---
If they just alter how you join and leave layers it should be fine.
---
If you have server mergers then it has economical issues, guild issues and just general community issues. If you do layering **properly** then it should be alright, although layering at the moment seems problematic.
---
It's such a complex topic really. There's so many different options. Maybe even just add sharding for the starter zones. But who knows if that would work.
---
I'm pretty split between the character I want to main (20/0/31 Human Paladin)  and a NE Hunter (because gold is nice to have)
---
Yeah i still use the easy to reach binds on my keyboard as well. My biggest thing was starting to keybind from the second you start leveling so you get used to it. Feels really weird at first when i was a clicker for yeara.
---
Nost was sent a C&amp;D and then shut down voluntarily. Whether or not Blizzard would win in a court of law had Nostalrius refused to shutdown? Who knows, but, I wouldn't want to be fighting their high-paid lawyers.
---
Either way, I doubt Blizzard changes their current approach. They already send out C&amp;D letters. I don't expect them to be able to do much more than that.
---
I'm eager to play Classic, but BfA's got some serious problems with spawns. I could hardly fight a mob 1v1 a lot of times. They are so close together and respawn so fast.
---
Thirded. People hate on them because they're expensive and dorky I guess. But they're really useful. I've always used one for basically my entire time playing WoW. Its just much simpler and easier to use for me.
---
It also saves me time trying to figure out what bind goes where, as since every bind is quick and easy to reach it doesn't particularly matter.
---
What do you not understand about NO CHANGES?
---
I we cant’t fucking wait to do it again😁

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 8-9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
Why not the one with the Wolves?
---
Most are voluntarily shutting down when Classic launches. But if layering sticks around and it's as bad as it is now, wouldn't be surprised if people went back to private servers.
---
When WoW came out it was the least sandbox MMO on the market. WoW became the poster-child for the "Theme-Park MMO" genre, the opposite of a sandbox MMO.
---
Longest flight in the game is Auberdine to Feathermoon, right?
---
&gt;. At what time can the WW axe/mace quest be duoed by a warr/pally? When would it not be painfully slow to do so?
---
I'd highly recommend you get a hunter to help you out with those quests.  Hunters are awesome on higher level mobs, the pally can help heal his pet, and you can recruit a hunter as easily as telling him you'll put him on your friend's list for future dungeon runs that you're tanking.
---
So much this, yeah in beta you have time to move layers and gather it, in retail each layer will have a character(multiple even) parking there waiting for the spawn.
---
Until you realize the freedom you get with the level 60 mount.
---
Plz dont change a thing on this sub in terms of loosening the rules. It’s just new kids from the hype not knowing what is and isnt allowed and theyre throwing tantrums. 
---
On the other hand keep up the good work with removing all the low effort bs. Still want battlestation posts perma’d since the only amusing one was from yesterday and it was literally an animation.
---
I had to look it up-- it's just been too long. [Source, which sounds like what I remember, but I am fallible](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-warlock-felsteed-dreadsteed-mounts#part-3-dreadsteed-of-xoroth) is 250g for the various materials needed for a warlock to perform the summoning ritual. Then Journeyman Riding and Dreadsteed are gratis.
---
We could be a good fit for you -- sending you a PM shortly.
---
Apparently entitlement is coming onto a game discussion forum and expecting discussion of a game.
---
On our server (Mannoroth, first PvP server to open the gates) it was pretty much a faction-wide effort.  People outside of the Scarab Lord's guild were made Agent of Nozdormu, invited to elite farming and boss raids, etc.
---
    while (lolrogue.IsAlive)
---
        {
---
            /cast Fear
---
            /cast Shadowbolt
---
        };
---
I think , i might be wrong, but what the community would really love would be a vanilla wow 2 even if it s just the same map with different quests and slightly varied talents and classes maybe they want to discover again . That s my 2 cents anyway
---
I was on Mannoroth. Macabre did most of the work by themselves.
---
No entitlement is expecting that the game owes you anything
---
Hunter.  You forgot to mention controlling your level 60 pet and running it into a low level questing area and wreaking havoc with just your pet.
---
I'll send you a message shortly. I think we could be a good fit!
---
Im kind of leaning towards rogue as well, but do you guys think any dagger builds would work alongside warrior, or should I just stick to swords until 60? I'd rather not use swords/maces if I don't have to and I will be only duo questing, I just want that extra pop from ambush and backstab for wpvp
---
It’s not a good talent and will never equal the dps output of sweeping strikes. Horde warrior duos with shamans and sweeping strikes are beastly.
---
Lol all this talk about comps. You aren't pushing for glad. If you're lucky you'll get into a fair fight with another 2 players maybe 2-3 times the entire time you level to 60. 2v2 is not a thing in vanilla wow. Theorycraft sperging over duo tiers in Classic is so pointless.  
---
Any 2 decent players will win 90% of their pvp encounters while levelling, completely regardless of class. Just pick some classes you enjoy, that is by far the most important thing.
---
They will close themselves.
---
There's still one more test scheduled for July 18-19.
---
I hear that, there are some people that have been hanging out in their mom's basement for 15 years with nothing to think about but specs and  the like.
---
Is there a way to download a copy, as you can''t do anything, freeze panes or hide columns so I can actually see my class and not everything?
---
Even though MANY of those buttons are situational, I always felt like I had the right tool for the job. So I'm all about team buttons.
---
Speaking of bugs, I’ve seen people talking about the “hunter pet bug” as if it’s a cheap tool used in pvp what is this bug?
---
): I was hoping to play hunter on launch and I hope this gets addressed.
---
Some of them are working on pushing out TBC too.
---
I do but why waste an extra 500g for the regular mount?
---
I don't mean from a detection point of view. I mean from a backlash and dispute point of view.  Many people saying they didn't know it was bannable because they've been doing for years. How would they all of a sudden communicate the seriousness of it and people listen? Not to mention the interaction is by design. So they'll be banning people because their technology is inconsistent. 
---
Or do you only make farming black lotus bannable? Do they make that a loading screen tip? Server message? Send out an email? Seems like a weird edge case that can't really be enforced due to the greyness and precedents already set.
---
This isn't advice, just a question. But is NE in consideration for the 1% dodge?  I thought there are some trinkets that are considered pretty good just because they have 1% dodge on them.
---
My question was if there is a way to see what quests are available in all zones not just one
---
We also called camp tarajo, camp taco 😂
---
Some people are just willfully blind to what goes on around them. People don't like complexity, but the real world is extremely complex and simple answers don't work. People like the above poster think you can solve all sorts of personal problems with simple rules like "find a new job if yours sucks" or "if you don't want to get in trouble don't do anything wrong", but in the real world, it's not that simple. If you're working in a location and a field where the work is exploitive, and you're living paycheck to paycheck, "finding a new job" is not going to find you a less exploitive job unless you're willing to fall into homelessness, or a miracle happens and you're somehow able to pick up your whole life and move across the world at the drop of the hat, or you get a 1 in a million opportunity where some unrealistically generous company pays for your to reskill. The world isn't that easy. Labor laws in a few places just aren't enough.
---
The real world is way way more complicated than a world where following simple rules like that would work in. People need to make due with what they have, and oftentimes the best solution for an individual is the worst solution for everyone. The only way to tackle these issues is to take them on as a group and for the average person to take initiative in solving problems that don't directly affect them, which is an extraordinary difficult thing to make happen. It's a shit situation and it's often bleak 
---
Damn. This got preachy. But I understand how shitty the labour market for developers can be. I spent a while in Japan and saw firsthand just how exploitive even white collar jobs are there , and the atmosphere in the US is just as toxic, just in different ways. Good luck, I hope changes happen one day.

[Okay, I'm getting tingles.](https://media.tenor.com/images/e32ca17a063d2a7be940915543440cc5/tenor.gif)
---
Dang, alright thanks guys.
---
They banned people who abused sharding to get multiple rolls on world bosses.
---
Economy is important but people overestimate the effect abusers would have, in beta you have these people doing it and getting away with it because theres no one else contesting thenodes, once the game releases you will have multiple people camping to get them, thinking that you would have time to logoff move to an alt to change layer and then go to the gatherer again and no one will grab the lotus in that time is naive.
---
Like layering?
---
Hey, a world is interesting with good and bad. 
---
If you want to play the underdog and try to do stuff, do it. Be that underdog and try to do your best with the worst.
---
But be happy that we are not homogenized like modern. 
---
And please do not try to change the game so you can play a new version of modern. Ask for those changes for modern.
---
The cost of more virtualized servers isn't high, but combining the server and maintaining character names is a real problem if they want to avoid dead servers.  They obviously do want to avoid dead servers.  Refusal to merge servers is what caused phasing in retail.  That's not a game design decision, that's from the corporate folks.
---
By all means feel free to stay on pservers, blizz classic could do without the toxicity of pserver players.
---
You right about vision of FC.  Not a thing.  I was confusing paych 2.4's reveal mechanic which put enemy FC on map after 45seconds.   He was never revealed in vanilla.
---
1.6 added friendly FC on your map.  Not till 2.4 did you see enemy.
---
Go lookup those two patches you'll see he was never revealed in Vanilla else why reveal at 45seconds in TBC
---
&gt; ~~Gold please~~ *opens trade* 1 Gold, Nǐ hǎo  
---
*FTFY*
---
The shaman class quests were cool because you had to actually learn how to use different schools of magic.
---
I really liked the warrior and rogue class quests too.
---
One thing I hear nobody talking about is how there are like 600 concurrent players on the Beta but somehow there are like 5 layers (if not more). Clearly they are testing this shit. With 600 concurrent players, there *should* only be 1 layer (2 at best).
---
Some of the pet bugs were copied over from Retail and have been a problem since Legion came out, and have still not been acknowledged as a problem by Blizzard.
---
It is far more likely that they will continue to ignore the pet problems just like they have been doing for the past 2 years.
---
Amazing quest line. It’s awesome that you have to complete it alone. When I did it I had a few guild mates making sure horde didn’t try to gank me, so it was cool to have them watch also
---
&gt;The reason you see it less is that instead of 1000 layers it's 7 layers.
---
You claim to understand the difference between sharding and layering but this clearly shows that you dont.
---
I like it!
---
Technically yes, but is a realistic way to avoid ever dying? Hell no.
---
Because I will be too busy leveling to care about people layer hopping. So what if a level 30 can change layers? It will be gone by the time majority hits 60.
---
how do you move when qwert are bound to spells? You always use the mouse?
---
I do Shift + asdfqwerzxcv and then numbers for lesser used spells... not sure it’s better or worse.
---
The Burning Steppes look way too large.
---
Hmmm, idk man isn't it pretty obvious that exploits are bannable?  If you're hoping layers to game the system, you must be semi-aware that what you're doing could get you banned.  They didn't need anything to ban users for buying gold in the past.  How is this any different.
---
&gt; Not to mention the interaction is by design
---
It's a side effect of the design, not "by design".  Layers are designed for the purpose of not having a queue and having enough "world" available for the huge population surge we will see on launch.  Any other use of it isn't by design, and should be considered an exploit.
---
I remember learning about the quest from G4TV. I thought it was awesome how much travel they make you do and the final reward was really neat.
---
Sick reference as well. Un'Goro is definitely one of my favorite zones.
---
He ded
---
Don't be such a dullard.
---
My point is: promising a change that negatively impacts gameplay is temporary does not justify that negative change, especially when the people making that promise *have no idea if they will be able to uphold it*.  For example, Classic might do well and not lose many subs, or catch on in a viral fashion and gain subs.  Guess they'd just have to stick with layering?
---
Negatively impacting gameplay is one of the most disastrous, unpredictable, and ignorant things you can do to a game like WoW because the negative effects permeate the game.
---
For example I will focus only on the concept of "immersion", which I hope you agree is important.  With layering you have massive servers ~30k people that presumably share an AH.  So you're going to see MANY copies of rare, hard to find items.  It breaks immersion (a little bit) to see 10 Kang, the Decapitators in the AH.  Not the end of the world, right?  I agree.  But then you go out to the world and see players disappearing before your eyes.  Still not a big deal.  Then you start to think about how to use layering to your advantage to level or pvp, or about getting in the same layer as a friend, etc etc.  Every time you do it breaks immersion, since you are thinking about the game rather than your character.  Again, not the end of the world.  However, during your journeys, you realize you never see the same players.  There are ~10 layers to your server so you're 10 times less likely to run across the same person.  That breaks immersion.
---
None of these things, by themselves, are "uninstall the game" bad.  But together, you have a pretty constant pressure to break immersion that certainly will hurt enjoyment of the game for those who enjoy immersive gaming.
---
And that's just immersion, as an examole.  There are social, leveling, pvp consequences as well that I won't touch on unless you want me to get into them.
---
It's a beta. Get over it.
---
Well if someone have friends on the subserver then he stay on the subserver. end of the story.
---
Always been a thing.  Just 1000x worse with social media because you get the instant gratification or instantly destroyed.

Hello can I have more info in a private chat?

\&gt;  skipping the shit parts of wow 
---
Doesn't sound like an opinion to me. That statement implies that those parts of WoW are universally terrible for everyone. Would've been better if you just said the 'the parts \*I\* don't like\*'. Then you get defensive when someone points out your poor choice of words. They didn't imply in any way that your opinion is invalid, but your comment implied that other people's opinions \*are\* invalid. Just a bit hypocritical.

Raid times/days  don't matter.  2+ nights a week
---
Mainly, the place to look are dungeon drops. It might make sense, as you are a mail tank and a mail healer, to pay attention to how your clothies are geared and consider asking to roll on the staffs for your warriors. 
---
For example, deadmines, all the clothies want the wand, but they often GET the emberstone staff. Meaning that if you group with a warlock on their third run, you might just see them with the staff slung across their back. In this case? it's well worth trying to get the staff for your warrior if you can't get 2 copies of smites. 
---
similarly, strike of the hydra is a GREAT 2 handed weapon, but it may be worth giving up on it (it's a 20% drop on the last boss and everyone who can use it wants it), and just settling for the 50% drop rod of the sleepwalker.
---
keep in mind, these are by no means BIS or even near BIS for the warrior, and the paladin I don't think can even use staffs. It's very much a consolation prize, like "okay, we ran deadmines 3 times, we have all the gold flecked bucklers we will ever need, and the paladin got a decent weapon. Just take the staff and let's get the hell out of here". sort of things.
---
Never heard of them.
---
This all the way!
---
The dev team grew to despise pizza.
---
Their experience with how horrible the Crunch was with starcraft is actually what made them decide to do the "optional" late nights early on, it got them prepared for that sort of thing. Im not sure if it actually helped because at a certain point before release they had to stop the crunch for a while because the team because demoralized and unproductive. They realized the game would never really be "done", so alot of the employees wondered why even bother with thr crunch time if they couldn't race to the finish. Sucks
---
I don’t want to keep track of a billion companies to make sure every product I buy is produced ethically. I think most people agree with me, and I also think a majority thinks expecting devs to crunch is wrong. Give your employees enough time to make your product, let me pay what it actually costs+whatever they need to skim off the top, and I’ll decide if that price makes sense to me as a consumer. 
---
Don’t squeeze my fellow workers just so you can penny pinch a few more cents per game/project/programmer out of your players.
---
I dont understand these fuckwits complaining about layering everyday. 
---
Blizzard said layering would only be used for the first couple weeks while people are leveling in the starting zone. 
---
I could understand the complaining if it was going to be a permanent thing but it's not.
---
Im spending all my time on and off the stress tests creating an addon to toggle the client models. All the new models work on the old client, new animations are not a problem cuz they don’t need to be included. If I had beta access It would be a bit faster but I hope once the game is released I can get it working to everyone else like me who likes the new graphics and think it would just add to the vanilla experience.
---
Yeah - although the concept is the same. 
---
Also the fact that I can’t really see any scenario where there will ever be more then 2-3 layers.  Unless blizz is okay with the potential 15k pop servers...
---
Most pservers if not all are outside of the US.
---
That actually does seem like a minor bug and easily fixable bug
---
WTF IS THIS??? On Chromaggus stuns, then we figured out what that trash loot did 😂 Also shadowflame breath was fun without a cloak
---
Lol what? No they weren't
---
In order for a company to keep their trademark, they're required to defend it against violations. If Blizzard ignored private servers, they would lose the right to the "World of Warcraft" trademark. This is what happened to "Asprin", which was originally a brand name, and now can legally be used by anyone.  
---
In other words, Blizzard will continue to behave the same way they've behaved over the past 15-years, intermittently sending out C&amp;D letters to private servers (outside of Eastern Europe), unless intellectual property laws are changed.
---
Are you Quasimodo?
---
Your poor back.
---
That’s every horde quest where the minimum required level is 40.  It’s not particularly useful because minimum required level doesn’t tell you the quest’s level, and it doesn’t tell you whether that quest is unavailable because you haven’t finished a previous quest in a chain.  
---
That’s part of the problem with the UI of those sites.  You start needing to filter things out, and extracting it in to something easily manipulated is a bit of a pain given they put tables within tables that make simple copy paste jobs cumbersome.  
---
Making the process query based means you REALLY have to understand the question you’re asking to get the results you want.
---
I know, but some countries still respond to US courts, many European and asian ones for example
---
Yeah, I like the grind to get it and everything about them besides when they were implemented. As in they were only there for catch-up and not desired by most who have already been doing end-game. Just having overall more endgame options is a great thing, especially if they fit in with the progression curve.
---
Still sucks but i guess it's a part of the game. The same kind of people that will do that probably don't know what the inside of Molten Core looks like if they're not willing to just go out there and grind for it.
---
If that Murloc can heal itself, GAME OVER. Walk away, don’t even approach.
---
In fact, DONT ever fight Murlocs with sticks. You think they just wanna hit you with the stick?
---
Sure, my discord is Xido#1269
---
You know this gets posted twice a day right
---
You are framing any sort of discussion as entitlement.
---
Can confirm
---
Alliance locks also get 30% threat reduction in raids from paladins which is big
---
Only if that friend is in another layer, which you have no idea that he is, and if he is in your guild, then he likely isn't. 
---
Also, some farmer getting the black lotus spawns isn't even new.  You basically never find those in the open world.  So, some farmers have more gold than you?  Big fucking deal....
---
But it doesn't pair with windfury. Sure you can have 2 shamans in melee group but then that's just taking away from the caster groups.
---
Sorry, no. I had it open before but there were some who made copies and took credit themselves. I try to prevent that.
---
However, the project will possibly take another turn in the near future which will allow you to do what you wish... Kind of! ;)

Thank God I’ve never seen this hahaha!!!

We are an up-and-coming guild quickly filling our ranks. We have extensive goals to be one of the top guilds on the server and will always be current on content. We fully expect to be ready to raid within a month from launch. We're looking for casual players as well has those as hardcore as us alike.

We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.

**Catalyst (NA) – Alliance - PVP - Semi-Hardcore** 
---
**About:**
---
Catalyst is a conglomerate of retail guilds who have joined forces to relive one of the greatest works of art Blizzard has ever created.  The goal is to create a community of like-minded individuals to enjoy everything classic has to offer. Catalyst is comprised of raiders who have played together for many years and a strong leadership core that plans to ensure future success by maintaining a positive atmosphere. Our leadership strategy is built upon transparency and communication; we place a high value on our members and constantly strive to better ourselves. 
---
**Raid info: **
---
Raid schedule: Wed-Fri 9:00pm-12:00am EST
---
We believe in raiding smarter not harder; most of us are established in our careers and cannot dedicate 20 hours a week to raiding. Our current raid days were discussed thoroughly and should be more than enough time to clear content in a reasonable amount of time. We understand not everyone will be rushing to 60, therefore we have decided to enter raids no later than 2 months after release. We expect our raiders to show up on-time and prepared with consumables; we strive to make our 9-hour raid window as efficient as possible. 
---
**Loot System: **
---
EPGP (With loot council for certain big-ticket items)
---
**Recruitment: **
---
Recruitment is currently wide open – We’re considering all classes with emphasis on healers and tanks. Please let me know if you have any questions at all, I’m always available via direct message(Sanc#3765). Feel free to stop by and check us out! https://discord.gg/bjefAA7
---
Yes they did exist, here's a clip of Kevin Jordan confirming they existed since day one  [https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride](https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride)
---
I used to see stuff like that all the time on there I'm pretty sure.
---
This seems false to me. Source?
---
"Dynamic Spawning is permanent"  It doesn't have to be permanent, Blizzard could disable it as soon as they think they don't need it anymore.
---
"Exploiting Layering takes coordination and communication with other players"  Not necessarily, you can abuse it with just a few alts and some macro for auto invite.  Some guilds are even planning to setup a few alts for all the guildies like that to abuse it to the max if it is possible.  Also on the beta, you can switch layer just by logging out and back in with a few tricks so you don't even need all of that even if you are alone.
---
Layering does ruin world pvp. A large amount of world pvp happen when a group of alliance and horde try to kill the same mobs (sometimes it can even turn into raid vs raid action if it escalate), this is the kind of thing that won't happen anymore with layering if you can just hop layer to farm the quests mobs instead of having to fight for it.
---
And there is plenty of footage of ruined world pvp events because of layering already.
---
You can find out quest levels too.
---
And it's the most useful you get.
---
Obviously not
---
1.  Name one issue with a server merge other than character renaming (of which has already been solved as an issue) that is not also present from layering.
---
2. Are they forced to re-roll if they want a better playing experience?  Yes, if they are not enjoying a server, they should reroll.  This is true with layering as well.  Also what if your friends want to play with you but your server is "full".  You can still create a character on a "full" server, but you are likely to have a queue, at least in the beginning.  This is a discussion to have with your friend.  After all, they'll be suffering from the same queue issues.
---
I dont think blizzard can push back the release date since they have already announced it and people have scheduled their lives around that date. Would be a dick move if they did and it would upset a lot of people.
---
Yes, is that data reliable though ? Like you said, you're filtering for a subset of the playerbase. If you rely on that info you're also discounting the possibility of Classic becoming the flavor of the month game. 
---
I'm not a data scientist though so maybe I'm just paranoid. The cynic inside of me says they did payed reservation because of greed, but I'm sure gauging player numbers is part of it as well.
---
Took years for my name to pop up on the armory from other players and even then it's just a handful. I'm taking my chances, hoping it won't be taken on my server.
---
 /thread
---
I don't think I've ever been to stonetalon peak in my 12 years playing. Are there alliance quests in all of kalimdor? I'd like to level there to explore it for the first time.
---
People just want something to meme about. If we use our brains we can see that 600 people across 5+ layers is clearly broken and way more heavily abused than 6k players across 2-3 layers.
---
I've seen plenty of clips of people that were either killing or kiting a mob who had it just despawn as they switched layer, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes.
---
Layering doesn't really affect meeting people. I played on the most highly layered realm and I had absolutely zero trouble meeting people. It was a godsend when they started the layering because it went from 50 groups getting into arguments over wolves to a normal experience ingame. 
---
At every point in the stress test it was trivial to find people who wanted to quest with you, and I even made several friends in that short time period who added my battletag and we are now playing other games together. 
---
People are really, really overblowing it. Yes, there are flaws, but it's not this reality destroying abomination that will take away all your love and happiness from you. It's not even going to be permanent. I guarantee come September no one is going to know why anyone made such a fuss about it in the first place.
---
Dude are you a mental midget?  Use the damn tool select the continent, level range and faction.  Click the damn link and try.
---
I literally just did what you are asking because you are too damn lazy to even try.
---
It's still mostly going to be true. The vast, vast majority of players won't have a lvl 60 for a few months, and even then there is a lot to do. No one will have multiple max lvl characters with multiple max lvl professions and 500 mounts.
---
I really do feel the same hype for a fresh restart, even more than I do have hype for classic specifically
---
Yes definitely. The ones in the US though get shut down and in quite a bit of trouble fairly quickly now though. I think it’s just easier for blizzard to track down and sue on the US side.
---
They didn't mean minor in terms of the difficulty of fixing the bug. They meant minor in terms of how much it affected gameplay. A really simple bug could have major effects on gameplay and a really complex, hard to solve bug could have little to no effect on gameplay.
---
If I had to guess the retail community has found interest in Classic and are making their presence known.
---
Are you both Quasimodo... that's some mean lean.
---
hahah i played it cause my parents didnt want me to play all day so they canceled sub after 1 month xD
---
Laugh because its not a dwarf.
---
Or escorting all of the mechanical chickens...
---
If we're allowed to pick chain quests I was always fond of the Legend of Zelda reference quests that starts off with [It's a Secret to Everybody](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=3844). 
---
Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are among my top 5 favorite video games and it was really cool to see references to the Zelda series in general in the game, plus Un'Goro Cater is one of my favorite zones.
---
Oh yeah. The fallen hero one is freaking great.  Love how the conclusion involves getting teleported to the top of a rock spire and fighting a dread lord who has a knock back, conveniently punting unsuspecting players to their death.
---
just a subtle glow or drop shadow will fix it. black or grey. problem solved.
---
Layering will be gone by the time you have a lot of things 10x your level.

Check your PM! We have some well known hordies with us ;)
---
We know how layering works.
---
Not evrryone is hitting 40 by phase 2
---
This varied quite a bit depending on server.
---
No yiur just trying to win a pointless arguement over layering when you cant actually point out a game breaking problem also i didnt not read that bullshit text o wall of yours
---
Dwarf rogues  have stoneform and can reset fight if shenanigans like this happen.
---
I recommend a mouse with 12 buttons and assign your first 12 keys as 1 2 3 etc 
---
Second set of keys shift 1 2 3 and if you.need another 12 keys I use alt 1 2 3
---
Good thing the scepter isn't unique :)
---
Where is the "players seeking guilds" category? Can you provide a link?
---
Buy Logitech g600. Wonder how you ever played without one.
---
Because they aren't an evil faction, they are outcasts.
---
If they implement classic correctly they probably won't even need to.
---
For the moment they can't even do that so the server may retain some popularity (especially in europe).
---
Guilds definitely take way more than 2-3 Rogues. Why would you take weaker specs over one of the best DPS in the game? With around 30 DPS spots to fill, you can expect 6-7 Rogues per raid. Them, Warriors, and Mages are some of the best there are for all of vanilla. If you were only taking 3 Rogues, what would you replace them with? Hybrids? 
---
Also, it'll be interesting, as almost every poll conducted shows Rogues being #5 or even #6 in terms of most played class. So we'll see!
---
We don't know yet. They were added over two patches 1.7 and 1.8 (ZG and world dragons) so it's likely they will be delayed until phase 2 or 3. Some of the items are very good at 60, and seeing as they are delaying the 0.5 sets they will probably do the same thing with the class quests (that is viewing them as lvl 60 gearing content that needs to be delayed rather than levelling content that should in at launch like the 50+ quest hubs).
---
I was torn between NE hunter and Dwarf rogue, pet pathing and a few other hunter bugs will make me start as rogue.
---
I wasn’t in PDx, I was in Elite Order! Warrior tank named Che (Tse in Deathwing)
---
Leveling with daggers is viable with a partner, especially one with taunt.
---
Now this is a good idea!
---
What did he say?
---
Great story and similar to mine. Me and my buddy still recount the scourge of the Gurubashi realm, Starsky and Hutch. This alliance duo incessantly harried us throughout our grind to 60. We longed for the day when we could return the favor...and we did. Good times.
---
I think there are SOME quests in the north and maybe near the logging area, but even as a horde player, I never levelled there in retail vanilla.  I regret it too, that's one of my favorite zones now!
---
Of course it's on a hunter. That class is so fucked in Classic lol
---
Start farming herbs when you are abroad
---
That one extra energy from autoattacks is CRUCIAL!! Who cares about 45dps and double hits ? Wait... double hit... That's 2 energy? Ironfoe is amazing!
---
No decursive sure. But where have they said that Vanilla WoW functionality won't be available in macro form? Decursive was changed before Vanilla ended so it makes sense that it wouldn't be allowed. Changing the capability of macros (even if we leverage the Legion API) wouldn't be beholden to the goal of authenticity that Blizzard is trying to hit.
---
Deep ocean vast sea,  separates the boys from the men.
---
Who's this retard?
---
I could be completely wrong but I think the raft was some sort of reference to Journey To The Center of the Earth. 
---
Again could be completely wrong but for w/e reason I think of that.
---
pls stop calling it world first it's rly cringe and does you more harm than good.
---
You responded to the OP calling him entitled. That doesn't make it a discussion about entitlement, it illustrates your inability to reasonably take part in a discussion.
---
Back then WoW was THE game when you talked about gaming. Everyone knew about it, and you were a god damn nerd if you played it. 
---
Now nobody knows about it except old school gamers.
---
A fast weapon makes you spam sunder faster yeah, every day something new 😂
---
No idea, I'm sure the questline has a lot of lore and references, but I'm not that kinda guy.
---
Get to 60 quick, then beg everyone I see to let me play an elemental shaman.
---
I’ll be in no rush to join any guild. If I find some other players during my adventure and I enjoy their company I may accept an invite.
---
Nah, he wouldn't risk losing the unique mount
---
It’s not just in the starter zones, that’s probably what you’re failing to understand.
---
Neither of those have any cc. Get polymorphed or out of range on both and cant do shit. Windfury is great, but shaman is very vulnerable for kite, warrior too.
---
Dwarf rogues are awesome. Other rogues will hate you lol
---
They are warriors. Not rogues.
---
It's not a world first if 99% of the population is locked out of the game, sorry.
---
Because I have experience on pservers I have already joined a guild from a pserver, since I know them in advance.
---
For any new player I would recommend joining a leveling guild just for social reasons, and move on when you hit 60 to a guild that fits you.
---
Agreed
---
Organized horde vs Organized alliance comes down to a pretty solid balance of who gets an entry kill on a significant class. If a paladin somehow gets 1tapped out the sky, it shifts greatly to the horde. 
---
But say the paladin sees the Elemental mastery PI burst coming and either bubbles or a mage catches the initial cast with a CS,  suddenly its in the alliance favour of the with the horde being atleast 2 major CDs down.  
---
Its the beauty of the factions. How they balance eachother out like that in large scale and alllow for the team work to tilt the scales in favour of whoever did the thing.
---
I hope so, and I played in one.
---
Lmao I played on detheroc during 2007, had no clue about this.
---
I first played this game when I was 11, it's not a hard game to pick up, and kids these days are usually smart and able to adapt, just let him play what he wants. I started off with warrior and then moved on to shaman.   
---
*Just don't let him pick Alliance \*cough\* \*cough\*.*
---
Same, but elemental shaman.
---
Sure, if the majority takes 3+ months to hit 60.
---
Rogue: No ranged or AoE. Spend most of your PvP games in stealth waiting for opportunity. No portals.
---
Mage: Buffing and making food is around 2 min+ downtime. You will do this a lot. You will go oom very quickly in 60 PvP until later patch epics.
---
Wups rage* idk why I typed energy lmao
---
keep blaming people for trying to save the game.
---
Already joined one.
---
it was "mainstream af" as in the general populace laughed at people who played WoW. even other gamers did. it was "mainstream af" as in being the only MMORPG that mostly anyone (at least in america) could name off the top of their head. it wasn't "mainstream af" like CoD and fortnite are "mainstream AF".
---
I‘m going into my preset guild, but if you have no obligation to look beforehand, just join a guild, see if it works out, otherwise join a guild of a random you enjoyed gaming with in a dungeon which qenr smoothly, in og classic i foud a guild like that and actually stuck with it quite a long time and made progress into naxx 🙃 starting off with mc
---
If you want your whole raid to have that totem you need 7 shamans (considering you don't put one in your tanks group). Also it's air so it removes WF for melees. It's cute that you think you know things but eh, sometimes you have to think.
---
Trolling the leveling guild is vital for keeping your sanity while you kill boars.
---
Or you could be less of a boner about a goofy joke.
---
thats....pretty unique. i went to 3 different high schools between 2006-2010 and in all 3 it was only the nerdy nerds that played WoW.
---
I would much rather have zone sharding throughout the entire game than layering.
---
We did some of the fights in molten core with a feral tank. It was fun. But this was well after everyone had the gear they wanted. It's like saying you can't change an engine with a pair of pliers. You certainly can, but it going to be alot easier with sockets and wrenches.
---
but it’s not a bug.
---
You should’ve sat in the Forest, killing boars
---
Be ahead in the leveling curve and become friends with some likeminded people when we are doing lava runs and my heals are on point, thus getting asked to join.
---
Wouldn’t be in a 19 BG to begin with.
---
There wont be 10 people in your zone mao
---
yes, and servers will mainly fill up consecutively, not parallel. People dont seem to get that the first server will be full INSTANTLY and then have a plethora of guys joining after their friends to keep it at 3-4h queues..
---
Don't buy razer products if Logitech sells the same type(mouse). Razer is pure garbage.
---
You're right, it's a new system. Which they've been experimenting with and testing extensively.
---
This is precisely why i would choose to have absolutely no phasing or layering of any kind. I've done multiple launches of private servers and every retail expansion. It's a nightmare, but well worth it imo. Makes it feel like a genuine world, which is somewhat lost when someone can just phase into a different reality randomly or of their own accord.
---
That’s great. But that doesn’t reduce server strain with thousands of people.
---
Name important diseases in pvp? You're horde so no DPlague.

Searched for quite some time to get there, completed it, expecting some cool rogue stuff to do, only to find there wasnt anything except pickpocketing for a reputation that had no associated rewards.

Also, isn't the proc rate on the pservers way too high?

# Tesief here. Holy shit did I not expect to see this post. I quit Kil'jaeden as well as WoW around 2008.

okay, okay. That was just a juke but I had good intentions with it. I wanted to raise your hopes a bit, OP. I really do hope you find him. This overall is a pretty wholesome post. I think it's amazing that two old friends can sit down and reminisce about having fun in a video game. You don't see it very often. WoW left a big impact on so many lives. That's for sure.

Definitely. Subreddit is still exploding in size. People who do want to try out classic but don't really understand the importance of things like community or economy, since those have long lost any meaning on retail.
---
Lol it's a meme you goob
---
Yes it is
---
No I understand that. 
---
Maybe I didnt explain it properly. 
---
I just dont understand why people are complaining so much about it when blizzard has already said they will be taking it out of the game later on. 
---
I ensure you I would rather have no layering at all and suffer to get quests done but at the same time I'm okay with layering as long as it is removed eventually.
---
Mages are very difficult to gear up in raiding.
---
Their T1 and T2 sets suck. Compare the BiS lists for mage and rogue. Rogue BiS includes their tier sets. Mages for the most part doesn't.
---
Mage AQ40 BiS weapon drops from Visc. No one does Visc... maybe as like a bonus boss after Cthun.
---
I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that mage BiS is practically unobtainable.
---
Mages also only DPS on maybe 2/3 of boss fights. In many fights their just spam-clicking the top line of the decursive addon or spamming tab to find mind controller people they need to sheep.
---
The worst part of being a rogue is that outside of suppression room you're unnecessary and your job is done better by a fury warrior. Other than suppression room rogues are just there to use the rogue tier gear that drops. Fury warriors do better DPS and can shift to an offtank role when necessary (e.g. 4horsemen). Meanwhile rogues don't even bring a raid buff to the table.
---
No it counts as a polymorph and can't be removed by anything else than dispel magic and taking dmg

**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Progression**
---
**About Us**
---
&lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again.  Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing different expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW.
---
**What we provide**
---
We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character.  We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**What are we looking for**
---
We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game content, but not at a hardcore pace.  Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content.  This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate
---
Raid Times: Our current raid times are tentative, but we’re looking at raiding Sundays and 1-2 times during the work week.  Most of our members are located in PDT and CDT time zones.
---
- Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT
---
- Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**Recruiting**
---
We’re actively recruiting all classes and specs.  Our current roster is available here.

If you have further questions, please let me know!
---
on retail you can literally just pull like 10+ mobs together and effortlessly AoE them down and then move on to the next 10+ mob pack with no downtime.
---
Even if you hit 60 the first 2 weeks you won’t notice because you will be too busy leveling. 
---
Would you really care about random Joe the warrior questing in the same zone as you and then he’s just gone? Is that really game breaking enough to quit the game over?
---
Is this the one where you have to kill the the four mini bosses in the giant cave?
---
&gt;It's a meme
---
Does not make it any less cringe.
---
What if hunters were bugged for the positive of hunters this whole time and this was the bug fix
---
Some will close voluntarily, some will move to emulating TBC. The number or at least effectiveness of C&amp;Ds probably wont change
---
Combo points in vanilla = i cry.
---
Not having refreshment table.
---
You must not have played vanilla.  One of the MMO world themes is seeing the same people in game over and over again, both allies and enemies, forming relationships one way or the other.
---
You will never see the same people again with layering.  If you have say... ~10 layers, that other player you met earlier is now one tenth as likely to encounter you again in a situation where they normally would have.  Since relationship forming was already a unique event depending on a conflux of circumstance, you're unbalancing that on a scale that will make it nearly non existent.
---
Don't get me started on how it breaks immersion, unnecessarily streamlines leveling, and hurts world PvP.
---
Of course, none of this matters. Blizzard has shown throughout the years that they are piss-poor at seeing the ramifications of the changes they implement.
---
imagine getting upset and technical over a meme
---
Oh no dude, in his mind he knows everything you have to do to counter everyone. He just doesn't do it because you know, bad luck :'( But trust he's amazing, try to hit him, SEE WHAT HAPPENS, SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
---
Wow what guild are you going to be in because I definitely don’t need that negativity
---
"Retail bad" is the punchline
---
PVP Trinket removes Poly. But that's something both sides will have.
---
I was being snide. I don't think anyone would actually think poly counts as charm.
---
I'll be sticking with horde, mainly because I know the leveling areas and I just prefer the horde capitals over the alliance and dueling outside org cant be beat.
---
lol its so cringe dude not very yeet of him POGGERS IN THE CHATTUH LOL XD
---
The thing about NO CHANGES is that you couldnt be nuanced about what small modifications to add or not add, so it's easier to stick to that mantra and then adjust what changes will actually be good
---
And what's the difference between sharded zones or layer hopping in regard to immersiveness and a persistent game world? Nothing. Layers are essentially really big shards after all. But there is a difference when it comes to gameplay exploits. 
---
Here are the pros of sharding the **low level zones only** (NOT CROSS REALM ZONES, JUST SHARDING THE POPULATION OF ONE SERVER):
---
* If you only shard the low level zones and leave the high level zones as one server for all players in them then you remove most of the exploits possible as most of the materials worth exploiting are only found in higher level zones.
---
* You don't get the congestion in the low level zones so people have a smoother questing experience at a server launch. You also don't get server queues as new low level zone shards can be created as demand rises and removed as demand falls.
---
* You don't get dead realms due to tourists who will very likely not make it past level 20. This is essentially the same purpose as layering (dividing up the server into sections so as to not overload the capacity)
---
The **only downside** is the lost immersion with people disappearing/appearing in those low level zones. But given that with this system you have a persisent game world once you are in the 20+ zones it's a small price to pay. Also, considering that people can disappear in an instant when invited to another layer there is practically no difference to immersion between this system and the current one.
---
We know that zone by zone sharding is already in the game given how cities work (you may have seen the post on the front page of the player leaving Ironforge and all the players out front suddenly appear). It's a no brainer if you need to have a limited number of servers and need to prevent

**&lt;Circle of Dominus&gt; | US PVP | Alliance** **Well Met Adventurers of Azeroth!** 
---
We welcome any adventurer looking for a Semi-Casual raiding Guild where you can meet new people for the ultimate Classic WoW experience. We believe in a non-rushed, friendly leveling experience where both veterans and new players can thrive. This isn't an exclusive group, but rather a fresh new guild open to any background.  **Raiding:** After reaching level 60 and creating the core raid group, we are looking to spend two nights a week from 9-12 CST raiding, exact days will be ironed out once the group is formed. We will use a Loot Council for distribution of gear. We are not a hardcore group and will not require you to grind out 24/7 or have the best gear ASAP, but we still want members to do what's necessary in order to complete the raids. We welcome those who never raided with open arms. Open Roster except for tanks.  
---
**PVP:** We are looking to form groups for Phase 3 &amp; 4 for a casual PVP experience. We again welcome players who never done PVP combat and will teach them how to dispose of the Horde. 
---
**Social:** The sense of community is what makes Classic WoW a Classic. We are inclusive to all types of players, from the hardcore Grand Marshalls and Kel'Thuzad slayers to the curious new folks first learning about the world of Azeroth or casually playing the game. We have a discord server where players are encourage to hangout and chat together during their journey, and have direct contact to the GM and Officers 24/7 for any questions. We are not here to belittle those who don't have the grasp of the game, but rather encourage a positive learning experience and a fun overall adventure! 
---
**LF Officers &amp; Class leads:** If you have a good background in private servers/vanilla Raiding and PVP and want a chance to lead, we are currently in search for our future Guild officers &amp; leads! PM me on Discord if you're interested. 
---
Hope to see you there!

You are a dime a dozen.
---
I want to be on the cleanup crew for the oogas. I stealth and wait for them to kill and then i get in there and cannibalize. Feed me, oogas!
---
Blizzard wants to make money and people will say fuck this and quit if they are fighting over boars for hours you realize.
---
Accept that people want to be able to actually fucking play and GET OVER IT
---
Because  you've been watching too much history channel.
---
Lazy Peons, hands down!  I frequently consider not turning in the quest just so I can keep the Foreman’s Blackjack and beat peons forever, lol.
---
Would love to go back into Kara as a level 70.  I always thought that raid was epic.
---
There is no evidence that they even can remove it later. We only have Blizzard's word for it, and that isn't really compelling for a number of reasons. The man one being: what does Blizzard do when server pops are sitting around 12k still?
---
Yup. Teldrassil is my favourite start zone for this reason.
---
Is this english?
---
well after a month you would use server caps and ques which dose that job. layering is should only be used to take care of the first wave after that older methods work fine
---
Rush to 60, farm BiS, see who needs a warrior tank/OT.
---
Between pvp trinkets and grounding totem/cleansing totem, etc., I think its a pretty good combo that shouldn't be too susceptible to cc if played correctly.  However, I still think Holy Paladin/Arms Warrior is pretty much the best combo overall.  They can be countered by any combination of rogue/mage/warlock, but even with a combo from those classes, a paladin/warrior should be able to beat them when played correctly.
---
For the majority yes. There will always be people who want their own private server.
---
Thank goodness someone told us, NOBODY has posted this yet.
---
Yeah dont compare beta to actual  classic. Being capped at 40 you can only do the same.thing for so long before you're bored. When the actual game releases there will be so much more to do and prepare for.
---
I don't know dude, alliance draws people who want to play reckbomb paladins and spend half their day sitting down getting 4 crits by a mob and try to oneshot a clothie later.
---
You wanna know who's gonna have the advantage in wpvp? The faction that gets hardcore Pserver guilds. If you roll horde on the server APES are rolling alliance on well good luck.
---
Extra attacks are always made with the main hand. Picture the scene: Your dual wield warrior rolls up, Ironfoe in the main hand, Thrash Blade in the offhand, Hand of Justice in your pocket, windfury totem nearby. Your guild makes fun of you for picking up both mace spec and sword spec, but what do they know? You and an alliance warrior lock eyes across the Gulch. He sees your mismatched dual wielding and comes in for the "easy kill". He comes in, swaggering with confidence, but what's this? You're no warrior, you're a hailstorm. You have no fewer than FIVE sources of extra main hand attacks, all of which have a chance to stun. As your countless blows rain down, permanently stunning your foolish opponent, you gloat over your unorthodox victory.
---
Except in real life, nothing procs and you die in seconds because your gear is trash.
---
The dream
---
Okay, I admit it, that was pretty funny.
---
It's not 2004 anymore. In vanilla the server cap was 3000. The private servers have a cap of around 15,000 people. If some neckbeards in a basement can do it then I'm sure Blizzard has the means.
---
I'm in Wisconsin also and can vouch for electrician work being a genius plan. They're in demand and make a really good living, and you don't need to go a billion in debt for it.
---
/pours one out for all the millennial school loan debts out there
---
I mean it sounds like a cool ability but the whole classic+ is not my thing. 
---
It does feel kinda.. custom? Like it's way too advanced, it does so many things to make it balanced that it just becomes kinda strange?
---
There is no evidence they can't.  So now I can either take the word of the people with the actual code, or the word of a random Chicken Little on Reddit.
---
"no u". Sick argument.
---
Dont use this for wow. U will destroy ur arms and backs
---
Watched this live last night. Alphy became an instant legend.

But what if you hit harder than they regenerate their hp?

I think our guild may be what you're looking for. PM'd.

# &lt;Rockstar&gt; [Alliance][PvP]
---
Semi-Hardcore
---
raids: 2-3 weeknights + 1 weekend TBD
---
EST 7pm-12 timeslot
---
**OPEN RECRUITMENT**
---
**Vision:**
---
The premium semi-hardcore Classic WoW experience. Designed to fit a working-person's schedule, this guild will have something for everyone including consistent raiding, PvP, or just chilling. Leadership will strive to be transparent, fair, and effective at making raiding goals and group play events a reality.
---
**The Four Tenants:**
---
1. *Have a Good Time*: Enjoy the game and have fun with guildmates and friends. Make it so.
---
2. *Achieve Excellence*: During raids and PvP, play to the best of your abilities.
---
3. *Be Efficient*: Find creative ways to maximize the value of your time, especially when with others.
---
4. *Maintain Balance*: Respect everyone's real-life time and responsibilities, through keeping realistic expectations.
---
**Raids:**
---
Progress &amp; supporting raids \*limited to 3-4 nights\* per week. Farm is less nights, specific nights depending on need. Loot council will give drops to characters to benefit long-term progress. An alt is encouraged to enable more raids, splits, and scheduling flexibility. Attendance requirements will be more relaxed when compared to hardcore guilds.
---
Expect groups to be going often.
---
**GM's "about me":** 
---
Former veteran of US-first raid guilds Vodka and Blood Legion, between WotLK and WoD. Coming back to Classic as it's a more relaxed and social environment! Using the leadership skills learned over the years and in-depth game experience, am developing a guild from the ground up that shares my vision and can sustain as a home for like-minded players.
---
**Discord/Contact**
---
We are looking for various levels of players: officers, raiders, PvP-er's, and casual. Go to the discord, find an admin/officer, start a conversation. (If you aren't sure yet, that's not a big deal)
---
[https://discord.gg/gDQMChH](https://discord.gg/gDQMChH)
---
The world wasn't designed for 15k people and it's obvious with mining nodes and closed areas like mines. It was the worst thing about private servers.
---
I'm wondering if the popularity of TBC private servers will go up.
---
It's fine you didn't, your personality was captured in the first sentence.
---
If you didn't read the text wall then you don't know if I pointed out a game breaking problem.
---
Also that's a stupid thing to justify a change "it doesn't break the game".  Well if you replace every character model with Jar Jar Binks the game's still playable, it doesn't mean it's a good idea.
---
No, they have perception (on use, not built in), +10% rep, +5% spirit and +5 weapon skill for maces and swords
---
Yeah it does because I like to have fun and not be so serious about a kids game
---
;7
---
Ok fair enough. I didn't realize they had actually banned for something like that in the past. That gives credence to your idea BUT I still think the precedent is a bit off. Abusing the free roll system is a bit less of a gray area than jumping around for nodes in my personal opinion, but I guess we will see. Thanks for the correct info.
---
As far as the actual impact I don't think there is enough info to be sure one way or another. On paper it makes sense that there should be some consistent ratio of nodes to layers to people. BUT it MIGHT be the case that sometimes too many layers are spawned based off population thus too many nodes thus diluting the supply:player ratio. It would also be weird for your realm to sometimes feel like a high pop realm and sometimes feel like a low pop realm based off the inconsistent layering tech. This concern is somewhat unfounded, but so is the idea that there will be some fixed population per layer; afaik blizz hasn't released much info on how layers will be created/destroyed or how consistent node spawn timers will be across layers. I would be hesitant to say one way or the other until we get to play with the tech.
---
Nailed it
---
At that point I see Blizzard conceding that they will have to open more servers and give free transfers to them. The layering system exists because they think that there will be a massive push at the start that will fall off very quickly and prevents having excess servers. But if there are insufficient servers for the long-term popularity of the game I doubt Blizzard will have any problem adding more servers because they will have a stable base of paying customers.
---
Yep!
---
There are as many different playstyles as people. My brother in law made a rogue and was then dismayed when 60 rolled around and no one wanted extra rogues in the raids. He would just stealth as far as he could into Stormwind and instances solo to see what he could see. My daughter (8 at the time) would collect Darkmoon Faire stuff and pets. My mom would just chat on there like it was Facebook.
---
The AV bridge can be countered by going backdoor but it requires a bit more brain
---
You were probably playing the stress test, which I believe is over now. Other people are on the beta
---
Can you tone your autism down plzzzz
---
you are stupid
---
One guy making fun of another guy's gear.
---
Unlikely.  Top end guilds like stacking warriors and mages/locks. Rogues are there to soak up a bit of loot and kick.  7 in a raid would be folly unless it's a horde windfury speed clear.
---
Maybe that won't even release the game!  After all, we only have their word for it that they're releasing it at the end of August, right?
---
I'm gonna join Asmons guild and get him Thunderfury :)
---
Thanks for the links, buddy!
---
The things is layering doesn't kick in after number x players, it's always there as a load balancer for the cloud servers. So if there's 600 or 6000 it's going to layer them to put as less stress on each machine as possible. Because even though that machine may be hosting layer 3 from a server it could also be hosting layer 2 from another, shards from bfa, etc. at the same time. This is what happens with cloud based computing instead of dedicated machines for each server. It's all about keeping costs down for Blizzard. That's why they were all excited like "yeah! We found a way to spin up classic on modern hardware" because they did, they figured out how to integrate it into the new cloud network they've been using, they never had any intentions of not having a form of sharding/layering. Which is probably why they're so quiet about it, they know they have an issue here, it's just so fundamentally integrated already they can't come up with another solution, easily.
---
Follow Asmongold around and give him all my gold/rare items off-stream so that he invites me to his guild /s
---
For real though i plan on just trying to be social and meeting people. And making friends and then joining a guild with them. I do already have 4 RL friends who will be playing with me so if they meet some cool people i'll prob just follow along as well.
---
You don't have to take my word for anything. I am proponent for releasing a game in  way that I know works: without layering. What does Blizzard do when server pops are still sitting around 12k going into phase 2?
---
There's no guarantee that layering will only last the first month. It could be permanent if player levels don't significantly drop on some servers.
---
Just because there’s a cap doesn’t mean there’s no stress until the cap is hit. 
---
Private servers are fucking horrible with literal hundreds trying to do the same quest and mob tagging not being a thing. Stop trying to act like private servers were great and smooth.
---
You guys do realize the first period wont even have anyone on contested zones. Who fucking cares
---
Oh thank god. I felt my entire body shudder when I saw that setup and hoped there was an explanation for it. :')
---
Yeah his whole post was about how he is entitled to not have layering, and how entitled he is to keeping his name after a transfer, or how entitled he is to have a stable fair economy. 
---
You're so entitled you cant even recognize it, you think it's just normal lmao
---
They said they would remove it so it believe them when they say that. 
---
Why would server pop matter in late phase 1/2 the reason for layering was to help the leveling process and load balancing on the servers when they have 5thousand plus people logging into the same zone at launch. By late phase 1 and 2 layering wont be necessary because everyone will already be 60 and spread around the world. I also dont think servers will have 12k populations.
---
It’s a catch-22. Player demand is very much “make this easier and more convenient”, game developer makes everything easier and more convenient and players get used to it and demand more and more.
---
Net result? The entire game is on auto-pilot. 
---
I really hope Classic proves there’s demand for an MMO that goes back to what made them so popular in the first place.
---
Oh k I must of been playing the stress test, thx
---
Based on what people are saying on the stress test they're not waiting until the 3000 cap per server before it gets divided into layers.
---
Harsh.
---
I don't think you understand the resource exploitation. But have fun qqing about empty areas while I stockpile black lotus/thorium
---
This sub is fucking cancer. I can smell the BO from here
---
Well they're not going to release it without layering, so you are wasting your time.  I don't care what happens a few months down the road when there are still 12k people.
---
All I need is 40 per side so I can sit in AV.
---
We're replacing every character model with Jar Jar Binks, BUT IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS!

**&lt; Thot Police &gt;** Alliance • PVP • CST • English 
---
**Introduction:**  Thot Police is an Alliance guild that is comprised of officership and many raiders with pserver+retail KT clear/ late Naxx and numerous Cutting Edge experience. Our goal is to create a guild culture that focuses on high-end PVE/PVP gameplay and a sense of urgency to progress through content but most importantly a place to call home for all of classic. 
---
Ambitions:  Server firsts, while we all used to be in 5+ raid days/week we aim to take it a step slower and labeled as semi-hardcore.  
---
Schedule: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays 7pm-10pm CST.  Will most likely stick with 1-2 days until AQ40/Naxx but will utilize Thursdays if there were hiccups in clearing the instance. Sundays will also be optional 20-man/alt MC+BWL clears once the aforementioned instances are on farm.
---
**Loot System:**  **Suicide Kings for class specific items, DKP for everything else**
---
**Member Requirements:** 
---
**-80% or greater attendance**
---
\-Mechanical Awareness in Raids, DPS+Meter Padding will always be secondary to this
---
\-Farm the necessary consumables prior to raids.
---
\-Able to minimize toxicity in a social context
---
\-Reviewing our strat materials/videos ahead of time that will be posted on the website. (website in progress)

Are the servers capped at 12k? Regardless, there will be 12k people on your server. Good luck.
---
As melee I would take windfury over salv every day of the week. Maybe during progression salv is better but once your tank is comfy enough with wearing more threat gear windfury is better than salv eleven times out of ten. 
---
That said if I was playing anything other than melee dps I'd go alliance this time around for sure. Blessings really just are that good.

Me and my two brothers are starting a casual guild for casual minded people Meme specs welcome.  Just looking to do fun content with cool people and enjoy the expansive world of warcraft.
---
I joined a random one from recruitment.  Hope it works out well.
---
This is remarkably short-sighted.
---
&gt; Well they're not going to release it without layering, so you are wasting your time.
---
This is remarkably accurate. touche
---
Regarding warrior spec. Before getting MS it seems to be the majority advice to suggest 2h fury. Most youtube guides etc is going to tell you that. I'm rolling a warrior and I'm going Arms right away though. Reason is tactical mastery to a large degree. It makes for a more fun gaming experience, the class feels smoother. Also improves your tanking in all early dungeons.
---
Go back to playing retail please.  Leave Classic to the people that want to fight over boars.
---
This was a weird comment to read as someone currently cutting weight for a powerlifting meet. 
---
It was weirder when every other bit of advice applied to me as well, even the python part (but I’m going w java and SQL rn since my current employment uses them)
---
You put in the NE druid fp from nighthaven to darnassus, but not the tauren druid one to TB
---
Why does 2008 have Ahn'qiraj footage
---
nah they are forced to remove layering due to world bosses can't have more than one player when world bosses are around
---
Holy shit that was gay. I showed my gay friend and he turned straight from reading it
---
Lol i sorted that out a while ago
---
This is why the game should only have PvP realms.  Send spies over to that guilds side and report back where they are, and have the entire server gank every guild member anytime they set foot outside a city.
---
They might not - in fact, if layering is still bugged then I think they shouldn't. What does Blizzard do when server pops are still sitting around 12k going into phase 2?
---
Shhh, don't spoil the tricks. Let them all be stuck there while we rush past and go back for the quest completion
---
Cool, now I'm entitled too. Is this some generic new insult? I thought calling people marxists was still all the rage.
---
You say that until day 1 when half the population quits because pops are too high to do anything
---
This is also reflected In How Microsoft reacted to Halo online. The guys developing it thought they had permission from 343 but as soon as the first patch went live and it started gaining traction Microsoft stopped then from further development
---
Yeah that's what I'm hoping. And yeah thay week will suck.
---
I was under the assumption you can't see trade chat, etc from other layers. Usually you are in Org trade chat when LFG or LFM.
---
Sure it is.  If you are in the middle of a fight, we'll say PvP, and your friend invites you, you'll only accept it if you're losing.  Happens all the time with LFG in retail.
---
Counter Strike dude! Even CS Source was out!
---
I personally dont want to commit just now.
---
I want to find a guild that has all the people at a similar level of interest as me, 
---
Maxing in 1-2 weeks and quickly farming BIS and gold. So i have little maintenance to do when it comes to end game play and am back at work and caring for my family. 
---
I presume the people who will be max then will just either invite me to a guild or we slowly create one.
---
Escape artist has a cast time and zero immunity tacked on.  You can be immediately re-slowed/rooted as soon as your cast completes.  
---
wotf is insta-cast and comes with a small immunity after.  It's hands down the better racial.
---
It's a beta, what if they are layering before the cap to test it? Wait until the game launches because only then we'll actually know how it will work. The beta might not be exactly what the game will be.
---
Looking forward to it!

The only caveat I see is rogues can't run out of mana
---
I did play vanilla and hit 60 prior to DM release. I’ll take layering over any other thing. Unless of course they fix layering to prevent layer hopping abuse then I’ll take that.
---
I’d rather not have forced server merges. Server migrations or transfers have been proven not to work as they didn’t work in vanilla. You know where dead realms popped up just a few months into the games life.
---
I seriously had an emotional moment when I created my dwarf paladin during the stress test. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, and then I started using seals and attacking and actually reading the quest text...
---
... And it just hit me. Classic WoW was truly magical.
---
They could make it work at meeting stones or you can change layers at inns. It prevents people from abusing nodes, etc as they'd have to run back
---
With layering the whole plan is for them to have the populations of 3-4 servers in one. Which would be around 12k if not more.
---
&gt; everyone will already be 60 and spread around the world.
---
Uhhh - those two are mutually exclussive
---
&gt; Why would server pop matter in late phase 1/2 
---
Overpopulation at this point would have ramifications on: the economy, ability to complete quests, world bosses, server stability and potentially create long queues.
---
Lol what kind of reply is that?
---
You also didn't kill a Titan in Vanilla, so you're probably a little more humble about your skill.
---
Noice. 
---
Maybe you can get esfand sulfuras too.

---
You're welcome. :)
---
I dont play that trash lol. But youre stupider than you sound if you think blizzard isnt going to do what makes them money. I hope they leave layering for a year to hear the retards whine
---
Any recommended builds that will be good for leveling and pvp with daggers?
---
If it's a 3000 cap per layer in the beginning then it won't be that bad. If they divide it to where it's only a few hundred per layer it will feel like playing on a dead server.
---
Speaking as a mage. You're doing it wrong. :D
---
How do you upgrade the Valor set? I can't remember but I remember it was a pain. I never did it
---
That makes a lot of sense to me. I think that my 12 or so key combat abilities could be on the mouse and a few keybinds around the ESDF.
---
It might work that way for other applications of similar tech but that doesn't mean it is how it will work on this. Unless you are a Blizzard employee working on this exact tech, everything you just said is speculative.
---
This right here. To avoid the drama don't ever join a *New Semi Hardcore Raiding/PvP Guild With Wordpress Package* guild. Just see how long it takes you to get to 60 and then join someone who actually raids and has raid times you can make. 90% of new guilds forming with grand aspirations will crash and burn and be full of drama while doing it.
---
I dont give a shit lol. Being a no lifer in wow isnt cool anymore. People are gonna think youre actually disabled
---
Maybe their wing span is like 18ft and they’re some secret species that also happens to enjoy some world of Warcraft 🦑
---
They offered that first, backlash was so bad they gave us layering. If people would’ve just been happy with sharding starter zones layering wouldn’t be a thing.
---
Hey there my in-game name is Odi but we're starting a Horde PvP/Raid Guild with 2 raid teams. Our name is Oblivion and we will be considered a semi - Hardcore guild. The goal is to be huge with the community! The 2nd raid being on sat/Sun morning more than likely but times are still to be determined. Were going to be a pretty serious Guild with a big community and multiple raid teams. Lots of alt split raids for core raiders. Lots of potential to raid and see all the content. We would love to have you as one of the first members before launch! Hope to here from you!

It certainly used to when it was a 30 second immunity. Personally I think it's a greater advantage against priests who telegraph their scream by running towards me
---
We don't take applications at the moment
---
I could still want to group with my friends.
---
OP Florian, could you pls share addons list you’re using?
---
Maybe not by design then. I was a bit more careful in my wording on one of my edits. But it has certainly been an acceptable side effect since it's inception. I assume they banned the extra loot roll while it was in its infancy, creating precedent early. It's easy to say that exploitation is a bannable offense but I don't think the majority or retail players, nor blizzard, even see it as an exploit at this point
---
Gorak's Guide is criminally underrated.
---
I wish you the best of luck finding this man! I have a very similar experience playing vanilla Rift when it came out. Me and a friend were always in Warfronts and we'd always be right around the same level as these two Guardian faction players: Cartman and Damaxx. 
---
The WF's were always pretty easy to sway the tide when we came in with our focus target burst and Taugrim spec'd warrior chloromancer combo. BUT, every time we ran into these two, there was a real battle. We both knew that our two 2-player squads were making a big difference in the match, and would go right for each other. 
---
It got to the point where as soon as we entered the WF we would check for those two, and had macros to set them as our focus targets and mark them to focus down. Neither of us will forget those 2 names, and I'm curious if they remember Kaelith and Obamallama.
---
No offense my dude, but where are you pulling this from?
---
Why would a guild stack Warlocks over Rogues? Warlocks do less damage and have to manage threat. Rogues also out DPS Mages until Naxx. You need a balance of Warriors and Rogues due to weapon/armor types.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=36433&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=58417 -- 6 Rogues
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=36261&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=58112 -- 9 Rogues (probably a tad excessive)
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=36312&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=58209 -- 5 Rogues
---
Long story short, 5-7 Rogues is not uncommon. You'll see a healthy balance between Warriors, Mages, and Rogues.
---
God damn. Thats a game I havent thought about in almost 10 years. Thanks!
---
Another solution is to allow you to change layers at meeting stones or inns. The goal is to prevent people from abusing layering to farm nodes, etc as they'd have to run back. Layering is in place to prevent 3hr queue times and allow people to play. So I can't see any other compromise.
---
And you've just proven why nothing you say matters since you don't even care about the game. Why even post
---
But did you join the dog guild?
---
So they arnt allowed to test their laying on the beta? Got it. 
---
Do you know how dumb it would be if the game was normal the whole time and as soon as someone breaks the cap, layering starts out of no where?
---
But that's exactly what we want late game. We want resources to be scarce and valuable, we want world bosses to be difficult to kill because other people are also trying to do it. We dont want everyone getting free loot and gold it should be a challenge.
---
Even after launch. I’ve read blizz thinks it will be big at first and then small. Others think it will stay large. I don’t care how big or small it is (that’s what she said) layering will be bad. They’ll do it for BC too cus everyone will wanna rush to it.
---
rogues literally bring nothing to the raid other than damage. getting downvoted but i'd bet good money unless there's a lack of warriors / locks / mages you won't see more than 2-3 rogues in top end raiding guild's progression comps. fury warriors literally bring everything a rogue does with the ability to off tank.
---
Incoming neckbeard rage
---
17 mins since the last layering topic.
---
I really really hope that they fix this, otherwise Hunter is not viable
---
Those early level caster Murlocs are the things of nightmares
---
Weird how the only potential "outplay" is one person escaping from 3 people who aren't trying to kill him. 
---
I don't even know what to say to someone who thinks every spell cast juke or kick land is an outplay.
---
Ttue. Nevertheless, transmog is a puny word for fashion.
---
Have you been in this sub long? Its a bunch of manbabies whining
---
I've never seen a sub quite so useful for farming downvotes.
---
Ypu can currently take pets 2 levels higher than your hunter level and they retain that level ie a level 40 hunter can have a level 42 pet
---
Ha. So many people asking for that now.
---
Ty man, its just what i put together for the Beta
---
Yeah once they give more insight into how they plan to adress the layer problems we can actually start panicking, single person layers shouldnt be in.
---
Except when the server crashes because you have 10K people in Azshara.
---
I don't have the G600 but I have a different logitech mouse with just two buttons on the side... I've owned it for a couple years now and have never used one of the buttons...  I have been thinking about just using it as another modifier couple of modifier options on top of shift but just never got around to trying it.  Hoping classic is that chance!  Do you think the numerous buttons as the abilities themselves is better than few buttons as modifiers is better?
---
I will play like a non derranged normal human. Get some outside hobbies and you may as well!
---
So you them to start layering with only a few dozen people per layer? It's like playing on a dead server. You can't even see players from other layers in general chat.
---
Horde will be more popular because it's edgier.
---
I raided as a shaman first, but then finished vanilla as a horde fury warrior.  I know how sexy WF is,
---
But my guild was sweaty enough to consider faction transferring for Naxx release.  We came to the conclusion that alliance was head-and shoulders better at pve than horde due to Pallies, but that trying to get everyone to faction change wasn’t worth it.
---
Extra damage doesn’t matter on a boss fight if there someone already has too much threat
---
Outside burns my scales. Git gud and stop qq
---
I think the only fight where you don't want Ironfoe (considering you don't have TF) is Vael. You just want a 1.3 dagger to spam HS with endless rage.
---
So yeah, he's retarded.
---
How are you not entitled? 
---
I only call people who shill cultural Marxism marxists. Just like I only call entitled gamers entitled.
---
Just thought it's kinda funny deciding to take a screenshot in water with 2 gnomes and 2 imps there :P
---
I don't play retail, so I can't speak on the current climate around this issue on live.  But I'm fairly certain Blizzard would consider this an exploit and a pretty serious one.  If not, then I clearly haven't written them off yet when I should have.
---
I replied to someone else so I don't have the links pulled up but.. ya, that's just not true my man. Rogue DPS is amazing and highly sought after. Rogues have always, in every expansion, been brought to raids *because* of their DPS. The don't have to manage their threat and are #2 DPS until Naxx basically.
---
Private Server raiding guilds often have 5-6 Rogues. 4 is the lowest I saw on some glances, but still.
---
If you’re serious you’re going to get a normal epic mount in p1. The fact that your class mount isn’t available yet and the class mounts count as a spell and cost mana means it’s pretty necessary for any hardcore lock or pally to get their normal 100% mount
---
No one knows but probably.
---
So we're left hanging right now?
---
I totally see where you are coming from, but for me, I enjoyed 19 because I'm not the best player and it was easier to remember what class had what kit and how to respond accordingly.
---
I am going to join the first spam-invite guild that invites me. Then I will form or join dungeon groups with other people in the guild that are appropriate to my level. Over the next few days/weeks a small group of regulars that play and do dungeons at the same time ranges will have formed and we will do dungeons and group activities together. By the time we hit 60 we will have a group of at least 10+ solid players and a group of another 10 good players, that all play around the same time. Then it will be time to take those people and split off from the leveling guild and form a raiding guild for MC.
---
A free-range, organic raiding guild.
---
Maybe [do some research](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/asia/four-day-workweek-new-zealand.html) before making statements without any citation whatsoever.
---
It seems like a common thread for people to think less game servers means less hardware even though it takes the same amount of hardware to support 15k players whether they are all on 1 game server or 10.
---
Not to mention classic is more popular now than it was back then. So it would be even longer than that
---
I don't know if this will be trie for classic, but I played a rogue at release and it was probably my biggest regret. Rogues were massively overpopulated (at least on my server) and getting groups was almost impossible. They're good solo levellers at least, but I rarely got dungeon groups while leveling and it didn't get much better at 60. My friends all managed to get in a raiding guild but they were pretty consistently full on rogues so I just ended up rerolling. My prot warrior lived in instances and all was good.
---
Where's the STV ally FP?
---
I remember a guildie asking for my help on this quest. I would duel him while he was on the quest and give him Curse of Recklessness so he would be fear immune against the demon.
---
RAAAAAAAAAAW
---
I mean, you still need to form raids and meet at the insurance entrance if you want to really play the game. I understand what LFR is for, but people seem to act like THAT'S modern raiding, and it's not. Lfr is for people who can't/dont want to do a multi hour raid but are tired of 5 man dungeons. 
---
True raiding is still alive and well.
---
Unless they give us realm 3 layering. Everyone who played on realm 3 go bitch on the forums please. If you already have just ignore me. Just ignore me anyways.
---
The linken quest line where you get links sword and boomerang. The boomerang has a knockdown and the sword is huge for a one hander.
---
Cool as fuck bro.
---
Right? Yeah, this video didn't really capture the true evolution of the game like I was expecting.
---
How exactly is a boomkin specced?
---
2500, largest in your state. sounds like u lived in BFE
---
What add-ons are you using
---
Found the retail kid
---
They combated this by introducing custom spawn points for nodes, as well as dynamic respawns.
---
Looks like some good growth and polish
---
I mean, retail bad, classic good!
---
An air totem that effects one group.  
---
Shamans raid only as healing:  alliance melee groups get to stack buffs over 5 pure dps while horde only gets to use 4 dps and one healer (who is now NOT providing mana totem to casters).
---
When it came to Pve, Pallies and blessings just worked so much smoother (and more effective!) than shaman.
---
legends
---
Grenades aren't a true stun, its an incapacitation effect that breaks on damage.
---
Hardiness should not influence that on paper, unless its also coded to work with grenade-effects, which would be weird.
---
&gt;  it seems more to do with blizz having redesigned entire classes. My enhance shaman now feels like a warrior with building up maelstrom to cash in on other abilities
---
There were people in TBC who thought simple rotations were boring and didnt want to play them (which is fine, obviously). But then many of those people also started complaining that very simple DPS specs, such as the destro lock's one-button rotation, shouldnt be able to do as much DPS as complex rotations because it's much easier to screw up a complex rotation and tank your DPS.
---
So starting in WotLK and Cata almost every spec (even most healers) got some new arbitrary mechanic to deal with to make them more complicated. Eventually they relented at least on most of the healers, removing Holy Power charges from healadins and the green version of holy power from Monks.
---
But every single one of the DPS specs continue to have some gimmick that you have to deal with in order to be effective. And my number one hope for future content is that they dont try to make every spec equally complicated to play, since at least some of us like simple rotations and they can make some specs feel pretty distinct.
---
Same.  I'd rather have an authentic experience than the economy be destroyed permanently in the first week.  People seem to be under the impression that you need to be 60 to maximize layer jumping &amp; exploiting resources.  
---
Here is what is going to happen.  Smart players are going to hit level (x) which will allow them to exploit the part of the market they plan to corner.  Then rather than focus on leveling, they are just going to exploit said resources until layering is removed.
---
funny, I'd say gaming is more and more toxic than it used to be. bet normies are bringing their toxic nature from social media to gaming...
---
The point of the last test was specifically to test layering at different amounts. Each realm had different layering styles. They wanted feedback on what people thought was good and bad.
---
I just saw you have Jordan B Peterson in your name and assumed you subscribe to his vitriol. Surprise surprise, I was right, and that's exactly why I don't bother responding to anything else you have to say. Like Mr. Peterson, you have nothing worth saying.
---
On Warsong we had an NE hunter named Avatar who did the same thing, luckily i was alliance as well and my teenage self looked up to that hunter as the end all of wow eliteness back then.  He was in his 50s when the rest of us were hittin 30s. I remember he kited a Blasted Lands demon through elwynn on us which blew my mind back then.
---
A At 60 myself and a few of the guildies were in some of his earliest attempts on Onyxia, he was the raid leader, didn't get the kill with him but our guild (Which ended up being &lt;Forceful Entry&gt; on Gurubashi if any of yall out there!) competed with his for raiding firsts.
---
He was notorious for taking melee weapons, and only having 1 other hunter in his raid team lol, I believe his guild was &lt;Corp Hur&gt;
---
But you can in /world. Custom chat channels are server wide.
---
Cum tributes.
---
I'd say it's a win-win for them.
---
And at least I'll be able to get my 3 character names reserved for the price of $7.50 if I don't play WoW for the rest of the subscription period I paid for.
---
I think you and me see it differently - the issue is that in the case of the idea you support is that you might end up melting together chocolate and C4 - and that won't lead to a very good outcome.
---
Whichever faction is more populous on your server.
---
For reasons that should be obvious to everyone outside of Gerard Butler, Keanu Reeves, or Bruce Willis.
---
If you are interested in changing factions we would love to have you as a member of our guild if you want to check us out? My name is Odi and we're starting a Horde PvP/Raid Guild with 2 raid teams. Our name is Oblivion and we will be considered a semi - Hardcore guild. Priority is minimizing raid times to as fast as possible. Organized raids fast pace raids! The 2nd raid being on sat/Sun morning more than likely but times are still to be determined. We're going to be a pretty serious Guild with a big community and multiple raid teams. Lots of alt split raids for core raiders. Lots of potential to raid and see all the content. We would love to have you as one of the first members before launch! Hope to hear from you!
---
Hey, gotcha! That was my first thought after sending the comment. I'm happy either way.
---
Yet the most popular vanilla servers are hosted in Northern France
---
&gt;Lose your name because someone else on other server has it. Now no one outside of your guild remembers you
---
&gt;Losing your guild name for the same reason.
---
First of all, this was very rare, as not only did someone have to have the same name as you, but you have to fall into the "forgettable" category, and servers aren't merged often.  Second, this has already been solved.  You just have groups of servers Arthas 1, 2, 3... 11, 12, 13, etc, where the name pool is shared, and those will be the servers that can be merged (even though many likely will not need to be).  You'll still have the same naming freedom as if you share a pop 30k server with layering.
---
&gt;People manipulating the economy. Server merges can make you rich buying items on your server that are cheaper than others before a merge and selling them off after.
---
As opposed to having an AH shared by 30k people, many of which use layering to reap obscene benefits by layer jumping?  Come on man...
---
&gt;Understanding your problem and being able to estimate it early on, and being willing to delay something that isn't finished, are the real ways to avoid crunch. 
---
AKA actually being able to run a company.
---
spread the final numbers? so they're going to be merging realms?

Shadow priest &amp; warlock. You’ll both be after a lot of the same gear.

Druid/warrior is one of my favorite leveling combos.
---
Says who? Sounds like a huge assumption based on... idk?
---
Gotta admit my silent rage-jealousy at everyone who has friends to have a WoW LAN party with. I've barely ever had friends IRL that played WoW.
---
I was fine with it when it was announced. I’m ok with layering, mainly cause I understand the reality of people leaving after launch.
---
Vanilla had low pop (read: dead) servers just a few months after launch and blizzard did free server migrations/transfers to combat this. Vanilla which had a steady population increase the whole expansion ended up with dead realms. People who think classic won’t end up the same without something to help, are a different kind of delusional.

It's literally designed to be phased out.  That's why they are layering and not sharding...so they can easily combine the layers into one homogeneous server when it's not longer needed.
---
Ain't that the truth!

Yep, no one should roll on Ironfoe, it's garbage. ;)

Wait, isn't that too quality Gameplay? What's the point and the sense of achievement of a game so easy that you can log in to?

Its the exact same reason i played a druid, and the exact same reason ill play a paladin.
---
Stay feral if you like, you can tank everything, pritty much. At the release, when everybody is running around in blues; druids will be the prefered tank class (12k armor unbuffed in just blue gear), and at the same time; you will be able to heal every 5-man without the biggest of problems, AND dps in every raid. On top of that, its a very stabil solo farmer, and pvp is viable. 
---
 Feral druid will always be the ultimate utility class, since it can fill so many roles without having to respec... I hope you will stay feral, and feel how real freedom feels like xD
---
both are megaboring to play
---
Show me an example of that please :). 
---
Show me a server with thousands of players and only seeing a few dozen. 
---
If those players arnt on my layer, can’t see the mobs I’m attacking, can’t see what I’m attacking, why would I want them in my general chat?
---
I will probably try and join the biggest leveling guild I can find. Then my plan is to do a lot of dungeons. Going to play a warrior so I will tank. Hopefully I get to know some cool people and at 60 have a friend list that isn't pathetic. And hopefully someone on my friend list will have a guild that could use a warrior tank or dps. 
---
 Joining a guild right away would of course have been much easier but I enjoy pug:ing and meeting people that way, assholes and geniuses both. The assholes at least makes the runs memorable in some way.
---
So I see a lot of comments here about finding the right guild after hitting 60, but I feel like the bigger issue is finding the right server first. How do you know which server will have people who haven’t already formed a guild? I’m worried that my gf and I will get to 60 within the first two weeks, then have an issue with finding a guild who will raid during times we can make it. I’m on PST timezone, so trying to find people that play on similar times. I figure I’ll let my skill speak for itself, with name recognition when the game goes live, but it still makes me wonder which server do I join. THATS the question impo. 
---
Also, I haven’t committed to one guild before launch because I agree with others, there will be a lot of empty promises. I think some groups will be too relaxed to my playstyle, so I don’t want to commit and feel bad when I /gquit

Never saw vanilla?

---
Paladins were not so much better that a horde guild who couldn't clear naxx could magically clear it if they traded their shaman for pallies. Man... rerolling just to be alliance for the tail end of an expansion just strikes me as an unbelievably bad idea. I'm glad you guys decided against that because wow..
---
i'm talking about end game Naxx / AQ40, i dont really care what happens in MC. probably should've clarified that. rogues drop absolute dicks in MC / Ony / BWL. still wouldn't bring more rogues than warriors tho
---
You have to have one shadow priest. But only 1.
---
I’m going with a feral Druid and a priest while I level enhance. All after different gear and all being utility. Also have tank+ heals already to go for dungeons or tough quests.  
---
If leveling as a duo have one that can tank and one that can heal is really much more efficient and fun, I feel
---
And you ignore the Michael B Jordan, and got triggered by Jordan B Peterson. Ignoring the fact that it's just a silly name portmanteau, nothing more.
---
Projecting your own insecurity there.
---
Running away because you canr deny you are entitled.
---
I’m not telling my friends what to play. I’ll give them advice on what’s superior to others but outside of that idc.
---
They just need to make old content relevant. Have actually useful professions and mats drop in old instances that scale to your level. Have seasons or reincarnation or some kind of system to give players the FRESH that Diablo3 and Path of Exile gives them. There are so many obvious ideas that Blizzard is definitely pocketing until they are bone dry. Just like the waterproof iPhone. These companies aren't morons like they appear to be. They just understand the long game and are trying to make as much money as possible.
---
Apple can guarantee money in the future by holding back obvious money making ideas. Same with Blizz.
---
Unless they really are dumber than the smoothbrains posting here. We'll see if they manage to fuck up Classic. I'm very excited to see how they handle year 2 and the future of Classic. That will determine if I finally drop WoW forever. They have such obvious choices like launching a FRESH for us or a season or reincarnating characters or something. If they just do nothing or force everyone into TBC, then we know they really are idiots.
---
... I have?
---
I think the pserver scene is smaller than some people want to admit, but I also feel like they're the majority of the minmax crowd, if that makes sense. They've enjoyed the game longer than most and Classic is just another notch on their belt (but better, 'cause it won't get randomly deleted).
---
Thanks for clearing that up. I was hoping it was just a tone thing, 'cause you sounded pretty nostalgic at the same time! I agree fully that stopping to smell the flowers (so to speak) is gonna be important 'cause we won't get this fresh launch reboot thing again (even new servers wouldn't be the same as the first launch servers on Aug27), but I'm gonna 50/50 my way to the cap. I'll give it a serious go but I'm not stressing myself out over it!

I'm going paladin when vanilla release but I'm not sure what race to play human or dwarf?   
---
what do you guys prefer and why ?
---
it was possible, but it was an exploit for sure, you had to use the mailbox to get this to work as the enchant would bind the item to you when applied. 
---
What you had to do was put the boe shoulders in the send slot in the mailbox, and start applying the enchant. Right as it was about to finish, you had to click send on the mail. The timing was super tricky, but you could enchant the shoulders and mail them at the same time. On the receiving character, they would bind to you as soon as you opened the mail, but you could wear them, no level restrictions from the enchant.
---
As Wow Classic is running off the same client as retail wow, this exploit will no longer work like it did in Vanilla.
---
don't you understand this logic is what got us BFA?
---
 "i can only play on weekends I don't wanna spend 2 hours trying to put together a UBRS group, give me raid finder!"
---
sacrificing the integrity of the game for peoples convenience is not the play champ
---
But muh classic xpuriance
---
Pick up **Sven's** **Revenge** in Duskwood, and once you're done with that quest line, find **The Howling Vale** in Ashenvale. Make sure to read *everything*, from the quest texts to the journals you'll come across. 
---
Easily one of the most mesmerizing story lines in the game. 
---
I love the way the two quests intertwines. There's nothing hinting at the other quest line existing; both are located on separate continents, and the quest givers are tucked away in the furthers corners of the zones. Even if you found one quest I doubt the average player would ever stumble upon the second.
---
1. merging economies, guild names, "server first" honors and notoriety diminished. Theres a reason Blizz really wants to avoid server merges, they did it in the past and people seriously disliked it.
---
2. The first part of what you typed doesnt make sense.. Im saying they would be forced to re roll if the playing experience became bad for them because of the overpopulation, which is what layering would avoid. And im not talking towards just the "full" warning but the idea that a full server might actually lock to allow more characters on it
---
My goal is to go Enhance and get Hand of Rag, but will probably offspec resto to help.
---
Holy shit I didn't know that. Not gonna lie I'm fuming about that 😂🥺😫
---
I remember reading he sold his wow account so he could afford the GYM membership... the ultimate sacrifice
---
This subreddit is just a bunch of rehashed memes and "just recovered my old account" threads, plus thinly veiled pokes at retail. 
---
That or just bitching about the bugs and layering
---
So far me an a buddy are choosing between Shaman/Mage, Warrrior/Shaman and Warrior/Priest. I like the utility of shaman/mage a lot. Double slows, Aoe spells, wipe Prevention, totems and mage water/Biscuits. But we are looking at other options. Shaman/Mage is the front runner.
---
Mage is kinda squishy if you're not frost spec.
---
So is it impossible or is it deemed too expensive? There’s systems to solve any problem the issue is you need to care enough to invest in it.
---

I have a group that wants me to feral tank for them, so I'm gonna give it a whirl.  I was going to roll warrior but they asked me if I would play a druid and truth be told I'd rather go druid than warrior anyhow.  I just want to tank, I'll play a warrior, but if they want something else, that's fine by me.  Shit, I'd give enhance tanking a whirl if it was actually a viable thing in raid content.  It's really too bad they never fleshed out an enhance tanking spec over the years.
---
Why would you bother?
---
Tbc quest though
---
I’ve played an sl lock. It’s a snooze fest. Congrats you can kill anyone 1v1 with a face roll spec. 
---
But it’s boring as shit, you have no mobility and do no damage. Anyone can just walk away. Even a rogue with out vanish can just walk away and live through the pitiful dot dmg.
---
Gl with whatever u want to play though.
---
Damn bro rip the feelz. I been reppin the legacy at raves since his death. We're all gonna make it brahs.

just as easily you can find the opposing side. i'd argue in terms of utility it makes more sense to bring fury warriors if we're talking end game naxx and AQ.
---
I did research, and I am swedish. I found the same link as you, did you read it? Did you even look at the picture?
---
I think the tables slide over the chair arms so you can sit at whatever distance.
---
I'm not the guy you were arguing with and I'm not going to call you entitled per se, but here's the issue:
---
You are willing to apply changes to a game designed to replicate Vanilla that we can almost all agree effect gameplay negatively.  You want these changes implemented for quality of life purposes.  This is the "retail" mindset that people pushing for Classic have been fighting for a long time- the idea that minor inconveniences to the player are bad and must be removed, without realizing the impact that will have on the game as a whole. (Not really referring to queues here).
---
So basically the anti-layer mindset (exaggerated a bit) is "the gameplay is going to suffer significantly because some people can't bare to sit in a queue for 15 minutes on launch day"

I am sure there will be tons of guilds spamming. Plus you will meet people running  dungeons and  get invites if the experience is positive.
---
That was how it was in vanilla. Pretty organic.
---
This is hilarious.
---
No time like the present to learn a new language!
---
Honestly, I picked up my first bits of Japanese in Final Fantasy XI because there were no language-separated servers. You would however see different populations log on at the respective playtimes. Obviously, we couldn't communicate well, but there was a English &lt;-&gt; Japanese system for common terms, commands, spells, items, etc.
---
Years later, I would find myself playing with some of the same folks now-and-then, slowly figuring out new words to use (hiragana and some kanji) and they would figure out practicing their English with me. I still talk with some of these folks to this day and am glad for the enriching experience.
---
Just don't forget that English is still a common language and many people use it as a second, third language. You can expect in public channels to mostly see a common language, so /ignore'ing people just isolates yourself and likely will just make you more bitter as you decide that it's basically a dead game because you can't find groups and/or refuse to change with the times.

---
Horde. Horde just attracts more vagabonds and cut throats. No path is not watched by a couple rouges.
---
Uh... I don't want anything to be easier in game. I want to be able to LOG IN to the fucking game. Not wanting to stare at a timer on a screen is not asking for the game to be easier you dolt.
---
So if you’re alliance and fly from the top of Felwood down to Azshara, would you fly over hyjal?
---
It's not the beta, just leftover from the stress test.
---
horde know gnomes are the master race so they have to project by attempting to kill gnomes. if couse they fail because they're bad at the game and cannot compete with gnome thiccness.
---
The initial numbers they expect to be far higher significantly that the number at phase 2.
---
Which is a primary use for layering preventing server merging.
---
I started in 2005. I remember the install taking forever, then updates took hours, and when I was finally ready to play I had to wait in a queue to get in.
---
As far as gameplay, I remember taming my first pet, buying bags for 25s, and deleting my hunter to reroll a mage with the same name.
---
No shit lol
---
So much hurr durr look how far you have to lean forward!
---
How are people not figuring out these things will button up right to your chest? This is a god damn cockpit setup.
---
There were exactly 2 horde guilds that could make it through BWL on my server in 2006. It all started getting good when we beat Ragnaros for the 1st time. The guild leadership poached the top one or 2 people from the next 10 guilds under us and we accelerated into the stratosphere after that.
---
probably the scholomance key.  seeing a town of ghosts is uber leet.
---
warrior is basically the special needs kid in PvP from 0-59.
---
Fortunately for the rest of us, this discussion was never about what you, personally, find boring. If you found SL lock PvP boring, then you weren't very imaginative or good at it. That's nobody's problem but yours.  
---
Yes, overcoming our mobility constraints was one of the many exciting facets of playing the class. Your own points are hilariously contradictory.  
---
GL with whatever u want to play though.
---
Why didn't they just ask him what year it is?
---
I’d argue that a Warrior who will Tank has a way better shot at playing casually and yet still gearing up than any other class. 
---
1 Tank LFG &lt;insert any end game dungeon&gt; will get you a dozen whispers, you’ll build up a friends list and soon you’ll be getting whispered within seconds of logging in.
---
This still applies. Go make a new character in goldshire and don't use heirlooms and pull 10 murlocs.
---
[A][PvP][NA]
---
Long time veteran player. Cleared everything in Vanilla except Kel'Thuzad. Located in Germany but rolling US servers so everyone speaks English.
---
Rolling Holy Paladin and want a guild with decent Europe raiding times. I know there are many others that will be doing the same thing I am, due to the language barriers Blizzard has decided to ignore. I haven't seen any guilds recruiting for these time sin this thread yet, however.
---
They're terribly slow to level, entirely gear dependent, and need a healer in PVP to compete.
---
hey said they dont
---
Same, but I didn't do it alone, was super fun to do as a group of hunters all taking turns together, with some guildies for buffs.  We would share tips, goof off, generally have fun while we all worked on the quests.
---
Cars aren't made of steel shields... There are of stuff that's meant to crumble when it gets hit hard...
---
Why would you say that Mages are good all the time? I'm thinking of rolling one for classic but was thinking it might be a bit slow to level because of how squishy they are?
---
I'm not arguing either way except that I dislike server mergers. I get that there's pros and cons to any decision. What I feel strongly is that it's shitty for someone to reply to a post sharing an idea or opinion by completely dismissing it and calling someone entitled without meaningfully contributing to the discussion. Regardless of whether you're right or wrong or anything else, that just makes you an asshole.
---
South East of Stormwind. How the fuck did I pull them all AGAIN?!? Those were good times...
---
How do you know?
---
My buddy and I are altoholics, so we're gonna have a few characters. 
---
We're going this route:
---
Main - Warrior (me) + Priest (him)
---
Alt - Shaman (me) + Hunter (him)
---
I've mained Warrior all throughout retail and private, so naturally, I'd play one again. He actually mained hunter in retail, but wants something different and thinks healing on a priest sounds fun. With that, I told him I would heal him on our alts so he wouldn't be a heal bot his whole classic career. I actually leveled a shaman as an alt with his hunter.
---
2004?
---
This true, but you have to have a shadow priest. But there can only be one.
---
Overpowered as fuck. If it lasts 30 seconds, it should have an hour cooldown at least. Warriors get Retaliation/Shield Wall/Recklessness which last 10 seconds i believe, and are on a shared 30 minute cooldown.
---
In TBC.
---
Well this is even the new player experience in wow now. I remember starting in legion and people were complete dicks when you were still learning to tank or heal.
---
If you're gnome, it's a good spell to bait counterspells with because if it is CS'd nothing is silenced.
---
Honestly I'd pay that easy. So would most of my friends. I'm glad they aren't doing that though.
---
phase 1 apparently
---
Cars are meant to crumble. Steel shields aren't meant to crumble. Cars also aren't made completely of steel or a heavy metal.
---
I started out with a 12 button mouse, theyre 1-12 with the 11 and 12 being + and ´ so i keybinded those ingame so i could use them. This made it so used my 5 and 8 button much more giving easy accces to those and over time i got used to clicking the other buttons. Then i (as a right handed person) started using f and g since they easy to press, then shift+f and shift+g, then t and shift+t and shift+y. then i started using shift+z, sshift+x and shift+c. and then at the end i began using shift+q, shift+e and shift+r. So the next step for me is to start using shift+1-12. 
---
So what im saying is that start slow with some keybindings for the cd's, and then just keybind more and more buttons until you have enough. If you keybind everything to begin with, you'll get overwhelmed and it'll be wierd to press them and you wont know where the different keybinds and what they do are, so i also suggest to not swap the keybindings around all the time etc. f and g is low cd spells but not the main spells like sinister strike or heroic strike, shift+f and shift+g are the longer cd's at around 2-3 min, and shift+e is sprint or jump for me and shift+t and shift+y is my defensives. So when you swap chars, dont make completely new keybinds.
---
I’ve played every class and by far the most boring class I played it was the paladin. Mage in the hunter I like the best
---
First and foremost, ESDF &gt; WASD.  Shifting your movement keys one column over gives you more room for keybinds.  Make sure your left/right keys are set to strafe and not turn.
---
Map your most common/reactive abilities to the easiest keys to reach.  For example: as a Mage, I want Frostbolt to be easy to reach because I use it constantly.  I *also* want Ice Block to be easy to reach, because even though I don't use it that often, when I need to use it I need to be able to react quickly.  I don't need stuff like Amplify Magic or Conjure Water to be as easy to reach (if they're even bound at all).
---
You mentioned being familiar with macros, so incorporating modifiers (Shift, Alt, Ctrl) into your keybinds is an easy and effective way to save room on your keyboard.
---
In Classic, I don't think those 12-button mice are necessary if you set modifiers carefully.  The mouse I use has two thumb buttons plus mouse wheel/middle click, and I've never felt like I needed more buttons even post-Vanilla.  Your mileage may vary depending on your class and personal preference.
---
As another commenter mentioned, practicing keybinds on a brand new character is a great way to transition.  The rate at which your character learns new abilities is very conducive to learning and practicing keybinds.
---
Vael was probably the most frustrating. Not really because we wiped so much to him (although that did contribute some). But instead because we were a mostly casual guild, which meant most of us didn't have flasks or other buffs, and everyone was in whatever T1 they had collected in MC. So we didn't have the DPS to carry people in unviable specs. 
---
A friend I invited to my guild had been playing as a ret paladin, because he liked Arthas smacking things with a huge hammer in WC3 (before he became the Lich King). But after my guild had been stuck on Vael for a few weeks he was given a choice to either respec as holy and heal, or not get invited to BWL raids. He didn't want to heal, so he basically just quit playing entirely. Losing friends to shitty class balance was probably the most frustrating part of vanilla.
---
Hello everyone,
---
since i got a few DM's and some questions about the UI
---
The BETA has limited access to addons, so none of these are WA.
---
Yes i did everything myself and yes there is still work to do (redundant buffs etc.)
---
This is the Addon list that i used.
---
The answer the main question : Unit Frames are Pitbull
---
[https://imgur.com/VQMlUY0](https://imgur.com/VQMlUY0)
---
link to wallpaper?
---
Just be like the hunters and accept your position or pick another...
---
1. Use the sane type of bindings on all your alts. If kick is "e" , so would be counter spell or pummel. ice block and pala bubble would also go on the same binding and so on. This was you dont need to relearn as much bindings on a new character.
---
2. Contrary to what most people recommend it is far from needed to buy a gaming mouse. You need 3 mouse buttons max ( nost mouses already have 2 side buttons and one mddle). Rebind them to "Alt" , "Shift" and "Ctrl". With this you can easily quadruple bind (nornal+3 modifiers) without playing finger-piano on your keyboard. Takes a little bit of getting used to, but **boi** did it change my playstyle.  i use a simple auto hotkey script, because my mouse is not reprogrammable and I only wanted the remapping  to happen ingame.
---
3. using 2. you should already have enough bindings + most people i pitched this idea to could not get used to it, but here it is anyway: dont use WASD to move. It kind of restricts you hotkey options to the left, because the keyboard ends there.
---
Yeah but that's because you're a clueless dunce. It's not your fault.
---
Think for a pvp perspective the gameplay of a rogue is  fairly more dynamic. Like you have to pick your fights, you have to time your vanishes and energy consumption correctly, and thus you have multiple options for multiple situations.
---
On the flip side, as a warlock you want to basically stay in the group and deal as much damage as you can while taking as little damage back. 
---
Not saying one takes less skill than the other since a skilled warlock can 1v1 anything, but it's just a more straightforward cookie when we look at what you're supposed to do.
---
Ofcourse, in the end, play whatever you like the most!
---
For sure, you absolutely can show the opposite. There are comps with 1-2 Rogues and some with almost no warriors. We're also definitely looking at speed clears with fury tanks, something not possible in Classic. This is going to threat cap DPS warriors a bit more.
---
I think healthy comps will see 5 rogues. Anything can work, but I'd rather spread gear better, you know?
---
You did however kill an Old God in vanilla
---
Seems like at launch it will decline unless all these people who say “I refuse to play with layering” are lying and end up do playing.
---
I played a Rouge on Tauren Mill
---
I mean no matter how boring a spec is, there’s always someone that will be able to bear it.
---
Good thing locks have much more fun builds to play as.
---
And it’s not just how boring they are, they really suck in all aspects of pvp except duels and 1v1 world pvp where your opponents don’t know how to turn around and push w.
---
&gt; so for their faction they make up 80 / 500 players, or 16%.
---
yeah I know math isnt a strong subject for most people but this is more of a simple "think it through" thing rather than math, you got it, I hope Khalku does eventually too :)
---
no changes
---
P1
---
bruh
---
For real? I always thought that going to places like underneath Stormwind or Old Ironforge was a bannable offense, so 10 year old me had some sick adrenaline rushes while going to those places.
---
I don't see the decline at phase, I see it at levels.
---
It's pretty much a given that three quarters of the people who join the game will never get past level 20. Classic subscription is free with wow, as I  understand it. Millions will try it for the novelty, hate the slow pace and leave.
---
Of the people who are actually excited to play classic for classic, I imagine about a third will quit between levels 30 and 40. The easy xp will be gone. The low level gear will stop being helpful in quests and mobs will start hitting a lot harder. For anyone one a pvp server, these are the zones where it really starts to get fierce.
---
you mean pornography?
---
Lul theyre all nerds woth no gf of course theyll play no matter what
---
Maybe it has to do with what country you grew ip in as well? I also remember pretty much everyone being into it, but I'm from Denmark
---
This. Get to 60 any way you can. Then spec holy and get ready to heal. In my old guild they would duel for shadow priest job. We had the same fellow for a long time, he had just the right kind of fast twitch moves  and no one could beat him.
---
13 years those posts are 2006,
---
nah they won't be in the same guild. probably gonna get McCool it if asmon doesn't ninja it LUL XD
---
Needs RGB!
---
Day one, when everyone is sharded to their own single player level.
---
All they have is booty bay :/
---
The encampment they have in the north doesn't have a flight path.
---
If you're playing on a PvP server, early solo PvP is really rough. Warriors generally aren't great in 1v1, and that's really magnified when you're missing a lot of crucial abilities like Intercept and Berserker Rage until you're in the 30s. Many other classes get the tools they need to beat you much earlier on, so you often don't stand a chance unless you get the jump on someone clueless.
---
The amount of people saying horde just shows how many people here don't know much about Vanilla.
---
Can mods take care of this troll?
---
Yeah, they really have to put their foot down.  No free wow games or they could lose a court battle if too much time is spent ignoring the pservers.

He's also played orc and human rogue.
---
Thats from Questie
---
Yea 😳
---
Thousand Needles? Maybe?
---
No they weren't. Hopefully it's an add-on...
---
Shaman and Paladin are definitely NOT the least played classed of their respective faction. On Horde Shaman will land anywhere from #3 to #5 in popularity. 
---
Paladins are probably a smidge higher for alliance since they are heal gods.
---
We'll probably see dips and spikes around Retail content, since playing Classic means having a live Retail sub and a lot of people will be drawn back in to check out content.
---
I think once we've been in Naxx for 6-12 months we might see some serious drop off, especially since there will absolutely be a new retail expansion out by then.
---
The vast majority of players in month 1 will be a combination of BFA players checking it out because they got free access, and people that haven't played in mmos in 3+ years checking it out for nostalgia. Some of these players will stick around, but a huge number of them will drop out and realise they just don't want to invest the time in Classic.  
---
Given this I'd expect a very large drop off over the first 3 months before the population stabilises.
---
The worst id say is the leveling process and the best is running around with a pocket healer in pvp!!
---
30/0/21 is completely viable, but you are healing in raids and blowing people up in bgs.
---
Hunters in vanilla do not have focus. They use mana. It follows the same 5 sec rule for regeneration as all other mana users.
---
It is
---
Is he wrong?
---
No they weren't and they're not in the beta.
---
Haha I’ll just play a little here and there at my own pace :)
---
I think a classic+ is interesting to think about, but the problem is, that if we want to balance every class for their dps output and such, we'll end up back in retail.
---
Btw, have you seen the recent spelladin stuff? It's a build that stacks spellpower and specific items + consumables that can pull about as much dps as a full on dps class. Might be interesting to take a look into that.
---
We get it; you were bad at SL lock, and you try to run from them every chance you get, so you're little bitter. No need to keep rephrasing it.
---
what shill propaganda stuff is this?
---
If they did Classic+ I probably wouldn't play it if they started messing around with the class balance
---
Leveling as fast as possible to level 60. I’ll either form a guild with competent people from late game dungeons, or join a guild that collectively hit 60 within the first week or two. Either way I want to go as hard as possible.
---
Biggest decline will be in phase 1 for obvious reasons. After that the biggest decline will probably be when AQ has been out for a while and the content becomes quite stale until Naxx finally comes out and everyone starts playing again.
---
TBQH I'm kinda glad I didn't get into beta, I've never understood  putting so much time into a character I know is going to be wiped.
---
That picture is from the beta taken a few mins ago.
---
Already am in one :) its nice that you know what you'll be getting into before classic launces, as the main line of goals and rules have been set already.
---
1-40 is like... 35% of the game.
---
You also realize they are releasing SIX waves of content after 60 and release? All over the course of at least a year or two.
---
I think your concerns are all in the wrong place.
---
Aren't potions on gcd, preventing instant backshift?
---
&gt;Do you guys think that Blizzard will close popular Vanilla servers now that Classic is on our doorstep?
---
Blizzard can't close something they don't own. They already go after servers that they can touch aggressively. They are hosted in countries that make it much easier to ignore C+D letters.
---
actually neither
---
I don’t know why people struggle so hard with reading sarcasm. It sticks out to me like a sore thumb.
---
For one, you don't need to call me names I'm not so bothered but it's not about how I personally feel, it's about the community at large. I will always respect the fact that people don't wanna see that shit, it doesn't affect me in any way if they change the item's name so why should I shit on someone else's feelings? I'm not that much of a dick.
---
Also, policing is exactly what they don't want to do, which is why they change the name so they don't have to monitor these things. Blizzard shouldn't have to babysit a bunch of grown ass men. They let a lot of shit slide for the most part but there are certain things that they will draw the line on and thats cool with me.
---
As horde, you have a huge incentive to start as orc, which means you have to start in the worst level 1-10 zone in the game, durotar.
---
Duortar is incredibly hard to level professions in, as it's a giant tunnel between the two quest hubs and basically everyone who walks through walks within sight of the walls at all times, which means every herb and node will be fully picked. There is extensive swimming, which warriors absolutely hate. There is a complete bullshit quest to kill scorpids in a timed quest... but the quest is a drop quest so grouping isn't good, and the scorpids put on a STACKING AND REFRESHING poision, which absolutely devestates warriors, as you can't even bandage fully with it on and if you keep fighting scorpids, you will never have it fall off and each additional stack is like 100 damage. 
---
You also have a lot of pressure on bag space as you will feel obligated to carry a shield and 1 hander even at levels where it makes no sense to do so, because people don't realize that it's perfectly fine to tank with a 2 hander in ragefire chasm. 
---
Beyond that, Gear competition. As the most gear dependent class in the game, you will have healers that want to roll on smite's mighty hammer, dps that wants to roll on every ring you ever have any interest in, and it can be tough to get groups for the very important early upgrades. 
---
Also, a LOT of the dungeon weapons are just not relevant, and the plate transition is a bitch.
---
It’s an add on.
---
... is that actually true? Do you happen to remember where you saw it?
---
Hierarchies are everywhere. Like humans, lobsters exist in hierarchies and have a nervous system attuned to status which “runs on serotonin”
---
Thats exactly how you get your best people poached, by guilds that can reliably kill bosses and get that sweet, sweet purple loots
---
Game release in 2004 /2005. Where did you get 2002?
---
If you are primarily going to do 5-man content: make a prot paladin or a feral druid, make a tank/healer spec, this way you can play tank in dungeons, and heal in raids.. Pure tanking spec on a warrior is so terrible expensive, its very time consuming
---
PogU Ez Clap
---
Worst part of mage: people will annoy you for drinks and portals.
---
Worst part of rogue: you are very squishy, and very cooldown dependent for survival. Without em, you're basically made of paper.
---
Yes, the queue system hits once you select a realm.  They would need to create a new queue system that you enter if you select a character that is in a zone that is non layered.  
---
The most elegant solution is to allow people to transfer layers when they group up.  But, try to add some smart algorithms that kind of play against would be exploiters.  E.G. instead of 100% of the time transferring to the group leader's layer, it will take into account that party member 3 has layer transferred 3 times 'recently' and the group is placed onto his layer instead.  
---
The important part of the equation most people are not carrying on is one year into the game, players will want to interact with other players.  Server merging 100 servers into 1 will royally fuck with the economy as it did when it happened last time.  That is more danger than a handful of players abusing layering for one phase of the game to get a lot of resources by trying to game the layering technology by group invites.
---
Maybe not code but the use a ton of actual assets derived from the game files, which definitely muddies the water.
---
How can you be bad at SL lock? It’s one of the easiest specs in the game. Actually it’s the easiest spec to pvp with.
---
Bro Avatar was a straight up gangster of warsong. So you were in corp Hur? I was in destination, I was the only white kid in a Chinese guild. It was pretty funny, but we were a good guild consistently 3rd place in progression on alliance side
---
Alliance draws White Knights
---
Horde draws edgelords
---
Both sides are mostly normal people who don't ***really*** care that much but it is funny to see which undesirables congregate on which side.
---
It's an addon called questie.
---
Hes right except for weapons.
---
Hands down the worst 1v1 class in vanilla.  Every single mage and hunter you come across while leveling will kill you.
---
Yes? When is it ever right to talk down to someone on the internet?
---
Not now when you can go to thottbot or some thing like that and get it laid out step by step. Figuring it out and doing it before everyone else was fun, though
---
Not really. 
---
No heals and exorcism and holy wrath have cooldowns so you cant spam them.
---
Kinda like bestial wrath.
---
I might be assuming wrong, but I would venture a guess that you haven't dealt with code before. Because of that I'll try and explain the issue. If I'm explaining things you already know, I apologize. When blizz decides they want a project completed (wow classic) they assign individuals to that project. These teams are built from in-house folks and sometimes outside hires as well. These people have to learn the project that they are working on. All code isn't created  even near equally. Take into account that they are working on an old outdated source, or recreating it. The learning curve was probably massive. The crunch time and long hours aren't something that you predict, otherwise you would just hire the people to do it, like you've said. They show up towards the end. Nagging issues in the code that can't seem to fix. Constant feedback from testers about things that need to change. Creeping requirements from your team leads about systems that need overhauls or whatever. Work ends up creating itself and adding bodies to the team doesn't make that work get done any faster because of the learning curve. If you hire a new person they need to learn the system. That either means letting them learn it on their own which is slow and they aren't helping you meet the deadline anyways. Or you pair them with a senior developer and now your senior developer isn't producing as much work until the new person is trained up, so you're essentially hurting your own production. 
---
Since we are talking about WoW here, I'll say this. Blizzard has shown that they allocate their resources just fine. They will kill projects and throw excess bodies on standing or new titles. This isn't blizzard refusing to hire people or not having enough people to throw at problems. It's the nature of the beast and the fact that they are beholden to investors and to a lesser extent the community to meet these release deadlines
---
Learn sarcasm.
---
EU or NA server ?
---
Just go holy if you wanna be strong as a pally or play retail if you really wanna be ret
---
I've already applied to one on here. I found it in a looking for group thread on Mondays
---
I mean, layering really is shit in its current form. In the starting zones? Ok. But continent wide? Even in capital cities? Just no. It’s going to feel depressing as hell being stuck in a layer with no one in it when there’s actually lots of people in a zone.
---
Barrens.chat
---
Thanks for the reply, I definitely know what you mean about rogues gameplay being more situational. Any input on the gearing and talent aspects for either?
---
I believe that unless you want to run dungeons, ret would be the best choice as it gives access to the 5% crit, 15% damage boost and seal of command, and all 3 boost your damage.
---
When hitting the 45 mark, switch to reckoning, as it will allow you to tank while basically doing as much dps. 
---
If you want to run dungeons, holy should be the way to go with consecration, as the warrior should be able to tank it all.

Coolio was not happy about Amish paradise and took legal action, and failed. I recall several artists despised him, including Michael Jackson. Weird Al won them all. Trust me what he does is very legal.
---
For me it was a level 19 twink troll hunter named Pizza. He was the GM of a guild called Pizza Hut on Suramar. My friends and I made some level 19 pvp toons and that guy would just farm us 1v3 whenever we came across him
---
That's an excellent way of looking at that
---
Only if you have 4 or more Warlocks, which is actually somewhat uncommon in raids given their relative scarcity compared to other dps classes.  
---
And even then they aren't necessarily shadow to indulge their own whims, they're filling the position because it's best for the raid.  
---
That's far different than, say, inviting a ret paladin to set the bar for shit tier dps.
---
Naw I wasn't in Corp Hur, I was in a smaller guild that eventually merged with a few others that raided together when they offered the free transfers to Gurubashi, I honestly cant even remember my original warsong guild, &lt;Darkness&gt; something?
---
I played a hunter and the only reason i got into his first attempts at onyxia was because he was just inviting anybody with a 60 at that point lol
---
I throw mine in the trash
---
Sounds like the player "Enemyrogue" over on LH servers. Guy would literally spend 6+ hours a day abusing safespots and sapping guards to kill the Horde flight master and any players he could.
---
You should at least vendor it really, it's the only use it has.
---
pretty epic lulz XD
---
Youre pretending anyone wont play because of layering. Either youre an idiot or youre trolling
---
That's because in modern WoW literally almost every top guild and players is horde. You can't compare modern to classic.  Been too many expansions where horde is just better so everyone has been faction changing over the years.  It won't be the same in Vanilla, alliance has better DPS racials and they have the paladin which is better for raids and organized PvP.
---
Rogue: when a feral druid hits you with Faeri Fire, or a Hunter throws a Mark on you.

---
The ones in North of the logging camp are the worst in the game. They're all in groups of three, which are usually not far from another group, have a ridiculous agro/link range...and they have potions.
---
I can't even begin to think about how many times I've died there.
---
Your attempt misses the mark.
---
You would get 2 whole exorcisms every 5 mins.  Not enough to do anything.
---
Losing every 1v1. Even with the best gear, winning a 1v1 vs certain classes is really hard

I get scared if I pull two mobs. If I pull three I just know I'm dead. It's worse at lower levels for sure.
---
Visc is figured out these days and killed every week by the majority of guilds
---
Kronos is hosted in Northern France? Did not know that.
---
No you're over thinking it a bit. Basically loans are cheap right now due to low interest rates. So for example, if you wanted to buy a 100k house, and I gave you 20k for a down payment, what should you do with that money?   
---
Option a) put 20% down  
---
Option b) put less down, and invest that money into the markets.  
---
Option c) put less down, and use that money as an emergency fund or invest it into the house itself.   
---
I think when rates are this low people should tend towards option 'b', and when rates are much higher then you probably want to swing more towards option 'a', which would be 15 year mortgage if you can afford it, but the more money down the better so that hopefully you are not paying on the high interest rate any longer than necessary. 
---
I over simplified, and there are other arguments for not putting down 20% right now that I know I'm missing, but that's where I would do some research to make sure what best for the particular situation.

I was thinking the beaches of Westfall under the cliffs where those gnoll camps are.

I've already committed to one with similar goals to my own.

How the fuck did you get that out of what I said?
---
I’m talking about respecting others and you think I’m still talking about layering?
---
well, did you join the dog guild?
---
The warrior quest chain to get Berserker Stance and then the Whirlwind weapon.
---
The amount of work and requests for outside help involved, coupled with the power spike after obtaining berserker stance and WW axe was about just right for each other.
---
You're basically getting a weapon that would equate roughly to a twink weapon at that level. But you have to work your ass off for it!

There was so much drama on the warsong forums back in the day. There was a whole website some dude made to document it all. You can find the web.archive of it somewhere. I think on the wowwiki or something page of warsong it links to it.
---
Avatar was a gangster tho, him and corp Hur ran that server for a long time.
---
Warmode? So BFA? This is classic not BFA where 80% of the population is horde.
---
It's between layering and eventual server merges.  No one is saying put 30k people into one server day 1.
---
The group I was running with was going to try and 20 man all the 40 man raids. Then we got 38 people who wanted to raid haha. Could still be though, were just going to run empty slots instead of filling with randoms. 
---
Should be interesting.
---
Thanks for the link. That's a lot of money.
---
No, it's not...that was last week and it never even popped up for me, this is new as of today and it is likely for the EU stress test that they mentioned.
---
The most fun I find in MMOs are the ones where there isn't balance and each class is specifically stronger against specific ones and weaker to others.  This tends to make it the most interesting and this how Dakr Age of Camelot and even up and coming Camelot Unchained is designed as well.  Makes things intriguing cause you gotta actually think about what to do as opposed to just spamming the same ole rotation.
---
I agree with you but at the same time I sympathize with the people who are mad for having gotten replaced with the new target audience.
---
Wow used to be my game, I was part of the community that made it big and now it's catering to an entirely different kind of player who will abuse and shoo me away when I complain about how the game has been taken away from me.
---
I'm not bashing people for liking modern classic, but I'd like to have my game back. Yea classic is coming, but for now there are no plans to ever add content so some 4 years down the line or so I'll be back to nothing when I have sucked the classic content dry. Replacing your target audience is just an awful thing to do. Betraying the fans who made you big in the hopes to cash in with a bigger, dumber or wealther audience is just fucking crap and it feels good to at least get to vent about it from time to time.
---
Since I know what it's like to get shit on for liking a game (by retail players for loving classic) I'm trying hard not to shit on them for liking retail. But I can hate on retail. It's also valuable to understand what is shit about retail, to understand why classic was great and avoid making the same mistakes again if we ever get a new MMO in the style of classic (or fresh classic style content - one may dream).
---
All that said, low effort meme posts á la "retail is shit and classic is great" are just annoying.
---
quest in brill. forsaken woman in an inn asks you to gather some bear pelts because she can't shake the cold she feels. a fetch quest, but one that contextualizes what it means to be forsaken.

Neither of these years were popular wow years. In fact they rank among the least popular. 
---
Another garbage comic mass posted by the same guy. Take your own advice. Less of your comics is more.
---
But according to the data classic is actually easy. It was private servers that made it harder

A lot are actually horde if you skip asmon and staysafe.
---
I’ve spent time leveling one up to the 40s not too long ago.
---
1 - 8 is pretty okay just like everyone else, 3 mobs or more can be a problem. You get Conjure Food / Water early on, so consumables are no problem and you gain many friends through sharing these and your Arcane Intellect. With frostbolt you slow them enough to generally be fine though. 
---
At 8 you get Polymorph. This is a great help (I remember it allowing me to solo Princess in Elwynn Forest) until you get something else that makes a mage’s life easy: 
---
Frost Nova. This spell, together with your other slows and freezes, are what makes a frost mage decent at leveling. You optimalt start a fight at max range, throw 2 frostbolts, and then frostnova + strafe away when they get close.
---
Later on you get Blink and can spec into frostbite, which gives you a 5 % chance per talent point (in total 15%) to freeze a target struck by your chill effects. This, along with the crit chance against frozen targets / crit damage combo you get in other talents, allows you to get some sick damage along with the stellar CC. 
---
At 40 you can also spec into Ice Barrier, making you effectively unbeatable against generic mobs in your level range. Elites are usually easily kiteable / CC-able. 
---
Building heavily into spell damage (mostly frost spell damage early on) is advised. You are not completely against intellect, but as a mage heavily invester into sp I 3 -4 hit mobs at my level. I am well geared, but nowhere near a twink.
---
All in all: mages have a steady progression through their talent trees, where leveling only gets easier. Your squishyness is balanced through blink mobility and CC, and you have several gear «checkpoints» (i.e. Azure Silk set in the 20s and Dreamweave at 40/45, both craftable by all tailors with some Azure pieces being recipes sold) that will last you for many levels. With that said, you are not very gear dependant like, let’s say, a warrior.
---
You are not as quick a leveler as a hunter or a warlock, but you are definitely quick, and have a smooth and (in my opinion enjoyable) leveling process where you can enjoy very good damage and nearly guarranteed spots in group content because of your conjured goods and awesome CC. 
---
There are tons of guides who explains the vanilla mage better than me, as I am in no way an expert mage. A quick Google will help you with finding those. I hope this makes you want to level a mage more!
---
If I made any grammar errors or misspelling, I blame it on me being on a phone and being Norwegian.
---
I lost it when i saw mining animation :D
---
No they aren't. Only shifting *in*  to form causes a gcd.

Paladin weapon quest that takes you to BFD.
---
My g5 still works like a charm
---
Why don't you just look at those comments that are getting reported? Everything else shouldn't be too disruptive. In the end we have to respect the opinions and free speech of other people.
---
Eh, not really easier.
---
when you're solo leveling and killing mobs and the mob is 1 hit away from dying, while you're around 50% hp. then madness ensues as attack after attack, it's a dodge, parry, miss, etc. this is amplified if you're using a slow 2h. then you just end up dying. infuriating.
---
These guys are gangsters that will clear Naxxramas for sure. LETS GO BOIS
---
If you're playing as a tank, you're also highly criticized; a tank that doesn't know what he's doing is really easy to spot. At the same time, a tank that knows their stuff is sought out. This not only applies to own abilities, talents, skills, etc., but also knowledge of dungeons, boss mechanics, etc.
---
I resonate with this so much. And the one time I started with a super good class (in wildstar) it got nerfed into the fucking ground like 2 weeks after the game launched before i ever even hit level cap. Rip.
---
&gt;Meme specs
---
\^\^ This... My biggest concern is finding a decent server. Finding a guild is never much of an issue, if the shoe doesn't fit move on.
---
Haha I wish mine did. That thing lasted me for like 10 years. Then bought a g303 and the cable started failing within a year or so. Decided to give Logitech one last chance and I’m loving the g600 so far though it was a little frustrating to get set up properly on Mac.
---
Yeah, vanilla is def not a sandbox. 
---
Play an actual sandbox mmo and you will realise how themeparky wow is.
---
bag space is hard for like half the classes. Hunters flat out loose a bag., druids,  enh shamans and ret have a second gear set just like the warrior. So ~50% are just as screwed. Add in warlocks for raids. Warriors only get far worse when they tank and gather resi gear as well.
---
Your first of 3 lol

Good job on the music choice, it really fits the theme of going through close to two decades of a fantasy RPG.
---
You're welcome. As for gearing, I don't know any specifics. Get engineering for the amazing utility, and get sufficient stamina to survive encounters.
---
As for talents, I think sub/assass is amazing for having cold blood and prep at the same time. On top of the improved stealth talents you'll be able to have an outstanding burst. But i believe, correct me if i'm wrong, that combat would be best for solo leveling and while also pretty useful for pvp encounters.
---
As for warlock, I don't know much sadly. For leveling i think dotting/wanding is the way to go. And that both destruction and affliction are pretty even performance wise.
---
good bot

For me, it was Tot the Gnome rogue on Spinebreaker. His favorite spot was outside LHC

Bro, you barely had any idea what the hell quests even were, thottbot got me through, I hated reading quests, lol.
---
Then TomTom came along
---
you can solofarm dme lashers with ele/resto
---
What i was eluding too is the mindset of pvpers generally prefer the class fantasy of horde. 
---
Ion said it was historically pvpers chose horde. 
---
Im not saying whats better etc. Im just saying this is what happens according to both games director.
---
True, it's not as bad as hunters or locks. but I think that while leveling, druids don't need a second set to tank leveling dungeons. I am not sure if shamans even can tank leveling dungeons so I won't comment on them. Ret does kinda need a shield to not get grief when they tank but they can heal anyways. Mage/priest are just better. Rogues are better, I would say.
---
So.... they are the third worst class in the game for bag space while leveling, and then at max level, they are flat out bad if they want to tank at all?
---
But I feel like losing a part of who I am... I have over 80GB of paladin pvp movies I still watch to this day.
---
He was talking about warmode and then talked about the historic difference that people who pvp tend to pick horde. 
---
Sorry if i confused you.
---
Because they should speak English for an English game
---
You are technically correct, even though the morons downvoted.
---
The running in place tests are 'worst case' tests.  They are Leeyway with no movement interpolation.

That being said, I believe the beta taurens have slightly too long of reach, as can be evidenced by ~11 yard leeway range.

Smeld wasn't useable as to vanish dcoils etc in vanilla, right? That came later down the line? I'm just assuming so, but I didn't play alliance back in vanilla days, so I don't know :\ Just seem to recall seeing footage of that being a thing though at some point.

---
Should yes, but years of people playing on nationality servers on game clients with language packs hasn't exactly prepared those people for it..
---
Sure honey, we'll have sex in a minute. Just one more level...
---
Why would you have 30k+ population realms? The goal is to have around normal realm pop by the end of phase 1 (at the latest) so around 3k. So the initial realm pop depends entirely on how many people leave over the course of phase 1 but it's not going to be 90%. Maybe 50-75% which would amount to an initial realm pop of 6-12k.
---
Best npc names in the game.

Thanks!

There was a macro floating around in here that allowed one button to charge if you were out of combat and it swapped you to zerker stance if you were in combat.

It seems really good. But it might be better for me to just learn to change stances and use that one key on binds. The mouse wheel for stances perhaps?

I think since most people here are from the USA, they don’t care too much. But when it was first announced, this sub had a lot of post about it
---
Thats a fantastic idea, and one Ive done in the Beta.

---
He's probably remembering the WC3 release date.
---
Do you...do you have to lean really far in like Michael Jackson to reach the keyboard?
---
Evidently. Didn't you see how short the rogue GCD is and hes only using daggers?!
---
Does this mean Classic design is flawed?
---
“Suck”
---
Nothing against you or anything, but why coerce your "friend" in the first place for your benefit? Wouldn't it be better for them to play a class they want to play and therefore they can have more fun?  
---
I understand synergy is good, but not the end all be all...
---
Sandbox? You can hardly interact with the world or change it at all.
---
that is not true of all servers, for example servers that streamers play on are always going to get bigger, and other small servers will just naturally die... layering doesn't prevent this.
---
Until you get a nice big phat Windfury crit.
---
Then it's incredibly fun.
---
True I'm rolling holy 😎
---
Sorry in advance about my question but how can I fight when the big cooldowns skills are not ready?
---
Why should people who've played the game for 10 years in German be forced to speak English due to "more freedom". It makes absolutely no sense.
---
Ivwas referring to the heal gear.
---
And you demote your "PalaDing" to regular "Ding" when leveling up.
---
there is a special place in hell for heretics like you
---
Played that again during the stress test! I mained a Nelf Warrior during vanilla days so I wanted to relive that part during the test. Plan on doing a undead horde for release but I’m happy I got to run through that quest again. Insane nostalgia.
---
Thinking back at this and from my own experience, this isn't too hard to imagine, honestly. The things to do when there is no raids going on as a 60 wasn't THAT much unless you were a rank grinder. So I often bumped into lowbies and helped them out with this and that whilst running around herbing shit as a priest. I never expected anything in return, especially not if people were kind enough to ask for help instead of just assuming I'd help or rage when I didn't help them when they were dying and I never saw them :P I mean, yeah, times were different then. BUT, I just think it was cus a lot of people were new to the whole MMO concept, and just hadn't been "taught" to be toxic like nowadays.
---
Just look at ANY top 10-20 game on twitch, and at least 1 of the 10 people at the top of the viewers is going to be known for his "toxicness" etcetc, and is the sole reason they have viiews in the first place. Considering streaming wasn't a big thing back in 2004-2005, it's not weird to think that people hadn't gotten influenced in this manner yet. Even though, of course, there were some asshats back then as well, but that's just people being people :)
---
Who is saying there is no hope for wow, lol.
---
Runescape osrs is also free, a click to move, started as a browser game. There have also been many additions to osrs. Jagex fucked up when they tried a classic mmorpg approach, a skill bar and hotkeys.
---
Oh. My. God.
---
I played this as a kid! It was so hard :D
---
Will play once I'm home from work.
---
Ah yes, Americans. If it doesn't involve them it doesn't matter.
---
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out why people aren't continuing to post a lot about it. It's a huge issue.
---
Also forgot to add the Horde druid flight path out of Moonglade that goes directly to Thunder Bluff.
---
You can do the route I described. I do it on every character. It's not worth it to go to lock instead of grinding a few extra mobs. And my list shows you getting 20 from just stonetalon and barrens. It's still a much slower grind to 30 as horde. Nothing you said changes that.
---
Ret DPS is for true DPS. Rogue and warrior is for scrubs who need buttons to do dps for them
---
It blows my mind that you think only streamers can abuse the mechanics of layering.
---
Ive always thought that the biggest benefit to escape artist for gnome is the ability to remove frost Nova and therefore massive Inc shatter damage
---
What do you like for the sort of discretionary points in your spec? It looks like full swiftshifting over feline swiftness. What about imp regrowth vs imp rejuv vs enrage? I use rejuv more, but when you need regrowth you usually really need it.
---
Just curious.
---
I just realised, only shamans got Bloodlust in vanila... so alliance does not have mass heroism in classic? This is like... fatal for the alliance in big fights.

&gt;- Having to deal with knowing that you caused a wipe because all healers panicked and spamhealed you after you went overboard with the lifetaps and the tank then went down. (it's a joke but I definitely saw it happening a lot.) :&lt;
---
Any decent healer knows you just never heal a warlock. 
---
Healing a warlock basically changes his lifetap from consuming his health to the tanks.
---
click spells with one hand, play with ding-dong with the other hand = ret pala dps rotation xD
---
The irony here is thick.
---
When I was still playing BfA, if I turned war mode on, I have an extremely low cost, instant cast heal with no cooldown (part of the pvp talents) that made me functionally invincible outside of CC chaining, or being one shot, neither of which are possible for any amount of mobs to do. I'd just torpedo around and gather every mob that I could see and whittle down a few dozen mobs without any fear of death. I had to keep healing and use an AoE stun if they hit me harder than expected, but those cooldowns were so short it wasn't an issue at all. Even if it was, I had a plethora of cooldowns I could pop that would make me unkillable, all on like 2 minute cooldowns. The silly thing is every class can play this way if they want to. It is so easy to respec if you happen to be playing a more single target focused spec, and every class has a more AoE oriented spec and a shit load of survivability.
---
People are pretty pissed, but this is an American made platform discussing an American made game.
---
If you look for the germans they'll be mad with you.
---
Hybrid PvP classs will be powerful, and there will intheory be way more warriors than healbots.

I suspect a lot of PvP warriors who were sold the ultimate experience will be in for a shock.

I stand corrected

good luck getting a CS off in the .5 second window that escape artist gives

maybe people have much quicker reaction times than I realize

Hey man, don’t have to get upset, just trying to keep it real with you. 
---
First this subreddit went after streamers furiously, now they after layering. They might step into the flood gates of complaining about those servers when they get tired of complaining about layering.
---
Layering is going away after a few weeks. It's a non-issue.
---
Sounds like you need a better expert. Go the route I said and maybe have some patience because that's what it will take to level in vanilla. No reason to run cross continents for leveling to 30 as an alliance. You got too many options  where you start.
---
Because it doesn’t effect majority of us. 
---
Honestly, would you care about an issue that had zero effect on you? 
---
This isn’t an “american” thing. This is an English speaking thing. Which majority of us on reddit do.
---
Fuck this guy
---
Absolutely
---
ClassicCast and Allcraft are the ones I've been listening to every now and then. Allcraft has a mix of classic and BFA, though, just fyi.
---
&gt; 1) Are we not harsh enough on shitty memes? If we change our moderating of memes, it will be to be harsher on them - especially label memes. We have no plans to allow even more low-effort memes through.
---
I mean, look at the front page of this sub and I think that says it all.
---
Well as I've said, never played Troll. Only read complaints from Trolls about how bad their racial spells were supposedly.
---
Should try EQ
---
I think at least the straving one was fixed in the new client (not the beta but the stresstest client)
---
You’re not forced. 
---
You don’t have to play. You don’t have to speak English. Asians do just fine playing on US illidan. People understand that even though it’s an American server, that majority of people on that server will not speak English.
---
And has utility (charge stun, howl, invisibility), and gives sweet spell pushback against casters, and can run down kills. Playing without a pet is asinine.
---
That’d be littty
---
I don't know what you're talking about, for THE LIGHT is my greatest ally! ;)
---
Can anyone confirm whether this option exists in the wow classic beta?  This was a good change and if it is not implemented in the client I hope someone can make an addon.
---
This was perfect! Thank you :) You've certainly answered literally every question I had. Thanks Friend!
---
I mean, it was released in the US first, so let's keep it that way, if they want the classic experience just wait a year or so.
---
Wing clip and kill..

---
fcking small country and yet it still managed to completely take over Drak'Thul... I cannot imagine how much bigger communities would "ruin"  the server... but I guess blizz will happily sell me a realm transfer when I accidentaly roll on german server, right?...
---
really good stuff here. hope blizz sees it
---
Wow, this is the worst comment section i've ever seen. The entitlement and ignorance displayed here makes me cringe. Everybody is talking out of their ass.
---
except layering IS making the game easier, by adding a new feature that lets you vanish from world pvp, kill mobs then hop layers for more mobs, multiple layers of resources, people layer hopping for agm and tidal, etc. 
---
you want the integrity of the game compromised for your own convenience.
---
Literally me. I played druid/paladin in classic and was forced to heal, but I was always trying to dps as ret or balance for the lulz.
---
I love the paladin lore and the aesthetic feel of the class, but I might just play Druid this time and embrace healing in PvE and speccing hybrid in PvP.
---
you are supposed to SWING the light, my friend. arthas and uther were the greatest paladins ever not because they were priests in plate armor!
---
put your faith in the light
---
We left when it was starting to become the go-to Brazilian server, did that change or just become eve more apparent? Blizz was offering free transfers to offload the original servers and we all jumped at the chance lol
---
While there are game breaking bugs, layering and leeway issues, this Busta wants to be able to have some knee wobble while he does 360s
---
Put your faith in the light, and it will guide you.
---
I'm sticking with paladin.
---
&gt;With layering being server-wide, an overflow of people in lower-level zones would cause the ten players in your higher-level zone to be split into different layers
---
wat.jpg
---
True, I always forget about the unread cause they are not part of my horde (from wc3)
---
It's a horribly long quest. I did it on my paladin. Costs a lot and the gear is meh compared to easy to get raid gear.
---
Honestly the fact skeletons disappear much faster is really sad / an important bug.
---
Knowing when battles took place / if you're about to be ganked because of the corpses of the fallen is a pretty big deal imo
---
Lightning shield is the most important :)
---
Come on Reddit, I thought you were slightly more intelligent than this.
---
Feel for you, I'm watching Kamil's ret pvp video and thinking... man I know how mad I was how ret was getting short end of the stick in terms of dps/gear distribution in raids and I cannot imagine I'd want to do that same shit again... but I have played paladin for over 14 years, I mean I played ret for HALF OF MY LIFE...!  + I want to do balls deep and go for rank14... that aint happening on paladin!

&gt; I played a Warrior in ACTUAL Vanilla WoW, I'm also a 2x Gladiator from Seasons 2 and 3 as a Warrior.

Cool I played Warrior and Rogue in ACTUAL Vanilla WoW too. I cleared everything including NAXX. I was R12 in ACTUAL Vanilla WoW. I'm 1x Gladiator. I've had 99%/100% parses in every fucking raid since Classic.
---
&gt;Here is a Disc priest beating two geared warriors at the same time, had he correctly shielded at the start he likely wouldnt have even damaged the entire fight.
---
Geared Warriors? That Orc Warrior isn't really geared at fucking all but okay kid. TIL having Arcanite Reaper with fiery enchant at the start of BC is considered "GEARED".

Also this video is in fucking **2.0.1** WHICH ISN'T CLASSIC WOW AT ALL!

This Priest is in Naxx/AQ/GM gear going against a shitty warrior and you call him geared. What a joke.
---
&gt;You playing against some helmet headed kids on a private server which is just full of the absolute shittiest players you could find is not a good barometer.
---
This doesn't make any logical sense. How are players that have been playing Vanilla for years going to be shitter than kids I will find on Retail Classic WoW that haven't played the game in 14 years like yourself? Entire new metas have been appearing on private servers but go ahead and keep thinking private server players are trash.
---
&gt;Look at a post like this https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8wg2xr/discussion_duel_class_ranking_in_terms_of/e1vli86/.

Wow you linked a post with 3 upvotes! and 4 responses! Must be 100% fact right there.
---
&gt;(despite Warlocks likely being the easiest class for you to 1v1).
---
This right here proves how ignorant you are. Warlocks win almost every single 1v1 duel tournament.
---
ENJOY getting ass blasted by Warriors in BGs. 1v1 isn't the entire game... You rarely 1v1 people.
---
And yet people refuse, that's why we need localized servers.

Dont forget lightning shield :)

My mother inlaw lives in my house and doesnt pay rent and uses my car. I relate

Countdown to classic is pretty good. There are some historic ones were they go over each class with an old developer. I really enjoyed listening to the ones for the classes I am going to play.

TBC made ele and ench viable and it was amazing.

Great finds. Hope blizz fixes them. Especially the strafe, gore, and corpses. Really hurts the immersion.
---
No I wouldn't say it is flawed, it is just a different feel than modern MMOs. The instant gratification is gone. So some people who only have played retail may not enjoy the slower pace and the time commitment required to enjoy it.
---
It definitely has downsides, I'm not disputing that at all. It has a huge benefit though in that it allows me to play the fucking game. It sucks that there are people miserable enough to abuse game mechanics like that to get an edge, but i'm not one. Like everyone else, I hope layering is gone completely relatively quickly after release, but I'll still take it over the alternative of not being able to play the game at all for the first month.

Paladins are just Priests trained to not die so easily in battle. You were never mighty warriors, just medics in plate armor.

Tldr

Yes it does. I just leveled a character through goldshire the other day and murlocs still hurt a lot of classes, unless your decked out in heirlooms

No, however if there was an issue that didn't involve me I'd refrain from commenting or getting involved in the discussion like a reasonable human being.

can you get punishment for killing roleplayer more than once? what if im a nightelf druid thats eager to fight the orc forces on all continents for the destruction of nature they're doing? what if i kill undeads because their existence is against the laws of nature? what if i kill trolls because of their close relationship to the orcs? what if i kill all taurens for them hunting down malorne and aiding in killing cenarius?
---
i think those are pretty good rp-consistent reasons to be open-pvp'ing everywhere
---
This is an ancient picture lol, its been memed in every warrior discord forever
---
The only issue with leveling and then looking for a raiding guild is you might end up on a server where that doesn't work. 
---
If you KNOW you want to raid, go ahead and find a guild now. Just make sure it is one that has a vision, plan, and structure. Another commenter stated most of these guilds are going to crash and burn, and I tend to agree. 
---
I spent a long time looking at tons of guilds, joining their Discords, reading their policies (if they existed), and only one of them had anything that I think will have longevity. And the nights don't work for me, so I went ahead and started my own guild and am recruiting players. I spent a good month prepping all policies and programs before opening recruitment a few days ago. 
---
TL; DR: It depends on what you want to do, but I recommend waiting until 60 to decide.
---
Nickers Unite
---
Because we are equating the issue layering is solving with the time frame for it?
---
It seems the intent is for layering to last for as long as incredible population bottlenecks would ruin player experience. I honestly feel that people layer hopping would impact my fun far less than either:
---
a) fighting with 1500 other people in my STV zone or b) having a ton of low population realms 2 months in.
---
Maybe layering does only need to last for the first couple zones, or maybe the bottlenecks will last well into 40. It seems Blizzard has starting doing some focused testing on it in the last stress test so hopefully theyll find an answer.
---
Yea and replying back with your “Americans don’t care” also doesn’t help stop the fire. 
---
But you still don’t follow. This is reddit. English speaking. Majority Americans. And you’re trying to get them to care about something that doesn’t effect them.
---
Oh well too bad for them
---
&gt; I haven't done a 24 hour session in probably a decade, so I'm not sure I can do it, but it surely can't hurt to try if it means getting ahead of the zergfest, right?

That's the spirit - only certain way to fail is to not even try!
---
&gt; Best of luck in your attempt for your 30 hour session. :D
---
Thanks, you too :)
---
I couldn't tell you, I quit very shortly after naxx came out. Didn't come back till a little after bc released but on a different server. But I remember there being a large foreign population, serveral Chinese guilds, one of which I was in, lol
---
What surprises me is the way people always think of feral DPS when someone mentions feral druid, even though feral tank is by far the most competitive of the two specs.
---
This is the only correct answer.
---
It's completely doable, just don't expect to be main tanking in guilds.
---
Because it's an English game. Why should blizzard make a niche server for Germany
---
Rogue it doesn't matter. Vanish early and you never worry about catching up in threat. I'd take a shaman over paladin. 
---
However, warriors are seemingly threat limited DPS. So salvation can help out a lot.

Why aren't they making servers for other languages if its multi language? Because its English .

Reddit has polls? Why’s everyone always strawpolling then?

Levelling and you can't buff people walking past.

You mean wasted space on a 2 hander. Dw for life.

---
Fury Warrior and Enhancement Shaman/Feral Druid.
---
This is lore friendly as fuck. Horde - strong, somewhat barbaric but noble warriors banded together. Alliance - diciplined and coordinated military force. Horde is stronger in 1 on 1 fights, when Alliance is stronger in mass fights.
---
Feel like this guy had only an inkling of an idea of what he was talking about, because he heard one discussion about smoother rage gen v burstier rage gen (faster v slower weapon) in a guild chat once. Unknown if who he was listening to also had any idea what they were talking about. I never really paid much attention to it, just took whatever had the highest DPS, and best stats.
---
Any form of humour enthuasiasm seems to be lacking here. I'll have to abandon the thread. Pfsheeeew!
---
This one pisses me off. I have reported it, bunch of other people have reported it, yet it’s not even acknowledged by blizzard to be a bug.
---
How?
---
Locks scale very well. It comes down to extreme min maxing. Mathematically gearing a warrior will have a larger raid dps net gain. 
---
I don't advocate for that though.  5 is a good number, 4 if you have a feral. Loot rotting isn't an issue since 2.5 and t3 are shared and rogues get the dick as you gear warriors for 4h first. The only end game loot specific to rogues is daggers but I've heard fury daggers is a private server thing now to.
---
[Why don't you ask Blizzard?](https://i.imgur.com/MmW3svR.png)
---
Implying that you can't have both. Which is wrong...
---
It's just reporting the differences. I see this kind of comment on every single bug report thread and it's such a useless thing to say.
---
Locks on alliance are sought after
---
Bro you are delusional.
---
Don't comment then.
---
Mages are more common but higher DPS.    
---
Warlocks are rare but with lower DPS.   
---
Play what you'd enjoy. If you want to push the Frostbolt key for two hours with the occasional conjure water and a portal at the end, a Mage is perfect. Although Warlocks are little better at high level, Healthstone, Healthstone, Shadowbolt, Shadowbolt, Soul Stone, Healthstone, Healthstone, Shadowbolt, Shadowbolt, etc.
---
Rogue - Bosses that annihilate melee.
---
There's also a lot of them, but the goods news is 80% of them aren't any good.
---
Do you know if they're doing classic?
---
As an ally lock you should have a great time finding a raid spot. Less competition. Locks are more popular on horde side. People don't want to face WotF as a lock.
---
How can you be confortable on that table?
---
So youd rather dead servers over sharing it with the rest of Europe? Typical Brit.
---
Locks have good damage so I’m confused by the statement. They have more utility than most classes. Soul stone can save a raid. Lock closet is demanded. Pets make leveling easy. If your only reason for playing mage is damage I would re-evaluate. Don’t forget that you can horror, fear, and banish CC Incase your pvp kit wasn’t overdosed enough with engineering perks.
---
I forgot here you actually have to type out /s
---
My bad, I want to do 360s as well
---
Mage is probably going to be  the second most played class
---
It's a 30 yard range. You're not a very good shaman if you aren't anticipating totem drops.
---
What's the issue then
---
Fuck that shit.  Shoot lightning bolts
---
Aye. Now we bide our time brother, but we shall rise again.
---
Various languages are going to group together and create unofficial language servers. After you reach 60, there's a strong possibility that you're going to be surrounded by people who don't want to speak English, have no intention of speaking English, or can't speak English and you're STUCK due to the lack of realm transfers.
---
The whole situation could be avoided if they just made separate language realms [LIKE THEY DO IN RETAIL](https://i.imgur.com/MmW3svR.png).
---
that's why you are nobody compared to him, nobody, you are nobody compared to him man, nobody, you are man nobody to him compared... /s
---
Yes absolutely.
---
Slow leveller? Not really. A few of the notable warriors have levelled then quite fast aka Monkey news and Tribe.
---
Youd rather dead servers than learning another language that is around you everyday.
---
Typical entitled Brits
---
Checked how the talent works, and it apparently does just what it says - only applies to the cleave bonus damage. So no imp cleave then!
---
It's not like they don't have oodles of actual server data to know how populations rise at the release of content and how quick they fall off.
---
I just hope it's as short as possible so we can all get back to enjoying the game instead of circle jerking against layering.

&gt;I honestly feel that people layer hopping would impact my fun far less than either: a) fighting with 1500 other people in my STV zone or
---
I think you need to read up on what issue layering is trying to solve. Blizzard themselves explained it pretty clearly at Blizzcon so I'd start there. I'll give you a hint though: It _isn't_ because they expect there to be more high levels than would normally be on a single realm. If that was the case, they wouldn't be able to remove layering.
---
&gt;b) having a ton of low population realms 2 months in.
---
Few people are advocating removing layering entirely, and I am not one of them. Not everything is so black and white and it's a pretty dishonest tactic to pretend like wanting to block off the potential to exploit the system means it has to be removed entirely.
---
That would be the Silithus demon.
---
I don't see how this is any different to layering?

Countdown to Classic podcast by day. Classic WoW by night. All day!
---
No, I will roll with that sweet spelladin, tier 2 is bis so I won't worry much about gear lol
---
I keep searching for a response to this specific one, I'm getting a little bit scared by the lack of communication by Blizz regarding it. Would love to see it fixed.
---
Report them. They will be banned
---
I've never got to woosh someone before...
---
Yes, they are easily the slowest leveling class in Vanilla.
---
&gt;I am just sort of discouraged by beta testers being over it already.
---
Put yourself into the mind of a Beta tester. The cap was level 20 for 3 weeks. Some players hit level 20 in the first day. It does not take long to get level 20. Then they sat around squeezing whatever fun they could out of level 20. They formed raids to kill level 30 quest mobs, they got professions up and spend hours fishing.
---
Then the cap was lifted to level 30. Again some players hit the new cap in one day. Many others hit it in the next few days. Then they are back at the same situation they were just at.  Do a few dungeons that are orange, do a few quests that are higher level than you, or a few rounds of WSG if the queues are popping.
---
Then the cap was lifted to level 40. Yet again some crazy folks hit 40 in the first 24 hours and then a lot hit it in the next week. This is the 3rd time that beta players have been stuck at a particular level for weeks. The novelty of "preparing for the next cap lift" is wearing off. These players just ran SM instances 30 times while leveling to 40 so they don't want to keep doing it now that they are 40. Uldaman is too high for most people and Maraudon is too high for all but the most dedicated. There is less to do stuck at level 40 than there was at level 30.
---
We're at the mid-way point for beta and people are remembering that their **characters are going to be deleted in 45 days.** You can't really hold it against people for waning interest when they are stuck at a level where there is nothing to do, and their progress will be wiped soon anyway.
---
I speak English so I don’t care.

Any idea of how to get an EU sub from the US?

It belongs in a museum.

It’s just a video game. Calm down.
---
No too bad for me and everyone else.
---
Because they are not forced to speak english, they won't speak english, so now I have to play on a server where people speak german french and spanish instead of communicating with people in english.
---
Luckily for me, I have a like minded minmax friend and so we'd be happy to go any duo class combo provided the below.
---
A: It's a top tier combo
---
B: We actually want to play the classes at 60  
---
We've settled on Mage/Mage for the insane AOE farming potential. 
---
We've done a lot of testing and found that most of the drawbacks with mage AOE leveling are null and void when you are doing it as a duo.
---
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Lmao no bro you are when I literally just linked a source by blizzard confirming what I just said as true.
---
Very cool
---
And to be honest playing a warrior is very rewarding. (Warrior main since vanilla)
---
No, I never said that.... The streaming servers are fucked, because they'll be overpopulated, and there will be queues after phase 1.
---
They're not going to enforce English only in public channels. It's just not going to happen.
---
It happened all the time in 2004 though...
---
Really? 
---
We’ve known the release date for over a month now at this point.
---
Mine is the level 30 mage class quest, specifically the bit in shimmering flats. If anyone hasn't done it before I recommend not just looking up what you are supposed to do!
---
That's on retail.
---
Remember, exploit early and exploit often.
---
Hi confused by the statement. they have more utility than most classes. soul stone can save a raid. lock closet is demanded. pets make leveling easy. if your only reason for playing mage is damage i would re-evaluate. don’t forget that you can horror, fear, and banish cc incase your pvp kit wasn’t overdosed enough with engineering perks., I'm dad.
---
Alliance is always in need of locks specially for raids, horde on the other hand isn't.
---
Probably going to wait for the server list, choose my server and then try to join a guild pre launch
---
Comes out on Monday for us

To me it seems like the OP is mixing up the two concepts. Simple bugs with major effects on gameplay would hopefully not create that much crunch time. The layering seems like it might be more difficult, in part because my understanding is that a lot of the issues with it is in the concept of it. But that's not really a bug imo, more like an unwanted feature.
---
What people think will happen:
---
Warsong 1 - 5 will cleanly collapse into a later unified Warsong.
---
What will actually happen.
---
Warsong 1 - Full
---
Warsong 2-5 - Low pop
---
Warsong 2-5 merge
---
Result:
---
Warsong 2 - Medium.
---
How will this help the full server? People don't just see "full" on a population or a queue and go away automatically, at least not in big enough numbers. We know this from the years of watching the populations of servers over 15 years. They'll all congregate on a few servers, following the ones with the biggest populations. It won't even be about streamers. They'll have their groupies sure, but we had this problem before streamers.
---
RIP moonwalking :(
---
That set up is so juicy....im jelly
---
Where's your source on this.  He said he never worked for them.  They reached out but it didn't work out.
---
That's not classic
---
I really don't think that's needed. I think that's just in healer's heads. It becomes relevant later on, but early, mana potions cover most gear shortcomings, and even on private servers, I am perfectly fine with a healer that is 5 levels under the last boss of the instance (where my rule is 3 for tank or dps, myself included). 
---
Beyond that, It's just not super noticeable, like a lack of a shield is. Everyone sees when the tank is not using a shield, and a lot of people for some reason feel the need to say something.
---
I believe many have already played on private servers, which are a mix of the entire world, and this is not an issue. There are Russian, German, French, Mandarin etc guilds, but public chats are always in English. This is at least why I’m not concerned, being from EU.
---
They are you dipshit lmao.
---
I found lightning shield to be a big drain on mana if you tried to keep it up all the time. I'd use it but only about once every minute or so.
---
Yup!
---
Exactly. Not classic
---
I don't even know why I bother replying to someone with Jordan B Peterson in their name.
---
Rocking with the boys, Warrior, Warrior, Shaman and Hunter. We were going to rock one of the warriors arms. But both of us like playing dw so we will be using the quest weapons and such as we level with subsidized weapons from dungeons. I will be rocking all of the tanking plate i can get while my buddy will be rocking all of the dps items he can get. The shaman will obviously have very little competition from the hunter on gear in dungeons and such.
---
Nope

Create a new Starter Edition account in the Europe region, then add time to it.

Kill 10 mottled boars.
---
Collect 10 cactus apples is a close second.
---
You dont know that
---
The way I see it is alliance warriors will be able to do more damage early on when tanks are still wearing mainly mitigation gear. But as horde tanks and healers become more and more geared their tanks will start being able to wear threat gear and that's when WF will obviously be way better for people wanting to do the most dmg possible as a warrior. 
---
If you plan to play literally anything other than fury warrior or rogue alliance is the preferred choice.
---
Yeah, no that's fair.
---
Maybe because you are bad.
---
So report them
---
Aww want a cookie before you head to bed?
---
Prot pally here, True champion of the light and protector of the innocent.
---
Yep, you're a true bigot
---
&gt; But who will tame Humar the Pridelord at 23 if nobody is playing a Hunter??
---
Humar will say fuck it and go tame a Hunter. Only on Russian servers, though.
---
Also when you woosh you should probably keep your mouth shut...
---
That airplane flew over your head an hour ago.
---
&gt; You as the player have to catch the target in stealth first, then can send a pet
---
Err. If you're in Aggressive with the pet and you go AFK, the pet will attack any Rogue near you.
---
Makes sense.
---
Undead is literally handful of scourge who managed to escape their brains intact.
---
Trolls are so weak because of inner struggles, Zalazane single handedly took over their islands.
---
Tauren had heavy losses under centaur attacks and they are slow to reproduce.
---
Orcs are refugees from another planet and they were devestated by both Alliance and internal struggle. 
---
Horde is really slow compared to Alliance and only reason they are not properly extinct is wow needs a faction.
---
They've began merging every other thread on the subject into one "mega thread" - it's pathetic.
---
Same here man, there's no better choice of class/spec than the one where your BiS for the whole game is the single best looking raid set. Stack spell damage until your Seal of Righteousness does more damage than your actual weapon and never look back.
---
For reference: https://www.wowhead.com/quest=1654/the-test-of-righteousness
---
Learning 20+ languages is not realistic.
---
Well, I have had the impression all along they’re really trying to minimize costs. I haven’t a clue what it would cost them to develop two renders my guess is more than they want. 
---
From a logistics standpoint I can see a strong argument for keeping it classic simply to avoid discussions about where to draw the line for every feature.
---
I really love those side-by-side desks. I know this is a meme, but anyone know where to get those?
---
Very rough pentagram.. I don't think it looks remotely close.
---
Oh the irony.
---
I was watching the play through. If you log in even a few seconds late due to any number of reasons and do not get dropped into a fresh layer, you will have a very rough time finding a plainstrider or a cougar.
---
Maybe if you start at 4 am you may also have a better success rate.
---
But each time I got in 1-6 took me like at least 80 minutes of grouping and fighting for tags on mobs. As a shaman you also cannot as easily just leave at level 4 or 5 and make it up grinding outside the noob garden because of the class quest.
---
Nope, you are just bad
---
 I will roll a human warrior on a PvP server. I expect to get used as target practice by every horde seeing me as I level. A walking joke of a character pretty much. Same thing at 60. Takes a lot of gearing up before you become something other than a free kill when soloing. 
---
 Hopefully I get to know some cool people and don't have to solo so much. In a party it's a different thing.
---
Mark of the Beast!
---
Because we live in a mixed language society. Don't be a bigot.
---
Has blizzard specifically stated that only english is allowed?
---
When WoW first came out, I made a troll hunter and found this spot. I jumped down and swam over to the waterfall and found a weapon crate that had a grey item in it that I sold for 17 silver. At level 2, that was such an insane amount of money! I could afford everything I ever wanted! It was an awesome introduction to the game.

Intro: 
---
Awake is a newly formed guild that aims to provide a space for those who can not live the life of a 9-5 guild because of their everyday lives but still want to play dungeons, PvP and especially raids.
---
Goals: 
---
- Building a nocturnal community (including socials!)
---
- Setting up a Raid in the first 1 to 2 months
---
- To lead the best PvP Premade Group
---
- Despite limited time (planned are 2 raiding days for 40s) to be a top guild of the server
---
- But most important: to have fun together!
---
 From our socials: Be nice :)
---
 From our raiders:
---
- You know your class and all the mechanics of the current Raid
---
- You prepare yourself with consumables
---
- You enchant your gear
---
- You are able to take criticism
---
- You aim to have a high raid participation
---
We offer: 
---
- An experienced guild leader that is active in WoW since 2005 in both casual and hardcore settings
---
- Experienced PvP Leaders
---
- Open officer positions for those that are active, experienced and want to help others
---
Raid Info: 
---
- Raid Days will be Sunday/Monday and Wednesday/Thursday for 40 raids, starting around 23:30 till 3:00. 20 raids spontaneously on offdays
---
- Loot assignment will start with a moderated DKP/EPGP and might change to Loot Council in later tiers.
---
- At the moment we are looking mostly for Resto Shamans and Heal Priest. Contact us for different classes recruitment status.
---

Would like to see this in classic.  This was a positive QOL change that wouldn’t feel out of place imo.
---
Agreed. And sometimes if you happen to have a fullish rage bar you would just want to stay in zerker stance and intercept to your target and rage dump on them.
---
Layer switching only on a gryphon and/or inside rested zones would actually be a really elegant solution
---
thats why i play human female
---
You need to put all your dmg out in a bust, and then auto attack untill the mob is dead, this way you will keep your mana regane time at maximum... Ill only use 1 lightning shield pr. Enemy.  1:fire totem 2:earth shock 3: lightning shield 4: melee (i use dagger and shield with flame wep), this way i didnt have to drink at all from lvl 1-60, its not slow at all, since downtime isnt there.
---
Made my own with friends, since we have plenty of experience raiding and in leadership in guilds and we wanted to not have any issues dealing with other people being the main/ off tank because we know how to do the job very well ourselves. We have posted our guild spam in the Classic wow guilds discord. So if you see the guild &lt;Participation Totems&gt; that is us. I hope you find one but the LFG post every week on this reddit is a good place to start. As well as the Classic wow guilds discord.
---
If the melee leeway mechanic isn't changed I think warrior will be much slower in classic to level than on private servers. Reason is hamstring kiting doesn't work with melee leeway. You can't avoid damage in the same way. I REALLY hope they can remove melee leeway since it has no place in the game. Going to feel so horrible having to endure it when you have experienced classic without it on private servers.
---
Yea I sharded once and it got all over the kitchen
---
I'm surprised people are playing Classic as a first time experience.  I mean you've had 15 years to try WoW.  I'd be curious to know why play now
---
The graveyard in ashenvale is near the Alliance town. It's a really long run from the coast, one of the longest in the game I'd guess.
---
This was posted 40 minutes ago
---
I leveled almost every class, here's my points. Warrior is among the grindiest of classes to level. If you don't get a decent two hander the earlier the better... It's kinda a nightmare to level. I'm taking, kill one mob, eat, kill one mob, eat... Oh your on the final portion of a quest chain? Well you need another player because there is about 0% chance you can solo it. It was not my first 60 so I got frustrated and got a white item and enchanted crusader on it along with some white gear statted. At that point I was crushing everything and levels were a breeze.  
---
 My first 60 for contrast, was paladin. I could solo everything, fairly easily kill higher level gankers, and heal 5 man's as ret spec with little difficulty. 
---
 At 60 I literally lost a duel to two and only two warriors. One was within a few weeks of my hitting 60, this was my RL friend and the reason I began playing to begin with (also the reason I rolled paladin) he told me he specialized in killing paladin filth (orc) and I didn't believe him so I rolled alliance on his server to crush him. Turns out, he was really really good at pvp. I went to org and he met me outside where a group of hordies sat and watched. Probably 4-5 min battle resulted in my loss.  Rematched him later and smoked him though. The second was our servers #1 guilds main tank. This time I was in mostly blues and a few epics, he was t2 full. Took about 15 min for him to kill me... He was embarrassed even though he won.  I could beat other warriors without weapons almost as easy as with them. (Not an exaggeration)
---
 End game everything flipped. Your have to be holy to raid essentially, getting items is really hard because there are so goddamned many paladins and in general casters to compete on every non plate item with.  When I got my tank 60 I remember I was already attuned and in blues. Literally went into mc that day and got handed to me 4 epics.  The Server was so low on tanks they would always gear up really really fast then have to drudge through mc/zg/aq20/bwl till everyone else could catch up in gear, boring the shit out of them. Many would just app to a different guild on a different server and bam, your main tank is gone. 
---
 Lots more to it than that... But that's the jist! 
---
PS there are so many people talking about rolling warrior now, this will either not be an issue OR 80% of them will get to level 25 after 3 weeks and reroll.
---
Shaman reminds me of bard from ffxi. Sounds like their dps is bad but their buffs are insanely necessary. People really do tunnel on dps meters in the modern mmos. However, I think classic wow is more of an ffxi style game where each job actually brings their own things to the raid, unlike retail today.
---
9 posts down from your post is the exact same video.
---
&gt;I played a Warrior in ACTUAL Vanilla WoW
---
I played a Warrior and Rogue in ACTUAL Vanilla WoW. I fully cleared Naxx40. I got R12 on Rogue and R10 on my Warrior. I've had 99/100% parses on a majority of fights since worldoflogs was introduced. I'm a 1x Gladiator.
---
&gt;You absolutely are an idiot, this much is certain.
---
Yeah I'm not.
---
&gt;You literally have 2 ways to close distance on a player and one requires you out of combat, you have one of the most reliable (and overall weakest) slows in the game and you have no real way to reset a fight.
---
You have two slows as a Warrior in Classic... Hamstring and Piercing Howl.. Or did you forget since you haven't played in ages?
---
You linked a **2.0.1 video which is Burning Crusade**. That Orc warrior isn't geared at all. I wouldn't consider a Warrior in blue PvP with an Arcanite reaper that has Fiery enchant "Geared" at end of Vanilla. Especially when the priest is in Naxx/AQ/R13 gear.
---
&gt;All in all Warriors are easily the worst 1v1 class in the game, thats their point, they have massively exposed weaknesses that when covered up (healbots) make them into little murder balls.
---
Good thing this game doesn't revolve around 1v1. wPvP rarely is 1v1. BG is never 1v1.
---
&gt;If you go in expecting your choice of Warrior to carry you into godhood as you stomp around on other classes you are woefully misinformed
---
I'm rolling Warrior and I'm not expecting this. I understand how Warriors works.
---
Why am I looking at a post with 3 upvotes? How does this prove anything?
---
&gt;I love that the vast majority of players will be rolling Warriors come time for Classic
---
Vast majority of players aren't rolling Warriors. Warriors are at the same percentage of other classes. Here's multiple polls to back me up.

---
Vast majority would imply that there's a VAST more amount of Warriors which won't be the case.
---
ENJOY GETTING ASS BLASTED BY WARRIORS IN BGS THOUGH! Since this game doesn't revolve around 1v1s at all.
---
Bigot?
---
Its better to save your mana for lightning shield  than lightning bolts.. You can throw auto-attacks with the shield, not with the lightning bolt.. And a mix of both will drain your mana
---
I’m don’t really understand this. It seems like it would be a bigger issue for spriests but they aren’t rare on ally side.
---
Needing Azshara as alliance to connect to Ratchet is so obnoxious.
---
The Ret Paladin should be carried by 39 people in clown wear
---
Not everyone has a plethora of mana potions.
---
and people will definitly notice if the healing feral/ret/enh is oom in a few seconds, because he has absoluty 0 Int on his leveling gear.
---
Holy shit. So I didn't play Alliance whatsoever in vanilla so I never noticed this. They actually have a flight path that is basically in Orgrimmar's back yard. Hilarious! I have no idea why Org wasn't attacked way more often on my server.
---
Our time is soon brother. The fools know bit of our true power
---
No, because it isn't and it won't be.
---
Paladins get the coolest tier armor in vanilla
---
I'm rolling holy paladin. I want that sexy sexy judgement and I want to heal my buddies.
---
Then its gonna be time to kill every orc in the eastern kingdoms
---
I see your handle.  Also, I hope you direct that rage at greedy fat cats not your folks. They probably tired their best, even if they suck.
---
Also Alliance outnumbers horde heavily. Horde needs to either guerilla it or surrender.
---
Doesn't change the Amerocentric attitude much.
---
Proud prot paladin theory crafting and representing the light for all my brothers wielding the shield of light.
---
My bad for not picking up on the sarcasm. Hard to after reading a number of serious comments with the same message.

Prot pally is actually way less shit, you get at most 1 free global on your rotation,and that gets removed if you make a weapon swap macro for judgement.

Most people use cloth, so.. just priests with shields

You're spreading fear, lies, and hate about people who speak other languages. You're saying that you won't be able to play the game unless Blizzard segregates other languages away from you. You're telling people that you literally won't be able to interact with other players if you're not put into some safe space where everyone only speaks your language.
---
That is the definition of a bigot.
---
I cant wait to see what the game was like when mobs were a threat. The only time I ever felt challenged by a mob was when I solo'd some bounty quests meant for a group of at least three people.
---
I would not want to play in those chairs, look how far you would have to bend forward to even reach the mouse and keyboard.
---
WoD pepeLaugh :)
---
untrue. You can dominate as a healer for that grind... and then punk every one as ret "dps" once you get there!
---
Im gonna envy the guys who likes to play resto druids, so easy to gather gear, so much power in pvp.. :P
---
I'll delete it then, sorry
---
Flip the numbers and this is more accurate
---
I mean, Vanilla *was* massively flawed. It's a profoundly broken game on several levels. 
---
But the reasons for that have nothing to do with the reasons people will quit before they hit 30.
---
Oh I thought this was northern Westfield
---
What's the problem with server that have N times more players than classic having N times more black lotus?
---
Absolute worst  
---
Warlock: soul shards farming is cancer, and you and the other locks are the summon bots, yes, you can't argue here.  
---
Feral Druid: You are either a good feral and will be recon in the community as a tank or a tryhard cat dps, or you are straight shit, the latter has the highest chance. You need to love gnomeregan.  
---
Hunter: You will either be a huntard or a nice tranq bot later in the game. Either way there will be a lot of hunters and almost none raid spots (2 or 3). Lastly, if you need everything in dungeons you won't find groups to play with, that's what happens to most of the hunters.
---
the one that has the most streamers.
---
It's bullshit. I followed thr statistics in TBC and that number wasn't even hit in TBC release.
---
A completely new game would be awesome, but people that wanted Vanilla servers and fought for them for 12 years want Vanilla and not some weird mess with ret paladins doing top damage or other nonsense.
---
The true hardcore fanbase of Vanilla wow are the ones who matter for Classic and not retail players who will just check the game out and probably leave after level 20 anyways.
---
Then dont roll for the high/full pop server?
---
I know iq 9000 move right here.
---
Might as well close the sub down.
---
Please dont roll warrior as pure DPS.
---
Roll warrior if you are willing to learn to OT and tank 5 mans because we always need more tanks.       
---
     
---
No to mention people aren't likely to group with you consistently if you are constantly mooching off other people's effort tanking.
---
Why do you think having multiple black lotus spread across multiple layers is going to be a problem?
---
Nooooope.
---
I don't PVP so I am going to play Warlock because they are needed and I 've never really played the class before.
---
If Mages were less popular I'd probably play Mage
---
Good to see a felow retadin :P
---
Awesome kid, I hope you love it as much as us 30\_ year olds. Youre the same age as we where playing classic the first time.
---
I don't know if I have ever hit download so fast.
---
I mean, pally's are still badass, but they are badass healers.
---
Then you end up with 360 + 36 = 396 hours.
---
But im guessing you are counting the bwl speed run as 5 hours * 40 people = 200 hours.
---
Which makes all of this mega ridiculous.
---
My guild back in vanilla said that anyone who wants to do the rep grind and anyone who wants to help with it can - but as officers we wont force anyone to do it.
---
Then when the first person managed to reach neutral with the brood of nozdormu we as a guild started helping him. All in all we were done with the entire quest chain in one week. We took time out of our official raid nights (4 times x 4 hours per week) to do all the raid stuff and all the boss stuff in the open world.
---
And no, one night of 40 people helping out for 4 hours is not 160 hours, its 4 hours.
---
phase 0.  Basically, the 1st day will be the peak, and then it's downhill from there.

About &lt;Unlucky&gt;:We aim to enjoy vanilla wow in a casual hardcore way, a chunk of our core comes from pservers and dislike the sweaty egotistical scene. Vanilla is a 15 year old easy game and we feel that if you want to play a meme spec then you should be able to. We expect our raiders to show up consumed/enchanted/geared and push their buttons in the right order but won't be enforcing or kicking people out of the guild for making mistakes or missing a raid because real life.

What I'm asking for is the CHOICE. If people want to play on a realm in their native language (just like they can currently do on retail) they should be given the opportunity to do so. Likewise, if they'd like to play on an English speaking realm, they're more than welcome to do so.
---
What people are failing to understand is that players are already planning mass colonisation on certain realms to transform them into unofficial realms for their native language, since Blizzard aren't providing an official solution.

Because you want to play an open world mmo that follows the RPGs design elements and philosophy of the original game, but you dont do you?  You want to abuse layering. We get it.  You dont want sharding in early zones to avoid the clusterfuck, you want the world to be layered and exploitable.
---
AllCraft is the only one that I listen to. It's okay but I really dislike Rich who seems to do most of the talking.
---
Darkshore to Feralas.
---
"AFK 20 min".
---
Osrs isn’t free lmfao. That’s basically saying WoW is free since you can play a demo to level 20 smh.
---
I think everyone is judging everything based on the assumption that the realms will resemble retail, or even private servers. I wager it'll turn out that all this speculation was totally pointless because Classic will actually feature like 10 layered realms per region with 50k+ players on each, and it'll be clear why there aren't special servers for German/Spanish/French. Then when phase 2 hits and it's obvious that servers of that size are completely non-functional without layering, they'll create a bunch of new realms and offer free transfers, including national realms.
---
None of that is for certain, but Blizzard have repeatedly hinted at a small number of very large servers. Things like no national realms at launch, using the word "several" to describe how many realms there will be, and their choice of layering as a crowd control mechanic all point toward megaservers in the beginning and transfers later.

I mean, pally's are still badass, but they are badass healers. And the Expectations photo is still realistic. You pwn undead. Forget which YouTuber, but watching him AoE farm in EPL was glorious.
---
fury tanking hoooo, but I agree dude, I'll tank when needed (I offtanked a lot on my paladin during the 14 years and I loved the "oh shit, buckle up boys, this is gonna get bumpy" shit), but I know I'd be the last one to get dps gear in raids, and I don't want to do that again.     
---
otherwise, tanking on warrior is way better than on paladin so I'll have no issues with tanking a lot when needed!

Get layered.

Was an NA server
---
You are absolutely right. I remember 2005 WoW quite clearly as I’m very old and 14 yeas ago doesn’t seem that long ago.
---
The Howling Vale *does* in fact take you to Duskwood at the end of it. Though really it's an out of the way quest on its own.
---
Exploiting trash, you make me sick.
---
any quest chain that has me running to other zones to get stuff. i make the world feel whole and not these little micro worlds we call zones
---
I suspect you're probably right. I think if this is the approach they're going for it's incredibly sad.
---
Yea. You got me. Totally want to exploit.
---
Just because you were a clicker in 2005 doesn't mean we all were.
---
I wish people would stop this bull already, if you actually wanted to play classic speaking/writing in English wouldn't put a stop to that. If you think otherwise, all I can say is, the game will be better without you :)
---
The funniest and fastest leveling combo ive tried is a paladin and mage, no special telent is needed. All you do is spam arcane explotion and holy light :)
---
It's a bit of a walk, but it's definitely pretty close!
---
I mean with that logic, a new car isn't the price you end up paying out the door, because you need to maintain it, only optional though.
---
I would find a good lawyer to sue Jagex then, because many players have enjoyed that supposed "free" game without paying for all these years, those scumbags!
---
Nah it was always just rumored. As long as you didn't exploit hard like going to GM island they didn't really care.
---
Tongues and Felhunter would lock down a Pally pretty easily.

I'm pretty sure the intent was to fix all the bugs (some might've been fixed by 1.12 anyway).

GL, mods deleted my "looking for wow friend(s) post." hope they arent so dickish to you
---
I probably won't ever do the paladin epic mount quest because it won't be out until phase 2, and I can't imagine going that long without an epic-speed mount. I'd like to commit myself to grinding out Rivendare's charger, just because riding an undead horse on a paladin seems hilarious in an oddly appropriate way.
---
the gliding looks so so so bad tho.
---
Just take some sweet Paladin healz and you should be fine.
---
Depends. I just started an assassination rogue. I got ruined by some mobs. Running outlaw fixed that though
---
&gt;The vid is an extreme example, and even in this example the person didn't end up waiting as long as implied, I guarantee it.
---
here is some sources of other people talking about queue times being one of the reason WoW had one of the shittiest launches in Vidya game history. You are just plain wrong.  
---
 [http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft)   
---
&gt; At launch, things took a turn for the bizarre. Blizzard’s forecasts for the game were dead wrong, the swell of players flooding servers was too much for them to handle. Stores were selling out of the game fast and online vendors were taking orders left and right. When they flipped the servers on, the little light flicked from “on” to “burning on fire please help” as server queues reached the 1000s. The servers were crashing harder than burning ship trying to walk into Mordor.  
---
&gt;If you got past the queues, you were greeted with latency issues, including the infamous “kneel and loot stuff for half an hour” and the even more infamous “disconnect because Internet was really sketchy back then compared to now” and be greeted by the 1,000 person queue. Blizzard issued game time credits for lost playtime and the rocky ride lasted over a month. Afterward, the servers were plagued with dilapidated hardware that wasn’t optimized to run the game and the entire issue wasn’t “perfected” until all the servers were upgraded.

---
&gt; In the days after that launch, server queues routinely [reached into the thousands](http://www.tentonhammer.com/wow/editorial/remembering-the-launch-of-wow), random disconnections were common, and latency issues famously trapped people in a "looting" animation for a half hour. Problems were still frequent by January 2005, when [GameSpot reported](http://www.gamespot.com/news/world-of-warcraft-wracked-by-problems-6116566) that 20 of the game's 88 servers were offline for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend. Blizzard's Mike Morhaime [publicly apologized](http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft/582134p1.html) for the problems and offered four days of free play time for the disruption (street value: about $1.50).  
---
&gt;The server problems got so bad that Penny Arcade [revoked their game of the year award](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/01/17) for the title. "Every week, there is some new calamity that necessitates some huge response on their part, servers are coming down, but if you think that the servers coming back up again will represent an improvement in the basic functionality of the game you’re mistaken," the site wrote.

---
&gt; *WoW* launched with far fewer servers than was needed, and huge chunks of subscribers could not log in or else faced lengthy queues. What's worse is that the problem persisted for weeks and months, resulting in a mea culpa by Blizzard's president and free game time given out to antsy players. 
---
 [https://www.pcgamer.com/the-worst-pc-game-launches/](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-worst-pc-game-launches/) 
---
&gt; In 2004, with 500 employees and 40 servers, Blizzard prepared for a nice, smooth launch of their fantasy MMO [World of Warcraft](https://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft/). Slight problem: they somehow completely misjudged the teeming hordes of excited gamers dying to play. The servers couldn't even come close to handling them.  
---
&gt;Players were forced to join queues of thousands of people waiting to get in, and once online were often dumped out and forced to the rear of another lengthy queue. Even doubling the amount of servers didn't do much to help, and the situation grew so dire Blizzard had to stop shipping boxed copies to stores for fear of more people buying them and further swamping the servers.
---
If you were to replace "language" with "gender" or "skin color" then it should be extremely obvious to even yourself how bigoted your statement would be. It is bigotry all the same and you should be ashamed of your behavior.
---
My friend and I are rolling with the quintessential "I'm horde but he wants to play paladin" comp
---
Sorry for giving a shit about the community aspect of the game.
---
Or...ya know...I consider anything that you need to farm for "bullshit". I do not wish to grind for gold, I want to PvP and when someone wins cause of free action potion it would feel very "p2w".
---
Chat isn't always in English on the big private servers, but it also just isn't a problem. Outside of your guild and premades and such, the need for communication is minimal. Aside from some Chinese folk, there's practically nobody who plays WoW and is so bad at English that they can't manage basic stuff like "u tank DM?" and "inv Jacques pls." When you just run around the world doing random shit, it matters very little whether or not the players around you are good enough at English to have actual conversations. Everyone knows the basic terms and abbreviations.
---
Not at all. If, over the course of the next year, Classic gets ten million people to try it (not an outlandish number, considering the number of current wow players, the number of lapsed players, and the hype surrounding the game), and one in ten of those sticks, that's a playerbase of one million. That's enough to make most start ups drool.
---
Healer in WSG on Horde side? No way
---
What part of my statement contradicts Blizzards reasoning? Layering is to solve population bottlenecks and competition over questing objectives/stability/mob population in general. Again I get people dont want it removed entirely. I am arguing that it likely needs to be around longer than the first couple of zones which is a pretty common request.
---
I foresee population bottlenecks lasting longer than Redridge and am trusting Blizzard to remove it or scale it back appropriately as the game progresses.
---
If we are talking about limiting exploits I am all for it. But again most of the offered solutions feel far too intrusive and would offer a worse playing experience than the solutions they fix.

You want to argue the semantics of bigotry? You must be one of those who also want to argue the semantics of whether or not those migrants are being held in a "concentration camp". It does not matter what label you decide to put on it, it is **disgusting behavior** and it is rampant in this sub.
---
Even so - Rogue, Mage, Warrior still have more playrate than both Paladin and Shaman.
---
They're popular, but they're just middle of the pack or lower if you're shaman as they're pretty under represented.

Except orcs, who will out damage you and resist your stuns.

---
Sharding isn't such a bad thing. I get what you're trying to say, but come on.
---
its veryyyyyyyy low quality, any high quality ones? very blurry for a background for me
---
The entire structure of WoW today encourages bad behaviour, because the whole, gogogo clear shit fast no patience mentality. You aren't really in a dungeon because you want to go on an adventure with your friends, but because you want to do you're quick m+ for your weekly chest.
---
Also since the game has been out for so long everyone expects people to know what they are doing and if someone doesn't they are ridiculed for it. 
---
Classic should be a far superior experience for new players who want to get into WoW, everything takes a lot more time so people that play are in general more patient, the basics are very easy to understand and learn and by the time people get to 60 should have a general idea of what they are doing.
---
Even bad players don't usually get kicked because finding someone else is more difficult.
---
Hopefully. I'd rather have all the players in one place.
---
Just FYI the bugs effecting hunter pets are also effecting warlock pets.  I noticed this on the recent public stress test.

Yea you can do it man! One thing Ill say is the best gear for tanking dungeons isnt always the gear you take to raid. Make sure to think critically and not just follow some dumb prebis list that tries to force you to 440 defense.
---
Def cap is not even close to necessary for dungeons and it causes you to take such little damage that you get no rage and cant hold aggro. You will want to pick up alot of threat/dps plate to gear optimally for dungeon tanking.
---
Definitely get the engi shield. That should be one of the first things you buy at 60.
---
Eh, it's literally standard forum moderation practise.
---
I played mage as a main with a sp as alt during classic. Was going to main mage again, but a mate is wanting to, so been pondering playing a rogue these last few days.
---
Yeah that's true, but I've had people counterspell grenades playing a warlock. Anything to interrupt the fear, which tends to come shortly after engaging so they have their trigger finger ready.

"best class" yeah in a scenario where you have bis.
---
Now tell me which warrior has time for both raid and bg.
---
Either youre no life maintank getting bis or you dont get bis and end up being as useful as everyone else in pvp.
---
Classic matters only one thing
---
The ability to play your class correctly.
---
Even a bis warrior can get pwned by any class if they know what to do.

Long nights in ulduar? Wtf, it takes an hour to run at max.

I think TBC had the perfect talents, in fact they were introduced at the end of classic for several weeks and it was awesome.

Holy fuck, the chairs look comfortable, the desks are pretty sweet.
---
But the combination of the two looks like a nightmare,  no thanks om the back and arm strain.
---
Yea and every time you dont hit freedom thats a 1.5 second GCD that contributes almost nothing to the fight while a warrior is smacking your face. 
---
If you let him gap close he will interrupt and mortal strike you and you dead.
---
It takes an extra day played to get to 60, but then you are only OP as fuck for 1.5 years.  Just hard to justify that extra day though....
---
Would totally buy you a beer.

I'll do dungeons with pugs at 60 and hopefully join a guild from the connections I make! ( plan to role a healer :3 )

Is that true? I rolled a rouge in vanilla and I was too little to remember Paladins wearing cloth
---
Swords and Sandals?
---
I understood that reference
---
I agree. But the shadow priest was a pvp monster so he wanted to be that anyway and i think we had 6 warlocks. They're easier to find on Horde. So no paladins. Plus, everyone there was recruited, after the guild leader and about the top 20 of us got turned down by the #1 guild at the time. When we passed them, some of them got poached too, lol!
---
The real question is, what happens if population doesn't decline fast enough? 
---
Do we get an extended phase 1 until the population reaches the point where layering is not needed anymore?  
---
Do we get more servers and make transfers available to those servers only?

---
Still remains to be seen for the resto tree - If there are a lot of pets (cats) and I see my knockdown for heals going back consistently, I'll probably switch to Nature's Focus - But this is what I plan on rolling with now.  If I'm getting hit enough to where Nature's focus comes into play, I would be using barkskin as well (Which is not on the GCD, and helps cast roots as well). We'll see. 
---
1 point in enrage gives me 15 rage with Furor - Enough to Charge + Bash. 
---
You do need the 100% proc rate on NG to time it right when there's more than one person hitting you, or you want to trap someone out of LOS of their cleanse/dispel (Think of a warrior+Priest chasing you, round a corner, NG and let the warrior get caught to maximize the time he spends in roots before he can get a cleanse).
---
For pure PVP-only, you can drop reflection for Nature's focus, but this let's me PvE as well (Gatta get that gear :D). Reflection is still decent for PvP as well, so that's a big loss in PvE for a small PvP gain.
---
Gnome mage (original I know).
---
As others have said, it really looks like Blizzard just doesn't have any faith in their own product. I'm sure they have a lot of market research data that we don't, but it's hard to believe the game will do so poorly that there will be a reasonable number of players for one layer on "several" servers by phase two.
---
Is someone disagreeing with you trolling? 
---
Is someone pointing out your incorrect definition trolling?
---
OK.

Hunter is great especially if you spec beast mastery as the pet does most of the heavy lifting for you

Blood Elf Death Knight.
---
You don't agree that calling for the total segregation of people who speak other languages is not bigotry? I hope you find your wish. I hope you end up on a server where everyone thinks exactly like you do. You deserve it.

Hunter is pretty noon friendly, however does require a but of pet macro

druid heal can help aoe woth hurricane and hand out an innervate should thinks get close.

What would bear or tree form be?
---
Frost mage in pve. Bind fb to 1 and let your drinking bird parse 99 for you
---
I would not go hunter, it's very easy to mess stuff up, especially in group content. 
---
Personally, I would go mage. Mage seems tricky, but that's just because there are really sophisticated people out there aoe grinding and pvping. If you WANT to, you can pretty must just walk 30 yards away from a mob, and frostbolt until it dies. You will take a bit of damage, but it does absolutely work.
---
What a scewed fucking way of looking at things lol.
---
First of all, its official raid hours - so if anything its worth negative gold since you dont make gold while raiding - you spend it. But realisticly you just count it as 0 since its time you wont be farming gold anyway.
---
And since its official raid hours you have decided to give this time to the guild when you joined so no, its not 640 man hours. Its 16 guild hours.
---
There is an ongoing poll with thousands of responses, go check it out

Let him pick whatever interests him the most. That's how you get him to love WoW. He'll pick up the basics regardless of class.
---
It's not easy to pull off for any class, but my money is on Mages and Hunters being the ones who can pull it off the best. I don't know the skill level of your buds, but I've seen good Frost Mages 1v4 melee in Vanilla, it is possible.
---
Husband/wife team looking for a guild raiding 2-3 days a week, at a decent level, not expecting to clear content first, but not far behind.
---
Ideally raids starting some time after 20:00 UK time, 2-3 nights per week.
---
We've both played on and off since Vanilla at varying levels.
---
I'm looking to play warrior as tank and she's going to be a pocket healer, however if a suitable guild has specific requirements we can certainly adapt to meet those!
---
No, I'm calling for consumer choice. Thanks, so do I.
---
Yeah remember when Disney had a bunch of racist cartoons? Great times right?
---
&gt; you dont make gold while raiding
---
You might not, but my guild does. 2000g per hour.
---
I've been on them for so many years now I guess I haven't really noticed. Always assumed that those who played on classic servers were the most hardcore of the WoW fans.
---
So we are getting realm 3 layers!!!!
---
You have it backwards, the issue is not that you wouldn't understand English, it's that you wouldn't understand the people who refuse to speak it.
---
Venruki/Ziqo messed around with it a lot in SM while levelling 30 -&gt; 40. They tried 2x mage 1x priest, 2x mage and other random stuff. Mage is definitely the best dps for dungeon farming but it didn't look like you gain much from trying to forgo tank/healer except to try to look like a pro and make every pull dangerous. Most of the time it would all go to hell and they'd be jumping around CoC/arcane explosioning kiting and running oom. If you just take a healer and tank it becomes extremely easy to just group up 2-3+ packs and blizzard them down from max range.
---
I'd say 2 frost mages is plenty for the dps, you don't gain that much going to 3 or 4 after the first two.  
---
I'll be surprised if the first people to 60 aren't mages using this method. It's definitely fast if you have the pulls down and don't waste time.
---
Every class will be slower to level in classic than pservers.
---
Looking for a casual/social pve/pvp guild that is looking to see all the game has to offer at a nice leisurely pace.  I played wow fanatically from vanilla through wrath and loved all the social aspects of the game as well as the raiding. But due to life circumstances, I will probably not have the time to raid and will instead likely stick to 5-mans for at least a few months after release. More than happy to join a guild to help folks prep/farm gear for raids.
---
Yeah trying to bottleneck someone is a good way to fail.
---
1 - Leveling as a paladin and warrior you should go **Holy** Pally + **Arms** Warrior (can tank all 5 man - 10 man), best pvp, best pve till raids.  
---
 \*You don't need the hammer from the level 20 quest, if you want to enjoy the class however you can do it.  
---
2 - No clue, but some items in SFK are pretty neat for warriors/paladins  
---
3 - The stones are just to join a party but you can't choose with who you will play with, its random and takes a fuck load of time  
---
 \*You get better items in dungeons  
---
4 - It takes a long ass time to get it, it is in stonetalon and wetlands then RFK, and you have a chance to drop a chest on RFK and another on SFK that are almost the same lol. still if you want enjoy the ride that will take like a day just do it bro  
---
5 - its quite easy to do as a war+pally as it is the most op combo because war +  holy pal can 2v10, but you could choose to skip it and only do bonebiter :)  
---
6 - stay 2h arms always, its stronger specially if you have that pocket healer with you, fury would be good but not better in BWL, still in world/bgs pvp Arms + pocket heal is king.  
---
You will only DW when you have + %Hit and for all we know it is going to be needed 9% hit and not 8%hit  like on pservers.
---
Petitions will get deleted or ignored. Post constructive feedback in the forum post Blizzard made:

Specialized language servers would die. Playerbase wont be big enough longterm for a spanish only or german only server to survive
---
Chinese is a big issue on ND though. Makes it almost impossible to group up with people while levelling.
---
2000g per hours in bfa isnt that much.
---
But im guessing you are playing on some private server where you are allowing tourists to join your raids and pay gold to roll on items.
---
And let me assure you - this wasnt a thing back in 2006 when a guild held a server hostage by not opening the AQ gates. And that is what we are discussing - right?
---
And if your guild in Classic wont be helping their guild mates complete their AQ gate quest chains because the gold/hour is too low then seriously fuck you and your guild :)
---
I carry a sword and board for interrupting casters...
---
If you gave a shit about the community you'd go out of your way to interact with others than your fellow Germans(or other nationality). The circle jerk you are fostering is better left in bfa.
---
Funny you posted this! I remember when I wasn’t younger I hated playing Pally, I thought it was boring. Now, playing on an undocumented server, I rolled a Dwarf Pally and I realize I understand the mechanics so much better now. SoC, Judge, SoR, Judge I’m murdering shit. I also rolled a Druid, which is still my favorite class, but I’m liking being able to heal AND melee without switching forms. Definitely like it more than Warrior, which I loved playing and thought was so much more fun back in the day
---
Nice that'll be fun!  My wife played at the tail end of vanilla when we were already dating.
---
She played casual just enjoying her character and the world.  She would keep wuest items that granted temporary companions and just abandon the quest.  By 60 she had 3 summonable pets from all her questing that were never meant to be kept.  I didn't even know you could keep them .  Pretty sure the rest of us just turned them in to complete the quest.

&lt;Drive&gt;
---

The In Dreams quest line is pretty good.
---
Where is he getting his 1.12 footage from? Doesn't look like it's 2004/2005 vanilla footage. Looks like p server footage.
---
this silly picture actually encapsulates a lot of differences between the two and the problems many people have with retail.
---
I'll probably try to patch the files to add some updated legion graphics or animations lol
---
Specially if you wield that awesome looking Ironfoe, that thing is hot.
---
Phase 1 will probably see the biggest drop off in population. Everyone who subs for retail will be able to play Classic, so it only makes sense some number of retail players will at least check Classic out. From there, I think people will play as long as they have content to do. 
---
From my own anectodal observations, private server population go down by about half once all the content is completed. Not saying these people have quit entirely, but they don't need to be levelling, they probably got everything on farm and don't care about farming consumables as much, have already levelled some alts, so they just have less reason to play. 
---
So biggest drop-off phase 1 is my guess, and then some steady attrition from there on out as people burn out from the gold farm for their raiding.
---
Same. Love turtles. Tooga's a dope, but he's good-hearted.
---
The issue is that they wouldn't have to speak English. They'll just continue speaking their language and the server will be split with groups of people you can never interact with as an English speaker.

For some reason our MT didnt want the TF, he kept Quel’Serrar instead and gave the TFs to offtank and rogues..
---
Original games are pretty rare period. You can almost always point to an earlier version.
---
However, I would argue Hearthstone was fairly novel. It made a number of advancements over earlier digital card games.
---
We absolutely sold raids in Vanilla and plan to again in Classic, including Scarab Lord.
---
And a guild can only complete one scepter per raid team. Nefarian only drops ONE Red Scepter Shard. That's it.
---
Pretty sure it's a reference to Link's Awakening.
---
Ah gotcha ty, have fun in classic fellow traveler
---
It's better than the jerky arm and leg movements in the linked video
---
Maxed settings for my card really. I want the classic gaming experience but I like my eyes still, graphics is just a QOL change IMO
---
Ngl, I’ve heard so much vanilla hate over the last 10 years from people who didn’t want classic to happen that I’ll keep upvoting ‘retail bad’ posts until the end of time.

Yes. Jumping into a conversation that you admit you have no interest in just to nitpick semantic details is trolling. Thank you for your contribution.
---
I'll be playing Classic on the maximum settings possible, including editing CVars to get more draw distance and effects.
---
And if someone comes up with a solid way to inject Retail models and animations into the game, I'll probably do that too.
---
yes private server, no impact on visuals or animations though it's client side.

My mistake, I didn’t click on the link that was mentioned. [It was a 6 hour work day](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/business/international/in-sweden-an-experiment-turns-shorter-workdays-into-bigger-gains.html?module=inline) which amounts to even less than a 4 day work week at 8 hours a day. So my point still stands.

---
I am looking for a guild that raids a few times during the week.
---
I don't care if I am Horde or Alliance. The only thing that matters is the raid time. I am available after 7 PM PST.
---
I don't care what role I fill, I just want to be part of a guild that can handle content. I played a mage in vanilla and BC, a hunter vanilla and BC, a prot pally in WOTLK, and a resto druid in WOTLK.
---
I participated in raids (with many server firsts and top 100 world kills) from the end of Vanilla to the end of WOTLK.
---
The only downside I have is that I cannot take time off of work during the launch, so I will be slower at getting to 60 than others.
---
Cheers!
---
This will be removed soon due to well mega thread
---
Who did you kill for that username?
---
Nostalrius!
---
Another 30-something guy looking to relive the WoW heyday of vanilla. Looking for Alliance, PvE or PvP Server, West coast leveling/dungeon partner(s), so to speak. I'm struggling to decide what class to play but I'm leaning towards prot pally or shadow priest, maybe a druid. What can I say, I like the hybrid type classes/specs.
---
Can someone explain why there are so many bugs that didn’t exist back then, but have surfaced now? Every day it seems like a ton of bugs are being uncovered.
---
This needs upvoted
---
You are calling for the "choice" to act on bigotry. That is a "choice" that disenfranchises others. That is a "choice" that is illegal in the majority of the free world.
---
You will.. for 30 seconds.
---
^ This is the type of person who will be /ignored by half the server he's on in Classic
---
This is key. As of now the case for abandonware is diminished. When Nost got a C&amp;D though that case was pretty strong and may have stood up in court. The real question is: would you fight an army of lawyers hired by a billion dollar company?
---
I hope they send out more beta invites soon, so I can stop reading this shit
---
I hope there is a list of servers that the streamers are on. I wish to avoid them (and their followers) at all costs.
---
That, and you're level 8-10 at the time. You have to leash one at a time and hope the bears and wolves don't add.
---
You can't just not agree with the hive mind you fool!
---
Human paladin.  Brazik has been the same since TBC and is coming full circle to Classic! Super excited for all aspects of it. Dps, Tanking, and Healing.
---
Thanks a lot! :) Hopefully the series can go outside the Valley of Trials soon :) I'm regrettably unable to work for the next few weeks (traveling), but some more episodes before launch is feasible !
---
Blizzard would prolly remove layering before using that bad idea, and im glad about that
---
A midsummer short is a great idea! Sadly, I think I've missed my shot this summer - maybe the next one!
---
indeed
---
Thank you! :D I appreciate the compliment!
---
i had a pally in wotlk and i wore cloth in 5 mans while leveling
---
How about a map of graveyards?
---
Thanks a lot for the compliment ^^ I always hope a lot of people will see them (and enjoy them) !
---
I think this is the right answer.
---
Thanks buddy! :)
---
Still undecided. If DPS, Undead warlock or Resto Shaman if healer.
---
:D Glad you liked it!
---
Paladin is easily the best healer because BoP/DP save many wipes. No healer aoe is significant when you have mages with blizzard, that's all the dps you need. Adding 2% extra a magma totem isn't adding anything. That being said any healer should be ok, but pally is clearly the best.
---
There are already language specific realms on retail. LOCK BLIZZARD UP!
---
If you say so. You'll be /ignored just the same. I'll be happily raiding. Enjoy judging people solely based out of a reddit post, child.
---
Can definitely say I would rather another Mage than a healer.
---
3x Blizz on a pack kills them real quick
---
&gt; we get a full 60-man raid group
---
hol up.  Raids cap at 40, not 60.
---
You play a warlock on Argent dawn by any chance?
---
yeah just a 15% chance to miss your spells no big deal. Not to mention pitiful +spell dmg at that stage of the game on one of the hardest scaling spellcasters that sucks the most on short fights due to no CDs.

If you play without mouse, keyboard, brain and internet connection... yea, vanilla and current WoW could be said to be equaly difficult.
---
Because Classic is not using the Vanilla game engine. They have taken the models, textures, and database data from vanilla and modified it to work in a much newer version of the game engine (~ 8.0 engine) and so there are a handful of compatibility issues and some things from the new engine 'peaking through' for lack of a better term.
---
No fishing hat from STV? 
---
What a disgrace
---
Man...by the time you started playing wow, I had already given up on it being fun.
---
Must be Alliance math
---
Nah man. Layering is fine... its better than the alternatives. We need layering otherwise the entire server will collapse thus killing classic in its entirety. #changes  /s
---
Although you probably think this reddit is half of the people that will play Classic. Enjoy the shock in August and going forward.  Also enjoy the "You've been ignored by everyone." on your server with your own manchild attitude.
---
Not boaring enough
---
I thought the Dwarves were always saying "Forty Alliance!" as they charged into battle?
---
Pservers use 2005 cliente duh
---
Oh true I plan on being a PvP neck beard
---
My potato pc is going for classic graphics he can’t choose
---
Your stated reasons are true, but it's only half the picture. What Ion was talking about [at Blizzcon](https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=53) are the tourists. He puts it quite nicely in the video so I suggest giving it a watch. This is the "problem" that layering (or back then, sharding) intends to solve. What's important to note is, like Ion says, these people are not going to be high level. You're not going to get tourists at level 30, as that is a pretty significant time investment. That's something that takes weeks for most people to accomplish, and at that point, if you're still playing, you're clearly not part of the tourist population.
---
If it turns out that there is such a huge number of high levels that they cannot be contained in a single layer, then that means that the server population is way, way out of control. And then we have much bigger issues, as Blizzard cannot disable layering.
---
because it is not the same client. They took the Legion client and are essentially down-scaling it to match Vanilla.
---
I looked at it and just assumed the the chairs slid in further. If they don’t...big yikes
---
Is there any confirmation that it will be using patch files like the original game?
---
You don't think Activision blizzard would try to maximize income? If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you.
---
a blunt because if i gotta wait 2 more months to play i might as well get high af
---
Is this a cause for concern? I saw the litany of hunter bugs on a post yesterday. Is there reason to believe that blizzard will have the majority of bugs fixed before release in august?
---
I mean the more logical thing to do when 100+ people gank you is just log out. I doubt they would care to retaliate.
---
At launch I stayed guild-less up until I left.  When I came back to check out Wrath I joined a guild that fell apart after a few months, which was cool as I left the game not long after.
---
This time around I have joined a raiding guild that was also recruiting casual players as well.  I don't really have any plans to get on the raid treadmill again, but the option is open with the guild if I change my mind.
---
2 mages and a warlock as dps. Warlock can at least help with aoe and between teleport/portals and summoning you never really nees to leave
---
Rested zones is the best solution since there is an inn in almost every zone that you might want to go to while leveling.
---
Risky
---
WoW made big advancements in leveling.
---
In particular, quests as your main way to level. In EQ, you mostly grinded to max to level on mobs.
---
Layering is by definition continent wide.
---
Why do these threads always start with "I'm all for no changes" and then they want changes?
---
As long as you feel good about what you achieve, that's what matters.
---
Thanks for the feedback! However it is mostly flawed.
---
&gt;2 whole exorcisms every 5 mins
---
It certainly doesn't help sustained DPS; it adds some more burst and control that isn't just tacking on Crusader Strike to the kit. Let's be honest, it's for PVP and solo play (which fits what  Vanilla Ret was).
---
&gt;Also Avenging Wrath was never tied to forbearance.
---
[Incorrect](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=31884)
---
&gt;If you want dps meter classes
---
That's not what I want.
---
&gt;If you want a class with powerful unique game-changing abilities, play paladin.
---
I've offered up what I would call "powerful, unique, game changing". So I think I've fit the class design better than just tacking on Crusader Strike.
---
I dont know if that guy is trolling or serious. But wondering if serious, how he came up to accuse you of wanting to abuse layering lol.

They are the kings of world pvp but now they are meh.
---
Mostly max evcerything except the ugly-ass water.
---
I don't think there will be any issues. The majority of the bugs are cosmetic (textures and animations wrong for example) that don't really impact playing the game, so even if they aren't caught or fixed by release, they will be pretty quickly. There are a few big bugs that could really impact leveling and I don't think it'll be hard for Blizzard to knock those out over the next two months.
---
Why did the other video that this one is referencing get deleted but this remains up?
---
You forgot the part where you get separated into different layers
---
Yeah you would just use what ever had better stats on it.
---
Debuff limit is only an issue if you are sm/ruin or other corruption spec, pet pathing is not an issue if you are sacrificing them anyway. Locks are also the least squishy of the clothies with all that Stam/hp.
---
Not really. People already flamed Chance for saying he was gonna stop streaming. Called him a cry baby if I believe right.
---
Then layering makes you see nothing but emptiness 👍
---
No bloodlust in classic, it's a TBC thing at level 70 only.
---
Me a do nothing kind of orc
---
To be fair, there comes a point in Vanilla where there is nothing to do but roll an alt or pvp, as the only gear upgrades come from the second half of BWL and that run isn't for another 4 days so you run laps around the stairs leading into the bank in IF (or the roof of the bank in Org) for 30 minutes before logging off.
---
I predict a lot of tryhards will roll alliance for the petty pve advantage, so on the majority of servers horde will be underdogs.
---
No idea. I just want to play the game man. I don’t give two shits if I don’t see random person A questing all of a sudden.
---
Thank you
---
Alright cool. My brother is dead set on rolling hunter and I wouldn’t want him to play an effectively broken class.

Besides subbing, what can you even do to try to get beta access?
---
Difficult in what sense? You could set up one button macros in vanilla. Enemy mechanics were pretty cut and dry. It's easier to get epic gear in retail, but that doesn't mean much on its own.
---
If layering is implemented as is, then layer hopping for resources is 100% a non-bannable offense.  The number of videos I have seen with people innocently being put in another realm makes it impossible to police.  Additionally people will just offload resources onto mule accounts who dont have layered activity.  The only way to prevent the devastation of the in-game economy is either:
---
A) Layers hopping can only occur in inns
---
B) Layering is removed entirely &amp; the game is how it was supposed to be in the first place.
---
Let's be imaginative instead of complacent.
---
What's janky? It's just animation speed based on movement. It looks way better. One of the few changes I'd be happy with.
---
Depends on the server.
---
Traditionally, horde racials far and away outclass the alliance for PVP.
---
But whichever faction has more dedicated pvpers. On my server, soutshore was dead for days on end. NPC spawned and was immediately killed.
---
Go warrior. Rogue stealth isn't great in vanilla and they have an additional expense of mats for their poisons.
---
Thanks for the response. Mind sharing the private you're on? I am also interested in doing some dry runs and also still trying to decide on what class to play. I'm playing alliance and a class I've never played before to have a new experience.
---
How so?  Mobs were overturned on private servers compared to classic
---
Yeeeeees! Meridian 59! Haven't heard that title in a while.
---
Nnnnnnaaaagaaahh!
---
&gt;  Alliance is the better faction because we have paladins.
---
And that makes the difference how?
---
There aren't always a paladin in every single engagement. Even if there is, it doesn't auto win engagements. There's a number of racials on horde side that couneract key crowd controls which can turn a fight.
---
Important to remember that taking a healer and tank reduces the XP by a lot.
---
Hu... so that's why I love druids!!
---
*Laughs in PAA vs PVP rivalry on Dark Iron in its heydays*
---
I've been listening to a lot of Kevin Jordan's streams. Balance doesn't have to be "make everyone the same". My suggestion does not make Ret better at sustained DPS.
---
I know it's not the original, but I actually like the current animation.
---
Yeah, can’t back down because your viewers will harass you for it, can’t keep playing because of massive gank group,
---
calling for fanboy reinforcements saves face and “promotes interaction with fan base” or some shit, blah blah blah, absurd wPvP.
---
Max and maybe an increased UI scale. Should be able to handle it with a RTX 2080.
---
Also to note, I've found most humanoid bosses can be slowed, at least the ones I tested.
---
I imagine 3x Mage could actually clear most bosses no problem.
---
Sounds healthy!
---
Layers will be removed eventually.
---
Do you have a guild funnelling supplies?
---
Anyone remember Rathmus from Nathrezim Horde? The guy who came up with, popularized and ran the Rathmus strategy for actually winning AV on the Horde side (aka rath-strat)? Fucking legend, that dude. Running in his AV premades were some of the most memorable times in WoW for me. 
---
Weird thing is, I remember him talking about his life some, and he was just a regular dude. He was a trucker (maybe?) by trade, he would play in these bursts between long absences. Honestly, if Twitch was around then, he could make bank streaming his exploits.
---
Welcome to the internet, is it your first day here?
---
Imaginative gave us retail wow I rather be complacent and enjoy classic wow for its good and bad
---
Hopefully there is a server with a bunch of late night guilds so I even have the option of raiding and more than 1 guild.  Otherwise it will be level to 60 then xfer to a guild that has a raiding schedule I can make.
---
This sub is densely concentrated with those dense MFs
---
Reddit is like liquid, this sub is like a super-compressed solid of... [REDACTED]
---
just got an update for wow classic, it says live: classic and retail and installed it. "No servers available." Feelsbadman
---
My unarmored ancient frost tiger. For more salt.
---
I was correcting a factual error, Sweden has in fact never tried a 4 day work week, I have not said a word about anything else. Spreading misinformation is bad even if it's unintended.
---
As far as I remember there were rarely issues with modifying appearances. I used to change colors and stuff all the time, but it is risky in the sense that you can easily change models and exploit the game.
---
I'll be a going Alliance, so probably Horde.
---
If the OPs image gets you so butthurt you post as others have look into some mental help or stick with BfA. You'll max out your ignore list and end up with a handful on your friends list unlike what some delusional people hate believe.  And a friendly reminder to go and trace the history of private servers and how the mainstream WoW community reacted to them for years.  Who were the "insecure manchildren"?  The retail players.  And they still are as evidence of posts in this thread. Enjoy having 90% of your Classic server on ignore though.
