Hell yes! I got the game 2 weeks after launch and was way behind my friends. I rushed leveling and didn't really have alts above 20 until late BC.
---

---
This time I am going to take my time and enjoy the lore and world.
---
---
---
horde:
---
hunters go in the melee group for TSA + wolf, your pet needs to not die or your melee is going to be pissed, so you have to be very careful fight to fight keeping it alive. for horde you aren't likely to get agi totem unless you have a shaman twisting the whole time (you're in the melee group so you are getting windfury and probably tranquil air totem instead)
---
alliance:
---
haven't raided alliance side as a hunter but im assuming u go night elf, get all the blessings but still keep ur pet in line on cleave fights and passive aoe fights, you probably get more out of blessings than on horde side, even if a shaman is totem twisting in your favor (very unlikely - keep in mind that its not that hard to pull aggro on a hunter, and if your FD gets resisted you are probably wiping your raid and getting yelled at)
---
No,
---
In 2005 I leveled a hunter to 47.
---
Then during WoD and legion I tried several PS.
---
Absolutely
---
so then tell me, what makes vanilla more exciting besides the nostalgia? is is to level a Mage to 60 and all u do in raids as Rotation is spamming 1 button for ur entirety of raiding? Boss Mechanics only having 1 mechanic until AQ40/Naxx.
---
Don't get me wrong, i like vanilla too, but only because i play a Feral Druid and therefore have to hit my timing and always getting behind the boss if it's moving(1st boss in AQ40 for example) and this is especially fun when people used to Think that Feral is bad.
---
The way to 60 will definitely be exciting, no fucking doubt. PvP will be too, i don't play it though. But raiding is ResidentSleeper. Naxx is a joke literally and most of the classes are boring too.
---
I will get downvoted, i know, but i experienced this stuff on a private Server already, and i still don't get why i want to do it again.
---
But this was a comparison between BfA and Vaa and yes, he is true, BfA is more fast paced(even though with the GCD thing it got a lot slower) and u have a actually Rotation, not the boring 1-1-1-1-1-1 or for rogues 3 same buttons to spam.
---
I disagree with your thoughts on this topic.  They‚Äôve been extremely clear on their intentions.  They‚Äôre to see how Classic goes, and decide after they have more information. 
---
What you‚Äôre actually suggesting is that they have to ma like that decision right now, which isn‚Äôt true and would be foolish on their part.
---
Message anyone who is selling cloth and have them cod it to you rather than ASH it then sell it for more on ah. the farmers get a constant source of sale and you make a profit. i did this in BC and on Runescape before the grand exchange
---
Pretty biased section of the community will bother to read the comments when the post is utter shite.
---
&gt; Boss Mechanics only having 1 mechanic until AQ40/Naxx.
---
And here we see another seething retail player coming here to shit on a game he has never played.
---
What a great response.  Thumbs up üëç
---
By all accounts yes. The info they have told us about warlock demon summoning shows that they know and care about all the fiddly little mechanic stuff so there's no reason to assume there will be any changes from 1.12.
---
I‚Äôm just excited d to have a damn good game to play with friends. These last couple of years have been utter shit when it comes to multiplayers. The battle royals games are getting really stale, and let‚Äôs not even discuss the current state of the MMO genre.
---
I‚Äôll be playing casual to moderate and totally pumped to do it!
---
If that's what you got out of that thread, I understand the chip that this subreddit has on its shoulder.
---
* [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/big2ua/remember_that_vanilla_comes_with_a_lot_less_of/em0h4y6/) is a guy making fun of people who obviously have never played classic (ie current retail players)
---
* [second comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/big2ua/remember_that_vanilla_comes_with_a_lot_less_of/em0csmz/) is a joke, then recognizing that current wow players might try it and then stop
---
* [third comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/big2ua/remember_that_vanilla_comes_with_a_lot_less_of/em0cwcl/) is clearly a troll from this subreddit calling retail players idiots
---
Can‚Äôt count how many afk nelfs I‚Äôve killed using shadowmeld.
---
Well if you were choosing between a shaman and paladin only, sure. But you got a priest too who can spam dispels, shields and shit. And the shaman can purge your enemy, making them even easier for you to kill.
---
Ontop of that you get on the horde side which is kinda a big advantage for you in general, as a warrior.
---
This actually was my first epic on my hunter in Vanilla. I spent all my gold on it because I just wanted an epic. This is why Vanilla will never be the same. Everyone knows too much about the game now.
---
[removed]
---
And you are not coming up with a single boss that is intense until AQ40. Nefarian from BWL maybe, i like that fight personally even though i hated it getting killed by his breath as a rogue.
---
but btw. i'm not playing retail anymore if u really wanna know, i even deinstalled battle net as i'm not playing any Blizzard game atm.
---
but i played on private Servers for 5+ years, and therefore also cleared Naxx. And even heroic raiding on retail is more intense then classic.
---
Like seriouy u guys should come up with arguments instead of trying to defend a game that u love but u Know is boring as hell. aeast try to defend it then.
---
We're all in the same boat.  Im not about to pick up anything else until I can play my favorite game. 
---
Classic Summer!
---
Great Job!
---
I highly doubt Blizz is gonna go through all the extra work for this. My guess is that if they are gonna do battlegroups, they are gonna add it once, and *maybe* re-align the servers due to population once a year or something. Blizz seems to want to have a plan to get everything done now so they can just hit a button and release a new phase instead of continue work on the game after it releases.
---
Oh shit
---
One of my favourite memories of vanilla was 2manning RFD at level 42ish. We wiped so many times against the final lich boss, with his adds swarming over me as a Druid healer. A combination of challenging shout and retaliation finally killed them, and my warrior friend getting punted off the platform at critical health allowed me to moon fire the bosses final 5% hp down
---
Warrior hunter paladin sounds fun to me. Excellent for leveling. Also, it would be fun to try 3-man dungeons, it‚Äôs an interesting challenge, and gives alright xp.
---
Hunter as dps and a Tanky pet, you as dps spec, either dpsing or tanking depending on the pull. Pally as efficient heals, but still judging light and whacking with a meaty 2h for extra damage.
---
You would never run out of mana as a grp, have constant uptime, and have good gear for everybody.
---
What gets me about that cinematic is, that's  a dwarf. The bear comes up to his chest.
---
How bloody tiny is that bear?
---
Dispel padding is good fun though.
---
What's wrong with what I said? Please tell me.
---
Hot damn, that is one heck of a map!
---
They're all intense when you haven't cleared them yet. Get over yourself.
---
Battlegroups, aka cross realm bgs, *is* no changes. It was in vanilla.
---
Haha! I saw the SC2 trailer reference in there
---
It only when my bag is full (because it only deletes the last item in my last bag which is my shard bag). I guess I don't really have a need for anything more complex than that
---
That sounds obscure enough that they didn't catch it.
---
Keep in mind most of the people who are nay-sayers of the sorts were not even a stain int he sheets when WoW was released, that or were maybe just starting to walk/talk.  
---
Most of the older crowd I play with and have played with since Vanilla launch are excited to go and re-live the nostalgia and are looking forward to putting in a long term effort into the game. I am VERY excited, and I wish some of the newer WoW players who are just trying to piss on everyone's Wheaties would chill the F out.
---
Well; consider the following.
---
Some of those people have put... what are we at now? 14 or 15 years? They've put that time into the game. They have characters that have been there the entire time. 
---
Now? Now we're telling them that all their work is for nothing. We rather reset than keep playing like they do.  That's a very hard pill for them to swallow and the thought that such a thing could hollow out their community makes them anxious.
---
I had that when I played a hunter back in 5th grade. Clearly BIS at the time for Hunters. I had no idea why my group mates were upset when I needed it. Good times
---
Yeah you said that
---
I cannot wait for release. 
---
Impatient Retail Boi tears.... I live for that shit. If I can possibly identify a Retail player on the opposite faction, I may just camp them. 
---
I‚Äôm tired of people shitting on this. Just don‚Äôt play, move on with your life. But they will play, and they will cry. But not for long.
---
Sonii was a good guest and had good inputs throughout the show. Good episode of classicast
---
This is awesome... but is there one without the flight path lines?
---
You need to spend 18 points into Improved Sap in the Subtlety tree otherwise sap will bring you of stealth. Even then there's a 10% chance that Sap with unstealth you.
---
Well first, this is a game it's not real life. Secondly, players always have the option to go and collect items in the game themselves. We simply charge a convenience fee for utilizing the AH and trade systems.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
It's almost like Vanilla's existence offends them or somthing. I don't like modern WoW but I've never made a thread bashing it. I just stopped playing.
---
I'm know classic WoW experience is more enjoyable for me. I even play on several private servers. This game will not die after a few months, it is still as awesome as I remember it.
---
I got rid of it after a about half a year. I‚Äôm not sure what actually became of the card itself. I am military and a semi minimalist. I probably threw it away. Kind of wish I still had it for nostalgia.
---
Modern wow is gpu renderinf intensive.  You just need a graphics card with 4+gb ram on it.  Your processor will matter very little
---
You are very right though, old classic engine was extremely processor intensive, because gpu rendering wasnt a thing when the engine was built
---
Guilds.
---
Not even then tbh it only changes dungeon priorities a little bit.
---
Intense is not the same as exciting. I was excited in MC too even though i knew it was easy. But it wasn't intense by any means. the only fight in MC that could've got intense was the 2nd last boss. Get ober yourself and just see how it is. You can still enjoy it ofc and i don't want anyone to not enjoy classic, but i don't want them to get excited.
---
But if u haven't played on a p-server, ur last time playing vanilla is a long time ago and u will see that not much will be like back in the days. the leveling, yes still as fun as back in the days, but endgame content is way different than u actuly remember.
---
well that macro won't work come classic anyway. It will need to be an addon.
---
Everything you said is a positive and what I love about vanilla.  Even the stuff you tried to put a negative spin on.
---
And to answer the question posed in your title.. yes, I ACTUALLY remember vanilla.  Been playing it for many years.  Actually just logged off about an hour ago.
---
I didn't have the time to get this one started, but, I was thinking about taking any essential gear or weapon that was not soulbound to the player. COD it or delete it if no payment is collected. However, most players in classic seem to have loyalty and will not run away with the gold. Especially if the guild is big enough and they want continued loans for other characters.
---
First you said "bosses have 1 mechanic" but now you're telling me to "come up with a single boss that is intense", whatever "intense" means.
---
If you truly did play pservers for 5+ years, you would know that even in MC, bosses have more than 1 mechanic. Hell, even the first boss has more than 1 mechanic.
---
* Why you talk about Mortal Strike in a Fury build?
---
* Unless the data is wrong, Slam base cast time is 1.5. Talented it gets down to 1.1 or 1.0 depending on 4/5 or 5/5 talents. Slam is not 0.5 cast.
---
* The auto attack doesn't "resume" after the Slam cast. It starts over from the beginning. At least that's what happens on Light's Hope. Meaning a 1.1sec auto attack loss is MINIMUM. If Slam is used at the non-optimal time because of lag or human error, you can close A LOT more auto attack damage than 1.1sec. If you have a 3.8 speed weapon you can lose up to 3.7 sec auto attack if you're really laggy/dumb. You can test this pretty easily simply by building up 100 rage and then spending it on multiple Slams in a row because the auto attack ever hits.
---
I wasn't going to comment on your post since it seems counter-intuitive that when I ask a question, I have to correct misunderstandings in a guy who answers. Kind of the opposite of what I was going for when I asked a question. But seeing as your comment got upvoted, either someone else also misunderstood, or else I'm wrong.
---
The guy below you suggested that, need people like you.
---
Oooh BC heroics were good.  We were fairly hardcore raiders too.  One day we decided to do ALL the heroics, we figured there had to be some kind of hidden  achievement or something.  14 hours, delerium, frayed nerves, and one somulant druid later, and... Nothing.  Just seals and DE mats.  We could say we did it though!
---
Oh really? That's a shame. Is that because macros became more limited over time and the client is a fork from Legion?
---
If anyone ganked me on Nighthaven start as a paladin, it was very hard to lose. You have heals, resists and good autos. Just bring speed potions and you're good.
---
I'll give you credit where it's due; as much as WoD made me quit... I loved the Crit Dance you did as a Fire Mage. Nothing tickled my dopamine nodes like getting a string of free Pyroblasts that procced *more* free Pyroblasts.
---
Vanilla's more exciting to me because of real world PvP. No flying mounts. With engineering and trinkets, pots, etc, PvP we be incredibly nuanced and complex. Also, as far as we know, there's actually an end to the gearing process and not just unending hamster wheel gear grind.
---
I'm happy the new blood hates it already. I don't want to play with people younger than my account. They can stay in retail. I'm good with that.
---
But that's the thing: retail isn't going away. Retail isn't disappearing, they're still going to keep that running and keep making more expacs. Classic is entirely separate.
---
Fine, but I‚Äôm still a believer in your integrity is defined in how you treat people when no one is looking. And ripping people off behind the anonymity of a wow character is pretty scummy imo.
---
Also, auction house inflation, casinos and mail-scams with COD are all against tos. 
---
The only legit ideas here are the loan financing (good luck collecting) and the player protection services (been tried before)
---
Ill level to 50s then quit or make an alt. Not interested in playing against nolifers approaching 60.
---
If horde, Midnighters might be what you‚Äôre looking for!
---
You‚Äôre fine either way.  It really just gives you a different way to play if you get bored of a spec not including imp slam.
---
I have no idea if people do this normally as I don't keep up with pserver/vanilla trends, but I recently started a hunter on one and found that I killed VERY fast by alternating/juggling ranged and melee attacks.  On pservers (at least the one I played) it seems that swing timers for ranged and melee weapons are independent of each other.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's not like your other hunter shots do any damage while leveling if you're BM.   I was killing shit much faster with the ranged + melee method than purely ranged.
---
This is my thinking as well. I always see a lot of the 'Rose tinted glasses' argument, but most people I've seen super excited for Classic have played on P-Servers and know EXACTLY what it will be. I'm one of them - I love playing on Classic and TBC pServers because the game was just better imo.
---
If you're leveling a Priest you should consider planning your leveling around the wands that are available in the game because it's such a big portion of your damage.
---
Whether that means getting the earliest possible wand is up to you, but I will say that obtaining a wand will save you money and time in the short term.
---
Indeed it does. But I just don't get it. Afaik Slam is just a non-normalised attack + 87. And that 87 has to make up for the reset of the auto attack swing, and the 15 rage cost, and the delayed auto attack rage gain.
---
Add the self-root and Slam just doesn't seem that great.
---
Maybe you're right. Prior to this thread, I was leaning more toward the (Warrior/Hunter/Paladin) party.
---
Remember:
---
1) You mostly hear the people with the strongest opinions
---
2) Those who don't like retail will have unsubbed
---
Which means most of the folk on /r/wow that post about classic are the small really-strong-dislike group.
---
Derp yah
---
The hearth at the end got me lol
---
I was more referring to the layout and usability than the aesthetic, although finding a balance of the two is important if im going to stare at it for 100+ day /played
---
(TF2 Players *did* get mad about Overwatch)
---
Them being separate is the problems since you are splitting their playerbase. For TF2 with auto-matching this probably isn't as big a thing but with WoW where you need a competent team of 25+ people that'll show up at certain times every week... well that is an issue.
---
Timezones will be listed by geography. For example west coast USA and East coast USA. They arent really set to a timezone but for ping.
---
Thanks bro!
---
Out of curiosity, how much /played does it take you to leave your race's starting zone?
---
It's the mutual burnout peeking through.
---
* The auto attack doesn't "resume" after the Slam cast. It starts over from the beginning. At least that's what happens on &lt;undocumented server&gt;. Meaning a 1.1sec auto attack loss is MINIMUM. If Slam is used at the non-optimal time because of lag or human error, you can close A LOT more auto attack damage than 1.1sec. If you have a 3.8 speed weapon you can lose up to 3.7 sec auto attack if you're really laggy/dumb.

---
Str is not a hunter stat. So no str.
---
You only get 1 melee sp per str, same as agi
---
I only remember Mr Shout..
---
Sure, leave it with me I‚Äôll post it in a new thread.
---
My plan is to run every dungeon 2-3 times while leveling. I just really love the rpg feel of 5 random adventures going into a castle or a cave seeking fame and fortune.
---
Doesn't really matter what it is as long as it's teaching that you work for reward. My parents were very similar, just with vacuuming and dishes haha
---
While I will certainly gonna play WoW Classic pretty hardcore and have no problem with how others choose to play the game. I would say that the toxicity from "casuals" is a result of how toxic the hardcore community has been over several of years.
---
An example is how the hardcore community claims that everyone that doesn't choose the right class-race combination is a retard and is bad at the game.
---
It's because they are scared their game will have a total of 5 people sitting in SW because everyone runs off to spend 3 months leveling and then they will start gearing while the bfa players are still at 5 members sitting in SW.
---
lmao I forgot they named an area of Tanaris "Gaping Chasm."
---
My integrity is fine. I blew up Megaton in Fallout 3, yet, I saved the wasteland. Does that make me a monster irl? So what if I get gold and share it with my loyal guildmates? We just are using the systems in place. Want to compete against us? Great. Now that's some competition and all apart of the fun.
---
TOS violations are more subjective and with a large enough player base its a non-issue.
---
I don't ever remember any sizable amount of TF2 players getting "mad" about Overwatch.
---
&gt;Them being separate is the problems since you are splitting their playerbase.
---
...but their playerbases are already split. Vanilla players don't really retail, and retail players don't really play vanilla.
---
It just doesn't make sense for retail players to be angry over Classic. It's an entirely separate project that affects them in no way shape or form. It's purely "REEE STOP LIKING WHAT I DON'T LIKE" hate.
---
Clearly destiny isn't a hunter weapon... But to say raptor strike isn't used in pvp is wrong. You would literally raptor strike whenever people would deadzone you (Which happens all the time). They don't expect 2k crits from hunters in melee. I even picked up the 20 crit talent on raptor strike in survival.
---
&gt; and the thought that such a thing could hollow out their community makes them anxious.
---
Their community has been dead since mists. Guilds don't talk to each other anymore. Players haven't been making "random but natural" micro-encounters in the overworld since TBC. Wpvp officially died in Wrath. Competition over natural resources has vanished since garrisons and player controlled shard hopping.  
---
They don't have any gameplay reasons to form a community because everything in that version of the game has been changed to be completeable by a single player. It's a singleplayer rpg with thousands of strangers and nameless faces wearing pretty looking armor that was given to them for picking up turtles. The gameplay and experiences had with other players are hollow.
---
I'm probably going to have quite a few Alts. It'll let me switch up playstyles when one gets stale and I'll use them to help kit out my warrior so it isn't so difficult to level him. 
---
Depending on the status of the community on whatever PVE server I join I may just quit shortly after I get to 60. I want to see the raids but end-game isn't as interesting to me as the things that come directly before endgame to be honest. (I'm really looking forward to Blackrock Depths)
---
Yooooo Rep Oregon!!!!
---
This is something people new to Classic will soon learn. Yes, your PVE rotation and boss mechanics in general are more boring, but just about every other aspect of the world feels better.
---
Threat is not an issue until raiding. In low level five mans as long as you can hold aggro, it's fine. Absolutely no reason to not use a shield.
---
you just need a shield to get into groups, then u can swap it out for your offhand wep when nobody's looking
---
As I said above, it's not as efficient as 2h, but I prefer it. It's a preference, its not all about min-maxing.
---
Yeah - there weren't many; but then again in the grand scheme of things there aren't many retail players getting mad about classic.
---
It's going to be really nice to be able to have a game to go to where I can just log on and have something to do that won't take a bunch of effort like most competitive games I play.   
---
In retail unless I'm logging on to raid, I usually log on, sit in the city for  a couple of minutes contemplating doing world quests then just say 'fuck it' and log off.
---
You can be whoever you want, that‚Äôs what makes wow and rpgs great. But I still think it‚Äôs scummy to cod scam people or try and inflate AH prices. 
---
And how are tos violations non-issues?
---
8 mana Mind Control monkaS
---
While rogues are not really tanky, they are healable by even offspecs. Playing with any casters feels really good with all the rogue control. I really like leveling with priests, or any casters really. 
---
Cheap Shot into ranged buddy nuking is just great. Plus the peel is godlike for pvp. Mage/Rogue is an iconic pvp duo for a reason. Rogues can also pump out great single target if you can top them off after an opener.
---
&gt; It upsets me that they don't continuously update the original game world with each expansion and have the story and most of the gameplay taken place there. One of my biggest turn offs with modern WoW is how the world has effectively shrunk to 5-6 zones because theres nothing in 90% of the world for players to do.
---
Absolutely. WoW needs to get with the times and make the whole WORLD full of dynamic content. Other MMOs do this and it makes the world feel far more alive.
---
It's completely absurd that in an expac called "Battle for Azeroth", most of Azeroth is ignored while all the action takes place on 2 islands.
---
Incoming video from the twitch/youtube content creators with this doc as main source.  
---
Also, gj dude. You doing the real work.
---
There's a guild that wants to kill Rag before the first reset. Supposedly they have 300 members that will all be racing to 60.
---
Did you buy it or order it from somewhere?
---
&gt; but then again in the grand scheme of things there aren't many retail players getting mad 
---
Almost every Classic discussion forum has loads of people regurgitating the same anti-vanilla rhetoric in almost every thread. Go look on MMO-Champion, you'll be hard pressed to find a thread that DOESN'T have some form of anti-vanilla shitposting in it. There's plenty of people spamming and shitposting about how "*Classic sucks and it's all nostalgia and everyone who plays it is going to quit in X months after remembering how BAD the game is*", that kind of crap. Hence my original comment of being surprised about the sheer number of people emotionally disturbed by the existence of Classic.
---
As do you.
---
I will have 1 bank alt and 9 level 1 characters camped at limited recipe vendors - on a second account.
---
I'll play my main Pally on acct 1, and whenever I have 8 seconds to spare, move my attention to acct 2, log out, switch toons, check vendor, buy rare stuff.
---
It's like a cartel. but all on my own.
---
This cinematic gives me shivers everytime I watch it. Besides Ramin Djawadis work Nothing does that for me ever.

Raid times:

Tue a possible 3rd day if wanted/needed.

We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be ‚Äúpre-raid‚Äù raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

wtf i'm not excited for classic anymore
---
2h fury from 1 to 39, then MS beyond that
---
You totally echo my feelings in regards to this, specially when you mention that you would feel ‚Äúduped‚Äù and like it was all a ‚Äúwaste of time‚Äù yet again. This is PRECISELY how I felt back when TBC launched, and why I dropped WoW after WOTLK released.
---
I too will not sub unless Blizz confirms that this will not be the case - which I strongly suspect it will.
---
I do not understand people saying that they need more content in a game like WoW. Like if it wasn‚Äôt fucking ginormous already, right?  I often wonder if all the people here who claim to now be ‚Äúadults with jobs, families and responsibilities‚Äù actually grew up to be neckbeards who ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù at 15 playing WoW.
---
1sec to cast talented, slam was nerfed to shit in vanilla, fuck you Indalamar.
---
I never had an issue with TOS in the past and that was with Blizzard more staffed than they are now. They do not have the capabilities to be the in-game police anymore, the market for this is ripe. (just look at their loot trading policy it's bc they don't have the $$$ to deal with all those player tickets).  I'm not scamming people, it's just a way to control the price of a commodity. They will get the payment, COD just ensures I don't have stacks of mats entering the AH at prices my guild does not approve of, and again, I stress the guild as an operation like this takes a lot of time and player support.
---
Absofuckinglutely it will be.
---
Comments like this are what divide the community. We should all be rooting for the same thing, as I think they feed off each other, but someone always starts sh*t. I stopped playing BfA a few months ago, but want to see the game continue forever. But I‚Äôd be lying if I said that when I start to defend Classic (and my love for it) because someone makes a dumb comment, if it doesn‚Äôt start to turn me against retail, and I didn‚Äôt feel that way before the community started to divide.
---
And pearls
---
Do they know about private servers and how people go out of their way to play classic.
---
The guys name is literally ShitPoeStir. Just a troll thread, nothing to see here.

We're also talking about Team Fortress 2 VS. World of Warcraft. Team Fortress 2 didn't have 11+ millions players at its peak. Of course there are going to be more screeching howler monkeys who fly to the forums like the Wicked Witch of the West just rang the dinner bell.
---
Nice find!
---
The Legion Island wasn‚Äôt some ‚Äúnothing area‚Äù, lore wise it‚Äôs one of the most important historical areas of the game. It was the original home of the High Elves before the Sundering split Azeroth into two big continents and a couple big islands. Suramar City, the Dreamgrove &amp; Emerald Dream, a World Tree, and tons of Elven ruins are a large part of the landscape. It‚Äôs one of the most historical places in all of wow, second only to the troll empires.
---
One of your examples is an obvious joke and doesn‚Äôt even have anything to do with hardcore vs casual.
---
I hope us like-minded players start a guild, together the possibilities are endless.
---
Honestly, that sounds amazing :)
---
If you‚Äôre a good level and have good gear for your level 2h tanking dungeons can lead to very fast easy runs but you have to use your brain and judgement about whether it‚Äôs a good idea or not. Typically start with shield and if the healer is never going below 75% mana  and falling asleep you can try dps tanking.
---
Put in for my PTO and go hard on planning my leveling route
---
My birthday is in June so the money I'd get from birthday presents would last me until Christmas, and then Christmas would last me until my birthday again. So it worked out pretty well for 10 year old me.
---
I think 1.9, so it seems like 1.12 WoW Classic will have AHs in all major cities
---
Threat meter. Pretty hyped to play a game where tanking actually takes effort and threat is a thing to consider.
---
I don't know about that. Horde already has an disadvantage in raiding, and it gets even worse with all the pvp hybrid specs trying to sneak into raids. For example all the 30/0/21 shamans trying to get away with chain heal spamming with an suboptimal spec, so they can still burst in PvP. This results in Alliance having better gear overall, and they already have the stronger premades with Paladins especially. So as Horde, you kinda get forced into world PvP if you don't want to get farmed on battlegrounds which is why Horde is usually more active in WPvP than alliance.
---
A group of elite mobs hitting you hurts a lot for a low level warrior, the extra armour from the shield is worth it for sure imo.
---
Warrior, mage, paladin (or priest if horde).
---
That way you have a tank, healer and CC/portals for dungeons, and an insane PvP trio. Warrior and mage are basically the two best classes in vanilla, and paladin is the best PvP healer, followed by priest.
---
Is it just or me or do we all assume most of the players will be trash? Like in dungeons and pvp and such.
---
Ahhhh... back when the internet didn‚Äôt suck.
---
I hope they just turn it on one day to shittershatter the people meticulously planning out their speedruns.
---
I am kind of a dick though!
---
Talking to my friend that's been playing WoW since the beginning, there's a worry Classic will segregate the retail community. So I think that's where the lashing out against classic fans from retail fans stems from.
---
I can't explain the vice versa. It's probably coming from those that have quit retail more recently. For example, I haven't played since TBC so I can't hate on retail because I haven't experienced it.
---
If you wanna do a casino or give out loans then be my guest or take collections for protection in pvp be my guest. No harm in that at all. 
---
But We‚Äôre clearly on different levels of thinking on the other stuff. if your only reason for not committing crime is because you will get caught then your morales are fucked. 
---
And price inflation is scamming people. It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs against tos and why there are laws against it irl
---
I tanked to 40 while dual wielding. A good healer can probably reliably heal you to Sunken Temple while 2handing/dual wielding.
---
Gotta make deals my man. I mowed the lawn for free to keep my parents paying for my sub. Every weekend I was out there at 9am grinding for an hour and a half to keep that puppy subbed!

Players will definitely be impatient. Going ham with aoe and not waiting for sunder stacks will be common place until they learn I imagine.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to see!

You want a fast 1h weapon so you can spam Heroic Strike as much as possible. You will not be able to compete for threat on damage alone.
---
If there is a system in place where the faction pop is controlled close to 50:50, then in-theory no faction is able to dominate, at least to the extent that you're describing. On retail, a lot of the most popular PVP servers are more like 10:1 or 20:1, where the other faction doesn't even exist. And that's despite the cross-realm stuff.
---
Well, uhm, the server I play on has separate swing timers for autoshoot and melee attack, so I can shoot, go in melee, swing, go out of melee, shoot. It's a nice little damage boost, especially with slow weapons. I don't know if this is blizz like or not.
---
Destiny got looted in this debate
---
While I don‚Äôt agree with the post in any way, shape, or form, you do have to consider the amount of ‚Äúretail jabs‚Äù received from this subreddit, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely out of line for a retail subreddit to take jabs at Classic.
---
They better tell us soon! Haha

Yeah but it kinda died down especially with the lack of updates and overall lackluster skins and such.

There didn't use to be an FP in Un'Goro Crater at Marshal's Refuge, if that's what you're talking about. You'd have to literally run/ride there from Gadgetzan. Most of the rogues I knew would just go the the lowest part of the cliff and ride off from there with fall reduction spec and their level 50 (52?) quest cloak equipped. You could get to the bottom a hell of a lot faster than the ramp and only sacrifice about 2/3 of your HP.
---
&gt;But yeah, when I was in middle school, if anybody knew you played WoW, you'd get a lot of shit for it.
---
All the way through high school
---
Just because you can use it in a super memey way to kill low level mobs doesn't mean it's good for Hunters.
---
I see people spewing nonsense about retail WoW on this sub all the time too. I dont know why some people feel the need to shit on the other game. They are very different at this point, if you dont enjoy one of them, dont play it. Neither of is objectively better or worse.
---
Level in Ret, finish your 55-60 in prot in EPL with giant mobs of undead, swap back to Holy at 60.
---
Can you give the link plz?
---
As all things should be.
---
We pride ourselves on killing Alliance rather than dragons.
---
I believe Slam only interrupts your auto attack swing if it occurs during the last .5 sec of the attack timer. If you slam any other time, you're fine. Same goes for any melee ability.
---
Honestly it's not THAT much slower compared to retail.
---
thats a lie and you know it 
---
didnt they recently make peveling harder too?
---
I'm gonna try and drag some of them in with me. Gonna really try.
---
Cyberpunk 2077, Elder Scrolls 6, and Ori and the Will of the Wisps
---
This is me, mostly due to IRL circumstances.  
---
  
---
I‚Äôm already prepared for it to take me 2+ years to get to 60...
---
My two friends are going paladin and mage, and I'm trying to decide what to play with them. Warrior and rogue are the only ones I'm dead set against. I'm thinking druid or priest probably.
---
So much wrong advice in this thread.
---
Step 1)  Cast Distract to face the pack of mobs away.
---
Step 2) Get as far back from the mob as possible but still within sap range. 
---
Step 3) Sap, and immediately run to the tank so he can grab threat from the other non sapped mobs.
---
Easy mode.
---
We need to start a death squad to take these guys out and slow their race to 60. The triggering would be real
---
To add to this, after one week of gearing, you'll likely not have many enchants. Prioritize the important, yet easy ones like run speed or flat stat increases for main stats (str, stam, int, agi). I would never waste time on +4 all stats when I'm trying to gear up for raids, and I imagine most melee will go into MC without Crusader.
---
The gameplay in vanilla sounds very straightforward and more easy than today‚Äôs (I‚Äôve never played it so I dunno). And the bosses sound mostly easy mechanics wise.
---
The reason classic is better isn‚Äôt because of that; it‚Äôs because of the community.
---
If you have today‚Äôs WoW community, took away its catchup mechanics, removed sharping and cross server. You‚Äôd have the best game on the entire market.
---
8mana pyroblast, 5mana blizzard, iceblock... Nah I'm good
---
&gt; MC and Ony will be cleared with everyone in mostly greens to start with. 
---
Unless you're currently raiding on private server, this is not the case.
---
This is much more dependent on your group. I‚Äôd have a shield and 1h in my bag in case it‚Äôs needed
---
So, steamwheedle cartel and argent dawn?
---
People didn't like that they redid old areas, effectively changing them forever. Just think of it this way. Players that got into WoW after 2010 never got to see and play the original version of those areas. It will only be with the release of Classic, 9 years later, that people will actually be able to experience the most iconic zones in WoW as they were during the game's first 6 years.
---
Yeah, I actually want to take my time and enjoy the game.
---
What now atheists?
---
71 here. My dwarf priest will be named geezer (if I can get it). Been playing continuously since Jan 2005
---
Blocking reduces a flat amount of damage. Say 100/block. Adds up really fast when fighting multiple enemies. So does shield spike/skullflame damage.
---
Should always use a weapon swapping macro.
---
I mean i'm gonna be speed leveling a fair bit but once i'm past 40 or so its all casual leveling and raiding, taking the time is the best, NGL I also kinda suck
---
I didn't say they were better than Tauren, I think it is pretty well known Tauren is best.
---
Yes berserking does help, but has to be pre-empted which isn't always possible/achieved. Having WotF is a very nice backup for Undead warriors, who then have 2 fear breaks. Being horde there is no fear ward, only shaman can place tremor totem which is pulsing (i.e. crap).
---
Orc is situational/luck based and is only a minor benefit. Good for PvP.
---
Troll had already been responded by someone else with threat generation.
---
Tauren is the best for min-maxing, there is no doubt (I would play one). That does not mean 100% of horde prot warriors will be Tauren, people have preferences or different playstyles. I was helping to highlight some benefits of playing the other races.
---
If you‚Äôre going combat daggers for PvE, roll NE if you want.  NE is also arguably better for PvP because they‚Äôre harder to detect.
---
If you‚Äôre going combat swords, human is so much better.  I rolled NE in Classic and I deeply regretted it because I knew I could have done 3-5% more damage for FREE.  Human females also are thicc and have giant weapons.
---
Slam resets the auto attack swing. If you use Slam multiple times in a row, you literally never auto attack. You can test this pretty easily simply by building up 100 rage and then spending it on multiple Slams in a row before an auto attack ever hits. (I know this isn't proper rotation, it's just to illustrate the principle that using Slam means less auto attack damage.)
---
Anyway, I see now that perhaps it was folly to ask such a relatively technical question in "Simple Questions".
---
The what? cmonbruh
---
90% of what I'm looking forward to is just experiencing it all. So I'm just gonna do.... whatever. Some days I'll quest and grind a lot. Some days I'll spend 5 hours fishing and talking in guild chat. Some days I'll PvP and hunt down the scum [[opposite faction here, imma double agent]]. Some days I'll push some raids. 
---
And I'll be damned if the fishing isn't the most fun one of em.
---
Buy a token on retail WoW. They share a sub.
---
My idea was to farm gold on Classic to buy the token instead of farming the gold on retail.
---
You pretty much get 1000 mana per minute on alliance then on horde. Even on progression I didn‚Äôt use that many mana potions as alli, while as horde most people had to farm demonic runes and use wizard oil to avoid going oom. FD drink doesn‚Äôt fly for most guilds nowadays.
---
Full bloodfang is fine for pvp
---
Epics felt epic. Not like modern wow.
---
Vanilla hearthstone is after release, not during beta.
---
Traveling in classic is a MASSIVE reason the game felt so great back then. Its not mundane, its incredibly important because the long travels and constant travels really played into how they wanted leveling to feel like a real journey. A real adventure. They dont have that same philosophy now.
---
it is, but in a discussion about "hunter weapons" and hunters taking weapons (especially nice melee 2h) which would benefit other classes MUCH MORE than they benefit the hunter, anything with STR should be a greed/pass. 
---
Hunters should roll on items with agility, attack power, and/or crit. Ash'khandi is a classic example. It's good for warriors and paladins, but because it has raw AP instead of STR, it's also good for hunters. For all classes that can use it, it's much more of a PvP item than a PvE item anyway.
---
I can't say with certainty but I'm pretty sure there's a way for a macro to work
---
Hmm. I thought jokes were supposed to have some semblance of humor
---
That‚Äôs a fact. Remove catchup and it would feel way nicer. And remove lfg or make it meaningless. And remove lfr, who actually plays lfr??? I haven‚Äôt done a single lfr run since MoP
---
Yeah if you're a Warcraft Historian it may be exciting but if you're just someone who's played the games this place is mentioned once or twice before it comes into the expansion. Its hardly important at all to most players who are likely much more attached to places they've spent a lot of time in
---
You should always carry a shield for shieldwall and shield bash if nothing else, but generally you can get away with 2h tanking in defensive stance most of the time even at 60.  Jut be ready to toss that that shield if you get too many mobs or are fighting a hard hitting boss.  
---
I spent 70% of my time tanking with 2h with my warrior in vanilla.  Made most instance runs faster and it's kind of fun deciding when it's time to toss the shield on.
---
Yes but when they sent the last replacement card after my old one expired it didn't have the wow art on it any more, just a plain generic striped gray pattern.
---
According to this guide, goblin sapper charge does not require goblin engineering to craft?  This goes against everyone in THIS thread saying goblin engineering is required to make sapper charges?!  I don‚Äôt understand anymore
---
No I'm not. I'm pointing at your pointing, It's different! xD
---
Yeah I used ElvUI from Cata to Legion (when I gave up on modern WoW) and I will very much not be using anything big like that.
---
Just tweaks. Movable frames, dps and threat stuff that I can easily hide. Some other stuff that won't be up on the screen all the time. I want the old UI feel again
---
While you‚Äôre correct, if you Slam once immediately following a auto attack it will not interrupt your attack timer. Try installing a swing timer and testing this. Apparently you‚Äôd rather be condescending than use coherent thought.
---
Bump to this. I am Funnyman, you can message me on reddit too if you have any questions.

---
The swifty in-combat charge macro may not work. Nor will the borderline exploitive auto wsg flag pickup macro. 
---
Both of which I suppose im fine with.
---
But there is some core class macros that are less exploitive that vanilla macros can do that they may not in classic.

"if vanilla requires a separate sub then dont forget to keep your retail sub also, even if you dont play it much or at all. if retail wow collapses then vanilla will too"
---
I'd like to see some type of expansion similar to the balancing and class abilities given in tbc but without the QoL changes that expansion introduced (flying mounts are also a QoL change). A lot of the class changes introduced in tbc would have otherwise been introduced in vanilla. 
---
I'd like to see the new expansion set in azeroth to keep player activity local.
---
can you add alternatives for each slot? some of these items are very hard to obtain.
---
Don't forget the racial advantages, Undead will of the forsaken, orc stun resist etc, in pvp it matters.
---
4 max deeps wear cloth, moar rage.
---
Absolutely. Go try and kill the last boss in Wailing Caverns. He hit me for 250 and crits for 500. I was a warrior with all my talent points in defensive at level 23, using good early game dungeon gear and the blue shield from Kresh the turtle. 
---
To put that in perspective, I had 900 hp unbuffed. That fight was gruesome.
---
why?

Werever i am out in public or at work. Im going to let out the loudest scream heard to mankind.

There's an item you can loot off of pirates (I think) and it starts a quest that speaks of a treasure buried at Land's End Beach. If you go there you can find some broken ship parts and interacting with it starts a fight with five pirates. You can loot a key from them to open the chest nearby. 
---
Aside from that there's only turtles
---
You should try to run instance with a tank, you can 2h 100% of the time.
---
A two-handed axe gives you rage like candy, especially DPS specced with all the crits. You really gotta work for it with a small 1h sword.
---
It‚Äôs best done weaving through your stances though, not like you won‚Äôt use defense stance if you don‚Äôt have a shield on.
---
Sure, but then you don't get nearly as much rage for DPS.  It's always fun being #1 on the damage meters as a tank and getting the instance done about 30% faster.
---
Spot on.  Don't forget world bosses in between all of that.  But having Spirit of zandalar and dragonslayer buffs every week for tough progression can give an important boost
---

Yeah, with 1.12 stats on gear, there's really not going to be much of a difference. People act like it's going to be some major change in the game's balance, but, uh...a mage having 40 more spell damage or a warrior having 2% more crit chance isn't going to make some gigantic change to clear speeds.

Even with 1.2 itemization on everything, Rag still went down super fast on private servers.

Azshara was probably the zone i went to the least (tied with silithus, maybe) from the time i started in Wrath until the Cataclysm, and it kind of regret not getting to know it better.  It was a 'useless' zone for me (few quests, didnt spend as much time in Kalimdor, etc),  but i do remember it being very beautiful.
---
Fucking Goblins ruin everything.
---
Man, im looking forward to seeing Thousand Needles again.  It wasnt really my favorite zone at the time, but the salt flats were pretty neat.

---
Hi, /u/pichmeister
---
&gt;DPS specced with all the crits
---
You mean cruelty?  Any spec can get that, it's a tier 1 talent.
---
I think it could have maybe used a questing makeover, but it didnt need the radical scenery/lore makeover imo.
---
Damn, I saw a video where some dudes leveled to 100 in like 3 hours played or something.
---
I agree that the mechanics are easier, but keep in mind that no matter how difficult they make the mechanics in retail, people break it down to a science. It's not really like the players are having to improvise and critically think during the encounters - more just watching for cues and following directions based on guides that have been fleshed out on PTR. Thus the only challenge really in terms of fight mechanics is getting enough people to not make mistakes. I'm trivializing a bit, but you get the point. So while in some ways raids are more enjoyable in retail (mechanics, DPS rotations), this is not a make or break element of the game.
---
But also, I think you're missing some of what makes Vanilla good. Community, catchup mechanics, sharding, cross server, yes, but there are MANY more elements that make Vanilla a lot more enjoyable for a lot of people. Some of these things may not apply to you, but they apply to others. 
---
For me personally, one of the things I loved about Vanilla is the flow of PVP combat. I liked that it was more of a rock/paper/scissors game with completely lopsided matchups that made spacing and positioning so critical.
---
Idk... I still have plenty of guild chats, random encounters, and world pop. I'm aggressively social, so I guess that might be why.
---
I enjoyed those quests the first time, but theres not many of the new ones i like after playing through the content many, many, many times.
---
I'm surprised literally no one has pointed out that Stranglethorn Vale has a typo and says "Stranglehorn Vale".
---
Haha what ? My friend had over 400 days on his Warrior in vanilla, he was still bad.   
---
You cant really mean that because you spend time in a game you will be good, some people are good without spending tons of time into stuff.  And some people spend many many hours into stuff and still cant reach the "upper tier".  
---
Knowing mechanics are not something that makes you Good/Skilled, when i was playing vanilla, my 5 year old sister was decursing lucifron. Because she thought it was fun to see the names disapear.

TFW your 5 dollar headset from 2005 still works and the 4-5 $200 headsets you've bought since then all fail within a year.

From lurking through a few Reddit‚Äôs the general consensus is that mining and blacksmithing isn‚Äôt the greatest for warrior. My question is why is bs not great for money making ? Do some rare patterns not sell well on the AH?
---
It‚Äôs hard to imagine them investing in new content that takes way longer to make and costs way more than just doing tbc which is basically done and they‚Äôve already streamlined the process of putting old content in a new engine with Classic. It would be cool to see but the business case of just pushing out TBC Classic will be very enticing if Vanilla Classic is a success.

If you read some of the old lore books, orc warlock makes much more sense. Also in pvp orc stun resist is great. Aaaannnddd orc looks better in gear but that‚Äôs just my opinion.

Here's somethin I haven't seen discussed. How capable are paladins of tanking 5 mans/spire at 60 without going too far into the prot tree? If I wanted to tank my way through 5 mans to get the gear I needed to be ready to heal raids, how much would I need to commit to the prot tree to do it just decently? Could I even just keep whatever talents I already have and just sword and board it up with mediocre plate gear or do I need to change my spec to do it?

4 hours of sleep (or less if a warrior), with your waking hours spent--likely in the dark--sitting immobile and probably eating shitty food and not enough water is not good for you.

Whether it kills you or not is probably down to how unhealthy your lifestyle was prior.
---
If you don't have a group going with an established plan by now you're already at the bottom of the pyramid my dude

It's not even an RPG anymore.  It's an MMORNG at best. It's a giant dress-up and mount collection simulatior.
---
If you have a mage for the very reliable CC and good damage, plus infinite food for everyone, it's doable.  But it will take awhile.  Better XP though probably, if you're all well geared you will probably go maybe 20-30% slower than a group of 5 BUT you will all get what, 80% more xp?
---
Do we know if there will be weekly raid lockouts, like in retail?
---
We of previous expansions and WoW design lost our favourite games through the replacement expansion design of Blizzard. BfA/retail players likely see the imminent risk of losing theirs if and when Blizzard on a whim adopts new gameplay elements and inevitably changes what is today retail, as they should I reckon.
---
WoW is in actuality a series of several games, each expansion on its own let alone patches can be considered separate games people love and prefer over the other versions. It's not very difficult to understand that and all sides in this have legitimate arguments, if you genuinely want to understand.
---
I personally just want my WoW back and it seems like I will get exactly that, Very Soon‚Ñ¢. I don't give a flying murloc about what retail does anymore because of this. But if there's a topic about it I'll gladly expand on what I find problematic in especially WotLK+ expansions, flying mounts and the like.
---
I can respect that, I‚Äôm super hyped for classic for mostly the community aspect.
---
enhance/feral/warrior is good, limited cc but the damage and healing is good. 2xlock/spriest, so much cc it's hilarious, you could probably 3v9.
---
So is Sen'jin.
---
This was the example you chose? Really?
---
You chose to compare a lvl 53 blue to a BWL epic? Really?
---
"Big slow 2h" is just another way of saying a 2h with fat damage. It's not that complicated. I swear you guys take everything *so fucking literally*. I'm not even the OP but the fact that you are arguing semantics like this is so fucking dumb.
---
Funny how I'm not lying, though.
---
Bro how is it possible to have that many posts removed lmao
---
lol that murlock was vael for lowbies.  That other one hit hard too, the shambling mound thing.
---
Ouch, just realized you're part of the filthy alliance...
---
Negative. We‚Äôre rolling horde!
---
Our GM is rolling an undead priest.
---
What are the top dps classes in vanilla
---
Merging is fine, whatever brings about balance so people can enjoy the game the way it should have been, balanced. But "communities" like on my Server are pretty much non exisitant so almost anything would be better.  But my server is still high pop.... because everyone is on the other faction. It was not like that when I rerolled there years ago; the server was full and almost 50/50 faction.
---
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  And you know what, on second thought...considering how WoW single-handedly redefined the genre, or at least it feels that way, it's fair to say that WoW culture can overwrite what came before.  Even FFXIV officially uses the term DPS, with even the Japanese devs saying the letters in English; hell, they even say "enrage" in English even though that mechanic was changed to Berserk in WoW many, many years ago.
---
I'm just one of those weird people that thinks, "But DPS is like MPH, not a noun!!!"  But yeah, I know it doesn't really matter and I should get used to it. :P
---
Because they're no-lifing a dead game and they're doing it harder than people did when it was alive.
---
yeah its not like vanilla wow had a quest where you bring a dwarf stuck in an outhouse toilet paper or anything like that
---
Yeah the amount of gold in the economy is going to be very low for the first few months, so I doubt anyone besides Warlocks and Paladins will have their epic mounts before month 3 (that is unless people are more insane than I give them credit and just farm gold off mobs for weeks on end).
---
My (wo)man! Since you're looking for healers, then I may very well roll undead priest as well. It was my main for most expansions until druids got cool.
---
I like the tidbit about lore, very interesting. I haven't heard much praise of the orc stun resist; how do you think it compares to the unedeads Will of the forsaken? Also, I always thought undead warlocks looked the best :P
---
I played DAOC prior and that was it. Was in the Marines, Deployed to Iraq in 04, got back Sept 04, Medic I knew was playing it and I was like wtf is warcraft. 1 hour later I was hooked and have played since then.
---
Simply efficient
---
&gt;Well; consider the following.
---
That's a very adventurous use of a semicolon.
---
You see the discord link? Definitely check it out. Ask our GM any questions you have, he‚Äôs incredible and loves to help
---
My parents never bought me a single video game, ever. To buy my first nintendo (NES), around 10 years old, I mowed lawns during summer and shovelled driveways during winter around my neighbourhood to put together around $250 bucks.  I think I charged $10 for the lawns, $5 for the driveways. 
---
I went to Canadian Tire and came back home with the NES, two controllers, light gun and the Super Mario Bros. Duck Hunt combo. 
---
To put this in perspective, they still had Super Mario Bros. in my local arcade. That was how badass it was to have NES in my living room at the time. 
---
I continued on to buy a SNES, Genesis, Sega CD, Gamecube, PS1-4. 
---
I‚Äôve been a self made gamer from day one. 
---
So yeah. Mow lawns. Play games. High five, bro.
---
They will not be in classic mate
---
Well wotf is on a 2 minute cooldown. So In a 20 minute BG you can use it a MAX of 10 times to break a fear.
---
Orc stun resist is 25%. So every 4 stuns you can resist one (roughly). You are fighting say 10 people in a WSG, each with 2+ stuns on say a 30 second timer. That‚Äôs 20 stuns on 30 seconds, 40 stuns a minute, max 800 stuns in a 20 minute bg. You resist 1/4 that‚Äôs 200. Now I know this is a stretch but say you resisted even 50 stuns in a 20 min match.
---
It‚Äôs always gonna be preference but for the amount of rogues you‚Äôre going to fight compared to the amount of alliance warlocks....I‚Äôd go orc.
---
&gt;I think I could accept something like sharding contested zones of heavily biased PvP realms
---
&gt;That's a lot of downvotes without a reason given
---
Hmm...
---
I would also like the introduction of the Monk Class in Vanilla
---
Very insightful! After this I am heavily inclined to go Orc, however, I believe I heard wotf can be useful in raids as well? Is this true, and if so, is it even noteworthy?
---
GM island is missing, spot on otherwise lol
---
Oh, huh, perfect!  Interesting that Thunder Clap does that kind of threat, assuming this page is correct.  I thought the application of any debuff was the same amount of threat no matter what it was, but I guess not.
---
If you subtract the damage max rank Thunder Clap does (103), its debuff does 77 threat.  Meanwhile, max rank Demoralizing Shout does 43 threat (64 after Defensive Stance+Defiance).  And max rank Demoralizing Roar does 39 threat, with the only difference being it reduces AP by 10 less.
---
So apparently some abilities' threat scale with their potency in some way even if they don't do damage.  I could never quite tell for sure if that was happening back then.
---
Also, the writer of this does seem knowledgable.  That description in the Taunt section of how someone can be above you in threat without pulling aggro yet Taunt still won't match their threat amount is actually great to know!
---
However, there are a couple very minor errors that I'd like to correct, just in case you have any hand in managing this website:
---
Rogues and Cat Form passively do 29% less threa/0.71x modifier, not 20% less threat/0.8x modifier as shown here:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?spell=3025
---
http://classicdb.ch/?spell=21184
---
Yup 100% I not raiding at all, (wife, kid full time job and other commitments)  I have got myself a fairly casual goal for my classic wow endgame. Getting dungeon 0 and then if I'm still around 0.5 when its released.
---
My plan is to maybe put in an hour a night or so and then maybe 2-3 hours on weekend till I hit 60, then hopefully lock in a dungeon night with my mates and yeah see where we go.
---

rmp is a tbc meme. there was nothing particularly great about it in vanilla.
---
Did you write this while afk following in raid finder?
---
Why just worgen? Why don't we add pandas too?
---
You're an asshole. I dont want to accidentally see you in game
---
You destroyed him
---
Maybe it's a reaction to a few hardcore players that had shown a lot of toxicity to casuals? But despite your examples, it feels like serious toxicity is not as prevalent as other threads, so it's just "some people being mean", not like a majority thing.
---
I don't think there is a best aside from anything with a healer in there. There's just so many good possible combos.
---
yeah if you were standing 2 or (i think 3) you would still make slow progress in r13 towards 14 after the change.
---
The system was a bit bonkers before the change, so its good they mended it. 
---
Still we go from maybe 1 a week to maybe 2 a week, but really just guaranteeing our 1 a week. Eitherway, its not the 52-104 people per server per year who get R14. Its the thousands per server who have little incentive to play after they hit R6-10 and will not see upgrades but for a few slots in ZG/AQ20 as they wont do 40m raiding beyond MC/Ony.
---
May card got closed for inactivity long long ago.
---
Why does a hunter want a slow 2h?
---
We don't have any instant weapon damage skills. Mongoose bite, raptor and counterstrike all have static damage.
---
No reason to favor slower 2h.
---
Yes. They are in Duskwood.  
---
Bring a friend, they are brutal.
---
Frost has better mana conservation than fire though lol
---
*sarcasm* ‚ÄúDangit. I guess I just bought a brand-new laptop for nothing.
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
not our fault they are still playing a game that died 3 xpacs ago
---
vanilla will outgrow retail and i think will be the standard within 2 years
---
you can quote me
---
As soon as "hardcorers" hit 60 and start geraing/raiding, a timer within Blizzard is set. "We need to provide new content soon as ppl will get bored with what they have now". Worst case, this will lead to hardcorers covering the content with guides so fast, Blizzard have to release new content and eventually expansion before some casuals even hit 60, not speaking about trying endgame.
---
i lost all interest in wow past wrath
---
cant wait for classic
---
I never hated flying mounts but I do hate what the game has devolved into which is a game where no one talks there‚Äôs no need to work together in any of th casually accessible parts of the game. Which is the opposite of vanilla where your whispering people hey invite me so we can all 5 tag this one quest mob with a 5-10m respawn timer. Or you know actually having to coordinate a bit in a base level dungeon using cc etc.
---
I hope. 
---
I‚Äôm a lay-back guy myself. I hate sitting on a chair cuz I did it everyday at work! 
---
Im sure its not against the terms of services, I used a Logitech Wired Gamepad all throughout Legion as a casual.
---
This is the real use of distract.
---
What about the gnomish mind control cap?
---
R10 gear is incredible for a hunter and easy to achieve on your own. Hunters can be extremely successful in pvp with little to no raid gear.
---
The popularity of the post seems to suggest that it did.
---
Bruh the fuckin fwars will always roll on tank gear, even though they dont tank. 
---
Kills me.
---
It's a mix of nostalgia and heavy disinterest in the way the current version of the game works. Modern WoW is less like an MMORPG and more like a 3rd person shooter lobby game with some light RPG elements to it.
---
Vanilla appeals more to me because it's a much more social game, and there's just the right amount of....struggle? hardship? I don't know what to call it, but it has just enough bullshit to feel like a challenge, but not so much bullshit that it's frustrating. Just the right ratio of fun to bullshit, to make it feel rewarding to succeed. It's that bit of "hardship" that just kinda makes the game rewarding and interesting, if that makes sense.
---
Whenever I had a rogues sapping I would try and time my bow pull to go off as close to the same time letting me pull aggro on one of the remaining guys but sometimes I‚Äôd just be ready to charge in and taunt and tab target a quick sunder.
---
What makes what I said an asshole thing to say?
---
Possibly. But I feel like Blizzard is very choosy with their words. They wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be having a Classic summer‚Äù with less than a month of the game being out in summer. Just as well, it makes good sense to launch the game in summer, when kids are off from school and can nag their parents for a sub. 
---
On top of that, I don‚Äôt think Blizzard sees Classic as a top tier product. In their earnings call, the only mention of Classic didn‚Äôt even call it by it‚Äôs name. It was simply one of a few new titles that will generate additional revenue. So, I don‚Äôt think they plan on giving it a super long winded hype-up period. Just as well, there are private servers, and if they announce too far ahead, they might draw more people in to private servers to see what the buzz is for free.
---
But I understand I‚Äôm biased af and am only thinking wishfully. I still think a July 16-Aug 6 is the most likely period. And with a 2 month-advance announcement, we‚Äôre stull cleared for July 16 until may 16 comes and goes.
---
Yeah you'll just need third party software to bind keyboard keys and mouse movement to the controller. Can't really help you there though, I haven't done that in years.
---
Any time somebody mentions something that isn‚Äôt simply Classic&gt;tbc&gt;Wrath, it‚Äôs a super convoluted tangle of ideas that make Vanilla even better yet will probably make it worse. Let‚Äôs add 3 raids and 10 dungeons, arenas, class balance so every spec is more viable. I‚Äôm not saying Vanilla is perfect, but it‚Äôs a lot better than it would be with all of that.
---
Or we could just go with Classic&gt;tbc&gt;Wrath, you know, the games that already exist and people want to play.
---
Thanks, can I also link an other action to it like jumping ? So every time I press space, I jump and change tracking ?
---
Welcome to r/classicwow
---
raid finder is actually super cool only u vanilla fgs have to always hatin for no reason
---
Exactly. TBC and Wrath will be even easier for Blizzard to reproduce from a technical standpoint. It makes no sense for them not to.
---
i dont like pandas much but if ppl like em im fine with it
---
thats too much bro
---
$10/hr in 2004 isnt too bad.
---
hahhaa ur funny
---
Just a little hint for anyone who might struggle with him in the future.
---
He's slow and very kite-able. 
---
Clear out all the raptors outside of his room and have your range dps kite him around the bridges. Just don't get too close to him as he has AoE stun
---
Sure you can pick that Mageroyal.  It'll be fine.  It looks safe...
---
Son of Arugal in Silverpine Forest.

Same man, I'll do my best to camp as many tourists as possible when classic launches in hopes of making them quit the game.

well im going to sleep gl guys one day you will have atleast half of my iq hahah
---
Here's a tip, blood rage generates 100 unmod. threat an all mobs. 125 unmod. if you have imp. blood rage.
---
Nice assuming kid
---
Steak is best cooked fast. You enjoy your mid-well filet.
---
Yeh. I still prefer to use it near the end of pulls and keep my rage pool higher during drinking so I can start the next fight with enough to work with. Granted I didn‚Äôt have my charge and defensive stance macroed so I rarely charged in leveling dungeons even with anger management.
---
&gt; my guildies have taken to calling me The Ravager
---
*Doubt*
---
Also.. it's 2019, buy a fucking microphone.
---
Oh boy, you would be so fun to corpse camp.  
---
People like you are the reason it exists, the reactions... :p
---
I'm thinking about making a human priest, are there any leveling guides and builds you recommend?
---
Do people honestly think classic is hard? Not saying retail is but...seriously?
---
Geek culture &amp; Wow defining their identities, Epic Gamer Cynicism and crippling insecurity
---
I can't tell you how many times this has happened to me on so many classes at every bracket of leveling... As much as i can't stand it i can't wait for noob hunters to take my gear because... everything is a hunter weapon.
---
"so much wrong info..." whilst literally repeating the same thing everyone else has said and nothing else.
---
Blizzard need to relaunch a classic style website like this.... Would be so nostalgic!
---
Depends on what's agreed before the run
---
About 8 hours\~ XD
---
I see.  What are you going to spend that rage on?  Something that generates threat?
---
First time I've noticed the typo in the map: "Hillsbrad Foolhills"
---
No different than classic circle jerkers saying retail shitty because *"Insert reasons related to modern generation, kids, instant gratification, accessibility, snowflakes"*
---
I visited and saw the shaman channel. This gal's a pally.
---
The analogy was about consuming content, not preparing it. The players do not prepare the content, they consume it. If you have issues with cooking then you need to take that up with the developers.
---
Regardless, there are many that have tasted sous vide that would disagree with your perspective on cooking a steak quickly.
---
Unless you do 100% of your leveling together, than paladin will want to be rolling on the same gear as your warrior. And the hunter will need to restrict themselves to not out level you. That was my experience doing a 5man leveling group with hunter, priest, mage, paladin and warrior.
---
Sounds like retail wow is for you!
---
You will def not be spamming heroic strike in low level 5 mans.
---
You won't have the rage to, but besides that Revenge and Sunder are better threat options.
---
A fast weapon is still preferred for rage generation.
---
This is a thing currently available in retail and works surprisingly well it's feels awkward at first but for things such as mob grinding it's fantastic.
---
Because Classic fans haven't been able to play the version of the game they love the most for 10+ years. And the entire time they've been ridiculed for wanting it. Being told they think they do but they don't by both Blizzard and smug forum cretins who love mocking people who enjoy different things than they do.
---
All three features will be available in Classic. :)
---
For peak nostalgia scour computer repair shops &amp; craigslist for a Pentium 4.

There's a difference between giving your opinion on a game, and constantly shitposting about a game that's not even out yet, proclaiming that nobody will enjoy it and it will be dead in X months.
---
Dunno, a guildie on Arthas-US has Bill as his priest's name.
---
Well, as long as you're having fun I guess?
---
Dude... i watched him and he only has good dps cause he has pummelers and only can sustain decent dps with those up... If a class relies on having tons of a single item... Thats not good.
---
That one guy that just farms all day. Every day, for the entire duration of Classic.
---
It's something I truly enjoy. Not farming dungeons, just farming in open world. I know there are others like me
---
Actually, if he mowed every weekend it would have only been $2.50/hr. Assuming an average month having 4 weekends.
---
Eh, more like $2.50ish, he said every weekend, so 4 times per month, 6 hours, $15.
---
I really hope weaksuras will be added.
---
Would really like a currency tab instead of using a bag slot. Gonna spend shit loads of gold on respec, so dual spec (will never happen). Area loot. Balance, would love people to play whatever class or spec they want. Basically nothing that affects gameplay, but is annoying for no reason.
---
Iirc, doing /create World would create a chat channel called world. If people /join World, it would be exactly what pservers have now.
---
There will be a world chat
---
You can actually set it up with steam controller if you have that, I've done it and it can work pretty well, albeit a little awkward.  Using the input pads you can actually get quite a bit of real estate for mappings.
---
As always, success in PvP, when it comes to subpar gear, means you have to compensate for that with increased skill.
---
You'd have to be pretty staunchly anti social to download 100 gigs worth of game just to rile people up.
---
...I could totally see that happening actually.
---
1. Heroic Strike and Sunder Armor cost the same amount of rage, so if you don't have enough rage to spam HS then you don't have enough to spam SA
---
2. HS causes more threat than SA. SA did not scale with AP until WoTLK
---
3. Sunder only stacks 3 times, if you continue to spam SA after that then you are wasting rage.
---
4. SA on an off target does nothing beneficial since no one is attacking it, you are better off getting more threat by using HS.
---
I don't think anyone is advocating rolling need over a melee class, just the idea that a hunter should never roll on such a weapon, and that we should shun any who do.
---
I agree with everything, until you equated TBC to Vanilla as 'Glory Days' xD
---
TBC was doodoo.  That is all.
---

---
Hi, /u/Onre405
---
The idea being that you want to do so much damage in a single attack as possible before immediately getting back out of range. You aren't standing still trading hits.
---
Totally feasible! But, in order to handle the large quantity of abilities/keybinds, you MUST use something like Steam to expand the capabilities of the controller.
---
Steam opens up a ton of controller semantics that make controlling a WoW character to its fullest. Common abilities, say Hamstring, get a simple binding: press the A button maybe. You‚Äôll quickly run out of simple keybinds like that, so the more esoteric abilities are bound to alternate inputs: holding the A button for 1.5 seconds might cast Piercing Howl, or double-tapping the A button might cast Thunderclap. There‚Äôs really a wide variety of capabilities; you can even load and unload entire sets of bindings (eg, pressing Start changes all the keybinds to something convenient for the auction house or crafting).
---
It takes a long time to settle into the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù setup, but with WoWs macro systems and the Steam binding capabilities classes like Warrior, Warlock, Hunter, and Rogue are certainly playable in even a raid setting. Healing would be doable I think, but I‚Äôd recommend getting a Steam controller since it does a decent job of acting like a mouse. A dual shock or similar controller just doesn‚Äôt cut it. I‚Äôd recommend the Steam controller for WoW especially, since you can‚Äôt always rely on tab targeting and it‚Äôs ability to emulate mouse behavior is a great advantage.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt expect to be great at PvP using a controller, but you won‚Äôt be totally useless either.
---
Still, theres a lot of shit posts about why retails sucks and how classic will be our savior...
---
Trick question, it played automatically when you first launched the game.
---
Sap doesn't cause aggro though right? Any damage the tank does should take them off you instantly right? Tbh I'm not 100% sure on how threat works
---
You had to really pay attention to your flight path, which zep or boat you would take, should you ride to the closest FP through flagged areas or just hearth and take that 10 minute flight etc. It felt like a world.
---
Hunter's R10 set is insane. Equal to T2 in stats and has huge amounts of crit. PVPing with a Rhok Delar would be a lot nicer than PVPing with a Stratholme Xbow, though, so PVE definitely helps.
---

Yes and no. 
---
I'm planning to hit 60 within a month but that's going to be from just playing a lot I won't be efficient and I will run every dungon at least once and after I get my first toon raid ready I'll take my time with an alt
---
I remember a paladin who played with a controller back in the day. It won't be optimal but is totally possible.
---
I would still think that stats + chance on hit overweighs raw dps, in terms of a good pvp melee wep for hunters.
---
Well said. The work to payoff ratio is perfect in Vanilla. That scenario you laid is an adventure waiting to happen. Maybe you meet some cool people who helped you travel or you just rode past. Maybe you got ganked on the way or found a rare spawn.
---
wotf can only be used in pvp, really. whereas when you're orc the racials will be useful for both. go orc.
---
&gt; smug forum cretins who love mocking people who enjoy different things than they do.
---
So that's solved by mocking people who enjoy different things than you do?
---
I just want every expansion to have its own servers. Not just Classic and BFA.
---
Yes private servers exist, but it's not the same knowing it could just shut down one day, it's edited, and not a real thing. 
---
Classic is an amazing start just hope it does well enough for them to think other expansions are worth bring back.
---
The concern is about the body aggro that the Rogue causes on the other mobs after the Sap.
---
If it is a 3-pull and you Sap one, then the Rogue ends up body aggroing the other two. Now the Tank has to pull 2 mobs off of the Rogue and the Healer has to heal both the Tank and the Rogue, increasing the amount of threat that the Healer is generating, further increasing the effort the Tank needs to apply to maintain aggro.
---
Compare that to a 3-pull where the Rogue saps one and then Vanishes. Now the Warrior can initiate the pull, gaining aggro on both other targets without needing to spend extra effort or rage, and the Healer pulls less aggro because it does not need to heal the Rogue.
---
Azeroth is flat.
---
Well there was people saying to use vanish after sapping and someone else saying to use gouge on one after sapping
---
Honestly in my experience if you do it right there rogue should barely take any damage if he runs back immediately. And the healer shouldn't heal him immediately if he knows how to heal well
---
you would want a more random sample. It's really hard to get an accurate sample, it's hard to reacht the people that aren't on reddit and streams. The point is that we shouldn't trust these polls very much at all as a representation of what it will be like. It could possibly be a decent guess at how more "hardcore" people will choose.
---
You need a shield. Even with a shield, you will wish you were still taking less damage. But if you politely ask your healer, you can find moments to swap to 2h for a little bit of damage. Maybe it‚Äôs just 1-2 elites, and you have a sheep for the other one, or you‚Äôre fighting.
---
Yeah wep is going to be the main thing. You're only ever going to get so much done with a blue weapon. Rhok'delar, BWL Xbow, Naxx XBow are core upgrades for a hunter. If you could worm your way into a raid to pick up Rhok'delar and Smiting Xbox 6 months later you'll be good. Naxx Xbow is very nice but pretty optimistic for anyone not hardcore.
---
Good call, I will. Thanks.
---
Me and 2 friends made shaman alts during vanilla. Everything was easily killed. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend all picking the same class for mains.
---
&gt;adventurous semicolon
---
good band name
---
Idk if you‚Äôre talking about Mutanas or Verdan, but I remember verdan, the giant elemental being one of the hardest hitting bosses for the level. It makes healing a stress and a half.
---
Yeah, Vanish doesn't break Sap if you really need to use it for some reason, and if you get pulled out of Stealth (which without speccing into Sub you will), and aren't using Vanish, gouging a mob (not the sapped one obviously) gives your tank time to pick the mob up without you or the healer healing you taking unnecessary damage.
---
Or the mobs completely destroy the Rogue and it causes a wipe on what should have otherwise been a simple pull. This is exactly the scenario that OP describes, did you not read?
---
The people around me, whoever they might be depending if i am work or home will hear the loudest For the Hord scream in their lives.
---
Can‚Äôt be bothered logout inside an inn with such pace üòÄ
---
Don‚Äô you think it would get pretty tedious playing new quests in the same maps, expansion after expansion?  MMORPG‚Äôs are partly about exploring, lose that and you lose quite a lot of the game.
---
Raiding guilds will probably be selling leafs for epic bow. Rings from AV and DM. You can buy BoE T1 belt, bracers from AH.
---
&gt; wotf can only be used in pvp
---
I'm not about to say that WotF is a huge thing in PVE, because it's not, but making a blanket statement that it can ONLY be used in PVP is dishonest.
---
It all comes down to the weapons. If you can swap out a mediocre stat stick weapon for one capable of bigger his in melee then could be more useful. But sure, most of the time hunters aren't swapping out a BIS weapon for significantly worse one with more weapon damage.
---
Have you ever heard of opportunity costs mate? They may cost the same amount of rage, but with hs you lose an autos worth of rage in that equation. Sunder stacks to 5, it also still gives you threat, so not entirely useless. If anything you should be saving rage after you've secured threat for next pull or adds etc.
---
you'll use it once in a bleu moon. its really not worth it.
---
People saying they don't like retail, and do like classic...on a classic subreddit? naw, you're crazy
---
The same reason anyone has a problem with a group of people: they take anecdotal evidence of perceived toxicity, generalize it to the whole group, then lash out with a disproportionate response of their own, perpetuating the cycle.
---
I play Druid. What is this ‚Äúrace choice‚Äù of which you speak?
---
&gt; Sunder only stacks 3 times
---
5*
---
You are right about Sunder stacking to 5.
---
Not really, there's plenty of zones in the 'core' set of WoW that you shouldn't have to revisit the same ones every expansion and they would still be updated/redesigned with each expansion as well.
---
I just want to keep the "world" feel instead of every player being shoved into the same 5-6 zones
---
You can definitely do it with a controller! My friend literally didn‚Äôt have a mouse for months but he had a PS4 controller, so he just did it. Useless in PVP but leveling using like &gt;10 abilities, it was great!
---
Horde has less hunters because paladins hard counter them with cleanse and blessing of freedom. Viper Sting, cleansed or stone formed. Concussive shot cleansed and freedomed. Wing clip, freedomed. Freezing trap, cleansed. Frost trap, freedomed.
---
The only thing left in your arsenal that they can't remove from their own team are scatter shot and intimidation but they can always bop their teammates or divine shield themselves out of it. They have a shit ton of armor and a shield so you have no damage against them and your pet's attacks get blocked a decent amount of the time.
---
One of the worst 1v1 matchups in the game if you ask me.
---
Who cares where it's said. Everybody circle jerks, yourself included. Which is why I'm calling out your bullshit argument that it's one sided.
---
&gt; SA on an off target does nothing beneficial since no one is attacking it, you are better off getting more threat by using HS.
---
&gt; SA on an off target does nothing beneficial since no one is attacking it, you are better off getting more threat by using HS.  
---
This same logic applies to any single target ability that causes threat. To say SA an off target is useless is the same as saying using Heroic on an off target is useless. Which are both wrong. Building threat on any target that could potentially pull off of you is a worthwhile action, as long as you are prioritizing the correct targets in the correct order.
---
Hi, /u/Samio25
---
Yes, I mistakenly put 3. Each sunder still generates less threat than HS.
---
Made a late edit too*
---
I'd like to see something similar to what Jagex is doing with oldschool runescape, adding new content that fits the classic theme, where each piece of content is polled before being added.  
---
    
---
Possibly some un-released areas that may have been scrapped, or something.
---
I'm sure there are technical limitations that would prevent that so I think a progressive vanilla&gt;tbc&gt;wotlk would probably be what will end up happening.   
---
Just think it'd be cool to see new content be added while still staying true to the theme of classic WoW
---
&gt; to say SA an off target is useless is the same as saying using Heroic on an off target is useless.
---
I didn't say it was useless, I said it was a waste of rage. A more efficient use of rage would be to use HS since it costs the same rage but generates more threat.
---
Makes sense.
---
This is awesome!
---
Does the hidden tooltip for Anger Management count as active rage generation?
---
Nothing about any game is hard to me. "Hard" is extremely objective. Come to think of it, nothing in life is hard and I've been to war.
---
I highly recommend never dual wielding while leveling a warrior. The amount of times you‚Äôll miss are very frustrating.
---
Yes, but only after the fatigue from rushing to pre-bis in two weeks sets in.
---
As far as I know WoW has always operated on raids resetting once a week and since that's how it was in vanilla too I don't see any reason it'd be different
---
If you're looking for third party controller software I would recommend xpadder cuz it's pretty cheap
---
Technically yes, however you're pet is attacking slower so they will crit far less often than a faster attack speed pet - therefore the buff is active for less.
---
Horrendous idea
---
I used to take the trash out wash the dishes from dinner every night and wash the 2 cars every fortnight and they would pay my sub each month. At the time I thaught that this was a great deal.
---
Druid because i love the thought of being able to fill every role, having high utility and having a high potential at open world PvP
---
Only time we ever went to Azshara was for Azuregos but the zone was beautiful for sure. It was also full of gold farmers because it was basically empty all the time. Bots loved this zone for that reason.
---
I loved this on my warrior when I played Fury in TBC.
---
Oh man I could bust out my old gigantic toshiba laptop that I had to rest on top of a fan to keep from overheating for true emersion!
---
Simple - if Classic succeeds in terms of profitability, release the Emerald Dream.
---
I was on a high-XP private server where I did all the raids barring Naxx.
---
What I didn't experience, was that immersive in-the-world leveling experience. I got up to 46~ on Nost, and even that was wonderful. 
---
Will be on an RP server. Will incorporate my mage leveling up into the RP, as if I was a D&amp;D wizard starting from being a shitty apprentice and mastering the arcane one step at a time. Very slow steps.
---
The whiskers that drop off animals in STV were pretty dope cash for common grey items. 
---
Also if you use the AH farming elemental earth in Badlands is always good.
---
Nobody stops you from playing retail... There's a lot of toilet humor.
---
Jokes aside that's what made leveling in Barrens so enjoyable. People were having a blast in such hostile environment where everything can kill you. Now that I think about it, this sounds a lot like Australia.
---
This is probably the 5th or 6th time this question in various forms, has been asked.
---
Not to be rude, but please try and search first.
---
3
---
Good lord, between this and the ‚Äúcan I get X faction‚Äôs mount by 40‚Äù, it‚Äôs getting ridiculous.
---
I was pointing out the irony of you complaining about one style of humor, but then defending another similar example by only stating that one was funny and the other was not. I'm sorry that you did not understand, but it wouldn't be ironic if you did.
---
I'm generally in the no changes crowd, but one unpopular thing that I wouldn't hate would be summoning stones at instance entrances, still requiring at least 2 people to summon the rest of the party.
---
Nope. I think 2 actions per key stroke falls under automation and will get you banned as you would need an external program to do it.
---
My first mount I ever got was the level 40 Paladin mount. My parents were strict about how much I could play video games so I played at my friends house often, although he had an insanely slow computer. It took roughly 40 minutes for me to do the quest, which mostly was only traveling between stormwind and ironforge, due to the slow old machine. I still got it though - braggin‚Äô rights attained.
---
Sorry, if you don‚Äôt have a shield in higher level dungeons, I‚Äôll just straight up replace you. *shrug* no reason to make the run harder on the healer and by extension the group for ‚Äúmuh deeps‚Äù
---
From what I understand, paladins have a hard time tanking at 60 even with deep prot, but I could be wrong
---
So glad to see rogue up there. I‚Äôm rolling dwarf rogue for pvp but also want to do raids. Good to know I won‚Äôt be totally useless
---
Yeah, rose tinted glasses my ass. 
---
When I had my paladin that I finally settled on, I grinded for MONTHS just to get to level 50, usually took people a month or two at most. 
---
But I liked to go out of my way to enjoy it and do my professions as well. 
---
Having to wait till 30 to get my mount was grinding as all hell, but good God was it sooo damned satisfying to earn. 
---
I remember everyone being so proud of everything they did, the gear they got, the mount, hell.. the friends they made by sheer accident because they bumped into em someplace questing. 
---
Modern wow isn't like that. Everything is so damned easy and handed to you.  
---
I'm so damned excited to grind away and actually earn what I get again.
---
Not according to an in-depth tanking and aggro guide posted on this subreddit earlier today.
---
Regardless the exact amount, the threat numbers are close enough to where it isn't worth losing the extra rage from an auto attack if you choose HS over sunder.
---
8. If not warglave you need reset so other don't get it xD
---
Sorry for the late reply, yeah you're right I was only 13-15 during vanilla and not that active in the community, I probably missed out on that entirely. Throwing you an upvote because your original post got downvoted, and I don't think that's necessary
---
But alliance has 2 races that can be hunters, horde has 3...seems counter intuitive.
---
What came to my mind is that do faster pets gain even more atkspeed, due to the buff being percentual?
---
If so, it evens out.
---
Priest on a PvP server because I fucken hate myself
---
Do you have a link to this guide? That goes against my personal experience as well as everything I have read.
---
In what way? Could you elaborate on what you mean by that? Are you saying that because horde has more races that can be hunters, there also ought to be more hunters on horde? Or am I not getting what you're saying?
---
Wasn‚Äôt that a lock?
---
Ah... a fellow man of culture
---
That is true. Good point.
---
Have you ever heard of Raptor Strike crits?
---
Play a warrior if you want to be melee dps. Nothing else makes sense. Oh you wanna be a rogue? Lets think that through. "You get to pick your fights as a rogue and stealth for quest objectives." False you still get assigned the same hoofs claws or whatever the hell to collect from mobs. Those pickups for noncombat quests are always close enough to something to agro. You cannot collect the object while stealthed so you're still killing the same shit a warrior is. Stealth is cool but you gain no experience or drops from just wandering around at reduced speed. "But you get high damage openers." Yes you will do a third of the targets hp in the first shot then you'll do average damage while getting beat up cause youre in leather and cloth while the warrior does average damage takes less damage then hits the last chunk of the mobs hp and executes it. It's like rogues start fights but warriors finish them but the killspeed averages out to me. Overall rogue is like being a shittier squishier warrior with less gear options. I tried leveling both and didnt like either in vanilla. Mobility and damage you want mage or hunter. You may enjoy hunter, they can do some decent melee abilities occasionally but you'll mostly be using your kit to keep mobs where you want them. And that is the hell away from you.
---
that legit startled me
---
The first album from them Adventurous Semicolon; Adventurous Semicolon
---
Raene's Cleansing
---
Tbc was probably the best game ever. That is all.
---
Why would a slow attack speed gain more from an attack speed buff than a fast attack speed?
---
I don't get it.
---
To be fair, how many people read the TOS? It's just another among the millions you need to say you've read.
---
Plus how long is this excuse going to be valid? We're two months from summer. Are they that ambiguous about completing their deadlines this close to summer that they can't announce their plan?
---
 You're right. Seriously Blizzard, come freaking on.
---
It doesn't seem to be working.
---
To be perfectly honest, there *are* a lot of QoL things I'm going to hate to be without, but the chance to experience that community again is too tempting to pass up.
---
Depends on if you need it or not.  If I'm a lvl 50 hunter and find a Hurricane bow in a group, I'm needing that shit and using it till lvl 60 and there is nothing wrong with that.  Don't let buthurt money hungry assholes tell you how to roll or play the game.  Just don't be an asshole yourself and turn around and sell it on the AH.  Equip it right away and use it if you need it.  Simple.
---
I worked as planned.
---
SO WHAT UR SAYING IS U DONT WANT A SLOW WEAPON U WANT ONE WITH RANGED STATS
---
TLDR CORPSEMAKER IS A SHIT HUNTER WEAPON FUCK OFF
---
Warrior shaman priest all day. The other option has you competing for too much gear. In warrior shaman priest shammy very little gear is contested and very little is wasted. Everything nearly is an upgrade for one of you.
---
I‚Äôm missing Thorium point in searing gore.  The fp there was essential for alliance reach to black rock mountain.
---
I mean every warrior who picks it up will drop it shortly after for bonebiter or whirlwind axe, he seems to be getting much more mileage out of it even if its in a memey way.
---
Yeah, they didn't use to give bans for that back in the day ;p
---
Fuck this. Quit stirring up shit with retail players. Literally 2 different games. Let us enjoy ours and let them enjoy theirs.
---
I am fairly certain most people never reads traffic laws either. They still apply to everyone.
---
You know a way it would‚Äôve felt fresh? Not playing a private server.
---
Well the Plaguelands have to improve eventually with all the heroes did right? So I felt it was fine to show some positive change. Of course I'm looking forward to the vanilla versions I haven't seen in what.. 13 years?
---
Well from that tipsout video, they got boss armor completely wrong.. % to cast on a bunch of effects wrong... I can tell you right now most mobs spell damages are wrong.
---
I'm sure there's tons of shit wrong. I may of been inexperienced but I distinctly remember vanilla being pretty difficult in comparison to private servers, but I may just be a better player now a days.
---
I dont think its about sollutions. Its about emotional catharsis, and venting your frustrations.
---
Human emotions are not always rational.
---
From Cata onwards? Lots of great quest hubs in Pandaria, Warlords had some memorable ones like Embaari village, and Legion had some cool ones like the blue dragon in the lake in Azsuna and hanging out on the Vindicaar on Argus.
---
But memorable hubs in Cata? Nothing comes to mind. I remember spending a lot of time in SW during Cata and queuing for BGs.
---
It‚Äôs funny because I think of the original races troll hunters are the coolest hunters. Plus bow specialization.
---
&gt;I mowed the lawn for free to keep my parents paying for my sub.
---
That just sounds like you got paid, doesn't it? :D
---
You just finished your second business class in uni didn‚Äôt you?
---
They hit harder.
---
&gt; there's a worry Classic will segregate the retail community
---
  And it's very well founded, the fact they're putting out classic with the same sub and releasing/getting content during bfa content drought gives classic all the chances in the world to do well.  
---
  As for the vice versa scenario, not even retail players are liking retail right now, even if it's basically legion+.  
---
  You can only put the same old carrot on a stick broken design on retail so many times, people get tired of the uninteractivity, lfr, cosmetic collection, etc, things that the casual crowd liked are now getting tired of.
---
Yup definitely! And....I plan to do my vendoring/ AH, fishing /cooking leveling at lunchtime at work. So when I do get home I can get straight into leveling once the kids are in bed üòÇüëç
---
Classic will be different from private servers. They guessed on a lot of things (enemy spells, resistances, etc.) It should feel fairly new.
---
I have been holding back Vacation and Paid time. If it were to drop mid July I would be semi screwed as I work at Amazon, and one of our busiest times of the year is mid July, and impossible to get the time off.  
---
I expect any other time, I should have a solid week of time off, and 3 days to play per week in normal work hours going forward.
---
What boggles me isn't that they removed them as a gameplay feature but they also removed them as a visual effect, now you just pull arrows out of the back of your shirt for a lot of these bows =/
---
RITE SOOO...
---
sure. SURE. a slower weapon is gonna give you more melee damage and bigger raptor strike hits. but that doesn't mean its a priority. that doesn't mean you wanna hunt out slow ass weapons with str. that doesnt mean you wanna use a slow ass str weapon &gt; a quick ass agi weapon. raptor strike damage is bottom of the barrel shit. thats the lowest fucking prio when it comes to deciding between 2 weapons. the only time you would ever turn to weapon speed as the deciding factor between 2 weapons as a hunter is if you had 2 weapons with the exact same stats and damage, and the only difference is weapon speed. in that situation, sure, you would go with the slower weapon because it will boost your raptor strike damage. but thats such an incredibly, unfathomably low priority that it basically isnt a consideration at all. as someone already said, if you're giving up a 2.7 weapon speed polearm with +15 agi for a Corpsemaker with a 3.8 weapon speed and +Str because some goon online told you hunters NEED a slow 2h weapon for pvp, you're doing it wrong. fuck weapon speed. fuck yo raptor strike damage. ranged damage is more important.
---
quite possibly. female human clothy anyway
---
The basics, threat and damage meters, maybe something for Mining/Herb locations. Something for the UI as well, but it will depend on what becomes available, I am pretty picky when it comes to UI change though.
---
I played vanilla too, although I was very young and just caught the tail end of it, but I remember things being harder too. I'm allegedly leveling on a server right now and I swear mobs had more/harder hitting abilities as well. Also drop rates are fucked. On the server that I may or may not be playing on, I've gotten like 6 bags to drop by level 19. I remember getting to level 20 and getting one, maybe two bags to drop.
---
Some might even say... illegal!
---
Shut up butthole boy
---
anyone know of any camera tools that are being developed or any that work? (like the machinima tool or free far sight). I've always wanted to try my hand at making a raid video but I can't find any camera software for the current wow build :(
---
do you want to double your 4 quarters or double your 1 dollar?
---
Warrior is top dps?
---
I thought blood fury at some point in vanilla was changed to also include spell power so that orc casters also gained a benefit?
---
True, but there are no other MMOs to play that give me even a fraction of the enjoyment that Vanilla gives me. Hell, I can't even get into single player games anymore at this point. All I want to do is play Vanilla wow.
---
Haha, pretty much! I was about 13 y/o at summer camp when an older teen pulls out his laptop and plays the cinematic for a few of us. I was instantly entranced in how beautiful it was. I had been playing Runescape for about 2 years at this point, but at soon as I got back from camp, I bought the game and my best bud and I loaded it up on his PC. 14 years later and I can't wait for Classic!
---
Private server values are wrong so take what guides you find with a 50% larger grain of salt.
---
That's a strawman. A mob has a set HP. If I'm hitting bigger I'm going to hit that threshhold sooner than if I was hitting lower.
---
I was quoting, I know it gets used in pvp sorry if that was u clear. I was making fun of the guy above me for ignoring weapon damage as a factor.
---
Hey I‚Äôm not knocking private servers but don‚Äôt ask for the wheel of nostalgia to be invented a third time is all.
---
Good read, thank you for the effort.
---
Back in infancy when I had to take a shit and my parents wouldn't put me on the toilet for whatever reason, I would literally shit my pants just to get it out of my body.. anyone else ever do this?
---
Yeah but a heroic strike is just a buffed up melee swing?
---
Only if done smugly.
---
Not Hearthstone... the WoW tcg.. digital version..
---
Go check out osrs and rs3 subreddits. This is super normal and will only get worse.
---
Couldn‚Äôt it glance because heroic strike increases the damage of your next melee swing? Technically a white attack just increased dmg
---
+1
---
It doesn't make any sense. 100% attack speed buff means you double your damage. Your attack speed or attack value is irrelevant, it's a percentage increase.
---
The person you just replied to wasn't the same person that said that it wasn't bonkers.
---
I'll probably go for shaman. Planning to get some hybrid heal/enh build so I can farm with enh gear (2h hell yeah) and pve as a healer, chain heal for days!
---
why is that consistent w/ self hate
---
A lot of people forget that hardiness stacks additively with base stun resist, which puts orcs at 30% stun resist. Just 3% short of a true 1 in 3 chance to resist.
---
Nowhere did I ask for anything. All I said is that I hope that the original 1.12 code spices things up a bit. I'll still fully enjoy the experience either way.
---
In wow, slower hits harder. Having a harder hitting weapon that gets more speed is superior to the same damage output from a faster weapon.
---
In PvP you can also make the enemy Mage face the wrong direction at the last .01 second of his Pyroblast.
---
Yep. All that data was in the database, so it was scrounged from sites like Thottbot/Wowhead, but those sites didn't start accounting for no drop until much later, screwing the results.
---
You can even go and kill mobs from pservers and look at wowhead, they'll drop shit that isn't even on their loot table. 
---
Pservers also changed the spawn rates/drop rates of rare items like Black Lotus etc. It's a giant shit show.
---

I couldn't get my parents to sub using their credit card, so I lived off the prepaid game time boxes. I have a ton of those puppies on a shelf, now.
---
my nephews first experiences with WoW in general are vanilla private servers. 
---
they died just as often as i did back in the day, hell one of them must have more playtime as ghost running to his corpse than everything else.
---
it won't be much harder for us long time players i guess.
---
True, for instant attacks that use attack damage. Makes no difference for autoattacks and flat damage abilities (ie. pets).
---
But you can recreate your 14-15 year old character in vanilla, and get to play them like they used to be. It's like rereading a book, and sure is some of what I'm planning to do.
---
Original 1.12 ? Wait what ? 
---
Classic is based on 7.3??? Legion code with just db and art from 1.12.  
---
Of course they will try to emulate how 1.12 felt but will differ a bit from pservers based on 1.12.
---
Rogue or Hunter grrrrr
---
Even Rage Fire Chasm has 3-4 man trogg/orc pulls, you sheep/pet off tank one you still have the tank stunk trying to Tank 2 mobs, unless your all lvl 18 that shit will burn down the tanks health faster that the healer can keep up plus the dps is going to be splitting most of his time spam healing his pet or keeping up his CC to be effective.          
---
           
---
Can it be done? Maybe with 2 hours to kill but why the fuck would you subject yourself to that?

Someone post the wheel mage... Just because.
---
I play in a US top 500 raiding guild and I'm pretty excited to play Classic. Unsure how I plan to balance my time between the two or if I'll take a tier off of retail to grind classic
---
I am pretty surprised that most of my guildmates do not feel the same. We have a few guys who currently like to mess around on PServers raiding when we have off nights, but almost everyone else in the guild has no interest in classic. Was surprised to see that tbh
---
Ranking doesn't require burning consumables. The point of premade ranking is stomping pub BGs, which any decent premade can do without using anything but a couple of mage water. Running into other premades is terrible for honor because of player kill dim returns and longer games. If people are trying to rank up they will definitely be sniping and queue dodging other premades.
---
You'll probably enjoy it more with classes that have more simple damage rotations and combat maneuvering. I'll definitely try the feature out if it makes it into the game.
---
I'm just looking to put together a medium sized guild in which everyone works on mastering their class and professions at their own pace. I want people to enjoy the game and not rush to be the best.
---
I'm tired of always feeling like I'm behind because I decide to spend a day with family or work on a piece of art. Just enjoy the game the way it was intended. An adventure into the unknown meeting other adventurers and learning their stories.
---
I can't put into words all the good things I want to put forth once this game drops. Down with toxicity, and play with honor and compassion.
---
Hope I can find some like minded people to pull it all off.
---
Troll hunters are definitely the best in terms of DPS and PvE.
---
Orc, Dwarf, and Night Elves are better for PvP though.
---
As other people have said, distract them to face away from you, approach carefully, sap and sprint back. Unless you are being slowed or hit for whatever reason, you don‚Äôt need to vanish.
---
Practice this a few times and you will get the hang of it.
---
FWIW, I think you may have come to a decision a bit too early. If you finish the grind to 60, work on some pre-raid BiS and hop into some early raid content I think you'll find that you're *really* sure shaman is not for you. Or me. Man are they boring in vanilla :(
---
May i try too ?
---
Vanilla design isn't adapted to the current gamer audience and will only retain old players who experienced this old design philosophy or games which used to have it like WoW.
---
In 2 months most of the tourists will have left and classic will keep an healthy albeit small community compared to retail.
---
No overtaking, just a small passion project from blizzard.
---
The fights are still quite challenging though. It's not as simple as "follow directions." A lot of times you are micromanaging a ton of different things at once. You do need to think critically about your rotations and a lot of first kills are super fucking scuffed and require some hero moves to get the kill
---
There will be a day one mass exodus of tourists who will decide they dont like walking and no transmog and they will leave BUT there will be even more who will stay, how many? I cant say but my question to everyone is how many more can retail honestly afford to lose? 1/4? 1/2? 1/3?         
---
The people who just want to push the LFR button probably won't notice but people with friends andactive guilds will see a massive difference.
---
It wasn't ever in vanilla in the same way it was in private servers. It was a bug to do with lag where if you spam /sit 10 times a second every now and then it would trick the client into getting crit from the sit but while you're standing, activating the talent. It does work in vanilla in pvp, but purposely getting crit in pvp is usually pretty dumb. It was even around and was a 'strategy' in tbc arena, priests would /sit with a pet on them to get focused casting.  
---
On private servers it works 100% every single time, you sit, get crit and get the talent proc whenever you want it.
---
Depends on the fight.
---
Come later content (T2.5 and beyond) Warlocks are up there too.
---
Hunters and Warlocks swap half way. Hunters are great DPS T1,2 then down scale well and are mostly utility.
---
Warlocks conversely start as sub tier DPS and are mostly used for utility. Then in AQ/Naxx they become heavy hitters.
---
Yeah for sure, I understand that it was the most logical progression of the story (though I admit I woulda loved seeing the Forsaken spread north to occupy former Scourge territory).
---
Mostly I just agree with your sentiment - they were such awesomely crafted atmospheric zones, I'm excited to get to go back and experience them in their original form!
---
Some of these things you mentioned annoyed me about cata, but overall I enjoyed the expansion because the endgame content was actually really fun. Flawed, but fun. Pandaland was the expansion that did it for me. The melodramatic theme mixed with the absolute silliness and lack of any true threat just made me not give a fuck about the lore.
---
The endgame content was actually pretty fun and the raid mechanics were pretty good but man, I hated leveling. Don't even get me started on the cluster fuck that was the timeless isles. Blizzard made something to replace the grindiness that was dailies and rep grinding and they somehow made it the most grindy shit in the game
---
All you need to do is play more than the hardcorest basement dwelling WoW players. No biggie. Or are you going to gank them as a lvl 20 rogue while they're lvl 40?
---
You forgot to draw the mage that was drinking outside the room. Who is now locked out because his team engaged and the doors closed. 
---
Might just have been my experience.
---
&gt;It's a giant shit show.
---
It's an effort of reverse engineering with incomplete data.  
---
If you wanna say their data is wrong, so be it, no argument there.
---
But if you wanna trash talk software engineers, who spent countless hours of their lives in order to provide an otherwise inaccessible experience to people, then you have 2 options:
---
* Link us your repo where you did a better job
---
* Or go f\* right off
---
The people who did this know more, do more abd amount to more than every little sh\* on some random subreddit, who can barely wipe his own smartphone without injuring himself.
---
&gt; Dungeon Finder meant I could just sit in one spot and get to max level.
---
If you do 100 damage every 1 sec, 100% speed increase would mean that now you hit for 100 damage every 0.5 sec.
---
Just chill'n... kill'n.

What‚Äôs wrong with priest on pvp server ?

Does Ret work in any of the twink brackets? 29/39/49

Is your guide just for yourself or is it public?
---
&gt; Used to a Nightsaber Fang dropping from each kill?  
---
This quest was actual hell on [that one third iteration server that doesn't deal with light] so they might have actually gotten it right!  
---
Due to the nightmare I suffered on that quest, I agreed to never do this quest again, and I haven't.
---
I feel people upvoting something probably means they agree with it or feel its truthful. Not really something you can ask for a source for.
---
Thank you!
---
Mana tide iv is 54 mp5 (party wide)
---
Bow rank 1 is 10 mp5 (single target)
---
The ER will reflect organic and inorganic growth.
---
But if a pet's attack speed is 1.00 the 30% increase means more of an atkspeed increase? Than say 2.50 attack speed.

Yeah, they could knock out all the endgame cata zones but hyjal, uldum, and twilight highlands and the game would've been great. They *were* going for a 5 elements theme though. They'd need to find a different zone for earth and water, maybe the badlands and azshara respectively (though azshara becoming the horde symbol was one of the greatest things ever)
---
The entire classic WOW series of events, showed me how much humans are still the jungle thriving tribes with different clothing.
---
What about R10 spriest gear? How does it compare
---
&gt; otherwise it's shady and untrue.  
---
Honestly I'd be more shocked if a corporation acted differently than this.
---
10 dmg ever 2 seconds vs 5 dmg every 1 second. = 5 DPS in both cases.
---
If you apply 100% attackspeed.
---
10 dmg every 1 second vs 5 dmg every 0,5 second = 10 DPS in both cases.
---
But, a faster attackspeed has a much higher chance of getting a critical strike, which leads to higher uptime and will again lead to better DPS.
---
Thanks!
---
Biggest thing I'm hyped for is that levelling actually feels like part of the game. Instead of just a roadblock you have to get through.
---
Muge cuz i like turtles
---
Do you have any evidence to support your claims?
---
Yeah, I do miss the community that the old realm forums brought. It made such a difference.
---
It‚Äôs not those NPCs need to reset same goes with doing the Onyxia escort quest on the alliance side once you are done with the BRD part if anyone is doing the next part in the open world you‚Äôll need to wait in the camp for the NPC to reset.
---
Yeah man this is the worst
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Yeah, the Ravager isn't anything to write home about in a DPS focussed setting, but there are clearly niche ways to use this weapon as a hunter. Just because it isn't optimal doesn't mean it's outright bad in every scenario.
---
But as a warrior people expect you to tank
---
Tbh tips wouldn't know vanilla if he had a time machine.
---
Same, I‚Äôll read every quest and I‚Äôll do every zone I love &amp; miss (shimmering flats etc). I‚Äôll probably play a lot at the beginning but that doesn‚Äôt mean going fast, I think it‚Äôs important to appreciate the lore and the zones in Vanilla
---
I agree it's very unlikely that they would go that route.  But an alternative universe where they stick to the core gameplay principles of vanilla would be great.
---
For the first week or two yeah, but realistically, how much time will they invest into that level 1? Not much
---
Cool, could you explain why?
---
Locks also struggle mightily with rogues so stun resist helps a ton against them
---
Very possible if you join a guild that clears the content in 1 night.
---
As a rogue everyone wants to beat your ass it's basically a really slow game of hide and seek followed by really bad tanking.
---
How would you determine an inflated price?
---
All of his experience comes from private servers he admits he never played it in an AMA/interview. Most of his knowledge comes from pservers and blue posts or watching old content.
---
No, that is not how it works. Heroic strike while dual wielding will even use the special attack hit table, not the white attack table, meaning you're looking at 9% miss chance instead of 27% (or was it 24%, I don't recall.).
---
based on their post history I'm gonna say they're legit
---
Blizzard hasn't posted sub numbers since 2015. I highly doubt they would start now.
---
You might be able to pull an estimate out of their financial report, but modern WoW has so many mounts/pets thrown into the mix, in addition to WoW tokens, that it'd be nigh impossible to guess.
---
You're the only one mentioning Str as a stat. Why are you bringing this into the equation? 
---
The argument here is: for PvP, Hunters would rather have a slow 2H with good hunter stats than dual wielding two 1Hs with good hunter stats. That is because you will inevitably come into melee occasionally, but want to get out there as fast as possible, which is why the slow swing timer of a big ass weapon doesn't come into factor as much. Just want to Raptor Strike + Wing Clip and then get out. In this scenario, the big ass 2H obviously deals more damage.
---
This whole discussion is full of people trying super hard to miss the point.
---
Depends how long and extensive beta they have(if they have one). If it is a month or more, most first stage things will get "discovered".
---
That would actually be pretty cool.
---
100 dmg weapon, 1.0 attack speed
---
10% crit
---
10 swings, 1100damage, 10 seconds
---
50dmg weapon, 0.5 attack speed
---
20 swings,  1100damage, 10 seconds
---
&gt;uptime
---
I'll accept that, but most weapon procs have an internal cool down.
---
1.00 Attack Speed ==  100 attacks in 100 seconds of 100 damage :: 100 dps      
---
with 30% buff    
---
(1.00 / 1.3) Attack Speed ==  130 attacks in 100 seconds  of 100 damage :: 130 dps      
---
2.00  Attack Speed with 200 damage == 50 attacks in 100 seconds of 200 damage :: 100 dps    
---
(2.00 / 1.3) Attack speed == 65 attack in 100 seconds of 200 damage :: 130dps  
---
Ok that was pretty silly but at least now I'm not crazy. 30% attack speed increases your damage by 30%.
---
At least on a rogue you can hide from players of opposing faction that are higher level than you. Warriors will get corpse camped by higher level mages
---
Can't decide between Mage, Hunter, Priest or Shaman. It's a real struggle
---
I would maybe be ok with it, but it had flying and horde paladins, alliance shamans and the concept of blood elves. Because of these reasons I would never touch TBC ever again.
---
Paladins are world PvP powerhouses while leveling. Their hardest counters (Shadow Priests, Warlocks, and Elemental Shaman) don't shine until the endgame, while other classes (like Druids and Rogues) really need all of their abilities and talents to beat them.
---
Meanwhile, Paladins have both of their heal spells, Hammer of Justice, Divine Protection, Judgement, and Seal of Command by level 20 - basically their entire toolkit.
---
I ain't trash talking software engineers, stop being so sensitive. I'm trash talking all these fools that think vanilla will be a cake walk because their pserver is a cake walk.
---
I wonder how many people will be reporting bugs because their melee hits feel like a noodle or enemies are actually resisting spells. 
---
*"why my aim shot only crit 1200 instead of 2500??? doesnt [boss] have 0 armor??"*
---
An hour or two here and there is literally my goal. There's not gonna be a lot of time left after chasing my then to be 2 year old daugther around the whole day. Im just so happy that a lot of these "I'm a dad now and I'm just gonna taket it chill" guys are out there, just like me.
---
&gt; its not all about min-maxing.
---
I completely agree, and if you enjoy leveling as fury, more power to you. Personally, I find the experience of warrior leveling straining enough as is, so I wouldn't want to make it any harder than it has to be. Fury is OKish once you hit level 40 and maybe get some hit gear, but it feels absolutely atrocious before that, to me anyways.
---
Not to take away from your preference or anything, if you like it, go for it!
---
Now imagine your energy tick gets reduced by half everytime your OH misses. That's what it's like to level as fury.
---
On one of the private servers I‚Äôve played on the FAQ said that they deliberately increased the 6 slot bag drop rate. I had 10 of them by the time I hit lvl 20!
---
I literally said this: &gt; Some mob HP, mana, resistances, immunities and XP earned are broken. I‚Äôve put these all together. Basically expect your Classic mobs to take more of a beating.
---
Before and got shat on here by. I even clarified and went in-depth as to why and the reasons behind it, yet got shat on by private server plebs cus it's actually "correct" eksde!
---
Private servers are broken. People think they're real vanilla. Funny.
---
&gt; Do you have any evidence to support your claims?
---
Anyone with a brain knows it's true.
---
The greatest time I had in classic wow was just the enjoyment of questing, coming across fellow travellers, making new friends and just taking it easy. I will be doing the same again and I'm looking forward to it.
---
I don't see a reason to have more than a stress test, personally, which they already kind of had with the demo.
---
Warlock, for a few reasons:
---
Partially because none of my friends are playing lock, so its an easy opening. Partially because I played lock in actual vanilla (I sucked omega ass and want a "redemption" at it 15 years later). Partially because lock is fun in both pve and pvp, in my opinion.
---
Illegal Danish super snacks üî•
---
No, they have the 1.12 code that they are making the legion *client* work with. They will be emulating the 1.12 code on their end and they are just trying to make the legion client and the old code play nice.
---
Ah yes. A casual optional graphical update that increases the polygon count by 12500%.
---
So when you tell someone "your wardrobe needs improvement", and "your clothes a shitshow", you think you're saying the same thing?
---
Go try that in the real world my friend.
---
You will find out very soon that you're not.
---
Oh yeh the off-hand misses are a bit of a pain, and it can be slow. But you're right, once you get to 40 and if you're doing dungeons to keep your weapons up to date it can be a lot of fun. Plus just thematically it feels great to be a dual-wielding berserker! 
---
I've never been a fan of the slow 'feel' of leveling with a big 2hander, sure you get some nice crits and can burst some targets down, but if you get a couple of misses in a row, it feels really bad. I actually like a big slow 2hander on Enh Shaman, because of windfury and also supplementing it with consistent spells.
---
What's "artificial" about this? If WoW has 2 million subs but 1 million only play Classic, then financial reports will correctly reflect that Blizzard still have 2 million paying subscribers? The shareholders doesn't care if a paying customer is logging into both games or not.
---
So.. you have to have actually played vanilla to make videos about it?
---
&gt;My sweet summer child.
---
Upvoted for GoT reference :D
---
It's the internet, if there's something to oppose or hate on, people will be doing it. 
---
Hell, r/2007scape and r/runescape are still going at each other's throats and OSRS has been out for over 5 years now.
---
Wait, Im sorry but I did not have time to read all this. But lets say a rogue pulls for the tank since in this scenario the tank doesn't have any ranged weapon and the rogue had knives, does that mean that the tank has to exceed the rogues threat by 10% the entire fight since the rogue was the first to strike the mob?
---
Anyone that has played on a pserver and also played during vanilla can support these statements, or at least some of them. I can for sure.
---
However, for those of you who haven't played vanilla (and maybe not even on pservers), don't be discouraged. It won't be as bad as it sounds. I've lvled 6 chars to 60 in pre TBC vanilla. And while it's true, that it'll take longer than it does on pservers, it won't be an insurmountable task.
---
I see a lot of ppl posting that they'll reach 60 in less than a week. While this might be possible, it's hardly achievable by most. And I predict than even some of the hardcore speedrunners won't make it in under 7 days.
---
My plan is to take a week off from work, and play somewher around 10 hours effectively pr day. That's a weekend + a full week (9 days). By the end I predict being somewhere in the early 50s. After that I'll go down to 5 hours effective gametime pr day (twise that on weekends). And somewhere between 2-3 weeks after starting I should do my final ding.
---
That may be a factor, but an even bigger factor is the fact that making an entire Azeroth in high end graphics would be quite costly, and why would you invest that money into an MMORPG when you can make a shitty mobile card game for 1/100 the investment and have a 10 times higher profit?
---
The second coming of Vanilla gives my life meaning again. Real life sucks.
---
Priest should shield you before you go do your zap thingy.
---
Why do ppl come up with ideas to turn Classic into retail even before Classic is launched?
---
Never seen this before, it's great!
---
Just hearth right before you log!! Please!! Do it for me!
---
To have an accurate view of the game outside of 240 quality montage clips? Yes. Remember most of the game wasn't really recorded during vanilla. Outside of old forum posts, some early machinima, and a few visual and written guides there wasn't a lot saved. 
---
So yes if you want an informed opinion you should talk to someone who played the actual game, not an emulation of it, of course you can't expect someone to tell you what mob dropped what and how much spell resist something had from 14 years ago so take it with a grain of salt.
---
True and true.  
---
I can support the claims on at least 1 pserver
---
Or, now bare with me...we could not.
---
The game mechanics were solid. Flying mounts were a really bad decision but the rest I was ok with. Never rolled a blood elf or draenei but the quality of content offered and outlands was great 
---
Even arena was incredible at the time (although it developed into the catalyst that overbalanced classes)
---
It was by far the best expac but started the doomclock on WoW
---
We made it available to buy for those wanting to speedrun. For others looking for a straightforward free guide Brian Kopp‚Äôs is the most reasonable alliance side guide. 
---
https://www.patreon.com/theraceto60
---
It'll be much like watching a movie after reading the book.
---
No good alliance guides that I am aware of, but Joana is working on one, so that'd be the go-to once he finishes. 
---
As for builds, it depends on what you want to do, but it's mostly agreed upon that you'll want to go 5/5 into Wand Specialization, 5/5 Spirit Tap and then delve further into Shadow from there on out, at least for leveling.
---
Honestly I haven‚Äôt paid any attention to reputation values as all my work is on levelling
---
&gt;that are very condescending and think that they will be the only ones who enjoy the game.
---
They are the ones who will enjoy the game for a long time.
---
The "hardcore players" (read: people with time to waste) will rush through it, get bored, and spend the nex 3 years complaining that there are no TBC serves,
---
I remember that back in the day someone did some modding to play on those Wii nunchuck controllers.
---
I'd cry. I've been waiting for so long!
---
It's loss aversion 101 (or what ever it's called in finance). People have invested all their money in a single stock and now that stock is failing, so they start flailing shit around on everyone else.
---
I'm absolutely stunned by the amount of posts we have on "after naxx" so far. I'm obviously not revealing any news to people who browse these forums, but at this point I just have to recount.  
---
I wish I was joking, but I think it's actually reaching triple digits.  
---
Some day I think I will go and collect the links to all the "after naxx" posts on reddit and official forums, and reply to all the new ones with the link list.
---
In 2006 I thought in 10 years I'd be playing a "WoW 2" of some sorts that looks like the cinematics.
---
Of course I have long buried my hopes and dreams by now.
---
Camp Taurajo and Marshal's Refuge are missing them too :(
---
I‚Äôm happy to provide evidence if you have a specific query: most of it will be core table values vs resources like wayback machine‚Äôs old vanilla allakhazam. Some of it will be old videos of vanilla play vs current pserver play.
---
Same! Stunned aswell. Giev Classic!
---
Opinions are like arseholes - everybody has one. 
---
And you were right - it‚Äôs broken. Easily shown by any pserver dev.
---
It literally does offend them. Retail wow players are like religious nutjobs and the mere existance of any other religion is deeply offensive to their world view, even if that new religion (classic) is totaly rad and badass and much much better than their shitty system.
---
Take your time in Classic. Do not rush.
---
I would prefer this honestly too. Few short stress tests and release.
---
If I want to focus on healing, will I be able to reset my talents later on to go full heal? And if I'm going to party with my friends cuz it'll be easier to lvl, will it be better if I just focus on putting my skill points into holy/disc instead of shadow?
---
:D
---
Just picture a game of thrones budget with a warcraft lore. im already comming....
---
Somewhat same. Started when I was 10 just before moving out of city. Nobody played WoW and didn't understand paying a monthly fee. Then when TBC got around and I came back to city to visit old friends, almost everyone was playing. I also made all my other friends in my new town play. Probably one of my favourite times ever in WoW. We had a guild in my 6th grade class with about 10 players in it and we raided SSC and Kara etc. Nothing more epic than a bunch of kids in school on a Friday before weekend, planning our raid for the night on school lunch, recess or in middle of classes lol..
---
Btw if you make a 5 man 1-60 guide, I'll pay you more than any customer you have. Just sayin'
---
The gear you can smith mostly isn't great. For a producing profession, Alchemy is always going to take the cake in the long run because consumables will be required throughout the entirety of the content. It's not like you can't make gold with it, it's just likely not going to be THE best profession for that cause. As for patterns, you don't need to be a blacksmith to sell blacksmithing patterns on the AH, on the contrary, wouldn't you rather use them yourself? I don't really understand that part of the question.
---
How is it untrue?
---
If you pay a wow sub and play one of their worlds of Warcraft, you‚Äôre still giving them $15.
---
Well sure, some things will be wrong. But don't expect change in bis gear list (except a few proc items with unknown proc rate like iron foe). Stats are known, how much damage and how well scale each techniques is known so that won't change.  The meta will likely not change.
---
Totally agree - it is still 90% Blizzlike ‚ù§Ô∏è Only please don‚Äôt min max on values like mob density or how easily a mob dies, because you may come unstuck in that section on Classic. Have some contingency plans üò¨
---
See, you're missing the context here. Shitshow, in the context of things that aren't accurate to vanilla.
---
Now if I had said Mangos is a giant shit show, then I could see why you'd be offended, but you've clearly not had your estrogen pills today.

ER? Earnings Report?

Nobody has a 5-man guide.

Honestly you‚Äôd get a medal if you were all still talking to each other by 60 üòä

Any Night Elf class can do it, again Stealth is the key factor. You can always pick a good hiding spot around a corner and do it that way.
---
Boss armor is wrong because it is buffed on purpose to make it harder on most servers.
---
What did you not like about TBC
---
As with any of these release date threads, I'd much rather have Blizzard take their time and announce the release date late when they are 101% sure it can be released that day then announce a release date that they can't fulfill.
---
..but if they don't know the original value.. how is it buffed
---
You could always just ignore it and move on instead of posting a useless comment. I appreciate seeing posts like these. They are not questions that might naturally occur to me, but upon seeing them I become curious as to the answer and thus my knowledge expands.

Specifically I would like to know the methodology for comparing Vanilla drop rates to Private drop rates. It is easy to see that some things may be "broken" by seeing Private servers having differing code from each other, or the developers admitting that they needed to guess certain values, but how do you know that bags drop "Literally over 100x" than Vanilla?

---
Tbc added a lot of good for sure and it was the best expansion because it changed the vanilla part of wow the least, but many of those changes were unacceptable to me. Blood elves started dominating other horde members in numbers which is just wrong in my head. They removed unique classes from factions which made factions less interesting and more similar to one another. Flying is not even worth mentioning. I liked that more various specs were becoming better like for the hybrids. More talents, professions, eye of the storm was okay, arenas, interesting outlands zones, but overall there were just some negative changes that makes me dislike TBC as a whole.

I‚Äôm really hoping they got stacking debuffs wrong, particularly armor. We know expose and sunder don‚Äôt stack, but on pservers recklessness and faerie do, most of the weapon based ones stack. They are high priority debuffs (and should be) but you can quickly get 5 up. Having it limited to 3 at most, will help get more variety in the debuff list.
---
The thread was an obvious troll. Congratulations to everyone who fell for it.
---
The fact that I spotted these two things too gives me mixed emotions. Didn‚Äôt see ‚ÄûBlackfathom depths‚Äú though.
---
Just a guess, but this 'rose tinted glasses' may mostly came to be because of the craziest classic fans which consider it as some flawless and perfect game, which it isn't and never claimed to be. 
---
Also a part of the classic community is extremely toxic toward retail players, although they mostly either don't care or a genuinely hyped about classic. Maybe you shouldn't insult people if you want them to listen to your arguments.
---
Just look at this post, how many attacks are there against retail ? Meanwhile on WoW forums people are mostly hyped for classic.
---
Also i've been curious : how many of vanilla fans playing for years on Pservers would be ready to pay 13$ a month to get a better experience ? Was there any major decrease in player activity lately on these servers ?
---
I've had the same human Warrior since vanilla wow. He and I have been on many many many many adventures together and I hope that we have many more. But I would really like to relive some of those old adventures and maybe even create some new ones

Even worse, this is literally unusable
---
Because there's vanilla kill videos of every single boss and you can see how much damage attacks with set damage do. Attacks have a damage range and you can't tell exactly what debuffs are active so you can't say 100%, but it's certainly within 5%.  
---
This idea that people will start doing 40% less damage than private servers is just people talking nonsense.

Pretty sure they have old 1.12 running as a reference and try to make 7.3.5 version to emulate look and feel like the old one.

Meaning that it will feel like weird hybrid at least it looks that way to me. 
---
Either way , I can't wait!!!
---
Just chill and enjoy the content. Think of it this way, you will get more bang for the buck out of it per'se not rushing. You don't want the same feeling as you get half into an expansion and you have 10000 things to catch up on and don't know where to start.
---
On your way to 60, you can heal mostly everything just fine in shadow spec. It gets a little touchy once you hit stuff like BRD, but it's definitely doable. You will be able to reset your talents as much as you like, but there's a progressively increasing price to it. 
---
As for playing with your friends - I'd still go shadow. You don't get much out of the other trees that's worth taking while leveling, you can still heal them just fine in shadow spec, and in general, it's super hard to stick to group leveling, since vanilla has such a long way to level 60, it's addicting af and people have different schedules.
---
Don't be rude while completely missing the point. 
---
For endgame PvE most " with ranged stats" weaponry (or, at least what are hunter preferred) are among the fastest 1H (specially MHs, Hakkari MH and Silithid Claw come to mind) and hunters end up dual wielding. In close range (where most will try to be in, due to the deadzone and/or being melee) they do suck.
---
A good 2H (Ashkandi, Zin'Rokh, Bard of the Sand Reaver, Claymore of Unholy Might and Eye of Nerub are the main raid ones worth it for hunters) works better in PvP. And notice: all of them have worthy ranged stats. The same goes for a pre-raid from DM, Barbarous Blade.
---
Raptor strike is a great extra source of damage when you are close range. Frontloaded AA damage (with no swing timer!) while also being able to use your gap creating moves. A good amount of burst (up to 2k on crit, with a SV talent boosting its crit by an extra 20%) few expect to come.
---
I'd watch that clip
---
I recently levelled to 60 and the ‚Äòall potential mob spawn locations will spawn a mob‚Äô error was the most egregious imo. 
---
It was instantly recognisable that this didnt happen in vanilla, and made some quests trivial and others ridiculous hard. Especially with spawn rates feeling increased too.
---
I never played everquest but me and a friend rolled on Project 1999 and have been loving it. No nostalgia at all. Just the design philosophies of old MMOs where one has to discover things on their own is much more fun to me personally.
---
It will take a certain amount of time by the community to build up the authentic experience, in game but once it happens we'll be back in the golden ages
---
not the guy above you, but some that get mentioned a lot is the introduction of flying mounts and daily quests
---
You might also end up with a mob with 1% hp left and have to wait longer for that last attack to come. Plus a dodge/miss/parry will gimp your kill time more if you attack slower.
---
The pserver cores operate on tables, where the percentage drop rates can be customised. These values are set differently for different pservers but they all work the same way - it‚Äôs designed to deliver an overall drop rate for each kind of loot. 
---
The server generates what each mob will drop when it spawns the mob. 
---
The percentage drop rates for vanilla are mainly pulled from the old Allakhazam vanilla drop tables, which are statistically ‚Äòpretty damn accurate‚Äô thanks to the huge amount of drops data collected. 
---
Generally pservers increase the rate to make it a more enjoyable experience.
---
Cuergo's Gold quest. It's the quest you can do if you find the 3 map fragments (or buy them off the AH). You get a few random greens for it.

It's repeatable too.

im arguing against the idea that hunters highest prio when choosing a weapon for PvP is weapon speed, which is what was implied by whoever tf i originally responded to. you literally just posted the same shit i already said so
---
You'd be approx. 16 lvl. I did all the quests in all 3 Horde starting zones, and I was 16 in the end, if I remember correctly. Not so much :)
---
I see, thanks for your input!
---
My morning brain wasn't able to calculate that in my head lol
---
But I hope this clears things up atleast :)
---
You don't know what a strawman is.
---
Do you understand how percentages work? double damage is double damage. 30% speed is 30% speed. You are conflating flat damage which is **one-thousand percent** irrelevant to attack speed which modifies **weapon dps.** I can see people posting the math below and you strawmanning it to "proc on hit weapons with internal cooldowns", which is when I glance at the title about **hunter pets** and just ask myself if I have ever seen a hunter's pet roll on a Thunderfury.
---
And you have evidence that the Private servers are using values that are over 100x the values on the Allakazam site?
---
Well a lot of mob/boss values are wrong as admitted by private server creators. Armor, resistances and how abilities function are all guesswork. I'm not looking for changes in BiS specifically but there is a lot of unknowns.
---
Or in this case, like the other way around. Watching the movie first then going back and reading the book.
---
ye but thats not the argument tho OP didnt say anything about good hunter stats he just said hunters want a slow 2h weapon IN THE CONTEXT of a hunter rolling need on a fuckin corpsemaker, which is a str weapon, which is why i mentioned str
---
&gt; At what point does a warrior tank absolutely need a shield? 
---
It's the opposite : at what gear level can you drop the shield. I'd say not before T3 and only on certain fights.
---
LMGD is in the process of making a 5 man guide (As well as solo &amp; duo)
---
You may be right. I'm not entirely sure at this point.
---
Why are they broken? Where do you get 'real' data?
---
There's way too many variables to take into account to determine accurate base armor.
---
bow skill
---
Absolutely - classic will be played on mobile after all
---
I'd be surprised if half of these people ever even set foot in Naxx lol the attunement was brutal
---
Dwarves have gun racial
---
With that attitude, your mind is clearly made up.
---
Both have merits, your alliance side is very anti caster, hunter can peel and Paladin can free you. 
---
Horde side is all you as a wrecking ball, the priest and Shaman basically strive to keep you killing and keep eachother alive. Having two healers and wind fury sounds lit.
---
&gt; just ask myself if I have ever seen a hunter's pet roll on a Thunderfury.
---
It is a hunter pet
---
I quit at the beginning of TBC too, and I played one month of Legion : it's enough to hate the current game.
---
They just slaughtered the essence of the game, it became a single player game that somehow requires an internet connection to work.
---
Me Crunk, me good at math. Me no want two $5 bills, Crunk want one $10 bill. Sometimes Crunk smash goblin and goblin give Crunk 30% interest, Crunk like interest. Crunk want $10 bill so Crunk can get $3 interest. Crunk no want two $5 bills, each one only give Crunk $1.50 in interest. Why Crunk want 2 $1.50 when Crunk can have $3.00.
---
Enough with the after naxx FFS gdmf already lol. I am starting to think people are trolling it's here so much
---
The strongest, most consistent PvP build for Druids is Swiftmend + charge, which is a resto build, not feral because it offers the most long term survivability to carry flags. HotW + NS is a tradeoff between feral and resto that you might want to try out. Feral in PvP can be done but it is more gear dependand and allthough there are some PvP pieces that are very strong (or even BiS) for ferals, you also want to aquire feral gear from raids, so you want be tanking/off-tanking, not healing there.
---
As for Paladins, their strongest PvP build is healing focussed so they can help the offense to stay alive. Paladins don't have many options in terms of what is optimal. But a holy/prot pally can tank 5mans and raid trash just fine with the appropriate gear.
---
IIRC, TipsOut had talked to a private server creator and they admitted that a lot of things are wrong or guesswork. Mob abilities (the abilities themselves, when mobs use them, how they work, etc) are mostly wrong or just not present. Boss values are guesswork (armor, resistances, abilities, how debuffs work with bosses). World buffs such as Rallying Cry and Warchiefs Blessing are supposed to be on a 2hr cooldown but on pservers currently are not on a cooldown. Crafting mat timers are pretty much all wrong, although this is on purpose.
---
Why are 3 letter names wanted?
---
Lol
---
Have you been ganked in STVietnam ? What was the first thing you did once you reached lvl 60 ? :D
---
I believe that was a BC change.
---
So private server mobs are harder to kill?
---
Can you point to where they said that Tips can't make videos? He's most certainly allowed. He just doesn't have the retail vanilla experience under his belt.
---
There‚Äôs like 7 raids in vanilla and 4 of them are together, if that‚Äôs too complicated to remember I think you have bigger problems on your hands. Not to mention that‚Äôs clearly not the point of the map at all, not sure why you thinks it‚Äôs unusable because it doesn‚Äôt do something that it isn‚Äôt designed to.
---
&gt; Modern WoW is less like an MMORPG and more like a 3rd person shooter lobby game with some light RPG elements to it.
---
The randomization of stats on loot really kills the core gameplay loop of what WoW used to be.  You used to target specific items and farm them.  Now you just get "whatever" and hope your "whatever" rolls are good.
---
I think you're very wrong to say nothing is hard. Say that to the millions and millions and millions of people suffering in the world.
---
Let me introduce you this thing called: sarcasm!
---
my combat rogue beat warriors on the reg 1v1
---
No, they do not.
---
I wish people would stop asking for info after naxx, you have over a year before we even reach that point. Just enjoy classic.
---
No they don't, how about we start at just releasing classic and go from there
---
Gotcha, ty for the advice!
---
If the tank knows what they're doing, they can instantly pull aggro with a shout
---
Not necessarily. There are so many variables to take into consideration it's almost impossible to tell until we have classic in our hands.
---
Oh yikes, this one is so close to the real thing.
---
It's like the more you look the worse it gets
---
I think it was TipsOut who said he talked to a private server creator and they admitted that a lot of things are just broken and a lot of things were guesswork and that they really have no clue how a lot of things work in Vanilla.
---
You are looking at this from an individual level. But a Shamans biggest strength is their group utility, not their individual healing output. If you are put into a melee group every single raid, then sure, you can get away with 21-30 resto points.
---
But if you are put into a caster group then mana tide seems to powerful to pass up. There are some classes/specs that go oom really easily in some situations like Priests in healing intensive fights.
---
There‚Äôs nothing at all indicating what you had said to be sarcasm, not sure why you‚Äôd expect people to realize that‚Äôs sarcasm when every day there‚Äôs a million comments posted that are even more stupid that completely serious.
---
What youtubers have this experience that I should listen to ? Because I played vanilla wow and Tips actually brings up a lot of valid points.
---
100% this. So exited to spend time in each zone and not stomp through mindlessly
---
I had 2 level 60 characters on US servers before EU launched, and I was a complete scrub.
---
It's now that surprising that a decent player would figure out a decent levelling route.
---
fuck that, the retailers should burn at the stake for their insolence!
---
There is, the "literally unusable / unplayable" is a very common meme in gaming circles.
---
No. They are easier to kill due to the lack of resistances and so on.
---
That is a great point, but to keep to the overall goal of the question, both are identical increases during the effect of the buff.
---
Assuming perfect RNG and the buff has 100% uptime, both experience the exact same increase assuming the slower and faster attackers had equal **damage per second.**
---
I like to use money as an example
---
Pick one
---
* 1$ a day for 1 week = 7$
---
* 7$ a week for 1 week = 7$
---
As you can see on a week to week basis the different incomes give the same amount of money, while the large payout feels like a big uptick on payday, you went the other 6 days with nothing. While the payout per day is smaller, it is constantly being fed to you.
---
Now here is how we simulate Frenzy. Your boss offers you 30% more pay for all wages you collect. Which method pays more per week?
---
Actually, OP hasn't said anything yet, and the comment you're referencing is just the top comment of this thread. Which is a completely different comment than the one we're having this discussion under. 
---
You came in here comparing the fucking Nicker to Ashkandi, in response to a comment that says Hunters want slow 2H weapons for PvP. Which, again, is true, but other things than speed obviously factor into the equation. Like them being actually good hunter weapons for example, which obviously corpse maker and the nicker aren't. 
---
Sleep it off mate.
---
Removing the uniqueness of Horde v Alliance
---
Flying mounts
---
Arenas were a huge flop and ruined pvp (Imo, how they were played)
---
Outlands were meh, most of the zones were annoying
---
The other people in the thread pretty much nailed it, but I didn't mind Dailies
---
Tossing epics for the first quest rewards in TBC was mildly annoying as well
---
According to this person, who seems to be knowledgeable, "Basically expect your Classic mobs to take more of a beating," means that private server mobs are easier to kill.
---
The question is by how much.  I haven't played on a private server, but from some videos I've seen, they seem to be in the right ballpark, at least.  It's likely that private server mobs are only about 10-20% easier to kill, but we really don't know for sure.
---
I'm not sure myself. I know MadSeason is a vanilla vet as he's shown pictures of himself in vanilla and has some vanilla exclusive items, but he isn't really a "Classic WoW content creator."
---
I'm pretty sure most of the popular ones like Esfand, TipsOut, Asmongold, Nixxiom, etc either didn't play vanilla or played right at the tail end.
---
How would a Paladin ever catch a hunter?
---
It‚Äôs pretty reasonable to think that someone would say that if they were upset the map didn‚Äôt have raids on it, definitely not enough alone to identify a comment as sarcastic.
---
Dude, browse more reddit and you‚Äôll understand that sarcasm is a part of it.......... nvm ,you must be fun at parties.
---
To make you happy I let you know that: this is a great map, nothing is missing definitely gonna use and see you around in azeroth.
---
Reading the disagreements in the comments, it's pretty clear this is going to happen a lot in classic. I can't wait to witness all the salt.
---
"Bag drop rates are broken. Literally over 100x the Vanilla drop rate.
---
Green, Blue and Epic drop rates are broken. These are 50x the vanilla drop rate. You‚Äôll experience a much poorer start thanks to having less to vendor."
---
Do you not know what 100x means? It might be right that they drop much more on pservers but why do you exaggerate so stupidly?
---
I recommend just healing in those dungeons honestly. I say that because as a Paladin you will be rocking some cloth/leather/mail gear. It's kind of messed up to roll against the healer for the same gear if you're tanking. It also means 0 competition on +healing drops.
---
Saying that, 5 mans really aren't too bad. If you wanted to tank them for fun you should be fine. Because of threat issues you will more then likely need to be deep prot to be able to do it though.
---
Well if TipsOut said he talked to some guy, then everything the guy said MUST be true.
---
&gt; I'll accept that, but most weapon procs have an internal cool down. 
---
**strawman**
---
Please name a single weapon proc that **hunter pets** wield?
---
NB4 "his example was melee weapons, not huntar pets" EleGiggle
---
This thread seems like an ad.. "we wrote a new speed leveling guide", spews a bunch of useless and indirect information, then happens to have a comment ask if it's a free guide, where the OP responds with a link where you can go to buy it.
---
You are a moron
---
Some 2h weapons are good for raiding Hunters though if they are incorporating melee swings/raptors into their rotation. But I wouldn't put Ashbringer into that category. Rather weapons like Zin'Rokh that have stats that help ranged damage as well.
---
That's what I think too but they all have good content, so I don't see the point in if they played or not
---
Do the Wetlands run. Don't skip it.
---
Please, not all people will burn through content fast who want to book their vacation.
---
I work in tourism, we are fucking busy during summer, I had to submit my plans at the end of March!
---
I had no other choice but to bet on mid July otherwise I wouldn't have gotten ANY summer vacation approved at all.
---
If it releases before mid July I can live with that because I will get my 2 weeks either way but fuck Blizzard if we still don't have anything by that time.
---
People are rightfully pissed.
---
Except OP is wrong about some of this. It entirely depends on the server.   
---
For example, this is not true at all on many vanilla servers:   
---
&gt;Green, Blue and Epic drop rates are broken. These are 50x the vanilla drop rate.     
---
OP is either exaggerating or only played on one vanilla server.  Not every server has these cranked up 50x.
---
&gt; Generally pservers increase the rate to make it a more enjoyable experience.
---
This might be true.   
---
But it sounds like you are guessing with your   
---
Maybe more accurate would be to say "most vanilla servers have increased drop rates" for these items.
---
I'd figure anyone who played vanilla and pserver could tell the difference between the two right away.  Real curious to see how rosy people's nostalgia paints the grind when they start getting into the lvl 30s and 40s.
---
&gt;Horde has less hunters because paladins hard counter
---
You should have added "in the 1% population that will run in premades".
---
The rest don't care about paladins.
---
There's just not the Legolas effect in the horde, that's it.
---
Oh yeah no I still view their content as well. It's just hard to accept what they think was in "Retail vanilla" because there's a lot of things that know one knows for sure and there's a lot of things where we who did play in Vanilla just have to go by what it felt like, which these content creators can't really give their opinion on as they can't know what it actually felt like because it wasn't there.
---
The thing is though, they are open and honest about whether they played retail vanilla or not. It's not like they're being fake or lying to us. I still find them extremely entertaining.
---
Which bow skill? Nelf dont have this
---
Decursive will most likely not be a working addon. The way decursive works on private servers is how it worked early in retail vanilla. It did not work like that at the end of vanilla. Blizzard hate that addon as it basically plays the game for you.
---
Pserver mobs resist spells less in my experience.
---
There are a lot of coastal mountains in Azeroth
---
Even funservers rarely (if ever) used over 50x drop rates. Already at 50x every NPC drops so many things you have trouble picking what's most valuable for you due to your bags always being full.
---
On average I found pserver mobs increased my xp/hr grinding rate about 10%, between the easier kill and mob density.
---
It's well known that people like Esfand and TipsOut have played and been top players on private servers, so it's not hard to believe that he would know a few people working on them.
---
Obviously sources have to be protected for legal reasons.
---
Is it sabers in general?  The Frostsaber meat in Winterspring was super low drop, too.
---
True but the hunt quest gives a bow, chromaggus a xbow, which guns do you want to use to take advantage of this skill?
---
Making a wow core work is an achievement in itself; there are lots of things that are beyond the scope of an average dev to make perfect.
---
Ret Pala because leveling is brain afk and you never die. PvP is also no problem only if there are 3 Horde players with higher level.
---
by OP i meant the original commenter not the OP of the thread lol
---
i made my intentions and my argument clear. im not here looking for a fight or whatever. im drunk and swearing means fuck all as far as im concerned but i know people on the internet immediately think swearing = aggro so you gotta be careful. we are, however, completely on the same page.
---
\&gt; You came in here comparing the fucking Nicker to Ashkandi, in response  to a comment that says Hunters want slow 2H weapons for PvP. Which,  again, is true, but other things than speed obviously factor into the  equation. Like them being actually good hunter weapons for example,  which obviously corpse maker and the nicker aren't.
---
this is literally my entire argument. other things other than speed factor into the equation, like them being actually good hunter weapons. anyone suggesting otherwise is fucking wrong. i.e the people saying its sound to roll on corpsemaker because hunters want a slow weapon for pvp.
---
Or, instead, people could bring some hybrids or off-specs in their raids instead of needing to min-max it for a similarly difficult and more inclusive experience.
---
You can use hunter's Beast Lore to check how inaccurate pserver data are, it's just that you need info that you can be sure is correct.
---
I know plenty of older players that played the RTS before Vanilla.  It was seen as stopping the opposite faction from growing.  Less level 60 of the opposite faction, the stronger my side grows.  Pull high levels away from farming.  Carebear can fit you though, or retail.
---
Ovbious troll is ovbious
---
Yes, it‚Äôs available from the back end tables on the cores used. I‚Äôm not a dev so I can‚Äôt use fancy language, but I‚Äôve checked this many times with a dev who is has spent the last few years working on the next overhaul of the light‚Äôs hope and mangos cores.
---
&gt; So private server mobs are harder to kill?
---
Depends. For example, take the quest: A Grim Task in Wetlands for Alliance.
---
On PrivateServers the Quest mob 'Balgaras the Foul' always spawns at the camp to the east of the Dwarven Compound. But hes supposed to have a chance to spawn there, or inside one of the 3 buildings **inside** that Dwarven Compound (making him on average MUCH HARDER to access due to you having to fight through floors of respawning elites). This in turn makes this quest super easy for groups compared to retail.
---
Then, there's another quest for these elite dwarves called: The Thandol Span. This quest sends you to the bridge to find a dead dwarf. On live the dwarves in the bridge well patrol and cannot be as easily bypassed because of this; and once you made it to the dead dwarf, turning in your quests caused you to be ambused by 2 instaspawning elite Dwarfs. This flat out doesnt happen on PrivateServers making the quest, again... super easy. Also, on PrivateServers these quests give 350 IF rep instead of the 150 its supposed to give in Vanilla.
---
All this stuff is everywhere and most people don't realize it. Once all these little inaccuracies are fixed, what you are left with is a much slower leveling time, and people unable to get exalted with factions by level 40 so they can ride different factions mounts. Its going to be a mess on the forums when people notice the differences. I reckon MANY won't be happy.
---
As you mentioned it, I remember the devs talking about mail stuff to be better.
---
They said something about the other 2?
---
The first caster (mage) in Vanilla I ever made had his first spell cast resisted.  "Well, fuck, that's not a good sign."
---
This was really confusing me too, so I went looking and found this:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0
---
&gt; New flight points can be found at Ratchet and Marshall's Refuge, Un'Goro Crater.
---
Flight paths added between: 
---
. . .
---
Cenarion Hold - Un'Goro Crater
---
Gadgetzan - Un'Goro Crater
---
Very nice Guide. Thanks for sharing it!
---
 I got two questions, on both I know the answer for my pserver but do no know how it actually was in vanilla:
---
Revenge: 315 + threat from damage + 25 threat on stun proc
---
 -&gt; Bosses are mostly immune to the stun. Does it nevertheless generate those 25 threat?
---
Will Demo Shout (and also Battleshout) generate full aggro after the first shout when spamming?
---
It‚Äôs not an exaggeration at all. The percentages come from assessing the drop rate count of a range of items on vanilla, via allakhazam, vs the droprates defined in the pserver core tables. 
---
It sounds like a ludicrous number, and it is. 
---
What it is not, is an exaggeration.
---
Depends heavily on if there's any other tanks online. If I've been spending the last half an hour looking for a tank and they're the only ones online, I'll take what I can get
---
How long do you need to be offline for rested xp to actually matter?
---
If you are subbing only to play classic you are still paying for a sub, it's the same thing
---
Paladin is only self harm while solo. They are gods in a group.
---
&gt; According to this person, who seems to be knowledgeable, "Basically expect your Classic mobs to take more of a beating," means that private server mobs are easier to kill.
---
He means the opposite. Hes saying they will take more of a beating before dying. Meaning expect them to be tougher. They resist less, and have less armor and block/evade less is what he is insinuating.
---
fully expect to see a bunch of twitch emotes running around killing boars dude
---
This is my biggest issue followed closely by scaled enemies.
---
A level 111 doing more damage than a 120 in a normal dungeon?  Get the hell out of here.
---
Also, ALL the items are 1 of 4 available skins?  Oh but don‚Äôt worry, transmog will put a band-aid on that real quick.
---
I just want an epic to look and feel epic.  Not like some Diablo 3 gear.  (D3 is fine doing that because that‚Äôs it‚Äôs shtick now.)
---
The "guy" he spoke to worked on the code for the private server in question. And that guy is readily available on Discord if you want to ask him yourself... not sure why you are pretending this information isn't trustworthy. Tips wasn't the first to bring this to light, the Nost devs are very open and honest about how they achieved things.
---
Married with kids now.. Won't be sacraficing my time with them to play as much as I did in the vanilla days. Will play at my own pace and have fun (late night gaming when I can). Probably won't see much of the end game though I doubt, but I'm OK with that! It's all about the friends I'll make along the way and the times shared for me.
---
Just because his sarcasm is on a whole new level, one that your reading comprehension cannot grasp, does not make him a moron. That was kinda uncalled for.  
---
@WoWords  
---
You seem like a nice guy, see you in Azeroth!
---
Bizzard doesn't report sub numbers anymore since WoD, I highly doubt they will start again with Classic.
---
The shared sub makes a lot of sense from a business perspective, it gives retail players something to try during content droughts so they may not unsub like they usually do, and give those who find they don't like Classic a chance to try retail, so they may stay as well.
---
It also give a chance to those who want to pay their sub with gold to farm retail for it, nothing shady about it.
---
Annnnnnnnnnd this is the second post like this I‚Äôve read in the last few hours.
---
Use the freaking search function. The horse is dead. Stop beating it please.
---
Here‚Äôs the big, vital, super duper important question.
---
Who cares?
---
He's talking about bag drops (like 6 slot bags in the early regions) and from the pservers I played that definitely seems true. Every character I started had all bag slots full with 6 or 8 slot bags within the first 15 levels, and often some additional bags to vendor.
---
Ill be honest. I played vanilla, an unhealthy amount. But 12 years later when i tried Nost.... I couldn't tell all the small stuff. I knew some stuff was off. Like how fast I leveled... but identifying the minute details 12 years later? It was hard man. There were entire spells I had forgotten about like Soothe Animal
---
You should always sap the less risky target, and without improved sap, your tank needs to not be a mouth breather, it‚Äôs actually very simple: 
---
You distract the whole pack of mobs
---
You sap the designated target 
---
As the sap animation is going of, the tank should be charging in and battle shouting, this is more than enough threat to pull initial aggro away and the rogue should take zero hits.
---
i always found that retarded AF, esp considering that feral druids do not lose CP when they lose target. I just dont see the reason why they implemented this, and only for rogues.
---
it is fooken annoying even in leveling, because you "cant" spam /tar macros while nuking some low lvl mobs (unlike with any other class)
---
Twitch streamer/youtuber references.
---
Asmonbald, Esfan, etc
---
Right? Blizzard will be able to see who's playing what. It doesn't matter what the shareholders think.
---
You think you do but ... :p
---
Your comment replying to mine:
---
 **A mob has a set HP. If I'm hitting bigger I'm going to hit that threshhold sooner than if I was hitting lower.** 
---
The OP's question which is an abstract because there is no **"set hp"** or **"to hit that threshold"**.
---
 **My question is; doesn't slower, hard hitting pets gain more damage out of the frenzy talent since it increases raw attack speed?** 
---
So you can see the bar set by the OP is **"gain more damage out of frenzy"**. You changed (strawmanned) the bar to "threshold" and "set hp".
---
The answer to his question is no, the benefit is equal.
---
Not meant to be toxic, just do not like the intellectual "wiggle room" given to some very clear and concise questions.
---
That wasn‚Äôt at all what made him a moron actually, him being a dick when I replied to a comment that likely wasn‚Äôt sarcasm in a serious way is a big reason though. You probably aren‚Äôt too bright either though :)
---
While exaggeration the bag drops are the most egregious difference, and I didn't start til TBC. Every pserver I'm getting more bag drops than I need, while I distinctly remember being essentially forced into crafting/buying bags on Blizzard servers. Those bag drops pre-20 are game changing - saves you a ton to spend on skills.
---
That¬¥s how I understood above text. And it¬¥s also true wenn the tank has a weapon, and shoots mob A. And you generate threat on Mob B/C/D/... before the tank does.
---
Yes, the Tank can charge and shout, but that still takes a moment longer than it takes the 2 NPC to start hitting the Rogue if the Rogue does not Vanish. You cannot always rely on the Tank to do that reliably either, or else OP would not have need to post in the first place.
---
Here‚Äôs some hard numbers:
---
Drop rates for vanilla:
---
Epic 0.002%
---
Blue 0.0035% or 0.012% for dungeons 
---
Green 0.0133%
---
Grouping up
---
Epic 0.008%
---
Blue 0.0385% or 0.132% for dungeons
---
Green 0.5389%
---
Mangos core rates:
---
Epic 0.1%
---
Blue 1.0%
---
Green 5.0%
---
Eg Flurry Axe is 0.0014% statistically vanilla
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20071031062044/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/item.html?witem=871
---
And on mangos it‚Äôs 0.1%
---
I tried Warcraft after spending a weekend watching a friend of mine play at a LAN party. He was leveling through Westfall as a priest. I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.
---
At the same time, though, if you attack more often, you will get more dodges/parries/misses so even then it rounds out to about the same.
---
&gt; Bag drop rates are broken. Literally over 100x the Vanilla drop rate.
---
This is the only one I can confidently confirm from memory. In vanilla I NEVER got bag drops. On any private server I get showered in them.
---
And it's a great deal for the parents, too. A little under $4.00 to get your lawn cut. Even lower if they paid in 6month increments.
---
This post here is a major spam issue that will arise once classic is out. People thinking they know what rates and values were like based on distant memory or feeling without any historical proof of links or screenshots to substantiate. Not defending private servers as they are just emulation, this post just reminded me people will make these type of posts stating this and that is not how they remember once classic is out, and to basically ignore them unless they give solid proof of concept.
---
That‚Äôs not a guess
---
RemindMe! 2 years
---
Oh, I'm not making any XP/hr calculations on concrete XP values from mob kills or quest rewards. Only a fool would do that. I don't remember what the XP values where in vanilla, and I don't trust pserver values at all for Classic :)
---
I'm sure for some items that is true. But in general 50x more greens? That's so ricidulous more, it would mean that you'll nearly never see a green item drop. And you'll likely never see a single bag drop because on pserver there you don't have 100+ bag drops from 1-60.
---
Proof has been given on the thread üëç
---
More importantly, you can verify it independently. 
---
Here‚Äôs one more: pserver respawn time is 6.5 mins. Vanilla respawn time is 5 mins.
---
A simple search shows 4, including this one in the last 6 days alone.

I wasn‚Äôt rude, but it‚Äôs a question that has been answered multiple times and would be remedied by using the search function.

I think what youve written or the sentiment behind it is fucking disgusting. "What private servers got wrong?". Do you know what we've had to work with? Scouting through every nook and cranny to find information to produce something as Blizzlike as possible.
---
They call them pirate servers, think playing on one is illegal and morally ducked up. Yeah

Challenge and variety of life. When I say a good healer I mean someone you know and is up to speed of what you are doing.
---
The differences are much smaller than people make them out to be. Private servers has bugs and wrong values for certain things, no doubt about that. It might take longer to level up but it won't stop anyone from reaching max level.
---
Same thing goes for raids. The private server devs know about their boss values being off thus they usually buff them in other areas such as hp or damage output. 
---
The top guilds from private servers are gonna be the first ones to 60 and the first ones to clear content. No doubt about that.
---
If you need 2 months to 60 you are not Casual keep that in mind guys.
---
2 months is the biggest wave of players. 
---
So that the majority wants to rush is gossip and only gossip.
---
The main differences are that between 2004-2006 that content was still being developed and the timeframes were based on development schedules and deadlines.
---
Fast forward to now, and the length between phases could be completely arbitrary, or it could be based upon progression goals by population percentages, or it could be time. Nobody knows, I just don‚Äôt think it has any correlation to the lengths between updates *then*
---
Saved. Thanks for sharing :)
---
Really not that long. The Onyxia attunement quest will take you close to a week, and along the way you'll get decent dungeon drops. A few more Strath runs on top of that and you'll surely be ready for MC. The main thing about MC is buying your Fire Resistance potions for Ragnaros and Arcane Resistance potions for Shazzrah.
---
There's only Larvae in AQ40. And Ashjre'thul's a bit better.
---
Do talents increase threat generated by shouts? Booming voice &amp; improved battle/demo shout?
---
Yep. That's what we wanted, which obviously that poster doesn't understand. :D 
---
Those convenience features have, at times, ruined WoW, and have simultaneously caused Blizzard to design themselves into a corner.
---
I hope this is the start of taking WoW in a new direction. Blizzard clearly knows what they've done _now_, they just feel absolutely ****ed.
---
That's why they buff them. Same with resistances. Private server devs know that they don't have accurate values so they tune them high.
---
People claiming that bosses have 0 resistances/armor are delusional.
---
To all the "After Naxx" posters:
---
You need to be in a serious raiding guild, to have Naxx on Farm.  
---
Hell even AQ40 on farm is difficult if i remember, even if you know the tactics.  
---
Let them release classic and stop shit posting about after naxx every 2 other days..... :(
---
I think he's right, I think I heard somewhere that making your children second guess punishments, not having stable expectations, no set boundaries is not good parenting. Having a "schedule" of chores or at least an expectation of doing chores for rewards is better than weird unpredictable punishments.
---
I'd like phases to be further appart in Classic than they were in vanilla.
---
Even somewhere around a factor of 1,5 or higher. If there was 100 days between two phases in vanilla, there should be at least 150 days between the similar phases in Classic.
---
The majority of the Classic community is older now and has less time to game. More time between the phases would give more time to enjoy the current content without a worry about rushing to get ready for the new content.
---
What if we went full circle and in 2020 MMORPGs are next big thing again
---
Afair, Blizz was rather strickt with they naming rules back in the day.
---
I wouldn't be surprised with the rename stick got dusted off post launch.
---
The video is three and a half years old.
---
Yeah its just a fun thing to do on the side once you reach end game on your main/other accounts.
---
Ninja one of those life saving cards into the shopping cart, when you get to the checkout "oh I'll help unload stuff onto the conveyor belt"
---
Place card on belt
---
Quickly place box of cereal on top of that box
---
Getting a cashier who asked too many questions or was slow was just bad RNG, hope you don't roll a 1 here.
---
Stand by bags to help load into shopping cart
---
Keep out of sight what isn't there
---
It was the perfect crime.
---
Do you have any links that show this information?
---
I plan on playing classic with three friends and running around the world doing questing/dungeons. I have a question about tanking/dps (warrior). Can I tank as either arms or fury with a 2H? Also, I‚Äôm not sure which spec is best for leveling, Ive heard arms because of mortal strike but is there any reason why I would want to be fury?
---
Vanilla sap will bring you out of stealth 100% of the time if you are not specced into it. Also your stealth level is pretty dog shit if you do not have points specced into it.
---
Here's a tip to sap better, you can not be seen, even with 0 tp in imp stealth, if you are directly behind the npc or player.
---
That's because it 100 % is. Title to bait in the people who will defend private servers to death as well as the ones who love to shit on them.  
---
There's a ton of people who want to become streamers youtubers content creators etc all trying to cash in on that classic wave hype to make money.
---
Three people period will do well, especially with modern conviences like voice chat services being far easier and more normalised.
---
Main thing I would consider is not competing with each other for gear. Far more scarce than pservers.
---
They'll be tweaking the current server code as well as the current client code so that they can support an both the current experience and an experience that looks like 1.xx.  Then they will have one set of data that feeds into the current servers and a different set of data that feeds into the servers that are emulating 1.xx. That way, every time they find a bug, they only have to fix it once, and it's fixed on both kinds of servers. Every time they need to change something because some software they've outsourced has changed, they only have to adjust their server code once, not twice.
---
Running two different sets of server code would be a maintenance nightmare, so they won't do that.
---
Everyone is ALMOST right.  You need a tank, healer, and dps, however you want them to be different gear types too.  Tank would be plate, healer should be leather or cloth and the dps should be whichever one the healer is not. 
---
So warrior, priest, hunter/rogue
---
Or 
---
warrior, druid/shaman, warlock/mage.
---
Something like this, that way no one competes for gear.
---
The point here is you can't get a better sample, because we don't even know who the player base is yet. People that complain about random sample bias, in a case like this are just annoying. This is a guy who made it in his freetime.
---
There‚Äôs no way to beat the decay without bonus honor from BGs. The one theoretical way is soloing faction leaders on resplendent, but these were changed to give shared honor to everyone in proximity, not just the group who tagged the mob. 
---
There‚Äôs one way though, have three or four 40 man groups from the opposite faction literally throw themselves at a single player, dying ten times, every single day, for weeks on end, without getting caught by blizzard. I‚Äôd love for certain ‚Äòcontent creators‚Äô to try this only to get banned.
---
oh, i guess im high as fuck
---
I'm confused about your guide prices? It says for the 1 - 60 guide Pre-Order, a month before release its 40$ a month? Or is it 40$ static?
---
And what exactly is it we are getting for 40$ a month?
---
I play ona wrath ps and you get absolutely melted without resil
---
stoneform i guess is just better then, for the eventual aq20/40 grind for stoneform
---
They are using the latest client. Not the 7.3.5 code. (That was just the "latest" when they froze the Blizzcon Demo code.)
---
Classic and current/retail will share as much code as possible, both client and server. This way they can use all that 15 years of work on cheat detection/prevention, integration with their company wide architecture, improved performance (yes, Classic will run *better* then the Vanilla client on modern hardware ;) and all other improvements.
---
But they integrated all necessary changes from the 1.12 code base into Classic. It'll work just like Vanilla. (Certainly closer to Vanilla than pservers.)
---
If you are interested, see these (especially the "Dev Watercoolers"): https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow (And the "Restoring History" panel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)
---
But well going to be running MC with Ironfoe on our 1H-SP-Retpaladins...  /s  
---
(Kudos for taking on the pserver crowd, I have been trying to point out their faults as well, like most using 3.0 crushing/parry/swingspeeds for bosses)
---
you have more days in phase 1, that maybe we should not count since  EU got it like 2 months later, than US.
---
I'm not really a huge fan of the Tauren on Wolfs, but who knows. As a Healer I certainly will spend a lot of time in AV.
---
Regarding Sundor Armour vs Heroic Strike: Are you sure, 8k armor is a good example? From pservers (why this does not have to be accurate) I know that bosses mostly have between 4k and 6k armor. Also your math is correct on lvl 62 mobs but for bosses (who are lvl 63) heroic strike also prevents - compared to the normal white hit - the weapon dmg from beeing a glancing blow. So I guess atleast for raid bosses HS is the better choice.
---
Happy to see something showing otherwise? Can you give an example

oh this is the exact circlejerk post that this sub will love. well done. guaranteed hundreds of upvotes and pats on the back for this opinion here. 
---
as a side note i love how a game notoriously punishing for casuals has a gigantic mass of players who want to play it casually. it‚Äôs easy to see why blizzard started trying to cater to casuals and why they ruined wow.
---
I‚Äôve posted some info and an example above.

The mangos or light‚Äôs hope repack can give you their current settings

yeah the reason i want to play vanilla is because it‚Äôs better for casuals. lmao.

What are you going to do after hitting 60? I won't be able to raid, so I plan to do some group PvP, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to enjoy that once I'll start seeing people with AQ40 and later Naxx gear.
---
you won't get exalted without handing in runecloth or the aq event
---
I want to level as a holy pally so i can heal dungeons as i level. I've been told to level as Ret and keep int gear on thr side to heal in dungeons. Is this a viable way to do dungeons? Or should i out some talents into holy also?
---
2 to 3 months is actually a pretty decent time for hitting 60, even if you play a lot. i expect people to underestimate how long it‚Äôll take. many will burnout before 60.
---
it‚Äôll take you over a year at that pace fyi.
---
It seems likely in my experience that it's mainly due to density /respawns in excess of blizzlike numbers. The actual mob hp and defense values are usually known to a high level of accuracy thanks to datamining and combat log analysis from retail vanilla.
---
every time i see one of these i can't help but get this giddyup feeling of exploring these zones again.  
---
Past 10 years i've had my fair share of private server adventures, but being able to have a character stored in Blizzards time machine, just fills me with a different flavour of nostalgia juice  
---
Can't wait for release and never have an actual level 60 within a reasonable timeframe and STILL ENJOY EVERY FUCKING SECOND OF IT. About time they realize it's all about the journey, not the fastest way to max and offline tamagochi for a number .1 higher than the currently on my character sheet.
---
Is noone gonna mention that he edited Sam as a pet... ?
---
haha wow. üòÄ. wonderful post. thank you.
---
They buffed armor iirc because all of the -armor effects stacked on pservers while they did not on original.
---
yeah gank fodder! love it.
---
I do know what you‚Äôve had to work with. 
---
I‚Äôve been working with a dev the last year helping him play test improvements to the current cores. 
---
Perhaps I‚Äôm a bit blunt in calling a spade a spade. If I said pservers suck, you would have a point. But pointing out what is wrong on the cores compared to vanilla is not so dramatic.
---
What movie is this?
---
You think X is easy? Try artificially handicapping yourself to make the comparison apples-to-oranges
---
Honestly, you will get sick of the game really quickly by doing this. My advice, just stick with one character on one faction and limit your playtime somewhat. This way you‚Äôll have much more fun and you still get some fresh air once in a while...
---
honestly this sub is like 90% casual. which is hilarious because catering to the casual crowd is what turned blizzards design philosophy away from what vanilla was.
---
Got it in one. I still run into unexpected issues assuming how a quest works.
---
yeah no self sufficient doesn‚Äôt demand that you level all professions. that makes no sense. you don‚Äôt need any profession except maybe engineering for pvp.
---
Well aren't you a delicate little snowflake.. so cute! calling people "a dick" and "moron" because he somehow managed to offend you with saying "it's sarcasm" and "You must be fun at parties"  
---
It's ok.   
---
Let's not take this any further - we'll both say stuff that we can't take back and end up not being able to talk to eachother on family dinners. :)
---
They have the 1.12 database, which is just static data, no code.  They even posted a psuedo example of it.  Anyone with any knowledge of a relational database will understand what they are talking about.
---
Think of it as versions of Word.  They found a MS Word file from 2003, but they are reading it with a 2019 version of MS Word, so they have to do a little bit to tell it how to read it correctly.
---
I hope people are supporting you guys. I'm sure when classic releases many people will be using pirated versions of your guide. Thanks for putting time into your information you are providing.
---
That‚Äôs right - I expect on Classic that resistances and so on will be working, and you will find such mobs take less damage as a result.
---
I'm really happy about this if its accurate. The harder the better imo.
---
spoiler alert: casuals are also in for a big disappointment.  when you realize your entire 1 hour playtime sesh involves one gryphon ride, one boat ride, and a run on foot to turn in one quest.
---
Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK raider here.  I came back (not sure when, before WoD) out of curiosity and quit the same day.  Got into some instance, no one talked, the tank just ran ahead, face pulled everything, and we AOEd it all down.  And this group was appropriate level as well.  No CC, no skill required really.
---
i think there will be a lot of Legolas hunters, Gimli Dwarves, that kind of thing.
---
maybe a lot of Tyrion dwarves? Pets named Rocket? 
---
and as always, you will have a lot of leeroy's, and a lot of Kungens
---
....sunder armor and expose armor have never been able to stack pservers and the rest of the armor debuffs have always been able to stack with each other....

Camping people at flight points is well and great for people who ultimately PvP for pixels they don‚Äôt really own, but even better than no skill camping, is a zone wide PvP brawl with an ever rotating cast of players to kill all day. One where you actually use PvP skills instead of killing people afk making a hot pocket and taking a piss while flying. 
---
I dunno if you can hit 14 that way, but def 10 maybe even 11-12.
---
Changed in 2.0.1 TBC pre-patch so won't be in Classic.
---
The biggest problem after leveling an gearing out in pre raid gear is going to be conflicting raid schedules.
---
If the raid resets remain on tuesday, then it will most likely be the main raid day of the week for most guilds.
---
It would be much easier to just have a same faction alt and do alt raids, because you will have to pick one guild over the other, especially if you can't find two guilds who are progressing at near the same pace.
---
Why would I not count those? I started playing then
---
It‚Äôs actually the guide I made to chase a first to 60 so I‚Äôm not releasing it until Classic nearly launches. I know it‚Äôll get pirated. Eventually we‚Äôll just release it for free down the track, same as Joana and Brian Kopp
---
It's fine. This whole progressive itemization nonsense is just elitist raiders wanting to gatekeep rewards because they care about what gear other players have for some reason.
---
MC difficulty will be roughly the same with or without progressive itemization and after that tier the stats on dungeon items is irrelevant.
---
It's a lot of work that will cause a lot of player confusion just to make a trivial entry raid slightly more difficult.
---
how do you know for sure?
---
To add to this. The world feels so much larger in classic despite it being objectively smaller. Part of this is because you can see like 5 zones away on live. Its interesting how that effects things.
---
Yup, its just nice to get supported for something you put time into. Good luck on your race to 60.
---
Let's take Dark Souls as an example - is it a hard game? Yes. Is it hard if you look up every single item to optimize your damage and how to beat every single boss? Not really. (And the game gets kinda boring by doing so)  
---
Same thing applies to Classic (if you ask me).  
---
You got a guide for every single dungeon and raid,  you have every single talent tree optimized for every single class just a few clicks away on google.   
---
If you say the game is easy, play without looking up those and come back and say "it's easy", because it's not.
---
It is weird how people just ignore the fact that old MMOs game design is completely different in most case to modern MMOs, ofc there will be people who prefer them.
---
Its like been told to stop like turn based RPGs because we've moved on to action based RPGs
---
Well they did already complain how in demo summoning demon with warlock "worked wrong". Result was that actually private servers have wrong logic and one in demo was actually correct. Further investigation revealed that way summoning works (Summoning Disorientation) was introduced in TBC, not in Vanilla.
---
I've read that many Vanilla pserver's core is actually based on TBC version of game. So I believe we will face similar things in future where people expect something because "this is how it works on pservers"
---
Me and some friends were talking about this last night. By the time we reached Westfall, we had 16 bags drop between 3 of us, which meant the 4 slot bag we got from the Old Blanchy quest was useless - something I never experienced in Vanilla on any character, as I always ended up using that bag for a few levels.
---
Hells yeah, can't wait to be on Bloodlust again.
---
because you are counting the length, how can you be so they are not counting full release ?
---
my main question was not if it was possible, the main question was if it would be the same in classic as on the private servers, i know it is somewhat possible from a video that i saw, but are all the values going to be the same in classic? 
---
i may have worded it wrong
---
If you use the upper end brackets, you get a run time quite a it longer than retail, 1018 v 777.
---
I‚Äôd like the Bwl / Zg era to last longer than it did. For PvP it was the height of balance. Dungeon blues weren‚Äôt outclassed. Hell, av and wsg rewards are bis for a lot of slots, unstoppable force has comparable top end to everything but ashkandi and r14 at that time. People can still get blown up, but a good player in blues kills am idiot in epics. Fast forward to naxx/aq gear, and the blue geared character just dies. 
---
But I also like naxx and aq Times, so I don‚Äôt want them shortened.
---
furthermore
---
So you have a dragon foot fetish? I mean I'm not judging.
---
For a company that‚Äôs owned by the...shareholders... it pretty much does matter what the shareholders think.
---
There are people I met in vanilla that I still talk to.  DAOC as well, now that I think about it. Can't say that about many games since.
---
Thats is mostly just cause vanilla as a concept is a really easy game. Your part is easy, but making sure everyone does their part is not.
---
So while the Pservers might have been wrong, the bigger problem was that we all fucking sucked when Vanilla was released.
---
All the raids will be cleared very very quickly this time around compared to how it was back in the day
---
I was just discussing this a couple of days ago. Trying to do the cauldron quests in plaguelands as well as the undercroft in eastern plaguelands is insane on pservers, too many mobs. I also feel like they respawn way too fast, I'll kill 4 or 5, stop for a drink and they are already respawning on me...
---
Is there anything wrong with that if the content is genuinely good..?
---
Say something about after Naxx one more time motherfucker. I dare you
---
Same.  Dat RN life.
---
ITT: people who don‚Äôt know shit, refuse to investigate shit, make up opinions about the product and the people who made it, who are solely responsible for classic being developed and released. 
---
Guess what, most people were never conscious of this game, and even if, it was a nostalgic afterthought. ‚ÄúYeah, I loved wow man! Great game‚Äù and that was that. 
---
The developers behind the popular builds being run today put their heart and soul into ultimately proving to Blizzard that this was worth while. It‚Äôs an organic, grass roots proof of concept, made for all of you, and this is how you shiteaters act.
---
Certain triggers are known to be wrong. Onyxias deep breath trigger is not know , but it works in a way that is not distinguishable from vanilla. 
---
And that‚Äôs what you people will never get. Backend calculations and triggers will never work the same way, that‚Äôs the nature of emulation, however the goal is always to deliver the correct end result.
---
Who gives a shit about armor values? Kill speeds for hundreds of parses have been analyzed, damage values tuned to represent what it was like back then. If your SS hits for 550 after mitigation, and it hits for 550 on the same boss in a parsed vanilla kill, who gives a flying fuck if the calculations made in order to receive that number is different, as long as the end result is the same? Because it is. It‚Äôs been proven to many times to count. Basically every time some piece of evidence shows up, be it a grainy video, combat logs or old archived sites, the numbers match up in the end in such an accurate way, you‚Äôd be a straight up idiot not to be impressed by the work these people have achieved. 
---
The truth is, by analyzing the data, the one realistic theory is that melee classes are under-tuned on private servers, bosses hit harder than they are supposed to and many bosses who had seemingly random casts (onyxia for instance), use their abilities way to often because their triggers were always assumed to be known. 
---
It‚Äôs fine to hope for a fresh experience, and for many it will be. The way people talk about the people who actually made this a reality is disgusting. Show a minimum of respect.
---
Well to be fair I don't see a link so if it is an ad it's a very odd one.
---
I don't think I ever saw more than 1 at a time.
---
Problem is.
---
Most of us dont need wowhead for classic
---
We already did it all once before.
---
We already know what to do.
---
Thank you.
---
Might be because retail is arguably in the worst state its ever been in before.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be, it‚Äôs just the only metric we have available. And for anyone who played it‚Äôs an idea of what those time spans are‚Äîfor instance I thought bwl/zg lasted longer than it did‚Äîmaybe that‚Äôs cause my server took 2 months to open gate or so?
---
That said, most of the games history has been to release content when it‚Äôs finished, it hasn‚Äôt been since wod‚Äîallegedly‚Äîwhere they‚Äôve had content finished and I never the pipe. 
---
Content will be released on all Vanilla servers at the same time. There won‚Äôt be some on phase 3 and others on phase 5. So whatever they do it‚Äôll be uniform, if it‚Äôs on avg progression, then it‚Äôll be once all regions have a completion above a certain figure, war effort and beginning aq progression will be the only server dependent thing.
---
Long cooldown makes WotF actually pretty bad racial. Sure it's fun when you have it but you do get much more use of orc's stun resist.
---
Biggest thing why WotF has been top racial for so long is arenas. And we don't have arenas in Classic so it's pretty dead racial after all. Sure it can be great in 1v1 situations but I still would take stun reduction over it.
---
Yikes, you're not a martyr.
---
I really like that map, but a few weeks ago I tried to find a more simple map in high quality for a poster. I was able to find this one using the world map in-game graphics for all zones. I only saved the link so I dont remember who to give credit, but I did not make it.
---
 [https://warcraft-games.3dn.ru/Wow/fullmap.jpg](https://warcraft-games.3dn.ru/Wow/fullmap.jpg)
---
You do realise, than when wow was released in 2004, that even by 2007 when tBC was released, very few players had actually stepped into Naxx, never mind cleared it and got the drops they want? Remember that these raids take 40 players...and you could only run them once a week. So clearing Naxx and getting most of the 40 people suitably geared never really happened even for ultra hard-core raiders.  You'd be lucky if 1-2% of the playing base ever killed Kel'Thuzad, let alone have him on farm status! 
---
So after Naxx for the General population, will take 5yrs+.
---

If retail was good classic wouldn't exist.

6 slot bag drops are a laugh. On pservers you. Gett 4 easy, but in vanilla I'd be lucky to get 2 by 20.
---
You know, I think it's finally been enough time so we won't be seeing that many Drizzt Do'urden variations.
---
Tipsout was a top player on no server ever... haha
---
A. But if you move 100km/h and add to that 30% speed = 130km/h.
---
Vs
---
B. You move 50km/h and add 30% speed = 65km/h
---
In example A you get 30km/h more speed and in B only 15km/h.
---
I'd hope that there is 3-4 months between Phase 1 &amp; 2, then they can roll out the other phases every 3 months.

Thank you for noticing &lt;3

can you also pm me on the same subject please

Is there any reason to suspect that cloth drops on private servers are also off by orders of magnitude? I'm planning to go for early wand on launch with my priest - you need about 62 linen to reliably produce enough robes to disenchant to get to ennchanting 10. On pservers, this doesn't take too long with all the defias in Elwynn. Am I going to have  a bad time if I want to apply this strategy to Classic?
---
I agree with your main post but I don't agree with your assessment on drop rates at all. The old thottbot drop rate numbers were always off and aren't really a good way to make comparisons between private servers and actual vanilla.   
---
Bags definitely did drop way, way less in vanilla though.
---
Book annual leave?
---
Sure i know that there are some on this forum (quite a few) that know pretty much everything there is to know about WoW. But for the majority of people, i think they don't.  
---
I might be wrong, but i think that most people have forgotten / gotten used to retail and without using any kind of addon / wowhead etc. to help them out, classic will pose a challenge to these people.  
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Looks so weird having eastern and western plaguelands just end in water when we know damn well it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Think of how many hours blizzard most have spent on classic to get it right, so its understandable that pservers dont get it right either. But this is the best move for everyone, we nostalgia nerds get our vanilla wow back and the pserver ppl cant finally prove themselves without getting shit because "the numbers on pservers are wrong" and they wont have to live in fear that the servers will one day close.
---
Druid because I love wPvP and bullying people in capital cities. I can stealth through IF and pick people off, heal and vanish into the shadows again. Also I like healing and being a good boy in dungeon groups
---
Nope, no chance in hell. Either you haven‚Äôt read about the honor system and how CP works, or you haven‚Äôt understood it.
---
A pserver I was on had instant level 60 and the drop rate was way over the normal. That's when I started to get suspicious that it wasn't a blizzlike vanilla server.
---
hunters are great in PVP with a good gun/bow. If we are just talking AV, WSG , Arathi basin, then yes Hunters can be great. You are easily at range of most characters, and if you are in a pack, their are many other players in front of you so you're not the 1st targeted. Also, you have a pet tearing up clothies and interrupting casting, which helps you too. 
---
Hunters have great burst DPS in pvp, and are fun to play.   
---
You should be able to be well geared, even just from PVP rewards, and as you rank up you get even more gear.

Why wouldn't you be able to raid? It isn't that difficult as people make it out to be.

You can log in, check who makes a PUG for MC or Ony in that evening, spend 1-2 hours doing it with zero preparation, loot the tier 1&amp;2 epics.

You'll be disapointed. First, because even with some error in numerical value or the Ia of some mobs, etc ... the core of vanilla fully explored. No boss will be hard, no boss will be unknown. Even if pservers are totally wrong on most datza ... millions of players played a lot to vanilla. I did clean all raids from MC to AQ40, tons of times, i can recal every steps of nearly each bosses.

Wow classic isn't here to be fresh.
---
I am counting full release, waiting till feb 05 is just waiting for translations and EU regulations to allow the game to be sold. 
---
The game was released on 11/23/04. Your market was released later. That‚Äôs like saying wow didn‚Äôt come out till June 05 cause it didn‚Äôt release in China till then.
---
Yeah definitely. Even low level elite mobs hit hard. Best / easiest way to tank is with a shield.
---
&gt; calling a spade a spade.
---
We can do the same for Classic. We'll be going into MC with a 7.3.5 client, 1.12 talents, 16 debuffs, and Naxx quality blues. 
---
We owe the emulation for getting us to the recreation. It's so easy to slam private servers in this echo chamber of support. Everyone who's played on one is aware of just about everything you mentioned, so this must be for the people who haven't?
---
Is this post *really* for private server players who are somehow NOT aware that what they're playing isn't Classic? That sounds like a nonexistent subset.
---
Cool except the best city aka Ironforge was not done proper justice.
---
Well I just guessed on that part, but I'm sure with how involved he is in the community he knows someone
---
I mean I can tell you for a fact r10 is attainable in the old system without bgs. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing whether 11 and 12 are.
---
I think most of the "I'm not going to raid because of time investment" folks will do raid once they realize low tier raiding isn't that difficult or time consuming.
---
With an average group it's a 3 hour time investment, where 1 hour is spent making the raid, where you can just AFK and do your chores.
---
Low tier raids can be done under an hour with a good group.
---
Do you reckon the image quality of this is high enough to make it into a poster? I'd love to print this off and put it on my wall.

The return of Thottbot.
---
Just want to remind the DPS, that if you're not hitting the same target as the tank you might end up tanking for a short while before you die. It's not the tanks job to taunt off every mob just cause you don't know which target to attack. She with the healer, his job is to keep tank alive, for the most part DPS should not take deadly dmg.
---
I just see so many bad DPS players blame tank and healer for their own lack of understanding the game.
---

The info above isn't useless or "indirect" (whatever you meant by indirect? idk), it's actually all for the most part true. If he's found the info because he's been researching and making a guide then by saying it here, he's just giving us the information on how he found it while also passively advertising the fact that it exists. There isn't anything wrong with that.

I'm interested in what is worth paying 40$ a month.
---
[Aged Gorilla Sinew]
---
I agree that it isn't going to be a huge deal. I've made some of these same points on Countdown to Classic podcast and in the discord for it as well.
---
What ive noticed, that newer tanks dont understand, that you should STOP spending rage well before the last mob is dead. You want to be in the 50-100 range after the mobs are dead. To give that head start on the next pack.
---
If you have a healthy aggro lead, you can just chill. Maybe use shield block to reduce damage and make sure sunders dont drop off.
---
When you have that extra rage at start, its so much easier to keep aggro on the next pack (and again generate rage from that). Tanking only 1 non boss elite is pain in the ass, you are rage starved ALL the time.
---
I'm sorry if I came off as rude. I don't mean to put the people who make these servers. What they are able to do is amazing with what they have. It's just admitted fact from the pserver developers that they have some things wrong and I'm just hoping for them to be wrong for my own selfish reasons, and I'll admit that.
---
He is utilizing it at a level where he could easily go back to rfk and farm it himself as opposed to taking it from a sham or warrior who needs it to get to the next 2h while leveling.

Here the guys shows Sunder Armor gives more threat than HS.
---
Having a few green of the  healing items is actually quite good for resto druid at start, makes the rank 3/4 healing touch spam more useful until. You get better gear
---
Rouge, because I'm aiming to a lot of world PvP ganking unknowing levelers :P
---
Yeah, fair enough. I'm interested too. $40 a month for simply just a guide by an unknown ... porn's cheaper than that.
---
Tipsout brainwashing is strong. You repeat a wrong fact you heard from a guy infamously known for being inaccurate because he barely plays and never check facts.
---
Leveling as Ret with int gear for when you want to heal dungeons is fine. In the same way as warriors should just level as arms or fury and keep a shield/1h to tank.
---
I'm super surprised nobody has mentioned shaman + warrior as the wombo combo yet. Windfury totem makes warriors exponentially better in all aspects. Damage, threat generation, rage generation. It's a crazy boost that only gets stronger as the warrior gets more gear. And the shaman himself can be a flexible role for the group. Healer/off-healer/off-dps. The third can be anything that doesnt cause gear overlap. Choose something your mate wants to play. Gotta enjoy the grind too. 
---
 A mage can crowd control/food/water/ports, huge for all aspects from leveling/dungeons/pvp.  
---
A druid can be anything the group needs too. It can use windfury as well to become viable off-damage/off-tank, it can main tank 5 mans easily and allow the warrior to be full-dps, or it can heal. Druids are super flexible, fun, and rad to level with. 
---
A rogue can use sap in dungeons and will push out great dps using windfury too.
---
Honestly I think the only bad decision would be choosing overlapping gear needs, or deciding not to take advantage of windfury.
---
Which if you do get a random "Journeyman's Backpack" you have to debate "The gold to get 3 6slots with extra silver/gold or keep it"  (Was that BOE? I don't remember, I know a lot of the lower level pouches weren't one)
---
There are more options when it comes to Hunters on the Horde, therefore more types of people may be willing to play a Hunter on Horde. That's their idea. Thing is the two alliance hunters are elves and dwarves, quintessential good guys in fantasy...
---
a good way to play it is keep the shield for the boss fights and go 2hder for the trash, especially on leveling instances. 
---
Can still do this in level 60 instances, but you may need to keep your eye on the healer and their mana. A good healer should be fine to keep a tank up without a shield on trash....and it can help to faster instances. Just swap back into 1Hder and shield for the boss fights as they can crit for a lot.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get this entire argument, 2h weapon speed (and in reality top end dmg, if it‚Äôs 354 top end but 3.1 speed, you‚Äôre still using it) is one of the lower priority stats on a hunter wep. Stam, Agi, crit, ap all seem more important than top end on a hunter melee wep.
---
You guys all talking about armor, damage etc. You are right ofcourse, but don't forget about threat! This is very very important thing in raids. Raid dps fully dependent on this. Wrong threat = wrong DPS. You may increases bosses armor, health like it were in LH but it's nothing if the threat is wrong.
---
I used to connect my sub payment to my parents phone contract. They never realized it ; - )
---
Whether of the class, i have to decide a Faction. I'm going to play a Feral dps, but i have no clue if i wanna play alliance or Horde.
---
Can you really clear ZG/MC/Ony in 1-2h? If yes, that would be doable for me.
---
My main limitation is that I won't be able to spend 3-5h playing non-stop. And some raids supposedly take that long to complete. I've decided to play a frost mage, so I wouldn't have to respec between PvP and PvE.
---
The problem with this example is that you already incorporate *time* into the equation, making it an incorrect example for the situation of the hunter pet. Try this one instead:
---
A. You drive 100km/h and add 30% speed = 130km/h
---
B. You drive 50km/halfh and add 30% speed = 65 km/halfh
---
In both examples you drive at a speed of 200 km/2h before the increase and 260 km/2h after the increase.
---
The shareholders care about one thing. Money.
---
Whether that money is coming from classic wow or retail they couldn't give two shits about.
---
Trolls have the bow skill bonus. Throwing also.
---
There's a lot to look through, at a quick glance it looks like houndmaster's bow doesn't change at all in the two images you shared.
---
It irks me to think of those out there whose passion for Vanilla WoW was only recently rekindled by Blizzard's announcement, who now sit on this subreddit disparaging the works of people who cared *SO MUCH*, they've tried to emulate the game *both of them* *love* long before there were any signs Blizzard intended to do so.

you'd have to do a lot of running about. So wasting time. You can buy 8 slot bags from vendors in cities for 50 silver, so you'd be quicker grinding and then just buying them.
---
From horde opinion, But if you did say Mulgore &amp; Durotar, and then got the zeplin to Undercity to do Silverpine, you could easily be level 15 but it'd take a long time running about. 
---
You could easily do Durotar and Mulgore (get the FPs for the area's including Org/TB/Rachet/Crossroads..... and you would still be around lvl 13-15 and could still easily farm/Skin/Fish &amp; buy bags from vendoring all the rubbish you pick up.

&gt;The "hardcore players" (read: people with time to waste)
---
If you think gaming is waste of time, you are in the wrong sub. Its not about playing casual or hardcore. Its entertainment just as anything else.
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt talking about you, but the general reputation and consensus on private servers as something negative. You had a fair point and I also want that same feeling you describe without a doubt. 
---
Its just disheartening to read so many comments literally shitting on the work these people did
---
Yeah sap is cc of last resort, fear is cc for once shit has already gone fucko and it‚Äôs a wipe if you don‚Äôt cc, so run the risk of the mob running into a fresh pack. All about that sleep, poly, shackle, trap, seduce life
---
Hi, /u/gy-psy
---
A lot of retail players are just simply addicted and can agree the game has a ton of problems. People act like retail players love retail to death and would defend it to their death. There's been a nonstop strain of complaints on r/wow since BFA released. This expansion is a mess, I'm sure more people than you realize would welcome classic that play retail.

Soul Link warlock builds are insane for solo indy PvP play-style. Watch rogues jump you, get rekt, accuse you of cheating, tell you to duel them w/out using a healthstone (it's the same as a potion, obv), balk when you ask them not to use stealth in exchange, then they pop a Major Shadow Protection Potion when things still go south. (drain life spam)
---
And you win anyway. All while being observed by the guilds' delightfully slutty druid who, it turns out, is VERY interested in duel results.
---
Goddamn, I miss vanilla. What were we talking about again?
---
A couple of things that I think classic did a lot better were class design and balancing (or imbalancing). In retail today the only differences between what classes can do is basically the colour of the pixels they shoot or the type of weapons they can swing. All of the classes have crazy sustain that make PvP into an absolute slog and solo PvE feel trivial and mindless. All of the little unique things that made classes like the hunter, warlock or the mage feel special have either been pruned, made obsolete, or given to other classes.
---
Vanilla feels perfectly imbalanced, no one class can do everything really well, is part of what forces you to make friends. PvP is over a lot faster, only healing classes can really sustain long 1v1 fights, but non-healing classes do way more damage to make up for it. PoM+pyro or ele shamans are absolutely insane for their ability to burst people down in seconds, rogues can and will kill you while keeping you stunlocked, mages and hunters can kite indefinitely. The game is not fair, and I think thats part of what made it pretty cool.
---
For tanking it doesnt matter - but please equip 1h+shield for trash atleast. 
---
Selling point of fury was the abuse of /sit macro so you can proc enrage (+25% dmg) 100% of the time. Regarding lvl 40 talents Bloodthirst (BT) and MS, BT scales only with AP, which leveling gear lacks. SO MS does more dmg cause its scales less with AP but is based on your weap speed, which BT isnt.
---
Wisdom. This is my plan for my initial character. Much of the magic is lost in any game when you let someone else play it for you which is, effectively, what min-maxing is.
---
I have no clue so probably lock or hunter lmao
---
Who's to say the addon will even work, either
---
It'll just be on and off. Did you fly to the wrong flightpath that a guild is farming for honor? Enjoy at least ten minutes escaping them or even more avoiding them if you have quests in the area. For the most part it should just be small scale stuff though, there will be a lot of people playing but the game is more than big enough to make up for that number.
---
I miss XFIRE, i would still use it today if I could. Loved it too. Showing what games u played... CSS / WoW. Music and so on.
---
My experience from vanilla was that it could happen that you found yourself in a wpvp situation that disrupted leveling... Yet, it was also the most fun I had in the game! 
---
The thrill of being hunted (and hunting!) doesn‚Äôt come for free, however, I could always find a spot where I was left alone - or I would just travel to another zone for awhile and level there. I never experienced ganking to a level where it was annoying.
---
Nah you'll be fine. You'll have bad days where there will be lots of alliance but there will be plenty of your faction around leveling with you. I'm taking my sweet time, myself.
---
You'll get ganked for sure but it's not usually bad enough to warrant a switch, even on hotbed PvP servers.
---
Will take a smidge longer but I wouldn't trade it for any PvE server, tbh. PvP server is too fun.
---
Decent guide, but the HS vs Sunder thing is totally off.
---
First off, bosses probably won't have 8k armor. Private server values are between 3.7 - 5k armor, and those are actually suspected to be HIGHER than intended. There's proof out there that KT only had about 3k armor, and a video of hunter using beast lore in Maexxna back in the day proved that armor was low there too. Nobody knows for sure, but chances are we won't have 8k armor bosses.
---
Heroic strike improves the next attack in two ways:
---
1. It makes it unable to glance (40% chance of dealing 65% damage)
---
2. Makes it crit for 220% instead of 200% if you have Impale (a pretty common spec)
---
3. The extra damage from HS can also crit for 220%
---
With world buffs, consumables, TPS gear and armor reductions stacked, HS is generally better. Especially on alliance non-humans.
---
I'm at work so I can't add math atm, but I'll probably do it later on.
---
They could be 4-5 months from release, which is a long time.
---
Oh, okay. Thank you for clearing this up. I really thought I was onto something here :D
---
There's not much to be interested in when there's nothing there yet. Just wait for release and see if you feel differently. I wish I could momentarily forget about classic's release until the day it came out
---
Yeah it‚Äôs happening to me too. But it‚Äôs not a bad thing man, hype is hype for sure. But if you actually like the game and want to play it you will get your second wind when that release date hits lol.
---
Judging by the toxic people calling him retarded in this thread, I‚Äôd say there likely are private server players who blindly believe that the servers are completely accurate.
---
OP said you can't sell them, only buy them. I dont get how that's supposed to work. Like, pay 170 gold on classic and the guy gets 1700 in retail gold? That doesn't sound like a good idea.

I've never actually played a tauren hunter, but it seems to me that their stomp should count as an additional stun/slow to let the hunter open up space. Not sure why they are so rare.
---
I'm hyped since they announced it.  
---
Every Water Cooler Dev post and or Blue post, it sparks my hyping even more.
---
Not having a release date  doesnt matter for me.  
---
Thas was the style for Blizzard a long time. its finished when its finished.
---
Makes sense from a top 500 raiding guild. Top players/elitists from both ends of the spectrum (classic/retail) are the most unlikely bunch to be interested in the whichever one they aren't playing. They're too invested/addicted to tackle the other game. Most people who will be interested are the majority who are in the middle ie. those who have quit in the past or the more casual retail players. 
---
I personally have friends who are top players on their server and take top spots in their region for M+ while disliking the state of the game, but admit they're too addicted to ever quit. They'll both try out classic for fun, but say they're unlikely to put much time into it. I think that's a common occurrence for a lot of top players.
---
Indeed. I see now there are plenty of good uses for distract in dungeons. Thanks for correcting me.
---
No, not for me, but I wish a spring  release was done. They are waiting for all the kids to be home and off school lol It does suck tauren balls there is no date tho
---
damn straight, amen!

ah, thx

exactly lol

8 alts you can send shit (that i know is worth something, some day). But i TRY to be more ruthless regarding items at start. I used to bank shit that i then "found" sitting in my bank long after i was L60. Fuck that, ill vendor everything this time, everything sub L20.
---
This list wont quite be accurate for classic, as stated in the ‚Äúcredits‚Äù, the stats in the items listed are pre-1.4+ meaning that items will be unbuffed. Most items on that list were changed in later patches, and classic wow will be using the stats the items had in patch 1.12.

i'm with you, casual asf because I just want to enjoy it with the bros... enjoy a brewski... and enjoy all the nostalgia that comes with it

From what I remember, this seems to be true.  I remember tons of spell resists in vanilla, but they're damn near nonexistent on pservers.

Im gonna make new characters and go on an all new adventure

everything on pservers is in abundance. drops, procs, xp gained, population.
---
vanilla was about being poor and dealing with the fact that you need to find a way behind lips and faps not bathing in flasks and thousands gold.
---
Yeah, legitimate criticism is obviously welcomed, but the whole sentiment the people who want private servers to be totally wrong - for any other reason than what OP described as wanting a ‚Äòfresh‚Äô game - is sad to say the least. It reeks of envy towards people who will undoubtedly have a major leg up.

Reasons why I probably will not be going hunter I guess despite playing it back in vanilla/tbc.  In TBC you got groups set up around you, in vanilla you basically are a TSA bot or just get stuck where they have room.

I had the music turned on for the early zones, and I have such rich memories with eg Tirisfal and it's zone music. I turned off the music at some point cause sometimes I find it distracting, but I regret having not heard much of it in Vanilla! I'm looking forward to it during Classic. Plus I'm playing the opposite faction so there'll be lots of new atmospheres to explore
---
I'm still fully on board the hype train, to the point of frustration as it's pushed me into that rut where you're so hyped for an upcoming game that all your current games seem boring by comparison.
---
I wish I *could* de-hype myself, but alas.
---
Heroicstrike converts the white autohit to a yellow special attack, meaning it will use a different table.
---
1. Classic is not 1.12.1 lets be clear about this as they are doing a lot of custom changes trying to improve the experience and if they didnt i wouldnt care as they wouldnt be any diff than pvt servers which have been free for ages.
---
2. Actually i find it more tempting the more they delay it as pvt servers reach naxx content they actually have better odds at enticing more players to join classic and new pvt servers will have no reason to start with the looming existence of Classic.
---
3. Looking at things from a business perspective i would say they should release a trailer &amp; announcement in June, In July they will announce a couple facts, and around the mid-end of August would be an excelent release time.
---
Might play as orange myself xD
---
Completely agree, i dunno why but i feel this is a weirdly important one.  It changed the atmosphere and look of the game and I'm sure it affected player behaviour too
---
Lets say 3 months of phase I + 12 weeks of pvp for rank 14. Thats 7 months from the launch. So at 2 years you dont have that many R14 as you claim, but you DO have people running in absolute full AQ and some in BIS NAXX gear (naxx launch 1y 7m after release).
---
Now when we are o the topic of fucking shit up. Why not change every Boss mechanics with eachother? Eg: Broodlord mechanics on Shazzrah and Shazzrah mechanics on Chrom and so forth.
---
This resets every week and no one knows what to expect until first guild clear.
---
THIS could be din huh? Yeeees
---
Must have played on a crappy private server where they were to dumb or lazy to script the bosses cos they were using a torrented Mangos Server file and it was just a tank and spank for all of the bosses.
---
Heres the thing though:
---
 Bonebiter (a very clear upgrade to both WW axe and ravager) is rewarded after beating SM cath/arm, with no reliance on drop chance. The warrior is literally going to replace their ravager once they hop over one doorway and kill mograine. There are far better alternatives that are easier to get, the weapon itself is honestly pretty memey.
---
Just get food, 4Head
---
I don't see why it would be difficult... Client requests weather for zone, server returns 'rain', client plays a sound and renders lots of grey lines falling downwards from above the player
---
ALL pservers are based on tbc.
---
Or new expansions that have a different story arc based on how many people clear the bosses etc, or whether or not enough people gather resources for the opening of the dark portal or whatever.
---
Paladins and Warlocks won't either, considering DM is not there in Phase 1.
---
The people who will find it easy will be the minority of pserver veterans who have been running this content non-stop for *years*. That's most of this subreddit.
---
Classic WoW isn't just for the ~100k or so pserver players. Vanilla had somewhere near 8 million players just before TBC launched: Blizzard will surely be banking on Classic attracting a demographic that no longer likes Retail, and is banking on that demographic being substantially larger than "active pserver players".
---
Take me for example. I quit WoW at the end of TBC, I've been very casualy playing BFA for a few months now since I learned about Classic, and I've never played a private server. I am the stereotype of the person Blizzard hopes will come flooding back into Classic in numbers far greater than pserver vets.
---
I've never done raiding in modern Retail, so I don't know whether today's BFA 20-mans are actually any harder or easier than Vanilla 40-mans, but I have done 5-mans in BFA and I don't think M10 dungeons are substantially harder than I remember Vanilla 5-mans being.
---
I did raiding in Vanilla, as far as clearing AQ40. I have not raided since. I remember my guild being able to run MC and BWL blindfolded because we had it on farm: I reckon that's exactly where pserver players are at right now, probably for *all* Vanilla raid instances. If you asked me to try to re-run them today I'd have significant difficulties remembering it all and would have to re-learn it. 
---
That's where Blizard hopes 99% of the playerbase will actually be. They've probably got research suggesting Classic will be financially viable, that it will become a second standalone game. I doubt that means they're aiming for ~100k pserver veterans being their only crowd.
---
There will be *many* (probably most) Classic players who will be seeing all these places for the first time ever, or for the first time in over a decade. They won't be breezing through this stuff.
---
Right ? The guy is literally saying that Classic MIGHT be boring to SOME people because of the reasons he listed. Which it is.  Not everyone is going to enjoy the pase of Classic and that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm still going to enjoy it.
---
No need to to start a witch-Hunt because someone on the retail-subreddit is pointing out the obvious. People are so sensitive nowadays..
---
Even if they changed some things or introduced stuff like new machanics for old bosses, times have simply changed. Information is much more widely available, shortly after Classic's release you'll be able to find a 4k60fps video showing how to complete any quest, discussing every boss mechanics etc.
---
Somehow I doubt you read my post and wrote your reply in 10 minutes. That's not what I'm arguing for at all. 
---
If it had become commonly understood how broken weapon skill was just a little earlier in WoW's history it would have been changed in 1.12 and not 2.0.1. Some changes will be necessary for the game to work.
---
Once Classic is established and has proven to be a success, I'd actually like it if they added some missing content to "the old world" instead of going to Outland. For example:
---
1. Grim Batol
---
2. Karazhan
---
3. Uldum
---
As for itemization, it would be cool if they:
---
1. Completed the "red dragon" craftable mail set for resto shamans
---
2. Improved end game itemization for enhance shamans and some other specs that need it.
---
The tricky thing is ofc to do it without breaking the game too much. Best is probably if the content was staggered similar to AQ and Naxx. I could imagine a slight increase in levels cap (63?) with the new content. Not so much as to make the old content irrelevant, but enough to add some new (lv 66?) end game bosses.
---
They weren't always. I remember playing on one before tbc launched.  It's why I subbed to retail back in vanilla.
---
Modern wow feels like a mobile game at this point
---
Blizzard has been modifying Classic to run on modern infrastructure, not just reconstructing 1.12.1. Otherwise very nicely said.
---
Because people didn't know anything about the honor system and how to abuse it. It's not even remotely relevant what people did with the game 15 years ago.
---
the questing/levelling part of the game is honestly the best thing im looking towards to
---
Ranking that is the only viable gear for pvp as a shadowpriest. There is just nothing else, as a shadowpriest player let me explain why:
---
Spriest is a total different beast. First of all, Spriest is a noob slayer class you are an monster against ppl that dont know what to do i did beat naxx geared ppl in blues, to even have a fighting chance against skilled players you need to have the same gear.
---
What dos the same gear mean ? You are not a mage , warlock or rogue, you need to Tank DMG and for a good while against good players, warlock would have the same problem but has insane amounts of stam on his t sets and has way more options.
---
So your only viable option for pvp is Ranking, to compare to t1 low bwl guys you need Rank 10, to compare to high bwl and aq40 you need Rank 13 and with naxx you are kinda fucked against good ppl.
---
Ofc you can search out pve pices to make your gear abit better, do more dmg (helps destroying noobs) but the limiting factor for shadow priest are high amounts of stamina.
---
* Warrior ; okay-ish damage early, strong CC capabilities, tank in dungeons
---
* Priest ; best healer, mandatory magic dispell, cool buffs and utilities (Fear, MC), heal in dungeons
---
* Mage ; good damage, AoE capabilities for grinding, food/water, very strong additional CC for wPvP
---
Honestly my only concern is the Ashjre'thul-&gt;Slavemaker void for hunters. 2 and 1/2 raids (add one if ZG is considered) for an upgrade option sucks.
---
I love getting camped by the opposite faction, i love how stv is aids, just like most other zones. Adds some thrill to the game having to sneak around high level players and escaping them to continue levelling.
---
I'm not complaining that he put this together at all. But he makes it sound like this is accurate data because there are a lot of answers and that's just misleading
---
Some from retail might wonder why they haven't got 3 epics and a flying mount just for logging in and consider walking from stormwind to duskwood a bit too tedious.
---
Vanilla is less social and more hardcore. Last guild i was in, the gms thought the game was like a social network not a game, they were giving space to all the the shit instead of good players, this is how wow is seen today, a way for knowing people and socializing, the game is just the excuse. Invite a friend, selfies, content for casuals and bad players... this is what the game have been turned into. Retail is a pile of crap searching to give pleasure to everyone. Vanilla was a game for players not for just people. Because there was no such thing like a "social network" at those times.
---
BC released on the 16th of January 2007, not the 9th, wot ;O
---
What if your dad enjoys mowing the lawn? Asking as a new father who earned game money mowing lawns and ended up finding enjoyment in it.
---
Maybe I'll get my son to do my tax returns for me...
---
I've done this (pservers, alliance side) and you get around 15-16 depending on how some quests rngesus %drop messes with you.
---
Not sure about individual items being nerfed, but whole metas were definitely nerfed because of specific items. E.g. I remember that, like many at the time (tbc launch), I stacked [Dragonstrike](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=28439) and [Dragonspine](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=28830). It was so op, they nerfed "haste" as a stat rather than the items themselves, lol.
---
Ever..? Yeah, tons of them, all the time. Earliest ones I could find with a quick search were in 1.2.0, like Cloak of Flames:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.2.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.2.0)
---
This is not a good way to get honor on PvP servers, only on PvE servers.
---
The less time is left before the release (summer 2019), the more hyped I am.
---
Rank is based on relative honor, not absolute honor. If the one with most honor on the server only gets 1000 honor per week then 1000 honor per week (5 honor kills) is enough for rank 14.
---
&gt; there's just the right amount of....struggle? hardship?
---
I think of it as "engagement": You do not have to work your ass off at every kill, but if you stop paying attention, you get to do a corpse run. You have to pay attention to what the mob does (or what it *is*), and play accordingly - something that is *completely absent* from the open world in retail at the moment. 
---
Hell, I reactivated my account recently because Classic is around the corner, and I played around a bit to see how the game plays at the moment. Leveled a warrior. Had Legion Invasion yesterday in Highmountain, figured, it's good XP, let's try the Elite quests as well. Soloed them all (because who even *is* in leveling zones any more?). Hell, didn't even move out of the Hateful Smash of the boss, because why bother? Wasn't really hurting me anyhow. Sure, it did take time, but it did not take *concentration*, the fights did not engage me on a mental level: "Oh, I need to watch out for this, how am I going to play that?" Nope, just mechanically spooling off my "rotation" for *minutes*, watching Youtube on my second monitor.
---
And that is just the tip of the iceberg; Level scaling completely annihilates any sense of progression, leveling professions are just about completely useless (unless you count turning in a few mats for a quick and easily finished world quest *useful*), at least for a non-raider (no idea if they're any use for raiders), and the fucking real-time time-gating of rep, coupled with randomization... Jesus, if nothing else, I am looking forward to being able to manage my own time again in Classic! You know, where I can say "I have a few hours to kill right now, let's hammer in a few dungeons!" instead of "my entire rep is gated behind emissary quests that come up one per day, and I have to actually luck out in which one comes up, because it's perfectly possible to not get even one Emissary for the faction you *want* for *weeks* - it's such a transparent grab for my subscription time.
---
I could go on ranting for a few more paragraphs (the itemization, the stats, the dearth of visually appealing equipment, etc.), but yeah, Retail and Classic are just two completely different games. Hell, I don't even know if I would classify Retail at the moment as a game any more, it feels more like a *job* where you clock in and out to do your daily chores, peppered with a side of gambling so those chores end up being actually useful to you.
---
So, real life questing for the reward of virtual questing...
---
I tjink the idea of mobs/bosses having an stat that lowers your stats is brilliant if well done, for, as you say, infinte progression. Maybe not by mob/boss but by entire dungeons/zones to be more intuitive for players?
---
You will die some times. It won't be terrible if you play it smart. And by smart I mean completely avoid the areas where the blood flows eternally, aka instead of leveling at stranglethorn vale, to visit thousand needles, desolace etc.
---
I downloaded the Mangos Classic database from their github site and took a look and have some questions about your numbers.
---
Using the Allakhazam site you linked I pulled up Captain Keelhaul since he has a chance to drop the Flurry Axe.
---
That mob has a creature ID of 2548.
---
If you look in the creature_loot_template table under 2548 you will find 60313 which is an ID for the reference_loot_template table and it is listed as having a ChanceOrQuestChance of 0.04
---
If you pull up 60313 in the reference_loot_template table you find a list of purple world drops, one of which  is 871 (Flurry Axe)
---
There are 8 items in that list each with a chance of 0 (which I assume means equal chance)
---
1/8 is 0.125, multiply that by the 0.04% chance of getting that "world drop id" and you end up with a 0.005% chance of Captain Keelhaul dropping a Flurry Axe.
---
So I wonder where you came up with 0.1%?
---
I wish we're not going to have to wait a full year before the first BGs are introduced, that would be very anticlimactic. Or a year of only farming MC and Ony. That content would become stale very fast, especially if all the decent loots are gated behind phase 2 and 3. 
---
I don't mind waiting a few months before Naxx is released when the game has already multiple raids and battlegrounds to offer and enjoy, but I would prefer if the early content up to BWL was rolled in quickly to offer a nice, full package of activities for all kinds of players to ensure players retention and fun past the first couple months' hype. Vanilla is a community driven game and I would hate for the community to leave early because the end-game content is too scarce, especially the PvP scene.
---
im gonna try warlock because i main it on retail &amp; want a new experience (played a hunter back then) most likely will cap warlock and work on decent gear then level another character. My goal is to char cap everything
---
We've been playing this game since 2004 and there are still alot of things we find new every day. Everyone have grown skillwise, thats why retail WoW feels easier but it isn't.
---
The content clears in BfA are faster since everyone been getting better at the game. Why would this make any different on new content in Classic post-naxx? Why would it be different if changes would be made on items and spells?
---
#nochanges
---
I will continue my question [in that thread then](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bilz2d/what_private_servers_get_wrong/em1p5t3/)
---
Sure, I think for PvE it would make sense if all the mobs in a dungeon has the same amount of mitigation.
---
Not using external sources and playing the game as is isn't a handicap. Not reading quest text, not using anything other than white gear, etc - those are handicaps. Simply playing the game as it is given to you is the baseline.
---
The more you know!
---
You want big crits ? You want mild survivability ? You want class fantasy ? Yet you want a raid spot ? Oh boy do I have the class for you!
---
Yeah that was one thing they got wrong, but 99 other things that were reported on the demo, were actually wrong from vanilla.
---
Decay applies to your ranking points. Your ranking points are based on your relative standing to others. Nobody has access to BGs so your relative standing doesn't work any differently.
---
Oh really? I thought that was confirmed in one of the screenshots showing the new settings, my bad in that case.
---
Hunter Druid Warrior.  
---
Hunter provides aspect of the pack for running around, he also has track for the creeps/npc's you need to kill and can pull from range if the mobs are contested.  Druid with spirit gear will basically make sure that nobody runs out of life or mana, therefore you won't have downtime when leveling. Warrior can bodytank and can grind endlessly as long as he has life which the druid provides.  
---
As for PVP: Hunter and druid have a ton of snares, binds and stuns so stuff won't run away from the warrior. They also both have enough mobility to run away from the enemies.
---
Spirit of Aquementas
---
All of this is like automatic and not visible to the player, so it is just spam buttons faster you can and if you lose agro, taunt and hit that mob harder you can XD. Focusing the same mob of the tank is also a good idea. There was an affix in Legion, tank would lose all the thread on a certain mob randomly. Guess what you had to do?
---
what is that?
---
What are the professional bonuses? Is they exists?
---
Really don't see why you would need more than 10 character slots on a single server.
---
Yeah, I was decked out in 6-slot bags before I even made it to Orgrimmar last time I was on a nostalgic private server. They come in so many colors!
---
i also think my hyped already peaked. i am still happily awaiting the release date and the game itself, but its not that hype anymore.

**&lt;Imperium&gt; Recruiting,** Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP / wPvP Guild.
---
**Server Type:** EU-Region PvP (tho if you are from NA thats totally fine, too!)
---
**Faction:** For the Horde!
---
**Who are we?**
---
Here at **Imperium** we believe in **the journey and comradry** that vanilla offers. We share the long-time goal dream of thousands of players that wanted to make retail classic servers a reality! Since we all now have achieved that goal it is time to take the next step!
---
**In our guild we want to encourage the social aspect of the game**, aswell as playing every bit of variety it has to offer. (PvE, PvP, wPvP, Grinding)
---
Of course this doesn't mean that we want especially Grinding and Raiding to be a mind numbing auto-pilot experience. **We like to keep things fun and challenging!**
---
Putting all the above mentioned things together we created Imperium with **a simple vision**:
---
**We want to create a mature raiding and pvp community, we want to endure throughout the whole journey and we want to have the most fun possible while at it!**
---
**Who are we looking for?**
---
We are looking for a variety of people, no matter the vanilla background you have, no matter the schedule you might have, we want you to be a part of our awesome community, to enhance your and our vanilla experience, together, no matter the time you will be able to spend in the game!
---
**What are our goals?**
---
We want to clear every vanilla content and acquire all the awesome epic gear that is there. While we are at it we want to have as much **fun** as possible also doing wPvP and PvP so the Alliance will get to fear us! We want to create a strong bond between our members **making the journey an unique experience**!
---
**What do we expect from you?**
---
We want to create **a mature guild environment**, meaning you should at least be 20 years or older. You should have played vanilla and **not be totally new to the vanilla-era**. This does NOT mean you need to have cleared every possible raid content!
---
If you are new to the class you will be playing on retail classic that is totally fine. It would be awesome though if you are **willing to improve on your class**, this can of course be done in conjunction with your respected **class-leader, who will be able to guide you**.
---
**Participation** on our scheduled raids and if you so wish, PvP and especially wPvP activities.
---
**What will our Raid-Schedule be?** **Tuesdays &amp; Fridays: 20:30 - 00:00 CET/CEST.**

&gt;bwl on its first week
---
this gave me a chuckle, BWL will be down within no less than one and a half hours of going live.
---
The example he uses is against a level 62 mob with 8000AC and the high chance of glancing blows against a level 62 only doing 50% damage.
---
OP is specifically asking about low level dungeons, that example does not apply.
---
I really want a group to casually play classic wow with I‚Äôll be a new player but I‚Äôd still love a group to have fun with and learn with. If anyone is interested let me know. (24m)
---
Well yes but when you meed a member of the opposing faction you want to kill him because he will kill you later on. This starts a cycle of revenge where all other players in the area get sucked in and it results in a brawl where you kill em all then get killed and so on. Isnt this why we play?
---
Mage cause they literally give me everything I need.   Take levelling out of the equation cause life at 60 is all that matters in my opinion.
---
I place a high value on PvP and they are one of the few classes that can do everything combined with engineering.  You don‚Äôt even need to cast that much to do well against other classes. Just spam fire blast and cone of cold off cooldown and use your engineering items and you‚Äôre golden.    Even against warlocks who counter mages, I beat them regularly by outplaying them and coming prepared.   What clenches this class for me over the lock is that I can deal with Melee a bit easier than when playing a lock.  When I duel  a good rogue as a lock it‚Äôs quite a hassle, but as a mage the fight is significantly easier
---
Go for dwarf for a bonus usefull raid skill: fearward
---
They didn't exist in vanilla!
---
I'll never run with a loot council guild again.  Horrible terrible frustrating experience.
---
Very very cool!!
---
Bad wording on my part. Your weekly RP decay is 20% of your current RP total, my point is that without decay, you could manage incremental gains by wpvp each week. I don‚Äôt buy that there‚Äôs realistically enough available honor through pvp kills alone combined with time (1 week) to earn enough RP to even beat the decay once you start reaching higher ranks. 
---
And yes it is relative to all other participants, but there are still defined break points for each rank and in theory there needs to be enough honor farmed server wide to reach each specific rank, this was proven with how low pop servers couldn‚Äôt even support a single r14.
---
Resto shaman. Main has been disc priest for years but for vanilla I‚Äôm going back to my roots. The offensive healer; my kinda playstyle. Always need r shammys for raid so finding a spot won‚Äôt be difficult. A million tools in the spellbook: interupts, grounding totem, tremor for my non-forsaken buddies, purge, slows, poison cleansing. I‚Äôm gonna miss dispel but the rest of the kit makes up for it.
---
I wonder if the same thing will happen as it did with runescape, by oldschool surpassing RS3 on active players.
---
Given a random deck that belongs to your class, only classic cards, each time you play - and that‚Äôs it. 
---
That‚Äôd be pretty awesome tbh.
---
Wielder of light.
---
Blessings and low effort healing lets you raid and netflix at same time.
---
Ret is amazing in PvP if played optimally. 
---
And oh yea
---
Ashbringer.
---
You cant stand the idea of others having 10 years of advantage over you? Sorry to tell you...
---
I've played retail wow more on than off for those 14 years, boi do i want classic wow as much as anyone else. Retail is the dumbest shit and no amount of lost effort (including even my hard earned pvp titles and elite sets) will make me blind to its short comings.
---
You want to be specia? You want to be a PvP god? You hate beeing the 5869. warrior on your Server?
---
Play the only real PvP Class, Paladin!
---
Want to do heal like a Lightforge god that you are, play Holy. 
---
Want to be invincible and go people on the nerves with your 800 Jugdement crits, play Ret.
---
Want to help you little brother farming his pathetic T0 for is Shadowstalker Rogue, play what ever because 5 man is ez!!!!!
---
Paladin the only real choice for Classic!
---
T1 works kinda well in pvp, good stamina values good set bonus, and the bow from mc is super nice to have too.
---
Lmfao dudes afraid his mythic+ group is gonna ditch him for classic
---
correction, should be available in phase 2
---
Well my priest clicked wrong on the twohander hammer in SM the warrior was so mad.  
---
Then a year later that same warrior missclicked on a 1h +healing mace from BRD.   guess karma. Wasn‚Äôt even mad only heartbroken.
---
I love my private server time 2 m8, but the above guy does not express any hate. Only what i assume he read, and it could well be true 2. Hold your horses.
---
I dunno man, they have the wrist equivalent of cankles.
---
Don't worry it's ok. Felt the same just recently. When the Classic will come out you will be overhyped again. :)
---
Found a Norwegian with money, for gold I got a few expansions and several years of gametime.
---
This is such a common myth, just like Napoleon was short and they didn't knew the earth was round untill after the discovery of America... The didn't just guess, the Nost team and the follow up developer's of the Nost used resources from old video and guides to make get the values as close as possible to the original. Alot of them will be spot on don't think otherwise.
---
Thats exactly why i cant find joy in the current state of the game.
---
I played on a german classic server for a while.
---
I farmed BRD with my rogue like 50 times to get that damn trinket. (the german name was "Hand der Gerechtigkeit" so i assume its "hand of justice" in english?)
---
Was it a huge time invest? yes.
---
Did it make me incredibly happy to finally put hands on that trinket? Fuck yes.
---
On retail i got that mythic weapon from taloc on my ret paladin. i dont even remember the name or felt happy with that weapon.
---
 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild
---
**Introduction**  
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded. One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment
---
**Expectations from members**  
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.
---
**Raid information**  
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
Contact Wolfie#2101 on discord for more information!
---
I corpse camp the same level warriors even at 60
---
The guy who heals you
---
Yeah, but that means their punches weigh more. Profit
---
Blizzard always said they want to recreate, reimagine Vanilla. And the only changes we have seen so far were due to technical limitations or to avoid massive amounts of development. I dont see why Blizzard wouldnt use the original time frames - even though I personally would be in favor of longer phases
---
We'll see, it is to early to call that. Maybe the only classic players will be members of this sub.
---
You can always find some bias, unless you've a crazy funded study. Even the polls for election have bias.
---
Also studies from gaming groups and tribes, confirms gamers that play the games are a lot alike, and you could easily use that argument, against the bias argument. Yes maybe Reddit represent the more "hardcore" fans, but who knows, when there isn't any information about who will play classic.
---
Small population servers just don't have 13000 or 12500 rank points brackets, meaning even if you somehow gained 1 trillion honor on small pop server you would not gain rank 13000 points.
---
Rank points do not require any certain point of honor, it is 100% relative to what others are gaining.

The Stock Price often reflect the future of the Company. You dont Think the shareholders are interested about that 1 million players are playing the version with cash shop or the version without it?? Really??

I see this and realize i will get bored in phase 1 and 2, after that not so much but in the first phases only having molten core and onyxia to raid legit blows since the gear here isn't that great and molten core is the worst vanilla raid too imo.
---
Can you link the source of that?
---
Sorry but TipsOut isn't a viable resource to base your opinion on. He has been wrong about alot of things in the past.
---
Warcraft 3 remastered, Halflife 3, diablo mobile.
---
Ever since that post about Hunters needing to include melee for an optimal rotation (Jury still out on that, to be fair) it will make Hunters one of two classes that use 2-handers for PvE DPS.
---
Just saying. :D
---
Well with so much overlap, how would they really be able to differentiate? Maybe that's their plan, to make the old game the same sub as the  new so shareholders can't tell.
---
I've managed to recapture the feeling a number of times playing private servers. Certainly not as intense, but very much there.
---
&gt;From Patch 3.0.2 (14-Oct-2008): Slam now suspends the weapon swing timer rather than resetting it.
---
So, according to Blizzard, Slam used to reset the auto attack swing timer before Patch 3.0.2. But because I'm bored, I did exactly as you asked. Installed a swing timer addon and did an experiment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBn71E8N8do
---
To get a baseline of auto attack, I auto attacked (and nothing else) for 3 minutes with a 3.0 speed weapon. It gave 57 casts. Pretty close to the expected 60 result. Maybe lag variation. Skip to 3:10 for the stats.
---
Then I repeated the 3 minute combat, this time using Slam. This time auto attack only hit 37 times. 20 auto attacked lacking. Skip to 6:10 for the stats.
---
Several possible reasons for this result:
---
1. Slam does reset the auto attack swing. Just as expected.
---
2. User error. I don't Slam "immediately following a auto attack" as you call it. Please provide an example of you using perfect Slam rotation, meaning you get the SAME amount of auto attacks, no matter you use Slam or not.
---
3. Experiment error. Something wrong with &lt;undocumented server&gt;. Or something wrong in the experiment. I did intentionally not spec Flurry, since that would obviously introduce large variation in the results. I didn't spec Improved Slam, since having a 1.5cast instead of 1.1 highlights the issue easier.
---
4. Something else.
---
Either way. If Slam does reset auto attack like everything indicates, and like every guide suggests, then I just wasted 15 minutes proving something that everyone already knew. Just because someone on Reddit answered a question he wasn't competent enough to answer.
---
Honestly, it is a good thing that you are not obsessed with checking the sub every day. Maybe you get hyped again when we have a release date. If you have more important things going on in your life when the game drops it is perfectly fine. Classic isnt going anywhere you can jump into it anytime after release.
---
Yes
---
Its 2019, how are u still having to do that? American? Takes like 5mins here. I remember when it was enough of a chore to pay ppl for it tho.
---
I'm kinda lucky. I quit playing at Cata when my kids came along.  I totally stumbled on the fact Classic was even a thing and was due for release this summer. I only found out about a month ago. So I'm still pretty hyped.
---
So you were their maid, practically. Brb poking the condoms with a needle.
---
I main Druid so I always have the excuse of having an inferior class when everything inevitably goes wrong.  :D
---
Based on what I've seen in both vanilla and private servers, it's pretty damn close, so don't expect any huge changes.
---
My guess is that it depends on how fast you are at leveling. If you're at the front, rushing to 60, you'll mostly encounter other players who just wanna level asap. They won't bother attacking you, as it slows down their leveling process.
---
If you're a casual player however, you'll constantly have to fear getting attacked.
---
Most left dude looks familiar. Is his name Werner and is he dutch?
---
All of the reported things were known by Blizzard though. They never claimed that everything was going to be accurate in the demo.
---
The demo was a proof of concept: look, we converted the 1.12 scripts, assets and DB in a way that we can run them in the legion client/server infrastructure. Thinking it was going to display the final state a year before release is a misunderstanding of the process.
---
Saying pserver guys, who had to rely on often undated add-on data, screenshots and youtube videos know more than Blizzard who have an actual reference client, database and quest /  NPC scripts (the latter was never available to pservers in any form, not even partial) is just disingenuous.
---
I'll play casually and I want to enjoy the journey, no stress with leveling or doing a race to 60 with friends, but I still want to level fast.
---
It really depends on what groups you get into. The raids themselves are really easy to clear.
---
What tends to take lot of time is the wipe recovery, the actual starting of the raid (getting people into the raid, getting them there, people afking, getting replacements for noshows)
---
Because of this there is a vast difference on clears between raids. If you get to the raid on time and so does everyone else, and nobody is a really bad player, then ony and the 20mans (AQ20, ZG) are cleared really fast, under an hour with an average group, easily under an hour with a semi-hardcore group. MC is a bit longer, but that can be done under 2h easily.
---
What takes more time for me personally as a regular raider is logistics: Get the world buffs early, sort my inventory, then get to the meeting place and then log off to preserve buffs. But then you can just go afk. And I don't think people will use wBuffs that often in classic (apart from DMT, which takes ~10 minutes to get)
---
Afterwards long raids are happening because: not enough signed up/showed up so we are getting randoms, incompetent raid leaders and too many wipes.
---
This is why as a casual you are better off in a hardcore guild: If you know what you are doing, you can join a hardcore guild once they got a tier on farm (like when BWL is out) and join the MC runs to gear up pretty fast, then do BWL with them once they have sorted the main raid out. At that point you can just spend 2-3 hours at most raiding every week and get your gear.
---
And if you are certain classes, you don't need many consumables. I use the cheaper versions of every consumable (mana pot, mana oil, sagefish food, etc) and can just buy them from the money that is dropped by the bosses, easily.
---
Okay, I figured as much, that they weren't HUGELY off.  I was originally going to say 10-20% but was leaning towards 20%.
---
I would never do a straight loot council guild again. I was in a LC guild, had RL friends as officers, and I think it was terrible.  New join?  Hope you don't plan on getting something, unless everyone passes.  Friction with officers/gm?  Also good luck.  I was one of 3 raiding locks, and consistently #1 of 3, but always last for lock set pieces because one of the locks was an officer and the other was his wife (who was literally garbage).  Only place I had any chance was general caster gear, but then I had to fight everyone. Fuck that.
---
You don't have to check the subreddit to be hyped, or constantly scour for information. Sounds like you were kind of obsessing and just exhausted yourself. 
---
I'm super hyped and will play the fuck out of Classic, but it doesn't mean I'm putting time into it before the actual release.
---
Warlock. He has it in his flair, but I don't know if you can see that.
---
well yea obviously but I'm not claiming that I know. That's exactly my point we don't know, it might be exactly correct to the % but this poll isn't reliable for the whole playerbase. I don't believe the argument that gamers play alike holds up at all here because the difference is mostly in information about the game. It's hard to claim that the average reddit wow classic user has the same amount of information as the average player even if they'd play the same if they did. What you're basically saying is that we don't know so this could very well be true and there's no point critiquing a poll that makes claims it shouldn't.
---
I rather keep my class than sell it. I dont want anymore portal selling compatition.
---
It's Warlock!
---
&gt;The didn't just guess
---
&gt;old video and guides to get the values as close as possible to the original
---
So they did guess. It's as accurate a guess as they could get based on the info they had, but its a guess rather than exactly the original info
---
The leveling gods themselves, you'll have heard that they suck in raids.
---
In reality? Prior to aq40 they can top 10 dps easily, they have the best epic class quest hands down, and in raids they have a rotation that actually takes skill and will keep you engaged.
---
And they can feign death to avoid having to run back a decent amount of the time if the raid wipes.
---
Oh, and they can kite. Kiting is fun as fuck!
---
You like pvp? Get ready to bait out those poor R14 warriors with good distancing. Even with no gear, some well timed viper stings alone turn a whole teamfight around!
---
I like female more to be honest, one fap per level. Thats why I level multiple orc female 1-59 and start over. Infinite faps, classic is going to be glorious and sticky...
---
Hmm, back then, spell misses showed as Resists, so it's possible the spell hit table is very slightly off on private servers.  I have seen slightly conflicting results when I try to search for what spell hit cap was like back then, even though I'm almost completely sure it went 4%/5%/17% but you could not get 100%, so only 3%/4%/16% Spell Hit from gear and talents (the ones that say "reduce chance for your spells to be resisted) did anything.
---
Try entering STVietnam as a priest and you‚Äôll learn quick enough
---
Right, the ones in Classic will be tougher, and he's comparing to private servers, so therefore, the ones on private servers are a little easier.
---
To be fair, the modern conveniences is what makes the world feel empty, bland, and effortless.
---
I don't mind the mechanics for the game being simpler, I just want a WORLD, and I want people who want to be in it with each other.
---
Hi, /u/Processthainfofast
---
Wpvp while leveling happens less than you think. Getting ganked by high levels does not happen alot.
---
Wpvp is unavoidable, but the more you commit to it the more you win. The more you win the more fun.
---
Wpvp always was in perfect balance while leveling. Not to much,  not to less.
---
Momorie could be bad or my exp comes from non active servers. I dont recall perfectly
---
It's not a myth, it's the truth. They have databases aggregated by addons, and usually undated screenshots and videos. They never had access to any kind of script data.
---
You can reverse engineer a functional WoW emulation from that, but not an accurate one. That's just impossible without being able to test your assumptions on the live game, which was not available during development.
---
The fun thing is that people who run rarely claim they are accurate, the term is "blizz-like" for a reason. We also know that the Nost guys got the Onyxia fight completely wrong, and that's despite her fight being among the best documented parts of classic.
---
Think about what that implies for the 99% of the game that weren't documented as well.
---
And yes, what they did was an educated guess. Again: without any way to falsify your assumptions, guessing is as good as it gets.
---
Given their approach to releasing content, it can be inferred those reputations and NPCs won't be available until the phase they were introduced in.
---
Like 1.12 has battlegrounds. Phase 1 does not. Which would mean the factions and vendors won't be in the game until the specific BGs are added. I'd imagine it's the same for those factions.
---
1.12 is just the reference data for patching, talents, and item budgets.
---
Personally i think classic wow is the closest a game has come to being perfect and why would it be "rose-tinted" to think so?
---
I would agree with your statement only for Pservers where Warriors have unlimited Rage Gen due to bugs.
---
This would never be the case in Original Classic.
---
Now you as Warrior expert , tell us , how much threats % increased Warriors are getting from the Gear?!
---
Let everyone see how wrong you are by answering us , make sure your answer is clear , not some another troll post!
---
Also chain heal is just the most satisfying spell in the game.
---
From the information known most of the private servers will be harder than vanilla, they amped armor values to err on the side of safety and don't allow world buffs through progression content.
---
The mechanics won't be exactly the same, but again having used DBM on private servers it seems like the cooldowns are shorter on abilities than they were in vanilla.
---
In all honestly I hope your right, but I wouldn't put any money on it = (
---
i just log out/off
---
thanks for making my point though
---
 Bring back loot lag.  Slide around town in that kneeling position.
---
It's BiS for AOE fights for a hunter
---
Wanna raid with no other expectations than using your two valuable cooldowns on other players ?
---
Wanna have a blast leveling with no downtime? 
---
Wanna be so annoying to fight in world PvP that people just generally avoid you? And if someone picks a fight, you can always just run away?
---
Wanna be able to run 5-mans as all 3 roles in a single specc? 
---
Wanna get your tier set fast because there's no one to roll against ? 
---
Well I've got the class for you, and I'm so hyped!
---
Yeah I was just making general comments
---
Shaman cause faking heals with hearthstone, totem twisting utility monster, interrupts every 6 seconds, because it's the one and only class to play. period.
---
Is there a purpose to this game other than killing fellow players who are enjoying their game? Is there a pleasure greater than the one you get from denying the pleasure of others? Feel the thrill, roll a Rogue.
---
Best male models: Dwarf, Orc, Tauren  
---
Best female models: Gnome, Night Elf, Troll
---
Tied: Human, Undead
---
It is known.
---
In general is not a problem - if you worry you can always pick a class like druid where you can stealth or run away to avoid most fights you sunny wanna take. A pally because nobody has the time
---
&gt; but he isn't really a "Classic WoW content creator."
---
  How the fuck is madseason not a classic wow content creator?  
---
  Just because you make a video every 3 hours talking to death about every possible little tidbit of info you can squeeze like tips doesn't means you're not a content creator.
---
That's the second legolas effect, before trying alliance to follow friends, I was convinced nelfs had this bow skill too lol
---
In my scenario, it very much is a case of nostalgia. 
---
I've felt a huge disconnect with WoW since Cata came out. This synced up with finishing my study and finding a new job where **no one** played WoW. Old friends quit when Cata came out. It was just a case of being thrown into adulthood and the new responsibilities that come with it. Video games were always kind of just there and I kept trying to tell myself that I was still a gamer deep down. For the past couple of months I've been playing on private servers and the initial thrill was amazing. But that high never lasted. The novelty wore off a lot after getting ganked repeatedly, grinding mobs, not finding anyone to do group quests ... I couldn't play classic casually. 
---
I wish all of you the best and although I'll still find myself frequenting this sub, classic is the square peg that can't fit into my life's hole.
---
Yeah someone got something wrong 4 years ago, so what? After literally tens of thousands of fixes and patches things are pretty damn accurate in 2019.
---
Care to share that list? Fellow resto druid:)
---
Ob. [Lonely Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M94ii6MVilw).

This but troll feet.
---
Asserting this over and over again when even the pserver core developers don't isn't an argument.
---
Did you ever think that there are inexperienced players using statless weapons?
---
 **&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn‚Äôt always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for priests and dps at the moment
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
**How to join?**
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK  
---
 , we are still in the process of setting up appropriate tabs. Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
Azeroth is a dinosaur u fool.
---
Artificially? The fuck?
---
If you never played on a PvP server you missed out on alot man...
---
I mean.. it's horde vs alliance, PvE servers are for streamers nowadays. At least in my eyes. PvP is a crapload of fun. Don't run away, watch them flee from you and your raw power. Kill 'em. Gank 'em. It's all about how long can you keep someone away from turning in their quests. Be fearless. Be a PvPer.
---
We have no idea. We don't know any of the information about the client except that it's the current engine running emulating old code. I imagine that any add ons, new or old, would require retooling or bug fixes on some end.
---
Blizzard also said they won't allow certain types of addons. You could basically make a 1 button rotation add on for certain classes and they said they don't want to enable that, but they want to allow these type of addons that interact with the game in ways they can't in modern wow on a case by case basis.
---
Liking this post so far. Moarrrrr
---
They didn't get the Onyxia fight completely wrong, that's just a false statement.
---
He took the runecloth from his mum and donated to the cause in vanilla
---
Consider the following situation, key notes are: *fear* | *mutuality* | *peace* | *betrayal* | *revenge* and *satisfaction*:
---
You're questing in Hillsbrad, somewhere near the farm fields. You notice an enemy Human doing his own thing nearby. You start to get *fearful* of an encounter, as you are not yet sure whether he is neutral or hostile. A few minutes pass and you both realize you're just there to get some questing done and not seek any unnecessary bloodshed.
---
A *mutual* feeling of *peace* gets established between both of you. As if two opposing forces can coincide together in the midst of chaos... A few more moments pass, you have since lost sight of the Human but you're now certain that he wont come for you. You've let your guard down too early, and too soon.
---
At a moment's notice, you get charged by this same Human out of nowhere with what seems to be a friend of his. The mutual peace between you has been *betrayed*. What you once thought was a like-minded being is not actively working with his ally to end your existence and establish dominance. 
---
You were easily slain;  disheartened and full of sorrow and regret. These emotions lead to intense anger and a strong feeling for *revenge*. All the questing you had planned is not put on hold. You've now gone on a straight path to bringing justice to those who deserve it, and standing up to your name.
---
You start roaming around, stalking your Human nemesis, waiting for the perfect moment to strike when he is alone, but still able to put up an honorable fight. They killed you on unfair terms, but you know fair well that the *satisfaction* you'll get from a pure one-on-one will trump any other scenario.
---
You see the opportunity and jump on it. With a few quick but calculated strikes, the Human was easily felled and undone. The forces of good and evil now lay dormant, having been equalized and synthesized into the pure strive of one being's thirst for survival.
---
Do you want to be so desired in raids they will literally bring 8 of you if they can?
---
Want to be loved when you are brought to a dungeon, because you bring the best support out of anyone?
---
Do you want to level in peace and not have to spend your mana buffing passing allies, yet still not be called an asshole?
---
What if I told you all 3 of your specs are viable in PvP? How does 1 amazing support spec, 1 amazing burst spec and 1 amazing luck-or-die spec sound?
---
Do you want the class that has the most buttons in the game?
---
What if you could be a nightmare for those annoying Mages (Purge+Grounding) and Rogues (Poison Cleansing+Flame Shock) to meet in a BG?
---
Want to chill during raids spamming 1 healing button during a boss fight?
---
How does 40% movement speed from lvl 20 sound?
---
Tired of the constant headache deciding between Horde and Alliance? This class gives you no choice!
---
Shaman for life!
---
&gt; Show a modicum of respect.
---
ftfy sorry to be that guy
---
Rogue, Priest, Mage.
---
The CC for fighting bigger groups.
---
Mage for kiting.
---
Rogue of big dmg and interupts.
---
And ofcource. Sap, blind and polymorph while the priest mind controls them of the edge.
---
If you are going to play dungeons (which you should, three Manning dungeons is a lot more fun than playing with a full group) the hunter party will be far superior. In the higher level dungeons you might have a problem playing with no cc. The incoming damage is immense in the start of some pulls in for example brd. With just one dedicated dps it takes a while for the first mob to go down and the healer might be forced to heal so much that he gets aggro and it becomes really hard. I played a three man party in vanilla (warrior, rogue priest) from 1-60 and I remember us having problems with the groups after the bar in brd (with the fire elementals) despite having sap. I ended up getting some FR Gear to make that place easier.
---
Madseason makes a video about classic here and there, but I consider him more of a general WoW content creator because be talks about retail just as much if not more. He's a content creator that creates classic content, but I wouldn't consider him a "classic wow content creator" as if that's the only content he makes.
---
I'm a Mount and Blade fan, at this point it's like water off a ducks back.
---
Effects from Stormstout, Trogg Ale, Raptor Punch, and Keg of Thunderbrew Lager no longer stack.
---
Will item balance like this also persist upon wow release, or is it simply stats?
---
Going through your contributions makes my posts look like the holy bible..
---
my brother is going horde but all my friends are going ally. thats why im gonna need to find a weekend only raiding guild for my horde character because my ally friends can only do weekdays.
---
Would love to know where did you buy the map, thanks :)
---
So many words and you left out what class you are referring to
---
There‚Äôs enough rep from quests in total to do this easily. The thing most people get wrong is that they calculate rep based on what you earn at 60. Rep rewards from quest decay in the same way as cap, but they have a higher floor, but I can‚Äôt remember the lowest percentage at the top of my head. 
---
You basically need to only do level appropriate quests that give preferably Darnassus reputation, but you will also need to do quests that give alliance reputation (rep to all alliance factions). 
---
The route is Teldraasil, Darkahore, Ashenvale, Stonetalon, all the quests in BFD, and supplement with quests from Feralas if you need more. You will also need to do level appropriate alliance quests around the world. This can vary depending on when you completed quests (green quest level rewards less rep). 
---
There is also Darnassus rep in Hinterlands, Felwood and Winterspring if you strayed of and didn‚Äôt make it at 40. 
---
All the morons claiming private server rep is of or inaccurate have no clue what they are talking about. This is entirely possible, but you have to do it while leveling. If you start at 60, you won‚Äôt have enough - and that‚Äôs where this myth started. At 60, you would have to do all quests, then spend weeks/months turning in morrowgrain
---
There's a retail vanilla video of fury warrior in patchwerk doing 1250 dps while lacking several buffs and having inefficient rotation, clicking his abilities and the fight lasted like 5 mins 30 seconds. The best recorded fury dps on that fight from pserver group to be unnamed is 1535 dps that fight lasted only 2 min 38 seconds. 
---
There is absolutely no question that pservers have higher armor values than retail vanilla had.
---
It pisses me off too. Those are 2 different games (one is slower, but with a greater sense of community, an exciting gearing up phase and engaging exploration, while the other is more based off fast mechanics, movements, dynamic rotations... More skilled overall) but I hate seeing people with 2/9 LFR complaining about how "easy" retail is right now, when these dumbasses are not even able to kill the first boss in mythic difficulty (the easiest by FAR).
---
I hate this "us" versus "them" mentality, as if you couldn't even possibly like both games, and recognize their individual flaws and qualities.
---
Can't you enjoy both games? If I like music, I should not be allowed to like movies according to you?
---
I am a mythic raider progressing on the last boss, I also have a quite high m+ score (and don't you dare telling me this is "easy" again if you have never done a mythic+ dungeon, because it is fucking NOT), and I will play the shit out of classic.
---
Well the Nost team thinks otherwise.
---
&gt; Ion asked us how we scripted her Deep Breath mechanic in phase 2. We described our coding and then I asked if that's how it worked and they all laughed and said no. 
---
&gt; ‚Ä¶
---
&gt; The biggest hidden thing that we dealt with is armor/resistance values for bosses. The WoW atlas has some values for these things for regular world mobs but the information on what armor or resistance values specific bosses should have is a complete mystery. The only piece of solid information I found was a screenshot of a hunter using Beast Lore on Maexxna: http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg
---
&gt; There is no way of knowing if 3731 is just the armor for Maexxna or the armor value for all bosses.
---
I'm being hyperbolic, but fact is that none of the pserver devs claim accuracy because that's an insane statement. Without a game to test your hypothesis, you can never make it past the guessing state. They are educated guesses and are enough to make a functional emulation. Some guesses might turn out correct. Many will not.
---
And WoW is a huge, huge game where nothing much is well documented besides raid and a few dungeons. The further away you stray from popular dungeons and raids the more hazy the guesses become.
---
For best armor fit I like female Orc. Thicker then humans and not hunched over like Quasimodo
---
You want to hang in Goldshire and just chill daily?

I played Warrior in the US Beta, I played Warrior in the EU Beta, I played Warrior on Release, I played Warrior on Nost, I played Warrior on Ely 
---
...and in Classic I will play Warlock. 
---
I want something somewhat new and during Vanilla I remember we were always short in Locks and they all got their T1 in Record time and we had to disenchant so much Warlock Sets, while I was 7/8 T1 for like 6 Month.
---
it might be the opposite. most private servers to my knowledge have had higher armour values on bosses than what vanilla used
---
Let's pretend it is a flat 30% dmg increase rather than attack speed, it is functionally identical when measuring flat dps.
---
Slow speed. dmg hits.  10-10-10-10-10 = 50 dmg, with the increase it is 13-13-13-13-13 = 65 dmg. 15 is 30% of 50, the 65 dmg checks out.
---
Fast speed dmg hits.  5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5 = 50 dmg, with the increase it is 6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5-6.5 = 65 dmg, identical to the slow attacker.
---
Now do not think in videogame terms, just think in math terms. 
---
30% of X = 30% of X    It doesn't matter if "X" is **expressed** as .5, or 1/2, or 50%, or 2/4 or 50/100
---
Why would the fraction 10/2 (analogy for 10 dmg every 2 seconds) benefit more from a multiplication than 5/1 (analogy for 5 dmg every 1 second).
---
After playing warhammer tabletop, DnD/NWN, and other dice games, you start to pick up on a lot of the numbers games. If it helps always relate it back to real world examples.
---
I offer you 2 singular apples or 1 box with 2 apples in it, which feeds you more? You can only eat the apples, the rest is a distraction, it is window dressing.
---
double warrior + shaman when you get windfury totem you will steamroll everything
---
Can I be the guy who blames autocorrect then?
---
No, my overview does not say that Goblin Sapper Charge can be crafted without Goblin Engineering. You most certainly need Goblin to make it.
---
**The overview is not about who makes what thing, but about who can use them.**
---
GSC requires engineering to use, but it is not BoP and it does not require Goblin spec to use, so it is not a benefit that is exclusive to Goblin spec. All you need is Engineering, since you could just get a Goblin specialist to make it for you. That is why it is not in the Goblin section of the overview.

No insults. This is an official warning.
---
GLAMORAMA (Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!
---
 
---
Classic is coming! We are already over 60 people but still recruiting all classes!
---
Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to clear all raid content, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
Our background:
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
What we offer:
---
-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and 
---
           Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid 
---
           leading
---
-          Balanced raid groups
---
-          For those interested we will run 20- 
---
           man PVE and PVP content on other 
---
            days
---
What we require of raiders:
---
-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week 
---
            40-man raids
---
-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and 
---
            knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We strongly believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be ‚Äúgeared and cleared‚Äù of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
Loot rules: We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing
---
We look forward to your application. Contact us on discord https://discord.gg/92V5CCD , send us a message or comment in the thread if you have any questions.
---
Sincerely,

Glamorama

Holy fuck there's a bunch of dumbasses in this thread
---
Hoping to see some EU Aaliance guilds postings! 15 year WoW Vet R10+ BWL cleared, Hunter Mage Warrior. Looking for my forever home !
---
You were 12, 11 or 13.
---
While the is definitely a trend starting with people having a negative attitude with "hardcore" players, I think it's partly derived from the opposite. Especially in "alternative" servers, where a large part of the population was "hardcore" players, there was very little acceptance of casual approaches to the game (weird specs, and so on). In my experience this trend carried over to the classic community in the beginning, which caused a clash when suddenly the casuals started out-numbering the veterans. 
---
Another point from my perspective is the risk of spoiling the fun for newcomers. With too much of a focus on optimal play styles, there's a risk that new players are not allowed to make their own learnings like we did back in 2004, running around in cloth spirit gear in an enhancement shaman because spirit sounded important to a spiritual class, and so on.
---
I think it becomes relevant with Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest if I recall right.

I looted this on an alt years ago and never put it on. Now I can‚Äôt find it.
---
Warcraft 3 Reforged , 8.2 (technically not a new game) and that's about it
---
&gt; Well a lot of mob/boss values are wrong as admitted by private server creators. 
---
A false rumor spread by certain content creator, who is neither retail vanilla player nor pserver creator.
---
Vanilla-I-Scream is a rather casual intended community, based in EU. It is meant to be open for both other guilds and also guild on both Horde and Alliance. So rather than being a hardcore guild focused on solely PvP in horde, it's meant to be a gathering hub for people that may want to find these kinds of like-minded people. Though the original group of the server is going to be playing Horde with the end goal of raiding but with a strong social experience on the way there. We are also going to be playing on a PvP server.  
---
There are no schedules set up for any of the raids as of now, that will all be done as we go along. The current group are all University Students or already working so the chances of it being more than 2 days a week are rather slim.   
---
Our age is around 25 but the age isn't a problem, it's all about how mature you are as a person. 
---
So what we are looking for are decent people who want to have some people to level with and then as the game progresses also partake in all the content that Classic Wow has to offer. There's no need for you to want to be a super hardcore raider and you are always welcome if you are that kind of a person too. As mentioned before, this community is more meant to gather people and let them find other people that want to do similar things. The discord server is going to be open to people who want to create branches in the already existing guild or if there are people who still want to be a part of the community but have their own rooms etc.  
---
So, Vanilla-I-Scream, Casual/Semitryhard PvE community that will play on a EU-Region PvP server. The main group will play horde but we're as said open to have 2 guilds on either side of the gap.  
---

Happy cake day
---
I do a lot of solo during the week due to work hours so I'm going Warlock. Played one in Vanilla and loved it, too.
---
Alt will either be a Rogue or Priest.
---
I mean if you don't think a whole bunch of Paladins are going to try sneaking in with a Deep Ret spec, Ret/Reck spec or Holy with juuuust a bit of Ret so they can wPvP, I daresay you are going to be (holy)shocked.
---
If you‚Äôll end up using the same raid strats in classic as on nost, it won‚Äôt matter.
---
What is it cunt

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
The threat values of abilities (if they have any non-damage related threat component) are known.
---
&gt;they do not have the original drop rate, boss damage and scaling and important things that made the game what it was.
---
You are actually deluded if you think thats why people on pservers have sick gear.
---
That's what makes me think it was legit a good topic, people are taking a few misconceptions for granted.
---
Crazy how many places you never go to even when you do all quests you can find in a region. Just looking at Eastern Kingdoms, I've never been to Grim Batol or The Fastrider Lodge in Wetlands and Loch Modan. in STV I never even knew there were ruins in the east (Aboraz, Zulmamwe)
---
Got some exploring to do tonight I guess
---
lol the exact threat every ability does was known in 2005...
---
Seeing that u enjoyed bc ret i think youll be thoroughly disappointed when picking it up for classic...leveling at least.
---
Orc is the pvp master race
---
10 per realm, 50 total. Go ham.
---
u/return_of_the_sloth already said, what I was going to say:
---
"Certain triggers are known to be wrong.  Onyxias deep breath trigger is not known, but it works in a way that is  not distinguishable from vanilla.
---
And  that‚Äôs what you people will never get. Backend calculations and triggers  will never work the same way, that‚Äôs the nature of emulation, however  the goal is always to deliver the correct end result."
---
Gankfodder, now that's a sweet name for a character
---
I've always felt that hunters were on the same tier as a Warlock when it came to gear. You'll be fun with a splash of "OK" as a fresh 60 but the moment you brush up against some gear the effectiveness and damage potential ramp up significantly, IMO. As others have suggested, you'll be a beast in R10 gear.
---
I used to play a Lock in vanilla and I found hunters to be my hardest kill, always felt it could go either way if they were geared and skilled. Any time I saw one come at me that was geared I'd be like "hey god... Me again... Listen... I'll never masturbate again. Let me kill this hunter k thanks"
---
You are deluded id you think that's going to be the norm. I never said they are not amazing players that clear content every week. I said this was not the norm and if you think private servers are 100% blizzlike you are 100% wrong. They are at best an approximation of the real deal.
---
WoW2, no. D4, yes.
---
no
---
But like, Blizz has to also, they don‚Äôt have all the OG Classic resources
---
Remember "Classic-noob", the night is dark and full of terrors.
---
Yes I can imagine it now
---
‚ÄúOverall our organic growth was 14.31% this quarter and....BTW WE‚ÄôRE NOT GONNA SHARD WESTFALL...our earnings are steady at $432 million with a good forecast of...OH BY YHE WAY WE‚ÄôRE NERFING SHAMANS AGAIN...‚Äù
---
You should hate the elfs as a dwarf, no point in being exalted with Darnassus.
---
Same here. I think it's best to embrace it. No pressure. Just do things at a nice steady pace. Best to not even think about the endgame.
---
Sorry I dont follow but curious, can you describe what the Lock summoning difference was in vanilla compared to TBC ? (I'm used to the TBC way)
---
Taurens are so cool man, all big and goofy. They always make the atmosphere better.
---
easier time on alliance with the palabuffs and you give melees a nice buff aswell. Horde want a shaman in their group
---
Aka druid
---
Farm the devilsaurs in un guro
---
Sounds like an hour well spent.
---
My 2011 iMac runs wow fine, I actually like minimum graphic settings it leaves more for the imagination! Classic will be a sure to run as well!
---
Oh I run on win7 boot camp though (faster than the OS X side last time I compared), and I have all windows animations disabled and looks like windows 95. I guess huge wpvp I might be at a disadvantage though lmao
---
Ahh the feels are too real with this one.
---
Nice post.
---
Kill x mob or escort type quests are ridiculously easy when there's always a group sitting around to join.
---
I feel the exact same as it is the most popular class and also now having more responsibilties and limited time to actually go through that steep grind again. For myself, i believe ill just have a nice easy leveling experience as mage to eventually start farming post 60 and if id ever consider going back to make a warrior alt ill have plenty of resources to work with to maybe lighten the infamous grind. But then again its fairly enjoyable as instead wasting precious time on finding members for a dungeon, you're basically in the moment you decide to. So i guess it comes down to how u want to spend your time leveling, as for late game i assume the warr population will have drastically decreased from launch pops.
---
At this time I have no post 60 plans. Maybe not even 60 plans.  I will play a few alts. Just enjoy the ride on the old game.
---
Currently an orc rogue although I may go UD, I played casters for 90% of my wow time but started to appreciate melee with Death knights, I really grew enjoy melee characters and between warrior and rogue, rogue isn't as helpless without dispels/heals.
---
It's a tough row to hoe though been playing one on a Pserver and if you don't have at least vanish and blind up you basically lose every fight unless you severely outgear the other person, my gear isn't a slouch t2 and better mostly but I feel nearly constantly disadvantaged except vs lone non SL warlocks or other rogues in bgs.
---
Hunter? mail armor, flare, trap, mark, deflect. If its just them and they choose to stick around and fight you can win this one but most of the time they trap you and wait for another person to show up, you have to blow vanish to get rid of hunters mark and it lasts forever
---
warrior, again you can win this one if they stick around and its a 1v1, but most of the time they just turtle up and you can't kill them before reinforcements arrive, and if they catch you offguard they hit so hard you will be wondering what happened
---
mage, you better be improved sprint or you don't stand a chance even then you better have prep and all your cooldowns, you will spend most of your time rooted or sheeped and wondering why you picked a melee.
---
warlock, if they are running with a felhound and aren't SL they aren't bad you can kill them without using all your cds, if they have a succubus or are SL with VW, you might get crit and die before you can do anything about it, or you might just hit them for 2 minutes before their team shows up respectively
---
shaman that are geared will just kill you with instants, they hit like a truck have mail, a shield, poison dispel totem, you can beat enhance though
---
pally, don't even bother, just CC them and move on
---
priests, you can beat, but its tough, they have big damage reduction and big damage as shadow so its tough, you oftentimes win then die to dots, healing specs are are prefered target
---
druid, again don't bother unless you need to focus down a FC, they will just outrun and root you (unless indoors then you stand a chance) ALSO FUCK FAIRIE FIRE
---
rogues, very dependant on what race they are, maybe the most race dependent mirror match?, strong cases can be made for dwarf, orc and human
---
TL;DR Despite the fact I am bad as a rogue and I usually feel like an  underdog I want to play one anyway, I feel like I am learning something all the time and there are lots of subtle interactions that play a big role in fight outcomes, I just hope I can get good enough that I feel more confident fighting more classes and that its a more of a me problem than a class problem.
---
Buy all the cheap Mats if you level fast so you can make a huge profit. Things like Small Flame Sac ;)
---
Even devs realize that you can't recreate the original impression or rediscover already discovered things. (see the last blue post regarding itemization).
---
You can bring the game back, but not the way it is played, unless you are explicitly RPing year 2005 guild. 
---
Of course it does not mean that you can not play the game casually and are forced to minmax. You literally have all the information to get optimal rotations/gearing/tactics to achieve things you were not able to achieve earlier.
---
You stated that WoW Classic won't be like private servers, but never said why. Okay, maybe WoW Classic will have a slightly higher percentage of casual players vs. raiders, but it won't be significant. The percentage of players that you see standing around in raid gear will be closer to private servers than back in the day.
---
These type of revival servers are notorious for attracting the people who always wanted to be that guy standing in Orgrimmar with Thunderfury, but they were never able to back in the day. Those people will be returning and joining raid guilds.
---
What would be artificial about it?  It‚Äôs a sub count.  
---
Furthermore, why in the world would you care at all?
---
Shaman!
---
We were similar, never could get past twin emps, though we did finish naxx redux (formed after BWL release) .  Too much deadweight, but also too much friendship to boot underperformers.  We were pretty ok with what we did, still top 25% maybe.
---
I don't actually care about the endgame. I just want to spend the next few years chilling out in a wave of nostalgia.
---
Not everyone can afford to go to school. Prick.

**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server**
---
**Introduction**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
**Member Expectations**
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are actively looking for all classes and roles, so now is the opportunity to join at the ground level and help build something special.
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Tank, Feral DPS, Heal)
---
* Hunter (BM, Mark)
---
* Mage (All Specs)
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Priest (Heal)
---
* Rogue (All Specs)
---
* Warlock (All Specs)
---
* Warrior (Tank, DPS)
---
**Raid Schedule ‚Äì Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn‚Äôt additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

This actually makes hunter really tempting.
---
There's something called a troll index. How many words is there in the reaction? Here we see 98 words of reaction, relate that to the 1 word comment. That's a 97 troll index, very high. He got what he wanted.
---
Yeah, thank you very much. I think I got a hang of it now!
---
Start with skinning and tailoring, no time wasted chasing nodes and flowers, then eventually when i'm done with my mount farm switch skinning to either enchanting or engineering and keep tailoring.
---
Incredible give this man more platinum please
---
I did say in my post that absolutely and most definitely we will have a lot of people in each server who will be top dogs of their class and faction. But dude, as someone who raided religiously and was the guild main tank, knowing that I never got Thunderfury because of drop rates/luck, I know it's just not realistic to expect every tank will have that kind of items. I never even managed to finish my T3 because of the exact same reason. but hey, if someone manages to get TF or whatever item they are targeting props to them.
---
In fact, my guild never saw a BRE drop lol. I also know there will be a lot of people coming from retail and they are in for the rudest of the awakenings. Also people that joined private servers but never really played the actual vanilla will discover it's not 100% what they expected.   
---
In no way I mean to discourage players who will want to play at their absolute best, join the best guild and farm their items until they achieve the pinnacle of their strength, more power to them!
---
The picture contains a political object, it isn't political in nature itself.
---
Have you ever seen a really cool weapon drop and thought, man I would love to snap that up but just can't justify it?
---
Have you ever had a quest trip you up and you have to shout at people running by, seeking to group?
---
Do you have issues with people getting too close to you?
---
Do you enjoy stuffing animals so full of bread that they die and then require more bread?
---
Have you ever wanted to run out of arrows and smack something with that weapon you obviously needed?
---
play hunter, pets r fun
---
*class salesman slaps top of mage*
---
You can fit so many portals in this mother fucker!
---
Question, is there something in that image that contains anything blizzard could potentially copyright? 
---
Isn‚Äôt it possible to pass this image off as genetic fantasy artwork rather than world of Warcraft artwork?
---
As far as I know, these are all the things you need a spec to benefit from. Everything else Engineering makes can either be use by everyone, or by all Engineers (assuming sufficient level and profession skill). I have boldened the things you need to maintain the spec to continue benefiting from.
---
Gnomish
---
* Gnomish Goggles - CBoP + Use (Engineering 210)
---
* Gnomish Battle Chicken - CBoP + Use (Engineering 230)
---
* Gnomish Death Ray - CBoP
---
* **Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan - CBoP + Use (Engineering 260 Gnomish)**
---
* **World Enlarger - Use (Engineering 250 Gnomish)**
---
Goblin
---
* Goblin Construction Helmet - CBoP + Use (Engineering 205)
---
* Goblin Mining Helmet - CBoP + Use (Engineering 205)
---
* Goblin Bomb Dispenser - CBoP + Use (Engineering 230)
---
* Goblin Dragon Gun - CBoP
---
* **Dimensional Ripper - Everlook - CBoP + Use (Engineering 260 Goblin)**
---
* **The Mortar: Reloaded**
---
--------------------------------
---
When it comes to your Engineering spec strategy, I think these are the crafts you should take into account.
---
It will be perfectly fine, I'd suggest starting the 2nd character after you're done with prebis on the first however or else you'll get overwhelmed fast. A lot of people on this reddit seem to think consumes take 6 days a week to farm, but realistically its like 2 hours of grinding whatever your choice of gold making is to pay for whatever you're using that week.
---
Doing anything that needs a party
---
Everything will be different this time around. My guess is more players will engage in world PvP and ganking.
---
As long you don't start shit it won't be too bad. But everyone knows what the game is now and won't spend as much time exploring since nothing is new.
---
You will definetely have, don‚Äôt worry. Mage top 3 populated classes
---
Just go for R10 or even run a lot of Dire Maul for your gear. At some point pay some gold to a guild to take you to the petrified leaf to get your Rhok'Delar and you can stay like that for a really long time.
---
Water totem quests.
---
That is why I would compare them to the Epics.
---
T1 actually doesn't have that much added heal.
---
Oh look, the mandatory post of the hour with "what if this cool thing I've been thinking about was added to the game".
---
No.
---
2 years.. For a game that was finished in 2004.. Am i the only one frustrated by this?
---
It's not an optimized List, it's just Items I can surely get, because I will tank in the beginning and play Resto later. If you Heal in the beginning, you will have naturally access to better items.
---
So not sure how useful the list is for anyone.
---
Can we get a print?!
---
Hunters who don't get Ashre'thul are truly fucked.
---
wpvp can be frustrating but thats what its meant to be... a game without thrill or risk is just a boring &amp; mundane task and that is also the reason why PvE servers always lack population &amp; activity, even worse are RP-PvE servers which rank the absolute lowest, if you then want a specific country/language-only server then the pop decreases further.
---
If you wish to avoid wpvp while leveling i would advice to look at the map and look at mob levels and stay away from common contested areas and especially roads.
---
And no it won't be bad being behind on level, you could even reach lvl 60 1-2 months after MC is cleared and still be among the best 0.1% geared players by the time BWL arrives.
---
I leveled a priest with no problems using wands and damage abilities such as smite.
---
Depends on *how many* people
---
When the best shoulder-pad models belong to you and literally all your single-hit abilities can one-shot players and mobs?
---
Gotta go Woyer.

[H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)```
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man‚Äôs, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
```Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)
---
Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!```
---
**Loot System:**
---
```Loot Council```
---
**Our Goal:**
---
```To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.```
---
**Requirements:**
---
```
---
18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)
---
Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)
---
Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)```
---

No matter how much money it is, it will be always below expectations.
---
That class quest really is the best questline in the game (after scepter of the shigting sands).
---
It's pretty reasonable to assume that you can't handle sarcasm by the way you keep commenting on this topic.
---
There's wPvP and there's straight griefing. Most people who get their rocks off on "world PVP" seem to really mean ganking lowbies and stopping people from playing. Whether the rules consider this griefing or not, it's basically trolling people and putting your enjoyment above the enjoyment of others.
---
Yup
---
You want a top tier healer in both pve and pvp? You want the ability to farm like a shit mage (but still better than most)?
---
You want to run newbies through dungeons hobb stlye? Still in your holy raid spec? 
---
Do you wanna be able to tab out to your 2nd monitor while lvling and still do max dps?
---
This is where rivalry and remembering names comes in handy. I will keep every character who so little as touched me in a google sheet.
---
a warlock in T3 killed me with a shadow bolt shadowburn and deathcoil once.
---
Do UBRS runs.
---
UBRS has crappy loot after DM and dungeon gear rebalancer (and 20-man raids) and takes more effort to do than any dungeon: you need double the manpower and you need a guy with the key.
---
Most of the loot drops at jed and rend, so people farm those and rarely do UBRS. Which is sucks when you need it for quests (Ony BWL preq, trinket)
---
Furthermore
---
Shoulders, helms and cloaks look gimp on male orc
---
You do realize that you can'y just release an online game like this 12-13 years after it's last update. 
---
Technology has advanced. It needs optimized for newer hardware. It needs to catch up to today's exploits, hacks and whatnot. It needs to be worked into their current backend. There's a lot of work that goes into it.
---
Pservers also allow you to do things like reduce boss armor to 0 with sunder armor. We have no idea if you could actually do that in Classic or if there were diminishing returns.
---
It's not like you have to maintain the hype all the way through until release - if you want to play when it goes live, make some plans &amp; then forget about it for a while - you will have more fun when it actually does come out.
---
I would think the world pvp will be a bit wild in the start because everyone is yearning for that old world pvp so it might seem a lot more prevalent than it will be later down the road. You could be able to hide from the opposing faction if you see them but unless you're getting camped I dont think dying to pvp will set you back all that much if you're just playing casually anyway
---
I actually prefer games to be delayed than games to be flawed. Especially a mmo.
---
I dont think Ive ever played on a pserver that had partial resists. Not even nost.
---
Daily post 101
---
Really?? Is there a source?
---
It was a joke (well... i hope...)
---
I've always wondered why blizzard never added a level difference thing. High levels should be able to murder and camp lowbies over and over until they physically quit the game for a few hours. One thing I've appreciated from RuneScape was high levels couldn't attack lower levels unless they were in a certain level range.
---
Yeah people scream about delays and then those same people scream and yell about the game being unfinished. Kinda silly if you ask me, delays should be encouraged so we can actually get good games.
---
What‚Äôs the other 2?
---
Take WC 2nd dungeon for horde. I generally sunder main target 1-2 times maybe throw a revenge. I don‚Äôt put full stacks of sunder up because you barely get rage in there.
---
Wanna be invited to every raid, event, dungeon, world bosses, bbq party, rock concert backstage VIP, free Mars trip from Elon and every girls phonenumber?
---
The roll healing priest.
---
EVERYBODY wanted a healing priest in vanilla, by the time my friend back then was finally got into the same guild as me (he was dps) i had already half completed my Tier 1 set.
---
It would be the easiest thing for the number-counters ever to report "X million active players on reteil, Y million on classic for a combined Z million of which there are A million unique players." No effort at all. Probably a number they can have by the press of a button.
---
No, they roll it all into one because classic will be on their WoW server landscape anyway. It will re-use the same logon-servers. It's simply easier to have it all in one sub. 
---
Pro's and Cons:
---
- If they have two subs, some people might subscribe to both, earning them more money.
---
- If they keep it as one, fewer people will un-sub since their sub just became more valuable and periods of content-drought in one game can be spent playing the other.
---
There's really nothing artificial here and it's not how management likely thinks about this.
---
Not to mention that old data can be lost. Be it because it's been deleted or some error or hardware/spftare failure.
---
That's completely normal. I would be worried if it were otherwise.
---
I am forced to play casually, cause I have a job and a family with a 3 year old son, so I think I will need about 6 - 8 month to reach Level 60. But I am very exited for that and Hyped :) :)
---
Not sure about demo but battleshout only generates threat when it applies a buff on an ally. So no need to spam. Would think the same goes for demo, that it only effects threat when applying the debuff on a mob.
---
No point to compare what occured in retail 15 years ago when they didnt have 1.12 talents and knowledge about raid tactics.
---
It's not just the hardcore pserver guys who gained knowledge. It's the average casual player, who now reads a guide, gets the best spec, gets items based on a list on that guide and downs a boss that has 0 new features.
---
To give you an example: 2 weeks ago I've killed Onyxia. I've never done that boss before. I went in, heard about the 'Deep breath' mechanic and how people argued about it for months. Safe spots and rotations weren't known.
---
As a noob healer I just followed a marked guy who knew where to go to dodge the flame and never got hit with it.
---
No
---
Cant believe you forgot:
---
You cba running back after a raid wipe and want to feign death into awesomeness?
---
In TBC they introduced Summoning Disorientation debuff. This debuff is set to your demon when you start summoning another demon. Basically it just stuns your demon so it can't do anything. If for some reason you cancel summoning it takes a while and demon is back in game (debuff goes away)
---
Now in Vanilla when you started to summon demon it already dismissed your existing demon. This means if you start to summon demon and cancel it you end up having no active demon because existing demon was dismissed.
---
Probably warrior and rogue
---
Will never happen. I think there was never a MMORPG were the second titel was really good. It is because MMORPGs have to grow and do something new and putting a 2 behind does not change anything.
---
Tbh the only way they're not insanely boring is tanking and AOE grinding and one of those is a meme.
---
There‚Äôs something very sad about people who get a kick out of making someone do a pointless corpse run.  What motivates them? Are they so lacking in self esteem that they need to jack it up with an artificial ‚Äúwin‚Äù over someone else?
---
I squat bugs in my house, but I don‚Äôt smile about it...
---
Yeah, it's pretty disgusting to read these "new" Classic fans bash everything that has to do with private servers, when in reality none of this would be happening without them. 
---
Then there are the ones talking about toxicity on private servers, yet all the toxicity I ever experience is on here from people that have never even seen a private server, but feel it's necessary to shame us that do play on private servers and call us toxic for playing how we want, yet they have no problem telling everyone else how to play the game, *AND* that the way tryhards on private servers play is the wrong way. It's stupid and ironic.
---
Easily solved. Don't put a 2 behind it ;-)
---
Sell my class? I can't even give away this prot paladin :(
---
Sure there is information. However, I don't think people are basing their choice of chars sololy on information. Everyone can use google to see the ideal PVP premade, and raid setup. 
---
My problem is, that people will call this data misleading, when there is no way to get better data.
---
NOT FAR ENOUGH GIVE ME A RELEASE DATE!
---
If you announce a release date and delay it, you've mislead your customers into believing it was ready to launch.
---
If you announce a release date and your game is unfinished, you've again mislead your customers into believing it was finished.
---
Both scenarios are entirely the fault of the developer/publisher. It's perfectly understandable that customers get annoyed with developers/publishers who cannot plan properly or shut up until its ready.
---
That¬¥s how it worked on my pserver. Is your information based in actual blizzard vanilla servers?
---
While I agree that org isn't gonna look like a t3 orgy in vanilla I think it has way more to do with scale than inaccurate values. The pserver crowd is inherently more hardcore than classic will be, and the population of these hardcore players will be dispersed over more servers and timezones than they are on pserver.
---
WoW 2 is Cata.
---
You are right, there probably will not be any further content in Classic, unless it turns out to be very popular and the community demands it.
---
I don't necessarily trust the current Dev's to come up with anything worthwhile that "fits" in the Vannila story line.. I'd rather see a new pserver project do it. The players &amp; fans will always be a step ahead in terms of creativity.
---
The biggest challenge for fan-based content would be art, though. Anyone could put a model of KT in the Kharazan Crypts (for example,) but Blizzard is able to change the actual world, make new boss skins, etc.
---
This is just another "What about after Naxx" post.
---
The price of Devilsaur leather drops massively after a couple weeks to a month. The demand will also be lower on small pop cap servers. Especially with stupidly strong 1.10 items in the game from day 1, the appeal for the Devilsaur set is much lower (1.10 Brigam/Voones is better).
---
So I'd say it's quite the opposite. If you try to get your hands on a Devilsaur spawn in the first week you'll run into a ton of PvP because the value is high, but 6 months in nobody will kill them anymore.
---
[Bonereaver's Edge](https://itemization.info/item/17076) has an exciting history. When it first came out, it's armor penetration buff lasted a full minute.  
---
Then they nerfed it. Then they buffed it. Then they REALLY buffed it.
---
Where do i sign up?
---
I'm not 100% sure, but if the warrior uses demoralizing shout, doesn't it cancel the sap ? You can get out of range for it but it's not practical.
---
Kill Prince Nazjak for the Tidal Charm
---
Pick Black Lotus in Winterspring or Eastern Plaguelands
---
Win the STV Fishing competition
---
Gurubashi arena (already mentioned)
---
Kill world bosses (only really applicable to Azuregos and Kazan as the others will be contended by multiple raids by the time they release)
---
It‚Äôs also harder to make money at AH given not enough money generated in the economy yet
---
Yeah I'm not really sure myself. I mean I get PVP is PVP but most of the time these people who talk about PVP really mean stopping lowbies from playing the game. Which is the definition of griefing
---
Personally I prefer pvp servers because a good fight is down right fun. However I don‚Äôt know why blizzard took dishonorable kills out of the game.
---
This makes sense
---
Fair enough, it just sounded interesting with a "realistic BiS list" - so got curious.   
---
Good luck to you!
---
This reaction is the point. You're making lowbie gankers happy whenever you slap a rant on chat, discord or wherever you like to ease your frustration.
---
Does a ragepot really generate only 250 thread? On my private server it was more like 5k rage
---
vanilla less social? personally I disagree. 40 man raiding, sans any kind of LFR or even group finder, is an inherently social activity. even 5 mans in vanilla took a lot more social effort than 5 mans today. having no CRZ means all your actions have social consequences too.
---
I am not a speed leveller. I am not even an average speed leveller. I am slow and plan on really investing in high quality content such as fishing! However, I still want to book time off for launch.
---
Gaming is my hobby. WoW is the part of that hobby I have invested the most time into and I want to enjoy launch of a great memory. Launch is a second chance at a once in a life time opportunity and I don‚Äôt want to miss it. 
---
The people that want time off all just want to share an experience together. That is all.
---
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?
---
As far as I understand it with my (very limited) knowledge of how this works, it isn't as simple as "booting up the old game and we're good to go".
---
The best analogy I can think of is that they've found a huge novel that they really like, but they only have 1 copy of the book available, so they're typing up the book to be able to distribute it to the masses. Obviously typing it all up and making sure there are no spelling errors etc still takes time, even if the content is already there
---
My most recent experience is from a pserver. But it alligns to with how I remember it from vanilla back in the day. I have also read the same thing in numerous guides, some which draws from original vanilla guides. Your point stands tho, that nothing I stated is necessarily true to how it actually was, but I am quite confident it is.
---
People can't not use online databases &amp; leveling guides, except for that annoying person in /trade who is always asking dumb questions instead of looking it up themselves.
---
Vanilla PvP server vet here. Going to play on PvE because I‚Äôll be playing 5-8 hours per week tops and simply don‚Äôt have time for corpse runbacks.
---
Major props for those that do, though.
---
So close, yet so far away.
---
Delayed until start of 2020 mark my words
---
I want all those things but I don't want to wear a dress
---
&gt; If you announce a release date and your game is unfinished, you've again mislead your customers into believing it was finished. 
---
Most of the times its the shareholders that are pushing.  
---
You think developers want to release unfinished games ? Most of of them do not, but nowaday this is the cultures, which i think is sad
---
The big difference here is that it doesnt matter HOW the deep breath works as long as it works just like it did in classic. If they use a completly different script that ends up doing the same who cares?
---
Private servers are pretty damn accurate already I would think. Sure there might be minor differences here and there but its nothing at all like the game would feel different.
---
&gt; I just dont see the reason why they implemented this, and only for rogues.  
---
Well, vanilla wasnt all that perfect you know. There's a reason they changed it later on - so I guess you could say that Blizzard agree with you.
---
I'm not going to treat it like WoW. I'm going to treat it like D&amp;D. Do some quests, walk around, read the dialogue, explore.
---
also don't want to be a bear or a cat or whatever, I wanna be a "humanoid" in fucking pants and chest
---
Good ole fashion blizzard is what I like to see... ‚Äúwe‚Äôll release it when it‚Äôs ready‚Äù
---
&gt; High levels should be able to murder and camp lowbies over and over until they physically quit the game for a few hours.
---
Well said.
---
What were private servers like back then?
---
What do dishonorable kills have to do with killing low levels?
---
Actually, classic was released 15 years ago. :( And they took it away.
---
They actually said that they found a complete backup of the data from patch 1.12.
---
Mushu gun from BWL isn't bad. Not that ranged weapon skills are that great though.
---
I assume ur on ND, I love this rogue cause he suck real bad so when I log, I gank him and lowbie pm me "thx men" and I feel like the man
---
Threat changes are multiplicative;
---
Defense Stance and Defiance: 1.3*1.15 = 1.495 not the 1.45 you are running with here.
---
This was changed in like 1.11 or so, previously threat modifiers were additive however it make Salv way too strong.
---
50 ap isn't anything to sneeze at, belt of neverending agony has I think 60 ap and that's the bis belt for rogues, so it's like getting a free bis item for the duration
---
That real dedication
---
I don't remember too much. I played a lock to around lvl 40 but at that time I had no point of comparison.  There were bugs if I recall some being pathing but anything more specific I can't remember. Definitely playable since it hooked me enough to start retail. This was around the time of AQ.
---
Yep pally was by far the best AOE tank of BC.
---
Well, having salvation is better than not, but ull still have to manage aggro from time to time
---
Well you only have to wear the ugly dress when raiding, the rest of the time you can wear whatever - e.g. a super cool padded robe in natural colours - or just cool leather stuff in general.
---
I don't recall it being punishing. Maybe if you were trying to compete in the endgame being casual but I didn't give two fucks about the endgame. I was there for the journey. Leveling, reading the quest text, exploring, etc. I regularly would play a character to level 30-40, get bored with it, reroll something else and start over again. That was pretty fuckin fun imo
---
SoonTM
---
That's actually the biggest bummer for me - along with having the play Tauren. I love looking at my items, and I love trolls.   
---
I'd happily play a nelf if only for the looks, and class fantasy, but I'm not gonna switch to the Alliance...
---
Or spend gold to buy runecloth and exchange bandages for rep
---
IDK.  I'm sure this will be downvoted, but you do sound butthurt.  Did you so happen to waste hours on the shit show?
---
The thing is the mouseover functionality doesnt work entirely the same as todays mouseover, so it would be a huge buff for rogues in classic if Blizzard doesnt make it so rogues lose their combo points upon interacting with another target through mouseover, or focus for that matter.
---
Have they really not grown up at all in the last 15 years?
---
Wow, it's gorgeous
---
Oh. didn't knew that. But it's still a big problem when it comes to this sort of thing.
---
Its more the fact it can be debuffed to 0 and we dont know if thats really how it works
---
Friends played horde.
---
u know, it is also possible to release finished games without delaying them.

I play a druid for its versatility. When I was younger it was perfect for me cause my attention span was so low. I could switch specs every week and play a whole new class. Having heals is awesome in so many situations and being able to fill any spot in a 5 man instance is great. And honestly I love playing a class that is underplayed. I played a moonkin and ret paladin all through vanilla and tbc it was awesome!
---
Example **Padre's Trousers** from DM are wayyy better than the updated senior designers pantaloons. So you might use those like on few MC runs, before going to DMW to grind the improved versions. If the the choices are A) progressive itemization and adding 2 months to the classic release and B) Classic release without progressive itemization (just adding the items on the proper stages)....
---
... i will always pick faster release.
---
There will always be a greater percentage of players leveling through these quests on a fresh server as opposed to later in a server's lifespan.
---
Lol could you imagine if Blizzard just stuck with vanilla WoW for all these years?
---
Mobile here. I can‚Äôt see it.
---
You are absolutely right. For some odd reason I just thought it was higher.. oh well /shrug
---
This is exactly why we haven't gotten a release date.
---
your timeline is missing 10 years

16.01.2007 - asking for classic
---
No one is saying that they hate the people from private servers. All people are saying is that blizzard, who made the game, has more information  on making vanilla accurately  than people that need to rely on videos. 
---
The nost team did a REALLY good job. But the are humans, they dont know everything, and as a result they are going to get stuff wrong compared to the person that actually made the game
---
Its like when someone is drawing a picture, and is using a different  piece of art work as reference, they can get pretty damn close, but they will never be exact
---
The progress for r13 to r14 is based on standing but it's also based on the number of players in the server. The reason so few got it on vanilla was because .1% of a 3k player server is 3 players (which would all get progression towards r14) on a server with 12k players, the top 12 players would get that progression too.

---
Hello, are you new to the Internet ?
---
I could imagine a world where they released an expansion, and just kept a few servers of classic going. Do that for every expansion.
---
Or.... A world where they didn't fuck up everything.
---
Burning Crusade was fine, because everything was the same in Azeroth. There was just more content in Outland. Now it isn't the same.
---
useful!
---
do you ptr on private servers
---
A there a set/rumored release date yet? Or is it just summer 19
---
As someone in your similar position with moving on from wow shortly after WotLK and who also been playing on pserver lately. I feel different and ultimately a positive for vanilla, it's pacing is just perfect to me. Hell, I just spent all weekend gaining 5 levels, just fucking 5! From 36 to 41 and still only half way to buying a mount. It's so awful and I love it :) 
---
The server I started on was rather fresh, less than a month old, so it's more likely for me to see other my level and getting ganked by 60's is super rare, but your typical same lvl pvp does happen in STV and other places. I did play a fuckton just to get those 5 levels so it may feel really slow with a casual approach, but I bet there will be tons of casuals on classic to keep all areas active with other players. Ultimately I'm just practicing for classic by familiarizing myself with all the questing nuances and proper order to make things more efficient. But I've been having a blast, much more than I originally thought I would. 
---
Maybe give classic a shot when it releases, and go with a PVE server(I know I will) if you don't like ganking. Maybe you'll still find fun even when playing less often and will hopefully meet many others just like you.
---
I do that remember how the macros were set up to be honest.  My guildie just posted it on the guild site and I copied it over.
---
I would just hover over the raid box and had buttons for secure and remove poison.   That's what I mainly used it for.
---
My target box, would have a green line if dude was poisoned and blue for curse I think.   It was a simple setup.
---
Druid warlock bruv
---
I don't blame Blizzard either. The best thing they can do is not tell anything until it's actually on its way to the storefront.
---
I saw one on a YouTube video of his stream.
---
He clearly enjoyed imagining the other guy rage behind his screen "lol the dude must be maaaad !!!".
---
Then he got killed by somebody else and he started to get absolutely bonkers, profanities and all.
---
If I had been in the same room than this guy, I would have tased him, just to be safe :D
---
They probably need some kind of psychiatric help.
---
rip
---
Yeah but they gave us wrath, which in my opinion made the game a million times better. Hope they re-release it after classic has ran its course. I want chaos bolts and deep freeze and bladestorm.
---
Dude the last line straight up killed me!!!
---
Yes but at the same time, on a fresh server you may have too many people, not even allowing you to kill mobs or do an escort/group quest.
---
Shut up
---
They should have done what other MMOs were doing, and offering expansions that would extend the content a bit past what was available instead of just throwing out the entire game and starting over.
---
Hahaha that's so funny!
---
Not gonna happen.
---
Of course they didn't get things 100% right, but they did an awesome job with the info they had.
---
If you prefer Mac, I can easily recommend a Macbook Pro Early-2015 / Late-2015. Playing BfA on quite low res, but it feels normal now that I've gotten used to it. Around 40 fps.
---
Playing on classic private servers I have always gotten up towards the 80-100 fps on average video settings, and I usually just lock the FPS to 60. I hope Classic will run just around those 60 fps with good settings and around 1080p.
---
Your ideas sound great, but not for classic wow. If I want more and better wow content, I can just play the actual game.
---
You know how convenient it is to play Rogue and be able to stealth past mobs, evade ganks, or ambush unsuspecting enemies?
---
You know how convenient it is to play Warrior and have priority in every dungeon group due to being a tank?
---
You know how convenient it is to play Priest and be able to heal yourself up instantly instead of eating food? Or, save your teammates from danger?
---
Imagine there is a class that does it all.

Rumored for July 16th. I'm expecting an announcement after retail patch 8.2 drops
---
Pre rank 13 gear is rank 10 gear.
---
A few people like to camp redridge on ND and you think most PvPers enjoy killing greys?
---
If your main concern is being camped by higher levels that are just trying to grief you.  Killing your mobs, your quest givers, your flight masters.
---
Yes it can and will likely happen.   Most of the time they'll just get bored after a bit.  If not, have another toon to switch to.
---
For similar level stuff, it'll happen more often than the aforementioned situation, but as said by others, it's usually fun.
---
Only after the AQ patch though, might be a year after release, who knows
---
tru, but still
---
[I'm a paladin, suck my balls](https://youtu.be/G-ZHAZv8Xk4?t=504)
---
The vast majority of times I see people talk about "world PVP" they usually talk about it in the context of ganking lowbies or killing quest givers to troll people into retaliation.  That's been my experience every time I talk to someone who brings it up.  They almost never mean actual World PVP, they mean stopping people from playing the game in the hopes that they deal with the troll.
---
So every time you see an enemy you have to look in your spreadsheet ?
---
You need an addon for that.
---
I remember in a dungeon group back in Vanilla, they were talking about something funny but I quite didn't get it. It's like I was missing some part of the sentences.
---
After some investigations I discovered that one of the guy in the group was in my ignore list but I was absolutely unable to remember why.
---
After that I installed an addon to keep track of players, mostly friendlies. I knew what to expect from the other side.
---
Except for hunters it actually is a good PvE weapon if they incoorporate white hits and raptor strikes into their rotation.
---
Cool story, your post is indirectly the same
---
I made it to full T2 before our guild... um... took an arrow to the knee.

a bit about us: I'm a 31-year old Vanilla-to-WoTLK vet chasing that same nostalgia that I'm sure a lot of you are. For the past 4 years, I've lead a tight-knit bunch of young, working adults through numerous other games and MMOs. With the impending release of Classic, many of us, newcomers and vets alike, will be teaming up for what I believe to be one of the best experiences gaming has ever offered. We're not elitists. Whether your goal is to play casually or no-life the game, you're welcome here with us.
---
Goals: Initially, our focus as a guild will be leveling, experiencing the content and teaching the newbies all they need to progress. When a large enough number of us are ready, those who wish to do so will transition into raiding several nights a week. Those who don't are more than welcome to continue to enjoy the game however they choose.
---
Rules: Be excellent to each other and excersize common sense. We don't police language or humor, just be respectful. You're not required to be on at X time or X number of days per week. It's a game. If we have a movie night, you can come or not come. Your standing in the guild is based on your attitude in and out of game, not how many hours you've logged or how high your DPS is.

DPS meter. THREAT meter, quest helper, DBM. Basically the same stuff I use on retail anyways (minus the threat meter because lol).
---
Agree with this. If you don't have Improved Sap, leave CC for other classes - it will make everyone's life a lot easier, and the run will be smoother.
---
Should have added a date for ‚Äòyou think you do, but you don‚Äôt‚Äô for giggles. :)

No, Vanilla was released 15 years ago. Classic will be (I hope) released this summer.
---
Sigh..."hey guys, here is my well thought out idea that won't change the game, and totally negates the fact that everyone also has ideas that won't change the game" Thread number 3571.
---
Wall of text can't fight facts. I respect your idea and opinion but its just a drop in the ocean of opinions.
---
Explain to me how do you add new gear to classic? The reason vanilla content was relevant almost all the time was because the gear SUCKED as a design. In fact it sucked so hard, that it actually helped the game. 
---
How do you add new content without breaking this part?
---
You first :-D
---
Would you say he generated more threat than the POM pyro mage ? \^\^
---
Some of it has absolutely been guessed, but they're going to be pretty fair guesses. Getting spell resists wrong by 1% isn't going to make the game feel "fairly new" as the guy above claimed.
---
The hearth at the end lmao
---
All these people trying to justify it; keep it up and this is why hunters will not be invited to shit.
---
^(btw there will be cross realms BGs)
---
Rogue. I want to try some melee dps and I like stealth in general. Not too much spec swapping as I won't do PvP battlegrounds except for AV for the epics.
---
Still hesitating between Horde or Alliance but leaning more towards Alliance (Dwarf).
---
Yeah, sounds like a good thing.
---
Sunder armor allows you to reduce armor by 2250. For exampe, if you have 3000 armor then you would have 750 armor after 5 stacks of sunder. I have no idea how you could get this wrong.
---
**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We‚Äôre looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
Nothing is solidified just yet but we‚Äôre thinking a single organized raid night either Fridays or Saturdays, starting around 8-9 EST, for targeting 40 player content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message @Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
Ah, sounds like no big deal, thanks!
---
&gt; All of the reported things were known by Blizzard
---
[citation needed]
---
Heh.. Anyone complaining should google and ‚Äòjust launch any game released around 2004‚Äô. Let‚Äôs see how easy that is, that‚Äôs what.. 5 windows versions ago alone? More than 20 cpu/gpu generations ago the strongest hardware at the time is like 8-15% of a medium PC now.
---
But yeah, they should put it on bnet and release ffs. /s
---
I was thinking about mono class WSG. Would 10 hunters be good? Ranged delete 3 + characters + cc seems pretty good
---
It's quite a lot of free action potions !
---
not in raid
---
Yeah, sounds like you're definitely not the type of person that should be playing PVP, if literally one gank would have made you ragequit.
---
Hi, /u/tylerdurdenisnotreal
---
I wouldnt mind the game having bugs. Not "crashing the server" kind of bugs though... but smaller ones? Whatever.
---
Yep you need 13000 rank points per week to make rank 14. If there is too few people then you only get 12000 rank points and that's not enough to get the 60000 points required for rank 14, because at some point you start losing 11999 or 12000 points per week.
---
Me later outside sitting alone: https://youtu.be/yUrXrhWa0GA?t=300
---
This was insanely good when it first came out. A discount to the mana cost of every cast. It was later changed to give a flat increase to damage and healing. Still moderately useful for a new lvl 60, but not as good as it was. 
---
We won't see the original stats for this in Classic, unfortunately.
---
They sure as hell are! Troll druid is one of the few good things later expansions brought.
---
It's less about them being desirable (though they might be - I'm not actually sure), and more about the fact that there simply aren't as many 3-letter combinations to go around, especially when you discount linguistically awkward ones like XYZ.
---
I must have played on a baller server (lightnings blade)  because there was Tons of guild doing naxx progression.     Just because only a few guilds cleared naxx doesnt mean a ton of guilds weren't clearing  a few bosses.   There wasn't just 2 or 3 good guilds there were 7 or 8.  Alliance side anyways.   My server also has a few big name players like Ming the rogue and Aedak the warrior.  *2005-2006 e-fame*  lol
---
Something to consider : the bigger the model the slower you move (it's just an impression but still).
---
Try a gnome, it's like you're permanently using sprint and then take a male tauren, it's like you're barely walking.
---
So what you are asking is really. Is it more fun to play alone as an Alliance Warlock or a Horde Warlock with friends.
---
Call me crazy but I would say Horde Warlock with friends.
---
An appropriate response would have been "kek"
---
Because Orc is master race.
---
Oh you said class my bad.
---
Orc
---
On a dwarf? Very unlikely. Human has best chance with rep bonus but still hard even by 60 for either. Honestly I would just level doing darnassus rep quests as much as you can, get your dwarf mount at 40 and just go for the cat at 60. The gold for the ram will be a drop in the ocean by then anyway, training is the same price everywhere.
---
Personally I‚Äôm going human and I‚Äôm gonna just focus on the winter spring cats at 60 for one. I don‚Äôt wanna sacrifice levelling efficiency and having my levelling route on rails all just for darnassus rep.
---
Dude, half the time I needed Thottbot was because the instructions on where to get X item in the quest text was way too vague.  Doubt people remember where every single mob/quest item was
---
Yeah I'm super annoyed that the chest that is BiS for SO long is so damn ugly, and doiesn't play in to the class fantasy at all. But at the same time, I think T1, T2, AND the PVP set are all so cool that I can't really complain. T2 head and legs are available from the start and look heckin cool. T1 shoulders are just damn great looking.
---
Are you certain about the rep being less if the quest is green? I thought it only started to decay at gray.
---
Sounds good! Faction leader as raid bosses and succesful def rewards! I vote yes! Lets improve classic!!!!!!!! Fck all people who wanna live in 2005 and havent been improving in anything
---
You are a dreamer. 80% of Blizzard's WoW revenue came from microtransactions last year and that added up to being a couple of billions, why does this matter? Well because the casual audience that makes up a majority of retail players nowadays are constantly buying the pets and mounts Blizzard puts out for them, the older audience doesn't buy anything except maybe a character realm transfer or name change (if they are even still playing at all).
---
Blizzard knows this very well which I think is the reason we're finally going to get classic WoW, they know we don't buy anything either way that they put out in the in-game shop so they capitalize on us paying the monthly fee. It's either that or nothing for Blizzard from us non-retail players.. and again, Blizzard knows that. Not to mention that Classic will boost the official overall subscriber count for retail WoW which will look good for their stockholders.
---
I'm not complaining at all FYI, I'm completely fine with this as long as I get a solid classic experience.
---
PVE- half game? No thanks
---
I‚Äôm an adult so I‚Äôll be playing on PvP.
---
I'd really like it if they did something like this. But I guess it's probably looked as a huge risk to pretty much kill retail as we know it and make a "wow 2" instead of just keep selling expansion and squeeze what money you can out of it.
---
But a Wow 2 with some back to basics of  what made wow and awesome RPG. and scrapping everyones progression. Redoing classes and giving them all a new class identity, maybe some classes lost in the process and some new ones could appear? Just as an example, Split hunter into a Ranger/Archer and a Beast Master class. Maybe Alchemist as a class, utilizing tech and potions in combat as opposed to it being a profession. You can do sooo many things to give new life to Wow. 
---
Also overhaul the character creation to allow more customization, this could probably pull more people back from Final Fantasy 14 and Elder Scrolls Online.
---
This would give them a chance to redo the whole concept of how to sell expansions and create content, maybe find ways to avoid the "new zones results in old zones are now dead" that constantly comes with expansions now.
---
Or you know...just don't change it at all? But since this is just another "my opinion", id give you mine.
---
Seasonal server resets every 2-3 years.
---
Different team, different vision and i personally have no trust in them at this point.
---
In the end it's just another "in my opinion that won't hurt the game". Just one of the hundreds. Pandora's box either stays closed or forever open.
---
Awesome and unique class quests.
---
The original edgelords unlike those poser Shadow Priests. ^(Shadow Weaving pls.)
---
Summon your own GF.
---
Big fan of mutually assured destruction? Dots dots dots.
---
Like Goldshire, but feel like it could use a few more Infernals about?
---
Literally using the souls of your enemies to bake cookies.
---
BIG Shadow Bolt numbers.
---
Equipment durability friendly suicide in case of a wipe or boredom.
---
Doom Guard roulette.
---
Even our robes are edgy.
---
This made my day actually
---
Probably only cause i'm level 1.  Maybe later on will be different.
---
&lt;IRONFIST&gt; (HORDE-NA CST) PVE &gt; PVP  
---
Hey everyone,  I'm going to make this short and sweet. &lt;IRONFIST&gt; is going to be playing WoW: Classic and we are looking to bring in some more folks to join us. We actually still play on Burning Legion (US-Alliance) and are a day one guild, so we know a thing or two about original WoW. (We will be going Horde for WoW: Classic because we have spent 15 years as alliance and desire a change.) 
---
We want people who just are looking to have fun with friends and get stuff done but not take it super seriously. We will raid, PvP, run dungeons all of the stuff you expect, but we are realistic when it comes to game/work/life balance as most of us who have been playing since 2004 are adults and need to get things done before video games. Toxic people who cannot get along with others are removed, we do not have time for that.  
---
So, what do you need to do to join us? Just hop over to discord and tell us you want to join. While waiting for Classic you can join our members in other games, join in on some conversations, or if you really want, just hang out until the servers launch.  
---
Raid times TBD: We are adults and want to come up with raid times as a collective that works with everyone.  
---
Questions? Go ahead and PM or Join discord and ask there!  [https://discord.gg/vAgrEvQ](https://discord.gg/vAgrEvQ)
---
Drop rates are wack.  Zhevra hooves are waay too quick, and bags are madness.  I did the Kolkar plans quest in Durotar at level 7 and walked out of the canyon with a full bar of 6 slotters.
---
It's funny that you think blizzard has this information hidden and intact.
---
Do you morons even CONSIDER WHY private servers 'guessed'?
---
If anything, Blizzard is using data from private servers, because that empirical data is literally the best data they have
---
Except we have no idea about the actual armor values of bosses. There are also other armor reducing effects.
---
I won‚Äôt go out of my way to bank a lowbie but I do attack most red players because my experience is usually if you ignore them they attack you while your fighting. Also sometimes payback stinks and I got yanked so I‚Äôm passing along the favor.
---
While it was the lesser of all the evils, and still good honestly, the moment they introduced flying ruined a lot for me. Even just in Outland.
---
Winter 2017
---
I remember guilds used to leave like a bank alt in world boss locations and check it when it appropriate.
---
Not gettingt ganked by 60s
---
Innervate becomes a permanent passive
---
Male orcs understand the true value of shoulderpads
---
I want a Tauren rogue lol. Like... the game is started by you being cast out from the Tauren village or whatever and you are unfriendly with them, so you need to do all quests and stuff with the other races.
---
Ahhh faking HS to lure out a Counter Spell makes me feel fuzzy and warm inside.
---
&gt; Try installing a swing timer and testing this.
---
That feeling when I do exactly what u/robmox asks me to do. I even document everything. But because the experiment indicates robmox is wrong, he just downvotes.
---
He doesn't even try to argue his (probably) false claim that *"if you Slam once immediately following a auto attack it will not interrupt your attack timer."*
---
Waste of time. But my mistake I guess. Shouldn't have asked this question in "Simple Questions" and expected to only get competent answers. I guess I did confirm that Slam resets swing timer (like everyone says it does), so it wasn't a complete waste of time.
---
All-Druid guilds get all the world firsts
---
That‚Äôs cool flying never bothered me as much as making the game a single player non social game.
---
Damn that would be crazy. You could use the mana even if you tried. Moonfire spamming between regrowth casts lol
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
We got an itemization blue post the other day [here](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/itemization-in-wow-classic/46655). Basically, whatever the item looked like in 1.12 is what the item will look like in Classic, *but* it may not be added until a certain phase.
---
That's not very far.
---
What's the delay date? Is there even a date?
---
Oh all those dead servers :(
---
the retarded rule that you can't name private servers just makes this worse.
---
That and it killed world pvp which is a huge priority for me.
---
I can see you have thought about this :p I'm just a filthy casual that started playing during WOTLK, stopped during MoP, and have never made it past lvl 51 on PSs.
---
Hunter pets get scaling/avoidance like they do in TBC.
---
I levelled casually on a PvP server. It was great and frustrating. If I got camped, I just started or returned to an alt that was elsewhere in the world.
---
There was a great sense of achievement in completing a zone that was heavily contested, and the buzz from flying through a zone quickly was amazing. Made me feel really lucky just to be able to get the pve experience on a PvP server.
---
I stayed on PvP servers due to friends. Not sure if I will do the same this time round.
---
TBC allready brought in some very flawed concepts... like pretty much abandoning the world.
---
Im not downvoting you because you proved me wrong. I‚Äôm glad you confirmed that Slam interrupts your swing timer. I‚Äôm downvoting because of your total lack of social skills. 
---
If you‚Äôre not happy using Slam to change your attack from 1 Attack every 3.4 seconds to two attacks every 4.4 seconds, then Slam isn‚Äôt for you. But, even when it interrupts your swing timer, it‚Äôs still a DPS increase.
---
The shoulders on vanilla orcs look absolutely ridiculous. I actually prefer the look of full gear sets on female orcs. They resemble slightly larger humans, and so the gear proportions look normal. Every other race on horde looks weird with gear. Either no fully covered feet in trolls, undead, or tauren, or horns poking through head slots, etc. Female orcs what up.
---
Oh yeah im not expecting it to be massively different.
---
I've played private server and vanilla
---
(As well as private servers for Wrath) and they're generally pretty consistent with what I remember. Other than specific bosses or specific quests being pretty fucked, the game *felt* "blizzlike as the term is.
---
But i was just pointing out that ultimately they were guessing. Guessing as close as they can to get as similar results as they can, but it _is_ guessing.
---
Could a beastmaster's pet solo cloth users now?
---
I remember getting mad at rogues who used expose armor during raids because it removed our (tanks) stacks of sunder armor and we couldn‚Äôt re-apply them.
---
...they don‚Äôt stack.
---
Then Battleshout does 0 Threat wenn refreshed while 1s is left?
---
Hunter shots don‚Äôt reset auto shot timing. No more need to weave your shots.
---
&gt;No your argument is for a museum piece. An exact replica of Vanilla, that is not coming your way and does not exist. Period.
---
I think you should stick to what I'm saying instead of telling me what you think I'm saying, then arguing against it.
---
&gt; Vanillas time has passed, and the game played on Private servers is far  different to the one played 14 years prior. If you wish to play a museum  piece then I suggest finding a dead server, using the zero knowledge of  what we know now, and playing it out as it was, because what is coming  is far from that 
---
That's not something I agree with because what you're doing is saying it doesn't matter what changes they make because vanilla has already existed. Well the whole point of the project is to be vanilla as it historically was.
---
&gt; Yes, acting like a Nazi is a saying. Where overwhelming numbers of cult  like people seemingly overwhelm alternative opinions because it doesn't  fit the criteria of what they want. 
---
That's not an argument. That's comparing people who disagree with you as a group of people that rounded up millions of jews and gassed them.
---
&gt; The control of the old and new models is in a toggle. You can't have any  more control that being able to turn them off, clearly your not  understanding the point. People want the option, give them the option.  If they choose to keep the old models, they just check it in interface  and crack on. Again I'm not reiterating MY point. 
---
 It's 'just optional' doesn't cut it when players no longer have control over how their avatar is percieved in a *MMORPG*.  Having a character not look as their player intends does in fact alter  the dynamics of a social game. People make comments on how my character  looks in game all the time regardless of what I play and vice-versa. The  fact that so many people don‚Äôt understand that it's fundamentally  important in a game that revolves around developing your character and  socializing to achieve your goals only to say *‚Äúwell you‚Äôre ruining the way I want to play the game‚Äù*  as though you‚Äôre entitled to something extraneous to vanilla and it  doesn‚Äôt matter is genuinely laughable. It's this type of thinking that  drove people away from the game. 
---
Off you go then, m8, if you're going to be intellectually dishonest.
---
wow was. classic wow is not vanilla wow.
---
Dual wielding bows. One auto shots the other casts specials lol
---
No, HS is a special, it replaces your next swing. That's why on-next hit attacks don't generate rage, only white hits can generate rage.
---
That didn't make sense at all. You just proved him right?
---
Honestly I couldn't say what made me main a dwarven warrior in vanilla. It must've been the fact that the LotR movies had just wrapped in theaters and I must've liked Gimli or something. I hate dwarven characters now and warrior has never been that fun to me since then. I stopped playing him in BC.
---
Just keep in mind that it is an auto attack class already. You would be gimping yourself out of the extra damage from ret
---
It's a slow class that eats through mana early on and you will have no way of tagging mobs when the zones are swarmed with new players at launch
---
I have waited 3.5 years for Age of Conan, \~7 for Star Citizen and 14 to play something like vanilla again.
---
Waiting for 1.5 years is pretty average and expected I would say.
---
Correct AFAIK
---
...unless you get interrupted in PvP and have no pet to assist you
---
This is what im hoping for. Blizz knows BFA is a pile of trash and they already are slowly trying to bring things back to retail like player buffs and the non automated LFG/ having to travel to the instance for M+. The pendulum always swings most players are just to cynical at this point to see it.
---
I know I am late to the party and people probably won't see it but [this guy Greywolf](http://greywolf.critter.net/wow/travel.htm) made great to scale maps for us in the WoW RPG. I currently use them with a hex overlay for my 5E Azeroth campaign and they are really great.
---
Yeah I've gone to 60 on a few servers and played on a few instant 60 servers as well, only made it to level 35 or so back then before TBC launched, but then played a lot on TBC and wrath. First time playing druid though :) so it's gonna be all new for me!
---
To expand on this: Harder pulls should rather be done by Hunters or to a slightly lesser degree Rogues instead of the tank, because they can reset. There are a couple of nasty pulls in raids and even 5mans. Hunters and Rogues can always reset if they miss the timing and Hunters specifically have the largest pull range.
---
Holy will give you more sustain, but Paladins already had no issue with sustain; their issue is kill speed. As the other guy said, you can heal as ret while leveling, just save every piece of gear that has the most int on it (cloth and leather are fine). 
---
Getting to SoCommand by lvl 20 is nice with a slow 2hand (or Verigan's Fist, which is not slow but insane for the level anyway). As an added bonus, it makes the auto-hit method more interesting playing the Command proc lottery.
---
Blizzcon feels like it was yesterday, yet release feels like it's an eternity away.
---
Reserving the names you want for your characters.

You think you know but you don't

**&lt;CREW&gt; - EU ‚Äì Horde - PvP Server ‚Äì Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English**
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere.
---
We currently have 54 dedicated and social members. For raiding, we are currently ONLY recruiting: Warlock, Resto Shaman.
---
We are also absolutely looking for socials/non-raiders!
---
**Goals**
---
* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace.
---
* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months).
---
* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server.
---
* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
**Core values**
---
* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
* Common sense and patience.
---
* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.
---
**Raid Schedule** (*Preliminary*)
---
2 raid days: Thursday and Sunday 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET-CEST).
---
If you are interested or have any questions please send me a message and we‚Äôll talk:
---

Druid :\^)
---
too bad addons say what is being casted
---
Yeah, there was the one fight where your priests had to heal for something like 7 mins straight or something.  I don't really remember priest stuff, I played lock.
---
Private servers, especially well scripted ones like Nostalrius was are at least 90% accurate. It's only the little details like boss hp, proc rates, resistance values e.t.c. that they don't know for sure and are guessing at.
---
Will there be surprises? Of course, but for the majority of the time, private server veterans would be able to jump right in without too many issues at all.
---
The tank has to exceed by 10% to get aggro.
---
After that, the rogue would have to have 110% of the warrior's threat to get the mob back.
---
Thanks, thats obvious. But im in fact asking about drops in dungeons etc.
---
Like most other BIS lists
---
You sound like a moron
---
I saw one with the halberd from ZG, the one with no stats.
---
&gt;and so have aggro from the other mobs, it will be more difficult for the Tank to pick up those mobs
---
if all he did was bodypull there is like no threat on any of them and the tank can get them just from one battle shout
---
&gt; How many of you have bought subscription now because of incoming classic ??  
---
Why in the world would I ever do that?
---
Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs remotely relevant, next
---
just vanish after
---
Right, well to make it short both mouseover and focus macros in vanilla works similar to "/target X -&gt; /cast spell -&gt; /targetlasttarget". So it's basically just a way of swapping targets using a script and because its a script, it happens so quick that it seems like you never swap targets. But in todays wow both mouseover-targets and focus-targets actually act as secondary targets, afaik.
---
*laughs in Weak Auras* 
---
*laughs harder in KTM*
---
Sorry for getting annoyed that you spread misinformation. I mean, literally everything you wrote was wrong. Even from your first comment.
---
&gt;I believe Slam only interrupts your auto attack swing if it occurs during the last .5 sec of the attack timer. If you slam any other time, you're fine. Same goes for any melee ability.
---
First off, your auto attack swing assumption was wrong. Secondly, Slam is special since it has a cast time. The same doesn't go for "any melee ability."
---
Regarding social skills. You don't HAVE to respond to comments if you're not sure of the answer. Especially not when literally everything you write is wrong.
---
Wow that is really disappointing
---
Well my question was more related to stacking buffs, like the alcohol buffs stacking. will buffs be included in this or no cause that might be one of the few nerfs then
---
Pooling rage is probably the most noticeable thing tanks can do in 5 mans.
---
I don't know why people making tank guides don't mention this.
---

---
Do you think blizzard will allow that, cant see that happening.
---
And since it will be super easy to farm gold on classic retail, gold farming etc not nerfed like on privat servers i would assume around 200-300g rather quick.
---
Just to correct one drop. "Cape of the Fire Salamander" final stats is not as shown in the video. Spirit gets nerfed down to 6, which doesn't make it a viable option, unless you aim for FR gear.  [https://itemization.info/item/11812](https://itemization.info/item/11812)   
---
In general, really good options. I like guides that don't "put down a final BiS". There are plenty of options and plenty of flexibility for a priest's preferred style and talents.
---
I doubt most people who played vanilla remember as well as you do. I can't count how many times it took me to get 8/8 tier 1 piece in MC it 6/8 tier 2, yet I can't even remember most of the bosses names anymore let alone their mechanics.
---
For me it's going to be pretty fresh again. I expect some things to come back to me quicker than usual but it's not going to be easy from a general consensus.
---
Vanilla, BC, and wrath were close enough that I felt like I was playing the same game.  Everything after was a pile of unplayable shit that felt it catered to the lowest common denominator.
---
This makes me sick.
---
I've tales that in early patches Helcular's grave had ally guards much closer to it, so turning in the quest was a suicide mission.
---
BUT, Helcular's revenge was much more powerful.  He was a higher level, elite?, that could demolish the guards and any allies who got too close.
---
Honestly wouldn't be the worst thing. The whole shot clipping mechanic makes so many ranged weapons obsolete and basically turns hunter wep progression into Rok'dalar -&gt; Ashjre'thul -&gt; nothing, you're basically done.
---
For this to even work it would require the person selling the tokens to be active on both Retail and Classic with a stake in advancement in both. This will be a very limited number of people to begin with.
---
the older bonereaver is actually stronger then the most buffed version for raiding
---
Maybe it was me. To be fair I was the only one capable of even equipping Corpsemaker, I never would've needed it otherwise.
---
&gt; Things you can easily do in a fresh server, but become harder as time pass
---
Farming Devilsaur leather, or buying your own Devilsaur set, becomes easier as time pass, not harder. Because the competition for spawns and the price drop massively over time.
---
If you try to tag a Devilsaur on a fresh server week 1 you'll get murdered and camped. If you're a slow leveler or start playing later, there's a good chance you'll find plenty of Devilsaurs walking the crater because nobody cares anymore. Easier, not harder.
---
Paladins get "greater" seals and you can have multiple different seals active at once 0\_o
---
**Greater Seal of Command**  
---
**Rank 1**  
---
400 mana  
---
Instant  
---
Gives the Paladin and all party members within 30 yards a chance to deal additional Holy damage equal to 70% of normal weapon damage. Only one Seal of Command can be active on a player at any one time. Lasts 30 sec.  
---
Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy, instantly causing 169.5 to 204.5 Holy damage, 339 to 374 if the target is stunned or incapacitated.  
---
**Greater Seal of the Crusader**  
---
300 mana  
---
Fills the Paladin and all party members within 30yards with the spirit of a crusader for 30 sec, granting 306 melee attack power. The player also attacks 40% faster, but deals less damage with each attack. Only one Seal of the Cursader can be active on a player at any one time.  
---
Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 10 sec, increasing Holy damage taken by up to 140. Your melee strikes will refresh the spell's duration. Only one Judgement per player can be active at any one time.  
---
**Greater Seal of Righteousness**  
---
**Rank 8**  
---
200 mana  
---
Fills the Paladin and all party members within 30yards with holy spirit for 30 sec, granting each melee attack an additional 20.52 to 71.44 Holy damage. Slower weapons cause more Holy damage per swing. Only one Seal of Righteousness can be active on a player at any one time.  
---
Unleashing this Seal's energy will cause 162 to 179 Holy damage to an enemy.
---
30 yards is 27.43 meters
---
No, they guessed. The Nost team even admitted they had a lot of gaps to fill in. 
---
"As close as possible," right so they made an estimated guess. Meaning they guessed. 
---
I don't care if a value was off by .001, that is going to make a drastic difference to the game play. 
---
EVERYTHING about how the game works is based on math. If you get one single value wrong the math is wrong. Therefore the experience is wrong. 
---
Anyone that has played vanilla and then on a private server can tell you that they don't *feel* right. Cause the math isn't spot on.
---
It will be kinda fresh for me at least. I started with wow in February 2007. Shortly after BC release. So my friends and I never really played Classic. I have read a lot about it and iam low key hyped to play.
---
Up until wotlk the game was just fantastic for me. But now bfa and stuff, idk doesn‚Äôt really feel like an rpg anymore. I still don‚Äôt know what I will play tho :D
---
On Alliance, the only class that has Mail as their highest armour proficiency is Hunter. Not sure what impact that has, though, and you probably already knew.
---
its the calm before the storm, as soon as the release is out you will be pumped again.
---
2 reasons.
---
1. To feel nostalgia
---
2. To show Blizzard my interest
---
Yes we do, for example maexxna has 3700 iirc because there is vanilla screen shot of Beast Lore saying so. Then there was the combat log of patchwerk showing bloodthirst before and after crusader which was used to calculate his armor to be 3700. There is kick dmg combat log showing that KT had 3000 armor or so.
---
Does it really matter why vanilla mechanics allowed much higher physical dps than pserver? The point is that you won't get 2500 -&gt; 1200 aimed shot, you will get  more like 2500 -&gt; 3000.
---
There are a lot of areas where PvP will rarely occur.  Time of day also matters.  You're not going to PvP every time you attempt a quest, with exception of the massive first wave at server launch probably.
---
Yes it is. The game is based on math. That's how video games work. Every value, every actions every % chance is all based on equations and given values. 
---
If those values are wrong, the gameplay is wrong. Simple as that. 
---
A lot of meds that came to be in p servers won't exist in retail classic.
---
Warrior Shaman Priest...  
---
Anhks, rezs, heals, more utility. Priest can go shadow for extra damage.
---
The whole group should do more damage as a whole and have more surviveability.
---
Blessing of freedom is nice, but the constant slow of frost shock / earth bind totem. Will keep you in range of your targets.  
---
Also better pvp races on the horde side.
---
While R10 gear is indeed very good, Hunters are a physical DPS class and benefit massively from their ranged weapon.
---
You're not going to get very far in PvP if everyone else has raid gear and you're still using Blackcrow or CSC.
---
This!
---
Can go super fast with heirlooms though...
---
Ok i'm out.
---
Whatever the state of the items was in 1.12, is likely to be what we will see.
---
Because blizzard said months in advance the demo was announced that there was a TON of stuff still in the demo that hadn't been cleaned up and it was never intended to be anything more than this is what we've done so far, check-in with the fan-base.
---
You'd turn your back on your ancestors by aligning yourself with elgi?
---
My characters won't even learn to use bows due to needing to visit their dirty city for it. Have some respect.
---
I used to think it might be possible too, but when you buy a token, you're not buying from a specific person, they're not tradable. You just click a buy button and get one off whoever is next in line.
---
&gt; I think it will go for around 50g the first month  
---
lol I wish..  
---
Thats around an hour of farming.
---
FeelsGoodMan
---
Er du dum en flok fucking tabere
---
&gt; To feel nostalgia
---
Where are you feeling the nostalgia from?  
---
&gt; Hey guys, I miss paying Blizzard $15 a month. I miss it so much that I'm going to go pay them again for good old times.
---
With 50% increased damage, the caster would have to be very bad/undergeared.
---
Back when it was 100% increased damage that was entirely possible. :D
---
You will also get -20% threat from Tranquil Air Totem, and the tank will generate more aggro from Windfury Totem. So for Warlocks it's pretty much the same, give or take. Unless you are the Warlock who has to stay in the tank group to provide bloodpact, I guess. RIP.
---
In general it's more of an issue for Melee, because they won't have both Windfury and Tranquil Air (since they are both wind totems).
---
You just level in a hybrid type build.
---
I was never able to get a character to level 60 before TBC. I never raided and only did a few five man's at the lower levels. I could definitely be one of those players that is playing like it's 2005, because for me it will be. I think maybe that's why I'm looking forward to this so much.
---
**Priest**
---
* Has fun and unique spells for pretty much any situation (Mind control, Mana Burn, Dispel Magic, Shackle undead)
---
* One of the best raid healers 
---
* Shadow spec very strong in PvP (Just remember to guzzle those mana pots!)
---
* Can AOE farm packs with Holy nova spam 
---
* Unique priest racials (Fear ward, Devouring plague to name a few)
---
* Easy to find groups/raids
---
They don't stack on private servers either, friendo. :\^)
---
The problem with this line of reasoning is that nobody is dumb enough to fall for it. Internally they'll have analytics on where people are spending their play time, and externally major investors don't really care, just so long as the return is there.
---
Personally I think it's about smoothing out live subscribers. People sign up for the next expansion, leave, come back when new content patches come out, leave again, maybe never come back. With vanilla, there's this fixed eternal content there that you can jump on with your same subscription when there's a drought. It's about increasing the value of your WoW subscription so you just keep it continuously rather than subbing and cancelling and resubbing.
---
Really hoping Blizz decides to stealth buff content and not say anything about it. Not gona happen though.
---
Oh, I could find a use for those slots.
---
Tbh I couldn't eye ball it so I wasn't sure.
---
Flying never bothered me since I don't engage in gan- I mean "world pvp" to begin with.
---
All existing private servers are. Every single core all current private servers are build from is reverse engineered from 2.2 TBC.
---
That's why every single vanilla private server that exists has summoning meeting stones, even if some servers do disable the interaction to try and be a little bit more blizzlike (though the queuing function they did have is completely non-existent as all data about it was removed during the 2.0 patch when completely replaced the dungeon queue system with TBC's version).
---
If you are put into a Shaman caster group they will put down Tranquil Air, which is a similar threat reduction.
---
Early prot Warriors are threat capped on some encounters, because they have to wear almost full mitigation gear before they have better stats. As their geat gets better they can add more threat gear on bosses where it makes sense.
---
Druids generate more threat than prot warriors and any warrior that wears a shield by a large amount. If your guild uses a feral Druid to tank threat capped bosses you won't ever have threat issues as a Warlock.
---
Fury/defiance warriors generate similar or more threat than Druids, but they have to dual wield to do so. So if you have really good healers and generally high DPS in your raid then this is an option too.
---
Nobody will fault you if your DPS is low because you are being threat capped, especially if the above solutions are not applied. If somebody still does: Find a better guild.
---
The most nolifing hardcore guilds do more than that. They'd have 24/7 coverage from the earliest possible respawn time with people taking it in shifts, and they'd have a bunch of level 20 warlocks logged out nearby to rapidly summon people in when the alert goes out.
---
Early Classic will play out in much the same way. If Classic is a big success and ends up bringing a lot of old players back this sort of behaviour will likely dilute a lot as there will be more and more servers full of people who never played private servers and never fell into the ultra-hardcore metas that they spawned.
---
I think the first round of Classic servers will stay as the most hardcore for a long time, with new waves of servers being less likely to have ex-pserver guilds on them and thus less likely to end up that way.
---
Nope, if it was balanced at any point in vanilla, it won't be in classic, that includes these stacking buffs.
---
You should be shocked. The SEC really frowns on behavior like this, and as regulatory bodies go they have some teeth. Look at the shitshow Musk managed to create with just a tweet.
---
Also lets not forget private servers are generally international servers with massive 5k+ player base online at all times. When the classic realms are created they will likely have population caps at 2k and limited to people in your region.
---
yah that makes sense, that's actually quite a few nerfs as is. I wonder if there was a lot of blatantly broken items people forgot about that would have made content easier if power farmed towards. So many people focusing on the negatives of things without fully looking into both sides.
---
Yep! My friend started playing in Cata and I play sind BC release. Neither of us ever played real Classic. We know there are so many ‚Äûcomfort things‚Äú missing back in the days. Like my friend plays always Hunter, he already jokes about feeding pet, and leveling it, buying ammunition for the weapon etc.
---
But we plan to slowly level through the game and ADVENTURE the world. Not like today‚Äôs game where leveling is super irrelevant. You get a green item and are happy to have it for several levels. 
---
I still don‚Äôt know what to play. My first char was a Gnome mage. Tho like I said, at BC release. 
---
I fancy the thought of a holy Paladin currently, my friend plays Hunter and I healer. Or retry and I could still heal in dungeons. I never liked rogue or tooo complex classes. Like vanilla druids wouldn‚Äôt be my thing :p
---
What makes you think that? Would be very unlike Blizzard. Plus the blue posts give me confidence that they are on schedule.
---
Hahaha liebmann, dejligt at h√∏re fra dig üòòüòò

It can be done in 5 minutes here too if you really don't care, but it's not unusual to have to spend an hour or two trying to decipher our tax legislation and figure out how to either make the most of any available benefits or more importantly not have to pay additional tax.
---
It's a pain, but I kinda prefer not having the ATO / my employer having full access to every facet of my finances to be able to determine what tax I should be paying...
---
**Priest** 
---
* Unique priest racials (Fear ward, Devouring plague to name a few) *Easy to find groups/raids
---
You say this, but when your class quest cannot be completed due to some bug, you would freak out, waiting for patch...
---
[Crown of the Penitent](https://itemization.info/item/13216)  
---
This item accidentally granted 15 mana per 5 seconds originally. It's the only item in the game with this precise effect text and gave mana per second instead of mana per 5.
---
Shaman and Priest are more than than Hunter and Paladin unless you already know you ooke the playstyles of them in vanilla. They can be a rough adjustment. 
---
Also Horde. So. Ya know.
---
ye that's actually pretty cool. was just commenting on someone else on how there seems to be a lot of broken stuff in earlier wow that was actually toned down.
---
still, works. not eveytime, but it works.
---
Reputation means alot in Classic, if Free Character transfers would open. Then reputation means nothing, same with name changes.
---
You can act up and be a d**khead and fuck shit up, ninja loot all you want and don't give a F. Pay $5 change name or $10 server and start over.
---
I want nothing of that, just like classic was and Private is.
---
Don't know if the cost of these changes are correct tho.
---
god damn

&lt;Astral&gt; (Alliance, EU French PvP server) - PVE guild  
---
En quelques mots :
---
* Core de 5-6 joueurs depuis TBC, rejoints par des amis IRL/online (nous sommes aujourd'hui une 12aine)
---
* Semi-hardcore : 2 soirs de raids, mais exigence √©lev√©e (pr√©sence, optimisation, consommables)
---
* Un call Discord de 5 minutes sera plus int√©ressant qu'une longue pr√©sentation
---
Ajoutez-moi sur Discord : Strift#0812
---
And if blizzard doesn't have the source code, they'll be using similar methods to"guess" what's right
---
**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done. https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903

**Discord:** https://discord.gg/HgZrsqh
---
Mage for all the top DPS in raids with easy to reach +hit cap? Sure, I didn't mind spamming frostbolt but that's not why.
---
For all the AOE farming that you can do? Maybe that's a good bit of it, but it's more than that.
---
It's all the oh shit moments with a huge toolbox of spells to get you out of a sticky situation. Will of the Forsaken, Frost Nova, Sheep, Mana Gem, Bandage, CoC, Blink, Mana Shield, Evocation, Ice Block, PoM+Frostbolt, Cannibalize.
---
Some of those racials and whatnot, but it really goes to show what you can do in order to survive and overcome deadly scenarios, nothing really beats that feeling for me and no other class will do.
---
Dont dig this rabbit hole any deeper man, take the L and move on
---
I like doing things a bit different. I was the first Resto Shaman of consequence on my initial server, and became the difference maker with my new resto shaman on a new server with a good friend of mine. Joined their guild, they got their first MC clear my first night (and first MC run ever) Two days later they cleared ZG for the first time. (also my first ZG run ever)
---
I could pick apart almost any class in PVP, and at 70 I ruined alliance shamans because they just didn't know all the tricks. 
---
This time around I'm rolling alliance with a group of friends, and I'm gonna play the only class I absolutely hated trying to deal with in PVP....
---
BearTank
---
`Some Durid's is bare!11! Storng Baer Durid.`
---
Also this keeps in theme with my desire to play an "unconventional class" since a lot of people think that only prot warriors are real tanks. And I'd like to be better than Prot Pallies for end game content. Since my guild will likely get into that at some point, and if I just never get the gear, I'm an excellent Druid healer.
---
Also, stealth. I've got a friend rolling full on Resto druid forever, and at least one more friend rolling rogue. 3 man boss kills for a long time, and stealth questing... all day ere'day.
---
Well as for pvp realms, i'm pretty sure you can only choose one faction, so if your first char on a pvp realm is horde then you wont be able to make alliance chars on that realm.  
---
Doubt faction change will be an option either (for pvp realms at least). And my guess is that, if they give us the option to transfer realms, you'll most likely only be able to transfer between the same type of realms so pvp realm -&gt; pvp realm and pve -&gt; pve etc.
---
Someone still has to farm the gold in Classic, so how is this even an issue? The problem of a WoW token is you can introduce "new" gold by paying real money. So what if someone will give their Classic gold to another person for retail gold? No new gold is introduced.
---
This will only be a very niche market anyway, since the whole idea works around someone farming in Classic in order to get gold on retail - they could just farm in retail then or buy a token themselves.
---
Go Hardcore - Go Warrior.
---
Go Casual - Go Hunter.
---
PS: that is not to say that casuals cant play warrior and hunters cant be hardcore. It's just that in those two extremes, thats where these classes shine the most in comparison to other classes
---
There will be RP servers.
---
Jokes about the "Soon ‚Ñ¢ "-meme aside, it's damn nice to see that they seem to adopt this attitude, and I'd definitely prefer if they take their time with this than to rush it out.
---
they have data for for 1.12 and a couple patches before it. But not a complete data set for every single patch of vanilla.
---
You would be losing money from all the people vendoring their grey items. You would make some of it back from repairing stuff. If you could sell medium leather, that would be the real cash cow - no need for skinning when people can just buy it from a vendor!
---
The difference is that Salv is a given for an alliance raid, TA is a luxury that you will rarely see. Shaman are going to be located in melee groups and the tank group for WF, and rotated into healer groups for Mana Tide. If your raid has enough shaman to have a dedicated TA'er, consider yourself lucky.
---
There are some treasure chests in Duskwood along the road which you can nab if you run with 1 or 2 other lowbies to draw agro and hope they survive long enough against level 20+ wolves so you can loot the chest.
---
The arena chest will be camped by dozen of players having the same idea as you though ;-)
---
Actually, that arena may be the closest you can come to a lvl 1-10 battleground the first few days of the server.
---
\- Winning the fishing event will become harder and harder
---
\- Getting devilsaur leather will become harder and harder
---
\- buying twink items will become harder and harder
---
\- finding a group for lower level dungeons will become harder and harder as the big masses outlevels them
---
Nothing can ever break Rogue stealth
---
&gt; I played vanilla too, although I was very young and just caught the tail end of it, but I remember things being harder too.
---
There was a short preview of classic last year after Blizzcon, and it was as hard as I remember.  It may be a long time back for some folk, but I'm old and I remember 2004 very clearly.   Trying to level a druid on Teldrassil and Darkshore was really hard - the mobs hit hard, had an aggro radius the size of Australia, and I had almost no armour and my damage seemed like pin pricks.
---
I guess the problem was that they did this all in one big swoop, while also changing a lot of things radically. If every expansion would only change some zones (best case a gradual change every patch) and not in a too extreme fashon that would have been way better. For example, one expansion could contain:   
---
- Open Mount Hyjal   
---
- Alliance builds up a camp in Badlands, sparking conflict with Kargath which is an extremely valuable outpost for the Horde   
---
- Horde tries to extend Orgrimmar into Azshara, leading to fighting between Orcs, Night elves and Naga   
---
- Add Grim Batol as level ~28 dungeon   
---
- Add Gnomeregan into a smaller scale capital and rework the Gnomeregan dungeon as a high level dungeon   
---
Again, these are just some examples would could be done.
---
A hunter would fill the gap better than druid or priest. Play what you want and what you think is fun above all else.
---
You had better set up shop on a PvE server - you wouldn't last long on a PvP server.
---
Wasn't attack speed normalized or am I totally misremembering that?
---
Otherwise, I'm not sure that it would make enough of a difference to justify a different pet. Slower would be a little stronger synergy with that specifically, but like other people said it also procs less, so wouldn't really be all that much better.
---
yeah i love this technique. you can see the question marks above their heads when you pull it off.
---
It's whatever the 1.12 version is
---
1% spell resist is going to make the game feel new and different? You literally wouldn't even notice if they were side by side unless you were actively looking for it. That won't change anything much.
---
Ahh I hadn't considered Windfury totem, this helps to ease my concerns. Thank you! :)
---
Dal'rends and draconian deflector are still great pre-raid gear. Reed and the crit ring from last boss too.
---
Later on, ace of beasts, skill books, turban, and NR gear from gyth.
---
Also tier 0 for those who want to go for the tier 0.5 quests.
---
I really don't think UBRS is the best example.
---
So close but I think my hype has peaked too soon
---
They reverse engineered numbers?
---
Yeah, they basically guessed. 
---
Also, these issues compound on one another, how much spell resist a boss has is affected by many factors, maybe they missed a debuff effect, maybe the debuff is inaccurate, and armor values are basically a complete crap shoot.
---
It's going to feel different, I'm sure of it.
---
What? The games couldn't be fundamentally more different, for one single reason. Classic encouraged and rewarded the player for interacting with others and working as a group. Modern WoW basically punishes you for working with anybody else since it's never worth the effort.
---
You're making me want to roll a Shaman even more. 
---
But gearing up seems hard if you have to compete with 7-8 oher Shaman! I guess that's the optimal amount you will want to bring?
---
What are you talking about? Fury is quite possibly the #1 PvE damage spec in the entire game.
---
&gt; waiting for patch...
---
And while I wait for that I do something different. Or try to find/look for a workaround. You assume that every bug will make a crucial game mechanic unusuable. Most of the time that is not the case. As long as the critical bugs can be fixed in a timely manner, I dont need a flawless product. You seem to associate a flawed product with a broken one.
---
I don't have specific I fo relating to gear. But Hunters are sick in PvP. Pets, traps, insane range, Hunters Mark on rogue/kitty.
---
When leveling as a Holy Pally in Classic... 
---
You won't be able to sit in a city, Q up in dungeon finder, and level your character doing dungeons.
---
You will actually have fight your way to the entrance and jump through it (you must jump when entering an instance portal).
---
Quests for dungeons are not offered inside the entrance.  You will receive almost all dungeon quests outside of the instance, quite often at the end of a long chain of quests.
---
Also, you will have to roll on leather &amp; cloth items.  The best gear for healing is rarely on mail or plate. Remind dps casters that you are a healer and may be competing for gear.
---
That said, vanilla wow is a social game.  If you don't start out leveling with friends, you will make plenty of new friends who will gladly run around questing and running 5-mans with a dedicated healer.
---
&gt;If anything, Blizzard is using data from private servers, because that empirical data is literally the best data they have
---
Wut ? Blizzard has EVERY last bit of 1.12 final data. What they dont have is how each patch change was done etc.
---
It's not about the tone or nature of the quests. Sure vanilla had it's silly weird quests, Un'goro was filled with Nintendo references. It's the quantity. Vanilla had a nice mixture of running all over the world, grind quests, chain quests, and the occasional quest hub like Shimmering Flats to mix it up. Cataclysm just went all in on easy quest hubs leading from one to the next and on pop culture references.
---
Yes you would.
---
This is againt the rules. Also there should be no wow tokens in classic because gold is a big part of the progression.
---
In retail buying gold is arguably "fine" because high amounds of gold are only usefull for cosmetics.
---
i dont think this works.   
---
But i have totally no reference....
---
Falsely announcing the company is going private, along with a $420 private share price WITH funding secured is a bit different than saying "Our warcraft MMO IP maintains the following sub count"
---
I salute you O7
---
Ok im going to hell for this...but the mount from Stratholme dropped. i told my group i rolled greed, they all rolled greed i wont the only need roll. Wasn't technically during classic but it's a classic mount
---
Getting Tidal Charm are going to be a bitch right from the beginning. It will be a major bloodbath there.
---
If you're super worried about inventory space, skip the warlock or hunter.
---
&gt; How many of you have bought subscription now because of incoming classic ?? 
---
What? No. Don't buy WoW subs now, Blizzard have no idea you're doing it because you're excited for classic. That's dumb. Buy a sub when Classic is out and never launch retail.
---
Only a few level ranges this works. Best to finish zone quests move zones rinse repeat. Then around 45 you start running out of quests for your level and chain grind or AoE grind regular mobs.
---
I wish the prices were that cheap.
---
Name is 15, server us 25, faction is 30.
---
But I want none of that on classic. After sone months im fine with allowing HIGH pop servers to transfer to LOW pop. Same goes for faction. Not a fan of name changes in classic at all. Also transfers should have a 6 month cooldown.
---
You dont buy tokens, i just say to you hey give me 300g in classic i give you 170k Gold in Retail. 
---
Its not my thing if you buy a tokens for these 170k Gold.
---
Remember back in classic and TBC, where you'd be called a noob and an idiot if you looked up something on Thottbot?
---
15 years later, the argument has made a complete circle.
---
It wasn't called vanilla. It was just World of Warcraft.
---
Haha yeah, all good.
---
"Games done, it'll be released tomorrow" would probably be the best approach at this stage.
---
There's already enough hype going around to sustain it without having to have a few weeks wait between the announcement and release. Keep updating with blue posts on the progress to make sure people don't totally lose interest (cos they all seem to spawn 104236 new youtube videos with people reading the content line for line o.O), but just announce it and give it to everyone \[almost\] immediately and everyone will lose their shit...
---
You literally would not. It would increase or decrease your kill speed literally 1% of the time, because that's how often you'd be at the breakpoint of it taking 1 additional or 1 fewer spell casts. Otherwise, it will take the exact same time and literally not be noticeable.
---
If that's "new" and "different" to you, please go outside more... or at least play different games for a change.
---
good ol ironfoe lost 1 extra attack with the patches. spirit of aquamentis was op in its original state as well.

**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | NA | Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;:**
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- While our main goal is to be efficiently and effectively clearing bosses in raids, our goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Have the desire to coordinate with other members, and have a good time!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, have fun and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- We will be raiding twice a week; **Wednesday** and **Thursday**.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST.**
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST.**
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we have 115 members.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
Our goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their ‚Äúsecond home,‚Äù away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. We've taken our years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. Please reach out via a direct message through the reddit forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Orders stand: ***‚ÄúBe Excellent!‚Äù***
---
&gt; has alliance druid flair
---
For sure. Will take me months to get 60.
---
Hopes:
---
* No server transfers. If a server gets too low on population, I prefer server merging.
---
* Charactes on only one faction per server, at the very least on PvP servers (which includes RP-PvP).
---
All joking aside, the one thing they CAN actually say in that is... is Classic launching in Q2 or Q3. Thats about it. Because thats relevant information to the investors about their next quarter income.
---
I don't think you understand how math, formulas, or programming work.
---
Lol all these comments are exactly why hunters will still think every weapon is a hunter weapon.
---
Napoleon was 5'5''. he is short lol
---
You'll regain all your interest when its released if you were excited by its announcement
---
Good bot
---
The thing about holy priest is, there's at minimum 5 of you, and those other priests PLUS every druid, pally (or sham) is competing for that healing cloth piece that isn't strictly for the priest class. Kinda is turning me off from it. Same with pally, I'd love to play pally but I dont wanna wear cloth/leather for 2 years &gt;.&gt;
---
Haha, would you imagine that? They announce that it will be released... in 1 week! Or at BlizzCon they announce the release date to be at the end of the event or something (although that's in October, so well after summer).
---
There should be some limitations as to what exactly can you change. Giving any spell 100x damage would make any class OP.
---
Better questions would IMO be: modify a single spell/ability for every class to have 0s cast time (or the same thing with 0s cooldowns). Which class would profit the most?
---
why would they? wasn't in vanilla and opposes the vanilla spirit.
---
See, there's this thing called "aggro". It's a very technical, very complicated roleplaying expression. In short terms it's translated to "the healer dies".
---
Not necessarily.  I have a ton of gold on retail but I dont play anymore.  I could empty my coffers there to buy tokens and trade for gold on classic.
---
I'll play a paladin. Will holy mainspec but might just quit raiding and go full ret sometime with the 2.5 AQ gear set.
---
Not only that but don't use it as a tank in 5mans...as a shaman, I'm already mana intensive as it is...I don't need to double my healing output just because you want more DPs....
---
Crown of the penitent never gave 3 MP per second. It's tool tip was simply corrected that it gave 3 mana per tick (or roughly 6 per 5). 
---
A lot of tooltips in early vanilla were either straight up wrong (being placeholder text that wasn't changed) or misleading to exactly what the item/talent is doing. 
---
Anger Management being one of the better known examples. It does indeed give you 30% reduce rage decay outside of battle, but it does so by causing you generate 1 rage per 3 seconds forever. Which out of combat fights your rage decay but in-combat allows you to generate even more rage than normal, since you'll generate an extra point of rage no matter what every 3 seconds. 
---
This tooltip went uncorrected for what the talent actually did until TBC, even though the first tool-tip wasn't wrong per-say it simply didn't accurately display EVERYTHING the talent did for you.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster üòâ in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

---
And Summer is 3 months long. So 5 months from the end of it's release window. If they have to push it back even a week, everyone's plans are all fucked. So yeah, they aren't gonna announce it yet.
---
If you are healing in a raiding guild (assuming you're not class/healing leader) someone will let you know what spec you need for the raid.  Outside of that spec the way that best suits you and tell the raid leader the optimal classes to group you with.
---
No mana cost crusader strike. 6 second CD and 130% weapon damage.

---
So the people who got unlucky and endes up on a dead server are just fucked? There needs to be server merges if that's the case.
---
If you have a good guild they will generally roll with enough shaman for 1 per every dps groups. So you should have tranquil air totem aka 20% reduced threat.
---
I think that's wise, but I'm excited to dive headfirst into that hell, just to witness it if nothing else
---
It's fixed on some pservers now, and, spoiler alert, the game plays literally exactly the same as before.
---
adding flying was such low hanging fruit. like they were scrambling for ideas and were like ‚Äúoh SHIT and you can fly now!!!!! isn‚Äôt that cool????‚Äù
---
Not sure how OP it would be, but having the cooldown of Recklessness, Shield Wall and Retaliation reduced down to like 5 min from its current 30 min cd would certainly be game-changing.  
---
Anyway, "Recklessness becomes a permanent passive and no longer increase damage taken" that would be pretty decent &gt;:)
---
That's a one-time case though: people prepared to make a permanent switch.
---
For this to become an actual black market it's going to need a less intermittent source of transfer than that.
---
You need someone who plays both enough Retail to make the money to buy the tokens *and* enough Classic to be willing to accept gold from Classic players for their efforts in Retail.
---
I think the more likely scenario is Chinese farmer types farming WoW tokens in Retail and selling them for RL money to Classic players on your run-of-the-mill Chinese gold farmer websites.
---
I walked out of Durotar lvl 11 with one looted 6 slots bag and it took me almost two hours of grinding to get that stupid Cats Eye Emerald. RNG will be RNG. You isolated experience doesn't prove anything.
---
Overall economy sure, but you can hit 60 with several hundred gold and farm the rest, there will be people with epic mounts fairly quickly.
---
Blizzard has all the data, why the hell would they need to rely on best-guess data from private servers?
---
That's not really how that works.
---
Yup, they would.
---
I'm not sure why you put quotation marks around guess, when it is very literally a guess.
---
This isnt an attack on private servers, it's just a statement of fact.
---
I was thinking in terms of profit (gold), would make sense to do it earlier.
---
autism
---
Yep I literally don't know how they are gonna get things like pathing AI any more right than pservers - it's not database data and that's the only thing they got?
---
Battle shout should be fine then
---
Don't be silly. We're talking about a small indie dev company.
---
I had to double check what sub I was in.
---
That aswell.
---
I didn't have internet at my home until I moved out. After I graduated college.
---
Good for you, that you know what kind of server you want.
---
I'm gonna roll on a PvP server. Hope we both have a good time :)
---
Absolutely.
---
You buy the tokens with real money in retail, if you are farming the gold in retail just buy the token with it if that was you plan at start.
---
This is about buying the tokens with cash in retail and trading the gold from the tokens for gold in classic.
---
There is a lot of guesswork when you don't have access to an actual Blizzard server. Videos and screenshots only give you one piece of the puzzle. This explains a small part of it:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/834nt5/felmyst_ai_system_research
---
No you buy a token an retail or 2 and sell it for lets say 100k Gold.
---
Then i go into classic and say hey you wanna give me 500g in classic i give you 100k Gold in retail.
---
And since you know you can buy a token for 70k Gold you say ofc i will.
---
Neither was right click report and loot trade (thought they found a decent solution) but here we are.  Thing is, people make a tantrum about almost everything but that question is simply not presented enough. In the end it's a money making service and if people don't speak up, it might be pushed and eventually deal damage.
---
We're in 2019, people hardly like anything that can't be played solo, which creates toxicity. Money enables you to overcome your bad reputation, Activision wants money and they know very well that they can exploit people that are toxic and can't stay at one place. This shouldn't be allowed in Vanilla and while i agree it's anti-classic, i don't trust Activision.
---
No, not that I recall.

Do elites give any more experience than standard mobs of the same level? I was always under the impression it was about equal but I've never paid a lot of attention to it.
---
There is litterarly zero rogue items being changed except dal rends loosing 3 defense :D if you exclude the pvp rewards, or am i missing something?
---
[A][US][PVP][MST]
---
I'm going to be rolling a rogue or warrior and am looking for an active guild to play with and sometimes raid with. I've got every other Saturday off and intend to take two weeks vacation time on release to play my heart out. 
---
Goals:
---
&gt;My focus will be getting pre-raid BIS and raiding once or twice a week as I can. I'll likely end up PVPing a lot once the ranking system comes out.
---
Qualifications:
---
&gt;Rank 10 in PVP, cleared up to Twin Emps during classic as well as several other heroic raids during WoW's lifetime.
---
Hell yeah dude, I'm expecting anywhere from 6-12 months for my first 60!
---
I love to just fuck around and do nothing in game
---
It was implemented in patch 1.11.xxx something so it would be blizzlike.
---
Me and my friend used to 2man Ghamoo-Ra as a Warrior/Paladin combo at around level 26 for farming purposes (not the boss, a certain reagent in the area.) It took ages but it was worth it as we had 1k gold by the time we were level 40 (new characters on a server released late 2006). But naturally that boss is incredibly basic, we couldn't do the entire instance.
---
That's probably the reason my main was a female
---
Oh right, sure. I guess, but as others have pointed out, you'd have to have someone willing to farm in classic for retail gold. I have no idea who would be doing that.
---
Well, if you put it that they are "fucked" then sure they are.
---
If you'r scared that this will happen, wait a day to play and chose server after that.
---
The thing is if these server changes and all other pay-actions exists, other problems occur and people take advantage of that. I think it's a bigger problem for the community than just start over in a new server.
---
Just my opinion
---
To be fair, warlock tier 1 and most of tier 2 is trash for pure raiding. For PvP though it's great because of all the stamina. They also have the best looking tier sets :D
---
&gt; I don't care if a value was off by .001, that is going to make a drastic difference to the game play.
---
That's a problem of you not really understanding the definition of "drastic difference" the same way other people do.
---
Elites give more, depending on how many players you're expected to be fighting them with, to offset the exp you lose from being grouped.
---
2 man elites are usually only about 2.5x the xp value of similar level enemy. 3+ can get pretty high.
---
Gamer suicides at an alltime high
---
I'm still torn between Hunter and Shaman.  I've mained a hunter forever and absolutely love the class.  I played shaman in wrath for a bit and had fun.  I will still probably end up maining hunter, but I'll end up leveling shaman too I bet.
---
Give death coil a chance to permanently delete the target character on hit.
---
Great way to put it into perspective. The wait doesnt seem as bad now.
---
That's only one example. How many other of those that we don't realize exist? Could be 1, could be 1,000. 
---
Point is it's not a completely accurate representation of what classic will be. It's an emulation.
---
Sure can. I've been on the Deathwing server since the game launched and while these days it's moderately lower pop, until at least Cata is was ridiculously high pop server and even then I never felt like unwanted PvP or constant gankings was a major concern.
---
Not to suggest you won't get ganked or corpse camped by the enemy. It will absolutely happen. But it's not going to be your main experience with the game.
---
Priest. It was my second overall main and is a boss in vanilla. 
---
Also Mind Control
---
&gt; But gearing up seems hard if you have to compete with 7-8 oher Shaman! 
---
It's not that bad tbh since you start with throwing in set bonuses on T1 and T2 pieces with consistent drop chance, + a mix of the offset gear depending on what drops.
---
So make a paladins seals like a shamans totems. I like it!
---
Not even a rogue's abilities?
---
Depends a lot on class. For locks and mages it makes sense to use 2 pieces of rank 7-10 gear along with the their other raid gear due to the set bonus - and the fact that T1 for caster classes sucks. 
---
I think for hunters the set is pretty decent. 
---
For healers / tanks the PvP sets are obviously not optimal (rank 13 for druid tanks is the exception)
---
You wouldn't be able to 3 man gnomer once you get to the dark iron hallway if you are around the correct level for the place.
---
That makes me  feel a lot better for some reason
---
True, but as a single individual, unless you're the absolute fastest leveler on your server, you probably won't get any unfortunately.
---
Starting from week 1, on most servers you'll face a fierce competition of organized groups from both faction aiming to take full control of the spawns and the market, until the demand on the server is too low to make the hunt worth their time. Which could happen earlier on Classic servers than private servers because lower population so lower demand, and busted 1.10 items so not the only option anymore.
---
You know the majority of people won't fall for fake cast HS in 2019 right?
---
You'll have to to the regular fake cast, as in start an actual heal, and then cancel it.
---
Playing against warlocks in pvp is not like Russian roulette
---
 **&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; Alliance | NA | Normal/PvE**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Weekends only. Aiming for two nights a week.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:**  [https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H](https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H)  (mention WoW Classic)
---
Only against people so bad that you wouldn't need it anyways.
---
Well, good for some laughs, I guess
---
Release date coming at E3
---
Well in leading up to classic I have leveled every class to 20, just to get a feel for what I like, and on my pserver every single character has has at least 3 6 slot bags by level 10.  The example I gave was on the extreme end of good RNG, yours is on the bad end.  The main point here is that bags drop, on my pserver anyway, at a far higher rate than vanilla.
---
Enjoyed everyone else's screenshot collections so I figured I'd post some of mine! Leveling, raiding, but mostly a lot of funny moments and screwing around.
---
Yes! Someone else remembers. It was actually "what are you dong here", though, and known as Dong Island. :)
---
I think the name has been lost to time though. I tried searching it recently and while I got the obvious expected results, nothing Warcraft related. :p
---
TBC
---
I love the spirit of this comment. Let's all do the thing that makes us smile and support each others vision of fun.
---
Windfury weapon, 99% chance to proc.
---
Leave that 1% for the challenge.
---
&gt;The biggest hidden thing that we dealt with is armor/resistance values for bosses. The WoW atlas has some values for these things for regular world mobs but the information on what armor or resistance values specific bosses should have is a complete mystery. The only piece of solid information I found was a screenshot of a hunter using Beast Lore on Maexxna:¬†http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg
---
There is no way of knowing if 3731 is just the armor for Maexxna or the armor value for all bosses.
---
^Straight from the Nano AMA (Nostalrius dev) right on this very subreddit.
---
Conjure food, creates stack of 100.
---
It was just my experience that everyone is doing Jed+Rend and I rarely seen full runs. Could be that full runs are done in guilds, not with PUGs.
---
The older ones buff only stacked once but lasted longer, while the newest one stacks 3x times but lasts shorter. Which ever is best depends on:
---
a) What boss you're fightning and what amount of armor it got.
---
b) the proc-rate of the sword.
---
Because you can buy game time with it, do you think no one would want to buy gametime with thier classic gold ?
---
You are going to have that amount of same class in your raidgroup in most cases(classes) anyway. Don't use that as deterrant to playing a class. It's 40 man raids and you are going to have more than 40 players in your guild.
---
I never started a character with having the best gear as the end goal. Even back then I knew it was an absolutely ridiculous time sink and now that im a mature adult I have even less time available.
---
Im just here to enjoy
---
I second this comment.
---
Rogues are the least affected from these changes. Dire Maul satyr‚Äôs bow would be the biggest if it was on the list as it is a 4 agi difference.
---
Drood. I can shapeshift as a f*cking cat and lick my ass isn't that amazing??!
---
This is a great visual. Thanks!
---
I'm REALLY hoping the paywall, smaller servers, and actual repercussions for being a douche instead of just rolling a new email will help bring back the more "original" environment.  I look forward to casually playing with people, joining a guild of more like-minded people, and just doing random things.  Don't get me wrong, I like the end game stuff, but I want to be able to log in and just do whatever and not feel as pressured to grind to 60 then clear all the raids.  On pservers, (at least more recently), it feels like there is just a amalgamation of trolls, bots and gold spam.
---
That is true. I had both these items in TBC on my fury warrior and the trinket was considered BIS-ish even after the haste Nerf. I believe I used Dragonspine trophy along with the expertise trinket from Magisters terance through-out Sunswell progress.
---
Fish in 1.1 actually vendored really well. Well enough that Blizzard actually hotfixed fishing out of the game in zones that dropped the expensive fish until 1.2 rolled around with vastly nerfed prices.
---
Hunter, because I like the invincibility, speed and freedom it gives in PvE. And because I will probably get fed up with WoW again so around halfway BWL raid progression and that's the moment hunter dps starts lagging a bit compared other dps classes, while it shines during my prime dungeon &amp; raiding moments (MC and lvl 60 dungeons)
---
And you can buy Thunderfury and items with real money from GMs too.
---
I'm definitely going to miss low lvl bgs while leveling my first character(s). So I hope we get to phase 3 rather quick and then make those later phases much longer.
---
Sold.
---
I expected that, and a few other things, yes.
---
They got most stuff right. Not everything but most. Don‚Äôt expect to have most things different in Classic.
---
Hunter: Tame beast now works on druids in animal form.
---
Heard this happened in early alpha.
---
No, the old version was a DEBUFF meaning it affected everyones dps making it much better.
---
There's more info on that if you followthe link embedded in the class avatar, at the top of each coloumn.
---
Just a reminder of how far we've come :)
---

Thunderfury has gone through many iterations from vanilla to tbc. The procrate has changed in the following manner:
---
Vanilla: 30% --&gt; 15% --&gt; 20% --&gt; 25% (final adjustion in Naxx patch).
---
TBC: Made it not stack with thunderclap anymore.
---
&gt; Anyway, "Recklessness becomes a permanent passive and no longer increase damage taken" that would be pretty decent &gt;:)
---
probably would still struggle vs. frost mages, so thats a yikes
---
Yea so these changes to items brings the biggest nerf to rogues throu the enirety of vanilla... Smh
---
This time we will get special bugs. A rushed classic will not have bugs in the sense of "it doesn¬¥t work" but rather "it works like legion".
---
they are deluded and really don't take this into consideration.
---
/thread.
---
oh shit, yea thats right. I had forgotten that.
---
Atleast we'll still have Annihilator in classic. https://classicdb.ch/?item=12798
---
I'd say the better Hunter experience overall in a raid may be Alliance, but I don't think it would be enough to justify picking one faction over the other.
---
I'd suggest picking the race you want to be, cuz you'll have a lot of playtime on it.
---
I think people are overplaying the expectations that you'll tank. You'll be able to find dungeon groups just fine, and raids will be no problem. As mentioned warriors are top DPS in vanilla, and are generally in demand. In my experience there are a lot of them though - so you may have to put in some effort. I've run plenty of instances with fury warriors, and even arms warriors on vanilla servers. Druids can tank instances just fine, so you may not even have to fight over the great all the time. 
---
That being said, you will greatly increase your ability to find groups, a guild, and get gear, if you are willing to tank once in a while.
---
Yes mobtagging as this is called worked completely fine in vanilla. You could even do it in dungeons
---
How much gear AP will folks have on average in IQ?  Im just trying to figure out how much of and affect this racial has in end game (2%, 10%???).  I.E does 50AP from racial isnt that great when gear AP is 800 or whatever.  Anyone know?
---
I was often broke when playing in vanilla... One of the things I noticed was that if my subscription lapsed, I could still reactivate it with my debit card that had no money on it. You'd think this would result in an overdraft or outright rejection the moment you submitted the card, but for whatever reason, Blizzard immediately re-enabled the account for one day, and after 24 hours passed, the account would get disabled again when the payment didn't post.
---
I used this "feature" off and on, sometimes going as long as a week and a half of essentially free play with no actual drawbacks to either my account or my bank account. It was weird such an easy way to avoid paying for the account existed. Probably got a total of a few months of free play with that method all things said and done.
---
Classic will not have wow tokens.
---
If you want to farm gold for sub, you will need to do so in retail
---
Don't forget you will fight for gear with enhancement shammy's while leveling after 40.
---
Low effort? gah i researched the original video to get the top picture put together with the bottom meme picture so they matched.. oh well.
---
It's simple...you don't.   Unless you're extremely lucky and have had a base of 25+ people from pservers that are following you to classic you just have to constantly recruit.  As a GM you know leading a guild is a revolving door.  Unfortunately people come and people go.  I would expect to see TONS of /1 and /4's in game of guild recruitment over the first couple weeks.   The guild I'm an officer in has been scouring the reddits and such to get people in our discord casually since we are a couple months away.   It's amassed a pretty good number(I think we are around 35 active discord members now?) 
---
Just gotta roll with the punches my dude and once classic comes kick in those recruitment afterburners! lol
---
Warlock. Because it's Warlock.
---
especially a rogue's abilities
---
Same, i was so happy as a Ret paladin ! Lol
---
At least we can agree that the quality of pservers will vastly improve when classic launches. Just in case they fuck it up in a few years with dlc ans whatnot.

ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.  
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Except it was? Server transfers were available mid 2006, several months before tbc came out. Weather they are healthy for the game or not is a matter for debate however.
---
Dire Maul won't be out at launch though right?
---
Half a year to get the honor system and a year to get first bgs and something else than MC and Ony would be just crazy. Most people would have quit long ago. I don't mind the later phases taking longer as theres more to do by then but the first phases shouldn't last long. Something like maybe 2 months for phase 1, 3 months for phase 2. Phase 3 could take like 6 months and phase 4 could be slightly shorter 3-4 months as it's mostly the same as phase 3. Then phase 5 could again be at least 6 months and the last phase 6 would then last, well, however long it will.
---
You think waiting a day will be able to predict things like server population and faction balances? This stuff can change a lot during classic's lifespan.
---
That's not how math works jesus christ.
---
Diablo 3 is pretty fun if you haven't played that before.
---
8 Slot Bags are 25s without honored, or 22s 50c honored.  
---
Seems about the same for Horde and Alliance then since Teldrassil and Silverpine are both far from Ironforge and Stormwind ‚Äì¬†Mulgore and Durotar.
---
\#stopthegoldbuyers, #saveWoW
---
Haha, was it really dong? It's been so long. I also tried to find details, but all I found were the old posts where people thought it was GM island.
---
Iirc GM island was a place we could get to, then they isolated it off in an their own instance.
---
They do on some. Nost was originally one of those, too
---
Oh, so now you're trying to attack semantics? Oh I see.
---
windfury!!
---
The 15 days /played until you finished the bow quest or chromagus drop ;-)
---
Still a complete guess. Proc rate on ironefoe and all other proc based items were so broken it was insane. One of the many many reason melle were so overpowered on private servers.
---
Everything you said in this post is misguided or plainly wrong.
---
Did you pass third grade math?
---
Come on, we all know it will be delayed.
---
You can see from videos that those debuffs were used and stacked back in retail vanilla too.
---
YOU DONT KNOW HOW THE RANKING SYSTEM WORKS STOP SPREADING MISS INFORMATION.

**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**
---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST Wednesday/Thursday
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for \*\*all roles\*\*. Having experience with the content is a bonus, but isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary.
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: [https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)

**Contact**: Here's how to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before applying:

World PVP? What world PVP?
---
^^^^This ^^^^comment ^^^^was ^^^^sponsored ^^^^by ^^^^the ^^^^PVE ^^^^server ^^^^gang.
---
Sure, what I mean is it's probably a hell of a lot easier to farm the gold in retail yourself with a boosted character, than to farm on classic and find someone you trust enough to make the trade, but I could be wrong on that.
---
Not faction balance, but certainly server pop. Just chose the one with high pop and most likely it will remain high pop a long time.
---
Zug zug

He has Crohn's disease and has had part of his intestine taken out
---
It is a span of time also known as "about 2 years"
---
Love the pics! I didn't know about the optional action bars until about level 40 lol!
---
This would be awesome. :)
---
Blizzard has the database which stored all those values, as mentioned in the blizzcon panel.
---
The OP is hoping it feels like a new game due to private servers making up outrageous values. He is going to be sorely disappointed, as are the people hoping for abilities to hit twice as hard etc.
---
You do realise they've just spent the best part of a year re-creating the game because it doesn't exist, right?
---
If you actually bother to look at any actual data comparison between vanilla and a private server, it's likely the private servers are more difficult.
---
Idk how to link it to you. But it is currently pinned to the top of the reddit.   "Looking for group monday"
---
That is the purpose of a BoE. It is meant to be traded in for gold which then you can use to get another BoE that you can use. But mind you there are always player who demand they get it because they can use the item right away. You really need to talk about this before your run.
---
I mean in 40 man raids there will be a lot of every class, probably. Play what you like.
---
Please don't be vague and generic. Name a specific thing and then reasoning why finding good enough evidence for its accurate working is impossible. Once we have found thing that could be completely wrong, (e.g. warlock pet summoning), we could speculate its effect on the game (none).

 **&lt;Ricken Mortis&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server**
---
Hey! Listen! &lt;Ricken Mortis&gt; (Guild name tentative) is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to be among the first 5 guilds to clear naxx on our server. However we will never sacrifice a good time in exchange for this objective, we firmly believe good times and positive communication will hasten our advance.
---
**About Us**
---
We're an easy going, fun loving guild, who plan to explore every nook and cranny of Classic and be in the first 5 guilds to clear naxx.
---
We currently have 35 players committed, and are on pace for 175 players by early August.
---
We acknowledge that the first to every benchmark will be [dedicated try hards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y50I4KI_o9c). We're going to be the big party having a good time in 2nd. Our goal is to maximize fun, and while winning is definitely a lot of fun, it's even more fun to win as a team without some [annoying officer whining about that time you got hit by a raid boss's ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lo9kmcEw0w), or missed your interrupt, w/e.
---
We're going to support each other while leveling, we're going to pool our resources so everyone can have their mount at 40, if you're roleing warrior alt or another class hard to level, we can pair you with someone else help the leveling be more efficient.
---
When it's time for raid content, we're going to make you watch youtube videos on all the engagements and write a test to prove you know your stuff, and we'll make sure your gear/consumables means we have a chance at clearing.
---
Once that's out of the way, it's all good. No pressure, lots of laughs, wipe often and have an amazing time.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
We plan to have a large guild, with multiple raid groups to accommodate many schedules and precise raid times will be voted on and hammered down at launch, however to give you an idea, we're aiming for weeknights between **7pm - 10pm EST** 
---
**If You Want To Join**
---
Please PM me, and I can add you to our discord server where we congregate, discuss plans and get hyped!

GL gettin that over a warrior
---
Yes you can.
---
&gt;and have had a base of 25+ people
---
40+
---
FTFY
---
I really wish I had done a backup of all my Vanilla screenshots. This time around, I will document every small step my main will take on his journey to glory. Level-Ups, sweet loot drops, close battles with the other faction, profession gainz, nice interactions with strangers... can't wait!
---
"Stranglehorn"? Should be Stranglethorn
---
That is the purpose of a BoE. It is meant to be traded in for gold which then you can use to get another BoE that fits you. But mind you there are always players who demand they get it because they can use the item right away and not an hour later after you traded it. You really need to talk about this before your run.
---
There are of course BoE that are not worth much which means players will often just roll greed because it doesn¬¥t matter when someone falsely claims it.
---
&gt; whereas windfury
---
Well, if there's a hunter heavy party with the shaman and no warriors etc, shaman will drop grace of air instead of windfury, right?
---
You can also wait patiently until the server has matured and there are less players going through Arathi.
---
Oooh man! Can't wait to play this freakin game!
---
Inncorrect.  TBC was released Jan 16 2007.
---
* *WOW TCG Heroes of Azeroth* (released October 2006)
---
   * Riding Turtle was in this set.
---
But where‚Äôs the limit? I can say make Moonfire hit for a billion dps.
---
This dead work in classic wow, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it stays. Also it works better in dungeons and dropping party
---
I'd rather they make their deadlines.  I've seen enough empty promises of release in the game industry for one lifetime.
---
I never played Vanilla Wow, I started in MoP. I still had the experience that most people talk about having in classic, where I was able to make friends in LFD and we quested together and did world PvP in STV, and it was just a good time. Hope I can recapture that with Classic.
---
I also hated at how Sunwell island you could essentially skip all T3 to T6 content and go straight for the sunwell raid (well, to an extent).
---
I didn't manage to hit 60 in vanilla so I don't know if the catch up mechanics were this severe back then too.
---
I'm the mage so I've got absolute confidence in my ability to manage polymorphs and vending machine.
---
Alliance is significantly better in pvp.
---
Im pretty sure elites has 3x the hp and 2x the exp
---
Can confirm. Am also 5 ft 5. Am short.
---
This is dope!
---
Thank you for the lovely screenshots
---
I'm gonna do this. Early on everything will be so cheap because the economy won't have much in it, but when time passes they will skyrocket. So, I will be saving every mat I get in my bank and saving to sell later on, and probably trying to buy cheap, wait, then sell high.
---
&gt; Concussive shot cleansed
---
wat
---
&gt;false rumor
---
Yet after playing 2 hours on the most popular private server I found what I thought were significant mistakes on the echo isles in Durotar compared to what I remembered back in Vanilla. 
---
Went and checked Joanas leveling video and found that the lightning shield on trolls did 50 % more damage than they were supposed to. Healing was also significantly increased, and thanks to private server repack the monsters would cast their spells a lot more frequent. 
---
Private servers are doing an amazing job. But I don't understand why people cling to the idea that mob / boss values are correct when it is so easily refuted and when even the PS creators admit that it is the case.
---
You'll be able to level, but the problem will be at max level when you're out in Sillithus doing CC rep and stuff like that. The'll be bored mages figuring out how to find a position to blast you while you're standing right next to a guard and other forms of griefing that are harder to get away from.
---
Beautiful looks so big
---
Warrior is top anything in vanilla.
---
If they had a healing spec, they'd probably be the best healer as well.
---
Indeed. It still surprises me Activision seems to be allowing them to take this approach with Classic. I'm as hungry for a release date as everyone else but would rather they not push it before it's ready.
---
We're all hopeful for summer but also have to accept it may not be then.
---
Execute actually kills.
---
Can't they just make tokens not sellable in the classic version?
---
You only become useless in TBC (but you do rock in arenas)
---
It's magical.
---
Shamans want str, hunters want agi. Not really.
---
I am no expert of pvp by any means, but I feel that for a successful pvp druid you need the following stats: stamina, intellect, healing power, armor.
---
So if you mix and match pve tank gear with some heal gear (only leather, no cloth!) especially those with int+stamina on them, I think you are at a good spot.
---
Then slap on some engineering caps, boots, trinkets to maximize your potential.
---
Didn‚Äôt Thunderfury have a 80% proc change before the nerf? I remember Kungen saying that it procd on almost every single hit.
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying old school runescape lately. I never played it as a kid so it‚Äôs certainly not fond memories that are letting me enjoy it. The graphics were a little jarring for the first hour or two but I‚Äôm having a good time with it which is pushing me towards thinking that gameplay alone is enough to enjoy an old game.
---
Does is come with a sick cutscene animation too?
---
Especially after this year when they pushed CoD out a whole month early
---
I set pretty realistic limits in my examples.
---
One of my favorite things to do in vanilla was in DM Tribute runs.  When you pop the Gordok Ogre Suit and talk to Captain Kromcrush to bypass him with it,  Captain Kromcrush   
---
 gets angry and enrages because you tell him Guard Fengus called him a gnoll lover.  I noticed that he stays a hostile red if you aren't the one wearing the suit so you can talk to him (apparently this is because he has his own faction to make him appear friendly and allow you to talk to him while wearing the suit.)  Once I noticed this I made a couple macros that just made me type into party chat: "oh no .. i think i messed it up."  "oh shi\*\*\*\*\*\* i did, i messed it up ruuuuun, here he comes!!!!", then I would watch the panic set in as my party would see him enrage and start to run towards them.  Rogues would pop vanish, hunters would feign death, others would just try to run away as fast as they could until the boss finally ran past them without actually showing any signs of attacking anyone and they would realize I was joking.  They would curse me for giving them a heart attack and I fully plan on doing this again ASAP.
---
It ain‚Äôt happening. The only guilds who will pull it off are the ones doing it right now on Pservers.
---
Just ghosts running around murdering people
---
Seems pretty obvious to me that coming up with a plan and advertising now is better than starting from scratch
---
* Create a guild
---
* List Goals
---
* List Raid days and times
---
* List rules, processes, etc
---
* Find people who's schedules work for the days/times, and have the same goals
---
* Expect to keep a 25% at best when the time comes
---
I don't get it, what's your beef?
---
Well some guy played a Mage with a Steering wheels so I don't see why not lmao
---

---
Your new pet keeps spending all of your gold to repsec to boomkin form and only moonfire spams now.
---
Class is broken now totally unplayable
---
These are some pretty complicated reasons but I just like getting angry and hitting stuff with a big sword.
---
If you mirror that arrow of where we are now in April around release date, it would be more exact.

 **&lt;&lt;\[OCWG\] -- AUS -- ALLIANCE -- PVP -- SKILLED BUT FLEXIBLE RAIDING -- ENGLISH&gt;&gt;**   
---
Guild Name: Oceanic Classic WoW Guild (vote on our actual name - just prior to release!)
---
Primary Timezone: AUS GMT +10 (SYD/PERTH/SG) \*\*Guild Dungeon's\*\* from 7pm, **Raiding** @ 9pm-11pm. Quick raid's a good raid!
---
Contact info or discord: [https://discord.gg/ZZkGJkk](https://discord.gg/ZZkGJkk)
---
**Description:** We're a guild with a focus on the 'good' of playing WoW. We know a lot about Warcraft and while we care about doing really well (top 10%), we also don't want to freak about BiS gear, MOST viable spec or overdoing it.
---
You value positivity, friendliness and respect while believing respect also means *putting in the required effort* rather than expecting to be carried.
---
We‚Äôre all busy be it jobs, family or real life ‚Äì it‚Äôs simply not realistic to expect an ‚Äòalways online‚Äô mentality. Some months you'll be at raid every week, others you'll need to miss a few. You want to experience the smooth clearing of dungeons/raids that without overdoing the time commitments and not balancing life.
---
You want a guild that has flexibility for YOU. However, you believe your teammates deserve to have you turn up when you say you will. 
---
**\*\*Ethos in General\*\*:** Turn up when you say you will, don‚Äôt be upset if you can‚Äôt participate in a certain dungeon/raid. Believe that people should get gear relative to how often they participate and focus on the guilds success before your own. Be excited about helping out guildies, the leveling journey and reliving the best MMO-RPG that ever was
---
If that sounds like you, or you want to know more about our Ethos - come join us as we countdown to the announcement of the release date (and then countdown to actual release)
---
I don't play or any have experience in the most popular pserver. But both pserver groups have some intentional changes too, like the 6 slot bags dropping more often.
---
Anyone expecting all (or even more than 60%) of the people they recruit to stick around is being very optimistic and will likely be let down.
---
However, most guilds I've talked to aren't expecting that. Most are recruiting 60 or so people, and still figuring they'll need to PUG up with another guild in the first few weeks since not everyone will actually speed level/stick around.
---
Hardcore guilds are also usually already active on private servers, at least to some extent, so they get to test out people who want to join. It'll be pretty easy for a lot of them to transfer over to classic, since they already know their core raiders will be invested.
---
The problem is with guilds that aren't active on private servers. They're pretty much going to be a crap shoot of who sticks around, but even if you only get ~10 or so people to stay, it's pretty likely a larger guild will be open to mergers if you manage to hit 60 in the first few weeks.
---
My feels
---
I set pretty realistic ideas with my examples
---
What you really need is a good mindset for ganking: If you are ganked too much or are corpse camped, you should switch zones to solve the issue. Do not bitch about it on the world channel or forums, just move on. If you keep calm it won't really cause you much issue.
---
I've leveled on a gigantic pserver after everyone got 60 and even in STV i was fine. I played druid though. Sometimes some silly 60 was camping the rebel camp, but then I just moved on to Desolace for a day.
---
I agree. 
---
I think a lot of private server purists will be disappointed with how much easier a lot of instances are going to be in vanilla. 
---
The private server repack where mobs autocast spells non-stop makes everything significantly harder.
---
But what if there is a secret black market for all of the grey items. What if mobs are constantly gathering resources and trading them for crappy grey weapons and armor
---
Blizzard has explicitly said the API for addons will be different than retail because they want to preserve the classic experience and don‚Äôt want to allow modern addons that ‚Äúplay the game for you‚Äù so to speak.
---
Yeah and I never pretended I liked everything about Vanilla.
---
CRBG was the beginning of the QOL changes that ultimately destroyed WOW communities.
---
Right? There's no way the devs know exactly when it's going to be done, classic (heh...) problem again and again in software project management. I'm going to feel bad for them when it's not ready at the arbitrary time that other people think it should be and they need more time, causing morons in this sub start attacking them over breaking a "promise" that was made up by their external facing departments and not the actual people building it.
---
I think you mean &lt;10, the alligator eats the bigger number.
---
People that think they are going to easily find 60s to join their raids two weeks after release are delusional. Leveling will be slower due to competition for mobs and on PvP servers places like STV will be almost unplayable. There will only be an extremely small percentage of players per server that are 60 two or even three weeks after release. Raiding guilds will be spamming Ironforge/Orgrimmar for lvl 58s to join their MC run.
---
Holy paladin or resto shaman, to heal. I like healing more than tanking, and don't much care for DPS outside of solo content like questing and farming. Level as ret/enh, can still heal 5 mans while leveling, but my end-game goal is healing, probably PvP rather than PvE.
---
PvP is often a funny chain reaction. Someone starts to kill another player, that player gets pissed of and kills the next best enemy and so on.
---
Dual wield spec:.  Your white hits heal you for damage dealt.
---
I thought people did this by having a high level friend run them through a dungeon, tag mobs, drop group and kill them. Lowbie gets the XP or some such. This was nerfed in TBC I think. So it should be doable in vanilla.
---
man that is so cool.  i love the adventure these screenshots tell.
---
i may be missing something, but how did your character portrait change from dead eyes to bright eyes?
---
Exactly.  Even 25 is hard.  So the idea of going into launch with 40 guaranteed slots and correct class distribution is just not realistic for like 99% of guilds

There are a few guilds/cliques from the pserver scene that will start with very strong rosters. But even they will be recruiting for the reasons you just said. The number of people who say they‚Äôll rush 60 is much larger than the number who actually will push through it. Most people get burnout around level 40 or so when they‚Äôre pushing 14-16 hour days, which is what‚Äôs needed to do second-week MC clears. 
---
If you want to get into the most hc/no-life guild on your faction/server, the easiest way is to quickly get to 60 on a desired class (anything but hunter basically) and just seek them out in game.
---
I suppose it doesn‚Äôt make a difference for those of us who never played on a pserver.
---
Spirit of Redemption is now an always active Stand.
---
I love supporting/healing and Priests have the most well rounded kit combined with a decent offense. They're not as lethal as Shamans, not as tanky as Druids. A nice middle ground.
---
Can I have some water please?
---
Didn't see a single void walker. Leveling must have seen you in melee a lot. It looks like you had melee in the 1 slot for awhile lol
---
 &lt;Midnighters&gt; is looking for players to come own with us.  NA|PvP|Horde|PST  Raid times:  Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST  Tue a possible 3rd day if wanted/needed.  We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.  While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.  We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be ‚Äúpre-raid‚Äù raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.  We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.  Contact Funnyman (Discord: Funnyman#4802) Or, you can head to  [https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters](https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters) and  apply! If you can't reach myself hit up Veepy#5623 Or join us in discord: kdw4gSN
---
Spot on. Especially agree about the hard time gating. My last thought before quitting BfA was how sick I was of what I started calling "come back tomorrow" game design.
---
Some days I don't get to play at all, others I get lucky and get several hours.  Those days I'd think to myself "I have the free time [i]now[/i], why aren't I allowed to continue questing".
---
Found old HDD with a few vanilla screenshots.  Wish there were more, but only a few.
---
Yep the Goblin game will be strong this time. Made Millions in Mop and aiming for 100k on Classic
---
This is just a post about after naxx guided with walls of text. Use search.
---
Crusader Strike = 31 point paladin talent in Classic.
---
Give warriors heroic leap baseline in Classic. 
---
Give Rogues Cloak of shadows... basically give any Classic their new abilities they got in later expansions but not give others theirs.
---
As some one who raided sunwell, that‚Äôs not really accurate. Sure, you could enter,  but without mostly BT gear level players, even the trash would‚Äôve been hard af.
---
It‚Äôs interesting how reward drive people are these days. When WoW first came out, people pvped cause it was fun, people raided south shore cause it was fun. Some camped wetlands docks, other flight points, this was all before honor. 
---
Now everyone has to optimize the experience for maximum smoothness. Everyone is adding r14 weps to bis lists despite how insane that grind is‚Äîit‚Äôs just assumed that if you‚Äôre serious you‚Äôll go for it.
---
I dunno, I‚Äôm looking forward to classic cause it removes so much of the retail and modern gamin in generals rat race of collecting points. I‚Äôm looking to raid stormwind cause it sounds fun. Grind up timber maw rep cause I think I may be able to make some money‚Äînot cause I need the achievement to unlock flying in 16 months. 
---
Many who played in the day would tell you the games PvP was best during pre bg days, and balance was best at the zg patch. 
---
Leveling to 60 will take most ‚Äúaverage players‚Äù longer than 1.5 maybe even 2 months of rl time. Blizzard isn‚Äôt, or shouldn‚Äôt, be developing and designing around their ravenous hardcore #NoChanges crowd. Vanilla wasn‚Äôt built around them, neither should classic. If they get bored, fuck em, they‚Äôve got a wow sub‚Äîgo check pit retail while you wait.
---
Druid with cyclone would be amazing. This would be great for everyone honestly
---
I played during the actual vanilla and remember the process. Before they added the cloth turnins, there was only 1 guy who got exalted with a different faction (a gnome who got exalted with stormwind) because he repeated a turnin in blasted lands / swamp of sorrows that for some reason gave a bit of reputation every time
---
Even then, once they added the turnins getting exalted took quite a bit since only runecloth was available to be turned in endlessly; there's a cap on for example wool cloth turnins so you can't just farm that to get rep up to exalted. With that said, downvote me all you want but feel free to come back to this reply when, surprise surprise, you won't be anywhere close to exalted once you are level 40 on your dwarf.
---
Sorry, we‚Äôre full on rogues
---
Yeah as long as there is no de facto token market in classic, this will not affect the vanilla economy. There's nothing stopping people from playing vanilla for 3 months, and then playing retail for a month to make more token gold. Blizzard wants retail players to play retail regardless of how they pay for time. Blizzard also knows a portion of vanilla enthusiasts won't play retail for tokens, thereby securing the additional cash flow they always intended with the rerelease of classic.  Here's to hoping everything I said makes sense and remains true.
---
&gt;Prior to aq40 they can top 10 dps easily
---
AQ40 is Stage 5, which if you assume 3-6 months per stage, is anywhere from 12-24 months before Hunter raid DPS falls off.
---
I think the rushing of p servers have made Hunters seem like they fall off faster than they really do. This is something I don't think many people take into account when commenting that Hunter's suck. Were all going to be sitting in MC/BWL gear for a long time.
---
It¬¥s like they butchered Diablo to harvest the mechanics to use for WoW because that game was making them more money. And then go mobile with whatever was left.
---
or fortunately depending how we are looking at it considering people where saying how much easier it would be with most up to date items.
---
Blizzard has a working 1.12 reference client, so there's probably a lot of comparison to be done but very little guesswork.
---
Sure...just don't ride any horses
---
I joined a semi-Hc guild a few months back.
---
Right now we have close to 60 people in the guild.
---
15 are old members because the guild is a rebirth of there old vanilla raiding guild. 45 people are trial.
---
We keep on recruiting people with solid applycations and a noticable knowlage of what the game is and how much of a commitment it is.
---
Ofcause there are people not up for it. People will leave. People dont like the game or people reroll to  diffrent realm because friends started playing there. That has always been the case.
---
But starting with 60-80 people with solid applycations seems "save". I think 50% will stick and stay. 
---
If a guild say they wanted to do MC in the second week I call that bs. It is possible but to gather 40+ people with the leveling experience of a speedrunner? The chances are slim. If a guild manages to do it. Hats off, nothing but respect.
---
I would go druid for sure. You should tank. Druids are better for dungeons as they aren't gear dependant like warriors. Paladins are great for heals in any specc, easy with BoLight. And can pull aggro and have more survivability than priest/druid healers.
---
Mages are awesome for dmg and CC.
---
Druids can CC in outdoor instances with roots.
---
Waiting for a challenge where someone raid tanks with bananas.
---
Vampiric Touch in vanilla?
---
Kodos &gt; everything else
---
Buffing the raid content would be changing it. I was just calling doubt to pservers interpretation. 
---
That said, in the next iteration of classic servers, I‚Äôd like to drop the debuff limit and buff raid mob health pools.
---
what do you think the tree should look like as i progress with them.
---
I can go ret for leveling and just keep the same tree for healing if we do dungeons, we might be doing both quests and dungeons, we will mostly play togheter and will maybe be 4 people in the group.
---
I didn't feel that MCP was a significant enough increase over a properly enchanted Draconic Maul to be worth the effort, but if you want to farm for it as a 60 druid it is fairly easy.
---
You seriously think you would notice a mob resisting 6 out of 100 spells instead of 5 out of 100 while not actively keeping track? That's completely ridiculous.
---
pretty sure it works on you too (;
---
This is the TBC prepatch I think.
---
What am I looking at here?
---
Doesn't need one. Warriors are already cool enough.
---
No, Blizzard has everything from 1.12. They have their own internal copy of 1.12 running so they can check things to make sure they have it all right.
---
Also take into consideration that leveling will be harder due to vanilla had 15 min res pawn timers for non rare and 1 min timers for rare compared to pservers where they are reduced significantly
---
Lol I was about to mention that too but figured blizzard will modernize the game in some ways.
---
Heh, I was gonna say Blizzard doesn't always release complete and bug-free games because I can remember Diablo 3, Wrath, TBC T5 raids, Overwatch bugs.. but that's still astonishingly rare compared to many other companies. Really sad how far the gaming industry has fallen.
---
Buy twink items cheap.
---
Nope, you had to convince your guild to let that alt through MC if you wanted somewhat decent gear. Or pay a guild to let you through.
---
That was if your guild still kept doing it when the mains didn't need gear there, like mine did forever and ever.
---
On any other genre id probably agree but eith an mmo there ssooo many parts and so many things that can conflict. It would be a nightmare trying to keep it all working. Youd definitely go grey before you should.
---
There‚Äôs still the rank decay. Testimonials from people who were hardcore grinding in the day, suggest that getting past r10 pre bgs was virtually impossible. 
---
The way the ranking system worked, it required you to be top 10 standing on your faction to make any progress in those upper ranks. For example, you need 4-5 weeks of standing 1 to go from r13-r14. Miss standing 1 only 1 week and you get knocked to r12. That was all changed with the honor system update. No one knows how the new system interacts in a bg-less world.
---
As the rules are not its not against the rules, you can just trade gold for gold between servers if you trust the person.
---
I can see that beeing a rule a few month after classic release where it will say something "Trading digital goods between games is not premited and will be banned" or something like this when it blows up that alot of ppl doing that.
---
I find it hard to believe. When the so called beta (which was an internal alpha) was leaked, the sub was like "oh yeah it makes perfect sense that if Classic would be released July 16th, public beta would be this month". Because of this I'm less hopeful that July 16th would be possible than I was before.
---
Drop tables are definitely off, i.e. as a rogue I am reliably able to farm [Gut Rippers] off sturdy lock boxes at an alarming rate (say 1 in 200 boxes) which is so far off that I've already farmed and sold over 50.  Drop rates are NOT accurate on private servers, same with how spammy some mobs are with their abilities.  And I am fairly confident stealth detect radius is just wrong, where its either impossible to stealth up to enemies or you can literally walk through them if you're any level above them.
---
I personally wouldn't let a Warrior tank my dungeons without a shield unless I knew him really well.  It's asking for trouble because random groups encounter enough issues and sometimes don't finish dungeons as is, less their tank dies without a shield it's going to be a blamefest.
---
It's amazing that it's written by Terran Gregory.
---
I would say Chinese gold farmers in the spirit of #nochanges, but luckily Blizzard is bringing vanilla banwaves into 2019. Imagine a vanilla experience with waaaay less gold sellers clogging trade chat.
---
Put in my termination letter 2 weeks before that date.
---
That was pretty much completely average height in the 1700s.
---
Did Sunwell not need attunements? Everything up until BT did.
---
I have several friends who want to level warriors and making a resto shaman to heal and provide windfury is just too hard to pass up
---
I was referring to the incredibly high level gear "sunwell badges" gave tbh (from dailies) - not attunements.
---
I'll be maining a rogue. Throughout WoW my two most played classes have been prot warrior and rogue. I don't have time to tank the way I want to these days, so I'm gonna go rogue.
---
As much fun as it would be to think that private servers got a lot wrong, the reality is that it's actually heading in the opposite direction. They way Blizzard is moving with their decisions, the private servers might just be a better Vanilla experience. 
---
The one thing that the vanilla private servers really fail on is the inclusion of BG's at launch to satisfy the Pvp'ers and keep populations high as well as dynamic respawns. The truth is, while this isn't like a true vanilla launch, I worry it will be closer to the original experience as compared to sharding, right click reporting, bnet integration, no progressive itemization, etc.
---
I'm ok with this. I probably won't be able to raid in classic wow, as I have kids and a lot of responsibilities - but I would like a world where someone who's put in a ton of effort and time to be able to shine over someone (like me) who's just mucking about.
---
**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** [H] [NA] *(Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST)*
---
üî∫ **INTRO** We are known as FREE HUGS! (Yes, we give free hugs.) We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend a lot of time raiding and obtaining those sweet epic and legendary items! We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for World of Warcraft Classic.
---
üî∫ **RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting any core classes such as: Priests, Mages, Hunters, Druids, DPS Warriors, Warlocks, Rogues, and Shamans. Although we are small now, we hope to grow into a powerhouse guild that prides itself on our close knit community.
---
üî∫ **SCHEDULES** We will raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We will begin raiding within a reasonable amount of time after release, allowing for everyone to level/gear up. We are open to bending the raiding times based on our communities input. We will be doing dungeons, farming and pvp on our off days.
---
üî∫ **OUR GOALS** We will clear all raid content through naxx at our own pace to ensure our quest for legendary items and epic quest chains. We aren‚Äôt as hardcore as some other guilds out there; we won‚Äôt be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their pve and pvp goals !
---
üî∫ **BONUS** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced classic verterans in the guild with a passion for teaching all things WoW! We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious classic adventure.
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614 and I will personaly welcome you to our family!
---
Source or GTFO.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm looking forward to classic cause it removes so much of the retail and modern gamin in generals rat race of collecting points.
---
I don't disagree with you, it is indeed interesting how reward drive people are these days.
---
But I don't think Classic will change anything about that because it's more a consequence of the players mindset evolving than the game itself in my opinion.
---
Most people will play Classic just like any 2019 game. Look up things, read class guides, rotations videos, boss guides, BiS lists... They won't take a step back and go in blind just because it's Classic if it's been part of their "gaming habits" for many years.
---
Science!
---
Mages don't come with cupholders; they're dispensers and that's *it*!
---
Damn it‚Äôs crazy how wows gone so far down the shitter it‚Äôs going to play off the stupidity of its customers n force them to go full circle back to the start
---
If I told you why, then everyone would want to do what I'm going to do. I hate being copied.
---
My biggest fear with that quest is with so many people, it‚Äôs gonna be tough trying to complete it without being interrupted
---
Yes and no. The thing with vanilla is that you can easily afford to have half the raid in shit gear and still get pretty far into both AQ and Naxx. There are relatively few gear checks in there. Another odd thing is that the "catch-up" loot introduced in vanilla is either really fucking good, like AQ/Naxx level good, or completely useless. I guess the confusing itemisation is a thing in vanilla and tbh I quite like it. There's a random head-piece that drops from Azuregos, the first world boss, that is literally better than T3. And that is available when MC is the current content. Then you have items like the warlock T3 ring which is on par with MC/BWL loot despite dropping from Kel'Thuzad.
---
True but what if it forced the character you're killing to watch the execute animation while you just continued on rampaging ang being op?
---
Gold &gt; everything
---
\- time is money friend
---
Can you elaborate on why you are expecting it? And is there an expected release date for 8.2?
---
I parents wouldn't pay for anything.  Did chores at my friends house for HIS mom (who played WoW) to get a sub.
---
That is some "monkey's paw" shit right there.
---
you're right.  When shadow priests were OP before BC came out.
---
I wanted to leave myself breathing room from the ravenous horde saying I never played Vanilla for giving such an unrealistic cleartime. Lol
---
But like what's the downside? You now have a lazor chicken as a pet that just moonfire spams everything! You would be unstoppable
---
No. I want them to watch my glorious ass saunter away and execute their friends.
---
"Unfortunately the oldest screenshot I have! I leveled as a mix of Destruction and Demonology aka the opposite of a good leveling build" me_irl
---
TIL 3% increase is absolutely bonkers. 
---
By that logic the Tauren health increase is B A N A N A S.
---
Fair enough
---
Of course it does
---
Get vendor recipes
---
True actually
---
Yea I remember. Friend of mines farned AV for some time. Everyone was dead with 3 instand dots. He just stood in the middle of the battle killing everyone. Ended up with 100+ kill and a few deads is some games.
---
Just some glitch with hoods/hats on female undead. They must have fixed it at some point
---
As a port warrior I‚Äôve never been huge on world pvp. But that‚Äôs just because I was always the guy getting dropped.
---
You didn't "refresh" it, you "replaced" it with a fresh new COA.
---
You seriously think that's how simple the resist mechanic is?
---
Who we are: &lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We‚Äôve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We‚Äôre now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don‚Äôt make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual. We are serious about clearing content but can‚Äôt dedicated our lives to playing all day any more. We want people who are serious, on time, and want to clear content in a timely manner. This means when we raid at a certain time we are all in the raid at that time. Not all logging on at the time.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. For three hours a night. Currently looking at Tuesday and Thursday 7/8-10/11 EST. For loot we run Loot Council. We prioritize giving loot to people who are actively trying to help the guild. This includes showing up to raids on time, attend raids regularly, help other guild members to get them raid ready, contribute items to the guild, listen to directions, etc.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. You can check what we are looking for on our website linked below.
---
If you have any questions you can message me on discord @ frail_#3482
---
You can find our app at: https://boaf.enjin.com/
---
Hey, kinda like retail.
---
/S
---
And they can easily reintroduce them in phase 6 because of this.
---
**&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
It really depends on the population of each server. I think even on vanilla they had created a list on forms for certain servers with demon respawn timers and you had to sign up to do the quest (or get killed by 10 angry hunters).
---
If there's a will, there's a way !
---
ah cool cool.  so there isnt a secret way of changing faces in vanilla :P
---
No change üòâ
---
I made a hunter last month, I left at 14 as well and someone in zone chat gave told me the same thing.  Lol
---
I simply did all of the quests and that's where I ended up.
---
I have two friends who plan to level with me. I will play a mage, the other will play a Warlock, and the third will play a Holy Pally. Between us, we figure we can farm, CC and quest our way quicker if he is holy than if he is ret.
---
For early levels, it won‚Äôt make much difference what he does. But at 30+, that‚Äôs where the grind begins, and having things like Imp BoW and Consecration will begin to outshine Ret.
---
Improved healing gear/specs will help him smash through PvP encounters with other leveling groups, while keeping us alive so we can CC and kill off the opposition.
---
He can bubble us, stun targets, pop heals, cleanse and drop judgement of wisdom so we can wand to regen mana and keep moving almost nonstop. Then all we need to do is find one more dps (optional) and a tank to run instances with (and we know another guy for that).
---
So... want to level as Holy during the opening days of the game? Do it. Find a rogue, warrior and a couple other players, group up and go nuts! It‚Äôll be quicker this way, I promise.
---
You are correct, he‚Äôs wrong.  Once everyone is done with prebis, UBRS is dead to the public.  Dps wants truestrike/dalrends , healers and casters want reed.  It takes warriors a long time for Dalrends and most of not all of them get the shield pretty damn quick.
---
That‚Äôs an alliance only reward tho.
---
Sine it's going to be on a 8.0 based client, it's possible that the ConsolePort developer make a version for classic.
---
This addon in awesome and is way better than using joy2key or anything else. It has lots of things made with controller in mind.
---
Important to say: While using a gamepad is awesome and way less strained on the fingers/wrists, you won't be optimal. Specially if you have lots of ground targetted aoes like Mages. But it's fun as hell to play like that tho.
---
http://consoleport.net/home/
---
You should include the lunch of Nostalrius and the Change.org petition.  We wouldn‚Äôt have Classic without those two events!
---
Vague and generic? I already gave you a link that explains it, don't expect people to spoon-feed your lazy ass. But since someone else here already found this, here's a perfect example:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/af8mmx/ama_with_nostalrius_core_team_members_starting_now/edwjvm9
---
Exactly. You can start with nothing on release or you can recruit ~80 raiders, have maybe 25% of them stay so you start the game with half your core raid group. 
---
And I can‚Äôt speak for all guilds but ours does have a active discord community and uses a pserver for practice and fun until launch so it‚Äôs not just names in a spreadsheet.
---
But they're actually just desperate to be noticed by someone. All rogues become sad.
---
Yeah the bag drops are absolutely out of control lol!
---
You seriously think you'd notice a 1% difference in spell resistance without specifically looking for it?
---
The only point where you dont need a shield is when you are geared, the healers are geared and the dps.
---
The point of no shield is more damage / more treat. Wich is only possible if healers can keep you alive.
---
Also its only worth if geared dps are have to hold back because of treath reasons.
---
Just wear a shield and keep your healer happy.
---
I‚Äôve debated recording my dungeons as raw footage to edit later at 60. Just to release a dungeon series on hey this is how i tank this dungeon. Here‚Äôs where I LOs pull etc just to make it easier for new tanks. But I have no video editing skills and I‚Äôm not a huge fan of my recorded voice. Esientially content from leveling dungeons geared towards tanking discussing the hard pulls of the dungeon pathing wether to attempt skips of certain packs or is it better to just pull them to avoid trouble
---
I think rushing to 60 and trying to clear MC worlds first or asap misses the point of the game
---
You‚Äôll end up using guides and knowledge etc to just ‚ÄòGPS‚Äô your way around the world without ever truly enjoying the best thing about this game - the fact that it is an explorable world full of danger and surprises (if you let yourself be surprised)
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, raiding and raid leading were my favourite thing back in 2005-06, and the bone I have to pick with a still living Kel Thuzad is one of the key drivers for me to get stuck into Classic.
---
I am saying though it‚Äôs good to take time to enjoy the ‚ÄòWorld‚Äô rather than just speedrun it all - whether that‚Äôs questing, world PvP, exploring zones, getting your fishing up or finding the odd trinkets and such in classic‚Äôs wacky itemisation 
---
The future guild I am part of is all of people who played and raided 2005-06, and the consensus is definitely to raid, but also to enjoy the march to 60, the gearing up process and the social fun of doing so.
---
Otherwise it really is just a grind following a script...
---
You can have have more than 30 keybinds in a controller.
---
What‚Äôs the interface add on?
---
Reincarnation no cd
---
Honor system without BGs lasted 2 months IIRC. So getting rank14 was indeed impossible before BGs because the fastest rank 14 requires 12 weeks when starting from 0.
---
Without BGs the system works just the same, the one who has most efficient farming method and who plays most will rank 1 and goes down from there. With BGs this is premade stomping pugs and dodging other premades, Without BGs this is camping and chasing lowbies. Whoever does that activity the most out of 24 hours each day will get most honor basically.
---
In theory people could collude and agree on honor caps, that's another way.
---
A good choice
---
No it's like Russian elections. 
---
One-sided.
---
You can use the consoleport addon so you don't need to use the steam's controller setting (which sux IMO)
---
I'm sure bosses will very close. But the leveling will likely be the biggest change. 
---
A lot more research has gone into boss fights than the world mobs.
---
This is a very real possibility. Seeing how pservers got world buffs wrong, boss fights will go longer and strats will have to change. Might even go as far as change a bis slot or two.
---
IF they go the convoluted route of trying to add content to vanilla I hope they follow the example of Jagex and OSRS and put changes to a vote requiring a decisive majority to make it into the game
---
You can't be there! That's illegal!
---
They end up naked and weapon less just tapping people on the back constantly trying to get attention. They die to aoe spam just so they can be in true ghost form and run around with people
---
Human Warlock. It's what I mained in vanilla and I miss how the class worked then. So much versatility and utility available and easy to level either solo ot with a partner. Good DPS and capable of pve and pvp.
---
The 1% is a chance to have one piece of your gear destroyed indiscriminately
---
Mount Hyjal. Closed area normally not part of the game.
---
I rest my case
---
Priest Mage Rogue for PvP
---
Druid, Mage, Shaman/Pally for PvE imo
---
Yeah, right, I hope we play on the ame server and you do it
---
It's the construction site on Hyjal zone, accessible using glitches during Vanilla.  
---
I have a very similar pictures with a few of my friends back then, it's my favorite screenshot.
---
\*rofl pwned\*
---
Yeah, the true WPVP pain came in TBC when someone could  chase you down and find you anywhere in the zone with an epic flying mount :(
---
Stacks of 100?
---
Look at Mr. Manabags here. 
---
Do you have soldiers who go out and do missions for epic loot and gold for you, too?
---
Thank you
---
No it's not
---
Do not have any idea how this was organized.  I found it on my old hard drive.  I remember creating this video.  
---
When patch 1.10 came out and the server maintenance was done in batches.  Everyone got on another server and created Taurens....  No clue why.
---
No... no it wouldn‚Äôt. The game was never balanced but adding newer abilities would make all of Classic a cake walk. Giving any class one of their newer signature abilities would be so bad for Classic. Not trying to jump on you my dude but Classic should stay Classic.
---
I belong to one of those guilds.  The key is to recruit everyone and promise nothing.  Let the players performance tell you who is Raid1 and who is Raid2.  Half those people won‚Äôt hit 60, a quarter will be keyboard turners and maybe you can muster up a competitive core of 40 after recruiting 300.
---
I have no idea.  This was years ago.
---
5-6 weeks if you just level and skip professions and extra crap.
---
I meant it would be a great way to make any one of the classes OP. I agree with you completely, I just meant for this one hypothetical.
---
Back in the day we had 2 locks with full soul shard bags logged out at Kazzak and all the world dragons and a few just random level whatevers to help click summon. To be included In raids our guild master had all of our personal phone numbers so he could call people to wake them up to kill whenever.
---
I love how it looks. It‚Äôs like an early version of Elv UI almost.
---
You do realize that dropping the debuff limit would only buff the high performers more than other classes and widen the gap between them and hybrids, right?
---
Oh I agree with you.
---
Ah yes, WoW Vanilla - the best Furry BDSM simulator that was never released.
---
I wouldn't want to see any char transfers in the early months/phases but would be open to it afterwards with a few limitations.
---
You can't transfer chars from older servers to newer servers.(can't have level 60 transfer over while other are still leveling)
---
There should be a long cooldown on transferring the same character after doing so, something like a few months.
---
I think faction transfer should be encourage more(even if cross server as long as above requirements are met) if there are unbalanced factions. Such as a low Horde vs Ally server should be open to and encourage players transfering from a high faction pop server to a low faction pop server to help balance out the faction pops.
---
A lot further than that honestly
---
I'd love to see it
---
Source for what?
---
Windfury adds 3 extra attacks and can proc off itself.
---
[The best one.](https://i.imgur.com/C7IKuP4.jpg) Damn... I look forward to AQ.
---
Yeah if i'm able to hit 60 by Christmas i'll be pumped
---
You recruiting any priests? :D
---
No. You can‚Äôt.   I see you never played Vanilla or TBC.
---
Depends how flawed
---
Yes, yes, and absolutely agreed yes!
---
I'll try to think about it when I get home.  
---
I've actually lost all of my WoW screenshots except the directory who contains all the screenshots of me exploring zones that are supposed to be inaccessible, like this one
---
Isnt priest pretty decent in pvp?
---
Thanks, I do remember that the character panels, bags, etc were NOT skinned at all.  I just had the action bars, chat frames, character frames skinned.
---
was the BC pre-patch
---
Troll druids are sin.
---
I meant Mana Spring, oops.
---
If rage is as wrong on pservers as people have been saying, then it won't be 'some things will be wrong', but it'll be 'some things very wrong'. Rage is kinda fundamental to both PvP and raids.

---
**Who are we ? :** A core member of 6 players since TBC, joined by IRL and Online friends. We are currently around 12 peoples.
---
**What are we looking for ? :** Motivated and friendly players that are looking for a nice environment to partake on the PvE adventure of Vanilla. Every role and class are welcome.
---
**Schedule :** 
---
* **Wednesday** 8:45 pm - 11:45 pm CEST
---
* **Thursday** 8:45 pm - 11:45 pm CEST
---
 **What we expect of members** : We expect from our members a certain level of dedication and preparation, be it from class knowledge to consumables during raids. 
---
**Dsicord :** Add me on discord if you have any question regarding the guild. Arthe#8725
---
I'm going to treat it like a real expansion release. Take a few days off from work. Play my heart out!
---
You want to be able to do 5 mans without waiting hours for a tank. Play a warrior and don‚Äôt be afraid to tank. Then you‚Äôll have your choice for almost any dungeon in your range.
---
&gt;our guild master had all of our personal phone numbers so he could call people to wake them up to kill whenever
---
Is it wrong that I kind of love this?
---
It's not spoonfeeding when you say "all things on vanilla pservers are so wrong and completely guessed!" and I ask for any example. 
---
[Onyxia deep breath is random](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/al7xom/til_onyxias_deep_breath_is_apparently_just_random/). "But is it the same random as real vanilla?" Well, I ask, how would a player be able to tell the difference? 
---
Pserver random vs vanilla random's effect on the game and meta on a scale of 0-10: 0. Next issue.
---
I don't think switching to another character is usually necessary. WoW is a game where there are usually 2-3 zones at your level you can travel to if necessary. In my experience if I was getting ganked heavily in one zone, I just made my way to another for a few levels and came back to finish it up later.
---
there certainly seems to be some advantages if you can wait 2-3 weeks after launch.. but i don't think I will be able to resist haha
---
If you're planning on doing gathering professions and save the materials for leveling professions later, you will need bank alts to just mail the shit to.  Mail staying in the mailbox for 30 days....before 30 days is up you will most likely have larger bags and hand me down bags to send your bank alts and between their normal bags and bank slots you should be able to store everything while you level.
---
Skip both that quest chain is a waste of time.
---
Ahh, the batphone. Those were the days
---
You're a victim of overhype.
---
Once you realize games aren't made for you, but for the devs and publishers making them, you can relax.
---
And the worst thing you can do is advocate, or even appear to advocate, against the thing that an entire sub exists to advocate for. I know it's not what you intended, but the post zero'd out for a reason. Find a reason to play, don't find a reason to play. Nobody's job to convince you. They've all made up their minds.
---
This is not a meme. This is an actual photo taken of me at a recent family dinner
---
Once you start attacking it's just like a machine gun going off until they die
---
I made a post about this the other day - apparently nobody cares.
---
Yes however Kungen originally rolled prot paladin so this is makes sense from that perspective.
---
You‚Äôre right. They couldn‚Äôt be fundamentally more different. People like you are literally proven wrong time and time again but refuse to acknowledge the evidence. 
---
For the record, I enjoy Classic more and can‚Äôt wait, but I‚Äôm not going to lie to myself and others about the experience it‚Äôll be.
---
Nope. Recent private servers are roughly 90-95% accurate to retail vanilla.
---
Moonkin form allows casting restoration spells.
---
 **Eminence** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you‚Äôre like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you‚Äôre busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you‚Äôre ready for classic already‚Ä¶ so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we‚Äôve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence‚Äôs Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
**Loot:**
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP loot system
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you‚Äôre in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you‚Äôre the type of person we‚Äôre looking for. A lack of high level experience isn‚Äôt a deal-breaker but it‚Äôs definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through website or through us on discord). We are 30+ members strong!
---
**Raid days and times** (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!

Horde or Alliance? PVP?
---
I actually hate totem management tbh. But I'm also a picky/whiney bitch so that has a lot to do with it.
---
LOL...saw that coming
---
Definitely, but you can also have your alt saving up double XP is all I meant to say.
---
Druid is insanely strong, if you go hardcore. for casuals (who for example dont care to far. consumables or pummelers), not so much.
---
Yeah that would be crazy. As long as you could keep mana any physical dps could never kill them
---
Hunter shots already don‚Äôt reset auto shot timing. You want to use Aimed Shot between two autoshots. You‚Äôre asking to be able to autoshot while you‚Äôre casting Aimed Shot.
---
You should include Stoneform. It's a deal breaker in the decision. Removing poison, saving the raid for that extra cleanse = more healing for cleansers, less damage taken for you.
---
‚ÄúJust be thankful it wasn‚Äôt my epic mount you got hit by old man!‚Äù
---
\*slaps shield\*
---
this bad boy can fit so much damage in it.
---
Also, my group needed a tank and i like the old rage mechanics.
---
Nope. I was in a guild where we shared phones. It was pretty good for a long time. I still have some old contacts in my phone, even though I haven‚Äôt called/texted them in years.
---
...come to think of it, maybe once they announce the Classic release date, I may message them and see if they‚Äôre still around!
---
Id rather be the wife!
---
Also we need a bluepost on whether totem stomping macros will be back in classic.
---
How fun are warlocks in vanilla? Are they similar to playing a hunter with pet? Or a fancy fire mage?
---
Windfury, has a 1% chance to fail.  In that case, the enemy gains windfury to their foot and kicks you in the balls, having 99% chance to proc windfury.  Windfury has a 1% chance to fail....,
---
Yeah, classic won't have wow tokens. Or gold Trading.

They are a pain and sometimes you wish you lived the simpler life as a paladin with blessings. But at the same time when you grounding totem that first AP PoM Pyro you‚Äôll change your mind.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to grind to 60, and find all the players who didn‚Äôt make it yet who ganked me along the way.

PAYBACK!!!!!

---
I can't wait to get rejected from multiple guilds until I find a chill guild willing to let me OT/DPS as feral druid :(
---
you pretty much never need to drop 4 totems. usually its 1 or 2 max in dungeons and any moving enviroment. so its not that annyoing, its just an ability like everything else.
---
So I had some ideas for post naxx, what if they...
---
Nice blog post.
---
Lmao I can't wait to say "what do we do after naxx?" In barrens chat
---
This fear of dead servers thing, it's a product of the private server Community alone. This fear did not exist when Warcraft originally launched in 2004. If somebody carries this idea into thenewclassic, they're going to be at a disadvantage.
---
I literally never got the shield. Took me until ZG to get a decent-ish shield
---
Agreed.  The real fun is making good friends on the way to 60.  
---
End game 40 man raids are tedious and, in the end, boring.   They are more about grinding to prepare for the raids  (e.g., consumeables) than the raid itself.  5 man dungeons are much more interesting and fun.
---
Ohhh good thinking!
---
I haven't run out of mana aside from spec changes since 2k14 lol no /s needed
---
tbh it kinda is. With the range limit you constantly have to restomp windfury and str totem sometimes also mana totem and melees go crazy when they don't have windfury.
---
There was a hunter spell in vanilla that gave you all the insights in to a mob on your tooltip. 
---
Armor values, health, etc. Most of these were documented correctly on sites like elitist jerks and to some extent wowhead.
---
To say they guessed implies a high likelihood of being wrong, when the reality is they got most of right because the values were there, if you knew where to look.
---
Here are my thoughts, I have been recruiting for my hardcore horde guild for a 2nd week MC for about 6 months now. I have 40+ members who have applied and made it in. Even if only 1/10th of them sticks around and is there come release, my time was still not wasted. Also i'm looking for people who are that prepared and "on edge" and ready for classic. The thing you need to remember is in classic wow recruitment pretty much NEVER ends. keeping a static 40 people to show up 100% is literally impossible people will quit and come back and quit again, only like 10% of people even make it to 60. Its all about Preparation, if i go into classic having 15 members that's better than starting at 0 day 1. A bif part of my community are people I have found on private servers that I have played with for years as well, and most people looking to do a 2nd week MC are on Pservers anyway.
---
Do you guys have any idea what should happen after Nacksramus
---
i've played Shaman all my WoW Career.  
---
Its not that hard. i've had a bar just for the totem,s you'll get used to it.  
---
Dont know why people complain about it tho.
---
I'm so confused and have no idea what point you're trying to make at this point.
---
Not happening unless your guild is running a dozen of hunters, in which case your shamans will probably keep dropping WF even if they‚Äôre in a hunter group. 
---
Hunters go in melee groups for that +100AP aura. If they can‚Äôt be in melee groups, you‚Äôre either running enough shamans to have every melee have WF+Trueshot or you‚Äôre running a bazillion hunters. 
---
If we‚Äôre talking dungeons where the group is something along the lines of druid tank/hunter/shammy/caster/caster, then sure.
---
I don't know what you mean.
---
Super geared combat rogue vs one handed warrior in mostly broken gear?
---
Or even just let it proc off of itself again.
---
I can't wait to rush to 60, then constantly gank all the casuals for the rest of their lives.
---
I don't believe they stack. It takes the greater run speed buff and uses that.
---
I could be wrong, I'm going off pure memory of classic. No private server experience.
---
&gt;That's also why Shaman and Paladin gear can drop for the wrong side. The loot-spawn system that is supposed to block that from happening, was also removed in the 2.0 patch.
---
This actually doesn‚Äôt happen on the bigger private server. Not saying you‚Äôre totally wrong because I know we had some xp values from tbc but I‚Äôve raided a alliance side a lot and have never seen shaman gear
---
Launch delays can only happen when you have a specific date, which we don't have yet.
---
I know it feels like it, because if this was any old Warcraft expansion we would already have a release date, but this is not any old Warcraft expansion.
---
Of you are that good, you don't need the add-ons, but you do need them, so your mediocre, with decent tech
---
Yeah small bugs are okay, but don't want any game breaking flaws that can break the economy or something like that.
---
Not really.
---
You only need to drop certain totems conditionally, even when in dungeons.  Such as just keeping Windfury Totem down for melee, knowing when to throw down tremor totem against certain mobs, and what totem setup you want for bosses (which is really the only time it matters).
---
You‚Äôll understand when Classic launches.

Oh man, the memories.
---
These are my quest mobs, there are many like them, but these are MINE!
---
Honestly a lot of people who think they know the intentions of other individuals in this thread.   
---
I started a guild this far out to get a road map of the guild going into classic. Recruitment has been pretty good so far, as it seems that there is a large population of WoW gamers that are excited for this game.   
---
I have no disillusions that the people recruited today may not stick around, and I am O.K. with that. I have even stated that I am not looking for people to commit 100% to the guild yet. For them to join the discord to chat and have a good time. And when we actually get rolling in game, that is when I expect individuals to have their mind made up if they want to stay or go.   
---
But the guild I have started does not really fit your "Week 2 guilds", I don't intend for us to start raiding til roughly 2-3 months after release.
---
Then dont play at launch. Problem solved.
---
In reality the meme quality of this sub does have precedent. It's from OSRS having some overlap imo. They've got the best memes it's honestly not even close anywhere else on the net.

---
Looking for like minded people who want to log in, clear content, have a laugh or 2, and then do your thing.
---
Community is important to us, hence the reason we are all stoked for Classic.
---
Of windfury could provide off unarmed.  Druid shaman guilds would so be a thing.
---
They're pretty tedious, yeah. You usually only need to drop 1 or 2, but it's still annoying having to do it EVERY SINGLE PULL, compared to other healers that just throw on their 60-minute buff and be done with it.
---
gotta be in the party to be in the same dungeon
---
I feel the same, where movement speed enchant/AB boots, and ghost/cheeta/catform/aspect of the cheeta are all considered the same "self buff" and just override to use the strongest value.  
---
But I would love an actual bit of data/evidence proving this to be the case, which I can't find anywhere.
---
This is assuming that people who play enough Classic (enough to get 500g) would even *want* to have the gold in retail.  
---
**Spoiler:** They won't.
---
If it isn't facilitated by Blizzard don't cry if you get scammed that is all I ask.
---
I can't wait to rush to 60 then constantly gank the casuals for the rest of their lives
---
Here's how it works.
---
You have a 60, a random and the char you want to boost.
---
The random is just there to make it 3 man party.
---
The lvl 60 pulls everything without tagging, this is where tanks do well. Additionally you have have 2 or even 3 60's so you can do massive pulls without damaging the mobs.
---
Then the lowlvl char leaves the party, gets the 60 seconds kick message, then does an AoE ability on all the mobs getting tag. Then the 60's kill off the mobs before the 60 second timer ends, the low lvl gets all the experience for himself, and they invite the lowlvl back into the group before he's teleported out.
---
Na people still want to kill drak for titan flask recipe (1000g+) and beast for ace of beasts (1000g) finkles skinner and a chance at pristine hide (400g+).
---
I'm sure there will be slight changes, but most will be completely and utterly noticed by all but the top tier raiding guilds looking at their dps charts.
---
The idea that they aren't even close and that they are so far off it will feel like a different game is just something people who know absolutely nothing about the p server scene say.
---
Do you like lightning?
---
Do you like seeing warriors occasionally one shot other players?
---
Does it upset you when you see a paladin buffing people and want to take those away?
---
Does the idea of being able to walk on water **like Jesus** appeal to your inner crusader, while not being a ~~field medic~~ paladin?
---
Are you great at micromanagement and able to use summon able totems to annoy your enemies with?
---
2 sunders and a revenge is plenty of threat on most trash probably all the way up to zf.  If you're low on rage get imp shield block, ~2 rage/5 sec. That's more than the amount you'd get from using a 2her instead of sword and board.

Horde | ‚öî NA-PvP ‚öî | Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.  
---

As far as I know they don't stack but whatever is highest value gets used.
---
At least this is what I found out because I was just investigating the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare which gives a run speed buff.
---
Well summer is basically a month away, dont you think they should give a release date at least before summer starts though?
---
A little bit, but they're also pretty awesome. The elemental aspect of them makes you have to consider which totems you can use at any given time. Is it more important to have proactive casting interrupts with Grounding, or is buffing my melees more important? Second, totems had a huge aspect of 2D thinking to the game. In a way the game is very one dimensional, the only thing that matters is your distance to the target. There needs to be some external concern to add a 2D nature to the game, for example where are the other mobs or players. Totems are a component that brings in another degree of spacial thinking to your play by determining where to optimally place them.

WoW combat sucks. Like, I hate it. It's boring. You just stand in one spot and wait for your abilities to be ready and push the button. 
---
That's why I roll healing priest lol. It's a lot more exciting trying to prioritize who needs healing, which spell to use, and when to use it. It also feels good to save my friend's life.
---
~~Wow. This sequel sucks.~~
---
Orc shaman, hmmmm.
---
Logic checks out.
---
*laughs in psuedo stun immune armored caster*
---
I always thought it was odd it was white/gold like a holy spell when it should just be green lightning.
---
Stop ruining my classic experience
---
That sounds right now that you mention it. It's been a long time, I just remembered the silence stopping charge. GUess its mage "silence" lol
---
It's not that bad. Early on most bosses don't move or barely at all, and you'll get used to moving them where needed as you do more PvE content. I put points into improved totems and was always in the MT group, was nice having that little extra utility. 
---
Shaman does have more abilities than any other class due to totems though. To me, that's just more options for any given situation. Even something like the resist totems can make a big difference in PvE or PvP.
---
Doesn't sit well with me that Brack is now CEO. Hopefully he stays far away with his modern design (that is making WoW for mobile gamers) from classic wow.

**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

I'm the opposite. Not having flying turned me off GW2.
---
That isn't how any of this works.
---
You can't buy a token for 70,000 gold if they're currently 120,000 gold. If they're currently 120,000 gold you cant sell one for 100,000 gold.
---
They're 120,000 gold.
---
Yeah, 29 is all around decent, 39 is really good and 49 is a bit meh, but still viable
---
Honestly just having imp gouge in the combat tree is probably all you need, those extra points would go farther in the sub tree
---
They guided and changed forecasts lower.
---
I‚Äôm expecting a massive beat and I have a ton of money on the line
---
That, and blocking the counterspell/silence by dumping down grounding totem so you can spam those lesser healing waves.
---
Because what you want is blizzard to reserve names for famous people, not get your name when the servers launch
---
The interest club are taking notes.
---
Thanks for the feedback. My biggest concern is accidentally asspulling with totems in raids or world pvp. Do all totems aggro mobs? I know that you can replace them to pull old ones up but it just seems tedious. Still, a small trade for an otherwise super high quality of life class that brings allot to the table I suppose.
---
I wish druid attacks in feral forms could proc windfurry. That would be great
---
&gt; 6 second CD and 130% weapon damage as holy.
---
Scaling with spell power @ 100% - I just came.
---
Imo Wrath had the best class design. Many specs became viable while still maintaining their identity. Also Ulduar aka the best raid of all time. But still there's flying and dozens of other flaws.

# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
‚ÄúThe Muffin Vendor‚Äù is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We‚Äôre going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn‚Äôt mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
We‚Äôre a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I‚Äôm sure a lot of others have. We‚Äôve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we‚Äôre all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla‚Äôs endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
While we have the ‚Äúbasic stepstones‚Äù covered (such as a MT and a minimum amount of healers/dpsers), we still have plenty of room for additional people.
---
What we‚Äôre looking for are mainly dedicated players. Which means, if you have the passion to keep on playing, and the willingness to show it in your commitment (i.e. show up for raids and group content, bring consumables, improve your game and so on), then you‚Äôre the kind of person we want to invite in our guild.
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
¬∑ A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we‚Äôll go far!
---
¬∑ Consumables. We‚Äôre not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
¬∑ English ‚Äì or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We‚Äôre currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there‚Äôs only MC/Ony and people don‚Äôt have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we‚Äôre planning to begin our raids at 8-9 PM server time (depending on players‚Äô availability). Exact days/hours will be set in stone once we get closer to Classic WoW‚Äôs release date and our ranks are properly filled.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you‚Äôll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.

How do i save this as a file
---
0/30/21 isn't a pvp spec for starters you go something like 8/12/31 if you want to flag run and otherwise provide support in team battles.
---
stam, int, +heal and armor are your stats like the other comment says
---
You could have felguards back then?
---
I totally forgot about grounding totem, now I'm even more excited about my choice, Enhancement Shaman going to skill everybody to death.
---
There is massively strong Nostalgia value in doing any number of things again. We are very familiar with this from the private server community. People want to play vanilla and replay vanilla, but after they've done that for a while, they want to move onto burning Crusade, and since they're coming from repeated vanilla playthroughs where they were grounded the whole time, they will want to fly because it will feel somewhat new again.
---
Less so than the first time they experience it, but this is how the private server Community work and only slower scale how blizzards New Classic &amp; Beyond roll out will work. With each playthrough, a person derives less Joy from a piece of content
---
I never saw shaman gear drop when I was playing alliance. And meeting stones were added in vanilla, they just didn't do shit, just like on private servers. 
---
Not sure where you are getting your information, but nothing you said in this comment is true.
---
Sorry mate, need healers
---
Check your emotional Reliance on this game. Blah blah blah emotionl crutch blah blah blah unhealthy whatever blah blah blah I don't know
---
I have raided alliance.  I have not seen any shaman gear in a raid, but I have gotten PILES of shaman T0.

LF semi-hc raiding guild
---
Server: NA East
---
Times: 9-12 est nights weekdays and/or 9-2 est nights on weekends
---
Faction: Horde prefer 
---
Class: rogue prefer
---
About: played casually in vanilla and BC, then raided heroic/mythic from Cata thru BFA. Highly skilled player with years of raiding experience. Looking to clear all raids including Naxx. Organized, experienced, and excited enough to be a class leader, officer, or just be regular raider.
---
Desired guild: pve focused with a serious attitude but a laid back starting date. Looking to join other older people working full time and/or married with kids that can‚Äôt play 12 hours a day. But very serious when raiding time comes and excited to play classic and relive the magic. I expect having to teach some players the nuances of classic, but I want a guild where the officers and most of the raid have extensive raiding experience in vanilla, pservers, or previous expansions. I also expect there to be serious requirements such as Pre-bis, consumables, hit rating, fire/nature resistance, and enchants, as well as maintaining a high level of attendance and performance. I want to join a community where in their discord there is an abundance of communication such as how the classes work, what talents to pick, what weapons to use, what enchants to use, who will be learning what professions, and helping each other with Attunements or class quests or dungeons. I also expect a ton of raid boss planning such as what debuffs will be used, what the raid groups will look like, what threat will look like and how to pull, boss positioning, who will be doing interrupts/stuns/dispels/kiting, etc, or when to pop potions.

prot pallies dual wield shields.
---
Summer is little over a month away, seriously can not beleive we dont have a release date yet its crazy..
---
And many of us don't know everything, but we don't know nothing, we know a middle ground of things and everybody knows a different amount of things, so it's sort of inevitable that when you group up with other people they will potentially know more than you and you may feel like they're taking away something from boss encounters where they already know what to do and may possibly spoil it for you. It's a slippery slope.
---
I faceroll raids as ret in full holy gear - because holy gear IS ret gear. 
---
That's wrong.
---
When they made it a smart heal it became god tier.
---
I am to be feared and revered. To quest in STV is to court death from my blades. My name will echo through general chat for hours. I will be the target of hate and adoration. Your tears sustain me.
---
I am a Rogue and you're already dead.
---
Imagine a ret in t2.5 gear with Might of Menethil or The Ashbringer.
---
Rets would be gods.
---
That spell only worked on beasts
---
Did makes me wince to think that we are going to have people who will be Ultra Classic purists wanting 0 changes, but then suggest outlandish changes for burning Crusade that follows.
---
Tryhard Paladin, well experienced with raiding / RL.
---
Looking for: Normal / PVE, [A] West Coast 8pm raid time for moderate progression / mediumcore raid guild.
---
I mostly like how low the bar is to make a new game. I'm going to go grab Final Fantasy 7, change Sephiroth's armor to be 2% less, then sell it as a new game now. You won't even be able to tell it is the same game with such a DRASTIC fucking change, man
---
Oh wow your screenshots bring back so many memories of my first character, also an undead warlock. They were a lot of fun and had many unique abilities. I only have 2 screenshots from back then, but here they are if you wish to see. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/IBO1a6I
---
I have a sickening feeling In my gut they won't make the summer release in time and it will get pushed back closer to winter.
---
Not having Spiritual Focus for PvP healing would be a big mistake.
---
You didn‚Äôt play bfa then
---
The way I see it, it went from being a world built by people that spent their time playing tabletop in ACDC t-shirts that cared about the 'RPG' and wanted you to get lost in the fantasy, to something built solely to streamline the game to get you to raiding asap by people that seemingly see no value in world building. Everything about Cataclysm's revamp smacked of the kind of self assured arrogance and indifference you see in modern game developers.
---
It is like grinding to exalted for the insane title, because I have gone insane waiting!
---
Any spec of Paladin leveling is viable. Holy, Prot, and Ret can cover the healing role well with some INT gear or a friendly Mage. Obviously, the roles do specialize more in their preferred roles, so a Holy Paladin will be able to heal easier, which can be helpful for "Prot Warrior" tanks. And since there's no real DPS checks, it isn't terrible to put a two-hander on and Seal of the Righteous and deal some damage if the situation calls for it.
---
Honestly the only role Paladins cannot do without specializing in it is Prot. The increased threat gen and defensive values of Protection are just too important, mainly due to the lack of threat a non-Prot specced Paladin can do.
---
Pvp as you level. Not fun to fight someone your own level who then comes back with their full tier 2 char and epic mount
---
How do we possibly know that?
---
"You should stick to what I'm saying" then says exactly what I had said, about making Vanilla historically accurate. You can't make it accurate, the player base has advanced Vanilla far beyond what it was. Merchanics, mob density, exp, proc rates can all be replicated. The gameplay however, won't be because people play the game differently. 
---
"Removes the ability to be perceived as they want to be in the world." 
---
There is a toggle, if you want to see yourself, your trees, your water in the way it was in 2004. Then click the toggle off. If you want to see WoW in a graphically appealing state  (appealing is subjective before you jump down my throat) with enhanced graphics. Click the toggle on. Instead you want to remove the possibility of players options on something that affects no one other than the person playing their game. 
---
If your argument is YOU want to look like an old model in the world and someone changing their graphics means they'll see you as a new model. Why do you have any more right to say what THEY want you to look like graphical than you? 
---
In terms of the Nazi comment, I can only assume your trolling because an expression, a saying or a metaphor does not make a person a Jew killing mass murderer. If my grammar is terrible and someone constantly corrects me, being a Grammar Nazi, telling me that I should do things this way and that way. That doesn't mean I'm rounding up a religious population for extermination, it means I don't know proper punctuation. Hilter imposed his beliefs and the way HE believed the world should be and oppressed the views, beliefs of others in the process. I think it is a pretty good metaphor for the way some people talk to people about Classic. 
---
"No you can't do this, have this, implement this" because it "Does not conform to MY personal requirements, wants or needs" for this game the community fought hard to get...
---
But wait, theres more. You walk through a portal and suddenly you port to an island in the sky. You're standing there on the stairs down to your first obstacle, Hellfire Peninsula. Fly mounts everywhere.... and this is where it all got fucked up
---
This is 2019 and there will be an uncomfortable amount of players who grief as their main objective. It will be more painful this go around.
---
I'm not commenting on the feasibility, just saying that based on that sentence they probably meant to use the less than symbol and used greater than instead.
---
But now that we're on the topic, once you're using shift states to get 30 binds on a controller, why not just use KB+M at that point?
---
I wanma have a chill time leveling. Therefore... Hunter.
---
Actually the mana cost isn't too bad. Judgment is not really powerful at all, so Paladins will be doing quite a bit of "spirit regen" between battles if one holds off using it.
---
Play dwarf priest and you'll even forget a thing called "benched" exists.
---
Well if your male IRL then play male and if your female play female, unless your one of those guys who likes to play as a cutie gamer girl which is pretty cringe imo.
---
Runescape you can level up magic
---
Have you even played on private servers for any length of time? Because your perception of them is seriously jaded. So many points here to refute but I will only address some of the main ones.
---
Majority of us are now in a different era of our lives. For some it may mean less time dedicated to gaming, but at the same time also means goals that are actively being pursued. Raiding AQ 40 / some Naxx bosses is absolutely achievable even for casual players and guilds. It just takes dedication. Which I think the *majority* of players back in the day did not have. They were content with logging on, doing some world pvp, maybe hopping in a few bgs, or run a dungeon or two and calling it a night.
---
And it was a BLAST. Because everything was new, and the whole world was a wonder. The majority of players *I believe* who played Vanilla and will be jumping back in for Classic, will still find the same enjoyment in doing those things, but it will lose it's magic a little bit. But their goalposts will change on what they want to achieve. They will strive and aim towards achieving the things they didn't get to see the first time around. Which is what you see on private servers from hardcore and casual players alike. 
---
Can't compare an 8k+ international server to an original regional vanilla server. But I think your "perception is still stuck on the past" and you will see a very different playerbase come Classic.
---
Don't forget Blessing of Freedom, one of the Paladin highlight spells.
---
Thankfully Shamans don't know how to Purge :D
---
I believe staysafe and esfand are rolling on the same pvp server.
---
Because it really sucks when you have to wait 45 minutes in queue just to play the game.
---
# &lt;MF&gt; A US adult raiding guild is LF a handful of quality adult gamers
---
**Who we are:**
---
Goal-driven adult gamers, just like many of you. Many of us are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers. We love our hobby and love accomplishing our goal with friends. Many of us play nightly while others play casually. We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
**Our plan:**
---
To raid, of course. Also, to just experience Classic wow all over again and to fully enjoy being back in the game that brought so many of us to this genre. Our core members have been gaming together for years and came from a guild that cleared everything up to early Naxx in vanilla. We are looking to raid twice a week (3 hours per night) with the goal of clearing everything the game has to offer.
---
**Who we are looking for:**
---
Adult gamers driven by a passion to succeed. We have the most hard core of players and also super casual members. We are recruiting raiders who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers. Casual members are also welcome. The goal is to make friends, kill lots of bosses, and make a ton of memories. Make no mistake. We are in it for the long haul. We want to provide you with a longterm home and a place to make some real memories. If this is the first time playing this content, or if you are coming back to experience it again, give us a look. You won't be disappointed.
---
**The important stuff:**
---
**Days:** Either Tue/Wed or Tue/Thu
---
**Times:** 9p - Midnight EST (8/11 CST). Invites start 15 min before raid.
---
**Faction:** Horde
---
**Server:** PvP

Playing Shaman is mandatory.

There's a server I can't name that sounds kind of like Night Finger that all of the FRESH locusts bailed on. Nobody runs 5s and it's completely dead except for a few very high end people that haven't burned out yet, and most people will burn out.
---
I think this will absolutely happen in classic and the next logical step is probably TBC or another fresh server. Players are going to be like locusts and devour the content as it releases on schedule, then burn out and quit. It's not a bad thing, I just think that's the natural order of things.
---
Well they have one of two good-decent face options.
---
So basically better than most of the Horde's females. *Gets ganked by an Undead Rogue*
---
They'll probably will whatever they want to roll
---
It's  coming out soon üòâ

Even being a small streamer and rolling on a pserver I get stream sniped. I'll be rolling on a pvp server, but I plan on being ahead of the curve a bit. I'm gonna no life the game for the first week and just hope to be a little bit higher than a majority of the players.
---
I feel like as long as I'm in the top 20-30% of people on the server the mindset will be the same, even on a PVP server. "Hit 60 as fast as possible, I'm not going to bug the opposite faction"
---
Redoubt is absolutely vital mainly because its required for Shield Specialization as well, which increases your block value.
---
So even if you don't want to get critically hit all that often, being able to stop more damage per block (which factors well with Holy Shield) is pretty essential as a tank.
---
World pvp was the best part of leveling. I was a hunter, so maybe my view is skewed, but I actively sought it as much as possible.
---
Nothing makes grinding more fun than killing a rogue and stealing his grind spot, knowing he is just waiting for a moment to get revenge
---

I feel like I saw Chromie turn back time maybe 8 months ago at the longest and I feel like release is another year away. 
---
I cant wait
---
I haven't ever been in a guild where the RL/GM is micromanaging class specs. Usually you have a mix of people who either try their best to ensure success and others who cut corners or slack in other ways. Usually the former get to have guaranteed spots and the latter is left out sometimes except they are friends with the GM.
---
Arguably moving from private to classic servers will increase the disparity between classes. With melee especially the reduced ping and accuracy of your swing timer will have a huge impact on DPS. Hunters and druids have swing time based aspects of their rotation that will benefit from lower ping and stable servers. I don‚Äôt think it will do enough to change any of the classes ranking in terms of raw damage, but I do expect the numbers will be even higher in classic.
---
This intro was epic.  I only truly appreciated it after rolling 5 or 6 toons and going back to rediscover it.
---
This sub is largely about discussing how excited we all are to play Classic, and your post basically just says all the reasons that you'll wait, and doesn't pose a question to discuss.
---
Pft only noobs don't mount over to unsuspecting alliance 10 levels lower than themselves for an instant kill.
---
And no gnomes
---
So even if you don't want to get critically hit all that often, being able to stop more damage per block (which factors well with Holy Shield) is pretty essential as a tank. And if you do happen to get crit on occasion, more Block chance never hurts!
---
TL;DR: if you want to either tank, off-tank, or PvP, I'd go with the shield talents. If you're planning on staying 30-40 yard away all the time and spam heals, then Improved Devotion Aura has a small, but always present effect.
---
Druid shapeshifting doesn't cost mana. Natural Shapeshifter talent removes GCD on shapeshift instead of reducing cost.
---
They dont compete for gear because there is only like a handful of pieces worth getting before AQ lol.
---
What the ferals on private servers dont tell you is you will be raiding in blues until AQ or R14, especially as OT. On a pserver this isnt that long, on classic this could be up to 2 years away. I did it on retail Vanilla and I dont think I can take loads of raiding for very little reward again.
---
And I will be promptly not rolling on that server to avoid the flood of streamer fan bois
---
You can fly to silithus
---
During the pre TBC patch. Not in 1.12.
---
It doesn't matter if you're ahead of everybody else on pvp server. You're still gonna get ganked, even if it's by a group of people 5 levels lower than you. Accept that you'll be ganked, and you'll be fine.
---
Very excited. Of course I wish I could no life the game, but realistically I need to keep my job. Originally I planned on taking a few weeks for the release and go hard but now I‚Äôm thinking I would rather just play it a few hours after work each day. It will be great even though I can only play a few hours a day, get on for a bit and get closer to completing a zone, pick a couple herbs, do a few quests, kill a couple alliance scumbags, you know.
---
I think a lot of people overestimate the amount of time it takes to be a classic raider. I plan on finding/starting a guild who only raids a 2-3 days a week for a couple hours. Sure we won‚Äôt be close to the top guilds, but still will eventually be able to clear all the content. P.S. world buffs + the million consumables are helpful but most definitely not mandatory for a majority of the content.
---
Respect for Payo for making this video.
---
Oh man, I forgot about that. How hard is it to loot your damn corehounds, people?
---
There's no reason, it doesn't make sense to not have an independent classic WoW dev team that wouldn't be working on current retail.
---
You will earn 90% of your mount money post level 32.
---
Prior to that mobs drop mere copper and the trash loot they drop is worth very very little. I usually have about 10g when I hit 32. So don't stress too much about money prior to this. 
---
Sometime between 32-40 you should take a few hours to foIrgo quests and just grind mobs. You should be able to average 5-7g an hour doing this from vendoring the trash they drop. 
---
I've never before had 90g when hitting 40 but I'm usually at around 70g+. I just continue grinding high value mobs and usually hit the 90 mark around 41-42.
---
The guy that designed all the classes back then wanted to put crusader strike in, but he thought it is too good and it doesnt fit the Seal playstyle :c
---
I can't imagine playing vanilla without feeling that the opposing faction is the penultimate enemy of the game. Ragnoros, Nef, and KT are just minor characters that drop gear you can use to kill the real baddies
---
Win-feral
---
You forgot to mark several things that come to my mind:
---
\- blizzcon where "You think you do, but you don't" was born
---
\- Nostalrius launch
---
\- Nostalrius shutdown
---
The HC min/max guilds already got most of their roster, professions, levling routes, builds and itemizations all figured out.  They usually don't take any more applicants until after first clear or month after. They work as a guild and help eachother reach server first within this. THIS means sharing time, gold towards this.
---
So, if your not in one now, wait til 60 to apply most likely
---
I figure the first week I‚Äôll be hopping in right away to get my characters and their names created. I am expecting it will be chaos though, so I‚Äôll be happy just to get that set up. If I‚Äôm able to connect and join, I will likely tinker on alts, maybe get the mage, who will be a tailor, up a bit so I can make my own bags. Maybe the hunter, who will level secondary profs, so he can make some food to send to my main (warrior, with an eventual end game of tank) for when I do start working on his leveling.
---
I‚Äôll take a week off, but it will likely be a month or two after launch.
---
i got the rep as a human in real vanilla, through the runecloth, but there are a lot of people claiming it to be possible, i'll link you a video by StaysafeTV

---
check it out, let me know what you think
---
this.
---
What evidence do you have for that? I'm sure that's the case for some, but there are plenty of intelligent GMs that are well aware of this possibility but want to build the structure of a guild ahead of time, they just have to allow tolerances for people getting disinterested and quitting. Worst case scenario is you have to recruit during release when someone quits or turns out to be disinterested, which is what must be your alternative to recruiting this early anyway.
---
Vanilla WoW fans: I can't wait for the authentic Vanilla experience where your hand isn't held
---
Also Vanilla fans: IDK if I can handle it if Questie isn't in Classic on launch so I can just mindlessly stare at my minimap instead of figuring it out myself
---
Have fun swimming when I throw you off this boat
---
Your raiding experience (if you're planning on doing that) will not be the same as it could have been in 2005 anyways. 
---
You will be hinted on optimal gearing, consumables, tactics and addons in one or another way. This information simply did not exist back in a day in the way it exists now.
---
NE priest because I think overall they have the best looking sets. From the dungeon sets up through T3, I like the look of them all on a female NE. Every other alliance class/race combo I would consider has at least one set I don't like. Also as others stated, most activities could use a strong holy priest. High demand. 
---
The downside is the demand for their cloth heal loot is high. Usually lots of priests in a raid and higher armor classes that can use their loot. I'm pretty sure I'm going priest anyway, but warlock would likely be my fallback. Main'd one in vanilla.
---
RMP
---
Except retail wow isn't better wow content. Retail wow is a boring progression treadmill that try to caters to the ultra casual with very easy content like world quests and normal mode. At the same time they try to cater to the ultra hard core with the hardest fights of most raid tiers too hard for the average raid group to complete while it's relevant content.
---
once 30 hits you'll be rolling through

Roughly a fifth of the time if they're wearing cloth and no defensive spells and the rest of the time chase em around with frost shock*

You are such a badass
---
If I click on the class icon on the top of the column there is no link embedded for me I think.
---
Yeah it's totally plausible that they're waiting to post their earnings before releasing the actual date. If they've had a bad quarter it would help maintain their share price. Much to the annoyance of everyone here chompin' at the bit for more details
---
The basic back bone of your class hasn‚Äôt changed in 15 years so they must have did something right the first time. 
---
Oh and the bubble hearth is fun!
---
The fear of dead servers is completely warranted. This is not the vanilla release in 2004. There will probably be huge amounts of tourists who will check out the game for a little while, then stop playing. And why the hell would people being afraid of dead servers be at a disadvantage? That makes absolutely no sense.

Hi, /u/Dissember
---
I cant wait another day damnit
---
i did pull up the numbers out of my ass ofc, since i dont play retail.
---
then i give the guy 120k Gold for his 500g in classic so no problem here.
---
And i can get the Gold in retail easly by selling tokens, will it be more expensive then china farmers ? Yes
---
But it will be more save until blizzard said "you cant do that".
---
See this is an interesting opinion, and it typically does not bode well for games lifespan. Take any new game or pserver one bug they didn't expect or test that hinders play or give an unfair advantage and population crumbles.
---
I think the first to 70 was also a French guy. He did it in 26 hours if I remember.

both are healing at 60 in PVE.

Priest: Replace lightwell with Holyform. A form similar to shadow form that gives the priest +15% healing and +15% holy damage at the cost of not being able to cast shadow spells. The priest class would be able to ascend to the smite priests we were all meant to become.
---
the little payo ofc
---
Mobile classic like they did mobile OSRS would be sick though
---
Honestly I don't remember using any mods in vanilla. Maybe TBC for raiding. 
---
I just want a bag addon and I'll be good. I still heal raids with the vanilla raid windows.
---
lady orcs are best
---
Honestly, I think it would be fine for the majority. Yeah, lots of these people are returning, but most people are going to be really out of the loop on the vanilla meta. Not everyone plays on private servers and most people who played back in the day weren't nearly as good at the game as people are now. Obviously there will be a ruling class of vanilla gods, but the majority of people will likely still fall for stuff like that, especially with the influx of newly converted vanilla fans that this game is sure to bring.
---
His face on the loot with the Classic one, PRICELESS!
---
Only it did not exist when vanilla was released In 2004. Or rather, there was no sense of fear because players were not so burned out that they were hesitant to roll on a server for fear of it not being populated because they knew they would not then want to reroll on a new server and start over again. Because they just did not have another leveling experience in them.
---
I'm saying people who are afraid of dead servers, in a private server Community sense, they are used to server hopping looking to find the fun in a higher population while oftentimes discounting the corny value of making friends and doing social crap and contributing to a community.
---
Because calling a server dead is not about a specific population number. It's about a feeling. It's about a player feeling like the server is dead, sometimes because there are not an arbitrary number of faceless people who they don't know running past them and making them feel like the world is full. Some players expect to join a server and fall ass backwards into a perfect Community, with a spot already carved out for them that they fit into neatly and they don't have to put in any effort at all.
---
These players are asking for disappointment. And this disappointment is born from the private server Community mentality. Maybe you find some fun, but it's just as important that you want to make that fun and contribute to the community and not be staring at the population number of other servers and wondering if you might have more fun there, instead of just re-rolling there and seeing what it's like.
---
See that kind of stuff all the time in the private server Community, see those same familiar faces popping up and asking for when the next fresh server is because their server is dead. They're going to have a bad time if they bring that attitude into blizzard classic, because blizzard classic is not a traditional private server. It's guaranteed to stick around.
---
Not true. They announced it would come out during summer. If they now announce that is is coming out in November that would be a delay.
---
Did that once.
---
They ate my liver.
---
i thought my hype would wane but im still pretty excited for it. but if i have to wait any longer (ie, a late summer release) i may start to lose my patience lol.
---
some data is not always better than no data. How is it not misleading if it gives the wrong impression?
---
But they did not announce that. Summer is not over, summer has not even begun, so there has been no delay yet.
---
And my Mara death run PTSD has now returned.

Flying forces them to design zones that are viewable from all angles. I think they can make better looking zones if they're not restricted by that and just needs to make zone that look good from the ground and from flight paths. Plus the usual argument that it kills world PvP and the sense of world scale. I think even the current wow devs team think adding flying to the game was a mistake. They can't remote it permanently from new expansions because the vocal minority that complains will not allow it, but obviously it should never be added to classic.
---
close, it's 3 pieces of a map (lower, center, upper iirc) that drop from the pirates. the drop rates were low enough that you would rarely get all 3 pieces before you finished the quests in there, so unless you needed to grind or farm cloth most people just moved on.
---
I have a few people that I know IRL that plan on power leveling. We will level cap recruit the current 60s/high 50s we can while grinding out dungeons. Goal is to clear MC/ONY within the first two weeks. We are starting with 2 tanks, 2 dps and 3 healers, the only reason I can take that to the bank is I know them personally. I have zero faith in people online to level up quickly and commit to grinding as much as possible in the first few weeks.
---
Luckily that is not an issue we will have to face until cataclysm.
---
IIRC they are very fun to play and have a LOT of possibilities but have a very boring raid rotation. But maybe some who actually raided as a warlock can tell you more since I only played Priest and Hunter.
---
I will be a healer this time again, when I had enough of my Hunter and started healing I couldnt go back. Personally I got so much more joy of keeping everybody alive then only spamming some dmg ability.
---
Interesting that you say that. I've seen it as both. I think it depends on your graphics settings.
---
Blizzard broke mob tagging after the level 80 leveling race Athens won. Mob tagging as we know it will not work on live, and will almost guaranteed not work on classic. Athene got banned for the blatant public use of it to get the first level 80.
---
But there's also the fact that we are saying this now, before we have had the five or so years experience of playing on this new blizzard project, from classic to burning crusade to wrath, and in that time not being able to fly around in traditional Azeroth. True, after that time, plenty of us will still think we should keep classic Azeroth without flying, but others of us will in that five years have regrown our desire to see flying in classic Azeroth and it will seem like a new and exciting thing because we haven't seen it in 5 years. In that project anyway, who knows where current battle for Azeroth Warcraft will be at that point.
---
Huh? I was responding the fact that you said ‚Äúlaunch delays can only happen with a release date‚Äù. I said IF they announced that it was now coming out in the winter that would be a delay regardless of the fact that they haven‚Äôt given us a specific release date, since they had previously announced summer.
---
Yeah that's true. But what you wanted sounded more like tbc and resilience but with the extension into the pve area. At least that's how I understood it.
---
I would welcome a tier after naxx and your ideas have since values, but I'd rather stick to the original, coz where would be the end of this? When should they change something or not?
---
They would get so much hate for even the slightest change.
---
Alliance PvP
---
...or anyone with a verified vanilla character
---
0/30/21 is a raid spec that you can pvp in it is just far from optimal. It is totally fine in AB/AV, and pretty weak in WSG.
---
I dont even understand how anybody could be against it. 
---
Dont like it? Fine! Why do People feel the need to tell other players what they want to play. If you like retail just play retail. Why would you go out of your way to comment in some forum why classic is bad.
---
Even IF its just nostalgia who cares? I played on private servers and classic is EXACTLY what I love. Do I only like it because I played it in my teenage years? I absolutly dont think so. But even IF that would be the reason I am still having the most fun in a game I ever had.
---
The reason why I like it doesnt matter at all since I like it. I dont get this argument at all.

---
IIRC it's  (Level\*4)+2 =ap given according to some random classic wiki(yeah, I know). So 242 melee ap.
---
So, uhm, I don't get it. 
---
My point was to use an experience I had on a private server to discuss about one of the usual topics. It wasn't in any way correlated to the server itself.
---
So I have only one question: was the topic too conflictual?
---
Well my announcement came via carrier pigeon. The scroll attached had bird shit all over it. The release date was smudged but I think it said September 6, 2019.
---
yes
---
You found a nightblade. Neat!
---
New shadowbolt record, LEET!

cool
---
&gt;Then says exactly what I had said, about making Vanilla historically  accurate. You can't make it accurate, the player base has advanced  Vanilla far beyond what it was. Merchanics, mob density, exp, proc rates  can all be replicated. The gameplay however, won't be because people  play the game differently. 
---
That has no bearing on the goal of the project, whether or not people will interact with the game differently is beside the point. You're implying the tenets of the project should change because they can't make an exact 1-1 when the whole point is only to provide the game as it was back then. Ion Literally stated, historical recreation, as it was. 
---
&gt; There is a toggle, if you want to see yourself, your trees, your water  in the way it was in 2004. Then click the toggle off. If you want to see  WoW in a graphically appealing state  (appealing is subjective before  you jump down my throat) with enhanced graphics. Click the toggle on.  Instead you want to remove the possibility of players options on  something that affects no one other than the person playing their game. 
---
Apart from the person who no longer has control over how their avatar is seen, because the models.. are entirely different. I hope I don't need to regurgitate what I initially wrote.
---
&gt;If your argument is YOU want to look like an old model in the world and  someone changing their graphics means they'll see you as a new model.  Why do you have any more right to say what THEY want you to look like  graphical than you? 
---
This is the crux of the argument. The exact same can be said of 'you'.  You are forcing a toggle on people that favours your outlook. Ignoring the posts about it won't change that. You don't seem to understand why no changes is a compromise. I could sit here talk about how this is vanilla and it doesn't match up with the goals of historical recreation as it was, which you'll just try to ignore like you already have, despite Ion's Blizzard presentation making that exact point. I've already explained this point. I'll relink so we're on the same page.
---
&gt; It's 'just optional' doesn't cut it when players no longer have control over how their avatar is percieved in a *MMORPG*.  Having a character not look as their player intends does in fact alter  the dynamics of a social game. People make comments on how my character  looks in game all the time regardless of what I play and vice-versa. The  fact that so many people don‚Äôt understand that it's fundamentally  important in a game that revolves around developing your character and  socializing to achieve your goals, only to say *‚Äúwell you‚Äôre ruining the way I want to play the game‚Äù* as though you‚Äôre entitled to something extraneous to vanilla and it doesn‚Äôt matter is genuinely laughable. 
---
Your argument ultimately boils down to "Why should you have any right to control how your avatar looks" as if that isn't one of the major points of playing an MMORPG.
---
&gt; In terms of the Nazi comment, I can only assume your trolling because an  expression, a saying or a metaphor does not make a person a Jew killing  mass murderer. If my grammar is terrible and someone constantly  corrects me, being a Grammar Nazi, telling me that I should do things  this way and that way. That doesn't mean I'm rounding up a religious  population for extermination, it means I don't know proper punctuation.  Hilter imposed his beliefs and the way HE believed the world should be  and oppressed the views, beliefs of others in the process. I think it is  a pretty good metaphor for the way some people talk to people about  Classic. 
---
Disagreeing with you does not make people dictators that murdered millions of people.
---
&gt; "No you can't do this, have this, implement this" because it "Does not  conform to MY personal requirements, wants or needs" for this game the  community fought hard to get...

Perhaps you should accept that are people who have different beliefs to you instead comparing them to the national socialist party?

I'll be playing on NA. I'm on West coast time and am usually available after 7:30pm to play for a few hours each day. I'm on a changing work schedule so my days off change most weeks. I don't have a preference on pvp or pve server. I definitely lean towards pve content but back in tbc/wotlk I did a fair amount of pvp too. I'm mostly just looking for a group of people to play with. I'm by no means hardcore and won't pretend I have enough time to do that. I am level headed so you'll never find me raging and generally hold my own in any video game I play. I'll most likely be playing either mage or warlock. You can just message me on here and we'll go from there!
---
Oh hell yeah, somehow I misread your post last night. I was drinking and it was late, forgive me, lol.
---
How did you like priest? Priest is the only class that I've never actually played throughout any iteration of WoW and am thinking of rolling priest for classic to mainly heal. I also never really played classic during retail as I was only like 10 years old and made it to level 20 or something, so how viable is playing both Holy (PvE) and Shadow (PvP). Or do you mostly have to just stick to one or the other.

Amazing how much a plummeting Sub base can do to change an exec's stance on a "Lol its not ganna happen" to "Wait, no don't leave, here is what you wanted!"

World of warcraft OST makes me think about WoW sometimes
---
But seasons would turn the game into the progression treadmill current wow is. One of the things I liked about classic wow is that a player could start at any point and play casually and the progress they made wasn't constantly invalidated by the catch up mechanics. You could still find some guilds starting progression on MC in early 2006. In retail wow if I stop playing for a few months I'm likely to find I can upgrade all my gear with world quests gear because they raised the ilvl of those rewards. I'd argue that the catch up mechanics from classic wow were more casual friendly as they didn't invalidate previous progress.
---
Yes, it would be hard to add content without making old content irrelevant. But it's something they were able to do for a while and if they at least tried that would be a refreshing change compared to retail wow where every new system of a new expansion is designed to be scrapped at the end of it.

this sounds genius, but wouldn't the low lvl die instantly when 100+ mobs jump him after he does the aoe ability?
---
Yeah it was an absolute pain to gather pug groups for Ubrs. I really wanted the T0 chest piece of endboss and gathering 15 people to do so was reallllly hard. And then somebody had to have the key. And ubrs is not an easy instance for us unexperienced players so even if you got everything that by no means guaranteed to even see a drop. 
---
And it had a fairly low drop chance. I did about 50 runs and never got it. Saw it maybe 1 or 2 times only but cant remember really but I never got it.
---
Thats the biggest problem with pug groups. Even if you find decent people you do it once, lose the roll and have to do it again. But since its not the same people next run you can lose the roll again and over and over again.
---
With the same people you lose a contested piece only once maximum twice before this people have it so you now have no competion anymore. With pugs its competition every time and the rng can really be frustrating.

---
I'm so ready for the overhypers to completely flip and start cursing Blizzard and vowing to never play it. It's what happens in every game sub during the final months of pre-release.
---
By that logic, Blizzard's track record with "polished games" is pretty much bottom of the barrel.  Diablo 3 was literally unplayable for weeks, BFA had horrific server stability issues, Overwatch too suffered from a lot of game bugs initially and server stability, Star Craft 2 was "OK" but that was back in 2009!

The only game I can think of that had a somewhat good "release" was Hearthstone, but that's just a turn based card game.

Other healers can use consumables, too. Why should you have to play a full Resto build that's garbage everywhere outside of raids just so they don't have to drink potions? And Priests should be getting Innervate if they need mana.

Not really true. My favorite enemy during classic while leveling a feral druid was pallies. Wait to burst until they are at around 30% so they don't get the chance to bubble hearth and you're golden. Stv was an amazing experience for this simple fact alone when you aren't getting ganked by rogues.
---
That can be a challenge yes. 
---
A few options:
---
A) The lowlvl uses engineering grenades. If they hit, they stun, so the 60 has a bit of time to do damage to reaggro.
---
B) Use a warrior who can use demoralizing shout to get threat without doing damage
---
C) If you are boosting a mage the mage can just open aggro with blizzard or smth and stay safe.
---
I would have to be summoning a demon while already having one and be interrupted right? Which doesnt really happen often, unless I'm not getting what you mean or i suck
---
If rogues could dual wield 2 handed weapons
---
Yeeeeeha, oh baby
---
A fucking shitty int cape lol
---
Might change warrior dps at lower gear level. But with the best gear and world buff fury should be rage capped even with less rage.
---
pve...
---
Hand of Rag and windseeker lol
---
K.
---
Seriously, why the fuck does everyone care so much about not having bags? They drop throughout the entirety of the game
---
Not really, Vanilla WoW, when it first came out, already catered to a more casual crowd if you compare it to EQ. One example I can think of is the punishment when you died in game. In EQ you lost XP and you‚Äôd have to corpse run, whilst in WoW, dying was punishing enough for you to avoid it at all cost due to long runs, but you didn‚Äôt loose XP or items. 
---
I think there‚Äôs a fine line and Vanilla was perfect in that sense, it wasn‚Äôt too casual not too hardcore.
---
While UBRS presence does decrease, there were always some groups doing it. Even after AQ event, you could find at least one UBRS group every night on my server. I did it all the time and only started playing on 1.8
---
Blizzards usual time-frame from announcement to acutal release lays in about 60 days. The big 8.2 patch on retail is coming late june/early july and i'm pretty sure they will that play out for a little while before releasing classic. Which means early to late august most likely. Given the 60 days from anouncement to release it still gives them fairly good time to wait with the anouncement. Which makes sense because they'd want to be 100% sure they could uphold that promise.
---
The Druid can logoff, leaving you pet-less.
---
Lmao just search Soil's *Halo*. Everyone and their mother used that song for their pvp montages. 
---
Ugh.
---
I remember when pvp had no diminishing returns or cc caps. You could fear a rogue that had sprint on half way across the map lol
---
I enjoy playing 33/18/0 priest. Works very well in both PvE and PvP. Mages and locks will love your PI during raids and even pay you for it!
---
They have some estimation. Now if they multiply the estimated value by 1.5 for example, it's 99.9% guaranteed to be above the original value.
---
You forgot to put dinosaurs extinct
---
Could I let a hunter tame me and the  stay logged on and let him level my char up while he levels?
---
You should consider using something like canvas(unsure of any python alternatives, I code discord bots using nodeJS) to format it better than just an embed.   
---
You could fully replicate an items tooltip as an attached image to send to the chat, could make it visually a lot more attractive
---
There's stuff we try not to comprehend. The size of the universe, where it ends, if it ends, the release date of classic, and what comes after Naxx.
---
We may never know.
---
Flying, lfg were the two big ones....
---
People can agree and say why they'll wait.  Or tell me I'm an idiot.  Or pick my reasons apart.
---
There's plenty to discuss.  Do I have to say "will there be bags?  Should I wait for bags?"  Or can I let the question be implied.  At the very least, I thought this subreddit was capable of making those inferences.
---
You put a bot on your server by inviting it.
---
Oh, good point!  I forgot about getting my names.
---
Mage. I'm like the federal reserve. Oh I need money? Just print that shit, fuck the economy.
---
maybe in December :c
---
meetings stones were the original dungeon queue system in Vanilla. You'd click the stone and it'd add you to a queue for that dungeon. (Later the ability to queue via inn-keepers was added, though it still queued you up via the stone, it just allowed you to do so remotely).
---
Private servers can fix the loot thing, but they do have to re-add the shaman/paladin exclusion manually.
---
Mage looking for raiding guild.
---
Region: EU
---
Server type: No preference
---
Faction: No preference
---
Raid times: Looking to raid 2 days a week. Available 21:00 - 00:00 Tuesday to Saturday; 19:00 - 00:00 on Monday/Sunday
---
Did not play vanilla, raided HC in WoD and first tier of BFA. Aiming to clear all raid content in vanilla. Plan on taking a couple weeks off of work to push to 60 and start working on pre-raid BiS. Looking for a fun and committed guild who aims to clear all raid content at a reasonable pace. Would also like to be in a guild who does a stuff outside of raid nights too wether that be dungeons, helping guildies, WPvP or any other kind of guild events.
---
Drop me a message if you think your guild would be a good fit.
---
Don't be sensitive lul, NA edgelords?
---
Ashenval and every tavern music
---
True, it would basically be TBC/WotLK resilience except it would affect all ratings and not just Crit. The intent of the original resilience was to prolong PvP fights beyond anything that ever happened in classic because they needed arena fights to last longer for eSports. And they also wanted to make PvE gear irrelevant in PvP. I disagree with both of those design goals. The intent of the new stat would be to keep tank mitigation at about the same as MC/BWL gear while also making it so people aren't one shotting each other in PvP. Basically the relative offense/defense at ilvl 60 should be about the same as ilvl 90.
---
Bet they wish they did that looking back
---
So they have a in house alpha currently. Probably leading to a 2 week beta. Perhaps an open weekend. I see no reason why july 16th isn't still on the table.   
---
The in house alpha would be I assume to test that everything is generally working right. Then the beta is to let all the fans comb through the quests and ensure they're all working and mobs are pathing etc. Those sorts of issues don't usually take that long to fix. I don't think were far off of the end now.
---
Your idea will still have paladins sucking, so not really a good one.
---
This game is so unique in its development, that I believe its naive to assume we guaranteed a beta. They could just alpha F&amp;F then move to release, still in July
---
I've accepted that this is just suffering I'll look back on at the end of my life and reflect on how worth it it was.
---
Yes. They said summer but december is summer in the southern hemisphere.
---
I believe foot movement speed does not stack upon each other like what you're suggesting.
---
However, a mount movement speed buff does sort of scale upon itself. A 8% movement speed buff on a regular mount will instead make you move at 172.8% movement, or 216% on an epic mount ((100% base movement + Mount Speed) x Highest Talent or Trinket bonus = "Fasts/sec").
---
Isn't that mostly a pvp spec? Or do you find being able to heal in tough situations helps a lot?
---
Luckily dual wield isn't a spec.
---
It‚Äôs a little subjective because it all depends on your gear and level relative to the dungeon. For example I remember tanking the trash in SM with a Whirlwind Axe because it‚Äôs so powerful for its level and the trash doesn‚Äôt hit very hard. For bosses though a shield is highly recommended unless you want to expose your party to unnecessary risk.
---
Classic Wow Etiquette:
---
See that guy clearing that group of mobs? Might as well sneak on in there and loot the chest while he's fighting. He probably doesn't mind.
---
I could get behind hope for an unconventional release schedule.
---
Dang didn't know it died already. RIP classic wow 2019-2017 :(
---
What are you using to burst? Ferocious Bite? You don't get that until level 32. Paladins get plate at level 40, which significantly lowers your burst damage, so that's 8 levels out of ~40 (let's say there's no world PvP before level 20) where you're actually able to burst them down.
---
Druids and Rogues are always going to be the alphas in world PvP because of stealth. But in a fair fight, before level 60, Paladins match up very well with both of them.
---
This was mostly pre 40 because north stv is mid 30s.
---
Thanks for the reply. Could you rephrase it please? My non-native English is having a hard time with the multiple 'not' s, ha
---
ü¶Ä Blizzard is powerless to Activision overlords ü¶Ä
---
reckoning has unlimited stacks. 
---
:)
---
Everyone here worried about debuff limits and your in Vanilla MC with 6 Curse of Dooms on one target lol.
---
Ill bet no matter what it wont be july 16 just because thats what everyone is thinking. Maybe july 17 for spite?
---
1.  Private servers inflate bag drop chance.
---
2.  Because until they drop, you don't have them.  And a handful of 6-slot bags is barely enough.
---
3.  Because some classes have to dedicate entire bags to a mechanic, such as arrows or soul shards.
---
4.  Because some quests have you store several items for the quest, like quests to have you grab 60 of something (that stacks to 10 or 20), or quests to collect heads from a group of specific named mobs (and each head is a bag space).

I really hope they put one of the loading screen tips as ‚ÄúYou think you do, but you don‚Äôt‚Äù

Shadow priest is maybe the strongest dueling PvP class in the game. Only warlocks will become a competitive to you and only when they have a lot of gear. Other than that you can beat every other class in a duel setting. Sure hunters can be a pain if they kite but you can use terrain to negate that. In group PvP shadow priests are also decent but as soon as you enter organized group PvP they suck. Your dots can be dispelled and your biggest problem is mana. You will have A LOT of mana issues and you run oom super quick. Also gear is hard to get since the priests sets are only to heal. The pvp set is very good but only with serious time investment to acquire. Also shadow priests are bad in raids. Not completely useless it may be possible to find a guild that takes you if you really want to play one but here Again mana will restrict you. And even if you invest time to acquire consumables your DPS will always only be ok never good. But it's not impossible to play one.
---
Healing as a priest is very fun. They are the most versatile healing class and just a super solid choice. Paladins can heal better PvP but as a holy priest you can heal both raids and PvP very good. They are also very interesting because they just have so man possibilities. You have a hot, group healing, various single target heals a strong shield fear basically everything a healer needs. Also the benediction/anathema weapon is not that hard to acquire and one of the most iconic weapons in the game ever. You will have no problems finding a group.
---
Leveling a priest is also super nice besides some people telling otherwise dont listen to them. It can be a little bit boring since you use your wand a lot but you have reasonable speed and will almost never did. Also you are very strong in PvP while leveling. As a shadow you can really melt faces an as holy you will slowly kill your opponent's but they just can't kill you through your abilitie to heal.
---
Beeing both is a bit tricky in classic since the respec costs are very high and you will super slowly acquire suitable shadow gear pieces because you will most likely be a healer.
---
But that said I love PvP and only rolled one to melt faces as shadow, however healing became very soon the best feeling in the game for me. Keeping your group alive is just fun. In PvP you sure will be focused but that also means that you are the guy to protect
---
Need a map mod. The way opening the map takes up the entire screen by default is so annoying. Also need them coords.
---
I'll hold off on modifying my bars, unit frames, minimap, nameplates and tooltip until good mods for those come out, but it's on the list of things to do.
---
Snowfall keypress for that elite millisecond gain on response time. 
---
Lazipig was a mandatory mod for me. Auto repairs at vendor, hold shift to sell greys, auto ignore gold spam, auto dismount.
---
Theorycraft. Super useful to see what the damage/mana and dps of all of your abilities at each rank is.
---
Mailmod since you can only send 1 item in the mail per letter. Opening several pages of auction results is obnoxious without one.
---
Decursive or something similar. Even if I don't main a class with dispells it's good practice just to have this installed.  
---
Informant. In vanilla the vendor price for items isn't shown when you mouse over an item, I need to know what items to throw away and which ones to keep to optimize bag space. 
---
Nice damage font.
---
Prat. The default chat window/system lacks a lot of functionality. Prat colors names by class, adds timestamps and lets you copy/paste links.
---
Swingtimer/Autoshot timer. 
---
If it's popular enough I may use a mod like vQueue that helps with group finding.
---
Time flies..
---
That's basically the spell batching argument
---
If he's min maxing he shouldn't be going combat daggers.
---
If they dont ill mod it in myself.
---
So you‚Äôre basically complaining about a difficult part of the game?
---
Do things change at 40 with shadow form?
---
For me it's trance, not only because I used to listen to it a lot but also because literally every boss kill video on WCM had it.
---
Every so often: Blessing of Protection while the Mage just casually nukes the planet for 10 seconds is always a riot.
---
It's all in your skill level and play style.
---
I have been told that the sit thing doesn't work on classic.
---
A rogue from PVE server gang, now I've seen it all
---
\*\*\*THIS\*\*\* is the correct TIMELINE!
---
Interested, going to go to discord when home
---
effort = number of clicks?
---
but number of clicks is also measurable in time
---
therefore difficulty = effort = time
---
except when more than one person is involved, like a dungeon or a raid
---
yeah, it can't be simplified, lol
---
brb, gf is texting me, can't play and txt at same time.
---
Shoulda cooked that taco
---
The first update to the Classic Release should be entitled... "So you did, and we did."
---
The reason people don‚Äôt want to hear this kind of post is because we are all sitting here waiting eagerly for a blue post. It gets really frustrating when all we see is posted on what happens after the last raid comes out, what class should I be, and generally nonsensical post like this that are just people talking out loud with no real substance or anything to contribute.
---
Ret paladins in pvp aren't terrible. They can 1v1 really well. One of their downfalls is their lack of range. It seemed like a nice buff that wasnt just flat out ridiculous to make them op. What would be a better change to make paladins op?
---
The only thing I would say is fiscal Q3 starts July 1. 
---
It's not likely to start so soon. I think they would have announced by now. I personally think they'll start closer to Q4 start (October 1) in order to make the next retail update look better on paper. That would mean September? August is still possible.
---
Wrath was actually the first time I wanted to play Classic. There were a lot of good things about it, but homogenization was big by then and like in BC, leveling was a linear chore and we had flying. Just depends on what‚Äôs most important to you.
---
So then tourists are...people from BFA retail who come to Classic, play a few levels and show an inflated server population, then leave and suddenly the server population is much lower?
---
But the same can be said for those brave souls who start playing on one server, then decide to reroll on another server because of any reason (but population is probably the biggest reason).
---
They're *all* tourists. Or we could just choose to call *none* of them tourists; it's an antagonistic label.
---
Of course it's _Disturbed_ playing, haha. It feels like they're one of the themesong capitals of Vanilla (mebbe tbc too).
---
Now add the Nostalrius snd letter from blizzard and the server closing that made the millions signature petition delivered by mark kern and nost team
---
I wouldn't hate being able to get some level grinding done for a bit when I'm away from home. Would have come in handy this past weekend, actually.
---
Ive never played a private server and i fear being on a dead server quite a bit, or on a server that is dominated by the other faction (and ill be playing on a PvE server).
---
I still play retail, and it feels AWFUL to be on lower pop servers.  Even with cross realm raiding, etc...its just miserable to be on a server with very few raid guilds, nothing happening in trade chat, etc.
---
My server isnt even 'dead' (many are worse off), but its definitely in the low to mid pop area and its just sad to see so few people around, especially in the off times.
---
I think its also a perfectly valid worry with Classic, especially since were very, very, very likely to see a lot of tourists.  Remember that Classic has several things going for (in some ways against) it vs original retail.
---
Any retail player can play it without having to do anything extra (other than downloading a client).  We dont know what sub numbers are exactly, and while its down...theres still a *lot* of people playing.  Even if only 10% of them try it out, thats a shitload of people flooding in.  If blizzard makes enough servers to accommodate even a part of that flood of players, and then they dont stick around for more than 2 months, there will absolutely be dead realms.
---
Even people that arent currently playing are only going to have to pay for a sub, and 15 bucks isnt jack shit for most adults.  Theres no game to buy to be a money sink (which helps keep you around because why the hell wouldnt you keep playing a game you spent 50 bucks on).
---
Add in the fact that even though WoW was designed to run on lower end PCs originally, its much easier to get a PC that will run it 'decently' these days, and most people with a computer wont have any issues running the game.  
---
There is no barrier to entry this time.  A sub fee is it, and thats nothing.  There are absolutely going to be a lot of tourists, and while we dont know how many will stay, its very likely that most wont, at least beyond a few months.  Being stuck on a realm that had lots of those is absolutely going to suck.
---
Level easy and whoop ass in PvP as Shadow, then get invited to EVERYTHING as Holy just to heal a tank. I love it.
---
You spelled ‚ÄúSo you did so we had to‚Äù wrong.
---
They now talk with full passion because of the backlasb they got when they tried to get the idea out of our head. :D
---
When you see a double negative in English you can remove the negatives and the sentence is the same. Double negatives are grammatically confusing so don't feel bad. 
---
He's saying it makes sense to have a classic wow team that doesn't touch retail.
---
They were popular in 2006 I guess!
---
In addition to this i'd like to see it as a Red Cog.
---
A lot of songs from the first and second guitar hero since they were out around the same time and I played both. Carry on my wayward son is one I definitely remember.
---
So?
---
Its not about making hybrids more viable so much as it is letting existing abilities be used in raid combat.
---
Rogues cant even think of hemo, hunters cant use baseline abilities like serpent sting. An afflock putting up a full dot table? 
---
The current system rewards a mechanically simple class like a frost/fire mage because they dont fuck with the debuffs. Whether you have 1 frost mage or 8, they only want Winters Chill and COE, if fire mages they only need 1 ignite, 1 scorch 1 coe. Every lock who is SM/Ruin--at the very least--would prefer to be able to apply corruption. If 8 locks thats 8 corruptions, 1 coe, 1 cos, wrecklessness, doom, agony x4. 
---
Beyond all that, hybrids are plenty viable now. MC/Ony/BWL/ZG/AQ20 can all be done with Hybrids dpsing in your raid--dps isnt an issue in vanilla raids, for the most part. You can do all the aforementioned raids with 1/2 your raid dead, when it was current content. (You can do MC/Ony/BWL/ZG with hybrids dpsing and no consumables except on the tanks for first 2-3 clears, then spec properly for AQ, then spec + consumables for Naxx (all assuming you are playing with mythic raider quality players in the first place))
---
I'll get bored of vanilla raids eventually--they are quite easy, to a point--the biggest challenge to vanilla raid guilds will be keeping people interested the entire time (2-3 years). Making combat more engaging by allowing people to manage more of their abilities in raid combat goes a long way to making it more fun.
---
When I watched this, I found it sad that just a few years back, all of these would have been "common sense". But now, we need tutorials on how to be a decent human being....
---
I'm going to start a raiding guild that only raids Saturday and Sunday at 7:00 AM for the people like me. I'm that excited.
---
What are you playing
---
Leveling in Mulgore - Double Trouble by The Roots and Mos Def
---
I'd be down for a break into an alternate reality and into a brand new expansion.
---
Going for a few solo world boss kills perhaps?
---
Ill never forgive ‚Äúyou think you do, but you don‚Äôt.‚Äù 
---
The fact that so much time passed between Nost and the announcement makes me think that there were some senior blizzard people still against Classic WoW, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Brack was one of them. Cognitive dissonance is a real thing, I bet his ego was resting on retail WoW being superior to Classic with all those QoL improvements.
---
If they want to keep their fans happy, most will roll on a PvP. Once they realize how terrible the constant ganking is though, I wouldn't be surprised if some would switch to PvE. The smart ones will make toons on both so they can save their names.
---
The truth is we really don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs currently in an alpha. But I mean the game is ‚Äúdone‚Äù, it‚Äôs just fixing any bugs or server related issues from porting the game to the new engine. An alpha at this point is much further along than a normal game. (Where they are still adding content, etc.).  Another thing to consider is that they only really need the first ‚Äúphase‚Äù done for a release. 
---
My guess is we will here something about the release date or Beta in May. I still think a July 16th release is possible and probable.
---
Thanks. Also, for tanking 5-mans decently, is 3/3 improved righteous fury essential?
---
Of course threat is incredibly important, but if the talent is redundant because threat isn't usually an issue, It would be better to skip, or just do 1/3 or 2/3. I doubt this is the case though.
---
&gt; ‚Äúoh SHIT and you can fly now!!!!! isn‚Äôt that cool????‚Äù
---
It was for me, but that's because I was a Druid. It WAS cool to be able to instantly jump and fly away.
---
Retail is going to get a new raid around that time, so it's extremely unlikely classic releases before september.
---
Thinking awfully recent here. The Lost Vikings, Rock 'n Roll Racing, Warcrafts 1-3, StarCraft, Diablos 1 &amp; 2; various and sundry expansions for each of the aforementioned.
---
There's a reason Blizzard's name and reputation were solid gold up through the Activation merger. No one would ever accuse them of being innovative (except perhaps with that first title), but world-class polish and quality were their stock in trade for a *long* time.
---
Legion had an amazing release. Now, that is speaking relatively. If you were a druid hated with the Cenarion Circle you couldn't even start the expansion :P
---
But yea, they never have had a perfect launch
---
I enjoyed flying mounts. I never did wpvp and I liked the ability to jump off a cliff and transform into a bird and fly around. Always felt cool.
---
Unless Classic has a concurrent player base of probably a million or more, I highly doubt theyre going to invest in making new content for it.
---
We're most likely going to see some variation of seasons implemented.
---
Make Moonfire's damage stay the same, but allow it to stack up to 10 stacks if you keep spamming it.
---
And a single hit refreshes all of the stacks.
---
That's the advantage of huge raid sizes, a few dead weight players don't impact the bottom line as harshly as they do in 25, 20, or especially 10 player raids.
---
The shaping of the world.
---
I mean, yeah, those questions can be implied, but I'm guessing you're in the minority if you don't want to just play the shit out of Classic in the first few weeks. For me, I don't really care if a lack of an AH economy keeps me from buying bags before my tailoring alt can make them. I just want to play the game.
---
Then here's what you can do. First, decide the SPECIFIC population number that warrants you calling a server 'dead'. Specific number, so that you can keep an eye on population, and if it hits that number you instantly delete all your characters and reroll on another server.
---
"Nothing happening in trade chat. Very few raid guilds." So your idea of feeling like a server is 'alive', is being surrounded by people. Not necessarily people you know, or even talk to, or even acknowledge...but just \*people\*, so you feel less alone on the server?
---
Because a higher server population means that the things you personally accomplish there are somehow more valuable because you can compare yourself to a greater population there?
---
Eh, probably not that.
---
So what's the difference between a retail player who plays to level 10, decides it isn't for them, and leaves, versus another player who plays to level 10, decides that they \*feel like\* the server is \*dead\*, and rerolls on a higher populated server?
---
Answer, there's no difference. Anyone can play where they want and for how long they want. 
---
Anyway, since we're defining minimum numbers for stuff like 'what is a dead server', let's also define the minimum level somebody has to hit in order to not be considered a tourist. Gotta be the same level for everyone.
---
And closing with the arbitrary, if a server has 100 people and you make friends with 50 of them, it can \*feel\* less dead than a 1000 player server. Ain't saying low pop servers rule all the time...but either you join a server intending to build the community, or you don't.
---
Kargoz has a guide on duo leveling that you could follow
---
I recommend that you just play classes with similar movement speeds so that no one is trailing behind for it to be the most fun
---
A good example is like priest and warrior
---
That does sounds conflicting.. Even the population still playing retail will probably want to taste something new and shiny.
---
it is

&gt;Also, I'll be a horde player.
---
Sorry but Paladins are Alliance exclusive in classic. 
---
As for AOE grinding, it is certainly viable for leveling and gold farming but I'm not certain having a healer as apposed to another AOE DPS will be more or less beneficial.
---
I have been looking into alternatives to the Embed's. For a "Quick Start" POC I thought it would pass for now. But I totally agree that having a real tooltip would be best. Thank you for your input, I will be sure to take note of it and try my best to get something like this implemented in the initial v1 release.
---
It would be so cool if there was a server announcement when the very first honorable kill was made.
---
This honestly shows just what a sorry state WoW is in now.
---
Sorry, but would you be able to elaborate what you mean by Red Cog?
---
I have a feeling its gonna be August..
---
I'm not saying the toggle doesn't force the point. However jumping down people's throats like you have done, every time the suggest something in a community led project is the whole reason WoW is so Toxic! You have the right to argue one point, other people have the right to argue there's. There are VERY few videos that talk about the graphics of WoW (other than a select few) and rather most focus on its gameplay/community aspects. Neither of which will change by someone toggling their settings to a higher graphic template. Equally, you will NEVER even know what people see your character as, because it's not like your walking around the world with signs above people's heads saying I'm seeing you in 7.2. 
---
And it's not Nazi due to being a disagreeing party. It's Nazi to which the manor people respond to points, critics and recommendations. Seeing as you clearly thing the term Nazi in a metaphorical sense means someone murders people, then there's no point arguing this point any further. Clearly it is a result of cultural differences, and you thinking writing big words in long sentences changes the basis of a metaphor or will change the context of which I used it. Then I guess it's a stalemate because I couldn't care less how you've taken it, after I've explained how it was used. Your right to disagree with it though, as I'm sure you will continue to. /Done
---
The hilarious thing about this whole argument is the fact that I personally don't plan to use New models if they are implemented. I'm just tired of people quashing ideas under a boot because it doesn't suit what they believe they should be getting. I'd rather have a community that inclusive and happy that EVEN if their requests for tokens and other cash shop madness is misplaced or destructive that they are educated, not dictated to. 
---
You can quote Ion all you want, but it was the people's voice that got us Classic. People you trying to silence opinions or ignoring them completly is how we got retail. 
---
I think we are just going around in circles here, in a fairly pointless debate that neither of us will agree on. New graphics don't affect my gameplay experiencewhat so ever but if allowing someone to make their Lightning Bolt look like a lightning bolt rather than a lightning ball makes people happy, increases the player base and the longevity of the game then all the power too them. As long as it doesn't affect how I see things on my own screen then I couldn't care less, I couldn't care less how someone sees my character. That's like complaining about colour blind mode making your armour a different shade on someone else's screen. 
---
That's my stance and I feel that there is no reason to reply here anymore.
---
Lmao love that you left out WoD
---
Arya femrogues will definitely be out there
---
I thought about it and I honestly can't recall listening to much music outside of the OST. I'm sure I had my sure of music I downloaded off of KaZaa and played on Winamp but nothing I really only listened to during Vanilla. 
---
The death run music is burned into my brain so I know I almost exclusively listened to the OST, otherwise I had a movie on in the background to drown out my loneliness.
---
Yes, it was their mark for a *long* time, but in the past decade, it absolutely has not been which is what matters for Classic.

Do you just make a habit of talking out your ass?
---
To play Runescape you just need a mouse, so it was easy to design for mobile, but I don't think the same thing would work out for wow.
---
What up Edmund. Any word on Repentance?
---
3 years seasonal resets is nowhere near the 3 months patches the game gets now. Anyway, its my opinion, and then there is your opinion. Add 10k more opinions and you get a disaster. I don't know which blizzard you are talking about when you said that they were able to do for a while (gear/content wise) but these people are long gone.  "At least tried" won't cut it, you go in and succeed or you break everything.  
---
As for resets, 3 years is more than enough for even the most casual player there is. But here lies the problem with threads like these, we ca bump heads all day and night and even if we come to an agreement, there are thousands more of us. 
---
Classic+ is a wishful thinking. It will drive some away, and attract others. If so, why bother with classic in a first place?
---
I'm saying they should have a team working on the updated wow and a different team working on classic. So a new patch to the updated game would have no effect on the people making classic, so his assumption appears baseless. 
---
I know learning another language is challenging! Keep learning (:

Loot lag wasn't a consistent feature of the game that affected PVP timings.

Anything by Drowning Pool. Immediately brings me back to being wide eyed as I watch warrior and rogue PvP videos. Fantasizing about being that badass one day.
---
Problem is, Paladins cannot lose threat. If they do, Blessing of Protection can work unless you lose aggro to a spellcaster, and even then its basically your only threat dump you can use on allies every 3-5 minutes.
---
Righteous Fury talent increases BoSanc, Holy Shield, Consecration, and most Seal/Judge spell aggro (and I think Ret Aura as well). Increasing that effect can really be helpful in any scenario honestly.
---
He's saying, you're posting negatively about something we are all hyped about.

The majority of people on this sub are spamming refresh, in hope of another blue post.

Some encounters are definitely overtuned. Lmao, Uruk Doomhowl in LBRS is meant to be for fucking AQ geared players on pservers.

I'm hoping to all the powers that be that August is the date. I don't get back from deployment till literally the 16th of July and it would break me not being their on release night!
---
Thanks for the very detailed answer, I know primarily I want to PvE and be a healer, I was just watching videos of shadow priests in world PvP and it looked so fun so I wanted to do both, but aside from the cost of respeccing I wasn't really sure how viable they were without spending months farming an entirely different gear set, I forgot about the gear from pvp which could be useful if I can manage to make that time commitment.
---
Yes, the mount speed increase bonus' do in fact stack.  The base run speed movement modifier (Identified as passive aura #31) will not stack unless specifically stated to like talent increases or gear bonus specific to those spells which apply different move speed bonus values.
---
I.e. Ghost wolf applies passive aura #31 with a value of 40, but the pvp boots for shamans apply a stacking buff (aura #107, value 15) that stack increasing that total move speed to 55%.
---
Oh okay, thank you. I will investigate further and see what I can do.
---
Sounds like you are playing a bad server. Any server that uses Nostalrius core has good stealth mechanics. Gut Ripper is broken in every server though lol
---
I was just looking for one of these, thanks a lot for making this!
---
I guess I could join the majority and ask what class I should play, why we should be nochanges, or another post ranting about the release date.
---
But then people would complain that I'm just another one of those posts.
---
This is so true. That encouter is just bonkers.
---
Why to farm gold in Classic to get gold for retail? Then just farm in retail + farming in retail will get some extras, anchi,toys,pets  and other sh1t.
---
At least it's a different thing to talk about than endless posts about changes, release dates, and whether or not hybrids are "viable".

üåÑ**&lt;Lakeshire Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance)** **(Maybe RP-PVP, Guild Vote)**üåÑ
---
What is Lakeshire Guard?
---
Lakeshire Guard is a moderate to hardcore raiding guild with strong PVP ties to Lakeshire and the Redridge Mountains! Though we aren't RPPVP we do immerse ourselves to do what it takes to defend Lakeshire, and maintain a fairly serious attitude about raiding and our strategies as a guild.
---
We will have a 3 part looting system that includes loot council, "wishlist" item for the current raid, and luck. We would like to offer the best in preparedness, but also want to be open to a total of 80+ unique players who want to play the race and class they desire! We will have priority raid group, and secondary raid groups. and sometimes these groups will inter-mix to gear certain players from the main raid.
---
We don't want to exclude any players from progressing so these raid swaps and off groups will only be for progression weeks, months. We want to be as fair and fun to everyone within our Guard! If someone else gets the loot, remember they are a Guard, and what they get benefits Lakeshire and all of our members.
---
Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you at the Inn.

Seeing this makes me newly disappointed for how "hero classes" turned out. I was legitimately excited at the thought of _converting_ my warrior to a death knight. Was so sad when they just made it a "new class, but doesn't start at level 1".
---
i know exactly what you mean! i tried doing this on a private server and people just ninja everything, ignore your /w and ignore your group invite. when you do get a group invite and you just finished killing the one guy for the quest, they instantly leave, no thank you, no asking if you want to do more quests together. hope that classic doesnt have that type of people in it!
---
90's In Flames always does the job.
---
Oh my god. Pally is alliance only :(
---
It's a good starting point for sure, leaves you tons of room to build on to quite easily.
---
That server core was MangOS, which is what the other 2 current "popular" private servers use -- but with obvious tweaked drop rates.
---
The server is the "blights" "pope" "Forth" Hale", and stealth mechanics were similar in its competitor "Server K#"
---
Portals. Free food and water. Good dps. Blink.
---
If they ain‚Äôt furry, rotting, green, or blue, then I‚Äôm sorry, but those friends aren‚Äôt for you.
---
No problem, that you for giving it a try! Any feedback you have would be fantastic!
---
Thanks for the fast response!  
---
I will have to go and re-watch it. I thought he mostly went over duo comps. I am playing a warrior, I think my friend will likely play a shaman. So we will be mismatched until we can both afford a mount. We are not too worried about that.   
---
Mostly we just want to be efficient in our questing route to limit tedious grinds where possible (understanding that grinding is simply apart of the leveling) we want to make it as little as possible.   
---
Seems like all the good leveling guides are just geared towards solo play, was hoping to find a duo one, ive been searching for a while now with no luck.   
---
Ill rewatch the Kargoz guides today though!
---
I hope Blizz goes the RS07 route w/ classic tbh
---
Did someone say thunder fury, blessed blade of the windseeker?
---
Priest!
---
Ever since my D&amp;D days, I loved playing a supporting class. Clerics, healers, any kind of "holy support" in any game I'd get my hands on. In an online game called "Endless Online", I rocked the priest class which could wear a tuxedo and goggles for cool stat buffs. In Tibia, I rolled Druid because they could make healing runes and sell them for profit. In Octopath Traveler, most recently, my favorite character to play as is Ophilia, a Priest hailing from this cool snowy town. Priests are just cool.
---
Mechanically, I love that the WoW version of priest lets you level with cool shadow abilities and wands! You have a ton of utility and almost no downtime. When I hit 60, finding a group is gonna be a breeze, and knowing that I'm essential to raids is really nice.
---
Source (your obviously baseless claims) or GTFO.
---
People don't need to know anything. They'll find out very quickly you can't solo everything. The wake up call is more effective than the warning, especially since so many will be experiencing vanilla for the first time
---
There are definitely feral pvp specs if that's your taste. Consider joining [this](https://discord.gg/AwbKWu) Discord which features PvP specs for all classes!

I recommend not bothering with it unless you have identical schedules because waiting around sucks balls.
---
Tag mob needed for quest, run away
---
Ahh that makes sense, I agree.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Not to mention armor values are buffed on pservers. Melee already does twice the DPS of ranged before Naxx, my guess is speed running guilds only bring like 2 mages lol.
---
Nothing beats fishing for lobsters at catherby. It's the comfiest thing.
---
"How much do you think it will cost?"
---
It will cost what an average classic player can make in a month, more or less comfortably.  Just like retail.
---
I guess the fact that there is no official way to exchange retail gold for classic gold will increase the price a bit, but the demand will be there and I'm sure third party sites will act as the middleman.
---
It's sad really, but there is nothing we can do about it as long as retail tokens exist. Some people will be able to buy gold that way, while other players will be able to cover their sub with classic gold. 
---
Sure it won't have an effect on the economy, which is at least something, but the idea that everyone in classic has to put in the same amount of effort will be undermined.
---
Was thinking the same thing, its still incomplete.
---
RP probably lel.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Ha same, currently building a new house that should be done in june.  I need time to move in and set everything up
---
Always thought that was ironic as hell. Shows how classic will do.
---
&gt; Then here's what you can do. First, decide the SPECIFIC population number that warrants you calling a server 'dead'. Specific number, so that you can keep an eye on population, and if it hits that number you instantly delete all your characters and reroll on another server.
---
I mean...a lot of people dont want to do that.  Thats kind of the point.  Why the hell would i actually be okay with deleting all of my hard work?  Why would i want to have to restart a couple months in (we flat out dont know how long people will stay interested.  Maybe servers go downhill in a week, maybe it takes 2 months) when it will take me until Phase 2, or perhaps longer to get back to max level?  Ill miss out on more content/more of the experience that way.
---
&gt;Because a higher server population means that the things you personally accomplish there are somehow more valuable because you can compare yourself to a greater population there?
---
&gt;Eh, probably not that.
---
&gt;So what's the difference between a retail player who plays to level 10, decides it isn't for them, and leaves, versus another player who plays to level 10, decides that they *feel like* the server is *dead*, and rerolls on a higher populated server?
---
&gt;Answer, there's no difference. Anyone can play where they want and for how long they want.
---
Honestly dont even know what youre getting at here.
---
Higher population has it downsides, yes.  Harder to farm rares, harder to farm herbs, etc.  On the other hand, the AH tends to be in MUCH better shape, its easier to pug content if you want to, its easier to group up out in the world to do quests, theres more guilds to choose from that are much more likely to work with your play times.  
---
Perhaps most importantly, youre much more likely to have a social experience.  Part of why i play an MMO is for the community.  I want to chat with people in zones, and if theres only a few of us there thats probably not going to happen.  I have a lot of fun conversations over my nearly 10 years playing WoW.  I want that to happen on Classic as well, and its not going to if zones are fairly empty.
---
As for the second part, I mean...no, theres not a difference for the server, but its bad for the server either way and will just create a snowball effect that makes the server worse off.  The reason i mentioned it is simply that were going to have fall-off from retail players/tourists, and its something that needs to be thought about.  Blizzard is definitely thinking about it (sharding is partially for how many people that will be sticking around there are, but also for people that are just logging on to see the game).  Some people will quit early, some will stick around for a while and get sick of running around on foot at level 25 and decide its not for them to do that for another 15 levels.
---
&gt;Anyway, since we're defining minimum numbers for stuff like 'what is a dead server', let's also define the minimum level somebody has to hit in order to not be considered a tourist. Gotta be the same level for everyone.
---
Wtf are you even talking about? lol  Where did i say we had specific numbers?  Why does it matter who is officially labeled a tourist?
---
All that matters is if people are actually playing.  I dont really care if a tourist is considered someone that quits after 10 minutes, a week, or a month.  The simple fact is that people are going to stop playing before even hitting max level for whatever reason and its going to contribute to servers having less activity on them.
---
&gt;And closing with the arbitrary, if a server has 100 people and you make friends with 50 of them, it can *feel* less dead than a 1000 player server. Ain't saying low pop servers rule all the time...but either you join a server intending to build the community, or you don't.
---
And that server of 100 people will have an absolutely dead AH, far fewer BoEs available, and you'll have a hell of a time even forming one guild/group to clear raids.  You'll have people playing at different hours, available different days, etc.
---
It takes a lot of people to make a server really 'work'.  Being stuck on smaller realms really shows that.  I left a medium pop realm in early Cata because of it.  It wasnt dead, but it was frustrating to find a 'good' raiding guild (even with the smaller raid sizes) that worked at my times.  It was impossible to find pvp groups.  
---
I ended up xferring to a high pop realm, and while farming herbs was harder and the server sometimes felt a bit less 'intimate', i had opportunities to do things i never could have on the smaller server.  It was easier to level professions on alts because the AH was actually active (hell, it was easier to do things with professions at max level).
---
rise against- survive
---
I can say my vanilla guild had a warrior MT and warrior backup. I off tanked in MC as arms warrior. I'm certain we had a druid off tank for certain trash. That's all I can offer anecdotally.
---
Would it be possible to do Quest lookups as well? Would probably be pretty useful during levelling.
---
Yeah I dropped that blueberry at 20 and never looked back. Can't imagine why it took me 20 day /played to 60
---
Flying mount killed wpvp. People avoided eachother by flying over or under.
---
True that. Tough to have a fresh subreddit about a 15 year old game that's been discussed to death and is about to be re-released.
---
Vanish no longer has a cooldown.  
---
Presence of Mind is no longer a talent, learned at level 40 instead.  
---
Dash is usable in all forms, cannot be dispelled.  
---
Wyvern Sting no longer a poison, instead a physical debuff.  
---
Reckoning is now a passive ability learned at level 40.  
---
Holy spells may now be cast while in Shadowform.  
---
Mana Tide totem now restores all of the mana in one burst.  
---
Demonic Sacrifice no longer a talent, learned at level 30.  
---
Removed stance, shield and weapon restrictions for Warriors.
---
That ought to be enough to make everybody's lives miserable I should think.
---
And shammy - horde
---
Pardon my dumb noob question but what does it mean when someone says "roll" in this context?
---
I'll see less Sephiroth bastardizations but probably the name number of Arthas ones.
---
Less Chuck Norris'ish ones too.
---
Hunters are a pain in the cock to multibox in vanilla because of all the pet management and having to worry about ammo. 
---
Unless you plan on dual boxing at 60 for whatever reason I‚Äôd just recommend leveling the classes that you want to play. You can make any combo work.
---
But the people who would think it is easy, which is whom this post is about, already know enough and can't unlearn it. They people who've forgotten wouldn't think it's easy
---
the difficulty floor is much higher in vanilla but that ceiling is pretty low.  kiting an elite like this is in the higher tier of difficult feats in vanilla but it's not difficult for the modern player
---
According to out countdown pod cast bro, its just an employee alpha, not fam and friends. As of a ~week ago
---
Absolutely, this is currently in the backlog of things to do. I am investigating how I would like to implement something like this.
---
I agree with everything you said. One thing I do want to add though, I fucking love BfA's art and music. It's incredible, and WoW's graphics are truly great for its age. The animations are kinda wonky in a lot of places, but I really enjoy the new spell effects and shit.
---
Easy solution: wait a month after launch, wait for some of those 'tourists' to leave, then roll on a high pop server.
---
Invincible from the wotlk sound track is my favorite

Hearing this immediately makes me think of WoW because I listened to it a lot while leveling my first character back in mid-TBC. Immediately conjures up memories of Redridge on my Human Mage.
---
Hehe Great stuff
---
What did you do if you needed GM support? Did you get in the queue or did you fix the problem for yourself at work the next day? It seems like the latter might be forbidden.
---
Paladin: Bubble drains 10 mana per second and lasts while he has mana
---
Druid: Has damage.
---
Warlock: Fear has no DR, cannot be break by damage and can be casted on multiple characters at once.
---
Priest: Your damage abilities refill 50% of damage dealt as mana
---
Hunter: Your pet has 100% lifesteal that also heals the master
---
Shaman: you can cast spell while moving, is standing still, your spells cost no mana
---
Rogue: Whenever you stun a target, you get a double damage buff for 10 seconds
---
Warrior: Your hamstring ability grants you 30% bonus movement speed and makes you immune to any movement impairing effects for the duration of hamstring
---
Mage: Every frost spell you cast stuns a target for 1s, this stun has no DR

 **&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the ‚ÄúHigh Warlords Guild‚Äù, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt‚Äôve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would‚Äôve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn‚Äôt possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we‚Äôlll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn‚Äôt evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don‚Äôt be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/)

May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

Isn‚Äôt it wild that people follow them around doing nothing with their time? Lol
---
Yeah that sounds like it would be a mess for everyone
---
And the top post of all time on this sub is about someone wanting to play classic but not classic.
---
Optimize for how you want to spend your time in game.
---
Do you want to run 5 mans? Complete your tier-0/0.5 set as quickly as possible? Would you like to set the pace for the dungeon run, rather than being dragged along and berated for low DPS when OOM?
---
I've got just the class for you! Protection warrior! Highlights:
---
* There's always someone in LFG in Ironforge that needs a tank. You can run a dungeon pretty much any time of day, any day of the week.
---
* No groups running the dungeon you want to do? Start your own group! You'll have 3 ~~warm bodies~~ DPS before you can blink, and surely your healer friend wants to help you run Stratholme _again_.
---
* Dungeons will get cleared at your pace. When the DPS inevitably gets impatient and pulls without you, you get the unique pleasure of deciding whether you want to help them, or [let them perish for their impudence](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WarpedPassionateCopperhead-size_restricted.gif).
---
* Enjoy the unique challenge of holding aggro. Anyone can DPS - just memorize a rotation\*. Tanking requires a unique sense of awareness. Plus, when things go poorly, you can just blame the DPS for not watching their threat more carefully.
---
* Build your leadership and organizational skills. Plan out each pull, using the tools at your disposal. Remember, {skull} is always first kill target, {x} is second, and {moon} is the sheep target. Shackle doesn't exist, and no hunters are competent enough to get a freezing trap off\*, so don't worry about other forms of CC.
---
* Bonus: PvP gets silly with your health pool. Sure, you can't kill anything, but you can certainly be an utter pest while your mage friend finishes them off (or gets ganked by the stealthed rogue that you ignored).
---
\* This is a sarcastic post, please DPS folks don't hate me.
---
Sorry, what is RS07?
---
Click to move? Do people actually use that?
---
I used to click my hotkeys beyond the 4 and 5 keys because I didn't understand I could make my own keybinds. I never took the time. Keybinds are a must. Lots more skills in a rotation to keep track of, especially in heal classes where you're tossing multiple ranks of a single spell.
---
&gt; luck-or-die 
---
&gt; This class gives you no choice 
---
Fuckin' sold!
---
Bears are only good for off-tanking trash/adds, they cannot function as MT.
---
Boomkins had okay-ish DPS but there's a reason why people call them OOMkins
---
Feral DPS was also okay but you're not there to DPS, you're there to buff the melee with 3% crit and brez/innervate when called for.
---
Warrior =)
---
For me personally an MMO 12 button mouse is something I can‚Äôt play wow without. Using modifiers you can have access to 48 actions from keybinds.
---
Hey, thanks! Got it working on my ps4 controller. Its really convenient!
---
Not optimal, but a fun way to lay back and level thats for sure.
---
frost nova can be an effective CC too, almost 10 sec of root.  That's a fun time for a mage though after you spend 10 minutes making food/water stacks!  You're the sole DPS basically, other than the little bit the heals will chip in and the tanks constant amount.
---
Lights Hope does
---
Furthermore, vanilla private servers have operated under the assumption:
---
Shield Bash (no spell interruption) = low threat generated (&gt;50)
---
Shield Bash (spell interruption) = moderate threat generated (180+)
---
99% of the time there is no reason to use it as a poor threat generator and should be relegated for spell interrupts only. The only exception would be fighting the green world dragons when you are cooldown starved due to the breath debuff and you are using literally every ability (even slam) to generate any threat you can until the next tank taunts it off you.
---
Woah that looks amazing. I‚Äôd pay him if he plans to make a classic version of that.
---
I had to wait in the queue like every other player!  They definitely didn't want me doing anything to my personal character as a GM, even if it were something benign like being stuck.  
---
If I happened to be logged in at work on my lunch break or something and I had a real quick easy fix issue you could just ask another GM on the floor to grab your ticket and fix it real quick no reply required, but that's about it.  Any of the other times it was just wait it out!

Well, good shamans should be totem twisting anyways so it's not like you're losing much. But yes, alliance hunters will do more damage.
---
But for your own faction its either paladin or shaman before rogue
---
Nothing happens when I invite him to my Server
---
Yes. But not because you suck, necessarily. The way I see it, if you see someone coming, you might think ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got time to summon XXX pet‚Äù for optimal counter - and in TBC, with the disorient option, if they interrupt, you still have your pet! ‚Äúoh well, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù 
---
But if you risk it, or in BG‚Äôs (especially when protecting a node):
---
‚ÄúHmmm, I should switch from XXX pet to XXX because they have a few XXX class doing really well, and XXX pet is a better counter...‚Äù 
---
*begins summon*
---
BAM interrupted! ‚ÄúOMG WHERE DID HE COME FROM AND OH CRAP I HAVE NO PET!!!!‚Äù
---
How about getting conjure food and conjure water 5 levels earlier? That way the mages can actually make the best quality food and water possible instead of lagging by 5 levels that they currently do.
---
We actually do! We both work at the same company with the same hours. He has a family, so he will have less time than me but not by much. Our gaming hours are basically set in stone.
---
Indeed. Well, removing GCD is a no-go if we want to keep things at least somewhat balanced in our hypothetical scenario.
---
Yeah... that's not how it works.
---
So in your paralell universe, you'll only bait the best players because they don't use addons. So your tactic only works against good players and not against bad ones?
---
There really isn't as much overlap as you seem to think due to the t1/t2 sets being actually good for priests and druids. You also get a free weapon for the first half of raid content in benediction.
---
Napoleon was about 5‚Äô7, as the measurement units the French used were different than today.
---
Appropriate, assuming you die frequently.
---
Flying mounts really hurt the game. I know people are no changes, and I am a believer as it is the best balance, but if there was a way to rewrite history and have flying mounts be on a cooldown (maybe 5-10 minutes) and you can only fly for maybe 30 seconds, that would be cool. I might even support that change if they ever to a tbc release like they are doing with classic.
---
I just hope it comes ASAP, so maybe if we all take a moment of prayer someone will hear us!
---
I don't remember it being that much of a difference, I think it was just something small like +25 extra threat for interrupting a spell.
---
That is really impactful - I can't believe how long it's been, and how close we are.
---
Not a fan of totems or any sort of short duration buffs that need to be juggled such as Battle Shout.
---
Another thing is a lot of totems have 20yd range which means you're goose walking after melee so they can get their little buff.
---
Totems alone made Shamans the most annoying class I'd ever played and I'd never recommend it to anybody.
---
Ahh the old classic fits here perfectly: Watch out, we got a badass over here!
---
Because a gamepad is way more confortable, specially if you have carpal tunnel.
---
If targeting (you only have tab with gamepads) and things like mouseover macros and aoe ground targeted skills weren't an issue, I'd be using gamepad all the time, because playing wow holding the right mouse button all the time takes a toll on the right wrist.
---
I was using executioners cleaver for a while back in the day.  Because it was blue and it was the coolest looking weapon I‚Äôd seen so far. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing obviously.

Rules/About Us: Currently, we are a mature group of men and women. It's a discord where there is freedom of discussion of whatever topics and many of us have known each other for literally 15+ years. Some in this discord are family members and good friends. We have roughly 30 people who will be playing Classic WoW here with the launch expected 4-6 Months(Summer of 2019)

The roles of what ever class and profession are open but it looks like we may be hurting for Druids,  Healers, Rouges and  Hunters.

The problem is they fall off right when the game actually starts to get hard and you actually need to optimize your raid set up.
---
I would settle for being able to shift directly into other forms
---
Just stack sunder tho
---
So, Zi've decided to be a Holy roller, but am confused. Isn't INT not native to plate/mail pieces? How do I gear from the start? What do I focus on?
---
Good job not dieing.  Keep it up!
---
I think pservers use 5% for Ironfoe?
---
I feel like even if it was 2% like hand of justice is, then Ironfoe would still be bis for a while.
---
No dude, it's not. It's a physical daze effect. You can't cleanse it.
---
I hoped someone would notice.
---
I get what you're saying, but in reality Hunters scale way worse than Warlocks with gear. It's night and day, really. I randomly fell on this video on Reddit :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU)  . It points out that Hunters' DPS increases by about 40% from MC to Naxxramas, while Warlocks are getting something close to a 200% increase. But it's true that in early game, Hunters are stronger than locks (better itemized gear, wepaon reliant, etc).

 Its old school runescape, they started there server in a 2007 vanilla state buy then updated it in a way the players actually wanted.
---
The problem druids had was itemization. Almost all gear that dropped in Molten Core and beyond was Tier gear, which means it was class-locked. Up to that point, most of your gear was shared with rogues, although there were a few pieces specifically intended for bear tanks as it had increased armor stats which Bear form multiplied further.
---
But once you hit raids, the vast majority of the gear you were allowed to wear was healing.
---
Worse than that, it‚Äôs pretty obvious the WoW devs had no clue what they were doing with druid gear outside of ‚Äúpriests in leather.‚Äù If you look at the Wildheart/Feralheart set, it‚Äôs completely schitzo. It has literally every stat: strength, agility, Int, Spi, Stam. Even some mp5 and spellpower. You‚Äôd think it would be goot for a ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù class, but since its item budget was diluted so much, it just ends up being terrible at everything.
---
If I remember correctly, ZG started offering some pieces of feral/rogue leather that wasn‚Äôt class-locked, but if you want to feral, you‚Äôre not getting much in the way of gear out of a 40-man raid.
---
Would love this. One item to note. Tame beast only works on neutral and hostile mobs, therefore the tamed druid would have to be from the opposite faction or the taming would have to occur in the Gurubashi Arena.
---

**&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; \[A\] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP**
---
**Intro**
---
Frozen    Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we  are   targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post  is   completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything  that   is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
**Meist√§**
---
Frozen    Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu l√§hinn√§    MMO-pelej√§ pelaava suomikilta, joka sen j√§lkeen on muodostunut    massiiviseksi pelaajayhteis√∂ksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat    eritt√§in vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi    pienest√§ Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan    kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in,    Lotron, EVE Onlinen sek√§ monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista    n√§ist√§ peleist√§ pelataan viel√§, toisia enemm√§n ja toisia v√§hemm√§n, ja    tarkoituksenamme on my√∂s jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien    pelien pariin. T√§ll√§ hetkell√§ killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final    Fantasy XIV:ss√§, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons    Online:ssa.
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu    Azerothiin ISOSTI, sill√§ WoW Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteis√∂mme    isoista peleist√§, jossa pyrit√§√§n saavuttamaan merkitt√§v√§ status tulevan    Classic WoWin maailmassa. Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja    menestyvin Suomikilta alkuper√§iseen Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean    MMORPG:n yhteis√∂llisyydest√§ ja haasteesta. Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni    my√∂s perheellisi√§, eik√§ meill√§ ole v√§ltt√§m√§tt√§ aikaa en√§√§ raidata    viitt√§ p√§iv√§√§ viikossa, mutta me teemme kaikkea contenttia aina    raideista PvP:hen sill√§ ajalla, joka meill√§ on k√§ytett√§viss√§.
---
**Mit√§ tarjoamme?**
---
Pitk√§ik√§isen    ja menestyneen pelaajayhteis√∂n, jonka riveiss√§ SINULLA on  mahdollisuus   pelata juuri niin paljon tai v√§h√§n kuin haluat, mutta  silti saavuttaa   my√∂s menestyst√§ peliss√§ hyv√§ll√§ porukalla. Me emme  halua pakottaa sinua   mihink√§√§n - saat pelata t√§sm√§lleen sit√§ hahmoa  jota haluat, t√§sm√§lleen   niin paljon tai v√§h√§n kuin haluat. Toivomme  ensisijaisesti uusiksi   Frozenilaisiksi sosiaalisia, hurttia huumoria  omaavia ihmisi√§. Se,   oletko nopea tai hidas levuttamaan, ei ole  t√§rke√§√§. T√§rke√§√§ on se, ett√§   sinulla on j√§rki p√§√§ss√§ ja syd√§n  paikallaan. Meill√§ ei ole   osallistumispakkoja, vaan  osallistumismahdollisuuksia. Meill√§ on   kuitenkin yleisen vapaan ja  rennon toimintatavan ohella my√∂s   mahdollisuus pelata ryhmiss√§, joissa  on korkeat tavoitteet, ja n√§ihin   toivommekin ensisijaisesti aktiivisia  ja pitk√§pinnaisia pelaajia, joilta   l√∂ytyy tahtoa toteuttaa asioita.
---
**Raidaus**
---
T√§ll√§    hetkell√§ suunnittelemme, ett√§ Classic WoW:ssa tullaan raidaamaan 2-3    kertaa viikossa inhimillisell√§ aikataululla. Alustavana tavoitteenamme    on kuitenkin clearata kaikki PvE content peliss√§, mutta maaliin ei  ole   kiire. Tarkempi raidausaikataulu toteutetaan yhteisty√∂ss√§ koko  killan   j√§senist√∂n kesken l√§hemp√§n√§ julkaisuaikataulua.
---
**PvP**
---
Killassa    tullaan my√∂s j√§rjest√§m√§√§n organisoitua PvP:t√§. My√∂s korkeampaa PvP    rankkia mets√§st√§vi√§ killasta l√∂ytyy ja tahtoa saavuttaa suuria asioita    my√∂s Horden nirhaushommissa.
---
**Hakeminen**

If you want to stand out... you roll a hunter. I say this because the skill cap truly is a huge difference between being good at that class or not. I know of two good friends that were hunters back in the day that were excellent. Completed the epic bow quest (not easy) and were kiting experts. Among other things, stuff like that can set you apart.
---
Common brother Pepega
---
Couldnt agree more. I feel like I‚Äôve burned myself out already (none else to blame but myself for that). I wish they gave the god damn release date already
---
I mean that makes sense, whether you like Classic or not, Classic being announced was the biggest news ever just because no one thought Blizz was ever gonna do it.
---
I don't even know what you mean by native stats on an item but it doesn't sound vanilla like so let me break it down for you.
---
You want +healing, mp5 and int. In that order and you are most likely going to be a wearing a cloth robe, plate gloves, leather shoulders, mail bracers and flip flops.. enjoy mate! I know I will
---
Same here.  Remembering all the fights is pretty hazy honestly
---
But playing vanilla through wrath will do that
---
What a quinkie dink
---
Come on, more energy
---
Yep, but it can also be a disadvantage on fights where absolutely everyone has to be on the ball, and in a raid environment where you almost never have the exact same players every week it becomes a pain to teach every new player the mechanics. A good example is C'thun where you *have* to do the pull right and it's so frustrating to go over the pull again and again every week. It also seems completely impossible to have nobody use AoE on Twin Emps. Thaddius is a nightmare if you have some slackers with you. Better just let them drown in the slime while the rest of the raid kills Thadd.
---
Vanilla Druids:
---
Feral DPS - Not viable due to very poor dps.
---
Bear Tank - Very strong OT capability and can easily MT majority of fights.
---
Boomkin - Not viable due to mana issues.
---
Resto - welcome everywhere.
---
Tbf, classicwow hasnt been released so the only thing to do in the meantime if you want classicwow content is to visit this subreddit.
---
Experience wise, I am heavily more experienced as a Hunter than I am a Warlock. I think I have exhausted every YouTube video when it comes to learning the class, both in PvP and PvE. 
---
The real key here is that I DO want to stand out. Thank you for your insight.
---
Fuck me if it was 17th that's well timed though.
---
Dual boxing in general in classic is a pain in the ass, but you can make it work. 
---
Id probably go something like paladin + mage. Youd fall behind at the levels where you'd aoe grind since paladin would more than likely just be your oh shit class that did nothing but bop / heal you if you got into trouble while stealing your XP, but it would still be a decent combo. Especially for getting up to those places where you AOE grind a lot.
---
You can't block/dodge/parry from being hit from behind afair. Always face mobs, If you're running away, strafe away so they can't hit your back and daze you.
---
Alliance locks kinda suck in pvp cus of wotf yeah.. a lot of people you fight will be warriors or undead so..! I think hunters are one of the easiest classes to distinguish yourself on, a bad Hunter is very easy to spot, and as such so is a good one. Both classes are good in pvp/bgs, I wouldn‚Äôt say either is better but I‚Äôd give a slight edge to hunter.
---
General tips for healers:
---
Mouseover macros for healing skills or addon doing that.
---
Have your raid/party frames just below your character so when you heal or monitor health you also look at the middle of the screen.
---
People don't need to be at 100% hp all the time. Regen mana and heal them when they start dropping to risky numbers.
---
\[NA\] \[Horde\] \[East Coast\] \[PvP Server\]

Just looking for friends to chat with on Horde side.  Already found a guild but hoping to just find others to just chat and befriend!  I'll be rolling a mage and playing semi-casual? (Few hours a day weekdays, then weekends 8+ hours).  I'm pretty new to Vanilla but hope to learn a lot, lets talk!  Maybe I can give you some snacks for your adventure!
---
Discord = .Ace.#0001
---
Looking for NA Saturday/Sunday morning raiding guild. 
---
Prefer horde but open to ally.
---
Also willing to play either healer or dps, will flex to fit a guild that has raid time I'm looking for.
---
Have experience on private servers and in retail since TBC. Mostly playing as a healer.
---
WF totem falls off for 0.3 milliseconds and you're getting angry PMs like it's the Nuremberg trials
---
Fun tip to make money that almost no one will be doing.
---
Make a level one alt. Run him to winterspring. There are BOE pattern vendors there. These patterns sell for a fuckton of gold once the game is going amd HIGHLY contested usually with bots.
---
When you farm enough gold on your firat character send it to the alt and buy up the lucrative recipes for as many times as you can.
---
Sit on the recipies for a bit until the price starts to skyrocket. Profit
---
Interesting, what about resto Druid?
---
We had a bear tank in vanilla, he tanked many MT fights in AQ, we even had him on MT on patchwerk and KT.   
---
He was r13 thou, so his gear was good. We gave him sort of gear prio over rogues on some items, still thou.  
---
It was very viable, and with the 1.12 changes, "today" its even better!
---
Looty-Booty scooty
---
KTM threat meters on a current private server reflect the numbers above when tested.
---
It makes sense from a design perspective, Blizzard wouldn't want warriors blowing their Shield Bash cooldown on mobs by spamming it into their threat rotation and not having it available for an interrupt, which is the main reason for it to exist in a tanks tool set. You are rewarded for properly interrupting a mob because that is big deal in vanilla.
---
Ah ok, thanks for the knowledge. Feel like I‚Äôm yet to find somebody who actually played a vanilla at 60 in vanilla lol
---
Would you recommend Nelf or Dwarf? I have rolled both and Stoneform seems like an excellent ability, but so does Shadowmeld.
---
Probably has something to do with the fact that retail players can actually play their game instead of refreshing reddit unlike people here.
---
I saw somewhere else that Druid tanks can‚Äôt avoid critical strikes and other tanks can which mean they can get one shot? Not sure if true
---
Jeez, this guy is on point.
---
You don't get it
---
Good to hear. Mainly interested in tank/heals anyway to be honest
---
They both have positives. Just go for whichever you want.
---
You're wrong about feral dps. It can pull its weight but just like ret paladin, it requires much more preparation than other dps specs.  Farming Pummeler from Gnomeregan is a pinnacle example of that. Of course, I'm not talking about hardcore guilds here.
---
I agree that flying was a can of worms they never should have opened. I dont think they can redo TBC without it though, so much of Outland is baked into being able to fly. 
---
However, I think a better option would be to have guns you can shoot people out of the sky to engage in PVP or something. Or limit the flight ceiling to 1000 yards above ground, not 10000 or whatever it is.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure private servers have a more accurate version of the original vanilla code than Blizzard does
---
Thanks but i think you misread the post :)
---
Hahaha. Same guild name, different servers. What a quinkiedink!
---
3% extra dps is a lot more "bonkers" than 5% increased health. If all of your rogues are human, that stacks up.
---
3% extra dps is in effect the entire fight whereas the extra 5% health is only in affect if the tank would normally die but the 5% saves them, which is rare because if it would kill you normally, usually the 5% wont save you and you'd be dead anyway.
---
Well, if we go down that road... I don't think I'm NoChanges for Wrath. Wrath had alot of good, but A LOT of easily correctable bad.
---
PvE Server all the way.
---
Wow, why has no one made this before?!
---
Amazing job
---
Lol literally pulling numbers out of your ass there.
---
nah you get the hang of it and by the time you're doing raids it's just routine
---
Want to be the only viable tank and wear the coolest looking armor? Or maybe you'd like to blow up people in pvp? Or even do the best pve dps once you've got the gear?
---
Yup warrior is the right way to go.
---
Nothing.

---
RemindMe! Never.
---
I went through my high-school 'metal' phase right when I started WoW. This exactly
---
So no one‚Äôs said P.I.M.P. By 50???
---
its nothing special, just do quests, guide or whatever.
---
if you see that some mobs are easy to kill, and there is a plenty. and its going well in this particular place, hold on on this place and grind for some time.
---
Other than that, don't rush ahead and do red quests, wish is a constant temptation if you are duo leveling. since they are doable.
---
But by doint that you run out of quests at next levels, and will ahve to grind for like several levels to catch up. which you don't want to do. so resist the tempatation and do quests at their time.
---
In solo leveling guides, they don't do dungeons and groups elite quests. Which you will do, so you compensate for your xp lost for. 
---
So it ain't that bad. solo guides miss out on top of group xp and chains. (make sure you pick up all the quest for dungeons and do prequests if needed, so you get max xp out of it).
---
Also you can grind outdoor elites, like dustwallow marsh have whelps elites you can farm. whole area on the south of the zone.
---
elites outside of zf. and each basically outside of every dungeon. elites reward bonus xp so its viable to grind as a duo. 
---
if you incorporate all i mentioned, don't rush ahead of your level, grind here and there when its convinient and easy, do group content, grind elites when you can.
---
you should level fine as a duo without some especially extensive or annoying grinding required.
---
Honestly your best chance to get into a hardcore guild (if you have no pre existing connections) is play a dwarf priest grind to 60 asap like crazy no life shit. Then make connections with all the other no lifers and weasel your way in.
---
Except i dont want to miss out on the early content/experience....
---
FF being on with Sunder doesn't mean the armor stacked.
---
Dude. All these assumptions are worthless unless you now QA practices inside Blizzard.  Also, if there weren't alpha tests sooner then month ago the game might be incredibly buggy which I hope is not the case.
---
Warcraft 1, 2 &amp; 3
---
Still waiting for Warcraft 4
---
As far as I know, the add-on API will be identical to live. But there will be heavy restrictions on what can be utilized. Most add-ons you use now can be made in one form or another in classic.
---
then there's no problem, play from launch and have that experience, then if you need to reroll to get off your low pop server you can do that after and have that experience

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.

I am recruiting for such guild at the moment. The thing is, we don't expect half the applicants actually will be raiding. **But it's all about volume** \- if 30% of the starting roster will end up in raids, it will be enough. Of course we're recruiting for a niche Finnish guild but it applies just the same.
---
&gt;Will I regret rolling Warlock on Alliance given WoTF?
---
Not really, the effect is a bit overstated. You might as well be regretting rolling one on Horde due to paladins being able to cleanse.
---
Eh, I don't think getting rid of the turn left/right binds is mandatory. Most of the time I hold right click to turn and strafe, but sometimes I'm not doing anything critical and I want to be able to turn to get LOS to cast a spell or something and I'm picking up a drink with my right hand. I'd rather give up 2 extra binds to have it available.
---
I do rebind WASD to ESDF though, so that essentially gives me an extra couple of keys to bind (W and A). And I don't bind strafe keys.
---
Really all of this stuff is pretty minor and up to personal preference. None of it will save you any time. Switching from clicking to using binds will save you time though.
---
Even the demo was considered easier than regular classic too. It was confirmed that crits hit harder, regen was higher, and stats on items weren't right. It'll be even harder than that.
---
Depends on your play style.  If you like ambushes then NEs all the way, but if you like being active and moving around looking for targets, then Dwarf.  Personally I could never sit still long enough to play a NE hunter right.  Same reason I suck as a rogue.
---
learning how to be situationally aware can really help your gameplay. sometimes this needs to be done with external addons like a threat meter, sometimes it's as simple as keeping an eye on your surroundings. oh, that mob is running towards the healer? good thing you caught it in time so you can cc it, right?
---
&gt; RNG will be RNG. You isolated experience doesn't prove anything.
---
One isolated experience doesnt prove anything but in this thread are reports of lots of people having bag spam. Thats hardly isolated.
---
I think a lot of the enjoyment of classic is being there for the progression of the content.
---
Even if you can‚Äôt play much, experiencing the bugs (if there are any), lack of bags, people hawking bags in gold shire, etc. see the no honor PvP witness your form of south shore in phase 2...that‚Äôs the journey.
---
Showing up in phase 3 and joining into a developed/ing community is cool too, but there is something to be said for having been there since more or less the beginning.
---
How dumb would it be if they just released expansions over time all the way up to bfa? Then people would ask for vanilla again so they would need to release WoW Classic Classic
---
Just listen to "For the love of money - O'jays" and make wow great again!
---
Rokdelar?
---
Nost was good not because of accuracy but because it was the first mainstream one. Pservers now are a lot more accurate than nost was.
---
Also, they admit to having mob abilities wrong in general. A lot of mob abilities are just missing, they dont know when the mobs actually use the abilities, the damage values on those abilities can be wrong, the mechanics of those abilities can be wrong, etc.
---
Pet and mob pathing is wrong.
---
and i'm sure much more.
---
Sounds good - shoot me a message on discord if you have questions.
---
You are looking way too much into it. Do people of this mentality exist? Yes. Do some people in each camp throw shade at each other? Yes. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean shit. Ignore the noise dude, it‚Äôs just drama. 
---
Spoiler, you can hang with casual players and still hardcore raid on raid nights.
---
Sounds good!
---
I definitely consider myself more of an offensive player, so I am definitely leaning towards Dwarf over Nelf
---
I wouldn‚Äôt immediately send a horribly incoherent email to my boss stating:
---
Hey!!!!1111(one)(one)!!! I ned time of for a week b/c I will b busy. I saved all the vaca for that week. Thanks you.
---
Laugh hard as a mount and blade player !
---
Shaman totems are now always-on passive auras
---
Another add-on to use is snowfall which makes your abilities trigger on key press not release.
---
Even just putting it on bnet requires work lol.
---
What, does that guy expect them to buy all of the original server blades back too?
---
Perfect
---
My point was while the increase is decent and better than nothing, it‚Äôs not anything game breaking. 
---
If you bring 5 human rogues to a raid and assuming none of them are using daggers, it might make your fight 1% shorter overall. On a 3-minute fight it shortens the duration by 2 seconds. 
---
Bonkers indeed.
---
Priests were op in general then. My aq/bwl geared rogue friends would kill them selves on my pws reflect and swp damage long before getting through my health, let alone mana.
---
in vanilla you had both and switched for rag.. but on private....dunno, prolly got good enough healing and DPS to yolo it now :)
---
I mean, I came into the game around 1.09 or 1.12 I think.  So it would be true to my experience.
---
Alliance Warlock will pretty much guarantee you a raid slot and easy gearing because not a lot of people roll them on the alliance.  PvP will be harder, but once you're well geared Warlocks own almost everyone.
---
As a hunter, everyone will assume that you suck and because you're hanging back while fighting most of the time, they won't really notice you doing anything cool.  I didn't get noticed as a hunter until I was completely dominating the DPS charts in MC and Ony.  However, the PvP is so sweet on a hunter.
---
I would have Red Hot Chili Peppers "By the Way" Album on repeat from like level 45-60 on my first character. Which took me a solid 2\~ months to get through in my younger days.
---
My parents couldn't stand it
---
This happens to me **ALL** the time! I have a mental list that I need to put together for my journey back into Classic WoW this summer. 
---
*note I am an album person so I would say entire albums were my soundtrack while leveling etc\**
---
**Franz Ferdinand** \- You Could Have It So Much Better
---
**Modest Mouse** \- Good News For People Who Love Bad News
---
**Red Hot Chili Peppers** \- Greatest Hits *(Hit 60 listening to this!)*
---
**Anberlin** \- Never Take Friendship Personal
---
**Coheed and Cambria** \- The Suffering *(was the only song I knew of theirs at the time, had it on repeat in The Wetlands)*
---
**Air** \- Talkie Walkie
---
**Pixies** \- Trompe le Monde
---
**Wilco** \- A ghost is born
---
**Spoon** \- Kill the Moonlight
---
There is definitely more to add to the list but these are for sure the notable mentions, every time I hear them I feel those Classic WoW feelings.
---
Nostalgia is one hell of a drug, nOt ThAt ClAsSiC iS jUsT nOsTaLgIa!
---
As a warrior and Druid you pretty much had 2-3 bags completely full of situational gear. Annoying but hey it‚Äôs classic and that‚Äôs how we did things, uphill in the snow both ways.

wow is shorter and better to say wowhead.... then Warcrafthead üòÅüòÅ

Just take the L and move on dude.
---
I'm not shitting on them or what they did. Nowhere did I say that they aren't to thank for Classic releasing. It is well known that there is a lot wrong with private servers, though. Even the private server creators will admit that there is still a lot wrong with private servers.
---
I can say that there is just a lot of things that are wrong and guesswork with private servers without looking down on the people who created it.

So excited!!

What? This *is* related to wow classic..
---
I think in retail the accomplishments are just all shifted to endgame rather than throughout the game like in classic
---
You have to add garrisons, you think you do but you dont, LFR, and phasing.
---
As a MT you carry your Primary Gear, Threat Set, Resist Sets, Situational Trinkets, Weapon Chained Weapon, If youre prot and not always MT you want a nightfall. Plus then all your pots, weapon stones, foods etc.
---
If I were you, I'd probably stream with a significant delay like up to half an hour.
---
We used to have to do that back in MechWarrior 4, Living Legends and even into Mechwarrior: Online to people couldn't get intel on where we were, what we had, and all that.
---
Enchanting/Tailoring
---
Much better
---
FR is useful in the following encounters during progression:
---
Baron Geddon (MT)
---
Trash around Baron Geddon (MT/OT)
---
Ragnaros - MC (MT)
---
Vael - BWL (MT/OT)
---
Firemaw - BWL (MT/OT)
---
Four Horseman - Naxx (MT/OT)
---
Outgeared and speed clearing, FR gear will be retired for the above encounters.
---
WoW tavern music :)
---
It's more about streamers than Classic itself. That is why it was removed.
---
retail bad, classic good
---
upvotes to the left
---
Hey speak for yourself I'm playing World of Excelcraft over here.
---
It's okay to say "female characters" btw, doesnt have to be "cutie gamer girl". Lots of people make female characters despite not being female. They aren't trying to be cutie gamer girls.
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion, but the upright orc posture looks pretty badass.  Makes them look a lot more intimidating.
---
Bear is viable in MC through to Naxx, cat is a bit memey but if they show up to raid with full consumes and don't fuck up they're good in my book at least. Resto starts off slow in MC and BWL, turns into a very solid healer in AQ and Naxx.
---
Depending on attendnece requirements for a given guild and whether they run lean or large rosters, 5-8 probably seems right.
---
Heals for life.  Not glamorous, but always needed, often challenging in its own way, and very satisfying when you can save a group from the unexpected.  AKA "healing stupid".
---
The fastest trio leveling strategy is definitely 3 mages for the insane amount of aoe grinding potential
---
Horde troll warrior tank endgame can roll dual weild fury and be a top 10 dps and the best tps.
---
I have never played on a shitty private server, I am just using what I have seen some of them as examples of how they are wrong.
---
I played with multiple max level characters in raiding guilds in original wow though, so nice try there.
---
That ones real good.  Not ridiculous but just enough to make mages OP
---
You call that keyboard turning, they call it authentic experience.
---
The "pvp servers are a 24/7 gankefest" is a gross over exaggeration, especially if we are to get vanilla server population sizes.  Unless you're at a known hotspot like Camp Nessy, hanging outside by Tanaris, or Black Rock Mountain entrances, you'll be left mostly alone.
---
r/wow is also a much older sub, meaning a lot of people that used to browse it has moved on.
---
I really appreciated this as well.
---
IMO, putting leveling on hold for an hour to make yourself a nice little rival to fight is well worth it.  You and an enemy player fighting over the same mobs or quest items, constantly rezzing and backstabbing/ganking each other.  Fun times.
---
It's pretty ridiculous. You would no longer lose to anyone 1 on 1. Okay maybe Shamans still.
---
Melee kiting between auto attacks/cooldowns/energy, especially if they are slowed (hamstring, crippling poison). For warriors you can use the time to wait for MS/BT to come up or use the range for intercept. For rogues you can use it to wait for Gouge CD or even re stealth against players.
---
Not really in the spirit of the question but a cool idea.  I'd like to add: shadow priests get Darkness, a ranged aoe non-damage spell that in pvp causes anyone standing in it to detarget and not be able to tab target and reduces vision to zero, causing user (not spell effect) disorientation.  And in PVE, warlocks or spriest who stand in it can use an ability like VW's consume shadows, but to regen mana, not health.
---
Then perhaps thats even more incentive to start with launch so you can experience the parts you missed?
---
Also it is a relatively new sub, compared to r/wow. It would be only logical that the % of active subscribers goes down over time
---
Holy shit, that was almost 6 years ago.
---
Yes, they do.  You have to remember to dismiss yours from the last fight if they are in a mob's path.  I don't think it was until after vanilla that shamans got Totemic Recall and a bunch of quality of life stuff.
---
Wotf, 2min cooldown, TOTALLY makes Alliance locks suck /s.
---
Don't worry. The "rolling" comes from "rolling a dice".
---
When an item drops for your group, you have the choice to click "need", "greed" or "pass". When you click "need", you'll compete against the other players who clicked it, so you'll roll the dice and get a random number from 1 to 100. Whoever gets the highest number wins the item.
---
This obviously depends on your group's or raid's loot setting, but even if your raid has a loot council, you still have to decide if you have a need for this item or not. If you do, the loot council decides whether you receive the item or someone else, this time not depending on luck, but it's still out of your control so it's basically like rolling a dice, but everyone has different chances.
---
Very detailed and informative - Thank you!
---
maybe because they are playing the game meanwhile people who wait for classic just scroll through the same postst here everyday lol
---
I'll put in vacation notice then finally decide what my goals will be during that time off. I'm not sure what I want to do and when.
---
Lmao you think you need a W or an L in some reddit post.  Fuck of and stop being bad, or do you think that Serrated Blades does -0 armor?
---
The Chad melee class
---
Dude, same! haha I hit 60 listening to them!
---
What raid times on the weekend?
---
Female trolls *puke*
---
These off specs are viable and playable. They (feral, boomkin) require more prep and consumables to be as competitive as other DPS, but can hold their weight. Top 5 guild might only have one boomkin and only if they trust that player. Depends on your guild structure, but everyone will be able to find a home.
---
Druids can definitely tank but generally didnt at the start till itemization and ZG/DM items let them gear up more. Druids are more welcome as Resto and can heal great, but druids in every aspect suffered from the ‚Äúhybrid tax.‚Äù
---
A good player can still get a lot out of each role.
---
Charge can be used in combat.
---
Our guild didn't really care either.  Everyone just stacked dots/debuffs like it was going out of style.
---
The post has been deleted. Thanks for taking the time to investigate this.
---
He came just to sell his guide. What an idiot...
---
In full r10 you can probably get into MC/BWL pugs
---
I respect the people who actually made this a reality and stuck to it.
---
It's just that there's obviously something wrong with the "lol you'll see pservers got it completely right" when for example something a simple as the pservers leveling guides are already known to be not suitable for Classic before even release
---
You don‚Äôt need much FR, only for the first few clears and after that the healers should easily keep you up.
---
Is this a reference? I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre on about.
---
Most have it around 4%, which is still a Nef quality weapon, and even stronger than that with wbuffs due to how the proc scales.
---
I guess mainly the ones people used in their videos in those days.
---
Raiders: Call On Me and Ready Steady Go
---
PvPers: Let The Bodies Hit The Floor
---
Explorers: Airwave
---
I think those are the ones most people who played Classic would immediately associate with it. :)
---
Druids cant be polymorphed and pallys could still bubble out of it. Plus trinkets and stuff
---
I'm not being locked out of the name Chuck Norris because I don't have my password from 14 years ago.  Get bent.
---
You'll need the sinew from Ony as well, I had my leaf for what felt like months back in vanilla cause that sinew just wouldn't drop and I was 3rd in line for it..
---
I really hope in 2 years time they keep with the spirit of Classic content and not release TBC.
---
aka an aura
---
Nice. Not too much but still would be a really strong buff
---
This is it, chieftains 
---
Leveling in a world where full T2 60s aren‚Äôt running around one-shotting 20s
---
But it‚Äôs not something that I see anyone really wanting to discuss here. It‚Äôs a subreddit about a game people are hyped about and your post is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm overworked and don‚Äôt want to play the game on launch with limited bag space and fresh playerbases.‚Äù
---
Part and parcel of being the best class in the game.
---
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say except you're doing it wrong...
---
Perhaps you are viewing the buffs subsheet? 
---
Simply mouse-over and click the link that pops up...
---
Partially true. They survive, but take a lot more damage, so it stresses the healers' mana pools unnecessarily. They also can eat unlucky consecutive crits and get bursted down, so mistakes are easier to make.
---
He isn't raiding.
---
Right. That would make paladins a must have in dps groups. A bunch of rogues with seal of righteousness aura would smash dps
---
I sit in IF and ppl just give me money
---
Those aren‚Äôt pro tricks. Those rudimentary skills every game should know.
---
I want to revisit the old world again, but I only started playing as WOTLK was released (family couldn't afford/wouldn't pay for it for me before then). I've played through BC raids on pservers and WotLK on live, but never Vanilla. (I leveled to 50 on Nost)
---
I want the feeling to be nostalgic, but the endgame to be totally fresh, and it will be. I'm so excited.
---
I specifically have fond memories of being in Winterspring relistening to "Zypher Song" over and over and over again lol. What good times
---
They will still make more money though. The only player count effecting you or me would be the server population.
---
***Will old addons work in classic wow?*** No. They are updating the entire client, addons from back then almost certainly will not work. They will need to be updated to work with the new client. Similarly, addons for 1.12 private servers will not work either. In addition, current retail addons will most likely fail to load as well.
---
***Will Blizzard limit the API to match with vanilla WoW?*** Also likely no. Whether or not individual things like those trinket addon tricks will work is something I'm not knowledgeable enough to tell you, but I am pretty sure they've said they will not allow a lot of the addons from oldschool wow that allowed for 1-click playing (e.g. raid heal addons that auto-targeted the lowest HP member of your group and cast the appropriate downranked heal based on missing HP). So if anything, they're going to be *more* restrictive of addons. I would expect that things like enemy cast bars will not be available, but I don't know if we've had official blue posts about it.
---
omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Actually 
---
Feral DPS - Not viable due to bad dps
---
Bear Tank - Not viable due to too may crits
---
Boomkin - Not viable due to  bad dps
---
Resto - Not viable due to bad hps
---
Generally you just need stam, int and spell damage/healing. The gear requirement is very similar to Resto.
---
Husband/Wife Hunter and Holy/disc priest looking for classic guild.
---
What we're looking for:
---
* Horde
---
* PVE server
---
* DKP (preferably one with safeguards in place to make sure things like Thunderfury find appropriate homes, without those safeguards, I'll plow thunderfury on a hunter just to prove how dumb it is to not guarantee it going to the main tank.)
---
* North America
---
* Hardcore/Semi-Hardcore
---
* Mature guild that won't tolerate toxic behavior and holds people accountable for how their interactions affect the reputation of the guild.
---
What we have to offer:
---
* Plenty of vanilla experience, we raided through AQ in vanilla, as well as raiding in TBC &amp; WotLK we have also hit private servers over the last couple of years to refresh ourselves.
---
* Experience in hardcore progression raiding in Vanilla.  During AQ, we were in our server's top guild.
---
* Decades of experience with MMOs, my wife started in Everquest in 2000, I started in Dark Sun Online in 1996
---
* Experience in various guild leadership rolls including recruitment, raid leading, loot management, and even being guild leader of a hardcore progression guild in Everquest in the early 2000's.
---
* Open availability.
---
* We're both two boxers so will have alts available for raid coverage before most people on the server have a single 60.
---
Feel free to contact me via private message if you have any questions.  Please note however, that we are firm our decision to do a PvE server, as well as firm on our decision to rule out any guild that does a pure loot council system.
---
This. Retail has shrunk down to a weird place where the game gets "longer" (morel levels) yet they focus primarily on the current expansion. So you get a lot of weird pointless non-current content that makes the majority of the game just...... filler bullshit.
---
Monks show this by being horribly imbalanced and disproportionately powerful at low levels. They were never meant for any of the earlier stuff so they aren't tuned for it.
---
If Blizz goes anywhere with classic beyond bringing it back, I hope they understand that you can't sac 60 levels of content and just focus on the following 10.
---
Is it $20 or $2? Eother way it might be worth it for the manual inside
---
&gt; Will old Addons work in Classic WoW?
---
No, they use the new API. Demo client had the 7.3.5 API, and I think for classic release they'll use modified 8.x.x.
---
&gt;Will Blizzard limit the API to match with Vanilla WoW?
---
[Yes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=42m30s), but we do not yet know how much they'll limit it. Things like castbars and focus was commented out in the demo client, I'd guess functions related to those will be blocked on the release client, and a few others.
---
You know that's just a tooltip error in talent calculators. Like the actual talent in pservers does work. Anyways I'm done.
---
r/dataisbeautiful
---
Yea it works because they forced it to work from back theory.
---
A lot of the comments I see about classic being easy are in regards to raiding because of lack of mechanics, and in that case I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre really wrong compared to retail wow, play retail without guides, dungeon journal, etc. and the fights are much harder and you can very easily wipe raids if you don‚Äôt play correctly.
---
Ah, okay, let me just go spend 12 hours combing through every line of code on private servers to determine the EXACT percentage of vanilla accuracy...
---
Every time I hear me some audioslave or soundgarden immediately brings me back to the TBC dailies lol
---
You CAN, but you're vastly inferior to warriors because you take ~25% more damage and don't have any cooldowns.
---
&gt; You're apparently also supposed to click to move? 
---
Hahaha
---
Seriously though, it would be kind of cool if feral didn't have a wall between rogue and warrior forms/resource points/abilities.  Like a rage and energy bar in either form with all feral abilities available.  Would give cat form a heroic strike and bear form an instant attack like shield slam.  rage gen and energy regen would have to be tweaked a bit in each form but it would make things a tiny bit more interesting.
---
Transa - Supernova (grinding nef and getting him down)
---
Anything from the Niar rogue pvp videos
---
Totally.  I don't expect I'll set foot in any raids but am still really looking forward to just enjoying a classic game with like minded people who know exactly what they're getting into and hopefully are equally determined to enjoy it.
---
Of course, that said, a buddy and I are totally taking a week's vacation and no-lifing the hell out of the game sometime soon after launch.  We did it in original Classic and we're doing it again, and it will be glorious. :)
---
Did you get a good enough answer mate?
---
Slow attack speed pet's doesn't benefit more from Frenzy, its actually likely they benefit less.
---
Let me know if you need an explanation!
---
Eating hateful strikes on patchwerk and tanking adds on KT is not "MT".
---
Ready Steady GO! BWOMM
---
That is an issue, but they won't get one-shot. Bears being more vulnerable to crushing blows and crits (due to lower defense) is partially made up for by having more armor and larger HP pools then warriors.
---
A bear tank isn't *optimal* - he does very little *better* then a warrior, but a bear tank is absolutely *viable*. As a main tank, they can have some big issues - namely, some bosses just *fuck* them (Nef's class call mechanic, for example), and they don't have a way to naturally break fear (This can be made up for on the Alliance, at least, via fear ward). They also don't have the situational utility and shield wall a warrior MT brings.
---
I'm so pumped for this, and wanted to add some stuff for the Druid Bonus Round.
---
Want to have 3 sets of gear? Want to have your alt-spec items still fall to you even when running something else in your main spec because the said item is so niche only for your class that you get it anyway, even if you're banking it?  
---
Want all the best PvP tools in-one: Charge, Stealth, and Healing?  
---
Want to be able to solo any melee elite in the game, even a few levels higher than you, using only Entangling Roots and low-impact Arcane and Nature nukes?  
---
Want a class that can solo dungeon content for specific gear and mat farming?  
---
Want to be a furry?  
---
Look no further.
---
Infected Mushroom - Suliman
---
he was MT on bosses in AQ40, in naxx he only MT:ed gluth, i said we had him tank on  patchwerk and KT.
---
Coolio (we used to say that in 04)
---
Love seeing these screenshots. I don't have any and I even don't remember taking any, wish I had... We were pretty good on alliance, top 3 on server through vanilla and TBC. Good times!
---
I‚Äôd like to see them explain then why vanilla was the highest growth the game has seen and why nostalrius had a high retention rate and was growing.

```Goal-driven adult gamers, just like many of you. Many of us are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers. We love our hobby and love accomplishing our goal with friends. Many of us play nightly while others play casually. We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.```
---
```To raid successfully, of course. 
---
To experience Classic wow all over again and to fully enjoy being back in the game that brought so many of us to this genre.

Our core members have been gaming together for years and come from a guild that cleared everything up to early Naxx in vanilla. 
---
We are looking to raid twice a week (3 hours per night) with the goal of clearing everything the game has to offer.```

**What we are looking for:**
---
```Adult gamers driven by a passion to succeed.

**Goal:**
---
```Kill lots of bosses.
---
Make some new friends.
---
Make a lot of new memories and relive some old ones.
---
Make no mistake about it. We are in this for the long haul. We plan to clear every bit of content Blizzard can throw at us.

Fuck they meant Australian summer
---
Thanks this is exactly the information I'm eager to know. I might even have to reword my question a bit. The question would not only be if they limit the api to match the wow vanilla api but also if they extend the api to allow addons like decursive to work. I however doubt that point quite a bit because of the possibility of automating a lot of the game.
---
We're unsure until we get closer to release. For retail we do 8:30pm EST. It'll be in that ballpark.
---

&gt;Will old Addons work in Classic WoW?
---
If you mean will the exact same add ons work?  No they will not, they're using a modified version of the modern API.  However pretty much every add on in vanilla(UI mods, timers, map coords, quest helpers, etc...) has some modern equivalent other than mods like decursive which flat out automated things.  So you should be able to get pretty much at least as much functionality out of mods as you did in vanilla.
---
Yes they said they'd be removing some functionality from it, how much we don't know, they specifically mentioned things that would allow LFG to be recreated.
---
Yeah the thread as a whole was beginning to get off track a bit some I figured i'd throw out a replacement talent haha. I like the idea of an aoe disorient! I feel like it could be a bit overpowered depending on team comp (like disorient an enemy healer and have your possy of casters blow him up..) but I could imagine is being a bit more universal. Both enemies and allies get disoriented, can't target, zero visability, AND can't be targeted. Essentially you'd just be able to silence/remove someone temporarily from the fight. It would be rad with class fantasy too... neat idea!
---
unforunately until either the Open Beta or they release some documentation ahead of time for add-on makers, we don't really know anything.
---
All we've heard is that they're trying to make sure it's as close to classic as possible, but are going to crack down on some of the biggest offenders in terms of extreme levels of automation that were a thing in classic, were removed in later expansions as simply being too close to botting.
---
Believe it or not, you're discussing it.
---
ah yes, must be hard carrying around that massive bag full of gold
---
They got a LOT wrong - including racials lol
---
They talked about it earlier in the video I posted above at 42:00. They won't allow decursive and other automation addons.
---
If classic is a success (it very likely will be) then I can definitely see them releasing TBC &amp; WOTLK realms with paid transfer from Vanilla to TBC to Wotlk. Letting people complete the expansions in their own pace and making some good money on transfers / subs meanwhile. 
---
It could be a constant trickle of income for them requiring mostly maintenance and GMs. Heres hoping.
---
This is the first time I've heard of the click to move shit, sounds like a hassle unless you've truly mastered that way of playing, IIRC that wasn't added until korea basically demanded for it or something like that.     
---
  By far the best "pro trick" you can have, above everything else, is inform yourself and be willing to learn.  
---
  This trumps everything else and at the same time, encapsulates it, informing yourself will always tell you what you're doing wrong, what you should be doing, how to improve, etc.  
---
   The only difference between bad and good players is the ability to learn and adapt.
---
What do you guys think would be a good charge amount for food/water assuming you‚Äôre not about to raid/do a dungeon with someone ?
---
fuck sharding
---
The got the Orc Hardiness racial wrong... Everything thinks it is 25% stun resist because of Nost
---
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
---
You could have left out the name itself but some markers for 'selfies and Twitter' and '5M unsubs' might have been fun. :)
---
They thought we didn't, but we do.
---
Love the font!
---
A lot of more mainstream black metal, since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd throw on while leveling. Dissection, Emperor, Dark Funeral - anytime I listen to these guys I end up reminiscing about how nice it was to game as a teenager.
---
Sorry, I hand out raid DPS. When I go to BG I treat the enemy as trash mobs. 
---
I suck at PVP.
---
:sunrise_over_mountains:&lt;Lakesh√≠re Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance) (Maybe RP-PVP, Guild Vote):sunrise_over_mountains:
---
What is Lakesh√≠re Guard?
---
Lakesh√≠re Guard is a moderate to hardcore raiding guild with strong PVP ties to Lakeshire and the Redridge Mountains! Though we aren't RPPVP we do immerse ourselves to do what it takes to defend Lakeshire, and maintain a fairly serious attitude about raiding and our strategies as a guild.
---
We don't want to exclude any players from progressing so these raid swaps and off groups will only be for progression weeks, months. We want to be as fair and fun to everyone within our Guard! If someone else gets the loot, remember they are a Guard, and what they get benefits Lakesh√≠re and all of our members.

On hyjal we had 1 alliance guild that had AQ on farm status and they weren't progressing in Naxx. I'm less familiar with the status of the horde side but from what it remember they had 2 guilds working on naxx.
---
Your server was indeed 'baller.'
---
Reading this sub you'd think every single class will be popular this time lmao
---
I know for me it will take me about 150 hours to hit 60, and you do more than raiding at 60! So I can‚Äôt wait being flexible
---
Orange ma-
---
what's Stand?  Like Last Stand for the whole group?
---
You could do it like the controller add-on maybe

Hi, /u/Kidcuddz

Arcane Power now applies to the whole raid.
---
[NA] [Horde] [Any Server Type]
---
Hunter LF Raiding Guild
---
I am an experienced (12 years) World of Warcraft player with raiding experience on retail as well as private servers, but Vanilla end game will be new to me. I have nothing but time to dedicate to Classic and am looking for a guild that is serious about progression raiding. 
---
Unfortunately my schedule is a bit odd. My available raid times are weeknights after 11:45 PM Central, and any time on weekends. If you think I'd make a good fit for your guild please feel free to send me a PM with more information about your guild or to direct me where to apply. Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
---
How are the leveling guides not suitable for classic? I dont know what you are talking about.
---
That is what classic wows about?? Go stream on a pve server than you stupid cunt
---
Hah true. But the polls also support the argument that shaman will be second or third most popular class on horde
---
As it should be.
---
8.2 is gonna be releasing around june.   
---
  They're not gonna do a classic summer and release in late september, july is the perfect date for many reasons such as the start of Q3 and having content during bfa droughts.  
---
  Not to mention the good old tease, which was so obvious and coincides with literally every piece of info that I doubt it wasn't intended.
---
So the issue isn't so much that druids can't do certain things outside of raid tanking(they can't get rid of crushing blows)  The bigger issue is that other classes do things better in terms of DPS and most of the time tanking as well.  The end result of that is that druids largely end up pigeon holed into healing.
---
Terrible itemization for feral before AQ really doesn't help either.
---
This is the average person in this sub. Desperately trying to poke holes in private servers and show how "they are so wrong". I think deep down, they hate that people on private servers are going to have more experience and know the game better. They greedily want to start on an even playing field as people who have been playing this game for years.  They also somehow want to be good at the game but not put any effort into grinding consumes, playing proper specs. I think this is actually something carrying over from retail.  The hate for private servers has nothing to do with the health of the game or balance or anything.  Its just selfish greed/envy/denial.
---
Indeed I did, basically read comments first only talking about ineffectiveness of the spec (not true, different playstyles).
---
But, while there isn't really such a thing as a Pre-Rank-12-BIS, you could use a list such as [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPdLlYapExIY7QuzTtBN3neO8YDaQBslUKKR1giaEQE/pubhtml#), then go down it while mixing and matching based on what role you want to take per encounter:
---
* "I want to run flags efficiently as possible" - Need a mix of stamina, int, +heal, leather-mainly
---
* "I want to sneaky cat DPS" - Probably only need rogue'esque gear
---
* "I want to do effective healing from afar" - Probably only need +healing/+int, cloth / leather
---
Hope this helps.

&gt; Can I register a domain names containing some portion of your product names such as "star-craft.com" or "war-craft.com?"
---
No. We are concerned that such use could cause confusion for our customers who may assume that the domain is associated with Blizzard Entertainment¬Æ.
---
[source](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/legal-faq.html)
---
I think using "wow" is fine, but "warcraft" or "worldofwarcraft" is not. I doubt they care though, unless your site is for profit/commercial.
---
Click to move works on my PC but not on my laptop. No idea why.
---
That demon summoning "bug" is a perfect example against your point because sure it was a bit wrong on private servers, but ultimately it didnt really affect gameplay in the slightest. It doesn't feel like a "fresh" game because of a fcking pet staying out while it gets summoned or whatever.
---
True, but when we're talking Naxx and C'Thun, we're probably not talking about slackers as much.
---
Basically any song you could find in Grim's Total Annihilation video
---
If you're going to do that you don't even need innervate, just change  druid's regen from spirit denominator from 5 to 1.25 and make them always oo5sr.
---
Sweet works like a charm! Ty
---
Makes sense, I guess I was always choosing succubus no matter what cause destro and just prefer infinite sleep over felhunt
---
I mean yeah it kinda does since if a rogue kills you in WSG using wotf chances are next time you see him it‚Äôll be backup again.
---
If anything, they will see what people gravitate towards in-game and use those metrics to tune D4.
---
Assuming you get into a shaman's grp is not gonna happen it's rare they will always go into rogues/warriors grp. However alliance locks will get it 99% of the time. This makes threat items/set more valuable on horde and less for alliance.
---
I feel like I just lived thru your character, thanks for sharing lol
---
Stoneform will help you  way more in a battle against a rogue but shadowmeld can let you have a bit more fun and do some sneaky stuff, also shadowmeld while eat/drink is a nice benefit.
---
You definitely need the threat talents for Righteous Fury. Remember this is ONLY holy damage and your holy damage doesnt scale especially well until you get AQ-level spellpower gear. 
---
Imp Devo Aura is basically for healer paladins to take to help reduce damage in raids. When tanking as a prot paladin you want to be using Retribution Aura in the most part, as this is another source of holy damage and threat.
---
Late to the party but I haven‚Äôt personally seen too much actual flame towards hardcore players at all. The only real flame that I have seen is directed at the players saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to rush 60 and then camp starting zones until people quit so that noobs can understand who really belongs in World of Warcraft *flexes*.‚Äù In which case I feel like the flame is deserved because purposely griefing new low level players in the name of ‚Äútrue PvP‚Äù is idiotic.
---
I would have expected that back then to some degree as well, but I mostly cede your point. It's all out there now and has been fine tuned. To get the true, organic experience, all raid members would need to be on the same page and that's probably highly unlikely this time around.
---
How did you do it? Please let me know
---
So... running away from essentially free money?
---
Prophet doesn't hit all that hard, so of course a druid can tank that. Same with Fankriss.
---
Tanking a couple easy bosses in AQ =/= "bear tanks are MT viable guise!!". Stop spreading misinformation.
---
If we are talking about level 60 holy pally, no. Holy Paladins have the highest sustain of all healers in vanilla due to Crits refunding 100% of the mana cost. 
---
So it's healing, spell crit, and int that you stack. It's 29 int for a crit. Mp/5 while not bad, shouldn't be a prio whatsoever.

---
I also plan to play Hunter but I'll choose NE. 
---
I used to play one in classic and in wPvP it was bonkers! Yes there were times I was angry I didn't roll Dwarf (especially during fights with rogues :P ) but overall I value shadowmeld over stoneform. Here is why:
---
- it saved my life more times than stoneform would have ... feign death + shadowmeld if positioned well is OP ... and feign death + invisibility potion + run and than + shadowmeld + eat ... OP OP OP 
---
- ambushes (shadowmeld + aimed shot ... mmmm ...  SSSOOOO SATISFYING ]:-&gt; ) 
---
- eat/drink in stealth
---
- BG object defending in stealth ... attack capturing rogue from stealth ... mmm revenge! :)
---
Priest. My favorite thing to do is heal dungeons, and Id like to consider myself pretty decent at it. The only downside is the leveling rotation can be pretty bland. Shield, sw:p, mind flay, mind flay, wand repeat can get kind of boring after a while
---
The fastest strategies for some classes like frontshredding, frontstabbing won't be in.
---
Jury is still out on recknoning level, but it looks silly enough not to be a thing. Anyway if so that would be 3/9 classes already and I haven't looked up the rest
---
It was too much like mortal strike.  But the seal system does kind of lack.  I guess they could've had both worlds and left it in but on a longer cd, like storm strike.
---
No doubt I'm going to have to remind my healer to wand like she means it during downtime.
---
im not spreading miss information, you said, and i quote again,   **" - Bears are only good for off-tanking trash/adds, they cannot function as MT. "**   
---
That is what im arguing, not how well they can do it. And where.
---
I heard that Sanctity Aura doesnt affect the damage of Seal of Command procs, only the judgement, and that for PvP you'll generally want to use imp Ret Aura though.
---
I havent been able to verify.
---
Fem dwarf check out the different hair. Pigtails spin when casting, so does the braid.
---
I enjoy how WoD was not even acknowledged.
---
But it's likely that addons has to be rewritten/altered. It's also somewhat likely that addon developers will have a headstart on us, so we will have something on launch, not perfect but something.
---
I never knew that.......
---
what tease? Asking as I have been out of the loop
---
Sure they can MT. Just like Paladins can MT.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's a good idea.
---
why do people say hunters fall off?  they scale hard with crit and agility, seems good to me just like rogues
---
The picture #5, describes Vanilla (WoW, old wow specifically) in such a good way. Old wow had a sense of a long journey and an adventure, you first stumbled into the dungeon, or a new zone and found new great things. Just reading the chat, "DUde, it's a freaking rock concert!"
---
"holy shit" "we're fucked" etc, not knowing what'll happen or show up.
---
On retail, you walk in there not giving a fuck looking at the monitor just cleaving everything down and being spamhealed without going oom. Shit was great.
---
Just pointing out I like melee. Would go fury probably (maybe rogue, but eh). I have zero desire to go ret in vanilla... my one vanilla ret was a level 19 twink and even that was underwhelming.
---
&gt;Both enemies and allies get disoriented
---
Yeah, I was thinking just that, so if a group melee was going against your side you could toss it on all of em like a bucket of water on fighting dogs and they'd just have to reset the whole fight.
---
I swap to DW when fighting mobs or bosses that do spell damage, armor and block don't do much at that point.
---
last time i played on a pserver i rolled druid and i loved the leveling process.  there was a time in SFK when we were in the stables or whatever, fighting those undead wolves on the narrow walkways.  The server was a little buggy in that spot and we kept pulling like 3 groups instead of 1
---
me and my friend (druid + warrior) just happened to be teamed up with a really good priest, and we managed too clear the fight even though it took forever.  I shifted forms to help heal as well as tank.
---
we did pretty much every dungeon with that same priest up to 60!
---
Mobs can't daze you if you're facing them? That's news for me.
---
Thanks for the advice :) Perhaps I'll create my own Bis list for that spec spending a few hours on classicdb:)
---
Weirdly enough, Muse. Was in so many PvP videos.

Sign Off:

Jump into our Discord if you're interested - https://discord.gg/kxTzFd4
---
This reminds me of the Level 1 Tauren raid on Stormwind that was organized by a streamer (Swifty, iirc)
---
1g seems to be the default tip for anything mage related. I normally would just ask for whatever they thought was fair and it worked out. If they give you a gold though, be sure to give them more than 1 stack. But watch out for the farmers who will try and get 20 stacks for free.
---
Paladin MT ? I want to see that. That is very new to me. You have a video or a source ?  
---
And what do you mean **" -  Just because you can do something doesn't mean it's a good idea. "** Druid tank was the reason we downed Fankriss, and gluth, we swapping our TF tank to just deal with the adds comming from the holes on the side of Fankriss. and TF on adds to gluth was the reason we killed it.  
---
So no im not buying that argument at all, him tanking it, was the reason we could progress past those fights.
---
I go back there every once in a while to remind myself of the excitement I felt at the announcement. Thinking about it still gives me chills.
---
 **&lt;TBD&gt; {Alliance PvP} {West Coast Semi-Hardcore} {LC}**    
---
**What are our goals?**   
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner.

We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.    
---
We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged. We plan to start premades when the first BG's are released.    
---
**Why should you join us?**

Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel‚ÄôThuzad before TBC was released. Our guild will have competitive raid spots and as such this will foster a guild that will excel at all aspects of Classic.

**&lt;Credendum&gt;** **EU \[PvP\] | Alliance**
---
*Are  you from Norway or Sweden? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children?  Career? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious  guild without any obligations.*
---
**Guild Information:**  Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who‚Äôve  matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities.  Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids,  going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your  microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept.  Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other  way around. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week,  there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be  hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature  individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We  probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the  kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace  that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members.  There will also be a signifcant amount of PvP with premade guild groups.  Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.
---
**What we expect from our members:**  In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want  it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more  "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully  prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected  to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if  you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like  Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.

Just keep an eye out for dirtylarry

I've been going through the same dilemma as I want to level as tank/healer hybrid. I leveled a druid to 60 on a pserver and play 0/30/21 spec but have discovered their endgame healing in raids is mediocre at best compared to other classes. However, their tanking actually seems quite good in dungeons and smaller raids.  Not on the same level as a warrior level but above paladin for sure.  
---
Druid pros:
---
- Faster/easier solo leveling than paladin.  Stealth helps immensely.
---
- Better endgame tanks (although not good enough for 40 man raids still, unless you are supremely dedicated).  You can tank stuff like DM:T and UBRS 10man quite well.  
---
- More versatile than paladins...4 playstyles in one class.  
---
Druid cons: 
---
- 30min cd on res so if you're the only healer in a dungeon you better not let more than 1 person die every 30 min.  
---
- Some people are anti-druid bias and won't let you in their group no matter how good/geared you are (personally, this is actually super frustrating and shouldn't be understated)
---
Paladin pros:
---
- Arguably the best healing class for endgame raiding.  
---
Paladin cons: 
---
- You have a mana bar and no taunt as a tank.  This can lead to slow dungeons and your dps need to be extra careful.  If you have an impatient person in your group they might die a lot.  
---
- One of the worst leveling classes in the game (still not as bad as warrior).  It will be slow and monotonous.  Get a second monitor to watch youtube or netflix.  
---
Overall, I'm more endgame than leveling focused so for me it comes down to two main points.  At 60, druids are average at tanking and mediocre at healing/dps.  They don't have any role they really excel at and are therefore shunned by hardcore players.  This is not a big deal if you want to play casually but could be a big deal if you intend to progress with the top players.  Paladins do not have this problem endgame as they are highly desired healers, and therefore it's easier to find a group.  
---
Personally, I'm going to main a paladin so when I eventually get to 60 I won't have an issue getting into groups.  I'm also going to alt a druid with my casual friends who probably won't make it to 60 and that's OK, because leveling on a druid is more fun than endgame to me.
---
Google Osconty july, they showed these in the classic pannel last blizzcon.   
---
  Basically a tinfoily theory, until you look at how obvious it actually is and how it fits perfectly with everything, from it being a tuesday to q3 start to about a month after 8.2 hitting, classic summer, etc.
---
Shaman has too many keybindings. Thats one off your list :)
---
Forsure, appreciate the response!
---
Yeah C'thun is one of the hardest encounters in vanilla.
---
Druid. Because I like surviving and having many decent abilities at my disposal rather than have a few powerful spells I‚Äôll keep pressing everywhere.
---
Because I have instant-cast HOTs I can apply to myself and continue battling. Because having 3 different damage forms I can essentially attack in one the form that is best suited for the situation while letting mana regen. And finally, because having so many situational abilities gives you the chance to pull things off that would stump other players because they knew you had those abilities but had no idea that you could cleverly combine them or use them in such an unconventional way to win the fight or escape.
---
But they already have auras, the buffs just aren't as badass as totem buffs because paladins also have blessings.
---
I love it. Not to mention the endless trolling opportunities outside of combat.....
---
If you want to play one of those classes or specs and you want to raid endgame, make friends. Make a guild. When you have friends, they're less likely to strictly scrutinize your specific class and spec then a random pug.
---
A handful of mobs can use shield bash or what ever to daze you, but pretty much everything that uses physical attacks has a decent chance to daze you if they get you from behind.
---
&gt;I'm not saying the toggle doesn't force the point. However jumping down people's throats like you have done, every time the suggest something in a community led project is the whole reason WoW is so Toxic! You have the right to argue one point, other people have the right to argue there's.
---
If you consider me disagreeing with you jumping down your throat I wouldn't really know how to answer that. Your initial post made the position clear and I disagreed with it.
---
&gt; There are VERY few videos that talk about the graphics of WoW (other  than a select few) and rather most focus on its gameplay/community  aspects. Neither of which will change by someone toggling their settings  to a higher graphic template. Equally, you will NEVER even know what  people see your character as, because it's not like your walking around  the world with signs above people's heads saying I'm seeing you in 7.2
---
Apart from your character not looking as you intend and having no control over that, by virtue of the fact there is a toggle, we know this, it changes your character from a model made in the 2004 era of Warcraft which is entirely different to the one of 2015 made by entirely different artists, with an artstyle that has evolved over a period of 11+ years, thus looking fundamentally different to how you have made it. 
---
&gt; And it's not Nazi due to being a disagreeing party. It's Nazi to which  the manor people respond to points, critics and recommendations. Seeing  as you clearly thing the term Nazi in a metaphorical sense means someone  murders people, then there's no point arguing this point any further.  Clearly it is a result of cultural differences, and you thinking writing  big words in long sentences changes the basis of a metaphor or will  change the context of which I used it. Then I guess it's a stalemate  because I couldn't care less how you've taken it, after I've explained  how it was used. Your right to disagree with it though, as I'm sure you  will continue to. /Done 
---
Where I'm from when we wish to make salient points we present arguments rather than compare a group of people to an easily dismissed stereotypes or try to portray them as unreasonable for either having principles or view points that don't coinside with our own, just because they do not agree with our views. Particularly if it comes down to someone that murdered men, women and children en masse like they were cattle. 'Cultural differences' shouldn't mean much but I guess where you are from, this is a common, accepted talking point. The general belief where I am from is that when you compare someone with such exaggeration to a historical figure of such evil, it diminishes their sins.
---
&gt;The hilarious thing about this whole argument is the fact that I  personally don't plan to use New models if they are implemented. I'm  just tired of people quashing ideas under a boot because it doesn't suit  what they believe they should be getting. I'd rather have a community  that inclusive and happy that EVEN if their requests for tokens and  other cash shop madness is misplaced or destructive that they are  educated, not dictated to. 
---
While I understand what you saying I don't believe I dictated, I made why I feel the idea is a flawed one and explained my reasoning. Inclusivity and happiness, while admirable goals shouldn't mean that all other virtues or views are worthless in my opinion. Apathy and tolerance are in my opinion not what should be behind the driving goals of a project. You don't agree with Ion but I do, that's what it boils down to. His quote's whether they be of a man waking from a coma to notice no differences aside from the technical (computer screen) or outright stating historical recreation are the driving goals behind the team. 
---
&gt; You can quote Ion all you want, but it was the people's voice that got  us Classic. People you trying to silence opinions or ignoring them  completly is how we got retail. 
---
That I would disagree with. I am not in any way mod. I have not silenced you otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation in the first place. What I take issue with is that there is reasonable opposition with points of view. Instead of arguing out these points, people here seem to be painting a group of people, who ever they may be, as a convenient stereotype to be dismissed rather than actually have the balls to address them because the arguement is far more nuanced than they would otherwise give credit.
---
&gt; I think we are just going around in circles here, in a fairly pointless  debate that neither of us will agree on. New graphics don't affect my  gameplay experiencewhat so ever but if allowing someone to make their  Lightning Bolt look like a lightning bolt rather than a lightning ball  makes people happy, increases the player base and the longevity of the  game then all the power too them. As long as it doesn't affect how I see  things on my own screen then I couldn't care less, I couldn't care less  how someone sees my character. That's like complaining about colour  blind mode making your armour a different shade on someone else's  screen. 
---
We won't agree, you are of the opinion that the player having no control over how they are presented in an MMORPG is of no importance as long as other people are happy. I am of the opinion this is inherently flawed reasoning because one of the major importances of an MMORPG is how you the player, are percieved, this is a social, community based game. Players having control over how their avatar looks is of the utmost importance to many, perhaps you don't care and that is fine but there are others who do, we know for fact it affects the social dynamics. We aren't playing amphorous indistinguishable blobs. Whether it is the observable fact of the jokes made about dwarf rape face which is often mentioned in the WoW classic discord or the visual style of the character itself.
---
&gt; That's my stance and I feel that there is no reason to reply here anymore. 
---
You do you, I like to make my thoughts known and I often try to present what I think is reasonable. I always respond as if the devs, per chance, are watching. Just incase. A pleasant evening to you.
---
This.
---
Ye you never want to keyboard turn, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to rebind A and D or Q and E to something else. That's really just a matter of preference.  
---
I wouldn't call it "pro" tricks, but rather just basic tips to become better and that is:  
---
1. Learn and understand the strengths and weaknesses of all classes (most important being your own class obviously).
---
2. Utilize macros and addons to simplify your gameplay as much as possible.
---
3. Use keybinds for everything (and I mean everything).
---
4. Learn your keybinds and be comfortable with them (this will take some time).
---
5. Get engineering as it allows the use of grenades and other useful items for PvP.
---
6. As for PvE I'd suggest that you lookup different guides for your class on how to min-max as much as possible (could do this for PvP too, tbh).
---
7. For PvE you must also learn a proper rotation and learn to manage your threat.
---
8. You must learn the do's and don'ts in raids such as not using Rend if you are a warrior, and remember to remove enrage effects if you are a hunter.   
---
Pro tricks would be something like (and this is really just learning by doing):
---
1. Master the use of items such as trinkets, grenades, "gadgets" such as skull of impending doom, mindcontrol cap etc (this is mostly for PvP).
---
2. Learn to predict your opponents moves as much as possible while being unpredictable yourself.
---
3. Master the use of your crowd controls (if you got any). Which leads to...
---
4. Depending on how high the skill cap of your class is you COULD learn to manage multiple opponents in 1vX scenarios. (This is more difficult for some classes than others).
---
5. There are certain do's and don'ts in PvP aswell, however they are a lot more situational and are mostly tied to competitive play in bgs.
---
6. When playing competitive or in group pvp, you must learn to sometimes sacrifice yourself for your team, for example eating a hunter trap for a team member or intercepting a group of enemies that are chasing a dying team member etc.  
---
All of this is obviously easier said than done, and to become an actual professional player theres a lot more to it than just these few things here. For example you need to have good muscle memory, quick reactions and be able to think quick etc.  
---
If anyone got anything to add, feel free to do so or if you disagree with something, I'd love to hear why. Cheers.

we are warriors - freedom call (pat PVP)
---
breaking my down - soil (pat PVP)
---
downfall - children of bodom (maydie)
---
triple corpse hammerblow - children of bodom (burn #4 i think?)
---
dawn of victory - rhapsody (burn pvp again)
---
that really annoying 'requiem for a dream' thing - about 200 different pvp videos.  i cant stand it
---
my michelle - GnR (world of roguecraft i think?)
---
duke nukem theme - megadeth (perkulator?)
---
WHAT IS LOVE - haddaway (perkulator)  
---
if you haven't seen the perkulator then watch this duel with the pala around 11 mins.  there's something beautiful about it [here](https://youtu.be/ID192rw5Whw?t=668)
---
Whenever I see old vanilla pvp videos of enhance shaman one-shotting people the amount of backpedalling, keyboard turning clothies they find make me realize *that's* why everyone thought it was good.
---
i see Dissection i upvote
---
Definitely rolling priest first. Hoping there are some late night guild members that like running leveling dungeons because that's where I'll be when I'm not super efficiently leveling
---
I'd like to level with a warrior but unless that person no lifes it, I'll out level them pretty quickly. Warrior has to be the slowest class to level
---
I believe when he says click to move he means holding bolt mouse buttons to move forward, not like diablo click to move (which I think was an option in the settings for WoW)
---
I don't know that you're "supposed" to click to move by any means. I know I use it very situationally. My W key is move forward, which I use my middle finger to press. If I'm using an ability that requires my middle finger, I can't use it to also press W, so if I need to press one of those buttons and also move forward, I use the mouse buttons to move forward. Generally I try to bind any key I use my middle finger for to abilities I wouldn't need to use while moving to avoid this, but every once in a while it comes up.
---
Oh you were serious. lmfao
---
We thought they, didn't but we.
---
It was a half joke but the kernel of truth is people who want spell batching want lag back.  Spell batching was in the game because the server had to moderate lag and level the field for high vs low latency players.
---
Same, I lost thousands of screenshots when I moved and left my old pc behind. I will be screenshoting everything and putting a scrapbooking caption in my chat box
---
As a pally at least you have the option to say fuck it and don proper armor like the knight you are.
---
As a priest you don't. Might not sound like that a big deal but when I rolled a priest that definitely got to me, not going to main one during Classic.
---
No hunter deadzone -&gt; attack with your melee weapon while your range weapon is on CD
---
Also worth mentioning is the Alliance‚Äôs additional defensive dispel (paladins) and fear ward largely offsets - and arguably surpasses - the Horde‚Äôs WotF counter to warlock fear
---
My only objective for my upcoming guild is to bring back all friends and friends of friends, new and old, collect them on the same server, faction and guild. Seeing as classic wow will not be rocket surgery but more for the journey, I'm open to anyone and everyone joining as long as they're cool.
---
Do I think everyone I've assembled so far will get to 60 or even play? No, but that doesn't matter. Eventually we get enough people to fill raids
---
Dropping it in the AH so everyone's auction windows close
---
&gt; (you must jump when entering an instance portal)
---
I'd say you were wrong, but I've never actually tried not jumping to be able to argue otherwise. :P
---
No truer words have ever been spoken. Since huntards were/are/will always be a thing a well played hunter shines like a lighthouse in dark, storm tossed seas
---
I dunno, Im quite capable of min maxing my characters performance, but not feeling like I need to be on the daily points train.
---
I like CSGO over Battlefield, where i have to unlock my guns in a persistent way. I like dota over heroes of the storm in that dota gives you access to all the characters right away. Playing the game should be about the good gameplay, not the meta game reward system.
---
Will i keyboard turn and beckpedal? god i hope not. But ill engage in hours of pointless pvp while I level, merely cause killing--or having the chance to be killed by--the other faction is fun. Will I respond to the incentives in game? absolutely, but I quit retail wow cause the process for obtaining my rewards was boring, easy and repetitive and didnt excite me beyond the end reward. The process of play is much more enjoyable here--regardless of the incentive scheme for doing things.
---
If you make sure you are the best Shadow priest in your guild and you cultivate friendships in your guild you won't have a problem getting in the classic raid
---
Just remember to get to the front of the raid after every fight, recast your totems, then start drinking.  That way your group can start the fight with totems that are in range and you can drink in a safe spot and not have to worry about patrols walking over your old totems.
---
WASD to move/strafe is the most common way of doing things. Some people remove backpedal from S so they can use it for another hotkey, some prefer ESDF.
---
The biggest protips I can think of are to use hotkeys for everything you'd have to do in combat. When you bind your hotkeys make it so your main cooldowns are near the center of your screen on the upper actionbars for easy visibility (assuming no addons). Shit like conjuring water, buffs or applying poisons you can probably click from the side bar. If you play a ranged class learn how to 180 jumpshot instant abilities to assist with kiting.
---
We don't know what the addon situation will look like but when we're able to, move yours and your target healthbars to the lower center of the screen. You want to keep your eyes on the game, not flicking around to the corners of the screen.
---
Sure, it's slightly irrelevant to your point, but I've seen many posts on this subreddit that Questie better be in shortly after launch. It makes questing mindless and unimmersive just like it does on retail where you stare at your minimap being told where to go.
---
10 years of wow and people are still terrible players amazing
---
It's not going to be any more difficult to find a full 40 now than it was then. SPriest is fairly universally unwanted. Like you said,  maybe 1 for the debuff. There is one fight in Naxx that requires 2 or 3 or something, Razuvius. We would literally stop at the pull, send the priests out, have them respec, then summon them back. Or do him first with them already shadow, then have them respect after.
---
&gt; pummelers
---
Judging by the drop rate, isn't getting one something you can farm in an afternoon?
---
I do 1g for portals and 1g for 100 food/water(total). When DM comes out for the first week you can charge much more like 3g per 100 water since everyone wants it.
---
I played on the last 2 big PSer I feel like alot of people forget how annoying playing a mage can be.
---
While leveling every person who is near you wants free food/water
---
Have only an hour to log in and play well good luck ignoring all the PMs and getting called every name in the book.
---
Want to BG? Better make 500 water between each game since everyone on you team with a mana bar will ask for alot.
---
Trying to go through a major city good luck having trade windows just opened in your face and mass wispers.
---
When you need gold being a mage is amazing but alot of times when you just want to log on and play you have to ignore everyone and take the harassment.
---
Man upright Orcs are the bomb though
---
The two people dueling outside Org? Yeah they're gonna have a bad time lol
---
What about the alliance having an additional dispel from paladins and fear ward?
---
It doesn't imply any likelihood of being wrong, you can guess *correctly* after all.
---
youre right. The final launch build was put up on 1/9/07, we got access on 1/16/07. The prepatch, with balance and talents and such, came on 12/5/06.
---
Looks great!
---
It‚Äôs already happening with certain things, such as ability procs from crits - like pallies stacking reckoning charges via a /sit macro - this works in private servers but is actually not in the original 1.12. Just one example, I‚Äôm sure there are others.
---
Guild tend to like shadowpriest that PVP, and aim to gearing them selfs as good as the can. In guilds ive played with usually ends up beeing the high ranked pvp shadowpriest who gets the spot.  
---
But this ofc aint true for all guilds, but it will def help you to secure a spot.
---
Except this was unorganized.  Servers were down so everyone logged into the other servers and created characters and just made it happen!  There was no voice chat, streaming, or anything.
---
Hah. We would call people up, but realized it was easier to just share login details. So we'd have ~20 people playing 40 accounts for the world raid bosses. I think my record was 4 accounts at once.
---
This is the dumbest hot take I‚Äôve seen on here yet.
---
where can i apply for a guild anyway
---
i have vanilla xp up to naxx
---
ummmm achkshually if u check the skull sizes of orcs
---
Bloodseeker from AV quest. I strictly pvpd in vanilla on my hunter and got R11. I used this bow the entire time against raiding hunters and it felt equivalent. 
---
I was of course a little envious of the raid items but I didn‚Äôt feel that I needed them or was disadvantaged.
---
Can we infer from this that add ons won't be available on day 1? 
---
And if not do you know what kind of timeline we could be looking at?
---
I loled
---
Its more of a game than any of the 8 expansions.
---
Imagine instead of a tbc server we get a continuation of vanilla?? Like instead if expansions we get an expanded classic, like karahzan ofc and maybe completely new raids that still take place in normal azeroth. That sounds cooler then tbc servers (id still want a couple normal classic servers tho)
---
This post gave me a full release. Not really. Just wanted to get that play on words in there.
---
Spicy post, m8. 8/8
---
Kind of like Princess on K3. It was much much harder to solo her on the Pserver because she constantly threw rocks non stop.
---
**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Update:** I have teamed up with a former guild leader from the server, Aegwynn. He is recruiting, alongside me. We still need many more players.
---
We are currently playing on vanilla servers. DM me if you would like to get your vanilla fix, and hang out, before Classic drops! **Come join us!**
---
Also your pet druid pisses off other druids because it rolls on druid gear. Totally in the spirit of the hunter class.
---
True but the spell batching will help with massive world PVP.
---
Rage is far more important than just dps...
---
Because in practice they don't scale half as well as the other dps classes and so they do fall off pretty hard post BWL. 
---
I'm sure somebody else could explain better than me "why" this is exactly but I know some of it has to do with your pet not scaling at all, it does the same dmg whether your a fresh 60 or fully t3 and they don't have as many instant attacks as the other physical dps has.
---
Really enjoy seeing your warlock progressing! Thank you for taking me on this journey!
---
Paul Stanley- Live to Win
---
is that a netherweave bag?
---
Aspect of the cheetah no longer dazes
---
Yes we can! But should we?
---
I plan on doing a good bit of pvp. Im also working on putting together a pre raid bis list that focuses +shadow damage and +spellpower. I also know i will have similar if not worse mana issues than boomkins so im also looking at mp5 gear without sacrificing too much spellpower.
---
Used to love watching Oxhorns videos back in the day.
---
Yeah but he's a hunter.
---
Having a group with Threat Meters is so good for this. Having an active reference to how close people are to pulling threat and being able to decide whether or not you need to use that sunder armor or not is invaluable.
---
Eh. I'm not big by any means, 10-20 viewers usually right now. 
---
If I gain a follow / viewer rise by the time launch happens and it turns into a big deal I can look at delayed streaming by like 10-15 minutes I guess.
---
The first 36 hours of launch I plan on hitting 30ish, before that I don't think ill have any issue anyways.
---
This is exactly right. 100%. Classic is not the same as another Warcraft expansion, they're not expecting new expansion numbers for classic, and the time between release date announcement and the release date will reflect that.
---
I'd have liked the ability if it functioned like it did when BC was released, but its original design was functionally identical to mortal strike, which is one of the most boring abilities in the game.
---
I still wonder whether we will have a beta.  What do they really need us to test?  They have all the info and are just porting it forward, and they can run the in house alpha with everyone in GM mode to make sure everything works.  
---
I fear that if they open it up for a beta all they will get is a bunch of people complaining about things that they simply remember wrong.  Remember warlock pet summoning?  So many people were absolutely positive Blizzard got it wrong.  The amount of players who claim to have a savant-level memory of a game they played 14 years ago is crazy to me.
---
If you want to world pvp, it is such a good choice.
---
- You have the space to kite, along with the time since there aren't objectives to worry about
---
- You can not only track other players, but you can prevent yourself from being tracked by other hunters and druids. You'll get the jump on all of the classes that give you your hardest matchups.
---
- You can get rid of mob aggro easily. I've won many fights just kiting while mobs did the heavy lifting for me
---
- You have the furthest range in the game
---
- You are equally good in group and solo pvp. Solo? Get good at kiting and draining. In a group? Protect healers from rogues, use frost traps with entrapment for the best group cc in the game. Burst clothies down.
---
Sounds like you were offended by the implication that is single patch is somehow less than or lower quality or worse than any full expansion. Except that you and me and everyone else know that there are individual patches in Warcraft history that are light years better than full expansions of Warcraft.
---
Some of these ‚Äúterms‚Äù are really more like Blizzard preferences. I see no way Blizzard could prevent you from making a website called ‚ÄúWarcraft-has-gone-to-shit.com‚Äù, for example, even if you use that website for some commercial purpose.
---
Until you get some gear you may need to run Power Infusion + shadow weaving depending on how progression oriented a guild you join.
---
I remember DM being deadmines because dire maul didn't exist.
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
That feeling when the "Classic patch" is better than every full release expansion post-Wrath.
---
I don‚Äôt get offended
---
Thank you for your insightful contribution.
---
I never jump and it works just fine on certain servers. Don't remember how it was in true vanilla.
---
Kewl
---
Stop holding out on us man.
---
lol. All you young people. I was 33 in '04. You know the damn near 50 year old curmudgeons we all played wow with back then? Well.. I'm THAT guy now. The grumpiness will be strong lol.
---
many consumables are something you can farm in an afternoon. the question is, are you ready to farm multiple afternoons every week for the same raids over and over again, schedule your world buff rotation, and do the PvP &amp; reps on the side?
---
imo hardcore isnt about being skilled, its about investing a serious amount of hours per week to play wow. like 20+
---
You need multiple it only has 3 or 5 uses afaic
---
Won't have gold trading.  Lol
---
itt: remove cd.s on everything.
---
I require old naga mice. Sadly the new ones have curved buttons and I'm too old to change my muscle memory. Took me months to find a replacement.
---
Pretty funny reply considering the first post I replied to. :)
---
As someone who works for a company that sells computers..  avoid msi.  We have like a 40% fail rate in the first year on those (sounds great its under warranty) nobody wants to have their PC out for repair for a month.
---
I personally buy whatever is the best price at the time regardless of brand.  And avoid msi.   I have 2 dell 2 hp a macbook pro 2014 and an Acer.
---
100% agree. Flip it on at like 4AMest to fuck with them.
---
Just play tbc
---
The Taste Of Ink - The Used. It was on hunter epic quest video AMV and I can't ever think about anything else when I hear the song.
---
I would honestly pay for that and on a per character basis as well so I could pay for one, level to 70/80, crafts, etc and then pay for another, repeat. Here's to hoping for them doing it smart
---
Down ranking and pre casting.
---
Hard to say yet. Blizzard usually releases an alpha client with all addons disabled, then a beta client with addons enabled. So if they release a beta client for classic there definitely will be addons on day 1 of release.
---
With PI I wouldnt have the points to have shadowform, which sortve defeats the purpose of  being a spriest.
---
But why the rush, on the other hand? Classic is there to stay for next 10 years or whatever time. Even at this pace I will be flying through content üòÄüëå
---
In an official, Blizzard sanctioned capacity, LOL.
---
tbf that's mostly due to the massive surprise the classic announcement was.
---
If you do decide to go the build your own PC route, I recommend www.logicalincrements.com as a reference for parts that go well together at different price points. Really just leaves some minor options and the assembly to you. Even if you want to customize it more to your spesific needs, it can be a good platform.
---
Actuallly - you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I no longer listen to any of the songs I used to when I was playing WoW, but I know what you are talking about and experience that phenomenon myself.
---
For instance, most of the Blackmill songs remind me of the Tomb Raider game (the first one in the new series) as I listened to those songs while playing that game on PS3
---
Even things not related to gaming - I have a couple of songs that are decent, but I no longer listen to because when I do I get stress and anxiety because I used to listen to them during a time when I had lots of schoolwork, general problems in school, and on top of that was going through my first breakup, so listening to those songs brings back those emotions even if I don‚Äôt remember what was causing them - it‚Äôs like my emotions remember but my thoughts don‚Äôt üòÖ
---
When lfd came out I started rolling need on everything that dropped as I was a tank druid.   I would need anything it would let me.   And druids can roll on alot of stuff.     It was worth it for me to disenchant it.    And I rarely got kicked for ninjaing because ppl didnt want to wait for a tank.      
---
I ACTUALLY remember how bad things got with new features as the game progressed.
---
Don't let the rogue kill you then.
---
1) buy a tp rune for 20 silver
---
2) make a Tp for 50 silver
---
3) ???
---
4) Profit!
---
I still do..his machinimas at least.
---
Ahh thanks!
---
(Just for educational purposes) I suppose it will become:
---
There's no reason, it does make sense to have an independent classic WoW dev team that wouldn't be working on current retail.
---
Okay now I understand it. Thanks both!
---
the one pretending to be retarded sounds like its you
---
viable != optimal
---
I‚Äôd argue a bear MT is less clearly less viable than a Warrior MT, and clearly more viable than a Paladin MT. It‚Äôs a step down each time, and paladins and bears are not ‚Äúequally bad‚Äù.
---
He says, literally using ‚Äúno u‚Äù as an argument.
---
Add Heroic Strike Damage to Sunder Armor.
---
So your criticism is in short that private servers got it .. Too right? Front stabbing and front shredding were indeed a thing in vanilla. I won‚Äôt speak on /sit macros for pve because it never applied to me. 
---
Seems silly to point out when there are other legitimate errors the developers have openly admitted to, likenot bothering researching cast triggers for low level / low trafficked mobs etc. An understandable design decision since there are other more pressing issues. 
---
Comments like yours are the reason I posted in the first place. Why not do a bare minimum of research on your own before simply making up your mind.
---
That's cool, but what if the moonfire dot also did the same debuff as faerie fire.
---
sky's the limit man, how about they tri-wield three handed weapons.
---
I don't disagree with you. I am saying if you compare how classic is being treated by Blizzard to how the release of BFA was and the release of 8.2, It is much closer to that of 8.2
---
People quit all the time.  There will be plenty of players that quit one or the other and want to cash out.
---
I've tried several classes, and I always go back to hunter. It is just the most fun for me to play. Also has a very high skill cap imo. No other class has to manage distance like a hunter. And I think hunter has the most hotkeys needed (at least to play well).
---
Just kiting people is fun, too. Cheetah on moving fast as fuck. Knowing a single hit means a daze and they get in your dead zone or melee. Pulling off jump/spin shots while maintaining your superior range. Switching your tracking to whatever mobs are around so you can weave between them without getting dazed by some gd bear you didn't see.
---
And that rhok delar quest is the best quest ever. It is difficult, but most of all it us punishing. Fuck up once on any of those demons and you die
---
Paladin wants crit, not mp5.
---
I mean mp5 isn't bad but crit is so much better.
---
Can you explain the mobs doing heavy lifting please?
---
Have an idea on time of weekend raids?
---
Hmm that‚Äôs strange I just upgraded my 10year old naga because it had started to stop moving randomly. I can‚Äôt really feel a difference in the Trinity I picked up.
---
Writing a book is difficult not because writing a single page is hard. But because the time and effort required to write 100s of coherent pages is difficult. Getting a degree is hard not because going to class is hard, or doing one test. But because going to class consistently and always being prepared for the next test takes time and effort. Riding a skateboard isn't hard because putting one foot on a board and pushing with the other is difficult. But because of the time and effort required to master manipulation of the board. Blahh, blahh, blahh. Ever heard of 10 thousands hours? The time required to master a skill? Most everything that is hard is difficult because of the time and effort investment requirement.
---
and Fear Ward.
---
Also death coil can't be WotF'd so it really isn't so bad. People just repeat what they heard without thinking about it.
---
In theory, but go watch AQ and Naxx vids from private servers you wont see any hunters anywhere near the top. Its fury warriors, warlocks, mages and rogues.
---
On the other hand, if you are in a casual or semi-casual raid guild, it's pretty easy to make up for a suboptimal class with time and effort.
---
imo, unless you are going no-life mode and want to be in the top 5%, play what you enjoy. Show up on time and with consumables and you'll be one of the better raiders in your guild regardless of class.
---
The batching window for retail is so short now because it can be. thnx technology.
---
You really don't need to be holy to heal/support, especially at lower levels.
---
If you look at Holy talents, there are very, very few talents that actually increase the amount of healing you do. The difference between a Holy paladin and not-Holy paladin's healing is pretty small.
---
You should always be Ret while leveling. If you need to heal you literally just throw on your int set and you're good to go.
---
Four hours and two comments required to complete a thought.  Marvelous.
---
&gt;"equally bad"
---
....I never said that.
---
Feral Tank is viable for most raid bosses.
---
Yeah they probably don‚Äôt anticipate the population explosion the way this sub is making it seem.
---
Because magic is for pussies. 
---
Me smash. Me Smith. Me slam.
---
ME WARRIOR
---
You just said it. Time and effort are two different things. Time alone is the difficulty supplement, but effort is subjective.
---
Lmao
---
Looking for casual players to level up and enjoy the game with. No rush, just hanging out doing the 2019 equivalent of Chuck Norris jokes. I'll likely start with a human warrior, and will typically be on during EST playtimes. Have a discord server for those interested, Snow#5979. Thanks.
---
You can easily have a warrior dw tank bwl/aq40 content once on farm. Our MT only puts a shield on if we are less than 11 healers, or on twin emps.
---
Frustration and resorting to underhanded personal insults, that attitude is your own problem buddy.
---
Go disc. You heal great in raids and have PI utility and spirit buff and you can destroy shadow priests with mana burn.
---
i'll give u a blessing if u give me int :)
---
Okay, these truly "hardcore" players will get the server first MC clear. They will have the most time to gear up, putting them ahead of gear curve. They also will have an opportunity to farm gold. 
---
But I think most players will have caught up by phase 3 at the latest. The semi casual players will have nef on farm weeks or months before AQ is released. The difference between the hardcore guild and others will be negligible at that point in terms of gear.  These hardcore players also will not be able to start the honor farm until months later which isn't how pservers were. They will miss out on the unique time before most players hit 60 when brawls break out in contested zones, raids on cities, new friends, the little things that make you attached to your character and server all because they will spend that extra time farming gold before the masses hit 60.
---
If you did play multiple max level characters in original vanilla, then why are you talking about -armor effects being incorrect on private servers? They are the same as they were in Vanilla.
---
Run into a bunch of mobs, both you and your aggressor get aggroed and attacked by mobs.
---
You feign death and all the mobs on you fall off but the mobs on your aggressor stay on them doing the damage for you.
---
Well rogues have 2 (and they don't even use eviscerate much) and warriors have 1, plus 1 more when execute come on right?
---
Hunters have 1 but aimed shot does add a massive amount of damage.  Outside of that it's all white damage and hunters get +30% crit dmg on white hits whereas i dont think warriors get their crit dmg on white hits? 
---
I'm not saying i doubt you btw I'm just curious about it.  I never played hunter but on paper it looks like it should be fine to me!
---
The buttons on the naga became curved around 2010ish
---
there's always that "hardcore" player in a group that shits on everyone, pulls everything and just acts like an ass in general meanwhile their performance is sup par because they're only there to get that BiS for that lvl bracket and drop group after that boss is done.
---
Maybe add Ony key for necklace. There aren't a whole lot of other good ones.
---
Was Feralsurge Girdle available right away? Foresight Girdle? Firemoss Boots?
---
What about the rare spawns in BRD? I seem to remember a good ring and a good pair of boots coming from there.
---
The second best ring in phase 1 might very well be the one you get from Princess quest in BRD. The rest look terrible.
---
You're just listing reasons we like vanilla and dislike retail, but you're just of the other perspective
---
Didn't play in 1.12 at all?
---
They‚Äôre a waste of a slot.
---
Keep dreaming kid. On most servers every raid will be cleared minutes after release.
---
hmm TiL luckily my muscle memory had no trouble glad you found a replacement.
---
" and i'm sure much more. "  
---
No. You HOPE much more.
---
In vanilla I ended up in a despawn war with a night elf hunter. We got sick of it after a couple weeks and made a truce, lol. There was some collateral damage, also, which just made it harder with newly pissed off hunters getting held back.
---
I just hope if the server populations are a lot more that they modify the respawn times. On the big p server, it was 3 hours if you failed and normal if you killed it. They also banned people who purposely despawned them.
---
Pretty good hud for 2006. I like it.
---
Paladins are the goat healers when it comes to mana efficiency. Even in BWL and AQ40 progression I hardly had to use any mana pots or runes. Meanwhile our priests/druids were flasking and using pots/runes on CD. I had flasks read to go and was willing to use them I just legit never needed to.
---
Also bubble lets you cheese mad encounters, it's the most OP ability for any healer in pve content IMO. Oh am I about to die? Nope all I need to do is bubble and I'm immune for 12 seconds. Lay of hands is also stupid OP with it granting 33% armor to the tank. You can single handily secure a progression kill on Nef or Cthune by using this at a clutch moment. 
---
Druids are definitely faster levers though paladins are underrated imo due to their slow and steady nature. Druid I would describe as average and steady which is why they are probably the fastest class to level after hunter/lock. 
---
End game wise druids are pretty weak in pvp outside of flag running. They can out sustain people in 1v1 and pull off some crafty escape but you'll never really feel dominate. Paladins on the other hand are key healers in preamde vs premade BGs
---
The biggest upside with druids end game is being able to actually tank if you want to provided you have the gear and spec. Tanks are kings in vanilla. If you want to do just about any bit of pve content first thing you need to find is a decent tank.
---
What I always wonder is how they deal with the equipment issue. Sure, lets say 40 speedrunners. But what to do when 60? I wouldn't say it's possible to take on the core in quest greens or worse boe greens. And let's not even get started on atunements and somebody has to also farm consumables. Flask recipes and the mats needed won't just magically appear in the auction house.
---
Fun fact, Aqual Quintessence will be required to summon the last two core bosses. You'll need to get Honored with the hydraxians and THEN kill the 4 bosses in MC. Theoretically possible but would require an awful trash grind in either Silithus or MC.
---
Is it really 8 shamans per raid? I was planning on maining Reston shaman but I don‚Äôt want all that competition over gear
---
There is really only a use to bring 1 per raid, but I remember usually having 2 in the guild that would raid, although during progression sometimes getting loot for the guild meant bringing someone else instead of the 2nd spriest.
---
My only complaint is not being able to use your pet. One of the demons having a pet oriented strategy would have been great.
---
If there is one thing nobody will get upset about, it's free new cosmetics
---
Thanks I was always very minimalistic and I know I spent hours and hours setting up my UI!
---
You are correct im trolling
---
~ Bannerlord ~
---
Lol talks about mechanics that actually were in Vanilla and now being removed for Classic as his argument against  "lol you'll see pservers got it completely right" .   
---
Honestly, I could care less if it takes 2x as long to level in Vanilla. Private servers are still highly accurate. Leveling is only a very small part of the game and the speed it takes is not a huge factor.
---
[mmmmmmm maybe?](https://youtu.be/h5wRRBPWYG4?t=1138)
---
The idea is you heal and just keep shadow weaving up without shadow form.  Shadow has crazy mana issues as you know.
---
Best thing about classic is making new friends m8. I got room for a shammy üòé
---
Find better friends. "Your salary is the average salary of your social circle."
---
Haha, there's the spirit. Endless build/set combinations and there will be a hunger for them come Classic.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what allows retail players to argue that retail is actually more difficult. Since there are mythic raids that are extremely difficult even with modern addons and computing equipment, they say that retail is harder than vanilla. Which is accurate if you‚Äôre only talking about the raiding scene. Leveling and open world content is insanely trivial, to the extent that it just feels like a time gate.
---
Also lacks selfawarness.  LOL
---
Little tip would be if you really wanna level all the way up together just play an alt when he isn‚Äôt on.
---
The Wrathgate music (which i think is actually just the Stormwind music?) will always be my favorite WoW music.  I started in Wrath, and pretty much always play with the music off (TV is always on), so that was some of the first WoW music i heard.
---
That cutscene more than anything hooked me on wanting to kill the Lich King, and made me want vengeance for what the forsaken did.
---
Such a great, well done scene.  Im not sure WoW has really ever topped with they did in Wrath for the cutscenes, tbh.  That and the Arthas one (after you kill him iirc) with Terenas were both so awesome.
---
How did you manage that :o
---
Came here to say this less eloquently.
---
How does an armor or resistance value being off by 0.001 "make a drastic difference to the game play "?   
---
Spoiler : It fucking doesn't.
---
#KoreanAdvice
---
or make tiger's fury a proc off crits
---
The difference is that a Paladin can be deep holy spec'd and performs perfectly fine in premade PvP, while the Shaman gets forced into World PvP so he doesn't want to have a deep resto spec.
---
That being said, Pally realls only needs 21 in Holy to be 95% effective in raids. Holy Shock is a PvP talent, Lasting Judgement is situational and only needed if you're on judgement duty so the only thing you're missing is 5% spellcrit. Compare that to the 30/0/21 shaman that loses pretty much everything that isn't pure chain heal spamming, and he still misses out on Mana Tide and Imp Spring for his group, while totally gimping their ability to spot heal.
---
It's general consensus that Alliance dominates in premade PvP, I don't know why windfury would change that since it was always part of the equation. Warrior with Freedom and double cleanse is just broken.
---
That's a very legit point right there that many meme spec wannabes should pay attention to. From a pure pve progression point of view memes are a hot mess. However there are many guilds that are more pvp focused who run raids to gear themselves up for pvp. Those guilds are more meme spec friendly since it's not all about gearing up to progress in pve, it's all about gearing up for pvp where you can be effective.
---
And yet none of those things will create a "fresh" gaming experience.
---
it is 100% possible to do mc in quest greens with 40 fresh 60s
---
Dynamite is the best option I think. Just throw it and tag all the mobs. You‚Äôll get a couple resists but still insane  xp
---
Had a lot of fun sharing out free water/food in the past. Made a lot of money from generous people who appreciate your existence as well!
---
What are you talking about? Do you have any reason to think that a private server is calculating threat incorrectly?
---
this one obviously wins
---
It‚Äôs a separate game
---
Blizz is expecting some level of a sub bump from 8.2. They‚Äôre going to want to stretch any upswing of subs after 8.2. So no less than 4 weeks after 8.2 is released. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for Blizz to condense the time frame of new or returning subscribers.  Release of 8.2 will be the best indicator for narrowing down classic release.
---
Because the casuals will go on and on about how it's all about the experience and whatnot, but will never actually get to experience everything the game has to offer. Hardcore players will. They jelly. 
---
The bit about "alternative servers" though, I kind of understand. Those people will be more condescending than anyone, because they actively play a version of Vanilla WoW, which they believe means they know everything about Classic. I've had a person tell me that WotF is useless because every rogue has used some CD by a certain point in the fight (the fight being any PvP encounter) or some nonsense and how that's the current 'meta'. They think they know exactly how everything is going to play out, but they don't. Classic will not be the same as pservers. 
---
There is some guy posting videos to youtube recently about Classic, but it's all from pserver play. He talks about how you don't need a shield to run Ony, but he's got thunderfury and full AQ40/Naxx gear and full flasks/WB's, which will not be the case in Classic due to limited availability of both Black Lotus and World Buff turn ins. They are disconnected from what Classic will be, especially early on. 
---
Any of them that actually played anywhere close to hardcore in Vanilla have replaced any actual Vanilla knowledge with Pserver knowledge and present it as 100% fact.
---
Thank you very much! This was fantastic help and makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the detailed response. I did not consider elite farming at all when needed. Great call.
---
Totes got offended.
---
I‚Äôm offended that you think he offended me.
---
Idk he seems spot on in the advertising spectrum. When blizz does something they go HEY GUYS CHECK OUT THIS COOL STUFF where classic, which a lot of us thing is huge, is more like *hey. This is about to exist*

---
Always makes me think I'm with my guild.
---
There are plenty of leveling guides out there that don't rely on front stabbing or reckoning though. This is probably the weakest knock against private servers I have ever heard lol. And you act like its some nail in the coffin. "hurr durr if the leveling guides don't work because blizz removes mechanics that actually were in Vanilla private servers are clearly wrong"
---
one SP is worth bringing, after that it's a waste yes
---
Thank you for taking the time to link those. I have already seen these. He has good info but most of it revolves around Duo comps. My friend and I have already planned our comps. I was looking for more detailed info on the mechanics of leveling duo. hes got some other useful info in there as well. I just want more!
---
It's true, I always hated that about vanilla.
---
They scale for sure, but the dps charts always show them getting passed up. That's what I've always seen, at least, because I haven't completed aq 40 or naxx.
---
And it isn't just pure damage scaling. The more damage a warrior does, the more rage he gets to do damage with. Then you think about pet scaling. as a freshly dinged 60, your pet will do like 1/3 of your total damage even not beast mastery specced. Later in Naxx it is doing that exact same damage and dying a lot easier.
---
You'll not know until release. Pservers are progressive, but vanilla was quite against them. I'm guessing they're somewhere in between.
---
Constructive criticism only please, you gave me a Scout's promise.  :(
---
Excact same here! God I love that they invoke that sense I felt playing WoW
---
For sure we plan to do this. I will either be catching up on professions while hes logged out or leveling an alt. He honestly will end up playing more than me.
---
Beautiful use of the semicolon.
---
and cyclone yourself
---
What about Post-Naxx content with no reward other than prestige? Or Mounts or something?
---
I was a hardcore raider throughout Vanilla, TBC and Wrath, spent years as an officer.
---
You are totally right.
---
My bigger problem is that a lot of committed gamers have just atrocious personalities and politics. Bias against women in the game/ harassing girls that speak on voice chat.
---
I'm not looking forward to the GG/MR culture and sifting through dozens of apps looking for chill progressive people.
---
No, this is a common misconception about new subreddits. The longer a subreddit has existed, the more people stop using reddit with accounts that are subscribed to said subreddit. It happens with every subreddit.
---
It's why when I played a Holy Priest for healing that I rarely accepted mage water. The stuff I had on me was better than what the mage could provide and the tanks tended to run on ahead while I was drinking. So I used the best water possible to maximize my mana during the short time I had.
---
Or getting feared through the boat üòÇ
---
Yes we do. We know exactly which debuffs stacked in Vanilla and how they stacked.  
---
You are repeating a myth/lie that TipsOut created. It is proven false. Now please, carry on.
---
Holyweaver or the PI/SW spec both provide shadow weaving without taking up a real dpsers slot.
---
If it's not a blue post on the official forum then we don't know anything.
---
Quick off-the-cuff remarks at Blizzcon aren't probably set in stone so if wait for a blue post.
---
I guess it went along with blizz's "interesting choices" philosophy, spend no gold but slower grinding or spend gold, faster grinding.  Still, it was pretty lame.
---
After Nax just keep the level cap 60 and add new dungeons, raids and pvp stuff (fuck arenas) to keep it classic +????
---
The reason that works on private servers is because they emulate the patches as they were released and that was nerfed in 1.10 because of the guy one shotting kazzak with reckoning.
---
I never said anything about what people should and shouldn't play just that hunters objectively do not scale well in vanilla. 
---
It's also contradictory to say "if your not going no-life mode" but at the same time saying "just put in more time/effort than everyone else to get the same results". Casual players more than anybody should consider playing the classes that require the least amount of effort to be competitive that are also in demand for raid comps. 
---
Lastly if your one of the better dps in your guild as a hunter your guild simply isn't going to get through AQ40. If you aren't interested in doing so that's fine but I know a lot of people want to actually get through 100% of the raid content this time around since most of us didn't in 2005.
---
Do you know if that's where the API comments came from? I seem to remember this news arising well after Blizzcon, but I could be wrong.
---
As a future hunter, I think that is fair. 
---
Especially while leveling, since a 2h melee weapon is so much less of an upgrade for a hunter over a warrior or paladin.
---
I've had mages / hunters on pservers roll need on str rings, because it was an upgrade (they didn't have a ring on).
---
Technically it is an upgrade, but why would you take that over a str class...
---
Agi jewelry gets a bit more murky. 
---
TBH hunters on Pservers really made me question rolling one... so many bad ones, I imagine classic will be the same.
---
He means instead of going the normal employee -&gt; player "beta" -&gt; release it would just go employee -&gt; F&amp;F -&gt; release
---
can you explain pre-casting. Down-ranking I know.
---
You can actually look up that that encounter on youtube from "back in the day" and notice Princess wont cast her aoe knockdown ability unless someone gets in melee with her.
---
What this means is that on private servers you can kite her indefinately as she will never catch up to you due to stopping to cast her AoE every 20 seconds.
---
I misspoke I meant "holding two mouse buttons to move" which I didn't know other people did.
---
In 2004 these were very much pro tricks because the meta was so unadvanced.
---
God when it cuts to the dwarf hunter. Omg. But where is the forsaken lock???
---
Nice. Not too much but would make hunters a real pain to fight. They could kite anyone

Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
Looking For: 
---
    Damage:
---
     -  Hunter
---
     -  Warlock
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Rogue
---
    Healing:
---
     -  Priest
---
     -  Paladin
---
     -  Druid
---
    Tanking:
---
     -  None
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be.
---
Raid Schedule 
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.

Ah, Reddit tropes got me again.  Last time I mentioned Upright Orc Postures I got downvoted to all Hell because it wasn't a classic option.
---
Same when I said I really liked the more fleshy forsaken models without the bones protruding all over the place.
---
I should use "unpopular opinion" more often...
---
This is why I used Stormwind as a hub, everyone was in Ironforge...
---
...then they added an AH in Stormwind.
---
There's literally thousands of videos from warriors during Vanilla we can use to cross reference rage gain with damage done by various weapons using various buffs and debuffs etc. The rage formula used by private servers is likely very close to the real deal.
---
No more getting caught in a dead zone by root effects. Would make hunters much more deadly in pvp
---
I saw the same question a month ago so I'll guess I just copy what I said that time. These songs will always remind me of vanilla.

Time to make some sweet gold.
---
If you get the eye drop, yeah. And then doing the quest was hard, farming the holy waters was a pain in the ass; benediction is great but it's not a cakewalk
---
&gt; Even the private server creators will admit that there is still a lot wrong with private servers.
---
The issue is people see "wrong" and they automatically assume it means pservers are easier. Which ofcourse is not a conclusion you can draw from that. Only that they are different, and it might swing in either direction.
---
This has nothing to do with the guy one-shotting Kazzak - that was an issue that was caused due to the reckoning stacks not having limits, so you could farm the stacks and so long as you didn‚Äôt use them, they could stack to as many as you could collect. That was something that was hotfixed IMMEDIATELY, not via a full patch.
---
What I‚Äôm talking about is the ability to trigger the proc not with being naturally crit, but by being hit with double-damage from a physical attack due to sitting - the game registers those as crits rather than a flat double damage, and it was not intended to count toward procs, so they patched it and made it that if you are sitting when you are hit with a crit, then you do not receive a proc such as reckoning or redoubt.
---
Now, due to server lag, there was a way to get around that by spamming your sit button so that your character would sit-stand-sit-stand repeatedly and if you were crit while standing up from a seated position, the server would think you were standing (again, due to lag) and still proc the ability. There is no telling if that will be in Classic or not, but the point is that just flat sitting down and being hit with a crit will not proc redoubt or reckoning. 
---
As a side note, this was later enabled again in a pre-TBC patch (the patch right after 1.12 that was getting everything ready for TBC).
---
You dont even really need 40. Like 35+. I think the hardest part is getting the rep to proceed, but that can be circumvented by farming on giving to one guy and summing him back and forth for the quest line.
---
Spend the first half of a dungeon summoning water and catching up to the group...Hey, why is the mage dps so low?  You want water?  Shut up.
---
Very cool! Especially because you're a warlock and they seem super rare back then.
---
Said this earlier in another thread but I'll never forgive ‚Äúyou think you do, but you don‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
The fact that so much time passed between Nost and the Classic announcement suggests that there were some senior blizzard people still against Classic WoW, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Brack was one of them. Cognitive dissonance is a real thing and it's sad that egos got in the way of giving the community what it wants.
---
Played druid on multiple servers, here is my advice to a new druid.
---
Everything we can do as a druid, other classes do better. That is why there are so few of us. Leveling is super fun and really fast too but in 5mans and specially in raiding other classes simply outshine us. 
---
If you are into raiding and care about being competitive i would avoid druid and go for Warrior, rogue, mage or priest instead.
---
That being said, you can easily find a raid spot as a healer and if you get to heal the tank you can even top the healing meters.
---
The thing about druid tanks is that they get crit and warriors don't. This sometimes brings them low on hp or kills them. If you are in a hardcore guild where DPS is high it does not matter that there is a 5/100 chance of the tank getting crit and dropping low because the boss is dead in 30sec anyway. 
---
This is why you rarely see druid tanks in casual guilds because it does not work out well when boss takes 3mins to kill. 
---
Feral dps is bad unless you do Powershifting. Look up [shedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2t7qG9SrVI&amp;t=804s) on youtube.
---
Boomkin is also not good.
---
Druids were really underpowered for the first part of Vanilla. They got buffed somewhere in the middle of it but never enough to become popular in raids.
---
its now "You think you want spirit on Helm of Wrath, but you dont".
---
That and the fact that WoW BFA also is a total failure and can be considered the worst expansion hurts them a lot too and pushed them even further to go for Classic to raise the numbers up again.
---
As a healer I bind Target Party 1,2,3 and 4. Alt in addition to keybinds to heal myself.
---
&gt;  They can 1v1 really well.
---
They can *duel* well, which is a big difference. The only thing making them legit is short range from the duel flag, remove that and they can't force a kill.
---
In group PvP they are obviously worthless.
---
The guild (hopefully to be named) Ganksters is an alliance guild recruiting for vanilla in NA (PvP server) with a spot for everyone here. We plan on raiding Wed 8-midnight central (I guess that makes us a moderate raiding guild) and doing guild pvp (premades and just organized world pvp) but if you‚Äôre a more casual player looking for a classic community you‚Äôre welcome as well. Check us out at discord.gg/bFkkKdu

#nochanges right
---
Im picking up WoW for the first time because of classic but now im starting to wonder, I know ill be a gnome mage as no other class interests me, and I did play FF11 and they had the same thing in terms of portals (warp to home point) but not the food thing.
---
Im generally nice and the reason Im starting wow is because it was like FF11 (At the start before it went to shit) Warping was never to bad, I didnt get random messages, usually after a party I warped everyone which is ok, but if im trying to play and I get spammed im going to say something or block people, My sould draining job, then long commute leaves me with an hour tops to play some days and the last thing I want is to be spammed for shit, regardless how much is offered.
---
Basically is this actually going to happen? as bad as people are saying? Is it ok to just ignore people or will I eventually be put on the naughty list?
---
My most recent experience going from 1-60 was basically dying to level 60 griefers in lakeshire. Everywhere else it was just an occasional skirmish with similarly leveled players that was actually fun. I vividly remember getting ganked by a same level shaman in felwood and then proceeding to dominate him and corpse camp him 5 times before i was satisfied that i had my revenge.
---
Fact of the matter is you would never be able to tell if you watched a video from both side by side using the same graphics and rendering settings for the video.
---
I wouldn't take it so far as "encouraged." Tolerated, certainly, though even that's subject to qualifiers (the size and pedigree of the studio, the resources at their disposal, etc).
---
The limits of which are ultimately subjective, of course. In any case, I agree with the general thrust of your point. As Miyamoto famously said, "A delayed game is eventually released. A bad game is bad forever."
---
I prefer going holy for the first eleven points. Consecration is superior to tank and dps for multiple targets compared to SoC vs. SoR Also makes you less weapon depended. 
---
Verigans fist is also slightly too fast to benefit from Seal of Command. SoR is better with it. 
---
You can always fill retri tree later. SoC is useful at 60 without a doubt but during leveling it's worse.
---
I won‚Äôt get my sick days back till August either. I‚Äôm praying
---
+1 Feuer Frei
---
you could just not post at all. No one really cares why you‚Äôre NOT playing the game. Seems like you want people to tell you how great that sounds.
---
Have they ever started a full advert run on a game without a release date? Not here to fight, I just don't know
---
Here ya go :

---
You are right that they cant force a kill. Most people could choose to just not fight a paladin. But most people also cant choose to kill a paladin. And with pvp objectives it's pretty easy to force a fight. Any type of warrior or rogue is arguably better than a paladin by them selves. But any type of paladin with a warrior or rogue can beat any two warriors or rogues in a fight over an objective. I know vanilla is rock paper scissors for a lot of pvp but when you mix the hybrids with any other class they become multipliers and supports that can change battles
---
It will definitely have those type of people in it. Those types of interactions were common in Vanilla WoW and all subsequent expansions.
---
While this is correct, it's not the only source. Plenty of documentation of armor values come from calculating the damage of abilities that does a flat amount of damage towards the boss such as the rogue spell Kick, and factoring in any debuffs or buffs that might affect the damage.
---
Rush
---
Only place I ever got truly griefed for a long period of time is lakeshire. Most other w pvp i've experienced has been organic.
---
It's not going to be nearly as bad as 10k+ pop private servers packed to the brim with euro NEETs.. but you're going to get griefed and camped sometimes. If this happens, go for a walk or level an alt. It only makes it ten times sweeter when you kill filthy orcs.
---
This is exactly how players are trained by to get their world quests done on Retail WoW. Classic will absolutely have players like that.
---
Same place, different faction. Love it.
---
&gt;We also know that the Nost guys got the Onyxia fight completely wrong
---
This is absolutely not true. We know the triggers for deep breath is different, as confirmed by Blizzard. But you cannot conclude that the fight is "completely" wrong based on this, because the fight happens to seemingly BEHAVE the exact same way when you look at videos from both the real Vanilla and private servers.
---
If the backend code handles the mechanics differently, but the actual fight seemingly behave the same does it really matter?
---
Problem is you can do all of that, and faster and more accurately, by using right click to move the camera and change your facing. Just don't take a drink while you're in the middle of PvP or kiting and you're fine, you're losing out on 2 premium keybinds for an action you should ideally never be using.
---
Wait... you don't bind your strafe keys at all? What kind of monster are you...
---
And the question "which is your least favorite race?" is #3. That's bloody hilarious
---
Fair, combat daggers is good though but I personally prefer swords and think they‚Äôre better too.
---
I would always go human sword rogue.  But he seems to wanna go NE.
---
Does this bring back the ability to cast curse of doom on boars until you get a doom guard, which can be released in town to wreck people? Asking for a friend ...
---
Basshunter, Darren Styles, Tiesto etc. Mainly because I used to blare the shit while I was doing Dailies in BC.
---
Try pooling upgrades on the warrior if you play warrior/healer, the warrior will do most of the damage anyway (charge and time spent healing is some of the reasons). Do quests that give important upgrades (weapons) even if they are recommended to be skipped by most guides. some dungeons are worth doing some are not. what determine that is how easy is the quests to get and how many are they, also how good are the rewards. try weaving your class quests into your normal questing route. and have fun whit windfury totems.
---
I've done it a few times with my buddy. You can quest the whole way, especially since it seems classic will have searing gorge quests day 1. It requires you to do a lot of zone hopping to keep quests as close to yellow as possible ideally. You'll have to be smart about which quests will chain with you best over time while zone hopping to make it really worth; if you whiff some big chains you will likely be better off just grinding instead of backtracking to fix the error.
---
The real hard part is keeping both of you in sync. It's hard to stay 1:1 the whole way, and I find it better to just do some solo quests if your schedules dont match up sometimes. You can knock out low drop rate collection quests that you might skip otherwise, and green quests that are on the brink of going grey. Save professions and alts for if you feel yourself getting way too far ahead. You can always abuse mob tagging to help the other guy catch up later. As long as you stay within 3 levels of eachother you might be surprised how fast that gap closes overtime even without mob tagging. Make a discord channel or gmotd to communicate any moves you guys make while solo, "Already got the FP for x zone last night and did the 3 easy quests there. Also don't forget to turn in y quest on the way. I'll be on at this time".
---
For Aliance I would go NE Hunter, because shadowmeld and stelth pet are too much fun to mess with people.
---
For Horde I would go Warlock, because I am an Orc Warlock.
---
If you have a source that confirms otherwise you are free to post it. Otherwise you are just doing exactly what you accuse Nost developers of doing, which is to speculate.
---
A casual guild I was in got more than half of naxx down and they only raided 2 days a week for 3-4 hours tops. It's not like it's THAT hard. Take it chill, gear up and learn and every casual raiding guild will have naxx on farm after a while
---
Man, next time you go into a 40 mans raid, and officers removes voice from you because communication and not socialization is needed, tell me that vanilla is very social again. Also when 2 rogues will rape your anus at the doors of BRD and you can't do nothing about that because you can't turn off pvp, tell me that vanilla is very social... if for social you mean people calling for help when ganked by a lv 60, yes than it is more social ok.
---
* yeah but bags will be cheap in the beginning since everyone will be broke and stuff will get more expensive as time passes
---
* probably, but the question is "will it be game breaking?"
---
* that sucks
---
* true
---
* okay
---
* something for something, many of us who plans to play on launch will be glad for it
---
* also true probably
---
It was very much the reality of vanilla that most Druid‚Äôs were resto. They also get discriminated against in 5 mans because of no brez. Personally if I have the choice between a druid and a priest in a 60 dungeon not knowing their gear or the player. I‚Äôd probably choose the priest 9/10 times.
---
&gt; warriors have 1, plus 1 more when execute come on right?
---
Bloodthirst and Whirlwind would like to have a chat with you.
---
Yes, waiting until the server isn't new is something you can do when the server is new.
---
I know this post has been long-forgotten in reddit time, but I want to thank you OP. I‚Äôve been coming back to this post and listening to them these past few days and enjoying it a lot!
---
When I was younger I actually enjoyed all of those annoying things you're talking about because I was a loser who played WoW and that made you a social pariah at my school. So being "the popular kid" in game made me feel like such a complete bad ass.
---
I'm more worried about the cannon move during the VanClef fight that trivializes the whole thing. Does the modern WoW engine address problems like this where you can avoid whole fight mechanics or will that still be there?
---
Also yes, Cookie FIRST, then VC, nobody's gonna bail before VC, but there's always at least 1 guy that leaves who promised he'd do Cookie.
---
We absolutely do know the values for many of the bosses and they are all across the board dramatically higher on private servers.
---
All you need is a roof, electricity in one room and internet. ‚ÄúHoney, it‚Äôs done!‚Äù
---
It annoys the shit out of me these days on *cough*private servers*cough* just as much as it did the 2nd time i saw someone do it back in the day. I get it and its nice to see a skip like that for the first time ever but holy crap you are just skipping XP gosh darn it...
---
?
---
You mean except that video that was posted here a while back where it was proven beyond doubt that the raid reduced Kel'Thuzad's armor to practically zero?
---
&gt; So your criticism is in short that private servers got it .. Too right? Front stabbing and front shredding were indeed a thing in vanilla.
---
No they weren't. You obviously never played vanilla.
---
I guarantee you everyone who ever played a real rogue in real vanilla, even just for the first dozen levels, tried running back and forth through mobs trying to get backstab to go off. It never worked. The only way to get a backstab off was to CC the mob and get behind it, or have someone else get aggro.
---
I am 100% on this train. I for the FIRST time in any game am likely to have 10-20 people that I have gamed with all converging on one location. All of my previous WoW friends are also coming back. It seems like this could have a huge gathering of people again, which could be something else.
---
I know we are not the only ones that are going to see this. That is why I made a post a while ago saying that I think the initial number of WoW could hit the 5 mil + subs.
---
I saw someone say that it would not pass 1 mil. They were confident it would struggle to even hit 750k. I am of a very different thought and hope everyone can get back in touch with their old gaming pals.
---
um, thats not exactly true.  
---
Tons of awesome feral dps in gear, including a few weapons.  
---
World dragons had some awesome peices. I had dark heart pants from lethon + malfurions blessed bulwark chest from BWL and those two items were big parts of hitting armor cap.
---
in terms of maximizing DPS, yeah definity alliance.
---
Think about it. We live in a timeline with so many fucking weird things. Remember when the entire internet shit the bed when a monkey got put to rest? What about the fact that we don't have net neutrality? What about the fact that a celebrity is the President of the USA? 
---
But we're getting Classic WoW in (hopefully) less than 90 days! We truly are living in the best timeline, even if we have to call them the Berenstain Bears.
---
Blizzard has been holding the raids releases for at least a month after the patch hits for a while now. So the 8.2 raid comes out most likely around mid-July.
---
They never said anything like that.
---
Is it possible to add partial matches? So if you were looking for Thunderfury you could just type !item thunderfury instead of the full !item thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker
---
Do you want to have the most mana efficient heal in the game AND have plate armor?
---
Do you want to make your teammates love you just by your SHEER fucking presence?
---
Do you want to single handedly tilt a pvp teamfight just by BoPing your priest ally who was litterally getting shit on by those damn rogues?
---
Do you want to gamble your life on every melee swing?
---
Do you want mages to kill themselves because you reflected that one scorch and it crit? While also giving you a guaranteed melee swing added to your timer? While also giving you the best block buff in the game?
---
Uther is right over there at the Paladin recruitment table!
---
&gt;That's why every single vanilla private server that exists has summoning meeting stones, even if some servers do disable the interaction to try and be a little bit more blizzlike
---
The servers use the 1.12 CLIENT, which means that if Summoning stones did not exist in Vanilla they would not be part of th Client.
---
Before TBC these were simply meeting stones and they function exactly like they do on private servers.
---
rule of thumb: if there is no fear, and if its physical damage mostly, bears excell.  
---
Physical damage emp for example
---
i'm talking about the modern classic player.  the average skill level in classic will be much higher than it was in vanilla.  clicker keyboard turning soccer moms won't be playing classic
---
Paladins and Priests don't have as much overlap as people think because flash of light has poor scaling from +healing, benefiting more from spell crit.
---
It's really mages and druids fighting against paladins for loot, not priests.
---
Inb4 Miyamoto A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.
---
If you‚Äôre in the top 1-5% of raiding guilds, where optimal specs are a requirement, you‚Äôre probably going to be delegated to a healing role.  In more casual guilds, or if you‚Äôre doing content that‚Äôs on farm, you will be fine as a cat or boomkin.
---
The eye is a 50% drop chance in Domos chest, it's not a cakewalk but if your any bit serious about raiding you'll get it done.
---
You forgot this

---
The only aspect of the new Forsaken models that I take issue with (aside from some of the faces not really representing the personality of the old faces, imo) are the damn shoulders. The old model had a little exposed shoulder bone, and the new on has the whole damn humerus jutting up through the top, very clearly not attached to anything, and meaning the arms would be way long if it *was* connected.
---
Probably depends on how tryhard your guild is
---
Likewise I'm interested to see who tries to do this as it does trivialize the fight, however explaining it to people who have never done it usually ends up in several hilarious wipes before they figure out how it's done. But it's a fairly obvious bug and will be reported as such, so I would expect that to be fixed, if in no other way than making that spot unreachable through jumping.
---
Otherwise, I'm not going to go out of my way to try to explain it to people if I'm in a group who gets there, but if somebody else wants to explain it to people and try to do it I won't leave the group or refuse to do
---
either that, or it was a lot harder to make, and a lot harder to find a way to make this project happe  without the activision suits ruining it (i.e. shelving or monetizing). maybe the senior blizzard devs just had  really hard time coming up with a way to bring the classic project alive than you give them credit for.
---
make no mistake, the devs - even senior - are not the enemy. Activision is.
---
Thanks a bunch bro, really helpful.
---
Was mainly considering it for the options of tanking and healing but if that‚Äôs not 100% viable then it definitely pulls it into question....
---
I think these sorts of projecting rants say a lot more about the speaker than about anyone else. I am guessing you have spent a lot of time fantasising about this exact scenario and glorying in how much you imagine everyone is going to envy you.
---
Rhapsody - Dawn of Victory
---
I just get bored with giant titty manga, cosplay and other arts and crafts bullshit, there WAS some really good discussion going on back in October/November but then there was a daily "Can we stop complaining about the game, we know about the issues already!"  and so no one wanted to talk about the issues anymore it just turned back into deviant art "durrr look at what I made!"
---
You have some great posts in this thread but this is actually not the reason.
---
Sitting for enrage (warrior) and reckoning stacks did not work in Vanilla. Sitting would make the attack crit, but would not trigger these effects.
---
HOWEVER, due to spell batching you were able to sit down, then immediately stand back up as the attack landed. This would trick the server into thinking you were still sitting as it did the calculations and you would be rewarded a stack of Reckoning. We have multiple videos showing this :)
---
Yeah, but you don't need one.  You need like 30+...per week...
---
I would not be surprised if at least 100k of the /r/wow subscriber accounts have not been logged into in the past year.
---
The original comment came from Ian Hazzikostas at the BlizzCon Wow panel. He said that they will allow addons to make things like organizing your mailbox easier but they will not allow them to simplify fighting strategies to "smash one button" orgies.
---
The down votes for any post that doesn't praise private severs are funny. A lot of you private server fan bois are gonna be in for some surprises when you play the real game.
---
this is what /dnd is for. consider using it
---
Casting and cancelling if not needed. Critical on bosses like patchwerk or when you can predict incoming burst from a warrior in pvp.
---
Bears "excel" by eating crits/crushings all the time and having no defensive cooldowns?
---
Wow. A had a whole relationship between those little arrows.
---
Very important, once you do raidcontent join the https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19752 Mafia. Each time the raidleader orders a whipe you save a fellow paladin who returns the favour on the next pull eh whipe.
---
Also bubble+hearth actually work fairly well if a break or the raid ends with a whipe. 
---
Repair costs happen to other people. Not paladins.
---
You do it through calculating armor based on known variables. If you have a video where a warrior use bloodthirst (damage is directly based on attackpower) and then then get a crusader proc before the next blood lust while all other debuffs/buffs remain the same, then we can reasonably draw conclusions as to how much armor the boss has based on this.
---
It's actually not that difficult.
---
Notice me senpai~~
---
*backstab*
---
As the infinitely wise Joe Dirt said, "it's not about you, it's about the consumer."
---
And at 60 you're skipping potential epic world drops. I've seen so much good shit come out of that room in Scholo underneath the bridge that people insist on skipping and relying on FD or the like, and somebody always ends up agroing anyways. Just pull the damn mobs!
---
&gt; I believe its naive to assume we guaranteed a beta.
---
Literally every other Blizzard game has had a beta, why wouldn't this one? Especially for something that requires lots and lots of fine-tuning.
---
Yes. As long as people choose to compete it will be competitive.
---
&gt; What do they really need us to test?
---
Small details that only autistic vanilla fanatics (like us) would notice.
---
Like how pets are supposed to keep following enemy players even after stealth, or how channeled spells are not supposed to be interrupted by LoS, stuff like that.
---
I am not sure why but I feel that it is coming out before 8.2. Many people seem to be thinking that they are going to gauge classic release date after  releasing a stale and dying game mode update. They have lost what 65% of their player base at this point and if 10% return for the newest content, that would be a lot IMO. Sure I might be way off on those numbers, but I just do't know anyone still playing that is SUPER excited about 8.2. It just, Yay, more content.  
---
Classic has an ever growing community that is chomping at the bit. People are going bonkers over it and the hype train is fully cruising with virtually no effort on their end.  
---
I just do not see a real solid need for a Beta for users. I think that they have lived through these monsters enough times that some playthrough with their employees will sort of most of the bugs. SURE they will miss a bunch, but one that playthrough is done, figure a few weeks to sort things out and then..... why would they not release it?  
---
E3 is early/mid June. I am of the mind that it could drop right after E3. But hey, who knows. We all really have no information. So here's to hoping it comes out before July!
---
Maybe it was Brack's plan all along to win over the legit blizzard gamers once he got into power
---
food4thought
---
sidenote im a mage i make my own food
---
People will always run UBRS. The server won't magically be "done with prebis" alts are always gonna be rolled
---
It's literally in the one of the Patch notes for Vanilla:
---
Patch 0.9:
---
* Faerie Fire will now stack with other armor-reducing debuffs. 
---
* Sunder Armor no longer stacks with Expose Armor, but will now stack with Faerie Fire.
---
This person is literally admitting that he wants private servers to be "as wrong as possible" for selfish reasons. You can make up whatever story you want about me I am just calling it like I see it. But yea I am not a super hardcore player, dont have the time to play, so I don't really expect to be "admired" in classic. I am just not delusional and realize that what we see on private servers is probably pretty close to what we will get.
---
A crit on me is less damage then a normal hit on you, and I have a disgusting higher hp pool then you. Yes, on certain bosses? Its averaged out. 
---
Theres a reason top guilds used a bear tank on the physical emperor in aq40
---
My old guild from private server vanilla is getting back together when classic launches. We have all our old tanks and class officers. I haven‚Äôt played with or talked to these people for like 3 years and in a couple of months we will be playing again. I seriously can‚Äôt wait.
---
Mage should be your default go-to class when you're undecided.
---
Leveling is smooth. Doing single-target frostbolt leveling isn't super fast, but it's super safe. You never die to mobs or are really in any danger if you don't want to be. If it can be slowed/rooted, you can kill it. Want some change? Try out some AoE leveling.
---
Good at all types of content. Raids, BGs, wPvP, dungeons, solo farming, you name it. Always desired in dungeons. Always desired for raids. Can't speak for premade PvP though.
---
You can port to the northern part of your "off-faction" continent, and have good TP spots for your "home continent" for getting around. Free gold while you're afking in your major city from portals and food. Your gold farm is super easy and super rewarding, giving you time to do other activities.
---
The only downside to mages is their boring rotation as frost with nothing interesting going on like ignite or anything imo.
---
tru, but with him having i believe 36 hours respawn timer, there's pretty much always gonna be competition for him on every single spawn for all of classics lifespan
---
I only use the cannon hop of safety, when your group somehow pulls all the mobs from the VC area
---
‚Ä¢ NA-PVP

‚Ä¢ Looking to play Rogue/Priest.

‚Ä¢ Alliance preferred but will roll horde for a guild that suits my needs.

‚Ä¢ Looking to raid 2-3 nights per week, semi to hardcore player.

I raided in vanilla and on private servers. 30 year old, no wife/kids, pretty chill individual. Looking to play fairly seriously.
---
Add that fear doesn't break on damage and I'm in &gt;:)
---
Cookie is killed after VC.  Dont be selfish!
---
Also, this has nothing to do with private servers and more so about people trying to maximize efficiency.  It doesnt matter if it skips a mob, it saves time.
---
Some people enjoy doing things like that, some dont.
---
No. Before Rogue it's Hunter. Paladin and Shamans were never really that high up there compare to Warrior, Mage, Rogue and Hunter.
---
&gt;And yet a common moniker of Pservers is '0 armor bosses'...  So what is it?
---
People keep repeating this, but its just not true. Stop being dumb.
---
I mean, have you seen the video? As someone who never raided on private servers, I didn't realize speedrunning was a thing. Maybe that'll be the content after Naxx: speedrunning raids for endless replayability.
---
 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting all roles for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking being in a guild that formally schedules vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with mature, friendly, and skilled adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
**About Us:**
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves largely comprised of Vanilla and Private Server veterans who are excited about Classic.  We‚Äôve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured.  Our intent is to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic in order to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture geared toward our collective goals.  
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience.  Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS.  In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended.  In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks.  Please refer to the Charter at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this.  We won‚Äôt require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience.
---
Our goals are intensive, but we aren‚Äôt necessarily intense or strict in nature.  To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization.  We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to build a cohesive team of like-minded members.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesdays:  6:00 ‚Äì 10:00 p.m. PST
---
Wednesdays:  6:00 ‚Äì 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing a rotating raid attendance schedule.  With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
Pre-assigned loot sheet (see Charter for further details).
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are in our founding stages and thus far have recruited many outstanding players.

If you are interested in becoming a part of what we‚Äôre building please refer to our website at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter.  The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.

Thanks for reading.  May you find your perfect guild!

I played shadow on a private server for a very long time and raid naxx as one. The way I got my raid spot is by showing up in full prebis with consumes ready to raid. If you are truly dedicated to shadow a guild will recognize you and you will likely get a spot. I plan on playing as a shadow priest for the entirety of classic so if anyone wants to message me with questions about life as a vanilla shadow priest I‚Äôd love to help.
---
I 100% for sure helped with trash in AQ40 and Naxx (not often, but I did) as a feral/resto in Vanilla.
---
I mean I'm genuinely all up for research concluding that frontshredding and stabbing were consistently replicable by vanilla 1.12.
---
The bottom line is that some weird and glitchy-looking mechanics that pserver players have come to rely on are not gonna make it to Classic. Thank fuck for it too
---
The video that gives me the most nostalgia is nihilums AQ40 movie. I was 14 when that video first came out and it really made me want to start raiding.
---
That certainly isnt true. Mythic raiding or high level pvp does take skill. You cant possibly deny that. The problem is that no reward actually feels like progress anymore because everything gets soft reset any few months and hard resets every expansion.
---
Oh man, just seeing that Uldaman screenshot gave me the feels.
---
&gt; This person is literally admitting that he wants private servers to be "as wrong as possible" for selfish reasons.
---
They are allowed to want that. Who cares? It will either happen or it will not. Them wanting it won't make it happen.
---
Personally? I think it will happen to some extent, and it won't matter because WoW is a time sink more than it is a skill test. The people who sink the time in to play hardcore will outcompete the people who play fewer hours whether or not Classic is a close match to [insert pirate server here]. Classic getting a few things right that pirate servers got wrong isn't going to noticeably slow down people who are playing for sixteen hours a day.
---
I thought (from memory) that it simply said something like... ‚Äúreleased on or before Dec 31, 2019‚Äù
---
Because they have one of the few viable ranged CC, rogues have to spec to sap and not get face smashed, hunters cant throw traps, warlock/hunter offtanks work decent as long as they get enough healing but warlocks have to stop DPS to heal their VW. Fear is great depending on location but can create a wipe very easy, warrior/shaman DPS offtanks just mean extra healing and roots dont work in doors so good for maybe ZF and Dire Maul?
---
Check this out https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
That is the most hopeful thinking, it would be like saying "I know OJ probably was related to his wifes murder but, maybe she just kinda died you know? I mean that glove comeon guys."
---
Sounds good to me. And note, I said "warlock fears". I made no mention of a generalized diminishing returns on crowd control. Let those shadow priests die. :)
---
I wasn't refering to you, relax. Also, every country has schools. Most are free except universities.
---
Whats your excuse?
---
Eh.... I‚Äôm still banking on it releasing with 8.2 around the beginning of July in an attempt to shut down the Shadowbringers launch for FF14, Blizzard always releases a major patch or expansion within weeks of their direct competitors, 8.2 hasn‚Äôt been very well received by the retail community so it‚Äôs more and more likely they will drop them both together.
---
That will give them a big subscriber and revenue bump in Q3 which is notoriously horrible for MMOs because it summer and people like to be outside as well as being the most effective disruption of their only real competitors launch.
---
How would that be a trick? It‚Äôd be 100% truthful.
---
Be open to positive criticism, and that goes for anything in life.
---
And this is why you get all these private server apologist. They are fans of private servers, not of vanilla because they never played vanilla.
---
Vanilla is better guys, it's OK that private servers are not accurate.
---
I think there's a difference between "August 2015" and being a "Classic Summer". Just based on the context on the post, a classic summer infers x amount of days classic will be experiencing summer. Could be the majority of summer days but it's hard to tell, but it seems to lean towards more than just a day in summer like August 2015 for HS would have been.
---
Verdan for sure, I just forgot his name! That guy was HARD
---
It leaves open the illusion that the release will be earlier than it actually is.
---
no it's like saying - I know somebody in that family murdered Jane, but maybe it wasn't her husband Steve, but instead her father-in-law Jacob." maybe the bad guys aren't the ones you expect to be, but actually the people higher up the food chain. To think that developers would be able to decide if **Activision** Blizzard spends money on making a classic remake is naive.
---
Classic was in the works for a while. They (maybe 1 or 2 devs) had been working on it been working on it since before the shutdown letter to nost. 
---
It was a personal interest project of one of the devs to see if it could be done during his personal development time and presented to the company as proof that it could be done.
---
Thats my understanding from the dev interviews and the the different podcasts that classic was a no because it thought without much data it couldnt be done. 
---
I feel your statement on the matter is uniformed and needs clarification. 
---
From my undertanding brack was very attentive during the nost meeting and even mentioned that his statement was something he regretted.
---
Hence why he wanted to annouce it at blizzcon. 
---
These are all things that have been mentioned in the dev interviews, nost interviews, etc..
---
The hardest part about vanilla raiding is getting 39 other people that will show up on time and ready to go. If you're dedicated to your class/spec, then you'll be just fine.
---
Because you‚Äôre wondering why you‚Äôre being downvoted into an oblivion.
---
I agree with the above. I am just pointing out that a lot of the people here who go on about private servers being terrible/inaccurate are actually motivated by their own selfish desire to be competitive in classic, or be able to play their meme spec and never have to pay respec gold, rather than some real desire for an authentic Vanilla experience. This post just exposes it.
---
Where Eagles Dare : Misfits
---
I mean speeding running and low manning for parses has always been a thing in WoW raiding. One of the most fun times I had in Wrath for example was two healing Naxx 25 with a resto Druid before Ulduar released because she wanted a world first parse.
---
I don‚Äôt remember now if she got it.
---
I have not played BFA in five months so I do not know what patch they are on, but I always figured that they would release classic in a lull, or after the last regular content patch of expansion.
---
Is there a release date yet ?
---
Its crazy hearing those songs now (which I rarely if ever play or put on for myself) and instantly get flashbacks of the Ice giant elites in Winterspring ha. Gonna have to make an old school playlist for Classic for sure.
---
You will get a spot no worries. Despite the shortcomings of the spec, guilds struggle to even put together 40 people in the first place. As long as you put in the effort you will be sweet.
---
Blizz has come out with the release date like 2 months before the release before. So it's not something too unusual. Also classic is not a typical game they're making. Unless we're getting a better hint July 16th is still our best bet.
---
That just sounds like an oxymoron ‚Äúmodern classic player‚Äù these players don‚Äôt exist yet and you have no idea what demographics will end up playing classic.
---
It's usually because they read in other threads that many people were expecting a June or July lunch, but instead of replying directly to them in those threads, that person felt their message was important enough to make its own thread.
---
yeah but the new version with the buff is way more fun in pvp because it gives you some interesting target swapping opportunities....like say you're peeling for your support and notice you have 3 stacks...turn around and delete a clothie that will have effectively 0 armor...that type of stuff.
---
It might not affect the weapon damage component of SoC, but Ret Aura doesn't even do anything unless you're fighting Rogues and Warriors, who you match up well against regardless of your aura. Throwing two talent points into improving it is just a waste. 10% more holy damage is always useful.
---
People find issues with pretty much everything nowadays, for some reason.
---
this is pretty great! thanks for making this, its gonna be pretty useful

LF german speaking semi-progress raid guild! üá©üá™
---
- Preferences - [PVE / EU German / Alliance]
---
- Main - Warlock
---
- Expectations - Looking for a raid guild with a great mature community, while not loosing sight of efficiently clearing ALL content within a reasonable timeframe. Guild should have the ambition for a server 1st till 4th rank.
---
- Raid times - Absolutely flexible as long as it fits my 8-5 CET work schedule.
---
- About me - 27 years old - playing on / off since Burning Crusade release. Former raidlead and officer in Mythic guilds up to world rank 200.
---
You get basically zero exp in dungeons lol.  That's a terrible excuse for disliking this!
---
That's not what meta means at all. Meta means the metagame, the interaction of various higher level components outside of the game and how they impact your individual play. So an example of meta: people learn that warriors are op af in 1.12, warrior population increases, this makes rogue population decrease since rogues can struggle with wars in pvp and compete with them for raid slots, which then means that there's an opportunity for classes who are strong against warriors but weak against rogues.
---
This list is just skills that a player can use to improve their own play independent of what other players are doing around them.
---
This video made me kind of sad, I don‚Äôt like that my favorite game might get reduced to this. I can‚Äôt see myself partaking and I hope it remains a niche activity.
---
To clarify: I do not mind people playing the game the way they see fit but if a majority of people is speed running every aspect of the game it might impact my own enjoyment (less populated leveling zones, lvl 60 Dungeons, etc)
---
&gt; ‚Äúyou think you do, but you don‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
Yeah, it was a stupid remark but Diablo got it still worse with stuff like "shut up PvP guy" and "fuck that loser" Jay Wilson.
---
Sheep still is.  Sap is 90% chance to not break stealth, traps can't be re-applied in combat and feign is a crapshoot, and succubus is a little more difficult to monitor.
---
Plus, frost nova.
---
It's not just their CC either.  Mages bring single target and AoE DPS, as well as water for the healer.
---
this is SUCH a good album to play to lol. good choice

REEEEEEEEE
---
I hate the way forsaken look, it's why I never play them, the racial may be beast but fuck me if I'm going to stare at that shitty patchwork armor all day...
---
If I may go ahead and ask one, what is your opinion on including mind blast in your leveling roatation? Typically I go shield, mind blast, apply sw:p right when the MB hits, mind flay x2, then wand, repeat on next mob.
---
How do you keep the tank alive? And your healer in mana? 
---
Not even starting with the defense cap that your tanks will have issues reaching. And this will likely result in a one shot with some bosses. 
---
Heck you won't even have flasks and useful consumables.
---
From what i have seen, they use a 1 or 2 % Ironfoe.  Not alot of data about the proc and the few they have is conflicting and seem overpowered.
---
Just don't have lazy healers, unless you're against a boss with some kind of frenzy/enrage it's fine because being at the armor cap with 15k HP means crushing/crits are no problem.
---
Yep. Reliable spammable CC, counterspell for caster mobs to get them into melee, the most powerful AoE spell in the game (In terms of utility due to slow. Warlocks Hellfire do more damage), Water/Food, good single target DPS and portal out of the dungeon when done.
---
[Thrice - Image of the Invisible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI_-tpPCXnE)
---
Pretty much this whole album.
---
Bear tank is best as an OT since they do not need to share loot with Warriors (if your MT), are the best mitigation tanks in the game, and out-threat even DW Fury Tanks while still providing better DPS for single-tank fights.
---
The common fee for those are 1g on private servers. It's a legit way to make money just sitting in some busy hub like Silithus and sell portals all day.
---
Blizzard doesn‚Äôt care if people play WoW 8.2 or classic wow‚Äîthe important thing is they are subbed. 
---
Current wow players opting to play classic instead of 8.2 doesn‚Äôt impact sub numbers. 
---
Unless the assumption is loads of those who want classic would also sub for 8.2‚Äìwhich I think is false. Those who would resub for 8.2 will likely try classic, those who‚Äôre waiting for classic will probably not try BFA.
---
Getting classic out when it is done and done right makes the most sense from a long term perspective‚Äîas you will retain subs for years.
---
Can't wait for Hillsbrad Foothills tbh. I have been thinking of Orc Shaman, but I kind of want to beeline to Hillsbrad. Undead Rogue here we come.
---
Bruh you post on this sub like every day, who are you kidding.
---
That‚Äôs big oofs
---
Fair enough. But I don't think you can generalise from this one dude to everyone who is skeptical about how accurate pirates server are.
---
Especially since there seem to have been a lot of different servers with significantly varying degrees of accuracy.
---
One thing I think will happen, and will make a big difference in a way that hurts some pirate player egos, is that it will turn out that a *lot* of supposed pirate server player superiority is down to modern frame rates, bandwidth and ping. MC is going to be a lot easier for the average player now that the average player's computer can render it without turning the game into a slideshow. But I could be wrong and we will see.
---
Hi, /u/SwoftysPinky
---
I prefer dropping mine 1 at a time... like others have said there is only a case for 1-2 totems at a time in non raid settings. Even in raid you probably only using 3 most of the time. Plus they cost more mana then any other expansion for the mana pool you have available.

[EU-PvE] &lt;Dishonored&gt; [Alliance] is recruiting social enthusiasts for the upcoming Classic WoW which is coming in summer. 
---
About Us: 
---
- We are a social guild, striving for fun and social interacting.

---
- A nice and fun raiding environment, lead by an experienced raid-leader with leading PvE raids.
---

---
Honestly I'd stick with what you want to play and enjoy playing.
---
Right now it looks like I will be joining a guild that only uses the "good" specs. That is how it works out because I want raid times most European guild will not be offering, not because it has to be that way as far as I am concerned.
---
I remember playing druid i Vanilla, and raiding as 0-30-21 (HotW / NS) for all my tasks. I mostly healed, but did off-tanking and emergency tanking as well. It definitely worked. What exactly a bear can and can't tank well I don't know, but it seems weird to me to just give a blanket "no" to feral tanks.
---
I honestly think that was more of an innocent comment than people make it out to be. He wasn't trying to say "We know what consumer want better than you do, because we're better than you."
---
He was just trying to get people to realize that rose-tinted glasses are real. Seriously, play like any game from your childhood and you instantly realize you remember it looking 100x better and being 100x more fun than it is. It was just a terrible way of saying "We don't want to take a gamble producing something that could very likely just be another case of rose-tinted glasses."
---
And the thing is, its still possible he was right. I am SUPER pumped for Classic. But its 100% possible that a huge group of us go in and quit in less than a month.
---
LOOOOL you think people wont get butt blasted if there is even cosmetic changes? You could simply add a TOGGLE for old and new models as well as toggle for seeing peoples upright orcs or not and people would still complain and shout "NO CHANGES! SLIPPERY SLOPE!!"
---
Excellent! Very cool, I need to condense some of my bots down before adding even more but I love it
---
[The Taste of Ink - The Used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yIQSaJ_sw)

Can you have it return results with partial searches instead of exact match?  
---
Example: !thunderfury brings up no results
---
Avoid STV and you'll be fine.
---
[P.I.M.P - 50 Cent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVN0aVrPXyQ)
---
That was pretty cool, good job
---
You‚Äôre right. No release date yet that I know of.
---
Not going to be possible. At least not at a high level. Casual raiding sure, but you're going to get burnt out pretty quick.
---
Not sure if you've played vanilla before, the time commitment is totally different then retail.
---
[Where Eagles Dare - The Misfits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WoxLk2g4-w)
---
"There is not enough demand to justify vanilla servers"
---
from the wall of no
---
It's more likely that the actual reasoning is simply that these things take time to set up. By the time they announced it they already had a team working on it, that doesn't just happen overnight.
---
[Rhapsody - Dawn of Victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKq1et3t1GI)
---
One, of my favorites, btw.
---
My P server guild killed him day 18 with 32 people.  It's really not as hard as you think.
---
Meanwhile in Stormwind:
---
Level 3 warrior: hi can I have 2s for skills plz
---
Level 6 mage: can u help me quest
---
Level 9 paladin: gold plz
---
Yes!!
---
No because 99% of the time I'm using the mouse for my movement, and I come from being primarily an EQ player and the only way to strafe in that game was to use the mouse. So I never use the strafe keys, I always strafe with the mouse hence the keys aren't necessary to me.
---
This is a survey. This doesn't even relatively mean this is exactly what people are rolling or the whole population of people that's going to play and role or players who play for a bit and than quit. Never trust survey statistics.
---
[Du Hast - Rammstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3q8Od5qJio)
---
Pretty hard going disc as a druid
---
&gt;lol lazy healers!!
---
I'd rather not have a tank who frequently gets chunked for 40% of his health on every boss, and gives healers a heart attack, thanks.
---
&gt;15k HP
---
that's like, full BIS gear with absolute full consumes and worldbuffs in Naxx.
---
IE, not the norm.
---
Lmfao the rage formulas are not accurate on pservers. For tanks rage from incoming damage is wrong, which is why you'll never see 1.30 daggers being BiS at any phase. And dps warriors are far too powerful now due to Ironfoe's proc being very likely wrong.
---
Looking forward to this tbh lol.
---
Yes?
---
Pretty much, its really frustrating.
---
I guess it really depends on what you consider advertisement. Usually at this point in the process you can expect a release date, especially when your promised "time period" is in 90 days or so.
---
There has been no information on WC3:R since Blizzcon.
---
It's written right on the tooltip. Not my fault the Nost people have poor English comprehension or read a bad translation.
---
For one, I don't think many people would want to run super hard raids for no tangible reward.
---
Also, I really hope Classic doesn't become a game with a bunch of glitzy mounts and cosmetics. One of the reasons Classic is so rewarding is that the gear that drops from dungeons/raids is so valuable and sought after.
---
Circa Survive - Juturna
---
Between the Buried and Me - Self Titled
---
Coheed and Cambria - IKSOSE 3
---
and probably plenty of other hardcore/metalcore/emo records
---
Classic will be significantly easier than modern private servers. That will be a big surprise to the private server players. But I don't think this is the spice up you're thinking about.
---
what ?
---
That's right! Just a note, your translation while correct feels really unnatural as a response to the comment I responded to. All of the negation I used is the more common and natural way to express what I said, so be ready to hear it again someday.
---
I fought for years to get a Classic server only to be met by douchebags spamming the 'wall of No' and 'it will NEVER happen'.
---
When Classic was announced those same cocks are now saying it will fail, nostalgia, rose tinted goggles etc
---
Wonder what they will say when Classic becomes a huge success?
---
2019. You can expect more news come Blizzcon.
---
way more many times than I would've liked I've seen people demand food/water/portals from me for free and then they get mad when you ask them to at least pay for the rune, you surely meet some interesting people as mage
---
You'll definitely find a spot if you're highly active, show up consistently prepared, and are a good teammate. Spec comes after those 3 things.
---
It's also lore compliant. Take a look at the Underbog instance in the Burning Crusade expansion. Specifically, Windcaller Claw. To quote him "How embarrassing to be taken as a pet by a hunter! "
---
‚ÄúPolls‚Äù also backed Clinton and look where we are now :)
---
It's more like trying to compete in the actual Olympics, but cutting off one leg first
---
Only if I'm also allowed to stable you when I'm done.
---
People always say this but chain heal was yellow in wc3 so it never surprised me
---
Yes I will just make a new char until you release me back into the wild
---
Yeah I'm glad I remembered to copy them over after I got a new PC! I probably have 100+ screenshots, but not always interesting and mostly towards the end of Vanilla. Not very many pre-60.
---
It's the way it was and you'll love it!
---
PvP was not a big focus of WoW when it launched. We'll have the BGs before long. Until then, the Wpvp will be a shitload of fun my bro &lt;3
---
Because this is supposed to emulate classic as much as possible.  I play tons of pvp and am looking forward to the honor grind, but this is authentic to vanilla.
---
No honor at start, no bg's, when bg's we're introduced you had to run yo ass to ashenvale or wherever.
---
Besides, the first few months are going to be a grind fest for level and gear.
---
Hi, /u/sarinka78
---
Hi, /u/Lhamptolot
---
Sigh...
---
As a healer, Warlocks hellfiring is way worse than a Mage's frostbolt.  Not only does it not slow the enemies, but they take damage while casting it and they take damage from the hits.
---
I recently ran Gnomer with 2 warlocks, and I drank more in that run than I have in the next 6 dungeon runs combined.
---
I can post and not play.
---
Changes in TBC? TBC was the only expansion you could argue is better than vanilla. I think vanilla is better but I can see a TBC argument.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna launch this summer‚Äù
---
‚ÄúJust kidding it‚Äôs November now‚Äù
---
That would be a delay.
---
Next question
---
We are warriors 
---
born from the light 
---
an army for freedom 
---
defenders of life
---
True true. But private servers can be considered as quite alright indicator, and they give the same result
---
None of the current respected servers do. Also, source on them stacking on Nost?
---
Which hasn't happened
---
We don't care
---
I too thought I needed full Dreadmist before I could start raiding...
---
True true, but they do give some indication on what might be true. I mean its not coincidence warriors are most popular on this survey, and you must agree that they most probably will be. Same with druids. Theyre not off that much. And on another note, the data from private servers also suggests the same results that shamans are really popular.
---
I did this guy did. Had no problems. 
---
https://youtu.be/sFtgE6tjX6E
---
Im currently playing it on Retail starter edition right now cuz the add-on is only for retail atm.
---
Though if you want to try on private servers, all you need is a third party software - which i‚Äôm going to try next.
---
Yeah, I would really like the new models in Classic and I think they would have done it if not by the nochanges crowd.
---
I played Vanilla. I loved BGs in Vanilla. PVP was a huge part of Vanilla for me. Now I don't even know when the fuck it's coming out. That's some shit man.
---
That's how hemispheres work!
---
They sort of can but the private community is far more inclined to roll for optimisation and forward planning aka we will see very few NE rogues from those players but more NE rogues from retail and new comers.
---
That is true as well.
---
So you PvP just for the e-penis of showing of your rank and to get gear, not because you actually like it? Because you can PvP since day 1 sans those 2 things and battlegrounds but do you really only feel joy PvPing in a designated sandbox?
---
I don't need them to emulate how the game launched exactly. I want to PVP, not play an unfinished version of the game.
---
Lots of Basshunter and alternative rock :)
---

---
looks like it, likely early BC but still a nice old screencap
---

---
Evanescence - Bring Me to Life for all the emo/goth kid undead pvp montages
---
Isn‚Äôt it also true that none of the private servers know the true resist/armor/HP values that vanilla wow actually had?
---
Disco Druid is like Disco Stu!!
---
....I‚Äôll show myself out
---
By the time I get to 60 DKs will be in effect. 
---
What a waste
---
You can easily get well over 10k hp and armor cap with pre-bis and consumes. As for the healing, if you actually try it it's nowhere near as bad as you're imagining. Most healers prefer the quicker fights thanks to the increased threat.
---
supposed to? Wasn't that patched out during vanilla?
---
So, I am probably really late on this but is Vent not a thing anymore? Last, I played WoW everyone used Vent. I'm assuming it's now Discord?
---
This. I'm totally cool with parking my ass on the bridge in front of the AH and being a vending machine.
---
\^ This
---
World pvp during phase two is gonna be lit! Hopefully I'll be 60 and geared before then. There phases look good to me as someone who is PvP centric ü§∑
---
What happens after Naxx?
---
You said "PvE", for some reason.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs some good inflation since classic!
---
Good suggestion, Luckily we both will use different gear than each other so upgrades that come for either of us will go to that versus vendor or AH. And we do plan on doing the whirlwind quest for the warrior Axe once we are able to tackle it.
---
Yeah that rotation is fine. I usually go ham with MB if I have mage water while leveling. But I do the same thing as you. Sometimes I‚Äôll open with MB then SWP and wand until MB is off CD. It‚Äôs all situational honestly. Especially during phase one I want to be aware of my surroundings and not get caught oom and get ganked
---
No kidding. Nobody in this store thread has claimed there has been a delay, where are you getting that idea?
---
We‚Äôre just saying that even without a specific date the game can still absolutely be delayed.
---
Less than 10% of the players will be 60 during the first month so 50g is not a bad price.
---
Gold is so valuable during the early phase.
---
How come in every single vanilla screenshot I've seen, no one EVER has their keybinds set to something other than default?
---
Its pretty easy which demographics will stay longer after Classic launch.
---
I like PVP in battlegrounds yes. It's structured and I can fight people regularly.
---
I also like twinks, and I haven't been able to play a twink on official servers in years. Let alone a vanilla twink without all the heirlooms. It sucks that they're gating this content unnecessarily. In addition to that, going to BGs while leveling up was fun. Now that's not going to be an option until later. 
---
What good does it do to cut out battlegrounds from the game? What sense of progression would people actually get from that? It's not like raids where the next raid has better gear. PVP only ever got one epic set. 
---
I don't care about the honor system that much, so if they wanted to cut that at the start so people couldn't get PVP gear to raid in, I wouldn't care. But I want to play BGs.
---
I've "actually tried" healing bear tanks plenty of times. They take way more damage and much spikier damage as well.
---
Also no you cannot get "well over 10k" with "pre-bis", stop bullshitting.
---
My Mom randomly decided to take my son for a couple weeks this summer to give me a break. The dates she chose are July 9th - 23rd. I really hope they release it during that time.
---
Rolling Holy Paladin - NA - Alliance - Any Server Type
---
Cleared most raids minus Naxx. Pvp rank 7. Looking for casual raid environment (2 raid nights). Free anytime after 5MST. Dedicated to farming resist gear, attunements. Friendly and always willing to help others. Dungeons, pvp, raids, naked gnome runs all sound great!
---
I have no expectations other than playing with friendly people.
---
I'm one of the weirdos (apparently) that just listens to the game's music while playing...
---
Apparently not, since most/all private servers have it function that way.
---
Watch this and make your choice after.

Also subscribe to these guys, one the very few classic content creators that do not only play but are actually good and know what they are talking about.
---
If you agreed with this, you're just clueless. Ask the experienced people why this is a lazy decision. Ex: Arcanite Reaper has 0 value.
---
Also, you're going to grind dungeons and not upgrade some of those blues for a year.
---
Also, endgame content will be even easier. Everyone here dumps on BFA, lol guess what, that's what the raid content will be like in Classic. Vanilla raid content is already easy. Now it's going to be LFR-easy with no alternate difficulties. 
---
You guys really don't know what you want.
---
This is my thread, you go away
---
Or September 23rd..
---
I'm glad you're happy. Not sure why you need BGs to be gated months after release for you to be happy though.
---
I don't even give the slightest shit if the PvE content brings in "viewers".
---
Fuck right off.
---
Isn‚Äôt Blizzcon in November? Lol
---
we are warriors - freedom call (every warrior PVE &amp; PVP)
---
It sounds you don‚Äôt want PvP or authentic Vanilla as much as you just want tangible rewards. I‚Äôm looking most forward to phase 1 where any PvP will be done for the sheer sport of it. It really is an outdated concept in the modern gaming dopamine loop landscape.
---
You‚Äôre free to feel that way, just realize you‚Äôre not actually asking for PvP first and foremost.
---
Skill? You have way more challenging dungeons and raids than in Vanilla.  
---
Whats different in Vanilla is that after investing bigger ammount of time you will get what you exactly wanted.  
---
You cant have that in retail.  
---
But saying that Vanilla required SKILL is big yikes for me.
---
I want BGs. I don't care about rewards
---
You care enough to comment.
---
Hey folks, gonna be playing a holy paladin with a warrior and a mage. As far as pvp goes, what is the itemization like? I played a priest in tbc and wotlk, so I‚Äôm not sure about what stats are most important outside of Stam and int and crit. For instance, how important is hit rating for a healer?
---
I heard first time about this change. I think in this situation changes must be applied only to USA version (like no skeletons and bones in chinese version). In other part of the world people will not understand racist context of this word anyway. It is must be only local restriction for such words, if for american it sound racist.
---
I was with you until you supported sharding.
---
Ahem....https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1
---
Choke on that humble pie.
---
Also, do a bit research into WoW Emulation before you make yourself look even more silly.
---
I just farm the Eye on my mage and sell it on the Ah to anyone willing to spend a few hundred gold.
---
the same servers that got the warlock summoning wrong.
---
Getting 'World First' after that it is impossible
---
Haha you thought it would be released in June? I was counting on September 21st at 11:59:58 pm. A whole 2 seconds before fall starts. That‚Äôs only if they don‚Äôt have to push it back to fall or later.
---
some of the bosses have correct HP/numbers due to old pictures from vanilla or just knowing the information but yeah i think some bosses no one knows the true hp/armor or stat values of og vanilla
---
But how else will they cheapen our experience for profit?
---
yeah....they did. Go back and read the original announcement.
---
Can't speak for Princess but kiting Verdan in WC on a mangos base server, he didn't cast his roots unless someone was in range
---
Sooo, food4int?
---
Probably something along the lines of, "*I reject your reality and substitute my own.*"
---
No changes. 
---
Pservers are that way if you want battlegrounds right now. 
---
Classic phases are how the game was at launch, don‚Äôt like it? Welcome to not play it.
---
Vanilla takes more skill than modern wow. 
---
If you disagree, you haven‚Äôt actually played authentic vanilla...
---
Anything by Ronnie James Dio. Especially Strange Highways and Sunset Superman.
---
It surprised and annoyed me when I rolled one on a pserver last year and I gotta say making large amounts of gold from it never crossed my mind either lol. I don't like Mages enough to play endgame with them so didn't get to 60 but I got plenty of requests - enough for it to get on my tits.
---
If you're a huge fan of Mages and want to main one in Classic I wouldn't let it put you off though man. Whisper spam won't happen when you're in a 5man ofc or further afar farming or w/e. Hanging around in Grom'gol, LHC or by the Bank is a different matter. You can use all 4 extra bag slots for whatever you choose unlike some other classes so making extra stacks when you login won't hurt and will make trades quick for the lucky few you might want to say yes to :) 
---
If you're a Mage guy then I say don't let it put you off and just play Classic with a sick class and have a ball!
---
OMG CANNOT WAIT!
---
ah yeah sorry forgot ww.  its either MS+WW or BT+WW right?
---
The only issue I have with it is that you need to input the full name of the item you want to link, which means you're probably gonna google it to get the correct name which means you'd rather post the wowhead link directly.
---
Other than that it's a great bot, good job and good idea !
---
You're just an asshole
---
F1-F4 are my totems for the particular use case. Using that key binding makes them very easy to recast or cast on the move.
---
Not a problem at all
---
Yep I had a macro that explained the concept of opportunity cost lol
---
who cares about pets anyway they do like 50dps.  I plan on playing a hunter in classic with 0/21/30 spec and i'm just gonna spam the shit out of agility
---
tested it on a pserver and could get nearly 500 in tier0 and a few accessories, with no enchants or consumables and only a BoK.  that gives lots of hp, mana, and the 4% chance to restore 200 mana on auto attacks as well - as opposed to the "BiS" items which leave u with pitiful hp and mana and a measly 4-5% extra crit for your trouble
---
i think people have missed something there, but maybe i'm wrong
---
You can see the future? You think blizzard would make this if they thought only the hardcore pserver community would play? I think they might have some more insight than you on this no offense. Pretty sure they pay people to collect data to forecast if this will be profitable for them or not and I doubt it would be with only pserver people.
---
What happens after death?
---
The same thing.
---
Thanks for clarifying your position. Instead of asking for PvP, then, state BGs instead. PvP will in fact be alive and well in phase 1, and Blizzard is completely justified in scheduling it that way. You can‚Äôt have that vanilla taste without cracking open the whole bean.
---
Where do you think a good time to switch specs would be? T2+?
---
If you were here for vanilla launch you know that we didn't need an honor system to turn South shore into a warzone.
---
It's nice to get the rewards, but it wasn't necessary and we spent hours killing each other anyway

In the End by Linkin Park
---
In the case of a Druid. One of the biggest Disclaimers I can give you. Is that you will be doing 300% of the work of every one else to get about 90% of the result. That being said you can get everything to work except Boomkin if you are willing to put out the effort.
---
Bear tanking is in no way shape or form a meme. It's a T1 tank full stop. Warriors may be better on some bosses but Druids are better on others. That being said to get the average raider to accept that would be rough.

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**
---

Resto kicked priest ass in mc &amp; bwl.  Priests had to spec 30 holy to get a 3.5 sec heal, druids were born with it. Priest also had to chose between meditation and the reduced cast time talent while druids got reflection for free basically. Priests were just worse paladins in cloth with a spammable aoe heal being their only saving grace.
---
A lot of it is just for the purposes of recreating those earlier days of Vanilla, before all the organised PvP systems were put into place. But beyond that, people still did PvP before honour or Battlegrounds were a thing - and in fact, some people actually preferred the state of PvP before all the extra systems were implemented.
---
This is a brief chance for those players to return to their glory days, when PvP meant players from your own server fighting it out to assert factional control over some valuable area of the game, rather than being segregated off to some instanced area where nothing that you do has any actual impact on the game world. And whereas their days are numbered, yours are not. Assuming there is no major change in direction for WoW Classic, you have literally until the servers shut down to enjoy the game the way you like it, so don't rush. Be patient. Time is on your side.
---
Oxhorn was some of the first videos i watched on youtube.
---
I don't care about rewards. I want BGs.
---
Again, that's not how spell resist works. Its not calculated that simply.
---
There's no ilvl in classic. It makes the bar a little lower, and the fact that you need 40 damn people for most raids doesn't hurt. Just be sure to have fire resist gear. Don't vendor or sell it while leveling unless you have duplicates.
---
This sequel is poorly executed. Happy?
---
A fully geared Warrior is an absolute monster !
---
Saying that like South Shore and other places weren't active world PVP hotbeds well after BGs were released. Those days aren't numbered.
---
He wasn‚Äôt rude at all in his comment. You have issues.
---
I was afraid of that :(
---
T3 Warlock
---
There‚Äôs consensus that warrior scales the best with gear and is the most beastly with end game gear, provided we are talking about group pvp where the warrior has a healer.
---
Warlock also scales really well with gear, and t3 has great pvp itemization. If you are asking who is the best 1v1 in tier 3, I‚Äôd say warlock.
---
Surviving in STV IS the BG.
---
This is better. It encourages people to get to 60 before phase 2. It encourages WPvP until BGs come out. Phase 2 is gonna be lit!
---
You ignored the question. Again, you seriously think you'd notice a 1% difference in spell resistance without explicitly keeping track of statistics?
---
They're just joking. It just feels right to jump into a portal instead of walk in, for some reason lol.
---
I wouldn't generalize it to everyone. I was a bit aggressive to say this applies to "the average person" in the sub.  I have definitely had some productive conversations with people who are skeptical of private servers, but it is not the norm.
---
"One thing I think will happen, and will make a big difference in a way that hurts some pirate player egos, is that it will turn out that a lot of supposed pirate server player superiority is down to modern frame rates, bandwidth and ping. "
---
I mean even with modern frame rates and such ret paladins are still going to be bottom of the dps meters, warriors/rogues/mages are still on the top. These are the kind of things people pretend will change in Classic.
---
I don't think the average player who has never played this game before will have much trouble in MC. Its meant to be an intro raid, it always was pretty easy. But I do think that if your whole raid goes hard on consumables, MC will be alot faster, just like on private servers.
---
I'm not even getting BGs until phase 3, it's seriously bullshit. That was what I grew up on with this game. I want my nostalgia too.
---
Agreed, I main'd warrior in Vanilla.  Had Ashkandi and a patch work of armor and absolutely wrecked.
---
It's brilliant because by adding a whole new seperate world we can split the playerbase up and ruin the sense of community.
---
I think the fucked up difficulty curve in retail is the problem. 99% brainless solo content, 1% extremely hardcore guild content. Not much of a smooth transition.
---
You can‚Äôt just pick one mob that drops Flurry Axe. There are 110 mobs recorded that drop it.
---
But I have to wait for Phase 3 to get the experience I want out of the game. Meanwhile you could still get your nostalgic experience without Blizz gating BGs.
---
&gt;Classic phases are how the game was at launch, don‚Äôt like it? Welcome to not play it.
---
That's extremely rude.
---
I‚Äôd have to go back and look, but from memory white drops are generally on par with classic üëç
---
These countless threads are so stupid and repetitive.  Just play both and decide
---
No way it isn't delayed. I'm thinking it'll be out early 2020.
---
Defense cap is old news. They're using Fury specced dual wielding warriors in defensive stance to tank naxx now. The bosses die in a minute and healers spam max rank
---
but rogues don't even need gear (worldnof roguecraft ref)
---
"I'm taking my ball and going home!"
---
It's not the crits it's the cbs, druids usually have enough def to make crits fairly rare but they get crushed all the time. But that said, yeah, a string of crush crit crush is hard to heal thru.
---
Maybe be less self-centered and you'll be less of an angry child.
---
What's the official release date ?
---
brilliance&gt;ai
---
im already 60 ;\]
---
No offense but you are incredibly uneducated on the overall structure of classic to say this.  They just made a blue post last week about this on the forums you should read.
---
Ah yes, thats excellent and confirms my assumptions.
---
The most interesting bit is the multiplicitive nature of the stacking speed buffs with feral forms and ghost wolf. A nice little bonus move speed.
---
I have have all the HoA items still on my main. You couldn‚Äôt redeem them in game until TBC. That‚Äôs all I meant Mr Incorrect.
---
Unpopular opinion: they should scrap the whole TBC storyline after naxx and go down a different road into the Emerald Dream
---
More Naxx
---
For someone who has been away from the game since Cata, why was BFA considered to be the worst?   
---
I have a friend at work who has never played Vanilla or the early DLC's and he said people are leaving in droves, and he doesn't understand why.  
---
Worth noting, he himself is playing one of the Final Fantasy MMO's, but my lack of interest didn't allow me to remember which one.
---
+1 Int
---
SO WORTH THO
---
Well, i think its pretty safe to assume Classic isnt just typical cash grab.  
---
Until 2017, they were frequently asked about Vanilla and their answer was always big nono combined with systematic attacks on Pservers. That was about money.  
---
Its not like forecast would change 180 degree in 1 year, there had to be something on top of raw money.
---
Got a link?
---
1v1 it's warlock. hands down.
---
SL is the only spec in the entire unbalanced vanilla mess that is outright banned from duel tournaments.
---
Retail takes more skill than vanilla WoW.
---
If you disagree, you haven't actually played authentic retail. 
---
High end mythic raiding is far and away more difficult than anything Classic will have to offer in 2019, that includes Naxxramas. I love vanilla, but don't delude yourself.
---
At least for the twink part, It'll take a while to get to 60 and farm all of the gear for your twink, so once you get a maxed character (which is usually pretty required to make a maxed out twink anyways) you can start farming the gear for it and then have one ready for when they do release BGs. That's what I plan to do atleast.
---
I‚Äôd rather have them at launch, but it‚Äôs not the end of the world for me. I plan to world pvp more than anything even after they come out.
---
Then please provide more details about how you obtained your numbers, and show us your work so that it can be peer reviewed. So far all you have done is paste numbers without showing where you got the data from and without showing what kind of math you did to come to your conclusion. For all we know you put the decimal in the wrong spot but since we don't have **ANY** of your work we can't see if you made any egregious errors. And it is quite obvious that you have made some egregious errors.
---
If bags really drop 100x more on Private servers then I would expect to have looted anywhere between 100-200 6-slot bags before level 14 on a Private server, because I certainly had at least 2 by the time I made it to Barrens on my first character during Vanilla.
---
If you really "did the math" then you should be able to show your sources and your work without all these vague responses.
---
If you "can't just pick one mob that drops Flurry Axe" then **show us the work you did to collect and compile the data from all 110 mobs that drop Flurry Axe**
---
&gt; Blizzard has done this trick before. 
---
And the EU closed Beta, they said they would release it by end of September and they did.... on the last day of the month at 4 min to midnight. 
---
We actually got a EU only world event out of it, Peon Day
---
ok
---
IIRC it caught win on r/all when people thought it was racist but it was just a video game thing
---
I mean.. aq had a shitton of feral gear, too much really.
---
As someone that picked up a char on a private server a month ago, I can tell you that the game definitely still holds up and I plan on going to 60. Then switching to classic and doing it again.
---
Celebrity presidents have been a thing for 150 years...
---
&gt;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049
---
This doesn't contradict what I've read about PVP up to now. Gating BGs until phase 3, MONTHS after Classic is released, is ridiculous.
---
Warlocks have a similar problem, but everywhere. Bitches want free summons and don't have 2 people lined up to assist.
---
that's not entirely true, there are raid tiers and it goes from a joke to super tough. Normal is still pretty easy but idiots can wipe where heroic but mediocre and can easily wipe poor players.
---
Then you have Mythic + dungeons that basically scale up the difficulty level of the player.
---
There's not a lot but saying it goes from brainless content to extreme hardcore is disingenuous
---
Until you download that addon with the arrow pointing to quest locations.
---
Hi, /u/blagil
---
Vanilla took more planning and more socialization.  In no way did it take more skill.
---
You don't think it was until after?
---
You think it wasn't until after?
---
You need parses from actual Vanilla retail then. Private servers are all coded differently and have never actually matched what real WoW used to be.
---
You can pvp from day one, you just won't have rewards for it :)
---
I blame mob scaling. It made the entire progression as a character worthless.

&gt; But any type of paladin with a warrior or rogue can beat any two warriors or rogues in a fight over an objective. 
---
Now you are suddenly changing the goal post from 1v1 to a small skirmish that fits a tailored matchup you just created. The more structured the PvP becomes, the less value a ret has. But if you keep fighting into a ret they are obviously strong.
---
I don't know what game you are talking about but it sure isn't vanilla WoW. First of all Greater heal is 3 seconds untalented and drops down to 2.5s on the second talent tier. Besides Greater heal wasn't even used that much and people were downranking with heal. I don't know what you are on about meditation.
---
Coo
---
I DM'd you.

---
Again, you are uneducated on the structure of classic wow, and seem unwilling to learn.  You just made this post to vent; and that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt try to pretend like you fully understand why it‚Äôs not being added and you deserve different.
---
As someone who plans to continue playing modern WoW alongside classic, I truly cannot wrap my head around the ‚Äúwall of no‚Äù crowd. Never have I seen a group of individuals so vehement in their insistence that not only do they disagree with opinions opposing their own, but that said opinions are flat-out objectively wrong without as much as a single shred of validity.
---
Just‚Ä¶ why? Why is it so important to these people that a game that they will feel zero impact from not exist/fail/etc? Their level of investment in the topic is beyond insane and defies logic.
---
Nothing feels better than proving the haters wrong.
---
I don't even know if the game without BGs will hold my attention long enough. I really liked Vanilla back in the day, but I never played without BGs. Just sucks.
---
I'm really hoping my battle.net friends list is no longer filled with x years since last login once classic is released
---
Because they saved it in the back pocket incase they fucked up big (which they did) and lost a huge ammount of players ( which they also did) so they could put out classic and all the old players will squee like school girls and come back to paying theyre mounthly fee, that way blizzard can afford to make like 5 games ever. I swear theyre taken pages out of runescapes book... which is ironic because copying wow was what almost killed runescape in the past .
---
I don't know the guy's name, I'll have to go back and look for it, but he made a video explaining how hes going to level 1-60 by just killing boars (not level 1 boars obviously) and its very interesting. Kind of like restricted ironmen in oldschool runescape but a WoW take on it.

Fully Naxx Geared Warlock is probably THE best in the whole game, especially in PVP
---
Don't try to pretend like BGs would have any effect on what you want to do.
---
LFM for DM
---
Yes, because the difference of 1% is not as small as you think. 5% resist and 6% resist are two different numbers, and when factored into an equation will yeild two entirely different results.
---
Therefore, you will notice a difference between 1% spell resist, because of how dramatically that extra 1% can shift the ending value of the equation.
---
This is something i can definitely get behind

Hey, everyone! I started playing WoW during Wrath when I was in middle school, but quit during MoP. After not playing for years, I started playing on vanilla pservers and fell in love with the game all over again. I'm super excited for Classic, but unfortunately not super experienced with endgame content. Once Classic drops, I'm planning on changing that. This is my time to go hard into raiding and PvP, and I'm looking for a guild that would offer that! I'm a support caster at heart, so I will be maining either a priest or a shaman. So anyway, here's some more details:
---
*Region: NA
---
*Server Type: PvP
---
*Faction: Horde
---
*Playtimes: Flexible, EST
---
*Priority: Raiding, but a PvP element would be great too, as well as a solid social atmosphere
---
*Contact: PM
---
LFG NA 
---
-Alliance preference not necessary.
---
-PvP Server preference
---
-Play Times: college student so over the summer I can play everyday next semester I can raid everyday except Thursday I am west coast based but don‚Äôt mind Eastern times.
---
-Guild Preference- I enjoy raiding and my experience is clearing all content in wrath and getting cutting edge when I played current WoW. That being said I would also like to go for grand marshal, but isn‚Äôt my main focus like raiding
---
-Class: Priest
---
-Contact: dm on reddit or Swope#6951 on discord.
---
You can even drag some level 58/59's in, if I'm remembering correctly. I know we had some people that hadn't quite yet hit 60. But they knew how to decurse and that's all that mattered at the time haha
---
Lucky for me.
---
I did Loremaster achievement in wrath before the cata revamp.
---
Not saying i remember every single quest on the top of my head.
---
But i have did ALL what 278 Eastern Kingdoms quests and all 290 something for Kalimdor ( not exact number i know each contenient had bout 300 quests and the achievement wasnt broken down into individual zones yet)
---
Idk why you need paladins to be bad. They really aren't. Most pvp isnt 1v1 and the hybrid specs make awesome supports. No need to try to trash them.
---
I dunno bout the Hyoe train.... BUT IM HERE FOR THE HYPE TRAIN!
---
.,!?:;-()‚Äô‚Äù{}~
---
My wife and I are currently looking for a potential guild.
---
NA (Mountain Time)- PVP - Alliance 
---
My wife is looking at playing resto Druid or holy paladin
---
I will be playing warlock, but can fill multiple slots if necessary.
---
Our experience;
---
We started in Vanilla, but we did not have the endgame experience.  We have played all of the expansions and have held leadership positions (RL/Officer) since BC.  We have raided both hardcore, (5-7 days a week depending) and casually.
---
Firstly, we‚Äôre looking for an environment that is conducive to the development of friendly relationships that are based off of respect for one another.  We would like to be able to feel that our contributions matter to the guild while being able to have fun and successfully clear content.  We‚Äôre looking for an environment where the leadership is transparent with all decisions regarding policies/loot/raid slots.
---
If we were raiding, we would be looking for a casual raid environment raiding weekday evenings, (6PM-11PM MST.)  We would prefer to remain casual due to balancing our work/life.
---
Thank you for your consideration.
---
Good advice, for the most part, I think we are pretty good staying in the sink. Someone will get a couple of bars ahead but in the long run, it won't matter. And we are both IRL friends who work together and use Discord for all our games so we are good to go there.
---
Did you try if it works for you in icognito / while you are not logged in? I tried on multiple devices. Maybe it's only available for the sheet owner.

Is from a raid?
---
There is a big difference between a celebrity who appeared in tv shows and played a character on WWE who took a stone cold stunner. A difference between a celebrity who is solely "famous" because they have money.
---
And a person who was already a famous leader in the military or a famous because he helped found the country. A difference between a man who is famous for his deeds and actions as a leader. 
---
I'm not shouting "ORANGE MAN BAD!" or anything, there are no real politics in my post, but you'll be hard pressed to convince me that Washington or Lincoln, leaders prior to becoming president are on the same fame level of Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump.
---
Well stated, and I resubbed a few days ago to farm up gold to get those free months of sub (didn't buy BFA cause fuuuuuuuuck that, I want to save money).
---
Neat-o
---
*checks your level*
---
That Crossbow will not be available until phase 3, at the earliest.
---
TLDR- 10 minutes of talking about pserver speedrunning for youtube bux
---
Boss fights will be significantly shorter because the bosses won't be overtuned like they are on private servers.
---
Try not to use private server info for reference, many things are likely not right.  I trust blizzard with their source code.

---
Yes, but they do know within 99% accuracy. Don't believe TipsOut when he claims they have "no idea what the armor was".
---
There's heaps to do and all of it feels bad
---
The classes are all homogenized and lack depth
---
The gear grind is 200% RNG - like Diablo, but with 1/10 of the amount of drops
---
Azerite gear is truly awful
---
The story is a mess (from what I've seen over at /r/wow)
---
Even leveling from 110 to 120 feels bad. Your character feels weaker by the final level
---
There is some good stuff; the game looks really nice, each zone has its own personality, and despite leveling up to be weaker, it was really streamlined and quick which I didn't mind. The music's good. And waycrest manor is one of my favourite dungeons. But overall the expansion just doesn't feel rewarding enough, or enjoyable enough, like none of the actual game mechanics have any soul but are instead only there for the sole purpose of taking time so that you have to stay logged in and subscribed.
---
The most well rounded OP is probably Warlock. Warrior takes 1.00001 place, though.
---
Both are scary fully geared. Like SCARY, scary.
---
Oh they over tuned the bosses? Across all pservers?
---
Nice, I can't wait to die
---
Has blizz actually said it's going to come out in 2019? Maybe they meant a Classic (2020) Summer. :(
---
I wish I could answer both my comments but you win. 
---
The question is, how do I gear from the start? I assume this is pre raid and good luck finding crit stats there. Int just wont do the trick.
---
Post Nax -&gt; TBC without flying mounts and a bunch of added bridges
---
I approve.
---
Locks also got banish that cc's demons/elementals.  Useful in some instances.
---
True to the exact digit, no. But a very close estimate based on 10 years of analyzing combat logs, screenshots and videos.
---
Some of the most recent servers even decided to inflate armor and HP values to "counteract" the poor balance of the game in an attempt to make it a little more challenging. Which didn't prevent the best guilds to clear BWL in half an hour. All of this is explained by Ohgee in his video.
---
The popular belief on this subreddit is that private servers are all over the place, ran by some russian mob in a basement, because it's trendy to hate on pservs and their player base. But as someone who began playing on some scuffed private servers not long after TBC release I can tell you, private servers these days are incredbly close to the real deal. I would go as far as saying that it's possible that private servers will "feel" more Blizzlike 1.12 vanilla than the backported Classic modern 8.X client which will improve on a ton of things and might not feel as clunky and authentic as the original game we played. Which is not at bad thing in itself, but I will miss the clunky AI of mobs and moonwalking for sure. :D
---
And we are finally back to where we started. As you so put it - A complete circle.
---
It would.  World pvp is a very prominent part of vanilla.  On a fresh server having everyone out in the open world instead of sitting in cities creates a lively kind of ecosystem.  I doubt you know the joys of real world pvp and community involvement .  Here‚Äôs a scenario:
---
Level 45 alliance player is killed by a group of 3 horde of the same level in tanaris.  The alliance player asks in general chat if anyone would want to group and get revenge + complete the quest.  Eventually this is a 10v10, depending on how old the server is. 
---
That‚Äôs fun.
---
I'll probably just mod the new skins in myself if I have to.
---
If you have proof that it's not right, you should go ahead and report it on bug trackers.
---
Hey don't get me wrong, it still happens from time to time and when you do just obliterate someone like that it feels soo good.
---
But about 4/5 times you will only hit once, and not very hard. Then you're in for a corpse run. Again.
---
Okelee dokelee
---
They must have been demo, cuz I think RoF does more dmg if destro.
---
And that is the exact spec I plan to play on a pvp server. 
---
Witness me!
---
World PVP was still very very alive in 1.12 even. Lol
---
Again, BGs wouldn't affect you. Keep telling yourself they would though.
---
It can be done, but it‚Äôs far more difficult a ‚Äòproper‚Äô spec.
---
okay
---
Because it's not a new ip. It's not on the same track of development they take for their other ip's. It's s re-release of game files. It's more of a glorified patch
---
In PvP, shadow priest is very strong.
---
In PvE, you‚Äôll blow through mana faster than anything. You have next to zero sustain, it‚Äôs kind of a meme spec for raiding. A raid might bring one, but with the debut limit, shadow weaving may not be as welcom.
---
Just means you aren‚Äôt doing DMN dog packs.
---
Ah you're right this was right after tbc launched. I started up a few months before (still classic) and never made it to 60 of course before the xpac released. Wish I had some earlier pics.
---
I'd love to hear/read the source for this information!  I haven't heard it before now.  Anyone know where it's from?
---
Yeah I remember this happening to me on my lock.  I'd get a /w asking me to join someone's party temporarily so that I can summon people for them.
---
I'm going to miss the upright orc posture.  
---
My one issue with male Horde was everyone, EVERYONE was hunchbacked.
---
Makes me sad seeing first winterveil and then the second one....
---
RIP friends who haven‚Äôt been online in years.
---
We are in accord, then.  I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in your group either.
---
There's plenty of gear from MC/BWL! But definitely less than other classes. 
---
[Taladril's Gear List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#)
---
I never said paladins were bad, but I stand by that *ret* isn't very effective.
---
Lmao my boyfriend has a shirt that says that and he's one of the classic haters! Hahaha
---
To compare, once again, with old school rs: the idea is to release content in line with players wants. This player base will not want retail content beyond tbc or wotlk so hopefully its just entirely new content after vanilla or tbc/wotlk if they go that route
---
Sure, in that theoretical situation there could be a sizable difference. WoW's spell resistance doesn't work that way though. With the way the resistance formula actually works, if you have something that just straight up gives 1% more resist chance then it's exactly what I said earlier, your resist chance will be X+1% instead of just X%.
---
If you have something that increases a resistance stat by 1% then it's not much different. Lets say two lvl 60 entities with the defender having 300 resistance towards the element of the incoming spell. The formula would be Average Resistance = (300/300)*0.75, meaning 75% resistance. Now lets say the defender's resistance gets increased by 1% to 303. (303/300)*0.75 gives 75.75% resistance. Funny, that's actually *less* than 1% difference, but spell resistance can't go above 75% so it's still just 75%. Let's say the defender has 150 resistance instead. (150/300)*0.75 gives 37.5% resistance. Increase the defender's resistance by 1% again, 151.5, and then you get 37.875% resistance. Weird, that's still even less than an actual 1% increase.
---
So in actuality, I was being *generous* by going with just a straight 1% spell resistance increase. The gain you would get from one of your resistance stats being increased by 1% is in fact far smaller than just a straight 1% increase, making you even less likely to notice it.
---
So again, a 1% increase to a character's spell resistance is literally never going to give an actual difference bigger than 1%. You're flat out wrong and the example you just gave makes me think you didn't actually know what the spell resistance formula was before typing it out.
---
I think the only reason they are open to making Classic WoW now is because World of Warcraft is coming to an end. Back a few years ago, if they released Vanilla it would be a direct comparison to retail and they would probably hurt their retail numbers even more because Vanilla is super fun and unique
---
Effective at what?
---
Imagine thinking activision/blizzard would release a project with a projected loss. Double digit IQ
---
Good read
---
I share your excitement. I've purchased every xpac and all the newer ones have held my interest for less and less.
---
You can cap the lockout (5x runs) in &lt;15min so although you have to come back later to do it again, the actual farm time is pretty low. 
---
If you're alliance it's so close to IF the travel time is negligible.
---
Shoodles
---
I notice no one mentions healing is a fun aspect.  
---
I just enjoy healing. It's like it's own mini-game, while trying not do die to fight mechanic at the same time.   
---
I wasn't aware of how good Shadow Priest was until recently, so that's a big pro for leveling, as I can World PvP than switch to Holy at end game.
---
WoW has been steadily getting worse since Cata was released. 
---
-They have done everything in their power to make having friends irrelevant. This is the antithesis of an MMO
---
-Questing has been on rails since Cata. That's fine for a FPS but not fine for an MMO.
---
-PvP is a god-awful mess. All the classes are bland, homogenized, and watered down. They are also somehow wildly imbalanced. It's almost like they put effort into making PvP terrible on purpose.
---
So questers, PvPers, and social players have NOTHING to do in this game. Believe it or not most people aren't 100% laser-focused on raiding so this puts a very low cap on your potential player base.
---
TLDR: They dun goofed.
---
This "maximize efficiency" mindset is something I just don't understand. It's a game damn it! And a game by definition is an inefficient use of time unless your objective is to relax and enjoy yourself.
---
lol.  Do some world pvp bruh
---
Ok thanks for the advice. I think I saw somewhere you can turn off trading? I think thats what bugs me about it, if they ask me and engage then im sure I will but just trading first or water plz is when i would get annoyed.  Of trading me while im fishing!
---
This was around level 30, I don't think RoF gets much boost by then.  Even then I think most boosts to RoF would also affect Hellfire.
---
You are both right. In theory its exactly as you say, the curve does exist and is managable. But in reality that isnt exactly the case. People always pick the easiest route as well as not doing stuff they dont see any point in. Thats human nature. So while in theory these different tiers of difficulties exist, people just skip a lot of them to get easy gear. Warfront caches, world boss, m+ cache, etc. So they obtain gear that is not even remotely suitable for the level of play they are engaging in. So now they are in a position where only mythic raiding offers a sensible upgrade - yet they only have lfr experience. Can we expect these people to grind their way through 2-3 difficulty tiers to learn the mechanics as well as adjusting to actual raid environments while not receiving anything meaningful? Not really.
---
Ion here.  Your concern has been noted and I've consulted with the entire classic team.  KRISPYBOI WANTS BGS RITE AWAI.  BG PHASE 1 CONFIRMED.
---
You have the sources. 
---
The classic percentage chance comes from total drop from total recorded deaths. 
---
Mob loot is calculated at spawn.
---
He wants rewards.  He is just too shy to admit it.  The big sheriff badge for Mr krispii
---
They will release it around the period of the FF XIV expansion
---
They think mobile is smart... But it isn't.
---
I guess you've never tried mythic dungeons?
---
Thank you, I was starting to think about rolling a druid in my mind but I'm okay now.
---
Check out retail.  Bgs galore
---
If I was raid leading once mc was on farm.
---
You've been asked several times to show your work and you continue to refuse. Is it any wonder why most people in this post believe that you're just trying to sell copies of your guide?
---
It's possible that Brack came around by the time they had the Nost meeting. It's also possible that there were others who were chiefly against classic and Brack was just the messenger. 
---
Either way, it's hard for me to buy into the "it's too much of a technical challenge" argument as the main blocker for Classic. If a single dev was able to take it on in his/her personal time, it kind of shows that it was always very feasible.
---
People play for different reasons.  You play to relax, I play to maximize my character in ever way shape and form.  Some people like speed running things.  I personally never do this, because it's only like a 2 min save at most.  But I understand the mindset.
---
However trying to get a group of pugs on board for this is a terrible idea.
---
One reason why I‚Äôll be rolling mage this time around. That paired with enchanting and tailoring I should make a decent chunk through bags, enchants, and portals.
---
I believe most of the information is from the soirces as followed.
---
the first interview with nano from nost i believe done by classiccast; has the information regarding j allen brack and some of the pre work. Its the one where he shows his slides and visit to blizzard hq.
---
The last interview with nano on classiccast has a little more information more on the timeline
---
The dev interview at blizzcon stated that it was a personal interest project and elaborates more on the timeline. 
---
I believe there was a pc gamer or german interview possibly ?vox? with Ion where he states it was originally to see if it could work and that once presented as a possiblity they put more devs on it. 
---
If you check out these sources they will give you timeline like i proposed. 
---
I honestly feel the throwaway comment of "you think you do but you dont". While a bad demonstration of understanding a fan base. Had some real meaning with the amount of changes asked for since annoucement.
---
I prefer it to be a museum piece and left as 1.12 with everything out forever. After a normal progression obviously. 
---
I hope this stops your hatred for a man you barely know.
---
This! I'm also sick of all the art and memes... No one talks about the game!
---
Can setup your ability bars to match your naga buttons too for easier reference. https://imgur.com/VRgoc2r
---
I'm okay with that.
---
Would've been good if they actually made you use the pet in a smart way, like needing to pull him back out of aoe or it dies and then you're fucked. But yeah, it definitely focuses heavily on kiting. Makes sense since that's where a lot of the skill of a hunter is shown.
---
Yeah, the fact that they're not releasing a date means that they're not trying to rush a product out. They want to take their time to get everything right.
---
Then you started playing vanilla WoW after BGs were released. If you want to replicate that, then wait and start playing WoW classic after BGs are released.
---
Compared to warriors, rogues, mages, and warlocks, hunters just don't scale as well. They are still needed for their utility though, and good hunters who actually weave raptor strikes into their rotation can compete in dps. BU those are rare, most want to sit back where it's safe.
---
Rares arent even rare in retail. Nothing is special anymore, and that's the problem.
---
Tight dawg
---
Pservers have gotten numerous things wrong, s your guess is as good as mine. I‚Äôd err on the side of caution and say that those values are incorrect.
---
Agreed. I don't think the only other release of a game so far StarCraft 1 had a beta. I could be wrong though.
---
Hell year yeah it is.  DM released before Dire Maul did.   Dire Maul always has another letter in its acronym, or the word spelled out depending on which side you‚Äôre running.  DM East, or DM E for example.
---
That doesn't sound like any version of WoW I've ever played.
---
With how many POM mages there are gonna be.... nothing quite like grounding 2 pyros with 1 totem
---
Nobody cares.
---
The first day of autumn is September 1st. Summer is June, July and August. You people with these weird summers. :)
---
I like the upright orcs tho.
---
Why do you think that melee classes were under-tuned on private servers? I was under the impression that they were the strongest dps already.
---
This is so untrue lol.  
---
Stop spreading lies.
---
Gear is important as enhance.  Get a good weapon and your life becomes a lot easier
---
As a spec. Everything. It's good at dueling.
---
Competitive? PvP, don't care about competitive pve
---
Druids struggle to main tank, but there‚Äôs only 1 main tank in a 40 man raid anyway so you‚Äôre pretty unlikely to main tank even as a warrior. You‚Äôll easily get invited to groups as resto, the most hardcore guilds don‚Äôt bring many resto druids but it won‚Äôt be even slightly a problem for 90% of guilds or pugs
---
More EXP iirc
---
The wall of no crowd really irritates me. Why not have Classic? You have retail go play that. Let the people who truly know how great Wow is have Classic. Maybe it will end up saving Retail in the long run. Sometimes I think those people only rejected Classic because of their precious collections of mounts and pets bought on the store and they are worried Classic would somehow devalue them. I do wish transmorg **earned** in Classic transferred to retail though.
---
That's a huge lowball.
---
I don't think it was the plummeting subs that made them change their mind. When it was announced, Legion was doing relatively well. It wasn't until BfA completely shit the bed that subs nosedived into the ground.
---
I think what people used to say was Blizzard wouldn't always get it right the first time, but they would never give up on a game. Always would fix/support it till it was great.
---
First day of Fall in Northern Hemisphere is Sept 23rd.....so technically they could drop it Sept 22nd and still be "Summer".
---
Bet your fun to be around.
---
Disagree. Vanilla was difficult due to accessibility of communication and information.   
---
Yes, mobs hit harder. Our characters in Vanilla were not heroes, they were adventurers that slowly, but progressively got stronger.  
---
Dungeons were unnecessarily long, with creatures that hit hard, however, get a remotely competent group and they will rofltomp their way through it.  
---
Even Vanilla raid weren't hard in the sense of mechanic. The boss was just strong, punishing players for a single mistake. In Retail, mistakes mean less, but encounters are getting much more complex, so you're more likely to make mistakes.
---
Sharding is fine. It's a necessary game element to smooth out the starting zones. You wont see it again after you cross in to Westfall / The Barrens.
---
&gt; DM E for example
---
That's what I always use for Dire Maul LFG and I still get lowbies asking to join...
---
Kill yourself
---
Bad class design, bad loot design, bad reward structure, heaps of RNG, frustrating content invalidation from patch to patch (I stopped playing in October as one of the best geared players on my server... I'm now ~50 ilvls behind the top tier players).
---
I think the content in BfA is okay, but the systems design is worse than it's ever been by a wide margin. It has all the same problems Legion had, but none of the good designs that helped you to overlook those problems in Legion.
---
Players are generally polite so have no worries there. Rude ppl are few and far between in my experience both in vanilla and on private blizzlike servers.
---
The ppl who describe the general populace of private severs as toxic and elitist btw are talking shit. We all love vanilla and we all want the same thing and need each other to make our experiences good ones! 
---
Oh and trading cannot be turned-off
---
Right on
---
I know like 25 people who are gonna play at launch. It feels like everyone who ever played WoW and still plays video games is going to try it. I‚Äôd be shocked if it doesn‚Äôt hit 5 million plus unique players in the first few weeks. I think it will level out way below that, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it even gets closer to 10 million by the end of the first month. It‚Äôs going to be a huge moment in the gaming community, and twitch/Reddit will make sure everyone knows about it. Regardless of the long term popularity/health, that first week or two is going to be a spectacle.
---
And they have that guy a promotion.
---
Hi  
---
Decided to make a survey to find out how progressive/conservative the r/wow population is.     
---
I am aware that many of these are a no-go from Blizzard, but I wanted to see what the community thought anyways.    
---
Enjoy :)
---
Right? I also couldn't give a fuck about realmplayers or speed running raids. Who gives a fuck which priest gets the most overheals on their way to finish the raid?
---
there are people who will defend Blizard and their decisions to the grave, likely because the company gave them many years of happiness. I can understand it to a point. 
---
They rejected the idea of Classic because Blizzs current vision for the game was the one and only and after Blizz announced Classic they cried about it to save face, they don't want to be proved wrong.
---
You're talking about reward vs effort, the conversation was purely about difficulty of BFA, or at least that's what I was referencing
---
Unless I'm completely misunderstanding your post, your idea is predicated on damage per mana being an important metric in regards to healing warlocks who are tapping. In reality with downranking and consumables, it isn't.
---
Also, please let me know if I'm using an incorrect value based on what you've seen from an alternative, reputable source and I will update the spreadsheet.
---
Wait... did they give us a date? What day is this? I need to take that week off of work. Fuck my Christmas break. I'm using those days for Classic.
---
Druid, hear me out...
---
1) Leveling to 60 is a bitch, leveling is fun for a time but it's hard work. For most classes you get to 60 and you're either a melee or a caster, healer or DPS or tank. If you're a druid at 60 you can melee DPS, or caster DPS, or tank (instances), or heal with the best of them. You can have 4 sets of distinct armour and do whatever you want any given day. You can be that guy that everyone goes to for help in any situation. 
---
2) Mobility. The most mobility. Great for everything - PVP, PVE, leveling - EVERYTHING.
---
3) CC resistance. Polly is nothing to you, you can shift out of slows, you can escape any situation like fucking Houdini. A good druid of either faction can out pace and escape anything. If I don't want to fight a fight I simply dont. 
---
4) You get a heal as a melee DPS (Feral) which is unheard of for rogues or warrs 
---
5) Battle Res, not as used as a straight res but I've single handedly saved a 40 man raid with it and there's no better feeling in all of World of Warcraft. Also inervate can save a raid and make a healer your IRL best fiend. Also decurse. 
---
6) Not well played by many, misunderstood by most.
---
7) Stealth. If you've played rogue for at all you can't play any other class but druid, stealth is too fundamentally amazing. I feel naked when I can't stealth in PVP. 
---
No other class has the fluidity of play that druids get or the funtionality, and were expected to ignore it all because you'll never be able to beat out classes that can literally only do 1 thing? Rogues, Warriors, Mages, Locks (later) - do more damage but they can't rez as all, can't innervate, only mages decurse, etc. 
---
Just because you're a DPS doesn't mean you can't heal, just because you heal doesn't mean you can't DPS - We have to get out of the mentality that one thing can only do one thing and give love to the most useful class in the game.

Do you want to raid with a bunch of mediocre aging adult‚Äôs whose only claim to fame is hyping up the accomplishment‚Äôs they share with millions of other mediocre WoW players? Well boy howdy do I have a guild for you! We‚Äôve been P server heroes for the better part of a decade and our accomplishments are long and circle jerky about a bunch of shit a bunch of other people did too. But hey we did it wasted so there‚Äôs that!

---
We do run meme specs and if you would like to apply as one, understand it has high requirements. Searching for our forever shadow priest currently.

Played almost solely hybrids back in vanilla. Shaman, druid. This time around I'm thinking mage. But mages are really, really boring in vanilla raids. Still, mages are exceptional at everything and offer a really cool class fantasy. The only downside, again, is that they are boring in raids. The idea of spending 7 minutes spamming one button sounds... pretty lame. Although, it seems most classes are pretty dull in vanilla PVE. Which is concerning because I have a very short attention span and now have a lifetime of WoW experience under my belt, which is only going to exacerbate my vanilla boredom. 
---
If not mage, maybe priest. Healing in raids is fun and it comes with an option to play shadow in PVP or in limited PVE.
---
Exactly, it oversaturates Horde Priests because now they have to handle all of the dispelling.  Gives Alliance Warlocks more value.
---
Rogue.  
---
You are in control. Pick your target, take your time, choose when to strike.  
---
Control your environment. Sneak through anything you want, you decide what to engage and what to avoid.  
---
Be an assassin, a mercenary, a duelist, or whatever you want.

You decide. Play a rogue.

I'm not hoping for a completely fresh gaming experience. Just hoping that a few things are different in the 1.12 code compared to private servers to spice things up a bit.
---
Splendid
---
There are guilds recruiting on this sub and on every discord chat related to Classic WoW. In my opinion, recruiting without even having a realm list is simply a waste of time, and you're going to wind up in an overpopulated guild and you'll get passed over if you're not one of the first to 60. Might as well just enjoy leveling and join a guild when you get to 60 and not have to worry about it from now until August.
---
It's really nowhere near just aoe farming for the same amount of time, though.
---
Not saying they wont. Never said I cared about top level raiding clear speeds. I'm not a high end raider anyway.
---
The end part is what I wonder about. Realistically, I would love if Blizzard made progression servers of some sort.
---
I would love having the ability to start from scratch, level up, clear all the content, and when I do be given the option to move onto the next.
---
They can preserve their games legacy without infinitely splintering the community with more and more requests for legacy content. If you don't want to progress, you don't have to. They'd have to work out a sharding system to run multiple instances of the game concurrently with sharding (like it'd be really weird to see a Wrath geared character floating around Classic Org), but I think it can be done. It would also give players a path to import previously removed content up to live servers. Like, yeah, you'll see more Corrupted Ashbringers than you do on Live, but I think if you busted your balls off to get one maybe you should be able to show it off in the current version of the game.
---
I treated the sliders as 0 = unwanted 5 = apathetic and 10= really wanted
---
Yea you really will have to wait for TBC to become viable as shadow, and by then EVERY GROUP wants you thanks to Vampiric Touch. You also have more tools at your disposal including Shadow Word: Death which boost your dps, improved talents later in the tree which also beef up your DPS and Misery which is a +5% damage boost to your raid. 
---
\^ Sorry that has nothing much to do with your post but as someone who adores Priest and has mained one as a hardcore raider in original Vanilla as a healer and then in TBC, the difference is light and day (No pun intended). Shadow really got fleshed out in TBC and it was essential to have 2-3 in any given raid, but Vanilla it's just not enough for min max guilds. I'm sure there will be plenty of guilds who place more emphasis on fun though and you can find a spot with them! GL :)

---
‚Ä¢ Revival is a newly founded guild that is recruiting members for the official classic launch. Our goal as a guild is to take a semi-hardcore approach to the game and get as far through the content as possible with the time we are given with as little toxicity as possible.
---
***\*\*- Who are we looking to recruit? -\*\****
---
‚Ä¢ Currently we are looking for a group of mature adults with life commitments that understand the game doesn‚Äôt always come first and that will contribute to making our guild feel like home for everyone. We are also looking to find passionate raiders who can make a few hours a night to down bosses with the guild and gear up together as a guild at our own pace.
---
***- What we offer in return -***
---
‚Ä¢ We offer the community experience that is sought after, every member will be treated like family and like they are part of the guild and not just a number.
---
‚Ä¢ A relaxed raiding environment where mistakes can be made without being yelled at or ridiculed by the raid leader / raid members. 
---
‚Ä¢ A relaxing leveling experience with plenty of dungeon groups available and ready to go on launch day.
---

It's generally not that great while levelling or in BGs so yeah, unless your plan is just to duel 24/7... I mean it's not terrible in BGs but it's not like some super OP spec, deep afflic or detro are both more meta for good reason.
---
If you want to tank feral isn't the best raid spec MotW and the rest into resto so you can heal? You can be primary OT and on fights you're not needed you can heal.
---
Yep been rocking my action bars that away since I can back after classic announcement and it‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôll do on classic while trying to tag boars.
---
The resets are the problem. I call it hyper achievement inflation. You work your ass off to get something now that will be obsolete in a few weeks because some catch up mechanism is introduced. So all you worked for is meaningless. That's why I quit after wotlk came out. I knew what was in store for me, all my work in TBC was meaningless and everything resets within the first few quests in wotlk.
---
I just want to point out that i have no desire to be competitive in classic and never stated so. I am as casual as it gets. I have a 40 hr a week job and have a 4 year old daughter. I'll be lucky if I even get to raid. I have absolutely no desire to compete against anyone.
---
Think of how much money you'll save by doing nothing but playing Classic.
---
Technically playing Classic is being a responsible adult.
---
Haha fuck yeah shamans!

**&lt;Remastered&gt; - Oceanic - Alliance - PVP**
---
You aren't here to read a novel, you're here to look for a guild.
---
On that note:
---
 **Raid Times:** Mon/Wed/Sun 7:30-11pm AEST
---
**Who we are:** A handful of friends with 14+ years of WoW experience, including hardcore progression and region-first kills.
---
**What we want:** Commitment. You don't have to be the creme de la creme, but as long as you are active, committed and receptive to constructive criticism, that's all we ask.
---
**Goals:** Clear and farm all content whilst it is relevant.
---
**Intended Raid Environment:** Banter.
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council.
---
The hybrid classes are meant to be played as supports not standalone classes like the core four. Rogues, warriors, mages, and priests can do what their classes were intended to do better than anyone else, no one is denying that. A hybrid class will never beat them at specific things like dps, healing, or tanking. 
---
But in pvp situations where we cant hyper focus on healing or dps, and have to skirmish with other players, the hybrids bring more to the table than the core four. Like I said before mixing a support into a group instead of just adding another warrior will be more beneficial to everyone in a group. Luckily the game isnt just random wpvp 1v1s where someone could run away. When fighting over lumber mill I would much rather have paladin by my side to buff and support me with heals or dps. 
---
In pve when variables are controlled and you know exactly how much dps and healing you need I totally agree that the hybrids are mostly useless. But pvp had too many variables and they become much more useful and effective
---
What's the backbone of Paladin that hasn't changed? Genuinely interested. Seals and Auras have both been completely overhauled and removed in various iterations, and then there's Holy Power...
---
Ha, I think my retail mage still has its old /dnd macro with water &amp; portal prices.
---
That's just one little thing among a sea of things you can do to min/max though. Yeah, it might lower your fight by a few seconds, but if you combine it with every other min/max, it adds up. The type of guild that would want to bring human rogues are also the ones that would want to bring human dps warriors, human tank warrior, dwarf priests, use optimal specs, have world buffs, etc.
---
I did that on a normal server in vanilla and and it was amazing because wow was amazing and locks were amazing.
---
I‚Äôve only played on PvP servers since TBC and I‚Äôm gonna roll PvP in classic. The WotF thing is making me think twice about alliance though but it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs as big a deal was people make out.
---
Good luck, brave adventurer!
---
Yes I am definitely looking forward to playing casually. Since now I‚Äôm in my 30s, have a job, a family, responsibilities, etc. But I tried playing when the demonhunter came out and it was just, lame, for lack of a better word. Vanilla had the sense of achievement when you did something exciting, or finally got a new piece of gear, or when you kicked that asshole rogues ass who likes to try and stun or blind lock you from getting a node/mob. Not to mention, the game was just plain fun.
---
Can confirm I was said hunter, I had that along with the entirety of the Scarlet set.
---
Wrong, DM is Dun Morogh.
---
Just avoid STV and you‚Äôre fine.
---
All the people who joined from TBC onwards will find it fresh.
---
I don't understand the negative reactions to the video. Emergent gameplay such as this actually breathes life into the game and allows for different ways to enjoy the content. No one is forcing you to speedrun if you don't want to, it's just nice that there is a community that wants to do it. This creates new metas where you bring certain specs/combinations to push the absolute limit in terms of clear times.
---
You can still enjoy the game casually and raid with your friends once or twice a week. You can still explore and enjoy the world for what it is, a vast realm filled with things to do. None of that is mutually exclusive with the existence of hardcore content.
---
Yeah.  
---
A lot of [raid items in particular](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4mmhjb/this_is_what_tier_2_looked_like_before_aq_was/) had placeholder stats &amp; skins, or were incorrectly designed during Blizzard's 2-year crunch time leading up to release.  
---
Instead of releasing the stupid versions, they're releasing all items in their final form, even if that's not what the items looked like in early 2005.
---
Guy makes a really interesting video about a unique classic WoW topic that isn't "What Class Should You Play?" #5000 with great production and visuals and you all shit on him.
---
I'm not interested in speedrunning myself either, but I can still appreciate the efforts of these guys pushing the limits and mastery of a great game.
---
Twitch is cancer for gaming. There, I said it.
---
i accept that they don't scale as well but nobody is saying *why*!
---
obviously casters scale really well because of +dmg and lots of multipliers, but hunters to me seem to have just as much going for them as rogues
---
That looks crazy in context: example Druid .09 + 6.5 or Warlock .07 + 6. Spirit is 10x as good for warriors.
---
Thats why you play female. Welcome to WoW üòù
---
1g major city to major city.  3g for kargath org port.  Set HS to kargath,  ghetto hearth from RFC if HS on CD, and profit.
---
No blizzard retired that back in 2013/2014 IIRC.
---
They do in 1.12 my bro
---
I would roll priest but I don't want to play a dwarf. Sad for me.
---
This. Every Blizzard content release is structured to compete against another companies release.
---
Look at what‚Äôs going on around the screen, instead of staring at your hot keys or the monsters health, and turn your camera distance as far out as you‚Äôre comfortable with. I often used an add on for max camera distance, before they put it into the regular UI, to emphasize the first sentence.
---
Yeah, essentially you're trying to squeeze as much value out of spriest mana because its so low impact to begin with. So you're trying to turn your mana into more warlock shadow bolts, which are much higher impact. 
---
I figured pots + healthstones would not help the build lol.
---
I generally don‚Äôt invest time in people acting aggressively. I know my stats. I‚Äôve shared them to help others who may be interested in the outcomes. If you don‚Äôt agree that‚Äôs your call.
---
They do in 1.12, my bro
---
Isn't it far more complex than that? They aren't literally just pulling up files from 13 years ago and hosting it, they're building the old game on top of the new one. So a lot of things will be different. I can see this being similar to releasing a new expansion pack in terms of testing needed.
---
I can‚Äôt wait till late September ...... :/

\*Opens trade window without saying anything\*

Mage: ???
---
Noob: Water plz!
---
Correct
---
Time to rethink your whole relationship haha
---
Reduce the cool down of presence of mind and arcane power to 30 seconds.
---
You should play a Warlock. Not because you'll get groups for every dungeon for your ability to summon and skipping keys with Hellfire. Not because you have a massive arsenal of cool abilities. Not because your raid damage is excellent. Not because you have the coolest tier sets in the game. Not because you can be great in PvP.
---
No you should play a Warlock because about once a month you will seduce a low geared 60, throw Curse of Elements on him. Charge up a Soul Fire that you have macroed with [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2s8LwHPikU) voice line and one-shot that poor bastard. That is a very special feeling.
---
"can i portal?" bis
---
It‚Äôs not all about you
---
Same.
---
Asking you to show your work is aggressive? I think only someone who knows they are wrong would claim such a thing.
---
Show us your work.
---
One of you need to pick up herbalism then, you will still compete for gear, stat is way more important then if it is leather/mail/plate.
---
good post i enjoyed reading it
---
Their early 00's albums too, pvp videos were full of that stuff
---
Yes, great :)
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing it‚Äôs min/max, I disagreed with our resident expert on the fact that it‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolutely bonkers‚Äù when in reality it‚Äôs a marginal increase. 
---
And yes many marginal increases do add up but I‚Äôm not going to throw out the passenger seat of my car to increase my gas mileage by 3%.
---
Hunter
---
Best leveling, your pet is a mini tank, you need to keep your pet fed and happy or he abandons you, you can tame unique pets for their special abilities
---
You gey an EPIC solo questline for Rhok delar which is challenging and rewarding
---
I started to main a priest when I came back to retail in Legion. I like priest in general, so I'm not too bummed if I need to play holy/disc :)
---
In my experience people only do it if they aren't higher than lvl 18. VanCleef is hard (he hits ridiculously hard and the 4 extra mobs dont help) and people would rather kill him than give up.
---
I think this time it‚Äôll take me half a year to reach 60.
---
The biggest thing this glosses over is how many debuff slots you are taking up, which is a big deal when it comes to raidwide DPS.
---
This also ignores the obvious mana issues SPreists have, and how irrelevant of a problem healing warlocks is.
---
Same
---
lol I thought you meant politics at first.
---
\*Laughs in Undead\*
---
&gt; Well, i think its pretty safe to assume Classic isnt just typical cash grab
---
I had my hopes up about this "Classic dev team" as well, but then the most recent blue posts happened. It's become pretty apparent they're trying to invest as little time, effort and money into this release to show a higher profit to shareholders in their Q3 report. :-/
---
I dont know about back end coding or coding in the blizzard system. But it seems like once it was proved possible they put effort in it. With the demo as a base it kind of proves he didnt get an adequate version going before they went all in.
---
Wouldn't be dumb at all but they promised people will always be able to play classic so it's not like they would go away.
---
Y u do dis
---
Holy light / flash of light and Crit stacking. 
---
Ret and Prot seem to go up and down depending on the expansion but holy remains dominant.
---
Even though you have to work your tail off for the most of the leveling period, you're able to do dungeons when you want to, you'll be a monster at 60, and when you're at 60, you can play pretty much any way you want to and you'll still be "viable" for raids.
---
Welcome to Warrior, the class that is unstoppable as long as you don't fight a Frost Mage or Warlock or Hunter fortheloveofgodineedadispelpleasehelpmehealffs.
---
It was a made up date based purely on speculation
---
The only one I didn‚Äôt mark 0 was sharing at launch. I put 2 for that for the starter zones.
---
Yeah! It‚Äôs obviously goblins...right?
---
This survey blows. Who the fuck thinks sliders are good for a survey? The way shits worded I have no idea which side of the scale represents which point of view.
---
I‚Äôd sacrifice classic wow entirely if it meant survey planet was banned from existence.
---
&gt;theres no challenge outside hc/mythic raids
---
And Vanilla has challenges? I was in Resu on L!ghtbringer, I cleared all raids up to AQ. Nothing apart from Rhok'delar was challenging and even that took me 1-2 tries per boss.
---
People severely overestimate old wow's difficulty. It was easy. People were just bad.
---
I remember needing a spell crit% ring in as my hunter main inUBRS and had no idea why everyone was upset because in my mind everything I cast was a "spell."  I was promptly kicked from the group :/
---
Just a note - Nano's first interview on the meeting with Blizzard was on Countdown To Classic ;)
---
Shhhhh, this man gets it
---
That‚Äôs true.....but I‚Äôm quitting my job.....so no lol
---
I logged on and saw it, and as soon as I saw that title, before I even dared to consider whether or not it was fake, I got an instant nostalgia boner. Never been so excited for something seemingly so petty in years.
---
I'm kinda hoping for a later release, would love to be able to enjoy the summer and THEN play wow.
---
Mechanically current mythic raiding is way way way harder than anything in vanilla
---
Looking forward to get back to WoW so badly.
---
I just spent about 300 euro on metal music, t-shirts etc.
---
My nephew's confirmation is this Saturday and I havent even checked if I need a new suit for it yet.

---
My favorite is the one talking about your main tank who is wearing lightforge gear and will eventually wear thunderfury, way cool.
---
Dude I only have stuff to do on my holy priest  in retail 2 nights a week for raid. I have 4 other 120's I barely play anymore. It's going to be so chill to just log off hop, on vanilla and continue on the *long journey* of my warlock
---
Dire Maul is not DM if only because it has 3 wings so if you write " LFM DM " I have no idea what wing you want.
---
That being said if Dire Maul only had 1 wing it would be DM since there are far fewer people doing Deadmines. Dire Maul is endgame.
---
I‚Äôm going to interject here, everything that guy was doing was very skillful, especially when compared to retail.
---
Go back and look at your posts. Asking for evidence is fine, I do it all the time. But your belligerent tone comes on through. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel at all like you are genuinely interested, just looking for a right/wrong argument. No thanks
---
There will probably be quite a few people who will play Classic over BFA so they fear splitting up an already really fragmented community. Also, whenever they see Blizzard working on something they don't want, they scream. 
---
During patch 1.4 or thereabout they introduced the dressing room. So you could shift click an item to see how it would look on your character. People were in uproar that Blizzard wasted time on that instead of fixing bugs or releasing new raids/dungeons. 
---
So it's always been like that.
---
if you were min maxing your gas milage you absolutely would. Just look at nascar.
---
Warrior, Warrior, Shaman
---
2 warrs cleaving with windfury. Sham keeps them alive.
---
Based and human-pilled
---
But patches are tested by the public on the PTRs, aren't they? I think that there'll be some kind of beta, even if I don't think it'll be a 100+ days like for expansions. If it was as simple as just re-releasing old game files, they'd done it long ago. I mean their Classic dev-team must have been working on something these past couple of years or however long it's been in the making, right? And what they've worked on will have to be tested.
---
Wether it's their work on technical stuff or the game itself, it makes sense to me that they'll have some kind of mass-test for feedback. It might be just a few weekend-betas, or a regular closed beta, but it doesn't make sense to not have a big test. What if there are issues with the technical upgrades, and the amount of players, or other such issues?
---
I might be wrong as I don't really know game development or what I'm speaking about, it just makes logical sense to me to make sure that the game won't break on release.
---
Read  the intro. It explains on the meaning of the values. I agree with your point on sliders though. Also OP, please share results!
---
You're just illustrating part 1 of what everyone is saying. Hunters have amazing dps, but they don't scale as well.
---
I don't care, because I won't be in Naxx, anyway, but it is definitely something to consider for people who will be
---
I have a bunch of people coming back, and I have friends who never tried WoW that wants to start with me. Amazing stuff, and I'm anxiously waiting for it.
---
You re not making 1000g by 60 anyway

# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours. Started by a small grp of irl friends to see if there is interest for late night raiding. After some posts here and there seems people are interested to play at these hours so here we are starting the project.
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We will have role officers/Raid leader and at the moment all positions are free for anyone up to the challenge.
---
* We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Sun(Thursday or Monday on progression). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will either use DKP or loot council.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord **KingMavros#2601**
---
or join [**https://discord.gg/3wj8duk**](https://discord.gg/3wj8duk)
---
There is no world chat
---
I did read the intro and I still had no clue what side was which.
---
The dead space that is WoD speaks volumes
---
Do you like shoes?  That's how you decide.
---
I guess I‚Äôm naive, but what is a ‚Äú3 minute mage‚Äù?
---
Region? Faction? :)
---
you two should play to experience the game not minmax
---
Early its mostly about stacking the + healing and getting a shield of some kind for 5mans. I'm not sure if the green + healing items will be available out the door, but if so those will be prebis in essentially every slot. I'd also target the tirion fordring questline for the ring which is very powerful. 
---
Early raiding is mostly about consumes in the form of mana pots. The consumes will cover for your early lack of crit and int, while your +healing on gear will cover your healing output.
---
Show up early and be there dependably. No one will care. Attendance more better
---
Hi, /u/Clouded_leopard
---
One of us is. But I am not sure how we would be competing even stat wise. He will be going Ele/Restoi. So should not be grabbing any str/agi/stam gear I need. Also, he is welcome to all the spirit gear. I would normally be going for it solo, but with him there to heal he will need it more than I will.
---
There was a time where mages could stack two spell enhancing trinkets with Arcane Power, Presence of Mind and Pyroblast and basically 1 shot anyone.  The cooldowns were 3 minutes.  There would be times I would kill 3 people with 5 spells.
---
most of the kills in world of roguecraft are against not very skilled players

Troll women are always barefoot? That kinda sounds fun. A very relaxed vibe
---
Have you tried using [Common Sense]? 0 is bad, 10 is good, y'know?
---
I believe most raid teams will be glad to take 2-4 druids for innervate alone. You dont innervate yourself mind you, but the priests appreciate it.
---
I could have also asked if you liked to blink or not.
---
I'm on one right now which has them (literally mobs partial resisting my Mind Blasts right now).
---
Wc3 reforged is allrdy on the launcher with no date of release yet?!
---
Troll women never blink? Very threatening gaze, that must be a hidden racial
---
Will definitely share the results and look for another survey site :)
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much to ask for a survey to not be garbage. This one doesn‚Äôt deserve my time.
---
Have fun doing MC without decursive. Sure it‚Äôs doable, but it‚Äôs a pain in the bootay
---
blizzard's classic will have no progressive itemization (so ton of items will have buffed stats (from naxx patch) for all classes, which inderectly nerfs all raids) and will have 16 debuff slots on top of that instead of 8 and how it was, which is another nerf for already not hard raid to begin with. 
---
so raids will be a total joke, at least first tier for sure. so you don't need to stress about consumables, resist gear or any of these things. neither you will need to have full prebis espeacially as a hpal. 
---
there is no exact prebis list from private servers, that would be exactly as it will be on official vanilla. 
---
cos no other server ran such a fucked up itemization system on top of staggering Dire Maul.
---
we had servers that had progressive itemizaion, or servers that went 1.12 from the get go, but already with diremaul.
---
blizzard's vanilla is a mixed variant of these two.
---
You think you do, but you do.Ôªø
---
I'm sorry, I meant in Vanilla, yes, totems DO aggro mobs if left out and in their aggro range.
---
Incorrect. Replay Borderlands, Diablo, FF7, and FF9 fairly often
---
I would like to believe that you are not being false, but you do not make it easy. Every time I have asked for you to show your data you give vague responses without providing any data.
---
I even went so far as to seek out the Mangos database, import it into MySQL and search through it in order to learn the table relations, find the drop rate data for the item you chose, and then provided step by step instructions on how I came to my result so that it can be peer reviewed. 
---
Yet you still have the audacity to tell me that I am not interested?
---
You could put this entire discussion on its back by simply providing the exact data and process by which you came to your conclusion.
---
But you won't, because you can't, because your conclusion is false.
---
I have the same cold dead racial when making love.
---
Thanks for the clarification :) 
---
I get confused with all the content that has been produced :) 
---
But from memory does my previous statement align with what he suggested.
---

---
This is pretty much your straight down the line standard Feral tank spec.
---
Regarding your question, I personally wouldn't ask someone to fill two completely different roles in a raid because it means that they have to put in a lot of extra work in the form of farming consumables, having to maintain and bring separate gear sets as well as keep those two gear sets updated and enchanted.
---
There's a couple of reasons why I think that's asking a bit too much. Firstly, farming consumables on a weekly basis takes up a lot of your time. Doing it for two specs is possible, but it's asking a lot. Secondly, anybody who's expected to tank during a raid normally brings along multiple gear sets to raid just for that purpose. On some fights you need more mitigation, sometimes you need more hit, sometimes you need to maximize threat output. So there's about 10 to 13 gear slots where you might have multiple pieces, all of which need to be enchanted too of course which is costly. You start to see how a tank runs out of bag slots fairly quickly.  
---
And then they not only have to bring consumables to raid for two specs, they might have to bring gear sets for multiple specs. It's just not practical to fill multiple roles in a time when many players will do all of the things I mentioned in order to stay competitive.
---
And another thing is that if you ask someone to fill multiple roles, now you have them working double time to stay on par you also have to let them in on loot for both specs. You're asking for trouble when the guy who spends probably 80% of his time tanking also wants his shot at rare and difficult to obtain healing equipment.
---
fucking hayole
---
It must be like making love to a basilisk
---
So an undead thing?
---
If you‚Äôre willing to give up Classic just because a survey website, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre very committed. You may as well unsubscribe.
---
I mean if you wait until someone is at 30% it doesn't matter what class they are
---
Most retail tourists will quit when they see how much effort is required for a shitty green.
---
On the other hand, true classic enthusiasts play for more than just the colored pixels. It's about the community &amp; the fun of those close encounters with lower-level mobs &amp; other content.
---
I was just parroting something I believe Skarm said in one of his feral tank videos. I'll take a look and see if I can confirm his HotW+feral tank build.
---
Sign me up.  Who needs a wife and kids when you get your first epic.

---
If you have watched alot of drakedog or vurtne u have definetly heard it before. It always reminds me of vanilla wow pvp.
---
Retail wow devs could make a better survey than this.
---
Well, $15 a month for entertainment, there's no way for a wife to say no to that.
---
Thought we we didn‚Äôt but they.
---
Thank you, that's the nicest thing anyone has ever told me on this sub.
---
[Found it] (https://youtu.be/BirMIEA1oVI). Keep in mind though, that Skarm isn't your average player and his guild isn't your average guild. Also, I believe his feral druid is his alt, and Warrior his main.
---
Do we have a release date yet?
---
Wow the feels. This brings back so many wonderful memories; it seems like childhood was indeed a simpler time.
---
Obviously there are exceptions. Hell, that's why we're here. We believe Classic is an exception.
---
But its silly to think all old games live up to how we remember.
---
Dwarf female
---
If you play the DoT-less build and burst heal, your Vampiric Embrace uptime could be minimized allowing for other debuffs to be up in its place (debuff swapping is most likely its own nightmare lol). But there would have to be a need to heal life tapping warlocks which it sounds like there isn't xD
---
Dont know why.. But out of all the memes this one made me chuckle.
---
Namechanging didn't remove you off peoples friends lists or block lists.
---
Deleting your character and asking blizzard to restore it did though.
---
After having amazing shadow priests in my guild I have realized bringing another warlock is better than having the SP.  Only reason we kept them around is due to them having near 100% raid attendance. And like other said your mama will be gone often so unless you are horde and coordinate with shamans to be moved groups for mana tide eat lots of runes and major mana pots
---
From my classic experience the pallies will wait til around 25% or even 20% to bubble and heal to full. Every time I would just wait til 30,stun, and burst. Like clockwork. After about 15 minutes ganking the same people and hunting them they tend to stay away from you.
---
I knew what was coming literally the second he said the words "ice cream."
---
Do it. Warlock is gonna be one if the 4 classes I'll actually have a character of. It's a good one
---
Imagine accepting that group invite then getting sharded.
---
Someday you will.

It did in the beginning of BfA

It's more like "we have a date planned but if we have to push it we can since we didn't actually set a solid date"
---

---
guild bank 10
---
transmog 0 (8 if client side only)
---
loot tradeing 5
---
everything else just a 0
---
Maybe he wants to do some wpvp.
---
Just be sure to temper your expectations. Blizzard doesn't really give detailed data break downs, but private servers do. The data tends to show a majority of the population tends to hover between the level 2-10 range. When we compare that against registered users and concurrent players, the data seems to indicate that a large chunk of the player base just quits around those levels. How that compares to other games is uncertain (achievement tracking on Steam for example indicates only a small fraction of any given community tends to finish most games), but I know a lot of people will dip their toes into classic, and realize that the slower, less convenient gameplay maybe isn't for them.
---
It isn't helped by the fact that a lot of Vanilla dungeons aren't that great until around the Scarlet Monetary tier. And even then, mechanics aren't the greatest or flashiest.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love Vanilla. But I also expect that most of my friends who are excited to return will probably be out the door before we can start running Wailing Caverns. For all it's faults it's hard to step back from how Retail makes you feel like a badass with a thundering 14 inch cock right out the gate and Vanilla doesn't.
---
Same, this was almost a crisis. I don't know if this sub can handle admitting that the 2nd amendment guarantees ownership of even fully automatics and other small arms or weapons like grenades.
---
Oh, is that possible??
---
Nice elf mohawk
---
Nice
---
Lol someone says ‚Äúlink the loot‚Äù during the level 10 mob raid.
---
For the first roguecraft video, rogues were unbalanced enough that unless you had consumables and trinkets ready, you were pretty helpless against even a naked rogue. Remember, he was naked going vs fully geared high ranking opponents.
---
Once the rogue's skills started getting diminishing effects, the class became more balanced. You couldn't just perpetually stun lock and cc a guy anymore.
---
I can‚Äôt remember how vanilla hunters used to work.
---
&gt; Because it's not a new ip.
---
WoW expansions are "not a new IP" but they still get alpha/beta.
---
I can‚Äôt help with most of your questions but i‚Äôll share some knowledge anyways. I played a paladin in vanilla and also leveled one more recently. 
---
The leveling process in classic is going to take you a long time regardless of your class but paladins are know to be a bit slower. Trying to power level to max on your first play through isn‚Äôt what i would recommend  but if that‚Äôs your plan here‚Äôs some tips to get to max quickly while still getting to experience a variety of content. 
---
You can easily heal dungeons while leveling as retribution spec up until around level 45-50. This will allow you to solo level much faster while still being able to run dungeons. Start collecting intellect and +healing gear for healing, including items that aren‚Äôt plate, so that you can throw them on while healing as ret or have items ready for if you switch to holy at a higher level. 
---
Another tip is make sure you fully understand all of the paladin blessings in classic. For example blessing of salvation can be very useful to allow a dps in your party to output more without pulling aggro. Another good one is letting a mage use blizzard aoe and as soon as they steal aggro use blessing of protection on them. 
---
You get a free mount at level 40 so gold isnt as much of an issue for you but is still recommend making friends with a mage for free water.

---
We will have plenty o time to enjoy the game on alts we level alone. We also played classic back in the day and have jumped around from private server to private server.   
---
We are simply more interested in playing this way. So I am doing as much research as I can about it ahead of time.
---
&gt; And Vanilla has challenges?
---
Compared to retail, yes.
---
alrighty, I just say so because if you guys aren't always playing together (saw your post saying you work together) one of you might resent the other for not being available and holding the other back
---
Yeah! I wasn't recording the whole time because fraps recorded large file size and my hard drive wasn't very big!  Once I started recording the wolf was mostly dead but it was a long (30 seconds) fight.
---
C‚Äômon, I have some standards y‚Äôknow
---
Not a Mage, can't do those. Plus that's even more time outside the instances where there are 100 undead rogues waiting to gank me.
---
Are they even worth it? Their loot table looks kinda garbo.
---
I was in the Overwatch arena when he came on and wasn't thinking about classic at all. He started talking about ice cream and I thought it was ad libbed filler to maybe get a few seconds on a technical problem. So sorta zoned out, then I head "your favorite flavor, is VANILLA" and I don't think my head has ever snapped forward so hard before.
---
What s so difficult exactly? Raid bosses in vanilla had fewer mechanics than dungeon ones in BFA.
---
And no, I did C'thun in lots of pulls but not nearly as many as Mythic Ghuun.
---
Everything on 0 for me, except for Guild Banks. 
---
Guild Banks would be a nice and harmless addition and fits the Vanilla Community Gameplay very well. I was actually surprised that there weren't any.
---
Which really sucks for the millions of casuals that used to enjoy playing the whole game, not the end game.
---
Maybe you should read my comment again :)
---
Or you can make fake screenshots by leveling on a pserver and say it's from vanilla like most of these people.
---
Even if they try to fix it so the timers dont show and all that you can instantly tell at a glance if it's really vanilla or not.
---
1- green latency in 2004 lulz.
---
2- view distance being that far when most people ran with shitty pcs fairly unlikely.
---
3- level 30-40 with at least 7 addons ( you can view near the minimap ), like who the heck even heard of addons while leveling in 2005? especially not damage meter while leveling ,  I was mostly thinking how I'm going to repair my gear cause I spent all my gold buying all of my useless abilities, not how much dps /damage im doing.
---
You'd at least need to get to 60 then get yelled at for being shit dps to know you need to get damage meters because until you hit 60 for the first time the concept of measuring your output via a metric was redundant and did not even come close to crossing your mind.
---
I enjoyed the video as well.
---
I am interested in speed run times. It is neat to see how creative people can get in something that is one of my favorite hobbies
---
I'd raid that...
---
There's more difficulty to vanilla raids than just boss mechanics, if you actually played vanilla you'd know that. Stay mad, retail baby :)
---
A starts from a 53.846...% larger principle figure (100 vs 65)...so itd stand to reason the absolute gain of A would be larger...roughly 50% larger...
---
To do it accurately look at the following 2 weapons
---
A 10-20 @ 3.000 5 dps
---
B 5-10 @ 1.500 5 dps
---
at 30% haste
---
A 10-20 @ 2.100 7.14285dps
---
B 5-10 @ 1.050  7.14285dps
---
Or something
---
Maybe hold the horses a little. We all hope for its success, but let's not celebrate pre-emptively

---
As far as ranks go, it depends.
---
High Healing, Low Crit. Go Lower.
---
Low Healing, high crit. Go Higher.
---
Lower rank just is cutting it, go higher.
---
Ooming before the end of the fight and lower ranks are good enough healing, go lower.
---
You basically just have to get a feel for what your current gear and the healing needs of the fight require.
---
You can generally avoid MP/5, BoW/Imp BoW gives you plenty if your gear decent. I mean if you can't get literally anything else for the slot. Go for it.
---
But generally you want +healing, +spell crit, +int.
---
And once you git the point where you're ending every fight with plenty of mana left, start moving on ranks. If you're maxed out...then start dropping a little bit of spell crit in favor of more +healing until your mana gets close to empty by the end of the fight.
---
(but don't get rid of the gear. Some fights you want longevity. Otherwise fights you need extra healing and longevity isn't as much of an issue. just swap pieces around depending on which is most needed for a fight by fight basis).
---
And obviously you want to minimize over-healing so get a feel for how much damage your FoL heal and then stagger ranks according to the pace of healing you need.
---
Das good shit
---
God that's sad.
---
I know 1-25 doesn‚Äôt take long, but 1-25 feels like it takes a long time on a mage.
---
i have an undying faith that Classic will be a hit. Not just because of the gameplay but the community will keep it alive. And if/or when Classic fails to entertain Blizz will be smart enough to add new content or release TBC!
---
I have so much faith for the community, something which retail hasn't got.
---
Shamans in melee for windfury!
---
I'm thorn between mage and shaman at the moment, I'm leaning mage because I don't know how I'll make gold as a shaman and mage just craps gold if well played
---
Shaman has less expenses generally but still :s
---
Sure. I know there is a large group of players who use mods and different skins for their armor and character models. During WoD and Legion, I used a mod to change my Forsaken unto the Chinese client Forsaken models where they don't have bones protruding everywhere. I've seen texture mods before the model updates that made the models a bit better to look at and recently I've seen a few people modding textures of armor to look better than a t shirt. The website where I first got into how to mod is mostly a lewd/porn website tbh, but their tools and tutorials really worked! The only people who seem to get banned are ones who talk about it in game and end up getting reported. 
---
It is against the ToS and "if caught you will be banned" but the only people I've ever heard of being banned is the ones who talk about it or share links in game.
---
The item level gap between content drops is way too high because they have too many tiers of the same content.  In classic you could still comfortably raid everything up to (but not including) Naxx with 60 blues/Tier 1 gear.  I remember specifically farming Mauradon for nature resist gear for AQ40.  Hell, a full set of Dungeon blues (shadowcraft/valor etc) was harder to acquire than Tier 1 because of the drop rates and challenge getting a group together for so many various dungeons.
---
I'll admit there a few things in retail that I wished were in classic to make it more functional, but I understand why people want to keep it Vanilla. I will miss transmog, barber shop, soul shards stacking, the soul shatter threat mitigation ability, and a more generous debuff limit. I guess my favorite warlock and version of wow just doesn't exist. A MOP Lock in Vanilla would have been glorious.
---
If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword.

---
is it just that later-game hunter gear has weaker stats or what?  nobody is actually explaining the mechanics that make the hunter scale more poorly
---
Post Nax should just be new content. A different path. Won‚Äôt happen, won‚Äôt be liked, but just my thoughts. Would make it interesting.
---
None of my friends seem to be interested :( all I wanted was a duo partner damn
---
I don't know the math behind it, I'm sure someone can actually explain it well, but I can't. But even if I can't explain the math behind it, it is a fact that hunters scale worse than other dps classes. Part of it is because their pets don't scale with gear, and part of it is because their abilities have higher base damage but gain less damage from gear than other classes.
---
I‚Äôm trying to remember how long it took me to reach 60, feels like it took about a year...
