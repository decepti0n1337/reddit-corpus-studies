Druids don't *shine* at 60. You need at least one per raid for Marks and are subpar in healing and dps. They're totally viable tanks on most fights thought, as threat is usually more important than raw avoidance.
---

---
Having a few Balance / Ferals won't make or break a raid group, but that doesn't mean they *shine*.
---
---
---
Hot out here for a pimp.
---
I agree. Best part of classic fashion is there is none.
---
I'm here [eating a block of cheese like George Costanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u2zc9JE8Kk)
---
Well u/jimmy_eat_womb, you’re an odd fellow, but you steam a mean sham.
---
Imagine being the guy that instantly rolls greed when an epic BoE drops. What a world view to have.
---
Looks like you just raided grandmas tickle trunk
---
I asked once how it worked and you responded with 'holy cow, go read the code for the addon'
---
I think you were being a bit aggressive for a simple question about the how the addon works. You really need to chill out when people ask questions, if you don't want to answer, then just don't reply. 
---
Honestly don't see why you're so worked up, you didn't have to answer my question if you didn't want to.
---
Nm, the rogue pulled aggro and got one shot.
---
I did not know that. I thought weapon damage literally meant your damage on your weapon. Makes sense, I'll now try and add more strength.
---
Thank you so much for letting us know
---
~150hps x40 for 10 seconds is quite a bit of healing.
---
Everything is to some degree political because politics are real life.
---
That doesn't change just because you're in a position to be able to ignore it.
---
Thanks and have fun
---
19 twinks always used runecloth bandages actually. You can get to first aid 225 at level 19 so you can use heavy runecloths to get 2k healing.
---
You thought you did but you didnt.
---
I really need an obnoxious innervate macro for proving my public worth. Shit, and for poison/curse removal...
---
Whenever I drop out of form to heal I use tranquility half the time just to make it super obvious that I'm helping.
---
Report it in-game
---
I tried reckoning levelling and full ret with just the 3% hit in prot tree. Reckoning was a lot slower I wouldn’t recommend it
---
Oh yeah, I get that.
---
There have been times I've asked mages for portals. I always offer to come to them and tip them.
---
not sure if true but i heard you can just report the player for using safe spot exploits to pvp.
---
CS fears as top priority, unless you're undead I'd probably save CS just for fear. Use iceblock to clear debuffs, so if you've got a full stack of DoTs you can block it all off before too much damage is taken, or once they land a full fear you can just block right out of it.
---
It's still on retail just no longer obtainable as far as I know. So if someone had it back in the day they can still equip it.
---
Auctionator
---
So i finished my grind to 60 and started doing some strat live. I got extremely lucky and got a 2nd pair of Truefaith Vestments (Priest 300 Tailor Robe). I'm on a smallish server and I am honestly wondering how much I should sell this for. Don't want to get ripped off.
---
Auctioneer.
---
If the entire five man party is hurting and you don't have aggro, it's pretty nice actually. For less than 3-4 targets not at all.
---
Seems like we're on the same page, Although orc warriors that have taken Iron will are a little silly. 5% base stun resist+ 25% racial+ 15% from talent = 45% chance to resist stun, That's where I start agreeing with people that it's OP.
---
What I’m saying is it doesn’t make sense to complain about something that you can easily change, nothing of what I said was stupid. In fact it’s the most logical thing to do rather than bitch and moan that he can’t find a tank.
---
I haven’t harvested a thing and only bought shit items on the ah and have made over 20g at level 30. With minimal sitting in front of the ah. Just gotta know what everyone wants.
---
Ask to speak to a senior GM, someone posted a week or two ago about doing that and it got them out of a ban. Pull a Karen. I know it sounds like a waste of time, but the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
---
Are you jesus?
---
Yes gets a ban definetly
---
If you're already out of combat before the lock taps down he's not tapping down early enough.
---
Its just sad bcus i Wanna play but im
---
 Not enjoying it....
---
For most yeah. The stairs in ZF can be challenging for even proper levelled healers.
---
Rawr.
---
what does wearing both ad trinkets do? you dont get extra rep right?
---
Let the man have some fun, geeze it’s a cry fest every time someone dose something like this. What’s the difference from that and someone corpse camping you for hours on end? Report him if you feel it’s necessary and move on, it seems like a common bug in classic with many locations to do it at.
---
Came here to post this....well played!
---
You would NOT want to buy from them right now Fanatics makes hot garbage apparel. It falls apart easy if it even comes made correctly.
---
Come to the dark side.
---
Replied to the wrong comment homie!
---
Someone above stated you cannot. You learn something new every day
---
30s of fear immunity trinket is all
---
25 man pugs do 8/10 every night on my server , you need to gtfo that guild.
---
Did I said I have any problem with ganking?
---
Took down a 5 man yesterday as they were killing the dark troll that spawns skeletons in stv. Felt good man.
---
Not for rogue, so much damage comes from the White hits.
---
I would love to bully whiners like you, yeah. Otherwise I do it to compete vs other twinks
---
Shouldn’t have rolled mage, seems like a lot of mages are asking how to make money and what not. If you can’t get to 60 or have your epic with a mage then yea, definitely went the wrong class. Try something not OP like a Druid or paladin.
---
I can fight back against someone corpse camping me is the difference
---
I am a horde player on bigglesworth. I’m not saying what he’s doing is right, but the proper response is not reporting or whining. The correct response is to internalize your anger and do the same thing to horde players when you get to a higher level.
---
Kromcrush was about as close to 50/50 as it gets, last I checked.
---
The difference is that it’s been against the rules to terrain evade guards since vanilla.
---
So true! I Had my first fair pvp fight today (on lvl 56), running on the street from the furbolgs to everlook. No mob, nothing. Just me, and the orc that came from the other direction. He dismounted and i knew it was on. Such a good fight. Both fully healed, both buffed, both aware that its about to go down. So fun.
---
I won the duel, and got farmed by the next hordy crossing my way immediately after the first was done. But no hard feelings there, it's how it goes.
---
Yup, they don't exist yet.
---
As a warrior I relate.  43 for me too.

You do realize that you dont *have* get your epic riding the second you ding 60 right?
---
Oops wrong tree compared to what I wanted to post.
---
Greed roller. Totally deserves it. So tired of people not thinking before a roll and making it as though a need roll is the mistake. Greed rolls make this issue.
---
Let’s see your /played on your 60
---
I wish the healers on my server were on the same page. I'm constantly having to whisper my healers telling them not to heal dps if they pull, and they'll stop pulling. It drives me nuts as a warrior because I'm starting the pull disadvantaged, and the dps obviously don't just pull, they pull and INSTANTLY open up with full big dick dps rotations. I can't get aggro back from that.
---
Yes the 30min is still in retail.  You cant obtain the staff anymore.  But its still there for thoose that obtained it.  You get both stave apperence in your transmog book if you have it
---
Nah, should've killed his friend and rezzed the warrior.
---
You on Fairbanks? Cause me and a  buddy had an alli do that to us and we've been laughing our asses off about it ever since. Its become a meme amongst my group.
---
Thank you! I plan on releasing at least 1 episode per weak.

Ah yes, 3% mount speed could surely be the secret to success in UBRS.

It's been reported a million times.  It's well known to be bugged.

According to an article in the Guardian, they already have some people declining job offers because of this incident.
---
Tips for holding AoE threat for 5 mans? I seem to struggle with this. Pulling packs of 5-8 mobs it seems like I can't get them to stick on me even with hots/thorns, I'm opening with demo and swiping, but I'm sure there's a better way.
---
I’m gonna pop some tags, only got 20g in my pocket...
---
Yeah it depends on the situation, and if you're undead etc. A warlock may simply try to outmuscle you and DoT you up and then drain life until you die. But usually yeah at some point there will be a fear you can't CS.
---
I tried after reading this can confirm "has no pockets"
---
I will die before I bind feint. Literally.
---
Despite what the metasexuals say, I notice a significant drop in down time bandaging/eating when using demo shout on mobs vs not using it, unless they are deep deep green.
---
We helped out our priest for 2 hours yesterday.  No Luck.  But Today i helped her out 6 kill in we got it.  Its Nice how people come Together and Help
---
Report. They’ll get banned.

I can respect that, but all is fair in love and war my friend!
---
You can't see all the bodies under the foliage.
---
Use atlasloot, if you're trying to purchase stuff for crafting there is a crafting tab and you click the recipe it will link the mats.
---
No, the proper response is reporting because it’s 100% bannable.
---
Does anyone know what's the hit cap for yellow attacks VS players by any chances?
---
This.
---
I've thought about this as well.
---
It's either that, or hunter alt. Wr alreayd have a hunter in our PvP compo though 😥
---
Haha I was lucky enough to snatch one from AH for less than 10g.
---
ff14 is the only real alternative, structure is close enough to wow but content is designed differently, you can argue both are cool so it's up to taste I guess.
---
When a WoW meme has more upvotes on dankmemes then on Classic WoW subreddit.
---
Might've been the "/e has flagged you as AFK, type /afk to unflag yourself", since that was griefing to get people to afk out of BGs.
---
The pickpocketing emotes are completely harmless in comparison.
---
I'd say that's probably just confirmation bias that gets in the way these dudes legit will sit there and let a mob hit them 1000 times and math everything out nothing gets like a I notice this or I feel this way. It's here's the math and I totally get that's not how everyone wants to play and that's totally fine, but just saying I notice or I feel isn't a way to prove that one thing is better than another.
---
Skilled retail leveler here. Classic can be a challenge even when you're not trying to take your time, due to too many players in your zone or too many people ganking .
---
A guy standing in one spot that has access to the highest traffic area in booty bay.
---
Don't pretend to be stupid.
---
I just afk farmed something, and the price went 100% higher than where it normally is. Needless to say I made out like a bandit selling at the exact perfect time. So it didn't even hurt too much to buy it!
---
100% bannable to do this. It’s bug abuse and Blizz has been very clear on it.
---
Yea I would duel my prot warriors all the time (even fury) as a holy/disc priest while waiting for groups.
---
It always ended with me dancing in my bubble w/ full health as I laughed at the warrior as he try’s helplessly to get through my bubble and dies to my DOT. 
---
This isn’t even close to a PvP spec that I was doing this on, so it definitely taught me a lot about priest/warriors. 
---
I’ve heard that warriors scale the best with gear. So maybe in later phases a Total BIS geared warrior is probably top tier but idk for sure just from my own exp.
---
"You...will...die."
---

Hey, I resent this fact! I can PvP effectively every 30 minutes!
---
Professionis, AH, farming
---
These runs will break your spirit.  50+ runs not seen hoj yet
---
Yep.
---
I'm sure it is still fun, just playing it makes me sick to my stomach.
---
yeah the pattern
---
That was my thoughts exactly! Well done you
---
LOL, thats actually me who sells the Maraudon Runs. Op is the guy who sells Rexxar prob.
---
Ye. You are right

I had 400g when I hit 60 just from questing

Lose to barron cape 5 times to warriors then tell me you dont reserve items.

&gt; Boycotting WoW and other Blizzard game might be micro but it is something that they will nltice.
---
I am very sure their 0.4% share drop that was immediately nulified and their 1% profit drop from some people returning their Warcraft 3 preorders is going to make Brack come begging for forgiveness any moment now. /s
---
but that’s to ambiguous!!! They have to write out every reason explicitly or it’s illegal!! /s
---
When your western subscriber tripled, but it has been so long you ducked yourself over so you bend down to the eastern audience angering all those subscribers that you just regained. 
---
Also Diablo Immortals is coming out, what a surprise we haven’t heard a word from them since last blizzcon.
---
So I have decided to level (with a friendly paladin) a balance druid.  I’ve heard mostly negative things about it, damage is low and the mana is bad, but that it’s decent in pvp!  So far I have found all these things to be true, but I really want to make it work for leveling.  Any and all tips would be appreciated!  Currently im level 21, trying to stack as much Int as possible to correct the mana.  I’ve gone only into the restro tree for the mana regen in combat, as I thought it more vital then trying to squeeze out more damage, since spell damage doesn’t increase with any stat.
---
Who needs to be good when you can be painfully average?
---
I think they're  just going for different goals. They tend to focus on the most damage/rage spent and fastest time to kill. Whirlwinding in berserker stance will dish out more damage for sure, but staying in battle stance and reducing their attack power means that my fight takes longer but I have less downtime and less chance of a few misses meaning a death. To me, just keeping up the steady routine of grinding out kills is more important than blasting through an individual fight, especially when you consider running back from doing high risk stuff and how much time that adds to the equation.
---
Gonna bind a /cry emote for this lol

Probably around 100g give or take.  Check the AH first obviously.
---
Triple and then drop back to normal, because you hate democracy...
---
Doubtful. It's just a simple comparison. Blizzard does not have the best developers, but they're not *that* bad.
---
I've never had an issue fitting all of my keybinds on a Druid because the action bars change with each form.  I don't even have keybinds on a few buttons in bear form because bears don't have that many abilities. What specifically is your problem?
---
For what it's worth: The only form-specific moves that I make permanently visible are long cooldowns: Frenzied Regeneration, Bash, and Dash. Also my Faerie Fire macro (it casts FF in caster form but FF Feral when I'm in form).
---
nice.
---
Love this. Makes me think it's a paint by numbers drawing!
---
Bro. I love this. Keep doing shit like this
---
Ok so everyone is talking about ring runs. But the joke is surely a PALLY selling Rexxar location
---
This is a lie spread by Reddit and completely fake news. People are getting failed attempts and multiple game websites have confirmed.
---
This dude looks like a Susanoo from Naruto lmao
---
Must be hard playing the most OP class/race combo in classic...  video just highlights the imbalances everyone already knows about. 
---
Not really amazing.
---
oof
---
Depends on what you wanna learn lol.
---
Blizzard have chosen... poorly.
---
I feel this. Hit 54, got a group for brd, it crumbled right when I got to instance portal, and I haven’t played the past few days. It’s like something crumbled in me when that group crumbled.
---
Warrior's ranged weapon have a much longer aiming time, AND a 2.5 sec cooldown after each shot.
---
It's can't be done that way. Maybe you get to kill him after 40 mins lul.

Google “Petopia classic” - will show you which pets to tame at various levels for specific skills like bite/dash/claw. 
---
If you’re just looking for growl/Stam/armor/resists, you get them from a pet trainer usually nearby the hunter trainer.
---
You have to go out and tame other beasts that have the improved abilities (with the exception of Growl, Stamina, Armor and Resistances). [Petopia](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php) has a full list and rundown for all abilities and what pets have them.

Google translated to "ok please stop talking about this now, we did something positive off a negative, even though freedom of speech is a thing!"

Probably one of the better statements they could make rn tbh
---
tldr: we choose money over freedom.
---
Using their slogan "every voice matters" sticking up for a country currently silencing many voices, just doesn't seem right to a lot of people...
---
lol people actually getting butthurt and downvoting me. I'm gonna spend all night ganking alliance in Redridge now!
---
I have been the main offtank in my MC clears as HotW/NS. We have 3 Rag kills under our belt. I actually recommend this build over a traditional "tank" build. Here is my build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505012130302215-05501310231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505012130302215-05501310231)
---
I have all of the "phase 1/2 BiS" pieces, including Breastplate of Bloodthirst and Fireguard Shoulders, yet I never wear them. I wear 7 pieces of Wildheart + 1 piece of tier 1 with the Warden Staff, tank neck, armor cloak, armor rings, and armor trinkets. I have about 5200 mana and just over 3900 health self-buffed (caster form) plus roughly 10k armor in bear form.
---
MC has a lot of fights where decursing is important. The extra mana pool allows me to decurse when I'm not tanking, then swap into bear form when my tanking is needed. I also offheal. Depending on the fight, I can put out about half as much healing as a full-time healer while also tanking. Even though I'm wearing intellect gear, I still have more health and armor than a phase 1/2 BiS Protection Warrior, and I put out more threat.
---
Note that your damage is fucking pitiful with this build. If you EVER use cat form in PvE, then you are much better off with a traditional build that takes Omen of Clarity and Leader of the Pack. I don't ever DPS so this isn't an issue for me.
---
This is the thing a lot of people seem to be ignoring. It's like people who propose at other people's weddings, like dude, this isn't for that. This is our thing, not yours.
---
The amount of times "every voice matters" is repeated during their declaration doesnt really add with banning.
---
The good thing, the banning produced sush uproar that blizz is full on damage control.
---
Energy to play a video game? I think you got bigger issues
---
Blizzcon better be a fucking spectacle this year.
---
Well and point control in AB.  That's why every pvp guild will have a feral druid (usually feral/resto)
---
Literally every guild I know of that has cleared MC on my server requires Priests to have PI
---
&gt;  When we think about the suspension, six months for blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.
---
Wtf
---
No more Blizzard only Activision.So trust is zero
---
Hell, I'm seeing more than pre-raid BiS. That's Deep Earth Spaulders, Sapphiron Drape, T2 legs, Ragnaros shield and Hand of Edward the Odd. That's a geared fucking shaman.
---
Free Hong Kong.
---
Its not a political message you utter dunce.
---
Aww i had a gnome rogue in vanilla named Merry
---
How does enforcing a contract mean your sticking up for a country?
---
Blizzard is essentially saying they value equality more than freedom and democracy. Which is pretty hypocritical and contradictory. You can’t say “we want to bring people together” but also say “we don’t support people fighting for human rights and freedom” and rationalize it by saying they wouldn’t support anyone no matter what they’re fighting for.
---
There has to be something bigger than it all. If pleasing everyone is your endgame, then it is quite literally impossible for you to have any “values” at all.
---
"The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision."
---
Ya fucking right lol.
---
There was no threat indication in Vanilla and there isn't in Classic.  
---
There's not even an API, the addons that calculate threat are doing so by parsing the combat log and assigning damage done/spells cast to estimated threat values.
---
I'm on a EU PvE server and they go for around 180G.
---
Go fuck yourselves Blizzard. My sub is staying canceled. Sucks, too, I really liked Classic.
---
Hong Kong is *TRYING* to make every voice matter. Nobody's listening.
---
Okay but how about something CRAZY like this?

---
Saiyan pride.

Then CALL THE GUILD AND LAY WASTE TO THE HORDE SCUM! FOR THE ALLIANCE!

Or we can cry on reddit and say how he should be banned since it’s under the TOS.  And no one should ever make an exploit ever again in classic.

This ain't it, chief. Honestly though, what else could I expect from Activision.
---
Smoked is useless until AQ40 when you get the hickory trinket off twin emps, and once you're doing AQ you're better off running Honey anyway.
---
&gt;I didn't put words in your mouth.
---
You most certainly did. I said nothing about excusing the atrocities of either nation. You are attacking a strawman, like I said.
---
&gt;The reason you're seeing the word "whataboutism" everywhere on reddit is because you're resorting to whataboutism.
---
No, it's because the redditors using the term are parrots and don't know how to argue.
---
&gt;The US's atrocities have nothing to do with the discussion. It is not a valid retort. It's a separate topic entirely
---
Oh, but that's where you're wrong. My argument is that you are a hypocrite and I pointed out why. That's literally what the argument is. You are trying to dodge the question by saying that it's got nothing to do with the discussion when it is at the very heart of the discussion. Do you boycott all pro-American companies for supporting a tyrannical government? What about other Chinese companies? How many "made in China" items do you have in your house that you yourself have purchased? If it's more than 0, you are a hypocrite. You people are just jumping on the bandwagon of outrage that's popular right now. Would you be boycotting blizzard if you were the only one doing it? I doubt it.
---
&gt;But neither of those things are relevant to the discussion. 
---
They absolutely are relevant to the discussion as I've already pointed out. I made them relevant as I brought them up. You're just attempting to avoid that part of the discussion because you have no way to justify your hypocrisy. 
---
&gt;If they've been caught in the lie, who caught them? Who is they?
---
Depends on the exact lie we are talking about. Different parties are involved with catching others in lies. There are clearly factions of the government/elite that want nothing more than to catch the other side in lies in this eternal struggle for power. However, it is all factions of our government that has been caught in lies at different times. The media lies too, you can rest assured of that. CNN and Fox are two sides of the same coin when it comes to that. Stretching stories to fit their narrative. Go look at the differences in how a story is spinned on /r/politics and see how it's spinned on /r/t_d. Everyone's got an agenda and unbiased news is nonexistent. The propoganda in you is strong.
---
What to suck China’s tiny cocks, blizzard.
---
Probably made in China
---
xP
---
Wait how does that work? How do you control your own character while mind controlling?
---
Do I just hit the buff spell while having the MCd person selected?
---
&gt;If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.
---
Hahahahaha.  Oh my god I'm dying over here.
---
Anyone care
---
Same talent numbers, and agree about lightwell.
---
That's why my runs always fall apart!
---
It's more like somebody being smothered with a pillow at another person's wedding, while everybody ignores the smotherer and yells at the smotheree.

Why?  Because he found the frost bolt button?  Or is it because he’s good at ganking people?

MMO's are composed of a whole lot of separate systems developed over decades working together. It's quite easy to break something seemingly unrelated when making what you'd expect to be a safe change.

You could start grinding Furlbog’s in Winterspring for Timbermaw rep if you’ve already finished major questlines. It’s not especially fun, but it’s pretty quick exp and it’s better than doing it at 60.
---
That's going to read like an attempt to buy off the anger by letting him keep the money while doubling down on don't talk back or we ban you. If they thought the backlash was bad before they just tossed a tanker truck full of gas on that fire.

Delete your account. Stop supporting Chinese concentration camps and organ robbery.
---
Wait, this entire video is you ganking fresh 60s on their way to BRD? Impressive.
---
Can someone *please* explain to me the psychology behind stuff like this?
---
Why do people feel the need to constantly belittle people or complain?
---
On my lv30 Hunter today I hopped on the BB boat from Ratchet and had 4 Horde players kill me when the boat started moving - I rezzed because of the loading screen and they killed me again (fair enough) - they then started spamming “lol” and “kys” etc in the chat in the broken translation. I just released and ran back into BB to rez then carried on with my trip. Didn’t feel the need to respond, belittle or attack someone. It’s that easy. 
---
It’s not hard just not to say anything at all and move on with your day.
---
It is pretty viable. I collect BiS healing gear and T1 gear for my holy set. For my shadow set, I just ask to roll on spell damage pieces (maleki's footwraps, skyshroud leggings, etc) or buy them from the auction house.
---
Couldn't you spawn ontop of him and sap so you could get the skin?
---
Only thing is you miss out on either shield slam or mortal strike. And no +crit in fury. If I was going to go prot i'd probably do a 15/5/31 with something like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/34005021-05-55225110030001051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/34005021-05-55225110030001051)

What did you farm?

Prove it was people quitting and not just the consistent harassment of Blizzard employees. Give me some statistics.

You play your game and I’ll play mine. Roll pve if you don’t like it (meta insult to those who don’t understand).

PSA: sim it
---
Your analogy is terrible because nobody got on camera and spewed messages in support of mainland china, if they had guess what?  They'd have been banned....  blizzard doesn't want politics in their video game tournament.
---
What a fucking load of horse shit
---
Shaman? What?
---
He's a very good mage.
---
dude close you account boycot blizzard!
---
They have policies. They're not a news site. Thanks for the stance blizz and clarifying.
---
Hey, while you're reaching that far anyway, could you grab me a beer?
---
its funny is that the us government is mad at blizzard and is considering fining them
---
what they wrote in a nutshell who didnt read:
---
We are sorry, but not sorry
---
"As to how \[our vision to 'bring the world together\] values apply in \[the banning of pro hearthplayer\] case:
---
First, our official esports tournament broadcast was used as a platform for a winner of this event to share his views with the world."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
" Second, what is the role of shoutcasters for these broadcasts?
---
We hire shoutcasters to amplify the excitement of the game"
---
"Third, were our actions based on the content of the message?
---
Part of Thinking Globally, Leading Responsibly, and Every Voice Matters is recognizing that we have players and fans in almost every country in the world. Our goal is to help players connect in areas of commonality, like their passion for our games, and create a sense of shared community."
---
" In the tournament itself blitzchung \*played\* fair. We now believe he should receive his prizing. We understand that for some this is not about the prize, and perhaps for others it is disrespectful to even discuss it. That is not our intention. "
---
 "Moving forward, we will continue to apply tournament rules to ensure our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political views.
---
One of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games."
---
yeaaaaaaah..... its totally a "sorry, not sorry" emphasizing their "inclusion of all people of the world."
---
somebody was having a bad day lol
---
This is my first ever toon and I've become attached lol I only have a bank alt and thus subreddit has helped me immensely
---
What quest?
---
I report people all the time for using certain words or making derogatory comments - main offenders so far being f*ggot, n*gger and belittling trans people.
---
If there's a marked mob then you shouldn't be focusing whatever the tank is targeting, you should be focusing the marked mob.
---
The analogy is perfectly fine. The smotherer isn't saying shit, just hurting others, and all weddings are recorded.
---
You bought BoE's and enchants from the AH. How do you think that you will have a lot of Gold after this? 
---
That aside, it is not like mages make that much more gold than we do. The 1-2G every now and then for portals and water won't make that much of a difference.
---
The best statement they could make was we have removed all bans and paid the man his money because what he did has nothing to do with politics but is in fact a human rights issue... What they did was hide behind the politics policy and pay the kid to try and head off any lawsuit about refusing to pay out winnings that were earned legally while simultaneously trying to buy off the angry backlash they are getting by acting like they are being a nice guy by giving the kid the money he rightfully won.
---
I know the "old" rules from an old post when they were clearly spelled out but can't locate the source anymore. "Are references to illegal drugs or activities." was under serious violations. While some states allow pot it is still technically illegal for the entire US.
---
Just checked our AH:
---
Blood of the Mountain x1 = 22g
---
Essence of Fire x1 = 8g
---
Small Brilliant Shard x3 = 3.3g (1.1g per)
---
33.3g total on a young economy. It's pretty cheap all things considered.
---
If I see a fucking enemy I’m totally justified in killing him how hard can it be?
---
Oh gosh I thought I was the only one. My sticker is coming up, though Rag still stays up flat
---
I let dps die
---
i think you are reading into it too much
---
&gt; "However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game."
---
Nothing has changed they will still censor tourny players. Cya
---
A good statement.
---
Of course, you're still going to have the virtue-signalers (that don't give two pennies about Hong Kong, they just want something to rage at) trying to downvote and silence anyone that supports Blizzard's position.
---
Be happy Blizzard relented some and gave him his winnings and reduced the ban. Because they should have thrown the book at him, and anyone else that uses their gaming tournaments for a political agenda like this kid did.
---
But you know, virtue-signalers need to karma farm.
---
Anything that is positive or supports the Chinese government is inherently not good.
---
Does it heal the entire raid though or just your party?
---
They are just going to stack the place with security and throw anyone out who even thinks about the words hong kong too hard.
---
That's completely normal amount to have when you hit 60 from just questing, no notable drops. Finished 60 with like 150g, bought Warden Staff for 350g along the way, no purples or blues over 15g dropped.
---
I mean if you’re not in a hardcore guild it’s fine. Growing as a guild is part of the game but if you’re calling them trash off the bat then maybe it’s best you do find another guild
---
Instead of defending a point or even really making one you lash out with insults.  You must not have a very strong argument.
---
The only real limit is respec costs. Gearing up isn't that difficult.
---
Now I’m a Mage, but am not specced for AoE farming and never AoE farmed. Currently 59, only have one character and sitting on 550g. I solely quested. Did a few dungeons, but only to complete quests. 
---
A lot of my gold comes directly from quests. Choose the most valuable quest reward and vendor. Selling BoE drops can be profitable, but sometimes it is better to just vendor. Skinning is great for gold while leveling. 
---
But the most important thing: do not spend gold on stuff you do not really need. I’m talking gear and enchants. And buy certain consumables only when prices are low. For me that’s mana and healing pots.
---
It's the classic question of where responsibility lies for co-existance:
---
* Is it your responsibility to say nothing that could potentially offend anyone anywhere?
---
* Or is it your responsibility to tolerate voices you personally may find offensive?
---
I stand on the side that allows every voice to be heard, rather than the one that allows someone to bully another into silence. But hey that's just me, I don't have a statue with my core values engraved on it though so what do I know right?
---
wow you are dumb, it is political.  go read the 5 demands of the protesters; nothing about "revolution" or "freeing" hong kong there.  this kid is some same bullshit "student protester" nimby asshole who wants an ethnically pure hong kong.  THESE dickshits are fighting for their OWN ethnic clensing.
---
Where do I press on a potato to take a screenshot?
---
It does have school specific spell power now.
---
you are clueless, if you think it was not merely the type of speech used.  god damn the people on reddit are stupid slacktivist assholes up and fucking down
---
Quick sketch? 
---
*sigh*
---
It's funny when people think they can rule lawyer a different decision out of GM's over something so trivial.  Blizzard doesn't care, other players don't care, you have no recourse.
---
Could be but if that was the case why approach with a level 1 toon in Westfall. Just saying that is a bit odd on its own
---
As they should.
---
go read the 5 demands of the protesters, that shit isn't there.  the only people in hong kong who are chanting that are fucking authoritarian pigs who want to keep hong kong "ethnically pure"
---
I use reporting for spam, because I don't want people permanently on ignore for spamming a macro, but it's convenient to block them for the time being.
---
Yeah that sounds about right.
---
The first time we wiped it wasn't that bad, but then a bunch of level 60 Horde players kept us from re-entering for about an hour. Then we wiped a few more times, dealt with more capped horde players, yadda yadda.
---
No way the shareholders would allow blizz to make a statement like that. When I say it's probably the best statement they could make I'm thinking in terms of what's actually feasible. We did what we did because he broke the rules, but we acted too harshly and quickly, and are reducing the punishment by half.  
---
 That's the best we could have realistically hoped for. Ideally your statement would be better but we do not live in an ideal world.
---
Down with Blizzard.
---
you're dumb as hell if you think that shit was a factor
---
Fuck the chinese government and everyone who agrees with them.
---
no, you said it doesn't matter to Activision, I said it does matter to the individual. 
---
then for some reason you said 'no, it only matters to the individual'. 
---
either way, I was on topic and non sequitur doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
try again.
---
This is pretty much my recollection as well.
---
I dunno for sure on the 'rate' of spawn I guess, who even would, I mean it was 15 years ago...
---
Wool drops for a super narrow level range. You are quite fast past wool. And in that level range you are usually killing a lot of beasts as well. Silk however drops in droves in Scarlet Monastry and Mageweave in ZF.  So you get a ton of people who get a ton of it. Not to mention, ZF is also farmed a ton by level 60 mages and thus there is even more mageweave.
---
Im a mage and I've got 31g at level 37. It's not just everyone else. Lol
---
Rogues give up all their combo points when they switch targets in classic.
---
no they are fucking not god damn no one even reads shit anymore do they
---
the "free hong kong" people want to remove mainlanders.  don't fucking let yourself be fooled by this western propaganda
---
Ice barrier or mana shield.
---
My god. You have to be trolling. Because I refuse to believe that someone can be this stupid.
---
I agree that there are people that don't understand the 1A.
---
However, I feel that makes this all the more egregious.  Yes, Blizzard is within their rights to punish the dude...and the fact that they did do it makes them shitty.  They could have stood up and said, "ya know what...we don't want politics in our games, but we recognize that this is a terrible situation so we are going to donate X towards Y (or whatever other helpful thing)".  That's within their rights too.
---
They could have both punished the guy for breaking the rules AND stood up for him &amp; Hong Kong at the same time.  Instead they did not.  And it's 100% within my rights, as a consumer, to no longer consume their products.  And for sure my couple bucks is a drop in the bucket (and there is so much more I can, and will do).  But Blizzard...they've got money.  They've got clout.  And they tossed it all away.  Weak fucking sauce Blizzard.
---
Glad someone else remembers this and if it is and Blizz finds out you can get band for just for receiving. The whole level 1 toon around westfall is also a bit suspicious,  not overly but just enough
---
Can relate!
---
only retards think this action by blizz was "defending" or "sucking up to" china
---
no, it is an analogy that you set up to prove your point, it is not what blitzchung said or why he said it that matters, it is the fact he took a political view and shared it during an event that in the rules states he was not allowed, he broke the rules
---
hahah you are totally brainwashed god damn
---
I thought unique just means you can only *wear* one not that you can't have two in your inventory.
---
He meant RP Vanish - put on OOC status.
---
The only person I reported was someone spam yelling 'HEY ITS YA BOI ASMONGOLD' on my RP server.
---
So, guess I'm a loser then
---
I AM the tank.
---
It's saved my parties a few times when mages get insane aggro during aoe pulls lol
---
Its really wierd that's its called alterac Swiss and not alterac bubbly cheese or something. Unless Switzerland exists in the Warcraft universe
---
So what is your point?  That you’re a bad player and I’m wrong?
---
And would just be cool to explore, especially if they used mostly the original visions of some of these places it could be really neat
---
This video is like watching the Detroit Lions play against a high school JV team and be like “Damn, the Lions are an amazing team!”
---
Blasting like those Chinese police in Hong Kong.
---
Aim for the face!
---
Text is unaffiliated to ability functionality, so you’re fine.

OP shows pic of SoC proc’ing only once to finish off a mob. I make comment about alluding to how windfury is notorious about doing just that (enough so that it’s often not recommended to use as your personal weapon buff). You proceed to make a comment about “hurdy dur they are so different for x y and z butbyeah, they are *exaaaactly* alike”, when no one was making a direct comparison between the two.
---
Your tone suggests exactly that. If another tone was intended, then you need to learn to restructure your sentences to take the snide out.
---
Ask me about my colostomy bag!
---
Ummm... Blizz can go f themselves.
---
 just use alt and shift variations
---
Have 300 mining, find a healer friend and farm dm east till your eyes bleed. Make sure he has Herbalism for all the nodes inside but the dungeon alone literally throws gold at you. Runs take 15 min in mediocre gear and you come out with plenty of vendor trash and a good chance at arcane crystals. 
---
I could go into the drops but there are plenty of dm east guides all over the place by now just check one out.
---
It's not political. China wants to take away the rights of the people of Hong Kong - it's literally a human rights issue.
---
I love that you think you've made a point here, lol.
---
Right? If it was Pro China or fuck Trump or something it would have been a slap on the wrist if anything at all.
---
HotW build, stack stam and int. Done.
---
Hypothetical question, not taking any sides here:
---
If blitz had said something supporting China instead of HK, and Blizzard did in fact hand down the same punishment, would the backlash have been the same in regards to suppressing free speech?
---
Rogues need 29 agl per 1%
---
Warriors need 20
---
Barely used 3 month old account. Hi bot o/
---
Stop trying to muddy the waters and paint the protestors as evil.
---
Not gonna lie. This is actually a pretty "okay" response. They have been clear for years that they do not want their platforms used for ANYTHING that could even be perceived as controversial. Does anyone remember xQc being suspended in OWL for making a gay joke? However much we all agree to support hong kong in their fights, using the hosting entities platform to express political views is unprofessional. I still think the 6 month suspension is too heavy handed.
---
Idk if anyone watched the taliesen video on the subject. But he made a very good point. If they allowed blitz to say what he did, they would have to allow any player to espouse political viewpoints, would anyone be reacting in this same manner if they banned someone for supporting china on official stream?
---
Completely hollow, sad because I wanted to reactivate my subscription for the weekend.  Guess I will stay unsubscribed.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23185888/regarding-last-weekend-s-hearthstone-grandmasters-tournament) reduced by 88%. (I'm a bot)

---
&gt; Hello Blizzard Community .... I want to take a few minutes to talk to all of you about the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament this past weekend.
---
&gt; On Monday, we made the decision to take action against a player named blitzchung and two shoutcasters after the player shared his views on what&amp;#039;s happening in Hong Kong on our official broadcast channel.
---
&gt; One of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.

"Every voice matters", that's why we banned someone who made his voice heard.
---
"Our relationships in China had no influence on our decision", that's why we apologized to China and said we want to protect China's dignity.
---
In other words : We are a bunch of hypocrites and we don't have moral values. Keep giving us money.
---
I think he's moreso saying "there is a time and place for protests" and a video game tournament is neither.
---
I don't recall him saying "fuck freedom"
---
Fabulous.
---
Highly possible that your group is actually causing it to bug out. 
---
If you dropped the bag you need to stay at the well. If you move forward you will cause it to bug. I think the cut off are the flag standards but my group keep the dropper next to well. Even when it does not bug it takes a LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG time to actually work. And I mean a lot of bloodletters spawning. I know there are more hints on how to avoid causing it to bug in the old comments on wowhead. 
---
I know for a fact my group had failed the first time and when we summoned again we got it to work by keeping the dropper back. And I highly doubt we were the first for that week since it was the weekend.
---
Is it possible to make the names colourful in the chat? Warriors brown for example and so on?
---
Look at his account. New, bad english, with no comments for the past month until today.
---
Druids can herb while shapeshifted.
---
And that's the problem, ganking better nothing but more ganking, it's a disgusting cycle of hatred and trolls.
---
I don't know, those forums are full of strategies that are like "just do this series of complex and highly situationally branching steps in perfect sequence with pinpoint timing" stuff that makes the game a chore to play. Meanwhile I only die when I intentionally enter extremely dangerous circumstances (spider caves full of same level and + level mobs). I think to some extent this ends up being like how academia has "the data" but their shit doesn't hold up once you hit reality and how messy and complex the real world is. Then it turns out that their carefully controlled circumstances artificially created unseen biases in their data.
---
Ofc u did.
---
Because it's funny in certain situations and it's a video game so he respawns unlike IRL.
---
So reckoning doesn’t stack to 5 charges?
---
Get off my thorium route
---
The point is that Blizzard had the *choice* to make this unpolitical, and they didn't.
---
#notallrogues
---
Every class minus paladin has a reliable and spammable way of either slowing or rooting you.
---
you don't understand the 1A. It's not only in the constitution, but an idea or ideal.
---
New meta
---
Fabulous
---
You might look ridiculous, but I'd be scared as hell if I came across you in wPVP with that gear. Going to two shot things with that elemental gear!
---
I don't know a lot of people cancelled their subscription because of this (me included), if that lost revenue exceeds revenue from China then shareholders will be pissed.
---
I think you're right, but Blizzard brought the hammer down HARD on him. It makes it look like they're acting as an arm of China's government instead of independently. I know that isn't the truth, obviously, but optics matter. There was also that super weird post about defending the pride of the country or some shit, I don't even know, I was probably fed fake news about that one.
---
I can confirm that deleting the trinket does work. When you talk to the npc that gives you the quest she will offer to remake either one.
---
Jfc, what is with all the Chinabots? They doubled down on an anti-free-speech where they by their own admission hold the value 'every voice matters.'
---
Are there mobs in the game that can be mined/herbed after being killed and looted? I know it's a thing in later expansions but I don't know if it existed in vanilla.
---
I did. You're just too dense to accept that I shot down your cocky rebuttal.
---
Warlock for sure
---
A mass exodus of redditors leaving is a good thing to me
---
nolife losers
---
1. There wasn't as much information about it
---
2. A ton of players had no clue how to gear correctly. Either because they never bothered to look it up or because they couldn't find anything about it. More likely than not the first one.
---
3. A ton of people had shit computers and/or internet and would constantly crash or couldn't even really look at the bosses
---
4. The majority had no addons installed
---
5. People were just worse players in general. Many were completely overburdened with pressing the correct buttons while also not standing in the fire.
---
k mate. Have fun with your WoW addiction
---
This was for PvP btw not including sp dmg because OP asked between Stam int spirit. Obviously you need less Stam with PvE.
---
My energy is reserved for college, work, and what little remains of my social life.
---
Mining will probably be more profitable than herb for just selling straight material. Herb would benefit more for turning it into elixirs/potions.
---
Fairness is something determined by the winners, the victorious write the history books.
---
Yup cause keeping your GAMING COMPANY about GAMES means fuck freedom. Aight.
---
Problem is the tank is constantly tab targeting to generate rage on everything. Target of target is less than ideal for that.
---
Thank you
---
Why the heck are human rights issues brought up at a gaming tournament.
---
Wtf do you expect Blizzard to do about human rights? Go tell Amnesty International.
---
I cancelled my subscription and I was waiting for an official statement. I loved Blizzard and I still had hope the company would stand to its original values.
---
Thank you Blizzard, you just made it easier for me. I don't regret my decision, and I will never buy your future games.
---
How does having a slogan "every voice matters" while actively penalizing "every voice" not contradictory? its asinine that they honesty even wrote that.
---
1% hit on your gear with +5 weapon skill puts your crit cap somewhere in the neighborhood of 42% crit cap. No one is getting anywhere near that currently.
---
Tank LFG
---
Jesus you're angry. 👀
---
I’m lvl 46 and had my mount in the first 2 h of dinging 40 - skinning some quests and an dungeon here and there. No big sales on ah total between lvl 30-40 I spent perhaps farming/skinning 4-6 hours
---
No dont suggest mining. I need to mine for my armorsmothing questline.
---
Just wanted to point out that we're not even at world bosses yet, a number of servers are down to one layer, and the rest are down to two.
---
Still think there will be layering with world bosses?
---
Oh yeah 100 percent agree but not everyone gets that i guess.
---
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Of course it wouldn't have been. Not in the West at least. The virtue-signalers would have attacked the kid and sided with Blizzard, and Blizzard would have been seen as a hero company in the West.
---
Mostly because most of the people in the West are hypocritical (myself included at times.)
---
If you're into dm east lasher farming then herbing is prob the way to go. Usually a dream foil and gromsblood node once you jump down each reset.
---
Oh that sounds great. I've needed to find things to do with my friend here and this would benefit both of us.
---
Yeah you press the keybind or click the ability on your bar. Only works for insta casts I believe
---
I think you mean time. Because playing a video game takes little energy
---
C'mon, you're serious? It's an illegal drug in most of the US and you can't possibly think you would be allowed to keep it lol.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think it's ridiculous it's illegal at all, but as long as it is it'll be against ToS.
---
No BGs yet. I reckon early next year for Phase 3
---
Lmao grade A shit-commenting (is that a term?)
---
&gt; What do you expect [private entity] to do about human rights? Go tell [another, different private entity, but conveniently not one I depend on for a good or service].
---
Their decision had nothing to do with their relationship with China?   
---
Why did they terminate and pretty much ruin the careers of the two gentlemen who were casting the event? Because they wanted to send a strong message to the community and players that dissent on their official channels will not be tolerated. IF you even associate with a person who has political views different then what the official company stance is you risk losing your career.   
---
The message they made is very clear.   
---
Jay constantly blames Blitzchung for violating the rules. Which he did. But how did the casters? Why are they fired publically?  
---
Because Blizzard believes that the casters colluded with Blitzchung to get the message out. Even though there is no solid proof for that, just the possibility lost them their casting careers. That is very much a decision to appease the Chinese government.   
---
"We are so very sorry! We have punished everyone involved and it will never happen again, please don't get mad at us." To me that is what their actions tell us.   
---
This statement is just a lie. If its just Blizchung who broke the rules then reinstate the casters and clear their professional records so they can continue to work. 
---
But alas its not just tournament rule violation. A clear message was sent by Blizzard to a group of people they care deeply to not offend. I believe its quite obvious.
---
I got an addon called EasyFishingClassic I believe which turns sound to 100% when holding a rod and lowers the music/ambience to 0%. This mod also allows you to cast your rod by double clicking RMB. With two clicks of RMB you can instantly catch the fish and recast your rod. I then set up an AutoHotKey script to double tap RMB when I press RCtrl meaning I could have one hand on RCtrl, the other controlling the cursor and just tap the button once every time I hear the bobber while watching something on my other monitor.
---
Naw it would erase it entirely, even if you switched back to Benediction. It wasn't long before it was patched to retain its enchant.
---
thats hand of edward the odd and not aurastone. and not t1 gloves, but the ones from baron.
---
My money is you cant tell the difference between competitive and just afk thinking you are getting gold but you arent
---
Subtle "said no one ever" joke?

Dont worry, you'll catch up very quickly. 1000g seems like a long way off but just level 47-49 in hinterlands made me nearly 100g
---
I got my leaf last night too, gratz! The demons were pretty easy overall, the only "hard" one is Solenor in Silithus. Both hard because he seems to be very buggy, and evade a lot. But at the same time takes a little bit to kill if you don't use outside help.
---
It's not a beef at this point, it's like those 5 bullies at school picking on the one kid.
---
&gt; The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision. 
---
What complete trash lies! Their Chinese twitter spouted shit about protecting the honor of their great country China. This is such...Wow I'm so irrationally angry!
---
Yep. I said if, but the certainty you speak with is just not right.  
---
Or did you get some stats from blizz about how many subs they lost in the last week?
---
I was dumb. I was still hoping they turn their heads around and begin to make amends.. beginning with apologies directed to the player, casters and the community.   
---
But nope. I was “delaying” my boycott with false hopes but that’s over now. Until they offer official apologies to all parties involved and refund lost wages I will not play a blizzard game.
---
The merchant in winterspring regularly has 5-7 nerds standing at the merchant spamming a macro that buys the spot the recipe spawns in. Basically you have no chance at getting it yourself.
---
The potential market of China is way bigger than EU or NA at the moment. All the highest grossing games are either Chinese, or mostly played by the Chinese. It's been the biggest market for a couple or years now and it's still growing rapidly.
---
So just because i like the game and keep politics separate, I'm a fanboy ?
---
Interesting.
---
Unfortunately that wasn't fake news. The exact words used were 'national dignity'. And I don't think Activision-Blizzard, as big as they are, can call themselves a nation quite yet.
---
i wish i could afford hand of edward or at least be lucky enough to see one drop
---
That is 100% my stance.
---
I may agree with his message, but delivering it the way he did by co-opting Blizzard's stream to deliver his political message (and make no mistake, it was a political message), violated the rules and put Blizzard in a near-impossible position. (Why they have the rules in the first place.)
---
He deserved his punishment for trying to turn the gaming tournament into a political rally (much like a certain divisive politician tries to turn every event into a political rally.)
---
I'm mostly there and I'm at 220 agility and 191 stamina
---
it's so easy for people on this subreddit to nosedive into the outrage pool like FUCK BLIZZ FREE HK THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE  
---
they don't give a rats ass lmao, it just costs nothing to act pissed off about it at the internet and yell at somebody.   
---
They decided to give him his money and cut his suspension in half. That's cool.
---
It's really not an accurate analogy. It would be more accurate if you added that the wedding has a rule that if you are being smothered by someone then you will be yelled at for making too much noise.
---
I would love to see evidence of someone getting anything other than a warning for this, even after the 1st warning.
---
Because your organs were harvested by the CCP?
---
I ain't gonna argue the point as a whole but this specific issue you're raising is downright asinine.
---
I'm perhaps "average" in my support of freedom of speech and expression but that doesn't mean I'll tolerate a guest of mine coming over just to sit in a corner and screech all night. I'm not a hypocrite if I have the person removed.
---
Imagine if every person who _strongly_ advocates for freedom of speech was called a hypocrite every time they told somebody to "shut up". You'd find it ridiculous, as would most people.
---
Name one US company that doesn't in some way do business with the Chinese Government.
---
Me I'll give my support to the cause, but I am not gonna forage for meals.
---
Invite someone and make them leader, everyone inside instace log out so the invited can reset. (If you're already a 5-man, you convert it to a raid so a sixth member can join)
---
If you drop group while inside instance you get teleported to your heartstone location even though you join another group. I don't know how or if logging out during that period will affect that, though
---
Kick the fury warrior from group and enjoy the smooth run from then on
---
"So, you've fin-ally arrived, what the hell are you wearing?"
---
"Its my ass-kicking outfit!"
---
And a weaker pot than u need
---
Somehow this reminds me so much of Monkey Island 3, my all time favourite point-and-click adventure.
---
if you are fighting two mobs they will each be hit twice
---
5% of revenue,  how much comes from the US and other western countries?
---
Sure it might get bigger but China could also change the rules at any time and just steal all blizzard's up and ban them from the country. If blizzard were to bet on China they are taking a massive legislative risk and from a shareholder perspective that is very risky.
---
I haven’t had any issues.
---
On triscuits
---
Squish...squish...squish...
---
It sounds (and feels) like I'm swinging a wet noodle.  Those 5cp evis crits though...
---
Shaman's rise up!  I just dinged 40 and I'm broke af.  Wearing a mix of SM mail and leather with agility.
---
Out of curiosity, why does Alliance need to know Rexxar location?
---
Nice cocks
---
I'm going back to playing Final Fantasy XIV run by SONY of JAPAN. The glorious empire of the rising sun.
---
Op is the end user that suas he didn't click the shortcut. Yet.. We have a log file that shows op clearly clicked shortcut. You prob also think digital music skips... I have a friend like that.
---
You can't even *see* it anymore, neither on the mob nor in the chat (party members rolling). The latter I'm pretty sure isn't accurate to vanilla.
---
That works for blizzard. If you had a company and wanted to get ur brand to Asia and hired me and I made a statement like that. What would you do?
---
Really?
---
Their punishment was far to severe, if you dispute that then I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Bake him away, toys.
---
You are absolutely right and it's not about how good it is but how awesome it looks. It is basically a lightsaber and a random world drop of only high elite mobs which are just in raids
---
It's almost mandatory, I probably hit my macro over 100 times before it prompted.
---
but it sure is fun
---
I know it's not a character you have, but it sounds like you would enjoy druid- they can take any role and are fun to play solo as well. with 1 gear set for feral and 1 for healing, you can do any role in dungeons up to about BRD at lvl 53 if you are competent enough and easily be able to find groups. 
---
It looks like you've spent a lot of time doing herbalism/skinning just to stop at the point where they actually start being profitable to fund yourself, but you would make more money by just leveling more, hence the druid recommendation if you find you like different things
---
hahahaha
---
I have everything set to highest, nice try though. If you think wow is detailed you havent played many games
---
I don't agree. Perhaps if I could see math spread somewhere for this I would change my mind.
---
You description is so vague I can't tell what happened and what you think should've happened.
---
Will only get more expensive.
---
I'd like to see the math you have seen.
---
It's a pretty sad response when the best part is he can now keep the money he already won.
---
Yeah. Fuck giving him his prize money and cutting his suspension in half. Not to mention letting the casters come back in 6 months as well.
---
And you need to have auto loot enabled
---
No, and you, or anyone else, may think this makes people who spoke against Blizzard hypocrites. It does not.
---
There's a crucial difference between the "two sides" in this matter: one of them (the Chinese government) holds a disproportionate amount of power and control over the other, they're not being oppressed or silenced. They do not need a platform to speak their mind. If "Every Voice Matters", but some of them are being silenced, the ethically consistent thing for Blizzard to do is not to further silence them.
---
It is naive to believe any company or individual with such a large reach as Blizzard can be politically neutral, especially towards the oppressed. Being "neutral" and banning every political stance is the same as siding with the status quo, i.e., the opressor.
---
You, or anyone else, may reply that Blizzard does not have any responsibility in this matter. This is incorrect: their reach gives them the ethical responsibility, but it's up to them to assume it, and they clearly do not.
---
Sounds like you're the one having sexual intercourse with loot council and then pretending your experience with DKP applies universally. Sadly you sound horribly misinformed and are just looking to vent.
---
DD represent!
---
SHAMAN. FTFY.
---
Considering how mainlanders act in other countries, (theft of ip, theft of research, being disrespectful, owning empty homes) if it was true they wanted you removed would they be wrong? That's without even touching how mainlanders act in Hong Kong.
---
Yes. On the money.
---
Blizzard has every right to do that, but doesn't make it right or good optics. I disagree with their stance and how they've handled it since and have correspondingly ceased paying them any money
---
Damn, I tried to do this once about a week ago. Looks like I'll won't be doing that again.
---
So i added this, and it casts charge just fine but intercept never fires, and it doesn't give me any kind of error feedback. Also doesn't change stance to Berserk stance at all, could it be that the conditional for combat isn't working?
---
"Oh, you sweet summer child."
---
To be fair the Chinese Twitter is run by a Chinese based company. I wouldn't take what they said as blizzards word.
---
Her fear has an aggro drop like wing buffet
---
alt + f4
---
i'm not renewing my subscription, sucks this shitty company owns such a great game
---
Yeah, I think it was released in ‘98, I started playing around 2000. It felt way ahead of its time; massive map and dungeon system, unique spell and pvp and super sophisticated guild-like dynamics. I miss it every day.
---
Define a few weeks back as classic release is just 6 weeks ago 😜 did you see it in the auction house and remember maybe its price?
---
[Prat](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/prat-3-0) does this.
---
This soo much- dps need to chill for a sec for the tank to get aggro
---
Bye
---
doing something with the sole purpose of griefing another player is considered griefing, yes
---
Yeah I'm always tabbing and I know immediately when someone pulls off me, I prefer this method.
---
That's right, just throw your hands up and claim that I'm making an unfair argument. That will get you somewhere.
---
Beautiful!
---
Sure, but the penalty was absurdly beyond reasonable. Not to mention firing casters who did not say anything political.
---
Yes, you see my point exactly. 
---
Work done to create instance portals, gates to prevent access, and yet no content behind them.
---
Finish Wow Classic and plz giv more content! (but not the same path as retail... nobody needs all the expansions again...)
---
I started using Classic Codex, but around level 25( don’t remember exactly, I was running the first of the dungeons in (south barrens) it had some issues and caused the game to freeze for a second every 10 seconds or so, so I had to make the switch to questie
---
The last time horde did a city defense hurricane didn’t show up. So final boss just kinda stoped until this shit actually matters.
---
As a tank I always use Neatplates addon. All the mobs I have aggro on have red nameplates and as soon as one of them turn yellow I will know I've lost aggro. So simple and very recommended.     
---
Not experienced tank at all so other addons or tips are welcome!
---
Because your social score has plummeted?
---
I'm digging that joke.
---
Regardless if this person was told why or not it should not be difficult for you to put it together.   Why the fuck else would that name get flagged for a rename?
---
I wouldn't either, but in true vanilla fashion the Barber shop would have retail prices and be prohibitively expensive.
---
Additionally, anyone attempting to become less bald would have to complete a globetrekking epic quest for Gnomish hair plugs.
---
I know someone in the guild, hate the guy and have him muted on discord but sadly my friends are still friends with him. He's not gay but he's a troll. I would be very suprised if many or any of the people in this guild are actually gay.
---
how did you get there
---
He can smelt my bars anytime.
---
Fuck this "both sides" justification, i have no sympathy for a totalitarian regime conducting genocide on an ethnic minority, silencing dissenting voice, and using police brutality to take away liberty from people who happen to like their freedom
---
Hard to hangout with friends when they all just play Classic so in order to hang out with them I have to play Classic....it’s a rough go right now.
---
Im so glad i didnt buy virtual tickets for blizzcon tjis year. I did concider it before this shitstorm
---
Always respect the 1v1.
---
lmao they literally say they only care because they got called out on it, what bullshit PR-speak is this? how can someone legit talk like that and feel like theyre coming across as sincere??
---
That wasn't me but I agree with your clarification.  The distinction between a 'silence' and a 'lockout' of a single spell school are hugely different, especially for pvp
---
Ok, we're just pointing out possibilities in the end. But like, the people cancelling their subs can't be more than a blip on their radar compared to the potential revenue that China provides. We are all paying a static $15 a month, all it takes is one chinese man to spend a couple hundred dollars a month on hearthstone to make up for 10 people quitting classic wow. The fact that Blizzard is taking the stance that it is should be telling of the profits that could be made over there.
---
WHAT?
---
Nvm, this is too slow I’m pulling [Rogue].
---
They were definitely within their rights to suspend him. They also didn't have any reason to. That's the problem.
---
Now they're trying to pretend like they didn't suspend him over what he said, which is just objectively untrue. No one is buying this.
---
He s not even referring to conjured consumables. He s talking about aoe farming.
---
The closer one clings to an ideology, the more likely you are to be a hypocrite. Americans, for the most part, tend to cling pretty closely to an ideology.
---
BRD pickpocket runs probably.
---
So you're telling me that a commercial company is completely equivalent to a non-profit human rights organisation, when dealing with a human rights issue?
---
Mate, it's a game. It is not a forum for political debate, regardless of who is able to play it. I'm not going to walk into my spin class at the gym and discuss transgender rights and gay marriage,  same as I'm not going to go into a game and discuss world politics. The gaming platform should exist purely to discuss the game.
---
I do as well, but I'll make an exception for these guys.
---
&gt; Honestly? We don't really give a fuck about the players, the community, or the casters. The money for Diablo Immortals is in China, so we need to make sure their "pride" isn't hurt. - J. Allen Brack, President of Blizzard Entertainment
---
Imagine being so entitled u expect everyone to be there on the drop of a dime at your message
---
Yes. It synergizes with engineering which is a must for pvp.
---
/Thread
---
There used to be an addon in vanilla that autoequipped yiur riding gear for you when you mounted up, I wonder if that is still around.
---
They absolutely should.
---
Video game tournaments and other events should not become political rallies.
---
Anyone that tries to do that are no better than Trump supporters and Trump protesters.
---
Wew lad............
---
I kill the satyrs in Azshara for fel cloth and other goodies. Been there for a week and made about 1.5k in cloth so far
---
Alliance. Sorry just saw this.
---
I know what you meant. By the time you hearth and travel to your new place of choice, rez sickness is either gone or almost timed out in most cases. You can also work on professions or literally ANYTHING in the game that doesn't involve direct combat if you choose not to travel somewhere else. 
---
If you seriously would rather get camped than take rez sickness, then I don't think there's much right to complain since you're simply choosing to engage in it rather than leave.
---
Depends whatever is selling well on your servers economy.
---
Either way you're better of ZF aoe farming, or going dancing troll village to aoe farm runecloth, the money they drop, and other drops.
---
A... Servicable response. But sadly it won't satisfy the outrage crowd. This situation is so crapy that people will always have a spot to move their goalposts...
---
If I could unsubscribe a second time, I would.
---
That's fine but then they need to not lie about it so that other people can make informed decisions and not support Blizzard. In this PR statement they clearly state his statement had nothing to do with the punishment, but that's simply not true.
---
I don't know what I'm doing tbh, I'm new to WoW lol. I'm also alliance, aren't those horde dungeons?
---
The story contains a lie. Probably entire story is made-up.
---
Hnnng Van Cleef, I'm trying to mine ore for the Brotherhood, but I'm DUMMY THICC and the clap of my ass cheeks is alerting the adventurers.
---
I’m sure it’s selling, but if you can hold out, wait until about a month before phase 3.
---
Don't?
---
The casters were in on it that's why they were punished they knew what he was going to do.  I don't think it's insane to not pay someone for a tournament who's rules they INTENTIONALLY violate.  This wasn't an accident it was a choice.  Regardless they are paying him so I'm done here I guess
---
yes
---
You can press alt + up on your directional keys to reinput the last chat messages you sent
---
How do you choose which one to use?
---
When you open the filter.lua file in notepad, the author put comment descriptions of the filters so at least that's something
---
I always have a BM macro ready to respond.
---
/r git gud nub
---
No, I don't.
---
Where was this outrage before the kid decided to try to use the tournament as a political platform?
---
Why wasn't this plastered all over every subreddit before Blizzard rightly punished him?
---
Why weren't all these karma-farming virtue-signalers crying out in earnest EVERY DAY this has been going on?
---
Answer? They weren't. They didn't care until they found out they could karma-farm by raging at Blizzard (who did nothing wrong), and try to look cool while doing it.
---
Mark Kern and the Quartering reacting to this when it dropped.
---
https://youtu.be/4xcyr_89g98
---
They did though. Judging by their history with any players on their platform doing anything even remotely controversial, they would have done the same thing if he said fuck hong kong. What he said was political, regardless of what it is, when it involves governments and their rule, its politics.
---
They're well within their rights to punish Blitz. That doesn't make them right for doing so.
---
So they are lessening the penalty but doubling down on their position. I guess we know where they stand and can draw our own conclusions.
---
Is there an addon that adds dungeon maps?
---
Literally what i do
---
Thats the explanation i was looking for, thank you very much &lt;3
---
I don't know that skinning is that valuable outside of devilsaur leather. You can use it to get the Pristine Hide Of The Beast, though, which can get you an excellent hat as a mage. 
---
Mining might make more money in general and can pair well with engineering if that's a path you're interested in exploring
---
I'd argue that the casters did more wrong than Blitzchung here, by knowingly facilitating rulebreaking while being paid to directly represent Blizzard on camera.  
---
That said, I'm glad Blizz has backed off somewhat and will supposedly let them cover content again in the future.
---
0?
---
Beat me by 23 minutes. Damnit.
---
fucking idiots
---
Michael Scott - Swaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggg!
---
Looks good on you, makes your eyes pop, really!
---
Is Gnomish Battle Chicken still bugged? It just stands in place after casting it rather than following you.
---
Blizzard is in the right in this situation. You could put any business in that situation and they would make the exact same decision as Blizzard.
---
Taking away his money was adding insult to injury IMO and perhaps taking it too far. But it seems that is going to be fixed due to the uproar.
---
Cast root on warrior after bash instead of regrowth first, will allow you to full heal and freecast or return to bear form before intercept.
---
Don't I know it.
---
I live it first hand.
---
Its outclassed by the offtier chest from mc, archmage AND thr scholo chest. Its decent for sure though but there are better options
---
Fellow tank here and I know the dungeon in and out, but yes it's a maze if you don't know it well. It also depends if you want to start with "downstairs" or "upstairs" although normally downstairs is usually only done if people need to do quests there. The navigation is a little hard to explain to be honest, it's a mix of going up and downstairs and in a circle to the minibosses. Once you have done it a few times you will know where to go. If you don't know the dungeon well, just ask someone to point you into the right direction. 
---
Usually you want to start out by taking the way straight ahead to the left after the entrance, then go upstairs and circle around and go downstairs for each mini miniboss and after those are done you jump down and and do all the dragonkin mobs and the bossses including last boss.
---
You can greed. I'll enjoy the gold and take the stance that the majority does. It's literally the one thing that makes sense unless you like getting ninja'd cause the hunter "needs" it, and he swears he will equip it soon! Not a problem with me!
---
Blizzard say "Fuck the Chinese government!" and we'll come back to you.
---
It shouldn’t have been released this early. Simple as that. You don’t care if they release BWL or AQ early? The cycle is supposed to last about 2 years.
---
Just another corporate bullshit of an (non)apology.

Put the fire enchant on a white sword. As it won’t be soulbound. Wow classic heirloom. I’ve got it on a skinning knife. Hehe.
---
I don't think people are total idiots for prioritizing their main characters instead of twinks that won't be useful for 6 months.
---
For combat daggers with backstab more of your damage comes from yellow hits compared to swords. So much so that the 6-set from shadowcraft is very very close DPS wise to full epic raidgear in MC. Same with darkmantle in Naxx,  you only lose ~100 dps using the 4-set as opposed combined with boneschyte as opposed to full boneschyte. Because the emphasis on yellow hits for backstab rogues, getting crit capped is far more important than getting more hit. Sure, hit is still a very valuable stat, things like Band of Accuria is still BiS, because of the 2% hit benefiting you more than other rings with 1% crit, but on most of your gear you should prioritize getting AGI and crit. The rogue discord has a massive spreadsheet on it where you can switch around pieces and see simulated DPS for said gear.
---
Posting what I have posted elsewhere.
---
What a load of fluffy PR nonsense. That Activision-Blizzard's relationship with China did not influence their decision is a lie. The rule cited when punishing blitzhung and the casters was
---
&gt;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.
---
The orginal punishment was absolutely to save face with China, not because it drew attention away from the game itself. While I'm happy blitzchung got his prize money, this response shouldnt sate anyone as it isnt an apology at all (and remember that Blizzard apologised to China within hours of the event). Its a carefully worded message attempting to appease and maintain relationships with China while appeasing the PR within the west.
---
Dont lisyen to this guy lockes rock
---
Again, they said the content of his message had no saying in his ban. Did it or didn't it? If it was a ban for a political message then it did and they are liars to appease China.
---
Please source me their history on punishments for similar behavior. I am genuinely interested to read if there is any precedent to this action for non-violent, non-gaming related opinions being spoken.
---
Thats exactly the point of a guild you bafoon.
---
Stop healing us. If you want to throw a renew/rejuv on, that’s great, but unless we’re in combat and for some reason we’re taking damage, we got it under control.
---
We have a healthstone and potion on separate cool down, drain life, siphon life (some), death coil, sacrifice if running a VW, and our demon armor spell heals health out of combat (don’t recall the amount off my head)...
---
And if the dumbass lifetaps to 10% health then he’s a moron and can eat food or die.
---
You are not our mana battery, that is to say that we sacrificed health to not drink for mana...just to make you drink for mana, and any lock that thinks so needs to learn the hard way. I specifically tell healers not to worry about healing me unless I’m taking damage in combat. Don’t be shy about telling the locks that you’re not going to cast big heals on them out of combat so you don’t end up holding the group up.
---
Hope this makes your runs easier.
---
I think actually WeakAuras addon can do that. Something like: Trigger = you getting interrupted, Action = yell a phrase.
---
Reroll
---
wat
---
Keep stacking agi and do shit dps I don't care mongoloid
---
Yes. Reroll.
---
As a warrior you don’t buy BOEs or enchants if you want it. I made 700g from 53ish-60 and a few weeks at 60. A majority of that playtime was in dungeons. I made it mostly through selling greens running clean dungeons with limited deaths. If your spending more gold than you make in a play session you’ll never get it. Got to set a hard rule such as. I don’t buy anything but repairs until I get an epic mount.  Good luck friend 60 warrior pbis mostly 300ench/300 mining.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
 It was about time you addressed the situation. First doing it after hours on a Friday shows your intent and stating that your decision wasn't affected by your relationship with China and by Blitzchung's statement is cowardly and pure BS [\#NoBallsBlizzard](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBallsBlizzard?src=hashtag_click).
---
He may have his prize money and the suspension might be reduced, but that still is not a leveled punishment when there was no sanction to the US team who did the same thing. Not to mention the casters deserve no punishment, even if it was reduced already.
---
my guild is now disenchanting druid tier gear because our only 2 druids have everything.
---
 
---
that and warlock gear seems to drop more commonly than everything else for us. i got 3 pieces of t1 lock gear this week because the only other lock already had everything.
---
World pvp does, and in classic, that’s what counts
---
No problem. If needed you can research more and look at info for retail WoW as well. The mechanics work the same, just scale down the numbers.
---
They are closer to horde cities sure, but if you already outlevel the dungeon there is nothing stopping you from going in and getting the ez herbs as alliance
---
Well, not on the Alliance side anyways
---
general pet management isnt that much keybinding.
---
'Also you dont need to waste any keybindings on heals because mouseover macros are just better.' 
---
Don't you need an addon for this function to work? and even then your need some sorta keybinding for the downranks. maybe if your using mouse buttons but otherwise your comments makes no sense
---
I'll simply report your posts for harassment and trolling at this point.
---
Have a good evening.
---
Thats exactly the point of a guild, how  is it entitled? 😭
---
That's exactly the point I stopped reading. 
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck you,  Blizzard.
---
r/hearthstone r/Blizzard
---
Ever since Kony 2012, no.
---
Yeah you only need 3%
---
Your sacrificing potential stats having more
---
TO EVERYONE COMPLAINING ABOUT LACK OF TRANSMOG
---
&gt;step 1
---
Get a production profession appropriate to your class (tailoring for mages, blacksmithing for warriors/paladins, etc)
---
&gt;step 2
---
Sink way, way too much time into trying to level it by making thousands of bracers
---
&gt;step 3
---
Finally unlock a full "set"'s worth of plans, roughly appropriate to your level
---
&gt;step 4
---
Wear that set for about 10 levels, significantly after its sell-by date, because you can't bear to break up the fashion
---
&gt;step 5
---
Repeat from step 3. Never ever wear any chest, legs, headgear, or shoulders you find in the wild. Only wear your own matching aesthetic set gear, even if it's crap.
---
I was so sad when I hit level 40, because that meant the time had come to finally retire my Green Iron set. I had come to totally associate my character with the Green Iron set, and it's been a rough transition. I'm trying to work my way into the Ornate Mithril set right now, but this bloody mithril order questchain is making me question my very existence.
---
The things I do for fashion...
---
Sounds like a good time for me to capitalize. 
---
Just hopped on. Someone is selling the helm for 3g 50s. However, the rest of the set is selling for 3-5g a piece so I think that price is just low.
---
Personally I have no issues with it, the point of classic was bringing back the rpg elements of the game and having server communities actually exist again. How a person chooses to view the game has no effects on those things.
---
31/20 I would reccomend over 30/21 as the holy shock will help you hold aggro more as a tank, and also heal yourself...as a tank.
---
Numerous people in my guild cancelled their subscription because of the most recent situation. Definitely is related. It was just a very bad move PR wise.
---
xQc in general lol. He was suspended for 4 weeks for making a gay joke on hit own stream. They dont fuck with anything controversial at all
---
With WoW Classic, I think it's more often the case that they're having a bad *life.*
---
We straight up gave our shadow priest the eye from domo last night. After raid they went and did the quest in shadow spec somehow.
---
Which one do I eat tonight?
---
Bravo6 Going dark
---
you won't be able to equip thunderfury until your tank builds one so theres that... pretty big waste to go to a rogue that can't use it outside of pvp
---
Hi, /u/Chief_Ironlung

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgoq5w/here_is_my_shot_of_theramore/). 
---
The problem was they over reacted hard. They are not wrong in saying he was inappropriate using the stream for it. So a consequence was forthcoming. But how hard they came down was way unnecessary. 
---
The true test will be if they actually hold true and if a similar situation occurs that is pro chinese the same punishment will be dealt. I won't hold my breath on that happening though.
---
The problem is that I've played on and off for thirteen years and I'm burnt out. I usually go all out during an expansion then quit or play Warmane WotLK.
---
AAAAAA...
---
Let us say the Pimps Prayer
---
Wouldn’t enchant green swords, but if you can get two cruel barbs from DM that might be worth it.
---
I'm not sure if nameplate addons that do this exist on classic, but if they do, the simplest solution to all of this would just be to tell your tank to get tidyplates or another similar nameplate addon that can easily tell him when a mob is targeting something else.
---
I'm not defending Blizzard, at least not explicitly, as I disagree with them in how they've handled this in more ways than one.
---
I'm just focusing on that specific element of the argument. You can believe that every voice matters without abandoning any and all standards regarding expression. I'd say that an easy 99.999% of humanity views it the same way, even if they haven't given it much thought.
---
The analogy is not fine.
---
It would be more like a guest who gets assaulted in his home town (where you have 0 influence on) comes to your wedding to through a huge tantrum about how it is not fair that he gets assaulted.
---
Yes it is shitty that the guest gets assaulted at his home, everybody agrees with this. But should he be ruining your UNRELATED wedding because of it?
---
The thing is both sides and their actions (protesters and blizzard) are understandable once you actually start thinking for a bit. The protester obviously wants to get attention for the protests and uses the platform he is given to find supporters.
---
Blizzard wants to have an entertaining event for its viewers and advertisement partners. Is a call for protest super entertaining to the broad mass? Is it advertiser friendly? Probably not.
---
“DO YOU SEE THE HAT?! I AM MRS NESBIT!”
---
That's not remotely similar to this.
---
Not equivalent, but in the same vein. Plus, human rights issues are usually *first* brought to human rights organizations, who then adopt the help of other private organizations to spread the message.
---
You're an odd duck my friend, lol. A very cynical duck.
---
Not really armchair if they’re changing their behavior no?
---
Are you elemental? How did you manage to find a guild that will let your raid as ele?
---
It might seem like that for you.
---
For now.
---
So why the two since you can only use one unique of a kind?
---
No, insinuating my friends and I are just part of some bandwagon and completely dismissing the reasoning for people choosing to quit makes you a fanboy.
---
They buy shit off the AH their just to embarrassed to admit their spending has its sucked. Mine did too in vanilla but several years later I’ve learned the only thing the AH is good for is selling shit or buying shit to resell. Not for upgrades
---
ooooooo............... ok
---
The first few paragraphs are disgusting corporate slop prose. 
---
Screw Blizzard
---
Exactly. You can think of it like the thorns buff of druids. The buffed target gets the threat, not the druid who buffed
---
Non-rejection of a false null hypothesis
---
Keep posting this as much as you can everywhere. It's one thing that the vast majority of Reddit (and people) are united on.
---
These companies that pander to the Chinese are jokes.
---
This worked for me!
---
But what?
---
Finish that sentence please. 
---
I don’t really want to support a company that bends over to China. 
---
I’m sorry you can’t understand that.
---
If someone has the stone altar quest you’ll need to go far right first, clear the ring and each of six snake altar platforms (swamp and worm monsters) spawn of Hakkar mini boss also pats this level. Activate altars in order(bottom, top, bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right) using the minimap as reference, altars will glow green. Take the stairs back up to the instance portal room(where you entered the dungeon). Take middle left path up, you’ll come to another ring with trolls, another six altar area platforms off the main ring need to be cleared. Mini boss trolls. After you kill 6 you’ll have Jamal’an /yelling at you. You can then jump down to the main room with a large hole in the floor. ALL dragons need to be cleared out(any left alive will mob you during the last boss encounter which almost guaranteed a wipe. After clearing dragons, you’ll head to the hallway off to the left side of minimap if someone can summon or has the quest for hakkar, clear room, mini event will start with the summoning of hakkar, kill adds that spawn, large dragons will drop blood of hakkar which must be looted and taken to the braziers in the 4 corners to douse them and finish the summoning, kill boss. Move back across the main room with the big hole in the floor opposite of hakkar hallway, pull undead trolls out of the room Jamal’an is chilling in(they fear, avoid ghosts that spawn at death until they despawn) kill Jamal’an. Go back to the main room, there will now be two flying dragons impossible to miss, kill em. Go to the bottom hallway, will have two flying dragons, kill them. Fight eranikus, he will sleep your tank and drop aggro attacking #2 threat for approx 15 secs. If all goes well, accept and complete his quest item drop in the same room you fought him. Leave and don’t come back.
---
My first wpvp kill ever was a gnome and I will cherish that memory till the day I die.
---
Lok'tar ogarrrrrr
---
I think it's because you have "always show" on all frames. That setting is normally just used to configure your UI because it simulates a full raid frame, buff/debuff slots, etc. Should disappear if you uncheck that option. It's been a while since I used Luna so I can't remember where.
---
Or, you know, the scammers found a different way, like manually looking up names.  Dont need to jump right go conspiracy theories...
---
Does a limited invuln potion reset aggro
---
Priest was the only character i could never level past 15 in vannila, alot of the dps is channelinh or wanding which is a very slow style for most players. If i were you i would just stick to rogue
---
&gt; would the backlash have been the same 
---
No, and it shouldn't be the same. And it's not hypocritical.
---
I know many might disagree with me, but rules and laws don't exist in a vacuum. A person who follows the law to a t is not necessarily a moral person, and a person who bends or breaks rules is not necessarily doing a bad thing. That's why things like civil disobedience exist. You have a moral right (some would even say duty) to disobey the rules you consider unjust. And in regards to this situation, you have a right to protest a decision that you feel is unjust.
---
Did Blitzchung break the rules? Maybe. The rule invoked in his punishment is a catch-all rule that basically states "we can punish you by our own discretion if we feel you're damaging our reputation".
---
Which consequently brings the question: *Did* Blitzchung damage Blizzard's reputation by bringing attention to Hong Kong during his interview? If you think that he didn't, then Blizzard's decision here is obviously unjust.
---
If you think he did, then Blizzard was just "protecting its reputation" and acted appropriately.
---
You should really try rereading all of my replies to you. The only baseless claims here are what you yourself have written. In fact, I never even began with TBC, but I refuted your claims. I’m not the one who has to present any kind of evidence. People do want TBC, it has always been more popular than Vanilla as has Wrath. I never said anything about TBC being supported by the majority of the community as a whole either.
---
First of all fuck blizzard, but to be fair they did pretty much say they overreacted and did so too quickly and so are dialing back on the consequences
---
If you're in a dungeon, you cleave the mobs. Idk about you but I'd rather get my dungeon runs done in 30-40% less time, and I'm sure any competent tank or healer would rather have some sketchy pulls and maybe even a wipe but save 20 minutes on the run.
---
They would have been better off saying nothing at all. This reads like their previous PR statements.
---
+1. My comment was deleted last night or the day before for saying this, but I'm going to say it again because people NEED TO KNOW.
---
CHINA. HAS. CONCENTRATION. CAMPS. BASED. ON. RELIGION.
---
Canceled my sub and uninstalled everything from Vanilla WoW to Overwatch. I try to be an ethical consumer and it only seemed right.

SM/Ruin is the most balanced for PvP &amp; PvE. It's not as good at shadowbolt spamming in raids as DS/Ruin, not as good at survival as SL or single target burst as Conflag. 
---
But SM/Ruin is great at DoTs, has a little survival utility with Siphon Life and CoEx, and enough shadowbolt improvements to let it deal some nice single target damage to boot. It's a very lethal spec especially in 5man instances or group PvP where you might not be the enemy's focus.
---
No quicker than if you didn't take a few days off and played it.
---
Dude! Thank you! I saw this post and thought, wow lucky! I wish I got that lucky! And literally, twenty minutes later, the fucking edgemasters drop for me in ungoro while I'm leveling my weapon skill! You gave me the good juju!
---
Well Dire Maul was essentially released a month after the EU release. Not to mention, back then there wasn't a good percentage of the playerbase already running MC. Back then with Dire Maul the first kills began to happen. If they released it later, a lot of players would not need to go there at all.
---
They dont
---
my priest in vanilla was shadow for the most part but was advised to go holy/disc when I started doing more dungeons and raids, I PvP"d (BG) a lot more than did dung/raids.  I think I'm staying shadow this time around in classic
---
Oh no they are def in the wrong. They are still in the wrong. I am just saying the player did sort of break the rules and had consequences coming for it. However what he and the casters got was way way overboard. 
---
I would still say the current punishment is a bit overboard as well but still miles better then the initial reaction. The sad part was the bad PR they got and it still took them almost a week to come down off a decision they made in what a few hours? They are still very much trying to not piss off china.
---
Rolled paladin..
---
I've tried downloading unitscan several times from cursed forge but it won't work for some reason.
---
They didn't invoke "no politics" rule in their ban announcement. The rule they quoted says basically "We will gut you if we think you're damaging our reputation".
---
Never mind the people who nolifed it and got even further ahead because they raided sm, and got to do torch runs. Both of those were hotfixed away before I got to use them

She doesnt drop threat in p2 p3 transition. While in p2 she lower peoples threat that she hit with a fireball and she will always target the people with highest threat. Easiest way to do the fight is to have a tank in phase 1 and snother one between 8-9 on the threat meter so they foesnt get targeted by a gireball that tank keeps on building aggro during phase 2 while every range goes all in on her so she comes down before first deep breath anf/or second tank gets hit by a fireball.
---
When phase 3 starts your 2nd tank should be high enough on the threat meter. Have rogues and hunters dump their tjreqt when she starts landing and if she still goes for a few range have them run in to the pos you want to tank her and just die if the tank can't pick it up still.
---
After reading this thoughtfully constructed corporate response, my response is: #FuckBlizzard.
---
Ridorculous
---
As much as I dont agree with their decision I understand it from a business standpoint. 
---
Plus let's be honest. Most of the people posting are virtue signaling and Karma farming. 
---
It's like those youtube videos where people are like "watch me give money and socks to this homeless man! I'm so honorable and good!"
---
They are just doing the "look reddit! I'm deleting my hearthstone home screen icon! I'm so woke and considerate! Give me karma!"
---
Most people will be back.

You must play on a PvE server

Yes to ask for help, but not demand them within minutes. Cmon now, relax fan boy

-ly awesome

If you are sword spec, its usually faster to run in without stealth and sinister strike immediately than the time it takes the stealth and using energy on cheapshot

Lol wtf more do you want? Jesus some of you guys will never be happy. You try running a billion dollar company with people's jobs and livelihoods at stake while being put in an awkward position like this by some edgy kid, then add on whiny armchair redditors to boot. What a disaster
---
Then roll greed. If you're ever in my group, the rules are stated up front: blue and purp BoEs, everyone needs. No muss, no fuss, no drama. If you dont want it, roll greed or pass, no skin off my back. 
---
It's how my server did it in vanilla. It's how I'm doing it in classic.
---
Were you in the Wizard of Oz?
---
What a weak and pathetic apology
---
Completely agree!!! Only saving grace at this point. That is what gives me hope, but still is a damn shame as world pvp is a huge bonus for classic.
---
and any decent guild will tell you to fly a kite. BiS&gt; sidegrade

Does seem that way. Hasn't affected their stock price in anyway as it is back right where it was now for the most part. Sure they are happy about that.

You look like a champ^^
---
Thx! Didn't know there were this many!
---
Blizzard isn't a government and everyone restricts the content that appears on their platform including reddit the website we're currently using.
---
They used a totalitarian technically to punish a person expressing support for human rights.
---
That you think they did nothing wrong is monstrous.
---
I hope BGs honestly lol
---
Almost like there's an inherent problem Capitalism and how capital influences corporations
---
You've made me feel better about my Shaman
---
Meh you can believe them or not, your call. Im gonna go enjoy the game again though, you have fun being bitter. I think the response was as good as you can get in such a difficult situation.
---
wow you mean to say there's no ethical consumption in capitalism? what a surprise
---
You would rather we not be hypocrites by never taking a moral stand, as opposed to being hypocrites by sometimes taking a moral stand? Sounds to me like it's worse to not be a hypocrite if those are the options. Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without, to quote Confucius.
---
Ya, but sometimes you don't have that option. If you're in the 30-40 bracket, your options are STV (lol), Arathi and Desolace. Maybe STV and Arathi are both horde controlled, you keep getting camped in both, your only real option is Desolace - and if you don't have that long to play, the half hour trek to Desolace might not be practical! So people try to stick it out and hope the corpsecamper goes away, so they don't have have to stop playing for the night.
---
&gt;If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way
---
Imagine a call to support a basic human right "divisive".

World buffs are falling off due to the buff cap not working correctly. Auras from gear and debuffs are counting forward buff cap so ony buff and other world buffs are getting pushed off from hots and other random buffs.
---
This is what happens when mail/plate wears are forced to wear cloth for the stats
---
Herp derp stfu dude, you’re obviously just trying to protect your precious brand
---
Eh, I dinged at the end of week 2 and had my mount around week 4, barely did any farming just played the game without wasting money on stupid crap. No worthy BoE drops either. I think I had like 400g'ish when I dinged 60.
---
You get a surprising amount of money just from doing dungeons (without wiping) and AH:ing bits and pieces.  
---
The only farming I did was the Satyrs in Felwood for some Demonic Runes and Felcloth, but only did that a few times for a few hours.
---
Then again it kind of helps that none of my pre-raid bis are BoE.
---
You really think all three were in the wrong huh? That's interesting.
---
i have done this for years on Retail when running BRD i showed a few guild members on classic how to do this and they were amazed i had no clue so little players know about it been farming Arena do this skip for Angerforge then Flame lash and Emp less then 30mins in  a good group
---
No, but the damage from fiery will outlast any damage from SS for the first few levels.
---
Thank you for explaining that!
---
Why would anyone want to compete or work for you after that?
---
60 PI Disc/Holy priest. Tailor/enchant. Spent most of my time farming up enchant recipes and selling everything I got other than that. Get a mage to hook you up with water and you can farm Tyr or the wyrmkin in winter. You can also farm the furries in winter vill. There is a chest there on a side p min timer.
---
Other things are farm essences. Felwood/e plg for water. Silithus for air/earth. 
---
Enchanting you can do RFD and SM Herod runs and DE blues for small radiant shards. They will always sell.
---
Just gotta go look for spots and grind.
---
Just no.. give it enough animations or a slight miss and you wont see it. Saying you cant miss anything would just be a straight up lie.
---
Prefer what you prefer and do what you do but any tank without threatplates will always be lesser than a tank with due to the simple fact that its there as a extra layer of protection against fuck ups which all humans do.
---
I’m more interested in how you have so much more view distance than I can get
---
WSG was the most fun for my heal priest, also utilizing leap of faith with the flag carrier as well
---
what a stupid fucking name you got
---
TLDR:  "Sorry not sorry"
---
Finding gear thats almost BiS and matches the rest of your "almost BiS" gear is the best.

I rock a red felt hat and red tabard, over purple robe, shoulders and gloves. Im a pimp warlock with my succubus. Best thing ever.
---
Politics are only "damaging" when it's inconvenient for them. Which deserves all the criticism and flak.
---
He got the shield from rag too
---
My mate (mage) also already has his epic mount, while I (priest) sit on around 600g. Its mostly that way, cause the professions(?) we have. He has mining and tailor and makes good gold with it, while I have Alch and flowerpicking (cant remember the english word for it!)
---
But its ok, I know I will get it, too. Sooner or later!
---
She doesn't drop threat in the transition, her fireballs during p2 drop threat. Have hunters feign and rogues vanish when she flies up so they are at the bottom of the threat meters and she fireballs people that don't have threat drops (mages/warriors/locks). Your back up tanks should be consistently generating threat through p1-p2 but be behind most of the dps so they don't get fireballed in p2.
---
Blizzard wanting to be neutral on the issue of human rights is disgusting.
---
Lol wait til you are trying to run BRD instances or LBRS or Strat and don't have a tank to run you.
---
correct
---
 I'm in a weird in-between position here, while I highly doubt that the Chinese government had no influence on their decision, I do agree about keeping tournaments and stuff  about the games. If blizzard allow one person to make a political comment at a tournament without consequences then that's going to encourage more people to make them, and we're not going to agree with all of those potential comments. So while i think this revised punishment for blitzchung is kind of at the appropriate level I still do not like the punishment for the casters. I've read conflicting information about their roles is this, I've heard the whole thing about how they kind of encouraged it (I don't really buy this) and I've also read how usually casters let the people they interview to say their own personal message during interviews which are usually just call outs to their friends and families and stuff like that. To me the casters getting punished is kind of like firing a teacher if one of their students talks back at their parents out of school hours.
---
Reminds me of Lily in New Vegas. This Orc just smashes skulls and reminisces of their grandkids all day.
---
Prove what?
---
Shaman appear as pink on Horde, rather than deep blue.
---
I don't doubt that at all.
---
Part of this is just that this issue is one that their favorite streamers have told them to rage at, so they must obey.
---
They are seriously just like the CCP in trying to silence dissension.
---
Agreed, as a warrior here
---
I know i'm saying he should swim in gold, pick up the trash items and vendor them. Repeat. THat's all u need to do and train your spells. 
---
Not having to buy food or drinks makes leveling like this so lucrative it's a joke.
---
He isnt cynical hes just on Chinese pay roll

REEEE #NOCHANGES  SLIPPERY SLOPE TRANSMOG LFG

Yeah I saw it too on stalagg it was 9999g on the ah

So hypothetically if you had some guest from Hong Kong in your home and he brought up his situation you would ask him to leave? That's pretty mean but at least you won't steal his money.
---
how exactly do u see the "yellow" hit cap?
---
All voices matter, unless you say you dont want an out of control tyrannical expansionist regime to take over your(a) country. What a fucking joke. They caved and gave him his prize money atleast thats a tiny step in the right direction, but NO ONE was ever complaining about that aspect of this story in the first place. This is about China controlling the words that come out of your mouth when you are in a completely different country.
---
How much did you pay for the Wildthorn Mail?
---
Good for you?

This deserves 1000s of upvotes

Which is why we say fuck them and boycott them.

No, I really do want to. Hence why I play every chance I get.

I got mine because the other guys just passed because they weren’t tailors..  I wasn’t sure if they thought it was BOP or just didn’t care but it was awesome

I don't think anyone wants video games or video game events like tournaments and Cons to become political platforms. Nobody wanted that with the NFL, either. But THAT'S THE POINT. Political/civil disobedience is only effective when it breaks rules and when it makes people (usually the people in power) uncomfortable.   
---
He broke the rules, and thus made an effective political statement - the attention this has brought to the relationship the West has with China is remarkable. Blizzard's initial response/punishment far outweighed the violation. They admit that now, but only after some of the worst backlash they've ever faced. I still think a 6-month ban is too harsh and is disingenuous at this point.   
---
I think it's worth noting that political conversations happen all the time inside Blizzard games. All the time. Every day. Are the people in Stormwind spamming "Trump 2020" or "Impeach Trump" or "Free HK" being suspended?  
---
Blitzchung succeeded in a way he probably never anticipated. He made Blizzard uncomfortable. He made China uncomfortable. Well done.   
---
Meanwhile, Blizzard continues it's years-long and unprecedented fall from grace.
---
Because you've been inexplicably deemed suicidal by the police?
---
You're so right, Expansion fuel just can't melt steel nostalgia.
---
True
---
The player did break rules though. And what's to stop someone from the opposite point of view stating their opinion...then the broadcast devolves into some bad political fiesta.
---
What they don't say is that it's much, much more difficult to be a prostitute.
---
Cleaving takes a ton of rage, and if they pull off adds before you have aggro, then no rage.
---
From all the reading and experience, this is how aggro table of onyxia work. There are two aggro table, phrase one and phrase two.
---
 Phrase one is like every other mob/boss. On transition to phrase two, Onyxia start flyings and now has a new threats table #2.
---
The phrase 1 threat table #1 is not gone but all the new "DPS" on flying onyxia is adding aggro to the new table #2. However in this phrase, flying onyxia start shooting "fireball" to the highest aggro person on table #1, these fireball wipe the aggro number of the target from table#1 to 0.
---
Once phrase 3 landing come, Onyxia's threat go back the threat table#1. 
---
Since we expect 12+ fireball happen for heathy average raid. The 13th-15th person on table#1 should now the aggro of onyxia once onxyia land.
---
This is why you stop DPS once onxyia just landed. You have let your tank(whom aggro got reset by fireball) build aggro back. This is also the reason why a lot melee DPS get mauled by even they are not touch the boss but in melee range.
---
The workaround for this is to have your off tank try to stay around #15ish agro on phrase 1 to be able easily pick the boss back up in last phrase.
---
I've tanked for years and yeah, I don't have problems.
---
Lmao what??? You are nuts lmao.
---
Their is actually a built in stopwatch in the default UI.

Shaggy memes in WoW are my new favourite. Please do more 😂

I think you're slanting that core value to suit your own agenda.
---
It doesn't mean everything you say is well thought out or a good idea.
---
You can in fact be fired from Blizzard for saying certain pretty obvious things.
---
Wait forreal?
---
Is that Malistar's and a Hand of Edward the Odd?
---
Who fucking cares bro, you literally global people.
---
I see what you did there
---
Disagree. I don't really give a damn if someone is cheating so I probably wouldn't bother reporting them. If they ganked me, I'd just tp or go to another char. I do give a damn if they're harassing people verbally though so I would report that.
---
Please at least read 2 sentences of the 3 before commenting.

Mate, I know about aoe goldfarming but as you know places like mara have tons of herbs and/or mines on the road that's why I'm asking.
---
Man, I was being sarcastic not serious..
---
dont you guys like communist oppression?
---
Party only. Entire raid would be a little OP.
---
It's actually a great game. Got too much to do between FFXIV, BfA, and Classic.
---
So many MMOs, not enough time.
---
No, this is an RPG. You're wasting a ton of gold on something like, useless/not very useful spells/ranks or buying items from the auction house.
---
This game wont hold your hand. Mount the second you ding 40 is easy if you don't max your professions and realise that you have to priotize what you want.
---
Also mages don't get more gold than other classes before 60 were the gold farming actually begins.
---
China has concentration camps ~~based on religion~~
---
That's better. :P
---
If it's PPM and not a percent then I agree.
---
Just saying. I looked at guides on Icy Veins, Wowhead, and... I forget the third and they all say to use a slow weapon but don't really explain why.
---
Me am that kind of orc!
---
Actually almost everything you said is incorrect. Unfortunately there's a lot of misinformation from American propaganda outlets, allow me to clear this up.
---
The claims about Xinjiang are ridiculous, the fact is that China's education camps should be a model of reintegrating radical terrorists into society- if the US could learn from this millions of Arabs across the Middle East would still be alive.

And China is rapidly improving their environmental impact and launching major environmental initiatives. Not to mention many of these factories are supplying America in the first place.

I complained TOXIC players and play styles!
---
And you are one of them, so please fuck off.
---
No matter the class/race, everyone can make 20-40g per hour? Without aoe farming or flipping. 
---
If your smart/dedicated you could make more. 
---
I can geek out for long periods of time and one night I made 250g as a shadow priest just by grinding multiple diff high level mobs and high level quests! (no rare/ extremely valuable drops) 
---
I think it just takes a little grinding that’s all, no one wants to put in the work and actually earn the money, that’s why it’s hard. If it was easy, everybody would have there mount by now. 
---
Same reason why people don’t finish leveling there main and make an alt. They just can’t get past that grind.
---
To be fair it was bound to happen when so many of them started acting like tools.
---
Why drain soul rank 1 again? Cheap soul stones?
---
Sets a standard for HIS guild and sticks to it = corruption?
---
I wonder if blizzard would ban anyone for saying something about womens rights, lgbtq, global warming, gun control. All those could be argued as political.
---
I tell the healer the same thing as a rogue. Im gonna pick up agro, frequently, especially when I single out. I got pots, blind, vanish to reset threat to tank, bandages and evasion. Unless I'm dipping to 20% ignore me during pulls and dont even think about wasting the juice on me during down time. But if a mob is touching you and the tank is blind, I'm there for you bb.
---
Yeah I've been playing since commercial release of A Realm Reborn. I stop when I get bored, I haven't played the new expansion yet though.
---
I don't understand how you find Priest boring. The fact that I can mind vision hop across an entire instance, or across an entire map, mind control people to Chuck them off stuff, mind control mobs for secret buffs, levitate on water and blow raspberries at people as they swim to Ony. 
---
You can damage, heal, buff, heal while damaging.
---
I mean, if none of that interests you then I guess reroll?
---
Looks like Blizzard could use some 'Tegrity
---
Strength is more valuable than AP for alliance and will be more valuable for horde as well come ZG.  Blessing of Kings/ZG Buff give 10/15% stats respectively, and that affects strength but not attack power.
---
You look amazing
---
I grinded to rank 11 for the 90g PvP mount and bought 2.
---
I'm seeing way way less chatting out in the world, way less people helping each other.  I think in a month the "community" is going to be just like live. People got excited at launch, now they're burnt out and pissed off at each other.
---
blue and purp BoEs, everyone needs
---
Eww such a retail mindset.
---
Man, if you can't handle the agro as a dps in a dungeon run, chill it the fuck out.
---
Stormwing?   I like when they ding in the Overcity and Orghamar.
---
As a [*filthy casual*](https://pics.me.me/parry-this-you-filthy-casual-dodge-this-trinity-matrix-32515712.png), I'm having the time of my life. Level 30 after 4 weeks.

To be fair, Clash of Diablos isn't released yet, is it? You can't really make money off a product that can't even be bought yet.

Special characters are wack.

"Its my ass kicking outfit, bitch"

Eww. 
---
The twitch gaming generation is terrible. Can you not go back to retail?
---
You're almost like me, except I've yet to be blessed with those shoulders and shield to cramp my style :P  
---
Using T0 Chest and Shoulders for the extra armor and good int/stam for PvP purposes (different ones while raiding, obviously).
---
Shamans can be fabulous too:  [https://imgur.com/a/XNxPDuP](https://imgur.com/a/XNxPDuP)

Thanks for this!

You're completely right. "Serviceable" isn't good enough.
---
China still sucks
---
yes, 90G is exactly what you need if youre honored
---
Unless your name is Sylvannus
---
Not ElvUI. Combination of Bartender, Pitbull Unit Frames, Weakauras, and SexyMap.

I agree!
---
Something less pulled out of their ass, for starters...
---
I can only assume your strange accusation is just a weird form of projection.
---
Unless they're a warrior, then clowniness is a fury bis barometer.

Blizzard is a gaming company, they have every right to silence discussions unrelated to that fact.

His hunter is level 60 though, why would he want a level 20 gun?

#GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ROOM
---
This is my plan for my warrior alt.
---
This shield , I can imagine the process of designing it  
---
JACKSON , THE RAID IS COMING OUT IN 5 DAYS AND WE ARE STILL MISSING SKINS ON SOME ITEMS ON RAGNAROS !  
---
Yes boss , talking about that , I was thinking for the Malistar's Defender , we could have a giant disk of rock with lava turning around it and some cool effects like some fire poping out of it, what do you think ?  
---
WTF JACKSON WE DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS SHIT , I WANT IT DONE FOR THIS AFTERNOON   
---
Ok boss... " ^(Well.. Maybe this random lvl 14 green shield could do the trick)"
---
Dude its gonna take so long and IF you have atiesh you have naxx clear or maybe on farmstatus I would say. Say %crit is probably better then, cause you fucking cleared naxx and I would say you have enough hit then!
---
Most people will never have actually left
---
Theres a lot of "slippery slope" stuff that wouldn't break the game but would be honestly nice. I'm tired of playing musical mules. I want the guild bank.
---
Yawn
---
Honestly I’m not pro China at all but it is just comical how biased and uninformed some people are (blaming mostly the western media bias). So thank you for at least providing a counter point
---
if you're a frost mage hit%
---
if you're a fire mage crit%
---
The two aggro tables are wrong. Try to AFK phase 1 as a Mage and go all-in phase 2. You wont get a fireball most likely but you will get aggro in phase 3 even though you dont attack her in it.
---
yep, except I imagine divine shield at this level doesnt give as big of a shield. Or maybe it does. idk.
---
How cool is it, though, that vets can read his gear progress just by his appearance?  Fuck transmog.
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
Trumptard detected.
---
The best way was for me to offer unlocking for all my guildies. They would mail me them and I would open and send back. Honestly was opening around 10-12 per day via mail. Also pickpocket everything and use the junk boxes.
---
You look beautiful. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
It changes depending on what class you are. The made version has the crit and it isn’t even bis for the mage using it. But it’s bis for the raid as a whole for giving the other casters in the group the crit aura.
---
When you are 60 you have a lot of gear as a warrior with increased hit%. It’s basically the most valuable stat for raiding as a fury warrior
---
It was definitely a multiboxer. I ran into this guy when I was trying to do the Tundra MacGrann's Stolen Stash quest in Dun Morogh. I tried to help him fight the elite yeti but I think I just managed to get one or two of his toons killed.
---
How the crap did that one streamer level to 60 with an AOE mage in a few days, allegedly without using layering exploits until the last couple levels?
---

This. The tank (warrior duh, or alliance druid) needs to be fear immune meaning berserker rage as she lands (fear ward for alliance druid) and stomp her ass to build that threat fast. Tremor totems takes care of the rest for horde and alliance should utilize fear ward/salvation to make it incredibly easy.
---
Too many people don't understand how easy she is. You legit just hit her with your auto atracks/wands a few times and wait for tank to rebuild the dropped threat. No need to have every DD at +200 DPS unless you are 20-man raiding her..
---
What text are you trying to see? RealMobHealth?
---
Fat disagree. Many will burn out, but there will always be a decent community. There was a good community before classic existed. Private servers being my point. It’s gonna fizzle w little, but it’ll level out and stay healthy.
---
I've been running jed/rend for a week. The last 19 runs it hasn't even dropped, I think blizz has made it rarer for some harebrained reason
---
Imagine being this fucking stupid, is a goddamn videogame and Alliance Scum are KILL ON SIGHT..
---
I'd rather do steady BRD pickpockets with guaranteed gold per hour than possibly waste a lot of time trying to find and contest devilsaurs, but that's just me.
---
So many fucking dickriders who don't know the exact details or how things REALLY are yet they are quick to jump on the bandwagon just to hate on someone/something. Every. Single. Year. Our race is getting worse and worse.
---
Not true. Go cast a HoT on a warrior before he pulls and have him not do anything to hold threat, see who gets aggro.
---
You have the same access to google, my friend. I assert that lifesteal is better than crusader as a fact. If you have a problem with that, prove me wrong to both of our benefit.
---
Say hi to Xi for me comrade.
---
Awesome, my kids have done this to me as well. What server are you on? I played all serious back in vanilla but we need more casual family guilds and such in classic.
---
Unpopular opinion: the in-game shop didn't kill retail. The increasing move into an anti social MMO was the true killer. 
---
A lot of private servers were hugely successful with in-game shops, I cannot see why blizzard wouldn't seriously consider it down the line. 
---
And I know it goes against the #nochanges crew. But I think I a shop would be implemented if blizzard dedicate a serious team to new content, classic+ style.
---
They don't say shit about strawmanning and that says a lot.
---
It’s a super rare drop, an awesome looking mount and you might not see it drop again anytime soon. So no, even i, an undead with an epic Mount, will need it.
---
Peoples repuplic of blizzard.
---
I can see level 60s in Stormwind. A level 15 isn't going to see a level 70 in the Outlands. Less of a stretch between levels 1 and max means you get to interact with the community as a whole more. Less of a travel if you need to get help from anybody higher level, for dungeon runs, pvp, hard quests.
---
Biggest contention is, if you have tonget through Azeroth, and then Outlands, and then Wrath, and then... etc., then a new player is going to have to trog through all that outdated content just to get to the rest of the community. By keeping the level cap 60 and having side-grades for different specs instead of upgrades, means all the previous dungeons and raids are still relevant to a fresh 60, and he has multiple options to kick off his end-game progression from.
---
you're gonna have to try harder to troll with that name lol
---
If you're looking for a "dynamic map" like the World Map where you can see where you're going, then no. But you can install Atlas which gives you access to a regular map of the dungeons, and it's not that hard to navigate with it and the mini map.
---
He got a rag from shield too
---
You Peppajacks new top hoe
---
Water and bread from mages is the hottest of hot topics. Seriously though, in a dungeon, selling it should not be a thing.
---
"...want to maintain a safe and inclusive...", it always annoys me when companies use that line. Never comes off as sincere, and instead sounds like "Haha, now you cant say we're evil!".
---
Free speech is an ideal. The First Amendment is a legal principle in the American constitution, not an ideal in itself.

The crit version gives the spell power and the hit version gives the crit

If anyone is interested in a LotR spoof featuring a Dildo Baggins, I recommend “Bored of the Rings” by Henry Beard
---
Any mount that's a 1% drop is open roll for everybody in the group. You all worked together you all earned it. Doesn't matter if they have one or not.
---
You forgot about other classes. Anyone can use a skinning knife.
---
Blizzard came out with a statement full of lies. Just added more fuel to the fire
---
I wish PvP rewards were in the game already. I want battlegrounds bad, and honor.
---
Flight master, portals, elevator, zipline, a giant hand that reaches down from the sky to pick you up, a bridge... Outlands is designed entirely around flying, but a bit of work could change it.
---
Just get fishing buddy for classic. It has the double right click fishing as well a bunch of other fun options including sound setting with pole equipped

---
Not true though I'm pretty sure. Like [this here is a cheese grater](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CTG-00-BG-Boxed-Grater/dp/B004YZENBY/). The front there makes the ones as big or bigger than the ones you'd find in a shredded cheese package. I've never actually heard of a cheese shredder.
---
As far as my understanding goes "grated" and "shredded" mean the same thing for soft cheeses, but otherwise grated and shredded are used like you say. Or something like that.
---
If you have your epic mount then I'd keep hold of it a while and sell once BG twinks are more of a thing. 
---
I mean what do you even need gold for ATM anyways?
---
With all the Chinese money, one would think Blizzard could afford to buy you better clothes.
---
just gotta fire blitzchung
---
Underrated comment lol.
---
these same players cry when they get ninjad from lmao
---
The Chinese system *is* capitalism. They just have a more obvious authoritarian in charge than most.
---
Capitalism is like democracy. It's shitty but the alternatives are even more shittier.
---
Yeah it is, chief.
---
Holy bootlicking. Why are all the Wumaos out in force? Fuck China, Free HK! Fuck Blizzard and fuck Brack's bootlicking balls, take a fucking stand you cowards. China committing state sanctioned violence and genocide and y'all over here like, yeah, but it was off topic.
---
I wish this had been the approach from day one. Things looking prettier doesn't hurt anyone and they can just put an option to turn it off.
---
It doesn't matter if you have one mob or 100, consecration deals damage to all of them equally. If a paladin can hold aggro against 3 mobs being AoE'd, he'd be able to do it against any number.
---
I had someone who posted an LFM, when I said my role(war dps) he just basically said warriors are garbage and didn't need me. About 10 min later he asks if I'm still interested in the run, with his attitude from the first time I said no and he instantly blocked me 😂
---
I try to be as nice as I can since I'm new but players like him are annoying and ruin the game for me.
---
I reckon he set this toon up just to be mysterious, things like this make me adore this game
---
Actually there's [way more data](https://i.imgur.com/5JcSg5S.png) already on the fight club discord.
---
I'd sell it. Diremaul release date on the horizon which will cause less interest, and server pops dropping over time which also causes less interest.

The only class that can't use a dagger is a paladin. On all the caster classes you'd just be better off simply casting spells than running up and meleeing if you didn't want a spellpower weapon.
---
Putting fiery on a skinning knife instead of something like a sword or a dagger sounds like a terrible idea.
---
Yo that’s a flex lol
---
Yep, I think the specific rarity and functionality of this particular item would warrant a need roll by everyone. It’s not gear so the general upgrade need before greed rules don’t apply. It’s more a BoE type item that isn’t an upgrade for anyone and would be put on the AH for the winners own benefit.

The people who have farmed for their epic shouldn’t be punished for putting more time in and getting blocked at one of the rarest items in game. But if you feel that strongly then anytime you want to farm it out the item on reserve. 
---
The chances of it dropping are so small though. Good luck!
---
You're right, that was a private server thing. It's just "/roll 1-6" twice and add them. A macro works just fine. Beyond that it's just normal street craps.
---
What an impractical and suspiciously pro-china point of view.
---
The problem there is weve come far enough to realize a lot of the tier gear is trash which is a bummer. Gonna still look janky in MC and BWL BiS. Not sure about naxx.
---
Happy cake day!

Only if you get up off that crack rock

He's just young and extra woke, it's to be expected

Not stupid, pretty much the way it happened years ago too. Never did it personally , but then I'm horribly anti social and tend to keep to myself.
---
Is it a good twink weapon? If it is, wait for bgs.
---
As a healer the issue is.  Locks run so low on health life tapping that if they take dmg they will usually die before we can heal.  I usually wait until I see a spike in their health which tells me they popped a pot or stone, then I pay attention and make sure they don't die from that point on during the pull.
---
Hope that makes sense.   I don't convey what I'm thinking well.
---
Because it costs so much to give them out?
---
Yes! Say it louder for the people in the back.
---
Not sure why people don’t understand this.
---
I don't buy food or water on any character, especially as a lock. The thing is you can use life tap with drain/siphon to get a sort of positive feedback loop where you regen more than you spend.
---
Full BIS raid gear and looks like Hand of Edward the Odd. Pretty safe to say this guy exploited somewhere along the way.
---
Am I the only person who duels as if it’s actual PvP and whatever you can use is completely ok?
---
Like if you’re out in the world that warrior you’re attacking isn’t going to not pop his cd’s to win. The alchemist isn’t going to not drink a potion.
---
Duel like it’s a real fight and don’t hold back.
---
J. Allen Brack is at it again
---
No, I think that playing a ton of a video game seriously can definitely take energy. It isn't the largest amount, and it's fun and rewarding, but over time the energy sips out a bit, and we need breaks (or just to mess around unseriously on a different character).
---
Totally. A guildie spent about 3 hours helping me farm for my Whirlwind Axe with no expectation of repayment, and then once I got it I ran into a group of 5 Alliance farming in Alterac and we emoted back and forth as I helped them kill mobs. I feel good about the people in this game.
---
Oh right no I mean your chart includes 1,172 Glances, Crits, Blocked hits and regular hits combined. Also I've never actually spoken with anyone who has an Ironfoe myself but I guess the one guy with it was really dedicated to testing it!
---
But all my friends have children and families and shit. There's nothing else for me!
---
You may not like it...but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
I mean how much do you really care about winning a duel/dueling I feel like if you care enough to ask this question then you should probably get a rundown of what the person ur dueling allows/doesn’t and then go from there, if they don’t want u using health pots then express you don’t want them to use engineering and then go from there.
---
You misspelled fabulous
---
I highly doubt you'll have 25% crit at 45. I never passed 17% while leveling.
---
 Strength is always the best stat. Spirit is really only good if you go full spirit and basically most players should just ignore it. There are some cringe youtube videos made about spirit builds but its just not worth it for most people. 
---
Also in general, you shouldn't be using execute. Its better to pool rage for the next fight
---
Nope. The only AP warriors get from agility is *ranged* attack power.
---
Yes, exactly! Really minor role, but kind of a cool guy. However, his name really doesn't sits well with people in WoW.
---
That is fucking ace :D
---
Hey, question , if your relationship with China had no influence on this decision, then why did your company act without process in penalizing this player?
---
A lock needing one a mace?! Wow...
---
Not nearly enough to get me to subscribe again.
---
I say don't, every level after lvl 30 because I think every level is long.
---
It's just about sharing the leveling progress.
---
No way! That's awesome, sorry last time I checked with Babyhoof there was still no info that was published, I'm happy to see those stats finally rolling out.
---
My god this is a horrible statement, they should be ashamed they even put something this poorly written out there for people to read. What an absolute disgrace.
---
I died there.
---
I could frame this and put it on my wall right in front of my toilet so when my non-WoW playing friends take a shit at my place they're just like wut
---
Back in the day leveling was a lot slower, didn't matter what level it was always an accomplishment. Nothing wrong with giving some positivity in someone's day
---
Debbie downer.👹like geeze bro don’t be such a grinch. 
---
I’m more worried why it tilts you so much? /Gquit?

/goplayasingleplayergame.
---
Can you imagine them banishing 3 people for expressing a pro china view on HK. What a load of crap.
---
Making it hail I see. Must be a mage.
---
How can it be a retail mindset, when all retail loot is personal loot?
---
I just want to hear Blizzard say it. "Fuck the Chinese government."
---
No, but they apparently think we are.
---
No, it's just party.
---
I did that back in the day, wasn't thinking one day and dinged my twink, didn't touch WOW for about a month.
---
Both are really bad though. Unless you go daggers, you don't want your main hand weapon to be under 2.5 speed. Otherwise your sinister strikes and sword spec procs do no damage. 
---
I also rank crit pretty high in classic since rupture is not a part of your rotarion. If you mean choosing between items like +20 agi or +40 attack power, I definetly pick agility. 29 agi is 1% crit.
---
I /yell DING every level but I don't build chat it
---
Nice ghost edit
---
This has to be the biggest load of shit I've read in a long time. What they're saying here and the actions they took do not line up. If they truly did ban blitzchung because he said something super political and they don't want politics at all, they wouldn't have gone so fuckin overboard with the punishments. They even banned the casters who did absolutely nothing wrong. They would have also just came out and said that was the case WAY earlier. Did anyone actually read this and change their mind about anything?
---
I switched to holy/prot today at level 30 and ranked a few dungeons with righteous fury and consecration. 
---
It. Was. A blast.  
---
I had nearly no issues keeping aggro and when things got squirrely,  one good large radius engineer bomb solved all my problems. 
---
11 points into holy and the rest into prot at the moment.
---
No comment on how Blizzard will always protect the honor of their country (China) as the official blizzard account said? That's even more embarrassing
---
Most of what you said is entirely wrong. But how China treats HK and Taiwan is awful.
---
Playing 16 hours a day, lots of experience doing it/knowing the good spots and when to move, and free reign to do what he wanted. Once you take the lead, it's hard to stop you. No other mages are going to be farming your spots. No level 60 is going to gank you.
---
But like, that bill doesn't even exist anymore so...?
---
What is your source?
---
Bullshit non-apology.
---
Absolutely shameless.
---
Fuck Blizzard.
---
clearly a cultist. should be sacrificed to her silithid overlords.
---
Nice, my order got cancelled after 90ish days because Target is greedy as fuck. Had to jump through a lot of bullshit too in order to get my card refunded.
---
You know what one of humanity’s biggest problems is? We don’t care about the issue until the issue knocks on our front door.
---
It’s foolish of you to think that speaking of such great injustice at any event is uncalled for. This is much bigger than I think you realize and the repercussions of what’s happening today will be huge in your life time and then you’ll understand why it was time speak up at the hearthstone tournament.
---
The loot patch had a lot to do with making the t1 sets trash as well. They used to be good because it was all we had. Sarah's guide was pre-BiS for vanilla 60 locks... lol

retail bad classic good ! great shitpost retard

For pvp those stats are good. Pve u still want + heals so u don't run oom and can give innervate to priests.

While I see there are parallels between the two players, I think there are also significant differences.
---
xQc was suspended for 4 games and fined $2000. He was called out on being inappropriate on multiple grounds, being flat out rude and being political.  He said “Shut your fucking mouth. Go back there. Suck a fat cock. I mean, you would like it.” Regardless of political stance, this is an inappropriate thing to say. It's derogatory and inhumane, regardless of party affiliation. 
---
Blitzchung was suspended for 1 year and had his prize earnings of $3000 redacted. It was classified as "*Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.*" What Blitzchung said was "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times." Of the three, I believe that the claim was primarily pointed at "offends a portion or group of the public" referring to Chinese persons against Hong Kong. In that sense, the rule was broken and punishment administered. 
---
However, Blizzard proceeds now to say that the punishment was rather administered due to it being a political statement. This is most likely due to the public's interpretation that the punishment was focused around the "damages Blizzard image" clause, implying Blizzards image with China. Furthermore, commentators were also let go for their "participation" in this, although I've yet to see proof apart from Blizzard's claim that they were aware of it. They are representatives to Blizzard (like xQc), so I agree that they should have a higher level of professionalism in the case that they were involved. However, even though xQc and the commentators were representatives of Blizzard, Blitzchung was not. 
---
Finally, as I said, xQc's comment was immoral regardless of party affiliation. Now I get that there are two sides to the Hong Kong protests. However, the evidence for the atrocities being committed there by the Chinese government and the [condemnation from world leaders](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-muslim-detention-centres-xinjiang-un-security-council-letter-a8999236.html) make a STRONG argument that this isn't run of the mill politics talk. This is literally concentration camps, organ harvesting, kidnapping, police brutality, censorship, etc. It's difficult to slap the term "politics" on something and put it all in the same box. Judgment and discretion should both be used to determine severity, and the severity of political statements isnsexuality versus the lives and freedoms of China's 20% of the global population.
---
How I see it, according to this, if this were merely a suspension based on purely a political voicing of opinion, a 4 game suspension is INCREDIBLY less of a punishment than a 1 year or even 6 month suspension. Sad too, since xQc's violation of contract was on multiple levels and he was a contracted employer of Blizzard. Because of the stark difference, I'm under the assumption that their impulsive reaction was in fact based on the clause in their rules that they cited saying it "damages Blizzard image" in the lens of China. Otherwise, there should be some parallels between the punishments. Additionally, xQc makes Blizzard money through their massive investment of the OWL. They value xQc too much to ban him in the long run because he is an asset to them. Inversely, Blitzchung is NOT an asset to Blizzard, but a threat to their partnership in China. So the parallel crimes did not see a parallel punishment. In my opinion, this is a pretty clear case of corporate hypocrisy. 
---
Yes, it was wrong for Blitzchung to voice his political opinion. But the dilemma stems from Blizzard's stark reaction.
---
Well yes because they want to appease China and a slap wouldn’t have done that.
---

I'm just bored and it was a random thought from stuff I've heard. I've never really dueled or gotten big into PvP and I want to do that in Classic. Rank 11 is my goal.

The US has:
---
\-concentration camps for indigenous migrants for no other reason than investor profits   
---
\-slave labor and private prisons based on ethnicity   
---
\-military support for petro states around the world  
---
\-companies that owe millions of dollars for ecological damage in other countries that receive (ie Chevron in Ecuador)  
---
\-massive subsidies for factory animal farms
---
\-state sponsored forced removal of Lakota/Sioux children in the Dakotas to be placed in white foster care (a violation of international human rights)
---
\-a government that repressed nonviolent protest against a ecologically disastrous pipeline in indigenous lands

Making guilds based around your sexually is fucking cringe.

Lol yeah actually that fast and easy pace is why I usually regard UBRS as the final level.  Everything after that is new game plus.

I thought it was 0.01%

Oh shit! I'd be hot rn if I deleted my account for no reason! 😂
---
Do what you want. I haven't been rude or anything I just tried to help. Enjoy the game.

so because you are a lazy slacker and don't have your epic mount, that means you deserve to get one of the rarest items in the game?

Some mongo in my raiding guild called me dumb for taking Ele Mastery over the instant cast in the resto tree. I don't care how versatile it is, nothing is more fun than a no mana guaranteed crit duble spell combo.
---
For anyone that doesn't know already, Ele Mastery applies to the spell you cast and the shock you use immediately after. At level 60 with \~100 spell power, an Ele mastery chain lightning + earth shock is about 2500 guaranteed damage. Bonus points if you cast a lightning bolt first, then throw the combo while it's traveling. Most people that aren't warriors die instantly to 3k+ damage.

What a pussy. Ride or die.

What are you talking about? Paladin tanks are awesome for leveling dungeons when geared and played appropriately.
---
To be honest it looks pretty shoddy. The paint job is extremely lazy, the detailing is very scratchy and there isn't even a finish on it. It honestly looks like hollow plastic with a gold smear on it. 
---
Checked the price on it, $100, absolutely insane price. I'd contrast this to my [U.S.S. Enterprise D from Star Trek](https://i.imgur.com/CaQdCgQ.jpg), I got this for $90aud inflated due to limited stock run, it's regular running price was closer to $70aud. This is a die-cast model so the detail is very nice, for scale this is nine centimetres at it's widest so it's remarkably precise. Or you could contrast it to my [Rodger Young from Starship Troopers](https://i.imgur.com/olBPW8p.jpg), this is valued at over $500aud today due to rarity but at it's release it was only $100usd. It is extremely crisp and beautifully detailed and 100% die-cast (a rarity). The blessed thing weighs over 2 kilos and it doesn't even span 20 centimetres at it's length.
---
You're beautiful.  No matter what you say.
---
&gt;I'm leaning towards no, they shouldn't, but open to being convinced otherwise.
---
please think again......
---
I am confident you can work it out....
---
Honestly, I get they want to keep the integrity of Classic going, but leveling past 40 just flat out feels broken, almost like they put the game out before they could really work on the later levels. And its resulting in a *lot* of players quitting the game. I feel like my guilds 'online now' list has gone from 40-50 to maybe 10-20 in the past 2 weeks. 
---
You run out of quests so fast, and the exp rewards of the quests aren't nearly as high as the massive exp pool required to level. There are, for the most part, just as many quests in Darkshore as there are in Winterspring. That is a major problem. If it was *fun* then perhaps I could excuse the extreme length of the levels, but its not fun. Its actually painfully boring. I am level 52 and the idea of actually continuing and pushing on literally makes me want to tear my hair out, so I am just not going to.
---
No, everyone would have praosed blizzard because they are a bunch of hypocrits
---
Im still.more worried about mages. 
---
The only effective way I found to deal with magetards is chain pulling. They go oom after mad AoE on first group and you can build aggro on next group, while they  wonder why their blue bar is depleted
---
I feel pretty
---
Torch got fixed pretty late, way longer after 10man spam. It wasnt as impactful since you simply were getting pure exp, no drop at all. 10mans were way worse for progression spike
---
Well the term and celebration of ding originates from everquest and youd get an actual ding noise when you leveled. And every level would warrant it because levels were actually difficult to achieve in everquest.15 to 16 could take you days as a solo. Old traditions die hard.
---
Which is the fucking point.
---
What a simp
---
No reason to be an asshole about it.
---
Wow I met someone named vulvasoursus yesterday
---
They make the rules vague so it is actually what they want.  They always have the right to make an exception.
---
True, but do you want to walk all the way to the correct capital city to use your WoW Classic heirloom? Only rogues, warlocks, troll warriors, ne druids, ne hunters, ne warriors can use daggers from the beginning.

 “Our relationship in China had no influence on our decision.”   
---
Come on, Blizz. We see through this shit. The veil hasn't just been lifted, it's in ashes. Maybe if this were a year ago people would've believed it, but right now? Just after all the talk surrounding South Park and the NBA?  
---
I feel insulted that they think we'd buy that.
---
Likewise? What the hell are you bringing to this conversation? Just downvote and move on.
---
I could do that but I’d rather BoK them so they deal more damage. The more damage the party deals the faster we can blaze through the place.
---
My two guilds (one on horde, one alliance) have both gone from 40-50 people online at 8pm to like 10-20. There has absolutely been a large trimming down as more people hit levels 40~ and upwards and realize how draining the game becomes. I am level 52 and I have just run out of patience to play more. The game is not just hard, it feels *broken* at those levels. It feels unfinished and unpolished, like a beta version of what they intended 45+ leveling to be like. 
---
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
---
time efficiency is a skill
---
This may be even weirder:
---

As much as I would like to circle jerk classic, I wouldn’t mind if they added transmogs.
---
&gt; Hitting revered without realizing you need 10 valor tokens to get access to shoulder enchants?
---
***WHAT?!***
---
...yeah you guys just discovered drain tanking for yourselves few weeks back and now you are translating the same logic into dungeons and it's stupid as shit. Wrong, just wrong. Never drain in a dungeon.
---
That was one of the points of the protests, and it's gone for now. China is still trying to find out a way to silence people in Hong Kong. They tried to slip it in but it didn't work this time.
---
I would have said something like:
---
&gt; "We are a game company that strives to be non-political, especially in our E-Sports.  We are legally obligated to follow the laws of every nation we operate in.  If you have a problem with something in world politics look to your political leaders, not to people who make escapist entertainment."  
---
Something like that.  That wouldn't bad mouth China at all, but would validate people's concerns.
---
Eh, I mean, it's contradictory at face value but it's hard to make the ultimate determination without a counter-example. No player said "One China!" in their interview so we could see if they would also be treated this way, so we can't really know if they're just following their rules or kowtowing to one political stance. 
---
This entire situation has obviously been handled poorly and it's not a particularly *bold* assumption to think they're kowtowing to China, but there certainly aren't enough data points at the moment to call the "every voice matters" phrase hypocritical at this point, in my opinion.

---
But in a cool sorta way, ridiculously cool.
---
you look FAAAABULOUUUUUSSSS!!
---
I really value how my character looks but I agree 100%, I find seeing level 1 characters in full raid gear to be completely immersion breaking.
---
Sure, no one likes looking like a complete tool while leveling, but imo it's worth it. When you've gone 60 levels looking like trash and then you're finally able to get gear that not only looks the part but makes your character as powerful as they look it feels great.
---
I remember seeing level 60s in raid gear back in Vanilla and being in absolute awe of how cool they looked. The fact that it takes time and effort to earn that gear is part of the appeal imo.
---
I don't think people will feel as bad about watching a pirate stream
---
China Pop: 1,386 Billion
---
West Europe: 398 Mill
---
SA: 422,5 Mill
---
NA: 579 Mill
---
AU: 24,6 Mill
---
NZ: 4,7 Mill
---
All those becomes ~1,428bill. Bigger than China.
---
Still the point remains, the Chinese population is unfathomably massive. The problem is still that it's not as simple as looking at populations. You have to account for the difference in wealth, something that is directly connected to how much money a customer will be likely to spend.
---
20c by the look of it...

Mana pots can be steady money on my server.

Back 10-something years ago when I didn't speak very good english, I legit thought they were called strip miners because they didn't have a shirt on.

there are so many trash epic that u couldnt sell for more than 50g

Just hide the hat and you look fine. Way better than 90% of orcs running around.
---
Man's not hot!
---
Is there a way to level lock your character?
---
Sell it as you go maybe keep minimum to hit 300.  Just Google what that is there are quite a few lists
---
Haha I cant imagine getting this rustled over a silly meme. Maybe get some fresh air, bud
---
The less threat they generate, the more DPS they can dish out with out pulling off of the tank. Unless threat is a literal zero issue in the group, Salvation is the best blessing you can give the DPS.

---
In terms of off-hand slot, then, how much is weapon DPS better than sheer stats?
---
Fuck target never again
---
I meant comparing a geared out alts kill speed to your average geared main isn’t fair. Any class that’s got some gear at 15 is going to kill fast
---
I wouldn't have bought mine and had put that money towards breastplate of bloodthirst first. But I did get mine for cheap, 260g, so even if it's very slightly better, it's going to have that minor edge for entire classic probably so can't feel bad about it. In your case seems obvious to just farm the free gear, that no one else will even roll for, from DM. Not only is it easier to farm a 5man dungeon that you can fill the hardest to fill role (tank) but to have no competition for an item means you are unlucky if you won't get it within a day if you farm hard.
---
Media attention + the HK fiasco = “we don’t need another PR black eye just give them the fucking name back” -Blizzard exec, probably

I see my four year old geared you.

I agree 100%

haha, that sounds like a great feature.
---
This is super cute and I love it.
---
2v1 **is** unfair.
---
And it's World pvp, both things can be true.

As horde, I’ve seen a fair number on the way to scholomance from under city. I see more of them in Wpl
---
Wait til Burning Crusade comes out and introduces bright fluorescent colors as well!
---
Thank you, all of you. You have helped this holy priest see incoming heals and have cut his over-healing by a massive percentage.
---
That explains that, but what of the cloth pieces with strength?
---
Ding every level, as it once was
---
"Am I gonna have to Earthshock a bitch?"
---
Yea a mace drop that’s not even that good doesn’t compare to a flask drop. But those aren’t actual gear upgrades. I was talking about true faith vestment pattern or something that actually   Upgrades your current fighting gear. 
---
And your right, with the new server I’m on there’s a plethora of players that have mixed feelings so I guess just get a good friend/guild base that agrees with your play style is the best thing you can do. I left Dead server Old Blanchy cause it was full of un dedicated guilds with randoms in every dungeon/group. Now I’m on a full server so it’s more just finding/ adding those friends along he way.
---
No. We do not exploit  this at all, and he was apart of the guild but he left a while ago.
---
No.
---
In my experience they're more savory, but kind of gamey. Definitely need salt and some marinating.
---
Except if you have no intention to use the item on  the character you are playing you should greed not need. You might NEED gold but thr GREED button is right there. Makes it a whole lot easier to not have a bunch of random untold rules thst some greedy kids uses when they play.
---
But hey, fuck people for being decent and go team assholes right? And they say don't blame the rape victim, kinda starting to see how that became a thing by watching the people in this sub.
---
No, because the hunter is out if mana, too
---
Yeah but I mean there's still poop on the statement if you gonna pull it out of your ass at least wipe it with a wet wipe or something cause it still stinks
---
13 years of WoW has ruined me.
---
Well that’s why I said my experience thus far reflects my opinion. Most healers in general don’t down rank heals and resto Druids I’ve seen that heal me love to blow there mana on hots when I prehot myself which is a major mana dump imo. Resto Druids shouldn’t be blowing regrowth on a large pull. Rank cost something like 580 mana. No good rank 3-5 healing touch all day and maybe a rejuv every once in a while.  At least that’s my experience healing. I’m not resto but I’m not afraid to heal either. But I rarely blow hots on anyone as it’s just too mana intensive.
---
I did my first Jed run last night as a Mage at 59. He dropped the caster trinket and no one needed it. I then proceeded to org to hand in the quest for my second trinket. Dinged 60 from handing it in and getting 2 bis trinkets. I felt that was pretty epic lol
---
Grenades are allowed because they're interesting and skillful a pot is kinda braindead but at the end of the day you can use whatever you and your opponents agree to.  If your opponents don't want you potting they just won't duel you.
---
I did this once and it wasn't worth
---
As nice as that might be it'd still be in the realm of fantasy, because well they are a share based company, which means there's no non pr announcements to be had. Again, I'm not here to defend them, I just feel like nothing reasonable would be enough for people.

Yup, same issue here..

It's like you're going backwards.  Go back to the orc lol

That staff is trash and was never prebis for anyone in any patch including 1.0
---
If you don’t want to hear what people have to say don’t interview them. Pretending like current events don’t matter is just censorship. Let people say their mind.
---
They wouldnt.
---
1000% agree with you. Anyone who thinks what he did was okay is out of touch with reality. There is a time and place for politics, a Hearthstone tournament isn't one of them.
---
Looking at the record of masses of nerds feigning outrage over something they really don’t care about I would say absolutely nothing will happen.
---
In raid or in pvp?
---
Good lord this is dumb. Freaking lgbtqyxz people get whatever they want if they cry loud enough. Self entitled trash.
---
He could would he be a rogue. Probably some confused warrior wrote that post.
---
Except I played vanilla but not classic, and this is the way we did it... but apparently I have a retail mindset. Lol?
---
As a healing paladin.  All we do is wear cloth, leather, mail, plate all mixed up.  Our sets all suck.  We look like trash the entire game
---
Hope blitzchung has a lawyer.  This shit would probably not fly in a US court.
---
That is a small bullet point in a much larger post, but you seem to have missed that. Yes, the dude made a political statement at a tournament. Which is a much larger stage....that’s the point of a protest. To use your available platform to let your voice be heard. Protests aren’t supposed to be comfortable or convenient. That defeats the purpose of a protest. So again, that’s the fucking point. Yes, people standing in game making political commentary is small potatoes. Though the rules should effect them equally. Unfortunately there’s a double standard being set here because there have been many reports of Blizzard banning those with Hong Kong related names and commentary and yet the same is not happening to people making American political statements.
---
Where's your main at right now? Sure it took more time to level a 60 but who really gives a fuck about a twink right now?
---
Orc
---
Armor in classic is so bad lmao
---
It's a super rare drop. Everyone gets a chance at getting it. Removing someone's chance to roll because they have a mount is an asshole move and I'd hate to ever group with you.
---
You can farm em too.
---
Am I the only one who thinks this guy is saying he made a bank alt like a week ago and started sending mail but just now logged in and it's all not there?
---
Why would you reroll the same class 3 times? My God.. especially warrior?? Blimey..
---
I've done it myself on my shammy, so ye, it works.
---
Exactly, the CLD or whatever the big duel tournament on US servers is called is just complete bullshit.
---
The only reason warriors have 0% chance to win is because of the rules. 
---
If a warrior goes "balls deep" he will win 100% against anyone but possibly mages or priests. Gnomish Death Ray, 2 full auto attacks + a mortal strike were at least the mortal strike and one auto attack will be guaranteed crits (recklessness) will one shot anything for a long time.
---
It's how I currently stomp everything in pvp without FAPs / Recklessness though.
---
It's happened to me too especially this meta when pugs are of a higher quality and we end up clearing things faster than expected so the tank gets overexcited and pull a huge group. Luckily I've never been blamed for it, most of the time the tanks realise they messed up and apologise. The one time I was blamed the rest of the party flamed him for being an idiot and not looking at healers mana.
---
You know, this would have been enough for me if he didn't blatantly lie in my face.
---
Why, why the f*** do people in such positions believe that obvious lies are ever going well for them? The rest of the text isn't satisfying either, but it's at least something.
---
As a man who has been camped in the barrens by 2 level 60 alliance when I was level 18 I have virtual PTSD and everytime I see an alliance player now I get flashbacks and put my voidwalker away and bring out my succubus and prepare for battle
---
I never camp anybody who didnt attempt to camp me first. 
---
Also it's great being a warlock in WPVP. Feared alliance always seem to run towards packs of NPC enemies
---
It might not sell that well considering warriors get the WW axe at 30 if higher levels help them.
---
I don't know, try looking into the "rogue classic" discord. There's huge amount of theorycrafting on there with thousands of people.
---
What if a Chinese player wanted to have their say would that be cool too. Everyone acting like they are experts in Chinese/ Hong Kong politics
---
I'm a little confused, I'm a 34 warrior. I'm looking to get the Bonebiter axe, What;s the first quest line I need to do to be able to get this axe?
---
This dates back to everquest when leveling took a lot longer so every level was an accomplishment(relief)
---
But nothing stops you from enjoying the game at your own pace despite new content being out?
---
I enjoyed the grind, call me crazy
---
That's absolutely hilarious that you think that, considering that I can't stand the orange fuhrer wannabe.
---
But that's ok, I'll simply report your post, block you, and move on.
---
Enjoy the rest of your night.
---
Their lawyers were probably like "if he sues us, we will lose."
---
Yes! I noticed that ellipses were weird.
---
It's one of those ellipses that pop up when you use a chinese or japanese layout: ．．． vs ...
---
Can't attest to other things, but this part is indeed weird.
---
(Source: have been studying and translating from Japanese and Chinese since 2006)
---
What are those worth?
---
Because they like having their head in the sand and escapes like WoW/Gaming provide a means to ignore the attrocities committed in RL.
---
I don't totally understand why anyone would support such a harsh punishment of his speaking out. It's selfish.
---
Can confirm.
---
In the open world you help others as much or little as you'd like. They are not entitled to your assistance .
---
But like you said, in dungeons you use your toolkit to aid the group. Should a healer charge a silver for each heal? A tank 5s for every mob tanked. Nay we say.
---
Very 1984.
---
why would they shape the rules in such a way?
---
[I see you too are enjoying a weekend of ele pvp](https://imgur.com/a/9ukEncd)
---
But why would the guys who raidlog now be more inclined to stay around with slower content progression?
---
No this is a terrible idea.
---
It seems you can't either.

The orc version of Pootie Tang. Sa da Tay!

FUUUUUUUUCK BLIZZARD AND THE CCP
---
It is not. Way too fast for a 2h.
---
Thata be spread that hate to the mages lol
---
Why will that change anything?  They're releasing a garbage mobile game in a hyper-competitive sea of mobile games in china.  Why do people think it will allow them to print money?
---
They're sticking with their stance of "we did nothing wrong", trying to avoid backlash by stepping the punishment back just a tiny bit
---
&gt; divisive social or political views
---
That's an interesting definition of human rights.
---
https://imgur.com/a/45mQf6x
---
Wow, you carved out holes for your ears too! How thoughtful.
---
Explain the American college students not receiving as much as a warning for the she thing then?
---
It's hypocrisy. Blizzard says they banned Blitchung for embarrassing Blizzars and then Brack lies through his teeth and says all political messages would be banned.
---
I've only done WC so far but if all dungeoning is like what I've experienced I'm not looking forward to it lol.
---
My point is that Blitzchung broke the rules, which is WHY his statement is powerful. Had he sent his boys a text it wouldn't have had the same impact, wouldn't it? My other point isn't so much about Blizzard hypocrisy - they reinforce that enough on their own - it was that games are already political. Politics is everywhere, whether we like it or not. And so to say (as I've seen in this thread) something like 'good, get politics out of my games' is not possible. They're already there. That's why this PR nonsense from J Allen Brack is so ridiculous. He says, "Every voice matters", but what he means is "Every voice matters as long as it isn't too loud and won't hurt our Diablo Immortal launch".  We also have to remember that Blitzchung lives in HK. He was addressing a mostly Chinese/HK audience, which is another reason I think Blizzard panicked. In short, Blizzard is obviously terrified of China, and probably far more dependent on them for revenue right now than we realize.
---
Yes, I want to play some WoW Classic too and I wish Blizzard never did this, but here we are.
---
If some people are fine continuing playing after this I'm not going to try to persuade them to stop, but to me the experience is ruined. I just can't play anymore.
---
Don’t be silly. You can’t steal a car and give it back and expect people to never have given a shit about the theft in the first place.
---
This is not about the money. It’s not about the suspension. It’s about the fact that an American company is going to these lengths to silence someone. Lol.
---
Someone tried to sell it to me the other day and I told them I wouldn't equip it for free.

---
You'd be surprised how structured most people get when every 2min they are being conditioned to expect the water macro. Sure some people find the macros annoying, but it's not a big of a deal as wiping.
---
* Keybinds for focusing on mobs
---
I keybinded my marks to my numpad and start marking down which mobs should go down first. Usually after skull is dead in a pack of 4 mobs suddenly shifts to being 3 mobs that damages the group, then cross is killed the number is down to 2. Suddenly the damage the group is taking is very manageable. Best part is they think the tank is doing it.
---
It's all about tricking the dps to think that if they don't follow protocol they are bad players. Nobody wants to be seen as a bad player.
---
Big totem?
---
Yeah separate the population more!!
---
&gt;The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.
---
Kappa, good one Blizzard.
---
windfury is really good, but then 80% of the time it's like you don't even have a totem down! completely idiotic logic dude
---
Yeah what's to stop blizzard china from taking the stance that it's their responsibility to protect the dignity of China on their platform from such attacks as suggesting that Hong Kong be free and independent as outlined in the one nation two systems deal?
---
Are you suggesting feeling the bern is the American equivalent of the HK riots?
---
I'm allowed to point out flaws in someone's argument without including the whole thing.
---
Um no because China is a super power and isn’t actively being oppressed.
---
1.12 except in all the ways it isnt....
---
Comparing a guest in a home to this tournament stream is disingenuous.
---
It's also insane that saying Hong Kong should be free is an attack on China's dignity.
---
You're an idiot
---
I also agree very much. Transmog is very cool in its own way and works in retail but imo kinda goes against the idea I have in my head of classic. You are supposed to be an adventurer and adventurers generally arent concerned with fashion.... its about picking up pieces when you can and making that part of your character. I think personally id really hate to see transmog in classic and I think most people feel the same. Not that I see any push for transmog in classic, just my 2c
---
It's Neville's boggart
---
Lolololooololol
---
How's that on the FPS?
---
Yeah.  But what did they do to the employees who stated it's their duty to defend the dignity of china against such attacks?
---
Sounds like you haven’t been vendoring your quest rewards. I agree it’s a bit high, but everyone I know who played private servers agreed that they made an extra significant amount of gold leveling from quests alone this time around. Not sure if mobs are dropping more greys or what. My mage hit 60 with a bank alt full of runecloth, a krol blade, and around 450g. Zero aoe grinding done. Spent my gold on two freezing bands after selling the krol blade for 300 before they spiked in price.
---
Fuck China, liberate Hong Kong!
---
They will most certainly keep on with content(TBC mainly) if the project is still profitable.
---
I'd like to start farming Darkspear troll rep so I can buy a raptor someday. What material do I need to farm and where is the quartermaster located at?
---
Yea i dont get this new wave of twitch retail players.
---
I didn’t say you weren’t. But your objection was part of the point he was trying to make.
---
Explain the American college students not receiving so much as a warning for the same thing then?
---
It's hypocrisy. Blizzard says they banned Blitchung for embarrassing Blizzard and then J. Allen Brack lies through his teeth and says all political messages would be banned.
---
It's disgusting and their apologists are worse.
---
And yet he did.
---
It doesn't matter what you use.
---
Don't worry they are . netherwinter un layered server at auction house . https://imgur.com/a/UALNdF1
---
Bitch, where's my gold at?
---
It's laughably pathetic that that's your take from this.
---
Do you know anything about China? Their history or in the present day?
---
Yeah it was definitely the afk ones
---
Sell now.
---
Sorry to be the bringer of bad news but Nightblade sucks. Its just way too fast to be a good 2 handed weapon so its mostly something people waste the small amount of gold they have while leveling (people like this tend to be poor). 
---
Twink weapons looks more like Pendulum of Doom (worth about 2k gold already). Reasons below;
---
1. Close to same DPS (~5 DPS less), 
---
2. ~40% more damage per hit (in PvP you dont have 100% swing uptime like in PvE)
---
3. ~40% stronger proc effect.
---
So, in one hit with the "Epic" Nightblade you could probably deal up towards 800 DMG with some lucky crits and procs. Pendulum of Doom on the orher hand can easily deal 1400 DMG.
---
If we continue to remove the path to redemption from our society we will cease to be human. This is far too emotional of a reaction.
---
Agreed. Totally happy for people that are still into it, but don't feel like supporting them myself.
---
I enjoyed WoW as an escape too, but cannot if the company behind it is a part of the problem.
---
This guy PRs
---
It's trivially easy to keep a realm heavily populated, just as it is trivially easy to reduce a population, one by combining lower pop realms, and the other transfers.  
---
What isn't easy as I've found out, is ensuring there are enough people to group with as you level, because unlike when I started weeks ago, when I returned there was no one in my zones trying to group up for elite quests, and there was no one running two popular dungeons for my level range despite the server still being Layered and having a queue time.
---
This isn't going to separate the population, it's consolidating it, and affording a unique opportunity to those who missed it, or people who are into new servers for whatever reason.
---
Who names a dungeon after its final boss?
---
Well we all still think your a shit company! And you wont be getting anymore $$$ from me.
---
Lol wait did he kick Payo's Hunter? Wow
---
Never liked him, still dont
---
Well, I locked my frames at 60 after the initial dip from the post processing. This did not lower it any.
---
What can I purchase with 20 dildos?
---
Lookin fresh my man.
---
Doubt you can banish him, he's a boss.
---
These guys are pretty far underground so the first way is probably right as a blizz joke
---
do you know what i am saying?
---
Just an FYI that mace is one of the best weapons a rogue can find at that level, check out the speed and dps compared to other on lvl items, so him needing for need is plausible although i sympathize with the healers watching a rogue take that item.
---
when I make groups on my warrior to tank I invite 3 mages and 1 priest, there is no target marking that will save me.
---
As a herbalist, what should I be selling now before dire maul devalues it? I have tons of dreamfoil in the bank, among others
---
he already posted a googledoc full of sources
---
But various guides says the chance to resist increases when the mob is the same level or higher - so how much higher level do you have to be to negate the chance to resist totally?
---
This is soo American approach to things. I lived part of my live under communist regime and yk what? Not everything has to be about politics. Some places deserve to be apolitical.
---
Sure... Head on.. At the exact second you pulled a mob :)
---
So i just had Warden's staff drop for me, does anyone know whats its roughly worth? someone offered 150g but im fairly certain its worth literally double that.
---
Yeah, he's on a leash too. Also, if you go too far back over the bridge (assuming you closed it) you will notice that the fight spawns 8 or so fireguard destroyers on the other side of the bridge as a road block against kiting.
---
Could be worse. Guy in my guild got both the raid BIS MH and OH swords before getting any pre-bis gear.
---
That's my thought process honestly, im going to be tanking alot on a pvp server, and the extra prot might be more usefull then going for enrage, but im not extremely knowledgeable on vanilla warrior.
---
Tryhard/nolife strat is this...  
---
level with skinning/mining. Sell leather for gold, and stash ore/rocks on bank alts (I have 4).   
---
Ding 60. Drop skinning, and pick up enchanting. Level to 265 and make Smoking Hearth of the mountain. Drop enchanting. Pick up blacksmithing and make Glearming Mithril Insignia.   
---
THen drop mining and level engineering.   
---
Pick up fishing.   
---
Now you can fish in peace.
---
Have you seen the dmg range on that mace lol? It's super good for rogues though it should go to healers first....
---
Ok this is the wow classic sub though not your blog
---
What is the point of making a statement at all when it's so transparently false?
---
I HAVE A FULL BAR OF RAGE!!!!!111!!!!
---
And that won't happen if they slow down the content? If anything once the players decrease I suspect they will merge servers to keep a few high pop ones.
---
Mah bad.
---
The argument there, imo, isn't to introduce transmogs but to fix that in Classic+ by making sure that endgame pre-raid gear still looks tolerably nice in what ends up being relatively optimal gear.
---
Vanilla wasn't perfect, but it got fixed in the wrong way. The problems were very much real though, like not wanting to look like a hobo in your best pre-raid gear.
---
Yes, it is indeed hypocritical to not punish those American college students for the same thing. You can be against some of the things Blizzard has done yet not agree with everyone's point on the offensive. They're not mutually exclusive...
---
I agree. I'm on alliance side on a horde favored server and it's like a ghost town, feels completely dead besides Horde
---
This is probably about the best we can expect.  They're really in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.  Had they done nothing at all, and ignored it in the first place, the entire thing might have been a non-issue.  Since they did, they were stuck having to both placate the US (and most everyone else) and China.  Not admitting a relationship with China, and keeping some sort of punishment helps keep China.  Giving the winnings back, and halving the suspension time, helps show everyone else that they know they fucked up.  Definitely would not want to be in their shoes.
---
As much i support Hong Kong indenpendence on Mainland China, i wont cancel my wow sub and wont stop playing WoW.
---
Why isnt anyone mad entire Hong Kong situation isnt discussed by UN? And UN defence Council? Yk.... ppl who actually can change things and are mad at gaming company. 
---
Wanna support Hong Kong? Dont boycott blizzard. Get rid off your chinese manofactured iPhones, your chinese made clothes, take a damn sign and protest at nearby chinese embassy.
---
hmmm wonder if its capitalism or an authoritarian government thats the cause of all this. Nope must be capitalism since this doesn't happen in other countries.
---
It would highlight their pandering, that's true.  And it would make it more difficult to pander in the future.
---
But that's better than invalidating people's belief that China had something do do with it, because, holy shit, of course they did.
---
Saw an ally player in bigglesworth with one 2 weeks ago
---
Hot damn. 
---
Gotta love Classic!
---
Hunter’s shouldn’t be eating or drinking. It’s easy to play efficiently and never need to drink outside of multiple mob pulls.
---
Lame cop out. But the good news is that the pressure we have started to apply is working. 
---
Remain strong. For freedom, for justice, for the men and women risking their lives in Hong Kong for what’s rightfully theirs.

---
You can get to 210 there
---
You're beautiful
---
Terrible idea.  Would fracture many current servers with people jumping ship because a new server is fun.  Transfers and mergers are not a fix to this.  So you fell way out of the pack, just level with quests and catch up to the back end still leveling and you'll get easy groups again.  Right now most people are working on their main still and don't have time to work an alt up so you need to catch the other slow levelers by questing.  Don't sit around all day trying to make a group for a dungeon if it isn't there.
---
I agree it doesn't read like it was written by a native English speaker.  I've been studying Japanese since 2000 (I'm literally in Japan on vacation as I type this), and there are a bunch of little things that read very...Asian.
---
Lol
---
Honestly some vanilla zones have a great Sky box . Definitely amazing for its time
---
at  least the pet can tank unlike the mage who will just run past the healer and frost nova the mobs next to them.
---
This is complete garbage.  Free transfers are going on right now, that's actually separating the population.  People have been able to move from certain servers since a few days into classic.
---
As far as your second point, I can't roll on a more populated server, I'm on one of the most populated servers, and I still couldn't find a group.  There's no server that exists right now that can fix my problem . . . which is why I want a new server!  I'm sure there are people in the same boat as me, but 30 people on 30 different servers can't form a group, instead we all have to level solo.
---
If it isn't for you, that's fine, no one is forcing you to go to a new server.  As for me, it'll probably make or break if I decide to keep playing.  I don't mind rerolling and getting a fresh start, but I'm just not interested in soloing through the next 30 levels.
---
Having already yanked several dungeons, when I switch to my hunter I always wait about 3 seconds to unleash and another 3-5 seconds before using multi shot.  Overzealous dps sucks.
---
Just get unbelievably lucky and you can too!
---
China baned Pooh for looking too much like their leader who can't be criticized under Chinese law
---
The dual wield penalty applies to both weapons not just offhand that's why hit is so significant
---
No, your point with that paragraph was that political speech is happening all the time in Blizzard games yet people aren't getting suspended for it, UNLIKE the current situation with Bliztchung. It was clearly a response to the section from J Allen talking about political speech at their events.
---
It varies server to server. If you get an addon like TSM it should show you the market value over time.
---
Again I completely agree that China’s acting like a piece of shit, but still maintain that it is inappropriate to express personal political views when representing a company on that company’s broadcast.
---
That was really stupid line to add. They shouldn't have mention China by name at all. Just make general statement about political comments on broadcasts etc.
---
That line makes people think that China was 100% the reason. Which is of course was too.
---
This is such a a half-assed load of bullshit lol.
---
Tier 3 is beautiful. So it isn’t all game.
---
I was just in the Lyceum Torch Room the other day in Classic 1.13.x these mobs no longer give XP and the farm will not work! T\_T
---
....nice hat.
---
The joke is you not knowing pink is for faction classes for both...
---
This shit is the dumbest shit ive ever seen, stop fuckin worrying about doing sfk rfk wc its not integral to your leveling/experience/momey/etc. 0 reason for "fresh" servers.
---
Is there any addon that shows incoming heals that work with Shadowed Unit Frames addon? My guild finally started raiding this week and not having a way to notice incoming heals is a huge problem for me.
---
I go for the Nutella.

"Tank taunt"
---
"I'm a paladin"
---
"That is a small bullet point in a much larger post"

Oh, okay. My mistake.
---
Yep! Everyone needs large sums of gold.
---
The set bonus is 2% crit. The hit is just on Bloodvine. Still good, possibly even worth leveling tailoring again.

no it wasn't
---
They aren't unique, but CD is shared though. The on use heal is meh anyways so not a huge loss.
---
Pop a Mighty Trolls blood potion and a Scroll of Spirit IV at the same time and your HP regen is actually insane between mobs. Sounds a bit silly with the spirit, but warriors get the most HP regen from spirit of any class, by far.
---
need gold is greed not need
---
so then everyone should roll on every bop item cause its worth a few gold then, seems fair
---
Lmfao , i looked like aquaman wearing flower pots for boots at lvl 17 priest xD was terrible
---
It's currently not separated at all and plentiful, so...
---
If you stay at the top a healer can drop combat for a bit to mana up
---
Thanks! You remind me why I love to play Druid. It's arguably more fun than a Mage for many reasons.

Hey, welcome to my experience, except I basically missed launch.  I created a thread about it,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgq5ap/dire\_maul\_should\_come\_with\_fresh\_servers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgq5ap/dire_maul_should_come_with_fresh_servers/) 
---
 but apparently it's a cancerous idea to start a new server for people like us, because . . . uhhh, no changes . . or something?
---
Not even close.
---
Thanks
---
You're right, I was referring to heirloom gear there and got them mixed up. Still it applies to how I find it immersion breaking.
---
You're in the correct group channel right?   Like    /LookingForGroup, and not spamming in trade channel? I'm in sulfuras which is still layered, and I've seen quite a large resurgence of people looking for lower level dungeons
---
Yes, I would rather play support in a 5 man rather than main heal. Nothing wrong with back up HoTs with a priest main heal while we both contribute with our DoTs or some damage spells. Healer won't go oom with having two heals and I've never seen it hurt a 5 man group if your dps and tank are decent. Or just spec feral and pop out for occasional HoTs or, of course, battle rez.
---
The heirloom sets
---
stfu.  You aren't quitting.
---
So, your daughter talked you into playing dress up while your son talked you into playing knights and here we are.
---
Ah ok good to know. I was reading an old guide and they said it was possible by that level, might have been wrong. 
---
When I did it in vanilla I just remember farming runecloth for ages.
---
But greed in game is for gold. The icon literally shows you this.
---
I know we all need gold, I'm a warrior. The Freezing Band that dropped and I greeded and gave the okay for the mage to need could have bought me a Lionheart Helm to last me through all of Classic. My demand was that he used it, as he did.
---
Go into a raid setting and try to roll for a BoE item that you can't use. Its from trash and is worth about 400-500g which everyone needs but no one is going to give you the item.
---
I see were you are coming from and if all agree you could all select need, if one greeds and no one has the intent to use the item all should greed. Simple as that really.
---
I mean we did have xmog weapons and gear for challenge modes a few years ago but they took it all out for some reason.
---
OHH NO WE GOT TO PLAY THE GAME WITH NO ADDONS THAT DRASTICALLY CHANGE HOW HARD THE END GAME BOSS IS! 
---
WHAT WILL WE DO IF WE HAVE TO PLAY CLASSIC CLASSIC wow 😮 
---
Back to 2019 wow were they just give u lvl 100s and shit lmao
---
Not really, everyone in the group deserves a shot at that gold equally.
---
Epic info mate. Just saved your comment to remind me when the time comes.
---
I had no idea and it is a nice plan to do like you said. Thanks for your time.

Here's a guy that's an example of what I'm talking about . .  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgqe8b/i\_miss\_launch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgqe8b/i_miss_launch/) 
---
Also, you sound like you are telling me how to play and enjoy the game.  You wouldn't tell a bunch of level 60s to stop running MC, UBRS, and LBRS and instead roll alts so I had groups to join, so seems weird to me you think I should have to conform to how other people want to play or are currently playing.
---
"every voice matters" except if the voice is saying free Hong Kong or criticising Blizzard for they actions and blatant disregard for human rights.
---
... It was. I was there.
---
I mean it's always a choice. I am in my early thirties but still play games a good 10 hours per day, sure I might not have a gf or kids but don't think it would be worth giving up my passions for. Also world is overpopulated as it is so I am doing my surroundings a favor.
---
Welcome to my world
---
Honestly? It's both.
---
The problem lies in the fact that the economic interests of globalized companies is powerful enough that they start enforcing censorship on their platforms.
---
We've hit a very tricky spot legally where much of free speech is taking place on private platforms. So while companies have every right to decide how their platform functions, what happens in situations like this where large platforms bend to the will of an authoritarian government abroad?
---
I saw a moon, so I sheeped it!!   Why are you guys not helping me?

Rogues were always good for leveling for several reasons:
---
 - Unlike Warriors who rely on large HP pool that takes ages to recover, Rogues rely more on mitigation(dodge) while still having respectable 0.5hp/s regen from Spirit
---
 - The downtime, if any, is not as noticeable since rather than standing and waiting for your HP to regen you do it while stealthing towards the next enemy
---
 - Their entire class is built for bursting single enemies down, which is 99% of leveling in WoW
---
 - They have an interrupt against casters
---
Lol triggered trumptard

this is not a shitty pserver subreddit lol

You know, you only needed to get to 29. You didn't have to edge yourself to just barely below 30.
---
Don’t you get it? Can’t you see the hat? I AM MRS NESBITT HAHAHHAUHAUAHAAUH

Yuuuup haha
---
It's a multiplayer game you are doing things together

what the fuck??

Do pvp kills give xp?

Right?  No int or spirit, wasted huntree item.

This is what peak performance looks like
---
Does the choice of these men to prefer the genitalia of other men concern you? Is that why you are reducing it to sex as if there weren't a subculture of gays who would want to game together? Does it bother you that these days they aren't forced into the closet and are treated as just another group of people?
---
LookingForGroup exists as a blizzard approved channel. Try to raise awareness in your server and suggest people move to LFG?
---
Both are fairly active at high levels in my server at least.
---
deep dark fantasies
---
In an attempt to make it more interesting to watch or reduce duel length time.
---
But personally I think it ruins the whole thing. Its the same in arenas in retail were Bloodlust/Ankh/Lay on Hands cannot be used because those big cd abilties are too strong to be used in a single pvp fight and is only balanced around PvE.
---
But hey, on the bright side - in classic we got that juicy wpvp back so we don't actually have to care about rules at all.
---
There are more than enough platforms. A hearthstone tournament surely wasn’t it. Blitzchung was unprofessional and got punished. Like anyone else would in a similar situation. 
---
This is just another situation for people to outrage and reap in karma. Maybe people should start to actual change their life? But no better boycott Blizzard while still supporting the Chinese government every fucking day.
---
To me it's pretty obvious they will also add TBC and WOTLK content.
---
Tried it out and I like it better than the other one I was using, much simpler and easier to use.
---
Your code is easy enough to understand I may try modifying it myself to make it more of a blacklist/whitelist combo.  So the algorithm would be something like:
---
If message contains whitelisted word, display it;
---
else if message contain blacklisted word, hide it;
---
else show it
---
Does it bother you that not only do I not care that anybody is gay I also don’t think it makes you special it just makes you a human being?  I don’t have to have a parade to be straight and neither should they.  It’s not a magic trick it’s just living your life.
---
Yeah rules are for societies.

Which is better for Warriors? Heroic Strike or Slam?

I know Heroic Strike is good for protection but how about if going as battle or berserker stance which should we use?

Dire maul should be named DME, DMN and DMW, since its 3 different places

it's a team game why is everyone supporting someone who let his team mate die that's fucked yo
---
I remember when I accidentally installed half of retail before I realized there is a pull down menu I was so fucking pissed. Pissed that it was being installed on my machine, I didnt mind so much the waste of time.
---
I can comprehend it. I actually wrote it in a response to another guy.
---
The discussion is how to use the group loot system and greed is greed and need is for use. 
---
Like I told another person, simply decide upon to loot rules when starting a group or use the system as is intended to avoid confussion. 
---
Is that so hard to comprehend?
---
It blows my mind when mages suck at drinking their own water.  I'll watch some guy just stand there between pulls, run out of mana, and then just stare at the mobs until somebody else kills them.  =o
---
Learn to sip, my dudes!
---
If you are writing off blizzard, why are you still subbed here?  Genuinely curious.
---
Horde warr? Rune of the guard captain and Mark of the chosen. You can get both in early 50s or sooner.
---
Honestly I'm for transmog, updated character models, and barbershop. But I can't really get on board with a guild bank similar to the one on live. 
---
Trading crap between toons through the mail and waiting an hour for it to go through is too iconic for me. Maybe a guild bank where it takes an hour to store something and an hour to withdraw it. Even then though it's still like giving more inventory slots to people.
---
Always preferred skittles troll to everyone wearing the exact same set

Fortunately you can disable that ugly hat from showing

All the people I know who constantly shit on random tanks in guild chat are pure dps classes like hunter, mage, and lock. One of them rolled a warrior and wanted to do an alt WC run. I said “so you’re tanking right?” Knowing he shit talks rando tanks 24/7 in guide. He says “nah dos only lol”.... typical
---
Yup
---
Beautiful
---
You're a hero! Thanks a lot! I got way too many add ons and this simple command worked! :)

I love the casual skill ups in the middle of the dialogue

Fuck ya brotha bring the people.the truth. FHK
---
He's playing a game the company made, he's not representing. Also, it's a fucking hearthstone stream, it's not the Superbowl.  At this point it really is, are you fine being controlled by China's money, or do you want Blizzard to know that we won't stand for that?
---
One minute your defending the whole galaxy, suddenly you find yourself sucking down Darjeeling with.....Marie antionette and her little sister.

Why can't I fly from Astanaar to Ratchet as an alliance? Which flight path in between am I missing?

I'd rather see a real world channel so people don't start using Lookingforgroup as trade and guild recruitment.

Ur killin the game wit dat yung chainheal tho bruh

its bis for fury wars until phase 6

And spend 5 mins getting screenshot cropped and sending it to phone.
---
So does blizzard! Delete your account!

I have been thinking I should look up the interact with mouse over setting for this exact reason. Thanks!
---
When I tank, I use a nameplate addon that shows clearly which of the mobs are aggroed by me and which of them don't. No need to run around me like a chicken. All I am asking for is to please watch your aggro, focus damage and when you pull, make sure I don't need to run to you
---
Ah true, most of the heirlooms are old raid tier. I see what you meant now.
---
How can you say that when China bans any kind of criticism? How can these people make their voice heard when so many of us are literally unwilling to listen if it interferes with something as trivial as entertainment?
---
There are simply not enough platforms until the oppression stops.
---
You crazy
---
Are rogues rare in classic?
---
Are you Mankrik's wife?
---
This isnt wow related at all!!
---
we do live in a simulation.
---
I umm have no idea what is going on here
---
I love this. This is classic and all its amazing content and shortcomings encapsulated in a single frame
---
Yeah i'm hoping for battlegrounds as well. Feels so empty without them.
---
so where are the camps where we are harvesting prisoners organs?
---
Looks like wow classix
---
Didnt think about it but i guess you need an addon if you want it keybound without having to lock that keybind for everything else. But idk, maybe you can incorporate they keybind in the macro? Why would downrankings make a difference tho? They work just like max ranks. I use clique. Its as simple as going to your spell book, click on the clique icon and then just press whatever key you want on whatever spell/rank you want and its boud. And it doesnt matter if its a mouse button or keyboard key
---
Worst levellers along w/ warriors and hardest class to find groups/raids for but 100-0 someone in stunlock w/ thistle tea once every 5 mins assuming no stun or key ability misses (and its only gonna be harder to do w/ pvp trinkets coming out; they add to skill expression for sure and i want them in the game but i m just saying gibbing people will be less common when they re out) and people lose their shit like its 2006.
---
but you see, they can make money/good PR out of those political argument.
---
The "Spy" Addon is probably the most controversial one there. 
---
However, as a non rogue player I love it. Hell, as a PvPer I love it (especially when others don't have it).
---

---
why though, its not really special if anybody at any time can go do this on any server and take a ss.
---
omg
---
I still don’t care.  Is being straight a cultural preference?  Nope not really it just is the way you are.  Be gay.. be straight... or how about try be interesting in a way that isn’t based on things you can’t change.
---
But I'm not an engineer so I don't have access to those things. And before you say I have to take engineering or I'm not allowed to use my professions in duels, that seems kinda nuts.
---
Last time I checked HK stuff shows up on Reddit daily. So this isn't a platform? It's not like Blitzchung is a Chinese sitting in a concentration camp atm. He could have used Twitter for his message. Or Youtube. But he chose to use his workplace, which is always wrong.
---
Theramore?
---
There are the defensive perks to your suggested hybrid build with imp. shield block and last stand. Or drop shield spec for the extra defense.
---
But with patch 1.12 the dungeons are so easy that my 20/31/0 raid build works great even in dungeons. And I only ever use my shield if I drop low on a big pull or if the enemies hit extremely hard, otherwise I use my 2h to ensure I have all the aggro and we nuke things down even in pugs. I rarely die because a shield wasn't equipped.
---
Ran a 19 sword and board warrior.  It works well with crusader.
---
I've seen that from time to time.   Maybe 1 out of every 10 pulls.
---
No
---
No depending on your work it is also stated in your contract to not discuss political opinions. Like in the one Blitzchung signed.
---
China &gt; Hong Kong

Ok

A simple read on the comment section tells me otherwise. They are getting discriminated and ridiculed within our community. Something that it shouldn’t  bother anyone and should be irrelevant for everyone, but here we are.
---
You look exactly what i want to look like
---
Maybe. The use there is somewhat different, though, being a young hairless pretty boyish type; it seems more like 'twinkles' is the original word, with all the flash shiny gear enchanted.
---
Was able to kill a 33 hunter on my 19 priest.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers still has active leveling areas. More people taking their time.
---
you will never make 60g/hr doing princess runs I don't know how people come up with these insane gold/hr numbers
---
Doing things together and starting things together are separate things you nubcake.
---
Quest run:
---
Decend stairs on the far right, clear trash (so you don't have to fight it together with the boss that spawns there), back up again.
---
Go up stairs second from the right. At the first fork tkae the stairs down, clear circle.
---
Jump down to lowest level which you cleared in the first step and do the boss that just spawned.
---
Go back up, take stairs second from the right again but this time go all the way up. Clear circle, jump down into dragon room and finish the dungeon.
---
I read this in a thick russian accent
---
It’s called the internet.  If you don’t like it and you’re going to cry about assholes then I suggest you stay away
---
You cancel her spell cast with viper sting. No need to range it.
---
Nice love it. That's a high level play. I was going more for a simple template. Now your tip, I will try out in the next dungeon.
---
Hold onto it. Gold farming dire maul will inflate prices massively. With how rare it is it is definitely only going to go up
---
I am, but if it's being widely used as a public channel and people on your server suddenly hijack it, mod all their friends and start kicking people for arbitrary reasons...
---
Then it's actually kind of shitty to even use it.
---
If nobody's doing that on your server that's wonderful but this is so toxic on the servers where it is happening.
---
I'm gonna have to word this in a way that wont be misinterpreted, but i think it probably will be, so lets try anyway.
---
Duels have unwritten rules, and generally you approach it as "Either everything outside the class is banned, or nothing is banned" - this approach was also somewhat adopted to Arena pvp as there was many rules in place to ensure things would not get completely insane, such as clearing buffs when you entered so you didn't bring in, for example, a world buff, a flask effect or a soulstone effect from a warlock.
---
a duel is not perfectly replicated pvp, even down to already knowing who your opponent is and their gear before the fight even starts.
---
The spirit of a duel is generally a friendly match, ofc its intense, but you gotta draw a line somewhere about which tools are not allowed to be used.
---
You can't do what you're wanting with a single press macro
---
Nope
---
I do not have the power to reach millions, I do not have a platform, nor access to means of production. That's why I don't have the responsibility. People in power do. Blizzard does.
---
Expecting the masses of consumers to change their behaviour to punish the acts of a world power is naive at best. Influencing the public discourse, get governments around the world to notice we care about this issue is much more achievable. Silencing the protestors is going exactly opposite towards this goal.
---
Why should professional environments not be a place for politics? You keep throwing that around like an axiom, but I see no reason. Everything is politics, neutrality is an illusion. Neutrality is just siding with the status quo.
---
Also, nazis were oppressors, that's why nazism should be banned.
---
OMG I love &lt;Fighting Fairies&gt;
---
You can’t connect to Reddit in China (without a VPN). Their internet is extremely censored compared to what we have in the US and Europe.
---
Transmog would ruin the game... 
---
Classic is way better in that you visually see how your character progresses. If someone looks badass chances are their gear is badass too. 
---
Looks = good gear
---
Lol, whatever you say dude.
---
How much do you think my staff of Jordan will be when pvp comes out?
---
2h fury still wants a slow weapon so you’re getting the most value out of slam.
---
fuckin metagamers, man
---
and blizz should do something about it, start suggesting what server to roll what on, offer free transfers to balance the servers.
---
This is honestly one of the most well put together posts on the topic I’ve seen. Excellently said.
---
Yeah lets give one of the arest mounts to the ones that invested less time in to the game out of principle
---
Do the Scourgestones ever again have any use once you hit exalted and have turned in the mantle quests?
---
Even on servers that are "high pop" feel like ghost towns
---
Nah, only an idiot thinks in absolutes. The world is system of graduated variables, and once an item is worth a certain amount of gold it becomes need for everyone. If that's hard to understand, well, then you're probably just a little slow.
---
You could at least be creative with the blatant trolling
---
I totally believe you
---
debunked? Better check your sources.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China
---
But they can watch Twitch streams?
---
Things hunters can do to improve mana usage: turn off growl, don't bestial wrath at the very start of the fight, don't multishot at the start of the fight since you'll then have to spend mana on FD, don't volley since it's crap damage most of the time anyway, don't start your aimed shot channel before the tank engages
---
That advice would apply to you as well, wouldn’t it?
---
They celebrated pride month on one of their overwatch league casts, so that answers that one.
---
That choke point is so narrow
---
You spelt fabulous wrong.
---
full on rogues
---
will it double-penalize like that? how does that work
---
I'll be sure to roll greed on all BoP gear over 3g vendor value because I need more consumable money for raid. Thanks for the insight. I'm sure no groups will get upset. If they do I'll just show them your Reddit comment
---
Yeah orcs are funny looking, trolls on the other hand. Aye, that's my jam.

It's both main hand and offhand.

---
Great post, ty!
---
I don't. But when you see people getting kicked for no reason on your server, and it's only a matter of time, you shouldn't stick around.
---
If only because their bans are far more spammy than World chat generally is normally.
---
Wrong. If I would have rolled on all the 3g+ BoP items I didn't need I would have a fuck ton more gold at everyone else's expense. Or I could have disenchanted them and played the market. 
---
I need that gold so I guess I'll be needing on BoP that have more than 3g+ value because that's how the game works yeah?
---
Not rare, but honestly not as numerous as I expected. I feel like outside of tanking classes most are pretty well represented personally.
---
When I see someone say virtue signaling on Reddit now I just read it as "You're just being happy and well adjusted for the internet point;  I know everyone is secretly miserable like me!"
---
Really I just feel bad for them. I can't imagine being so lonely that you assume all strangers are pathologically incapable of being kind.
---
Kromcrush is pretty balanced
---
Share price is a bit more mathematically grounded.
---
Blizzard is publicly traded, so its senior officers owe a duty to shareholders to administrate the company in an optimally profitable way. That directly means catering to China. In no uncertain terms.
---
In the west we need to start doing some combination of the below
---
a)Electing goverments that are *very* harsh and aggressive toward China, up to and including military action against them and their holdings in Africa and elsewhere.
---
b)making a shit ton more babies to shift economic power westward again
---
c)accept that China is starting to have the market power to dominate the landscape of international business, and therefore international speech on such platforms.
---
d) Do everything we can to slingshot India ahead of China and make sure they develop in the 'correct' way.
---
Healer last? As a rogue, this is why we don't follow markings sometimes. If the skull is not on the healer I will step up and save us all a lot of trouble. If an unmarked caster stands a bit away casting, why yes, I will take care of that.

I approve this message

You underrate Activision's severe hatred for Video Games and Gamers. ActivisionBlizzard was formed right around the end of WOTLK. Look at the timeline.

So they immediately apologized to China and promised to ban the player and fire the interviewers within hours. It took them days to decide they should apologize to Americans, and even then, they stopped themselves halfway through.

---
People on this subreddit have lost their minds
---
Literally any ban or punishment whatsoever is too harsh. They should not be censoring their players from having political opinions that offend China.
---
&gt;If they don't specifically ban it, or have a bail out clause (Like, a clause saying any final decision regarding naming will be left up to Blizz discretion, etc) then they can't force him to change it without some major backlash. 
---
Yeah...they can
---
No it isnt.
---
That's not a gank. You were outnumbered.

It's probably enchanting, it could be a drop.

Whaaaat. Rez rank 1 is the way to go. No need to spend money on upgrades and you still get rezzed.

I downloaded Puggle the other night and I've been liking it. It watches chat for certain words(i.e. LFG, UBRS, etc.) then puts the messages into an easy to read window.
---
You still have to message the players about groups like you would without it, so I think it doesn't stray too from the "classic experience", but it saves you from going cross-eyed watching chat for the dungeons you want haha.
---
If a few thousand people joining me on an unlayered server magically unbalances every other server, they were doomed anyway.  What's going to happen is, either a server opens up for people like me who want to level with a big group of people and not just a few twinks I might run into doing quests, or, people in my boat or like me will just stop playing.  No one will be sitting and leveling on a server indefinitely.  
---
If you think there are going to be loads of people leveling in 6 months, you are dead wrong.  There isn't a new group of people coming every month like there was when this started.  The influx of people will be a trickle compared to a steady stream from original WoW, that's just the reality of it.
---
To quote TFS Mr. Popo as he was summoning dragon:
---
"I'm so fucking high right now"
---
reckoning is great for leveling and INSANELY powerful for pvp since you can store the charges you can run around legit 1 rounding people. Mobs that attack fast are great because you can force the crits much more often then say casters who take time to cast. Heres some helpful videos that my friend has used to understand how to get the most out of it. Reckoning resets your swing timer which is why he has the start attack stop attack macro. If you have auto attack turned on the reckoning will reset your swing timer and you'll hit once. By hitting this macro your attack will be off and you will do two attacks instead of one reset swing.

Bundle it with the discipline talent that makes the next spell free with 25% crit Chance and you have a emergency group top off.

Yeah dunno why you rolled orc. /s
---
the bonus is only for 1handers, right?
---
Ok then why did you make this thread telling people to boycott it
---
addons are ruining the classic experience.
---
I just rerolled to a more balanced server. It’s not going to change. Blizzard should have released a % data during the name reservation. But In the end people will naturally choose a server that has more of their faction, because they don’t want to be that 30% side. So from there it just build upon that, so essential it’s our own fault in a way. I know for me if there is even 10% more of the opposite faction I won’t choose that server. It either has to be pretty dead even or more of my faction. I think it’s the same way for others.
---
It is.
---
These types of people are clueless because they are born into privilege.  Probably straight and white so he's never had to face up against bullying or discrimination due to the color of his skin or his sexuality.  Just want to say its refreshing to see someone defend LGBT gamers on a WoW forum for the right reasons.
---
Flurry. Like a flurry of weapon swings.
---
I just had my friend do this for me and I got it on the first drop!
---
It was designed that way to turn huntards off from it.
---
&gt;I put on my robe and wizard hat
---
  Oh, I like to play dress up.
---
Agreed, better than a bike for nothing at level one.
---
Are you perhaps retarded?
---
It might actually bring more people to subscribe, or keep playing.  A few low population servers aren't going to be "saved" by anything other than a merger.
---
The goblins hate you though
---
Horde in classic is OP, you will mostly always have Horde dominate.
---
Alliance will congregate in a few areas, thus making a Alliance dominate server.
---
But less servers than Horde.
---
Is anyone surprised? How many of you could go in tomorrow to work and start babbling your personal politics costing your employer money?  I swear the absolute man children that play this game. Your employer isn’t your megaphone and don’t be shocked when you get shellacked for supporting the cause of the day
---
I can only take you to the water, I can't make you drink.
---
Bender?
---
Yeah but like... at least rogues are worth having in a group.
---
That's why you had to be there, for that experience.
---
Stamina for raiding where the pet is unlikely to get hit by melee attacks but be subject to standard AoE magic damage.
---
In the open world the majority of damage the pets takes will be physical melee damage and the armor is more valuable.
---
So why is it ok to celebrate LGBT rights but its not ok to talk about Hong Kong?
---
yes you can, stam is the right stat for warlock pvp, spell power don't affect dots much, and so is int since mana  can be life tapped while dots don't crit. you think you did lower damage but u didn't
---
Politics are all over blizzard events. If you see anything that's supportive of feminism or LGBT (it's everywhere) that's politics. 
---
It's not politics to you, and the majority of society, because we agree with it, but it is politics.
---
Oh god, do you have any idea how many PMs you get forming a group for UBRS?
---
I kid you not, when I tried to form a group I got 10pms in the first minute. 7 were rogues.
---
Does attack power affect special attacks like Ambush or only white damage?
---
It really is. Maybe it shouldn't be banned, but I've never seen a lamer guild name.
---
Yeah making a guild for for being straight would be stupid as fuck because being straight isn't a cultural identity and doesn't have a need for a supportive and protective community.  People who say shit like the guy I responded to are incapable of understanding the context behind why LGBT people might feel comfortable forming communities.
---
Lolololololololol yes I am okay with this
---
glad you agree
---
/cry
---
I'm on the side of outrage here but genuine question, how could they? The moment someone uses your platform to make a political statement you have two options; 
---
ignore it and the general public assume you hold that stance (i.e you've made a political statement)
---
punish it and the general public assume you oppose that stance (i.e you've made a political statement).
---
There's no escaping it being political once someone makes it political, as far as i can see at least.
---
Okay. I still don't get why you would do it then? To sell the accounts later maybe?
---
They are ninjas. Call them out and never run with them.
---
okay im gonna bite the bullet on this one. how are they like vegans?
---
Because we got some nice BIS there. Let us runnnnnn
---
Being "gay" isn't just a sexuality.  There's a whole culture behind being LGBT in America and in other countries.  There's nothing wrong with people who have their own unique cultural identity and have been historically oppressed wanting to form a community in an online game together.
---
I love me some more pally buffs. Except when they are too lazy to rebuff for most of the run, then it makes me wonder why they exist
---
Yes, I'm sure they are just harvesting organs willy-nilly and this hasn't been sensationalized at all. /S
---
We literally infected our own citizens with syphilis. Flynt doesn't have clean water. We aren't better than them because we can point to one thing we don't have first hand knowledge over.
---
I’m outdpsing rogues in MC as sword pve spec with 6 sc set than rogues with pre raid bis +hit gear. Got +35 energy procs 12 times on Magmadar fight. No + hit set can beat so much extra energy gain.
---
Bitch I look fabulous
---
#nochanges
---
The downvote belt is to die for.
---
Not so much surprised, just bringing attention to it to other users, and hoping to find one more accurate.
---
As a horde who's been handled constantly, I can confirm this appears to be the alliance attitude
---
This should be considered as cheating. I hope blizzard will ban this.
---
I'm interested to see now if a prominent player tries to do exactly that to try to expose their hypocrisy.
---
They have their "parades" and even amonth. No need to get this stuff into wow.
---
I've seen some unusual Red Hat ladies but you take the cake.
---
[http://www.redhatsociety.com/](redhatsociety.com)
---
Yeah, also interested, looks sweet!
---
Sarahs guide was good pre +dmg you tard
---
How does it affect you?
---
Nice! I'll have to swing by
---
I saw a whoopass the other day. How does dildo and ass pass but jew In jeweler is blocked?!
---
So, white hits (from autoattacks) will give you extra rage, and yellow hits (from abilities) consumes rage. Heroic strike will replace a white hit with a yellow hit because it happens “on next swing”. So it’ll cost not just the 15 rage, but also the rage lost from the white hit it replaced. In situations where you’re not getting rage from taking damage (dps warrior), you’d probably only use heroic strike when you’re in danger of hitting 100 rage.
---
Slam takes time to cast, but can be cast in between auto attack swings if you time it precisely - a weapon swing timer add on might help with this. If you’re getting attacked and the cast gets pushback it might not be worth it. If you’re casting during the time you would have autoattacked, you’ll delay the auto attack swing, decreasing dps. But in raids, using a 2h spec, slam is useful and good for dps.
---
Grandma shaman
---
Agreed. I don't tip those in my group outside rare occurrences and often they aren't expecting a tip. 
---
Such as a shaman who gave me some food that gave me an MP5 buff to help me out. He said a tip wasn't needed but did it anyways. (Ele shaman chews through mana like crazy but the damage has been great. Should be better once I get some more SP items so I can properly down rank to conserve mana.)
---
Then if I am just hitting up a random out of no where asking a favor at the cost of their time I'll tip.
---
Alright its not magic, its reality. Im not gonna spit arbitrary #s here and do math problems because it should be common sense.
---
Also no its not gonna be a 1 to 1 experience, you shouldnt ever of expected the game to be that way. 
---
However with me saying that you are also saying the game will not get new players which is kinda wierd. This game will always have alts, returning players, new players, its a mmo that is  BIG idk why you think player pop is stagnant.
---
I always keep a stack of the highest level pots I can use on me. Usually they're cheap enough (since people are levelling alch, or selling the low level pots they get from chests), and saving myself a GY run saves me a lot of time.
---
Yeah because most straight people didnt shape culture in europe or elsewhere right.
---
I use a weakauras to show the proc in the niddle of the screen retail style
---
Yes, at a later phase when writs come out, you can turn in one token for a writ.
---
Can’t you just type /invite and click on their name in chat?
---
My source is literally the story we are talking about right now in which they express to us exactly what they will limit within their tournaments. Speaking of projecting... lower your pitchfork
---
What class are you playing?
---
I prefer Dildogaggins
---
Check out horde locations first too! You probably can't buy chicken food from a guy like I did ):
---
How about they keep it to their own and dont shove it into peoples faces?
---
No offense, but you are definetily doing something wrong if you find regular classic difficulty dungeon runs "mentally stressful" and requiring alot of concentration.
---
Get to a 40-50 zone(s) and kill all the green/yellow mobs you see.
---
Pick up yellow and green quests while your there. Some zones have 15+ quests in the area and some only have maybe 3 or 4. Doesn’t make one zone better then the other as long as your grinding. 
---
I m almost 40 with only a few good friends/ guildies known, so me taking 20min? 30min?To stop my questing in desolace, run to fp,then boat, then fp again,then run for 10 min to dungeon and hope to not get tanked by horde in front of UC and SM?
---
It’s a terrible gamble and only worth it if you got a pro group that’s going to spam a dungeon for hours...   I honestly only take summons to SM. No more wasting 15-25 min of my precious time in a prime exp grind spot to go and have a moderate SM group. 
---
This is the best advise I can give anyone trying to get past a level zone, cause me as a priest healer I have to rely on mages/ warlock to have a good exp dungeon farm as dose a lot of other classes.
---
Because they always have to talk about/ bring up their sexuality whenever they can.
---
I'm pretty sure Wands are treated as *ranged weapons* so Agility does have a minor impact in increasing your Wand damage and Crit chance, as well as increasing your character's Dodge chance.
---
This is of inconsequential benefit in comparison to gaining more +Spell Power or +Spell damage (the only way to make your spells actually do more damage) or Stamina / Intellect which allow you to case more spells before running out of resources.
---
Intellect also increases spell crit so it would take priority over Stam but Warlock DoTs can't crit so it's not so impactful.  You should view them both as primarily throughput stats where Stam makes you a little tankier and int gives your Shadow Bolt some crit
---
I supposr you have to wait for pvp trinkets coming with phase 2, like insigna of the horde if you are horde
---
Fair enough.
---
If this isn’t classic, I don’t know what is.
---
Please stop playing this game, delete your accounts, blizzard are scum
---
Currently leveling as a Druid in my downtime from leveling my mage main, just a few questions.
---
1. I am currently leveling Feral spec and really enjoying it, but I am unsure what stats I should be prioritizing in gear. It seems like Agility would be first and that Strength would be second with the third being Stamina. Am I correct in this assumption?
---
2. What abilities should I prioritizing in keeping the max rank of? It seems like I have a lot to keep up with between all the forms, balance and restoration.
---
3. After playing mage it seems like Druids don't really have as many "oh shit" buttons. What should my plan of action be when I find myself on the wrong end of a wayward mob aggro'ing when I don't expect it?
---
I appreciate any insight you can give me :) I am always trying to improve my game!

I saw 2 at scholo today, asked in guild if anyone needed then posted location in general chat.
---
Implying those are hard to get when there are 3 mobs that drop it in lower spire. Where as the other epic robes for warlocks and priest are on the final bosses of strat and Scholl.
---
Very relatable
---
It seems like you don't understand what happens by those rules "politics don't belong here". They don't filter out the important stuff like this. They only filter out the other bs.
---
By having a cost (player punishment) attached to it only the really important political issues will be addressed.
---
Just think that someone which holds the opposite of your political view is allowed to constantly say whatever political shit he wants during your favorite entertainment event. And he is doing it constantly because "politics should be everywhere". To be frank it would be an absolute shit show.
---
Yes probably we think to less about politics, and maybe that will become a problem some time, but bringing politics to everything just makes life a really long shit show.
---
I'd look ridiculous too if I were still playing on Blunderd servers
---
This isn't about me, but since you insist on the matter:
---
 Sure, I hold some amount of responsibility, commensurate to the power I hold over the issue, which is very little. I do what I can: I speak about the issue, criticize and talk back against any and all forms of oppression if I witness them... I would speak of this at my workplace, or to an audience, if matters came to that. But I have very little power, and a lot of other matters to attend to, and no, I do not do everything at my disposal, I do not go out to protest for Hong Kong, I do not ban every Chinese product from my consumption. There are many things I advocate and many things I oppose, and I just can't manage to do everything for all of them... So yeah, I could do better, but I'm just one guy.
---
But this isn't about me. It's about oppression and people with power. They can change things: the Chinese government can stop it, the US government can put pressure on China, my own government could probably help too. Blizzard could let the damn kid speak his mind.
---
I can't influence shit, but I can try to convince you, or anyone else, that there are those who can and should, and maybe we all together can get them to do something. That's the only way we win.
---
But the question was about the difference between UK and US usage, and 'grated' in the UK includes cheese in small strips, which wound be ' shredded ' in the US.
---
These don't break fear in vanilla, if I recall correctly.
---
My server currently has 7 edgemasters all at around 280-350g, I wanted to invest in one but it seemed a bit risky
---
Damn 35!!
---
Gz on the mageblade tho!
---
I wondered how long it would be before the the private server mentality of "If it isn't fresh, i'm not playing it" kicked in lol.
---
Rogue.
---
It's all white attacks. Yellow attacks are capped at 5% hit vs same level, up to 9% vs bosses (+3 levels) if you are 300 weapon skill. The amount of hit you need is a formula that factors your weapon skill vs the defense skill of the npc you are fighting. All yellow attacks ignore the dual wield penalty.
---
If you are a leveler you can still apply everything being discussed here, but realize that people base miss rates of +3 levels (max level vs boss). If you fight a mob that is +4 levels or +5 levels it will get even worse for you.
---
This has happened so many times before, yo.
---
Its party only
---
I'm pro Hong Kong and as mad as everyone else, but be careful buying into every argument that fits your position. The posting thing was ridiculous from a mile away and this Chinese speaking English major has little to no credibility. An explanation could be as simple as an entire PR team came together to write that letter. Slow down before making strong accusations, or justice will become a witch hunt.

Bro I already believe that you're a 100% dyed in the wool certified gamer, you don't need to keep proving your bigotry (or fragile sexuality) to me.
---
I play Mograine EU and work nights, keep that routine on my days off. At a guess i'd say 5% of people play that play peak when i play, the difference between me playing at peak and playing at my peak (like 4am ST) is astronomical.
---
I can run through the whole of IF and see like 5 people vs there' being 200 people stood outside the bank, 50 people in AH, 30 people in the inn, etc and LFG / world is silent for 15-30 mins at a time.
---
I don’t think it’s as bad as vegans. Some people just bae their whole identity around one aspect of their personality because they aren’t interesting people. Same can be said for MANY types of people, playing into stereotypes just reinforces the stereotype so others think it’s the norm
---
That's pretty fucked up.
---
Whats your spell power at?
---
playing super fast and efficient farm runs like that does take your attention and it's frankly fucking boring man. i need a change of scenery like the guy above too.
---
this way friend /r/leftypol/
---
Its an auto need for everyone for sure
---
Because it's not sincere. You'll find in every company suffering PR shit there are many inside it that are sincere and sorry, disagree or anything in between, but the company as a whole has one goal completely unrelated to morality or emotion, profit. The statements they give are designed in such a way that they try to cover their asses, quell any anger on as many sides that are a threat to their profit and stability and, not that it always works, try to stop further outrage. 
---
I think it's far easier for an individual apology (though it's just as easy to tell when the individual apology is as hollow as a companies, ala youtube drama) than it is for a company apology, because you can't really give your own genuine remorse as your companies statement.

---
It's extremely dependent on server health so can't really say. It cost 100g the first 1-2 weeks. I'd expect 300-500g early in the VG days, hopefully more
---
Exactly why I don’t play
---
Absolutely. Anytime anyone says something like "I'm not doing this because of X" - you immediately think it's because of X.  
---
My first thought was that someone in China insisted they put that in the statement, because it's just glaringly stupid from a western point of view.

No worries, shame you cannot play on both sides on an RP server. But if it was allowed you know people would abuse it and cause problems. Too bad \*sigh\*.

Kicking the dude for not breaking a group he's in what a dick.
---
I remember calculating it to be ~12% chance to not see a single HoJ drop in 50 runs.
---
Nah.  I've actually spent very little gold outside of a botched talent respec early on.  I played vanilla. I know all of the basics anyone else here does. 
---
I actually misread the thread title and my post doesn't really make sense in context of 60.  But I haven't had much random luck yet. No valuable BoEs or anything to pad the bank. Iti'll happen eventually I'm sure.
---
It's allegedly a 4% drop
---
It's just how it works =(.
---
There is an addon that makes it so any ability you press will dismount you, but you still have to push they key twice when mounted.
---
Yeah there were a few parts in there that seemed off to me and not something you typically see in an official statement. One of them that immediately jumped out was 'There is a consequence...' Someone who is a native English speaker wouldn't word something that way and it would be something most peer reviewers would mark to have it changed.
---
No it is not.
---
New guys? Needing on high value BoE's was totally normal in Vanilla in my experience.
---
It really is.
---
OH I'M A SHAM! I can't even fly out of the *window*

Ele shaman can't use swords, so witchblade is definitely their best option. But I was under the impression focal is pretty easy to get and very good.
---
Cam newton

So you become the ninja looter yourself. People like you are scum.
---
Is fueuerschlag like a german only attack to compensate for losing ww2?
---
This brings me much joy
---
Focal Sword is very good, don’t get me wrong and what I am currently using. However, witchblade is still better. Focal sword is just 1% crit and No other stats
---
Go look at the old thottbot comments for these on wow head and you'll understand this post.

People legitimately had no idea how weapon skill worked in Vanilla.

You look FAB-OO-LUS!

Go level an alliance toon on stalagg, you will lose any sense you have of horde players being more fair minded than alliance. I guarantee you this.

I am quite good with the filter builder, what do you need help with and what's your discord, cba typing all the info on a phone^^

I think it's hard to know what's going on behind the scenes, but I'd suggest that the atmosphere of the place under Activision is probably very different to when the devs did their best work. That kind of thing has a massive effect.
---
Healers are essential.
---
Again, expecting huge masses of consumers to completely change their behaviour to affect a world power is naive. 
---
I don't believe I'm a hypocrite for not doing everything in my power on this matter, as I said, there are plenty of other matters for me, Hong Kong is not my fight. I can, however, help spread the word about it, I can even donate, which is my MO for the kind of issues where I can't take direct action.
---
You know what, have an upvote. I never expected you to actually post it lmao.
---
People really treating classic like a job, playing more hours per week, I'm level 50 and starting to realise playing this game is unhealthy going to take a break.
---
You mean the item that probably has a (10% drop rate)[https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9017/lord-incendius] and then another 4% chance of rolling shadowrath? For a whopping drop rate of 0.4%?
---
It might as well not exist tbh. Just go buy a shadowwrath green off the AH that will be 90% as good.
---
Yeah that's not Twitch that's you
---
It has a parrot summon too
---
This

Gotta agree, it is on hunter pre-bis lists as well.

I really enjoyed this thanks for posting
---
i guess as a rogue the normal stealth run tactic is still faster but for lava runs i will remember that
---
Who Me?
---
Aye, which is roughly equivalent to witchblade's 14sp give or take. So you gain 7 int.
---
I guess it's something to do if you're done with all the other big upgrades. Plus you get a chance at burial shawl.
---
If you are already that deep in affliction you want to take Shadow Mastery, it kinda is the payoff talent for going deep affliction. 10% damage is massive. 
---
If you don't mind me asking, what pet are you using?

You will lack quite a bit of items, because it's only 5 pieces and some rep rewards. You will lack a phat warrior weapon, mages might get ToEP, rings, trinkets in general, neck, cloak. They all come from PvE. You will be okayish, but to get the real juicy non set pieces, you want to faceroll MC once a week for two hours.

It didn’t change my mind because I already knew why blizzard did what they did and they explained it more fully for everyone. But you guys aren’t happy. Video games ain’t the time to bring politics into it.
---
What? I'm pretty sure that's used to grief your own faction
---
EVEN BETTER!
---
Blizzard already brought politics into the gaming world by firmly standing WITH china on a political issue. The cats out of the bag so of course people want to discuss it
---
Which points are wrong then?

but once u start stuff like this, there's no end to it. id rather we just stay the same
---
Yeah, because winning a 2v1 in wpvp feels so good. I get more enjoyment out of killing a critter
---
Why do I get the feeling your shield and hat are actually the same thing
---
no xmog. no way
---
But you can take direct action. You just choose not to do it because it's inconvenient for you. This is what makes you the hypocrite.
---
It's like all those people wanting to help climate change, but don't wan't to stop eating meat, get useless children or travel around per plane. You all are hypocrites. Stop pretending as if you care. If you do you change your life, even the parts which are inconvenient. You choose to take the route which the least impact just to pretend you help change something. Spoiler alert: You don't.

this means nothing

oh god its every 5 mins like seriously lol they fall off during a fight in a trash pack. I have no idea how to keep those blessings up while performing dps properly on each pull. Even with buff watch half the time I look up and I'm like oh I need to rebuff... I wonder when they all fell off?
---
Ah yeah, so true. If my grp does fine Im on 80% mana after each pack. If they play the ping pong i drink for 30s.
---
I want it too
---
I abandoned the aquatic form quest for druids as I needed the quest log space during levelling. 
---
Now I'm trying to finish it however I can't find where to start the quest again as Horde. I went to Thunder Bluff and spoke to all the druid trainers and none of them gave me the quest. I spoke to Dendrite in Moonglade and he doesn't have it for me either. 
---
I did complete the quest up to the last chain so I tried finding the bauble in the lake to summon Tajarri and speak to her again but I can't find any baubles. 
---
Any suggestions?
---
Then there are people with insainely bad luck, like me. Back in vanilla I ran Mara over 60+ times to get an item to drop from princess. I was a 60 and would take whoever wanted to go with me. 
---
The item unwanted dropped a total of 3-4 times and I lost the roll on it every time.
---
I wish I would have just put the item on reserve.
---
As a rogue I wish tanks understood this
---
The crit arrow luckily doesn't kill him though, Xboromirx pops Last Stand and kills a few more. Unfortunately he is dazed as the orc leader takes another Aimed Shot.
---
A few things  you can do:   
---
Borrow gold from someone   
---
Start farming mobs, that and sell the materials you get. Humonoids can often drop wepons which usualy got a good vendor price even if they are grey.
---
You don't have to get your mount at 40, just keep leveling and you'll get the gold eventually.
---
Too little, too late. The damage was already done.
---
What name?
---
It helps to not fall asleep though...
---
Did Russel Westbrook started playing classic?
---
madgrimm
---
Healbot Continued has a very useful buff minder.
---
This potion just makes druid tanks cry.
---
And that's why all the rogues become group leaders lol
---
The amount of mages i've seen wearing melee hit/crit gear is worrying
---
I mean honestly I play a ro server and everyone just has whatever for names. It's hard enough to find one not taken. First name mad last name grims. Works out.
---
It's the safe move anyway.
---
Why the Wildthorn mail have to be a crop top...
---
Tanking is significantly more frantic than any other role. Even when I was a tank in vanilla I'd go as dps sonetimes.
---
Dude that's the joke...
---
Haha I'm so woke I deleted my video-game account.
---
Time to put on my slave made shoes, clothes, watch and grab my slave made phone and wallet. I love making a difference.
---
You mean transmogs? No thanks.
---
yea that was what I was thinking. My name's maddy so it works out :)
---
There are people in retail that haven't gotten this mount yet.
---
Was gonna say, I had the aurastone for both looks and neither was like that.
---
How not to write an apology. Fuck Blizzard. Fuck Brack.
---
MM is reliant, pretty heavily, on properly speeded weapons to function. It also likes single targets pretty much exclusively and doesn't have much flexibility to it, *and* it has high downtimes. 
---
BM has basically none of these problems.
---
I was in a strat live group for an hour where the party leader was a dps warrior who would not allow any tanks (Druid or plate) to roll on mask of the unforgiven if it dropped. Needless to say group disbanded 30 min later. Hmm zero chance of getting vs 50:50 if it dropped? Jeez.
---
Straight out of a fetish porn. Hats off to you.
---
Yeah you'll be fine. Don't stress it. Worse comes to worse blizz will make you change the name. What server you going on?
---
Illegal, where?
---
&gt;15 years later
---
Do you know what game you're playing?
---
When the run gets chaotic and everyone is taking damage, no one gets healed to full. If they all have to eat, I have time to drink.
---
Illegal where tho?
---
State on that 😂
---
Or save your money and just use thrash blade
---
This isn't about me. 
---
And yeah, it's inconvenient to the point of not being able to do my job (wanna guess how many electronics have parts that come from China). Which I do need to do to pay the bills and fight my fights. I don't pretend to care, I just can't help as much in the position that I'm in. I can help indirectly, and I do.
---
But I'm just gonna stop defending myself, since I'm just fueling your ad hominem and this is not about me. 
---
The point is: people are being oppressed, Blizzard is siding with the oppressor, Blizzard should stop doing that. If you wanna argue that we can continue.
---
I fucking hate this bow so much. It's the big problem with 'status' weapons in general honestly. 
---
It just got back to us that the reason 5 different fucking hunters in our raid group are basically passing each week on every other ranged MC item that drops no matter what they have currently so they can get a chance at this bow if the item drops. 
---
I won't pretend that I know much about hunters, they've never interested me a ton but holychrist seeing epic items getting disenchanted only three weeks into doing MC is infuriating right now.
---
It's working for the guy behind you as well lol
---
Yeh you can't have a name with the word murderer in it either or jaywalker that is a big no no
---
&gt;But after a couple characters, not everyone is interested in the slog of classic leveling again
---
Then they don't get a new 60 character
---
Sad thing is a warlock in my guild has the shadowrath bracers, the archivist cloak of shadowrath and the offhand of shadowrath from ST... the lucky fucker..
---
I was going for a pacific realm time, only grobbulus availabe :/
---
That’s a poor outlook. You shouldn’t force companies to pick sides. If you’re truly unhappy with what’s going on in China, how about you go help people there or protest instead of sitting behind your computer screen getting upset at a company who wants to remain neutral and keep politics out of video games? Go fight the government of China and now Video game companies....
---
It's making you the ninja looter. Stop needing for gold. Greed is for gold, need is when you want to equip it. It's pretty easy.
---
I'm on grob as well. Most popular RP server so you can't go wrong.
---
I've come to notice most people only came back to classic to exploit bugs, grief, and they seem really sensitive when you call them out, including the mods.
---
Oh yeah, maybe you should actually read your own rules too, cause this idiot is being called out for misinformation, thought you may want to know if you were done nit picking those not kissing griefers butts.
---
Blizzard is siding with no one. It's enforcing it rules. You guys just love to outrage and make a story out of it.
---
Might as well finish the grind at this point, but i have been checking the AH on my server for like 2 weeks now, nothing i need is there so i grind what i can.
---
Transmogrification sucks, but I do wish we could dye gear to at least colour-match.
---
cool! are you alliance or horde? how does wpvp and faction balance look?
---
TEN, TEN, TEN, TEN, NIIIIINE!?!!😱😱😱😱
---
I was thinking of rolling an alt (or two or three) on Grob even though I'm East Coast. It's got a good reputation.
---
Had a Cath run the other night as a paladin healer. We had a mage , warlock and hunter with a druid tank. If you've done a lot of SM you know the wizards aoe does a ton of damage and they spam it constantly. Well we were doing pretty big pulls so the tank constantly had 2-3 wizards on him spamming aoes. Queue the mage running straight into them and dying immediately while I'm having to spam heals on the tank just to keep his hp over 50%. And he did this on every single pull for multiple runs. I stopped even trying to heal him and told him multiple times not to run into the aoes but he just never learned.
---
I regret not rolling on a pvp server to take part in these type of events. Not that they don’t happen on pve, it’s just more infrequent. 
---
On a side note, do these world pvp scenarios happen in retail anymore?
---
Yeah, and what's with all the indentation?
---
That's not true though, pet damage is actually quite a small proportion of hunters damage. Around 50% of their damage is from auto attacks
---
Needs more context. Kicks one person you show twice who isn’t shown in gchat. Requiring epic mounts for pvp makes sense if you’re traveling as a group, requiring engineering may be a bit much but those requirements are for raiders and pvpers so there must be other levels of members. This is fake outrage.
---
Grob is like 52% alliance and 48% horde. They don't really show who plays what but it's what I been seeing people predict. Very half and half And I'm horde. :P I see you are alliance. :(
---
You chose this fate.
---
Off you trot then
---
Imagine caring about data in a video game to this extent.
---
Honestly a huge player base is east coast as well with me. So you're good rolling there and being east coast :)
---
For those of use who don't plan to raid, what is the hit cap against level 60 dungeon bosses or is there some general formula I could use? I'm a hunter.
---
What? I'm a new hunter and I was leveling MM and I would still stolo 4 mobs at a time that were higher level than me. It was so easy.
---
Yeah unfortunately I do like that, but I prefer Druid play style in general. I guess you can’t have it all!
---
2 and 1/3 Humans
---
Enforcing its rules in this case is siding with the oppressor. I could even argue the rules themselves are designed in a way that Blizzard will always side with oppressors
---
Well you guys obviously care so much that you don't want to get ninja looted, by ninja looting yourself.
---
that sounds fun! yea, i'm alliance on my current realm but I've been thinking of rerolling horde
---
It truly feels epic arriving there.
---
Oh thats good to hear! If you happen to play horde, I'm glad to level an alt with a friend
---
Things justdrop can do to seem like less of a douche: *chill out*
---
This is also PVE griefing, where a few 60s lock down a town until people run them off, if they ever care.  Most of the time they intentionally put themselves in exploitative positions so a lowbie accidentally right clicks them to kill.  You can't escape these sort of people.
---
Of course you don't.. Nobody wants a rogue, the most nerfed class in the game.
---
Come to the dark side!!
---
So trash is simultaneously dying within 2.5 seconds (half a drain life channel) AND dots are doing enough damage to pull aggro from the tanks opening shout within those 5 seconds? That sure is interesting, how does that work? Do people laugh at warlocks because they can't finish casting a shadow bolt before the trash is dead? I am not sure what you're saying because it isn't even internally coherent. Claiming that opening with a 5 second channel will have the mob dead halfway through is patently absurd. And if a tank can't hold a corruption + agony on 2-3 targets you are not in a 'good group'.
---
Warlock works well of they are healed, but just like you can recognize bad warlocks in open world from them having to drink and eat all the time, you can recognize bad warlocks from ruining tempo by depending on constant heals to do even average in dungeons.
---
Hah, that's nuts.
---
That said, DM gives some solid dungeon alternatives for those slots instead of complete garbage at least.
---
Looking at those slots though, depending how you weight things there's some nice options from world drop greens that might be affordable. Check out the AH for them I guess.
---
Just like my friend lol! None of his gear matches at all. He even got a leather shield that looks like a kite with higher stats then a mail shield. Just why haha?! So I shared him a clip from Big Bang Theory where Leonard and the others say kitesho!
---
How is it ninja looting if everyone rolls need?
---
as a rogue i got mine a week ago
---
i herbed and skinned and didnt spend on much beside repairs and health potions
---
since then i prolly spent another 500-600g gained the same way
---
Things you can do to keep karma whoring: respond to me
---
If you don't enforce rules then they become meaningless. Which means you have to allow anyone to praise any political opinion they have. Rules are there to be enforced all the time. Not when it is convenient to the public opinion.
---
Dio- Holy Diver
---
Your point makes perfect sense but it's just so rare that I think everyone should roll on it regardless. The free mount aspect is just a cool secondary bonus.
---
Seems like pretty bad math. Wouldnt 0 drops in 50 runs be 0%?
---
Succubus
---
Some people pick F UD solely for the flip lel
---
Level isn't 42, doesn't count
---
Ju Ju
---
If you have any buffs/debuffs on you when you enter range to be loaded into another player's client, they will be "cast" on you at that moment, as far as that player's client is concerned. So when they fly into range on the flight path, it picks up all the hour-long buffs that player may have.
---
4. Rotate your camera 180 degrees and zoom out so that your bobber is in full view for all casts. Makes it so much bigger and easier to aim your mouse at.

&gt;Every negative comment is some take on "oh no my precious server might be impacted" it's laughable

Because it will....

Mad season goes against the streamer stereotype. He’s not all about the fame and being a face. He’s relaxed and calm and just plays the game for fun. He doesn’t deserve any sort of ridicule. 
---
If you were familiar at all with his content you’d know he wasn’t being serious and was expecting to die there
---
nice
---
Sigh whatever I’m deleting it all I’d hate to hurt their wittle peelings
---
Eh, if you are a fan of Madseason (youtuber) it's pretty amusing. Without that context I could see it being a bit WTF.
---
If you have never seen his videos on youtube I highly recommend checking them out. Has some great lore, history, tips and other stuff, just search MadSeasonShow. I don't know the guy, so I'm only plugging him because he's actually good.

I am on Dragons Call and there are enough people as far as I know. I'm questing in the barrens and there always people for a group

What do you want? A pat on the back?

Kind of deminishes the value of what you did

maybe with bm you could solo 40 mobs

Looks like you let a toddler pick his own clothes.
---
Wah.
---
Everyone gets to roll.  
---
Even if you're undead.  
---
Even if you have epic mount already.  
---
If you're leaning towards no, then that's just your greed shining through, which happens to the best of us, but it's still just greed.

Which is 13%
---
There's no problem with you discussing this topic and arguing your point of view but there's no need to resort to insults.
---
Well it is pretty easy to check that the person who needs equips it. You guys just are pathetic ninja looter. Easy as that.
---
May be it's part of the "no changes"  policies to get the 2005 feeling?  No seriously not a good thing to have homophobic renaming as it was not meant ironically here.
---
That's a duality of classic. The vast majority of "rare" items in the game are actually pretty terrible.
---
That was not at the start of the dungeon. You either state your loot rules at the beginning, or not at all.
---
Cope
---
I am keenly aware of the duration on my wisdom buff whenever I run out of mana tanking.
---
I run out of mana a lot
---
Hmm yeah okay, thought there might have been a list with some items that stick out. Like, i know one of the parrots is extremely rare and the others are not?
---
I guess i'll just trust auctioneer :)

Not if you only read the first letter of each line.

I did this once and the guy lost and whispered me "thanks for watching and not helping" sarcastically. Then i remembered the time a 60 watched me get ganked by two guys while i had mobs aggroed. So now i swore to always hop into fights unless its super lopsided like a lvl 60 ganking 30s in stv.

The yelling was in cooldown. I used it just before. Sorry for that

You don't want to see WoW being playable on your mobile?

Hey that's pretty good actually fair enough.

Better computers and most of the raiders have done it before. Also higher average age usually helps...far far less kids.

After entering, the game asked you if you want to join his save. If you did, then yes you should be saved

Dem stats though
---
Can hellfire and rain of fire critical strike? I know that dots never critical strike but unsure about these two spells. Thanks in advance!
---
Just tell them not to pull because it makes your job harder and if they continue just let them die even if it causes a wipe.
---
Majestic
---
0.96^50 = 12.9% chance. It asymptotically approaches 0, but will never reach it. 0.96^115 = 0.9% chance. So roughly 1/100 players would not see HoJ drop once in 115 runs.

In the future at least ask for clarification or google how to do it yourself before calling it bad.

Or they know the right place and how the real world works. If I went to a conference for my work and started spewing my world or political views while on their platform, I would be canned on the spot.
---
Almost as ridiculous as Blizzards statement about Blitzchung
---
Hit only needs to scale up as you gain more crit. You dont stack all hit, and you dont stack 9% hit and all crit
---
U also get armor from agi thats just 4 damn things :O But ye those 3 scale hard
---
If I was him, I'd reject the money. If he needs money and accepts it, the whole case is pointless. If hes going to stand up for something, do it in its entirety.

Disregard your own perspective just for one second and look at the actual meaning of "divisive". Calling it divisive, given the context, is a very mild way of putting it but it is unquestionably 100% accurate.
---
Can you give me the link to join? :0
---
Nice
---
still doesn't make you a ninja
---
Fiery wep and life steal are so nice cuz its spelldamage
---
I like to write. Haha I just hope some people bored on a lunch break or scrolling through may happen upon it and smile!
---
But because this has happened before, you have their entire reasoning well documented and they aren't going to change it.
---
They won't let you make guild names based on religions either.
---
What they patched that?? Thats sucks loved that skip...
---
Its fine on Mograine EU
---
I guess you've not been on druid discord (it's pinned in the #guides channel) or read Taladir's treatise on tanking?  
---
Thick hide is calculated as (base armour(100%) + Dire bear form(360%) ) \* Thick Hide (110%) = 506% of on-item armour value when in bear form. Or as a forumla. (1+3.6)\*1.1 = 5.06 
---
So in short, Thick Hide gives 46% extra armor to the 460% you normaly would have and you end up with 506%.
---
I can literally run it with 2 rogues and kill him and reset in 5 minutes
---
Why do I have to cheese so hard for 1 drop lol
---
i farm gold that way. i just solo tinkerer gizlock and princess theradras, let someone reset the dungeon why im logged out and do it again. its about 30-35g per hour from items you can vendor. with mining and herbalism you get way more gold per hour (especially herbalism), but i just got mining
---
You're thinking of Unique-Equipped.
---
Thanks a lot. Looks really good. Is improved hamstring for sword spec to procc? Or are you horde and wf totem? Or HoJ?
---
Also do you tank with 2 hand always and swap only to 1 hand when you press a shield required spell?
---
Epics are literally just giant gold sacks and I don't see what's so unfair about everyone getting an opportunity to roll on it. Comparing random blues from dungeons that everybody is there for worth a few gold to random epics that very rarely drop worth a few hundred gold seems like a bit of a false equivalence to me.
---
Like i said, i dont want to feel bad about it....
---
Figured as much... Thanks!
---
Stealth sound is my alarm clock.
---
play ally
---
What if you wanna be fury warrior.
---
Okay. I guess you are the one tanking most of the damage from mobs and not your succubus, are you eating/bandaging after killing mobs to get the hp back? Or are you using drain life? 
---
There is a popular leveling build commonly referred to as "drain tanking", but that kinda requires fel concentration which you haven't taken. If you want to check that guide out(it's a pretty detailed and we'll made guide imo), google "dive's drain tanking guide".
---
I assume you are a warrior going of your flair. A decent money maker would be tank runs in strat living. On my server tanks are rare and thus allows tanks to reserve orbs from strat and/or charge a fee for tanking that dungeon.
---
#creedthoughts
---
its Erotic....
---
At least he should have translate it for international readers.
---
It’s not from prat I was getting that message before i started using prat
---
Is this good for PvP maybe?
---
I mean. You don't have to do you? There are alternative trinkets that you can get instead if you accept them being lower quality.
---
You’re on a boat full of horde not attacking you and you pull this...
---
I heard many people saying that healing touch rank 4 is one of the most import rank for druid healer since it's the first rank benefiting from 100% of spellpower. However rank 4 is only 3 sec cast while rank 5 is 3.5.  
---
My understanding is that rank 4 should benefit from +/- 85% of spell power and rank 5%....
---
which is it ?
---
That's what happens when you pick a class that is both good at its PvE job, fun, and high quality at PvP I guess.
---
Yes, you can even get a new white one if youd like
---
No, the rogue should hit skull target like everyone else.
---
I wouldnt even mind if it was like that
---
It’s a pve server, people don’t die enought, so it gives them a little adrenaline rush when they do.
---
Ofc it does. What does the one guy who actually needs the epic at this point do? Ofc he accepts getting ninjad by everyone else. Not like you give him a choice.
---
There is no ally dominated server in eu eng, so that is not an option to transfer from anywhere. Only ally dominated are pve, but there won’t be free transfer from pve server to pvp.
---
qXc got banned for 2 games for making homophobic statements, and later on 4 games for saying even more homophobic stuff.
---
2/4 games vs a year/6months.
---
Yup as a Warlock myself if I go into a fight with less than 50% health it's because I'm going to drain life back to full so I can life tap some more.  
---
  
---
Basically ignore the Warlocks, we got this.
---
TradeSkillMaster
---
So if no one in the group needs the item, everyone should greed. It's that simple.
---
So everyone greeds. What a fucking rocket science.
---
That is a us server and not relevant for discussion
---
A raid is a little different, chances are if you're in a raid you actually give a fuck about your groups gear or know them, sorry to say but not everyone is going to care about peoples gear progression in a random dungeon where suddenly when an epic boe drops that specific class who can use it has to pipe up about how they "need it", even though if they really needed it they would have bought it already, the only reason they haven't is because they didn't have the gold, just like everyone else who should also get a chance at selling it and buying their "version" of the item (if one exists) or spending it on whatever, not just the people in the group who happened to win the class lottery.
---
Definitely chose rogue for PvP.
---
&gt;At Blizzard, we are always listening and finding ways to improve—it is part of our culture.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
You look like an angry fruit salad.
---
Maybe 5% of Americans ever use a cheese grater.
---
Most of us get it at a restaurant or from a package. 
---
Grated cheese comes as a powder in a package 
---
Shredded cheese comes as a baggie full of thin strips of cheese.
---
These are factual product labels in every grocery store in america
---
Not a single eu eng pvp server is dominated by alliance, only the rppvp one very slightly. Alliance are on pve servers
---
did I miss something? why would one delete wow?
---
My thoughts. I don't know when they added it, but I got an epic armour piece from a very normal quest in Elwynn forest on retail. Felt disgusting
---
 Heck out zygor
---
Everyone needing prevents someone ninjaing this item, because if 4/5 greeds the ninja can need and run off, and the group can do fuckall about it and one of em lost a potential gold. influx.
---
If there's actually someone who needs it to immediately equip in the group he should say it and actually fucking equip it right after he got it.
---
Everyone needing is just a security measure.
---
Yeah, mostly because it sucks. If you’re levelling as a spec that exclusively does damage by being behind a mob, and you can’t get behind mobs for 90% of the time you’re fighting them, that spec sucks. 
---
God you people are fucking dumb.
---
To be fair, its his guild and its your own choice to stay or leave. Who would have thought that streamers arent always super nice like in the streams trying to lure younto click on the blue paypal box.

But they doesn't happen because someone can then roll need at the last second and ninja. How do you guys not get that? It happened 2 weeks ago with a member from asmongolds guild, they all agreed to roll greed and then the dick rolled need and ninja'd. Everyone rolling need ensures that no one can ninja
---
Confirmed. I'm leveling as holy and exclusively grinding 5ms. I need all day on big int stuff and anything +heal. It's expected. If you plan to level outside of dungeons as well, and see nice mail/plate drop that would be good for soloing.. I could see dps or tank getting upset if they needed and you did too, because you weren't contributing that role at the time. If everyone else greeded I'd say it's fair game but it also wouldn't hurt to ask.

DONKEY

Why were the Hong Kong moderator discussion megathreads deleted? That was the only place to discuss the important events going on with Blizzard.
---
I smell bullshit with a little bit of corruption.
---
Only 5 minutes? Wow head says 10
---
Yeah good point.
---
got it off ah for a cool 60g week 2 of classic
---
Which items?
---
All very true. However I do not like some of those options lol. India very well might be the best shot. We dont need to be another billion population country. Already enough in the world.
---
I know the feels, I recently grinded my mithril for the armorsmith quests.
---
And no sane person would be doing a full dm run
---
You should hit revered with tons of tokens in the bag, else you gonna have a tough time getting exalted.
---
I do ask if one person is pulling not to. That mage then proceeded to run into the next pack and then blink back. When asked if he was serious, he said yes and to ‘hurry up’
---
Slightly difficult to hurry up with no mana on the healer.
---
Luckily my next group was far far better and people respected the marks and CCd; as well as aggro was good. A slower but more successful run with less stress.
---
Yeah look at that ugly mug
---
This doesn't work on my server. The herbs for major mana pots flip for more alone than if you combine them into pots and sell the finished products. I've been following this trend for awhile. I can sell a stack of dreamfoil for 13-15g and a stack of icecap for 5-7g. Yet I can only charge less than 2g a piece for one. 
---
However, I will acquiesce that I have made bank on herbs. I could easily have bought my epic mount by now but I am grinding rep. As it stands, I am halfway to exalted and have around 400g in my pocket.
---
I bought devilsaur leather when it was cheap and sold the pants/gloves. Unfortunately people are driving the price of the devilsaur set way down and the price for leather remains constant so I'm broke as fuck after getting my epic mount.
---
An epic mount isn’t a big deal anyway - the regular mount is just fine until P2 comes out and you are trying to run people down for honor. 
---
I’m a mage - I don’t have my epic mount yet, I’ve spent almost all of my gold on Runecloth for Darn rep. 
---
I’ll get an Epic Tiger Mount eventually, but I’m not in a rush for it ay all.
---
Damn, I hate to do it but I'm gonna unsub. I can't justify giving them my money at this stage
---
I think there is major misconception here. HK protests are not political, rather pro-humanity and anti-genocide protests. They are rebelling not because of a certain political party but rather they don't want to end up in concentration camps or murdered in a police station for no reason. As I read between thelines I and perhaps most thinking people see "We, at Blizzard are pro-money, anti-human rights. We will continue to lick China's ass for more profits."
---
bruh
---
Dont even switch, have an alt for gathering and keep both because engame bs can make some money too
---
Thats good to know thanks!
---
if you want to browse the internet or watch in a bigger window, turn on sound in background, mute the ambience so you can hear the bobber over everything in game, get an app that makes your browser always on top (this means no matter what you do your browser will stay there even if you click on wow or drag a window over it), drag your browser to the left (or right) so its only half of your screen enable always on top on then have your cam like this https://i.imgur.com/bINKtJy.jpg where you can see your bobber on the right and browser on the left. and what I do for fishing is just turn on auto loot, set your fishing to your action bar, bind that action bar to a button on your mouse, and all you gotta do is keep your hand on the mouse and when you catch a fish click on bobber then you click your fishing button right after.
---
Every *run
---
Yeah, it will.
---
&gt; I've played priest and shaman healer for many years. I played warrior and deathknight tank for many years. I played mage a bit but never dedicated. I've been split between 2 servers and recently chosen one. I know this should belong in the whatshouldiplay post but, priest vanilla is boring. I was playing healer and tank to get the most out of dungeon finder. I think I need to just respec holy and grind dungeons or something.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I do have a higher level rogue that I've been enjoying once I finally got vanish and other neat tricks.
---
&gt; My mage is also around the same level as my priest on this server.
---
Are you bored with levelling or the class itself? If you think it's the class, really think about it because I might have some suggestions for you.
---
Because gamers are a bunch of idiots that dont understand contracts/rules, business, or politics. They find their most current bandwagon topic to jump on to seem relevant.
---
A twohand tank also does 50% of the groups damage with windfury. There is a reason why people play with 2hand nowadays.
---
&gt; We're done talking now
---
So what if it were a BoE worth a lot AND only I could use? Do I not get to save myself hundreds of gold on an epic because everyone else is thinking about the money?
---
What happens if i get disconnected midflight?
---
Oh yeah lol it's 12.99% wasn't tryna correct ya
---
People don’t like being told the time they’re spending on “advanced strategy” is a complete waste. 
---
Rogue is easy, anyone that tells you otherwise is bad or lying
---
I think you confused arms and fury. Gimli with his 2h axe is arms and Aragorn on several occasions use dual wield =&gt; fury.
---

Justify it how you want, greed is greed, aka sell for money. Need is need, aka will equip.
---
I don't understand this logic of rolling need on boes cus it's gold. Why don't you all roll need on bops too, some vendor for 5g. You wouldn't, cus then you show your hand before you can nick something
---
I'm sorry, but it still doesn't seem to work. I got the error popup, but it was empty, no error text. I'm not sure what happened there.

ah ok good to know. Wish you could hide it somehow.

They existed in vanilla and I specifically remember vanilla players in 2004 also saying the EXACT same thing.  I remember having a chat way back in 2004 with someone from a server-first guild.  I told him I was using addons.  He said I was cheating.  I said to him, what if I was only using an addon that told me the time or my coordinates.  He said it was still cheating.  But if he's still playing in that server-first guild, I'd bet anything that he uses addons now.
---
It's just a warped mentality to say addons are bad for Classic.  It's wrong - addons are GOOD for Classic.  They allow people to customise their game and make it personal.  And that's hugely beneficial to the success of Wow Classic.
---
If you roll greed then any future roller can decide to ignore your roll. 
---
If everybody agrees to roll need then it's essentially a greed roll that can't be overruled by anybody.
---
They all were late for reservering character names lol
---
Not funny
---
You lose combo points if you mouseover + root a different target. You didn't in the beta, but it was fixed before the game went live.
---
Why would you bind mind control it's not used very frequently..

i didnt know details have it so ty \^\^ much more smooth now \^\^
---
How long was your Magmadar fight?
---
Right, as if giving money ONLY to Blizzard is implicit in supporting Chinese human rights violations. How about stop being a failed abortion and quit your sanctimonious arm chair outrage.
---
That's usually my protocol.  I'll go about my life tapping as per usual, at this point the healers I'm playing with have played with enough leveling locks to know what's up, but if they dump a big heal on me I'll whisper next break to save the mana unless I pulled aggro like an idiot and to please save me.
---
Problem with drain health as a method to keep me alive, not just charged up for mana, is that once I'm relying on it to live, I'm with that mob unil it's dead, and not a lot is going to be able to pull the aggro off me.  So popping a big heal and just soaking the damage without dealing it back can allow the tank to reestablish threat, whereas leaving me to drain health is going to cause cascading issues for the pull.
---
It's why my #1 job as a lock is to walk the line between sustaining my man's through the pull with those talents, but not pulling aggro.  (or accidently DOTing a new mob during the initial DOT spam or corruption redot)
---
glad you realised that's your most intelligent comeback
---
He is entitled for it because he was in the group and can equip it. By your logic you aren't entitled to BOP loot. So everyone should need it. No the amount it's worth doesn't make any difference, so stop before you answer with that shit.
---
Greed is to sell the item, need if you want to equip it. Easy as that. Stop with your ninja looting rules.
---
&gt; It works the same as any other dps tanking. Not super well, and healer reliant.
---
Not really true. Warlock Tanks are the best caster tank, directly below Paladin Tank (which can tank raids). 
---
I linked a guide to OP above your post, if you're interested to learn more.
---
You have copy/pasted this exact post in multiple Classy Friday threads.
---
Nope. 5 mins
---
Is the quest “Falrin’s Vendetta” (DM ogre bead quest) available to get Beads of Ogre Might starting when DM opens Tuesday?
---
Does Arcane/Shadow resist help against poly/fear? Or does resists only affect damage?
---
The opposite faction is not my friend in any way shape or form :D
---
NS is also a lifesaver if you're in a pickle and need an instant heal. I'd choose NS for sure, and I played vanilla as a sham, and on private servers.
---
Fuck are you asking us for. Don’t pay for shit that bores you. I hope you got that loot from pugs though, because it’s a bit of a shit move to just bail on your guild like that
---
By the sounds of it, you're going to have a lot of free time.
---
We all know from experience that if anything classic players like to send a message when somebody fucks up royally.
---
We did it with nost, and if me showing blizzard that they had me for 2 months then lost me doesn't send a message It at least makes me feel better about my own choice.
---
Looks messy to me. Too much information in the middle of the screen compared to seeing what is around you.
---
Can Heavy Junkbox contain epic boe world drop?
---
Ignoring someone is not an account wide ignore. However, you are technically skirting how the ignore function is supposed to work and if reported, could get temporarily banned
---
So Honor is betraying your faction by mingling with the enemy? Allrighty then :D
---
Yes there ism you can be the holy priest that specs in to shadow weaving so you dont have to do the inferior method and take a shadow priest. That technically counts as shadow heal hybrid
---
People also forget than stamina keeps you alive and int gives you crit. +Shadow damage is only really bis (for a long time) in wand slot where you don't get many stats anyway.
---
Macklorc thrift shopping in this mutha fucka
---
There's really nothing like completely wasting another player's time solely for your own personal enjoyment. I'm leveling an alt priest right now and I take every opportunity I can to MC the opposing faction off boats. It is the biggest possible rate of return if you want to ruin the opposing faction's lives as much as possible.

Lol power ranger

Not if you have zero energy. Then you will hold the white attacks until you can do a yellow

Why not just log in for raids to continue to gear for phase 2 with world pvp?
---
Guys i managed to fix it. I was using macro together with /cast defensive stance (which was before equipslots) . And after i had the equip macros. Now i have equipslot 16 then 17 and only after the /cast defensive stance and its working . Tyvm all for your time :)
---
I love the moment where everyone runs out of your los before realizing you're by yourself.
---
Fucking. Bullshit. Is that why a statement ensuring you'd "safeguard the dignity of the country (China) was made? Blizzard cares about your pocketbook, and that's it.
---
Look up rp emote macros. From there you should be able to just adjust one to your liking.
---
You look stunning.
---
How do you even grind this rep??
---
Hello, you can have a lot of good gear just by dungeons, some quest and crafts already. The gap between you and a raider will not be THAT huge if you have an Arcanite reaper or so.
---
In term of stats you will have most of the best out of raid anyway except weapon, but it will be mitigate by the fact that your have talent PVP spec so... don't worry and enjoy the game you want to play.
---
If it’s your preference, go nuts. 
---
But it sucks. In the perfect scenario you might get back to back ambush crits sure. But that’s not accounting for multiple mob pulls, travel time between mobs, miss chance, being spotted in stealth, time wasted stealth walking, poor dagger availability and scaling while levelling etc. 
---
It’s not practical at all, there’s a reason everyone knows combat is better and dagger levelling sucks. It’s because it sucks.
---
Honestly? Looks *fucking* sexy
---
TL;DR: "Fuck you, we're doubling down on our corporate greed."
---
And let the game die because at some point people will have finished everything?
---
Did you throw away every single china made products out of your house hero? The phone and computer you are using to type this message? Didnt think so, now shut your bitch ass mouth and stop acting like an activist, you are pathetic.

Haven't you heard? All world PvP is ganking now.
---
&gt; Was in an UBRS pug the other day and the other mage died 3 times. I didn't die once. And I topped him on damage meter. Go figure.
---
Dead dps do no damage, not surprised at all.
---
I've tanked as a Raid Shaman Tank t'ill a few bosses into Naxx. So I'll share my experience. 
---
Shaman's excel with a raid without requiring to move the sun and stars around.
---
Warlock Tank requires so many things: Alliance, Bag of Marbles, proper raid comp, etc...
---
But can deal more threat and survive better if done properly.
---
Yes
---
The only way it is cheating is if you abuse it for combat. 
---
I did this glitch dozens of times back in vanilla and BC and NEVER got banned or even a warning.
---
Mutliboxer scum aka botting that's legal because it makes blizz more money
---
That is some ground clutter
---
I've never noticed this little pun in hundreds of DM runs across tens of characters. GG Blizz!
---
Heroic strike has at least 20% more expected damage than an auto attack while __dual wielding__. You are converting a white hit (27?% miss) to a yellow hit (5% vs equal level) . So it deals quite a bit more than regular auto attacks. That doesn't change the fact that it's a bad idea to spend rage on hs while leveling. I guess using hs to convert white to yellow won't be useful till bwl or even naxx (earlier for horde). But people should keep that in mind so they can reach their full potential later on.
---
It's to avoid people ninjaing the item. It's gold no matter if you need it or not; either you're gaining 300g from selling it or saving 300g from buying it. If ypu weren't going to buy it then you don't need it.
---
honestly if it was just over a purple I could understand, or at least if someone wants to use it they could shell over a bit of gold. I see people say this about blue BoE though which is a lot more practical to want to equip.
---
I'll be sure to shoot it off your head when I see you &lt;3
---
&gt; Tell me, how much dps does your highest dps deal on Magmadar?
---
&gt; How do you plan to tank ebonroc? How do you deal with Annihilators and other mobs that drop aggro and typically require a taunt?
---
&gt; If your answer is that dps have to throttle, then its a garbage strategy and you are hindering your raid group.
---
&gt; What is your fastest MC clear as a shaman tank?
---
This should answer the majority if not all your questions regarding Shaman Tanks https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150

Sahara
---
this is indeed both decent in pricing and more than enough to run wow on, however I'd strongly advise you to select a better psu, as you should never cheap out on a psu. invest 20 pounds more or so into one of the bequiet psus they offer while configuring your PC.
---
Is it viable to pick up blacksmithing as a rogue, focusing on weaponsmithing?

I've made an alt I want to have some fun with, and my main already has herbalism and alchemy. I'm not really all to keen on leatherworking, as the market for tribal seems to be a bit full on both Noggenfogger and Pyrewood Village
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
It's gold no matter if you need it or not; either you're gaining 300g from selling it or saving 300g from buying it. If you weren't going to buy it then you don't need it.
---
Yeah, Vivendi was so much better 🙄
---
Maybe it was guided by a bot? He entered dungeon, put bot switch on and went to make some coffee?
---
We will just have to agree to disagree on that. I dont think they are gonna change their stance now regardless so kind of moot on my part anyways. Either way I do agree they had to do something. As much as I am for Hong Kong protestors it was a poor platform him to voice it on in terms of career moves and giving them a no win scenario. However it did start a very large discussion on a couple of issues so maybe it was the right way to do it. Depends on if he is happy with the outcome or not.
---
Isn’t it gonna be even harder to get the other one though
---
I think you will log back on and either still be in flight or be at your destination, depending on how long it's been
---
"I have to do this thing where I can't play for a couple of days and now I want Blizzard to make new fresh servers because I can't find a group and don't want to heal and or tank and I'm behind. Here are the list of my weak arguments."

Moronic post.

If you have it, use it!

It's evident that you're going to suck off Overwatch until the bitter end so have a good one mate
---
Oh no, there is something about sex in my game. Ban it!
---
Attack power affects anything that says it does weapon damage plus some amount, or specifically mentions attack power in the tooltip. So, it'll affect Ambush and Eviscerate, but it won't affect Gouge.
---
Check your raid lock... simple 😂
---
Note to read this
---
1.12 has stat reworks, talent reworks, more debuffs, a nerfed molten core, quality of life changes like marks, etc, etc. Molten Core was never hard in terms of mechanic difficulty, it was hard because of gear checks. 
---
Even some dungeon bosses now are facerolls, when I distinctly remember them being incredibly difficult (Strat had like 5-6 minute respawns, Ramstein needed to be kited, Baron required a Holy Water rotation, etc).
---
Except for paladin T3........
---
This happened to me, as a Rogue. Hunter needs both and wins them :(
---
My point is that it sucks having gear given out thinking you would stick around just get lost. That was an investment in you and in turn an investment in the guild as a whole
---
you can hide it in settoings
---
Yes i will trade all those for tact mastery. If you are unable to see the value of how much utility is, then too bad for you. There are raid encounters design around stance swapping if i wanted to be more pedentic about it
---
Man I login just to sell 20 silver ports and give people free food and water in org. There’s many ways to play this game, it’s all subjective.
---
Wait, why couldn't he see it? Isn't it a different ring?
---
And if not why does it matter if he already has it
---
Holy sht this is AMAZING. Awesome work. I dont know what to say, i love it.
---
It was never the standard when I played Vanilla. Again I guess it's either a private server thing or shitty NA mentality.
---
Classicwow.live, anyone paying for zygor is a moron
---
Not exalted. Honored.
---
Me four
---
Not sure what the problem is. I’m leveling an alt on bloodfang EU and there are plenty of people to run low level instances with. And it’s even one of the „non-layered“ servers.
---
Do you really need that much hit though?
---
Exactly. At this point almost every international business is guilty of something of the sort
---
I don't even get why people think retail is toxic in this way. If I run up to an herb and come across someone else fighting a mob they aggro'd trying to get to that herb, I'll most likely help that person out. Because we aren't competing and will both be able to pick the herb. I'll even have way more drama in dungeons in classic due to loot competition. In retail it's more like "do u need that?"
---
I'm classic? The worst I'll do is probably move on and go about my day rather than help the person out. But many others will happily pick the mine/herb/chest while the other is in combat.
---
I got banned from this sub for basically saying what blizz said and now you guys circle jerk blizz lol nice
---
That's a lot of bots that I've grouped with if so. I've yet to have a Mage that even casts Frostbolt. Ever. I don't understand why every Mage does this.
---
why do you insist on being so stupid?
---
&gt;There is a guild out there somewhere that will take a dps shaman.
---
But if you join them, you need to be willing to accept that their raid style is a guild that will take a dps shaman.
---
TLDR A communist country is forcing the world to choose between capitalism and democracy. So far, the west, when given the choice, seems to prefer capitalism.
---
I'm impressed if not a little skeptical. I grind at those spots a lot too and don't make anywhere near that but I'm a hunter
---
Everyone needs the item the exact same amount though, because they're all just going to sell it.
---
eww such a retard mindset
---
Absolutely terrible idea. This would be very bad for the overall health of all currently existing servers.
---
New realms are something we could talk about after AQ40/Naxx came out, but right now there’s no reason for them at all.
---
I don't have to give you a single reason to justify doing whatever I find as fun. If you really have a problem with me taking [these types of fights](https://imgur.com/ZQ8Z6su) then you have a problem.
---
I personally use 30/21/0, get all the threat and damage deduction talents (10defense points not worth 5 talent points tho) and blessing of sanctuary. 
---
This is my current build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkxVRtI0z
---
You may not want 5 in spiritual focus but I like it for non interrupt healing, and being able to stick conc aura on and throwing a big heal on myself when fighting non interrupt mobs.
---
You have all the important stuff from the holy tree so this is perfectly viable. I found my guild needed a tank more than anything so over time I just gathered tank gear and now I have the pre raid bis tank and heal gear. I also tend to prefer tanking undead dungeons such as school or stratholme due to the pseudo-taunt of exorcism.
---
Deathbone set from Scholomance is amazing fyi.
---
Put on a tabard and hide head and cloak. Done
---
Funny story. Me and my guildy made our classic characters and flagged ourselves to change the color of our names and had the running joke that we were real pvpers.
---
And we totally forgot about it days later when this incident occurred. We wrote it off as a norm of pvp servers.
---
We aren't the brightest of the bunch but what we lack in brains we make up for it in character
---
Don’t know what to tell you, I honestly never realized how this was an issue even back in vanilla. If you don’t die regularly, get the majority of your do through quests from 45-60, and don’t waste gold on AH, abstain from leveling professions by buying materials, there is no reason you shouldn’t be at at least 600+ gold once you hit 60.
---
I got lucky with a few items that I sold for probably 100g in total on the AH before I singed. Got there in a bit over 6 days played as a warrior, respecced twice and bought my epic mount after a few days of doing end game dungeons while also doing the quests for the respective dungeons. I also had 300 engi/mining. This is by far not a humble brag. I’m just trying to say that you need to hit the zones you obviously skipped out on and just plow through the quests. Including instance quests. 
---
As an example, the Balzanar/Rivendare quest rewards around 20/25g or something in total, if you sell the staff reward, and it’s one of like 8 quests in strat alone. 
---
You can easily achieve this without the backbreaking boring ass grind.
---
Hide helmet + back and your looking slightly better.
---
I genuinely think they've nerfed target range for classic, multile videos from vanilla have people able to target him from the instance entrance, in classic it's a crapshoot
---
Nifty stopwatch of course! Gotta go fast!
---
The hard cap for Warriors is 9% Hit, The Devilisaur set piece gives 2%   
---
The set is very good however because of the Attack Power and Crit chance, so have the overflow of 1% Hit doesn't matter in the long run.
---
TLDR: Yes, it matters :)
---
Honestly, the new generation of Mages that use Blizzard on single targets makes me yearn for early days of Hunter/Rogue players that rolled their face on their keyboard.
---
It's not a game company's role to determine who is the most ethical in a revolution. At the end of the day, virtue signalling on behalf of Hong Kong does not keep the lights on for the workers in Anaheim. If Blizzard, and every other entity that hosts tournaments suspended their rules, how long until every piece of entertainment is hijacked for people's personal beliefs? Until people get paid to make those kind of statements?
---
Minor movementspeed on your boots is so good before you get a mount!
---
He was shadowmelded in the beginning. If you think the hordes there saw him and all decided to just leave him alone, you're delusional.
---
Because an item worth a lot of gold just dropped and he couldn't even roll to try and sell it, presumably. That is accurate to vanilla though, but it's mostly just crappy that you're completely unaware. I've had it with the UBRS gems, a friend needed the gem from the last boss, and he lost the roll on it, and he was just like "fuck this guy!" on voice chat, to which I was just super confused why he was suddenly mad.
---
Glad I didn’t rush to buy. Feeling Kindof flush right now,  definitely gonna sleep on it
---
Wasn’t meant to be
---
Basilisk Eye and Boomerang if you’re not an engineer, so at least you trinkets do something. 
---
Or literally anything besides the AD trinket, so people have to actually inspect you to tell that your gear is bad, instead of getting an aura that broadcasts that info to anyone who even clicks on you.
---
If they dont pull anything i dont care if the 2 ranged blast down the mob from range or up close. Problem is you usually get extra adds this way.
---
I swear to god, whoever designed those patrols in strat had a nastyx streak. 3 types of patroling enemies with either aoe silence or aoe fear depending on type with wildly different patrol lengths and speeds.
---
Is it not just the mini map moved to be next to his action bars?
---
He has hemo so wouldn’t be using sinister strike
---
Crusaders enchantment on weapon will make you very OP
---
Agrees. 
---
Tank decide pace /pull order
---
Healer mana decide pace between pulls.  
---
I may suggest we sheep one and blast Skull but it takes longer then going mental with two mages I would assume a AoE run.
---
He's a good boy.
---
Imagine not keybinding literally every spell and item
---
I guess they don’t learn frostbolt ranks, maybe? 
---
I’ve had mages who did not learn decurse...

Idk. I got 60 about two weeks after release. Alot of the players I pug with are decent enough that I don't have much trouble. I guess my gear is good enough now that the content difficulty is trivial and I'm good enough at healing that i can carry if shit hits the fan. I guess we'll see more and more people hitting max level soon, so the pug experience might change. But as a whole, runs are not chaotic. They might get chaotic sometimes, but it's rarely from player negligence, but rather inexperience in a certain dungeon.
---
Ya idk I picked up a Staff of Jordan for 50g and a bunch of blue (crafted) gear from the AH in the past 10 levels and I'm still chilling on 100g at level 50. Just from questing, killing mobs and a ZF run here and there. People must not be auto looting everything that drops lol
---
I saw savage gladiator chain drop twice before getting HoJ.
---
I’d say do it. It’s nice to take a break so you’ll be fresh for phase 2.
---
Oh come on, if everyone spammed this sub with 1% chance rolls, we'd have 4000 similar threads
---
everyone "greeds" it the same amount  O\_O
---
Aaand?
---
Yes cancel it and be undergeared so you will get one shot.
---
Besides theres so much more to do, now is the time to build all the pots for p2&amp;p3. Get your new pre bis with DM, do a weekly mc.
---
Why even rush to 60 and do all this if all you care about is pvp?
---
It's just the truth; the primary purpose of BoE epics and rares is to stimulate the economy; they can't be farmed or worked for.
---
This is wrong. You can see the item on the mob, but you can't pick it up, and you won't see the box rolling on it. Chat will still show who won it.  
---
Source: I sell ring runs too.
---
That's right! The high amount of Crit given by the base Devilisaur pieces, as well as it having stam makes it just as useful and works out easier than finding another piece that gives good stats, has less hit etc. 
---
This also gives the added bonus of being able to flex into PvE for your endgame PvP pieces (If you aren't going full High Warlord) 
---
Theoretically you could go full pvp with 6% Hit cap and stacking attack power and strength on other pieces, but in the long run it is easier to just go with Devilisaur set to make it easier later on
---
He cracks them up then he fucks em up.
---
Cries in warrior
---
Wait what? It applies to Shock? Is it some unintended spell batching result or what, because the tooltip doesn't say anything about it.
---
My war is 43 rn with cleaver and decent gear Its very tempting to pvp at 49 for a while, no bgs yet tho
---
Ι've done around 40 UBRS runs I think, enough to get Painweaver Band and Shadowcraft Tunic, and I have never seen neither the MH or OH drop.
---
Who hurt you
---
I hope you're not playing shatter if you're playing like that
---
I havent seen people attack each other on a boat yet
---
So he did the usual thing (auction rare BoEs) and made some gold
---
Im... sorry, what am I missing here?
---
Why aren't YOU using something like Auctioneer and selling the stuff yourself?
---
A slippery slope indeed.. Trust me you are going to appreciate the fact that you can recognize the pink haired gnome that camped you in STV for 5 hours.
---
Alright thanks :) Wish we had the maths around it tho ^^
---
Download Questie, Leatrix maps addon and Cartographer (I think this one shows which level range each zone is. Or just google "wow classic quest zones level ranges")
---
Then I just open the map and look for zones. I mostly want yellow quests, green are fine too sometimes. Then, say I'm lvl 43, I go to 40-45 zones on the map, and 35-45, there are usually 2-3 zones. Open them on that in-game map, and Questie shows me exclamation points for all the quests I can take there. Then I see what zone has most of them (you can also point cursor on these exclamation points to see what level each quest is), and then just travel there, grab quests and get to it. I try to do a few at a time, but there are no strict rules really, if you'd inventory is full or you're bored you can travel back. Good luck!
---
You’re still here?  Lol.
---
Hey you got it all wrong. I FN a second time as well, in order for two higher crit chance moments. Don't forget that, fucking casual
---
You could make a good detailed colouring book from these mate. I've been looking for some of late
---
You also don't need to be perfectionist either, I quite often postpone/skip quests that require extensive travel. Just enjoy yourself :)
---
Vanilla resto shamans always looked ridicilous trough leveling and early pve, and then sudenly like butterfly from the coccoon they show up in full ten storms set in ogrimmar and everbody drool over them.
---
I was thinking [the nice super mutant lady from New Vegas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lily_Bowen)
---
Play another class you think you'll personally enjoy the flavor of.
---
I'm guessing you went mage and AoE grinded yourself into boredom?
---
I'm maining a paladin and leveling can be slow but I enjoy the fact I can help out low levels around me so I get fulfillment more out of that then leveling. 
---
I'm also a filthy casual who lvls a few alts to try em out and give extra gold to my pally to help him.
---
 Point being, I personally would be bored to death AoE grinding and would rather take it slower and build relationships along the way.

---
Oh god I nearly died! Well done.
---
It absolutely doesn't matter though, getting a bis item before you're even 60 is worth quite a lot. If he wants to min max in the slightest, getting the smoking heart of the mountain out of the way while leveling is the most efficient way to go about it. As a druid you don't need a mount at 40, it can wait a few levels, neither are you gear dependent because you're having a really smooth leveling experience either way. 
---
Doesn't matter if you can buy them off the ah, they are not "MC" items, and neither are the mats overly expensive if you were to buy them instead of collecting them while leveling, which again is the whole point of why it's the most efficient route
---
Of course, because you get no party bonus exp doing in a raid.
---
20/31/0 raid build? I guess you also play 2h in raid?
---
60 mage is my main, but I'm currently leveling a warrior. Was grouped with a mage yesterday n asked mage in group to decurse me. He said " oh I didn't know I could do that". Tbf to him he told me he was learning his class so I gave him some pointers on decursing, but I can now see where this prejudice against mages comes from.
---
they reduced the punishment by more than 83%
---
Can a prot pally farm ZF for gold? I know it won’t be as decent as a mage but is it worth doing?
---
No firm numbers, but usually when healing your crits become over heals. This is because you know how much your heals should heal for and pick the right one because of it. So I’d usually go with plus healing
---
It's the mascara
---
Its allways fucking retarted that when you have warrior in group, plate epic drops and mages go screamin ALL NEED...
---
And then someone else can ninja the item. Which is why everyone needs it. Everyone basically greeds the item, but to avoid ninja they all need. It's THAT simple.
---
It can but it has a short internal cool down
---
As a shaman, I’d rather not imagine this
---
Fuck blizzard, fuck wow
---
What's his name? Make a gnome mage for him! He might have trouble leveling, so you'll have to do some of that for him. But I'm sure he'd appreciate it. 😍
---
People dont invest in bags.  They are the best things and will pay for themselves.

Hey guys I have an unlimited supply of free time, what should I do with it?
---
There are many instances where people in extremely frustrating competitive situations end up taking out their emotions on people and things around them before apologizing.
---
If youre talking someone on the street, sure. But where on the street does a situation like this take place? He spent the better part of his week waiting for this
---
The chances of that happening are pretty low. While no one will disagree that windfury is a solid shaman perk. For every one-shot you'll have 10 situations where the shaman is looking in frustration at his auto attack damage.
---
AB is scheduled for P4. Most likely we will get WSG early and P3 will have AV
---
It be much simpler for a bot to just spam frostbolt on the tanks target.
---
d2 and for many specs its better than t2.
---
Boreal Mantle is still better than Burial Shawl for a frost mage. The real benefit to farming Witchblade is the chance at the wand, which will remain BiS until BWL, unless you're lucky enough to get the wand off of Azuregos.
---
I feel like the lower BG scene, especially 10-19 will be kind of dead. Unlike vanilla there will probably be a very high % of twinks since most of the population has played wow before and 1-20 is easily doable for the most casual players during their first day.
---
Why does "expensive" change it? Everyone rolls greed on Green BoEs that may even be upgrades. Is it green, and BoE? Immediate greed. 
---
Now somehow those rules change because the perceived value has gone up? That is not how conventional systems work. They should be based on convention and easily understood. 
---
If you want to equip the item you need it. If you want to sell it you greed it. If you don't want it you pass it 
---
The loot system had this design in mind. You are trying to change the loot system to fit your own desired rules. That's fine if you clarify it with literally every group in the beginning. 
---
The point of a loot system is not having to clarify the shit every single run. 
---
I personally roll last when possible to see what others are doing. This can also be annoying as fuck if people are trying to skin the mobs by the way.
---
Literally in the messages towards the bottom where he apologizes
---
No, this wasnt just being toxic. This was pure emotion brought on by a game that makes you so invested that you put days into 1 single thing and can become so frustrated you end up like this man.
---
I wonder if any of the people completely dismissing this man have ever actually been in any stressful competitive situation. The only thing really comparable is sports and this sort of thing happens all the time
---
Am I the only one who thinks these names aren't funny?
---
Well that's just strange at this point, maybe in the early days of classic I could see/understand that but at this point boe blues are barely worth anything. The only ones I could think of would be twink items from like sfk, you would have to be a moron to equip that since in a few levels you will get a better weapon from a quest/dungeon.
---
I love how every caster over level 40 wears the Whitemanes Chateu.  Wearing one right now on my level 42 mage.
---
wasn't worth it
---
Mages, the new hunters! Regularly out-damage all mages in dungeons by 2x-3x to their surprise.
---
mage: "WTF?! My blizzard does like 5k dps!"
---
me: "Because me and my pet spend 99% of our time doing damage!"
---
Still get passed over in favor of mages "because we need dmg". Or "thank god we brought a mage" followed by confusion why the instance suddenly takes so long after I leave..
---
Bet many having the same experience (shout out to my warrior friends). Feel bad for the few good mages out there (haven't met a single one yet unfortunately).
---
You play on Skeram?
---
Just don't join those groups? Not sure what you wanted to accomplish with this post
---
Is that a Razer Naga and Corsair keyboard? Looks very familiar!
---
I would play the AH a bit. You just have to make sure you invest wisely.
---
I got my 100g at Lv36 doing AoE grinding, only AH I did was cloth and a couple 1-2g greens.  If the spot is contested, find other humanoids.  Go back to Arathi at the Goshek farm or find some harpies somewhere.  That's the best way to do it.
---
That's why Sam got laid
---
You really don't have to tank mobs when a mage is in the group, just need to taunt/stun the ones that get close to them so the pack balls up. Or at the very least, pick up elite mobs and don't even worry about regular ones or even casters.
---
I honestly don't even pick up casters anymore (would stun/shield bash and maybe use 1 sunder/revenge/shield slam then move to the next), you spend rage trying to pick stuff that isn't threatening and you can no longer hold the stuff that is on you. You honestly don't get hit hard enough until MC so you are rage starved, so it's pointless to waste it on a mob that can be interrupted/stunned and burst it down. In some situations, lack of rage can be compounded with a miss/dodge/parry I'll sit around waiting for 10 rage so i can stun a mob and it will go from 100 to 40% before I even get it. 
---
Mage has all the tools to kite/hold threat, so long as you heal and protect them with the occasional single target taunt/aoe taunt/stun/mocking blow/int shout/intercept, they can carry a dungeon group on their back. It's really just about holding mobs as long as you can when you have a mage in a dungeon party, you don't have the rage to cycle targets and spam abilities. 
---
The melee elites can shred healers/dps at higher levels, so those need to get picked up. Most casters in this game are harmless as long as dps is focusing it down.
---
Items and consumables that do aoe damage, like some trinkets, equipment, food or specific items can greatly help your snap aoe threat, as most warriors quickly find out that battle shout/demo shout/thunder clap and whirlwind will not suffice. Engineering bombs are huge but costly over time. Same thing can be said about holy water or trinkets like Ramstein's bolts. Force reactive disk looks particularly insane when paired up with various aoe centrist items. And with dire maul coming out, more reflect gear will be available.
---
This would work if you wanted to PvE aswell, but for a full PvP build i wouldn’t be wearing all that leather, makes you squishy. And I wouldn’t worry about hitting 9 % hit either
---
Devilsaur and truestrike is good for PvE, but I would probably switch one or both for mail or plate pieces.
---
The legs from Dire Maul coming soon and Stronghold Gauntlets for that sweet ‘Immune to Disarm’ could replace Devilsaur.
---
You look fabulous.
---
I mean the most ridiculous thing was his face. Can't transmog that anyway
---
What is the person who actually needs the item supposed to do? When as soon as the item drops someone yells "EVERYONE ROLL NEED".
---
Specify your loot rules at the start of the dungeon, not at the point when a item drops. It's the same concept when people change to master looter before the boss they want the item from.
---
I wear my grandad’s robes, I look incredible, I got this big as cloak from the AH down the road
---
Are we sure about this? Because then we would only look at DPS on weapons except for having buffs like wind fury?
---
As a healer this is easy to avoid. Let the dps taking agro die... and it will be clear they are taking agro from the tank...
---

Underrated comment

thats me!

Fuck this, where is goldshire tavern inn
---
Nice flowers, haha dried hydrangea!
---
what year were those comments posted? things change.
---
Generally speaking I’m okay with people reserving items, even if they’re something I want/need. It’s just a choice really. If you advertise a StratUndead run and the mount is on reserve, I might still go because there are other things I want, and if the mount drops then congrats to the leader. I consider it a small tax to pay for not having to make the group myself.
---
As a hunter player, I’ve done a ton of BRD arena/angerforge runs in an attempt to get SGC or HOJ, and have reserved them almost every time. Groups may fill more slowly but everyone is on the same page that way and there’s no drama to things dropping
---
Yeah, nice save buddy
---
I dont agree with dead, but the concept of many more twinks is very exciting!
---
Apologies my copy and paste didn’t detect that,
---
Yes, so cringe not to want people to be harassed in a social space xD
---
Exactly, whatever the group decides is the way to do it. Letting the tank know what you can do, lets them decide. People just need to communicate.
---
That makes sense, I can see it from that view.
---
Yes ML there is a Spot where the player can stay afk and still get the Ring. He only pays for the Rings every other item is mine otherwise its not worth it to run the dungeons.
---
Can't wait for the juicy Don Julios band
---
Het that's not how you level up cooking!!
---
Irony?
---
Mograine and Ashbringer are 50/50 high pop realms
---
Supply and demand i guess.. if there is only one pug raid group a week that you can attend, expect them to use the 'limited supply' and request a 'high demand' for the effort they put in (by asking gold, reserving items).
---
If there are multiple weekly pug raid groups you can join, you have the option to choose one with the least demands (or no demands). Ofcourse creating your own weekly raid pug (organising, leading) you can create your own 'no demands/reserves' run.
---
So imo its justified and just how the market works. You have all the freedom to choose to join the reserved runs or influence the market by creating more supply.
---
Keep leveling? Instead of wasting time farming gold to get it at 40 you could just keep leveling without a mount at get it at 42-5 instead
---
Why FS + CoC before Nova? I'm pretty sure it's more Mana efficient to first Nova because of shatter

Yeah, anyone hoping to take shortcuts in gear evaluation in classic is going to have a bad time.  If you’re investing willing to invest hundreds of hours into the game, spend the ten minutes (or hour, if you really are a total excel noob) to figure out how to use an already existing spreadsheet for gear evaluation.
---
&gt;The problem for me is that you lose all sense of how powerful/geared someone you encounter is. When you run across someone with fully transmogged gear you don’t know what they’re actually wearing. 
---
Who care, seriously ? If a guy is in T1 or in a stuff transmog into T1, that mean he had the time, patience and skill to have his T1 in the first place.
---
Seriously, i've never seen anyone complaining about sagefish delight making your stuff disappear and impossible to identify when you transform into a ninja, how is transmog a problem ?
---
Also, you can't transmog a low level stuff with another than you can't wear normally, so with the exception of heirlooms, if you transmog was in classic, you'd never seen someone with a transmog stuff better than what he currently wear.
---
The problem with all of this is that it's NOT an arms weapon.  Of course its terrible as sword spec arms. Its way too fast and the proc isn't as useful.  This is a 2h fury weapon and a phenomenal one at its price range.  I am at 60 still using mine and destroying the damage meters because I'm spec'd correctly to use it. The 200 str proc is phenomenal for fury as it gives a flat 400 AP to your bloodthirst attack.  I feel sorry for people who see this post and think its accurate when you only covered the wrong way to use it.
---
I think you're misunderstanding. The point is Yes you can tank, but there is no reason for you to tank. Rogues can tank, Hunters can tank, Shamans can tank, Shadow Priests can tank. Other than saying you did it, there is no point out side of Twin Emps.
---
Thankyou. Do thrash blade pls ;)
---
Shitpost
---

My warrior friend who neede hoj taught this to me a couple weeks back and it took me a while to get the jump right to get above the window.

Dear diary
---
Because the nova will break instantly and you will be hit. You can FlameStrike, CoC at the same time, then nova before they turn and hit you. By the time the Nova break from you spamming AE the mobs will be dying.
---
Use shatter combo if you gave the tank time to get aggro.
---
Or do SM cath and do both at the same time.
---
Yep. Easy to pick up and if you wanted to master it, there's a ton of stuff you can pick up and learn to contribute to raids, too.
---
Plus it's got some great solo opportunities even in the late-game.
---
If you ever start to raid though, do note they're rather limited in slots. Most guilds run with 3-4 tops.

There's not so much guns in this game especially if u r not taking engineering while levelling.

roleplayers are probably the one who use and like the most transmog because their characters can actually look like what they are supposed to be (a thief can look like a modest and normal thief, a scarlet crusade member like a scarlet crusade member, a rice peasant like a rice peasant), it's the complete opposite.

They have big mana issues but don’t let that stop you trying it. They can be viable damage wise just need lots of consumables.

Ah but further down the road there is a tailor set (without set bonus so just the name) called shadoweave, its had shadow damage on their items.

It can be crafted by a tailor.

Gloves,mask,pants,robe,and shoulders.
---
At Total of 114 more shadow dmg.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shadoweave_collection
---
As far as i know this is the only option at some lower levels to get shadow damage and easy to craft.
---
No, there is no shortcut rule of thumb other than “get to yellow hit cap ASAP”, after you’ve hit the soft cap you’re going to have to use a spreadsheet or some math (that a spreadsheet can do for you) to figure out your optimal gear.  The value of AP, hit, crit, etc. will vary dramatically depending on your gear, consumables, raid buffs and debuffs, etc.

I also need gold. My gold is more important than your BOP upgrade. So just need everything, ok?
---
Greed is gold, need is equip. It doesn't matter how much the item is worth. The gold is always worth more for you than the upgrade of some random. But this is not how you do stuff. If you do so, then do it for all. And let me roll away your stuff so I can sell it. The amount of gold does not matter at all.
---
I AOE grinded the spiders in dustwallow near that cave in the north west area. They drop a stackable item that's worth around 10s a piece. I'm not sure how efficient it really is, but I was only short 6 or 7g so I wasn't too concerned.

Yeah but that's not what matters, the question was in regard to people who do it and why. If someone wants to run a group and make reserved items, people are free to join or not.

"Just earn gold"
---
So you dont accept their group invite because you seem them as getting free rewards. I see. Cause quest mobs are so often buried behind an hour of trash you clear entirely yourself.
---
Only reason not to accept the invite is to be a prick. Your responses only solidify this. There is no time to talk when a mob is tagged. Anyone with even a semblance of an IQ higher than a stone would know what the group invite is for

This doesn’t really matter in raids, other than that high RNG burst potential might make you have to hold back for fear of pulling aggro.  Otherwise, if you’ve got 25 people DPSing, one individual’s variance isn’t going to skew the whole raid’s damage much at all, and the entire raid’s DPS is almost never going to vary dramatically (more than 10%) as a result of RNG, though of course it will due to factors other than RNG.  And dungeons are so ludicrously easy that it’s not worth worrying about/considering, IMO.
---
All of that being said, yes, the fact that high RNG can lead to accidentally pulling aggro more easily is definitely a strike against builds with higher RNG, but it’s one small consideration among many.
---
Still doesn't look as dumb as a Tauren with headgear turned on. 
---
Look like a shitty straight-to-vhs movie minion of the big bad.
---
Kits these days, always staring at a screen!
---
This wasn’t obvious?
---
Why are people acting like it wasn't exactly the same in Vanilla?
---
Because... it was, the only difference is there's more people per server, the exact same things still happened.
---
Achievements are literally useless and have no impact in the Retail version of WoW, aside from unlocking cosmetics or serving as an extra, bullshit criteria for peeps who wanna do hardcore raids but only with people who have cleaned it 100 times first.  
---
Not to be rude, but really, just give up on that idea. Nobody will bother making an add-on that no one will install.
---
And what did It cost ?
---
I been grinding mobs from level 22-47 so far and have seen 1 blue nvm an epic. feelsbadman
---
Just do it ... little cannibal 😁
---
Happy to help!
---
I dont think I've seen a single balance druid in this game yet, I was also interested in trying it, but I haven't gotten around to collecting an int set of gear yet
---
Mithril is expensive on some servers. That Mithril Order questline is so slow.
---
&gt;They want that piece of loot, people who don't want it join 
---
Stop being so edgy man
---
What are you using to simulate damage other than spreadsheets?  Not suggesting those programs don’t exist, I just haven’t seen anything like that for classic yet and would get a lot of use out of something like Rawr that was made for classic.
---
Yeah I keep being told that but always forget to use it - I’ll have to make a conscious effort next time I’m playing
---
Are there any Strip Tauren in the game? Asking for a friend.
---
No, I wouldn't say it's rp friendly unless you can come up with an IC reason why your character would be called that.

You ruined the joke.

Real advice: quit your guild, join pugs and beat up the meters. You want slow gearing progress, you got it. Entrust it to dicerolls Nd have dynamic group progress every week.
---
Jesus that warrior really is a complete coward.
---
Pretty much yeah. I think it is 55 mana for R1 and 155 for R2 or R3 (which ever I have).
---
Honestly, as a prot warrior, you should focus on dungeons and exp. No, you won't get your mount at 40 most likely, but after 20h spent levelling instead of grinding, you will get your mount on 45 instead of 40 - with the same time spent. 
---
Gold rewards from quests and grinding increase dramatically in the 40s
---
Calling out oppression isnt nice towards the oppressing party.
---
even before loot was made personal, they made a change that need makes items BoP, making it even less a retail mindset. It is a vanilla mindset through and through. It is player protection against ninja looting.

And yet I am ridiculously jealous of your gear. You've got deep earth spaulders, which won't drop for us. Malistar's, which I've lost twice on. And you're wearing enough other mail gear that it's safe to sacrifice some armor for the crimson felt hat.
---
Buy it from enchanters, but dont bother at level 22, its rather expensive.
---
What glow do u want? Assuming u have spotted one that caught ur attention, like what color was it
---
Yeeeeup
---
How much do enchants cost? And how does it work? Once you buy it you equip it on a sword and if you use a new weapon you need to get another enchant?
---
Everyone roll greed
---
Yep. Hate to ignore a marked mob, but healers are gonna be my priority to burn down before basically anything.
---
U need to search for a enchanter and trade the item in the nontradable box and probably tip him a little
---
Saw red? How does it work is it boe like items? On a sword when you use IT? How much does it cost
---
You look that he equips the item. What guarantee do I have that you actually use the BOP item you need and not just sell after the dungeon? You guys really make yourself so much angst getting ninja looted. Maybe just play the loot system like it’s supposed to be and move on?
---
AH = auction house
---
This is incorrect.
---
Glancing blows will always happen against bosses.  You change how much damage reduction the glancing blow is with a higher skill.
---
Kindly keep this virtue signalling pseudo equality bullshit out of the game please. This isn't pornhub. Kids don't need to know what makes someone gay. Miss me with this, "when two people of the same gender love each other" horseshit. Your son gona just say, daddy i love my brother, does that make me gay?
---
The whole point of being homosexual is fuckin someone of the same sex.
---
Kids don't need to learn about that. Go cry about it in your toilet or something
---
Is it once per item? And how much does it usually cost you say?
---
Might look ridiculous but ya do big dick damage sir!
---
Having the way how you have sex being the base of your culture is still lame.
---
Red is beastslaying enchant, not expensive at all it works on whatever weapon you want, you initiate trade with the enchanter then put the weapon u want enchanted in the ”will not be trader window” the very bottom one he enchants it, it will say enchant beastslaying or something similar on the weapon
---
Does anyone know an add-on that would display the location of the treasure chests near you  on the mini-map 
---
?
---
Interesting points; however, we need to go down the rabbit hole a little further. Since Blizzard makes point not only to celebrate “Pride” month but has Overwatch characters that are LGBQ, shouldn’t Blizzard ban itself? Because by celebrating “Pride” month and creating LGBQ characters means that they have taken a political stance. Only losers live a life of do what I say not as I do.  Also, if I remember correctly those characters that are LGBQ in the western version of the game aren’t LGBQ in the Chinese version of the game. 
---
When you create a character in a book, movie, or game and you weave something such as LGBQ or something similar into the lore of characters you have created you have taken a direct political stance. BioWare in several of its games put into  the story the ability to choose to be either straight or LGBQ, it wasn’t a decision the BioWare made a character to be either or; however, it was the player that made up that part of the storyline. In other words you got to choose what type of politics that you wanted in your game.
---
don't bother discussing with people like that. They twist and turn your words around and weasel an argument through to make yours seem ridiculous. They don't realize that there is a huge difference between rolling one time for an item that is worth hundreds of gold and rolling hundreds of times for items that are worth 1g each. And they don't realize the difference between selling something on the AH where someone will buy and use the item, and selling the item at the vendor where it's gone. For players in the group it doesn't make a difference who gets to use that item. I don't care if that warrior in my group wants to use it, or if a warrior who pays 300g in the AH gets to use it. Quite honestly, I'd rather the warrior paying the gold gets it because he clearly wants to use that item so badly that he is willing to sacrifice so much gold for it and isn't just there when it drops and didn't really plan on using it but might as well because it dropped.
---
Don't bother discussing with people who twist your words around and need to go to extreme examples to make a point. They are not worth your time.

What about the undead troll boss?

Super good write up btw!

VERY IMPORTANT DO NOT MAKE HIM RUSH LET HIM ENJOY THE GAME AT HIS OWN PACE
---
you have issues my friend. I am min maxing stats in a video game. to insult someone for that shows a pathetic lack of self-respect.
---
dude im so freaking mad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Nope it only goes up but stops at 50
---
Why not just ignore them
---
There should be a lfg or lookingforgroup channel to /join. 
---
Try that out. Normally it’s full of chats with pugs. May not be a bad idea to join a guild as well
---
I main undead. So I understand your sentiment. But look at Artemis there and tell me he isn't DYING to have a gnome mage named after him. Those squinty eyes, that curious smile... the boy was born to be a gnome mage.
---
Now, as a proud undead priest, I too once believed only bitches played alliance. But then I saw Artemis. And Artemis is no bitch.
---
Ohhhhhh 😍 that immediately gave me goosebumps
---
On today episode of Brokeback Booty Bay...
---
gnome mages are the worst creatures ive encountered on this game. if he has an attitude he should definitely play one
---
What one? Mine has a raid of some sort once a week at least, and I play maybe 3 hours a day at most.
---
This is raid BiS (boss fights in particular) for fury warriors until like Nax/AQ40. This item alone boosts a warrior's DPS by like 10%.
---
lol, what you're doing is styling on leveling players because you can't min-max at maximum level as all other hardcore min-maxers do.
---
You're not twinking for pve, you're twinking for pvp. And there is no fair pvp's when one is "min-maxing" and others are in white leveling gear and you queue with them ON PURPOSE.
---
Well then, now we simply must know! Is Artemis alliance or horde?
---
If you think that China's regime isn't based on capitalism, and that the single thing completely in common between all those corporate entities is not their capitalistic values of unstoppable growth regardless of ethical cost you're only kidding yourself.

Just because China has the word communist slapped on its propaganda, does not mean that the state of the country is not a product of capitalism.

some people really are uncultured and have the worst eating habit. simply buying grated cheese says a lot about what kind of human you are, never raise kids please
---
I generally ask in my guild first to see if I can find a group there. Then I ask in city trade channel.  There's usually a lot of people spamming for instances there.   Last result would be to go to the instance and wait outside and ask for people there.   I usually find the people I need in city chat.
---
What were Olympics then? There's plenty of examples there.
---
You can absolutely use this opportunity to oppose the oppression. Many times at severe consequence to yourself but those brave enough, make the risk. This isn't expressing some minor or controversial statement. People of HK are fighting for their rights and they get no support from outside because no one dares to oppose China.
---
Perfect timing
---
It was actually formed before WOTLK, but if you look at it, Ulduar was the last patch already started in the development cycle when the transaction happened.
---
But you can’t use “faster than a boe epic ever drops” because the situation we are talking about is... rolling on a boe epic. Lol. Because they are so rare is why everyone gets a shot at the money. No warrior is in zf at 47 exclusively farming to get edgemasters hands, it was just an awesome random bonus. And “whatever arbitrary value” can be more than 20 hours of farming!
---
Do people make guilds to level and do instances rather than playing solo because that would be great.
---
So I type /join lfg or lookingforgroup ?
---
Thank you sir.
---
I've been seeing this a lot lately. Is it still a good spec if you run with a healer 100% of the time? Or should I just stick to an almost complete feral spec if I have my pocket healer?
---
There are ways..for eng to make money
---
Utter bullshit about vsync. Only if you are getting tearing it will smoothen it.

About to turn 52 as a NE Priest. Shadow at the moment but tempted to go Holy and heal dungeons to level 60 to get my BiS. However at 60 I would struggle to do quests such as in EPL to get gear. What do?
---
"No leveling, just crabing" fixed it for you
---
he told me he was trying to charge the mob lol
---
This is how you do. Press enter to get chatwindow up. And type in: /join LookingForGroup.  Now  you have joined  the  group  channel.  In that channel  you can write: 25 Mage  LFG  Stockades.  Or you can type: LFM Stockades need all. And people who wanna do dungeons will whisper you. 
---
Get addons.  Atlasloot to see what instances you can do around your level and what gear bosses drop.  
---
And Questie,  it will show you available quests in the world.
---
LFG: Looking for group 
---
LFM: Looking for more
---
Not honored. Friendly.
---
Fuuuck, Yea what can you do. Maybe hide head and cloak and put a tabard over that... But still
---
I guess it's not as attractive if your wife is a priest ;)
---
Pre 30s there are enough guns available from quests and vendors that I didn't notice a lack of them. Once you can get the Nessingwary quest line just group with one or two others to push through the hunt and you have a gun that I'm still using mid 40s. There are less guns, sure, though it does make them feel more like your weapon vs just another weapon. :)
---
You will have problems unceasing until you learn to stop forcing yourself to be in a certain way. You are incapable of dealing with life otherwise.

You are better off never seeing what they post anyway

Dont blindly believe anyone. Do the math yourself and you'll see OP is right.
---
I went back to retail for a hot minute and while I was killing a mob right next to a treasure chest I had cleared my way to - someone flew in, dismounted, ninjaed the chest and flew away again, I was still fighting the thing! I logged out right after

---
The only reason I am doing strth live is for the orbs. So I will take the orbs as a tank and as a fair trade you have a tank to do your dungeon and get your gear.
---
I dont understand DPS reserving things. They will never find a tank or healer.
---
Why you giving them ideas??I would quit if they add game shop and they very well might
---
Transmorgs.

Dude you look ducking ridiculous

And very poor if switching weapon every 4 lvls :)

I think the point is that you don't get to decide that for them

Have you considered actually just playing the game?

You will most likely use a bow anyway thus using LBRS gauntlets.

Well obviously you cant level up without getting gold

I remember doing a pass through there and seeing nothing, figured it was an empty zone.

You just answered my next question ;0.

This is vanilla thing. It was changed in Cataclysm.

Id my guildies/groups get into pvp i feel obliged to help  unless they tell me they going for 1v1.You never know when you gonna need their help against gankers
---
Thats not how it works. I got a full level at 15 from a lv 60 pulling me and 2 friends through rfc.
---
I believe you can easily get to 100g at 40. Sell EVERY white or better item on the AH. You will be surprised of the cost of some white items. I got to around 140g by playing normally and doing this (also had skining profession and sold that)
---
What add-on is he using for his own healthbar, I hate the default one and would like that. Is it linked to the ability bar, instead of say bartender4
---
+1 A man who understands why I'm there too.
---
Yes, indeed. You click trade with the enchanter and becareful to put your item to be enchanted on the "Item will not be traded" spot, in the bottom of the window. Then check what enchant you are actually getting by hovering over your weapon before confirming the trade. 
---
In my experience people haven't been trying to scam and are rather nice in classic, but it never hurts to be extra sure.
---
Yep or when he has classic alliance 3v1
---
Ribbly has a chance to drop a unique BoP 16 slot bag. Not very high chance though so not really worth going there for that purpose unless you are passing by anyway.
---
What's the math on why Edgemasters are so good despite seeming rather trash?

Yeah, not how it works. The xp is great even after the stealth nerf / fix

I let my brother attack a guy because it was unfair if I would join. He died and removed me from friend list :D I always respect 1v1 no matter what.

You get penalty in wow classic , i have tried this. If tue booster is or even is not in your party and the mobs are gray to him you get massive penalty on xp recieved
---
You can download the addon puggle to help with LFG, it lists the messages posted in /LFG /LookingForGroup sorted by instance
---
Yes but not much. Its still faster than leveling solo or doing the dungeon normally.
---
With TBC the penality is a lot higher.
---
That's why we have all the virtue signalling going on.

From The Blizzard Policy:
---
Examples of common unacceptable or disruptive RP names include (but are not limited to):
---
Non-medieval or non-fantasy names (For example: Slipnslide, Robotman, Technotron)
---
Names that reference well known people, characters, brands, places, or icons (For example: Britneyspears, Austinpowers, Mcdonalds, Georgewashington, Newyork)
---
Names that consist of multiple words (For example: Inyourface, Welovebeef, Howareyou, Sixtyseventy)

short for madeline grimm, after being betrayed by my own people and my entire family being slaughtered by the higher class of the alliance, I sought out the lich king to hopefully bring them back. Oh, was I foolish. The Lich desecrated my spirit and forsaken I became, Bending to his will. After many years of enslavement, I found myself being able of free thought. Ner’zhul’s grasp was beginning to weaken. After being liberated by the Dark Lady of the Lich King’s reign, and free will was brought to Lordaeron. I started to feel this immense hatred for humans once again, remembering what had happened to my family. I began to plot my revenge on the upper class of stormwind. From today, I forge my own destiny, and from now on will be known as Mad Grimm. All humans will know my name, and they will all feel my wrath. You will feel the pain that I have felt. This I swear upon the Grimm Family name. Vengeance is just the beginning, I won’t be satisfied until I see their world burn. (undead female rogue that will KoS all humans xD)

This actually happened to my friend the other day in Mauradon. It wasn't an excuse either, his daughter was born later that night.

Skinning is definitely not a waste of time.  I had a huge, long reply all typed up to your post that included double gathering professions, but I figured I was meandering too much so I deleted that part of it.  Skinning/mining or skinning/herbing are great combinations and good for making money.  Vendor skins up until thick leather (then you AH them) for extra gold.  I don't recommend you do herbing/mining together because you can only track one at a time on your mini map.  
---
I did skinning and herbing up to 40, then dropped skinning for alchemy.  I don't regret it, but I miss skinning and the opportunity it presents for devilsaur leather etc.
---
Who's the tank?

&gt; but the healer is spamming max rank Flash Heals for no reason

That sounds rather inconvenient

Regardless of level, which is meaningless in this situation, you were bullying and camping weaker players. 
---
I get it, you're a bully. No need to give further proofs about it. Stop it, get some help.
---
Nelf Hunter is great for PvP server QoL levelling.
---
Dwarf is best for PvP hands down, as their Racial is insanely good. Stoneform is like having a slightlly less powerful version of Cloak Of Shadows on your Dwarf Rogue in Vanilla or Cloak Of Shadows on your Dwarf Hunter.
---
No I meant like you having no clue how the game mechanics work. Like not knowing the player has to actually loot the corpse first before being able to skin lol.
---
You’re prostituting yourself off for cheeseburgers again, aren’t you?
---
All of the best arguments against it are for you pvpers. There's a whole lot of other people who don't give a crap about pvp. Restrict it to PvE or RP only servers and then those who want it can play there.
---
nice name forsenJoy
---
Crimson hat, Edward odd, wildthorn Mail, rag shield, deep earth paulders, the draconian blue gloves I think : hilarious and awesome I recognize your entire set! Ele for life bro very gj on gearing. Especially the t2 pants
---
Thanks for the input, if I was ran with a friend who is also my level, would our exp be split in half like normal?
---
This also only applies at 60 with max weapon skill
---
Let’s talk about the more pressing issue, how can you play in windowed mode?
---
Turn off function came with 2 NPCs: Human rogue Bestin and Forsaken rogue Slotz. Activating it costed a little gold, but ironically it had put you into separate queue, eventually destroying twinking for good. Let's admit it, guys who twink want to dominate with least effort possible or they would continue to play separate queues.

Uh oh, someone tell that to The Guild of St Augustine on Deviate Delight! ;)

Is the Holy/Prot Hybrid talent choices on [icy veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/holy-paladin-healer-pve-spec-builds-talents) good to follow for leveling on a PvE server? I plan to tank and heal dungeons on the way to 60, not looking to do any DPS.
---
Do the shadow/flame/ice reflector trinkets from engineering share cooldowns?
---
The game didn't die the first time around, and it definitely isn't dieing this time either
---
You were the asshole by threatening to call a need  roller a ninja.
---
That's not German.
---
I would only enchant wing blade or outlaw sabre, sword of omen, vanquisher sword, and then thrash blade. These were the main weapons I used
---
I can't remember any MC balance changes outside of revamped loot. But the raid was "nerfed" in the sense that talents &amp; itemization changes massively altered how the fights operated. A raid encounter going from 5-10 minutes to 1-3 minutes is a completely different fight. I remember my Rag kills back in vanilla taking several submerges; now he dies before a single submerge.
---
I mean that's at least fair. I would not like to see discrimination but if it's equally done I am fine.
---
I wish I knew that before I rolled mage. I just remember it being a class I always wanted to try back in the day so i figured I'd give it a shot.  But as much as the meme gets thrown around I've seen maybe 1 or 2 that I can remember that fit the meme.
---
We need another player to suicide his rep and say some obligatory pro China shit. Then watch blizzard fidget
---
Did the same as you. Played enough to hit 60 and down Rag last Sunday. Have poured thousands of hours over the years into retail WoW, the Diablos, Overwatch, HS and HotS. Read the news and haven't logged on since. I pay for gametime in advance rather than sub so I have nothing to cancel and no reason to give Blizzard. After the "apology" today I think I'm set on just deleting the whole account.
---
No it’s not. You can check the exp in the combat log. Group bonus was like +5? Even without the full group the exp would be very good
---
We'll see. I think that it's mostly the investors that expect big profits. Personally, i really hope it will flop.
---
Which type of ranged weapon you use doesn't matter as a NE.  The slower the weapon the better for hunter for a few reasons.  1 reason is that your abilities like multi-shot and aimed shot will hit much harder with a slow weapon.  Also, slower weapons do the same damage (or more) but consume much less ammunition.  The precisely calibrated boomstick has a 1.4 sec speed, which means it would use twice as much ammo as a weapon with a 2.8 sec speed.  Next, if you're weaving your abilities between auto shots (like you should) if you have a weapon faster than 2.1 you can't weave auto shot in without clipping.  Aimed shot is a  3 second cast, you can't aim shot without clipping unless your weapon speed is slower than 3.  As I understand it, that's why the end-game crossbows are so good for your pre-raid BiS, because they're slower than 3 seconds.
---
Nooooo

True dedication means you grind it by doing dire maul shakle key runs.

Well yeah, it comes back don't it.

I assume you talk about wolfshead? That's not BiS for tanks, not even close.
---
Leveling speed really doesn't get impacted very much by professions as a druid
---
That was fantastic. A+
---
I too like to make generalisations about people I don't know based on arbitrary criteria. What class do you play? I'd like to have a go.
---
In addition to the other tips here, put a hold on leveling your smithing.  35G at 34 is pretty good.  I think I had 12g at that time.  I had to go pretty far out of my way to pull the gold together, but I did manage to have about 102g at 40.  Also keep in mind that you only need 90g as long as you're honored with your home faction.
---
He's still initiating the sequence,  and moving his mouse. The only thing it's doing is counting one button press as 2. You could set something like this up with built in functionality that most razer keyboards have and a lot of corsair ones do too. It's soooo far from botting

The value of an item is subjective. I could do with 5g from a bop weapon when I've zero gold and need to repair, so I need it. Blizzard have already implemented a need greed system, but people are complicating it with value of items, avoiding ninjas amongst other  reasons that I have not encountered since classic was released and I have played since 2005
---
Lmao
---
Nice editing at 0:43 bro.
---
IDK he threw out the only one able to resist his psychic scream. He could at least try fearing 2 of em out if fear makes enemy walk out of the boat, then try to deal with the remaining Horde.
---
Your problem was you healed the mage. Lesson learnt!
---
quit it
---
fuck.
---
Horde players are cowards.
---
I'd say thanks for the contribution to my question/ discussion but you didn't contribute at all; just flung shit over the internet for no reason.
---
It's 2019 and there are still clickers around...
---
Found the Bills fan
---
I'm gaining 5g from vendoring a weapon, what's the problem if loot rules arent stated beforehand?
---
yea sure, thats what a bitch would say
---
10 min tops, just going to drop her off...
---
Damn, their loss huh?
---
&gt; The main kicker was that layering didn't really solve the queue times they were designed to solve, but I'm content.
---
Layering reduced queue times. Think what they would have been without it.
---
We now know layering was a huge success, and you people were all a bunch of Chicken Littles screaming the sky was falling.
---
Yeah if you got two matching items as fury something has gone wrong. Also if your color scheme is remotely close you lose 25% dps.
---
It may feel more authentic but it isn't, it's just as easy to take a phone picture of an edited screenshot
---
Mate boes are equivalent to gold because of trading. You could literally go to the ah and buy/sell one. Everyone needing on gold makes perfect sense.
---
Maybe he's an orc transgender you may never know
---
Ty
---
Lmao calm down mate
---
&gt; You’ve been playing with the wrong Druids tho, just saying.
---
No, I've just been playing with the right warriors.  Of the 3 in my guild that do most of the tanking, there's 1 bear.  I assure you, most situations, the warriors are far easier to heal.
---
A bear just takes a lot more work to be on par with the warrior.  I'm sure an exceptional bear is perfectly suitable for any content, but a war putting in equal effort is almost always going to be easier to heal in a raid or a dungeon.
---
U furious and projecting bro?
---
How is Earthfury population wise? My server can transfer there but my friends think the server pop would be too low even if my server sucks in terms of faction balance.
---
What's your problem here? People feel accomplishment when they level up because it's a grind, unlike retail 5 lvls per dungeon.
---
So therefore they like to express a bit of happiness, relief that they are one level closer to that sweet mount/new ability/gear/60.
---
If you don't want to be involved in that and would like to be a prick about it, carry on but do us a favour and segregate yourself.
---
I never said that isn't the case. I gave a rough guesstimate like I said, this is fairly valid for a prebis rogue which is where people are right now. If you want to go deep into theorycrafting to know the exact conversion rates for your specific gear/buff situation then you can do that.
---

Thanks for the advice! How long do you usually sell them? 8 hours or longer? Cuz sometimes the fee is almost half of the price
---
Im a priest tho
---
Bye Felicia!
---
Thanks!

There were 2 versions of it in vanilla (it got buffed at some point). The first version was only okay—some pieces were equal to MC gear but some were worse. The second version was better than MC gear.
---
That hunter must feel pretty stupid once he realizes that Peacemaker is way better than those and that dire maul is coming soon and barbarous blade is even better. Then again hunters never lost the huntard status
---
Classic will be hit by a heavy reduction in the playerbase very soon anyway. Wait until honor system release with no bgs for months. This will filter the playerbase hard. Most of the casual try outs will leave in this phase. Basically all slow casual gamers will leave because it will be impossible for them to grind their 5th char to lvl 25 while makeing reddit posts about it. Twinking will be dead for months. After that we will see the final population and fraction balance on all the realms, when the dust has settled and the great filter did his work.
---
You have archivist cape one of the hardest prebis items to get on there, with no mention, and then think you need luck for freezing band? Just buy it. The cloak on the other hand.. Yeah goodluck.
---
Edwin VanDarkholme
---
This is why you're supposed to be using ranged tk tag them
---
Exactly. I had enough gold to buy mine and a friends mount at 40 just by questing, leveling my herbalism and the occasional dungeons for quests.
---
1) always go deep into the ships hull when it's cross faction
---
2) be a paladin to bubble that shit off
---
You can enter but you will do basically no damage to at level 53
---
SAVAGE (BTW what addons do u use ?)
---
Most epics in the game are worthless vendor trash, though.
---
Its almost 1k lol "Just buy it"
---
Jeezz man it is awesome!
---
No blizzard is not toying around with droprates to annoy people...
---
As for your case. With all the prebis items you need to get, and all the players who need to get them, the chances of some people getting awful luck on one of the items is statistically very high.
---
Yes, they sell for 1.5 to 2g on my server. You get about 6 per run. So a good g/hour
---
Now...sashay away
---
I did this in wrath. From memory i did quite well.
---
I was easily honoured from memory. Most quests are ironforge rep.
---
&gt;I look fucking ~~ridiculous~~ fabulous.
---
I had all of this on launch week on my main. It's just going to happen in general and bad moments stand out more, but there are more good players than bad.
---
Reddit is partially owned by Tencent yet you still post on it. If you really wanna take moral high ground ditch Apple, American airlines, Audi, Disney, ESPN, Delta, GAP, Marriott Hotels, Mercedes, the NBA, Nike, Ray-Ban, Tik-Tok, Vans, Viacom (which is the mother company of TONS of media outlets), among many others. 
---
Many people wanna just shame other people and virtue signal how great they are. 
---
Not saying I agree with what these companies have done but I doubt the majority of people on here are gonna throw their iPhones in the garbage, stop watching disney owned content, drive their car into the ocean, buy new shoes because they wear Vans, change ISP because Viacom owns their current one, ditch their sunglasses and try to find alternatives to almost every consumer product. 
---
This list is only the companies censoring btw, there are many others financially dependent on China and would throw free speech in the garbage at first signs of a dent in profit. 
---
Get off your high horse while posting on a Chinese owned website/app
---
Been looking into solo princess. I’m a holy priest, doubt I can pull it off. I’m especially unsure about the Terror debuff. Anyway thanks for the tip.
---
Your answer is blowing my mind.
---
Do you happen to play on Deviate Delight, horde and this happened while LFG SM?
---
When I started it at 58 I felt the same way. Then I was 59 with hardly anything left.
---
+5 to ranged weapon skills is not nearly as impactful as +5 to melee. It mostly translates to a little bit of hit and crit (&lt;1%) because ranged hits can't be dodged and can't be glancing blows.
---
Aww, on national coming out day even. You do you buddy, ignore all the haters
---
I felt like a dick the other day, but I just couldn't take it.
---
A guy in the zerg guild I had joined ask if anyone wanted to do WC. I was a 22 priest and he was 23 warlock. Great, I joined up. Then another level 22 joined. Great, should be cake. Then he invited a level 16. I don't want to be a dick, so I keep quiet. Sadly another DPS who was 25 wanted to come but was turned away because we were full. Then for almost an hour we are waiting for a tank. Finally get one. A level 16 warrior. Not happy, but I don't want to be a dick and I keep my mouth shut.
---
Despite having a warlock already at the instance to summon us and the tank literally being a 3 minute walk away, he takes another 20 minutes to show up, having continued questing. I don't think he knows where he is going, he takes us on this big lap in the cave before the portal and makes us kill everything. Once inside he's moving in odd directions and back tracking a lot.
---
He also can't hold aggro. At all. Using a 2H he can't hold aggro. Using a sword and board he tells us to let him wail on the mobs for a while to train his 1H... He also had two grey and a white piece of gear from the starting area. The 16 DPS has 2 white pieces.
---
The DPS are being very nice about it, but he literally can't hold aggro on an imp pet on his main target. Every fight I'm the healer and an off tank because he can't hold aggro on my renew ticks (applied as late as possible for him to build aggro). 
---
So having waited more than an hour to start, this group takes almost an hour to reach the first boss in the west side. After he's down I say sorry this is taking too long, I don't think this group will finish within four hours from now or if at all, and bail.
---
Please wait until you are an appropriate level before joining instances.
---
I prefer the feel of longer fingernails on a key board
---
Give it a rest, christ
---
I was on the rock elemental quest and at any point there were no fewer than 8 people either on the same quest of farming them. If you are gonna farm these you’re best off doing it in the early hours of the morning. Alternatively, find a load of mobs that aren’t tied to a quest.
---
Lmao!
---
So the emperor at the end of BRD enrages and becomes immune to all spell damage, so I was wondering if there are other end games dungeons/raid bosses with the same mechanic?
---
If you've bought 2-3 points in improved frostbolt you're doing about the same damage spamming that on one target as you are using blizzard on it, but instead only using roughly 2/3 of the mana.
---
Even if you haven't got improved frostbolt that's still (at my level) 232 damage over 9.2 seconds for 200 mana vs 200 damage over 8 seconds for 320 mana.
---
There's no way it's better to use blizzard on a single target unless you just can't be bothered changing your rotation :P
---
Zug Zug, by ZUG. A Zug Zug brand.
---
What are you gonna do? Kill random lowlvl mobs for a 0.02% rate?
---
Just farm 1k gold it only takes 20 hours as a mage, that's half of what it'll take to farm the cloak FYI.
---
It’s an option in the stock interface somewhere.
---
As a priest, regardless of whether you're healing or solo levelling spirit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;int
---
More spirit means you benefit from spirit tap more, which allows you to kill faster and level more consistently.
---
End of.
---
Great work guys, this might totally be the problem.
---
I did encounter these weird pulls, too.
---
It‘ld be interesting to find out if this is working as intended.
---
I hope this gets Blizz‘ attention.
---
Well this is my goal now
---
Seemed cringe to me
---
Seriously.  You could farm the cloak and by the time it drops have the dosh for the ring.  
---
Don’t know why you’d bother.  Is it that huge of an upgrade compared to the second best?
---
Nope, OP doesn’t know what he’s talking about. 1% crit is TWICE as valuable as 1% hit.
---
Could've taken a better photo of your adopted owner but I'll forgive you little druid
---
I would say a firm no to the Barbershop.
---
But that is my opinion on it.
---
As the #1 parsing rogue on my server with 6/8 SC and 0 raid gear, I disagree.
---
To make your yellow hits/abilities land, that is. You will still miss a lot of your white swings (because dual wielding has a 19 % additional chance to miss) which account for ~60 % of your damage in raids, so more hit% is definitely recommended.
---
That indeed is a way to plug your art that isnt relevant to WoW on a WoW themed board.
---
Toy Story
---
Gear is gear. But call me moron all you want. Better than a ninja looter.
---
Farming for 3 days just because you feel like you need a mount as soon as you hit 40 feels a bit unnecessary tbh
---
There are leather items that jncrease stealth level and picpocket ;P
---
I can solo princess as a SPriest by SWP and kiting her around her area using the big rocks as pylons. Unsure if a holy priest would have the damage though. I also kill the goblin bro for blues to sell.
---
Should I be running the full instance for ghost mushrooms too?
---
Lock question: I think pet pathing is different than it was in vanilla.  I've watched hunters jump into the rend area, and the brd arena, with no issues with pet aggro.  This wasn't possible in vanilla.  I could be wrong, but my theory is that it was changed.
---
Shaman question: I honestly can't answer the spellpower part.  I think the answer is no but I would need to verify.  
---
The totem answer is a bit more obvious.  It's kind of both.  A totem will have its own aggro.  This is very obvious with something like searing.  If your searing hits something you don't have threat on, the enemy will destroy your totem.  It will then aggro you because it's your totem.  It destroyed the totem because of the totems aggro, but this also put you into combat, giving you the bare minimum threat.  However, now that you're in combat, any other threat producing action such as healing will now be transferred to the enemy. 
---
I said both above, because if you are in combat, resource gain will generate threat for you.  I have a really strange anecdote on this point.  One time I was able to drink very close to being put into combat.  I think spell batching allowed the in combat trigger, and my drinking trigger to happen simultaneously.  I gained resources (mana regen) in combat, so generate threat, and had enemies attack me for doing nothing but drinking.  The same thing can happen with healing or mana stream totem.  You are gaining resources in combat, which are transferred to threat on the target.  It's not a lot, but sometimes it doesn't take a lot.
---
Somewhere in the middle, and I don't really fully understand this, is buffing totems.  It especially seems to happen with wf.  Sometimes, despite a player (generally the tank) having far more threat, enemies will randomly walk over and kill a wf totem.  I don't personally remember this happening in vanilla, and I don't know why it's happening now.  It doesn't seem to respect the threat tables, and seems to be some independent built in logic instructing them to do so.
---
Congratulations! I too hope to one day achieve this level of valor!
---
I'm not a scientist but I think deep down we all already knew this. Why the hell is the game so addicting. Everyone wants better loot and when that perfect BiS drops, you're brain must explode with dopamine. Until you roll a 1.
---
I have never not seen those elementals camped to hell and back, and being quest mobs it’s even worse.
---
It is. One simply can - or rather shouldn't - compare this to the premium Statues for USD 350. It's some kind of plastic, pretty stable painted acceptable. I got it, too and it's roughly half the size and a 10th of the quality of my sylvanas statue.
---
what a casual
---
Bullshit
---
We will rise!
---
Lots of low levels these days so we will be fine. lots of 60's as well
---
Indeed. Spent far longer looking for a liferoot in Swamp of Sorrows than I care to admit.
---
There is untapped potential for jojo memes in the subreddit
---
It's really not that complicated.
---
BoP need&gt;greed                       
---
BoE low value need&gt;greed, no one cares and most go to full greed anyway                 
---
BoE high value all need
---
The reasoning is that you can't get BoP from any other source than the boss that drops. Most people agree that the stat upgrade is worth more than the 2g it vendors for. It's also against everyone's interests to all need BoPs as it will make it harder for everyone to get theirs - vendoring the item essentially deletes it from the game.
---
For high value (good upgrades/bis) BoEs, selling it to another player for gold is not making it harder on anyone to get their, you're just trading time (gold) for the item. It also removes the need for trust among random people. 
---
This only really applies to a select few items. The gun, freezing band, edgemaster's, the lock ring, maiden's circle, krol blade, deep wood, flurry. Some patterns and formulas. I think that's about it, might have forgotten a couple. 
---
It's really not that complicated and objectively the better way to handle it as opposed to trusting random people.
---
This happened to me a few days ago. No one in the group needed them so we could hear the sound of a thousand warriors and rogues crying as we vendored/DE'd them
---
Yeah I found that too as a60 rogue the bar would resist atleast twice every single run so I gave up and went back to arcane crystals farming lol
---
Is it BoE? I don't care as long as everyone needs. Is it BoP? Good luck getting your BoP upgrades when 4 other people are needing on it to vendor.
---
If the item is available for purchase, and you're unwilling to spend the gold to get it, you don't really need it.
---
every priest can do it regardless of specc/gear. Shadow definitely helps though.
---
would never sink that low
---
And the warriors will say the same when freezing band drops. Seems fair to me.
---
Cash in on your newfound fame man, sell in-game autographs by just typing your name on a letter and sending it COD for 1G
---
I'm looking to make an a gold farming alt and I'm between a mage and hunter. Which one will be easier to farm dire maul on?
---
The difference is that 5g is a negligible amount in relation to the economy.
---
You shouldn’t go for hit after soft cap. White hit is 45-55% of your DPS, so 1% hit should only be around a .6% increase to dps (adjusted for windfury). Less for alliance. Meanwhile, crit affects every source of damage with a bonus multiplier for SS, making it worth around a 1.2% increase, around twice as valuable as hit.
---
You’re misinformed about hit affecting your crit chance. It doesn’t. I’m sure you’re referring to crit cap, which is 38% before ANY gear.
---
? Unfair functionality def exists . It alerts me of players i would have never seen otherwise . Druid/rogue stealthing within like 30-40 yards or even more ,boom you know they are there.You would never spotted them otherwise
---
Kokosnoten zijn geen specerijen, frikandelbroodjes etc etc

And he will with that spec.
---
I try to keep the center as clear as possible. I used to have the frames and weakauras a little lower, giving me more vision, but I realized i liked it a little closer so I could see the indicators better. I'm probably going to move my party frames, as right now, they are only in that position for playing my healer.
---
When he says f all he means like 10 a pop.

When you and your family are going to be stomped on you’re going to wish that the rest of world will take any chance they get to speak up and come to your aid. That they would leave their comfort zone and step out in the fire with you because it burns too hot and you need help.
---
You’re right that it would be a mess if politics were everywhere, but maybe that’s necessary for change to happen. The conversation here shouldn’t even be about if Blizzard gets to censor this stuff or not, because the issues at hand are much bigger. Of course they get to censor whatever they want on their own show, but should they and should they be so drastic and aggressive about it especially as they’re defending the oppressors. This person talks about it very clearly if you have a few minutes to read it.

On horde side just farm shellfish in desolace. 15+ gold/h.

That’s such shit information. Hit isn’t anywhere NEAR as valuable as crit. It’s not even close.

Drakestone is the hardest by far. Don’t bother with it. There’s a guy who has done 670 runs for the shadow one, he has seen frozen wrath three times.

Nope. It happens sometime now, but after a while they show icons again.

as a tank I can relate. I love this meme.

My thoughts exactly ! Thanks !

Would you mind unsubbing to our community if you don’t play the game?
---
Are you paranoid?
---
Lowbies on WPvP, no matters the faction, just want to level up. If they are not able to lvl up, they will switch faction or server. And then, no more ganking for you or anybody.

I feel like this was only meant to come back to for like 6 months tops anyways lol

Shows how little you've kept up with meta development.  Pallies are great AoE dungeon tanks, [and with Greater Blessing of Kings they generate a ton of threat.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/righteous-fury-mechanics-op-paladin-threat-1k-tps/318279)
---
It’s still +3% hit vs lvl 63 mobs. Irrelevant for dwarves as the best endgame weapons are all bows and crossbows though.
---
Shit, you're right, the tooltip does not include the healing gained from gear. I was certain it did.
---
Lmfao, not the case at all, but okay.

I wish his spawn rate was better

I basically do affliction dots and syphon life while my succubus whips and charms if I aggro too much. Eats up some mana sure but then i dark pact and life tap til near full. Drain-tanking I believe it is called. It works very well for pve I find, not sure I'd use it in pvp.
---
It’s not broken, have probably had it drop 30% of the time with 40ish Jed kills.

Retail will have ya
---
People in my guild had it drop from him back to back yesterday.
---
I'm considering. I want to level a character to max level. I have tried for over 10 years.
---
So, I looked around and Pitbull has a lot of HP text presets, none of them just show your current HP. However, for each preset, it shows you the code and you can edit.
---
Pitbull Config --&gt; Layout editor ---&gt; Texts --&gt; Current text: Lua:Health --&gt; Choose Health: Absolute short then paste the following in the Code box.

if s then

  return s

return "%s",Short(MaxHP(unit),true)

I think ClassicDB just said it was around 2 and a half hours - if that's true, not too bad!
---
If you are a melee class, you want to hit green quests and mobs unless you have very good gear. With how melee works mobs higher level than you have a ton of advantages over you which makes them take forever to kill.
---
I need these for my warrior. He's only lvl5 but they will be an upgrade eventually.
---
There are tons of quests at your level range. You could heal dungeons as well!
---
Keep at it instead of quitting, it only gets more fun
---
Are you so sour that you have to post that everywhere you go? Like if people dont enjoy the game as much as you do, they need to be sarcastically attacked by some loser on reddit?
---
Yes you can put weights on them, obviously they depend on your gear but they are rough estimates.
---
1crit to 1.8-2% hit is ludicrous.
---
All horde boats are in neutral territory, and generally speaking as I leveled up I encountered boat pvp extremely rarely. I think most people just want to get the fuck to where they're going rather than risk having to res and potentially missing the boat.

I've done probably 99% of the quests for my level, the available ones are 45+.

STV is a war zone and is impossible to quest in. 
---
I'm tired of dungeons.

Not much more to do than grinding, and it takes so long I'm tired of that too.
---
For what I know it doesn't directly increase crit chance. It only does indirectly increase crit chance the same way you increase it when you're crit capped and that you increase hit chance instead. And in phase 1-2 there won't really be a case where it will happen because of the low stats gear.
---
Just throwing that there, can't verify now. Just that your affirmation seems wrong to me.
---
Just boosted my friend through SFK the other day, we had 3 randoms too that tagged along. 2 of them dinged from that run.
---
Cheers!
---
The devilsaur has to be looted. When you are getting tags do you have FFA on? It could be that it's on grouploot and some guy didn't notice or care to loot it.
---
Forming a group takes effort, managing a raids organization and success takes effort, raids and groups don't grow on trees with infinite supply. People that make the effort to do these things will be rewarded in the way they want by the ones who don't want to expel the same effort.
---
It's transactional in a way to be honest. In return for them doing the legwork of the group management, we're giving up rights to said item so we can join a group NOW. If there was more supply, you wouldn't think twice, you'd just go to the other group, but there's not another group..
---
The people that just sit their and complain are lost. They either don't have the competence, intelligence, or desire to start their own group while simeotaneously not assigning a value to the person that is competent, intelligent, or willing to start a group.

How bad can water taste? Sorry if I sound ignorant, but I can't imagine water tasting THAT bad, except if there's a lot of iron in it maybe? I thought the only reason people don't drink tap water was because of health reasons, which then it makes sense to buy bottled water.
---
That trinket, as well as the armor rings actually have a bigger impact on a druid tank than any other pre bis item, so it doesn't matter which slot you're talking about, even thought you specifically mentioned the helm
---
Scholo has very annoying trash, which is why people want a 60 tank. If you have a good group that can lead you around, it's very doable though.

Tips for most optimised Rogue Stunlock?
---
Atm I do:
---
Cheap Shot, Sinister Strike, Blind. 
---
Re-stealth, wait for 100 energy, cheap shot, kidney shot.

After that I tend to get 2 sinister strikes off before they break stun.

Sunken cost fallacy. If you really want to play as an orc warrior, don't consider the time you've spent on a character you don't even like.

Ask an enchanter for a beast slayer enchant it has a red glow . It’s usually pretty cheap.

How does it make you feel that probably 1% of the player base un-subbed after this whole thing and that Reddit is a very vocal minority? Why don’t you show a little “self discipline” by destroying everything in your home that was made in China? Something tells me you won’t have much left
---
How is it possible that you’ve done all the quest at your level when I’ve never ran out of quests at your level range. There is some in dustwallow marsh, tanaris, badlands, bit of feralas, arathi highlands elites, alterac mountains, swamp of sorrows etc. they are spread out but there for sure are tons of quests. 
---
Try and check what some guides say, level 42 isn’t usually a place one would find them self’s getting stuck at!

It’s not. Crit is way, way better than hit.

You go to reputation and click on booty bay. Then you have to put "at war". Now you can attack them.

He did say "after lvl 20," to be fair. Rank 1 moon fire is all you need for tags/kiting to safety, anyhow.
---
Have you played the same amount of time on both factions. Because people love to say one side is worse when they have no proof.
---
Umm... it literally sounds like retail is what fits him best. You can get off your high horse of morality now.
---
Can someone explain this to me?
---
You are roughly a bit over halfway to 60 in terms of playtime. Swapping is still viable.
---
I just haven't grinded enough. Killing mobs as a priest is tedious and unrewarding, so I've avoided it.
---
Awesome
---
He's staring at the tasty little gnomes isn't he?
---
He's on an 8 hour respawn timer, but it only sucks when you don't know how long you have left. 
---
I got him taken from me after two hours of looking, but I got on just under 8 hours later, and within five minutes he was there. Snagged him that time
---
You can also use this one to display CurrentHP | Percentage
---
local s = Status(unit)
---
local cur, max = HP(unit), MaxHP(unit)
---
return "%s || %s%%",Short(cur,true),Percent(cur,max)
---
If you can manage questing in STV, then it's probably not a problem.
---
Ahhh, that makes sense on not being mana efficient. Thanks I'm gonna respec when I get home form work and try it out tonight

---
I’d put the disarm gloves from magistrate in UD strat. Im unsure what they are called. Use that instead of a weapon chain
---
It cannot both be super important to tanks while leveling, while also providing only a small upgrade and small impact on leveling speed.  You're just arguing for the sake of arguing and/or purposely missing the point.
---
Banshees in UD stratholme are mostly immune to magic, but that's pretty much all you'll face in phase 1.
---
I'm wondering if there's a macro or cvar command to alter it on the fly. So it can just be hit with a key instead of entering the menu each time to go back and forth
---
I don't think that contacting blizzard is going to help you at the moment i think they are to busy trying not to get fcked
---
It's always the broken tables.
---
Do you work for the government? That’s not a private entity and not equitable. Furthermore the inability for government workers to be fired for cause is a bad thing not a good one.
---
People have that rush feeling, gotta level as quick as possible, get the objective gogo, screw this guy waiting for the spawn I'm sniping it. 
---
I mean, everyone is trying to get to level 60 so that's kinda the behavior that arises if left unchecked. On launch you would get so punished for trying to rush things, pull two mobs and you died, Sit and wait 15 minutes for boss spawn then do that 3x over for a quest chain, trying to be clever about turning in quest so you go to org and turn in a quest then you go back to your leveling zone and immediately you get another quest to go to org. 
---
After a while it just gets too stressful to actually care about the fact that you just went to org back and forth three times, so you just chill out and convince yourself that you don't care if someone else gets the objective before you. At level 18 people haven't gotten their hopes crushed enough, I think that comes later.
---
Oh well then I guess the gloves indeed increase base crit chance from 4.40% to 4.68% = 0.28% increase against level 63 bosses. Not really significant but thanks for clarifying then.
---
&gt;On top of that it indirectly increases crit by reducing glancing blows, which can't crit. 
---
Again I may be wrong but weapon skill only decreases glancing blow damage, not the chance of it happening (which will always be 40% against lvl 63 bosses).
---
Aww congrats to your friend, he’ll have a full 8 months to play wow
---
Thats whats so fun imo, a wide toolset for rogues. I couldn't imagine playing a 1-2 button paladin. Roll horde?
---
jealous of my skill lmao
---
That was my first thought as well. Not sure there is a guide for taking in 3 elites at once.
---
Join my guild discord and check the pinned links.

same here.  I had not played retail since 2008, but like most I dabbled into it in the last few weeks before classic launched in august , while waiting.   Got to lvl 30 . Made 2000g selling linen shirts and other lvl 5 garbage.   Never died.   got random epic upgrades.  Outleveled a zone after doing 10% of its quests. Decided I had had enough.
---
I'm a 60 holy pally and so far I can't really complain about not having time to reg. Looks like I'm blessed.
---
fuck this piece pf shit company you just know if hed said something like “protect trans children” or “black lives matter” or “stop brezit” they would not have done jack shit. fuck you allen brack “you think you want it but you actually don’t” moron
---
You wish
---
It's just a difference of culture, like, they eat scorpions as well, no outcry on behalf of those.
---
You're gonna ruin the economy kappa
---
Horde would probably be fun, but then again, I'd just get stuck at 42 again lmao
---
In terms of time you would of course lose the time you put in on your warrior, however, it’s all about what makes you happy. If you don’t play this game to make yourself happy then it will just be a chore. Reroll 30 alts, it won’t be time efficient but you’ll be happy.
---
Lol. Try finding Golden Sansem. That shit is torture. I’ve run in a small circle trying to find it before Just to have someone with ground clutter turned down to 1 ride right up to and and grab it. Long story short. My setting is now at 1.
---
Would you drink water in Flynt?
---
These are all complicated rules that take two paragraphs to explain the logic when blizzard have already a system in place, need or greed. If someone needs an epic to sell when everyone else greeded, back in ye olden times, that guy was blacklisted from nearly every progressing guild on the server. Options were litterly reroll and hope people don't figure it out
---
I'm of the opinion of just asking. 99% of the time you say the item is an upgrade for you and ask to roll need people seem more than okay with letting you need roll it.
---
Just a little courtesy goes a long way.
---
So it would be better to just keep politics out of their broadcast?
---
That's the plan :)
---
Just wanted to sign off gracefully.

i found it really good for knowing where to grab extra quests for zones and where i could easily farm items that started quests.
---
There's an addon called guidelime, it's got a plugin for this particular guide so it steps you through ingame.
---
Lol, you’re gonna find excuses as to why people could do it but you can’t and that’s fine but don’t post on reddit for attention and than try to get people to feel bad for you or something... shits rough I have been tanks and camped, running does suck but now with a mount it’s awesome...ever since my mount I have been more eager than ever to get 60 so realistically it’s just you
---
Sometimes its just bad luck. When we did ZF for the witch doctor's rod, the drop rate posted is around 12%, and we see lots of people carrying the rod.
---
But it took my friend 40 runs and me 37 runs to get the rod. And we did get them, we got them twice in a row...
---
How does that make sense? If it's an upgrade and will be equipped, how is that not considered "need"?
---
i've had to use "brb bomb" once
---
was living on a military base and a suspicious package was found outside so they cleared the building, i was in the middle of a dungeon :/
---
I take it to another level around hunters and kill their pets just incase they've been neglecting them and haven't fed em in a while. I'm really hoping I hit the jackpot and kill a brokentooth and it runs away.
---
Hey guys the chad is here
---
Same here, 25 runs and never seen it. Thought it was much easier to get before I started.
---
It's pretty pathetic how big sycophants the moderators on this subreddit are. Imagine licking someone's asshole squeaky clean without getting paid for it.
---
C-ya
---
Combat rogues are 3 buttons. SS, s&amp;d, evis, repeat.
---
&gt; 300 hours.
---
Still only 42. This might be your problem, not the "grind," or "lack of quests".
---
Agreed, but if you're gonna spam general chat, a tip is much appreciated
---
Polymorph helps a lot and frost nova
---
Of course it's me. I lose all my motivation every time I have to corpse run back to my mbody after being body slammed by a orc warrior the same level as me. I just can't compete.
---
So cute!!!!! I want a kitty too! :(

So you want someone to ninja your BoE when it drops, then?

stop using this bullshit strawman argument please .
---
WE DON'T DO THAT. I'll quote DowntownOven above, who explained it nicely:
---
&gt;It's really not that complicated.
---
BoP need&gt;greed
---
BoE low value need&gt;greed, no one cares and most go to full greed anyway
---
For high value (good upgrades/bis) BoEs, selling it to another player for gold is not making it harder on anyone to get their, you're just trading time (gold) for the item. It also removes the need for trust among random people.
---
This only really applies to a select few items. The gun, freezing band, edgemaster's, the lock ring, maiden's circle, krol blade, deep wood, flurry. Some patterns and formulas. I think that's about it, might have forgotten a couple.
---
NEED FOR boes is only for these JACKPOT items like
---
Ah yes, the foundation of online video games, "the gentlemen's agreement" that everyone completely abides by
---
Same with stranglekelp in Menethil harbour
---
Pretty sure it's a charm. And 100% sure that wotf used to break it during some period in the history of WoW.
---
I mean who cares if those mobs in sm gy cursed the tank so he can't be healed lul amirite ? :)
---
60 Warrior running 17/3/31,  I'm actually enjoying Protection more than I expected, but I still harbor this delusion that Ill be allowed to dps an instance (I was arms/fury until 58 and never once got into a group as a dps).  Anyone dps in prot spec?  
---
Also curious if anyone is running 31/5/15?  What's your experience with it?
---
Have heard it I just don't understand the logic. I understand it much more clearly with cross realm groups, but when we all play on the same server with no xfers and name changes, your name will be dragged through the mud and you'll have to explain the logic to 50% of the server that dont understand why you needed when u didn't need.
---
You dont Spec improved frostbolt leveling - so aoe is way better. But 90% ppl are still stupid.
---
Yeah that's the reason I respecced to sub at only lvl 20. It's not ideal for leveling/pve, but so much more fun in PvP and pve
---
Yep. I don't know what it is, if I'm doing something wrong, if I have wrong spec or gear, or if everyone is camping mobs everywhere. Honestly clueless.
---
oh stop being a fucking pedant, greed BoEs all you want but keep your crying about it to the official forums where people somehow give a fuck
---
What server? Usually it’s for a reason
---
Therapy. You need it.
---
I'm just surprised to get so many downvotes for meming.
---
Honestly do it. Let us know how your experience goes
---
I enjoy it, but if you read the subreddit regularly you have already heard the conversations they're going to have. It's still one of my commute podcasts though.
---
Learn to read?
---
Wait what? You only got to 42 in 300 hours? No wonder it felt like a grind man. By all means if it’s not for you it’s not for you but how on earth did you manage that?
---
Did mc for the first time a few days ago. I am a dps warrior. I died to trash a few times, it was pretty embarassing... is there anything i need to know about any of the trash mobs? I know the imps are off limits for melee dps.
---
I’m fucking dead
---
All day, every day thier is competition. Even at 4am
---
Rofl.
---
"You're just doing this to please the Chinese government"
---
"This has nothing to do with China"
---
"See, if it had nothing to do with China why would they mention it?"
---
You haven't done 50% of the quests in the game.
---
Consider what you're using it for, you're doing dungeons? imp shield block is useful for fighting raid bosses who hit you with crushing blows. Also consider maxing defiance, to me its the reason to put any points into protection. With 5/5 defiance youre doing 149.5% threat instead of 130%.
---
You’re off your fucking head if you think anyone would pass.
---
I'd like to know as well. Away from my computer at the moment
---
If everyone AGREES need roll before anyone rolls need, loot rules have been set for the item and adhered too, also known as agreeing as gentlemen. While it's healthy to be cynical, this happens quite often in wow, I am sure you have discovered people that are actually quite reasonable
---
It takes long killing mobs, waiting for them to respawn, walking and flying to quest spots, doing some professions on the side. It adds up quickly.
---
You're definitely doing something wrong, but that's to be expected if you're new. I'm leveling my second character which is 52 and I haven't "grinded" yet on either character, dungeons or openworld. The game actually flows really well, just most people don't know how.
---
I feel that the first wave of players (i.e. those that got to 60 in 2 weeks) were overall nicer people than everyone else. The *only* rude person I met while leveling my main was a gnome mage that stole my chest and was later kicked out of the faction's first two raiding guilds.
---
i basically had the exact same screenshot as my desktop wallpaper for a good 3 years
---
I quested all the way to 60, doing each instance once as I got the quests for them. Zero need to grind at all unless you want to.
---
No, I've done the quests that are realistically in reach for my level and not in dungeons.
---
Mages look so hard to play in PvP.
---
And btw when we started doing UBRS, my friend got briareed on his first run, me on the third.
---
Try to use some logic. It really isn't that complicated. 
---
BoP need&gt;greed  
---
BoE low value need&gt;greed, no one cares and most go to full greed anyway  
---
I'm new to vanilla yes, played lots on private servers and retail.
---
Just not sure what I'm doing wrong though, it took me 11 days to reach 93 back in pandaria.
---
It’s 51% for me. And the fact that it can crit is redundant, it does not change the percentage of your damage at all. So a 1% increase to 50% of your damage is around a .5% increase. Slightly more for horde. Meanwhile, crit affects every source of damage and even has a bonus 30% multiplier for some abilities, making it worth more than a 1% overall damage increase, undeniably.
---
Most classes decked in BWL gear will basically delete you in blue pvp gear. As it should be
---
You can barely get 12 with zero competition
---
&gt;be a warlock
---
&gt; Flame strike, CoC, then Frost Nova, 
---
Hopefully you don't do this with shatter.
---
Its very good. Kept me intrigued as i read. At some points i felt it carried on a bit, but it didnt take me long to work through those. Captured the intensity of the elementals as well as the beauty of the environment. Id like to read this in book form with chapters. Kudos to some excellent writing
---
Gl
---
No thanks
---
Included context
---
Yea, commiting a crime and doing nothing wrong is exactly the same thing.
---
I said both factions gank an equal amount.
---
Sorry bud. Won it with a Greed roll on my Paladin yesterday, 3rd or 4th Scholo run. The Warlock was unable to see it's worth and didn't roll Need. 
---
He also didn't roll on the damage/healing cloth set because he was too focused getting his T0. Ouch. He was the only caster in a group. His reason was he didn't want to be greedy needing so many items. We told him it's his right to Need on caster items. What a poor guy. 
---
He also bodypulled a group in the cellar earlier because he backpedaled into it, wiping us. It certainly was an... interesting Warlock, especially considering his char name was Sauerkraut, and the guild "Go play Retail then".
---
I was in LBRS today. At one point the dps warrior got damage. I used chainheal on him as I usually do with dps. Then he was at 3/4 health I castef another chainheal and he died before it was through. He had literally all the aggro, including the sheeped mob.
---
He then complained about not getting enough heals and the tank told him to not use whirlwind this fast in such a small room, because it takes aggro and breaks CC.
---
And he was like "No you dont understand. I don't have a problem with taking aggro. I have a problem with not getting enough heals when I have aggro"
---
Tank was like "This is the entire point on why you should not take aggro"
---

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
My experience is the same you cowards always gank 3v1 on a server where you are the majority and it’s always while I’m fighting a mob.
---
It's because the right have been using this same joke (their one and only) for like a decade now. It's so old even irony can't save it.
---
Shit is tired as fuck.
---
I used the lockers in desolace to get to over 200. Then I went to searing gorge and unlocked dented lockers. Once you hit 250 skill it becomes very easy I just asked in every brd run to open the  doors.
---
Half the trash is horrid for melee DPS. The fire elementals some have pulsing AOE where you might as well not even bother, lava elementals of different types have varying abilities like explosion or knock back. Welcome to MC life.
---
Everyone on reddit seems to vehemently give a fuck tbh. If you don't like my drivel ignore my name and move on. If someone is interested I debating the semantics I'm here
---
This is a great meme format
---
almost as if theres assholes on any faction - still alliance are bitches
---
You look like an orc that broke into my grandmas house and stole her wardrobe
---
Most likely everything. You probably lack direction and don't play with much efficiency.
---
Fairness has nothing to do with this situation.
---
It’s the player base and the classic community are getting more and more toxic. The game is always fair, but no one wants to play with toxic players or discuss anything with toxic online strangers.
---
Every elemental and resto shaman
---
Its ether the rep bar, or your empty exp bar,  you can find em in bt options., to turn it off.
---
I know one time i was stunned INSIDE a puddle of fire.
---
You should probably get rid of the old bag and get some freshies.
---
It’s your rep bar. Should be able to turn it off in settings or use the bartender settings to make it invisible
---
It works so well if your healer has mana, you pull, mages drink for 6 seconds and then dump their aoe. Most time efficient but mages often tell me to wait for their mana to be full before I pull. Bro, everyone else can DPS. Just drink while I get aggro and you'll still end up on top with nova coc
---
No joke I’m in SM CATH right now and people will look at my talents and ridicule that I took points in improved frostbolt when I get there.. 
---
I did it for questing and single target because it’s a nice bonus. Most mages straight up think it’s weird to even consider taking it though
---
He is 60 soon, why wouldnt he have long fingernails?
---
I got it first time in there when running the quest to kill Rend. So probably just as many examples of getting better than expected odds.
---
I did a lot of census. Ashbringer is the most balanced. Zandalari tribe is rppvp, a slightly more alliance there. Other servers are horde dominated. Shazzran is like 33%-67%.
---
&gt; And he was like "No you dont understand. I don't have a problem with taking aggro. I have a problem with not getting enough heals when I have aggro"
---
Sounds like he wants to be tank
---
He accepts it because he is getting his fair 20% chance. like everybody else!
---
The next week he is in a run, and the BOE epic FREEZE mage ring drops  and he as a WARRIOR is entitled to roll on that TOO.   Nobody ninjas, all have an equal chance on some big money item.
---
Note: this system only goes for big money items.  If you need a 5g item that somebody else can use, you are just being a dick.
---
If they're that low why do you expect them to go up again? When gold inflates?
---
Just abandon the quest and accept again to begin the summoning.
---
Play a normal server. Your experience will be much better. I'm not a pvp server player either.
---
Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without
---
I think you’re right that it’s a charm
---
DPS warriors are very good, but still need to fill the rest of the group.
---
You can do a MS or Fury tank build as long as you have the right gear for dual wield tanking. Or even just throw on a shield. I don’t know the ins and outs but our guilds main tank did all of Mc as dual wield fury tank build and was fine.
---
How are people struggling with mount money..? 
---
1. Do quests and pick the highest vendor reward unless it’s a substantial upgrade.
---
2. Vendor greys, AH anything of use.
---
3. *Do not buy gear from the AH*.
---
I hit 40 and bought my mount one hearth later, along with all my training. Didn’t do anything special, just get as many quests done as you can and be smart with your gold.
---
That's just sad
---
I would if I could, but I don't think server transfers are free, right?
---
Nah I disagree. There’s a true identity element involved. Wearing an illusion is lame imo. Shit like that is why I quit WoW. It’s totally okay for us to have different opinions on this lol
---
They're L.L. Bean can't speak for those lined pairs because I just have the regular Bean boots but I can definitely recommend those.
---
K
---
arguing with a greed zealot  is like arguing with a jehovah witness .. pointless   :(
---
You should stick to green and yellow zones and group quests and not run to long for them. Also do some dungeons for exp and gear.
---
"Lack of quests in late game" uh you're not even half way to max level.. and there are enough quests in this game to get to max level. It's just nobs saying you have to grind a ton. If you level properly with quests and a dungeon every so often you'll find yourself overwhelmed with quests and zones around level 42..
---
A lock with low mana is a good lock. Rapid small pulls keeps the lock at &lt;25%, and the healer at &gt;75%, and you won't wipe.
---
This is me finding literally any herb. +1
---
Sounds like you're a communist who wants free shit off of others labor.   Fuck out of here.
---
30s can be pretty tough IMO.  I blasted through from 27 to 41 in Scarlet Monastery.  (Starting out at GY, then LIB, then Armory then Cath I believe was the order).
---
It got even better once a couple of people that I PUG'd with regularly invited me to their guild and we'd all do a few runs a night after work.  Being in discord together allowed us to step up the coordination and take bigger pulls, etc.  But it wasn't bad before that with PUGs, just a little slower.
---
I get that dungeon leveling isn't for everyone.  And honestly I'm not too big of a fan of it myself, but the rate you can get XP in SM vs anything else was just way too tempting.   Especially given how slow the 30s can be in terms of finding quests (and for some specs, doing them solo can be a challenge as well).
---
Identity politics make money while human rights risks money
---
Or you use the standard need and greed system like it’s supposed to be. And not your made up rules? 
---
If you want your ninja looting rules make your own group and state those at the start. If you join my group and ninja an boe item you don’t equip I’m gonna kick you instantly and report you to everywhere possible. Need = equip and greed = gold. Either you follow those rules in my group or you can fuck the hell off.
---
&gt;Nope must be capitalism since this doesn't happen in other countries.
---
Ah, there it is. The willful blindness. You love to see such enthusiastic hypocrisy.
---
So all the quests are in STV then? Because there ain't many outside of it.
---
Someone posted about this earlier it is the rep bar as stated above. Theres a bug I’m guessing isn’t fixed were you have to actually track a rep and then turn it off or the bar won’t disappear when it is turned off. Hope that helps.
---
He is drinking it as if the water ran out of fizzyness..
---
You clearly didn't understand what I wrote.
---
Have fun finding a healer if you reserve something look briar. Or have fun finding a tank for angerforge groups if you  reserve HoJ.  
---
If a DPS is reserving the only item a tank or healer needs for that run, have fun  finding one.
---
amen
---
There are no such zones left for me except STV. 99% of quests left are dark orange and red.
---
Sounds like you need need to get a guild that doesn’t /roll for gear.
---
I am still missing for how much OP sold it.
---
Sounds like something to consider
---
Is there an addon that lets you look at other people's talents?
---
I feel like you are for sure doing something wrong. I’m a slow leveller, playing a class that is slow to level, on top of this I regularly go afk which adds up a lot to my /played, sometimes I sit in cities for hours just chatting.
---
I’m level 51 and have much less time played than you.
---
Normally if someone is quitting Classic, I just say fair enough for trying it out and enjoying it for a bit.
---
But part of me thinks it’s completely possible you were playing in a way that was really really slowing down your progress and making the grind terrible.
---
And it’s possible if you fixed this maybe you would enjoy the game a lot more.
---
Simple answer is dont heal the warlocks when they do that ti themselves
---
Looking like [Lily](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5e/Lily.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110121195015)
---
A couple of guildmates of mine were telling me at some point there is going to be an update where all pet cats in the game will have their attack speed equalized to 1.5 attack speed. Does this mean at some point cats won't be the best for PvP, specifically Broken Tooth?
---
In reality he would be hooked to anything you do. I love kittens.
---
My husband said that at the beginning, people were roleplaying the people they *remember* being back at the day. Really they are a-holes and it's only a matter of time before they get tired of the roleplay and show their true selves.
---
I pull with with [Faerie fire] and usually have combo points to make [Ferocious bite], [Rip] or just increased movement speed to finish fleeing mob.
---
Would be entirely possible, but I have no idea what it could be honestly. It's not like I want to waste 200 hours.
---
No way the mats are that cheap on any server. Righteous orb and 6 Essence of water alone is way more expensive on any server. 
---
20g must have been his fee if you bring mats.
---
Remorseless Attacks keeps working even if you range tag.
---
me am that kind of orc
---
No he accepts it because you ninja scum doesn't give him a choice. I really don't get you guys. I would never even think about rolling someone away an item. Whatever it's worth. You guys are sad. Really. Stop spreading your ninja looting shit as norm.
---
Yeah the alt trick is just a fast way to reset, it puts you back at the entrance portal and you have to clear back to the boss.
---
From what I understand,  the bannable thing was resetting the instance while you were in the room with the boss so you could do boss fight after boss fight without having to clear your way back to the boss every time.  Not sure if it bypassed the instance lockout of 5 per hour, either.
---
But I haven't heard of any bans for just doing the alt reset method since that's just eliminating the run out, not the run to the boss.
---
Do a few cath runs and then zf, you will get some decent gear and open up zones like tanaris. It should be easier now at 40+ when you have shadow form.
---
An orc warrior? Beating a shadow priest? That should never happen
---
Dude there were not that many nerfs in 1.3, actually there were barely any, real vanilla isnt as hard as you think man. Also nothing in the patch notes hints tons dmg nerd like you suggest making mins hit like noodles making AoE good. It was just the masses didn't know about AoE much back then.

How is it done? Every time I google its not two stealthies. I have a rogue buddy I stealth farm unforgiven. Just wondering if it’s a pop evasion nuke then vanish?
---
i cant watch this clicking bs
---
Yeah man but in around about the same time as you I got to 60, levelled my professions to 300 (including cooking and fishing), and am most of the way to my epic mount... and I wasn’t trying to rush even a little bit, just went from zone to zone and did the quests. I did each instance once each for the quests, then carried on.
---
42 is around about the halfway point to 60. I’m not saying don’t take your time but if your complaint is how grindy the game is and you spent 300 hours to get to 42 I’m just... confused. Especially as I didn’t grind *at all*. I just did quests.
---
I admit I have a lot more experience in the game than you do which helps (original vanilla player) but 300 hours for 42 seems excessive.
---
My latest experience in Stratholme:
---
Me:  Focus the marked target while I establish aggro on the rest of them.
---
Mage:  *casts blizzard on entire group while I am walking towards them*
---
Mage:  I'm not used to pulling aggro, my usual tank is able to handle it.
---
Me:  How are they holding aggro if you start casting before I even get to the mobs?
---
Hunter:  The mage is right, even I am pulling aggro.
---
Me:  Because I have no rage and have to break off marked target to get them huddled together again.
---
Mage + Hunter:  No, you are just bad at tanking and druids are a meme class.
---
Me:  Screw it, good luck guys.  *ports out wondering why he is in a pug group*
---
Anything level 30+ will kill me in a few hits. I have no idea what to do in PvP and I have nothing to slow them down.
---
Got an epic that won't even sell for 15g...
---
Why did you sold it for low price? Did you want quick money?
---
All these answers are wrong. The exp drop off caps at 10 levels of difference, you will get something like 30-50% of the exp, I cant recall the number. Running 4 of my friends through SM with my mage was netting all 4 of them 50k exp per hour.
---
What level bracket do you guys hate the most?
---
I personally hate Lvl 30-40, It feels so slow and SM is played out
---
I have shadow form. In tanaris, the only quests that exists are for 45+ level mobs and that's extremely tough.

Not a Warrior. Still gz on your mount!
---
I disagree. If it's an upgrade you need then you can need it. Greens aren't like blue BoE's that are worth several pieces of gold. They are usually vendor trash to people that don't use them.
---
What evidence do you have for such a statement?  The suggestion that you can tell how much a sub-section of the player base, divided by the arbitrary decision of faction, ganks is laughable.
---
Leatrix Maps will do this I believe and it shows dungeon/raid entrances and flight paths
---
I have maxed out cooking and fishing too when at work or when waiting for friends to arrive, but that went by very quickly.
---
I think the speed of killing affects it a lot, and all the traveling.
---
Pretty sure it’s a server by server thing. I distinctly remember it being greed back in the day, but it was need when I played on private servers.
---
A life.
---
Get one.
---
Totally agreed.
---
Deja character stats does if both players have it.
---
HUNTER question re: ADDONS. 
---
Anyone know where I can get addons for things like tracking and aspects? I used to have them so I don't have to have like 30 buttons in action bars for these things. But I can't find them now :(
---
I've actually seen a couple dal'rends drop while doing this, I must just be cursed lol
---
The game starts at level 1. It does not matter how long it takes to get to max level.
---
What is Inktober?
---
Nice! Now level your cooking and fishing to 300. :)
---
Don't worry I prefer playing with people that have some skill in critical thinking so I wouldn't  burden you with my 'evil loot system.'
---
(As we explained a thousand times before, the need and greed system works fine for bops and low value stuff, but it doesn't work for 500g items.   If all greed, a ninja can wait and ACTUALLY ninja by rolling as the 5th player, grabbing the item, laughing at the other 4 and hearthstoning out.   
---
If all roll need this is not possible.  Everybody has a fair chance on EVERY expensive item.  Doesn't matter what class you are, these items are not farmable anyway, most people will only see one in 3 to 6 months, if ever.   a 20% chance! Totally fair.   I am sorry if you can't see the rationale behind this.
---
The red felt hat is the best part...
---
You don't outlevel zones any more, they scale to your level. Retail is shit as is, no need to invent things
---
Nice! Thanks a lot &lt;3
---
Feralas, shimmering flats, stv, badlands, arathi, alterac, hinterlands, tanaris, searing gorge
---
Amazing*
---
6) for real though, I’ve noticed this about most mages. Especially when it comes to dealing out mage water to the group.
---
You know only minmaxers buy gloves off the AH for a thousand gold, right?   It’s not shocking that the people who know and care enough about the gloves also know enough to not need them.
---
Don't worry, I got a chuckle from it
---
Playing in prime time is almost impossible. I have a chance to play in the morning and I can gain xp decently. I just do some other real life thing while others play or do some professions.
---
works quite simple actually, you dot non main targets from the start, try yourself
---
This is the greatest shitpost I've ever seen in my life.
---
Lay off the shroooms maaaaaan
---
Well if you ever decide to have another go, consider getting an add on like Questie - it shows you on the map where each quest is and then where to go to complete it. Means you can go to a zone and get every quest before mapping out an efficient way to get a bunch done at once.
---
Some of my friends used it to get to 60 pretty fast, I didn’t bother myself but I hear it’s super useful.
---
Outside of STV, there are barely any quests at all left, and they're mostly too high level for me. Especially hinterlands which is recommended.
---
Following
---
you don't need to be shadow to put up shadow weaving
---
Nah that's bullshit. Either treat them like BOE Epics and everyone need rolls to prevent ninja looting, or don't get mad when someone who actually needs it as an upgrade rolls need. Upgrading your fellow group member is worth way more than getting 1 gold.
---
I use questie extensively, would never have gotten this far without it.
---
You are just wrong, and the numbers prove it. Go do some reading before making outlandish statements.
---
Some places have sulfurous water. Can be removed with an economic sink filter thought ($10-20 every few months)
---
Arms warrior, level 43, right now. I feel like my whirlwind is due an upgrade. Have run Uldaman twice now but the weapons didn't drop. Any ideas where I can get an upgrade? Don't really fell like repeatedly running Uldaman but will if I have to for that juicy upgrade.
---
wc3 sammy boxes
---
Haha ! Thanks, cooking is 225, but fishing ! I'm not touching that yet...
---
Yeah, a paladin and warrior tank for a full BRD run surprisingly works well. We thought we'd try it after I asked a friend and he told me that he's no longer DPS
---

Power word shield &gt; Psychic Scream &gt; Dots &gt; Mind Blast &gt; Mind flay&gt; Dead

Hey, I got an idea for you. If it's so hard to understand. Imagine everyone doing what's best for themselves. There you go. Just do that.
---
Kurinaxx represent!
---
Ik that you already quit the game and it’s a shame but shadow priest are really one of the strongest specs for pvp
---
Except for psychic scream, that's what I do.
---
For level 45+ (what the quests require), it takes about 25-50 seconds to kill each mob, of course if I don't run out of mana.
---
The quests you have in the screenshot are good chains that continue and should be easily doable at 42
---
Try to do SM runs. You will level super fast just spamming dungeons. Great exp with no competition for mobs or chances to get ganked.
---
That's literally like every company with ties to China though. People are just singling out Blizzard because its trending and puts an ovbious target to it. Meanwhile, consuming Chinese products en masse and deleting apps off their iPhones.
---
For those who TLDR - Keep your political opinions to yourself in the work place.
---
Pretty sure every employer I've worked for has policy against this and will typically fire or severely reprimand anyone who violates it. Its nothing more here.
---
If they let chung do it, they have to let everyone do it and then gaming tournaments will just turn into Fox News and CNN drama when they want it to be focused on gaming and the tournament. Not everyone wants to have politics shoved down their throat all the time.
---
I'm happy to see he got his winnings back and along with the casters only a 6 months suspension. I think that's a much more fair punishment than the knee jerk reaction punishment they dolled out at first.
---
What is that aggro indicator that you use?
---
Divide and conquer in its purist form. Break the individuals of the same nation into sub fractions because its easier to take over smaller sub fraction identities than it is to take over one major one.

Hard pass
---
Did a guild run, but had to pug the tank. 
---
Somewhere out there theres a prot pala with hoj.
---
I really don't understand how that's supposed to work. Probably at level 60?
---
Fishing is quite fun I think. Once you starting fishing up green equipment from the pools of wreckage in stranglethorn and feralis you’ll be glad you did it. Very rewarding and a nice break from leveling to relax.
---
I want himmmmmmmm.
---
Omg I haven’t thought about this sword in 15 years. I found it grinding sorrow hill when classic launched and my god this is the first time I have seen anything about it since. Crazy how memory works.
---
Horde have better racials for PvP, and horde are soooooo much easier to level than ally in classic.
---
Why did you roll on pvp server? If you wanted to pvp or gank then keep going and you can do it at 60. If you don’t really want these, pve server is really good, especially for alliance.
---
Im lvl 44. At 40 or 41 I thought the same that there are no more quests, but im 44 and still a lot of quests to do. I did one and only dungeon at lvl 30 and grinded like 1 bar in my whole leveling. Try installing some addons. Questie. Check some leveling guides..
---
I remember this happening in legion too.
---
I did do a bunch of runs but got really tired of SM especially, but also dungeons. 
---
One run is 40 minutes and it gives me a fourth of the xp bar. Gets repetitive fast.
---
Handle that water situation, sir
---
I'm referring to the training cost, not mana cost
---
It doesn't really matter what you do. Your guild isn't relying on you and you won't have a spot until you actually commit to a character. Do what you want.
---
thank you &lt;3
---
Reminds me of chicken reporting crimes to guards in Skyrim.
---
Yes it was stupid, I regret that.
---
I have questie, that's how I can see that all the quests are too high level for me.
---
If I time it just right, I can tag it just before you get your opening off, then the mob agros on you while I have the tag.
---
Ferelas and dungeons
---
well, except it won't be dragged in mud,  as all experienced veterans I know from the major guilds on my server prefer the need on expensive boes system because they are.. you know.... experienced veterans..  They know how the game works and how the economy works and this is the fairest system for everybody. 
---
Nota bene (1) : 
---
We are talking random pugs here.  
---
Nota bene (2):   
---
We are talking EXPENSIVE boe's here, like the Edgemasters.  Stuff you see drop once a year, if ever.   NOT EVERY random item.
---
Nota Bene (3):  communication is essential, as long as these different schools of thought on looting exist we should make clear we are all on the same page at the dungeon start.
---
They SHINE at 60, they are a jack of all trades and are able to fill in to basically any role which is what they are there for. They won't crush healing meters, as that's what they weren't designed for that. Priests and Paladins do that and that's the ONLY thing they do.
---
They won't dominate dps meters, mages, warlocks and rogues ONLY do that.
---
As I said, they are flexible so they shine, as they are intended to. Heal one encounter, tank the next, dps soon after. Whatever they are needed to do.
---
;\_\_; I'm TrYiNg   
---

---
Question. What makes this item so good? Feel like most anything with a crit chance or hit chance with additional stats would beat it.
---
Or am I seriously undervaluing the weapon skill ranks? Suppose my issue might be I never played a melee DPS. Then most all of my game experience is from BC and WotLK which I know is a different ball game.
---
half thank (:
---
The greed/need system works perfectly fine. But apparently wherever you play you only play with ninja looter. So you live in permanent angst of people ninja looting you. So you changed your system to become one yourself. Congrats.
---
Luckily the people I play with it are not scum and ninja looter. And if I get one it's also not the end of the world. You report the shit out of him and he never sets foot on the server again. You can ruin ones reputation really easy in classic. 
---
Like you guys are so pathetic that you even can't be happy that someone else gets an upgrade over you.
---
I’d advise finding someone to help you—lots of wars will step in the breach for their fellows.
---
Insufficient and reeks of bullshit
---
It isna counter point.  You are saying people are just trying to get BiS because they follow the herd.  In reality the largest amount if players arnt even 60 yet and definitely not Full BiS.  My counter point is that they are not sheep but infact just trying to play the game the way they want.
---
First time hearing about classic servers I was like "oh they will finally do It huh?" Didn't even think for a second I would come back. Heard two days before classic release, thought uh what the hell let's try.
---
God damn I'm hooked again 😀. 45 priest having so much fun.
---
This. There are always going to be the assholes. The best you can do is be nice yourself and hope it spreads. 
---
e.g. I always give free food/water to group members without them having to ask even while just questing with 1-2 randoms. If they try to pay me, I decline and say it's free for groupies. I'm not trying to make money then, I'm trying to quest. It takes an extra minute of effort to make things run smoothly for everyone.
---
The result is I have a lot of people on friends list and people constantly hit me back to group up, healers love me and do it the most for dungeons. Whenever they're forming a group, they remember that nice mage who was a bro from 45 levels ago.
---
Yeah it gets repetitive and a run shouldn’t take 40 minutes tbh. Find a good group willing to grind it and you can probably get it down to like 20 minutes or so a run. I did dungeons from 35-50 so far with maybe 5-10 world quests sprinkled in to change it up. So far 40-50 seems to have actually been the fastest for me. It has slowed down a little since hitting 50 though. It that is to be expected.
---
Feralas is only 45+ mobs for me now.
---
I'm over it with dungeons. I know they're important but I'm so god damn tired of them
---
Just checking in
---
Doesnt let you in? Why does this even matter
---
Most people aren’t 60 yet. I am currently lvl 39 and lvl 19 with alt. Can easily find a group in any zone. Ashbringer EU
---
Dude you arent reading my fucking comments... im agreeing with you, i said in every comment that neither faction is worse you dumbass
---
Did you finish Badlands, dustwallow marsh, Shimmeeint flat (earlier), arathi highlands, swamp of sorrows?
---
Alternatively repeatedly ask me to AoE with a tank that doesn't know how to fucking stand still. Blizzard actually costs a fuck ton of Mana, you deciding to change positions mid channel means half my Blizzard misses. Even worse when your new position is next to me and I get hit with a disarm of some kind that stops me from casting before I can move. shit like that is a surefire way to make sure I go back to single target.
---
Executioners axe off the ah will serve you well until brd emp runs for dreadforge retaliator
---
I can tell you're the type of player to be completely lost without having his hand held
---
It's a real testament to the power tanks have based on the role demographics. If you're playing a warrior, there's basically no reason not to do this starting from deadmines. No shortage of casters willing to quickly join a group so if you're willing to form and lead groups you can hoover up literally every leather, mail, plate and melee weapon that drops. Level up armed to the teeth. 
---
I'm still playing a lock though cause I'm too lazy to lead a group and they're more fun in world pvp; completely appreciating that getting groups will be that much harder.
---
Great content!
---
Well even finding a group takes time, usually half an hour to an hour until we can start, so that makes the experience even worse.
---
Dungeon grinding would probably be the best option if I could stomach it, but two runs are the most.
---
I rate it meow out of meow
---
i have this rag shield im a bit disapointed in the 3d art they gave it
---
like i love simple models but any of the level 20-40 shields would have been better looking 
---
still need to chuck a spike on my one
---
I like to watch these people die while i drink
---
I would. I'm terrible at games.
---
Yeah but then you get to AQ and that place is full of bugs.
---
So it's clear that you have absolutely no idea how to play this game, or are familiar with any of the game mechanics judging by your comment history. It's no wonder you're leaving. Don't let the door hit you on the way out, also nobody cares .
---
Is your server dead?
---
Classic warlocks are raid bosses.
---
*Source-am raid boss.
---
I was just interested. Like what kind of message one would get etc. If you haven't actually tried it yourself i'm not interested in your response.
---
Sounds like a problem for dps shaman players. I’ve got my own issues being a hunter and still leveling from starting late. I’m missing our first phase 1 runs and in about 9 months my class is basically irrelevant for 40 mans. 
---
That’s the nature of classic. Play what you like and accept the metas as they come.
---
I have really never done multi pulling as a lock.  I can see its usefulness in a heavyly tagged area.  Sadly i took 2 weeks off for release and did not have to deal with mass competition for tags while level.  I also play on a pvp server and have found that the best deterrent for getting ganked is being full health with a soulstone up.  I might make my horde lock and try this though.  I truely felt like my voidwalker was a lack luster summon in the leveling process and even more so now.  Even though that is somewhat expected.
---
Nonsense.
---
Na was his mats, he must of not known the value, just like how all the engineers sell sniper scopes for peanuts.
---
My reaction was initially almost identical to yours.  "Oh, re-releasing vanilla?  That's kinda cool.  Maybe I'll give it a try.  Maybe, but I doubt it."
---
Then it dropped and I saw all the screenshots and videos online.  Downloaded the client and bought a month's sub 3 days later when I got paid.  No regrets.
---
God this post is cancer
---
Yes. There's probably one quest left in each area which is either an impossible escort quest or a rare grind. Desolace is pretty much done. 
---
I went back to stv at like 38 but left shortly thereafter when ganked.
---
Well done on adopting - you’re doing your part. 
---
He looks amazing and full of personality. Grats.
---
yeah ok, I noticed the mobs leveled up with me, I should have explained it better:
---
I don't want to be lvl 30 in Westfall, as that is for me a lvl 10-18 zone or so.  I could continue in Westfall and do all the quests, but then I would be lvl 40 or so and still have not done numerous other zones,   etc etc so eventually I would outlevel all of Kalimdor and still have done only 15% of its content  (number pulled out of my ass, but you get the idea I hope)
---
(Psst, as alliance you can ride the elevator up to freewind post then shadowmeld at the top without guards bothering you, it’s a long way down if you know what I mean)
---
We did it two rogues, one opens / evasion and give a couple of seconds, second opens, first one feints when evasion drops, second pop evasions then both vanish after looting
---
Maybe? Ashbringer EU.

As I check tsm I’m averaging 69 gold a day and my highest seller goes for about 25g  I sell rare patterns, recipes and fishing 🎣 items. I have accumulated about 700g and bought my mount and all updated spells

Blizzard said they will remove layering in phase 2. I'm not sure where you saw anything about removing it earlier.

Really? How much is 1% crit worth if your crits land for 100 damage each? Now you see how dumb your statement is. It *depends*.
---
If they advertise that something is reserved don’t think of it as them being greedy or selfish. Think of it as them being upfront about their intentions. This type of advertising can actually lead to more loot efficient groups because if you don’t need what they are reserving they typically won’t need what you need. 
---
Another thing about reserved loot such a Barrons Mount is that the drop rate is so astronomically low the odds of it dropping are slim to none, 1/5000 if I remember correctly. If somebody has been farming UD strat for the mount they probably don’t need any other drop or have any other interest apart from the mount. Most people don’t care about the mount because it has such a low drop rate so it’s not usually a big deal. But if you are one of those people who want that mount, and are willing to do the potentially thousands of runs to get it, wouldn’t you want to ensure your efforts weren’t in vain? It’s only a problem when people don’t disclose their intentions and just switch to master loot at the very end.
---
Stop clicking your buttons you pleb
---
Because you can do money only with devilsaurs (at lev 60). I don't know your server, but in mine the dell in ah at the same price of vendor npc.
---
As others have said sometimes buying a nice upgrade from AH can definitely be worth the investment (especially for a warrior). So if you already have your mount and have a few G to spare, if you can find a good weapon on AH it will hold you until you get into your end game dungeon runs just fine
---
You won't be able to join a try hard guild but you'll be able to put which is already easy enough.
---
What? Are you trolling or what? 
---
If you have 10% crit, your swings do 100 damage, and you do 10 swings, you are expected to deal 1100 damage, a 10% increase from 0 crit. It is 1% before factoring in the 30% multiplier.
---
that's why you group with other people
---
man, i think i'd prefer that to what happened to me yesterday.
---
found OOX or whatever in tanaris, saw another dude waiting. so i asked for invite and he said 'waiting on my friend.' and then his friend got there a few second later and they started the escort without inviting me to party.
---
Because you picked a game that was not intended to have the end game be leveling. And even if it was intended to be that way, you gave up half way through. The end game in WoW is raiding/pvp and other level 60 activities. If grinding, dungeons, leveling professions, etc is boring then you picked the wrong game. If ONLY questing satisfies your boredom then you picked the wrong game.
---
40-50. Just so grueling
---
You can drink/eat while shadowmelded, so I’m pretty happy with my NElf Hunter.
---
No other people around in those areas, it's pretty lonely. Last level I really grouped up with people was probably duskwood.
---
What do you gain for that rep? Besides that at sweet  sweet hat.
---
Lmao it's 2019 you can sneeze the wrong way and get banned from a country ffs
---
But it's been fun this far with leveling and professions. It's just 40+ that's been a pain in the ass.
---
maybe you forgot to upgrade a  key spell on your action bar?  I have been playing this game for 10 years and I still make that mistake sometimes
---
You were the asshole the first time. Only the first time.
---
Mages are the new hunters. You can quickly tell which mages have been playing mage for a long time, and which ones started playing with classic because they heard they're one of the best classes.
---
Meanwhile like 80% of hunters I see are fucking great because theyve been playing hunter forever.
---
I saw a warrior guide that was just an image. It was just a image, it told you want attacks and abilities you should be using.
---
Seems hilarious :) if he knew you always did this, asked you to stop, and you kept doing it then you would be.
---
Ummmmm it’s just a nice rare to have and you probably will not run across to many others in your server who have him if any.
---
Is it worth the money? I have level 112 skinning, debating if I want to get it up/start skinning mobs from level 35-40 to make gold for my mount- or if I want to drop skinning for alchemy and level up my herbalism more so I can start making my own potions to use/sell and profit from.
---
Can you please make this into a Pastebin so it can be reposted with links?

Haha yeah nah I have triple checked, there's nothing missing.

Sadly you can't anymore. I mean, set them loose in SW to terrorize the auction house bots.
---
Pugs won’t take a sub rogue. Hemo takes up a debuff slot and the dps is very low. They’ll ask him to respec or replace him with another rogue.
---
In the US, what you see on the keyboard is what you get AFAIK. (There’s probably some super cool feature I’m missing)
---
  I know nothing of these wizarding keyboards Europeans and other non-US nations use.  :O

No problem glad I could help!!
---
It's certainly not the most useful profession for a Rogue, but I'm not sure what you require for a profession to be 'viable.'
---
I'd suggest Engineering.

What you have to worry about raiding as a sub is 'miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss .....'

That being said, if DPS throw a shadow bolt at the enemy before you touch it once.. Yeah, you won't have rage
---
They’ll figure it out when bgs are released and the queue for them is hours.
---
Or if everybody in SFK is spawning ghost adds every ten seconds.
---
No path available
---
Love it, and same!
---
The reason it's old is because everyone thinks gender ideology is stupid so everyone repeats the same memes. I agree it's lame but "the right" is everyone right of Stalin nowadays
---
Sure is nice to live in a free society and am able to criticize my government. I'd love for others to have this same opportunity.
---
I got boots of avoidance purple boe from searing whelps in dustwallow on my 46 lock. Super rare lol. Weren't worth too much tho.
---
At lvl 38,39. I just grinded a shit ton. Jungle stalkers in stv behind arena drop a lot of gray loot to vendor, and you can skin them. Also in the badlands just going around killing rock elementals, wolves, birds ect all drop tons of gray loot to vendor.
---
calm down gaylord
---
I prefer windowed mode on my laptop because I can easily click on other things on my toolbar.
---
&gt; Okay then buddy, believe whatever kool-aid Blizzard feeds you.
---
Dude, it's a fact. You were wrong about layering, as was almost everyone else.
---
Just not the same without the buckler.
---
Definitely should not be soloing quests 3+ levels above you, makes it much harder and longer. Look for mobs and quests 2-3 levels below you, you'll easily be able to down them quickly and progress much faster.
---
Surely this is a troll
---
Not sure, but I know anything past 305 is diminishing returns
---
Melee DPs question.
---
Is it best practice for melee DPS classes to be positioned at back of dungeon trash mob that is being tanked, Or does it matter?
---
Thanks man, and grats on BT!
---
My thing is I don’t get these small ass bottles, I literally drink it down in like 3 gulps.
---
Once the novelty wears off it's just your typical community.  People were just happy wow classic was out, now it's just normal, ain't nobody got time for that.  Aoe everything, fuck an invite.  People got money to twink their alts less reliant on others for help.
---
I believe that the primary focus of retail is to milk players with their services, shop pets, toys, mounts, WoW tokens, exclusive offers, etc. While Classic is the pure version where actual genuine WoW fans can congregate.
---
You have heard of borderless windowed right? 😂 surely that little white bar pisses you off. Maybe it’s just my ocd but it drives me crazy.
---
Lulz
---
Take my upvote!!!
---
Good luck tanking without consecrate tho
---
Lol priests don't have leveling issues. Get a good wand and you'r good to go
---
they did but its still cool :D
---
youre absolutely right. its maddening to see people jump to so many extreme's just to try and get a point of fuck china out there. look at these responses. would there have been an apology/explanation that wouldn't get everyone on reddit triggered to the next galaxy? Its clear most of reddit feels one way about it and there's no inbetween despite who is in the right on it.
---
no but just ask for help in LookingForGroup and someone will help you quick especially if you're horde.
---
I’ve never seen any attacks on boats or zeppelins the entire time I’ve been playing classic
---
~~But the juicy deeps on that WW axe...~~   Maybe it's still there, it just shrank down so far it is now inside the glove.
---
The pugs I have been in have level 55s with actually no DPS. I do agree about the debuff slot though. If things go south sub rogue will be the first one of the first ones to be kicked.
---
Not that I'm aware of.
---
This is why we have a lack of tanks.
---
yes they couldve handled it better. no this does not make it worse.
---
Yeah well I can't really see any more of those low level quests either on questie
---
High Fashion
---
If you are out of range or energy, they don't.  In a group, you're often starting on a new target without the energy for a move.
---
I don't have it on ambush.  Good point on backstab though.  I guess you could have two versions of it.
---
Shield slam?
---
You wanna see a screenshot of my played time? I'm fucking terrible at games.
---
Yeah i got some free time because of overtime at work. But now i work again, and dont have that time to level up fast.
---
What a strangely worded response, it felt off reading it. This damage control doesn't do it for me, sorry.
---
Damn, imagine doing all that work and knowing nobody notices or cares.
---
I was questing with another rogue in Tanaris at the pirate compound. We were outnumbered by 8 horde. We weren’t attacked once even though we were competing for mobs. Something about seeing two rogues unstealthing in unison and assclapping mobs makes people say nope
---
A good ST quest run would be far more efficient than ZF.
---
Whats the lifebar UI addon?
---
Ouch.
---
Nah it’s not a big deal. Cone of cold will break the nova while you’re standing right there. It’s honestly better to just nova after all that and just blizzard unless you’re coordinated with all the mages.
---
i had him reinstall and i logged into my computer with his account and its not showing
---
As a tank about to quit and just go Arms full time in preperation for BG's I can confirm.
---
&gt;I see it as a warning to others to not try to turn video game events into political rallies.
---

---
This is the type of content I enjoy haha
---
Think about it like this. If someone is toasting at a wedding and they start going on about politics, is that the place for it? No. Everyone there has a right to their opinions but people are there for the wedding, not political statements.
---
This was a video game tournament where someone decided to make it more than that. Nobody is arguing what he's saying is wrong or that it's wrong to have that opinion. People are arguing that there's a place and time for that kind of speech. a video game tournament isn't a place for political agendas. blizzard merely enforced their rules. I don't like it. I don't agree with it, but as a company blizzard stated the rules beforehand. They were within their power to administer their punishment. The reason people are outraged is because they just think people are being silenced by blizzard. No. Blizzard hosted a game tournament not a political debate.
---
No it's still retarded. All your spells are maybe 50g combined which is less than an hour of play time at max level. The only time you should be foregoing spells is when you're getting your first mount. After that it's retarded to put off having a clutch moonfire or decurse to save you 2 minutes worth of farming.
---
If it's an upgrade, roll need.
---
Days isn't really the best measurement of time assuming you weren't playing for 3 days straight. Hard to tell if your gph was good or bad.
---
This is all too real.
---
Lol @people downvoting this comment
---
Yep 40-50 is tough rn 50-60 is going alright
---
I'm really enjoying that the game feels like an RPG. That being said everyone seems to have far more time to play than  I do - just leveled to 20 yesterday in Darkshore and that zone on my server has been dead for the past week of my slow leveling pace. Honestly, I'd rather play a more focused single player RPG at this point.
---
Slowly grinding alone sucks the fun out of an MMORPG and is the unfortunate consequence of not having the time to grind for hours anymore.
---
"Have fun finding another tank while I instantly find another group"
---
I looked it up, and apparently the special ore for the alliance only quest "favor for Kazak" is the best way to level from 100-125 and beyond
---
This is why I love classic.
---
Not even your faction can see you, unless they're within a few metres of you.
---
Yea. Its demoralizing honestly.
---
It defeats the point of a guild and waters down the LFG market for those seeking to progress, esp during leveling, reserve runs are pointless
---
For me 45-50 is the worst. At 40-45 you get to start out all the good zones, but the rest is just awful. But then again on classic it's not that bad as horde since you have hinterlands quest zone, back on pservers horde had to grind 2-3 levels off mobs in blasted lands mine just to get back to questing.
---
That’s exactly what’d I do mate.
---
You're lumping all of the BoEs together, which is wrong. A BRD run will average out to everyone getting a fair-ish share over time, that's why you can greed everything. If one high value epic drops, it shifts the value of loot distribution dramatically. I bet you'd pass on all the loot in BRD to have one Freezing Band.  
---
It's pointless though; epic BoEs are simply a different thing to normal drops. Pretending they are otherwise is ridiculous; their value is significantly greater than anything else in the instance. Saying they are all worth gold and are thus the same is a flawed argument, because there is such a significant discrepancy in the value of on epic vs the rest.
---
Goes to show that even massive morons can reach his positions within multi-million dollar companies.
---
Congrats.  One thing about classic that I love is that even just leveling can be a challenge.  So its rewarding on its own if you don't wanna run dungeons and explore more.
---
Any ideas how to track who's been hit by Onyxia's Fireball? Am trying to find a method to enter p3 with ideal aggro levels (=off tank is next target). Thanks!
---
He didn't explicitly say it, but looks like he wants to open from stealth with ambush, cheapshot or garrote.
---
I agree with you. 
---
I didn’t see a favourable outcome either way and was frustrated. 
---
On the flip side. I’ve had MORE people come in similar situations. Help me kill the mobs and we party up to share the quest.
---
So I’m very happy with my experiences haha majority of the time the people are cool.
---
This amuses me.
---
Penalty clauses are generally disfavored by courts.
---
Trash
---
I can't even find anyone to play with on my alt never mind steal my chests
---
I heard for bank alts a orc or troll can die in a certain spot and Rez in Orgrimmar, anyone know the location?
---
Just because it's an epic doesn't mean it's all that great. Don't expect to get rich on this.
---
Is your app either beta version or currently saying offline on the top right corner?
---
CoC its bad mana/damage ration, blizzard is way better, you can't throw enough CoC to finish a elite group of your level, you are out of mana before they hit 50%
---
Grats! Got mine after spamming Eagle Eye for 6 hours! Such is the life when you don't know when he last despawned - there was another hunter (ok several but only one that was at all friendly) who I told right when I got mine so he would be able to spawn in around the time Broken Tooth would be back up. That felt rewarding as hell!

You haven’t tried getting the hardened tumor from the Murlocs in silverpine yet

“Recently I came up with an amazing idea” 
---
Go fuck yourself, there’s literally a YouTube channel called Generate Task where someone’s been doing this on OSRS for a while
---
Thank you!
---
Buy 2 greater magic essence off the Auction house and ask for minor beastslayer enchant. Most ppl will do for free
---
I can hear you clicking your max rank abilities while you single target mobs from here!
---
So how did you recently come up with the idea then?
---
Saves more time then doing a corpse run.
---
I pretty much run out of mana regardless if single target or AOE..
---
And your money
---
Ohh yeah sourkraut octoberfest rammstein!
---
Capcom showed backbone with MHW in China.  They wanted to censor the game and Capcom told them to fuck off, more or less.
---
https://youtu.be/Xob9U2eMk_I
---
haha no i havent i dont think i can take another quest like this lol
---
Why wouldn’t you just LOS the casters? You realize counterspell is on a 30 second cooldown, right? You can only use it on one mob.
---
Poor you :(
---
Your guild will deserve you. Take your time, play the char (s) that you enjoy. Try new classes, races till you find what you are looking for. There is no rush. Guilds and players are always evoluating, there is a spot for everyone.
---
"We found out the hard way China is a much smaller percentage of our market cap than all of the people who we pissed off and cancelled subs and preorders. Please let us lie about the situation so we can get your money back."
---
Missed out on a ZUG ZUG :(
---
I did this on my first character back in vanilla and it haunted me through the rest of the expansions. I also found it not worth.
---
You are incorrect. Patch 1.11.2 introduced respec cost decay.
---
Okay I’ve been researching this for the last couple of days. So weapon skill is incredibly important to hit rating. At 300 weapon skill it take 9% hit gear; but at 305 weapon skill it will take only 6% hit gear. For warriors only orcs and humans have racial passives that put them to 305 weapon skill. Once your go past 305 there is diminishing returns on weapon skill until approximately 317 (which is hard to get and not super efficient). 
---
This increases the value of weapon skill to nonhuman nonorc warriors. So I can’t tell you when to sell it or for how much. But I do recommend selling it.
---
&gt;Hunters and Rogues really trying to push this narrative now lol.
---
And tanks.... yknow because we're the ones who have to deal with mages.
---
I usually let them die. I only like 1 mage in my group for water/food and poly...
---
For sure, same on my end. Been there too, where it is clear someone is just not interested in being a 'team player's and had to really fight the urge to be snarky as hell. I will say after hours of camping for Broken Tooth my tolerance for people joking (unprovoked) about killing him just to not let me have mine was waning for sure...
---
Is he a HK sympathizer?
---
I was killing turtles in Hillsbrad, close to Tarren Mill, where I noticed a 29 paladin attacking a 21 undead warrior. It actually looked like the warrior was winning, too! I felt dirty interceding on the paladin’s behalf, but I also would have felt shitty not helping a fellow Alliance in PvP.
---
I’m thinking the same thing, wanting to stay arms for the PVP aspect of the server and solo farming, but getting some bonus Prot stats for dungeons and off tanking MC.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/warrior-talents/?tal=0230502135251000110500000000000000005203100400000000
---
This is what I was thinking
---
It’s more just looking at how many green/ yellow quests there are... if there’s only one or two yellow quests then I’d pick a diff zone to lvl in that has more quests at your range. 
---
Wpp is good money since almost every mob has a great drop table.  Not a bad place to grind.
---
Yeah, you could even defeat with nothing but shadow word pain, running in circles and the occasional renew.
---
Lmao I love this.
---
If he is wanting to make use of remorseless, he would do ambush from stealth, or sini strike most likely.  Cheap/Garrote are not influenced by Remorseless.
---
^ this dude created the original Generate Task idea and spreadsheet. Stop trying to take credit for other people’s ideas
---
That has the same viuals as this one. So its 100% original idea that op had
---
It astonishes me how many people don't understand what LoS means. Also blows my mind that mages would start casting Blizzard while a tank is body pulling.
---
Where is this blacklist???
---
If the guild requires that for MC, then its not a good guild.
---
Is there a good place to find information on how much BoE items sell for on the AH if there are none listed on your server's AH?
---
Seize the means of enchanting, comrade
---
the fuck are you raid that requires all that?
---
What’s wrong with greeding here?
---
It’s not needed at all to have consumes, content is clearable with low lvls, even onyxia can be 3 manned.
---
Omg this is my server too I love the salt
---
Probably just habit after that.
---
By the time you hit 45 you can be back up to 60-80g+ through fairly simple quest grinding/selling trash &amp; greens. At that point I'll go back and grab anything useful I may have skipped on.
---
Yeah one of my guildies is a rogue who needed both last night, both dropped and he won both rolls over two warriors
---
I mean I am one of these "veterans" as is my guild and had this discussion in discord last night to much confusion. Are you EU or US? There seems to be a bit of deviation, even tho we also have US players
---
Why is it the job of the casters to enforce the rules of blizzard?  The rules that specifically list the bannable conduct to be "at blizzard's sole discretion."  It would be interesting to read their contracts but I'm willing to bet there was nothing in it granting them the authority to make such a determination.
---
Not trying to plug, but this was definitely an excellent "excuse" to unsub and try out a TBC private server I've been having my eye on.
---
People are free to spend their money how they want, but I don't feel right giving a subscription to a company that couldn't give any less of a shit about me.
---
I got flame weave cuffs of intellect and said fuck it.
---
Tries to do one through ElvUI and while it felt better I didn’t like the style at all.
---
Tank: Gonna gather up some mobs please don't AoE until I have them all grouped up.
---
Tank pulls 2 out if 10 mobs in room.
---
Mage: START BLASTING!!
---
Tank stops pulling to deal with two mobs heading to mage.
---
Mage: PULL MORE!! Why you only pulling two!?
---
TSM AuctionDB
---
do they all have to be text based? You could take really close up screenshots of some lantern or rug nearby and let the others figure it out
---
It's still bugged by intention to protect low levels, isn't it?
---
You could use my guide: Spam tank dungeons and spec to make it go faster/easier. you'll be 60 when you're done.
---
I have pretty good internal timings from playing SC2, I don’t need to check it that often.
---
You are correct, but you worded your argument very weirdly until now. The AP equivalent for hit/crit is dependent on each other. The more crit you get, the more valuable hit becomes, and vice versa, and is also dependent on dozens of other variables. However it’s fairly obvious that a 20/16 ratio is not accurate.
---
It's a thousand times better than what a lot of companies are doing. People are short-sighted sometimes. The important thing is they realized their mistake and corrected it. Compared to what Blizzard is doing right now with egg all over their face, that's actually pretty awesome.
---
That’s pretty messed up, hopefully they do something about the reporters after your temp chat ban is lifted.  
---
Good luck
---
I mean if you really love warriors so much, push it to 40. You get Mortal Strike and you may find it much more enjoyable from then
---
Has anyone seen Biznick's scope (3% hit) yet?
---
TSM doesn't even have any data for it yet, but it seems incredibly unlikely that it hasn't dropped once in all of NA
---
I was making around 11-12g /hr when I wasn't fighting for mobs. And when the price of the item fluctuated I made more. I was farming elemental fire. 
---
 When I first started they were 1.3g on my server, the next day I was selling them for 3g ea. 
---
 So the second day I was making like 20+g/hr
---
&gt;Guy broke rules regardless of how you want to look at it.
---
That rule states that it's at Blizzard sole discretion.  Just like with the AU stream, they could have chosen to do nothing.
---
Wouldn't that be when you say g2g then?
---
Dude some reading comprehension would suit you really well. I never claimed it would having the heart would have an impact on leveling speed, that would be idiotic. It's an incredibly strong item for druids when tanking! I specifically said heart+armor rings+warden staff actually are the biggest power spike for tanking (!) Druids. As far as leveling is concerned there are no huge power boosts for druids, remember that were not speaking of warriors here.
---
Back to the initial argument, not leveling a profession first that you intent to drop anyway(aka enchanting) after you got what you want(aka heart, aka bis trinket) is a huge waste of time and resources.
---
I didn't have to spell it all out for you letter by letter, had you actually payed any attention.
---
Oh god golden sansam is even more horrifying. It's sometimes completely overlapped by native grass
---
You’re guild requires all of that? Damn I was complaining that I was forced to bring 4 fire pots and 2 arcane elixirs
---
Me big sad, me get MC off boat.
---
Lol not saying anything new...creating multiple sub cultural group identities as apposed to a shared cultural identity creates more and more conflict in the shared living area.
---
You're not wrong. I'm playing a Mage over lv 30 for the first time (now 51) and have been following a guide for talents. I've only just returned to the frost tree after getting clearcasting and am finally going to get shatter as it suggests.
---
I have been AoE'ing in dungeons when the time called for it. CoC, Nova, back that ass up and Blizzard. (with the 3/3 improved blizz for 70% slow) If you're going to AoE, go for maximum control so you don't make the tank miserable.
---
I'm in the process of getting shy rotam
---
7) They start attacking while you're in the middle of gathering up mobs so you have to stop gathering and then they complain that you aren't pulling enough mobs.
---
Boycott blizzard you spineless losers. There are literally people dying for freedom and you’re over here playing a stupid game made by a company kneeling to their Chinese overlords.. sad. Not to mention they literally rereleased an exact game to steal your money lol real creative their bliz...
---
#BoycottBlizzard
---
Huh?
---
Shadow weaving is a fair ways down the shadow tree
---
Like paladins with reckoning I guess but more powerful as none soloed kazzak with a windfury chain.
---
The moral of the story is, you can break the rules as long as your opinion is popular enough.
---
The other day in UBRS I got this gem: “mages are doing their jobs tanks and healers do urs”. puglife
---
Leveling in a nutshell
---
Farming lbrs for the archmage pattern requires soloing 3 elites, but that's about it.
---
Frost Shock!!
---
Isn't false reporting a bannable offense?
---
He literally said he was taking forever to kill mobs.
---
Meh. I don't train Puncture armor or w/e the rogue move is called at all cause it just overrides sunder armor. Its useless for the way I play anyway. I honestly play a rogue more like a warrior.
---
Is TBC classic confirmed? I keep seeing people say this over and over on these forums.
---
What bullshit.
---
They still have yet to denounce the statement, WHICH IS AN OFFICIAL BLIZZARD STATEMENT, about this being SPECIFICALLY DONT TO DEFEND THE PRIDE OF CHINA. 
---
So. Yea. I dont think this helps in any way.
---
I am so against this crazy over reach of China, that I gave up my favorite game in the whole world. WoW/Classic.
---
Close to 30k hours played over 15 years....its been fun.
---
I've looked myself and from whirlwind axe to around late 40s theres not exactly a ton of options. A slight, slight upgrade is Bonebiter from the SM quest (ally only), but other than that I think the early 40s is kind of dry for 2h.
---
The funny thing is I thought I wanted classic. And I do. When a group goes smoothly it's awesome. But too many bad twitch gamers who just want to go go go pull pull pull are ruining the experience for me. If they want to play that style of game I don't understand why they don't just go play retail since that's how all the dungeons are. Retail is designed and built around the millenial twitch gamer and yet they insist on playing classic and ruin the game.
---
Maybe I'm nice by nature, like some people are just hot by nature.
---
Whitemane's House?
---
great idea! Yah we have a discord i can use to share screenshots
---
I highly recommend leveling arms if you arn't, and getting 5/5 tactical mastery as soon as possible.  Then swap between stances as needed for various abilities.
---
Tanking at lower levels is tough, but the mobs besides VC just don't hit that hard honestly.  Most leather/mail characters can easily off tank an elite without dying, so I don't worry about them pulling off me. I just focus on making sure the healer survives, and taunting if a dps gets low on health.  
---
You are always going to be rage starved, and desperately trying to get aggro on yourself.  This honestly wont change a ton until the 30s, when you get Sweeping Strikes, and later Whirlwind.  Then you can 2h tank by charging, SS, Whirlwinding, and then swapping to Shield in defensive stance.  This glues mobs to you really well.  
---
A small, but super useful thing to have also is a weapon swap macro.  I switch to my 2h'er when there is only 1-2 mobs, or an easy pack as I get a lot more rage from the hits.    Get used to that and it goes a lot better.
---
But still, tanking at these levels is tough, but besides VC himself, every fight in there is easy. 95% of it is stopping runners and smart pulls.
---
While it sells for more gold later, that's because the purchasing power of gold goes down throughout classic. So you can buy roughly the same amount of stuff with 400g it's worth now that you can when its worth 800g in the future.
---
Ever hunter gets a nice Frost Shock to the face.  Oh, you though you'd run off, huh? :)
---
That's why. Nobody likes druids untill atleast lvl 20. Untill you get all your forms, decent gear and some telents distributed into getting your cat dps up, druids aren't really that good.
---
EU, and I play mostly with people from original 2005 vanilla days, so I would say people aged in their thirties
---
We get it. You like Turmp and love when people try to turn every event into a political rally.
---
Some of us like that stuff kept out of the gaming industry.
---
It is possible to think that what Blizzard does was right, and to think what China is doing in HK, Taiwan, and other places is reprehensible at the same time.
---
I know that's hard for some of you virtue-signaler, karma farmers to accept, but it's the truth.
---
I feel like the warrior should have rezzed him and then  his friend
---
Easy solution, get out of the fucking discord and just play the god damn game. Stop posting discord nobody gives a fuck
---
Been tank since Vanilla.
---
Got to 55 on my Warrior and literally deleted him for the name and retooled a Rogue.
---
I'm done dealing with the idiots, I'm not babysitting bad players all Classic.
---
110% that a support ticket will fix that for you, blizzard support is amazing. It may take 24h or so for them to answer it, so do it right now :) you may play and level up to level 20 in the mean time. Gl
---
Yeah like less than 5% of players will, or if they are their group sucks lol.
---
Naw it's just an assumption
---
What guild?
---
Needs more Jujus.
---
Exactly, I can't run off, otherwise a trap wouldnt be relevant, would it!
---
All political views are fine as long as we agree with them and they mean profit for us.
---
You're not.
---
It says that even if you're level 20?
---
I'd say yes they are getting more rude. The other day I was leveling in redridge with my sister on our alts, and this mage came up and asked if she could group with us but I politely declined. Then I got incessantly flamed with slurs and the whole deal.
---
Yeah, it can definitely be frustrating.  I've grown used to having to explain stuff in pugs and have made macros for it.
---
Let me tell you about another situation that happened in the same pug group as above when heading into live side from the side entrance:
---
Me:  Waiting for abomination PAT, 1 sec.
---
Mage:  *starts spamming frostbolt to pull abomination*
---
Me:  *uses taunt to get aggro from frostbolt spam*
---
Abomination:  *uses knockback on tank causing aggro drop and starts attacking mage*
---
Me:  *no rage, no taunt, and lots of eye rolling*
---
The mage then dies of course and blames me for not keeping aggro.
---
This entire example is a worse case, but this stuff does happen regularly enough to be notable.
---
&gt;Fuccboi
---
Names like that are 100% against any RP naming rules though. Why would you roll on a RP server and then act like that? Even Trolololo is clearly against RP naming policy.
---
Care to show me a log of a "good guild" without those consumables?
---
Oh alright. Not sure if I can take the leveling again, already spent like 20 hours to 12
---
do you have any reliable sources? i heard in my guild that you should not use the sword from baron in strath e. g., because the debuff kicks off other debuffs when it procs
---
got that big dick energy.
---
I didn’t know how much I needed this until now
---
I already have Choker of the Firelord from a PUG. I need like 4 more items from raiding total.
---
Still wonder why do you waste your time on gray mobs/waste others time that trying to do that warrior quest
---
Aren't you the cutest little thing!?
---
certainly not this mage! look at my deeps! noob tank cant stay alive lol!!
---
Yeah it is. Hopefully something is done.
---
Inflation
---

You live bravely

agree, my guild is pretty average, but we cleared MC in one night, with only 1 wipe, the only REQ was to be there on time
---
The RNG drop quests are annoying as hell.
---
I just lay back and become a clicker haha. Way less stressful.
---
Just watch some videos on YouTube for druid pvp or raiding. That's what you have to look forward too. 
---
 It's really not that bad. Once u hit 20 leveling will fly by with no downtime being due to passive Mana Regen while in shapeshifting form, and being able to pop out and heal.
---
Yeah I bought devilsaur gloves and legs while leveling to equip them asap, spent 315g on them by level 55. Still had over 350g when I hit 60 and had my epic mount a week later. I'm not some money making guru, never got any great boes, sold two blues for like 5g each. Just don't spend money on dumb shit, loot everything, and anything that's worth more than vendor price mail to a level 5 bank alt to ah or de.

I wanted to confirm that you have to kill mobs to get xp, and with the right add-on you should see the quests that are available to you. As a priest killing mobs should not be harder than another class. But you can easily join groups and heal your way to 60.
---
I never were a big quester and never enjoyed leveling that much. But endgame is always rewarding and fun. Sometimes you have to just grind xp as you can and then the endgame is pure joy.
---
I have 75 gold now at 37. Been selling heavy skin and above on AH for 50 silver profit versus vendor. Rest I have sold to vendor.
---
I have also refused to skill up most of my skills. I have 2-3 skills that is max level. The rest of level one only. I have probably saved 10 gold with not buying skill ups. 
---
I refuse to ding 40 without being able to buy the mount instantly. And I am confident that I will be able to do it:)
---
Perfect solution to getting brigaded in-game, absolutely perfect.

a friend did it by grinding fused wirings in STV

I was gonna say congrats but then I saw you are a gnome.
---
Ill tell you another 'dirty secret' I pull when the healer has mana, but I don't care if the dps has mana.  I've pulled groups when the mages are at a quarter mana and drinking, so they can't just blow all their mana in 2 seconds before I even get a sunder off.

elemental fire goes for 3g20-4g on Razorgore EU

Yes, I know both. But killing mobs below my level takes 20 seconds, I've heard that's a lot?

Whether or not it's the best thing for classic, Activision Blizzard will absolutely look into cashing in on an expansion.

New content keeps subscribers coming. Down the same joke again.
---
As a tank, I often gst frustrated with a healer buddy of mine who never does this. Often he will heal other members and let me get too low or even die in the mean time....he's always got full mana though....
---
I understand that my opinion may be negative on this, and I'm aware of other social media outlets and this sort of thing popping up on them too. Our culture seeking approval and needing to document every aspect of our lives is a whole other conversation and not something I want to debate on the internet.
---
However, you seem like you've already classified me in your own terms, so there's really no point in trying to have a discussion with you about my post since you've generalized my post and taken it upon yourself to believe this is how I act in all situations.
---
Yeah, we should just let the sub be overrun with low effort shitposts
---
It doesn't increase per value you have, but like I showed earlier, with 10% miss chance you get a flat 1.11% dps increase on autos. With 10% hit and 305 weaponskill you still have what is it, 15 % miss chance?

---
just under 3 hours
---
Ah yeah you’re right, I misread the original question. I’m the crazy one here, my bad
---
Sucks that blizzard has to get involved because people are abusing game mechanics. And getting hold of a gm is impossible, if they even exists anymore.
---
Yeah good luck trying to LoS at the first few scarlet packs in Strat. Especially when ppl start dpsing the second u pull.
---
You’re prone to aggro other mobs if you tanking them where they stand. You also risk an eye of naxxramas spawning on top of another pack. It’s probably the only dungeon that benefits greatly from range pulling
---
I would legitimately like to be seated next to this fine fellow at a dinner party.  There is nothing worse than being in the orbit of someone who can only talk about themselves and look for praise for mediocre accomplishments.

---
Warden scans for it. How do you know otherwise? It happened after D3 had crazy bots
---
Yes, let's celebrate mediocrity.

My plan is combat till 50 or so then full assassination and sub. The sub talent that lets your refresh cooldowns is a pvp nightmare

Full pugs are already clearing MC with people with 0 pots or even bis pre raid gear,

Mc isnt a big deal

I see. You can't argue the points, so you attack.

Pretty typical of those trying to push forward fake outrage.

I'll just report your post as harassment and move on.

Enjoy the rest of your day. Please let us know when your attacks against Blizzard actually do anything to help Hong Kong.

That was fucking fantastic.

Exactly.

It really does!

&gt;buff you after jumping off the Zeppelin so you die
---
wat?
---
You actually can but those potions are in charge to help compensate mistakes
---
Well that all depends on your definition of "good guild" (which I assume is gonna be something like &lt;30 min clear or some other ridiculous standard like that).
---
I mean im only 40 rn on my priest but ive yet to find a tank who is oblivious to my mana. usually I hate inviting mages because everyone is waiting on them to drink after every pull. I got spirit for days I barely need to drink.
---
Im summary:
---
Blah blah blah, we're so great.
---
Blah blah blah, we're returning the prize money - totally not to cater to you though ok?
---
Blah blah blah, we're super free speech, but the casters let the winner have free speech for five seconds so we're suspending them.
---
Blah blah blah, we are absolutely *not* influenced by China... hmm? What apology to the Chinese government? Oh *damn* we're out of time.
---
I've resisted posting these things (for the most part), but many of us don't have anyone IRL to discuss this game with.  This community is the only place we can go to get our e-ego stroked and have people understand what we're talking about.  I'm a bit sick of it too- especially the "hit level 60 by discovering stormwind" trend, but just keep scrolling past (or downvote) the posts you have a problem with.
---
&gt;However, you seem like you've already classified me in your own terms, so there's really no point in trying to have a discussion with you about my post since you've generalized my post and taken it upon yourself to believe this is how I act in all situations.
---
I believe people are more complex than one action, but that's a whole other conversation. But let's see. If you see something you dont like that is not outright illegal or well grossly in breach of rules, do you scroll past or complain? Can it be more complex?
---
I don't have friends that play wow, but I also don't feel compelled to share a picture of me dinging level 40 like it's a Facebook post.
---
I'm actually very like minded to the people posting, we're playing the same video game. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't a fan of WOW. 
---
Not sure how that makes me a "fucking loser" though, but good job on resorting to name calling instead of taking some time to post something worthwhile.
---
Across multiple Activision Blizzard games and many years, I've never once seen report abuse lead to any punishment.

Nothing's wrong with my brain, you on the other hand can't comprehend basic mathematical concepts.

Probably 70s per herb unstacked

If you have to ask you can't afford it.

In the first weeks it was fine. But now it really is starting to get annoying.
---
Arcanite bars are being bought because 3 horde guilds have Eye of Sulfuras
---
Most good tanks are in good guilds and don't play with randoms often, so it's pretty common for people to have never played with good players.
---
If you're not trying to improve and noticing tons of mistakes you're making constantly, then you're not good.
---
Apes doesn't require you to bring 20 mongoose when you only need 2 in a raid with them..
---
My guild requires this for MC.  My guild is run by children who only care about DPS and logs.  My guild had 3 accidental pulls in the middle of strategy discussion, a wipe on Lucifron wiping all consumables and world buffs, and several other trash mishaps from skipping trash mobs that we pulled later, even in a boss fight.
---
I think my guild should concentrate more on a smooth run than emulating what top tier guilds do.  But no lifers will no life, and never learn to think for themselves.  It will be good to move to a better guild for BWL when my shit guild breaks up.
---
I guess this is enough for semi HC guilds. You’re still missing juju’s, Scorpok Assay and Roids which is pretty significant. And you’re probably not going for Songflower either.
---
How would you define "good guild" based on anything other than performance?
---
It's just nice to be able to drop form and moonfire to instant instead of having to chase when a mob is running towards others, it certainly feels like it has saved me from pulling more ads by doing that
---
Saving this for later so I can jam out during the last six bubbles of 59.
---
This is the true answer.  MC does not require consumables.  MC requires coordination.  The end.
---
420, nice
---
**In the old Days**
---
40+ used to be when you would first start forming guilds, as leveling slows down, and people start catching up in larger numbers.
---
By the 50's things get real slow, and in the old old days alliances would start forming between guilds.  Like we used x-guilds pally more than own own, but they seem to always have our 2ndary tank in some instance with them.
---
So to answer your question **how did you enjoy 40-60?** the answer is _socially_.
---
Reaching 60 was like reaching a social vista where you knew the names of most the leading players on most the leading teams already.  I believe the first windfury was forged from the contributions of 8-16 separate guilds working together.

Onyxia was 3manned with naxx geared ppl. Of course the content isnt hard but i understand ppl want the best Performance to clear the id it asap. Also it helps compensating the more casual playing ppl who may be unexperiented

Look at you on your high horse. I’ve never been to a house in America that didn’t have a cheese grater. And there is no such thing as a cheese shredder.

Slacking on gears, rotation, .... Maybe reality is thougher than what people say. It's not a race. Go one goal at a time. One step ahead, one quest at the time, we all get there.
---
I've seen a bunch on this sub.
---
I can't understand how people play like that. It would be like pulling teeth. So much effort and so God damn slow
---
Some people can't drink tap water where they live...
---
This was before that happen. There was none yet
---
Im on horde, so bonebiter isnt an option. Theres also a weapon from rfd that drops from a rare spawn at 13% and the uldaman weapons that both drop at 13% but that seems to be about it. I was hoping someone would be like "theres this quest chain in feralas" or "blacksmiths can usually make this and this for pretty cheap"
---
That's not true at all. Every Paladin I've ever created has wore T2 mog the moment after I've created them.
---
Only some items have level requirements. Some don't.
---
Dunno why the guild wants you to bring 20 mongoose when you max need 5 for a raid, but in terms of what consumes they want, that's fairly normal, I'd even say you are lucky you can use giants and firewater instead of the juju's.
---
Lmao that’s just his bank you dunce. Obviously he’s not going to use them all for 1 raid.
---
Right? I see every mage with it, it seems like
---
If you jump off the Zeppelin you should land eithy like 5% health.  Fortitude increases your max health but doesnt actually increase your current health.  so you end up at like 92% hp after being buffed and since fall damage is percent based, you die.  So people will see you about to jump and give you the stam buff so you hurl yourself to your death.
---
I'm on my alt as well after hitting 60.
---
Dungeons are noticeably more toxic and there's way more magetards than there were early on.
---
CRUSHIM!!
---
It's their responsibility to farm their own shit, not OP's responsibility to let them.  
---
You sound like a retail player.
---
I found holy to be more enjoyable than playing the slot machine that is SoC. I also accepted early on that Paladin leveling wasn't going to be fast to start with.
---
Absolutely not, and you should keep on doing it until he realizes!
---
Never played DaOC but I did play it's successor, WAR Online.
---
Miss those days.
---
Top kek
---
True, but I don’t mind the grind. Once I get it, it will feel very satisfying
---
Its like a Backup to help clean the content with new people who may Not be this experiented. In later runs we prob wont need those
---
If that's what you believe, then you're contradicting yourself by calling me "one of those people..." based off of one action (my post). I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused on what you're trying to get across to me. 
---
I guess you just don't agree with my opinion (which is totally fine, I expected resistance on this) and you should leave it at that, but of course you can't and you need to lump me into some negative social group and then pretend you're taking the high road.

Yayyyy someone who understands

Prices will change unpredictably, and nobody really knows for sure if prices will go up or go down (however it is likely that prices will increase as more gold is available in-game).  Keep in mind that just because something is listed on the AH for 400g doesn't mean that they're "going for" that.  I could list a 6 month old box of discontinued cereal on Ebay for $10,000 and CNN might do a news story on it.  That doesn't mean that box of cereal is worth $10,000...it just means that I'm an asshole.

In 5 mans the mages end up tanking anyway.

its hard to get in contact with them since they have a 4 day wait time.

WTB frames
---
The problem with this in pugs is that some healers are bad and can’t heal multi targets at once, and some mages are bad and will die with ice block off cd. If I knew my mage and healer were good, then I’d be down. I’ve gotten blamed too many times for ‘not holding aggro’ from mages that pull and fuck up their rotation and escape
---
Or you can not spend hours clearing MC and do it fast with consumes
---
I also noticed the lower level zones are dead on thunderfury when I went back to level up my herbalism after hitting 40. I wonder if that's an indicator of the future, or is it just for right now since many people want to get their main to 60?
---
Just hit 55 and it seems like it’s going to take forever. Good thing there are dungeons to do and get interesting gear useful at 60 so the endgame is kinda starting now
---
20s because of lakeshire. Over camped but it may be better now.
---
Great editing, makes this video that much better.
---
Terrible advice for a warrior tho. Green quests are your bread and butter.
---
More of this please.
---
Cost nothing? Level enchant to 300, craft the arcanite Rod, buy/farm crusader recipe and alll the other good ones. Raid to get +heal or +spellpower. 
---
It's the same as saying a locksmith shouldn't be payed because he opens a lock within five sec. There's a lot of preparation to be able to do that.

Everyone is mentally afk running ubrs since it's so easy and boring. Probably only 1 or 2 dps per run are trying.
---
40-46 felt like it took a fuck ton but 50-60 was pretty enjoyable as prot.
---
In the hands of a competent mage 100% agree. But pugging is full of all sorts, and I find with this new aoe meta I find a lot of poor mages who don’t understand how to do this correctly. Running up to mobs before gathered and spamming arcane explosion for instance, not iceblocking or nova etc. One of the best runs I had was in scholo with two fantastic mages who controlled every pack. But pugs are so random that imo I’d rather not have the headache if I’m tanking or healing.
---
I feel you about the amount of direction, im searching for a guide to look for guidance, not for following
---
If the tank goes down we wipe so yeah if you really want to make things go smoothly, hit the skull and quit worrying about topping the charts in a fucking 5 man lol
---
This makes me want to have a character on a RP server
---
Weapon skill helps greatly against raid bosses.  As warrior/rogue you're borderline required to have +5 weapon skill with your current weapon.. against a bos-level enemy or a mob 3 levels higher (basically raid mobs) it translates inderectly into 3% to hit and a bunch of other staff (like reduced glancing blow penalty)
---
In this case, I'd advertise in trade chat to sell "cheaper than AH" and sell it for 5g cheaper than the lowest one in AH.  Or since there's 5 you could just hang on and wait for a later time when there's less competition.  5 of one BiS item on the AH is a buyers market, and you're right to want to stay out of the undercut war.  I'd do the trade chat thing and let it go for 380, and if that doesn't work after a few attempts, just put it in the bank and sell it after DM releases.
---
Haven't played sham since pservers but I personally would choose natures swiftness even with current spell batching trick for guaranteed shock crit.    Another free cast is still really good burst / it can be used to save yourself or an ally from certain death/ using it for burst damage instead of a shock leaves earth shock open for interrupts after your burst.
---
I don't heal mages who pull aggro ... Let them die then kick them from group
---
It’s not.
---
Oooh i get it.
---
Also the Bubble HS macro of course.
---
I think I've seen at least a dozen posts of people getting Edgemasters drops
---
If your guild makes so many mistakes that you need to compensate with tons of consumables on everyone then it’s not a good guild. The only reason to consumable is if you’re trying to speed run the place.
---
Why do you think it's cheating?
---
Lmao I will enchant 30sp crusader 4stats all free, as well as craft your arcabite reaper for free. Your mats ;)
---
Well ive never run into the problem of a healer getting zerged by mobs literally ever when theres a mage involved, they just do way too much aoe threat.
---
Ahh I misunderstood. That makes sense. Who else started dropping HoJ in patch 1.9 btw?
---
I played fury all through vanilla and BC, sometimes agro just happens.
---
The way I play is to dot everything up, then fear where they die before they come back to me. I haven't hard cast a shadowbolt in a long time so the only lock out problem is when I cast fear, which isn't a huge concern since it is typically cast before they get in melee range of me. If they are one of the few mobs with a range silence I just play around it and get them to silence immolate instead. I don't play in dungeons so I just buy the skills I use in my normal solo play.

My husband was working on realm best challenge mode times with his friends at midnight a month before my due date and I told him he had to take me to the hospital and he told his friends he would brb in a few hours because he thought I wasn’t actually going into labor lol.
---
Well you've taken the time to make this post, so you feel strongly about it to do that at least. 
---
As I said, scroll past and move on works the best for me. You SUBJECTIVELY do not appreciate a fluff post, just like I SUBJECTIVELY don't appreciate this sort of post. 
---
Agree to disagree and move on with your life.
---
Which is what I'll do now ;) You lured me in!
---
Is this like the "afk cat on fire" for grownups?
---
Being good has nothing to do with consumables. Tryhard or competitive is better description.
---
Thats How it should be let people tip if they want to tip
---
And ofcourse you cant afford an epic mount on your alt. Feelsbadman
---
You should be level 60 spending that time so very understandable. But I'd just follow one of all alliance leveling guides. Everything is so much smoother.
---
Well, you did say: 
---
&gt;"It's tank bis at any level, for the armour alone."
---
as a counter point to: 
---
&gt;"The +7 resistances and 3% DR will not be noticeable while leveling."
---
You followed that up with: 
---
&gt;"It absolutely doesn't matter though, getting a bis item before you're even 60 is worth quite a lot."
---
My reading comprehension appears to be just fine.  You were placing high value on it during the leveling process.  Now you're agreeing with me that it has little value during the leveling process.
---
&gt;Back to the initial argument, not leveling a profession first that you intent to drop anyway(aka enchanting) after you got what you want(aka heart, aka bis trinket) is a huge waste of time and resources.
---
LOL, *what?* I was *not* saying you should drop Enchanting after crafting Heart of the Mountain.  I was saying to level with Skinning or Herbalism to sell the mats, and then drop that profession for Enchanting at 60.  There is no downside to doing it that way.  Bank your quest rewards.  Mail the BOEs to an alt.  Drop Skinning at 60, pick up Enchanting.  DE all the mats you were holding onto, and you've lost nothing of value.  Bonus for making money on skins/herbs, not having to skimp on Resto spells, and you're not nerfing your travel speed by 50% for 5+ levels because you're incredibly broke from trying to level with Enchanting.
---
As a leveling tank only I don’t care who pulls aggro. I write this in chat before every dungeon: 
---
“I will try to keep aggro in all mobs as good as I can. I will use taunt on cool down. Do what you want and play how you want. No need for tactics before we really need it”
---
And it seems to work. It’s often extremely chaotic and stressful for me but I survive:)
---

---
&gt;evel enchant to 300, craft the arcanite Rod, buy/farm crusader recipe and alll the other good ones. Raid to get +heal or +spellpower
---
Im trying my best :(
---
100g is 100g, and I expect I’ll get at least that much for it.

Ok but why would you pretend if it happens all you gotta do is taunt when that's not actually possible? Quit making shit up

ELI5

Then quantify for me what makes a good guild.
---
I often see him in Desolace
---
I’m definitely leaning towards the DM release. I’m level 52, with only 125g. I haven’t been considering even getting my epic mount for at least another month or so. I think that one of the above posters could be correct in saying that people don’t have a ton of gold right now. I’m guessing with DM release more people will be earning more gold and able to afford more BiS. Since this gold will be going to my epic mount, I think it may be best to see where the market goes with it here in a week or two.
---
you talk to people
---
Asking slow tanks to pull is like lighting a fuse on a stick of dynamite.

Its a brand NEW group and You dont know the skill level of each Player so we will see
---
Thanks! I'll add this to the post.
---
&gt;I also noticed the lower level zones are dead on thunderfury when I went back to level up my herbalism after hitting 40. 
---
Literally one of the reasons why Blizzard made it so easy to level once you hit higher levels. So eveyone wasn't in deserted zones.
---
Haha, I asked because yesterday a dude said exactly the same thing and left the group. A few moments later we saw him entering SM with other people

Actually you make no Quest progress in a Raid at all.

But this is why i like TBC, i can do the dailys with my girl and still Raid.

I just got the Skull of Impending Doom. I was wondering what kind of macros people use to use the skull in PVP. The one I made is below. Can it be improved? I want to click it once to easily equip the skull and then click it again to activate it and then switch weapons.

/equip Skull of Impending Doom

/use Skull of Impending Doom

Yeah you're also taking things a bit too seriously. Still a game with simple dungeons no need to get that undone over another player's ability.

Glad to see that agreeing to disagree seems to be where we both end up on this topic. Thanks for your points, have a good one!

The thing is, then the mage gets mad that you didn’t hold aggro. If you want aggro go ahead. But don’t be mad at me if I can’t get to you and you die

Then dont call them a “good guild” if you dont know that its a “good guild”
---
Pretty funny.
---
wow more fake outrage for clicks.  Nice job man.  I'm like so amazed.  You are THE MAN
---
Bars don't sell for 80g lol they've hovered around 40-60g
---
I’ve noticed in dungeons people are a lot less patient, especially while leveling up my alt. I’ve had so many people rage about tank/healer not playing how they want them too it’s crazy. People would rather yell or just leave the group then try to help and instruct people.
---
Cool bruh. You too.
---
I haven't read the patch notes for 1.9, so I don't know. I just read the old comments on Hand of Justice since I remembered it dropping from Emperor twice during vanilla.
---
TBC before times
---
Agreed. Encourage and uplift the community, don’t shame people for being proud of their accomplishments in this game.
---
lol
---
Large increase in hit chance against raid enemies when you get 305 weapon skill (basically +3% hit) as well as some smaller stuff that translates into largest DPS increase you can get from gauntlets unless you\`re human with sword(s) or orc with axe(s).
---
it's the one with all the people using the Spy addon
---
Bats in EPL have some really nice vendor trash
---
I might be a rogue but i hate those kinds od tanks that just pull before glancing onto the healers mana or the mana of the dps. I got a lot of good gear and i do frequently top dps but if you se you have pulled aggro GOR THE LOVE OF GOD do NOT run like a chicken that had its head cut off... don't run towards the healer or in circles RUN TOWARDS YOUR TANK.... as a person above stated sadly this post will fal on deff ears my friend...
---
Yes, that is correct, it is not always that valuable. And I understand that. But the way you attempted to articulate that it is just nonsensical.
---
I'll just /target npc name and LOLz at your protest. Even if I have to go to WoWHead to find the NPC name to do it. Why take your anger out on the player base? Let people have their fun they're paying for.
---
Because I wanted to live out my dreams of RPing as a fuccboi. Blizzard stile that from me.
---
also how ppl will just run around if they get agro instead of going to the tank
---
Travelers, I've seen em from 25-35 g in mine. Worth it.
---
correct. This will increase glancing blow damage from 33% to 66%.
---
&gt;When targeting mobs that drop quest items, you can see the approximate drop chance for quest items.
---
Wow, I've always wanted this.
---
I think I'm gonna make the switch tonight man, you've convinced me.

I've got a 60 and a 57 and not once have I ever been attacked on a boat.

Wait how does that work? Does it really take a % of your max health? ....I'll have to level a priest now.
---
Best part is “let this groove” kinda sounds like “ghost mushroom”

Can you go over the differences? Or why you like BigWigs more?
---
Same reason protesters block airport terminals. Why block people just trying to catch a plane home to their family..
---
Where exactly are you in this pic and is rexxar still there pls respond.
---
That's why people do it. because it makes you so upset.
---
&gt; But THAT'S THE POINT. Political/civil disobedience is only effective when it breaks rules and when it makes people (usually the people in power) uncomfortable.
---
Did Blizzard's punishment prevent the point from being made?
---
What is so good about these?
---
Frost bolt casting mage here. I didnt have decurse until i was like 40. I didnt realize that the skill existed. When i first unlocked it i was new to the game and didnt want to waste the money haha.
---
Was iemand anders to darem voor RFD?
---
Amen brother,
---
That's the part that gets me, if this had been a voice of opinion for LGBT rights, global warming action, or Domestic abuse awareness, Blizzard would not have bat an eye. But the fact is, if Blizzard had taken a one year ban and stripped all winnings to any of the above, people would be rabid livid.
---
Freedom of speech does not mean, pick what you want said on your platform so long as it doesn't effect your bottom line, it means supporting all, even if you disagree with them.

Interesting, I may give this one a try. LFG channel is pretty chaotic.

Cooking maxed without having touched fishing?  That's more impressive than any of this.  Not surprised you had your mount gold from all that meat farming

Had a DK on wotlk called Ebolastrike made it till the end of MoP until blizz made me change.
---
14 slots, either Runecloth or Journeyman's backpack.
---
No.  If you are at 100% hp at 100hp, and then lets say they buff you so now you have 200 max hp, you are still at 100hp which means you have 50% of your maximum hp

I know they do, this is just what happened to me specifically

Wow, what a guide.

Everyone knows the best place to queue on horde is UC.

Yup, I experienced the same thing. Had to get mine from github I think.

Thanks! This was easier to figure out than I thought, so I've got it almost reinstalled fully now :)
---
Sam is definitely a Pally
---
This is why everyone needs.
---
why would you not roll need on every purple boe that drops unless it’s a guild run?
---
Selling genuine autographs from that guy! Just message Ungrim on Bloodsail!
---
Again, sorry but learn how speed running or what high end gameplay is like. Being a casual is fine but that also means less efficiency. The addons are needed beyond that which is what I said earlier.
---
Also, go do Onyxia and get back to me when you've done her with a 20-man raid and we'll see if you think the addons still isn't helpful.
---
Wasn't you, we were almost unkillable. 1 lock could destroy most a bg so 1v1 you're screwed. Too much damage mitigation and healing to get past.
---
I had just done it. I'm now wondering how to reset the instance, any idea?
---
You should market Novacoc ™ as a new heartburn medicine.
---
Why all greed and not all need? That is just asking for it
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Aimed shot with that Mara *BOW .... 2.7 attack speed not toooo shabby
---
To a certain point, this is fine. 
---
You do however have to let the tank establish initial aggro in order to get rage to keep the mobs huddled and have enough rage to keep them off the healer.  
---
Having run every dungeon well into double digit times, I've found the smoothest and quickest way to breeze through the dungeon is as follows:
---
1.  I mark a target and pull.
---
2.  DPS blows that target up while I establish rage and aggro.
---
3.  DPS aoe's remaining group.
---
4.  I have enough rage to keep them grouped and taunt to keep them off healer.
---
I have macros setup to explain this to make it even easier and things go smooth.
---
What usually happens is this:
---
1.  I mark target and pull.
---
2.  DPS immediately starts up with AOE.
---
3.  Every mob other than marked target aggros a dps.
---
4.  I didn't have time to get rage and struggle trying to keep them gathered up.
---
5.  I use taunt on mob that is clearly out of AOE to bring them back in.  
---
6.  Marked target aggros the one dps that is actually doing what he is supposed too.  Good luck fella!  I love you, you got this.
---
7.  I have taunt back up to get the mob off the healer that is whacking on him.
---
At the end, everyone took a huge hit to their mana/health bar.  
---
We wait.  Go again.
---
To use skillz while leveling instead of brain deading it. Also to 2 shot clothies.
---
Actually good rp vid much love
---
Serious Guardians of the Galaxy vibe in this video!

Subtlety implies it is difficult to understand because of clever rhetoric. It isn’t the same as being poorly articulated, such as your original comment. Try again kiddo

Bigglesworth
---
Would you please explain to me:   
---
 \- Why u should waste your money leveling enchanting  
---
 \- waste your money getting the recipes  
---
 \-  then waste your time to provide a service for free  
---
 \- while other professions can sell stuff on the AH?  
---
People charge money for their Arcanite CD's, they charge money for pots on the AH. Enchants can't be traded on the AH. You can't farm stuff out in the world or in dungeons while also providing the service of supplying enchants for others - all I see here is hipocricy.  
---
It's ridiculous to flay someone alive with ridiculous prices though.
---
Yeah very true, i would have suggested all need from the start buuuuut i didnt call the shots and i was one of the last to roll greed so
---
Yup, been in Feralas and did the same thing.
---
Such a shame that they decided to neuter the infernal like that.

Please try again.
---
I want this voiced out, but Jowy be voiced by Davie504
---
After the first week, you will notice prices going up slightly and it will be a steady increase throughout the classic. It will probably hit a point of diminishing returns but I don’t know when that would be.

Blizzard should hire you to help write their lore. That was fantastic! I appreciate the narrator’s intelligence and willingness to give benefit of the doubt to the shadow priest. Question: were the rock elementals in the Badlands? Or some other place with rock elementals that I have forgotten about?

What the UI pack. Using Ansi UI right now to keep the classic feel but this looks hella nice.
---
Every thing that I do that I think is cool, has already been done by 100s of other people.

There really isn't anything they can do now, it's a situation that damned blizzard the moment it happened. There's not much you can do to get the shit smell out of your mouth after you eat the ass of china

A Overwatch streamer was banned for a certain amount of time for false reporting. But this is only because he did it A LOT and on stream, so there was pretty concrete proof it was false reporting, because he's say it on stream, just never thought he'd be punished for it. I forget his name though, so I can't provide proof.

Like i said i would have rolled need from the start but everyone else greeded way before.

Heart seeker is no where near 50-50. It’s more like 80-20 ally.

Talents? The leveling guide might help you
---
No I don’t mean you have to actually RP to not be crazy about transmog. Think about any other RPG out there, Witcher, Skyrim etc, do any of them have transmog like mechanics?
---
imagine being so delusional you think that Blizzard didn't make this decision because of people deleting their accounts en masse.
---
what other possible motivation would they have?
---
turns out, voting with your wallet *does* work.

Then you missed the most of the quests in those zones.

You just don't realize it.

Dungron bosses still give rep but around 50 per kill, and scourgestones gice 25 rep per turn in and the token you get is also 25, so you badically need 420 for exalted once you are revered.
---
You ninja looter always get so triggered. It's honestly funny.
---
Alliance, didn't have too much trouble 30-40.  STV, Swamp of Sorrows, Arathi, Desolace.  Leveled pretty quickly.
---
It doesn't matter for leveling because offensive stats Generally have a much higher impact for leveling, while still not having a giant overall impact on the class of druid. I never said it was valuable for leveling, it's a level 50 item god damnit.
---
Well you SHOULD drop it after getting the heart though, because there are much more valuable professions at end game. Are you aware of how much gold you're gonna spend on that bank space just to store the bop's? It's incredibly inefficient
---
How bad is your English? Like are you this fucking stupid you talk and type like this? Entilted little brat think he deserves 500 gold than the rest of the group. Anime watching no life nerd bitch.
---
Haha same here. Was addicted to WoW from Vanilla thru WotLK. Played off and on since then but I hate the changes so much it broke my heart to play. I heard that classic was finally going to be a thing about a month before it dropped. Thought it was awesome but told myself I don't have time to play anymore... I'm a wife now with an 8 year old daughter and a 13 year old stepdaughter and I just can't manage it.
---
Have it a try for nostalgia about a week after launch and am hooked again. Luckily the wife and mom thing is keeping me from actual addiction but it great getting to play a bit when the kids are at school or after they're in bed lol.
---
Now if only I could get my husband to resub.
---
Cool! Any plans on making WoW content on the channel? :)

Thanks for the reply; good to hear I'm handling it correctly. Is there anything I can do as far as consumables/gear are concerned? Pallies/Warriors can up their aoe threat with stuff like engy shields/spike, grenades, oils of immolation, other thorns gear.
---
There is one, just not named from template.
---
Go to New &gt; Select the last option to import/paste a code string.

Less than that for paladins and locks.

I'm so burned out farming Savage Gladiator Chain. It simply will not drop and I feel like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel just finding people to come. 
---
Just finished my 275th run this morning, with 23 gorosh spawns, and 0 glad chains.
---
You retard who says 1% crit == 1% hit doesn't have the intellectual high ground. To follow it up with childish tactics like calling me "kiddo" is further evidence of your low IQ. Sorry that you're dumb, I just pointed it out and you got upset. Lol.

Ah yeah I see now. It is just that 5g per month is freaking useless but ah well.

Also it seems that it was 1.11
---
For dungeons you could have a 60 clear all the trash then zone in for only the boss to avoid big chunks of exp assuming you have someone to do it with.
---
Filthy casuals.
---
Unless they get the first hit in i guess? I cast the shield, start to put swp and mind blast on them, then the shield breaks and I die.
---
Currently playing a Mage.  I mained a priest from Vanilla til WoD.  I play a mage for the CC.  I’m not AoE’ing anything that’s not an obvious AoE pull, hell, I’m not even specced into Improved Blizzard.     My first job is to sheep, then to dps.  Counterspell is amazing.  Why don’t I just start blasting away when the tank pulls?  BECAUSE I DON’T WANT TO CORPSERUN.   I played priest for years because I wanted to make sure that any group that I was in has a competent healer.  I play Mage because I want to contribute to crowd control.  
---
I make enough food and water for everyone in my group BEFORE the run starts, because I want all of the health and mana bars as full as possible and if others can freely eat and drink, they’re more patient with me while I drink after every other pull.  You’re in my group?  Here’s 20 food and 20 water, no I won’t take a tip. 
---
Vanilla is all about teamwork, not face rolling.
---
I think it is 55:45 ally to horde, which is great if you want to avoid a realm with horde majority.

/run SetCVar("graphicsGroundClutter", "10")

as one macro.
---
/run SetCVar("graphicsGroundClutter", "1")

as another macro.

That's what I've got so far. There's most likely a means of combining it into a single macro but as of yet I'm not sure how to do it.

You use offhand proc poisons, the faster the better

Remember the posts before launch that were asking this sub to not turn into the cesspool that is /r/wow?

Well it's a fucking cesspool at this point.

Hurr here's my shitty art post. Hurr here's my shitty story about being lvl 23. Hurr here's a dumb screenshot of my first mount.

I might find one or two interesting threads that have actual game discussion. Everything else is shitposts.
---
Around 60 runs here and havent seen it drop yet.. Atleast got something to do between raid resets 😄
---
surprisingly, this is not an RP server
---
There is a comment by Scudzy posted under Hand of Justice on Wowhead 30/03/2006 in patch 1.9.4 where he says that it now drops off of Emperor

holy shit yes

same for feralas its actually hilarious how invisible this plant is

No way! 1-10 should be at least 3 to 4 hrs max.
---
Mooncloth is also 16 slot, and often cheaper
---
tonight probably. i'll be mainly in arathi until i get the charms then back to tarren mill for the boss
---
And then there are spellcleave groups that can go 60k per hour.
---
280 average atm was 400-450 2 weeks ago
---
I'm using RingMenu. I have one set up for all my tracking and some other misc stuff, then one set up for all my aspects + pet stuff
---
Horde deserves it too for not using WotF...
---
That's true, I do manage to hit 10 in a short time, then the leveling time doubles per 10 levels pretty much.
---
thank you my dude :)
---
This idea doesn’t logically flow...i cant find groups because my high pop server doesn’t have low levels, so my solution is to open a new server that wont have a population at all in hopes that the niche group of people who are also experiencing this might quit their current server and start over on this new one? Then what? You guys all get to a higher level and the same shit happens and we keep starting servers every 2 months thinning out the servers even more?
---
i presonaly prefer some kind of transmog feature in classic.
---
First hunter post that named their pet 10/10
---
What item is it?  You have 2 other options.  You could advertise the item in trade chat suggesting a price but saying that you'll entertain offers.  The other option is to watch the AH until someone lists one, and then undercut them (if the price is acceptable to you).
---
Your offhand definitely matters while leveling. It is another source of damage being a rogue as well as providing stats. Does it matter as much as your main hand? No because all of your abilities all go off your main handers. Would definitely recommend investing in a decent offhand. Dont break the bank tho
---
You just have to know what mages do when they aoe. A bunch of mobs aggroed on him and he used frostnova...best get out of melee range.
---
Solo at level 60? What spec?
---
How do you dance walk?!
---
It’s so nice to be able to kill 2 mobs at once for a few levels!
---
Recruit a friend to help you invite an alt of yours to a group, then they can leave grp. You can promote your alt to lead, swap over and use the alt to reset the instance, and logging back in on your main will put you back to the princess spawn point with the dungeon reset.
---
I'll be on in 9-10 hours or so. If you catch me before raid (before 8:30 server) I'll be happy to help.  Add Bigbusta to friends.
---
Sometimes that works, sometimes it is simply to confusing in a pug.
---
I usually cater to what the healer wants.  Sometimes the healer wants full mana before pulls.
---
I obviously adjust this in response to what exactly the next pull is going to be.  A solo mob?  Yeah, I pull unless the healer is OOM.
---
Another adjustment is made based on how the dungeon has gone so far.  Sometimes you have bad dps players and have to completely reset after each pull.  Sometimes you never stop.
---
While leveling? Which is when mages are doing this stuff and people are doing 5-mans
---
Good for you to know more than me what happened while I was playing.
---
I always help warriors when I see them. I have a warrior, and know the pain lol
---
Is that Cam Newton’s character?
---
Pretty sure "Fuck Blizzard" looks worse than you right now.
---
So many idiots in this world.
---
I really like that I could die when I am doing 1vs1 against a mob within my level range. I still don't undetstand how a bear can parry my sword attacks.
---
Most of the people still leveling 1-40 are on there alts and probably only have a level 48 mage or some shit from my experience. There just the young kids who don’t have the attention span to max a character so they make meme alts and be even more toxic on those chars.
---
That's what that nifty stopwatch is for!  When you gotta go fast!
---
You shield, then fear, then do damage while they are feared. Mind flay slows them.
---
Well, here are some tips on saving money:
---
\- Only learn essential skills
---
\- Avoid buying gear from AH
---
\- Sell stuff you make and Greens/Blues on AH (I sold a lot of bags as a tailor)
---
\- Select the most expensive quest rewards in order to sell them
---
I think that's most of the stuff that I did in order to afford the mount.
---
easiest way is to invite someone to the group and make them lead, then have them invite your alt to the group. log out of your main and onto alt after kill. after a few minutes alt will get group lead. reset instances and log back on main.
---
Finish the rest of my quote.  You left it out and finished it yourself.
---
Hehe, well if we were talking about TBC, my action bars would've been full, but in Classic that's most of what I need.
---
About how much more health does a warlock have than a mage?
---
So true. So annoying
---
At least on my server, the number of people in chat asking for &lt;lvl 40 dungeons is way down. 3 weeks ago scarlet monastery was probably the most often seen dungeon for LFG, and now it's BRD and higher.
---
Combined with significantly less people still playing and it's easier to feel that way. One of my friends is having trouble finding SM groups now without staying a while to look. 
---
Also, I haven't been having to wait in 200+ player queues anymore.
---
Set a goal before classic and finally achieved it... Cleared WC
---
Yeah the fear thing is difficult with the random direction and all. So much going on at the same time so quickly, I never remember what to do.
---
And?  Are you saying knowing somebody stealthed means you've just won every fight? Ever dueled a rogue or druid before lol?
---
This reads like something you would say if you’ve never actually completed a dungeon in your life.
---
Yup, they don't see politics when they are doing it themselves, which tells something about their capacity or willingness for self-reflection.
---
&gt;"Think Globally; Lead Responsibly; and importantly, Every Voice Matters"
---
Globalism is a political ideology and "every voice matters" is not a fact, but a political opinion part of a political ideology known as equalitarianism. They seem to be completely blind to the whole concept of politics altogether.
---
&gt; "Our esports programs are an expression of our vision and our values."
---
If they were honest here the above sentence would continue "...and our politics." Because how can you have a vision and a set of values without those actions and ideas manifesting themselves politically? It's quite impossible, but this day and age they just think that whoever disagrees with them is abusing the platform for "divisive social or political views". So if you disagree you're divisive, but their "core values" are some fundamental truths of the universe and hence not divisive at all? How absurd.
---
Yea mage here, I’ve never gotten mad at the tank or the healer because I know it’s my own responsibility. I also have two ice blocks if I need to use em
---
Yup, step one of being a herbalist, Ground Clutter = 1
---
I don't know who that is, but I would love that
---
Do you use mage armor with this to keep mana regen higher or go with frost still?
---
I am alliance at EU pvp, and people were still super friendly and nice in every zone. I am currently lvling my alt level 15 rogue.
---
Any chance you are like horde and undead?
---
I haven't bought anything off the AH. And I've gotten very few sellable greens/blues on the AH. I usually try two or three times to sell something on the AH and if it expires after that I just vendor it. I've started to sell quest rewards NOW just because they're starting to yield decent gold, 1-2g usually.
---
Always DPS from behind. As already mentioned, you avoid parries doing this. As not mentioned, in harder content, bad things often happen to you in front of the target. This isn't a big deal on dungeon trash, but dungeon bosses and raid trash its a concern, and raid bosses its very likely.
---
Unless it is really big, and has a tail. If it is really big, and has a tail, inquire as to potential tail related abilities.
---
it's easy now that the world provided them with content to react off of. you know how I actually helped Katrina victims years ago? I joined habitat for humanity and built a fucking house for them. I didn't just tweet or tell others how much I cared.
---
This is fun :)
---
 Hilarious
---
The mages in my guild know exactly what LoS means; they just don't give a fuck.  Those meters, man.
---
Yes, but actually no. This is not correct for a lot of reasons. OW had an openly gay pride event did they not. Gay rights are extremely controversial in many parts of the world, but hey, it's good for PR in the west.
---
The fact that you think this is an "okay" response is not okay. Gay pride is a political view. One I am all for. You know what isn't a political view. Basic Human Rights. It's only a political view if you are a tyrannical government that does not want your people to have basic human rights.
---
And the fact that blizzard called this a divisive politcal point... yea... how are human rights divisive exactly?
---
The good old Reddit ‘all party members are bad woe is me’.
---
I don't use it in Classic, but if I remember correctly it detects if you're a tank. For them it switches the plates: it looks like this when you *don't* have aggro. 
---
Maybe that's the reason why?
---
"friend"
---
no matter what gets posted people complain. What counts as actual content to you? It's a 15 year old game; we all know just about everything about the game at this point. It's all reposts.

Ya can’t fool me again

Ah thank you

around 40 it starts to feel like ive experienced most of what the class had to offer and begin to wonder if it is just more of the same to 60

Thank you for the insight! I appreciate it.
---
You can't just say that and leave us hanging
---
Awesome thank you for the insight!
---
I never knew just how much trouble warriors have... It's fun though you just have to realize ASAP that you're not going to win any 1v3s and not even most of the 1v2s haha.
---
I was leading an ulduar raid many years ago and we got to the robot that does the tantrum... And there was a huge boom that shook my house. I called on vent for Toxika to take over and that I had to go because of a car hitting my house.
---
Turns out that someone stole a work truck and torched it. My house was on the edge of the subdivision backed to a large expanse of undeveloped land and the truck was burning about 150 yards from my back wall. It had welding tanks in it so it had several explosions.
---
I think this was on Argent Dawn. Tox, if you're out there hit me up.
---
Is Ars going to start writing articles about Asmongold reacts videos now?
---
Seriously, this is a Vox level virtue signal trash article right here.  Surprised it made it to Ars... that place has apparently gone down hill...
---
even sooner for the intrepid amongst us
---
Elite RP :P
---
Inconceivable
---
Lol who cares if China removed a black dude from a movie poster you really think that news is as important as all the rest?
---
Hard to put a number on it because gear obviously plays a big part, but Warlocks do put more of an emphasis on Stamina, so usually a lot.
---
OP didnt sell, he caught him. Like 7g a piece, so 14g
---
You obviously don't pvp much, should watch some shaman videos.  Elemental or enc you should and will be melee in open battle, 1v1, etc.  Bgs you can sit back and just spam
---
it's just a meme macro, does nothing :)
---
Questing and leveling as usual. Would u rather farm gold and lose xp gain or farm gold and stay at same xp gain?
---
You can also life drain a non main target without stealing aggro. Groundbreaking, I know.
---
Repeating arguments don't make them more true, but more power to you. It seems the majority doesn't agree with you, thankfully.
---

---
No passive applied debuff kicks off manual added debuffs.  
---
Else warriors would be in deep shit.
---
What happened to you in a level 30 dungeon doesnt matter in this conversation.
---
Literally trusts strangers with a 500g roll.
---
That is some serious innocence.
---
Yes, it's time to get farming for mad herbs.
---
SM+, this very much depends on the quality of your healer. If you have a not so good healer, trying to heal in an offspec, you may want that shield. If you have a really good healer, geared and specced for healing, you can run around pulling 4 packs, and letting your Ravager AOE everything, with rock solid threat over your spell cleave mages, while your healer mana dumps you cause you are getting hit like crazy...
---
My tip may get some criticism from the other druid players, but I'd seriously recommend you get Nature's Swiftness in Resto tree for healing yourself instantly when getting to low HP as a kitty.
---
The biggest take out of this for me is that after all these years, people are still clicking their buttons....wtf man.
---
Stealth isn't 100%, people much higher level than you will be able to see you quite regularly. There's also talents to help decrease your visibility.
---
I once saw a pic in discord of one guy having nothing bound to any hotkeys at all dont feel too bad
---
The undead troll boss is covered at the beginning, most groups will skip him and spawn of hakkar unless someone has the quest. It’s a pretty long ordeal to activate him.
---
Me the kind of orc that does zug zug.
---
They're presumably in a pug and this is a 400-500g item that everyone will sell for gold versus use.
---
By rolling greed, you're only giving someone an opportunity to ninja it and leave the group.
---
Totally. The method I mentioned just seems to be the most effective way to manage the healer's mana from my experience. Definitly depends on too many variables for there to be a one-size-fits-all process.
---
100% mage armor, you should never get hit with that build vs 1 target
---
WHAT??? NO CHAN.... wait... I would like the barbershop too.
---
back in MY day... ganking was a higher level killing a lower one. that's it.
---
not his work lol
---
Str increases chance to hit? Sorry pretty new to classic stats
---
How long does it take for the Respec Cost to decrease?
---
Because if you're not doing their politics, then you are abusing the platform for your "divisive" political ends. Apparently only their policis are non-divisive, whereas any other politics like LGBT, globalism and equalitarianism ("every voice matters") - are not divisive.
---
What if I side with a king and crown, claiming that not all voices matter, but we should prefer some voices over other voices? Am I being divisive? Is Blizzard not divisive with their policies towards people who don't buy into them?
---
Are you on neatherwind?

---
yesterday i just wasted a half day to complete the quest to get infernal. after gone lower blackrock spire first trash drop is the book. ...
---
Good guild serves its population whether casual or tryhard. If you call individual player good it could also mean skill but that also had nothing to do with consumables.
---
Guilds that bring heavy consus are tryhard, comepetitive or hardcore. They might not be good guilds if they treat players like shit. They might also have low skill players.
---
In my experience, the average steady dungeon group has always outperformed xp per hour. When compared to questing.  It's anecdotal, I have a few friends who track as well.
---
The only exception is if you are capable of doing jokerd like pulls. Then solo/grind is a little faster.
---
Personally I have yet to figure out how to do jokerd stuff on my mage.
---
But, u need to find a tank and healer who are comfortable as tank and healer.  In stockade for example,  with the exception of rooms with bosses,  if u can pull one room at a time then your on the right track (for xp/hour)   but if you only pull one mob at a time..
---
(My post is simply my experience, and not an indictment or attempt to say you shouldn't just do groups for the fun of groups/company)
---
It take me about 20 or so seconds Everytime I track an herb to find it if it isn't on sand, snow, or plains.
---
I got my first epic BOE in the world after so many years of playing a few days ago... Required level 54 item.
---
Sells for 12g.
---
My excitement faded soon after hahaha.
---
I'll heal the imp before I heal the lock
---
Tank here, can confirm. Mages blow ur load as hard as you can. I love it
---
Ya I saw "wtb devilsaur location" constantly in general chat and even the "mafia" arguing with people telling them to join or leave
---
they just butt hurt that you get to leave and they get to keep wasting their life
---
It's even worse when it's a Paladin tank. There's literally a huge glowing AoE on the ground you can run into!!!!!
---
Chestballz has entered the chat
---
Yea how convenient let's unplug only a certain part of the statements out of it's context and plug it in to your argument against it to fool idiots into thinking it makes sense.
---
Homie, the point was that you don't always control it, and for those cases you still carry food and drinks. 
---
It has nothing to do with me going into STV and wanting it that way.
---
Again you must be a prophet to know when what happened to me.
---
Just for you. On my German server no one ever had your shitty ninja looter rule. I don't care on what shitty server you think this was or is standard. It never was for my years playing Vanilla. Stop  pretending to know what happened for me.
---
I’ve got so many hate messages farming in the same exact spot.
---
Damn. Keep grinding. Are you MC yet? May end up snagging staff of dom. Or mageblade. I was gonna farm scholar after week 2 MC but rng dogs blessed me with madeblade.
---
Do you think Blizzard will open up paid transfers soon?
---
My server has dropped down to low population since launch, but my main is 37, so I dont want to reroll. 
---
But I really don't want to play on a dead server.
---
You’ll quickly come to realize most of your exp for a level comes from grinding the mobs that have the terrible drop rates. Quests completion is really only like 3% of a level at higher levels.
---
the mobs are all slowed at that point  if a mage cant handle kiting a group of mobs in a dungeon, theres your problem
---
What level can you effectively start farming ZF?
---
Ya I considered just doing Ret for 40-50 questing then go back to Prot for dungeons 50-60.
---
You are an honourable priest. I salute you, Noble warrior.
---
Lmao yeah, that’s what’s going to happen. I’ll prob get witchblade this weekend and then mageblade when I raid this week. But hey! Can’t predict the future
---
I offtank as mage, we pull a big pack when i'm full mana and i will hold all the agro and kite them around without dying
---
tank basically there to tank unslowable mobs and bosses
---
Your mistake was not going to The Hinterlands instead.
---
Never trust a priest with bad intentions rather
---

---
Slaaaaaaaaay king

---
&gt; hey might not be good guilds if they treat players like shit.
---
By that logic every guild that doesn't use heavy consumes are not good guilds because literally every player is treating each other like shit.
---
Well everybody can take hits from level one, so everybody can tank at any level, I guess.
---
i think there ok the first few times, like the first few lvl 40s with mounts  cool. but were at the point where ppl are runin around in full prebis with 10+ epics and an epic mount. lvl 40 and a mount isnt really worthy of applause (tho gz to anyone whose done it).
---
and ofc any time you make/find/otherwise obtain something really rare (like a legendary) or obtain it in a rare/comical way (like getting boe off of the trashiest trash mob no one would of expected) is fine, atleast for a while.
---
because not everyone is going to craft a legendary or win rolls by yellin.
---
otherwise they are a bit too low effort. but thats the world we live in now, people like too overshare even when its something no one cares about.
---
Haha nice
---
I feel like this sub deserves to have a r/classicwowcirclejerk at this point.
---
Counter argument: Female undead rogue animations. They do flips and shit
---
Me an oce player.... with no rp servers . :'(
---
Bingo. The amount of upset people telling me how to play this game is infuriating. We know we can make money off these, but giving them for tips/mats is just as rewarding to me, so back off ya money grubbers!
---
Warlocks have the worst mana regen in the game.
---
Mages are tied with priests for mana regen.
---
Warlocks stack HP and use life tap.
---
I also play on Mograine at lvl 40 and it’s super hard to find a grouo for anything. This even goes for lvl 50 and mara runs, nobody running them for quests. The only ones I see there are lvl 60s that are farming it for gold.
---
Especially with DM announced and water essence spiked
---
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire makes everything better.
---
Reading that quote, I can’t help but hear it in egg heads voice lol
---
I would go check out countdown to classics episode about druids, there is a really good feral druid that he interviews. I cant remember his name though.
---
Yeah like i said, what happened to you casually levelling up to the mid 30s doesnt matter.
---
I'm an altoholic, so I don't have much problem waiting a few days for my highest level char to gain some rested XP.
---
Enough with these low effort achievement pollyanna posts.
---
Wow you're doing gods work.
---
Would really like to know the procs rates of...
---
Blackhand Doomsaw  
---
Demonshear  
---

---
Blackblade of Sharam  
---
Ofc since youre doing this by hand i imagine getting your hands on these weapons would take a while! Still great work! Keep it up!
---
1. Fellow bear druids what threat addon is your recommendation/preference? 
---
2. Is it worth to use higher ranks of rebirth or is it situational?
---
3. Is it a good idea to use barkskin pre-pull? It seems risky to leave bear midway and activating it.
---
Zandalar tribe.
---
I play at odd times a lot, so probably has been some that i've missed, would love to see one though.
---
This priest is a bit shady.
---
Yup, this is how it should be done. 
---
And that guild enchanter shouldn’t have to spend money on his recipes, the guild funnels most of them to him and uses his profession wisely. 
---
If he feels like giving enchants for mats, let him be.
---
No, I think we're pretty much over it at this point actually.
---
Hey that's my server
---
Ty mate for your awesome reply
---
I let mages who draw aggro die even though I can stop them from getting hit. Dont tell anyone.
---
You are a wonderful person. Thank you for this.
---
Also, your post history is all about asking for help on how to do some basic things in wow. Why can you ask for help but others that are newer can’t share a success story ??
---
Wow Fantastic Baby!! 😙❤️
---
To the top with this post! Great editing 👍
---
Now is a great time to start. Don't feel rushed. It is going to be a long time between content phases and most of the player base is not 60 yet. Just sit down, play, explore, have fun, and make friends!
---
This is from same poster?
---
Hong Kong was literally rented land. China can't give up their claim without weakening their other claims in the Asia-Pacific theater. I want HK to be free but this is geopolitics so yeah actually different political values are a good comparison.
---
Best bet is to ask a guildie at that point and start high in trade channel. 
---
Also, Cards Tommy or Rays Tommy?
---
I dont mind the blizzard mages. Its the arcane blast mages that give me an ulcer.
---
I know but where’s the fun in that? It’s like ganking lowbies - no skill involved then no fun **for me**. Just my playstyle
---
I run SM/Ruin.
---
Locks r fun, sad to see you go cheers mate
---
Okay good to know - ty.  But then why in the hell would i ever use rank 2 (more mana) over rank 1?
---
Very True. I love Prot but did dungeons all 30-40 and I know I'm gonna be doing ST, BRD and Dire Maul all 50-60.
---
I think I've decided to just play Ret for 40-50 and enjoy some of the best leveling zones relaxing questing in that time.
---
Dude get fucking real. I bought a new phone and was tired of all the porn subreddits popping up when browsing in public.
---
Well, I dont want to die. So I usually wait until they turn the corner to charge. But mages and stuff go to town down range.
---
Fantastic, thank you, I cant believe I didnt see this
---
I wouldn’t worry about it. I’m in mid 50s now and haven’t met any exceptionally bad mages in a long time since leaving SM, I always find groups, and as long as you don’t take aggro instantly people like grouping with you. As always, Reddit blows things out of proportion.
---
The kind of unbridled excitement and fun that this game generates, which moves people to post about what you think are insignificant achievements, is exactly waht is awesome about wow classic!  I love that people are having such a good time and are so legitimately excited that they are taking a small bit of time out of there day to share with the community.  It's what WoW Classic is all about.  Frankly, its one of the main reasons I follow this sub--seeing other people having as much fun as I am with a very old video game.  I would never want people to stop sharing there joy on this subreddit, and hope you can appreciate the simple pleasures being shared by everyone here.  There are plenty of forums out there dedicated to hard core theory crafting if that is what you are looking for (the ones where the mods kick you permanently for even asking a question), but thankfully this subreddit is a great reflection of the accepting, friendly, and fun community that WoW Classic has brought out!
---
This is thrown out a lot, and while true, there is a pretty big caveat. As you get higher level, the difference between on and off-spec healing becomes much larger. By the time you hit ZF, as a holy spec healer, you will rarely need to stop the party for mana unless the group is pulling several packs at a time, at which point, your still probably ready again quicker than the caster AOE. Switch over to mostly prot spec, and while you can still do it, you will be drinking between almost every pull, and have many pulls were you start to worry about going OOM before its over. This will leave a much less positive impression on your group compared to the first case.
---
I accidentally chose the wrong hairstyle (male Dwarf, took the regular ponytail instead of the braid) at launch and didn’t notice until my friends and I were all too high level for me to want to reroll. It drives me nuts and at this point I’d pay for a Recustomization or bribe a GM if I could.
---
If you’re expecting to find a group for each instance 24/7 within 5-10 minutes, classic isn’t for you. Simple as that.
---
Thanks for putting a spice on this... those posts get so old and are repeated all day everyday. 
---
I just think how many times ( probably every time) someone yells For the drop to not get it lol. Where are all those posts at? Shit way to get a little attention.
---
Hey, how come the other 390000 people on this sub didn’t post the same image when they got theirs?
---
Oh that’s right, because it’s nothing special and makes for poor degrading content. If everybody was like you, this would be as good as retail.
---
You're also high enough to do SM Graveyard if you'd just like to start there, although I personally went the Thousand Needles &amp; Mirage Raceway route, right into Library
---
I mean, some epic boes are shite, some blue bops like dalrends are bis. I think that saying epics are far more valuable is just wrong. I think that just because something is boe, it shouldn't be treated than any other drop in the instance and be rolled out fairly, as it dropped within the group setting
---
&gt;well I think those that decided to stay will probably stay.
---
And the ones who decided to boycott will be back in a week or less.

Congratz, the mount at 40 is always such a nice touch. I would know im a warlock :\^)

My bad. Spy is annoying a lot of the time, but it’s nice to know when horde are nearby.

Nice circlejerk

Yo, I want to make these clips I have uploaded here into a real video.

I am looking for voice actors, so if you think you got the stuff please contact me with an example of your voice!

payment can be discussed :)

That's not in my nature. You keep on being you, I wish you the best of luck.
---
I had a guy tip me 2g for knowing rexxars location
---
then i feel sry for you to play in 2019
---
I’d say for a Warrior Feralas would be easier to get through before Tanaris
---
Yeah they definitely would get kicked out. If we were having a succession movement based on the Confederate flag the same thing would happen. Wearing the flag of the USA is only against flag code and nobody gives a fuck about flag code.
---
Ok you literal consecrationbot
---
Darkfall is better its 3D for one. Just kill them and take everything they have.

Seems like a nice guy

Can someone explain toe the appeal of a keyboard with lights ? Isn’t it just annoying during the evening
---
Why do we still make such a big deal about weddings? Birthdays? Holidays? They have all been done before hundreds of times. 
---
See, your logic is pretty flawed. People like to have fun sometimes and be proud of what they have done. 
---
I get it, you have already done it so it's not a feat for you, but for them it is. Let them have their fun, no need to rain on someone's parade.
---
Hell if it was me I'd have actually given you the 86s and 97c after that effort
---

I’m new to classic and I’ve been using the word ganked for anytime any PVP happens. That and reeee 
---
“OH SHIT HES TRYNA GANK ME REEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE REE REEE REEEEEEEE”
---
This wasn’t one pull.
---
If you’re not new, why would you post such terrible content?
---
Could be tap water filled into a bottle. That’s what I do
---
lol I totally missed your name. Been subbed since Mordhau released. After you released your how to become a spy video I got a lot of free kills from retards who thought it made them invisible.
---
This is why I always endorse RP-PvP servers. They keep things like this at heart, and it is hilariously fun.
---
...okay? Cool story, bro.
---
Nice name! 73
---
Now that the game is out, we have nothing to discuss/doomsay about anymore, so 90% of this sub is just memes and "look what I did ingame" posts.
---
Not trying to be a dick in anyway and as a main tank I 100% agree and understand what your saying as it does happen fairly often but just throwing out not to forget your mocking blow.
---
It is a last option and on a 2m cd but the taunt effect actually lasts longer then taunt and it gives you time to get some rage or wait for regular taunt cd to come up, this on top of intercept stun (with rage ofc) or concussive blow should buy you enough time to gain control again. 
---
You need to work much harder then you should have to but it's just other options. Honestly if you're tanking strath you probably already know all this but some tips for anyone who might not.
---
I love how you state the obvious like an anime villain. Would have traded that amount to you for your effort :D.
---
Just ask a mage in your guild to hook you up with water +food when you log in. I do this every time. Probably saved me 100 g total so far
---
Do you post on r/wow as well?
---
Not in a long time.
---
I’m happy for you.
---
I don’t know. Personally, I wouldn’t make a post like that, but I get it. Sure, there’s always a chance that they’re just doing it for upvotes, but they still get my upvote just in case this really is the only place they can share that accomplishment of getting to 60 for the first time or getting their epic mount or whatever.
---
Ugh. I’m 60. I’ve been farming for Blackstone Ring since level 45. For an hour every day, I’ll take a 56+ healer friend &amp; run through without aggroing a single mob and I’m at the point where I execute the route perfectly every single time. I still haven’t seen Blackstone Ring drop. Not once. After well over 50 Princess runs.
---
I hate those posts too but the one that one that really grinds my teeth are these:
---
"To the person that helped me with "insert random shit here", THANK YOU, I could have wrote to you in-game but I wanted to virtue signal and post it on Reddit."
---
And
---
"To the person that "insert killed/ganked me in random location, I'm so glad in the end I "insert revenge". YOU STARTED IT."
---
Hate them so very much.
---
this was as pointless as your first comment in this thread
---
Thats what i was thinking about. In the end im just one of x  dps players. I think i will take this way.
---
Even 1-2% seems generous.  Only a fraction of their users follow Blizzard enough to actually be aware of this situation, and a fraction of those who are aware will care, and a fraction of those who care will do anything.
---
Deviate Delight friend! I thought I was the only one!
---
This was hilarious. Thank you lmao
---
Those are also annoying, though that wasn't even close to what my post was conveying.
---
I have a 60 and currently a 31 alt.
---
There is a huge portion of Gamers who literally can't help but interject on how easy they found something that someone else struggled with. And as annoying as those casual posts are, they come no where close to as pathetic epeen stroking comments.
---
&gt;This reads like something you would say if you’ve never actually completed a dungeon in your life.
---
Stop giving shit away for free then?
---
I forgot the curse.
---
Simple Map will do it without having all of the other stuff leatrix brings with it.
---
I am a Mage and I take full responsibility when it comes to dungeons. I AOE when it makes sense but am accountable for myself. If I die, it's my fault, no one else.
---
Put a ring on her.
---
&gt; Some people dont have friends that play wow.
---
So they should join a guild...
---
Stop posting pictures of your sister online.
---
Is there something like a BiS list with the fitting armor class? I still can't bring myself to roll need on leather gear when having actual leather wearers in my group etc., so I was wondering if such a list exists as well. Playing warrior btw. and seriously considering to just go full tank due to that reason :D.
---
This is my group and I chose to use the special characters for two reasons. 
---
1: I wanted to make sure I could get the 5 names I wanted. 
---
2: I didn’t want to be greedy and use 5 popular names to one owner.  
---
I agree it does lose some charm to have the accent marks and it makes making macros a pain but I wanted to make sure my fun didn’t affect anyone else negatively.
---
Not everyone who plays wow is gonna die a virgin you know..
---
I can even wave to this guy see, /wave "Helloo."
---
As a tank, I single pull all the time between aoe pulls.
---
I call them/call out rogue snacks, to buy time for casters/healers to top off their mana for the next pull. 
---
Cuts a lot of downtime imo.
---
Heard https://www.youtube.com/c/swolebenji
---
mention doing this on a stream of his.
---
Looks like someone watched him and made his idea a reality. :)
---
That was 3 pulls and definitely not solo.
---
Nah. Laughed at this.
---
Agreed, are we supposed to feel pity and then this huge rush of accomplishment for the person when they make posts worded like that?
---
agree to disagree. in my opinion it has no place in a pvp server. the whole point of wpvp is that you're gunna get jumped by other people sometimes, that element of surprise.
---
They saw me in Cat I was honest didn't expect in my wildest dream party would disband because of it.
---
I'm a bear.
---
This may help some other warriors reading this though.
---
Weird
---
Do you play there? What level which faction? What is your experience? I rolled there as well in the beginning for like 16 levels,  but went to play with friends to other server.
---
You lost your virginity to your sister?
---
&gt; Meanwhile, there are dozens of the same low-effort/repeated posts about people getting to level 40, or getting a mount, or saving up 5g.
---
Don't forget the repeated posts every time someone rolls a 69, 1, 100, or wins or loses a tie. Also a post every time someone gets 1/2 Dal'Rend's Arms.
---
Lost a roll for edgemaster's handguards, angrily alt-tabbed to reddit and saw this. Are you spying on me?
---
Kill or be killed!
---
All fine as long as you don’t roll a PvP server
---
But then what does the pally do with no taunt? Does the mage just stand there waiting for the pally to get agro? The mage is going to be generating 30% more threat if hes in melee range, would it not be easier to just let the mage kite the 1 mobs and dps him down while the pally can focus on the main pack? 
---
Yes if you take agro run towards the tank, not away like a chicken with its head cut off. 
---
Real question since I warrior tank I literally have 0 experience with prot pallies and how they adopt to certain situations.
---
More like new players have a distinct lack of keybinds on their spells.
---
This is precious
---
Problem is that typically the mage will iceblock then the warlock/whatever dps or healer will start eating it instead. Honestly the OP sounds like a mage posing as a tank.
---
Yaaaassss! Saw addiction and thought wait a minute. My guild origin are pyrewood aswell! Cool video keep it up
---
Can go engineering for them sweet sweet PvP trinkets
---
This subreddit by hefty majority is unbelievably casual, it's not going to change.

"I bought full Scarlet Set and wont have a mount til 45, but hey, my character looks cute!"
---
"Needing epic BoEs is ninja'ing!"
---
"Hey, finally got my first epic (some awfully itemized one like 80% of the phase 1 epics)"
---
"Hey, level penalties aren't being applied in PvP and guards are spawning at incorrect rates where attacking towns can quickly lead to 100 guards spawning in seconds" - "Stfu noob, do you need even more of an advantage to kill lowbie? (Not the point, it's a bug), and why are you world pvping anyway, leave everyone else in the world alone!"
---
"Ungoro mafia needs to be banned!" - "Ok but how do they prove theres actual collusion? Should you guys posting all your posts about how someone on the enemy faction helped you with a quest mob be banned?" - "No, but not that collusion"!
---
Etc.... etc..
---
Keep yer feet on da ground!
---
I'll admit, it's cool to see Rhok, TF, Hand of Rag, Anathema, etc. The super rare/unique stuff is interesting to me.
---
What we don't need is a daily post about how someone got level 40, bought a mount and managed to have 4g afterwards and how proud they are of themselves. Or, the 14th post about Edgemaster's hand guards dropping and someone posting a screenshot of them winning the roll.
---
Don't you people have guilds?
---
Yeah and i had 9 level 120s in vanilla. 
---
See look i can make up stuff just like you.
---
Your extremely casual mindset and insults show that to not be true though. If you do ever decide to do endgame content youre in for a shock when everyone agrees to roll need to protect each other.
---
Not gonna lie i laughed when i was reading through it suddenly read go fuck yourself
---
I’m lvl 37 rn and all the mobs in desolace drop really good grey items.. (idk about centaurs) probably the best drop table at there level. ( basilisks, vultures, and the hyenas) 
---
At 60 WPL is top tier when it comes to drop table and making a consistent g/ph off of just greys alone. 
---
Also I remember enjoying a little giant grind in Tanaris since they drop cloth and all those goodies. 
---
Satyrs are good but the two zones there in there camped pretty often by others and there’s just not that many/ spread out.  
---
Farming SM is good for DE and just raw gold farm. 
---
High level elites are always nice (like 20s a drop)
---
Feralas and Azsahara would be good for an Orc. Usually less alliance players there. Tanaris is much more contested
---
My holy priest friend healed literally a full clear of BRD last night at 51-52 with me tanking as a 60 fury/arms tank. 
---
Healers can seriously skate by when they're underleveled. 
---
I will say that we had 3 warlocks in the group and the banishes came in handy frequently.
---
Yeah but this man is rather scroogelike in his desire to stop people from enjoying themselves
---
Mage is the new Hunter
---
Hunt-ards have a particular reputation as well lol.
---
ZF tomb farm has brought the price way down.
---
why dont you ask blizzard instead of reddit..
---
I think we're on the same page with this one. It's a shame people feel the need to post every minor detail of their game time.
---
There are no specialization for tailoring, but tailoring is considered optimal for all clothiers as there is a bis chest piece for each cloth user that can only be used by tailors.
---
Get it from whelps and if you are super serious rage pots. You obviously wont be able to pump threat in to her but you can build decent threat.
---
1.) Nah. 52 Holy Pally. I've found that these pulls use much less mana while killing larger quantities.  
---
2.) Nah. Never. 
---
3.) Not a concern. Easily alleviated by people not standing between the Mage and the targets.
---
I have nothing else to say to you, clueless kid.
---
I really miss wow but with the current climate and it’s age along with the fee that is a relic of the past I just can’t pull the trigger
---
"oh noooo" lmao. Me when my grandpa cancels dinner plans and I don't have to eat a highly questionable and unholy melding of Hungarian and Polish cuisine.
---
Did you open a ticket?
---
1st might be darnassus bank. (not sure about this one)
---
2nd is likely the hidden sewer tunnel below the SW flightpoint (its at water level) Npc called Jorgen is on the ramp there.
---
3rd Forlorn cavern in IF (where you can catch old Ironjaw)
---
Right. But I mean fall damage. If you jumped off unbuffed and lost 75hp (from 100) you'd live. So getting buffed to 200 (now having 100hp) would he still lose 75hp, or would he lose 150hp (75% of 200), and kill him?
---
Excellent. I might have to try that. Thank you.
---
Biggglesworth Horde.
---
This is the worst. Hard to explain to the tank that you did actually heal him.
---
Kiting mobs around other mobs when they have some that cannot even be slowed. They also have several thousand hp, sometimes 10-15k. That would be quite a bit for a mage to kite Inna dungeon. And definitely not Mana efficient. 
---
There's your problem.
---
My name is commander Shepard and this is my favorite video on the citadel.
---
I agree, it was fun and exciting for the first month to see the people who shot ahead in leveling earn all of the rewards so quickly. But now, my guild has 2 full 40 man raids running. People have mounts, people have epics, people have gold. We don't need to see the same minor achievements that every player has earned at this point in the Wow Classic life cycle.
---
Use the fucking search button «open up discussion» how many before you have done that do you think? We dont care
---
So just because I don't support your ninja looting rules means I lie? Fuck off truly. What a waste of time to talk with you. I hope you get shit for your ninja looting in the future.
---
Been trying to get my wife on for years, nice work!
---
Grats?
---
I agree it's annoying, but I think it's a pre-emptive self-defense mechanism because if they don't cop up to being a casual, someone is bound to say they accomplished the same thing in 1/16th the time while blindfolded with one arm tied behind their back.
---
Ending one-upsmanship is the key to ending the casual olympics.
---
If they don't bring the mobs close and ice block to let threat generation happen they deserve it.
---
I leveled as Ret up to 52 and then switched to prot/holy. Much easier to get into BRD runs since you can tank or heal. And then I just ran BRD until 58 when I stated Strat, Scholo, and Lbrs as well.
---
Who hurt you? It’s a cute kitten dude
---
What is the fifith icon in the second frame and the second icon in the third?
---
But i don't like challenges, i don't see the point of them. Just want a nice stroll through everything.
---
Rogues are by far the most dominate class at 19.  And if you twink with the best gear you’ll naturally have a huge health pool.  That’s when getting more damage and more mitigation will outshine 100 hp librams.
---
Not yet released are the lucky fishing hat and pagle’s boots which have a ton of stam.  The neck which is a little bit more.  But more importantly the agility from neck, 2x weapon enchant and gloves will further boost the crit/AP/dodge.
---
Maybe right now 100 hp and 8 agi are debatable which ones are better, but come phase 4, agi will be king.
---

I applaud your effort in taking the time to go through post histories to create a counter-point. Unfortunately, those two things you're trying to compare are completely unrelated.
---
I feel ya.  I played in original vanilla and have read so many “easy gold” ideas/guides this time around.  I went out of my way to skin and fish a bunch between levels 25-37.  I sell every bag I make.  My issue I think was wanting to do every open world quest but only running dungeons once or twice, if at all. 
---
Shellfish traps and leather/fishing sales made me maybe 20 gold.  One easy SM cathedral run last night got me 5 gold just in vendoring, but from looking for a group and getting there and finishing it feels so much longer to me than just questing.   Hit 40 last night and have like 75 gold.  Probably should have just dedicated a weekend or two to running every SM wing.
---
&gt; accidentaly right clicking a boss and starting to autoattack 
---
Unless they've already bodypulled, that wouldn't make a difference. Right-click starts melee auto-attack, not ranged, so they would just stand there saying "I need to get closer".
---
Yeah it’s all over the place. This comment sums it up for me. 
---
“Meh. You’d rather see 30 posts about people getting their first mount? Or getting to level 20? Or mages are bad? Or my childhood dream of getting full SM set? Or barrens chat XD? Or look what dropped? Or PSA? Or I’m taking my time to 60? Or computer screen phone pictures?
---
What am I forgetting? Mages are bad?”
---
Damn that got dark. I got sad.
---
"Finally completed my first goal of Classic, saved 1g and so proud of the self-control I exhibited to get it"
---
Oh god, it took me 20 minutes to remember that feather quest is picked up off of the ground. Because I had ground clutter all the way up and couldn't see them, lol.

---
Don't generalize, he's making a post I very much like.
---
I think they're frankly annoying.
---
I’m seriously stuck on what alt to make and looking for recommendations. Currently have a lock with some money but I would really like to switch things up. Have been looking at every other class and I really don’t know what to pick. 
---
Mage, priest and hunter are out because I don’t want another caster or pet class. Tried druid but came to the realization I didn’t really like the look/feeling of the forms.
---
This leaves me between rogue, warrior and shaman.
---
 - Warrior always scared me of a bit because of it’s leveling speed but now that I have a main with money this may be better? The general playstyle of being able to put out good numbers as tank and dps, being sought after and overall sense of step by step progression always appealed to me.
---
- Shaman looks cool but totem management and all the downranking seems a bit of the pain.
---
- Rogue I know nothing about lol
---
Feel free to give suggestions or advice because my altoholism needs feeding but I don’t know what to drink.

Lol whoever told you to put crusader on a skinning knife is a special person.

---
This is the thing... mage 1 blows his load on the pull, spends the next minute long fight nova'ing blinking cocing etc... mage 2 puts his hands in his pants... closes his eyes takes his hands off the keyboard and counts to 15. Mage 1 is probably already dead or oom, mage 2 gets 4 full blizzards off on 4+ mobs and doubles the damage of mage 1 and has 50% more mana at the end and the healer spent next to nothing trying to keep him alive. 
---
If both mages played like mage 2 it's less healing, less drinking and less recovery not to mention higher damage and faster clears.
---
I dont understand why mage 1 plays like he does.
---
Says "Not to be rude" but provides a completely dick response anyways. Achievements are not just for raiders. Narrow mindedness at its finest here folks.
---
People like to be able to see what they've done and what they can aim for next. It's a goal checklist.
---
The negativity towards this is idiotic and astounding to say the least.
---
REALLY bad. If you have water with a lot of sulphur, it smells like rotten eggs and tastes like shit.
---
ROFL i love these edits lately.
---
Thank you. This is the kind of stuff I was hoping to hear. I didn't get my first mount until BC and I don't want to make that mistake again. Lol
---
I've noticed those are starting to pop-up too now.

&gt;Keyboard turning saved me in STV, it's a great platformer option when you need to dart about on hills while also looking around you frantically. /shrug

No it isn't.

Chances are the device you’re using was manufactured in China, and the former statement can be applied to countless products, would that make you someone without self discipline as well?
---
It's one thing to say Free KH in stormwind where a small number of players might see it, it's something else to use your post match interview to bring it up when people all over the world are watching
---
Doesn't the talent increase the damage on your oh from 50% to 75%?
---
I guess it depends on what you plan on doing with that alt. Do you struggle farming gold as a rogue? Maybe make an alt that is strong at farming, or maybe you don't like dpsing in pve so make a tank or healer. For me personally I main a resto shaman, I'm pretty weak at farming gold and in pvp so I'm leveling a mage to cover both of those.
---
Be a hunter. You use T1 until T3 6p
---
Maybe they dont have any close friends, family, nor acquaintances that play wow. In that case the person reached out to a community FULL of people that play the game. 
---
If you have the right to post something that's just complaining and negativity, why should they not have the same right as you? They just want to show something they did, talk about it, and have a good time. 
---
Just ignore the posts if you dont like the, you can hide them if you REALLY feel that strongly. But there's no reason to rain on someone's parade. Let someone be happy, maybe try being happy for them too instead of shutting them down.

---
&gt; the fee that is a relic of the past
---
God you’re right the game would me so much better if it were free but filled with micro transactions and gacha boxes and everyone was running around in crazy cash shop transmog gear. I really wish we had more pay to win options and experienced potions. 
---
You wanting a game without paying for it doesn’t makes fees a relic. It makes you cheap. Some of us would rather have a good game than a free game
---
"Just hit 20! It's not much but I'm proud of the whole 11 hours I put into it. 11 hours but of course some were afk and doing tradeskills and whatnot.

Anyone have any gold farming advice?"

*rejoices in warrior*
---
More gold? Where’d you get that idea..? Dungeons are FAR more valuable when it comes to both gold and exp (and I’m a tank so I’m not doing mage AOE farms!).

Then they hit you with the classic "I do just fine clicking."

Hello fellow Midwesterner, MN or WI?
---
I still pay and play wow (been playing blizzard games since warcraft 3).
---
Jesus Christ....I have a feeling this game is gonna be ruined in a year because of players being coddled and too many changes occur
---
I got some free enchants recently from a rogue named Toph
---
I brought 0 items along on my first raid and proud of it.
---
Happened in my TBC guild except the guy said: " One more pull and I'm going to the hospital".... Twice. 
---
We were progressing on TBC Archimonde without smart use of terrain.
---
That’s awesome for you! We all define accomplishments differently. I personally enjoy seeing everyone’s progression, and applauding their milestones and accomplishments. Let’s not create a bar on how to define “post-worthy accomplishments,” especially with such a healthy base of new and returning players. Leave that toxicity in retail.
---
&gt;How much do enchants cost? 
---
Depends on the enchant. Maybe 5 gold for demonslayer to hundreds of gold for crusader. 
---
&gt;And how does it work? 
---
Trade the weapon to an enchanter
---
&gt;if you use a new weapon you need to get another enchant?
---
Congratulations on 60 and welcome to the big time.
---
If you haven't already, you should work on getting your classes pre-raid best in slot items from high level dungeons like UBRS and Scholo. Plenty of guides out there, just search "pre raid best in slot &lt;insert class here&gt; wow classic"
---
Here is a link to a post on Whitemanes official Blizz forum with links to their Discord and subreddit:

Between the forum, discord, and the subreddit, you should find plenty of opportunities for guild recruitment. Good luck!

Level up as full feral, if you want to heal a dungeon slap on intellect gears. You heal as feral until like 50+ instances, than it gets more difficult, depending on your group. Respec after 50+ if you want.

---
You want a fast swing time on your offhand, and a slow swing time on your mainhand. This allows the mainhand to take full advantage of abilities that use weapon damage, and the quick offhand helps fish for crits and weapon procs, as well as just hitting frequently and consistently.

Most people are aware that Warriors need some Leather for their BiS DPS. In fact, I think pre-raid BiS for Fury Warriors only has 3 Plate pieces. If you were to pursue Plate only BiS you would be gimping yourself significantly. Don't feel bad, just hit those dice!
---
Holy all the way healing melee cleaves so much fun. Melee cleaves zf zombie farm 44-50, st 50-52 then actual runs of brd til 56/57 for bis and lbrs 58-60 in like 5 runs with a few quests sprinkled in
---
I dont know exactly, but i would say almost nothing. I am doing the same thing and cant really see anything being consumed.
---
Lmfao wasn't it like 30 too?
---
Come and never look back!
---
What spec are you in this ?
---
What weapons are you using?
---
150hp, fall damage is %-based on your maximum HP, otherwise, lvl 60 characters could basically fall from any height and survive OR low-character characters would die from just a small fall.
---
The initial rush of people leveling up new characters is over, so now it’s mostly slower levelers, people who just started recently, and alts. Not a big group compared to the rest.
---
For my part, the Stealth warning of the addon makes me even more paranoid
---
When your custom character appears in a cutscene
---
I actually did something very similar to this to a mage for water. I tricked him into a alley, had him dismount and told him I was mugging him for 2 stacks of water. 
---
I don't know how people normally get water, I play warrior. It didn't work the first time but the second guy wasn't happy he got mugged but he paid.
---
Oh he mad
---
And she let you take a picture of her with no bra in a white shirt. Nice.
---
I never said anything about at the start of dungeon mentioned loot rules. As I posted multiple times make up whatever rules you like. I'm talking about your shit that need on boe is the standard way. Which it isn't.  Stuff like the picture in OP. Shouting EVERYONE NEED is not a loot rule. Easy as that. At this point need = equip, greed = gold. If you want to do your rule, say that at the start and you can do what you want. Stating it during the run is like changing to loot master to reserve an item before the boss who drops it. It makes you a ninja looter.
---
I really don't care if you believe me or not. During my whole time during vanilla and classic now no one every used your shitty rule as standard. So I really don't care what you think about me.
---
Where do i buy the Gnome Tabbard? I dont see the vendor by the Flight Master in IF...?
---
Usually at least for me it was about tens of MB/h of playing. But yesterday I got like 330MB used for 5h of playing... Not sure why that happened or  if I had any hidden processes running on background. However the latency is not that great, never get below 60ms. Average 80-100ms.
---
Why would you feel bad if they attack you first?
---
I never dropped combat, and had more than 8 mobs on us at all times.
---
This IS 1 pull, even though I had to stop abit to prevent dropping aggro and to heal myself. Its impossible otherwise, as I would drop aggro.
---
I'd be interested.
---
Or who let the same person loot twice on the same ID. A minimum of sharing please...
---
I mean, they are BiS for hunters too
---
At 40 bags full of vendor trash sell for 2-3g...

Make an RP toon on MG or WRA and RP on that :) the lag is bearable while just RPing. You also don’t need a max level toon to RP and in my humble opinion sometimes it’s just as fun to watch others RP!
---
To be fair, I wouldn't go within cast range of a dirty pustule-ridden Harkkonen either.
---
Ben redelijk zeker dat het een alliance guild is
---
This just shows how dumb the automatic report system is. I can't remember it being in vanilla as well so it should be removed completely
---
At 25 to 35 you can destroy pretty bad as a hunter if you know how to kite. A lot of classes are missing important skills that they need to catch hunters around that lvl

Let your gold work. Playing the AH

Yes, and I most assuredly see your point (absolutely no argument on my part as I am definitely pro business and pretty big on business autonomy) but my contention is the “equitable” was more valuable than the “human”.
---
Firing someone for an isolated incident isn’t as reasonable as for a pattern, and on a whim (which Blizzard clearly has admitted) is least reasonable of all.  I’m not saying Bliz isn’t legally defensible, but it’s still possible to be 100% right (with the law, terms, etc.)  1000% wrong (with a lot of its fan base) which Bliz is feeling right now.

I was under the impression they had been told by him that he was gonna talk about it. And they probably felt like, nah you're not gonna do that, and that's why they "let it happen" and why they hid afterwards. They didn't think he was going to do that and he did. As far as punishment goes....not sure have they banned casters before? What constitutes a lifetime ban from the official blizzard stream?

Sets it to minimum for 5 seconds and then reverts it to max.
---
do you go into stealth with rogue and turn off the UI for the cinematic shots?
---
Scans for what? You can turn AHK scripts into .exe files and name them whatever you want. 
---
Unless you’re suggesting blizzard is scanning for, and looking at the code of every .exe file running on your PC. 
---
And if you believe that, you’re willing letting a company run an invasive data collection program on your PC and you’re ok with it. Yikes.
---
Using a prot/holy hybrid with skullflame shield + wraith scythe. Also using demon-forged breastplate, uther's strength and bonespike shoulders.

I think it’s the best we can hope for under the circumstances and is the closest to reasonable.  I think the bone people are picking is how it was handled.

Thank you very much

Nice activism bro.

I just subscribed 5 accounts! (Multiboxer)

Literally makes no difference. The point is they’re not getting my money anymore.

I don't care about those. But the "Was running through XY at night. This game is beautiful" posts are getting really boring. Yes, we play the same fking game, we were there or will be soon

Havent tried dungeon farming, but my xp/h from 45-58 has been around 50k/h average up to 80k/h on some good quests. Un'goro was around 80k/h the entire time, great zone! I am a hunter though, but you could have a similar experience as a warlock. 
---
I saw some people claiming BRD aoe farming is 100k/h so that should be better if that is correct.
---
Wasn’t that a bug?
---
I feel the same way, I'm on Skeram, which I believe is the worst. I'm on the verge of quitting because it's so bad, and I've been playing PvP servers since they release. Never rage quit, I have a pretty thick skin. Dying 15+ times just to get into BRD every night is killing me (literally lol). You even have a good chance of dying when all you try to do is reset the damn instance.
---
 Its only going to get worse and I'm just not enjoying the game anymore. Theres 8 Horde for every Ally basically. I've seen the population die HARD since the census was released. I believe it's honestly at least 85/15 now, yet when you bring up this HUGE problem, everyone acts like you're bitching. Like, I don't mind dying, but I legit can't play the fucking game because of the amount of Horde.

I took a permanent break from /r/wow because it's just filled with art now

Any word on the Doomguard?

She looks lile shes totally enjoying herself

Good riddance, we don't care about a former UK colony.

A. That paly decided to run holy paly leveling for god knows what reason. That was their decision. Just like I’m not rolling on DPS gear when I’m tanking a dungeon, I expect the same of others, because I made that decision when I decided to level as a tank.
---
B. “So that you can do the instance.” Nah. They’re replaceable. Everyone is. If someone is contesting the MS rolls of others in the instance for their own OS desires, they can be replaced. The whole reason those mages are doing the instance is so that they CAN roll on those items and hope to only be contested by the other MS represented in the instance.

*Laughs in warlock

Sets ground clutter to minimum for 5 seconds and then reverts it to max.
---
You know why. You just pretend you don’t as cope so you can keep playing your vidya guilt free.
---
I’d rather see people share their achievements than posts about things you can easily google. GFY
---
This comment section is filled woth hordie double standard :/
---
I got ~140 upvotes for trying to dumpster on other people's happiness.
---
Accurate.
---
This video has granted me the courage to head into Mara.
---
I’m so confused
---
Should probably destroy what ever device you used to post this karma fodder. Whichever electronic it is was most definitely, at least partially produced, by China.
---
If playing on an RP server... Well, you'd be excused for thinking people were actually into RP.
---
No one cares!
---
I am on that server as well. I enjoy it
---
I’m a level 49 mage. I don’t plan on doing any open world AOE farming, mainly just end game dungeons until 60 (although still preferably cleave groups). Would I be ok respeccing to single target (frostbite etc) for pvp or should I still hold off. I’m getting pretty bored of this spec I think.
---
And street protests don’t do anything. That’s precisely why they’re encouraged. Want to protest a corporation? Stop paying them. Simple as that.
---
You are right dude.
---
As long as you, the tank, holds aggro *from the healer* you have done your job. DPS all have their own way to control their fate. If a mage, rogue, hunter, warlock, shaman, warrior etc die from aggro its probabaly their fault.
---
I honestly like when shamans and warriors pull aggro on trash because some pulls are big and all of it on the tank leads to them getting gibbed
---
SM Cath, ZF and BRD are all faster. The other dungeons I actually skipped 0 regrets
---
*sobs in bear tank*
---
I bet you own a iPhone right?
---
Sit doesn't work
---
I'd argue that the Briarwood Reed from Jed should be on there too. He's a rare, the item is 20-30% drop and then you likely have to roll against 5-6 other people...
---
Yea dude my history is FILLED with warrior related questions, but im a mage in disguise. Totally bro.

Do you want to be that guy who makes a big deal out of it and then resubscribes a week later?

Naw it's not an RP server

Diremual east with a healer. You kill the bosses and mine the ore at the end.
---
Feralas too
---
Play whichever way you enjoy the most.
---
Nah, but unlike you vidya addled coomers I have enough self-control to stand by my principles.
---
6 is so they don't pull threat, you don't get it both ways.
---
What are you grinding? Stuff in hearthglen?
---
Eventually the lower ranks stop scaling and the higher ranks continue to scale
---
No not even close. That is warlocks I fucking hate life tappin hellfirin warlocks
---
I levelled just fine to 60 without needing to spend money on off hands, or weapons in general. There a few good upgrade paths for you. Start with the SM quest sword, then the vanquisher sword from the RFK quest, then follow that up with thrash blade from Mara.
---
For offhand just get something sub 2 second swing speed with decent enough dps and stats.
---
I'm not comparing the xp/hour of the 2 instances. I'm saying 1 quest run in ST will get him to 52 faster than spamming ZF with no quest completion. And it will.
---
Yeah. He's a mage. A 51 mage. If you think he can do zombie farm at that level you've 0 clue what you're talking about.
---
poisons do about 5-10% of your overall damage...not 50.  50% of your damage is white attacks
---
I'll be giving away even more free shit after reading this comment, just for you buddy!

So then what do you have to lose by deleting your account?

Ah. I see, I just saw on the news, you unsub saved the world.

They still have your money. If you wanna change shit, get off your chair and do it

Course he does, the self righteous ones are usually spoiled brats.
---
You don’t care about anything, kid.
---
as a mage you aoe farm in ZF right now.
---
I enjoy tanking for good mages who run to me, Frost Nova the mobs that are trying to squish them, and blink out.  Gives me time to grab the mob back.  Good dps knows what needs doing.
---
That’s awesome!

zero boobs

&gt; Think about it like this. If someone is toasting at a wedding and they start going on about politics, is that the place for it? No. 
---
Did you not watch the interview at all? That isn't what happened. This is not the case of Blizzard taking action against a belligerent gamer who was trying to make their event political. This was Blizzard literally trying to cover up an incident by firing *everyone* involved just to please China. They even fired the casters, man. The casters said literally *nothing*. And then Blizzard posted a public, pre-emptive apology to China, so that they would look obedient to their masters.
---
Spoken like a true self absorbed, prideful, clueless egoist who is pretending to be altruistic.
---
In TBC warlocks have enough talent points to spec into Siphon Life and Soul Link at the same time
---
Good riddance. Now stop buying smartphones since it’s child labor behind them.
---
oof...
---
Gods, we had this druid in our guild during Wrath who rolled moonkin and would brag nonstop about his AoE dps.  Everybody else in the guild was focused on learning the fights and making progress, and this dude would just brag about how he was top of the dps charts during trash pulls.
---
Remember to report bots! If people cant spend the time to play the game then do not play the game.
---
Wha..? WHHY?!
---
That's adorable. omg
---
What is a cleave group?
---
Do you find rogues difficult to deal with as a warlock? Genuine question.
---
Correction: Warcraft addicted Blizzard sycophants don’t care. Pretty sure the people of Hong Kong care quite a bit. But who gives a fuck about them as long as you get your escapist stimulation, right?
---
3 terrible players, nothing else to say to that.
---
You should! 
---
When P2 and pvp rolls around, you’ll probably see a lot of mages move over to POM/Pyro spec anyway :-).
---
I made a shitpost and very proud of myself. Sorry.
---
Nobody's a shitty person for not unsubscribing. I'm sure there are dozens of companies you should stop supporting, going off of your own rules here. You almost DEFINITELY buy some product or pay for some service that, at the top, is owned by some evil corporation that has done terrible, terrible things.
---
You can call other people shitty once you stop supporting ANY company that does bad things.
---
Bruh, even waiting 15s for tank to gain aggro, I still pull aggro after one or two blizzards. I don't expect them to hold aggro, not one bit. Normally once I pull aggro and finish my channeling I'll pop ice barrier (if it isn't already up), run in, pop Frost Nova and cone of cold/arcane explosion them down. Sometimes if it's a big pull I'll pop cold snap and Frost Nova/CoC again
---
I've heard that farm is very sporadic. Like you might only make 2-5g a run if no greens or blues drop since they don't drop that much cash and crap grays.
---
I dont get it
---
This was the first post I saw and it made my day, thank you for the kindness if you know anyone who makes add ons please let me know, thanks for the kindness and trying to help I appreciate it! Have a wonderful rest of your day (:
---
well yeah, but that's the opposite of what stealth is supposed to do lol. the whole point of stealth is that the targets are unaware that there's a rogue around.
---
That's actually an achievement on par with people's financial irresponsibility these days.
---
Flamelash
---
How do you feel about liteworks?
---
The difference between me and you is that when I understand that I’m supporting things with my money that violate my principles, I stop doing it, whereas you look for excuses to continue. Yes, you are a shitty person.

Thanks! (:

except, it isnt content neutral, and such a restriction as they cited in their penalty would never be considered "content neutral" in any court in the US.  It literally says "at blizzard's sole discretion" but gives no content neutral guidelines or standards.
---
they further try to make it about going off topic and implying that their hands are tied in term of enforcing the rule.  But that is not in line with the text of the rule, plus its their sole discretion.  That is; permissive.
---
finally, their chinese affiliate made the enforcement political, by making it about preserving the dignity of China.  Again, not a content neutral purpose.

Fish floating wreckage, they can be gold mines with the occasional greens, bolts of cloth that sell nicely on AH, and the added bonus of finding a nice big bag or two.

If you have a gather profession, get every node you see and bank it all when you come across a bank, once you have full stacks of stuff, AH it.

That's how I got my mount at ding 40.

Oooh also no unnecessary buying (AH) and don't buy all skills at trainer, just the essentials! You can get the rest later.

Questing alone as holy/ret, more holy than ret, it looks a lot like the shockadin spec. Some say it’s slower but I never die and I almost never take breaks, also I can dish out some nice bursts, loads of fun.

Are you heading back to the tegridy farm now?
---
While these are credible (although somewhat hyberbolic in some cases IMO) issues with the US, they pale in comparison to daily and borderline ritualistic torture and murder of prisoners, an actual dystopian social credit system, police brutality on such a scale and regularity the US has not witnessed for decades, if ever, and violent suppression of free thought, criticism, and opposing viewpoints. That's China. And if you think I'm disregarding or devaluing the oppression of different peoples inside or outside the US, there's a much more wide scale, overt, and systematic oppression of many peoples in China RIGHT NOW. There are people getting arrested and oppressed based off the color of their skin in the US, but at least the state isn't dragging Muslims out of their houses at night by their hair, then putting them in concentration camps where they have their organs harvested and disappear or are made to work until they drop from exhaustion.
---
As far as this discussion goes, this appears to be virtue signaling. "Hey, I understand what is fucked up about the relevant discussion, but here's what's fucked up about YOU that I recognize and will interject with, despite it being off topic!"
---
Self-criticism is important, and while the US has a bunch of billionaire child fuckers, corrupt politicians, and what else you have to say about us, we are talking about China and it's encyclopedic collection of human rights violations that would make General Custer and his men shiver.
---
It makes you seem like you're trying to divert attention from the China discussion, which gives me the feeling you are defending them. While that almost assuredly is not the case, that's my first impression reading through it.
---
Shoulda just asked China for gold
---
Are you a cat or a fish?
---
Now this is content
---
Get Anger Management and try to pool rage after you have threat secured for the next pull. Bloodrage after the pull so it keeps you in combat to further prevent rage decay.
---
I'll often ignore skull altogether or throw one sunder before letting dps pull aggro.  I can then taunt it back if I need to which is essentially giving me free threat. 
---
After you get sweeping strikes and/or whirlwind, you can open with these with a two hander to grab a lot of aggro right away before switching back to sword and board. In typical situations, I think that the 2h tank always meta is full of retards. You really do take a lot more damage. There are certainly exceptions though.
---
Use berserker rage.
---
Hilarious? Like hill areas?
---
It all comes down to the opener. If you survive the initial burst or stun lock, the fight can usually be won.
---
Why does it even matter? just scroll to the next one. Imagine being this entitled
---
Forget it? Ive never even heard of it!
---
Not to be rude but just because your family gave up on you does not give you the right to try to bring others down and tell them to give up on their goals. (:

I mean yeah a lot of twinks are like that but I started off as the guy in whites getting crushed by a twink. My main goal isn't to crush noobs it to crush twinks.

I don’t know what that means, but Google says it’s something to do with South Park. Those guys actually have principles, and they live by them. I admire that, and it’s more than can be said about the sad nihilistic kids in this thread.
---
Is that the official reddit app? If you haven’t already, you should give [Apollo](https://i.ibb.co/GV93fGC/8-EFE767-C-8368-4137-ADB0-196-A79714-FDC.png) a spin. No ads and smooth as butter.

DD here as well. It's on the smaller side as servers go but I love it there!
---
I just checked. I really don’t see what you’re talking about.
---
getting the hit bonus, offhand dmg bonus, and bladefury are huge.  also riptose is excellent while leveling, 6 sec disarm and high damage for 10 energy is huge.
---
FUCKING MARAUDON
---
Rained on mine lol
---
If I could I would give this comment a reward! Thanks for your kindness! (:
---
I do use this. Issue is that it doesn’t then tell me how much damage it adds to my spells. I have to look up a spell coefficient list and calculate it myself. What I’m looking for is a add on that does that math automatically and displays it on the spell tooltip or somewhere else useful.
---
No, there are several differences I can see between us. The first is that I understand that practically every company in the world has done evil things - or if not them directly, then whoever owns them. I understand that it is practically impossible to purchase something without supporting somebody terrible. I also understood that the vast majority of the people who work at these companies are NOT evil, and that even if you are successful in your crusade to shut down evil corporations, 99% of the people you punish are innocent.
---
The third difference is that you are egotistical, and assume that your beliefs and practices are somehow on a morally higher ground than what other people choose to do.
---
In short, I'm practical and a realist. I'm not perfect, and I accept that it's impossible to NOT somehow support evil people, even indirectly. You think you're perfect, and somehow have the authority to police the world.
---
I kinda want a cat. My dog won’t sit still long enough to hang out with me while I play wow.
---
Yeah pre60 about everything works. Im 21/0/30 atm and I just tanked angerforge/golemlord runs for a friend. Sure I have something close to bis (for tanking) but still it was a bit silly ^^
---
You’re playing Star Wars battlefront. EA Games promote children to be addictive to loot boxing. And loot boxing is partially gambling. 
---
Better stop playing game’s from ea too buddy :/
---
Honestly deep frost is far better, the increased slows, shatter aoe, and greatly increased survival from barrier make you far more versatile especially on trash which is the majority of content on 5 mans. Arcane power is better for single target and that's about it
---
Bro I personally haven't done that at all, so at this point I just have to point out how stupid you are. Gave you a chance kthxbye
---
PvE servers are so nice. People are super chill.
---
Dude same, i played with a warrior and a shaman there cant remember their names tried many time to get my old discord but lost it. If you guys see this. Its me Locomoco the rogue, come back
---
how come you are both girls
---
On my druid I mostly quested and I mostly just AoE dungeon spammed with friends to 60. It's anectdotal but I easily got more gold questing (questing + minion grinding between turn ins)
---
And you care more about a stupid game that costs you $15 a month (aka highest priced game out there considering you get full released games for $60 meanwhile here you only get 4 months for a game 20 years old), than the lives of people being shot in the street for protesting for their freedom. Idiot.
---
It seems your boyfriend is actually your girlfriend
---
No, I wanna make an add on that tracks them like when you get your first mount or down a first boss, things like that to show the things you achieved (:

Not true, try basilisks in STV

This guy has sex everyone!

🦀🦀 blizzard fires employees 🦀🦀
---
So basically you're selfish. You raid only for yourself and not for the overall progression of your guild when it comes to raiding. Remind me to never play with you.
---
How do you accomplish fighting lower level mobs early on? Should I just grind in Durotar to 14-15?
---
Yo my dude that is a nice Hand of Edward. I have one on my paladin, but where is yo +30 spell power?
---
tldr. i’m not interested in reading paragraphs of projection and cope for the fact that you’re supporting an oppressive tyranny that’s murdering and torturing people in Hong Kong as we speak.
---
Yeah dude. Rolled on Wyrmrest Accord in retail WoW a few years ago. Never looked back. It's a fantastic community.
---
For the same reason you chose to post this. Because you can.
---
Think you've been watching too much The Circle!
---
Im not reading the paragraph again, but you can be as mad as you want. It will continue to be a common loot rule.
---
As a tank, I wish more mages thought like you. I'm convinced that mage is the new hunter.
---
Gambling doesn’t violate my principles. Murdering and torturing people in Hong Kong does. But keep coping, kid.
---
Thanks, I think lol
---
Oh and what do you know, Reddit censored my post because they fear China.. shocker
---
Love your Mordhau videos.
---
I love you both
---
Got it, thanks!

Where can one get this “skill” you speak of?
---
Oh ok
---
Aoeing two pulls and drinking &gt; killing every target 1 by 1. Take your tiny mage hate boner back home.
---
I've heard that one before
---
Wait you are seriously saying that alliance has no other trinkets than HoJ until DM? You high?
---
Ain’t no rest for the wicked, nor mercy for the weak.
---
Exactly this... If you don't like it then simply move on. I wouldn't want to be against people sharing their excitement and happiness.
---
any idea when bgs are coming?
---
Wait, how does it do either of those things? I could maybe see your point about it reducing the need for a guild, but that implies that a guild is only ever useful for he purpose of forming groups more easily, and if that’s how you view a guild then I can’t help but feel sorry. A guild should be a community of people from all kinds of backgrounds who build friendships and bonds with each other and help each other achieve their goals. Dungeons and raids are part of peoples’ goals, so you’ll do content with them of course, but if you’re just there because it’s an LFG chat with green text I just can’t agree with that. 
---
As for watering down the LFG market, that’s just false. As a hunter, I’ve had zero difficulty with forming or finding groups when I’m looking to reserve a specific item, or when I see that someone has an item reserved that I also need. Every class needs something from almost every dungeon or raid, reserving an item will only reduce the likelihood of people who also need it joining you, not everyone. Mages won’t avoid your group because you’re reserving Thunderfury bindings, that would be silly.
---
That's your perspective, not the truth.
---
My cat only likes to watch league I think he's broken
---
You don't have to say no! You do have a barber shop indeed in BfA! Plenty of them actually.
---
Yeah, I don't think I've ever actually managed to prevent a wipe with LoH. It always gets eaten by spell batching.
---
It’s not much of an accomplishment if literally every single person is doing it
---
Dungeons are much faster for people that do not know efficient quest routes.
---
Keep doing it for free the entire time you play on that server. Fuck these guys, they can't do *anything* about it
---
Dogs are an animal like any other. Nothin wrong with eating them. That’s just a cultural thing.
---
The rest I agree is awful though!
---
You're seemingly a very bitter and cynical person. Just get over it and move on.
---
Why did you link a 14 minute video lol
---
*double kicks rollin’*
---
Lemmy: Overkill!!!!!!!!!
---
Aye that was nice of you! Props for donating to the tank! Coming from a fury tank where Blackstone is #1 BiS.
---
Gotcha, I meant it’s not in classic
---
Nah compare it to warrior and making gold as a mage is a walk in the park. So yes mages have it easy
---
This is awesome. I've used it since the mid 20s. It grants exposure to huge quest chains and off the beaten path areas of the game that I've never seen. Classic has a ton of hidden quests that only open up once you've done some 10-quest chain on another continent. This guide seems to hit all of them. 
---
Is there any alliance version? I would love to follow the epic quest chains on both sides.
---
This a thousand times. When you don't even *have* a pet out, and you're blamed for pet pulling.
---
Solid 1 in a milion chance

Don't quote me but I think cleave group is another name for AoE farming.

Congrats, what an accomplishment.

It's already 450g on rattlegore
---
Wanted to share this somewhere as I can't believe how lucky I just got: been trying to farm this pattern for my epic mount for a little bit now without any luck. Started thinking today that I should probably switch as it's not really working... Next thing I know I get 3 consecutive runs with 3 pattern drops!
---
Looks like you got a talent!
---
Ty for some it
---
Nightcrawlers. Dragged out of inv to make space for better loot.
---
I have never heard of this.
---
I’m by no means a private server veteran, but not sure how this would work
---
What's TRP3?
---
can someone link me a good guide to get tailoring from 0-300? i have every piece of cloth i have found from level 1-56 which im currently at!
---
I understood it perfectly. Sure, tanks and healers have some crossover items with dps players, but saying it’s no longer possible to make groups because you’re reserving an item is silly. A given healer may only wait a briarwood reed, and be might not join the run, but that doesn’t mean every healer ONLY needs briarwood, there are still other good items in dungeons. You might reduce the total number of people willing to run with you, but not by as large a margin as you suggest.
---
No one got the reference lol
---
If you really want to go all in on a thorns build, the gold standard is going to be Force Reactive Disk. 100% chance of AoE damage on block is going to happen way more often than 1% change on hit.
---
Did you vendor it like auctioneer recommended?
---
Meh, if they're acting like you're full of shit and crying they probably have zero self awareness or are assholes. Skeram has gotten ridiculously skewed towards horde recently.
---
PvP servers are fun for me because if the person has an option to be an asshole it's more meaningful when they choose not to be. Makes the world feel more real.
---
Ow ouch owie I felt this one.
---
It's also a quest reward for the chest quest in Desolace.
---
Someone is going to come out of the closet when your kids move out;) just saying.
---
Yep, happened to me today. Sorry, warrior.
---
And now I got spotted twice by arena spectators while at a decent distance away from them after Vanishing once in that group. If they get aggro on you once, does that increase their stealth detection radius or something?
---
no cant split the playerbase. force people to quit or adapt, more people will sub then will quit.
---
Is there anyway for quivers on hunters to always be visible? It shows my quiver only sometimes and I don't know why it disapears
---
Did you get tidal charm tho?
---
I used this excuse once. That baby is now 13 and loves WoW classic along with his little sister.
---
That sweet 1g50s.
---
kind of just seems like most people on this subreddit want mages just to single target in every situation when that's not necessarily the best approach for every situation. I've gotten so many angry whispers for either not spamming blizzard or for using it at all even when it's appropriate and the tank has full threat on the pack
---
Congratulations, you're an asshole?
---
I will check on those, my server didn't have

You can (and in my opinion should) tank with Ravager into your level 40s. The AoE threat generation is huge.

Summon Succubus, turn of all her abilities, she will constantly regenerate mana at an extremely high rate, dot mobs &gt; drain life &gt; spam dark pact whenever you have a free global or between mobs. Doing this allows you to grind at 100% health and 100% mana infinitely.

75g wtf? How big is razorgore, grob is pretty mid sized and it's been consistently 20g.
---
Same here. Though it's a little disappointing because the ground cover looks so good. It also hides rogues better for extra fun.
---
weapon mastery is a broken stat in classic and this is one of the few items with it
---
This reminds me of a dad going along with his young kid's skit
---
I did around 17 runs, then Just bought it for 20g, totally worth it

He definitely knows, he just values the gold more than Epeen charts.  I think you are the one getting played lol.

Hell yeah! I ended up starting a guild with people I met/ran with during launch week. We’re finally filling up our raid team. Down to 8 pugs spots a week! (But we’ve been clearing 8/10 MC with 34 people - not enough to summon domo, next week!)

Great! I think this is the build I want for my druid. I plan on healing 5 mans while I level. After feline swiftness I'll just start pumping talents into Resto, then back to Feral. Totally doable, right? I'll be full Resto at 60 for both pvp and pve.

Anyone know why my weapon swap macros cause heavy lag spikes?

Then please elaborate on the relevance here, because the dude made a dumb as fuck assertion and I'm merely trying to figure out how he came to conclude it.

Just started a char on DD yesterday and levels 1-6 have been more fun and wholesome than 1-24 on my other server. Everyone on DD has been so welcoming. I'll never go back.

It's a reference to [this](https://youtu.be/rvrZJ5C_Nwg), magic happens at 2:23
---
That’s the issue! Thank you. Didn’t realize private severs didn’t model classic accurately.
---
Replies like this just add to it. You doo seem a bit grumpy. What sort of posts would you prefer to see?
---
Already have mate. Not sure why people would want to stay subbed...
---
Wowhead is solid for professional guides.
---
Yup, but those 4 tap w/ an arcane crystal and blue sapphire/azerothian diamond are orgasmic
---
That was bad even in vanilla.
---
My hunter thanks you!
---
As a first-time player of classic I thoroughly enjoy seeing other people get just as excited as I get when accomplishing things you deem "trivial." You have the option of not looking at things you don't want to. However we don't have the option of seeing things that aren't there because they've been discouraged
---
Try to use one of the channels that have a "Live chat" option
---
It’s a fucking joke you twat.
---
I legit cannot decide between maining my warlock, druid, or maybe even my rogue. Anybody have any insight as to pros/cons that might tip me in one direction?.
---
Wait, that ad is made to look like a post. What app even has ads?
---
I have 227 hours and am at lvl 47 but I  estimate that 30 of those hours is idle time looking at ah and leveling my professions. I’m happy with my progress

No, they are mushrooms.
---
You’re wasting your breath guys. They’re either children or adults who’ve never had an actual career. Either way they can’t grasp that the situation isn’t as black and white as they’d like to think, and that sometimes when you break the rules, you have to be punished, even if you broke them for a damn good reason.

question: with DM and warlock mount quest coming up

is it better to sell my shrooms as shadow potions?

You mean every DPS ever? I swear it's the hardest thing to do to get people to wait all of 3-5 seconds so the tank can build some threat on multi-mob pulls before everyone goes balls to the wall with AOEs.
---
One less person we have to fight for the drop/s. Thank you for not being competitive.
---
Sorry forgot the bear part, indeed 2 very different tanks. Best of luck!
---
As an actual twink player, I still try to help as much as I can. My main is warr so I know the struggle
---
Yeah I'd rather the dungeon take an extra 5 minutes rather than sitting around waiting for meter watchers to drink.  It's like sitting in traffic vs. taking a slower, less crowded route.  It may take a little longer but at least you're moving.
---
cool thanks!
---
Oh yes, then it's definitely Ambush.

You'll be out of Mana in a heartbeat by using exorcism and holy wrath. (Holy wrath costs more Mana than consecration)
---
And literally every dungeon after RFC/Gnomer, you get one person who AOEs and your threat goes bye bye.
---
Interesting way to go about it, give the whole party a threat reduction rather than give yourself threat increase. I'd way rather go the with increase and give my party Kings/might/wisdom. But you do you I guess, every prot tanking guide says improved righteous fury.
---
Which is exactly the opposite of what was originally claimed.
---
Ahh I can already feel the top of my mouth burning.
---
Can't you just play the game without making a complaint post?
---
Oh thanks I didn’t realize it was a joke by the fact it was a meme. Totally thought it was a serious post that happened
---
Ok so since I don’t care about raids, all I need is 5% max? Thanks!
---
They do have the right to sanction political speech tho, it's their game and competition
---
Probably bought ring run.

My guild let's anyone roll any number of times... But people help each other out after they get geared. Seems to work really well.
---
This is Cam Newton's WoW character
---
I've never gone behind the barrels yet he still runs off. In the video I just watched the rogue does the exact same thing as me and he doesn't run out. That being said, I noticed that the second the cast is done, he pops out of the LOS range so maybe this pulls plugger back... I'll try it out I guess.
---
In terms of stealth mechanics, I don't need any practice. I've played rogue for years and I don't get noticed by anyone (outside of resist) other than the spectators in the arena who have already aggro'd onto me because of a resist. I honestly think that something changes in their detection after you've been noticed once. It happened twice with the exact same group and I was well out of detection range. I may just have to use your strategy once Vanish and Prep is blown instead of going with risky plays.
---
I just dont want someone's enjoyment to be belittled. It's not fair to them when the complainer can just ignore the post. Instead many people would rather be negative towards the person that just wants to share their excitement. 
---
Not sure where I got worked up though, giving points and freaking out are completely different.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgyrxq/whatre_the_musthave_warlock_addons/). 
---
There was a discussion about this bug recently, it’s not supposed to affect druids in bear and cat forms. I thought we got to the bottom of it in consensus that it doesn’t drain mana in non-mana using forms. If this is for real bug is huge.
---
Its actually a good strat to do this cause im more likely to buy something if it has 69 or 420 in the price
---
If WoW Classic Classic ever comes out I'll probably roll an RPPvP Server.
---
You must be on a bad server i assume.
---
Yes and hunters can do it as well.
---
What do u mean
---
From the lame lol I knew you had to be Alliance.
---
Rogues get very fun in pvp around level 40, I mean they're fun until then too but they really come out of their shell around that lvl.
---
Are you on Bloodsail by any chance?
---
did you join /lookingforgroup?
---
It's still attention-seeking. Not something we should endorse.
---
If you're making an alt, and you're going shadow might as well trick it out for pvp.
---
Tailoring/Engineering.
---
Same goes for audio ambience by the way. I don't play alliance but for horde I can think of characteristic sounds, e. g. in the warrior district in UC you can hear the clashing of swords as soldiers are sparring.
---
I NEEDED THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH STRANGER!!!

"Gay Boys" guild went to raid onyxia's lair and instead of killing her they all went shopping.....

You should see the StarCraft subreddit. Every day somebody posts "OMG after X years I got Y rank"
---
Every. Single. Day.
---
I think I used to play with that priest in Vanilla through wrath.

That's fine. If you could read you would see the part that says "ask the tank what he wants to do". So for you we'll go slower.

Oh, yeah lol. The way I do it is significantly faster than the ring runners. I’m just getting shit luck yet I’m sitting here with HoJ &amp; Painweaver &amp; Mask of the Unforgiven &amp; Gyth’s Fire Res lol. Just can’t get Blackstone
---
Of course you should use your shield. In a contestant area you should always keep your shield up no matter what. Its basically the first rule of priest pvp and didnt change in 15 years.
---
Lmao yeah bc you can buy Blackstone on AH.
---
Accomplishments are diminished when you're acknowledging everyone for the exact same thing. It is no longer an accomplishment, it's a participation award in mediocrity. It takes away from the truly accomplishing feats in a game. 
---
Should we be handing out praise every time someone levels up? Or, every time someone buys a new skill? This isn't toxic, or negative. It's being real on the fact that when you hand out a gold star to everyone for doing the same thing, then it's not an accomplishment anymore. When you lower the bar to the ground, it's just become something everyone steps over. Similar to getting level 40 and buying a mount, everyone does it. We don't need to have a new post everyday of someone else doing that.
---
I bet a hunter with ravager deals more dmg in melee than they do in ranged. Melee hunter was a thing in vanilla and can very well be better depending on their weapons.
---
Randy is that you ?

okay that’s probably best for me since classic is my first experience with wow
---
What an absolute fool!

Depends how many locks you have. The shadow priest is effectively doing lock dmg*.15+his own dmg if he gets the stacks up quickly and maintains them.

To counter detection, bots would want to look like a real Mage player.
---
Feign Innocence
---
While I agree wholeheartedly this game isn't 15yrs old. It's been out since 8/2019 and no vanilla isn't the same game. 
---
However you are absolutely correct and I should be able to post what I want on a public subreddit about a popular game that released this year.
---
The detention camps are just as real as the 
---
American-japanese internment camps that were in America during the world wars. They're as real as the North Korean work camps in Russia and China. Do you honestly think China just HAPPENS to have the highest organ recipient rate in the world,and that people have been going missing in prison for decades and that it's just a big coincidence? Human organs can only come from one place and China is using human bodies as a resource.
---
Warlocks are good but simple, moderate to gear in pre-raid pve.
---
Druids are situational but fun.
---
Rogues are good at all aspects a dps should be and fun, but very hard to gear because they are fun.
---
Honestly I'd say warlock. PvP is going to be a big thing coming up, rogues are painful to gear and druids are only good at narrow aspects of pvp.
---
Just like your face! Haha just kidding, the sharpness is adjustable on this as well though so can be tuned down to your liking!
---
There are also way, way too many people on Herod to keep prices of infinite supply items (like the ring run) at high prices. Me and some other enchanters tried to set a pricing cabal but couldn't get buy in from enough enchanters to make it work.
---
Level 1 Aberration
---

---
Underwater breathing trait tho. Worth.
---

---
Good luck. This is classic
---
I didn't think I needed to stipulate that I am talking about *highly valuable BoEs* every time I mentioned them. Obviously I'm not talking about Lei of Lillies here.  
---
When something is 100 times more valuable as any other drop in the instance, it should be treated differently than those drops. It would be insane to treat it the same as something that is worth next to nothing in comparison.
---
Won't be sold until every rogue in a raid has it already.
---
Giving up Leader of the Pack among all the other feral talents isnt worth even considering til 60 imo
---
Where were you to back me up on this a few days ago? I was told I got rekt for getting 1 shotted by a lvl 60. I'm lvl 30. I got GANKED! Not rekt. Noob.
---
&gt; This was always a mechanic.
---
I even remember watching TM/SS guards running back and forth between the two cities, was pretty funny made the whole thing look like the whole place was just a proper war with even the guards involved lol
---
He fell for it twice!
---
are you saying you don't like the 100 dinging lvl 60 in org/sw posts?
---
I think the best is the mix of both, a good guide (legacy-wow) is very important, but at certain levels if you get a good group for example SM and ZF runs, it cant be beaten. Pros for the dungeons is steady xp, no time wasted on traveling, and good money from green drops. Cons are obviously bad groups and obviously if you play at non-peak times it might be hard to find one.
---
As a hunter I am quite pleased that mages attract the communities ire now.
---
This made me actually laugh out loud. Perfect meme sir
---
What if an alliance mind controls the player of your faction?  Can you pick pocket then?
---
Classic WoW is not the game we grew up loving. It’s filled with idiots kids trying to join the “I played Vanilla” club, and Blizzard and their circle jerk politics
---
my buddy made about 3k with lwing

---
i dunno how ppl do it. i'm 30 and i have 8 gold. I have about 15 unlearned skills and have only spent 2g at the AH.
---
Mine is visible most of the time - I wish I wasn't.
---
Haha sorry. It's good to be honest with yourself though :) .
---
that's because that price reasonable
---
Part of the issue is that the mods will axe other content that they deem "low effort", so the sub is left with: "hey guys, i did this very achievable thing", or "look at this whacky roll, what are the odds!!!!", or "look at this beatiful fishing spot guys!!"
---
I get that there is a lot of shitty memes, but let the community vote for what we want to get to the top.
---
Pservers usually die pretty fast. That is not the case with official blizzard servers. You are not too late.
---
Didnt you see his post? They got him muted and no mail service..
---
I only charge a fee for Crusader, but that's because it cost a fortune to acquire. I had good timing and talked a guy into selling me one for 200g during a short lived price drop. Just the rod to cast the enchant costs nearly 200g with tips and fees included. My first three enchants of it netted me a total of 3g I tips over the course of one night. 
---
I'm not waiting for two months to break even on a 200g investment, so now I charge 10g for 1, 15g for 2. I've only had a single person ever take issue with this, and over the last week I've repaid my investment (and some debt).
---
Given that Crusader is by far bis for almost all melee, AND that it's radically cheaper than spell power or healing, charging an extra 10g is not unreasonable.
---
There's a good guide on icy veins, too. First hit on Google if you search wow classic tailoring guide.

It's usually the dumbass warrior that does this from my experience.

---
The problem is, they mix RP and RP-PvP in their numbers, and we are only interested in PvP realms where these kinds of fights happen. If I combine PvP, and RP+RPPvP, then it's about 55% horde, 45% alliance. I suspect the percentages are a few more in favor of Horde, since PvP servers generally have more Horde.

Sensationalized doesn't mean it didn't happen.

Only selfish ass holes would prevent people from seeing their family and honestly it makes you no better than the people you're protesting against. What if that person is trying to get home to see a loved one on their death bed? No one thinks of anything but themselves and their own goals and objectives... No one ever considers how their actions truly impact other people's lives.

Why do people make fishing sound so tough

Yeah I was dead set on playing Alliance on Herod but my IRL friends and I voted on PvE vs PvP and the PvE vote won by 1 so we rolled on Pagle. It was probably the best move; everyone there is super chill. I’ve grouped for every instance Alliance can reasonably run pre-60 other than RFD/RFK and I’ve only had good experiences with everyone. No elitist no-life neckbeards yet, no griefers, no ragers. 
---
Pagle is a dope server, at least for Alliance. Think it’s like a 70:30 Ally:Horde ratio
---
I think he didn't get the spirit.
---
I mean, I get it, but is it really hurting you? If you don't like it, why do you give a shit?
---
While making said pvp server just a knock off pve server with the odd 'i like being the underdog - until i don't' player.
---
Just downvote them like I do.
---
Suit yourself. Just know that isn't how the majority of people roll on gear lol.
---
You are just as egotistical and misinformed as the real Cavil...username checks out
---
2 dozen now!
---
From what I understand, avoid RP-PvP servers. They're more likely to have trolls apparently.
---
I don't see the point playing in a non-rp server if you like RP. You can always level multiple characters.
---
You ever consider playing retail WoW then?
---
They tried, but weren't prepared for the actual trillionaire autismos that've station traded 4-4 for the past decade nonstop
---
Was the helmet 14 or 15 FR?
---
This is an extremely egotistical take. So you guys have it all figured out and anyone who gets excited about this kind of stuff is just too dumb to realise?
---
Do you ever maybe think that everyone else figured it out but were just smarter than you because they decided they weren't going to it ruin their enjoyment of life?
---
Being cynical and pessimistic all the time isn't being smart. It's being unable to get past problems and holding yourself back with an emotional grudge against life.
---
PvP makes some of the best gaming of all time

You can use `GetCoinText(random(1,9999))` to get something like "23 Silver, 58 Copper".

---
the hero we don’t deserve
---
The gold value you get from running an instance more or less averages out across the entire party - you all get some greens, some trash, some items from bosses to vendor, etc.  
---
A highly valuable world epic BoE like Edgemaster's Handguards changes this dynamic. Now one party member is going to get a tremendous amount more gold than all of the other party members, so it needs to be handled differently.  
---
A highly valuable BoE epic drop is ***not the same as a regular green drop worth 86s***. It just isn't, and you have to stop pretending that it is.
---
I hit a rich thorium 3 times and got back to back arcane crystals. Saw on auctionator that they were going for 50G a pop and had to change my underwear.

Roll in an RP server and learn as you go. Most of our community is welcoming and helpful to new players!
---
he's merely trying to show the hypocrisy of american public on Reddit atm
---
I'm on a RP server and outside of organised events there's not a lot of RP going on

I doubt it's an RP server with the human typing stuff like u instead of you, and tho instead of though.

Definitely start on a RP server and learn as you go. Remember not every person in the world is intrinsically familiar with the world and its lore. Average joe knows his village and a little beyond. Similar to how in our world not everyone is a world history, politics and geography buff.
---
There's one in my raid group in a sister guild. Literally only one and once my guild recruits a few more people they're going to be looking for a raid spot somewhere else.
---
His damage is usually around dead last (competing with the ret pally) and i can't think of a scenario where the 3% spell crit is worth it over taking any non meme spec.

Do you actually feel like you're in the right when you are unable to answer simple questions?

ClassicLFG is an amazing add on. It alerts me when someone in a different channel is putting a group together so I can whisper them. You miss trade chat groups when you aren't in trade chat, and /1 groups when you are in town.
---
Warrior has pre-raid with some post-raid BiS (rated Best) pieces in every slot except for cloak. Seems to be cursed with cloaks not dropping. Druid won the Stoneskin cloak over him the other day.
---
It's not that I'd want it "that bad." It literally dropped by coincidence and I would then have the chance to not have to spend hours grinding the gold for it. And why would it not be just as fair to say, "if you want the sums of gold it's worth just go farm the best g/hr for your class?"
---
There is no right or wrong way to play the game. Do whatever you like. I’m sure there are key binding videos on YouTube you could learn from. Keybindings will make your more efficient. ... also remove that ‘s’ key! glglgl have fun playing classic!
---
Thanks ! It really does, but mechanostriders are hella noisy !
---
How to afford your mount at 40:  
---
Wrap 1 linen cloth in gift wrapping and CoD for 10 gold to as many people as you can.  More than zero percent will pay the 10g to see what's inside.
---
The point of classic is putting effort into social interactions. If it's casual, you stop valuing them as a person and instead more as an NPC with a score.
---
I don't want people to share that attitude, I want classic to be an MMO and not an MSO.
---
Blizzard, as usual. Complete lack of any sense. YOU DID BAD THING,  WE PUNISH. O NO BAD PRESS,  WE PUNISH LESS.
---
Could have pulled him aside and been like hey don't do that shit and no one would have cared.
---
It's just people not realizing that their achievements, although they mean something to them, don't matter for anyone else. You are just a random on an internet forum. Why would we give a fuck about you reaching lvl 40?
---
But then again, people who are looking at new posts are the ones who decide which posts I see. Maybe a random guy having a cat sit at his desk is the most exciting thing they were seeing that day.

He’s just going to continue on this way, idiots like that can’t be reasoned with, let the dumb ass greed while the rest of the group needs. I hope he stays broke throughout classic
---
First of all I would not report anyone for doing free enchants but fees are not stupid. Every other profession has a easy way to make money except enchanting and every other profession is a lot cheaper.
---
I spent about 400g leveling it and then another 350 on recipes so far. If I ever want to make that back I need to take a fee. I can not have people maybe tip me 1 gold. And even if I could its not worth the time.
---
Why do you even do free enchants is a better question? Even though peiple are wrong in reporting you they are not wtong in that you are fucking up the economy for everyone. I mean you don't do it for gold because going out afk farming anything will make you more gold. Tou are basically just fucking with people who spent hundreds of gold to level a profession and stopping them from making any money back. Enchanting is already a really hard profession to make money with unless you have super rare enchants like the MC enchants. Why make it worse for everyone?
---
Do you really sea lion?
---
As someone who plays on an RP-PvP server (Grobbulus) I haven't had this experience but I could see it happening. I think the biggest let down for me is RP emoting and talking in character all the time and most people just don't care. I've never had anyone actually troll, but typically they talk balk normally like "oh thanks :)" or whatever. But that's not too bad!
---
I'm considering selling because they don't look that good. Or am I wrong? I think a Kroll blade would help me or a lot more?
---
Dal’rends are only bis if you can enchant them with +15 agi but you can’t atm :)

On alliance
---
It's classic! I'll get it eventually (I have given up for now though).
---
Just for initial threat. Not off cooldown. Them being undead and me using holy generates more damage than in other dungeons without undead.
---
I've been running spell cleave groups. The mages all get salv and never pull because I have them all aggro'd with consecration.
---
That's optimized, yes, I'm saying you can get by without it. The kings or might really isn't a huge dps increase.
---
Beautiful.
---
Sometimes not so rare items like to pretend they are rare. It's just bad luck. You will get the item eventually. If you want to save time you can do as others have suggested and get a +37 boe staff.
---
Dont worry what these kids say, I would also fuck my sister if she was as cute as yours

I wouldn't worry about it too much. People get annoyed at bad mages, but they also take notice if you're actually somewhat competent at the class, and haven't completely bought into the whole "Spellcleave!!!" shit.
---
Which is why Blizzard definitely disabled the ability to delete your account on purpose (even though they said it was because of a high number of requests being processed), because they know most people will want to come back. Can't come back if your account is deleted.
---
Both :)
---
These are v contested and slow spawn rate
---
They are also a bit too low level, 53 54 to drop really good greens etc
---
Nope, but I'm guessing things are easier for you when you pretend everyone else is, that way you don't have to be held accountable for what you say and can just make silly assertions all the time.
---
I'm worried how she's look at that baby.... like it's a snack
---
I have. Lvl 40 pali. The /sit macro can work but differently. Do this.
---
When the mob attacks, do /sit, as soon as the animation is finished stand up, or move forward. Usually by the time your getting up, the mob is swinging again. There is a small time frame between you standing up, and the animation finishing where if you get hit, you still get crit and it gives you a reckoning stack. It takes some time to get it right, but it is fully functional. You keep your stacks until you use swing at something or logout.
---
Warriors a simple people. "My head can fit in this bucket. It will protect me."
---
Yeah but how much did the potion cost to make?
---
I did the back and forth stromgarde quests with a druid in my grp and I had a mount. I was surprised with how little ground I actually gained on him (of course I was ahead running back to town each time but he was always right behind me). Also you dont get polyd in travel form which is a bonus.
---
Yep. I'm playing on Zandalar Tribe the EU RP-PVP
---
I disagree with you on fees. It costs to level up a profession, it costs to acquire recipes/formulas/patterns, and lastly time is money. It's nice of people to do things pro bono, but that doesn't mean fees are "stupid."
---
Is Peacemaker better than Barbarous Blade in phase 2?  🤔
---
Sea lion.
---
I don't even get time to Target the savages nevermind /wave lol
---
So what you're saying is you have more right to kill those mobs than OP?
---
Oh I know, I was talking about all classes more so
---
This was actually good one. I salute you.
---
Holy shit. Blackhands Breadth? Any trinket off Overlord Wyrmthalak? The maraudon quest trinket? The resistence trinket with +8 to all resistances? Pls stop being purposefully stupid.
---
Good to know
---
exactly, automating the system is bad, QuestShares just gather the player and share the in game nick, them you will whisper the person.. but before you also have the option accept/reject the invite based on his reputation
---
Thank you for the advice! I will definitely look for those videos and start practicing :) and I am having a lot of fun with the game too :D
---
Can't believe people still think anybody looks at them.
---
Ok thx for explaining
---
I don't pvp. I play on a pve server
---
Thought it was per month.
---
Ahh, thanks. Now I get it
---
Mograine?
---
At first I thought comfy was an odd word choice.  But you’re right.  It is comfy.  WoW is probably the most nostalgic thing in my life.  So many years dedicated to playing, and yet I can’t stand it now.  So when I am reminded of times when I enjoyed it, it’s super comfy.
---
I'm on grob. It's a rppvp server. PvP is definitely nice but ganks really do get annoying. So far I've been ganked countless times and it's getting a bit annoying. But PvP is how it should be since we are opposite factions.
---
People have crunched the numbers dip shit, look it up
---
If the lock doesn’t have death coil up or succubus out, it’s a lot harder. Surviving the opener is the hard part though, in a 1v1 rogues can get a super opener:
---
Sap, stand around til restealth 
---
Use your cheapshot / stopattack macro, stand around til restealth
---
Cheapshot and burn, 5 pt kidney after cs wears off
---
Then the lock ideally would deathcoil, fear, dot and laugh maniacally, or be dead, soulstone, then deathcoil, fear, dot and laugh maniacally
---
I've been farming throium for three weeks now and small veins are 1-2 taps, rich thorium veins are 2-4 taps + rare gems. Nothing different than in vanilla.
---
Yeah I get that it's a training thing. It's just too time consuming to learn dying and dying over again.
---
I am 43 and I am at 70+ gold now. I will just keep questing and buy it at soon-ish. I am shaman so ghost wolf is good enough.. I think questing and leveling fast is smarter than just farming for a mount at 40. Unless you are like a Warrior with no mobility improvements.
---
World first 60 in classic. Jokerd or jokerdtv on twitch.
---
Nah, you are incorrect, and probably bad at the game. Why you have to spread misinformation to being the good plebs of reddit down to your level is beyond me.
---
I can promise you that even with not forcing fee's you can get your money back.
---
There are people who will play and do things differently than you in this game. The sooner you realize that the better. 
---
It may be hard for you to grasp but I bet you can do it.
---
so did you?
---
i don’t know what his comment said. but leveling a warrior to 55 in classic has made me reconsider if i even like the game.
---
&gt; Husband: sweet, that takes hours
---
I mean, if the water hasn't broken yet the hospital will just send you home to wait. Could at least get a maraudon run in.
---
That wasn't the point. The point wasn't how they treat their animals like crap. Only how it is a defensible position to be okay with eating cows and not dogs. I'm a meat eater myself, but feel that most people shit on China for eating dogs while they themselves eat other kinds of meat themselves. Probably lots of different types of meats that are horrendously treated and slaughtered in China, wouldn't surprise me.
---
This is one of the most reasonable posts I've ever seen on Reddit.
---
Do demonic runes and dark runes share a cooldown?
---
Sorry i worded it wrong, they count as swings so they should proc stuff like SoR or SoC. Command only procable once.
---
What is this Oceans Dwarven?
---
Lmao i sent this to both hunters in my discord this morning
---
I know man. I am still legit sad about that. I had Mallo ever since the Echeyakee quest in The Barrens. But I didn't wanna risk losing Broken Tooth by running back to a stable master. I wish I could have released him in a nicer zone. The Badlands doesn't seem like the best place to live happily :(
---
Nice, were you soloing?

imp renew does not scale with +healing, it only amplifies the base healing of the spell (according to hydra), which is why nobody takes it

Still totally worth it. Bloodsail Buccaneers is RP server (don’t have to RP). There are a ton of folks taking it easy at lower levels and lots creating alts.

I had the same thing and was suspecting foul play with the drop rate, but now it's back to normal.
---
Zandalar Tribe seems like a really good community. Played there in the beginning until queues disappeared from my main server.
---
But it adds nothing, go to Instagram or something. I want discussions not karma whoring
---
Hah, I actually thought about whether I should use the word comfy as it was the first word to come into my head and seemed like a strange choice, but it covers the load of the feeling of just having some light fun in Classic.
---
Getting by isn't optimized...

All of which include improved righteous fury, it is a must have talent to have after getting consecration. Without it you're only hurting yourself by getting less aggro than you could, and salvation'ing your whole party is a bandaid that can be ripped off.
---
Believe me when I say that salvation should be backup in the event someone surpasses your threat gen, because in your example when someone constantly pulls threat, you have to tell them to stop doing so much dmg and there is nothing further you can do to mitigate their threat gen.
---
With imp righteous fury you won't have to throw salvation on anyone (and actually buff them), then if/when someone surpases your threat you can throw salvation on them.

Can’t expect every player to be cognizant of what is happening, most are halfass grinding anyway lol.

Karma has nothing to do with it. Those people would still post it here if upvotes and downvotes didn't give karma. They just want to share with as many people as possible.

Giving us glamour with that red Alexander McQueen sunhat from the 2006 fall collection. A leather scaled chestpiece is showing off a little bit of body, with that designer Diore kilt of elements keeping the look couture. The shoulderpiece was custom made, henny, and the look is CORRECT. 
---
It's a total success for me.
---
Our guild loves Druids because they can tank when we need more tanks on a fight and DPS/Heal when we don’t. Our Druid tank is an absolute unit for tanking too. He has like 11 or 12 thousand armor and a ton of HP

yep

Dude blizzard literally shit down other similar addons because it goes against the spirit of classic. This is not going to catch on and quite frankly I hope it never does. Why would you deliberately make something blizzard already shutdown and told others not to make?
---
You, OP, had the guts to say what many of us couldn't. I salute you!
---
Also, keep the 420 / 69 in game people. It's not worth a post.
---
warlocks 1vs1 is utter ass cancer. Coil into fear is basically game over
---
Huh. I could have sworn it was a limited item. Most of the time I have spent there has been at 2 or 3 in the morning. So probably half asleep when I was looking through the shops.
---
Those aren’t mutually exclusive though. Getting ganked is getting rekt. But getting rekt doesn’t have to be ganked

Vanilla went up to 6 clicks on rich thorium and was almost always 4 or more.

I'm thinking about abandoning my pvp server and moving into an RP server instead before Season 2 comes along. I'm only level 24 on my main there so I wouldn't really be losing much.
---
How is Paladins at tanking dungeons 1-60? I don't mind being relegated to healer in raids, but I was wondering if I could get away with being dps/tank in dungeons while leveling. Is this generally fine or would it be better to stick to healing/dps and let druids/warriors tank?
---
You heard wrong.
---
Fuck blizzard.
---
Which server is your main? Otherwise, which normal pvp realms do you think are good?
---
No you fool. This is why we aren't on Facebook. THIS IS A FORUM BOARD. Not a place to stroke your ego
---
Thx but I don’t want the import option, i want the one where I can create predefined ones. Like one for the cooldowns.

Well played my friend. And people say it’s horde who gank while ally are fighting mobs....

I thought this was gonna be some copy pasta or a joke at the end. Cringe.

In ultima online you used to be able to pickpocket all the gold a person had on them. Everyone was very adamant about banking gold, but as a pickpocket sometimes you’d get extremely lucky.
---
Sure
---
Wait can you actually do this? This is brilliant.
---
Mages, how does your class's popularity effect AoE grinding spots and searching for parties in dungeons? I'd consider rolling a mage if AoE grinding is available, but not so much if not because single-target frostbolt spam while leveling is really boring to me
---
He is your brother so therefore no.
---
Phase 2
---
Have fun with your flamestrike and coc non-crits lmao ae is the worst dmg/mana aoe spell
---
*( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*
---
You could just stay feral for leveling and heal 5 mans fine as long as you have healing gear. Going resto is going to be really slow for questing.
---
Doesnt matter if you use cloth or leather for healing, as long as you have the right stats.
---
Nice to hear. Thanks for letting me know &lt;3
---
Eh, i'm mostly just worried about filling the role in the below 40-50 dungeons. I like being a healer and am a healing main on retail, I just like to fill other roles as well. I'll probably just offer to tank early on and then let warriors and bears take over at 40-50.
---
/me rolls a 12, oh FFS!
---
This is the definition of ninja imo
---
Layout of the zones and flight paths make horde leveling much more streamlined, substantially less travel time
---
Afk cat on fire
---
honestly it rly depends how the roll turns out. If he starts out needing and you guys just randomly greed for whatever reason I can see why he doesn't want to just reroll due to your stupidity.
---
But 9/10 times I'd call that a ninja yeah sure.
---
Make a support ticket instead of a Reddit post.
---
He said he leveled to 55 as a war and deleted it to go rogue because he wanted the name.
---
Questing is slightly faster then just staying there and continuing to grind... there not far from each other at all... you get 150-200 exp per kill so that adds up to be probably faster then running across the map to turn in a quest. Obviously the best way is to get multiple quests , set your hearth, complete all your quests and tele to turn in. But you can only do that once or twice in a zone. 
---
off OP was killing greys for mount money then yea.... huge waste of time.
---
He’s joking right? He doesn’t really sound like this right? Gotta be trolling.
---
&gt;pickpokets
---
Damn, really? You can two-man that place?
---
I'm having a giggle at some of the negative comments here, telling OP to essentially let people post what they want, while simultaneously telling OP *not to post* what he wants.
---
That's some hypocrisy right there.
---
On the topic of this thread though, I very much agree that meaningless self-congratulatory posts are way too plentiful here and I would personally like to see them gone.
---
You dont need to minmax is my point. A Ret paladin can tank is my point. I dont need more aggro because I do enough damage to keep aggro
---
If someone pulls threat they get BoP. And the mob immediately aggros back on me. Most players know how to use threat reduction spells too.
---
It's a different style to play, neither are wrong

How have you managed not to run into another person at all in the game?
---
To be fair, you didn't say please.
---
&gt; Look up the definition. I'll wait.
---
Derp.      
---
You used a double-negative, which makes the whole sentence convoluted and difficult to grasp at first or even second reading. It wasn't about the word "sensationalized", which, by the way, is an unfounded claim in the face of the *evidence* I first presented.      
---
 Double-derp.
---
I mean it's a 55 dungeon, the bosses aren't that hard and you can skip essentially all trash.
---
We'll see how plausible it is in classic though, so far it wasn't a thing in vanilla since none probably thought of it, but it's been a common thing on pservers and it was always possible cross entirely different cores, and nothing seems harder in classic than it is on pservers, so yeah I'm quite confident it's possible.
---
&gt; Like the full set runs about 10 gold
---
Man I wish my servers were like that. 8 stack of em goes for about 60s on one and 90s on the other... Watched the prices drop as everyone started farming them.

Decursive is very easu addon that will dispel stuff with click of left or right button, depending on color.

In general for raiding all you need is a Healbot, Decursive and Deadly Boss Mod.

The point is they have the right not to. And they never have before as far as I can tell. Don't want to hear what gamers have to say? Don't interview them.

The important part is that you sell it when your ready to spend the gold right away, because gold will keep inflating for a long time. Good luck.
---
This is purely personal experience. I respected at 40. From arms to fury. I have regretted it ever since. I even tried respeccing several times. To see if my talent choices were the issue. I still miss it.
---
I think its expecting a bit much of pugs to treat something differently, some of these people are new and don't know what they are rolling on, so the rules should change that one time. In regards to u/Hsteph34 I am not trying to twist words and I missed you saying highly valuable, sorry about that, my bad.  I am in the minority against the reddit hivemind here, an invidious position at the best of times but probably more so on a warcraft sub. I was suprised to see a person talk about rolling greed and a dozen  asmongold-esque-army types jump on it and say "don't be stupid roll need" it goes against the narrative I'm used to having played since June 2005. To me at least the "stupid" is people responding with "you're stupid" "lol" "you are pedantic" etc. I am trying to rally support against the need camp but that isn't happening, and that is fine.
---
I do appreciate your argument
---
Actually looking at his posting history, it's self explanatory
---
Back pedaling, keyboard turning, and clicking spells! Still can beat a rogue who gets the opener with a mob already aggroed. Does that mean the rogue is bad or that locks are just *that* broken? Lol.
---
You'd be surprised at how many dps pick their own target.
---
What I did was arms to about 58 and changed to fury when I had some hit% gear. If you can get executioners cleaver off of AH it absolutely wrecks things. But definitely wait till you get hit gear because you'll be missing a lot
---
I don’t think it has to do with his class, tbh
---
Mobs can definitely mana burn me as a cat or bear
---
Wow, did it really? I'm not sure why either lol.
---
Imo phase 2 is a good cutoff point. Anything sub 50 will be a death sentence on a pvp server until phase 3 after phase 2 launches.
---
I'm sure there's an unfortuantely large amount of Mages who have invested so little ranks into spells that _aren't_ Blizzard or instant-cast that a single-target Blizzard probably does more damage for them.
---
I get that, I didn’t do the one where you go to desolace.
---
Dude wants to give back and give free enchants. Why is that so hard to understand? If you wanna charge for your enchants, then do so. If you don’t wanna charge, do that. 
---
You’re bitching does nothing. 
---
I look at it as he is helping lots of people allowing them to tip what they want. You look at is he fucking over every other enchanter.
---
So you are agreeing your argument has no merit
---
&gt; Sure and we should protest. However remember before this everyone was fine supporting a country that supports US behaviour.
---
No one in the US supports this behavior. Most of the public doesn't even know why we have a privately run prison system (exploit the people for free labor, such as chicken factories, etc).

&gt;By Amy Julia Harris and Shoshana Walter / October 4, 2017
---
Yea after thinking about it was debating dropping blood rage and last stand for 1 shield block 4 defiance.  I dont really see last stand being as valuable as the extra threat like you said.
---
You'll be fine.
---
As has been said, if you arent sure what sort of Druid you want to be, level as feral. Kitty is your best damage for mobs around your level.
---
Volunteer to be healer, and see if you like it (bring some +int gear and lots of water). See if you like tanking.
---
Druids can do anything, and are fun.
---
Great company!
---
Well this is true of course but things you buy from vendors will remain the same price. For example the epic mount.
---
Feels like I'm playing FFXIV with all this server tick nonsense.
---
I hope so. Posts like this give mages a bad name and it’s unwarranted from my experience, though I know servers can be different. I love playing mage and I take pride in my CC. AOE has its place but mana conservation is my top priority. I’m not trying to out DPS anyone, that’s ego shit. When the tank pulls I’m ready.
---
The main reason for this post is too boast about his bis twink and lvl 60 with epic mount and tier 1 this retard literally just thinks he’s good and wants attention lul
---
Ah yeah I'm on Horde so I always forget that Pallies will roll on plate as well
---
This isn't true.  Someone decided it was but the difference actually in crusader's favor but still almost nonexistent.  Someone is putting it as a BIS inclusion without running the math behind it and people are assuming it is correct.
---
If nothing is agreed upon before the roll. Then you may need if you need the item. He needed it, you didnt. If you actually needed it then press need. It seems pretty simple.
---
Yeah the first few times I did the run I would keep going with vanish on CD, but it's seriously not worth it. Taking a durability hit and having to run back is worse than waiting for vanish to be off CD. Also don't forget that sprinting to the entrance or the rock to reset the mobs is also basically a vanish. I've only ever had the same mob resist me once. But sometimes you just get fucked. I've definitely gotten two pickpockets very close to each other and it's really annoying. Not much to do about it though. Just chill out for the vanish CD and start again.
---
With the last boss, I use sprint &gt; garrote then immediately run right behind the lip of the first corner. He usually casts but it doesn't go off, the comes over to me. It's easy from there. I'm also combat and in prebis plus a few epics, so the bosses are the easiest part for me.
---
Delete this man. For your own sake. Killing lowbies 12 levels below you isn’t much to gloat about. Let alone make horrible political meme references that miss
---
Say it with me folks! THE N*****!
---
After DM comes to classic the gold will inflate. Wait a week or two and you should be able to sell for higher.
---
Frenzy will easily stay up near 100% of the time with a 1.2 cat or even a 1.3 speed cat as well. Broken tooth will proc more Gift of Arthas as it has faster attack speed. That's an extremely minimal increase in dps. His biggest value is casting pushback on pvp targets.
---
Iam on gandling and i like it there
---
With DM lasher farm alot of gold will be generated so id wait a bit to see how it plays out.
---
Is your time limited to game or is it a difficulty issue?
---
I get frustrated when I’m stuck at a part, but it has to be a real pain in the ass for me to just drop the game. Most of the joy is overcoming difficult sections, that feeling of sweaty palms and adrenaline were my jam.
---
Yea I woulda gone fury/prot but there's quite a bit of pvp, I dk honestly if I could function without 5/5 tactical mastery.
---
If I played a priest, I would rather people asked for buffs how I did it in the screenshot than running up and saying "buff plz"

I love that when fighting rogues. Pop the soul stone, insta-summon your demon, DOT, deathcoil and watch that last sliver of health they had vanish.

I would highly recommend looking for a guild so you can find people to regularly clear raids with instead of constantly looking to pug. It will save you lots of time in forming groups.

It absolutely does make an enormous difference ...
---
Let alone the huge increase from combat OH damage increase OR the fact that sword spec/mac spec activate off your offhand aswell..
---
Over time the quest rewards and loot from quests that you don’t use can be sold. Additionally, I would def recommend 2 gathering professions. Skinning is insanely easy as you are already killing mobs, also others are killing mobs. I would also imagine herbs are always in desire as potions are consumed. Start an alt so that you can disenchant items where the results is worth more than selling the item
---
unsub from /r/classicwow then
---
Spy
---
As others have mentioned, the goal of the champion was to break existing rules to get his voice heard. In that case, it worked. But I'm not certain that this worked better than a heartfelt message.   
---
If you watch the actual clip, the winner's delivery was quite unprofessional. Everyone was laughing like it was a prank. There are better ways to talk about social issues without having to make it punishable and risking your position in a company. He could have said that back home there is a lot of conflict, which has made it tough to succeed this year, but he is persevering and hopes to be free enough to play in future years. Something subtle, yet powerful and emotional.
---
Sounds neat, I always forget that most of DM isn’t 60 because most gear pieces from there outclass any other dungeon.
---
As level 60 priest I went three points in renew. Damage setback and raids should be minimal if any and usually if there is you're probably fucked. Damage setback in dungeons is a little more common but much easier for the tank to pick up. Also remember you're going to be spending more time and dungeons than and raids for the most part and renew will help you out more there. I wouldn't worry too much at all about holy reach.
---
Dad gamer boomers SHOULD be discouraged from jerking each other off
---
I mailed the stuff about a week ago, but just yesterday logged into the bank for the first time. I know that mail takes an hour to send usually
---
HEY LOOK EVERYONE THIS GUY CANCELLED HIS WOW ACCOUNT! see? nobody cares.
---
Having a resto set with full int gear is more important than anything else.
---
I want to play warrior dual wield with Fury spec, but I know everyone says this is inefficient. W/e, it's for fun.
---
Will I still be able to tank dungeons by doing this?
---
Also the fact that you cant use abilities while equiping a base level gather item like a mining pick or skinning knife in your MH so its just a huge waste of materials if i remember correctly
---
Mograine is good, about 50/50 Horde/Alliance split, and no queues, might have to sit in a short queue on late saturdays tho
---
a lot of tanks have a superiority complex. that's a fact, not an opinion
---
Just Some of information to make life easier. No modifiers needed. Simply make one for each of your poisons like I demonstrate in the video.
---
It’s literally one click to apply poison to the weapon of your choice without a modifier.
---
I had this exact same problem. Downloading the newest version of bar tender addon fixed it for me.
---
Never knew it was possible to write actual scripts like that in WoW. Do you have a link to a guide that is more about the extent of logic allowed in WoW macros?
---
That's basically the break point for ghetto healing dungeons. Even with a full healing set you'll limp through Uldaman and get absolutely wrecked in ZF/ST/Mara. 
---
You can cobble together a reasonable Resto/Ele hybrid spec.
---
I know. I mailed the stuff about a week ago, but just yesterday logged onto my bank alt for the first time. So the mail should've been there, but since I didn't log in for the first time until AFTER I mailed it nothing was in the mail.
---
The talent increases damage done by offhand by 50% 
---
If damage from your offhand is de-rated compared to your main by 50% then yes the overall damage of your OH would be 75% of main hand
---
Damn, I did not know I was that bad, thanks for the feedback though.
---
You should save for a mount, but travel form is a very good mount replacement so it's not a tragedy to not get a mount at 40. I got my mount at 45.
---
Ha this is awesome
---
This is one of the most pretentious posts I've ever read. If you don't like people sharing their experiences with the game then don't read those posts? Many other people like reading them. This Sub doesn't revolve around your interests, funnily enough there is a diverse range of people on this Sub that like to share different things. Get off your bloody high horse.
---
I was experiencing this randomly and when happened couldnt connect at all or took many attempts. Had to reinstal game twice inbetween, but in general it was irregular, couldnt observe any pattern yet.
---
Shut my mouth or what ? Are you threatening me ?
---
Healbot, use it.
---
That used to be the case, but it's not often I see people outside cities or farm quest areas after duskwood. Most of the people I see now are level 50+ people in any zone on mounts passing by.
---
If you have shatter you're wasting a rediculous amount of damage by casting nova after Fs&gt;Cone.  All that dmg could be critting but you use it on 1 AE? Goofy.
---
Damn, only 20? I give casters 3 stacks and healer 5. Tell them to spam it. Food to whoever wants some. 
---
But yeah, not everything is an aoe pull. Some of these mages are clueless. A mage on my server named Reddit (lol) was spamming blizzard on every pull that had more than 1 add. 2 adds? blizzard. In UBRS, so level 60. 
---
It’s actually crazy how so many of them have absolutely no idea what they’re doing. It’s certainly annoying being a mage when the “mage bad” circlejerk is so strong here.
---
The Crossroads really is the centerpiece of the Horde. I gotta hand it to Blizz when they named it, literally the crossroads of Kalimdor. Seems to me even a flight from Silithus to Gadgetzan swings by that place.
---
On a lower population server they're still going for a fair bit more, got a bid in over 200g on the first one I put up so far :).
---
This isn't what normal RP is like at all but it's definitely better. Expect less Dwarf pickpockets and more Cathedral District soap operas.
---
Why not run as your spec? I have no problem getting into groups as a Enhance shaman!
---
Raise Hell, indeed.
---
Sigh. Sure man whatever you say. Then keep scrolling.
---
horde probs the guy is pretty much gallywix.
---
You have just repeated what I said with different wording.
---
no thanks, either re-roll with the look you want or play retail with that option
---
Nice pecks
---
Hurtful
---
Why not a “achievement daily megathread” I’m in a lifting group and they added this because every post was someone’s daily PR and no one cared besides the “you rock” “keep it up” cringe posts
---
You can always rely on yourself to put in maximum effort, but when 4 other people come into the mix you will be disappointed more often than not.
---
I use VanasKOS since it can alert you to your faction as well. Use it to remind me of ninjas
---
Aren’t we supposed to be boycotting blizzard?
---
Good idea
---
For the three things you listed there won't be much time lost because most of that takes place in dungeons. Depending on your server a lot of people already raiding so not having a 60 could mean you're already losing time.  Now trying to do Quests once Phase 2 hits is going to be a little bit more difficult because everybody's going to want those honor kills.
---
What would you imagine any company with just the slightest bit of reasoning would say?
---
They want to cater to China while offending the Western world *as little as possible* (granted, quite a lot in this case) - not actively reject the Western audience.
---
Thank you for your input!
---
False.  If you have a brain you do the shatter combo and then kite.  They have a 60% slow after the fs cone combo,  if youre getting hit after thats on you for fucking up.  I have never had this issue
---
I just noticed you had stromgarde up, I knows it 37 but finding a group for that would net some decent Xp since they’re elites.
---
It’s 4/5 of the post... so I have to spend 20 minutes scrolling to see any actual content
---
Never was.
---
I was talking about death so its a 100% loss for the rest of the fight because you'll get one shotted unlesd you're a warrior in raids.
---
And my boss fights are only 45 seconds long because we use fury tank so threat is less of an issue. Maybe you should read my previous comment again and try to understand it before you comment something which I've already said.
---
With that logic everyone is fucking everyone else over in some way. It’s one single guy doing a nice thing. 
---
These poor enchanters. Every single high level enchant is done by him for no charge. Not one other enchanter is getting any business. He ruined enchanting single-handedly.
---
Level 40 rogue here without a mount, is pickpocketing sm a good way for gold or should I continue questing? My professions are herb/alch
---
A cat cat would have listed the server, but a cat fish only lists one attribute.
---
You don't have to be prot unless you're raiding+tanking. Arms or fury is fine for tanking dungeons.
---
No actually delete your account, not just cancel your subscription. There was a controversy where people were requesting to delete their accounts and suddenly no one was able to (all four methods of verification were disabled).
---
Yep it's very strange, the only pattern I've really noticed is that it happens a lot on flights.
---
It also happens when handing in or picking up quests sometimes.
---
Hypothetical scenario: don't be dumb and just roll need.
---
Because they're Blizzard. Because it's the Diablo franchise.
---
Sure those two are biggee in the Western world of gaming, but heck, we still talk about the damn mobile game all the time and we're supposed to act like don't even give a damn. Surely it will be highly anticipated in China as well.
---
need to just nuke china tbh fam
---
I don't know much about making money as a Shaman, but assuming it'll be your only level 60, then I'd probably keep it. Who doesn't want some low-effort gold?
---
You're making something so easy sound so difficult.  Its been done, just because you dont know how to kite/play the game doesnt mean others gotta deal wit your shit
---
The website isn't just another addon, or just "more than a dungeon finder" is a community gathering tool, that I started for WoW Classic, but will hopefully expand to other games.   
---
Blizzard has the option to add or remove features, but the community have the option to create and share, and then is up to the users to embrace it or not if they see has an utility to his game experience.  
---
For me was just another way to contribute to the community of a game that I like, and also has professional on the industry to develop a bit more my expertise with web development.   
---
But thank you for your feedback :)
---
oh you should block it then, keep all these types of posts out of your feed. since you hate blizzard and all
---
Just looted Stockade Pauldrons. There aren't any on teh AH
---
How much is this item worth?
---
apparently (haven't checked) ressing at a diff. GY ports you to the original one
---
You can heal it, you and your group just need to be really smart with your pulls and you have to manage your mana better.
---
Are you wearing gear with Intellect on it?
---
Are you downranking your heals if needed?
---
Are you spending mana on unnecessary offensive spells?
---
Are you using Mana or healing totem as your water totem?
---
Are you drinking in every single break in combat even if it’s only one tick? 
---
Are you prioritising the tank over dps?
---
If dps are taking excessive damage at the same time as the tank that tells me it’s either an intended  mechanic or the dps are not managing their mechanics or threat properly.
---
Healing in classic is a real shit show if people pull like its retail. No amount of + healing gear can heal through stupid.
---
You can heal any levelling dungeon as Enhancement with a bit of patience, gear, good group and an understanding of your toolkit and it’s efficiencies. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Man i would rip off those guys so hard. Its impossible to maintain that market controlled with only 50 peeps.
---
yeah it's pretty awesome. The wowhead guide i'm following actually has me go 1/2way down assassination tree for improved slice n dice and SKIP riposte entirely
---
Later stages of ulda are tough depending on level, but if you have a full healing set you should be ok. I've been healing BRD at level 54 with only 15 points in resto, it's definitely doable
---
Gamers really are the most oppressed people
---
it's almost like retail changed things for the better!
---
I think they make more money with 4M subscribers that enjoy buying micro transactions and cosmetics than 10M people just subscribing. New WOW caters to those people.
---
&gt; You also don’t need a max level toon to RP
---
Lies. Level 1/20 transmog options are extremely limiting. Hard to RP when you look like a clown.
---
Nah sounds stupid imo
---
Get your world of Warcraft fan porn shit out of here
---
The “and importantly” item is a bit odd but could be written off as a typo.  The rest of your nitpicking  reeks of confirmation bias.  You want it to sound like it’s being translated from a letter originally written in Chinese, so anything that isn’t 100% something *you* would say makes you think that it’s not written by a native English speaker. 
---
If this were translated from a Chinese letter and made to sound like it wasn’t, they would have explicitly done a better job.
---
Wow, 0.4 seconds seems like a massive window. Especially when it comes to those down to the wire heals, thanks for the explanation. Do you by chance have a source for the 0.4s? It sounds legit but it would be nice to be certain of it to theorycraft around
---
Are you really on wow classic subreddit arguing that wow classic should have micro transactions? Lol
---
If people didn't want these posts you hate, why are they constantly getting upvoted and on the front page? Its almost like people like seeing that stuff.
---
Magic Reflection FTW!
---
In Jux Sanct
---
Screw that! Buy something more expensive lol
---
I don't want to be an asshole though.  I want to have faith in humanity.
---
well I tell ya, if I get this message I just jump to 60G and tell those guys thanks for the advice
---
400 tops
---
I agree. I've been thinking about this too. Annoying.
---
All of a sudden I am seeing a lot of warriors tanking using 2Hers (around level 40, mostly armory and cathedral). None of my groups have had any problem and we did fine. Is this a new meta or just a coincidence?
---
It’s on the front page. Blizzard can suck a commies twat.
---
Probably depends on class. Warriors probably any efficient grinder would probably be better to quest.
---
E: you also have to think that getting BIS is faster at 60 than any other level.
---
Cortellos riddle...couldnt find under a bridge until I turned the setting to 1.  Literally right in front of my eyes.  Lol.
---
I can’t tell if this is a joke or not.
---
Yea pretty much, i'm agreeing with you. I just wanted to emphasize the fact that he made use of his post match interview to say it.
---
Nothing in this game is low effort
---
Yeah seems like you shouldn’t be on a pvp server if an add on like that is needed
---
This game is so old and basically all the strats have been figured out. The lore is ancient now. If you think you can scrape any new content from the bottom of the 15 year old barrel then be my guest, it would be interesting. But it would be hard, if not impossible.
---
Its basicly what /r/wow is.
---
wow and just like that no one gives a shit about what Blizzard did. People will keep supporting their content. And people wonder why companies pull this shit.
---
I've been wanting to get back into Eve for years now. Hoping the game isnt too messed up when I go back.
---
There are so many people on this thread that have no clue what theyre talking about its pretty impressive.  If you went to math class in school you would be aware its just as mana efficient to do the nova coc combo.  Oh and it does more damage.  Now if youre dogshit at kiting then yeah... youll have some fucking issues.  Its clear yall are looking at beginner mages and forming opinions on them.  What a joke, youre just as ignorant as them
---
Maybe. We killed the bosses in there, never got the rest of the badges.
---
yeah and if you block the subreddit it comes from, it wont be on the front page - that way I wont have to hear the bitching of some 12 year old who is bandwagoning internet outrage. you understand how that works?
---
I hate Blizzard as much as the next guy/gal, but the idea that this press release was written by the Chinese seems like a naive take on how these things actually work. 
---
As you pointed out, the inconsistencies are typical of PR letters of this type because literally everyone in the PR department is contributing. It's less of one man's apology and more of an amalgamation of everyone trying to spin the new punishment/apology levied by Blizzard into a cohesive message. Brack's name is only on the bottom because, in PR speak, it portrays accountability. 
---
Having worked for companies like Blizzard in the past (not in PR), they most likely have PR departments that specialize in messaging for each region. I would be shocked to learn that Blizzard let their Chinese PR staff write an apology for westerners. That's just not how these companies typically operate. 
---
In the end, anything is possible, but this seems a little bit to conspiratorial for me.
---
Absolutely not. My entire screen freezes.
---
This is a perfect example of reddit's short term memory, we went from "fuck blizzard" to "hey lol watch me play wow classic" in a matter of two days. I had to scroll so far to find even one person saying free hong kong. Wtf
---
Nice try, Blizzard.
---
Pretty sure that's unhealthy for you since they aren't designed to do that. Something with the kind of plastic being used.
---
i am not a mage but saw a vid of a mage solo'ing it, sheep the melee burst down the casters,
---
I never used a script, but I used to emote "stole 10 silver from you." on my rogue in the early days. I received many nasty messages from people demanding I give back their money and was reported enough that a GM told me to stop it.
---
I levelled a priest to 60, and am currently 30 on my rogue because I decided I'd rather play that.
---
Don't sweat it.
---
I strongly believe these are being created and up voted by Chinese bots.
---
I’ll get on that.
---
Yeah, those quest where you collect hats and badges are meant to be grind quests. They take longer but you net decent exp for doing them.
---
I know you said grinding wasn’t your bag, but that is mainly what the downtime between quests is.
---
Yeah maybe I should try that more. It takes a long time it seems like for me.
---
Hence the name
---
I think there are plenty people here calling me a piece of shit for playing the game thanks
---
Mate, I can run like 10 wows on my one computer.
---
Boosting implies you're doing all the work, when it is not the case here. You also didn't have mobs on you at all times, you killed or got them low enough to run away/walk slow on your first pull for example. You also didn't pull Herod from what I saw glancing to the end? Not sure.
---
"one pull" implies you pull it all before killing them, not pulling some, killing most and leaving a mob following you whilst you pull the next lot.
---
Yeah what he said ^
---
Do you have a strategy you could share with a fellow priest? :)
---
How to get banned 101
---
I feel like I should have picked up on that, sorry
---
Only reason I can think of is if people need less than a full stack, then they can buy exactly what they need from the single stacks; it's less likely someone will need a full stack of something that's not an ore, herb or other high-demand crafting material.
---
However, I can't be arsed to buy out 50 individual items, so I'll drop the extra gold in most cases to just buy 3 full stacks and either save the leftover for later or relist it. (even with auctionator and being able to buy things much faster than with the default UI)
---
You should indeed get back in Los at the end of his cast, if you time it well he never moves.
---
I couldn’t agree more. Does this sub not have any moderators or something? And if there is, they’re doing a terrible job at making this sub interesting
---
Likewise nobody is making you read threads you don't care about
---
What are your thoughts on the rules? 
---
Lots of things banned like tidal charm, potions, etc. Lots of things left unbanned as well.
---
I can't wait for this tournament!
---
Well that's part of it but mostly it's because some very unpleasant guilds decided to play there so you run in to a lot of toxicity.
---
The odds are 1/10,000 but okay.
---
Lvl 60 Druid here, passionate druid for many years. Go full cat spec for leveling, Will by far be the most effective for solo play. For dungeons you will tank, not heal! Get the talent that makes ferocious bite and demo Roar Better. Cast Hots on yourself before big pulls for aggro &amp; survival. Regen mana passively in forms. Get a mana bar so you know your mana while in forms! Feel free to ask more questions
---
Both of you are shameless copycats!!!1112$
---
how... does it work? Can I use the term Kanye at all?
---
So my own personal experience was to spec arms till 60 then go prot tanking till you get a decent amount of both tank and dps gear, then join a raid team and ask what they want. 
---
Afaik, arms is frowned upon in raiding because ms takes a debuff slot and it's your main source of damage, and you only need two tanks per 40 person raid group in p1, so most likely you'll be starting in a raid as 2h fury. 
---
From there it's up to you to figure out if you want to get more hit % and crit and go dual wielding, or more crit and damage and stay 2h. Also since you'll most likely be going 14-17/34-31/0 spec as a warr, you'll have a bit of room to spec how you like. (Or just do w/e, but be preped to either get flamed or prove them wrong)
---
After raiding a bit for warr raid gear you can get some 2h weapons to then swap back to arms and go pvp.
---
A little more on dw (dial wielding) vs 2h, 2h puts you more in competition with other 2h warrs (luckily no shamans since your ally) and gunning for swords or maces if your human will make alot of human rogues salty. I personally am a dwarf dw fury dps and I opted to go grind up gold for edgemasters while they're cheap, so this let's me go for 1h axes, which imo is a sweet spot. Noone really wants them on ally.
---
Hope this long post helps.
---
How occasionally do they have events?
---
23 runs in to strat live on my warlock looking for the necklace. 4 of those runs there was someone else in the group who would have wanted it... it dropped two of the times there was someone else and lost the rolls...
---
Takes forever to find a tank for strat live cause no tank gear over there. I can understand the satisfaction, but when these runs take 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the group when it takes an hour to find a group each time, I just want it to be over &gt;_&gt;
---
Even if you do have the capital is boring as fuck unless you are into spreadsheets rather than actual gameplay :/
---
Is Blizz fucking trolling us?
---
I have a couple down selected heals out if I have less mana. Do higher level ones become less efficient or the same?
---
situations like that everybody should be aware of the "everyone greed!" ninja roll attempt. everyone should agree to need roll from the getgo.
---
I'm not even going to take the time to type out a real response to this as I don't even know where to start.
---
I'll just leave this here.
---
You're wrong and a nuisance to your group, even if they don't come out and say it.
---
I’ve had pretty good experiences overall, but something about Arathi puts people in terrible moods. I’m not quite sure what it is. Like 80% of my bad experiences happened in that zone.
---
Enjoyment of a given activity is generally opinion based and does not require research.
---
Your actual research, isn't actual research. It's self-reported, no controls, nothing remotely resembling hard data. A bunch of folks deciding to waste a few hours right clicking things in discord is not good research. It's hilariously facile for you to project like this.
---
You can do your own 'research', by playing the game instead of spending all your time trawling forums and chat rooms to believe anything you see written down without once attempting some right-clicking and respec'ing on your own. It's an entirely amateur way to approach any of this, but which 'false facts' you decide to propagate and which ones you decide to like bothers me not at all.
---
Enjoy taking as long as you possibly can to do anything all because someone else, who you also don't know, told you something you immediately believed because it was in spreadsheet form. Your inability to be fooled is truly spectacular, hopefully you can use your unmatched ability at ferreting out the truth for good and not evil.
---
I'd rather check Taladril's Work on the Druid discord, he's a better druid
---
No I’m saying not everyone minds them as much as you might.  I’m saying exactly what I said.  It’s classic wow not classic payment methods.
---
/silly *new troll here*
---
You've been collecting a healing set right? Hybrids need to maintain many different sets of gear.
---
Lol, this post isn’t going to last long.
---
Taladril is a beast indeed, he has tons og good stuff on the Druid discord
---
Not in the later level dungeons. But in the lower level ones it’s easier for a warrior to get threat with a 2h than with a sword and board. Also the ravager proc is the closest you can get to aoe tanking
---
10g really isn't anything compared to the world buffs. Not worth.
---
Oh nice have not heard about him I'll definitely check him out
---
I think there's a bit of a culture disjoint in RPing. There's two groups, the one you're in is one. General desire to RP in general, with more or less everyone. Second group being people who only want/intend to RP within a small controlled community aka their guild.
---
Exactly this.... I can recall posting a meme a couple days before launch and having it stripped for low effort. At the time the entire front page was ‘low effort’ memes all at 1k+ upvotes.
---
If every hybrid only ran as their leveling spec then dungeon groups would become extremely rare.
---
Most good warriors should be tanking like this around 36+ thanks to whirlwind. You can also talent into stuff to keep rage so if you feel like you need to swap to defensive stance and protect yourself a bit while you get healed up, it's fine.
---
Tanks can get away with a lot since they’re in such high demand. For many even the chance to roll on a desired item outweighs having to wait for another Tank to show up that won’t roll on that stuff. In this new threat/dual wield Tank meta I see a lot of “prebis” gear for Tanks being the exact same as DPS prebis gear.
---
Sure, but if enough people turned and did what Kaepernick did (in their own spheres of influence) the money hungry corporations wouldn’t have enough power to discipline anymore.
---
How are they going to discipline every single player in the NFL? I’m giving an idealistic example, but the point is to not be quiet just because they seem to have power. If enough people speak up and do something about it the tables will turn.
---
i didn't have riptose for a while and went imp snd early...quickly realized that was dumb because getting blade fury asap is ideal.  decided to try out riptose and was very impressed with the damage. it also saved me taking so much damage
---
Ive aoe farmed to 48 with some dgs inbetween to keep it fresh.  The spots are pretty contested but you can find pockets of downtine where you'll have it for a bit.
---
This actually just happened to me. Fiery weapon drops, previously stated we all roll need. Roll comes and everyone greeds and I didn’t see and rolled need. We had a roll off and I would’ve gave it up if someone else won the roll.. that’s absolutely a ninja. If they refuse to give it up from a re roll
---
No shit dude, that's the entire reason why streams and their friends form their own guilds.
---
And could you please explain to me how exactly you twink at 60 ??
---
Lightworks is pretty limited in features. I had to go through some gymnastics to get certain effects I wanted. Even simple ones like a credits scene or zoom.
---
Clutch!
---
Which video?
---
Depends on the type of hybrid. An Elemental Shaman pre 60 can typically heal just fine in their normal set. Only at 60 do you start needing a second set.
---
Holy shit, you crit so hard it destroyed your keyboard's print screen button.
---
Remember this the next time he's looking for a tank.
---
Yup they wouldn’t.
---
But unfortunately the first few people that do it take the brunt of the sanctions and fines/etc.
---
PoE?
---
Not entirely certain. This current event is being split into multiple parts. If you want, I can send you the link to their discord.
---
Yeah 100% RNG is not the reason you have so little gold
---
Ya better watch out for thief catcher Thunderbrew!
---
quest when nobody is on, grind dungeons when the homies are online or when you are in between quest levels in your areas of choice.
---
I'm 42 warrior, I've done a solid mix but part of that is that armoury offers so many relevant gear drops that it made sense to be there even after I had helm/ravager/shoulder because I might get more, and there was always a group looking for a tank for it, so no downtime.
---
Yep. Nobody owes you shit, including charging the same inflated prices. Crybabies like this just make me want to undercut even more.
---
The companies exploiting the Chinese labor force are based in Western countries. It all comes back to colonialism and imperialism and the economic dominance of western powers. The reason no one can turn their back on China is because of the cheap labor, (although companies are already bailing on China and setting up shop elsewhere), because of Chinese investment and capital, and because the market is so massive. In the case of the NBA, the Chinese market is one they have been trying to build for decades. Yao Ming is the comissioner of the CBA and works closely with the NBA. This means the state is involved as well. The NBA has like 400 million viewers in China. That is larger than the U.S. pop. It would stupid for them to ignore this market. Blizzard and NBA are far from the only ones tapping into this market. The pork and dairy industry also export a lot to China. Are you going to stop consuming dairy and pork because the industries cater to the Chinese state??

Yes, that’s what having morals in an immoral world does to people.
---
Edit: There’s a reason MLK and others like him died or have been/are oppressed. That’s exactly the conversation I’m trying to have.
---
Edit2: word

Definitely not.
---
beautiful. transmog was always a bad idea in my honest opinion
---
Hopefully a permanet ban for abusing the report function!
---
He is an amazing theorycrafter and player, best known for hos Work on bear and cat
---
Yeah the noise they make is supeeeeer annoying
---
415 kills sounds like an exaggeration, it would be almost 3.5 days /played
---
 I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 Cremini, a number 6 with extra king trumpets, a number 7, two number 45s, one with shiitake, and a large soda.
---
Imagine never trusting anyone who also does that research. As far as games go there is just hard data. This hard data is collected from people who have credentials and Done the research themselves through experience and testing. Classic wow has been around in private servers forever and this research has been done by them already. It's no different then trusting a well credited scientist on his research
---
It's sad you guys are still supporting this shit.
---
But people just put up with it and support them still. Yea they'll "never forget", but Blizzard wins by people still playing their content.
---
Wanna know why they disabled the authenticators? They knew people would shrug it off eventually and by then the authenticators would quietly go on again.

American companies have shitty behaviour and they get away with it because of stuff like this.

Fuck Blizzard, freedom for Hong Kong.

return to the pserver scene? they are still around
---
Teach a man to fish.
---
&gt; He is helping people by screwing over others
---
If you think that giving a free enchant is screwing over others (since then they lose out on the gold from selling an enchant to that same person), then by your logic, anyone who sells an enchant is screwing the buyer over - since then they lose out on that gold.
---
Meaning, your logic makes no sense.
---
All players.
---
I heard the same, I think it's possible with some invis potions. I usually just suicide at the end of each run and run back as it's faster than going all the way back out.
---
I need some advice on where to quest.  
---
I just hit level 34 after doing 3-ish levels of mob grinding. I've completed a fair amount of quests in Thousand Needles and done a good bit of Hillsbrad. I'm hoping to find some place that I can go that'll have 5 to 10 quests I can do. It seems like I hit a really massive break in the quest flow where each area I try only has 2 or 3 quests that let me stay in the same area and finish them.
---
Any opinions? Any places that would have a decent amount of quests I could pick up all at once at level 34? Thanks in advance!
---
Hi, /u/Hudyn

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dh06bv/took_my_son_on_a_boat_ride_today/). 
---
Could you show me those credentials? 
---
It is entirely different from peer reviewed processes, which was the exact point I was illustrating with my previous comment and which clearly has escaped you.
---
I've got 14+ years playing this game in various forms, two pre-TBC pservers inclusive. Which - you would know if you did bother learning things instead of regurgitating spreadsheets of dubious repute - did NOT have the same damage calcs on pretty much anything. These differences were discussed widely on every server, and sometimes variant from server to server.
---
Try again. As I argue with a lowbie about leveling efficiency and I'm already working on my 2nd toon's prebis here in classic. Why do I ever engage with people like you? You are the reason those atrocious prebis lists and guides on wowhead and icyveins exist, almost always written by folks from various class discords. You and the logic you espouse is why we see hpal lowbies using Focal Sword and other such nonsense.
---
Why do you feel the need to devalue what other people feel good about? Are you some sort of accomplishment police? You are essentially bashing what the whole point of classic being different is. Every small achievement makes people feel like they actually accomplished something and they wanna share because of the excitement they get out of the small things and what a magical thing that is especially in today's gaming scene. Some people who never played the original form of this game, or maybe not even any of the old classics that didn't shower you with congratulations for the smallest things are experiencing real grinds and "real achievements" in a game for the first time and the fact that they share it means it still hasn't lost its magic.
---
&gt; I'm sorry to be rude, but this sub-reddit is turning into "I'm so proud of reaching this level", "I've never played WOW before, so proud to have gotten this item/level/mount/etc", or "I just wanted to share this special moment that I'm really proud of". 
---
Weird... I wonder how this could have happened? Maybe because so many of those edgy private server dwellers went around telling newbies that "YOU RETAIL BABIES/NEW PLAYERS WILL NEVER REACH 60 LOLOLOLOLOLOL IT'S TOO HARD FOR YOU, YOU PROBABLY WILL STOP PLAYING BEFORE FIRST MOUNT HAHAHAHAHAHHAHHA GUYS AMIRITE"? Maybe the elitism of statements like that, which got spammed all over before classic launched made the genuine impression that it actually is so extremely hard to reach these milestones as a non-veteran so people feel very proud about themselves now? 
---
Think about how you felt when this game was new and you reached all of those milestones for the very first time. Sure it is nothing special for us but if you have no idea what you're doing and you aren't min-maxing the hell out of this game and you don't even know the world then it is definitely more of an achievement to others than to you or me. Add to that the picture the community planted into the minds of those new players with what I outlined above and it is not shocking at all for people to feel so strongly about their achievements in classic.
---
Ah wow, didn't even know they offered that. I assumed people meant the same thing when they said delete/deactivate
---
It's weird to see Rage potions are allowed but Thistle Tea isn't. Both crafted, both class specific consumables.
---
Oh, and, "Shamans are allowed up to 4 totems before the duel starts" only 4, why not more?! 
---
/s
---
The automatic mute really needs to be disabled, especially for classic. This is exactly what people were warning about more than a year ago.

Me with dreamfoil in the crater..
---
I'm super keen for phase 2 and can't wait til honourable kills are implemented. As a mage, I'm not sure if there are certain items or stat priority to look out for PvP. Would appreciate more insight to this as I'm a bit nervous to get rid of something that's real good for PvP. Thanks
---
You can make a fair amount of gold that way.  
---
Other options:
---
- Just keep questing. You'll earn gold very fast from quest rewards and probably get your mount by 43 or so.
---
- Grind mobs. The crocodiles in the ruins on the Shimmering Flats (near the exit to Tanaris) is a good place. Just finished there for about 7 gold over an hour.
---
- Do professions. Look at what herbs/potions sell for a good amount on your auction house and go farm them.
---
Yea seems kinda unfair
---
he's an angry elf
---
Silithus has loads in the caves
---
That's a dude.
---
The guy has 25 days played
---
In kind of a weird spot for leveling.
---
Currently a fresh 58 Priest and I've done pretty much everything in Plaguelands and Winterspring save for the elite quests... is Silithus worth going to?
---
I know I can do dungeon groups but I'm playing in quick bursts at the moment so I'm mainly looking for things I can do solo.
---
[Sure](https://i.imgur.com/IrJiIqu.jpg)
---
Maybe you are. OP is clearly playing WoW. Who is this "we" you are talking about?
---
bloodlust from incendius hereeee
---
fuck that guy
---
Main is lock, but stuck between sham and rogue for alt.
---
Sham is going to be a bit more desired in groups, but solo isn’t as fun. Already have caster. 
---
Rogue solo is  super fun, but way oversaturated and likely less desired in groups. Also, already have dps character.
---
Yeah in dungeons around 60 I give six stacks. I want people drinking for one tic of Mana between pulls.
---
I'd be only interested in RP servers if everyone was roleplaying all the time. Sadly that's not the case.
---
Warlock
---
That's not really a good defense to a point they aren't even making.
---
Some prebis upgrades just don't really make much practical sense. My version of this is the warden staff, there's no need for me to get it if I nab a unyielding maul from DM
---
There's nothing wrong with saying people are getting a bad price/performance ratio
---
You're misinformed dude.
---
1 feature was pulled from the API and the rest were left as-is as they working addon feature dont tread on sacred space.
---
Classic LFG is working better than ever and the developer has personally gotten the thumbs up from blizz employees.
---
You may not like the tool hit it does not break any rules.
---
Is it easy to solo?
---
Oh yeah or rogue how could I forget
---
They are right tho, you are screwing over every single other enchantes who worked to get their skills up and patterns, im an engineer so i dont really care but i can definitely see their point. Im only talking about enchantments that your screenshots show tho, i dont know about the market manipulating.
---
Ps. i play on razorgore too :D
---
Ayy! For the Horde!
---
Not loading for me. What are the rules on engineering tools?
---
Id prefer the dagger
---
What can I say, I like to live dangerously.
---
Clearing Naxx 40
---
Yep, hoping to get the pattern for Arcanite Reaper off Bannok as well (though I can only kill him in one of his three spawn locations, the other two seem linked to to the nearby packs :(  )
---
You're dumb as shit
---
It creates the illusion that people have moved on. Which is a shame because there are no doubt cool things happening within the communities in blizzard's games but they do not deserve the spotlight over what's going on right now
---
1v1 tiers I’d say warrior/paladin rape mages
---
A warlock is gonna win this
---
100g easy
---
No I don’t actually, I’ve said this myself in a post saying to boycott them, I’m just being a dick to be a dick
---
Witch!
---
Your logic would make sense if there were no reason to level a profession other than marketing, but players are going to level professions regardless. I don't owe a 300 enchanter "gratitude" because they were going to level enchanting regardless of whether I buy their stuff.
---
"Yes that must be it".
---
How the hell do you think you’re the only one on a server?
---
Feral Druid or Ret Paladin
---
gotcha. any good?
---
Its so fucking AIDS. As a tank with mining and smithing, the only way I'm gonna be able to make money consistently to epic mount is by charging for tank runs. Rich veins are impossible to find, smithing can be great if you luck into the plans, and I can't efficiently grind mobs as a prot war.
---
I've seen the bears in felwood recommended, particularly for skinners.  Supposedly like 30g/hour in grays, plus skinning yields.
---
It *doesn’t* sound like a Chinese person wrote.  I apologize for not conveying that opinion properly.
---
Well that's your fault for rolling horde
---
As a boomkin I get some many people stopping as saying that I'm rare haha
---
Any way you could tell me about the farm spot? 3 levels away as a mage and need about 40g for my mount and would like to have it at 40.
---
How to lose an argument: Insult someone, deny facts, bow out while insulting them if they respond.
---
Hopefully you're just being funny or you really think I'm braindead. I was talking about on this subreddit.
---
Sounds like you have it pretty well figured out in the pros/cons dpt. It should be up to what you are looking for from your alt - solo or group stuff, or if you just want the option to DPS or also to heal. Shammy could provide an alternate playstyle compared to the pure DPS if you go that route, and can be played as a melee DPS as well and not only caster. Up to your goal and your priorities.
---
&gt; Great Rage Potions (not Mighty Rage) are permitted.  
---
 Thistle tea is banned.
---
???????????
---
No mercy for anyone ever.
---
If they arent on your faction, fuck em.
---
Every time. I dont care how much they cry, wave, help you out. They could turn on you at any moment.
---
Not worth it IMO.
---
All Horde are KOS or ignored due to mutually assured destruction.
---
Yeah man it did for sure! Do you feel I'd be able to tank/off tank dungeons my level as a 2h fury? I have some decent damage and about 3% crit chance from armor/wep. I feel like my aoe dmg is ridiculously good and I don't have a problem holding agro, I feel if I drop sw for fury tree I can balance out my aoe dmg and single target perfectly. I'm usually in zerk stance even when tanking while switching to Defence stance when my dps dont target who I mark/to catch a stray

It's not just images lol So relatable.
---
It is a bug.
---
This! Most of the things in the game will be considerably cheaper. Currently white vendor weapons are more expensive than green ones in AH. That will not always be the case. I remember selling a stack of light leather for 2 golds in TBC currently we are on like 10 silvers at best. And light leather is insanely easy to get imagine how that changes the capital of low levels.
---
Yea I'm wondering if I should start leveling engineering now, or what until it launches to be sure it can be solo'd. Don't want to drop herbalism and get engi to 275 if it's impossible to solo.
---
That's called having a Bank Alt with level 1 Enchanting.
---
HAHAHA!!!  What the hell even is this comically presumptuous tirade!?
---
Put a sock in it, Freud.
---
the amount of passion put into this single low level duel is beautiful
---
I see the Blizzard boycott is going well...
---
1) haven't found a decent one yet
---
2) higher rank rebirth. You're bringing them back in combat which if they died is probably a pretty hectic situation so the group is gonna need them to have as much hp as possible to not immediately die again and to have the mana to actually do something.
---
3) not on pre pull as it slows you attack speed and will reduce how much threat you can generate off the pull when you are most likely to have aggro stolen off you anyways.
---
itt: People upset they didnt get mad upvotes for farming 100g
---
Prefer to keep my options open, thanks.
---
Someone call the Ironforge police on this dwarf
---
Did BRD with one the other day. Was doing very good damage and gave us all 3% Crit!
---
I think just adding a barber to the game would be fine. Adding hair stylist as a profession is stupid lol
---
To be fair, I'm just speaking from my own point of view - Im a herb and Engi. I charge a fee for crafts that are rare or if my mats are used are extremely hard to grab in large quantities - 8 Dark Iron bars from pugs for example. 
---
I think offering free enchants instead of being part of a set fee means your asking for drama. Responding to being asked to be reasonable from a business point of view then responding with I like to give back. Your just creating drama and don't like being told what to do. So if they manipulate the game mechanics to quiet you down I respect that. If you were my herb comp I would camp you for hours as I have many others so they know the zone is mine for picking not theirs.
---
Thats my sense. At least they offered you a chance to sit at the table.
---
Dude... gamechanger. Thanks for this.
---
Earthshaker is my main server now, I transfered. It's a great and balanced server. I'd recommend it.
---
I wasn't aware of its final fate.
---
It's worth noting that at the time, blizzard specifically said they were interfering with that mechanic to hurt mods like LFG. Just because something's not against the written rules doesn't mean it isn't against the spirit of the game.
---
That said, I don't know how the current addon works so I can't comment on that functionality.
---
Sorry you got downvoted. I miss transmog too. T_T
---
North STV is where I’d go. If you’re on a high pop server I’d aim to go at off peak times. Even if you don’t get tanked constantly there will be a lot of competition from same faction players as well at peak times.
---
My cat’s a barely tapped gold mine.
---
Asked previously but didn't get an answer. What is a good combat text add-on where I can give my sword spec procs another color? Other customization would also be very nice to have.
---
Kill the giblin boss too, he is on the way and easy to kill, i can clear both in around 10 mins, when you include swapping to am alt for resets you dont even need to worry about the instance cap
---
Yea boomkins do decent damage, it's just that they don't have in combat mana regen abilities (besides innervate), unlike mages and warlocks, so fights like raids that last long they probably aren't close to being efficient.
---
Is that a follow up to my comment about pickpocketing on Rp servers?
---
More like nightelf priest and clickers
---
The level of oversight required to enforce that, and the generally mall segment of the roleplay community who want that, sadly make that unlikely in big commercialized games :/
---
Smart business opportunity, goblin.
---
I dropped mining due to mining bots and people just in general exploiting the layers, i mean warden might be a thing but it doesn't mean the good ol programs that worked with vanilla back then wouldn't work now, such as the old times of mmoglider and what have you.
---
Can a priest pre bubble?
---
If there letting shamans put 4 totems down! I don’t see why not. How about hunter traps?
---
&gt; once you drop form to perform other tasks your dps drops and you get questioned to why??
---
I have yet to be in a group where people commented on DPS.
---
Faerlina Horde at least just doesn't care about it.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Hunter is fun too
---
I heard that goes hand in hand.
---
Can someone post mobile-friendly rules?
---
If your guild requires you to bring anything other than healing pots, mana pots, and fire resist potions then they are scrubs.
---
I cleared MC this week in 2 hours with no consumables other than fire resist as the **Main Tank** and we had 7 players out of 40 who were under level 60 and running in blues and greens.
---
If you need more than that your either taking this game way too seriously or you make so many bad decisions that these potions are required because your players are complete and utter trash.
---
Neither guild is one you want to be a part of.
---
Can you do my kids birthday next week? I don't want anyone having too much fun.
---
I leveled about 4 characters in legion and never saw this happen at the lower levels.
---
I dont see why that even matters.   With as much shit that goes through chat.  Even without that, it shouldn't matter.  No one can reasonably argue that everyone else just didn't want gold.
---
This has nothing to do with this subreddit or reddit in general. People just seem to feel the need to share everything they do.
---
Wow, you sound like a complete tool.
---
Rogue definitely covers good WPvP and fun to play. Problem is too many people know that and finding dungeon slots in pub groups is a challenge.
---
That said I'm playing shaman because they are both a healer for easy to find/not brainless pve while also being strong dps in Wpvp/duels/Battlegrounds
---
Yeah this isn’t even one of the better posts. We gotta keep reminding people as China tries to drown out our voices.
---
There are two spots for them, I do agree that the one on the top of map is camped 24/7 but the one i marked is mostly free.
---
All the time, probably 1/4-1/3 of pulls in my experience are a single mob
---
Well OP clearly made this post to advertise that he has a gf, and totally gets laid, you clueless kid.
---
He's quite pathetic. Poor girl, I'm sure she absolutely loves having this flattering angle being posted on reddit for some validation point.
---
Has no one told the rogue that a dwarf named Thief Catcher Thunderbrew roams Ironforge? I always wondered if that NPC had much work.
---
more than a decade ago i played WoW when i was a kid living with my parents with zero responsibilities (me, not my parents) . Now I live with my GF and have a shitload of work and chores and this post just takes me way back.
---
Yeah, it got a lot of attention early on when the dev was building auto grouping functions into it in a beta state that I too felt went too far. It even had a blue post about it at the time before things got rolled back.
---
That feature was axed and its basically just a specialized chat parsing system the displays in a separate window who is LFG with view options for different dungeons so you dont have to have different dedicated chat windows and scroll nonstop through the messages that dont apply to your search for say Mara or ST when there are a million messages spamming LG Tank LBRS or whatever.
---
Oh right I forgot, 0.4 hasn't been technically confirmed but it's been tested enough that it's known to be longer than 0.2
---
I really doubt that. My guild doesn't even look at people's spec and we cleared MC.
---
It's only if they talked about how they'd roll beforehand. If no one said a word and he rolled need he isn't a ninja. Everyone should've rolled need. Idiots for not.
---
They are BIS till dire maul.  Then you want the barb blade
---
You kick the person that rolled need.
---
That solution is good for Shamans, druids and Hunters who have movement speed boosters (i.e. forms, Aspect and ghost form for shamans) but for everyone else it's much better to buy the mount stright away at 40..
---
And yet I'm not the one who needs to insult people.
---
Literally faster to google it. I didn't know, but i do now
---
Look at the picture, it says 415 victories.
---
Yup happened once on pservers, it was weird but wholesome
---
If you're into ARPGs like Diablo 2 it's pretty fun. A steep learning curve on how everything scales though.
---
I mean, wouldn't you just send your pet to attack the rogue while he sapped you so he can't restealth?
---
Thank you for this. Goddamnit
---
I've been leveling a priest and mainly healing in dungeons, I got up to 48 and then made a mage alt (currently level 29) and it's changed my life. For every hybrid spec that gets half healing spells and half damage spells, the mage gets a ton of awesome damage spells that are fun and situational. Every group just knows what's up when I join, no questions easy to find a group as a DPS. There are spells to control most pvp situations too. I know my mage isn't high enough to see much world pvp yet, but with slows and blinks you can always reset an opener and start a fight on your own terms. Make sure you get some wands early on, they help a ton for those early levels.
---
I think this right here sums up a lot of internet users and video gamers in this era.
---
This on Kromcrush?
---
&gt; this subreddit is a great reflection of the accepting, friendly, and fun community that WoW Classic has brought out!
---
Ah yes so accepting, as long as everyone follows some weird rules of 'having fun the right way as classic was designed' according to this sub. God forbid someone does AoE cleaves, clears content fast or actually tries to minmax.
---
I play on Ashbringer, durning those days as I said, I've never seen anyone camping down there where I marked it. And I farmed durning day, wasnt even off hours
---
This is why you bring a shadowpriest. It's not for the damage or the Warlock buff, it's so your other priests don't get any ideas.
---
There’s a reason I’m lvl 56 and the Crossroads is still my hearth location.
---
Isn't this like super known spot now? I'm on Ally so idk
---
If I put Shadow Oil on my weapon, will my +spell power gear increase the shadow bolt proc damage?
---
I still rather have more geared healers.
---
Once our healers are geared, we can cut out consumables and save money. Plus, people still die on fights which hurts DPS a lot.
---
Not saying you’re bad dude. Everyone plays at their own level. I’m just pointing out facts tho. Imagine if you strafe turned and used all your key binds? Would have shat on that dude hard and fast lol
---
What's funny about it? This is a legitimate question.
---
How in heaven did you manage to get 700 gold at such a low level man... what's your /played?
---
&gt; Too cheap to buy arcane signets for the 60min buff
---
Do you mean arcane powder?
---
Gehennas, the most players
---
It annoys me you HS and mount aren't in the top left corner of your bags
---
Cant d/e dungeon bop blues on a bank alt.
---
1. Whichever you have the most fun with. 
---
2. Druid. You can tank or heal. You will almost always find raid spots because there are so few druids and no one wants to shard all the gear that drops. You can stealth for questing. You can skip your level 40 mount if you want because travel form. You have seal form in the water. You have easy roles in any group.
---
I've heard that Silithus has no quests ATM.  I could be wrong, as I havent been there myself
---
weirdest rules
---
Indeed it was useful ! I have went deep in data normalization using JSON with MySQL and new operators to extract data, so now having Relational and Non Relational database is something that will be adding to a Tool that I have for open source and can be used in  [https://github.com/mortalys/PandIX](https://github.com/mortalys/PandIX)   
---
So if someone want to know which language or tech stack, it was all made with that PandIX :)
---
Yep pretty much how I see it too. They used to be so damn great. Vanilla WoW, W3, D2 were all absolute masterpieces. Now From Software and CD Projekt Red is what Blizzard used to be.
---
So, 5 minutes of farming to keep Juju Ember up for the entire raid, and about 10 minutes to enchant your shoulders.
---
What there's to discuss? Of course that's worth it.
---
Yep, and what some people on this post dont understand is that's the literal definition of attention seeking. They are letting the world know they are thanking someone.
---
still managed to kill some low lvls in crossroads
---
The problem is there's a point where your autos can no longer crit despite getting extra crit chance. At that point, hit becomes useful, because it's the only way to increase the number of white autos you can get. 
---
But your autos, despite being the largest single portion of your damage, aren't more than half. But your autos are also how you get rage, so increased auto crits means more rage to fuel your yellows, which are the higher portion of your dps.
---
By contrast, Rogues only have to worry about it because their autos are the largest portion of their dps. Their damage scales linearly, though, because energy regeneration is constant. That's different from Warriors, whose yellow damage is directly influenced by the rage generation from their autos, which is increased by hit and crit.
---
What ever level the devilsaur is times 5

Pre-trapping is banned - VII. points E and F:
---
1. Dropping a flare at a Hunter’s feet before a duel begins is not permitted.
---
2. Hunters pre-trapping (placing a trap before a duel begins) is not permitted.
---
If I bring guildies with me specifically to farm one item because we already have all the other items we need and only need to fill one slot, then sorry we are gonna reserve the shit we need.
---
If I'm running UBRS with 7 guildies, 3 puggers, and I'm the only one with the key to UBRS I'm gonna reserve the shit we need.
---
If I'm running Stratholme I literally dont need anything from their except the material drops. I'm gonna put those on reserve, or I'm gonna go somewhere else and farm gold rather than do any dungeons because I have no reason to lock myself into an hour long dungeon to get rolls on loot I do not need.
---
My time is valuable. I'm going to inform you in my recruitment message what is on res.
---
You can decide if the things you need are going to be available to you and join or ignore my group at your discretion.
---
I'm not running Strat out of the goodness of my heart so some level 58 can get levels or gear. I have a specific goal and if that specific goal is not going to be achieved I'm gonna go *somewhere else that actually benefits me.*
---
How is spending 15 minutes to not be a dick not worth it?

Is the value increase going to be significant, because selling it now would be more beneficial to me but if it's going to be a couple hundred extra gold I'd hold onto it.
---
It's not that "I feel like it". It's much better to spend some time farming gold and be able to afford the mount at 40, than leveling and walking up to let's say lvl 43-45 before you can get one.  
---
Also I said 3 days beause that's how many days I spent to grind those mobs, I didnt play more than 4 hours a day to get it done. I got lucky with greens tho.
---
You'd make far more money with a gathering profession if that's your concern. Taking Enchanting solely to disenchant stuff is a massive waste on a main character.

Quick question: I downloaden auctioneer via the Twitch app and then again via the website, and the Game always says my version is old and cant load (in the addon selection screen). How can I fix this? I didnt find anything helpful. Thank you
---
Many allows customization of triggers. Colors, font and sound iirc.
---
I would 100% trade world buffs for 10g every raid

Watch Tips' most recent vod to see the explanations of the entire rule set. All of the choices are mostly about balance, for example Rogues would be absolutely broken if Thistle Tea was allowed, etc.

Yes I am. Not denying that.
---
When you get to a higher level and starting to feel a bit of burn out from leveling, go gank some lowbies in STV, Redridge, Hillsbrad, Stonetalon, the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay, etc. It's fun, you'll love it.

Hello I was wondering how many hours does it take for me to get to level 20 from level 10?
---
No one gives a shit what you *look* like. You can always open the item to /roll if you aren't a ninja. Don't expect anyone else to do the same, though.
---
What's the minimum level you could sell a ring run to? Say, a 46 warrior?
---
Do you know if the buyer is able to finish the "kill princess" quest as well in a ring run?
---
I mean, the opposing faction camps BRM and makes it so I have to corpse run 2-3 times before entering BRS or BRD. This is the same caliber as that. I'm not going to *not* take opportunities to grief, because it happens to me every single time. The only choice is to return the favor. Welcome to World of Warcraft.

If you want to shit on everyone PvP wise go rogue if you want to be a support/utility play shaman. I had just as many shamans as rogues in my MC last night so I wouldn’t go off desire or filled slots.

He needed the gold and so did you, obviously. You pressed the wrong button...

Yea, warriors usually get crushed by frost mages. Not sure about other specs
---
Well I'm nowhere near my epic mount and selling it with probably put me within 100-200g of it. I was thinking more along the lines of using it to get BiS gear, such as Lionheart Helm etc. Would you not recommend that?
---
And the epic mount will make me profit because of what? The increased move speed?
---
And that's without even considering that all normal pots are banned meaning warriors have zero reason to not use rage pot, meanwhile you can use whipper which means rogue would have a choice between tea and whipper. 
---
Owell I honestly didn't care about this tournament before, and I certainly don't now.

Manufactured and distributed by Zug &amp; Zug

Every crafting profession has to invest money that way. You almost always lose money leveling them.
---
MFW I'm Alch/Herb.
---
From the perspective of a DPS I found that unless it was a good group, guild group or whatever, it was worth more XP to just grind out quests,
---
The time spent getting a group together, getting to the dungeon and maybe wiping a few times isn't as good as the time/XP you can get just from grinding quests.
---
This may change if you're leveling as a critical role as a Tank/Healer, groups are typically made for you rather than the other way around.
---
No Fellstriker, no perfect loot.
---
Heard of what?
---
As a 50 mage whose been doing zf all week in a group.
---
He absolutely cannot solo the zombies.
---
Wasnt most of the layoffs from marketing?
---
Yeah I hate when people ask for something that takes zero effort and also say please. You dont sound petty or bitter at all.
---
More like, when there's a hunter in the group but everybody blames the mage with his magic wand.
---
Well no shit. And dungeons don't do much for you if you've outleveled them too..
---
Nah get that fucker banned and then sip your martini on victory.
---
DM will add but for a dps warrior there's attack speed (rend), ap+crit (ony), and all stats+crit (flower).
---
Yay?
---
I'm on pve, so I'm optimistic that alt season will be coming up soon.
---
I'm going to be so fucked.
---
Please enlighten me because what you said sounds pretty stupid.  Seems like you're advocating against a multicultural and diverse society.
---
Ah yes, the warrior hosting the tournament decides that rogues should be punished and warriors buffed.
---
Looking like a great cringe tournament like the others all ready.
---
Yea as a person who just finished those last levels and didn’t give up. I hate grouping with people who think it’s normal for me and a few other 60s/58s  to carry you through a dungeon..
---
My advise is find a group your level range and see what dungeons you can actually do.... not effective or as fast as you thought? Well you weren’t getting carried that’s why...
---
Stands by sitting at a keyboard.
---
For druids yes. 1 Str = 2 AP while in form, which translates to chance to hit.

Nifty stopwatch and the boomerang.  How else am I going to pull a second group then make it out of the dungeon before everyone else wipes?
---
Haha xd epic dank meme xd
---
IMO you should still save for mount. Even a small movespeed boost (I'm not sure what travel form is, is it 30%?) will save you a lot of time, and this time will add up the longer you have mount
---
I hear about these incredulous attempt counts in my guild all the time and there are only few I know are telling the truth. I was there when a guildie had Dal’Rend’s Charge drop after 215 runs; pure elation and dude actually cried. Bit much but was nonetheless happy for him.  
---
I know there are some addons out there which do these counts but even that can be gamed.  I still don’t know if they’re trying to evoke pity but it’s definitely gotten old.
---
 It's not false, it's just a really, really stupid way of thinking. 
---
 The difference is that both those lvl 60s have the same goal in mind: get better gear. One might have more gear than the other at one point, but they are still striving towards the same objective. 
---
 But a regular lvl 19 and a twink have 2 very different goals. A twink wants to stay on that level, get BiS gear, so that he can easily prey on regular, badly geared players, who just want to get to lvl 20 and beyond.
---
 I still remember a few months back, how twinks on retail lost their minds when Blizzard decided to put them in their own battlegrounds, separate from regular players.
---
u/poupal rekt
---
What are we getting on the 15th? Is it just DM or will it be honorable kills/PvP rankings as well?
---
It’s actually extremely popular/ and annoying for people to give up on leveling at 52 and expect a group of 4 people to carry/help them the rest of the way... typical for mages for some reason witch is the real mystery. Since there the fastest to level.
---
Yes! I watched a video that explained to me the best way to move and to keybind your abilities, already changed everything! Now time to get used to it and keep kicking rogues butts :p

What's the best way to create a bis list? Resto Shaman

Farm humanoids and pickpocket before killing. Farm animals and skin. I know that sounds trite but the best places to make money are the places you can enjoy. Explore the world and find those places. :)

All of them. Warrior leveling is bullshit.

"My crippled blind 98yo girlfriends grandmother just created her first character in wow EVER! I'm so proud of her!"
---
aw I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it. I shared it because I thought he made a lot of great points about classic vs retail and there various strengths and weaknesses. I really like how he put wow as a game into context and thought critically about classic as a game set firmly in its time. I really like folding idea's channel and definitely would sum him up as click bait. He's one of the best media analysts on youtube. I get that his work is closer to something you'd see in the communications department of a university than your average wow youtuber but I guess thats just what I like.
---
No. I'm saying she is pregnant. Not him
---
Wow people still fall for this. I got gkicked in BC for this. Tried telling everyone its impossible but to no avail
---
I asked, he didnt answer. Just looking for trouble.
---
You're right, I misremembered. Rightclick autoshot came a lot later.
---
Masons.
---
I'll put in better terms to compare:
---
Masons is +26 AP and  around 0.25% crit vs  1% crit
---
1% crit is worth 32 AP. Now, it changes with spec and other shit but in most cases before raid gear, that's true.
---
So you have 34 ap vs 32 ap. 
---
But! Agi can scale up with buffs in a raid(kings, etc.) Not your crit. So Masons is slightly better and has potential to be even better.
---
Go for Masons. :)
---
It'd probably bet best to sell the axe and roll with the sword. + Weapon skill is too good to pass up
---
Ahh EVE....many, many years ago me and a few local (Aus) buddies were in a small corp of UK dudes from Eurogamer, lived out of a WH for a while. One of our corpmates was an IT manager or something like that, apparently he had nobody to answer to re: computer use at work, so he was nearly always online working the market. He claimed to be running 7 accounts, and hadn't paid actual money for them in a very long time. I only witnessed about 3 of those characters, the others he kept secret.
---
When we moved into our WH I'm pretty sure he bankrolled it for his own ends, because the facilities always seemed far better than what a corp of 10-15 active players should be able to afford. We very rarely actually met up with him in-game, he was just always...there. My mates &amp; I had our suspicions that one of his secret characters was actually the CEO, who also allegedly had secret characters.
---
Great game. 95% of the time nothing is happening, but when that 5% happens, jesus christ.
---
About double of what it took to go 1-10.
---
Well if you start looking at raid partings and only check on the Druid as a dps it looks like your slacking.  (Until you check healing etc).  
---
Some melee dps meathead told me I wasn’t contributing enough back then. 
---
I know many guilds have a more sane /laid back approach and I wouldn’t look at anything hardcore today.   
---
I even knew a fellow Druid who was gkicked for buying a shadow craft bracers of AH with the reason a rogue could use it better.  Some tryharda back then was not very nice to ferals.  
---
(Back in 2006-2007)
---
Ok, here goes my recent life, BLOOD AND THUNDER!
---
Now, he is a legend.
---
You sound like a really angry dude. Please calm down. My mighty knowledge is simple maths.
---
No thanks I prefer winning
---
It’s because people are lonely and have nobody else to share their video game achievements with. Getting their achievements didn’t fill themselves with the expected feelings, so they reach out to strangers to try and make themselves feel better.
---
I hate the way that hat looks. It’s got dope stats but it’s fucking atrocious to look at
---
Lmao you're the type of person to Google something and not think about it. It's only prebis with Phase 3 agi enchants, till then a warrior or rogue should have prio and Hunter should not roll
---
While we are at it, can we cut down on the fucking animal posts? I don't give a shit if your stupid-ass cat or dog watches you play WoW. That isn't content.
---
Around 150-160 fire resist Ragnaros can NOT kick you away as a tank.
---
Tanks are the only people who need fire res in MC and only really at ragnaros so dps can tunnel him so you can skip the phase with adds. The rest is completely ignorable by useing fire protec potions or simply let the healers heal through it.
---
Do not farm any consumables for MC ever if you are not a maintank. Its not worth one copper. Bosses are freeloot. Leave guilds who demand it, its a nice noob filter.
---
Mc is literally clearable by 30 people without any worldbuffs or consumables with ease.
---
Masons. The +26 ranged attack power from the 13 agi will be better overall for damage than the 1%. Plus you still get some crit off that 13 agi.
---
Also congrats on the blackstone  ring!
---
Enchanting. 
---
Im lv 30 mage with lv 150 enchanting. In the beginning levels, green items would give me enough of the green dust to level up my enchanting. Now, I'm getting more of these orange and blue essence things rather than the green dust. What should i be doing to get more green dust?
---
&gt;Stealth Classes will always get the uncontested opener in a duel
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg
---
No, you'd pp each mob then use the macro on the last one
---
Yes, he can keep that recipe. 
---
He basically pressed "need" on a good amount of money, and everyone else had an equal chance and opportunity to do the same thing. But they willingfully turned it down. I am really sorry if it's a big news for someone that if you press "greed" then you don't mind **not** receiving the item you rolled on since you GREED and not NEED it, and that you lose any priority against "need" rolls.
---
It's mostly about not buying the overpriced blues. Upgrading a green that's 10-15 levels out of date for 35s is no biggie.
---
Aight ima head out
---
Fuck blizzard
---
Qq more neck beards
---
That cockroach is going to get it.
---
Not until phase 3 and any hunter who takes these over a rogue or a warrior is a massive dick.
---
Spell cleave doesn't get the hate it deserves. If you ask exclusively for mages then go fuck yourself
---
What are you farming here?
---
What faction should you grind rep with as a tank warrior with engineering/mining? I am only lv 47 so far but was thinking to look up some places if I am going to grind a few lvls and get rep meanwhile. 
---
Are there any nice rewards for being exalted with some factions that might be favorable for a warrior?
---
Mage if you enjoy aoe and helping out with sheeping here and there. Overall a very simple class to play in dungeons.   
---
   
---
Warlock if you prefer using more spells, unlimited mana (life tap) and summoning. Easy but a bit more to do than for mages.   
---
Rogue or Warrior if you want to be upclose and switch between a few attacks to deal high damage.   
---
I’d say go warlock if you want to be pretty much garanteed to raid since it’s the least popular class I’ve meantioned and can get a guild quite easily.
---
I expected a lvl 60 to come gank you guys in the end, iam dissapointed
---
Why? I get that pictures are easier/quicker to process than more thought out discussion, and that upvoted posts aren't always relevant to the sub they're posted in. But to say something being upvoted doesn't mean that people appreciate it... well then who's upvoting it?
---
Considering someone rolled greed means this rule was never stated at the start. So it doesn’t exist for this run making people rolling need ninja looter.
---
Overall shows the total damage that has been recorded since the last time details was reset. If thats been a long time, like the end of a dungeon where its been running the whole time, each individual fights damage wont make that big of a difference. If it’s not changing at all, then details is probably just broken, make sure you update. Im pretty sure my overall will change in real time, but admittedly i only look at the current segment so i could be wrong.
---
I be reppin' de Grobb as well mon!
---
I’m pretty sure uncontested stealth openers is pretty normal at that level of dueling. You wouldn’t want a rogue/druid just prancing around for 5–10 minutes waiting for the opening he’s eventually going to get regardless.
---
As a matter of fact, these costs will only go down once we get the pvp rank 2 10% vendor discount
---
Righto. Cheers

You can two man every endgame dungeon in preraid bis and mc weapons. Just takes time.
---
Yeah im not arguing for things like 30sp and crusader to be free. I understand the value and rarity of these things, But their exclusivity is getting weaker everyday and the jusification for extreme fees with it.
---
10-15g tip on crusader is the sweetspot to me. The enchanter makes a nice tip, customer isnt getting wrecked on a fee. 
---
I just tend to seek the more flexible people and give them my repeat business. I even overtip once we build a rapport. 
---
Its just a way better approach than 30g or nothing. Good way to lose customers imo.
---
Thank you !
---
Look up a drain tanking guide. You can hit at least 35k solo grinding mobs even without quests at that level as a warlock.
---
At first I was going to break this down by most likely class to lead to most likely race to lead to most likely faction. But then I remembered most peoples' assumption of "Horde = bad guys Alliance = good guys" and his insistence that he's always in the right. So I'd say he'd play Alliance.
---
You’re entitled to need on whatever is an upgrade but if it’s a small upgrade you could greed if you have other who really need it. Higher level dungeons have defined caster and meele daggers so it’s easier then.
---
Look at the stats. If its agile or str, you won't need it.
---
Wait so which would you recommend for fastest leveling? FS &gt; Furor &gt; sharpened claws and predatory strikes?
---
So feline swiftness first, then furor, then skip blood frenzy and go deeper into feral right? And I don't need resto?
---
Are you logging off while inside a inn or  faction city
---
Laughs in Ratchet to Astranaar
---
This is awesome.
---
You think I don't already do that? I have waited an hour and people don't join for a single BRD arena/golem. People these days seriously think if you aren't doing the best damage you aren't playing the game. It's funny because DPS sims show few classes are as overpowered as warrior. In other words, mage DPS is negligible and won't do more damage compared to random Joe DPS.
---
Just have a friend reset the dungeon for you while you’re logged out.... you’ll spawn at the beginning of a fresh instance.
---
I have seen multiple boomkin. I have never even seen a warden staff for sale.
---
&gt; But it adds nothing, go to Instagram or something. 
---
Just looked through your posting history.....you criticizing anyone on reddit for adding "nothing" is as hypocritical as it gets.  All you do it crap on people and complain about things while dropping profanity where it is unneeded.  Haters gonna hate I guess.
---
I mean, its very commonly known in the pvp community that Warriors are the worst duel class in the game.
---
That being said, the rules do indeed take into account class balance, nerfing classes like Warlock and Rogue so the other classes at least have a chance at winning some duels.
---
What day and time does Ony and MC reset? Also lets say you run an MC pug one day and you guys wipe at 7/10 and everyone leaves the raid. And the next day my guild wants to do a fresh MC run, can I still run with them or can will it not let me in?
---
Say a dagger has spirit and stam I would obviously need those stats but those stats are good on rogues too aren't they?
---
Is everyone flagged PvP automatically on PvP servers?
---
Not many
---
Get fucked
---
I've found the entire rogue gameplay buggy. Energy ticks are unreliable to line up before the first opener, gouge makes the NPCs get a swing in, people turn around when stunned, swing timers are off, the abilities seem laggy compared to private servers, the weird artificial lag makes it impossible to bleed kite warriors effectively like private servers.
---
I know, I know, "this isn't a private server."... yeah, I know, but you'd think Classic WoW would run better than a mangos emulator. I feel like they'll never fix any of these issues either, they sit back and fix dumb stuff like infernals aggroing people out of combat when summoned but won't fix this.
---
Dunno man, I'm liking it. Thing is, I never had the chance to experience Vanilla back in the day, sharing it with this community makes me feel warm inside. I get the chance of being a part of something special, to say "Hey, I was there when they did that." It feels cool sharing the moment. Sure something ordinary like reaching lvl 40 and getting your first mount isn't something major, but if say, I saw Blue Child (which I shared with this sub) for the first time, I'd wanna post it.
---
Put that bad boy in neut ah. An orc warrior will give you a small fortune for it
---
Second person on reddit today that has claimed it takes hour+ to get a run going lol. I don’t believe it takes that long to get a group especially seeing how everyone and their mothers are doing BRD, Strath and Scholo.
---
My wife and I play together and we are expecting in January, is it weird if this is goals? LOL.
---
I just started a night elf warrior and I can't figure out where to train so I can us 2H weapons. Can someone let me know please?
---
drop names, who's getting everything and who are you? i'm on faerlina and want to know who to avoid.
---
Lol right? When he first gets back to his character's POV the ship is a ghost town.
---
Has nothing to do with the persons level.
---
There are just more low levels than higher levels.
---
And a lot of people are just pieces of shit.
---
Stam maybe, but not a good Rogue dagger in this case
---
Isn’t there a dagger in BWL off chromagmus that’s has spell damage and would be perfect for a lock.
---
Every day some guy hits level 40 or some other guy brags about getting their mount 3-5 levels late.
---
Besides the SM dagger, the SM quest for alliance gives a 1h sword with stam on it. Decent for a warlock I'd guess.
---
Swords in Stormwind, Axes and Maces in Ironforge
---
Wouldn't work.
---
/cast [@Mugenyama] Devour Magic
---
I'm pretty sure?
---
Join a guild or get friends?
---
The issue I see, is where if the creature you are mind controlling dies...the other mobs will still come after you. On the private server videos I've seen, after your mind controlled mob dies...the other mobs reset and you aren't in combat anymore. Is that correct?
---

"If you can survive the stunlock"

If the rogue is skilled enough, you would never survive the stunlock.

Would also be nice to cut down on the chat screenshots which are becoming like every other post on here.

Don't let these idiots shame you for playing the class you wanted to.
---
Does he though with Detect invisibility and maybe paranoia (yeah, dueling a rogue with Felhunter bla bla bla...). I could understand this though... but what's up with Healthstones? Managems to prolong Mana shield are OK, but Healthstones aren't?
---
Gotta say I am strangely upset for someone not attending :D
---
The fact they need to draw attention to themselves jacking off is the definition of self absorption if you want to call it something else that's fine, but it won't change what it actually is.
---
Iirc from years ago:
---
If you are raid leader everyone will join a 7/10 MC. If you are not raid leader when you zone in you will be in the 7/10 MC while everyone else will be in a fresh one. If the people you pugged with are running MC and you join in you will see them.
---
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong

Reset is sometime on Tuesday

What an awful ruleset
---
Do you think it's worth running BRD 100 times? Genuine question, I saw a guy on a private server trying *that* hard to get it.
---
...if threat is less of an issue then you’re not going to die, right?  You did see the part where I explicitly talk about how there are ways you can avoid dying, right?  The parenthesis don’t mean “don’t read this.”
---
It's a super bad ruleset
---
maybe also add cast Find Herbs
---
Does it even break mind control ? ;)
---
Barber lul
---
Bruh come on that's your argument? I can make the same one to you :/
---
Gotcha gotcha. There’s also the aspect of more damage output for these dungeons - is it just not enough to make it worth it really?
---
As a dagger rogue, the lack of Felstriker tarnishes "perfect" :(
---
I like to use @ instead of target but same thing
---
Dungeons can be better assuming you have a fixed group to run them over and over and you all know what you're doing.
---
They are not better if you have wait 20 minutes to get a group and get everyone to the dungeon every run and then wipe a few times.
---
Ultimately if you're questing in a zone near a dungeon then look for group and run it as you can.
---
He's definitely soloable, I'm combat swords and just pop all my CDs. Only work if he's spawned in the corner on the right though, you can basically sneak behind him all the way in the corner and unstealth to aggro without pulling any other packs. I haven't gotten the pattern yet but he drops a blue weap worth about 5g or some other blue items worth 1-2g. 
---
I wanna try soloing the quartermaster guy next, not sure if I'd be able to though, think he hits harder.
---
If people start making posts everyday about buying common skills, and those posts start getting highly upvoted, then and only then might you have made some semblance of a valid point

I spent several hours making a wow classic version of key and Peele handshake gif, and it got taken down with hundreds of upvotes, now I see shit that's way worse every day.
---
Detect invisibility does nothing for stealth, it’s only for people with invisibility potions or that invisible eye job in strath
---
We started on golemagg but switched on day two when there were 10 hour queues. We moved to ashbringer and it’s very populated but I’ve not had to queue for more than 20 mins, and that’s only at absolute peak times. Not really encountered any mega dicks or toxic guilds so far as alliance.
---
Just make friends, duh. I didn't realize it was that easy, thanks!
---
Let me help you up there, bud.
---
Too real, friend.
---
i cbf leveling my warrior anymore should i switch to hunter warlock or mage? how viable are each of those in raids and pvp
---
It's going to fuck you up even more when you realize a lot of Chinese products stop by other countries to get their "Made in Malaysia" or other countries tag before they come to the US.
---
Sorry, I gotta go my pool is on fire again.
---
Thank you.
---
I shall now shut my ass up and keep leveling.
---
This whole post is fucking hilarious.
---
Would seriously just prefer a regular barber. Too much thinking
---
My condolences
---
Those quests where mobs only come in groups of 3 or 4 mobs. One quest in feralas comes to mind where the mobs you need to kill are usually surrounded by 4 other mobs.
---
When everyone is doing a spell cleave then yeah it really does take an hour. It's super cancerous thanks to that guy asmongloid which I know this site likes to suck his nuts.
---
Stfu about «toxicity» that fucking stupid word gets spewed out for everything.
---
Zigris? Two of my rogue friends tried getting him but couldn't, we're all fairly geared as all 3 of us have Perdition's and other shit and it would still take all 3 of us to get him. It's not impossible with two but it is difficult enough that I wouldn't bother trying

That was actually what I was trying to remember! I fixed mine

I can’t comment on the other things, I don’t really know how many people they talked to or what research went in to decide what is banned and what isn’t, I only know that in regards to stealth openers in duels from what I’ve seen on streams watched. Most duels include a courtesy opener at this level of play.

I love how peoples idea of "fun" is griefing other players. (aka ruining someone else's time)

You'll get honored without a problem. I did. Gnome mage.

Hell yeah brother.
---
Not true. Ideal packs are 1-2 levels above you. Go'shek farm is ideal to start at level 32. Depending on where you're specced.
---
Definitely beats being a prot pally outside of a dungeon that's for sure
---
I'm playing a Dune character as well :)

No you can't, because theirs literally no correlation you complete dumbass lol.

Amazingly done man, these have been great but this one takes the cake.

no way im hitting more than 1/5 melees against a 60 as my 19. Highest level I have been able to handle personally is 39

Yet you still came to comment...

What kind of content do you want to be posted then? Cuz this is typical reddit stuff

.....
---
Actionfigure needs to get his sh*t together with these weak rolls
---
It’s highly dependent on server pop, faction, and what time you play. Low pop server at 9.30 am isn’t exactly gonna have people dying to run brd.
---
I think you’re missing the point entirely.
---
Thistle tea banned shit tournament
---
Ik had het over de die 😅
---
Seeing a warrior leveling is like watching a special needs child play sports. They aren't quite as good at it as everyone else, but you admire their determination.
---
As you level enchanting you should need soul dust (grey) and the essences instead of the green dust. Which you get from higher level green items. If you really need more green dust then you should farm low lvl green items or buy on ah.
---
Also general enchanting hint, if you haven't get an addon like tsm or auctioneer that displays you vendor price and expected enchantment value and only disenchant if it's worth it.
---
engi
---
I do yes
---
Because like someone else said earlier, you'll just have duels be boring as fuck while a rogue or druid just chills out and waits for an opening.
---
Rogue is one of the worst dueling classes too. They only classes they beat are warriors, hunters and shamans
---
People don't post about their birthdays and weddings on the internet?
---
What weird alternative reality were facebook doesn't exist, do you live in?
---
They’re at least 3 tall.
---
Thats... absurdly wrong.
---
its more efficient to just buy mats off AH, 1-260 engi costs about 50g on most servers. thats 2 hours max of gold farming, where as gathering the mats with mining will take many hours.
---
Fair
---
Server tick is something you'll hear about in any client-server setup for a game.
---
People,have had 15 years to learn this, you think a reddit post is gonna be the thing that finally gets through to them?
---
People are selling runs?
---
Wtf, havent seen that one Mirage Raceway yet.

Well of course, because they love promoting and speaking about their support for LGBTQ. Anything that goes agaist their beliefs is "devisive"

I'm getting bored of the low effort constant spam of dog shit fucking meme's on this sub. At least let us filter this shit out.
---
No one cares. With my respects to Asmon, he’s a single person that plays video games for a living. Why do you feel someone like this opinion should matter more than your own?
---
How does it work? It shows up in my addon list. But I do not see any new information or any options or buttons for it.
---
Questions, meta discussion, experimental builds, funny memes, stories. Literally anything but a picture of you with your mount...
---
That's the norm in vanilla dueling
---
My favorite dungeons - nice work!
---
[Robes of the Exalted](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13346/robes-of-the-exalted) from Rivendare is better. More +healing and stats on top of it. You should run Strat UD until you get it, it's a high-priority item.
---
Yes just got it today. I was hyped to get first solid shield to get me ready for Deadmines but I'm too embarassed to run the dungeon with this parody of a shield.
---
I haven't seen a boomkin yet.

Hell, I have done multiple raids where we couldn't find a single druid. Just had to DE a bunch of Molten Core drops.

Put on some Paul Stanley and grind those two levels out in Winterspring
---
Didn't want to fuel the fire even further I assume. It was an obvious provocation and they didn't take the bait.
---
&gt; Rogue is one of the worst dueling classes too.
---
ahahahaha
---
no
---
Rogue is hands-down the best 1v1 class due to how many cooldowns they have. They're right up there with Mages/Warlocks as having a huge advantage in 1v1 situations.
---
Yup as long as no one actually needs it. I see people here advocating for all need even if someone needs it. Those people are gaping assholes imo. That's basically a ninja loot done as a group.
---
Are you guys trying to 10 man MC or something? Sheesh.
---
You're dreaming pal
---
Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise is a merciless quest for Warriors! Dangerous mobs everywhere, large treks to each object -- of which you need to collect 10! Many a Warrior has told me of the horrors they experienced trying to complete that quest. My sympathies for all Warriors past and present who have tried to do that quest *solo*...
---
Funny you're the inverse of me. My first 60 on classic is a warrior with epic mount, now I have a 53 frost mage. Tell me, are you finding the warrior to be more painful having tasted the easiest class in the game on your first trek to 60? Because for me doing warrior first mage second, this has been an absolute breeze.
---

Lol not quite, he skips over a lot because it's "obvious."

I think starting a huge drama was part of the intention. And it kinda worked, see how many people are voicing their support for HK?

Buy a ton of cheap mats and stuff and hope you get lucky

does it prompt you the price before you unlearn it?

Or he could just sort by “hot” or “top today” and he will quite literally filter out all of the shit posts
---
Hand Held -- Hmm. Well, lets compare this alllllll mighty peacemaker and the "Shitty" Dalrends for a hunter. 
---
Peacemaker: 56 AP, 1% crit
---
Dal Rends: 50 AP, 1% crit, 4 Strength, 7 defense, 100 armor.
---
So, you lose 6 AP for 4 Strength, 7 defense, and 100 armor. You guys are running around toting this like Peacemaker is CLEARLY better for hunters, when thats bullshit. Dal Rends is perfectly viable for a hunter, and I don't see why the hell a hunter with Green Weps wouldn't roll on Dal Rends. If you're over here like these other guys stating peacemaker is clearly better, then YOU are the one who can't analyze stats.
---
Maraudon farm already a lot more difficult for Hunter, DM could certainly be a problem given circumstances.
---
"n-no ur wrong"
---
Nice counterargument.
---
YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME FEEL FOR THESE RACIST GOONS
---
Open in browser if you're on mobile, doesn't work in the apps
---
Was mostly talking solo play leveling and dungeons etc. but I played rogue WotLK so sounds right to me
---
Yeah just compared them, peacemaker is at most marginally better. you gain 6 AP in trade for 4 strength, 7 defense, and 100 armor. Dal Rends are perfectly viable and if you like to pvp, I'd say dal rends is easily better than peacemaker.
---
There's nothing to counter you haven't made an argument. Rogues lose to mages locks priests paladins and druids. They beat warriors hunters and shamans.
---
My money is on an Ele Shaman if cds are reset each duel. All it takes is a few crits in the cheese combo to instantly drop someone

Oh!
---
When I'm tanking a group pull and my target dies, i find it very hard to start attacking the next mob. Either due to 
---
- other people in the way (I should be tab targetting right?)
---
- being rage starved so when the mob is targettted, I still can't attack it so i have to right-click it and then that's the prev. problem
---
(should I just have auto attack bound to something?
---
I think its the way they cook them alive
---
Stop. This is not politics. This is morality.
---
Whoa easy with the racism buddy /lick
---
Thank you! 
---
I guess getting "worked up" about people belittling another persons accomplishments is a bad thing... who would have known?
---
I'd kill for these to go up on the AH on fairbanks
---
How many fucking macros do you need?
---
Yes, a box will pop up saying something along the lines of "are you sure you want to pay the following price to unlearn all your talents" and it shows the price. Just make sure not to click "yes" unless you're sure.
---
More of this kind of content please
---
HOW
---
im lvl 41 with 52g and no mount
---
You can do it, I believe in you. Heart of the cards! Power of friendship!
---
Straight up one in a million chance
---
We paladins are extremely gullible, in his defense.
---
Sorry but you're wasting the healers mana. Pull adds off the healer and drag to the tank if anything.
---
I can’t think of it at the moment, but there’s a macro that prevents you from casting it while having a dead target. Google it and save yourself from ever wasting LoH again!
---
Does that make alliance racist too? specifically humans for rejecting the forsaken?
---
I care, you should stop mocking everyone in the comments. I get why you're annoyed with it, but for a lot of people this was the straw that broke the camels back, and people shouldn't shut up about it because thats exactly what Blizzard is hoping will happen.
---
here is an [Edding](https://www.staples.de/content/images/product/2025155_1_xnl.jpg) for you, for your editing.

Unsubscribe one tbh
---
Stop letting Blizzard frame this discussion this way. This is not a political opinion. This is a matter of ethics.
---
Until Blizzard issues a full apology and a condemnation of China's attack on basic human rights I will never play another Activision/Blizzard game in my life.

He's just here for the shit posts.

Does Classic have its own Moon Guard Goldshire Inn yet?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Come on get it right. 
---
It's Vietnam Vale
---
Or they brag that they're so casual, they're leveling 5 minutes a day and are proud to be 48 with no mount and no gold and how dare anyone speedlvl.
---
Yeah that's basically what I mean if anything get away or things get out of control and the tanks having trouble I'll help him get back in order and keep the healer safe been working so far
---
Eat my ass Blizzard
---
also, obviously, don't delete your war. You never know when you get the itch to play it.
---
also if it's lv. 35 or above it can max out it's profession so you can use it as a crafting atl
---
“We may only be good for 25 seconds, but baby it’ll be the best 25 seconds of your life”
---
You mean, BIS for hunTARDS, then yes. Normal hunters? No.
---
If you want to tab target I recommend creating a macro for your main spam move to initiate auto attack
---
For example
---
/Cast sunder armor
---
/Startattack
---
There was a bit of action yesterday.  A group of alliance raided Org on the less populated layer so a few people switched over and pushed them out.  Then in retaliation, 3-4 people went and started some trouble in Westfall until the Alliance mobilized a decent sized group to deal with that little situation. 
---
Was pretty fun seeing all that play out.
---
They haven't been beaten down by life enough yet to understand that they're not at all important to anyone but the people who love em; who's approval and adoration they reject. Ironic really.
---
Turn around and take the exit. We do not run ST, tis' a silly place.
---
We saw/heard them trying to skin it after doing the loot animation. Pretty sure they had looted it.
---
Exactly. Healer dies, Druid backup. Tank dies, Druid backup.
---
Who is Felicia?
---
Is this thread real, it's like bronze hour. Why would you ever Flamestrike+COC BEFORE Nova? Huge wasted damage, this is meme tier that you are upvoted.
---
“Wow! Spell batching is so great!”
---
-said literally nobody
---
You now.
---
No the literally didn't
---
We saw/heard them trying to skin it after doing the loot animation. Pretty sure they had looted it. I know how the mechanics are supposed to work.
---
Evil. I love it
---
I used to do this but the dps ignore them anyway.
---
I mean I definitely agree with the basis of his argument but it clearly states in his contract that he wasn’t allowed to do what he did. Blizz was well within their right to drop him for it. Unfortunately you dropping your sub does next to nothing to help the situation. Nice white knight attempt tho I’m sending you cookies
---
I use the ratio of 30 ap to 1% crit for equal dps. This will change with gear level though. Regardless, I agree masons is better.
---
I mean it's apples and oranges
---
Are you shitting me right now are these guys hating you for being nice ? FOR REAL ?
---
^^What ^^the ^^fuck.
---
In that context I was laughing at you. Lmao
---
You’re a tank, I’m assuming it was incredibly easy.
---
This whole thread feels like it's literally level 30 mages and mage haters talking about how to play mage, all the information is so bad in here...
---
do you use it? can i see a picture of your unit/loot frame? my chracacter doesnt look different sadly :(
---
Spam fear and mana drain casters since it doesnt break fear. Proceed to laugh and win.
---
Tab targetting should do the trick. Experience is important as things can get quite hectic in small areas. For the other problem you can use attack key (defaults to T), or use auto attack. But the most common one I have seen is macros. For example:
---
/attack
---
/cast heroic strike
---
This way even if you don't have the rage, your character will begin attacking so you wont just stand there staring at the mob.
---
Tons of quest mobs apply curses or diseases that significant slows attack speed. That gets really annoying.
---
My gf’s family is from Hong Kong and I’m still playing. Addiction knows no bounds.
---
Drop it, bud.
---
Why would barb blade change anything when there's an item available in the game currently which is strictly better?
---
You really like this addon.  I was just asking a question.  It doesn't make sense that someone flying over would trigger an event because they literally can't do anything.  Just because some random redditor who is spamming this thread says its a fact doesn't make that true.
---
I did read it before posting my original comment, my point still stands. I totally understand your viewpoint, but I also still believe that seeing these comments whenever Blizzard is mentioned is exactly the kind of thing we should be seeing. This goes for every company that bends the knee to that PoS government. I love WoW, I've played it since I was 7, Blizzard inspired me to work in tech, it used to be my dream to work for them. They deserve all the negative press they get, they deserve to be endlessly bombarded with every negative comment that they're getting. If people go quiet about this then it'll just fade into nothingness like every other issue. Im sorry that seeing these comments annoys you, but you aren't helping anyone by mocking them.
---
I remember having mostly greens and blues on my warlock alt and singlehandedly repelling a 5 man group at blacksmith in AB.
---
So much mitigation, healing, and fear that I just whittled them all down while healing back anything they did to me between fears.
---
But how
---
Which item available outside of raids is better for a hunter?
---
Play a Gnome, Frost Mage nonetheless.
---
Was AoE farming Deadpaw Furbolgs. Had this 60 Undead Priest turn out of nowhere, sees me running from some pulled mobs (he probably thought I waa running away from him). Had Blink&gt;MS active increase to get away from mob, but without context it looks like I was running from that priest. 
---
Guy follows me then starts casting MC,  I blink out of range. I remount, return to my spot ignoring him. He tries to MC me whilst I’m running through, ignoring him. Out of range his MC again. I make some distance and he’s out of my rendering view distance. I stop to drink, and get ready for the next pull. Next thing I know he’s behind me on his 100% speed mount. He recasts his MC, I attempt a counter spell but him being at least 12 levels above me he resists it like paper. Unable to outrun him with my 60% speed mount, I resign to my fate and let him MC me.
---
His MC goes through, he makes me jump for a while, makes me give him Arcane Intellect. Then he breaks the spell giving me his buffs in return. He bows, and makes his merry way.
---
That’s my new fact I learnt today.
---
As Alliance? Hell yeah.
---
As Horde? Ehhh. I guess.
---
As Undead? Fuck no.
---
heh okay bud
---
This is magical.
---
Friggin love it. Thanks for putting this together!
---
Long live CLASSIC!
---
Love that "is the mafia bannable clickbait"
---
A rage potion isn't going to allow a Warrior to kill someone before they even have control of their character, Thistle Tea might allow a Rogue with a free opener to do that however.
---
/r/comedycemetary
---
Chocolate chip please.
---
I don’t mean to come across as being morally superior, just genuinely frustrated. Boycotting brands is really the only tool that consumers have to let corporations like Activision-Blizzard know they’ve made a mistake.
---
Damn that's nice, I think I was only on there because I was actively running and when the zone transitioned I stopped and fell off.
---
To simulate world pvp environment. Rogue only ever enters a fight they have upper hand on. Its a class mechanic that rogue either gets a good open or runs and hides.
---
No healthstone because warlock is OP.
---
Later dork
---
Only in contested zones
---
Attack speed, but only to a point. More dps is still more dps, but you have to take the percentage damage reduction into consideration too. Would you rather have 20 damage reduced by 50%, or 50 damage?
---
The offhand is mostly a medium to deliver poisons and procs, so more swings equals more poisons and procs. The extra damage helps, but that's not its primary function.
---
Thanks! I've seen people clip the ledge standing before but I have yet to see this happen.
---
As someone who played on 4 vanilla PS and occasionally went onto their forums, I believe the hardcore legacy community is obsessed being on top, thier desire to dominate others would make the tal'darim cringe.
---
Also what exactly do youean by "autists"
---
Damn.. This makes me miss playing on rp servers
---
Blizzard could easily ban him, thus ending his career. The Chinese market is worth more to Blizzard than the Western world.
---
I don't just because it'd mean a garbage expac dropped
---
Nothing you said makes any sense whatsoever. Also 4 blizzards is like 4500 mana... if you have two mages you charge flamestrike and the other Novas right before you cast, then you get a shatter Flamestrike+COC on his Nova and then you Nova for his Flamestrike and COC and that kill every single mob and uses very little mana.
---
This thread is full of either REALLY bad mages or mage haters trying to make us look retarded.
---
SoC, Rank 1 Stun, Judgement.
---
Not when using instant afaik since it uses PPM
---
Please look-up “Cognitive Dissonance.”
---
Stealth classes only take fights they get the opener on in world pvp or they just run away.
---
4Head
---
It’s satire man
---
Why would u want the Valor set as a tank tho?
---
Classic is using retail macro functionality. So macros that didn't work then may work now.
---
No but it might let them kill someone before they have chance to get out of range of them, 2 or 3 hits is usually all they need for a clothie, if they can do that before they get the first cast or whatever off that's a win.
---
I do agree TTP is also very strong, but my point is that a rage potion is also strong in a similar sense.
---
By steal karma do you mean downvote? Because that's what I did
---
All I’m saying is if you are gonna allow engineers use their gizmos. Alchemist should be able to use potions. 
---
Otherwise if you aren’t a Engineer you will pretty much lose. The utility from grenade alone is huge.
---
I'm gonna try this myself.  The wife is not a fan  of video games in general and WoW in particular.  Gonna approach it as something we can do together other than veg in front of the TV watching re-runs.
---
Wish me luck!
---
Maybe your just a prick?
---
We just let her eat a few people as a ritual sacrifice to the loot gods. It works out well enough.
---
Smolderweb is med-high pop and its extremely active
---
No definitely haha I was being facetious in my original response. It’s bullshit honestly the situation in HK but really blizz was within the rights of the contract. Seeing what happens in HK definitely makes me appreciate my rights as a US citizen much more.
---
Can someone please ELI5 why DM is potentially going to inflate the economy?
---
And as a holy/prot paladin, how can I make the most of this?
---
Satire...
---
Never. Use dem feathers for slow fall
---
It's been starting to resemble the WOW subreddit and the cringefest that that had become.
---
I never RP’d but my first classic server was Thorium Brotherhood an RP server, I play PVP now but damn how the community is just different on a RP server from what I remember.
---
No real world politics or religion.
---
These topics very rarely end well, so it's best we stop things before they even start.
---
They can't ban someone for expressing their political views on their own stream.
---
This is actually just Pyrewood Village PVE server
---
so, stealth detecting racial passives/talents are disabled by a custom made rule? LOL
---
Do yourself a favor and download the unitscan addon. I spent a couple hours looking for him via eagle eye...got frustrated and logged off...downloaded this addon and found him within 10 minutes. I’m sure it was mostly just luck but he does look 95% similar to the regular cats all around him. This plays a loud AF notifier along with a pop up notification once he’s detected... particularly effective when you have track beasts activated. Plus it’s nice to have for elite NPCs needed for quests
---
It's all about minimizing down time. If you are out of combat then you are doing something wrong
---
Most mages don't even use Blizzard, literally Reddit just circle jerking lies. Or alternatively everyone on Reddit is like level 30 and is playing with the most casual players in the game. More likely scenario.
---
This is a regular PVE server, i'm just messing around with people to get reactions
---
Well, I see more people agreeing with me than with you. But you keep telling yourself that it was just 1 pull while harvesting all them downvotes
---
Try grinding HoJ and the chain.
---
Watch the only HoJ you see drop in 20 hours go to a hunter on his second run.
---
Ouh really? Cool! Stuff like this happens constantly on rp servers and it reminded me of the times I played there. Nevertheless, funny as heck!
---
Blizzard is not taking any sides with this action. Shoutcaster went against the rules when Blizzards' official broadcast channel was used to share personal viewpoints of China / Hong Kong situation. If anything they are staying neutral and showing it, while being misunderstood.
---
Just as Rends is a marginal upgrade for warrior/rogues over Krol+Mirah's (which is much easier to obtain).
---
It's an example using basic for fun.
---
While working on my xbow skill I shot a cockroach near Drakk and it pulled him! Luckily we were able to get it under control but what a surprise!
---
Yeah I cant think of a way to show the other one is better. Whether for PvE or PvP, masons is better.

I really should play more on RP servers

All pets are equally retarded.
---
Not everyone visits this subreddit several times a day. Some folks play WoW a lot, some a little. The things that feel like achievements to those two groups will differ. Some people are on Reddit a lot and others aren't.
---
The mods are censoring these opinions, so your post probably won’t last long, but I really appreciate your sentiment.
---
Dude these guys have literally mathematically solved who would win in these duels, trust me. Also there is no PvP trinket as well so rogues are kinda still op without tea.
---
You can shift out of poly and they can only sheep you out of form, so a good mage likely won't even try
---
Where can I find an addon that shows the 5 second rule?  
---
I just can't seem to find it anywhere online... (I found some but they don't work)
---
This is why I hate these stupid loot rules. Let the damn tank need on his BIS alone. I’ll gladly risk a ninja if it means that people get what they need. Stop trying to change what need before greed means.
---
I mean you could say the same about a rogue or warrior rolling against Blackcrow, an xbow. Yet I've lost 2 rolls against melee dps for it.
---
Only if it's really bad, hence why I brought up FFXIV.
---
Probably need to use castsequence or something but you just have to add /assist [player] to retarget
---
This is the culture that social media has fostered.  Everyone needs to be a star and share their life.
---
Little things, I guess. Today I had three groups lined up, paying me to summon their friends (I guess there weren't a lot of warlocks around). I see people constantly giving away free bags to new players. Randomly swinging by Darkshire, just to take part in the battle. (You know the one.)
---
Like 30 of us piling into the boat to Theramore, with levels ranging from 20 - 60. Just reminded me how people aren't going to disappear into the newest high level continent, and how even max level players need to travel the old fashioned way / need to go to lower level zones.
---
Went to our shammy healer in a team of all melee on the last time I saw it.  To be fare the leader said everyone need it.   We made him respec to enhance for the remainder of the run.
---
It's still greed, regardless of how you build your argumentation.
---
This makes me ill
---
Too many repairs, spending gold on professions, not choosing the most expensive quest reward, buying AH items, buying spells you don't need, using mats instead of selling, not putting boe's on AH.
---
How many did I hit?
---
When a eko drops it drops for the entire party. It's one of the few farmable items you can and should farm in groups.
---
I've lost 2 rolls against melee dps for my pre bis crossbow. That's just a stat stick for them. All this hypocrisy is killing me lol
---
Whats that inventory addon mate ? Can‘t seem to find a working one :(
---
Pretty sure it never drops your target in the first place.
---
Does Staff of Jordan have a drop chance on all level 40+ mobs or just certain ones?
---
It’s hard to say, very dependent on your gear. I would say in dungeon blues it’s probably not worth it, but idk depends what your weapons are
---
I just checked - if you enable every possible message in the combat log, when whoever is flying above you has any buffs, you will see entries like "X gained X's Demon Armor", etc. So if they have no buffs they probably wouldn't show up.
---
To all roll 51 specifically, yes.   To all roll the same number no.   1 out of 10k to just roll the same number.
---
They haven't abandoned it.  They just don't logg in for 4 hours every day.  The visit once a week.
---
I never really noticed them until WotLK when they started falling out of the sky and blowing me up. I don't think I ever managed to kill one.
---
Got both pretty easily, 2nd gorrosh and 3rd angerforge for me
---
Ahahah ! Some swords are even disappearing from hand when you'r on it !

I will admit I spent alot of time working on professions (all maxed except LW), I'm also a hunter. I am about to be 60. By my math it will have taken me 12 days play time.

Yes, it's annoying. But it gets upvoted. If what you thought was what the majority thought, then all those posts would get downvoted to hell. And they're not only upvoted, there are also tons of comments on there from people genuinely interested in them.
---
How do you explain that ? Simply, you're one of the few people who spend a lot of time around here and get to wade through enough "I did this !" posts to grow bored of them. But you're the minority, sadly.
---
This post won't change anything. The only way to get what you want is create a new subreddit where memes and achievement posts are banned and discussion posts encouraged.
---
It’s basically impossible for a rogue to win a fight if he doesn’t get an opener. 
---
Spell batching fucks vanish up 90% of the time.
---
Did not receive one.
---
Paladin or druid is going to win.
---
Why would you need to share it with thousands of random people though? It is narcissistic.  You can be proud of something and not post it on the internet for fake validation.  If you can't, then that is a bit sad to me.
---
thats awesome. runescape does it better tho.
---
It doesn't.
---
I got a binding as a rogue is that worthy of your standards?
---
Daily Reminder that If the Forsaken were exterminated like the roaches they are, that a good 65% of all atrocities committed since WC3 Would've been avoided.

Thanks mate !

Only the repairs bit
---
What makes Mara more difficult?
---
I've had alot of disconnection issues since this last patch.  Primarily would occur during zone transitions.  I would be booted off flight paths (usually to my death) disconnected when entering or exiting instances and ending up in random places after taking a zeppelin and hitting the loading screen. (Like ending up in Brill after hitting the UC &gt; Org zep loading screen). 
---
 Several reinstallations, deletion of addons and resetting of interface folders later I was ready to give up.  Eventually found what so far seems to be a solution in using a vpn.  Take that for what you will.
---
I mean blizz pretty clearly said don’t talk about politics, he signed a contract saying he wouldn’t. So it’s his fault for what happened. Not saying o agree or even like what they’re doing. But he is at fault for breaking contract.
---
I'm a warrior and very close to 30, I bought all the mats for the whirlwind axe, now I just need some help with collecting 30 tusk and killing the lvl 40 elite. How much should I be offering for someone to help me with these two things?
---
&gt;deficient
---
Pets are only as dumb as the people controlling them.
---
There's nothing wrong with killing dead people.
---
Was this confirmed by blizz? I seem to remember in Vanilla once you reached that 50 gold per respec it just stayed at 50 gold forever.
---
The Crossroads is the Heathrow of Kalimdor :P
---
A lot of these posts have been from people who struggle to get much time in the game. It's easy for some to level land grind there way up but less so for others.
---
If I'm Freud, you're a 12 year old child.
---
hahah bro you made our night with that
---
I really like it! At first I was sad at the loss of 2H focus, but the more I read it, the more I loved it! Some numbers might be a bit crazy, though Enhancement is comparatively underperforming so much, it kinds works...
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who has thought of Shaman redesigns... 
---
My idea, was to essentially borrow a bit from Paladin... You had 1 Shock spell, whose effect matched your Weapon Spell (but didn't consume it). And that your Lightning Shield also matched the Weapon Spell. This would result in an extra Wind Shock, Water Shield, Earth Shield and Magma Shield
---
So for instance... Rockbiter Weapon, Earth Shock, Earth Shield (similar to retail). Frostbrand Weapon, Frost Shock, Water Shield (similar to retail), etc... 
---
Though you could essentially combine my idea and yours, so that the the effect of the 'Lightning Shield' matched the Shield Buff spell instead of the Weapon one!
---
I also didn't know Boomkins were in phase 1.
---
anything but your fuckin level 40 mount or your random world purple....
---
strange no one wanted to join in on your awful business strategies
---
I like the missing chapeau, must have been looted already.
---
The thing is Blizzard marched head-on into the political crosshairs when they demonstrated their political bias. They’re using their terms of service to deflect from the real moral implications of their actions.
---
There is "SavedInstances" for retail, but I can't find a classic version for it.
---
Not everyone likes being in a guild. There is always some drama, clicks, bullshit going on even if they say it’s a drama free guild. Some people don’t want to be pestered to heal/tank all the time. Some people get social pressure that makes them uncomfortable in a guild. Some people want to just play the damn game. 
---
They should be allowed to share their achievements.
---
Politics is involved in EVERY aspect of our lives. It is impossible to interface with the human experience in an apolitical way. Stop hiding from reality.
---
Is there no way a druid can solo this?  Is it just too hard?  I never fucked with it in vanilla
---
You must be a shit rouge then friend. Rogues beat mages with full cds especially if you're dagger spec with imp sprint. Against a priest it is rock paper scissors, paladins are easy as well and you should win against a druid if you have the opener.
---
[Here](https://classicdb.ch/?item=873) is a list that drop the staff and their drop rates.
---
can u guys stop removing like 90% of the memes posted for being "low effort" while you're at it? even if the memes themselves don't always take a lot of effort the discussion they create is usually good. just because a person spends 10 hours in photoshop vs 10 minutes in ms paint doesn't make their meme any better or worse. just let the upvote/downvote system handle it please.
---
I showed this to the missus and she laughed very much thank you :D
---
Yep some dude explained it to me on another thread of this post thanks though
---
When you're in a hostile world, and clothing imparts actual advantages, you'll wear what makes you the most powerful.  Now get in that dress, soldier!
---
Bruh real success would be no longer needing to work and playing wow during that time instead.
---
Nah, it definitely decayed 5g a month. I don’t remember what it bottomed out at though.
---
Dude. So good.
---
You mean the stuff that’s been figured out for 15 years already?
---
Priests are overall better healers, in fact the best healers overall and into the 30's and 40's they really start to stand out as they get all their skills. Keep at it and once you have prayer of mending, holy nova, and greater heal you'll start to stand out if you learn how to use each heal effectively.
---
Paladins are the best single target healers though with top level throughput at a level of mana efficiency no other class can match. They can heal for longer than any other class. But it's all they can do really. It's two heals, a fast one and a medium speed one, with a talent for a bad instant heal that's never worth taking outside of a specific PvP spec once you have AQ40 gear or better.
---
Shamans have the best buffs/support with totems, but their healing is the worst of all the healers. Not by a large amount, but they have low throughput and effiecentcy. They can also do great burst damage even speccing deep resto.
---
Druids have the three best oh-shit buttons of all the healers with battle Rez, innervate and tranquility. The worst mana effiecentcy but throughput that matches pallys.
---
I love all of your videos because of the editing, makes it ten times better
---
Oh I’m not disagreeing with you at all, only issue is if it’s in a contract, and you break it then that is completely on you. I don’t feel bad for Blitzchung, because it was his choice to do that.
---
You're objectively wrong and it's clear you haven't pvped in vanilla a lot. 'rogues beat mages' is completely laughable.
---
Yes it is, I never said it wasn't. It's even greedier though for a person to think they can bypass a 300g+ price tag by saying "I nEeD iT" and screwing the rest of the party out of gold. It isn't the same as a BoP that someone could only vendor for 10g. So I support the "everyone needs it" argument.
---
Another alternative would be if there was a party sale version where the person that actually needs it could buy it for a reduced fee from the group and the group split the gold.

That's not a Power Word that's a Curse Word

hoes mad
---
If people validate you its not fake. I told my guild when i hit 40 and was chatting about my 60s after the mount. They are on the internet and responded which made me feel like others recognised the achievement. 
---
I work and have a 6 month old, when i can and try to put in some wow time when it fits. I'm was super hyped getting my mount at 40 since it is a big deal to me and for many others it is to.
---
Weapons tend to disenchant into essences more than dust. And blue items will disenchant into shards.
---
&gt; Blizzard: Don't talk politics on stream
---
not a rule.
---
The rule was literally "don't offend anybody" and "At Blizzard's sole discretion"
---
Put those two things together and no, it's actually literally anything if they want it to be.
---
What about the other instances of streamers displaying political allegiances, and receiving no punishment whatsoever? It certainly seems as though this circumstance with Blitzchung was dealt with in a uniquely harsh way. Not to mention, Blizzard’s Chinese social media directly condemned Blitzchung for anti-Chinese sentiments - even though he only voiced support for Hong Kong’s independence.
---
It doesn’t matter if he signs a contract then he is binding himself to agree with that companies terms. If he breaks them it’s on him.
---
Going somewhere?
---
They demonstrated their political bias by not allowing any political talk?  I think the real problem is you're upset at blizzard for NOT having the same political bias as you.  You see neutrality as biased because you see yourself as unbiased but the reality is clear.
---
Is there a fix to this?
---
Let me ask you this, though:  Who do you imagine wrote it, if it were actually written by a Chinese person?  Tencent?  Chinese government?  Or maybe a mysterious third party?
---
Who, in your mind, would dictate Blizzard make this announcement?
---
scepter entrance area
---
Stop it, 95% of WoW fanbase don't care about this.
---
No, pets are absolute retarded, it's just that some of us have managed to work around how fucking retarded they are.
---
If you don't think pets are retarded, you haven't played a hunter in classic (and I'm not talking about pservers, because they were actually reasonable on those)
---
Why are you still paying Blizzard money?
---
quit caring about this stuff so much and you'll enjoy your life a lot more
---
"General macros" are filled from my druid because specific macro tab is shit small, so that leaves roughly 18 for my rogue?
---
There are a few classes that can solo grind trash packs in DM that drop gray items that vendor for quite a bit, this will dump lots of extra gold into the economy and devalue currency
---
He casts mana shield on the balrog tho, and is the wielder of the secret flame.  Sounds like a mage to me
---
What addon do you use to see party buffs in your party frames??? Thank you!!!
---
Yes but people don't have pvp trinket so that's a HUGE disadvantage. A good rogue will EASILY beat a warrior without even getting touched.
---
you’re*
---
People are excited and sharing that. Why is that a problem.
---
Is that really what you believe? I'm not wrong and neither are the people you immediately assume are supporters of the Chinese government lol
---
These guys are doing a great job illustrating why there's laws against cartel price fixing in real world economies. 
---
Blizzard needs to ban the whole lot of them for a while to knock some sense into them.
---
No? The Scarlet Crusade only accepts humans
---
Yea but at least you would have some familiarity with your guild members. You aren't just blasting your level 40 mount to thousands of randoms, which to me is kinda sad and desperate. You are right though, to each his own.
---
You are the guy that later claims in raids the items should go to the people with the worst gear.
---
Lol why would you give it to anyone else besides the main tank? What did he not spend money on??
---
Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Thanks, I needed that laugh.
---
So you'd take the opportunity of a small agi boost stat stick that you will hold till 2 phases in the future until you can equip it and have it be a benefit even if the cost is to deny a warrior or rogue a meaningful item now that significantly boosts their dps? If you play on Atiesh or Benediction, please pm me your name so I can add you to my ignore list.
---
You see something you don’t like now everyone has to change to suit you?  Mature.
---
Oh kno it's the grammar police, piss off this ain't college kid
---
Does he think you're botting? Most botters wont be wearing raid gear lol
---
I posted about mine on this sub.
---
As a level 53 Rogue I was able to twice steal Devilsaur leather off of a level 60 of the opposing faction.
---
no*
---
He showed up on stream in a gas mask to push for the hong kong protests. This isnt a slight nod to politics. It is hijacking the stream for his own personal political beliefs
---
&gt; What about the other instances of streamers displaying political allegiances, and receiving no punishment whatsoever?
---
You mean like other players displaying allegiances with HK and not getting punished? Yea, those certainly would bring into doubt whether or not it was the specific political opinions that caused the punishment.
---
&gt; ot to mention, Blizzard’s Chinese social media directly condemned Blitzchung for anti-Chinese sentiments
---
That was NetEase's social media, NOT Blizzard.
---
Of course the people still crying about this side with the guy who used blizzards platform for his own political agenda.   They're doing the same thing on reddit in blatant defiance of this subreddits rules.  Go to /r/politics if you want to talk politics.
---
Roll away, if you’re healing, you’ve earned that int cloth
---
By chance, are you familiar with the Uyghur Muslims? I promise you this isn’t a political bias, this is a protest of human rights violations.
---
I would bet my life savings that Truestrike is nowhere near a 10% drop rate.
---
What political bias?
---
Yeah, he acted like a decent human being. Your point?
---
Why do you think he is a shit rogue? He just stated what people in vanilla and private servers found out and think about rogues as a duelling class in 1v1 tourneys.
---
I mean you can join the tourney and show everyone that all the people playing pvp on private servers over the last 15 years are wrong.
---
It went right over you're head didnt it.
---
You have to appeal before anyone checks.
---
But with the state of their understaffed CS department and the quotas they probably have, good luck with getting *ANY* attention on it.
---
the awkward moment standing on a boat with a group of horde and the shaman puts down his totems
---
Obby pls
---
It's BIS for melee too. I have the xbow from strat UD.
---
Thanks so much! The other one I looked at seemed a little sparse
---
your* didn’t*
---
Yeah lock or spriest, is SL allowed?
---
Yes I've been familiar with that before a mob told me to care about china.  Blizzard isn't responsible for that stop using them as a whipping boy
---
Just upvote and move on my dude let people have their moment
---
A good practice to get into that nobody has mentioned yet is to mark things. Bind mark skull, and before every pull just mark something. You’re free to sunder the other enemies and taunt the skull when you lose aggro. By the time taunt wears off it should be dead or close to it, and you’ll have enough threat built up on the other mobs that keeping aggro the rest of the pull should be a breeze. However, if your dps is just unloading AoE as soon as you pull it’s going to be near impossible to keep aggro. If nobody is dying then don’t worry too much and just do the best you can.
---
&gt; Lol why would you give it to anyone else besides the main tank
---
Because said MT clearly showed he has no interest in spending money on making the raids better for anyone, so what would make you think he'd spend the thousands of gold to finish the sword?
---
75g is fucking insane.
---
Why wouldn't you just princess run it normall and take your odds at that point?
---
I thought this mushroom farm was only for classes with stealth. How do I accomplish this without?
---
so,i can try find public raid even as 60 holy priest with just half preraid BiS items and no expensive consimables? or i still need full BiS set?
---
Now imagine if you spent that time grinding gold and just bought +21 bracers on the AH. You'd have the bracers *and* tons of gold!
---
Sure and that is awesome that you could share that with your guildies, people that you know, or kinda know at least.  Seeking validation from random people in a mass setting like this sub is desperate, imo.
---
Thanks for explaining why rather than just stating something and telling anyone who refuses to just take your statement at face value as being wrong with no explination.
---
I think you got a little too upset there that you forgot how to read. I said unless you have coordinated mages, so if you’re running with a consistent group then sure. It’s just not worth the effort imo to explain the whole rotation and coordination to every new group you run with.
---
No one cares
---
Tbh without rage potions warriors would have zero chance against classes that can shield themselves.
---
What class uses a five second rule and why, sorry just curious. Have you looked on the curse forge site, should be able to sort by patch.
---
Thanks for this! Looks pretty straightforward. Gonna give it a try. 
---
Can I ask how your alt and your main are in a party together? I didn't realize that was possible.
---
Thunderfury going to a clicker amazing

Not all mobs can be CCd. In UBRS you find groups of mobs often that cannot be CCd. So your dumbass pills aggro on a mob that you literally cannot slow. Have fun blinking and running away while the melee dps can't follow them all around.
---
Can beat mages, can beat priests currently (if you're good that is because you just don't let them play the game iirc, assuming they don't resist a stun). Don't know the other matchups or care though. Also can beat druids.       
---
But you can pretend they can only beat 3 classes if it makes you feel better
---
It's not about being necessary, it's about showing respect for each other's time.
---
The disease is Melee range only and has a cast time that makes it so the mob can't move. As soon as they start casting you take 4 or 5 steps away and the cast will fail.
---
On second thought, let’s not go to stormwing. ‘Tis a silly place.
---
Level 40 to me was a big deal, as is running a 5k to many people. Me i run marathons, and i make sure that if someones proud of there 5k i tell them how shit of an achievement it is.
---
For those who have never heard of Markdown, you do that by putting four spaces at the beginning of each line.
---
For whatever reason in classic mobs can melee you from 15 feet away and will randomly attack 3x in a second
---
Built my own guild from scratch, best ragnaros and onyxia, and I think the best part is all the little inside jokes that have alreary established themselves within the guild. It really seems like one big community, which is neat.
---
Good point. You shouldn't be an enchanter, then.
---
I’m sorry to hear that. I did feel so lucky to see it my first go and roll a 100 on it. At level 48.
---
I am lvl 55 and like 16 days played
---
I roll over casters and melee for every item. 
---
Holy paladins use everything.
---
This video is dangerous, now all of us epic mount owners have to watch our backs. Some guy tried to pick pocket me on the way to the fp in if.
---
Imagine thinking rogues beat mages is a joke when its nearly a pure skill matchup if you talk to any of the top mage/rogue players lol
---
They turn around after a kidney shot so you can back stab em
---
Wow, the sense of entitlement in this post is off the charts. Not to mention the disgusting bootlicking.
---
You can smash through the first 9 bosses as long as it’s not their first rodeo. We oneshot them all. Tanks using no consumes except hp pots / defense pots for baron
---
I made this macro so I can switch between enemies and start attacking each time I switch target. I moved this to my 2nd action bar and keybind it to my tab key.
---
.#showtooltip
---
/targetenemy
---
/cast attack
---
/start attack
---
Remove the dot on the first line. The spaces in the last two lines are important, I found if it wasn't spaced it would not start attacking. Hope this helps.
---
No he's not though. He's stating things we know aren't true from private servers
---
Your loss then, lol
---
Delicious, nutritious Ghost Mushrooms!

What add-on do you use to see your health and monsters' health bar? Or is that feature in the settings? I want to see the exact health I have, but I have not found how.

Viper sting.

Thats not even an argument, i cant even remember seeing a single 1v1 under usual 1v1 tournament rules that one of those guys won.

I hope your argument isnt something like "but I saw perplexity winning against a SL-Lock once with every item in the game that counters this class + engineering and consumables".

Also improved AI with Princess and iffy pet micro functionality :/

Weirdly we have 2 boomkins in our mc farming guild. Holy palas and casters love them so much &lt;3
---
People have different opinions and preferences to you.
---
I'm inclined to believe you but I just feel something is fishy when the Crusader recipe only costs 150g yet the fee is 25g on your server.
---
What proof do you have of them mass muting you? 
---
For all we know you're one of those guys that posts their macro in /1 /2 /Y at the same time every 30 seconds, I've reported those before just like I assume many others do too. Or perhaps you just had some obnoxious shit in your macro shitting on other enchanters? We've also got a fair amount of those "free" enchanters on my server.
---
I myself only use 1 channel and post about every 5 minutes just out of precaution of this happening.
---
 That wasn't the point. The point wasn't how they treat their animals  like crap. Only how it is a defensible position to be okay with eating  cows and not dogs. I'm a meat eater myself, but feel that most people  shit on China for eating dogs while they themselves eat other kinds of  meat themselves. Probably lots of different types of meats that are  horrendously treated and slaughtered in China, wouldn't surprise me.
---
Okay good, now we can have a conversation.
---
If asking questions is being a sea lion to you, then how do you get answers?
---
Not true, i got 202 unbuffed fire-res and i got bunted twice last week
---
These comments actually make me want to open another subscription to reverse the stupidity brought on by the anti-blizzard band wagoners
---
you can care all you want, JUST not here and not on this sub and not in-game and not on blizzard e-sports broadcasts, go away
---
Wow, what a great complaint in a horde only tournament with 0 stealth-related racial passives and the only relevant talent being available in a stealth vs stealth mirror (rogue's Heightened Senses).
---
Pretty much every class has different optimal specs for PvP and PvE. That doesn't mean one spec can't work for both, it just means that someone speccing specifically for PvP will have an advantage.
---
Some classes can use the same gear in either scenario, like Mages. Some classes require entirely different sets of gear for each, like DPS Warriors.
---
A lot of people simply respec once or twice a week when going between Raids and PvP. It is expensive, but at level 60 there are several ways to farm gold quickly. You just have to put it the time.
---
People with Raid gear will have a significant advantage over those who are in greens and dungeon blues, at least until Battlegrounds come out and PvP gear is released. 
---
You will need to achieve PvP Rank 10 to get access to all the good PvP armor, and even higher than that for the PvP weapons. Rank 10 is a pretty long, but manageable grind. Ranks 11-14 require a lot more persistence to achieve. If you are not a top 5% PvPer, you will likely need to get a good weapon from elsewhere (Raids)
---
For Rogues, Dagger builds are typically better for PvP because they are burst damage builds, and daggers attack faster, thus apply poisons faster and knockback enemy spellcasts more.
---
You can PvP with a Combat swords build and do alright, especially in Battlegrounds as just being disruptive with Cheap Shots and other stuns can benefit your team. Dagger builds still perform significantly better.
---
If you want to do mostly PvP, and don't want to constantly respec, you can pick a dagger build and do decent DPS in 5/10 man PvE dungeons, but a Raid spot will be hard to come by. Not impossible, both Onyxia and Molten Core are already being done with pick up groups, but if you want a good Raiding experience to get better PvP gear ahead of Rank 10 in Phase 3, you will have to spec Combat swords.
---
All of the people on reddit who care about human rights?

Yoooo, whats up gromek, didn't know you used this sub.

So you can care, just not anywhere that it might actually matter.

Can only do money with devilsaur?
---
Who told you that?

There are plenty of ways to make gold that doesnt even require skinning or ungoro crater farming...
---
Everything has been #nochanges so far, so I would expect Trib runs will be the same.
---
Lol yes. He is. He thinks tanks should use consumables in EZPZ MC...... first 8 bosses are a joke. Maybe major HP pots at the most.
---
That is sad; I leveled a second druid in Vanilla to pvp as Boomkin. That dance made it all worthwhile
---
People clear MC with characters that aren't even 60 yet. You'll be fine if you have half your pre-BiS.

There are millions of people all over the world that “are not free”, only sheltered idiots who absorb unrealistic ideologies think that showing social protest on a video game or discussion forum is going to change anything. 
---
People play games to escape certain realities of the real world, and obviously people who are not even involved in politics at a local level other than voting think they are accomplishing something by attempting to represent a country they know nothing about and will never visit.

All are viable in raids and pvp. Warlocks are underrepresented currently (at least on alliance whitemane). Mage will level faster and you'll be richer. Hunter makes soloing things easy and you'll have the option to farm dire maul.
---
Asking questions in bad faith makes you sea lion.  Just don’t do what you did if you want answers.  🤷‍♀️

Gaming tournaments should be about gaming, not about political discussion. Games are an escape from that stuff.

If I wanted to delve into that cesspit, I would be browsing r/politics...

I do have aoe (shaman) but the cost of water might outweigh the profits.
---
I can't be bothered to fiddle with graphics settings so I zoom in minimap to the max, which lets me stand pretty much right on top of the herb. That's usually enough to spot it.
---
Spamming subreddits with "boycott this" sure helps the oppressed
---
When you get to the other capitol cities ask the guard for where the weaponmasters are.
---
As a hunter have picked one of the best classes for farming even before dm release with farms like solo mara or devilsaurs.
---
If you complain about gold income as a hunter now then dm release will likely not help, even with tribute being soloable which nobody can reliably say if it will be right now.
---
So you can be specced combat while raiding and get some gear, then respec to whatever you want for PvP once you get it. 
---
Best weapons for PvP would probably be Perdition's + core hound tooth (both daggers, both from mc), if you're doing a backstab/ambush spec. Swords (e.g. onyxia sword) is better if you're going for a hemo stunlock spec. Either of these are most likely going to require several weeks of raiding to acquire, and if you're averse to raiding you can stick to pre-raid bis and still do ok in PvP.
---
Im sure you can point to all those 1v1 tourneys with good players attending that were won by rogues.
---
They do not even ban soul link in this tourney and their are no trinkets...
---
quick, buy a lotto ticket!
---
Yeah sorry but you were doing it wrong. Maybe try downloading questie and following a guide. No wonder you got burned out, it probably felt like walking up an escalator that's going down
---
People are idiots who have been groomed to react extremely irrationally to events that have nothing to fucking do with them.
---
Ok, Mr no-fun-allowed
---
The only thing that really matters is Blizzard's stance on this situation, which is if there are no predetermined rolling rules the person rolling need on boe wins the item fair and square.
---
there's going to be a ton of restealthes, don't worry.  
---
Rogues always get the opener, it's dueling etiquette, warriors usually get the charge. It's dueling etiquette.
---
Level 20? Have you been playing since launch?
---
Yeah I totally agree, that would be so boring... Be nice, not snappy. :) 
---
Though I wouldn't have got asked nicely like that anyway :( 
---
Cause you would've been buffed the moment I saw you! :D
---
I've alted a bit on buffing classes, and often OOM'd buffing passerby.
---
I have Perl is it the same as zperl?
---
Which class?
---
only humar the pridelord does it weirdly enough, none of my other pets have done it!
---
Because they heal snipe and are super efficient.
---
I have no idea. If u were to try to find this out my thinking would be take the median number of the min max damage of the weapon and divide it by the attack speed. Do it to both weapons and compare and check it out.
---
That’s just what I would do to try and get a rough estimate. No idea if I’m right though.
---
Lol you'll be back.
---
Can I have all your stuff?
---
It literally doesn't affect me in the slightest, and it wouldn't affect you either if you didn't let it.
---
Think it's in razor hill.
---
Not if you don’t have skinning
---
Then we agree to disagree. I see chain pulling an entire instance as 1 pull. And Im pretty sure boosting has nothing to do if you get help by your lower level companion(s) or not. People sell mythic raid boosts on retail, and their customers also help dps and heal and stuff. They benefit because I allow them to complete the thing in 5 minutes. Thats all there is to it.
---
I want it even though I don’t think I’d ever use more than the 2 set seriously.
---
Just something to waste bag space on.
---

---
How does the add-on work for PvP servers. Does it aggregate data from other players?
---
All talent builds are allowed, but you have to stick to one spec.
---
Yeah but I think his point is no one cares.
---
I thought every Hunter Trainer gave it? Either way, the Razor Hill one definitely has it.

You won't go through shield + life of a pvp specced priest bevor he is starting to fear / dot you to death. Undead wont help much without trinket.
---
What server?
---
Yup. It's in the hut on the left side as you enter from the south
---
Used that line on Tinder , got blocked #FeelsBadMan
---
I have it in my bank , still have no idea who they are lol
---
They were childhood friends. And years later during MoP when we kill Whitemane for the second time her last word is "Mograine".
---
It's not explicit but I think it's says enough to assume their relationship was more than superior-subordinate.
---
All of the guilds involved in this should be server muted, fuck em.
---
It's kinda a leftover of vanilla beta when mages had legit invis.
---
you might not like it, but this is peak shaman
---
They're collecting your personal data and selling it to 3rd parties.  You're the product.
---
23 or so.
---
Best thing I’ve seen all day
---
What a weird ruleset. Gl tho.
---
i'm out here reporting "i'm level 40 look at me" posts in the /new queue everyday i got you fam
---
Most ppl will sell it if there are better things in raid which there often are
---
I read online the druids can use daggers, what level can I learn them?
---
That’s on you.
---
The defias mages and trappers.
---
I highly doubt the community would allow this unless certain realms became dead
---
I do. *unzips*
---
7str = 1 dps is a decent approximation, it's not 100% exact, but it's close enough that it wont *really* make a difference if that's the only thing you're deciding based on.
---
What makes him better then other pets?
---
Light feathers are $$$ on ah on skeram
---
Yes you should. Classic has skewered stat assignments... an upgrade is an upgrade is an upgrade. Especially for such a vital role like Healing!
---
Why are you hiding your gold? Too rich or too poor?
---
You trade him the gold and choose high or low, Its usual 60/40 in the service providers favor, he rolls the dice and either keeps your gold or gives you double if you win
---
Yeah if you read what I wrote you'll see I mentioned the multiple types of boost including a group boosting a single player for gear or whatever such as the m+ in retail you said.
---
Chain pulling isn't 1 pull. Literally the definition is 1 single pull, not multiple smaller pulls with killing between.
---
I have yet to see any RP on Bloodsail Buccaneers .
---
I’m in your shoes too brother all my. Buddies went Herod but I didn’t wanna wait either. Now I’m on Smolder Web
---
Yeah I was reading it on mobile, and unfortunately it's not formatted for it so it made it rather difficult to read. NS is only a 2 min cd so it should be reset each duel regardless of rules
---
I have 350G as a warrior rn (lucky boe drops i sold) and idk if i should buy some gear or save it for an epic mount? Also how can i make more gold? Im lvl 54 and im saving EPL quests for level 60 also
---
4 taps but only ore and some stone :-(
---
Why we had paid server transfers in vanilla.  I fully expect we'll have them in classic
---
Not saying it’s not a fair ability. It is good as an oh-shit button but seems more for pvp to do on the run to avoid getting spell locked by enemy dps.
---
Most healing in PvE as a Druid is done with ranked 5 or 4 healing touch spam on main tank, and rejuvs on dps that pull aggro. Healing touch and rejuv are the primary healing abilities being used 90% of the time. The only ones used besides those are usually regrowth for fast emergency heal or tranquility to get the whole group up a bit. 
---
Swiftmend basically not getting used because it’s not mana efficient, and not a super necessary ability since 99% of the time you’ll be spamming healing touch. Better to put talent points in other trees besides resto after you pick up the essentials for mana regen and healing touch.

"Vanilla wasn't perfect, but blizzard fixed many of the problems the wrong way"

Gavrilo Princip kind of move. One shot and shit hits the fan
---
There’s a Carmen San Diego / Orc pun in there somewhere but I can’t think of one.
---
Oh okay I didn’t know that, If that’s true than I’d also expect paid server transfers to be included at some time
---
AN ANIMATION? WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?!
---
im 20 days played and im 59. who cares) dont force urself just to speed lvl cause everyone leveling faster
---
So everyone should need? That doesn’t seem right...
---
Welcome to every single subreddit dedicated to a game. There's no antidote but heavier moderation.
---
twinks are mainly a thing for BGs as alts.  they are expensive so yes get your guy to 60 first.  a bis lvl 19 twink piece of gear can go for like 40-60g.  its much higher for 29 and 39 too.
---
Same.Even when one faction greatly outnumbers other seem ppl on boat are usually peaceful
---
If you're the official healer you're allowed to roll on any healing gear no questions. If you also want to roll on DPS gear you should let the group know at the start. Most probably wouldn't have a problem with it but it's always good to let the group know if you want to double dip on gear.
---
except this is now frontpage
---
The cockroaches are pretty buggy
---
The zeppelins were already paid for during WC3.
---
I made money on almost every single skillup for tailoring.  That having been said, I was among the top 50 levelers on my server and was always a full day ahead of the curve for the next tier of bags.  If you were doing it today, you're basically eating all the combines until 200ish.
---
Thanks for the offer but I'm on Thunderfury. I don't have a guild and how much good should I offer someone to help me?
---
Pick up the flight path in Azshare and you won't have to go down through Theramore.
---
The value of weapon DPS varies depending on the speed of the weapon. For non dagger 1 handed weapons with 2.4 speed, the value of 1 DPS is exactly equal to 14 attack power. For slower weapons, the value is greater because it increases instants slightly more.
---
With buffs like kings, 7 strength is more than 14 attack power, but without buffs 7 strength is 14 attack power.
---
That's a totally awesome way to play too. 
---
When I started vanilla, I was only sixteen. I had MMO experience from playing everquest and DAoC, but I was by no means hard core. I didnt hit sixty until just before the gates of AQ opened.
---
Being thirty three now, living full on bachelor, I have way more free time than I did then. I can play how I want. 
---
But the feeling that I got back then, and the feeling I get now, every time i log in, is indistinguishable. 
---
The beauty of this game, in this form, is that it doesn't punish players for being casual. It let's us experience our characters story at our pace.
---
&gt; Being that 15 agility won't be out untill phase 3.
---
So now we're adding new conditions?
---
This is a made up talent tree, not related to in game.

Ha ha you fool.... love it he is a little scamp

23 druid minding my own business, killing mobs for a quest. Roughly 50% hp when the 31 hunter starts shooting me in the back. Nice.
---
they really should not allow server transfers, i am sort of getting a rep on my server a non-snowflake i call people out for talking shit etc etc, i would go full ham if i knew in a couple months i could just transfer,
---
It is not as easy as it used to be, angling is the most important part and its hard to explain angling you just kind of get a feel for it. One of the people in my Discord made a guide for it (The guide is for retail, but it works for classic since they run off the same backend) which might help you  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXppoiTSSm8&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXppoiTSSm8&amp;t=1s)
---
True, but besides mounts, skills and perhaps repairs, how much do NPC prices really matter?
---
I have honestly no idea and I would love to see a statische on how much (as a ratio) of the gold players spend goes towards NPCs/sinks and how much is simply transfered to other players. And how that ratio changes over a server's life span.
---
14 AP gives 1 dps to your weapon.
---
7 str = 14 ap for 2hand classes
---
So in this case: Waveslicer has 50dps + 26 str = 53.71 dps.
---
Reletless scythe has 20str 53dps = 55.86 dps.
---
However I would also consider speed as well, not just dps.
---
Edgy
---
A quest in 1k needles that has you killing the centaur's near freewind post. The wrangler's will net for 8s run back and shoot you with a bow possibly pulling in other mobs.
---
You were proven wrong and went straight to insults instead of trying to back up your claim. Do the math on feign death costs, if you're capable of doing arithmetic (I doubt it)
---
More info pls
---
There is a console command to turn down the screen glow, it helps immensely. Also one to turn off the glow when you are a ghost corpse running.
---
So you're saying if a warlock has his succubus out, don't go in. Got it.
---
No there won't be faction changes.
---
It’s like they want to dish it out but can’t take it back
---
banned for what?
---
Leveling in Stranglethorn Vale. Some of the best world PvP I've experienced since Dark Souls 3.
---
You think this is bad? On Razorgore alliance side, one warrior has a complete monopoly on crafting the Lionheart Helmet. I'm willing to bet he's made a fair bit of money off of that.
---
Learn to stunlock
---
wow, you get it!
---
Alt is hunter
---
Are you following a quest guide? Like how do you know what quests to do etc?
---
We're not adding any new conditions. It's always been like that. Spear is better till phase 3.
---
DAOC.
---
I agree this makes much more sense
---
That's so dope. I had a similar experience with a troll rogue. Working on cauldrons in EPL late night, slightly under leveled, I was struggling with the second part. 
---
A troll rogue of similar level showed up and killed the quest mob for me, let me loot and complete the quest. The minute I stepped off the farm he jumped me. I want to lie and say I made a valiant effort, but he messed me up real quick. 
---
I ressed, ran back and turned in and headed to the next stop. Lo and behold my troll friend was there. Rinse and repeat. I made a better showing this time around, but in the end he prevailed. 
---
Final part of the quest, same story. As I lay dying, the emotes a salute and ran off into the sunset. God speed unknown troll. Good luck and happy hunting.
---
no my actual IRL family is playing on that server.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. I’m also tired of the “wow double dal’rends, I used up all my luck” posts. 
---
I’ve seen so many that at this point I’m expecting both of them to drop on my first run.
---
Dude just open with cheapshot-gouge-cb evis and theyre almost dead. Figure out the rest
---
They are very tricky to play and require a lot of good practice. But a great mage can beat anything
---
&gt; You're also demanding the religious values of these organizations be respected, without expecting them to respect people who happen to be attracted to the "wrong" sex. Your concern for authoritarianism only cuts one way, which makes your argument deeply disingenuous.
---
And here we go, I personally don't belong to any religion, but I understand their fear of being legislated into celebrating sin, in their eyes.
---
A parent choosing an adoption agency should be allowed to go with a religiously-affiliated one. Don't adopt from them if you don't want to support that, but you can hardly say demanding others treat people the way you want them to is not authoritarianism.
---
Reminds me of a certain wow machenima

Not everyone has 20 hours to just sit down and play a videogame. I have a lot to do outside of the world of warcraft. My time in game is better spent on other things right now, like actually reaching level 60.
---
If you're healing - Roll on every int/healing gear but not plate 
---
If you're Tanking - roll on plate but not cloth
---
Don't roll on plate if you're healing, unless the tank/other plate users greed on it or if you're the only one who can equip it.
---
I think it's a lot of people who are either new or didn't play back in the day. For the new peeps they don't have the experience of how professions work yet so can't maximise gold income and don't know all the little tricks we all learned over the years for getting gold as you go. 
---
For the peeps familiar with modern wow they may be surprised how slowly it goes compared to modern wow. The vanilla struggle was real and you're making a weeks worth of classic gold in two quests on retail so they maybe never learned how to scrape by either, and where priorities should be in terms of what order to learn skills and what not to waste gold on just yet.
---
Weak af
---
No, we were never talking about right now, we were talking in general.

I've got a gorilla that'll do this.  Kill a mob, then stand over it's corpse scratching his ass.

My try hard friends that rushed to 60 are in the same boat.  Morons.

Yawn.

The font is hard to read. I'd try a different one, or maybe just Bold it. I'd recommend giving each bubble its own separate background color as well. I think it would improve readability.

Otherwise, nice work!

The quest to find a dps spot in a dungeon group is one I can't seem to complete.
