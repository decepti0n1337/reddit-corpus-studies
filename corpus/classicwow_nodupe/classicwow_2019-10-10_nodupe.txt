Do chance on hit weapons proc for druids in bear and cat form?
---
---
---
Yep tell the new guy to go after the 1 raid slot per guild.
---
Implying DPS pulling threat is a tank issue in classic. Also "required skill and dedication" are you talking about getting a free mount at 20 or being one of 2 dps who can straight heal themselves (3 if you count ferals who have to shapeshift)?
---
Pre-prep? Woah.

Dragon knee pain???? Sounds painfull I'm somewhat of an expert in dragons if they need physio for it send them my way I've had dragons back to fully fit within 2 weeks.
---
I hate it when my dwarf says that. **YES YOU CAN.**
---
You just lost social credit you globalist.
---
Only if your server is low pop/dying will it be difficult to find groups. More gold in the game isnt a negative, if a stack of copper bars starts going for 3g or something, that then means newbies will have gold a lot earlier and thus it makes it that much easier to get their epic. There is no losing here.
---
kinda funny they we're calling you a no-life virgin for trying to do the same exact thing they were doing.
---
Wow yeah you've got close to full prebis+, nice.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So right off the bat I would say, like before, your #1 priority needs to be hit cap (which is 9% based on your current set up).
---
I would recommend NOT using Trueaim because you sacrifice too many other stats for 4% hit which isn't really necessary. You are already at 6% so it's kind of a waste at this point. I view Trueaim as much more of a starter 60 item, similar to Warmonger (3% hit 2h sword). There aren't any other stats besides hit so you should look at replacing them asap.
---
I would recommend thinking about respeccing MM/surv for surefooted. I'm not playing hunter in classic so I can't speak first hand on BM vs MM in MC right now. But from prior knowledge and watching hunter pets as a priest healer in MC currently, I would lean towards MM being better. Your pet is just gonna either die a lot or have to be micromanaged too much or be dismissed too often to really be effective in raids. So that basically makes your 17 points in BM pretty useless for raiding, whereas surv will give you some nice utility, survivability, and hit. Consider something like this for the spec (with some options of switching a few points around, specifically monster/humanoid slaying, survivalist, imp wc, few different options for these flex points I won't go into):
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZViohthtI0rroh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZViohthtI0rroh) 
---
This would allow you to maintain your current gear while using t1 legs and still reach hit cap. Your next priority should be a better weapon. The 11 agi on ancient bone bow is nice but the speed on it is not great for an ideal rotation. You should look for something slower, like around 3.2 speed, in order to smooth out your rotation until you can get the leaf from domo for the hunter epic bow.
---
Options for ranged weapon:
---
Blackcrow (Shadow hunter vhos'gajin in lbrs - 3.2 speed, 3 agi, 1 hit)
---
Carapace spine crossbow (Nerub'enkan in strat ud - 3.3 speed, 4 agi, 9 stam)
---
Both are great options. Blackcrow would give you the option of moving 1 point from surefooted into IAOTH again or dropping the hit from other gear. I'm blanking on alternative options currently so you can do a bit of research for yourself on this one, but possibly try switching to Beaststalker's bindings which will double your agi if you don't need the extra hit in that slot. There might be a belt with higher agi to get instead which would give comparable RAP plus crit (1 agi = 2 RAP and \~0.02% crit). Those would probably be the only pieces here that I would try switching. Everything else appears to be the best you can get in their respective slots.
---
Content is irrelevant if the basic game mechanics are broken...  For me at least
---
This is an MMORPG. Things like this should be expected and encouraged (in moderation).
---
A Good Boomkin set bonus would be "your innervate now also casts on you when you cast it on another player" or "Moonkin form also allows x percent off mana regeneration to contribute y while in combat"
---
no
---
I never said otherwise lol, but I just checked the 15 top fury warrior parses and they all had windfury, so let's not act like it's close. Also, it's not like Alliance get nothing, sword racial+pally buffs and every top parse is still horde? K.
---
I have a 57 Priest and I had such an easier time on her than my warlock. Use spirit tap/wand spec, and then rest in shadow and leveling is a breeze. Give it a few more levels since at 12 most classes are squishy, and keep investing in the best wands you can find on the AH, it’s your main damage output.
---
Except the Lúthien they’re both likely referencing actually has a special character in it!
---
The story... Your guildmates needed you to down the unholy bastard Nathanos, atop his hill in EPL.
---
You died mid fight, only to get disconnected seconds later and you decide to relax the reat of the night before heading to bed.
---
Next day you sign in to remember your lifeleas corpse sitting stop that hill. You make the walk of shame and find him sitting atop your corpse laughing at you.
---
 Knowing you cannot recover your corpse without dying again you decide to go play an alt.. Leaving your corpse to wither in the corruption of EPL.
---
Soon your alt is level 60 and raiding that exact spot.. You think.. Ill get my toon out of here as soon as thr blightcaller falls.
---
Little do you know, your lifeless corpse has fallen to the corruption, but luckily your soul was saved. Too late, you've been forgotten as you lay there lifeless. Youve become what you swore to destroy.. You are... Forsaken.
---
And again, congats. Truth be told I am a bit envious and that plays into me being annoyed.
---
Can’t forgive Renault for killing his dad. OG Ashbringer would’ve conquered the world.
---
Just adding my bit to what others have said - I have just cancelled my subscription, specifically citing this issue in my feedback.
---
I am sorry it has come to this - I have been looking forward to classic for ages, and have been enjoying playing it very much, but I cannot financially support a company that acts as a censoring agent on behalf of the Chinese government.
---
Missed this feature somehow, this does it thanks
---
"Here comes the pain bitch!!!"
---
Classic items feel more like randomly generated bullshit than retail, how else do you explain the senseless itemization
---
 Reserve these balls in your mouth. Ain’t no one joining that except newbs who don’t know what R orb is.
---
Very rich, raid and have fun on my Rogue.
---
Yet I get urge to try Warlock. Talk me into/out of it. Main reason I didn't pick it was: drinking/mana management is annoying. Pets are annoying to deal with. Bag management seems annoying.
---
Pros: More useful in raids and dungeons. Looks cool. Strong in PvP.
---
Some low level content like Duskwood Scythe of Elune chain is missing as well.
---
Honestly I'd like to see Classic+ where the level cap is extended to 65/70, zones are rebalanced around that fact, more quests and more zones filled out (Hyjal, Gilneas, along with your aforementioned Azshara and Winterspring) and with TBC's class balances. But don't tell this subreddit that or else the #nochanges cultists will downvote you to death.
---
can only hold 1
---
I met Graybeard questing in STV then ended up doing ZF with them. Solid bunch!
---
Right. Equality means sluttiness for everyone!
---
Meanwhile us hard working grunts slaving away in the AH trying to pay for a mount disgusting

---
No it isn't, I get downvoted massively everytime I even so much as suggest that some talent trees should be rebalanced.
---
The issue if they do Classic+ is the phase you forgot, phase 0. That's the one where they monetize the shit out of it. Then they'll churn out as much garbage as they can so you buy loot boxes, heirloom items, and super flashy cosmetics. 
---
The game will become a retail clone and 14 years later, everyone will want Classic Classic. And I'll say, "You think you do, but you don't", because history repeats itself.
---
Is there a post like this for warlocks?
---
Jebaited
---
Only mc and ony out. So those are the only non private server facts available right now.
---
And vanilla facts are useless, as we are at 1.12 talents from start, so all posts from before 1.12 don't apply to classic about feral tanking.
---
And I thought DKP was rough.
---
Its a chest piece crafted with 300 tailoring recipe is dropped from LBRS by firebrand pyromancer or u can buy the recipe from AH but the robe itself is BOP on craft materials will be very expensive especially essence of water due to diremaul so prepare to farm alooot for it

If you prefer it in text form, the lazy goldmaker guides are quite good to get going quickly. Samadan's voice is just soooo relaxing though it's nice to just have his stuff on in the background and set shit up when you feel like it and just absorb some knowledge otherwise lol.
---
https://thelazygoldmaker.com/category/tsm4-guide
---
Thanks, been saving up my cloth thing I had loads, still need 99 stacks of various cloth just to level tailoring, going to take a while.
---
Gz!
---
So, any tips for us who want to do this?
---
Right? We asked for sexy Whitemane, not this touching moment nonsense.
---
Are you dual wield tanking?
---
If you're looking with a magnifying glass at the system then yes, that's a potential flaw. But any guild with proper leadership will see that and address it. Besides, we all know EXACLTY what is coming in the future, so by that logic people could just wait until AQ40/Naxx to spend points.
---
No system is perfect, they all rely on good leadership in the guild/raids to be well run.
---
Tried this before and it didn't work, if it is now working it's the update everyone is talking about which seems to indicate this is now automatic.
---
Jokes aside, for anyone who actually has difficulty with rogues: They can't dodge a grenade to the face and they can't stun you while you're fapping.
---
Also Guildrecruitment is official as well, available in capital cities like the trade chat.
---
I was sarcastic.
---
What would the limit accomplish? This isn't a big deal.
---
Damn hate to tell you but skinning is ruining your theroy
---
Yeah, but their argument relies on not being able to interpret context and make a basic inference into the meaning of what is being said. So that person is stupid.
---
Never pictured huan having black and white stripes
---
OMG this is awesome :D since im a rogue, i need this!
---
Wait, the SM key does the Strath door as well? OR do they just look the same?
---
I think it's gone due to the new system. I remember making blizzard and rain of fire pretty ridiculous, but I'm not able to recreate it.
---
Please don’t. You make the healer’s life so much harder.
---
Wow a day later and I’m still not banned. Shows how much influence you have.
---
Side note: You should get your raging tendencies checked out professionally.
---
The statue is nice but I wish the colors were original rag tbh
---
Any mana spent at all means five seconds of no (or reduced) spirit regen.
---
Let them feel special thst they are playing the "hard" version of wow. I already gave up on them after the first week of the classic beta.
---
I *am* the danger!
---
I run a 2hander fury build and love it. Mix it with some high agility gear and you can get a solid high crit rate going, which just sort of gets out of control with Flurry and Whirlwind.
---
If you just want to raise the skill you can literally do it anywhere including SW. It's not based on the zone for skill up.
---
Horde actually get a number of quests here, including tons of blackrock mountain quests at higher levels. Their town Kargath is a very popular hearthstone spot and meeting place for lvl 60s due to it being the closest inn to blackrock mountain.
---
It only buffs like every 6 hr tho
---
Big, if true
---
Retail is basically single player game. You can do almost everything alone instead of Raids and Dungeons where you can group with finders which are almost like single player cause they require 0 interaction.
---
This could be fixed quite easily with a codpiece equipment slot.
---
And neither does yours. I shall continue to grief and continue to not get banned.
---
Sell bags, flip recipes, camp patterns that are limited and resell for x30 profit, scour auction house for items you have researched that sell/move quickly (grilled squid, nightfin soup, rune thread) you’d be so surprised that certain vendor items sell for double on the AH
---
Don’t care about the level, more about the number of potential spots and types of fish!
---
I’m on Bigglesworth NA.  I sell multiple greens daily.  Currently in the level 15 - 20 range.
---
wow its almost as if esfand doesnt want drama in his chat about a political topic. who would've guessed?
---
Nice, another AUX masterrace
---
Low effort best effort!
---
They can’t predict how public perception growing tired of China will destroy the market in the west though.  I doubt they realized this would grow this big, I’m betting they apologize and pull out or risk tanking their businesses.  It’s getting less and less lucrative.
---
Then again, imagine being stuck as a paladin lol.
---
I couldn't disagree more. I feel like I'm hitting with a pool noodle.
---
^ he knows
---
Exactly this. With loot council, every piece of gear is (theoretically) going to the best possible recipient so it increases raid-wide DPS the most. With DKP as a hunter you bet your ass I’m saving my DKP for those rhok’delar items and even if something is an upgrade for me I’m not using my points on it.
---
There’s a reason why every single top guild uses loot council and not DKP
---
Yea, read the thread. Like 3 links already.
---
Cool dude you like anime, good to know.
---
Well...yeah...but you have to actually have the knowledge and patience to do it.
---
Clearly different in the US compared to how they organise themselves the UK.
---
&gt;functionally a taunt
---
But he's not wrong. Have you ever seen someone earth shock in a group? It's threat ratio is so high it never will leave you below anyone else.
---
Strange thing, this actually destroys my FPS in game, from 144 down to 60.  Any guesses why?
---
You're here aren't you? lol
---
It's linked in the article.
---
Go back to BfA
---
Oh well
---
Seconding the Warlock. They also have amazing flexibility in their talent specs after \~40. It all starts with a core set of Affliction talents, but really opens up beyond that. You can keep going HAM into Affliction, or branch out into Demo/Destro for the flashy abilities. Pick up Engineering on top of all that and you can basically decide, at will, how tryhard or casual you want to handle the day. 
---
Plus, ending the fight with more hp/mana than you started never really gets old.
---
Just cause you don't get the joke doesn't make it a lie, lol
---
I knew some people would "place the blame" on me. It's okay..however, i have a 60 Warrior and a 44 Shaman.
---
I will re-roll most likely, but i would hate to lose all that progress.
---
Mage, Priest or Druid?
---
I've leveled these three chars up to 10 and can't really decide which one I'm focusing in... I like casters but they all have pros and cons... I'm more of a DPS guy so I like Shadow Priest, which raid groups think it's useless in late game... Mage is nice but the bandwagon effect makes me want to avoid it a bit. Druid is really fun but it has the same fate as Priest... Raid groups demands...
---
I'm leaning more towards Druid because of the versatility but I've never leveled either one of them to max level so I don't really know what is like to play with them at 40-60...
---
What are your thoughts?
---
Name unavailable. The reason for nearly all special characters in names.
---
Zero chance this belongs in /thathappened
---
EP/GP with decay system allows new ppl to generally start getting loot by the 2nd week. You wont get the big ticket items ( bene, t2, etc ) but that seems fair to me imo.
---
If they said nothing at the start of the run to tell you that they have dibs and if youre okay for that.
---
You have nothing to feel bad about, it is a bis trinket and you need it. That's it.
---
I saw him once but was severely underleveled and didn't dare fight him, congrats!!!!
---
Adding the ability to sort by buyout price in the vanilla UI would probably be an easier fix.  It's that glaring omission that makes it profitable to post 1c minimum bids.  And really, all that profit is just people paying you for the privilege of not using an AH addon.
---
Wand "of frozen wrath" with 13 frost damage
---
Robe of the archmage - 300 Tailoring chest
---
Arcanist bindings - Mage tier bracers, boe drop from MC 
---
all 3 are BIS items
---
I want to quit as well but I'm addicted
---
&gt;just thought he was another rare
---
Rares in Classic, unlike in Retail, are actually Rare (Lost Soul and Tormented Spirit excluded).
---
More like miss miss miss miss Dodge miss miss miss party miss miss
---
I don't have a screenshot because I opted for bed, but I did get a notification saying something about a GM review.
---
Give people time to enjoy the content man. The majority of people aren’t even 60 yet. Just because you no life’s through the game and are bored doesn’t mean other people are. 
---
You knew this would be the case from the start and brought it upon yourself.
---
I'm from the old school mindset of roll need if you need. Don't be greedy of course, but if there's a great drop for you then go for it.
---
Because it costs a substantial amount of money to buy food/water ahead of time.
---
You did nothing wrong. You had need so you needed on the item. Just because someone else ran the dungeon 100 times already doesn't mean you owe him any loot. It was a fair roll and you won.
---
Warriors can MT every boss.  Ferals probably should not MT every boss.  Ferals have a place in the tanking heirarchy, and do much better damage than a prot warrior who's not currently tanking, along with having other utility.  
---
Are you trying to be guild MT?  If so, then go warrior.  If you want to be a tank in the guild, pick whichever.
---
It was the norm in the genre, FFXI had XP/level loss, too.
---
Err...no sell value, anyway.  Sometimes enchanting supplies vendors near trainers will have 1 or 2 strange dust or magic essence and that does cost.
---
It's pretty fun if you got axe spec and two axes.
---
The addon I have that tells me where an item drops from is called BiS Tracker.
---
Don't use claw. All it does is drain your pets bar for a tiny amount of extra dps, which means they cant growl or bite on cooldown. Threat generation isnt only based off of dps. It's those harder hitting slower hits that generate more threat. Bite+Growl is way more effective, and your pet will never be drained of their resource.
---
This was hilarious for 11 seconds.
---
Try:
---
"Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?"
---
cut
---
Guy swinging "hruuhh!"
---
end of swing on boar
---
boar dies
---
Yeah if you don’t like Padres trousers on a pally then f u! But really I don’t see what is so bad about it it’s better than every pally ever just mogging the judgement set. At least now you can actually wear it
---
I mean it's absolutely obvious that windfury adds a ton, but alliance warriors are still beating all other alliance DPS. Warriors are the best DPS.
---
I'm pretty sure lewding corpses is illegal.
---
You did nothing wrong. You need it just as much as they do.
---
If you don’t like don’t watch.  What’s your deal?
---
And pray your internet doesn't drop for 16 minutes.
---
Most of which are almost never worth farming for. They have a chance to drop, then you're basically just rolling out of 14 other enchants.

Yeh it's always the beta guys like him that do fucked up shit with girls who have had  one too many

Nah. Just curious to what the community thinks. We've got two feral druids tanking our clears atm. Warrior will obviously be MT once he gets gear

I've noticed this before, I've always assumed it's an easter egg referring to Star wars ep. 1, where a pod racer crashes. It would explain the two lines that the vehicles basically make. That, and it's in a desert which tanaris has many similarities to.
---
I have no suggestions unfortunately. I'm struggling to find people to play with as well. I'm already level 60 and my 2 IRL mates will be 60 by the end of the week.
---
We do dungeons together but the constant need for 2 random members keep forcing you to fight for potential rare bis drops which is so annoying. Not to mention the fact that most players are so bad that they end up hurting our group instead of making it go faster. The biggest issue I encounter is when I los pull or a pug member that isn't level 60 keeps stay on top of me when pulling back the pack of mobs.
---
And finding a decent guild seems impossible atm. Either the guilds are hardcore raiding +3 days a week or it lacks leadership who puts in the work to setup a functioning raid guild.
---
All though I've cleared 8/10 MC for three weeks and Onyxia twice I can't say I'm enjoying it all that much because of all the pugs. We legit had a lock unable to move 10 yards from his allies in 10 seconds when he was targeted by living bomb on Baron Geddon.
---
It seems a lot of people are taking breaks/quitting so if I were you I'd just enjoy the solo questing and run some dungeons when you can find a group. Finding people to play with will hopefully get better around christmas again.
---
When I was 39 I healed ZF on my resto Druid, super low but I’m a competent player. When the witch dr dropped his staff I passed on it to the lvl 45 mage because it was just as big of an upgrade for him and I couldn’t use it at 39.... plus, knowing I’d run ZF probably 20 more times before I out leveled it gave me some reassurance I’d probably see the staff again. 
---
I can’t tell you how to feel or how to react, I’m just sharing a similar situation. I was happy to be in a group that was semi fast in clearing the dungeon and getting the exp to level.
---
Your windfury totem doesn't stack with rockbiter. If you have rockbiter on your weapon, you're only getting the benefit from rockbiter, no windfury.
---
In groups, unless you're tanking for some reason, you should put windfury on your weapon (the self-cast one, it's better than the version you get from the totem). Rockbiter shouldn't be used in groups because it causes additional aggro, meaning it's easier for you to pull enemies off the tank.
---
You are so cool dude.
---
I initially wanted to play straight dps , but almost every single LFG is looking for a tank haha!
---
Yes?
---
why doesnt he reset once he has traveled a certain distance from where you pulled him like regular mobs?
---
I really don't get it, do they want people to have a miserable time trying to invite them or send them mail?
---
I guess I get it for pvp, especially since it would be impossible for me to type out /tar âśśśĺáýéŕ, although I really don't think they should be allowed for that very reason.
---
Heh. Grats regardless. Time to add to the list!
---
Congrats!!

I mean my guildies and I gamble a bit for fun like playing blackjack macro's, I see that as pretty harmless. But to flat out say if you don't gamble don't bother raiding because you won't be allowed to roll is the fastest /gquit in the west
---
Fuck those guys. You did the run just like them. You deserve it also.
---
🔥🔥SHOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥
---
I lol'd pretty hard at this
---
Holy heck, thanks for the link! That was awesome to look through, especially since I never had time to pay that close of attention to the various tracks and remains in Tanaris (busy trying not to die myself, haha).
---
Again, if you have mc on farm you’re not pugging and are decent geared
---
i agree, i plan on pvping alot and i dont want to deal with the shitty aspects of the pally mount just because it looks cool
---
&gt;You get more attack power from dual wielding
---
Ahhh, now *that* makes sense.  Which is probably why Bloodthirst is based on AP and not weapon damage!
---
It's more of a thing in end game dungeons. Leather is bis for a few warrior slots.
---
Wet daydream
---
Lol right
---
Then you see “sodaboy”... lol
---
If you dont get any loot for weeks, even when things drop, you are in a bad guild and need to leave.
---
Yeah I'm taking that name
---
What do you mean regarding this spec?
---
Yeeeaaa, at first I though, hey, they forgot to change the voice line over, and then... oh... oooooooh, I get it.
---
hahaha yes, im so pumped for the new season start this saturday.
---
Yeah, it's really sweet what those hate filled genocidal fanatical extremist maniacs feel for each other :p
---
Imagine being "stuck" as a holy paladin from level 10. D: ^(Just too get into groups without paying to respec.)
---
True
---
I was going to ask for one but I regret not putting this out there to show people what one of the most popular twitch streamers on classic wow thinks is cool.
---
Yeah same with Karazan sewers. Amazing zone, really interesting layout, would have been really interesting if they filled it out!
---
Do you read the manga or anime only?
---
I mean everything auto fills, so it's not that big a deal these days.  It was much more annoying back when you actually had to character map it.
---
I'm leveling my third warrior to 40 and here's what I can conclude: 
---
* Cruelty is the best talent a warrior can get
---
* Rend is absolute trash and you shouldn't even purchase rank 2 or above until you're either rich or 60 or both.
---
* Heroic Srike is absolute trash and you should only purchase rank 2, until you're either rich or 60 or both.
---
* Demoralizing Shout is amazing and it should be applied to every mob as soon as possible.
---
* Dumping all rage into Sunder Armor yields more damage per second benefit than Heroic Strike/Rend. This goes for even the weakest mobs.
---
* Booming Voice makes you almost instantly win vs. Rogues.
---
* Piercing Howl makes you destroy everyone in PvP, including mages.
---
* Blood Craze really isn't that bad when you compare it to 15% of Battle Shout attack power.
---
* Death Wish is so good, makes you insta-win vs. Warlocks, makes taking out elites a piece of cake.
---
* I slightly miss Tactical Mastery but not enough to waste 2 or 5 points into it and all the crapped talents in the Arms tree like Improved Rend.
---
* Respec to Arms at 40 because Bloodthirst doesn't scale with weapon damage. It's poop.
---
* Sword of Serenity/Omen &amp; Vanquisher's Sword &amp; Thrash Blade are all dual wield fury traps. Don't do it. Just use them for Sword &amp; Board.
---
My alliance side warrior bought Killmaim at 21 by selling copper ore. Got it enchanted at 25.
---

Some bank alt on my server posted 235 single listings of wool cloth.

I’m so glad I use Aux
---
Pretty sure they could see it being deployed.  I dropped it once in a raid while we were running back to our bodies around a corner once after a wipe.  I thought it would lighten  the mood when people started doing train noises.  It was nowhere near the boss and we were WELL out of range for the fight.  The GM messaged me and threatened to boot me for it...apparently he was not amused.

wat
---
classic has the worst itemization of every expansion
---
There's a reason why fury warriors wear 50% leather bis
---
Healing paladins in cloth
---
Mages and warlocks wearing easy to craft tailoring gear, and greens over tier 2 raid gear
---
What did u just do rn? Came and complained lmfao! Wtf!?!
---
I always go there with levitate way easier than doing precise jumps
---
I regret not clipping it. Don’t these streamers save all there previous streams? I could look.
---
Thank you, I will check out the site. If I begin to take here I’ll happily delete the post. Definitely don’t intend to disrupt of piss people off for little to no reason. Guess multiboxing is a grey area.

How I totally forgot about that!

mcdono aint made with Wonderbread...

On AH from an alt. If it doesn't sell he has to vendor the equipped one, repost the one in the mail and buy back the one he vendored.

Chill. I was just clarifying what the comment about “lost me at rouge” - by someone else - meant since he didn’t seem to understand. You read too much into it. I never attacked the guy, just explained.
---
That and the junk uniques add up to more useful things than just gold, honestly gold is one of the worst things in tropes of gaming.  PoE's 'gold' can actually be used to do things with and not just a gate-keeping mechanic.
---
How did you find him if he was invincible?
---
I am strongly opposed to 41-point talent trees if we only have 51 (or even 61) points to spend. I like the freedom of being able to put the last 39% of my talents wherever I want and I don't want to see that percentage decreasing.
---
Oh not saying you do. But people generally do so if it happens, stick up for the healer and be like yeah, not his fault. He’s used to shields, etc. just don’t leave him to take any anger if it happens.
---
Did you make the changes outlined here?

Addons?

&gt;breaking people's immersion
---
literally only a rule on RP servers.
---
I’m only at 50 but as others said drain tanking is the way to go. Check out the warlock classic discord there is an insane amount of resources.
---
TLDR: you have to do some certain amount of damage to the dragons for Test of Skulls or the skulls might not drop. This especially sucks for healers.
---
Seriously. If I ever die to this I'll probably laugh all the way back to my corpse.
---
have fun tanking with a one hander at this level.
---
yea i guess i could have two macros and swap them back and forth, that’s a decent solution
---
Should have frost shocked bud
---
Not 100% sure, but try "/e dance" instead of just "/dance". From my understanding it does the emote without announcement
---
I haven’t lost a world encounter yet on my frost mage. In fact...  a warlock / hunter combo tried to gank me in stv (same level) so I sheeped the Hunter, nova’d his let away from me, blocked the locks Dots and counter spelled his fear and killed him, re sheeped the hunter and killed his pet to make a point, and killed the hunter. Frost mages are amazing if you learn to prioritize your abilities and ALWAYS have a mana jade available.
---
no way you can keep aggro wth a one hander at this level.
---
Warlock. Shadow priest or Druid for pvp? I like the attrition play style. Can’t decide on which one! Sell me on the class
---
I have a tailor name , Lacoste, and I often go out in lowbie zone to give bag/shirt. 
---
Yeah, I'm this bored already.
---
I love the tank shortage!
---
^(This post was made by pally and druid tank gang)
---
[This list](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Fishing_locations) is useful. Go to an area where you know you have 100% catch rate. I think the types of fish they list is slightly inaccurate though, but should be fine for the most part.
---
you realize you're posting in a thread where this guy got banned for this for multiple days right?
---
It’s not your job to hold threat against trigger happy AOE mages. It’s the dps role not to attack until initial threat is achieved. 2H tanking is only a good idea when the healer and tank are especially well geared.
---
why did you do that?
---
You should see my pants
---
If the company running this game takes a terrible political stance there's a big difference between that and shouting political memes.
---
IMO keep your *me ne frego* to yourself. It's more harmful in the long run.
---
Canceled my sub due to this.  Fuck you blizzard.
---
Top one is Atlasloot. Not sure about the others.
---
You’re not supposed to, unless that has changed in recent years. Personally, I don’t care anymore 99% of the time. Unless that person is trying to get mail/invites from me, at which point they are SOL. I’m not trying to figure out what special character(s) your name has.
---
On retail I stopped caring because, at a certain point, it starts becoming a chore to make a new character. I would find myself spending an hour+ just trying to think of an original name. I can understand the appeal of just using a special character in the name and going on your way.
---
Get it in your thick skull. You are NOT MEANT TO. Towns are meant to be a safe zone. Unless you can kill them in fair combat while being attacked by guards, you're exploiting.
---
It's basically a simple question.
---
Do you want to be a shitty arsehole that makes your healer's life harder ?
---
Grats!
---
2h PvP. cuz burst. dw pve,cuz moars.

I really hate them too.

What the fuck? Is it possible to downvote this 85 times to get it away from the top?
---
For Druids, our weapons are stat sticks. We get the benefit of "+X stat", but not "on hit"
---
Magnificent.

A guy walked up to me shouting 'I'm a teepee, I'm a wigwam, I'm a teepee, I'm a wigwam!'

I usually be a smart ass and /say sorry to point it out but i think you made a typo in your name there buddy

Are u actually crying?
---
Don’t forget you also have fire ward
---
Could you give me a TL;DR since imgur is basically in viewable on (my) mobile?
---
I think it's more confusing, any non-cloth healer is almost a hunter rolling for stats than gear that is designed for them.
---
The WF you get anyway with a resto so I guess it really depends on if the other dps is good enough that the small increases enhance gives outweighs the dps loss from the enhance shaman.  For what it's worth I dont care what people play and if someone's guild is fine with them playing enhance then that is all that matters.
---
Lost the roll for ravager 14 times....
---
both
---
PoE has probably the best original idea for a currency economy that Ive played in decades. Everything has value beyond the arbitrary "value" it's assigned.
---
Did he use 1 math or multiple maths though?
---
STOP DOING IT THEN. Fight people fair and square you spineless coward.
---
Hit rating and RNG outcomes are inversely related.
---
Whether it pays off or not is up to the gods
---
Because if you press the "Need" button, you're a greedy selfish person!
---
&gt; That is yet to be determined.
---
To be fair, the way his comment is worded makes it 100% true. He is *not* saying retail makes more money. He is simply saying we don't know which makes more money.
---
It's on a hunter though
---
You don't need to swap the macros back and forth, just add it to another slot in your action bars.
---
That's not a problem that's just a part of properly setting up your market operations.
---
That's what's great about TSM but also makes it harder to use and learn.
---
As silly as it sounds, I'm trying to reconcile the class fantasy of a Paladin with the fact that I'll be wearing a dress end-game. How do you guys who care about class fantasy think about it?
---
Because this isn’t retail.
---
Obviously I'm crying in my bed alone right now how can you not know that

I don't get why people downvote posts asking for help and advice :\

That’s really awesome.  I know it’s been said too many times, but this game is so amazing.  The world they created continues to amaze me after all these years.
---
I never got roleplay but one question i always had was like, if they do it with undead do they comment on them being rotting corpses and needing the aid of certain lubrication products? Do they try and be anatomically correct and talk about tauren teets and milk and stuff?
---
I’ve died to Teremus the Devourer in Stormwind Canals for some reason this week, and I’ve gotten more made about level 60s killing me while questing and making me run across the entirety of STV and Searing Gorge. I laughed and took pics of Teremus killing players in the canals.
---
How about we can kill the same 'super evil bad guy' an almost infinite number of times?
---
The whole game is a farce!
---
Do you also replace all possible stats with +dodge ?
---
&gt;It’s not your job to hold threat against trigger happy AOE mages.
---
If you don't drop in with a threat lead it's much worse than that: the healer gets aggro.
---
The thing about healers is that they're just like warriors in the sense that they generate more threat when they have aggro as they heal themselves up and with the sole exception of paladins, take more damage per attack than a warrior who isn't wearing a shield.
---
Gold from quests scales insanely well after 40, keep going on and you'll be back to 100g in a few levels
---
sometimes, statements are veiled as jokes
---
Not upset, why’d you delete the post?
---
That would be the exception, not the norm. Also, when you go 2hander that dps playstyle isn't a problem since you are dealing enough dmg as tank to keep the mobs on you. Mitigation isn't all that important until 50+. Tanked up until temple with a 2hander and it wasn't nearly as stressful as having to taunt on cool down
---
Roll a human mage.
---
Crazy that we’re at the point where this sub defends classics itemization, which is quite literally one of the most obviously flawed aspects of the game.
---
Forgive me for being a noob, but what does it do exactly ?
---
I suppose it was the attacks that drove the average latency above the threshold where TTL=64 was acceptable, then. Makes sense.
---
Haha that’s actually pretty cool.
---
The ungoro demon is bugged. The dog shouldn’t reset.
---
2h Fury is great especially when you are starting a new raid tier. Even with Ret Paladins on the Alliance, you’re getting these stupid good 2H weapons like The Untamed Blade and BRE that just wont be used in raid without 2h Fury. Also, they are amazing for gearing up your other Dual Wielders when you are getting Hit gear, since they can get by with so much less Hit.
---
Eventually you’ll want to swap, but if I was a raid leader I’d be totally on board keeping one or two of my Warriors with 2handers just because of the gear diversity
---
but why?
---
If you arent gonna tank on that warrior,  you will be wearing leather instead.. :p
---
Nice! I too have a pretty sweet Wanderer's set for my rogue.
---
judging by the pic.. one horse and some fire?
---
People have been doing that for years.
---
While I may agree with your sentiment...
---
Looking dope
---
I just went and handed one in. 11 Rep for it
---
I just got hit capped in my DW fury war. It's so awesome. Now, I'm chasin after that sweet crit and AP.
---
I whispered by a high level player who told me to mine somewhere else in Silverpine.
---
I would argue that Druids are actually the outright best dungeon tank.
---
As a horde player in classic, man I miss my Dwarven capital of ironforge
---
Personally I would like the developers to play into the hybrid nature of druids. I think it would be cool if Moonkin was a powerful but unsustainable form and the game incentivized switching to Cat or Bear form while waiting for your mana to regenerate.
---
Calling out someone’s mom cause you I told you not to get upset? Attacking my post? You need help bro and I’m not trying to give you life lessons right now. I had to repost cause it was to vulgar
---
I can do you one better:

---
I was so happy to hear they are releasing DM on the 15th when i spent this last weekend in maraudon getting my epic mount :))))
---
It is steganographically embedded in the image itself. It's a bit of code in the game client. However, if you paste the image from your clipboard into MS Paint and save it then you are fine.
---
I’m tired of it all too but this post is still gonna end up being taken down for politics
---
True, but 2 weapons with a 1,8 weapon speed attack 4 times before a 3.6 weapon speed. Even if you miss more, you’re getting more hits and dodges overall, which opens more overpower hits too
---
Dungeon, Stratholme
---
Agreed. People are outraged over a dude violating a contract he signed but theres a literal genocide attempt by Turkey right now in Syria and no one gives a shit. These people need to spare me with their faux outrage over inconsequential shit.
---
2h tanks do more damage, keep more threat so you don't have to heal the DPS that will inevitably pull.  As a healer, I'd rather just keep healing one target in a dungeon than the whole party.  The run will go faster this way as well.
---
Good riddance. You were exploiting and got banned.
---
If you're looking at your details/recount to see how often other people are missing you are likely just not getting accurate numbers.
---
Did they confirm they only missed 3% in their meter?
---
Don't warriors have moves that INCREASE damage taken? That could be why.
---
100, comes with a mouse pad, pin of onyxia’s head, 30 days of game time, and art work. It was a good unboxing everything was well put together, felt very VIP.
---
Might as well dive into Fury instead of going deep into Prot to be honest. Prot has all its survivability front loaded
---
Yes yes yes, your work is amazing.
---
We are getting close and closer to your grand masterpiece, Inquisitor Thiccmane blasting a party of 5 through the walls of the  cathedral with her massive toots
---
WORST?! What do you mean? That’s badass! Does it still work like this or is it somewhat nerfed like the dancing one?
---
Flurry is much easier to maintain 100% uptime and more efficient with DW. 2H is too slow to fully utilise the 3 hits of 30% increased attack speed and harder to keep the uptime.
---
Which is why they should just import the old maps into BFA and add a Chromie NPC you can talk to to be ported to the old world. If I could run all the old content in BFA and collect transmog, I'd have zero desire to even touch classic.
---
They could have saved themselves a lot of work if they had just done that instead of bothering with classic at all, honestly. Access to removed content is a large chunk of the appeal.
---
Fuck blizzard
---
&gt; The ungoro demon is bugged. The dog shouldn’t reset.
---
I don't feel bad about it because holy fuck the Silithus demon resets way too much.
---
Not really.  2h warrior will keep threat much better so you're not healing the entire party when they ultimately pull threat.
---
AHHHHAAAA YAY HEY
---
&gt; The entire point of Classic is to preserve 1.12, and Blizzard said they're going to host it no matter how unpopular it is. "Classic+" goes against the entire concept of Classic.
---
Why not both?
---
Is this a private server?
---
If youre the artsy type, thatd only take like 3 hours to paint his normal colors back on

Sick ass statue tho

Horde has some fugly cities.

Jimmothy in chat. What a chap, looking for a group and does even care what it is!
---
it's rare and looks great, and in this pic its wasted on a tauren...
---
do you read what I've wrote?, it's not the same because of the engine, may be texture wise, they can be copy/past, but they have to redone all the spells, simply, even they look alike, bosses on retail are not the same as they were on Vanilla.
---
I guess I'm confused, the title is "I was silenced in WoW" but after seeing other responses I guess he is talking about this WoW subreddit? Honestly, I've reread the post several times and I'm still not 100% on which he is talking about. Am I missing something?
---
Also, bloodthirst hits really hard for a one handed ability. It's like mortal strike, but one handed and self healing instead of heal reducing the enemy.
---
That's pretty much your answer right there, for the moment. Feral Druids are very gear-independant to a good degree, so they'll be the *preferred* tank in a lot of progression raiding until clears drop enough gear for the Warriors to surpass. And even still, I hear Druids are very viable off-tanks so you'll have your place regardless.
---
I got 4/5 in one run... Not that special
---
Well, he's gotta announce it somehow, since we don't get to watch him come ripping up in [his car](https://i.imgur.com/cQqBw7A_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) online...
---
This all day long
---
Go fuck yourself. The issue isn’t blizzard not fighting for people, but using their platform to censor political speech.
---
Yea his pathing for the fear was stupid. I was always feared directly out of range from him every time no matter how close or far I was. I just cheesed it with a curse of reck.
---
I bought mine at \~50g each on Fairbanks the day it was announced anticipating the spike. They sitting around \~70g each now lol. So all said and done mine will have costed \~700g with the mats + raw gold. Bit higher than anticipated but still get to keep an extra 200g.
---
true, which is why i recommended cruel barb for the attack power and 20, you can start using poison.
---
Dude what?
---
He was probably right-click report silenced in WoW by people that were tired of seeing this garbage posted everywhere.
---
So you're saying that Epic games will allow their players to break Chinese laws inside of a territory China considers its own? I highly doubt that. The fact that they, like everyone else is framing this as simply having a political opinion and not Blitz having broken Chinese law is just capitalizing on people's anger in order to get people playing their games. 
---
That's a bold claim they're making. Let's look for the date of their next event inside or China and see how much political speech they allow when it happens. 
---
It would appear that their world championship just took place, and they have no more tournaments scheduled in China for the year. 
---
When next year rolls around, we will see whether this was lip service, or not, considering tencent owns 40% of epic games, I would be really really surprised if it was anything more than lip service.
---
Arcane resistance ... ✓
---
Forced gambling is retarded. Donations should always be voluntary. Cant believe you actualy tried defending this shit behaviour.
---
Never mind the fact you could just have made every1 pay 10 gold instead of activily harming half your raid. Just terrible.
---
Remindme! 1 year
---
I just got one of those this morning while doing trash clears in ZF! Goes for 134g on Whitemane apparently. Trying to decide if I should sell now or wait for BGs and twinks.

If you aren't bad, Paladin should have very little to no downtime.

"Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD"
---
Blizzard gives themselves carte blanche to deny their champions their winnings.
---
This is what you're saying should be acceptable.

Fuck the political angle. You're a bad person.

AY'VE GOT THE BEST WIRES IN THE LAND!

So make world2. That was a quick mystery

Just said china in general chat. No mute

What if dodging caused threat generation... Makes logical sense, just like golfing, if I miss that ball, something goes sailing in its place..
---
Horde side, thousand needles
---
Can’t believe how often this stupid shit is perpetuated on reddit. In my entire years of playing as a warlock I’ve never once had anyone counter spell my fucking mount. It’s such a non issue.
---
Talk about niché
---
Blitzchung broke every fucking rule imaginable when it comes to being professional. He was in breach of contract. On a scale of 1-100, 1 being saying a curse word, he was a 100 in terms of being unprofessional.

Yes. The guards are supposed to aggro you anywhere in the city, if you find a spot to get around that then it can be considered exploiting - even though you're technically using in game mechanics
---
tf?
---
&gt; I think the most anyone can reasonably expect out of them without monetization
---
A subscription fee is monetization. And obviously they would start small and go from there. The guy who made that graph isn't *demanding* all that content be added. It's simply hypothetical.
---
It's a quest item for the epic priest quest for the benediction staff

I reached 24% hit as rogue in vanilla and it was cool not seeing a single miss anymore. Definitely not BIS though.

ITT: "I hate players with special characters!"  
---
You all are weird. Just learn to type.
---
Idk man, I've had 2 separate situations where a rogue opened up on me, stun locked as much as they could, use evasion, and still fail to kill me. The first was when I was lvl 38, the 2nd time at lvl 39. 
---
The first rogue died a glorious death when I crit him twice then finished him off 2 swings later. The 2nd rogue pussied out and vanished, only for me to find them later and settle the score.
---
I've mained a mage for most of my wow experience and this is my first time leveling a warrior past 10, having a blast with it, too!
---
You are the first one to ever say this
---
You can scale it! I prefer smaller Ui's
---
So your idea of minimal is to just make everything tiny?
---
I'll give a full list once I'm home from work.
---
It gets better. Get a wand if you don’t have one already. Your first 10 talent points NEED to go into wand specialization and spirit tap. There are level brackets where spriest is crazy and there are some where it is trash. Pvp is awful until you hit 41 then you should respec and get shadowform and dominate. (Btw you’re still a better healer than other classes even if you only take shadow talents.)
---
You’ll get paid someday. You don’t have to be that angry with the world.
---
i think the lack of rez (1 per 30 mins) in 5 mans is a problem for a lot of players,  they must die a lot to need more i guess, but when it comes to raiding i dont have stats, but pretty sure they come in last in "raw healing output" but who else is gonna innervate the priest or b-rez the dps warrior who stands in bad stuff, or off tank when something goes wrong till the real tank recovers etc etc, we are a utility class and need to accept or place in the meta.
---
Not at all. Everything has been replugged.
---
For more context, horde can go 2h fury because rather can spam hamstring to fish for wf pros which makes it decent if you have a really good wh weapon and you don't have a lot of hit gear.
---
Though tbh it'd have to be like the difference between you having thrash and morahs for dw and getting a oeb off rag for 2h fury to be better with the current crafted hear we have available.
---
2h fury with BRE. guy in my guild got it a couple days ago. it's fucking ridiculous. 800dps, and his other gear is blues from 5mans. He got HoJ like an hour ago.
---
Yeah, vanilla as possible is not in the corners of a 16:9 display.
---
You want to move them in to where they would have been on a 4:3 display at least. Where they're more readable.
---
There’s a Red Wyrmkin in the log, could your damage have been against it rather than Aztrox?
---
Just so you know, in real life you most certainly can cancel an auction if it's too low.
---
Source: I work for an auction company.
---
Your nemesis seems to have been AFK for a long time
---
Go smack rats in the tram. That's how I always leveled up weapon skill back when I was alliance.
---
Yeah that's what I was saying, even most mythics, and mythic+ under 5 you don't really need to talk/plan
---
Yeah but overpower just does weapon damage so in an extended fight it doesn’t make as much of a difference.
---
Yep, to me WOTLK is the pinnacle of WOW, the absolute best the game ever was. And I played from late vanilla.
---
I take it I'm not. I'm new to the sub and would there really be any content if discussion topics were only used once?
---
Actually, I live in Kansas City, but the fake outrage is annoying and has no place here. It's just virtue-signaling and while I may not agree with the politics involved (I'm not going to get into that because this isn't a place for political discussion), I agree with Blizzard's decision in punishing the person that violated their contract by using Blizzard's stream to promote a political opinion.
---
Damage causes threat at a 1:1 ratio. Defensive stance causes each point of damage to generate 0.45 additional threat, or effectively 1.45 damage. Spell damage scaling for the noted items brings the item's damage above the *effective* 1.45 "damage" warriors do, while actually also doing more damage.
---
Is that spelled out clearly enough for you now..?
---
You’re assuming classes should be wearing a specific armor type. That wasn’t true in classic.
---
Cover your chiseled chesticles!!
---
TANKS EVERYWHERE HATE HIM
---
The Area 51 Raid really fell apart when they couldn't find a tank and a healer.
---
That’s for all the input guys!!
---
I did it similarly, I aimed for 1g20 per stack, but would go as high as 1g50. I just cleaned out the AH every day until I had enough.
---
Also there’s a Detroit vs Chicago guild on my server you should probably reroll
---
 I noticed people like you often have a tough time getting any recruits quickly, Much less geared 60s. It’s funny you do this for minimum wage gold per hour. Have you actually done some math? I’m betting it’s like 20g - 30g a hour. Make sure to include the time spent spamming LFG for your next newb ok?
---
no belly shirts at work
---
Then don’t sign a contract you are going to break?
---
I never even actually did the Ungoro one way back when. 
---
I was grouped with another hunter and we were going to take turns at the demon there. I watched and they killed her, but it bugged and didn’t drop the head for them, but dropped for me instead. I felt so fucking bad lol. 
---
Lesson learned though, if you’re doing it in a group make sure you have free for all on.
---
I remember doing the one in Silithus, and I realized at the end I didn’t have it on free for all, and as I killed him I freaked out and ran to the corpse and like screamed because the head was there and just took off, leaving my poor warlock friend to die by all his bugs lol
---
&gt;What I gather from wowhead, the reduced quantity are a simplification in TBC.
---
The first one was still required in TBC, I remember farming all the brilliant shards.
---
I had such a person during WC run. He was the first one to die, caused our healer to go oom and blamed everyone. Although I told him I am knew to this dungeon and he agreed to show the way, he never told me anything and didn't give any directions.
---
So far we did every 60 dungeon with 2h tank or dw fury in my guild if there’s no tank available.
---
It's not a grey area. You are allowed to do it. I suggest getting autohot key or hotkey net, look for wow specific scripts, and when you are more advanced, get isboxer.
---
This is a clear bug. That GM response is nonsense.
---
Oh nice. What’s the statue made of? The quality looks super detailed.
---
This is true. Resilence was a bad idea designed to fix a problem that didn't exist. Honestly, for dedicated pvp modes (battlegrounds, arenas) I feel like there should be an option for no outside gear, where you get just basic  equivalent gear and pvp becomes purely skill based.
---
Thats still better than some friend, keep trying
---
I think you mean namesis
---
Nah your fine, people are just salty because they are too lazy or cheap to set up a multibox OR they have been ganked a couple of times. Thing is tho it's really easy to kill most boxers so I never really have an issue

The hands are kind of tiny for the big orc :P
---
This is incorrect, i received mine for the succubus.  They also supposedly have a higher drop rate.
---
If warriors/rogues use it against you, the best line of play is sheep and reset
---
There is an additional fee but it depends on the item.
---
Paladins cant farm effectively rly. Best healers in nax. Some growing pains till AQ. Priests are solid all game and farm trash well in DM.
---
You are right, I didn't realize :) thanks
---
&gt; saved 500g
---
&gt; 6x Arcanite Bar
---
Hmm...
---
Have you noticed funky aggro stuff going down in classic?  
---
It seems like I get chased down by grey tagged mobs fairly often based solely on proximity.  I noticed it especially last night while aoe grinding pirates with someone in Tanaris when several of our large pulls changed target en masse to nearby players simply minding their own business.
---
Yeah, the GMs as of late will just find any reason they can not to anything. Refused to help me with a ninja looter situation even when I had provided screenshots with the date and timestamps.
---
 People exaggerate how hard warrior is. I had a 60 war in vanilla. Maybe these people want to feel "brave".
---
I've just been questing and farming 5 mans. Had my mount at 40, had my epic mount only a few days after hitting 60, and have over 500g with all bank slots purchased and Armoursmithing levelled to 300. I haven't sold any ore I've mined, and I haven't really done any gold farming/AH play.
---
As a 60 warlock that’s great and all but no ones said how awesome it is to fear the opposing faction into mobs...
---
Aye
---
This is the exact reason I chose not to reroll as a pally this time in classic
---
Looking for a leveling/raiding guild on **Benediction**. Currently a **30 warrior**. Planning on respeccing to **prot** once I hit 60. I know I'm behind but I'm going to try to catch up quickly. Turns out being an adult takes a lot of time and I can't dump 12 hours into a game every day any more. Primarily on around **9PM-12AM EST** on weekdays. Weekends are open.
---
well he probably doesn't have a very happy life to treat someone that way.. so there's that I guess. I always figure people must be suffering worse than the way they treated me when they act like that
---
Rest of it is nice thought :)
---
Gone and ruined it with “sodaboy”.
---
There are no guards in Ratchet. Gadgetzan and BB are considered a neutral area so as soon as you hit an opposite faction guards will be after your ass.
---
Wow what a terrible response, I’m sorry for your loss
---
Ehhh it’s not hard. Just tedious.
---
No changes is one thing but adding something simple like a water table for people to click on and get their own wouldn't ruin the game.
---
Will these be coming in one of the next phases?
---
I didn't realize it was an automod thing, and I thought there was no perception of the discussion being stifled.
---
Stop being so narcissistic you think you should control what is being discussed.
---
You’re the School shooter personality type aren’t you?
---
Ah gotcha.  Yeah I didn't read set bonuses the first time through.
---
0 as opposed to -10
---
You don't get to decide whether or not you break a carte blanche.
---
It's entirely arbitrary.
---
Yup. The gaming platform. If you’re using the money, status, and prestige you have as a company to support censorship of political speech, you deserve whatever blowback you get from it.
---
What Blizzard did was unconscionable and utterly fucking disgusting. If you disagree, congrats, you’re a fucking scumbag.
---
And if you think the rest of the world should shut up about their suffering so you can enjoy your video games and tendies I disturbed by reality, you’re a miserable excuse for a human being.
---
How is 3% damage and 3% Crit to almost every mob useless, not to mention you can be more liberal with Crit gear in early phases with sure footed
---
What is this lol 
---
Is this like a “the priest isn’t doing any DPS! Kick him!” type thing lmao 
---
That’s all I can think about
---
I was just thinking of all armor on items, didn't realize it was set bonuses until later.
---
Haven't played poe in... hmm since August 25 ;)
---
I bet you're fun at parties.
---
I get it, but whenever I had to heal two handed warriors, it was much harder and didn't go as smoothly
---
Thunder Bluff is definitely my favorite place to chill / do AH stuff now. It's a really nice city imo, second to IF for sure
---
Yay #nochanges.
---
Just want to make the macro, I would normally use plain /roll. It's mostly for fun and at this point I want to solve the problem of the macro running out of order. 
---
Most people don't get annoyed seeing a few letters on a screen on occasion.
---
Upbote for arrested development ref.
---
But seriously, get a 2h...
---
That’s fair
---
Honestly I’ve never ganked a single player. Not ONCE! I’ve defend myself against being ganked, with varying degrees of success. Mainly because while I enjoy pvp I haven’t honed the open world pvp skill set which is admittedly different that battlegrounds pvp. Thanks for the suggestion and defense!
---
Not many go soul link though, but yes when I did aoe runs when hitting 60 I’d always have my void out, I’m max engineering/alchemy so I had potions, and then the infamous healthstone. I’d still ask for bubble and renew before going In
---
What times are you playing? I’m still seeing servers at medium also.
---
Where’s Treebeard?!
---
Thanks again Ragni.
---
Wow... Now you're saying you think school shootings are acceptable...
---
I hate people like this, "it's a bigger upgrade for me" just means "I'm too lazy to farm prebis and want to skip right to raid gear". They'd be bottom of the list in my raid.
---
Maybe it wouldn't ruin it, but now mages don't have to plan and manage their inventory prior to raids. These things add up.
---
A dps doesn’t need to wry about overall Heath
---
The screeenshot shows the Wowhead guide's requirements for the quest at the bottom and the Wowhead databases requirements fir the same quest above. 
---
[This guide also shows the same amount of mats as the Wowhead database.](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-warlock-epic-mount-quest-guide/#thexorothianglyphs)
---
The materials that differ are: 
---
* 3 or 35 black dragon scales
---
* 2 or 10 elixir of shadow power 
---
* 1 or 3 arcanite bar
---
Maybe I'm missing something but I feel no rage.
---
Honestly the wordless invite works most of the time while leveling, especially around kill quests (bonus if there is opposing faction around and you can have yourselves a nice team-building skirmish).  
---
I generally have more fun grinding with a partner.
---
Let me tell you about Prayer of Fortitude.
---
Mages OP
---
Didn't bliz ban this addon for classic?
---
I do not.  It happened during the first couple weeks of launch in Felwood and I was exhausted lol.
---
New player here. What does it do? Tried looking it up on wowhead but it doesn’t seem to have any other use than combining to «balance of light and shadow»? And i do not know what that is.
---
Considering hunters ignore half the effects on the weapon and only use the hit and crit, fuck no. -stam isn't a problem for DPSers. A guild clearing Naxx isn't going to have DPSers dying a bunch from the difference of that much HP.
---
you and the boys tried to make a meme, hopefully your gold farming turned out better
---
Maybe: tab every attack against a target and make a mouse over earth shock macro, that way you can build aggro 2 ways, semi-simultaneously.  Just a thought.  Honestly I think Earthbind is a pretty sick ability to help with AoEing pulls.  If you can have aggro on all of them, might as well impede their movement.
---
Definitely something that should be brought in for healthstones. Pretty harsh to grind 25-35 ss before a raid
---
I like the Dota reference, but I would hands down kill and camp for that infuriating use of characters. Good luck not getting invites when you message someone helping the lead find more people. 
---
“Invite ceeeeeeeb he’s down”
---
No way to /invite or /who that mess.
---
This. I sometimes wonder why they even still have slow fall.
---
Ubrs can be solo healed thats why. Also dps is much higher than vanilla sonit doesnt matter anyways.
---
Not enough rage
---
Need more rage
---
43 upvotes lol....here is another.
---
I have no problems recruiting for groups, usually I have mostly guildies in groups and even when I pog I have no problems finding groups/recruiting for my own, with that being said usually when I’m running strath undead I’m going for the mount and the righteous orbs are an added bonus... I’m full pre bis with a few pieces of raid gear and get along with everyone (other than people who can’t read what I’m saying like you), and I have frequently see people who are only running the dungeon for one single piece of gear or who need help getting said piece of gear, in those instances i say “okay you can reserve the cloak, but I’m going to reserve the first righteous orb to make it worth my time”.  I could solo farm Maraudon and play the game like it’s a job to make max gold per hour but I’m not grinding for gold, I’m enjoying the game. On my server righteous orbs are 40 gold a piece so 1 or 2 in a run is great for me
---
Sounds like paladin levelling. 
---
I judge seal of light and then alt tab to browse the Internet. Come back when the fighting sounds are done.
---
Yeah depending on the zone difficulty  you will level up faster
---
I was going to attempt painful napkin math on this (say, if you miss the last flurry swing, how much DPS would you lose with typical weapons), but then I noticed that flurry buff lasts 15 seconds... 
---
Should be enough for three swings, even with a 2H?
---
Does this also give you the cool mini map?
---
There can only be one!
---
And hes rude to his wife
---
Thanks. So Ratchet is a FFA and the Hordies were probably using a loophole in BB/Gadget.
---
Then don’t sign it
---
Crusader enchant  is crusader enchant , but 300g can be anything.  It could even be the crusader enchant.  You know how much we’ve wanted one of those.
---
Have you not heard the saying I’m literally dead. But clearing you are not. It’s an exaggeration, to emphasize     Like it or not it’s here
---
What does the [] after the macro conditions?
---
It is fucking obvious by anyone involved in business that you can not hijack your employers platform to push a personal political controversial opinion and not be punished.
---
This happens to me too, I thought it might be related to my mouse, I’m glad I’m not the only person with this problem. Tried the console command in one of the comments, hoping that fixes it.
---
How a warlock can be so unfunny
---
Being pretty much undefeatable 1v1 if you have soul stone, healthstone, and voidwalker out is also a pretty nice bonus. Also cant forget wrecking casters 10 levels higher than you because of curse of tongues is also lulzy.
---
Thanks for the life story. Who cares?
---
if you're leaving, please send me your wow gold. I'll happily have it. Be it retail or Classic. Let's do it, I'll record the whole thing as proof of you leaving. It'll be out there for everyone to see. 
---
Let's do it. Prove to us that you've left.
---
r/thathappened
---
It's acceptable according to tos
---
I really wish I could tell you the exact material. The base feels metal and the center balance is low. The main body feels like a soft abs plastic? I can squish or bend it, but it’s soft you know?
---
Omg I remember this very well, totally forgot about it!
---
I think AoE pulls are more about preventing them from getting to DPS, not necessarily holding aggro.  Their isn't exactly much you can do but hope there is an item that enables AoE threat or modifies current mechanics.
---
True, I launch blizzard games because I have fun and I love them, I respect blizzard developers. Fuck people that bring political bullshit to places where people relax and have fun.
---
Well you don't have to pay attention with slow fall.
---
Imma say yes it is a hunter weapon. Any warrior dps worth their weight will actually be fury, meaning 1hs only. 
---
Ret Pala and Arms are pretty much offspecs.
---
Overpower....
---
Could you put an emote in the middle, like /sit or something? So /yell, /sit, /roll?
---
False.
---
But would they have main spec arms warriors and ret paladins.
---
I really hope whoever has those names is the same person and plans on multi boxing them
---
Literally just posted something along the lines of this the other day.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/de2hop/z/f2rjkrj
---
Likely a loophole, yes. There are ways to avoid the guards but, as far as I'm aware, it is considered exploiting. However, I haven't seen an official stance from blizz on this and am unaware if they have made one.
---
Enough for u to come and waste your time commenting/ attacking my post. 👍😆
---
I had a rogue tank ZF, just put on a shield and evasion tank. Have to go slow though.
---
I remember a time when arcane explosion has a cast time
---
Fwiw I got all the heads done as a healer with no damage done. This is definitely a bug and GMs these days are barely qualified to ask if you want fries with that.
---
I like having swiftness potions and my grenades. As a warlock we can only fear. And I rarely use curse of exhaustion, I feel that tongues or agony is normally the one that I need most. I hate when the fear makes me run too far and they survive, I feel that if I pop off a shadowbolt or 2 within my first fear it’s almost a guaranteed win for me so I don’t like them getting away
---
Zong!
---
Because paying $180 for a year of playing a video game is completely normal.
---
I've been playing in Europe and North America, no issues at all. VPN or not, doesn't make a difference.
---
I love aux, it's so clean and simple and I'll never use auctioneer.
---
Big Blue Dress
---
Definitely does! Thank you. 
---
Kind of reminds me of Wild West - themed comics from back in the day.
---
I would love it
---
I played a priest thru bwl, and I had fun for a while, but being completely helpless in PvP was supremely annoying.
---
And an employer gets to deny you your year's earnings over this?
---
No. No they don't. Because of course they fucking don't.
---
I legit just bought a level 32 blue 2H stave for my elemental shaman and it’s the same dps.....as your 1h. Very nice weapon indeed
---
Keepin' my jaw on the ground
---
I haven't heard one idea pertaining to a "classic+" model that I think would work. People fail to comprehend that t3 is pushing the game to its limits at a power level, while also not understanding the magic of WoW raiding is a finely balanced mix of prestige (completing raid), power increase (gear), cosmetic prowess (visual identifier of progress through gear) which can't be simply made into "horizontal gear upgrades", it's just not going to work and literally isn't the spirit of classic/vanilla.
---
Then comes the notion of Blizzard even being able to create and execute on the new world / raid / dungeon additions, I personally just don't believe they have the "magic" anymore to do it. Listening to people like Kevin Jordan and John Staats on countdown to classic convince me ingredients of the secret recipe are long gone. Kevin Jordan had to fight for there to be a horde and alliance faction for vanilla... Those kind of points of context give me zero confidence in a future classic +.
---
If anything Blizzard should keep classic, have TBC enhanced, wotlk enhanced, and also in parellel develop a new mmorpg that is based on the fundamentals of classic. I can genuinely say classic+ is definitely a "you think you do but you don't"
---
Thanks man.
---
What anger management does is it generates 1 rage every 3 seconds whenever you have more than 0 rage. I assume it was supposed to only work out of combat to slow down rage loss bit they never fixed it and changed it to just give rage in tbc.
---
Great explanation
---
Yes. It's been going on all day.
---
My report button has been getting a ton of use today.
---
So you think a GM has details into the what has been probably hourly meetings since this shit storm happened? Lololol kids
---
You combined it with an item from molten core to create an epic staff that priests can use
---
Courts have the power to disallow provisions of a contract if they are unconscionable. There's more to it than "this doesnt seem fair" but in theory it could be looked at as an option. A very expensive option.
---
Right?? Like holy fuck pretentiousness is some kind of fucking contagious at the moment
---
Yes. That's why you buy the BoEs off the AH and call it a day.
---
I think it only matters what China wants, that is what Blizzard will do.
---
........
---
ItS tOo FaR aWaY
---
I should rephrase   I think it's absolutely reasonable to expect content additions.  I think that blizzard of 2019 will not provide as much content or even half as much as what's there without further monetization.
---
Games like this tend to attract this type
---
Have you seen the runescape community?
---
yeah i was more getting at raids

Great comment
---
They rend at my soul.

It's political to be against the torture, killing, and detaining of innocent citizens?

Run dmn for dogs and bugs, run out and do dme for 4 lasher packs. Reset. Should be easily less than 12min per run

I will only resub if you put Mr Blizzard himself on the phone this instant

Yea, those are the 3 points that will do anything for you in the survival tree.

No. That's Carbonite.

A ton of people wont take rogues. Sometimes i get invited and immediately kicked. Sometimes i get no whisper back, and see someone add a condition intheir LFG post to exclude me. Sometimes they just post no rogues.  
---
EVEN THOUGH I OUT DPS MOST MAGES. 
---
Had to get that out. Yeah its a real problem i dont even look for groups anymore. I roll with a tank who builds groups for me. If i ask for members for a party nobody responds. If he asks we get a full party in minutes. ggwp
---
That's pretty awesome
---
My only desire would be more customization of the item aesthetics.  I tried out Guild Wars 2 recently and really enjoyed how unique you could make yourself look-  instead of 99% of level 40 warriors and shamans looking identical, and paladins raiding in dresses.  
---
I feel like transmutes and full outfits go a bit too far, but there could be a happy medium (like changing colorways or advanced hide/show options).
---
I thought that was only if you set a reserve?
---
not when it pisses off 15-20 other adults
---
You poor care bear
---
Guess it depends on the fight and I don't know raid bosses enough to speak to that. I thought that the boss would to right back to the first tank after taunt wore off unless the second tank was able to build enough threat during the taunt duration. Is that incorrect?
---
Luthien is LotR...
---
I'm not saying druids can't tank, there stamina and armor are great stats in dire bear form. What I'm saying is, there is an inherent ability that bosses have that they can't mitigate due to lack of shields. It's called Crushing Blows.
---
What a fashionable interaction
---
Moe, Larry, curly. How did the 3 stooges not come into this?
---
Fairly certain it doesn't as it is a "low-value" debuff and gets pushed off (or doesn't get applied) on raid bosses.
---
If i turn on advanced logging I also need to use this command ? also collecting all this data is memory heavy ? I wont have logs folder soon 50 gb ?
---
Have fun in raids with no rogue friends to dps for you lol.
---
That and there’s no way to mitigate crushing blows other than an ability that takes a crushing blow to trigger...
---
The funny thing is this person isn't even at the edge of the bell curve. People like him hide behind normal behavior in their day to day. If you knew this guy in real life, at they very most you'd probably suspect he was weird and/or strange. Many of these people don't even come close to behaving like this in the real world. It's just something the internet brings out
---
Except smart people always go and check for those stacks of 20 because they're often cheaper than buying the individuals. I get tons of good deals like that.
---
Because these people are terrified of actually having to care about something for once, and it's easier to pretend everyone else is faking it than admit Blizzard might have irrevocably fucked up in a way that requires them to do something inconvenient.
---
Disagree on Rend. In order for Sunder Armor to add more value than Rend @ level 30, each Sunder would have to improve the damage of each of your melee attacks by 15, assuming your weapon has a 3.0 attack speed. (Sunder does not add that much damage per hit.) 
---
This does not take into account that Rend only costs 10 rage while Sunder costs 15.
---
/emote doesn't work.
---
I love questie and I'm tracking like 10 quests just by shift clicking them
---
I dunno why anyone would want to be so expendable :)
---
Thank you for this comment I had NO idea what anyone was talking about.
---
The threat that taunt gives doesn't wear off, the second tank just needs to keep sustaining threat using his abilities. It's like a step ladder to the top, you can't just stop hitting though.
---
Agree with this too.
---
The way I look at it is that we as Paladins are so much more than just “warriors that use golden magic”. 
---
Yes, we use plate gear and train in martial arts to fight with our adversaries, wearing heavy armor and weapons to defend ourselves and to enhance our physical capabilities.
---
But, we also do more, we seek to understand the light and it’s mysteries, which requires research, wisdom, and intelligence. This “side” of the Paladin does not need for one to wear plate heavy armor, but to use the more “useful” and “appropriate” apparel (meaning cloth armor).  
---
But if we wear cloth armor does that not makes us priests? Well, I would argue that it does not. Why? Because as stated before, we Paladins KNOW how to wear heavy armor and are trained in martial arts. But, we choose not to do so, we wear cloth because our brothers and sisters may need people to heal them, and because our duty as Paladins is to be as useful as possible for the sake of our group. Furthermore, we are Paladins not because we wear heavy armor and use big two handed maces, but because of our training and the virtues that we as Paladins choose to follow.
---
I know it is a bit dramatic and such, but I find it fun to just think about stuff like this, as nerdy as it sounds, so fuck it haha. Also, this logic applies if you believe that cloth is is mostly used  to draw “intelligence” while plate draws “strength” and “Stamina”.
---
Yeah, popped that in my druid bit. There the same. No crushing blow defense.
---
I find it funny you guys think this dude is a real fucked up psycho. In the grand scheme of things he's not even close to the edge of the bell curve
---
I have noticed many suffix items with nearly identical twins +1 or -1 in one of the stats.
---
The fuck do you care? 
---
I unsubbed go suck China’s cock somewhere else
---
Is it better to be in a zone closer to your actual level or use bait and fish harder zones? I’m sure it was just slowing down due to increased levels but moving from red ridge to dustwallow w/bait drastically reduced my skillups
---
No one cares. Im still enjoying WoW 😍
---
What about as feral dps? Preferably in a pvp setting. I also heard they were good in open world but not so good in bg’s. I remember we use to run 1 Druid as a flag carrier in wsg when it came out but that was about it.
---
Thought I recognised the guild name 😂😂

You aren't a casual.

Mine still caps at 5 when i do :(

I've done that twice with no luck, I go to red right after a couple minutes and I'm the only one on the internet
---
&gt;You should expect to not tank bosses after MC.
---
A lot of BiS Druid tank gear is in BWL and AQ 40 and that’s where they really start to shine, don’t know what game you played.

---
How important is uncrushable, couldn't the healers heal through it through the fight? 
---
Why not enchant gear + librams to increase Int/ Spirit while the paladin has the gear to be uncrushable?
---
Like 99.9% sure it's the 3,2, and 1 numbers, not the higher ones.
---
Ah, I thought the taunt threat wore off.
---
Oh man you should head up to thousand needles
---
To play devil's advocate: I must have been 13 or 14 when I hit 60 in Vanilla. Somehow, I got accepted into a hardcore raiding guild and was forced to download Ventrilo and buy a headset for raids and dungeons. 
---
I was pretty socially isolated at school to the extent that I can still remember my first time speaking in Ventrilo with other guildies (many of whom were older than me). I remember helping them do a question WPL and intentionally deepening my voice so they wouldn't think less of me because I was younger than them.
---
This transitioned into much more confidence at school, and being more comfortable talking with strangers led to me getting pretty heavily involved in 2v2 arena in BC, where I was more-or-less in constant communication with my warrior partner.
---
For me, the forced social interaction had an important impact on my own development. It's realistic many will have similar experiences with classic (the playerbase is probably significantly older), but if it's possible, then I'm totally in favor of forcing the player to confront his/her social anxiety to find groups in WoW. 
---
It's probably THE safest and most comfortable place for someone with anxiety to slowly get used to talking with strangers. There is a powerful avatar on screen who literally represents you in all interactions. The game is the common subject. Your game knowledge and expertise lend you credibility. I remember being much more comfortable speaking in Ventrilo once I started getting raid gear, and once I got the &lt;Gladiator&gt; title in BC, I felt like I could talk with anyone I wanted, piece of cake, which was a complete 180 compared to how insecure I was at the start of 60. It's like rolling around in a fancy sport car - there are social status markers everywhere.
---
Just my 2c.
---
All I know is there's always two sides to every story. And when you respond like this, I'm less likely to sympathize for you even if OP accidentally ninja'd some nodes or something
---
Would you people shut up and stop acting like you are making some brave and noble decision. Half of these people probably have no idea what's even happening in Hong Kong. Buddy, you should have put your money where your mouth is and sent us your gold.
---
Its honestly depressing because I wanna run brd but I wont because I will he a handicap to a group and that's unfair to them
---
That chance in hit is pretty amazing though 33 defense at 5 defense per level.. some of the best DPS gear doesn’t have stats, jus that and crit.
---
24hr is way to long, you are putting it in the max so paying the highest deposit, which you lose if you dont sell. Some greens will sell, put them up during primetime for 2 hours. But yea, most greens you should just vendor

The quest doesn’t exist in retail because they deleted class quests. Additionally, the link to the guide specifically says it’s for Classic Wow and was recently updated from the old values to the new ones.

Druids are the weakest healers, but that doesn’t mean they’re useless.  Druid healers bring brez, thorns, motw, emergency tank.  They’re absolutely viable healers in every raid.  With that being said every single other healing class can do the specific job of healing better than druids.
---
What cc does a shaman have
---
Those shaky moments are likely because they've done too large pulls. By forgoing a shield you miss a bit of armor and the ability to block. That armor and block is negligible when fighting 3 or less mobs at a time, but it becomes exponentially more noticeable with larger packs. In large packs where you're receiving lots of attacks every second, that extra armor and ability to block becomes very useful.
---
That's why you should stick to smaller pulls, and equip a shield when dealing with very large packs.
---
Mages dont use tanks ?
---
As a Warlock, I cannot begin to express the frustration I feel when the healers in my group are not on par with my dps.  This is completely justified tbh.
---

---
Blizzard's actions were inherently political due to real world events, and they chose to openly side with the totalitarian regime instead of even pretending to appear neutral.
---
And beyond that, it _does_ have implications for Classic, because it shows they haven't changed a bit since the Diablo Immortal fiasco, and that they don't give a single fuck about their customers outside China anymore.
---
I was originally excited for the possibility of things like Classic+, or maybe even seeing them apply some of the lessons from classic to retail, but all hope of that is dead now.
---
I highly doubt this happened, go back into the vod and find proof, or you're just making shit up
---
That still ignores the fact that tier 1/2 gear is worse than greens and blues 15 ilvls lower than it...
---
As an arms warr that’s where imp overpower shines! Would be more useful as a 2h warr tho
---
I played with the charger for something like 6 years and never once got counter spelled or bashed while trying to cast my mount
---
Yes they do. You signed a contract. It's pretty simple, keep any views that may harm them off they platform...even if what he is doing is for the good. 
---
Dude blizzard is a business. People keep forgetting that. You want to go push your political views, that's fine, but you wont be doing it on blizzards dime. Oh yeah, thats right....no one would even know who this kid is without blizzard.
---
Now I'm not sure ... I'm finish conflicting answers as well lol.
---
Crushing blows sound bad, but isn't there ways to enchant gear to increase the mitigation?
---
It really isn’t terrible for leveling, which is what I thought was implied when the start of the thread talked about getting Parried, which doesn’t happen when DPSing if you have any idea how to DPS.
---
And, no, dual wielding isn’t bad while leveling, using your best possible weapons is the single best way to level, even if your best weapons are daggers. Two awesome 1handers beats a good 2hander.

Free speech only means the government can't arrest or censor you for your political opinion. It doesn't mean you're entitled to use any platform you want for your opinion or that private companies have to allow you to say what you want when you want.
---
I'm fairly sure taunt as in literally taunt does put you at the top and give you that threat. But I dunno if that was a change they made later on or not.
---
There are several other lesser taunt effects that definitely don't.

There's no reward for pvp before 60. It's just a waste of time. Get to 60 and then pvp.
---
Use earthshock, more threat.
---
Yeah, the one group that enjoyed getting ganked replied to this thread. Being double the level of the people you're treating like toys and playing by your own dumb rules is pretty damn pathetic.
---
That one was my nemesis too back then. But it was because I didn’t know how to kite, and I was a keyboard turning clicker. 
---
That single fight taught me how to kite, and turned me on to mouse turning and forced me to bind my buttons, then I was like “hey it’s easier to play overall like this wow.” Who would babe know lol
---
Probably a lot of players who never played vanilla/tbc before. In Wrath they completely revamped threat to be a joke to maintain so people just got used to spamming aoe damage from that point on.
---
In actual vanilla most people either knew to focus one target and manage their threat, or they learned by dying.
---
As a holy paladin already, i just wanted too see this done once as a proof of concept, to put into perspective everything that needs to happen for a paladin to tank in Vanilla Wow. I had a friend in highschool who main tanked for his guild as a paladin, and i wanted to see if it was possible. from what i've gathered here, it certainly seems possible.

Thanks

---
It is a thing for 15 years sadly.
---
Wouldn't it be possible to tank swap by having the paladin drop righteous fury and reapply it when he needs to get threat back?
---
I got a really nice set of gauntlets off him. It was by accident
---
&gt;I'm fairly sure taunt as in literally taunt does put you at the top and give you that threat.
---
Taunt temporarily removes all other players from the threat list, then re-adds them at their current threat level.
---
The important part here is you need a multiplier of the current target's threat value to pull damage off them. So long as the tank's threat + the multiplier is higher than the current threat of the dps/healer the mob will stick to the tank.
---
This mechanic is why burst damage causes tanks the most problem. Burst damage like a shammy will have a very powerful spike in threat, which peels the mob off the tank. Where if their damage was more consistent over time it wouldn't breach the threat threshold.
---
The one does not exclude the other, young grasshopper.

Shut up you tit!

Warlocks really should be able to summon people all by themselves...

What?
---
I saw your question and turned 360 and walked away
---
I don't remember which patch, but by 1.12 debuff slots are not capped at 8 and there's a priority system in place.
---
Still means raids have to manage debuffs, but shitty side-effects don't eat slots anymore like they used to.
---
Hunters are pretty close tho
---
I would guess omnicc? Your best bet is to disable them one at a time
---
I would use bait and go to a harder area but probably just using one of the guides would be best
---
Meh, im making sure a necessary item is always available at the AH.
---
The reason i started selling it was that it didn't appear anyone else was.
---
I think I’ve seen you, Rattlegore?
---
Oh wow, thank you! that's fascinating. There are items in the game that increase your Defense, plus the talent that raises defense by 10 (if you invest all 5 points into it). Still 15% chance to get hit by a crushing blow, that seems low. What do you think?

No, they're doing it by ripping people out of hospitals who were injured by police from protesting and throwing them into prisons.

Either just do arena/anger runs or if you are really struggling grab a decent group and go do few quick ST runs, it’s got a lot of trash and fast layout. The MH axe from last boss is also a nice tank wep.

---
Paladin can put out as much threat as it needs by spamming Greater Blessing of Kings on whichever class you have the most of in a raid. The buffs will put out more threat than any other class is capable of as long as you don't care about reagents.
---
The problems are not being able to taunt swap with another tank, and being able to be crushed.
---
If its a boss that you don't need to swap with, or only need to swap with once or twice (you can bubble or BoP yourself as long as the offtank is second on threat) then feel free to try it.
---
there absolutely are guards in ratchet, there just aren't very many compared to ther places and they are very spread out so its possible to find and catch someone in between guarded areas.
---
Thinking the market should adapt to your business instead of adapting your business to the market is one of the primary reasons businesses fail.

Thank you very much for this comment. I'm definitely missing something about booming voice and rogues though? Does Demoralizing Shout break stealth or something?
---
I mean. He doesn't.
---
Bud? Suddenly I know exactly the kind of douche you are. If you care about Hong Kong you will find a way to deliver the gold.
---
thats by in large due to the fact that their "pvp content" has all just been finding ways to force pvmers into pvp areas instead of actually giving pvpers reasons to fight other pvpers
---
I like how you spent a disproportionate amount of time on this.
---
thank you!
---
Call me crazy, but I'm leveling prot (cause I like prot) with my wife, le mage.
---
But hot fuck did I forgot how poor rage gen is. I can pretty.much spam block/revenge and keep aggro off of her, but getting more than 25 rage usually puts me at critically low health.
---
Man the giant feet ruin it for me xD
---
Don't have OmniCC installed, I am going crazy.

That isnt world dominance that's a corrupt government, which China definitely is. My point was saying they're coming for us isn't true.

You are complaining on the wrong subreddit, I suggest you make your way to /r/wow aka retail.
---
That's not how this works. You don't get to say "Well, tough luck, shouldn't have agreed to that." You *can't* agree to that. That's the whole point.
---
I am the market lol. Ive got my bank stocked and can probably win any price war. 
---
I'll half my prices and half them again until competitors fuck off.
---
/u/tikarii posted a link to crushing blow, and it seems like a low chance to be hit. Aren't there items that increase your defense skill plus the talents in prot that increase your defense up by 10 (if you invest 5 poinst into it). I can certainly see how it's a HUGE concern, especially when you get hit by it and the healers have to heal through that.
---
It is stupid seeing 1 silk cloth on the AH but some items you do need only 1 of.
---
Maybe Mp5 bar? I have simething that looks similar for my shaman. After I don’t cast a spell for 5 seconds, I get a grey bar like that. It refills every 2 seconds and lets me know when I’ll get my next tick of mana regen.
---
Could you do a mix of arms and fury and use dual wield? I'm new but I've been thinking since I have enough points left after mortal strike I could get the offhand boost from arms but I never really see anyone mention it.
---
&gt;there are nice other MMO out there to celebrate once you are done with classic (e. G. Final Fantasy Eso guild wars 2 and many more.
---
except all those MMO's are shit compared to wow
---
It's such a stupid argument as well. There will always be a significant amount of casuals who can't do X new content. So, should this argument be used when they're about to release a new raid? Fuck no, go kill your boars and let end-game players get their shit. No one wants to wait on slow people. The game shouldn't be catered towards casuals who aren't invested in it half as much.

Any updates?

---
Righteous Fury doesn't drop threat or take aggro. It merely increases your threat generation.
---
The moment your Paladin takes off Righteous Fury, he'll start to rapidly fall behind all the dps - and he'll have no way to quickly build threat to get above them.
---
In theory, if you timed everything out perfectly, you might be able to do it. But it would be incredibly tricky compared to "I press this button and take aggro".
---
I feel bad for saying this but I completely agree I don’t care what a company does i I like their game and screw you for asking me to quit the game and just punish myself for no reason
---
I disagree—when it comes to paladins for instance, wearing plate is pretty core to the fantasy of the class, and one of the core differentiators flavor-wise from being a priest. I think armor types are very important to the look and feel of a class, regardless of what would make more logical sense in a realistic world.

*"Misses"* Kodo

The Classic experience is so garbage

Not sure about twink item longjevity tbh.. ut probably
---
Are Geddon pet bombs still a thing because i can't wait to All A Who Ackbar the AH at peak, a fresh Ony Buff raid group or a clustered group of opposing faction at BRM.
---
That's just now how World of Warcraft is intended to work, these GMs are not only lazy but must be shit players who don't understand basics on a 15 year old game.
---
I'm sorry OP.
---
In PvE they're ok but require high input with powershifting all the time, for pvp they're fun for sure and in BG's they're great flag carriers with 0/30/21 build
---
The "rules" are that you can't openly fight the other faction in those locations but there are 3 ways around those rules. 1) In some places of those cities its possible for a high enough level rogue to drop their invisibility, one or two hit you and then vanish to avoid the guards. 2) There are ways for people to use roofs and other terrain to avoid guards while in those locations, this is considered an exploit and should be reported as they do ban people for doing that. 3) if you spend the time to grind your reputation to exalted with the faction controlling the neutral city you can attack pretty much anyone you want and the guards will not get involved.
---
That's just the shellfish.  You also get all the XP from the mobs that spawn and patrol as well as a bunch of vendor trash and the silver they drop as well.  You also get a decent amount of greens to put up on the AH as well as a chance for Big Iron Fishing Poles.  On my server those go for 5g a pop on the Neutral AH.
---
What OP did, if its not a photoshop job is way overkill.  I did this same grind this last weekend.  Started at 20g and after about 6 hours total farming, I was at 105g.
---
Bit of nitpicking, but you hamstring spam after getting Bloodreaver's Edge from Rag. The proc ignores armor. Combined with WF, it is absurd.
---
I'm not altogether sure on what the best method for 2h fury without it. I am slam spec 2hnder, and I'm doing really well. I'll switch to DW if I get the weps, but BRE is my goal.
---
They can. But most groups raiding UC want to kill Sylvanas. And the sewer entrance is closer to her.

Lol... going from 1 dungeon being released a bit earlier to fucking TBC. Give me a goddamn break.

I farmed this bad boy every day on my mage in vanilla for my epic mount.  Sold a whole bunch of them

I don't think this is true. The only reason WoW is more popular then those games is because WoW is more popular.

What minimal add on are you running?

How do you not realize it’s a joke?

Same here, I farmed the earth and air and bought water because it’s way to damn hard to farm them. bought fire because I was frustrated with the water. Probably cost me 300 gold
---
On the KOS list for the deadwood clan. Better wash your back around these parts
---
Ouch, yeah i can see how that is a problem, but crushing blow has a 15% chance to happen with defense 300 @60. Increase the defense through the talent in the prot tree, which equals to 310, plus any defense from items. If you get crushing blowed back to back, that's unfortunate, at least from what i'm seeing. /u/tikarii posted a link to crushing blow
---
you don't like killing one pack and your inventory is full of a bunch of worthless drops?
---
"rogues are scissors, warriors are rock, all else is paper. Paper beats rock. Scissors beats paper. Scissors also happen to beat rock. Until rock hits 60 and turns into an unstoppable killing machine and beats paper... And would beat scissors, but it can't find scissors, because scissors are invisible.
---
So scissors beat paper and avoid rock - and that is called balance"
---
We’ll take the mystery box!
---
Do you have WeakAuras? Could be a piece of one of them
---
Poor wording. To clarify - this won't make a noticable change to my experience. I'm usually questing in two or three zones, so population isn't an issue. And I'm on an overnight schedule. 
---
If I wasn't on here &amp; seeing the news about it, I honestly wouldn't see anything in-game to make me think it was going on. 
---
Tl;Dr, my play style just doesn't make use of layering, nor am I visible affected by it.
---
That's good to hear! Karma exists, what goes around what comes around. If you do good in the game, there will be people do good to others...
---
Best tanks iv hand tanked with a 2h.
---
If you have weapon skill and a sword and board, swap for st bosses. 
---
2h doesnt mean u cant go defensive stance. Which is like 40-50% damage reduction if your wearing plate. Far more damage reduction than the rest of your party.
---
Harder content will require a shield but that's all 52+ And even then I'd only swap for smaller pulls. Any healer that is bitchn is a bad healer. All damage on 1 target=: easier to focus big heals, all mobs stay in same place = aoe down = less fight duration = similar mana usage to a long fight.
---
Agree, it's beyond tiring at this point.
---
It’s not unpopular to anyone who has uses the AH. It’s a reflection on how terrible wow AH has always been. 
---
I was looking the retail wow test server changes and they are still completely missing the mark.
---
There needs to be an AH for rares and other valuable items (with short timers and higher deposits), and a player marketplace (without short timers and high deposits) that also allows for buy orders.
---
Nearly all other MMOs have some sort of system that is like this. Why is WoW the only one that never got the hint?
---
I just started playing a warrior, want to go into arms with a 2H sword cause i already went fury on retail as horde. Can someone explain this to me? Also wouldnt mind if you dropped any tips at all lol
---
This is the first time im hearing about this, that's incredible. Thank you for this bit of information.
---
These people actually tried to explain how to use your mouse to rotate the camera. How do you get that far without realizing it’s a joke
---
With swift mend a druid can save the tank from dying, thus the raid from wiping every 15 second.
---
Haha...ha...ha...heh...
---
Yeah but ILVL really doesn't mean shit in classic anyways.
---
Nope, just you.
---
It's 15% chance like I posted. The problem comes when you get multiple in quick succession. And that can happen. Look, I'm not making it up. Warriors are grade A, druids B, Paladins C along with shamans...
---
They have no clue about anything.  Look at modern WoW.  Garbage.  Look at how far from accurate their prediction for the success of Classic WoW would be.  They have no idea how to appeal to their market anymore, that is why they have fallen so far.
---
You do realize the sole purpose of the downvote button is to spam it whenever you even slightly disagree with someone, right?

---
Unique items and graphics create innate value, both in the envy of others but how they fit into the meta of the game.
---
The faction leaders are just raid bosses. They're intended to be kill able by a raid of 60s, no problem. Just they have a lot of health to stop sneak kills, so that the opposition faction have time to respond and try to defend them.
---
Compared to this random level 58 guy, any of them would demolish him.

If you’re gonna priest, Dwarf is the only correct answer (I say as someone who made a Nelf priest instead of Dwarf)
---
Ah, that makes perfect sense. /u/KouenVajira posted that spamming Greater Blessing of Kings was a great way to increase threat. Also bubbling yourself to give threat to the other tank. What i just thought of while writing this, BOP on the other tank to get the threat.
---
Yes. T faction boss isn't necessarily the hard part, it's the interference from the opposing faction players that makes it hard.
---
Gotcha
---
Notice what?
---
You could be right, but the level of blindness to their own actions is pretty astounding. Usually that sort of behaviour is basically involuntary and consistent across all domains. 
---
I look at it like an algorithm that runs inside the brain. We could call it the “fairness” algorithm. People in the middle of the bell curve for this algorithm are configured to weigh their own actions equally-ish when compared to others. So when the algorithm runs it outputs the same result for themselves as it does others. 
---
This person’s algorithm is heavily discounting their own actions to the point they are blind to the hypocrisy in what they are saying. The fact that it’s the Internet and a low stakes interaction could be fucking with the algorithm a little bit but  in general I think this is how the person is.

That's fascianting, i didnt know it worked like that. Thank you. You wouldn't happen to have a link where we can learn more about this would you?
---
This sub likes it's circle jerk for sure, but itemization is one of the things I also enjoy about classic. To me it feels closer to DnD, where items can have cool little added abilities that make a significant difference. Granted this is limited mostly to epics like edgmasters, those gloves that make you immune to disarm, and something like the corrupted Ash bringer. 
---
I do agree though that the rigidity of itemization in terms of bis and whatnot is somewhat annoying, but I don't mind something like fury warriors wearing leather gear, I think it kind of suites the fantasy of being this berzerker type of guy vs. the steel clad knight that is arms.
---
Not to mention longer time if you ever have to kill totems, and about 0 chance of delaying player spells if you get into pvp
---
Props to you for this and props to whoever put that game of thrones map up at the front!
---
Every raid will at least have one resto druid due mark/gift of the wild, innervate, and battle rez. They're not hps monsters like priests. You get geared as druid extremely fast. Due to this.
---
2h
---
This is appalling responses
---
Nice
---
goat weapon, no questions asked
---
&gt; Growl just forces someone to attack you and doesn't change threat, so they'll go back to what they were doing after. Keep growl CD for if someone pops off you.
---
That's incorrect, it pulls your threat up to match whoever had aggro when you Growled. When the forced attack effect has ended, you will only lose aggro if someone else has reached 110+% of your threat.
---
No.
---
Ideas hit.. Then my brain just keeps going after and I often feel the need to let it go otherwise i continue dwelling
---
Guess what my experience was as an Alliance player.

Increasing your odds of gene survival does not always have a positive impact on your life experience.

They regain health quickly when polymorphed as well, not sure how that would go over though. Might not even realize it.
---
For me it is a mentality thing, missing teo to three times in a row with a 3.8 feels way worse for me because I'm not doing anything. I leveled 2h arms but recently switched to fury. Actually gaining rage fluidly feels nice.
---
Nice.
---
arcanite should drop after DM is released with the 2 rich veins every DM east
---
The answer is not so much that Fury is the DW tree, it's that Arms is the 2h tree. The default state for a well geared warrior is to DW, going Arms changes that equation to make 2h more preferable.
---
whats the link to the rogue discord?
---
Ya you’re asking about the big grey bar overlapping your timers right?

I killed dog first, and reset on Simone who didn't summon a new dog . I thought you had to kill both while they were aggro'd? Made it too easy imo.

What level as a paladin should I repsec into full prot while leveling if I want to be tanking dungeons? I've managed with 11/0/30+ until level 50 but bosses seem to be hitting harder all the time. Any advice?

Bonereaver's Edge
---
No the grey bar, the icon behind it

Are there any good videos/resources for farming Mara as a mage?

New player here: Im playing a druid and I want to heal, and I am level 19 right now (10 talent points).
---
I wanted to heal deadmines, but I put my first 10 points into Feral Combat and the group I found didn't want me to heal because I wasn't full resto. (we didn't actually start the dungeon so maybe I wouldn't have done that well then...)
---
I only have 2 gold so I can't afford to mess this up yet, should I respec?
---
I see some builds online that go full resto, and maybe a little bit into balance for moonglow. I've also seen a build that was mostly feral combat and then the rest in restoration, which supposedly lets you tank, heal, and DPS successfully.
---
I understand the point of druid is to be able to do multiple things but i don't know which way to spec.. im new to WoW and I just want to do my very first dungeon and not have people get mad at me over my spec :(
---
a week after DM is out the market for arcanite will crash.
---
Add up to what?
---
What so you mean inventory management?
---
Is that actually a fun part of the game for you? Do you enjoy inventory management?
---
"no wonder no one comes here...its too crowded!"
---
Not a psychopath necessarily but surely at least 80th percentile for disagreeability. You have to be disagreeable to be a hypocrite.
---
2ndbis might just fit the bill...
---
Seriously, BIS for raiding is great, but you can get away with 10thbis and spend that extra time grinding consumables, helping other guildies get geared, and otherwise wiping in MC as an 'undergeared' squad, gaining experience and practicing. And I'd wager you come out ahead.
---
Has to do with ledges or LoS I realised. Brought him to the open area and it went dandy. (had to use grenades though)
---
Yeah and we do I just thought nobody wants to hear an actual conversation between 4 bros lol
---
Exactly. Druids can tank bosses, if they have enough gear to survive the crushes, if they have enough defense to be immune to crits, and if the healers are geared enough to heal a tank who takes spikey damage and more damage overall.
---
Or you could use a warrior.
---
That is a perfectly valid opinion and I see your point. Then again it’s pretty normal within the fantasy genre that healers have light gear, ranged/melee dps medium gear and tanks heavy gear.
---
Reminds me of Shadowcraft on my Druid, nothing quite like a giant cowman pretending to be sneaky
---
Onyxia doesn't even have an attunement, its a key.
---
With or without quotes, setting to 1, 100 or 1000 makes no difference :(
---
Like I said I can’t really say that’s true that he treats his gf bad but it’s obvious he has a horrible personality and is toxic.  Thanks for the rude comments though lol. 
---
I’m just relaying what I saw and was wondering why people like this kind of content? 
---
Obviously you, are toxic as well, so it doesn’t surprise me your from his stream. Name calling someone retarded is honestly one of the most immature things you can say to someone when trying to offend them. Just fyi, it screams immaturity.
---
Scary face
---
HANDLE IT
---
You're right in that a 10% chance to crit is a 10% chance to crit. However, when dual wielding, if you have 2 weapons with 1.8 attack speed, you will hit 4 times in the time it takes a 2h to hit once. That means you have 4 chances to get a crit in the same amount of time a 2h gets 1 chance.
---
Oh not sure then. I take it you just want to resize them? I’d check your addons in game, in the options menu. It will probably be some weird scale number like X:.0098,, Y:-.0684
---
Why can't you do it with a reaper as orc? I think that is a very beneficial rotation.
---
If it makes carebears angry it was a good use of time.
---
yep, pagle
---
15 percent is quite substantial. Think about main tanking MC. How many hard hitting mobs and pulls are you going to tank before you even get to Rag? Its not that healers can't heal you through it it's that it wastes their Mana pull which means in another 15 seconds when something goes wrong or you get critter, lose aggro, someone pulls an add etc your healers have no Mana and the raid wipes. 
---
Its not very fun having a while bunch of ppl join a raid and block out 3 or 4 hours to do so to have a automatic 15% penalty and chance of wipe. Its not fun going 3 hours into a raid and needing to stop because everyone has red armor. Its not fun to have to stop after spending so much time trying to get to Rag. Leave the main tank to a warrior there are plenty of them and you will have a smoother raid experience and your raid party will too.
---
Bonereavers Edge
---
**Melee wipes on Ragnaros immediately**
---
It can seem low, but it might not be all that low when you crunch the numbers. 
---
Let’s say a fight lasts 7 minutes. Ragnaros attacks once every 2.5 seconds, or 24 times a minute. This is a potential 168 times over the course of the fight. 
---
15% of 168 is a little over 25 crushing blows. 
---
Now this isn’t exact math by any means and Ragnaros isn’t going to just hit you non stop, there are submerges where he’s taken out of the equation for a bit. There are a number of factors that without delving deep into statistics and probability we won’t know. You could be the unluckiest tank in history and every attack could be a crushing blow or the luckiest tank and never see a crushing blow. 
---
Crushing blows are not cumulative. Not getting one doesn’t increase the chance of the next attack.
---
Right... for T0 DPS warriors who aren't tanking.
---
SM/Ruin with fel con is the way to go if you want to raid and be able to farm in your downtime :)
---
Minor self healing. At level 40 it's only 50hp per bloodthirst, so you're only healing up maybe 200hp in a short fight
---
shhhh, don't tell them they're playing on the 7.3.5 client
---
Sure you don't have as many "O shit" buttons, but simultaneously you just maul.
---
Just do dungeons. I made all my epic mount gold insanely fast just doing strat over and over.
---
No. You can heal as feral all the way to 60. The group not taking you was silly. The first 5 points in resto do nothing for your healing anyway.
---
Me neither. I dont watch anime tho
---
When Crit chance is higher, you have a much better time keeping flurry up. Compared to a slam/hs two hander.
---
I have neder understood this joke... Maybe coz eng isnt my first lang and this is some wordplay ? even when its writen i dont get it..
---
It means no conditions.  
---
If you run the following macro and you have no mouseover, or your mouseover is hostile, or your mouseover is dead it will do nothing.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /use [@mouseover,help,nodead]Dispel Magic
---
So adding `[]` at the end will allow the macro to fail over to your default target.  
---
The default target for a helpful spell, fully expanded, would like this, `[@target,help,nodead][@player,nodead]`, and for a harmful spell would like this, `[@target,harm,nodead]`.  
---
Obviously, it's much shorter to just write `[]`.
---
I am going to help. I have the answer yo this and many many other amazingly helpful to a ton of settings.
---
Its super awesome and easy to use. 
---
Leahtrix÷ addon package.
---
It is a gamechanger for quest tracking, map and minimap tweaks and with questie, as others have said, make a fantastic combo.
---
I hope this helps.
---
Any chance you learned this recently ;)
---
Absolutely do not respec. 
---
You’re going to want to level as feral. You’ll still be able to heal leveling dungeons just fine, that group is totally off base. If you want a balanced spec for leveling speed+potential to heal I’d check out the heart of the wild spec (https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-healing-talents-builds-classic-wow#heart-of-the-wild-nature-s-swiftness-0-30-21-healing-druid-talent-build)
---
More experienced druids can probably chime in.
---
Not so thinly veiled “whoosh” post.
---
Not world politics anymore when it's directly linked to the game creators.
---
That is not correct. You level up based on the amount of fish caught. At 225, for example, you need to catch 5-6 fish for each level up.
---
  You can get to 300 by fishing in the pond in valley of honor if you wanted to, just the fish you catch won't be valuable.
---

---
rogue here. I just picked up brutality blade for MH. Options for OH are dal'rends OH, mirah's song, and trash blade. What would you recommend for PvP and PvE? For PvP, its either Mirah's or Dal'Rends. But for PvE, since much of MC is poison immune, would thrash blade actually be viable?
---
I was debating in my mind whether it was oeb or BRE that was from rag.
---
Yeah honestly I'm liking the consistent rage gen from dual wield, but since I'm going to be farming dungeons I'm still not sure if arms with sweeping strikes burst is better than dw fury.
---
All A Who Ackbar made me laugh so damn hard. Thanks for that!
---
I've got nearly 100 kills of the mini bosses on my sp and I'm not convinced those gloves exist! Got all possible combinations of stats, including weird ones with agility, once with +44 extra healing but none of [any] wrath. Well, early DM is our saviour for this slot.
---
Well idk why you’d put yourself through leveling as prot.. sounds miserable
---
Thank you!
---
No one is asking Blizzard to "fight for \[their\] Freedom."  The outrage is over the fact that in response to political grandstanding by a Heartstone Grandmaster in a post-game interview, Blizzard stopped the stream, revoked the player's winnings, banned him for a year, and fired both of the interviewers.
---
The concern is that Activision Blizzard, a US-based company, is actively curtailing the free political speech of its playerbase and in-game-personalities to kowtow to the graces of another nation--and a particularly autocratic nation at that.  They are free to do that on their platform, and it may have seemed to make economic sense at the time, but it's a set of actions that wildly diverges from my values and that values of a large number of other Western players.  I *am* concerned with a large number of other civil rights crises across the world (to include, say, the ethnic cleansing of the Uighur minority in *China*), but I haven't financially backed the stake of other private companies in supporting authoritarian regimes.  That's something that I'm not willing to do, and it's why I am, along with a number of other players, pulling my subscription from any Activision Blizzard games.
---
Your frustrations seem to me somewhat misguided.
---
K
---
Well, you are by fact; a retard.
---
How does he ever treat his gf bad?
---
You people scare me, you are so delusional that you make stuff up completely out of the air, and then convince yourselvs that It's fact?
---
Truly disturbing
---
Never.

I may bow before a slain gnome, but I shall never kneel!
---
Disable and enable all addons one at a time then it will be easier to figure
---
They don't rely on screenshots because they can be manipulated.  They do however acknowledge what was said in chat. They also claim this had to be said at the start of the run. If loot rules arent stated at the beginning then the master looter can do what they want.
---
Something like "MS &gt; OS highest roll wins" is what they want. 
---
It sucks, I know. I too had the same problem happen to me over the years. I was not happy with their response.
---
Bro they will be fine. Trust me. Just like every political stunt, no one will be talking about it in a week and blizzard will be racking in the bucks.
---
Now let's say you owned a company and one of your employees used their freedom of speech to push their political agenda and it directly effected the contract you had them sign. It can also effect your relationship with the host country where you do alot of business. Exactly. Please stop trying to White Knight this situation. Blizzard is a business first and foremost.
---
Whats happening over there is indeed horrible but there are other ways he could have gone about this. Oh and btw, Facebook has all of that and sensors WAYY more political related stuff then blizzard. Where is your outrage about that?????
---
50%. It either happens or it doesn't.
---
when you bid the price goes up. so the next person needs to bid 9g48s to outbid you.
---
Shh, just a new wow killer.
---
With gbok spam everyone can go ham and the pally can still hold aggro. Problem is that when they go oom someone else has to tank while they Regen. Also sometimes a taunt is really needed, so you got to have a mix of tanks anyway
---
When the company producing and profiting from the game makes an overtly political gesture, it isn't the fault of the reactionaries for "bringing political bullshit" to games.
---
&gt; (because I like prot)
---
I genuinely enjoy prot. I just forgot the challenges of rage gen at lower levels / when not having a healer.

Imagine seeing all the posts about this exact thing and then posting that you yourself do it and got banned, looking for sympathy
---
I play WoW solely for the inventory management.
---
It’s just google testing out their new predictive input code
---
While you are correct, I am a casual player at best. Like as maybe 3 to 5 hours a week total. The mats are easy. The dungeons are what hung me up. I wasn't in a good guild, no one wanted to pick up a paly, especially one with average gear, and I was a terrible healer.
---
That's the background of this discussion, yes. And also that we have seen where unchecked progression leads. Retail WoW has become a theme park MMO with a bunch of dusty old roller coasters and Ferris wheels and the like scattered around. It still delivers great progression but it's lost its sense of worlds. 
---
A lot of us feel that's what we've gotten back with Classic and want to preserve it. There was a lot that was great with TBC but we don't want make the same mistakes. We *don't* want to take our horse down that the old town road. 
---
But yeah, there will always be progression. It's fuels the game.
---
Anyone got a good source for info around rare/valuable world drops? A comprehensive list would be optimal.

(I have a weird passion for mindlessly farming mobs for a 1/1000+ chance drop)
---
I was half expecting it to Rez you. "You have gained a level! Congratulations!" *10 mins rez sickness*
---
This was exactly it right here. Thanks for the aid.
---
While we're on the topic, is is Fury or Arms best for levelling?
---
I heard something about respeccing at lvl 40 from Fury -&gt; Arms or is it Arms -&gt; Fury?
---
Sigh, *unzips*... the side I put up with, my lady.
---
I was the NPC, GG
---
I believe sexymap also allows for modifications to the quest tracker.
---
Fascinating, and you're right. The crushing blows are definitely a factor to consider when tanking. XCOM and XCOM 2 are certainly good examples of low %s going off multiple times. 
---
I feel like having a paladin be main or off tank is going to require a lot of forethought and tactics to overcome a lot of the issues people are having.
---
Idk if this is bullshit, but when fishing last night I noticed a circle in the water appear, like what happens IRL when there's fish there, so I tried to cast into the circle and I did a few times and I pulled up chests and more rare things, or things I haven't been seeing, then the circle went away and it was back to the usual fishes I'd get. Is this a thing or am I crazy
---
I don't even have heroic strike on my bar.
---
This is high quality Turbo memes
---
^ 100% agree. I dont see having a Paladin tank and offtank being that successful.
---
I dont think you mean to use the word "good".
---
I think you mean "overgeared for that dungeon".
---
They do. Please do. We're waiting. Let's see if it was as bad as you're acting like.
---
I just finished the class mace quest that had a young pally stroll through silver pine (horde zone) into shadow fang keep with 19+ lvl elites. Lucky I had Guildies in hillsbrad I had no idea how hard getting to the courtyard in the instance would be. Plus all the other horrible things that quest did to me mo’gorosh elites, the gem from blackfathom deeps I could go on. Now I get to look forward to THIS!?!? My god if that wasn’t the longest 4 hrs of my life ALSO I have flight paths in places I never had before
---
In a sense, yes, except Kaepernick is a fucking idiot.
---
I regret using a special character in my name. Hoping name changes become a thing some day so I can get rid of it.
---
Yeah what you said is ok for dungeons but not bosses requiring a tank swap. And I don't think people complain about them in dungeons, i haven't seen it if they do. Most people like that they can aoe tank dungeons.
---
BiS face
---
Too tents = too tense
---
&gt; the start of the thread talked about getting Parried, which doesn’t happen when DPSing if you have any idea how to DPS.
---
&gt; 
---
um, isn't it literally just a random chance?
---
Don't you understand? You killed me 1 whole time while I was afk botting the AH for 75 hours without sleep.
---
You completely destroyed my experience and must suffer for it.
---
Nothing official. This is knowledge from private servers which has seemed to be accurate according to my tank friend while leveling. Private servers got a surprising amount of things right.
---
https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=16499

Here's a private server guide about threat. It should be correct. The only thing Pservers messed up was the amount of threat from some abilities if I recall correctly.
---
Mograine is such a white knight. What a pansy.

Oh and good luck in Westfall when you check on that guys wife. Finding her shack was hard enough to find, I had to LFG to help kill the packs of mobs. I simply had no idea pally quests were so involved

Ooh yeah, the prepatch, I had forgotten about that! That was a glorious time for my lvl 59 mage in bgs, having that water elemental then was seriously op.
---
Dude what?! I thought that second response was the one that would fix it but they just doubled down on their bullshit..... what the fuck is wrong with blizz these days....
---
Sheesh. Where did u try to farm water?
---
You don't get parried unless you're in front of what you're hitting.
---
yea i understand the punch line but my face after joke stays -_-
---
They should get to roll, if they hit greed.   If you don't allow that, then you are a ninja.  It's that simple
---
You must not know how to DPS
---
I believe others have said the 3,2and1 numbers are from after BC and classic wow if it's following vanilla will use the higher amounts.
---
A rogue named "Shady" should make a video mining and ganking around Un'Goro. That would be peak internet.
---
No taunt means you can't tank raids.
---
OP should go druid. You can go resto (every raid has at least 1 resto druid), and druids can tank MC and onyxia as offtanks. Druid off tanks suffer in later raids though.
---
GM’s probably aren’t players. They are just trained from a manual and that’s it probably.
---
Yes
---
Yep. Basically me lmao. I named my dwarf male priest (gonna be disc/holy) Héaler and I feel like Héaler is a female human shadow priest... 😐
---
I love it
---
Honestly, this is an AH issue. Fixing the AH searching or adding to it wouldn't be the worst. Everyone has been asking for it since vanilla anyway.
---
Harder areas you level up faster or mostly around your skill level
---
JoJo is to anime what Iron Maiden is to Heavy Metal or Snoop Dogg to rap. Or monopoly to board games. Or final fantasy to jRPGs or Skryim to wRPGs.
---
To have never seen or heard of it is actually hard to believe given where we are---Its presence is just *that* oppressive on reddit.
---
So much so that being unaware of it says more about your attentiveness to modern trends than it does about its popularity.
---
Your damage is gonna be poop until levels 36 (whirlwind) and 40 (mortal strike). Sweeping strikes is an amazing spell for arms warriors, and putting points in tactical mastery lets you actually stance dance. Try to group as much as possible, and avoid Westfall if ur alliance.
---
Officially cancelled my sub today. I was so excited for Classic, but I just can’t do it anymore. Thanks a lot Blizz.
---
It shows you the frame name of whatever you put your pointer over which may help you figure out what it is.
---
You do not own any post-86 automatics and if you say you do you're a liar.

&gt;Just because we can’t have fully automatic weapons doesn’t mean America is fucking authoritarian

Yes it does.

You are technically a tiny bit ahead of the curve still, I believe.
---
No sorry
---
As per my original comment, I play this character exclusively with my wife, le mage. We make a couple levels a week when we both have time to play. I'm in no hurry; if I was, I'd respec.
---
I know I don't have the time / energy to raid, so getting to 60 whilst enjoying my wife's company is the whole point. We have fun trying to 2-man objectives that should take 5 (and succeeding and celebrating like fools!), and doing whacky shit together. I also love tanking instances, as frustrating as it can be at ~~low~~ any level.
---
I feel I peaked in wow (on a performance level) as a warrior OT in vanilla raiding guild. TBC was all pvp. Wrath, my wife and I first started playing together. Everything after that I played for a couple weeks and called it quits. Haven't subbed since before legion. We came back for this because it was challenging, slow moving, casual, and nostalgic. Figured, I'm not trying to min-max. I'm just trying to have a good time. May as well play prot and enjoy what I do, despite it's drawbacks.
---
Maybe one day, I'll tank for you. :)
---
That's because a lot of the itemization is terrible which is exactly their point.
---
Freezing Band x2 is in all of the preBiS lists.
---
Fury DPS is one of the best DPS classes in the game. Arguably the top melee DPS class.
---
Sorry if you didn't clear MC the 2nd day then you're too far behind /s.
---
You're ahead of most of the playerbase man, no need to worry!
---
Arcanist Bindings is selling for well over OP's budget on my server.
---
I just bought rove of archmage got about a little under half the essence
---
Prot needs consecration, so you won't be full prot, but you could consider going prot from ret if you want. I am not an expert in prot paladin, but you will definitely have better mitigation. If you want to tank content at a higher level than you without a strong healer or maybe an aoe party composition, you may want to, but dungeons should be tankable whether you are full holy or full ret.
---
I use both in conjunction and it's awesome. Having the pricing/historical data and extra crafting functionality of TSM while using the Auctionator interface to post/buy auctions is amazing.
---
This guy gets it.
---
In vanilla I had this happen more than once. My friend was the tank and I was a DPS. rando was partly lead and said the 'priest isnt pulling their weight and letting strays get away. I'm pretty sure he isnt doing ANY damage', then promptly kicked the priest. My friend and I left as well and started our own group. Which was great because i got the item was after!
---
I dont really understand how people run out of quests. Ungoro + Felwood + Winterspring took me to 57 and Plaguelands took me to 60. Just run dungeon quests in between and start looking for pre bis.
---
Crushing blow is the same general problem that too many incoming attacks is.
---
That is to say healers have long cast times, and tank health pools just aren't that huge compared to the total damage dealt over the course of a fight. Even in a quality group, tanks health bars bob up and down like yoyos on tougher pulls.
---
Too much burst (be it through a crit crushing blow or X mobs hitting together) won't give the healer time to cast their spell on you without accidentally overhealing. Or you might just die before they manage to heal you at all. That last one is the big worry with crushing blows, healers need to predict damage a fair bit. Their ability to drop instant saving spells is either heavily time gated or horrendously mana inefficient.
---
Which is why Shaman tanks are likewise not considered viable. They can't get enough mitigation or health bar to deal with crushing/crits and they lack a taunt.
---
Just google blizzard customer service number and explain what's going on
---
As a holy priest I can confirm that we do! :)
---
You think that anyone knows that? You think anyone cares to type that out even if they did?
---
Yeah you're right...sad but true.
---
best part of tanking as a paladin is just putting salv on problem dps, and if they ask for wisdom I can just tell them they couldn't handle it
---
I am not 100% sure this is the case in classic. I feel like I have had times where I aggro and the tank taunts, I stop attacking, but then the mobs goes back to attacking me after taunt is over.
---
&gt;JCing
---
fourth time posting this?
---
Alright, but are we not gonna discuss that flipped undead’s mouth right now?
---
Not if you stand behind the boss, which besides Ony (And Rag sometimes) you shouldn't be. Also, if you get parried while dpsing it increases the bosses attack speed, so, no. It isn't random chance.
---
&gt;I only hope I can find some new friends to share it with along the way. 
---
There are so many guilds willing to welcome people into their fold, I'm sure you can find one that fits you :)
---
I had to reupload sorry baby

What server are you on bro? You always got fam in Azeroth!

Every time that I see a character with that name I ask the exact same question haha

Essentially. I charge, hamstring, run away before the mob can hit me. I run back, hit, apply demoralizing shout, run again. I run back hit, sunder armor, run away, repeat until execute.
---
I mean the game was literally designed 15 years ago for people who are new to mmorpg's. So it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Especially with all the guides aviable to you nowadays.
---
it’s handy when you actually want to PM someone with an accent, or if you want to search a name with a lot of accents in or out of game
---
Yeah, but to be fair, didn't they turn into fanatics by getting bamboozled by a dreadlord?
---
:( Sorry to hear that, Alliance Whitemane. PM if you're on that server, we got a good guild going
---
poop pope
---
I wanted to retrieve my account from 15 years ago. I called them. They had me confirm my old email, person details and some questions about the realms I played on. I had it all back in 30 minutes.
---
They could help you fix this by just calling customer service I would bet. Seems faster
---
Ignoring abilities, 25% chance to crit with a 3.5 (average to fast) 2H means approximately 1 crit per 14 seconds.
---
25% chance to crit with a 3.0 MH (super slow) and 2.0 OH (also pretty slow) means approximately 1 crit per 4.8 seconds. 
---
Not including the dual wield hit penalty or anything, but it won't bridge the gap THAT much.
---
I also leveled Prot. Mostly because my guild was very active and always in need of tanks for dungeons. Funny enough one of my best friends who I always quest with is also a mage.
---
Just curious, is that calculation implying that rend lasts for its entire duration?
---
You really need to do a few lines of coke to complete that look.

Same. Ally rates 500g. Horde rates 250-350g listings.

I remember getting mine back in vanilla, when it was just 1 item that you could click to swap between bow/stave. Think i still have them in my bank on retail.

I'll not be doing that one again haha
---
You know just as well as everyone else that OP was reaching for some sweet karma with the guild name.
---
I am 100% certain without a doubt that special characters were not allowed in names when the game launched. If you don't believe me I suppose I can try digging up some evidence.
---
I got you fam.
---
I am playing a warrior. I would really like a macro that, if I'm out of combat i charge, but if I'm in combat I intercept. Ideally it would handle stance changes as well. Is this an available thing that can be done with macros or addons? Does someone already have this developed?
---
Why should server transfers cost anything ever? You should obviously be bound to your pick of type of server but why was this feature ever exclusively a paid function?
---
Allow a single transfer per paid sub once per month.
---
I thought the number was 9%
---
A time when Arcane Power/Fire was the build for leveling and frost was considered the worst because it was so underdeveloped.

Ok, all that aside, why didn't y'all just kill the dude again? The respawn is like maybe 5 minutes.
---
It's clearly a bug, and the GMs are just grasping at straws for something to explain it, but it's not like it was weekly raid drop. I'm a healer and did zero damage to Axtroz when I did this on Monday and got my skull, but we were a group of 5, not a raid of 6. That's prolly what caused the issue.

What is normalized:
---
* Pet Movement Speed
---
* Pet Resistances 
---
* Pets unique traits (Lupos shadow damage)
---
What isn't normalized:
---
* Pet Attack Speed
---
* Family damage/armor/health modifiers ±10%

BT will keep his 1.0 AS for the entirety of Classic, unless Blizzard decides to apply TBC changes.
---
Yea just found them too thanks! Now to go through his streams and find it i guess.
---
What the hell am I supposed to be looking at in this screenshot?
---
Oh I didn't even see it. That makes so much more sense lol
---
You're right. It can certainly, be a deadly experiance if a tank got unlucky and got hit by back-to-back crushing blows. Isn't that why you only pull a few trash mobs at a time and wait for healers to mana up before pulling more mobs? For boss fights, i can see this being an issue, but it's not a 100% occurances, and there are ways of reducing the chance of there being a crushing blow.
---
There's a stegosaurus embedded in the image??
---
Don't forget you can use lesser rank spells to save mana if you need to as well.
---
When they said WoW Classic, they meant it
---
so you're saying we should take pictures of our monitor with our phones then.
---
Not worth the effort
---
Was a pick up group that immediately disbanded after... so I would need to join another group and most likely start at the beginning to help out with all four dragons.
---
Paladins were originally priests so them being in cloth when healing doesn't seem odd, and the ones you see in Warcraft 2 and 3 were more akin too ret paladins.
---
try doublewide, it's great
---
Freedom of speech does not apply in regards to a company, and it also does not imply a freedom from consequences. I may not like their reaction to what the player said, but they are in no way infringing on his right to free speech.
---
Same same but different.
---
Follow up question, does she or any other faction bosses drop loot? Or is it all just for the glory
---
No, the problem with TSM is that it's missing the API in Classic. It's an incomplete addon in Classic and it does half the job.
---
This right here is something I always argued with the no life, err, no changes folks about. That fucking piccolo being activated in the auction house or bank was a pain in the ass. What retail did with it was the correct answer.
---
The player and the broad caster for it. Blizzard is in ten cents pocket, ten cent actually is heavily invested in western media by actually larger prevents so this won't be stopping any time soon.
---
Yeah it breaks stealth
---
Just dinged 41, I know it’s possible to hit 60 in 4 days played but then you don’t enjoy the levelling experience of the game. Presently I’m at 4 days played I don’t think 10% of your time since release is casual at all.
---
We can pray for classic+ so much stuff for them to expand on
---
You can't figure out how this relates to the topic? I guess you're proving your point of wow players being dumb as shit.
---
I can't upvote this enough.
---
I've got a feeling we are going to be seeing a lot more of these posts in the weeks to come. Listen, I love classic and I loved it the first time around but I can absolutely see how it doesn't fit in the modern "go, go, go, now, now, now!" play style that a lot of modern games, including retail, have now. In short, a large amount of people will be running out of patience with the tedious pace of classic and will be moving on soon when the novelty wears off.
---
TBH, a lot of people complain about the LFG, etc. But my personal main problem was neither of these. It was the fact on how it worked. Why did they have to give LFG groups a 15% stat buff? This makes no sense. It actively discourages premade groups.  Why did they have to give out points for going into a random dungeon that buys you items better than the dungeon holds?
---
The system of "I wanna do a dungeon" is not bad. The system of directly teleporting you there is kinda meh, some people like it, some people don't. But the point of a dungeon should be the dungeon loot... But 99% of the community didn't go into the LFG for the dungeon loot. They went in there for the points. Just like the LFR, people mainly went there for the point and if you make an LFR, why the fuck do you make some stupid ass lite version of a raid in there that can be done with 20% of the players actually contributing? 
---
If they had just made it "You can find people via this thing and get teleported to the dungeon" there would've been a lot fewer complaints comparing to "You have to do this, not because you want to do the dungeon or because you need anything from it, but because you get points from doing it".
---
Because it would take easily half the fucking playerbase away if you perform your "updates"?

There's this mechanic called "Parry Haste." It's not too noticeable, but after you or a creature parries an attack, your next attack comes 50% faster. This is a big deal if you have multiple dps punching a boss in the face, because the parry amounts jump up and so does boss damage.
---
This is such a lame generic response. So over seeing it.
---
Hope your boycotting the Chinese build phone and computer parts your using to type this bullshit on too.  Don’t forget the 70% of things in your home made in China or with parts from China.   What a noble stand your taking...
---
OP I know exactly how you feel, it sucks, but...
---
They'll come back, and when they do you'll be there as an uber badass 60 to help them out.
---
Tanaris is oddly the only place that I see more alliance regularly. At 60 it always seems like there are more horde out and about the open world.
---
Wait I thought the inventory management was the game?
---
Feel like you're going slow? Go buy a better wand in the AH! All drop at 100% in the AH!
---
Yeah. It's been a couple of months but it's still really hard. Watch your little doggos if you live out in coyote country y'all.
---
I have friends that did this too, I truly don't understand how somebody can put the effort in to get to 40, then not bother pushing on till 60.
---
What a waste of effort, or am I the odd one out here?
---
You're about ready for dungeons, keep an eye out for groups forming for stuff your level. If you offer to heal then you'll have an easier time finding a group.
---
Well, what can I say. This is what works for me. I am sure I will find something wrong with your UI too. Its juat personal preferance.
---
Wait agi increases wand damage?!
---
Your reading comprehension is so bad it's actually kinda funny.
---
Oh. Now it does. It's the same company, and I don't support those types of values. I simply don't. I will resub as soon as they make up for this by giving out the price money that Blitzchung won.
---
man, i'm having a hellva time deciding what flavour of healing priest i wanna go with for PVE/PVP. i'm not sure if i wanna do deep Discipline for PI, or do something like 24/27/0, which would get me all the good talents, such as Martyrdom, Imp. Mana Burn, Spiritual Guidance, etc.
---
also, for shadowed unit frames, does anyone know where saved profiles are located? i looked in my retail folder, but i didn't see anything. no WTF, no nothing.
---
What about adding more lower level content? Doesn’t need to just be a race to the end. People are rolling Alts as it is, so why not add newer, more intricate, exciting dungeons at level 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 for instance? This influx of new content would perpetually keep people rolling new characters and enjoying brand new journeys and experiences without letting the game stray too far off the deep end.
---
I was a wrath baby and I remember buying the polar armor set and stacking more Stam on it just so groups would see my massive health bar and take me for their tank. Healers would have hated me if I had tried to actually tank in that crap. 
---
I used some of it for Hodir but by then I was a guild tank and could put on Agility enchants and gems.
---
I mean I use max frostbolt on my mage in the raids and don’t really ever have a problem with mana, you have robes of the archmage, mana Ruby’s and evocation at your disposal.
---
Its just Elvui. I modified to my preferance. Map is big cuz I have trouble following the map otherwise.
---
I'm on the same path. I was disappointed to see that there is no separate cost for epic mount training... Just expensive epic mounts.
---
 Anyone know when there will be cheap mounts and expensive training?
---
I can't DO that yeT
---
I really liked diablo 3’s approach to gear particularly how each piece has a stat range and the effects on the gear had a more drastic effect on your play style.
---
Really? Damn, my first goal was just lvl 20
---
I set the bar way too low
---
This is the correct take for healers, tanks and mages/warlocks maybe. Go to LBRS, tank pulls up a bunch of the mobs and the mages do their Frost Nova and AoE. Tank should just be spam healed when picking up the mobs and then stay nearby when the mages Frost Nova. With an ideal group, you can get up to 100k+/hour and each run keeps you under the locked instance limit. Got my 59-60 in a bit over 2 hours. Could've honestly done it from 54+ as a Paladin healer.
---
So what’s your 40+ spec? 2h arms?
---
Yeah, i've had to heal through a few of those in dungeons, i cant wait too see what a raid looks like.
---
Yep Blizzard went full Sylvanas.
---
These posts are generic karma bait that get deleted for breaking the sub rules
---
Theres discords for serious conversation and some of them got polluted with stuff like you mentioned.

I meant the sub cancel posts
---
Lol so your benchmark for successful human rights campaign is blizzard giving back prize money, but not actually anything concerning human rights improvement in China?
---
How does this work pvpwise? Can he be attacked by both factions?
---
I liked it as a warrior because I'd spawn it against another melee and kite them away before they realized something was hitting them/healing me. You could see how confused they'd get about whether they should ignore it or take the time to run back and kill it. Slightly better health than a totem tho..
---
Mage might be quite a good class for it too, it's heals aren't bad at all but it only heals you if you're under a certain amount of health and a mage can stay alive at low health better than probably anyone.
---
China rebuilt China. The US just turned into a failed ponzie scheme.
---
How do you set up your operation to avoid that?
---
I think it'd be neat if they did something like dazar'alor where you see the raid from two perspectives. Except instead of Horde/Alli perspectives you get a shared first half for Horde and Alliance with a section where you play as the Scarlet Crusade where everyone's characters get changed to look like a Scarlet Crusader.
---
so you secretly support the chinese AND ruin the environment? 
---
these modern commies
---
How are you doing? Most of ur comments on peoples threads seem to be negative.

You should check out [El's Anglin' REBORN](https://www.elsanglinreborn.com/).  They've done a really good job of restoring the info from the original site that's no longer available.

You will use a two hander tanking until ZF or even BRD at 50.

There are a few that should come with questing. There is a good 2 handed mace in Deadmines.

Back in vanilla I was in a hardcore raiding guild. My human war was top dps as Fury in BWL and Nax with Maladath and Chromatic sword from BWL. (I waited til all the rogues got their maladath first). I forget the names of the weapons exactly, but I remember  my fellow warrior guildies stop making fun of fury after a while.
---
Did someone say...
---
IOI
---
The decision on priest is relative to what content you're doing frankly.
---
Pretty sure I've had something similar happen to me and my friend.  We were in a group with us and another friend questing in Feralas and the chicken beacon dropped for our friend.  He was so far away we figured we didn't get it anyways.  Well ever since my friend and I have never seen that beacon drop.  Did every quest in the zone.  My friend even grinded the nagas for a couple of hours trying to get it and nothing.  Opened a ticket and they basically said to kick rocks.  
---
It's so frustrating when you feel like nobody is listening to your concerns.  I hope someone can help you out.
---
What does aux do to help that
---
My man!
---
Sure they are not infringing on his right to free speech. But they are supporting the human rights violations that happen in Hongkong. As a consumer it is his right to decide to not give money to a company that goes against his values. And this is the way to talk in general. If being pro China loses them more money than it gains them, then they will take a stance against China.

Oh, my mistake. Sorry for the smart assery.

Fury isn't very good until you can stack some crit, from what the warriors in my guild have been saying.

Sure, so you'll want to suck for about 40 levels, and then out-dps everyone if you can find a group that actually has a tank because all the warriors are arms :D

You’re not the only one. I haven’t had any issues until last week where I constantly lag out for a few seconds. Hoping someone smart can chime in with a solution

Nahh Tencent has like 5% of the shares. In no way is Blizzard in any way commanded by them. Hell Tencent holds a lot more shares on other games that are completely banned in China.
---
Good riddance. The less virtue signalling attention seekers the better.
---
At first I was sad to see so much misinformation and state propaganda against China pop up in my video game subs.  
---
But now I'm happy it'll make all the reactionary racists unsub and I won't have to play with them.
---
you could level almost entirely off of dungeons, teleporting instantly to and from the dungeon with 4 random other people. This strictly lost the community created on one Server. In classic your behavior with other people was remembered and if you were a dick by ninja looting in a low level dungeon, you might get recognized at higher level dungeons and kicked. But in retail, you never see those 4 people again good players or bad. Your actions didn't matter.
---
The mobs were so easy, scaled back in damage they did. Everyone wears heirlooms so that effectively makes your character +5 levels higher in power level, so you never needed to use all your skills, just pick any of them and press the button. It didn't matter. Also the experience required to level is so reduced that you blow through zones only doing 25% of the quests.
---
And because it was so easy, no one grouped together. It became a single player game; you saw other people, but it was non-interactive.
---
what a piece of trash. what server?

It’s literally pre bis...

---
This has allways been the case in wow for me. I allways tell them to give me new tactics like "P1 dps p2 dont stand in fire p3 watch out for debuff". Simple and effective, I do not need to know how much damage and the duration of a debuff is i just need to know the basics.
---
Reminder you are a fucking moron, Blizzard is dogshit and the game was full of bugs.
---
But you can set the reserve it's called "minimum bid"
---
10 examples of this happening over and over on my stream.
---
Hah, trying being a rogue, buddy! EVERYONE who can wear it wants that yummy hit and crit leather but I don't get any melee stat cloth gear to yoink from the casters! Unfair!
---
In classic, the amount of stats on an item can vary (for suffix items)
---
The quest *did* exist for a while in retail after vanilla ended, so it could be post-vanilla data.
---
Hell I always take rogues. Fucking level 52 rogues still get to number two on the DPS in a dungeon group. Meanwhile the mage sits around and drinks every two pulls. Because he drinks through the entirety of the second pull. So I have a mage who does do dmg only half the time and when he does damage, it rarely means much, because they always AoE which helps me as a heal exactly zero, because now it just means the tank will take more damage for longer, compared to the mob being focussed down single target, saving me mana, increasing uptime.
---
&gt; If being pro China loses them more money than it gains them, then they will take a stance against China.
---
That's what any company would do. That's why Google refused to work on a multi-million dollar contract with the justice department due to complaints from employees and customers. But then turned around and continued to work on a deal worth 10 times that to help the  Chinese Government develop a browser for use in China that would them to more effectively track and oppress their citizens. Its all about the benjamins regardless of which company is involved.
---
Maybe he consumed it and it's sitting in his belly
---
Classic has many psuedo-titanforge items, Archivist Galford in Strat live for example only has a 1-2% chance of dropping a cape wtih a good "forge" on it.
---
Well we all knew that a lot of people will drop out. This is why most of us took the long queues on the full servers after all. When I entered the Guild I'm in now and I spoke a bit with the leaders, I dropped that right now we don't really have any rooster fitting for raids, considering we only got like 3-4 healers who are even in their late 30s. (this was a week or two ago, so most a now in their 50s to 60). And then suddenly one of them was like "Wait what? We had like 10-12 healers who started the game with us"
---
Nope it's high. Multiple warriors using it also takes up multiple debuff slots.
---
Pre-prep is just prep
---
I met a priest today who was level 59 and had leveled entirely within instances. He'd get summoned there and heal them for different passing groups until he outleveled them, and then get summoned to the next one.  He gave me two great BoE blues at the end, just because he had tons of them from running them all the time.  At level 59 he hadn't even bothered to buy a mount yet because he hadn't walked enough in the outside world to make it worth it.

It even says so when you hover over the door. You need it to enter the keep, and then open the two doors halfway in.

The Transition into the better optimization of gear that was Burning Crusade occurred in Tier 3. For example, Hunter tier 1 and 2 have spirit and random values of strength, intellect, stamina and so on. Tier 3 has zero spirit, no random resistances and focused only on stamina, agility and intellect. Every piece has increases to either Hit chance or Critical Hit chance. Every piece ontop of the agility also gives raw attack power. Every Tier 3 set is just crazily better than anything else. A Hunter will go from 4K health to around 7K, coupled with 4,000 Aimed shot Criticals and infinite mana.

Thank you so much for the message, this seem to be my last resource... Would you be able to guide me about how to exactly do that on Windows 10? Thank you so much!
---
1. Get into a party with your bank alt
---
2. Clear Mara, log into the bank alt for 2-3 minutes until it gets passed party lead
---
3. Reset instances from your bank alt, log into your main.
---
You made a valid point. More than those people are canceling their sub because "my feelings".
---
did you level as arms previously? because if so, you aren’t forgetting.... you simply gain more rage by doing more damage. 
---
so if you are gimping yourself with prot talents this time around, and questing with a 1h weapon, it’s completely reasonable to be generating rage very slowly. i get enjoying playing prot, but to do it while leveling is a bit silly imo. you gain nothing from leveling as prot, while losing a lot. also keep in mind, you generate about 2.5x as much rage per swing when you crit, and arms/fury both have talents that will boost your leveling crit % *significantly*. 
---
but hey, do what you enjoy my friend. level as prot if you want. i just wanted to give you a heads up if you genuinely were curious why your rage gen seems so shitty.
---
I'm a level 19 Human Warrior, and haven't yet picked any talents. How far will I be able to tank with an arms build?
---
It isn't, it's the both tree. Arms is the PVP tree, Fury is PVE. Regardless of weapons.
---
I ended up switching to lock since I did not want to be healz.
---
Parry Haste was literally the reason I expertise capped in heroic ICC just for Sindragosa. I had a different set of gear JUST to tank her during progression before the buff hit 15% and I didn’t need to do that anymore.
---
If I remember right WotLK was the last expansion to have parry haste and only dragon bosses could do it still so it’s been a missing mechanic now for almost a decade.
---
No it still does not explain in what ways it is so much stronger than T2 or T2.5 gear and it also does not explain why it makes the game imbalanced. Sure, geared people make more damage, but this is kinda normal. If you looked at Wotlk or Cata, a full T9 player would absolutely end everyone that still used gear below Tier 7. So there is nothing special about it.
---
When did thor have those dope shoulders? I'm assuming it's from the rumored second thor movie?
---
I can add about 7 fights where feral druid tanks are better than warriors. Here's 1 reply noob
---
Ahh ok, so basically the gear class optimisation set in with Tier 3 making it so much stronger, as it gave classes exactly all the stats they need to have.
---
Makes me wonder how a restro druid is meant to go. You know that spec that has next to no offense.
---
Haha my thoughts exactly "HAHA WHAT A DUMBASS"
---
Meanwhile engaging in the same exact insanity
---
As a tank I'll often let dps offtank a mob they pulled aggro on, the only problem is if they use an iceblock or FD and suddenly their mob runs to the healer. I think the biggest thing is that if they grab aggro they need to move up next to me, not run around like fucking idiots bunny hopping and making me run halfway across the room to grab their trash.
---
Read another book.
---
Someone a while ago posted [this set of mail/plate healing gear for Paladins pre-raid] as an alternative to cloth healing gear. I know it's not optimal, but if I wanted to wear mail/plate for class fantasy purposes but still heal end-game, would this be good enough to heal dungeons/raids until I get tier plate healing gear?
---
IMHO at least in Vanilla these things added up to making a small but noticable difference between good and bad raid groups. Mages prepare water, Locks bring shards, Priests have candles, etc. In a good group everything is well prepared, while bad groups have to step out of the instance to port people back, waste time on sharing materials between players, lack buffs on their last tries of the evening, etc.
---
Well in our case it's a dental term (:

McCarthyism was more or less a myth perpetrated by the media. There WERE in fact a massive amount of Russian planted Communists in all levels of government, and McCarthy was doing the only thing to do in that situation. The media just ran wall to wall propaganda pieces to take him down, but because this was before the internet everyone just bought it.

I may have actually rolled lock instead of priest if soulwell was in the game.

Granted, i also REALLY  wanted to be a Dwarf, so i still might not have rolled Warlock...

I can keep aggro off a mage in arms spec while leveling.

so what do you expect them to do now? Just give him the item or what? before he even bothered to try a second time ? clearly the quest is not intended to be done in a raid group in the first place.
---
A warcraft anime?
---
Solved. Thanks alot, I wasnt sure.
---
Defiance, I assume. Probably getting ahead of himself gong fury prot so soon, but it a goof endgame raid spec.
---
Tac mastery is hard to justify giving up except when MTing. Although Defiance is definitely a great talent.
---
Pet In wow classic?
---
Ok how do I get into party with bankalt do I need someone else to invite?
---
People who are flagged for pvp cant get aura buffs from people who aren't keeps a groups from buffing the heck out of the only person who's flagged for pvp (that's the way I read it when someone else explained it)
---
Totem buff does not stack. If you put out WF totem and put on a weapon enchant like rockbiter, only rockbiter will be active. If you put out Windfury totem and Flametongue totem, only one of the two will be active at any given time for your group. Rogues poison for example does also not stack with WF totem.
---
Not to mention that you won't be raiding as an Enh. shaman anyway.
---
Yeah you need somebodys help for that part - but once you're setup you can do it alone
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I want Titan Grip warriors :c WotLK it shall be
---
It is a political stance. There is nothing in the rule referenced that bans political stances.
---
Is wind fury 2h fury better under hit cap?
---
Inflation from DM and as we approach phase 3, people may want to enchant their gear for BG and BWL. Getting to the trinket is pretty cheap, did it yesterday. Levelling beyond 265 gets expensive but I'll drop enchanting now.
---
The majority of the population doesn't watch anime, so an anime reference is obscure.  Make sense?
---
64 works again now.
---
Mehh just make two new servers. If they make your system, every single classic server will be dead afterwards. It is better to just have the remaining classic players play together and have the TBC players get together.
---
One of the problems with \#nochanges is determining if weird behavior like this is a new bug or intentionally replicating an original bug.
---
trash is just one hander, but its 2.7 speed. terrible for poison application, but when poisons are resisted anyways, i wonder of the proc is worth having it
---
Hunter Pre raid BiS, it's not ideal but he has just as much right to roll as the rest
---
I'm not defending anything, it was a joke..  I get what you are saying, it was flawed, yes, but it was saved eventually... Give it time, things end up shifting in favor of plate only Paladins.

If a healer uses 60 waters in an MC (that’s the low end) it’s almost 5 gold in water. Compare that to a mage taking 12 seconds to make 3 stacks.
---
Yeah I think a lot of us are in the same boat. Had two friends drop out and one of them before 15. Luckily one of my friends is still hanging on :). I think me being in MC at level 57 motivated him to power out his 50 to 55 grind.
---
I hit level 27 on classic then leveled almost exclusively through dungeons. The idea that classic leveling is some impossible task is so troll and wildly inaccurate. It’s a time sink.
---
”So damn cheap” i wouldn’t say. 15g/stack on my server currently
---
At least something is this picture is BiS
---
To point it not to motivate people to keep playing, but to get everyone to stop.
---
Actual talent trees.
---
Hitting max level being an actual achievement, instead of just a grind to unlock the hamster wheel of progress.
---
Actual PvP servers.
---
Actual battlegrounds.
---
Actual PvP gear.
---
No flying.
---
Ya, transmog and being able to do old raids/content was the only reason there was such a surge of interest in classic !
---
They could easily make this into a new Cash cow by going the classic + route.  My money is on them screwing it up the second they add anything new though.  They won't be able to resist putting flying in, or group finder, or other crap to appeal to the short attention span, play for 20 minutes at a time crowd.
---
&gt; Yeah this guys logic is terrible lol 
---
It's not actually. 
---
Levels 20-30 levelling is faster &amp; more fun dual wielding as arms with a slow MH &amp; the fasted OH you can find.
---
Spam Hamstring as your rage dump and between an offhand attacking every 1.3 seconds and Hamstring you proc Overpower and Deep Wounds every single fight and deal way more damage.
---
Were you actually scammed or is this sarcastic?
---
Retail GM?
---
Everything is in a spot that draws your eyes away from the game. Nothing really scales properly either. Just very odd looking.
---
I wouldn't call it overpowered or imbalanced. It just is the only tier that actually matters. It was released before TBC and that's when the gear started to actually have better stats and more meaningful stats for each class. I am so excited to play classic but God some of these items you get just seem so pointless.
---
I play a 60 druid tank on classic. I just main tanked MC. Tanking isn't hard... but the serious lack of raid gear for feral is so demotivating. There was only one other druid and he got like 7 pieces of gear cause its all for resto spec.
---
My 60 is a disc priest and personally I'm happy to maintain PWS/Renew on locks
---
Your post gets deleted after 5 minutes if you don't flair it, such are the rules. I think Media is the better fit for an image post that isn't a joke.
---
Bank it. DM will bring inflation with it and as people get their mounts and BiS sorted, they wi focus on secondary goals such as reputation with other factions
---
Yep

I just pulled dog into frost trap and ran until he was off screen and he reset lol

Should have rolled rogues!!
---
I understand that. He was saying "re-charging" though, and a good rogue would never let a warrior use charge. He probably meant intercept, but it was never mentioned. Only wanted to point it out :)
---
Same man..
---
Generally speaking you can tank at 60 without being Prot as long as you have tank gear.
---
Sexy af
---
Looks like sword art online. Don't be fooled: it looks good, but it's really shallow...
---
I know you dont want to hear it but this was exactly like that in vanilla too, if you as a healer kept max range to your tank your heals would not count BUT HERE IS THE TWIST only if you do it in a RAIDGROUP, the moment you just do it with 5 people in a normal group which is more than easy to do those drakes arent much of a challenge (the ice dragon is probably the most annoying one) you would get credit.
---
So if you do it in a raidgroup, as a shaman I would suggest drop a flameshock, put down your firetotem and once the dragon is on less than 10% might cast a chainlightning onto him.
---
This also happens btw if you are a hunter or warlock and only put your pet onto the drake but doing no dmg yourself.
---
Vanilla is strange, which server do you play on? We can push you through the rest of the quest with out guild
---
That's just straight up dumb.
---
It's not an amazing skill but it's still important to use and can save your ass in tight situations where you have the spare rage for it because you're gonna die.
---
There are still a few quests where you need to be a ghost.
---
Not pictured is him joining our group (which had been going for several hours with the same people at that point) and saying that he was "just there for arena, not hoj since DM comes out like next week"
---
Yeah sad...bit at least some good people helped :)
---
People have been reporting short bans for even doing that. At this point I'm not really sure what is and what isn't considered an exploit by blizzard.
---
As others have said full demonology isn't necessarily ideal for leveling, but I'm doing it anyway because soul link seems fun. One thing I've learned is that the blueberry can tank fine if you're only maintaining corruption and curse of agony. It will take twice as long to kill anything with this approach, but it's very safe as you won't be losing any health or mana - perfect for STV where you might get ganked while questing.
---
Mind if I intercept here for a moment? These puns are making me go Beserk
---
it's not unfortunate, it's inevitable.
---
how about not dragging blizzard into this thing?
---
Wow, your UI is so clean. What're you using?
---
Oh really!? Isnt ir one hell of a grind though?
---
It's not aggro, it's survivability. I can last a lot longer with 3-5 mobs and she can take them down quickly.

Not saying it's optimized (see below), just saying it's fun.

Tired of seeing this shit, you people posting your posts trying to farm karma is not going to help the people of Hong Kong. Boycotting blizzard will do nothing to help Hong Kong... only thing that will help Hong Kong is a full blown violent revolution and that will cost millions of lives.

You joke about it but it bothered me so much that my first 2 mooncloth bags were made by different people that when I went to upgrade my next 2 bags I instead bought 4 traveler's backpacks and sold the mooncloth ones I was using.
---
Yep, I've been tanking since level 13 as arms, and not with snb either.

If someone is AFK in the inn in ratchet you can stand on the hill outside and snipe them without triggering guards.

To be fair, ignoring pets either for healing or buffs is very annoying for a hunter given they do up to 50% of their DPS depending on spec and encounter

It's [Bagnon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon). There's also [Combuctor](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/combuctor) which is the same add on but with a classic skin.
---
That could be used for a scam.
---
Agree to sell 5 stacks over /2. Put the first 2 stacks as devilsaur then gorilla shit and see if the guy picks up on it.
---
Except for all the BOE almost-best-in-slot items that will flood the market and tribute runs.
---
Those things will definitely impact the economy, which will impact everyone pre-60 much more than the 10-15% that are.
---
How? Mats. Many people are pre-60 simply to time constraints. We have jobs and commitments now and can't play as often. So when we play, we tend to quest and dungeon and try to level. In order to try and keep our professions up to date, we buy mats off the AH so we don't need to spend time grinding and lose time levelling. Right now on most servers, mats are a reasonable price because *we're all broke*. You can reasonably keep your professions up and level without having to commit a ridiculous amount of time to the game.
---
Once the top 10% of each realm have DM on farm, there will be an unexpected and unprecedented amount of gold flowing into auction houses that are less than 2 months old. Mat prices will explode as these people will have money to burn on mats and levelling their alts when they're not farming DM. Regular pre-60 players will be outpriced on their professions and will either have to level much slower in order to grind mats/money for mats, or leave their professions behind as they try to level and catch them up at 60.
---
Either way it's going to have a profound impact on everyone pre-60 in the next few weeks.
---
Didn’t know Dio was Santa Claus
---
classic+ isn't gonna happen unless they abandon retail activision blizz is too cheap to develop two games at once, they like classic because it was pretty much a one and done deal and attracts a bunch of subs that have cancelled over years. They don't need to do anything else to keep these people, people have been playing classic on p servers for years doing same stuff  have no doubt that they will stay on classic in a similar way. I would like for them to make an optional classic+ experience because I do enjoy regular classic and want a chance to play that, but that is even more unlikely. Plus i dont really trust  them too much to do a good job.
---
Wow that is one ugly fucking character.
---
Use a macro
---
&gt; If this weeks taught us anything its that Blizzard wants nothing but money. 
---
.... no shit its a huge corporation? do you think they are a bunch of altruists or something? only reason they made classic was to make money cause they saw there was a huge market and they were having to spend money chasing down p servers anyhow which became a mostly fruitless endeavour by the end as they were hosted in Russia which dgaf about that sort of shit.
---
Healers should only be able to loot friendly people when they die. Getting loot from kills they didn't help bring down is clearly unacceptable.
---
Leatrix I think has a setting where it will alternate both tracking constantly for you.
---
&gt; I'd love for them to roll the dice on classic+, but I think we would have better luck petitioning Blizzard to redesign retail WoW in a new expansion to have the classic features we desire.
---
that is literally what they are doing isn't it? I swear I heard something like that
---
I'll only call it lore-breaking when the paladin can wear cloth and still have the armor value he would have if he wore plate.

Okay I get it. But If you don't want to support a authoritarian regime like China's, then you should stop playing most games. Tencent owns/ has stocks in a lot of different games and game companies. Don't play any games with unreal engine cause they own 40 percent of epic games. Also don't use any smartphones cause they are most likely made in China using child slaves to make it.  Sadly, China is literally everywhere in the U.S. I hate them just like everyone else but think it's stupid to only shit on blizzard when so many other companies support china.
---
&gt; because he voiced his support of Hong Kong
---
That would be dragging blizzard into it. They rescinded support because they don't want to be involved in it.

yeah thats what i thought but that doesn't happen when i test it on other auctions

This is because it’s built on the bfa client and every item has a hidden itemlvl, when you right click on an item it will check which of your equipped items in that slot has the lowest itemlvl and swap that one.

I found another group and it went great :) I was even able to tank a bit because somebody had to go and it was easier for me to switch between tank and healer as a druid and search for a replacement that could do the other, depending on who was around to answer our LFG call.
---
Stratholme has two entrances, each with different bosses. There is a big gate in the middle of the instance which can be opened to connect the two (or maybe it's just a long hall full of mobs and nothing of interest except for way too many mobs; been a while).
---
One side is Scarlet Crusaders (live) hiding in a barricade church. The other side is full of Scourge and cultists (undead).
---
The last boss of Live side is the pope (but not really). The last boss of Undead side is Baron Rivendare.
---
Awesome loot drops in UD, as well as scourgestones/ Argent Dawn reputation.  
---
Righteous Orbs for Crusader enchant drop in Live, also there's Little Timmy.
---
Live side = living scarlet crusade, filled with mobs which drop righteous orbs.
---
Dead side = all zombies, skeletons and banshees ending with Baron Rivendare.
---
2 different pathways through the same dungeon, live ends in a scarlet monastery style area while in UD you deactivate “ziggurats” to unlock and then kill Baron Rivendare.

I just downvoted your comment.
---
# FAQ
---
## What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
## Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Unrelated to the topic
---
* Objectively not funny
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
---
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
Thanks. I always seem to need one, so if course it's a good place for them
---
People love telling you about their valuable farms.... that they're not doing.
---
Honestly just skip it. There's no loot worth getting and only a couple quests, it's nice if you can get them done but if you can't it's not gonna hurt you.
---
problem is you have to hit once to proc crusader and only the swings after that will get boosted by crusader, so if you open on someone with a reckbomb you won't get the crusader bonus
---
You should go straight down to feline swiftness before you put any into resto.
---
As for the feral/resto build - HOTW/NS is the build, someone else linked it already. But as I said get feline swiftness and then go down the resto tree until you hit nature's swiftness and swap back to feral for the rest.
---
Do not respec.
---
Gotta make sure their gear is stacked before allowing them to 2H tank. This is where it helps to make your own groups.
---
But that has nothing to do with crushing blows. It only has to do with overwhelming number of adds or magic. Getting hit for 50% more isn't going to global anyone, especially if you have 50% more hp than a warrior.
---
Oh if its the first character its a pain.. generally you need to have 2 or 3 normal ones before the special.  If people put it on first or second, that's on them and they suck. :D

---
&gt; all numbers wrong
---
One formula was formulated at per tick damage instead of DPS, the per tick damage was itself correct. The only error was adding that per tick calculation to the overall DPS calculation. You act as though this is some fucking disasterous mistake that invalidates every single calculation. Are you really that stupid?
---
You obviously can't count for shit or have any idea what 'all' means. You can't even proof my formulations on the coefficients. You keep pulling general statements without proof out of your ass. Show me the fucking numbers if you think it's wrong.
---
&gt;not understanding fundamental concepts of your own calculations
---
Yeah, this is you buddy, not me. I obviously understand the fundamental concepts of the formulas because I wrote them out from scratch. How fucking retarded are you? You're an imbecile that isn't even able to check my formulas and show concrete proof they are in error. Until then, shut the fuck up.

Man I remember when I used to play more in the early days of wow the gm’s were so chill and wouldn’t think twice about awarding a quest item like this. One time a gm have me 7 free days of wow just because I asked.
---
So did I when lvling. At 60 we can hardly find any.
---
I would pay to watch a warcraft anime in this style any day.
---
Pretty sure the beacons are not group loot
---
Can you explain what MS &gt; OS means? 
---
Nowhere close enough to 60 to raid yet but every time I see one of those raid LFM on LookingForGroup I have no idea what I'm looking at.
---
I keep seeing this debate actually for end game anyways. Some swearing using a slow 1h offhand is just fine others say its a horrible idea. I honestly don't remember if it's okay or not. I know the BiS lists show DB main Brut off as my bis for DW Fury (Unless I have Flurry as an orc). And Brut is slow. Then by BWL you're using two 2.3 speed axes anyways. I think it's actually fine either way right? It's been -so- long that I struggle remembering.
---
so, 3g or less if you plan ahead and bid low per raid to do more damage?
---
But he says there are fights bears shouldn't tank? Isn't that wrong???
---
Top o' the mooorning to ya
---
It's because of mortal strike vs bloodthirst  
---
Mortal strike cares about your main weapon damage so it's better with 2h   
---
bloodthirst doesn't, it deals damage based on attack power.    
---
There probably some other reasons I guess
---
They love you in that tunnel
---
This is my alt, /u/gertiegirl is my main

Depends if you're horde or alliance. As horde I'm often getting moments where I swim in rage on bosses. Unfortunately I have to use cleave as heroic gets too much aggro half the time.
---

That math doesn't seem right but I'm not great either so it's probably a little right.

Just wanted to chime in as another prot-loving warrior whos leveling solo without questie. It really aint all that bad, sure you die if you dare pull more than one yellow mob, and you really dont do much damage, but ive had a blast leveling up to 51 so far and it only feels like its getting easier at higher levels. 
---
My lowest point was on day 1 in the barrens. I was doing a kill quest for some of the quilboar and was down to just one more to go. I got unlucky with misses and ended up dying 1v1 to a yellow quilboar 4 times before completing my quest.
---
I think as long as you found a good accessible but rarely traveled place, 24 hours would be no problem. That's a lot of area to cover for only 30 people.

---
with the new patch it did it for me to automaticly now
---
No, it’s not. Most raids will have several tanks and  both bear and warrior tanks offer some specific advantages over one another.
---
It’s not just a question of gearing or threat but mitigation with certain fights. Bears cannot use last stand, shield wall, or consumables without breaking bearform. They also cannot parry or block. While the extra health and armor is indeed a great advantage that bear tanks have, sometimes you’re just putting your raid group of 40 people at a disadvantage by not utilizing a warrior’s toolkit.
---
On my warrior, what are my hopes of maintaining an arms pvp spec and going into raids? How much would my dps suffer? I wouldn’t use Mas just whirlwind. I am a horde orc . And I would also conceivably be a primary non prot off tank. Is this doable?
---
I noticed the same thing last night.
---
Main Spec over Off Spec.  Or put another way, whatever you're playing as NOW is what you roll on.  So if you're playing as a DPS warrior, don't roll on a shield against the tank.
---
For swapping to a shield and using a shield-related ability use: 
---
\#showtooltip Shield Block
---
/cast Shield Block
---
/equipslot 17 Seedcloud Buckler 
---
For swapping your offhand to a 1h from a shield use:
---
\#showtooltip Stinging Viper
---
/Equipslot 17 Stinging Viper
---
That looks cozy af
---
its a quest mob like any others, we had a few people who basically showed up as it died and were able to loot it despite doing no damage

As someone who's been trying to lvl my tailoring and refusing to pay a ridiculous price for this pattern on the ah I am glad that there is one less qia farmer in the game. I've been levelling through winterspring and every time I go back to the hub I check her, she's surrounded by at least 6-8 players all day long. 
---
I even logged on in the middle of the night at 3am to check for the pattern, and she was STILL being camped. I have started taking screenshots at different times of day as the same players seem to be making return appearances, I've also seen the same players selling them on the ah. 
---
I will report the majority of these players that I see camping the vendor, as this just completely sucks for someone like me who just wants the damn pattern to lvl up my tailoring and make bags for my alts when people are just being lazy and greedy. I've literally got no sympathy for you at all. Just pure greed.
---
If you're horde dump your rage with hamstring for more windfury procs.
---
And where in dungeons do you need this extra survivability exactly? It’s plain wrong that you need tons of buffs for this spec

I got busted later on but get to stay in the guild anyway :)
---
hey what chat add-on is that that gives a symbol and their level next to their name?
---
Main spec &gt; Offspec. So items for someone’s mainspec gets prio over someone rolling it for a offspec.
---
A big one isn't necessary, and little one lasts an hour so if it wears off you can throw another one on... mages also have ice barrier and can throw fire ward up if necessary. 
---
A health potion is like the last possible option for a mage to use, and only even useful when being attacked by shadow or holy magic and your ice barrier is down...
---
or just stand near the axtrox spawn and spam LFG axtrox
---
Cool sword bro
---
&gt;clearly the quest is not intended to be done in a raid group in the first place.
---
thats why it says (Raid) next to it?
---
what pro needs to check where he died ? haha
---
Then why not just add a dungeon finder or flying mounts for convenience right?
---
They are, my grp all picked it up from same mob yesterday.
---
How many alliance are left on that server
---
Haha this reminds me when Thunderfury first came out. Some of top players at the time were specced into Arms as 1H, simply for Sword Spec. It was a weird 26/25/0 build. All because TF Proc'd off everything including itself, and it did the most nuts damage. This was also back when sword spec, sweeping strikes, and windfury werent nerfed either so youd just see a warrior with it doing more damage than the next 10 top DPS put together.
---
Huh, TIL
---
It’s not fine until Naxx lol, we use fury builds already. You need it to hold off DPS at every level of progression, you might keep a shield on at times however.
---
Ouch
---
This is my favorite joke on all of reddit.  I am trying to give you a gold, but I am too much of a boomer to figure it out.  Cheers.
---
Impressive. Nice work!
---
Why do such lazy/incompetent people get a job as Blizzards "community managers" in one of their biggest games? They clearly didn't even read what you were saying, or their knowledge of the game is so limited they failed to fathom it.
---
Dude...
---
Archivist Cape of Healing says hi! 
---
(Im a resto shaman)
---
Given a fixed AP, every %-point of crit increases your (white) DPS by the same, absolute amount. What 'diminishes' is the *relative* gain in DPS, which is what usually happens when you sum absolute values, each value adds a smaller *relative* gain.
---
AP behaves exactly the same: Fixing all other stats, every point in AP will increase your final DPS by the same, absolute amount, meaning the *relative* gains will 'diminish'.
---
Thus there's an AP:Crit ratio at which either stat brings you higher relative gains. You want to balance both stats as close as possible to this ratio.
---
Might get a ban.
---
The mage LF Jed rofl
---
That is not possible, no.
---
LF Jed anyone???
---
Thanks for confirming idiots exists
---
That's why we have the instances. Questing is done best by duos. You have more dps, but at the same time do not required to make thouse "collect x of y with z chance of drop" for too long.
---
Yes at the end u still need some simplifications, like standing still, but as these factors are always present during the same fight you can ignore them.
---
e.g phases where you have to move you can ignore as you will always do 0 damage during that phase.
---
I think the only simplification that i used that can have an impact is ignoring mana and mana regen, but even this can be calculated separately when you have the theoretical dps. I think my table started something as well, but i am not sure how far i was with that part :D
---
Ans mana is only in some long fights a problem when you are to lazy to use mana pots.
---
Small price to pay for karma in the right subreddit.
---
My dream for a Classic+
---
&gt;90% of people that do the ignore thing already know that there is at least a 50/50 chance whatever they are complaining about is something that is their own fault and they just want to vent and not hear about how they are an idiot for fucking themselves over.
---
Funny, I usually ignore spammers. especially if it's just unrelentingly lame. Not sure how their being an idiot screaming about anal \[rupture\] or that they \*really\* \*really\* need that tank, in trade is even 10/90 chance of my fault.
---
Fun post to read, glad you’re enjoying your time ;). It sounds to me you’d greatly enjoy rogue.
---
Can melee get properly hit capped so there's 0% chance to miss, or is it like casters where there's always 1% miss no matter how much hit gear you stack?
---
No enchant yet.... pshh
---
Get some greater arcane elixir
---
You will not be able to take your character to current content. Classic and retail are too seaprate games. 
---
If your question is, what will happen after all classic content is consumed? then there will be the start of the movement of what the people want next. Which I personally think it will most likely be TBC as Vanilla and TBC were the two phases of the game where it was at its greatest.
---
Shoutout to all the buffbots-- I mean pallies out there, thanks for making us stronk &lt;3
---
What’s this we shit , you do what you want the rest of us will do what we want
---
Stop being a tit.
---
I took the jobs herbalist and alchemist, so that fits.
---
I actually thought about slaying wolfs for their meat. It's the only thing that gets sold immediatly. Is there any reason to that?
---
Do I have to be alive for the whole hour that I’m hiding?
---
I would also recommend you particpating in as much PvP as you can. Once you get into that it will really bring the game to life for you and you will find so much to do.
---
So i realized "Oh shit my sub runs out today"
---
So then i bought a new subscription, and then I got dc'd and now i cant log in and it says "Active game time is required in order to play WoW"
---
How long should it take for me to be able to play again? :(
---
Tell them
---
You are from China they will soon fix it and probably give you a reach around
---
Havent seen these more than 100g on my realm, they seem pretty shit considering you can get a quest ring with 18sp and a green world drop with 13sp for like 15 gold on the ah.
---
"Camera distance zoom factor" does not save for me if changed through /console command beyond what interface options allow normally. But whatevs rly, I just have macro for it and I don't need the camera to fly up in the sky ALL the time.
---
OG vanilla fury warrior here.  Wait until you get AQ/Naxx gear- dual wield becomes so much fun.  Fury was way under-appreciated 13/14 years ago, it only became a memeworthy and notably op to the masses when everyone and their brother made fury warriors on the private servers.  Also in the first few patches in vanilla launch it was completely garbage.  Enjoy.
---
Amazing how people suddenly give a shit about china
---
Beren 's wet dream?
---
What's lock?
---
Yeah that’s where I’m getting confused I don’t understand how time correlates to damage on a weapon I just assumed when it said weapon damage it rolled a number between whatever the min and max damage on the weapon was and went with that.
---
I’ve never understood why swing time is so important on weapons thought you just wanted high top end damage which comes from slower weapons for fat crits.
---
In a dungeon: Yes I will buff your pet    
---
In a raid: Suck it. Not wasting time to buff on a non-entity that's getting splattered seconds into the fight.
---
Nah, we're on the same page.  I'm 10 days /played on my level 45 feral druid, so I'm about as far as you can get from a min-maxer :P
---
But if I were, I imagine the grind to get Generic Gauntlets of the Monkey from LBRS doesn't look much different than the grind to get Titanforged Gauntlets of Whatever from a M+ cache.
---
Could you link the video please? I'm struggling to find it
---
TBH I wrote the above post while forgetting that windfury totem exists (I play alliance). 
---
Heroic strike is going to be slightly more damage. But as you pointed out, it's unrealistic to be dumping it because of the extra threat it generates. Hit hamstring instead of cleaves though, it's definitely better than cleave.
---
Think you can still get at least few days of gametime just by asking.
---
I've done it few times in the past few years and got 2-3 days everytime.
---
Brb, buying 10 lottery tickets
---
Indeed... If you value Karma that way.
---
That means I can skill up a shadow priest and still function as a good healer in dungeons?
---
I just hated the griefers in winterspring.
---
&gt; that gets broadcast to **other users of the addon**. 
---
See the problem here ?
---
I tested puggle yesterday and i really like it and will keep using it until i get 60 and switch to retail again but i can't understand why most classic players are so defensiv against any minor change that doesn't impact anything negativly. It would make trade and worldchat more usefull.
---
Some people here much rather suffer instead of geeting cured by something NEW that wasn't available 15 years ago. "Changes are bad period" thats there attitude.
---
This isn’t Wldhammer!
---
While heroic strike is queued your offhand hits as if it’s a special attack as well, dual wield is pretty incredible for warriors because of that.
---
ANuStart
---
It's stupid to think that this is essentially level 1 gear on retail.
---
grats my dude.
---
That happy birthday card is the best thing in the picture :)
---
Exactly
---
I kinda hit a wall at 42 lvl too. 30-40 was easy, so much gear drops for tanks in SM, so it was really easy to find a group. No one really wants to do RFD now, and I’m not high enough lvl to move to the next dungeons. Now really sure what to do know, I don’t want to quest in STV because obvious reasons, and I’m not high enough lvl to go to Hinterlands. Probably just gonna grind mobs when I have enough rested xp.
---
most GM's have never even played the game, they have no clue how its 'supposed' to work.
---
Understood but people will still be buying it and there will be more money around generally due to DM.
---
He was referring to all those posts of in-game situations posted using phone camera. Btw I also plan to do this quite soon 🙋

How is trying to harm Blizzard related to hong kong protests ?

There is an addon called Move Anything that might be able to help.

Wow, swear that list had about 8 people on it ladt time I saw it!

So you’re still reading
---
Some say he's still playing even now.
---
Obligatory "she" in case
---
It's xLoot
---
What he said, but I'd add that OP could consider taking fury talents and still rolling with SnB. Also shield spikes are a good investment.
---
The cap still has a 1% chance to miss that is always there.
---
Found you
---
I suppose it's the bigger numbers, at least that's what I went for in the auction house. If not the prices will probably go up by next week, so there's probably no risk of buying the higher amount, really.
---
or alternatively we could just play TBC
---
I did the opposite when WotLK launched. I was slightly ahead of the level curve, so I could fly in Northrend before most others, and the ones that could fly were busy leveling. So I flew to Ice Crown, where I was the only person besides some power levelers who tried to get the server first achievements. The whole place was full of titanium nodes. Thanks to that I was the first player on my server who built the chopper mount.
---
wtf you talking about "great depth"? you fucking troll! i'm voicing my opinion, and the point is: YOUR UNRELATED COMMENT DOESN'T MEAN SHIT!
---
That's very server dependent. On my eu server light and medium leather has been really expensive on the AH. 
---
Guess many are leveling professions after hitting 60 so buying mats instead of farming.
---
Much more epic, and people were there to pvp, also you could wipe bi rwifs like this with just one group, ahh good times.
---
I went mining herb and I can tell you, I won't do it again.  By level 60 I got to 300 herb and 250 mining.  If you do one with skinning it's so much easier and less work.
---
A pro Hearthstone player from Hong Kong spoke out in support of HK protesters on stream after a tournament win. He was banned for a year, his winnings confiscated, and both Taiwanese casters were fired. People are deleting their Blizzard accounts in protest.
---
Nah I'm sitting here enjoying the artificial sense of superiority I have because I can yell at stuff to gets its attention and he can't.
---
It hasn't happened to OSRS and I'd say Runescape has far more egregious microtransactions than WoW.
---
Imagine playing bfa 😂
---
That makes sense. I just hadn’t heard any discussion as to if they were going to release tbc in classic, but I feel like if they released it just as they did before, it would be epic.
---
Wam. Bam. Blap. Dead.
---
PallyPower used to be a must have back in the day.
---
It was nerfed to the ground. Apparently hitting Ctrl+S was too much for most people.
---
I only just started, but there are a bunch of minigames, and new modes. I wouldn't say they are quite as multiplayer as WoW is but you still need a group to do things. Usually there is a dedicated world where everyone groups for different things.
---
Blizzard just get your shit together
---
You already lost and the game hasn’t even started. “Survive” in the title means not die btw
---
Yeah, I have a little bit of that too. I sunk some decent time into an alt on the opposite faction and now they all vanished.

What addon is that?

\[A\] &lt;Dark Tower&gt; - NA-Rattlegore PvP | Wed/thurs 7-11 CST | semi-hc | MS roll
---
Looking to fill our raid team! Molten Core day 1 TOMORROW (new days for this week only) and day 2 friday!
---
About us: &lt;Dark Tower&gt; is an Alliance raiding/pvp guild led by semi-hc, fair players on the Rattlegore server. We are raid-focused, but we will happily admit players of all levels to help our lower level guys.  We have all professions, so we always have someone willing to help out. We have a fun, active, and relaxed community on discord and we look forward to being AOTC as content is released. We need people who are willing to show up for raids and participate with the guild, be it running dungeons, farming bis or throwing together some wpvp groups. We are always running something! IGN: Tristen OR Shere     (we are the main two leads)
---
Raid Times: Wed, 7:00pm - 11:00pm CST, Thursday, 7:00pm - 11:00pm CST
---
Loot Rules: Roll on MS gear, MT and heals have prio for the first few weeks. We want everyone who is willing to show up to be able to roll! I like to gear out our raid team, versus gearing random pugs. Come join us and make MC that much easier!
---
Expectations: We expect our members to be respectful, reliable, and present. This means showing up to raids on time! We expect you to participate as much as possible, but communicate with us when required, no biggie!
---
Currently, we need guild mages, hunters. Most heal and ALL tank spots are taken!  
---
PM me soon, and join us for MC tomorrow! We'd love to gear you out with purples so that boss hp bar goes down faster!   ;)

I'm a pink-haired gnome rogue and I have /train macroed to my Ambush and Cheap Shot skills.. just for that extra PvP annoyance.
---
Nice. That’s always cool of them
---
When you say you were in a queue what do you mean? Classic doesn't have the more modern LFG queue system
---
Why is this marked nsfw?
---
I've seen people do hundreds of solo kills of the dragons to get that off hand with a shadow damage bonus. Not going to bother with that myself.
---
Two questions:
---
1. Is it better to sell in stacks of 1 or in stacks of 20? If I give people a good deal on either, it doesn't really matter right?
---
2. I just hit level 45 and I'm aoe grinding mobs as a mage in tanaris. How long should it take for me to reach level 46? On average. I want to make sure I am being as efficient as can be.
---
This. People put way too much emphasis on top BiS. The difference for locks between FelCloth robe (3rd BiS) and Robe of the Void (1st Bis) is marginal. Robe of the void has 7 stam more and 10 spell power higher than Felcloth Robes shadow damge. (there is a pet heal on cd too, but that sucks)
---
Felcloth will run 20-30g and Robe of the void is 180g for the crafting mats alone. Robe of Winter night (2nd BiS) is often sold for 100g.
---
People forget that MC isn't tough.
---
Doesn't greater blessings buff all the pets in the raid? Seems like a small thing to do to make hunters and locks happy while boosting raid DPS if just a little.
---
Here is what I recommend:
---
Join the a Raid and just state that you really like being a 2H fury warrior and that it will be healthy for the loot table as a whole to be rolling on 2handers instead of 1handers fury. That might be put you at a slight desadvantage in terms of performance because a properly geared dual wield fury warrior is better than a 2hander one however if you put the extra work and just make sure you are pushing your DPS as much as you can with consumables and being on point, they might really consider it.
---
So yeah in short just say that you wont be rolling on 1handers and instead you want to be a 2H fury warrior. It is a very solid reasoning I assure you, as that is exactly what am doing at the moment.
---
In the very end, it all depends on thr raid group you will be joinnig.
---
Does Retail WoW work? What about other 3D accelerated games? I am not really aware about the graphics driver situation on Mac.
---
Did you invite the same healer?
---
Yeah, someone posted it on this sub not long ago
---
easily whitemane. 50:50 ratio and insane pop.
---
I'm a combat daggers rogue, is it viable to use sharpening stones on my MH in raids instead of wind fury? +8 damage is no joke as a combat daggers rogue.
---
Yeah, I’m in a similar spot. I’ll probably give STV a try just because there’s a lot of quests there. If it’s bad, I’ll probably just grind too. Then around 45 I got my eye on hinterlands and tanaris.
---
I would love a WotLK where Ulduar and ICC are relevant simultaneously (although I'd rather have a Classic+ where Ulduar and ICC are relevant simultaneously).
---
As a hunter, yeah it probably is easier to go solo
---
The real use for this skill is to camp the docks at BB boat and distract the opp faction into the water as they run for the boat.  Far more beneficial rly
---
Got another in my guild just tonight.
---
It is not normal. It should take about 15 minutes to find a group for Ragefire Chasm, because it's in Orgrimmar, so there's a lot of players around.  
---
Are you DPS, healer or tank?  
---
How did you try to find a group? On General/Trade/yell/say chat?  
---
What exactly did you write on chat?  
---
What time was it?
---
The OP was a healer. In a group with the people fighting the mob. They did 18k healing, that is where their mana went.
---
You do not need to tag a mob as a healer in a group. Damage is not your job as a healer.
---
"Artificial"
---
Hence why I said in moderation. Running into a city and seeing a Dragon rubbing amok is a pretty cool and memorable sight. If he kills you a couple times, so what? It's a unique dynamic experience that you cant find in other games.
---
However, if he's there too long and having a major effect on the game then they evolves into "harassment" and should be looked at by Blizzard l, especially when glitches are involved.
---
Well he does need the gold to pay for the treatment of his wife cellinedion.
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Ruff...just how your mother likes it! HA!!
---
Because it was designed as a role-playing game, not an xp/hour-machine for your character.
---
Who is doing this and how?
---
I usually remember to buff all pets, including lock's.  Sometimes I forget though because I'm just a human.
---
Can’t use /who for opposing faction. I know it wasn’t explicitly stated in “game” rules but if hider and seekers are same faction, can’t kill
---
Imagine actually having that amount of empty bag space not being occupied with gear or other consumables.
---
As a tank I'm a bit jelly.
---
If you don't like updating your macros like me, you can use /equipslot 17 0 1. Just make sure yoyr offhand weapon is in your backpack, topleft slot.
---
(17 is offhand slot, 0-4 are backpack slots, 1-x are bagslots)
---
Eventually maybe, it was slated as a raid zone. Where you fall into the zone it has a green portal, also half way along the path there's another green portal. So pretty safe to say it was planned but scrapped due to time.
---
Good luck with that :D
---
Q#
---
7 Chars most weeks, an 8th and 9th sometimes. But yeah, I was nearly giving up
---
RemindMe! 12 hours
---
Oh man. I think you entered the instance thinking it was a queue. You create your own group before entering the dungeon. I would youtube it as it would be easier to explain and see than me typing it
---
Actual lawyer here working with IT and GDPR: They are not automatically subject to fines just because they fail to respond within 30 days.
---
You do however have the right to be forgotten, so I'd just send them an email asking them to delete all records of you (with the exception of anything they are required to keep under applicable local EU legislation).
---
They can however deny your request if it is obviously meant to make their lives miserable, which would be the case if you spam them with access requests.
---
Loving the set + weapon + bat, it all meshes well!
---
Well, when a mommy undead horsy and daddy undead horsy love each other very much....
---
Aurastone hammer, Salamander pants, Wild Growth shoulderpads, and Cenarion ofc.
---
Balance has some good hybrid specs, or were you talking about moonkin?
---
You're confused a little. People posting a ton of the same item by one and not in full stacks aren't doing it because they're scared. They are doing it using auctioneer or tsm, which does the posting VERY efficiently and easy even when posting one by one. You do it to have a higher chance to sell, i have been actively trading ah forever and it just simply sells faster. All there is to it, if you used those addons yourself you could buy those auctions easily too.
---
Every source I've found on this says you're right. Normalization just changes how attack power contributes to instant attacks. Here is the formula for weapon damage:
---
   
---
    normalized_damage = base_weapon_damage + (X * Attack Power / 14)
---
Where X is a coefficient based on weapon type, 3.3 for 2h weapons, 2.4 for 1h and 1.7 for daggers.
---
Before normalization this X was the attack speed so instant attacks for slower weapons got more damage from attack power making weapon speed extremely important.
---
After normalization the base damage is most important for instant weapon damage assuming the weapons are the same type.
---
Did the same on my rogue at  launch =D Got the entire set directly.
---
Yeah, I agree--druid is probably the way to go.
---
Okay. I’ll keep with this spec for now. 
---
When I hit 60 and start gearing, will this hybrid build be good enough for me to tank, dps, and heal as needed in dungeons like people say? (Although I primarily only care about heals and damage)
---
If I start raiding, will I want to be more resto focused?
---
Atal'ai Spaulders? Yeah bro, I've been at it for 3 damn days now. Best I got was "of the Whale" so far. Hope you have better luck than me.
---
Last time I tried that it buffed exactly that one pet. We already have Onyxia and MC on farm without those buffed pets. So it's not like we need it.
---
It's over Luthien! Horde Luthien has the high ground.
---
You can do it by discovering Orgrimmar
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ElegantTolerantWhaleRedCoat
---
You’ll need to be below 8xp to ding at the Gates. You can nibble this down discovering areas around Durotar and the Barrens 👍
---
The average player playing retail won't be playing Classic to the point where they would be able to vote, and therefore won't be voting on retail-esque things to be added.
---
It's pretty obvious how it directly relates to the topic at hand if you're not a drooling troglodyte.
---
This is where i'd waste all my awards.  
---
*If i had any.*
---
So pleased this wasn’t another quiver as melee weapon post.
---
priest/rogue love is forever.
---
Thanks. I hope you’re able to find your way back one day :)
---
Yeah that looks an awful lot like 30-39 SPriest/Lock bis to me. Hold on to it. Especially with DM releasing next week; there's going to be a LOT more gold in circulation real soon.
---
I think the change will come from the increased arcane crystal supply from nodes in DM.
---
I fully understand that all that leather shit is BiS for all melee classes but as a rogue it still gets me when a warrior or hunter wins something I rolled on. All I see in IF is warriors looking like rogues. All day every day.
---
How do you know when you're ready for MC/Ony? I just hit 60 and already attunned but not really sure if I know my gear is ready or not.
---
It's the same people who go on and on about the print screen button...
---
Got u. Grats, mate.
---
I think they do. Not real excuse not to do that (if the Paladin remembers)
---

It started halfway through wrath, took a bigger jump at the end of cata and just had more and more concessions as each expansion went on.
---
they know how to type it, let them type it to you and copy it. otherwise, add him to friendlist, the name will autofill even if the first is a special charackter, but you have to type that one. 
---
but if they want an invite, just let them /w you, why should you do the work if they want in your group?
---
/inv and sending mail is so niche for me and my friends, i can count the number of times i used /inv since tbc on one hand and i havent ever send mail to some1 i dont have already on friendlist. even then we mostly just trade instead of mail
---
Wait... what server was this?
---
even if the 30 players worked like a rescue team and walked azeroth in a grid system, i doubt they would find you in 24 hours
---
Also as an added note, Tauren can only learn to ride Kodos and wolves, NOT raptors and undead horses. This is a win on several levels to be honest.
---
In its day, it was king. Unfortunately, its day was long before 1.12. 
---
Weapon speed normalization was one element. With all the pugs going on in MC in Classic, getting an OEB, Spinal Reaper, or Bonereaver's isn't as difficult as it was in early vanilla. On my server in the vanilla days, the arcanite alone was worth 400g or more so getting the axe was usually 500-600g total. People would go after a reaper after their epic mounts were completed. Moreover, as it turns out, your first 12 arcanite bars are far better spent on a Lionheart helm which, as I understand it, is BiS for DPS warriors through all of classic.
---
Good to know thanks. Theyew definitely far easier to kill lol
---
You probably destroy everyone in pvp with that lol
---
Will do! Curious, how does DM increase gold flow? I a bit behind at lvl 44 but looking to increase my cash flow wherever possible.
---
aka he broke clearly specified rules and suffered the established consequences
---
Sweeping strikes whirlwind does more aoe damage.
---
Damn, lucky. I was hoping to get just as many for my 4h build.
---
I stumbled on the basilisk while questing in shimmering flats. A random hunter and I killed it and I won the roll for the sword. Initially I had it on the AH for 20g. It finally sold for 9.5g.
---
This is actually not true, normalization just made the attack power contribution to instant attacks not rely on weapon speed. This means base damage matters for instant attack skills.
---
I explained it in more detail above.
---
The server I am playing on is quite fresh, mc was only cleared 3 Id's ago and ich was lucky to get the first scroll that's dropped. My guild has a good communication with the other two guilds that are raiding mc at this point.
---
I am asking for TBC. That is the best wow version there is. Playing classic just while it is not out.
---
Leatrix map
---
Tauren can only ride wolves and kodos, however dropped mounts like this can ALSO be ridden.
---
"Long ago, in an ancient land"
---
I guess its because your graphics card doesn’t support ‘Metal’ which is what the newer game uses to render the game on OS X
---
On windows I think you’d be able to use directX so with the correct drivers it’d be possible 
---
Correct me if I’m wrong tho
---
I'm actually lvling a Warlock using drain tanking spec, even though I'm only level 29 I had a blast, but why is 38 so important?
---
What server are you playing on?)
---
As a warrior I hate you but grats nonetheless lol
---
This was actually one of the main complaints about vanilla pvp.   There are many people who wanted to focus purely on pvp and hated that they had to do pve to get pvp gear.   Also a lot of people that hated that you had to pvp to get pve gear.
---
Yeah 0/30/21 is fine all the way into MC and beyond to be honest.
---
I am tanking in MC as 0/30/21... then next boss I flip to heals so it's really flexible.
---
It's much easier to be a healer, rather than try to struggle and find a feral spot in raids! But for gearing and beyond you can stay as 0/30/21 and eventually transition to moonglow or something else if you are pre-bis and raiding.
---
Can’t you just add stealth to your command bar
---
Phew priest grind grats bro huge accomplishment
---
Welp, he IS right. Tauren can't learn to ride undead horses, however the undead mount from Strat doesn't require any special training. The training you got for your kodo would suffice for it. He may have been confused (maybe he WAS trying to get you to pass on the roll, but it's still possible he could have been confused).
---
Default emotes work as expected. Custom emotes will just spit out a generic "Xxsephirothxx is acting strangely" or some such.
---
Bro, Dire Maul comes out in mere days, you can skip that Drakestone nonsense and just do a Tribute run for Rog of the Ogre Magi. Also, Sublime Bracers, and not least of all the Felcloth Gloves. None of that ST stuff matters as much anymore.
---
True, I just made myself a pricelist now, and surprisingly got 2 high-end enchanter to agree usind it as well. I'm a gnome but in love with that shiny gold, time to get some! =P
---
Much love from sulfuras
---
What server you in?
---
What's the addon for seeing the marketplace price of objects?
---
Classic doesn’t have lfg buddy ol pal
---
Wow this is impressive mental gymnastics.
---
State propaganda against China? You mean news articles covering the Blitzchung scandal? The ones written in the NYT? WaPo? Covered by NPR?
---
10% is the maximun, it wount get higher
---
To be fair he DID say they all 'needed', so I'm assuming they all rolled need.
---
I have a spammable stealth macro that only casts stealth if i'm not already stealthed. Makes it so that I can't accidentally cancel my stealth if I spam the hotkey. This of course means I have to have the macro in an action bar. I have the hotkey set to &lt;
---
Yes you need to ADD stealth to one of the normal skillbars and then bind it to a key you want
---
New player here, why do you weigh AGI so much? It only gives range damage + dodge chance + negligible (or so I've been told) crit boost. It seems to me like I'd rather have more mana or health or anything, really
---
Pepitos 😭😭😭😭
---
Sulfuras, i want to transfer to west-region servers.
---
Could be bad lucky. But it could also be a  bug where the game is not recognizing your gear. Try unequipping and equipping your gear.
---
Ahh okey.
---
Well a tournament stream is for the game and not for missuse to spread personal political opinions. I gues the ban is ok but confiscate his won money is a big NO GO. 
---
Im not taking sites when it comes to the protests itself.
---
There was never an official announcement about it, so everytime you post this question, people will give their personal pref. I'm all for TBC aswell, some people would prefer "Classic+", and I've seen some people wanting neither, just an eternal Vanilla server.
---
it isnt. It only procs in melee
---
*facepalm*
---
I don't believe it gets any higher till honor and ranking system comes out.
---
Spells do not benefit 100% from spellpower. They all have a coefficient mostly related to their cast time.
---
done mc twice and the only consumable anyone used was fire protection pots and it went fine
---
I can tell the last 5 levels were a challenge. I switched away from some shadow to more holy for better healing in Dungeons. Questing never was that...'fun'.
---
If it's hard to see, my name is "stabbymcbaby" and their name is "msmcstabby".
---
Saw them yesterday while helping a friend quest.
---
This could all be bullshit and no one would even question it
---
Cool story bro, so where did all that gold come from? Because that's the question OP is asking.
---
You could do that in two steps with 2 castsequences, which only cast respectively when you're on battle stance or defensive stance. I'm not logged in rn but I have something rather similar I could send you when I come home.
---
I love how fast trolls recycle the same talking points. 
---
One idiot says: WELL HOW ABOUT YOU BOYCOTT ALL UR CLOTHES MADE IN CHINA
---
Then half of the comments use the same language. Nice job boys
---
Thank you! I like trying out stuff myself, but I'll definitely respec to frost talent soon. I don't have any haste going for lvl 60 anyway.
---
That is the dumbest thing I have ever read.  You were in group.  Never has the game ever needed you to be on the threat meter as well to loot group loot...
---
It gives it more power to the shot.
---
OP is on Faerlina, which means a gauntlet of death and dispair no matter which angle they approach it from. Still, WPL is pretty devoid of horde for the most part and is relatively safe compared to trying to sneak past UC.
---
Only for alliance really. Its not pre bis for hmhorde and DM comes out next week so he should never roll for it if s1 needs it.
---
Thank you
---
Hm ok... so I guess the problem is on Blizzard's side. Maybe because of the recent boycotts and subscription cancellation waves.
---
Sorry you have to wait!
---
Fucking Zoomers.
---
Once you get to a level with an instant cast (WW or 40 with BT/MS) a 2h will always have more opportunities to do more damage because of the instant cast being backed by a stronger weapon. While leveling especially dw fury is terrible and full of missed
---
Gear, mitigation, cooldowns, shield bash, little extra cc
---
Oh yeah, if you are progressing still and gearing people up and an obsidian edge blade drops yeah give it to a war and he'll use 2h for a while.  2h weapons are great for damage output and require much less investment into hit stat, so a warrior with decent gear and a fantastic 2h will do more then a decent gear war with dual wield.  
---
It will be a little while until people have enough hit for dual wield to just straight up stomp out 2h damage.  Once that happens then 2h just go to pallies and shamans for the most part, really.  Right now both will be competitive on warriors.  But say months down the road when every slot has those sick professor plums then yeah dual wield will just do better.
---
[ARCANITE REAPER, HOOO!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMAm7jT3YyM)
---
Hoj is bis for horde as well.
---
lmao you really gotta be a piece of shit to take this just for the 20 AP
---
How much slow is sufficient?  Could I do this with curse of exhaustion?
---
Currently maining an orc lock.
---
Wondering about what I should have as an alt.
---
Troll Priest or orc shaman? wanna mostly heal @60 with the odd respec to PvP a bit.
---
Hexenmeister
---
Even without the spell power how am I dealing less damage then the supposed minimum damage?
---
Based on your insensitive response like you're just an intolerant nerd who doesn't like dancing lol
---
i mean if there's nothing tying you down to a server its not a big deal, but it can be nice to throw a few gold to new alts to buy them bags and greens to get started.
---
i will say hunters on ally are probably marginally better because they wont have to compete with shamans for mail loot, but thats about it.
---
3 characters on one server. It never auto selects and never have for me.
---
Dals are nice, but you should focus on getting HoJ.
---
Play a warrior or a ret (most guilds can accept one token ret in 40men raids). Giving it to a hunter is called "trolling hard", they have better options and Ashbringer is completely designed for melee classes.
---
I got my first binding last week
---
Please make videos where you do this. This is just too funny!

With Spy, Unitscan, or even /tar macros? No way, it's too easy for the seekers. Without those it gets more interesting, but I'm still betting on the seekers. Try it if you doubt me: take 1 hour and go through The Barrens, the largest zone in the game. On a 60% mount you could cover every inch of the map, every cave, look behind every tree and rock, inside every centaur hut, the Razorfen Downs entrance. 30 playersx24 hours= 720 man hours. I believe it would be possible to cover every inch of the zones and circumnavigate both continents in Aquatic Form or using Levitate checking every nook and cranny along the way. 
---
But, assuming the seekers starting in Stormwind are Alliance and I am Horde, I would just run to Thousand Needles and accept the first Test of Lore quest which teleports you to the top of one of the needles. Alliance cannot accept the quest and I'm pretty sure pets cannot path up there.
---
At level 38 you get to train Rank 4 of Drain Life, which is the breakover point at which it does more DPS than wanding.  Also you get new ranks of Curse of Agony, Drain Soul, and Siphon Life.
---
The next big level is 40 because you can finally get Dark Pact and steal your pets mana instead of life-tapping between mobs.  Plus the mount is nice of course.
---
Yes all correct.

So DM is comprised of a few different wings. The northern wing's final encounter has you kill an ogre king. He drops loot, then another ogre comes running in to declare you king and spawns a big chest as tribute (so DM N runs are sometimes referred to as tribute runs) that has several more items. Hunters are able to bypass every encounter in the instance to reach the boss, and can kite him down solo and vendor all the drops. Since money from vendoring items is basically just pulling gold out of thin air, suddenly there's a lot more gold in circulation.
---
There are other means of farming available in the Eastern and Western wings of DM but as a hunter I'm mostly focused on DMN. I think as a mage you'll want to look into AoEing lashers in DM East for herbs.
---
True, but that moment you crit and something just has an acute existence failure. Also something dodging is way more a NOW you fucked up, moment (and then it parries and all of it is lost in an instant).
---
I also have killed a few higher level rogues when I was an Arms because of Overpower Crits into Execute crit for instant termination. Also Evasion is a damage buff for Arms Warrior. Overpower for days.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
No, I just don't like items that are purposely created for no other reason than to troll.
---
Unfortunately I lost a lot inbetween 2005 and 2007. Had to re-install a lot because of new hardware and totally forgot to save the screenshots :(
---
yellow hit cap is same for 2h and dw and both suck royally if you are under hit cap. dw is always better unless a) you have wf totem or b) your 2h is vastly superior to one hands
---
Yeah, probably. Pve content is nowhere near hard enough to tequire minmaxing. My guild's MC 2 days ago had one healer who was a lvl 56 druid in feral gear, and it went well.
---
mUh QuEen
---
There's still Dustswallow, Ferals, Tanaris, and Badlands. At 44\~45 you can start ZF.
---
honestly, do both. when it comes to leveling, tanking means keeping threat and a nice thing is that you can do it via dmg :)
---
swap to sword and board vs bosses like they say, or on larger pulls where you take a lot of smaller hits. macros are your friend!
---
Do you not know what racism is? Because it's certainly shameful.
---
I do agree that joke shouldn't be removed, and generally people are too sensitive about jokes, but come on...thinking people are different isn't racism, but treating people different is.
---
You basically want a slow main haind for your special attacks and a fast off hand for poison proccs/rage regen. The biggest confusion comes from the fact that dps and certain stats are always king. So if you had a weapon with 40 dps &amp; 2.6 AS and an other with 40 dps &amp; 1.8 AS then the 1.8 AS weapon will perform better. However if the 2.6 AS weapon had 10 dps more or had like +hit on it, then that would will perform better.
---
SoR Damage scales with weapon speed and not with weapon damage as far as I know.
---
I’m getting the hammer for AoE Farming and Steamroll Dungeon Runs without cc.
---
Yeah man, if you lose the roll, just gotta move on. Dwelling on that shit just makes it worse for yourself. And, whining just makes everyone hate you.
---
Some spells can have partial resists, others are binary.
---
For Frostbolt for instance, it is a binary spell and its chance to miss is affected both by the chance to hit from level and resistance.
---
Fireball, on the other hand has the same chance to miss, but takes partial resistance from fire resist.
---
Against a mob where you have 0 chance to miss, but it has 50% magic resistance your fireballs will do half damage, your frostbolts will do full damage, but half of them will miss.
---
&gt;+45 AP against demons
---
&gt;little to no demon enemies until TBC
---
Glückwunsch :)
---
Mana and pet management is a non issue. As you get to lvl 20 you'll use a succubus and drain tank everything. It'll be just added dps basically. Bag management is real though.
---
But you have a lvl 60. Just buy your alt 14 slots. And it will be np. And after that soulshards are only an issue for bagspace in raids.
---
Id say go for it. Keep your rogue raid ready, and focus on an alt during non raid days. Its the only way to scratch the itch. Even better, have a second account for alts. Thats what I do.
---
It's not obvious at first, but some items don't have a listing fee if they're posted as singles. Some cloth, certain herbs, etc are free to post. An even larger amount aren't free, but still cheaper.
---
Combined that with the fact that a large number of people use AH addons that let you easily buy up all those singles to get the exact amount needed, those singles will likely sell a bit faster too.
---
What rank mind blast are you using? On wow head none of the ranks do 467 to 494 damage (not that they ate always correct. Just taking a guess but could those numbers already have spell power factored in?
---
The boomers are really successful at convincing young people red dawn and the Cold War are still going on.
---
A feral... we don’t hug them. And I am them. :(
---
What queue? oO
---
Is this satire?
---
same level at least, but if you’re undergeared - damage and threat are gonna be shit either way.
---
Shooting like a 90s gangsta
---
Having a goal is fun. I used to gear up for every BG tier when levelling toons, trying for BiS for that level. The farming was fun. It gave us something to do, and it made it exciting when we got it. 
---
Retail has removed this aspect by removing levelling as a meaningful experience. You zip to max level, ignoring everything along the way. 
---
The experience of camping a rare or farming a particular instance over and over for that one drop is a big part of a classic MMO. Some people just enjoy the grind and time spent with friends doing it.
---
the paper roll next to the "gaming" rig ;)
---
yeah, its definitely worth using, but it's the healing as well as the DPS, as they're the same amount.  It's really nice to finish the fight with as much or more health than you went into it with!
---
If hunter pets are dying then your hunters are bad.
---
But gets you there faster since you can choose the best path so.. noob tip?
---
Zoid isn't a GM.
---
The hunter and hunter pet had me ded.
---
Obviously there is always going to be a mathematically superior spec. He's saying that it *feels* worse to miss a big swing than one of many.
---
This one is the one you should be going for pre-raid: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11923/the-hammer-of-grace
---
As long as at least 20-30 of the people have some decent gear and know the strategies they can carry the rest, if your worried about your own gear google some pre raid best in slot items for your class and try to get a few of those with priorities on items with +% to hit
---
Dropped in the Badlands from a Coyote. I know its not the sickest item, but for a level 38 its pretty neat. Gains every stat +4.
---
It’s possible that spell power alters the tooltip but that seems a little far fetched perhaps?  Not at my computer to test it atm.
---
You can do this by getting instance locked out also I believe. You can walk past the instance while not zoning in. 
---
I got instance locked out when I zoned out of BRD and there was 8 horde there. Couldn't zone back in lol.
---
You say 'they' haven't learned their lesson, and I repeat, how much of this is the CLASSIC team in specific? I don't give a fuck about the rest of Blizzard, so I'm not gonna lose any excitement for a project that has nothing to do with decisions made by people that are out of their reach.
---
One of my fondest memories from vanilla. Congrats man!
---
I did this almost weekly but never received a ban lol. People used to shout in chat "it's happening again!"
---
That holy nova in your bar triggers me
---
Holy shit, reading those responses was infuriating. Idk how many tickets I’ve had and gotten responses exactly like that for such a simple fix. The CS in blizzard is dog shit now and I’m sorry you got shafted by them also, even with the screen shot and logs to prove their “reason” wrong. What shitty fucking support.
---
Nah it's 9, but hoj doesn't have any hit rating on it anyway
---
I wish I could auction my light leather.
---
Like a Riposte!

Oh sure. I guess that's what I thought but I can see how my previous comment wasn't clear
---
Found the fun brigade
---
Have 4 of those in my bank, bought for 2g each
---
I had just finished running some SM by running the way you said, but I wanted the closer flight path of Chillwind Camp for convenience on my next runs
---
For offhand, you want to use /equipslot 17 [item name]
---
I haven’t figured out a way to make that work without having to manually change the item every upgrade though, which is annoying; hopefully someone has an easy method. For 1h/shield I was able to use /click and then put the items on my actionbars- that was simpler to maintain.
---
That is not how it works. There is a reason why everyone says you need an as slow as possible weapon for your MS. Instant attacks are made up of two factors: the normal base damage of the weapon and attack power.
---
And the normal base damage of the weapon is not normalized. For dps warrior it is always better to take slow weapons.
---
Good luck finding a tank
---
Hello! Can you set up Vuhdo for the incoming heal? Personally I can not, even with the latest version ... Do we need to install another addon? 
---
And if you don't mind, could you share your Vuhdo profile?
---
That doesn’t explain why I’m dealing less damage then the supposed minimum.  My mind blast isn’t having its damage reduced by 50% it’s simply dealing 5 damage less then what the tooltip indicates.
---
Ah but the actual description says their goal is to kill me, which they can't do if I'm already dead.
---
With around 150ms of latency you will be fine - in PvE. Warriors aren't that much of a constant key slammer class anyways

---
You simply don't use Stormstrike, it eats a debuff slot. Flame Shock is useless during the first two tiers of raid content. Totem twisting eats through your mana so fast that somebody in a pre-raid set that focuses on mana and regen will never have enough extra mana to use shocks, even while spamming mana pots and runes.
---
keyword "top guilds".
---
Most of you arent in top guilds and shouldent support LC.
---
That‘s weird. With the latest update it should definitely work.
---
I think it’s a late dungeon armor set scholomance? I just remember I used to really like the set but now I think about buying the leveling gear and spamming dungeons.
---
Thats why I always take the 5% parry when leveling. Such a great investment
---
Making low level alliance players shit their pants
---
This is basically how I played throughout the entirety of Legion. I raided tons with it aswell. Its really not bad.
---
My apologies, my mindset was entirely based on trying to level more efficiently, because I know warrior's are already difficult and slow to level, prot spec would only add to this. I didn't consider the experience was more about playing with your wife to help her out and that's the experience you're chasing.
---
I've never had a missus who wanted to play games with me, let alone like them. My most recent ex would play games with me like Smash bros and Mario kart, but not the games I play seriously like WoW classic or League of Legends.
---
I'm very happy for you my dude.
---
I’d hide under Stormwind 😎
---
Other people's in coming heal or your own?
---
And I'll share my profile when I get chance later today. I'm a resto shaman so if you're not you might need to rejig it a bit.

No tbh the fact you don't know about JoJos is actually weird since you can go to totally unrelated subreddits and still find people talking about it.

why harmstring over sunder?

Yup, I'm thankful for lazy people because they basically paid for my epic mount.

Yep it Releases on the 15th of October. I.E. next week
---
Rogues with shields.
---
While there's *probably* (maybe?) a high enough amount of players for *now*, I don't think Blizzard will even consider this, given their fear of spreading the players out too much.
---
Besides, you gotta admit, it's kind of a niche way playing. Most players create their character for the long haul and don't feel the need for F R E S H.
---
more hit and we slice and dice them into smaller dice
---
Might also be that SP is not factored in but the 25% buff is, as it's permanent (and not unequippable). As said, your tool tip number apparently is NOT the basic rank dmg of that spell, so something is amiss.
---
So both gms were retarted???
---
Have you tested your hypothesis against a formula that uses item level rather than level requirement?
---
How many times do you have that much rage to do SS MS/WW?

Says something about a faction when the smartest group are the overgrown cows who managed to build a defensible city without back ways in to assassinate the leader. 
---
The Orcs could be partially excused since a proper warchief would probably like the exercise once in a while.
---
What does “already attuned” mean?
---
As I said already - 15th of October. Check reddit / Forums and everything else besides your own opinion. You'll see the 15th
---
Wait, what do you mean by just asking? They surely dont hand out gametime for free for no reason, do they?
---
They want to group so they can leach off you

Considering his walking path, I bet alcohol is involved.

how did you even queu? there is no lfg tool and even if there where it wouldn't be available before lvl 15
---
Stop typing le mage...
---
1989 Tianmen Square Massacre also works. That boots them off their internet in any game.
---
This is not quite true...
---
(What your link says is correct, what you're saying in your post is not)
---
This is how taunt works:
---
1. It gives you threat equal to the person with aggro.
---
2. It gives you aggro on the mob (ie despite not having 110% of the current aggro target, aggro still transfers to you).
---
3. It forces the mob to attack you for 3 seconds.
---
Points to note
---
A. Part 3 is the only 'temporary' bit.  The rest are permanent.  You remain at the top of the threat table and with aggro until someone out-threats you (110% for melee; 130% for ranged).
---
B. If someone has more threat than the current aggro target (a ranged dps could have 129% of the current aggro target), you won't match them.
---
C. Using threat generating abilities before using taunt is a waste of time. Pool rage and use them after taunt.

Or waited for MoP classic+ if that would ever be a thing to roll monks.

Thanks everyone, some great advice. It is very daunting for me playing in groups especially when people have no patience.

Just got to 40 last night so will be using your advice to try get some more gold :)
---
Fun I guess? Why does anyone play in ways that aren't the best?
---
Give it salvation :)
---
Yeah, so cheap. I wonder how long his MC runs are.
---
This shit wouldn't fly in my guild.
---
Ya but with flurry axe SoR only deals like 30ish dmg. I thought maybe the lightning proc would 'out-threat' flurry axe proc.
---
Men to ladies?
---
Reminds me when I was in Westfall at like lvl 22 ish and a rogue got offended because I didn't group up. Dude, I was literally just farming mobs since I have completed all the quests..and not long after I decided to leave the place for him and go elsewhere anyway.
---
Cant think of any for loeer level stuff, or older raids, fatboss did raidguides dunno if they have any vanilla stuff, wowhead also has some written guides for dungeons.
---
As horde your first is ragefire chasm then wailing caverns/deadmines then shadowfang keep. Its generally group of 5, tank, healer, 3dps. Go in fight towards a boss, kill boss and repeat. Theres aldo quests for dungeons
---
That would be totally dope.
---
I really don't understand why loot has to be difficult - make a requirement, you have had to raid X amount of times to roll. First round rolling is for primary build, second round rolling is for off builds / respects.
---
Once you fulfill requirement you get to roll. As you do the instance enough everyone gets it from first round then second round.
---
Summoned? So he don't play instances until he found one group that has a warlock? That can delay the switch a little bit.
---
Nobody ever goes downstairs

that's wrong man, i've rocked the 2.2speed   2hand weapon from gnomeregan for a while and it certainly isn't normalised to 3.3
---
or world chatnnel
---
I would hide in ungoro in bush.
---
Yeah he says "Hey there".
---
Why? Not binded? Or useless? I mean I am farming some low level items with high price effectively with it :) and also with DM coming in a few days we can holy nova lashers all day long for some 25-40g/h (but we will see how much will it actually be). Where to put that 1 talent? imp renew? useless even more.....
---
10 days to 40 as prot? Slow down there neckbeard! Must have had a pocket healer, filthy casual.
---
*cries during solo grind as guildies level past*
---
not specific enough
---
The rogue blank at the end hahaha priceless
---
You just have an ugly mug, they see you and think: 'kill kill kill'
---
Yeah, so cheap and as a mage too, the easiest class to grind gold with. I wonder how long his MC runs are.
---
Check out this vid mate

---
I didnt have to kill any dragons and dont know any of the quests in that chain iirc. But i got the onyxia amulet and already did her once. SO whats the thing with the Onyxia attunement here?
---
Not with the "not-bug" Blizzard introduced. You can just Queue up HS and have yellow-hit modifier for your OH, then /cancelaura the HS before your MH swings.
---
You seem dumb.
---
There are tons of low level axes (at least on the Alliance side).
---
Ok sweet I’ll look into it. I appreciate all The help. I think when I do level him I’m gonna try to get a set for all specs. Im debating going lw and skin or alch
---
Took me around 14 hours over 2 days of camping to get Augural Shroud. 1.5% droprate of precisely 5 Nether Sorceresses.
---
At the start of every fight with one, maybe two autoswings.
---
3 more auto attacks everh 4 seconds will always outweigh sharpening stones.
---
Prioritize Whirlwind over mortal strike for aoe.
---
Why talk to us if you should talk to your raid council first?
---
It’s easy to look at Rag as easy in our current scope of classic, but, we’re killing him with optimized gear. Old Tier sets were so fucking bad that they weren’t much better than the greens and blues that the world firsts kill him in now.
---
Also, Spec trees were god awful in Early Vanilla compared to what we have now. Why run a Ret Paladin? So they can heal AND bring Blessing of Kings, because that shit was a 31 point talent. How about bring a Bear tank? Nah fam, Dire Bear form gave 180% armor back then! Well at least Warriors were easy to heal with their +10% Spirit talent, got to love that passive Regen! Maybe Fury instead? Well instead of Bloodthirst your first attack after getting a Killing Blow was a Crit! Waow! Might as well nix Power Infusions and ant Disc priest, because their top two abilities in their talent trees were the Spirit buff and a cooldown to no longer have spell push back.
---
If we were playing in first release Vanilla, we would get absolutely wrecked by Ragnaros, definitely earned his place as the longest no-kill boss
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but it's really not that rare lol People can farm 3-4 an hour quite easily.
---
Quests mostly give you swords
---
When I ran it I got literally nothing and the healer took cruel Barb (do pallies level with one handers???)
---
So you're welcome I guess
---
have to tried talking to your raidleader/loot master about it?
---
normally you need an addon to display the spell power in the tooltip.
---
It’s a bug. You get agro by proximity and if the other player dies, guess what say hello to your new friends.
---
Should have rolled dwarf
---
exactly. Currently lv54 arms warrior with 2H axe, when I die it's because of rngesus
---
Ask your loot council why you aren't being prioritized higher. Noone here can actually help you without knowing about the situation in an intimate way.
---
There is a classic version of pallypower 😁
---
Which server??!
---
There is also [Corrupted Ashbringer] which upon getting 5 or so stacks on its ability temporarily turns into cleansed one and deals Holy damage
---
Raiding is the reward, the loot itself is just an addition. Dont expect much loot. Its normal tho.
---
Fuck this is big.. i ve been abandoning green quests other than those that are simple and give yellows after. Thanks man.
---
&gt;Assuming you didn't overheal a bunch, a rough threat list looked something like this:
---
Overhealing doesn't show up as healing done on meters anyway - it only shows effective healing.
---
the return on this is pretty high, fee for crusader is 25g on my realm
---
Resting BiS face
---
I would levitate on the edge of the fatigue water, cycling through /tar macros to check if anyone is near, and moving if that is the case.
---
Danke  :)
---
Literally just from questing and running dungeons.
---
I mean, I guess you agreed to some weird loot council system. Find a Guild that uses dkp.
---
The Scrimshank Redemption.. I feel that run back.
---
Shouldn't most people be hitting desolace without a mount? Most the quests are before 40
---
I very sincerely doubt this as I don't think it's even possible yet?
---
2% lionheart
---
1% ony pendant

2% truestrike

1% battleborn bracers

1% girdle

2% devilsaur hands/legs

2% accuria

1% blackstone
---
1% rune of the guard captain
---
1% striker's mark
---
That nets you 14% hit chance, still 10% off the hit cap. Wat?
---
Is dual wield good? I’m lvl 38 and leveled arms all the way, it isn’t worth changing is it? I got raveger as well...
---
Some time after 1.10 the drop rate was dramatically increased.
---
Großteil Quests. Letztes Level zu etwa 70% in Strat plus 4 Quests gemacht.
---
I actually just followed these tracks to figure it out for myself this morning, so seeing this post was awesome.
---
The itemization is garbage in Classic. Yeah the items are unique but most of them are extremely bad. It has some nice flair to it but most of the time people are looking at their items and are like “what were they thinking?”
---
Well we got it on the first kill tho. I bet that's pretty rare.
---
troll? x. x
---
I've been spending my talent points on the dual-wield spec for my warrior, but I've been hearing dual-wield is a waste compared with 2h weapons. Is that accurate? Should I stop spending points on the dual-wield spec (can't remember the name of it)?
---
Tanking in dw fury (yeah you don't even need a shield for lowbie dungeons) is way easier than anything else because of the infinite rage it generates. Being prot is a tremendous overkill, he's trading dps and rage for like 10% damage reduction. But if he enjoys it he enjoys it, atleast it's more challenging coz dualwield tanking is almost as retardedly easy as the aoe spellcleaveing mages.
---
I mean it's most of the english speaking world though. The UK and the USA use pints for measurement and beer is often coloquially known as a pint in Australia and NZ.  That's like 2/3 of the anglosphere at least.
---
I was thinking something similar. I have an hour before the 30 classes spawn in game? Guards don’t attack? I’ll go chill out in the chapel in Old Town and sit on the pulpit. Dude’s will never find me
---
Spy doesn't detect you as long as you do literally nothing (or have nothing done to you)
---
please test naked against lvl 1 rabbits or other critters. If you still get numbers below the minimum we know something fishy is going on, if you get other results, we know it's the murloc or something in your gear
---
You need Engineering to be able to use the majority of it's tools and gadgets so you'll need it on your Priest if you want access to them. Tailoring -&gt; make Truefaith -&gt; drop it for something you prefer is a grand idea.
---
I use PallyPower in conjunction with BuffWatch. Still, in a raid when there are 40 people, having another 10 or so entities added is a nuisance.
---
YT Advertise shadow priest.
---
No, Thrash blade is just fine.  Just hold out for raid weapons and dont burn out going for Dal Rends. Thrash Blade is one of the most OP items in the game relative to when you get it.  Get your use out of it.
---
You mean 4 mages
---
Which sounds around right.
---
Illegal Danish
---
It is not abuse to use your group support abilities. You can’t be serious.
---
Any spec has overpower it’s a base skill. But yeh the 50% crit chance is an arms ability.
---
Still DW assuming equal gear levels, just 2h isn't completely non-viable in raids when you have WF
---
You can get a really sweet 2h much more easily than 2 good 1h weapons, so it's occasionally reasonable to go 2h fury instead...provided you have that sweet WF hookup
---
Depends with shadoweave you can maximize mana much more. And if youre undead its even easier since you have touch of weakness. Shield&gt;sw:p&gt;mind flay when its incoming. Thats 2 shadow weave stacks on it, means your dot is more effective and mind flaying the mob when its running at you saves you from getting hit and draining your shield. When they hit you touch of weakness procs thats 3 shadoweave stacks, mind flay again (if ur good at timing it your 2nd mind flay will start right when touch of weakness procs). Thats 4 shadoweaves. Your dot is super effective now especially if youre 44+ its doing 20 more dmg per tick pretty much. Do another mind flay at the end if it runs, or hit it with mind blast if it doesnt have a flee mechanic.
---
You save enough mana incase any pvp and you kill quite fast due to shadoweave dot efficiency.
---
What a cute-looking footrest!
---
Shadow meld?
---
Anyway, so many obscure caves people don’t realize. But I would maybe go for the bottom level of the boat that’s under construction in Tanaris.
---
Or deep underground in the NE starting zone furlbog area.
---
Or just somewhere along the coast with ocean on one side and impassable mountains on the other.
---
Yes, but money. These things are sometimes more expensive than what you get on the AH (with the current prices). And until around level 30, I just made enough gold to buy the necessary skills.
---
That's why you gotta watch SAO:abridged.
---
The look on my groups face in WC when I said I was looking forward to the staff..
---
old fashioned normal phone, 4:3 2nd screen, post-It notes.  Yes  a Real Dad.
---
For how many classes is the HoJ good for (I don't know its stats, it may be good for everyone)? It sounds like something people would forever be competing for.
---
I tend to agree. It depends a lot on rolls. Eating MS is not a great hing as a rogue. Especially if it crits.
---
When I had these issues, uninstalling one of the Razer apps fixed it. Synapse I think it was.
---
&gt; Almost year ago
---
that means you get a new one soon!
---
Why did everyone ignore him wanting to be a pokemon trainer in WoW?
---
Serves ya right! 😂😂😂
---
Yeah, we tried that. I was the first to break off. Since as a mage i would do things so much faster solo. Our warrior friend obviously wanted to group. So we took turns grouping with him until we were in our 30s. Thats when solo playing as a warrior becomes much much more fun. 
---
After that we only helped eachother with elite quests. As a mage i soloed everything though. And we did most dungeons together. 
---
Now at 60 we make sure to help eachother out with gold and mats as much as possible.
---
Use use the one with the most +healing on it
---
I’m trying to imagine 3 guys standing at a gas station talking about killing asmongold
---
No silver. 
---
Free plz?
---
Could it be that its just a joke? I cant believe people are reporting because of this.
---
I’m assuming no instances, because that would be an instant win, and you could easily get in some instance in an hour. Here is what I would do and my line of thinking:
---
First, nix all the glitch areas in Major cities, their too well known.
---
If /tar isn’t available, underwater somewhere obscure is probably your best bet.
---
I’d take my time and go farm a Hydrostaff from Gnomer, and my hiding spot would vary based on what faction was chasing me.
---
Alliance, I’m swimming near that island with the Raptor quest in Durotar
---
Horde, same plan but around Darnassus
---
Na that guy was shit- 0dps
---
Healing makes you more mana efficient.  Mana per 5 eegens mana while casting
---
Spirit regens partially while casting with the talents but is mainly for regen outside of the 5 second rule.
---
Luthíen: I am a Shadow. The True Self.
---
Once you’ve made your arch mage robe you can drop tailoring with no consequence until the ZG patch. Then you decide if you care enough about 2% crit from bloodvine.
---
Still happens.
---
Contains omnomnomnom probably.
---
paladins do 't have taunt as mentioned and have a finite resource (mana) wereas druids and warriors have an infinite one (rage) as to which of the two is better, mostly depends on a combination of gear, skill and what encounter you're talkinhg about
---
Because a rogue will CC the everloving crap outta you... unless they are evasioning. So you really don’t get many hits in on rogues outside of it. Usually how my fights with rogues go, outside of ones where I just get deleted before even getting out of CC, is the rogue puts me down to around half with their opener, then I get a few swings in. In cases where I won, usually something in these ~4 hits crit. This causes a panic Evasion at around 30% health, which is very killable if they don’t respect the OP crit (Mine is around 500+bleed, and I don’t have crazy gear) or absolutely panic.
---
If the Rogue uses Evasion right, right after their CC train runs out and prevents any hits from purchasing in the first place, then yea, warriors do nothing and die. Like how Warrior matches up with basically every class in 1v1... and Rogue really.
---
Also, most Rogues will completely neglect to do any form of CC to a warrior once they Evasion, which then lets the warrior get in those OP’s for free, though it’s more of a thing in not 1v1 fights.
---
Also also there isn’t much besides OP for a Arms Warrior to hit with. They got MS which is huge and Auto attacks... which as you said both have an already high chance to be dodged or miss or be parried or whatever. You aren’t really doing much to begin with with all the CC’s and failed attacks, so an OP on CD for 15 seconds uninterrupted  IS probably the highest damage period you are going to have on the rogue, outside of an execute or something.
---
Int doesn’t increase healin while +healspells does 
---
Int is for Mana 
---
The spirit mp5 ratio isn’t linear I believe 
---
You can hover over your stats in the character window to see what they do 
---
Int does increase spell crit doe (YouTube for the math behind that shit)
---
Meh... I'd rather get a darnassus kitty for my dwarf paladin. I don't really like the way dwarves look on horses.
---
It happens a lot actually. Curse of Tongues is the worst one. Takes forever to mount up lmao.
---
I was 99% sure it was earlier, but it seems we were wrong.
---
Obvious joke because of the "get off".
---
shit State Capitalist company\*
---
In general most people stack healing and down rank spells.
---
You know what I mean. Items from BRD are better than items from MC. You don't have flat upgrades in terms of gear quality from dungeon to dungeon.
---
Reporting for... What?
---
If he doesn't do it for free, is he really a friend tho?
---
90g i think
---
Yes. Theoretically it depends on the rolls. I have had situations with rogues who don’t pop evasion where I didn’t get a single overpower in. I think assuming that they will pop overpower every time it’s off cool down regardless of evasion is a bit too much, I have seen it many times where it doesn’t happen.
---
I have killed many rogues with 2 overpower crits followed by execute as soon as evasion is down.
---
90G
---
I like when wf procs. Feels so good
---
TIL my rogue levels about as fast as a prot warrior.... I must be doing it wrong.
---
Dozens!
---
For some reason I've always confused this with the paladin set. The yellow looks like paladin stuff. Maybe because I'm not sure what the paladin set looks like.
---
You farmed that before your BiS pieces?
---
LMFAO
---
Yeah, it made me sad that I couldn't tell the horde players to "go to retail" like they tell me.
---
To fix this I made a horde alt on a different server to tell gnomes to go to retail
---
Pets are fine. Streamers complain about them being hard to control, or not quick enough to react. I'm not really seeing any of that on my lock. If not need the pet to calm down, I throw it on passive. Most times it isn't on passive, and it's fine.
---
Also once you hit about 40-44, depending on if you took stamina talents or not, you can be a drain tank with the pact talent that lets you drain your pets Mana. With the succubus pet, your mana will be full for the next fight (hitpoints too).
---
+healing means your healing spells heal for more. How much +1 healing adds to a spell depends on the spell. With enough of it you can effectively downrank your spells (use lower ranks of them) which saves you mana.
---
The main difference between mp5 and spirit is that mp5 always works, while the mana regeneration with spirit only starts to happen a few seconds after your last cast.
---
The basic rule for Spirit is 13 + (spirit / 4) iirc.
---
Cool, worthless item though.
---
Ya im working on holydin gear as well thats last on my list tho
---
&gt; bad interaction
---
&gt; he was a gnome
---
Checks out.
---
desolace and stv are the zones you hit before 40 that cause you to say “I better save my money this walking shit sucks”
---
Key and Peele skit. They were on Comedt central a few years back. They are the same ones who do the Substitute Teacher videos.
---
lol, log off and log an alt to play with instead for that day.
---
Have fun searching, don't forget to check the waterways.
---
Monkey quest is the best one by far
---
The longer the flight path, the more time you have to smoke, eat and make coffee!
---
Have you tried badlands?
---
aux has filters and one of them is 'stuff below vendor price'.  you would have to manually click buy after the scan though.  but maybe that's with all addons?
---
Soo fucking cosy
---
I just bid on their stuff.
---
It's not like you have to make a huge investment. I only bought the vendor white, the rest just dropped. My first heavy investment was the WW axe (and that's only because of the charms xD).
---
Another question: Is there an add-on you guys know of which allows you to overlay a Youtube/Twitch video over your game screen? Would be super helpful.
---
Rage is so flawed since it scales with the damage you deal. Stupid resource tbh
---
I have had many times where I wouldn’t get an overpower for quite a bit if they don’t use evasion. You don’t always get a dodge every 6 seconds.
---
99% sure it is based on percentage of active bid.
---
The guides that I've read and the paladin discord are all about Flurry Axe. So there must be something about the MWST that is worse than FA - could it be that the proc is so low and FA proc is quite high making it a lot better? MWST would be, on paper, better for AOE threat generation, but when have we lacked in that department? Single Target threat is where we are somewhat lacking and that's where the extra attack from FA comes in. Remember - you do not "really" care for the white damage from it, so the DPS of the axe doesn't matter, just the SoR portion as it is the only thing that meaningfully generates threat.
---
TLDR: It's all about proc rates.
---
I was about to make the exact same comment.
---
Everyone knows that ganking green lvl players at 50% hp is the ultimate pro gamer move
---
11/10 skill, please upload more so we can learn some of your l33t skillz

When you reblog. You are suppose to alt f4
---
We are 11 mages in our raid. Those curses are cleaned out from the raid in seconds.
---
I was a try hard resto druid in vanilla and was only beaten in healing by our best priest.
---
Patchwerk is one of the fights where bears are preferred...
---
No way, dude. Just spam hamstring on any enemy. Much better than targeting multiple rats. Are you kidding me?
---
who says he didn't do both?
---
Omg lol sorry hahahahaha i didnt even see the classic label *facepalm*
---
Comments like these always get glided or some shit idk
---
&gt; Will i be missing out on anything if i drop blacksmithing?
---
There is _one_ set you can only obtain if you have BS. Which is a blue one and will release with AQ iirc, so nothing to worry about now.
---
Wasn't a question..
---
Well obviously they don't hand it out like candy, but i've put in 3 tickets in like the last 2 years, just asking for gametime and got few days everytime.
---
I believe there is a dwarf named Oralius as well who will let you rub his belly as a quest reward.
---
just curious how did you come to this opinion? bith moonkins I saw back then and the ones I've seen now barely keep up with the tank?
---
The meeting stones can't even be used, they have no functionality in classic. Blizzard didn't include the queuing system they had in vanilla.
---
Have you made any pro hk speeches in game?
---
I think this is really over the top and frankly just seems aimed at trying to steer the hands of mods here.
---
 Mods, who get no compensation and try to retain a number of subreddit rules to keep this cesspool clean - don't know about you, but if I moderated this *game* subreddit I would not have expected to ever have to take some perceived stand on political issues, and most likely I'd like to stay as far away from it as possible. I also don't think it likely that we'll have all global news papers/agencies go on and quote a random subreddit and "perceived" opinions formed based on conjecture and little else.
---
Ok. Then do it. Sucks, but is your time THAT important? In the time you've been posting and commenting and waiting for a reply you could've just done it again.
---
Looks like elvui, might be mistaken though
---
I really hope no one else needed any of those pieces, hunter
---
Same here. Started with 9 irl friends and now only me and 1 friend left. Others stopped playin cuz classic was good game back then and boring now.
---
Ok, so never do halb a pug raid basically. Shit. But thanks!
---
Stable latency is more important than the amount of ms itself.
---
Jumping between 10-50 can be subjectively fel more as lag than stable 140ms probably will. Mostly because you can adapt to the delay, while you can not when it jumps up and down.
---
Well done you caught a whole lot of fishes Ded.
---
Tip of the beanie to you fine sir.
---
...on the internet
---
This made me a bit sad.
---
I lead a guild on Kirtonos - Horde. Hit me up if you need some companionship!
---
Much lower level - Check  
---
Already fighting multiple mobs - Check  
---
Not at full health - Check  
---
Yep that's basic rogue skill....
---
Because 60 gets you nothing.
---
As much as people want to harp about leveling being the huge part of the game it simply isn't true.
---
The best thing in the game is seeing your character grow in power and putting in the effort to make it as strong as possible.
---
This happens only little with leveling and the true upgrades come at 60 by endlesly farming every instance and raid possible. And when people need 4+ hours per level from 35 and on and when they think of all the hours they still need to put in the game they become discouraged.
---
It's only natural, we've been here before and we know the grind. It's a huge time investment that many people simply can't afford.
---
I got my Whirlwind Axe yesterday so go 2H magic! 
---
Now I just need to figure out this hamstring kiting now!
---
Don’t even need a macro, just /me pickpockets 1g 2s from you gets you all kinds of salt
---
Great story. I usually hate world PVP because most times it's some skull level one-shotting me (only on a PVP server because all my friends are there), but you took an interesting approach to it. I don't think I'd have minded being on the receiving end of your blade in this case.
---
If you're soloing use agony
---
just an educated  guess.
---
every server has several , and the price is usually 1.2 or 1.3g...
---
Yeah the sewer/cave out to Tristfall Glades.
---
My first character in classic is a holy pala because we are playing in a group and I volunteered as a healer. I’m altoholic in retail so I thought I would stick to one char this time around for a good bit. Unfortunately questing and farming as pala seems unreasonable for me coming from much faster paced place. Now I’m also side-leveling a hunter for solo farming everything I can “outsource” from pala really
---
Also cost 150 mana and delay mana regen.
---
These numbers look correct judging off of what I see in game however I can confirm the tool tip for my rank 8 mind blast does say 467 to 494.  Just checked so it looks like it’s a bug.
---
My favourite MC target!
---
Bruh did you read the OP?
---
They clearly not only lack understanding but are also dicks themselves, calling someone who's acting out of line a name isn't bad IMO.
---
The main thing you miss out on is the [Glimmering Mithril insignia](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia), which is a trinket that gives fear immunity for 30 seconds and requires blacksmithing.
---
Must be nice having so much space for water....
---
Should do that anyway because who knows which mobs have magnificent cleavage?
---
It's proximity aggro, and it's a "feature" of vanilla. IIRC this was on the "list of things that aren't bugs" and they actually put in some work to reproduce it.
---
The best explanation for it I've seen is that basically mobs communicate with each other, that's why they chain when they're in close proximity (effectively a shout for help) and this continuously occurs throughout fighting them, if another mob is brought past them that call for help/friendly check generates aggro on their threat table and should the person who's fighting them die or run out of their range, you're the only one left with any threat.
---
But ye, mob griefing friendlies was a thing in vanilla. Most commonly used by AoE farmers to try get rid of people so they had the spot to themselves or people looking to punish botters.
---
Tram to IF, death drop to menethil, boat to auberdine, run to felwood and get deep in the tunnels below the satyr place. Should avoid target macros and nobody will want to look there cause you can’t mount. Without flight paths its the only place I feel you can get to in s reasonable time
---
Nah I prefer to let it rot *shrugs*
---
That's not your nemesis, that's you! 
---
Something must've gone wrong when Chromie hit that button... we're dooomed!!
---
there is a back entrance to every horde capital city.
---
Thunder bluff doesn't have a back door entrance per se, but alliance players can easily kite him to outside of the city and just 5 man him there (been done).
---
alliance leaders are all in well protected areas , so there is a slight disbalance there
---
everyone got the joke?
---
32 shaman, 29 priest, 24 mage and a selection of sub 20 characters. I feel you brother
---
I'm sorry, but... final? How do you know? The game isn't really going anywhere, and you never know if they'll want to pick it back up at some point.
---
Okay yeah, yellow is too general. They only take single target damage.
---
It has always been like that. Those payments take time on blizzard's side to process, so i quickly learned to pay at least a day beforehand otherwise youll have to wait for a few hours at least, sometimes more.
---
Pretty lucky yeah. I've ran ubrs probably around 40 times now, have not even seen truestrike...  Atleast have had both Dal'Rends drop in a single run!
---
Glad you are having le fun with le wife doing some tanking in le dungeons i also was alive when it was 2009 and le was the hip thing to do
---
you see comrade, when swinging gun, you make increase speed of boolet
---
Relatable as fuck
---
Did i ever mention the class warrior? Not every class is melee and has overpower and harmstring. Just saying...
---
First and foremost, Blizzard reinforced their tournament rules. If you would have ever concerned yourself with the participant part of any tournament, you would know are usually pretty strict (in the case of Blizzard: uber strict).
---
Secondly, this whole debate has long been derailed. While generally I agree with you of course, whenever both sides of a conflict escalate needlessly, all goes to shit. Blizzard and the fans have gone way too far in every regard. The best thing to do in such a case is to start the debate over. Nothing good will come from this.
---
Not about to run to booty bay at level 15.
---
It's a niche debuff to make certain encounters less agonising m
---
Nope. Would be bored within 3-5 hours and would give up.
---
Stick with the hunter. You like the hunter. Your casual soloing playstyle and limited hours are good for hunter. Priest isn't a "bad" choice for you, I just think you'll get more out of your playstyle and schedule with hunter.
---
Respect bro
---
Where's Beren?
---
So this is what melee hunters are supposed to look like
---
Yeah that was my case too.  They were greyed out tabs with no text on them.
---
Mage v Mage matchup. First person to get polymorph off usually has a better chance at winning. 
---
My suggestion for being the first person to get poly off depends on spec. If they are arcane, improved counterspell can be rough, first one to bust imp cs gets the opener. If you are arcane frost 31/0/20, this will help you get first poly off. Wait about 10-15s after polymorphing for your counterspell cd to be nearly back. If possible, wait full for your cooldown to come back. Get within range of your arcane explosion, your goal is to deceive your opponent of your plan as to how you’re going to kill them. Full rank fireball to break the poly followed by frost bolt to slow. Your next goal is to get them to thinking you are going to explosion them to death in order to make them bust blink to get away from you. Blink back to them and nova for shatter, which they now can’t blink out of. Cone of cold/fireblast with some more explosions. 
---
You’ll be out of mana but they will be dead. 
---
If they’re not arcane, most likely they are waiting to cs your poly. Bait them with a stop cast halfway through your poly to get them to burn their interupt and now you can freecast poly. Proceed with prior plan.
---
This is how it's done. Stick with your bois, 'cause brotherhood is nothing without your brothers.
---
Lol...my main is 32 :'(
---
He means yellow hit cap of 6% at 305/9% at 300. White hit cap is almost irrelevant until you’re critcapped with full consumes and world buffs
---
A few Orcs lined up, orcing around
---
Gz man! I mained dru and my mage is only 35
---
I remember back in Wrath when dungeon finder got implemented there were people DEMANDING you to give them the item you just won because it's a BiS of theirs and point to another item in another dungeon you are supposed to be getting ans even respec for it.  
---
"What do you mean you are specced Hack &amp; Slash?! RESPEC TO Close Quarters Combat because you have a dagger offhand RIGHT NOW!!!!"
---
Came here to say this. I'm proud more people did.
---
Probably someone that took multiboxing to the next level. Multiboxer (playing on multiple accounts at the same time) usually have around 5 or so characters they play at the same time. However I remember the biggest multiboxer I ever saw had around 20 or so characters.
---
Nothing beats the pleasure of being a NE Hunter with a cat. Shadowmeld and Prowl. By the time the horde figures whats happening its too late.
---
Hands Across Kalimdor?
---
Perhaps next time instead of taking shit, just right click, report and move on?
---
This just ain't true.
---
Thousand Needles **ISN'T** flooded? Damn, I might visit that place in classic
---
Noway that \[rogue\] would not reserve IF...
---
You bring them to the Cloth Quartermaster of the faction whose mount you want to ride. 
---
I don't know what the quartermaster does with all that cloth. Sell it to the goblins probably
---
You should probably play less.
---
Grats tho.
---
Fury can be done with both a 2h and two 1hs, it's honestly good for both. It's just slightly better when dual wielding, and as it turns out, Arms is better when using a 2h while leveling. But ultimately, it won't matter which one you choose, they both work for leveling well enough.
---
As for dual wielding, there are a couple big problems. The first is the higher miss chance on your autos. The majority of your damage will be coming from auto-attacks, and even once you hit 40 and get Bloodthirst, your autos will still contribute more damage than your specials. And then you're slapping a 25% miss chance on them at base because of dual wielding's penalties. More misses also means less consistent rage gain, because misses generate no rage, while you get some rage for  parries or blocks (I'm not sure on dodges)
---
The other big issue is going to sound obvious. When using a 2h weapon, you only have to worry about upgrading a single weapon. With dual wielding, you have to upgrade both. And yeah, you probably get that, but no drops are ever guaranteed outside quest rewards. You might go two major dungeons before you get a drop, and when you're relying on your weapon(s) to be as good as possible, only needing to risk not getting one drop is a lot less stressful than risking not getting two drops.
---
Yeah, but the people making these judgments would not admit this
---
 You can tell how much fun they had coming up with quests and npc names. I also like how they kept the silly or funny stuff for more insignificant content, so that the core of the game keeps it tone.
---
Turn off the max fps foreground and background thing in advanced options. And set mouse polling rate to lowest. Fixed all my mouse issues
---
only by people who are wrong.
---
lots of people call the taskbar notification area the "system tray" but that doesn't make them not wrong.
---
Yeah pretty hyped for that :D
---
attunement = quest lets you in.
---
key = physical item lets you in.
---
It's quite a long grind with decent rewards, so making it longer seems a horrible prospect...
---
Where did u farm ur darnassus rep?
---
&gt;Should be dropping soon.
---
Define "soon".
---
I always memed hunters about needing on loot but finally understood the pain they go through when started levelling an alt hunter
---
There is almost no hunter specific loot in low level dungeons. I believe the first hunter item (except bow from WC) is mail AP gloves from SM cath. All other loot has nonhunter stats on it like strength
---
As a warrior I feel your pain. We dont like wearing leather, but the BiS-lists force us into it. I'm currently wearing 2 (yes, TWO) plate items. Rend Bracers and Drakkisath Belt. Rest is a mix of leather and mail.
---
You'd only get exp from the bosses, seems like a waste of an hour unless he really wants particular gear. BFD is possibly worth doing, RFK and SM GY would be good to do
---
That one is nice! Yeah i think im just doing blacksmithing. It just goes so hand in hand with mining.
---
Yeah I agree. Hardly any plate dps gear. They’re gonna have a hard time wearing leather in pvp, that’s all I gotta say.
---
It really depends how dilligent they would be.
---
There are quite a few spots in the world where you can hide behind a corner and completely disappear- I would probably try and use that on the Loch Modan dam or somewhere on a cliff between Arathi Highlands and Wetlands.
---
I think it's a 50-50 shot. If they know the game's hiding spots they'll find you for sure.
---
You need to be on a threat table to be eligible for loot. OP probably didn't had enough threat generated on boss, there can be various reasons for that
---
Idk if that's the same guild, but man. Why people even join that guild? You pay 25g for something that should be free. Except on gdkp runs, but I think that's not the case here.
---
I can think of a few places that would likely work: 
---
Jump into the canyon that separates wetlands from Arathi Basin (under thandol span). Maybe even swim down the river for obscurity. 
---
Hide in the house that’s only accessible after exiting deadmines and taking a left. 
---
Hide in a random building in IF that doesn’t contain NPCs (I’m thinking around mystic quarter or explorer quarter) 
---
But the sure fire way was already mentioned. Drop off Darn and hang out on one of the roots. Or hang in the water below
---
The world first beat it in mostly quest rewards and with over a third of the raid being below level 60. 
---
Start working towards your preraid BiS, because it'll give you something to to, but once you're attuned, it's probably fine to go in so long as you have generally up-to-date gear from dungeon runs.
---
Sociopaths? Did you hit your head or something?
---
Lol do you think multiboxing is against the rules..?
---
so why dont i just wait until he drops enough to then heal him with the bigger heal?
---
bigger heals are more mana efficient
---
Exactly what I'm contemplating now that I had a snack of WoW (gonna hit 60 today - finally).
---
yeah, you got warriors and other rogues wanting the same pieces as u do
---
not to forget that in early WoW nobody had a plan about nothing. Arcanite Reaper you could see in your profession window and be like "holy shit this is so good, I need this" and then work towards it. But many people had no clue about the stuff that drops in MC.
---
It was different times back then. Information about stuff in the game was sparse. It's really difficult to grasp because these days if you want to know anything, you can just whip out your phone and google it wherever you are. The newest Destiny 2 expansion came out and you could look up guides to the new raid pretty much immediately. Back in 2004/2005 it took a while for such information to get to players. Even if sites like that existed, people weren't used to using them.
---
&gt;serial-alt starter
---
Mother of God, are you me?
---
Havent lost to a rogue in PvP yet. So easy to dumpster them irregardless of overpowers
---
yeah i get u, im fine healing/tanking for dungeons, but in raids i WILL play shadow.
---
Probably underwater near endless air hub. People hate aquatic quests. And if some will find me I'll make sure he drown by using MC on him.
---
Are hearthstone or swim speed potions or engendering trinkets allowed?
---
Probably just some guild fooling around here. I count 33 characters, that would need insane money for subs ontop of insane hardware and an insane connection.
---
I play alliance on ES, population ratio seems pretty balanced but only lvl 33 atm, finding people to run dungeon outside of DM, Stockade and SM Spellcleave is pretty hard while leveling even as a tank, pop at 60 look healthy tho.
---
What do you farm in DM?
---
i gone to Silithus and dinged from explorarion for discovering the Scarab seal
---
I wanted to get an epic wolf as undead but I'm seriously reconsidering it now.
---
How much rep per runecloth stack do you get ?
---
How do you kill something that has no life?!
---
do training dummies exist? wtf :o where?
---
Well mostly to have fun, but also im not completely against making gold on an alt. I would play sp on pve too tbh, except dungeons.
---
finally?
---
next alt, roll clown, you are so funny.
---
As a rogue.. rogue vs a warrior with overpower is wierd. 
---
Some rogues insists that you should never use vanish against them which makes sense as it gives them many opportunities for overpower. 
---
But another group of rogues, who seem more elitist say that’s a big noob mistake, because even tho vanish opens up for overpower abuse, they also say that being hit by overpower is much preferable than mortal strike and execute which also makes sense.
---
Honestly I have no idea when to use vanish vs a warrior, maybe at the end to make his execute finishers hard to hit??
---
Moost wanted bullet spin
---
Demonology is an example of how bad(raw) the game design in vanilla is.
---
There're like 4 useful talents in the whole demo tree and all other talents are PURE trash
---
You only think bullets shoot straight
---
The day is divided into 4 quarters and different fish apepar at different times. Nightfin for example is very common after midnight and before 6am (Server time)
---
50
---
Horde capitals with multiple entry points: 2   
---
Alliance capitals with multiple entry points: 0
---
Bc they don’t have 50% resistance 
---
They prolly have some minuscule shadow resistance or maybe the low and high roll ratio you base you math on might be off by a bit idk sth like that
---
Verified.
---
But sir they posted screen shots!
---
Unverified, and fixed the bug.
---
That's our current process with every bug
---
They might have been elite or just tough. Some vanilla enemies are intentionally hard to solo, to force you to group up and socialize.
---
Lol this gives me zero jealousy. Hope the guy finds something more in life. But grats and hope he’s happy. I guess that’s all that matters.
---
Why can't the rogues I encounter do this?! All I get are rogues who stunlock me to death while I just started eating my buff food and used my elixirs...
---
The staff is used to make the bow.
---
so now you have to wait for the elementium?
---
That's not the Bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
They distribute it back to the undead and humanoids so it can be farmed for again, so the circle can be closed. Don't ask why.
---
Lucky sonovabitch. I barely see any groups looking for healer in lfg.
---
Is robes of arcane pattern and shadowceave helm more than bandages? How much is it?
---
I've heard of this, if you log off and back on they should be in your bags
---
You won them fair and square. Those were the stated loot rules.
---
You're fine for rolling on them in a non-reserved pug and anyone sperging out at you in whispers should get ignored and reported if their messages are bad enough.
---
Possible but you underestimate the dedication of single individuals. Some people just have a lot of money in real life and have fun doing stuff like this. However a multiboxer probably wouldn't line them up like this, they would be mostly hanging around at the same spot so it could indeed be just a guild doing some funny thing or roleplay.
---
You should stop using reddit and support HK.
---
That was my next move. Still not there unfortunately. Was a pretty anticlimactic end to a long grind lol.
---
I make 1-2g in profit on a single robe
---
I make about 2-4g or profit on a single helm
---
and that’s when i buy mats of ah
---
I'm not sure if the addon menu slots can be keybound, but they can be clicked to activate the trinket. You can also make two macros (/use 13 and /use 14), put those on your action bars and then bind them. Instead of having the names of your trinkets in the macro, they will use the trinket in slot 13 (top trinket) and slot 14 (bottom trinket).
---
Fuck em bro you pay your sub just like everyone else, enjoy
---
To be fair anyone rolling on faerelina and staying through all the queue without transferring or rerolling on another server either does so for their fanatic following of the streamers or their fanatic hate of the streamers, or they're retarded.
---
Only one of those is a sad reason to be beat up!
---
I loved reading about how you and your wife play game :)
---
Who are you and why are you and how are you using my username
---
There's no reason why this can't be fixed. This "authentic" classic feel where they won't patch anything is nonsense. There were bugs in the game then, there are bugs now. Fix this shit blizzard.
---
It's no excuse to say that you won't change anything to give the same experience. This is not working as intended. It is a bug. Bugs need to be patched, regardless of whether or not it was in Vanilla. This goes for other bugs such as random quest items not disappearing or appearing when they should in quests. 
---
You are refusing to commit resources patching things and claim it's for the authenticity. This is nonsense. Many of us came back to WoW simply to play classic. We are paying good money for this game, we deserve exactly what we are paying for.
---
Fix the bugs Blizzard. No excuses.
---
Might be best to open a ticket
---
I’ll return to STV once I’m 60 };)
---
It's procet science!
---
Thank you, that confirms that it does in fact work on older macs in windows!
---
Guy wants to be able to raid by himself most likely, was there when it happened too lol
---
On the way to 60 on my priest I must have lost 20 different need rolls on wands to mages. I get you can use wands, but we both know you wont. That wand would be a big buff for me but instead it's going to just sit there gathering dust.
---
I paid 1.30g per stack but runecloth has been up rising the past couple days.
---
&gt; But, they also have healing stream totem, which they should absolutely be using as a tank. This helps mitigate some of the extra damage they take, but also generates more AoE threat than any of their other water totems.
---
so totems generate threat for you? they dont have their own threat? is that just for water totems or others aswell, like the fire ones?
---
Ouch.
---
It’s not a race. The leveling in classic wow is part of the experience
---
I feel your pain, had to wait for the sinew as well (dropped on the 3rd onyxia)
---
it's painful having completed the demon quest but being at the mercy of onyxia's drop chance
---
Make sure to bask in the angry PMs of people being pissed at the AUDACITY of a rogue daring to have a Thunderfury
---
My brother is jealous
---
5
---
7
---
The only 2 numbers necessary
---
What are you doing for a living ? I mean i started playing at the begin of classic release and i'm still lvl 27.
---
As a hunter Ive lost it 5 times to warriors. Ive been collecting every dalrend sword I can just out of spite.
---
!RemineMe 4 hours
---
Also this. Politics should never mix with video games and I am glad they handled this with an iron fist.
---
It sucks but its reality, I remember spreading the word to all my friends that used to play and them being excited, then launch came, just my closest and I remain.
---
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN A ROGUE! The BlAsPhEmY! :ToT:
---
I gave a guy the mats to make devilsaur gloves and they ndver showed. After a lot of back and forth I told him to relog and they showed up. Was scared he’d just scammed me but thankfully it was just a bug.
---
or the people that think alt f4 is some kind of inside joke that is hilarious to tell people when they ask how to do something.
---
Currently sitting at 400g, that said, it will set me back from getting epic mount by quite a lot x)
---
not sure what you are on about , you get both the staff AND the bow, you get the staff after creating the bow and talking to the tree again
---
You are aware that there are two bindings, and you require both to get the legendary sword, yes? That is what makes getting it so hard. Its an extremely low drop chance, and you need it to happen twice, and you need to win it twice. 
---
You will very likely never get Thunderfury.
---
I question that you had it before, since you seem to think you now have it in the bag by having one of the bindings.
---
I agree, I would prefer to keep political opinion out of video games
---
Are there any walljumps / shortcuts to winterspring, similar to the menethil-&gt;dun morogh skip?
---
I swam the entire way from auberdine to ashzara yesterday and could not find such a spot to drown myself...
---
I know of the auberdine-&gt;moonglade skip. but running through the tunnel with a bank alt sounds like a hell lot of corpse running,
---
farming bis is great! all full run: 6 brd, 4 lbrs, 3 ubrs, 2 scholo and 2 strat (both together). in all of these I did not even saw any of the items dropped - not just not winning them, but didnt even dropped anything what I could roll for.
---
LOL I know it's coming when I even have it on. Im scared please no yell at me I JUST WANNA HAVE FUN 😭😂
---
The frost mage mantra:
---
Everything that can be slowed, can be soloed.
---
I am disappointed that this doesn't has more comments making jokes with the water elemental.
---
I wonder what would happen if we made a campfire ourselves there.
---
Morroweed is expensive and hard to get compared to runecloth.
---
the staff really isn't that popular, peacemaker from stratholme is a better 2H for hunters than this
---
But it does look super sweet
---
I would also like to clarify these rules... I was attacked by a warlock whobl was out of reach by the guards which was whatever. But then i was attacked by the guards after putting down a grounding totem and/or healing myself.
---
Do any of these things trigger the guards? Or was it something else that im not thinking of?
---
3:50 Ok this is starting to sound too ridiculous to not be true.
---
wash yer bekh
---
Incendius
---
You might use a two hander as tank when it is appropriate, i.e. when you outgear the content and the rest of the group can deal with it. If you are not prepared to switch to shield and 1hd, please don't join up for groups unless you state your intent.
---
I think it looks fine. Healthar is bigger because thats probably more important to a healer or some people. Only looks wierd because of the portrait. Quests are just a bit to the left, I dont know where the problem is.
---
Only thing that would bother me are the actionbars that are empty and black.
---
Grats to the eye dude!!
---
Meanwhile the majority of the things you own are made in china
---
The vid shows it off as it was possible with the bugged demo shout. This is fixed now and no warrior will be able to hold aggro against arcane exploding mages.
---
Dont you mean. Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, parry, miss, miss, dodge, OVERPOWER!
---
Satire at its finest. Its flagged as humor, the title even suggests its a piss take, and an army of mongs are running in guns blazing. Priceless.
---
I salute your efforts, Sir, regardless of how serious they are. You're a Chad in my eyes.
---
Fucking liberals, who gives a fuck? If you enjoy the game play the game, people these days lmao.
---
Were you in a raid group or regular party? OP was in a raid group, which has different rules around it. If he had done this in a  party of 5 he would've been fine.
---
Had few goals which I was able to now fill. I just tend to overdo things when I have a clear goal in my mind. Now going to spend more time in IRL.
---
I have to admit it’s pretty funny to watch people blow up, I’m not even a rogue hahaha
---
The quests are supposed to be to the right, below the map. I changed the UI scale couple days ago, but forgot to adjust that.
---
Yes, I have built TF twice before. Once in vanilla where the bindings dropped nearly back to back in a month and once on a Pally for giggles in Cata which took me a year and a half.
---
Since my guild hosted this PuG, they will probably be placing the other half on reserve when we host future PuGs (unless someone has the other half, obviously) but this hasn't fully been discussed yet.
---
This is crap water. Give us the stuff from DM.
---
its well over a month and I still cant use the forums since I need a character above level 10 and apparently my level 60 in classic doesnt count im not sure how I feel about blizzard implementing the necessary infrastructure to survey people. Though yeah I think community consensus is the way to go.
---
some say he still sells cat to this very day.. i base all my bank alts on his statements.
---
Ironically many of the sets are still terrible. The warlock set for example, is outclassed by level 52 green items.
---
Cash on delivery. If he accepts the silk, he send's back the speeding violation.... 1g I think.
---
Anyone complaining is just salty they didn't get their virtual orange. Enjoy it man.
---
Thank God that's been so annoying
---
Wtf should have called cops, ppl like this must be under lock
---
Blizz actually did nothing to the xp amount, they only renamed normal/fatigued to rested/normal.
---
I bought another 6 months just to piss you guys off.
---
the first SAO is really good though
---
So supporting democracy is a liberal thing now...interesting.
---
Run dungeons nonstop. Strat live is good for money.  I had my epic 2 weeks after hitting 60 as a healer.
---
Btw, anyone seen Sword of Zeal yet? I've seen none on AH so far, and its above Krol acording to shadowpanther spreadsheet.
---
Interesting. Good luck.
---
1000g for something you can replace in MC. No thanks.
---
I mean isn´t miss rate 24% on dual wield .. sometimes it feels like 90%
---
NTA
---
You rolled for it and you won. It is not your fault there were salty People in your Group. You all had a fair shot and you were raiding with them. So why shouldn't you be allowed to roll!
---
Don'T mind them they are just unhappy because they wanted to win :p
---
I'll sneak this in where probably few will see it. Blizzard CS is in Austin. A couple months before every expansion (or in this case Classic), they ramp up staff by hiring from a temp agency- same one they have used for years. The pay is crap, but most of the people that get hired have figured out who it's for, and they want nothing more than to have a shot at getting hired on permanently. 
---
Some are screw-ups to be sure, but they get weeded out quickly, often in training. Most are motivated and want to do good, most actually play. But... everything is about the numbers. You basically have Standard Responses that you use for the vast majority of things, and most will just stick to that.  This means closing a ticket in a minute or two- which makes up for the few that could take longer.  Even if you know you could "solve" the issue, some will not because they are more concerned about speed over service, and as long as you give the "correct" response you are safe.
---
The reason for that is when it comes down to getting hired on- it's the ones that can close the maximum tickets while not getting too many complaints that will succeed. If agent A is closing 16-18 tickets an hour with an 85% satisfaction rating, they will get hired over agent B that closes 10-12 tickets with a 98% satisfaction rating. Actually being helpful takes time.
---
Yeah I don't know how to type the fancy i in that name. And I'm not learning alt codes. 0/10 would not bother finding alternate ways to /invite if a simple right click wasn't an option.
---
Totally fine and up to you, wasnt critique or something.
---
I'm right wing? I literally cannot fathom how this post could be mistaken as left wing, hahaha. Go read a book or something. Quest-text would be a safe start!
---
Can't wait for doing this with level 55 water...
---
Classic default, 3/10 I think. I tried lower to 1/10 but seems nothing different.
---
for those unaware, the "i absolutely understand" and "I would ask the same questions" is all copy and pasted bullshit boiler plate
---
I've seen both an item vanish from my bank and a 20g transfer in a trade window vanish and my ticket got the same bullshit boilerplate 
---
I remember when support used to be really helpful and you got an actual person helping you.
---
There really aren't. Especially not when you are level 52 and still have 8 levels of dungeon grind ahead of you.
---
I like podracing!
---
I heard of some people getting suspensions when playing overseas just fyi

You shouldn't have much problems really. Don't be so scared

---
And how do you kill those who don't have a life?
---
because it costs less
---
Yeah, I know. Still, I'm super curious. Everyone just says it'll ruin your reputation, nobody gives an actual amount. I'm just afraid it might be something ridiculous, like 500+, so I'm leery of testing it.
---
News flash: You're playing a game ABOUT POLITICS. *slowclap* I'm guessing you've never read any quest text. That, or y'all lack the cognitive function to identify the intentional parallels between fact and fiction that are deep-rooted in the Warcraft universe and always have been.
---
Lol wtf does a mage have to complain about?
---
Wait, there are people tanking with a 2H?
---
You have a two sets of gear just like rogues dont wear truestrike in PvP if they can help it hit wise.
---
As warrior you wear t0 legs, cloudkeepers, Reiver Claws etc. putting your leather gear in the bank.
---
&gt;Hardly any plate dps gear. They’re gonna have a hard time wearing leather in pvp, that’s all I gotta say.
---
PvP doesn't need as much hit, plus they will likely be playing Arms anyway which requires even less. Plus, Stamina is king in PvP so the stat prio changes. Can't deal damage if you're dead.
---
Roll into another server.
---
Hey man, glad to see you here! Thanks a lot, I guess all the terrible RNG I have accumulated finally paid off and rewarded me with a lucky drop.
---
They are not your friends/s

Played on earthshaker but left because of the community, lots and lots of toxicity

What the fuck does star wars have to do with this conversation. Which btw I’ve not seen the new ones because they’re garbage. Sw stands for stormwind.

Only if they put inn Winnie the Pooh as playable race.

DME imps, DMN first boss and hyennas
---
DM solo was good XP to 52 if I remember correctly. Got around 1-2 golden pearls per level in DM and those are quite expensive in my realm (20g+ ea).  I would also recommend taking herbalism, as there were quite many ghost mushroom spawns.
---
You can also get game time by buying token with gold in retail. Not that hard to get the gold required when multiboxing.
---
Hunters absolutely need ravager and a str-set to be able to get into any dungeons from \~35-59, and with r1 wing clip spam they can even proc it reliably.
---
It is good for a hunter though. Ravager procs on an auto attack or ability. So mongoose Bite+wing clip spam, throw in an explosive or frost trap, and top it off with a WF shaman. I don’t see how that’s bad in this whole AoE instance grind meta.
---
Gets better with more gear. Lionheart for head, edgemasters hands, cloudkeeper legs and some mail.
---
The preview video I saw basically said new and exciting capes to level up.  Hopefully this has been in the pipeline for a while already.
---
Sweet. All solo-able as a mAge?
---
I feel that. Me and a few others have gone back to our main class. Not nearly 60 but getting there.

Wasnt his spec hidden at first? Maybe he thought it was a ret paladin

it's vendor spec pre BiS too
---
Thanks for a great ressource. I learned quite a few things.
---
I'm trying to find a source for the calculation between Int, spell crit, and spell power. So far I've found that (at level 60 for mages) 59,5 Int = 1 spell crit. However, I can't seem to find the math on spell power to Int or spell power to spell crit.
---
Would you by chance have a link or a hint to a ressouce on this?
---
That makes it ok then. You win this round.
---
Can someone explain this post to me? I thought felsteeds were “free” mounts for locks, for lvl 40 and 60
---
Hop on another layer
---
Not everything is normalized to my knowledge. For example many rogue skills are static weapon dmg + X dmg (Backstab as an example). Fast weapon with equal dps should never do as much damage on a Backstab as a slow weapon.
---
If talents was the reason, they didn't want you to heal, they were idiots.
---
You do not need a single point in resto until way later. For leveling, just go down the feral tree first including the 31 point crit aura, then start in resto. Sure, you want NS later if you go for the HotW/NS 30/21 hybrid build, but you won't get NS until lvl 60 anyways and the aura is to nice to pass up for 1 level delay in those resto talents.
---
Collect a healing set to switch to for healing dungeons and feral away if you are solo (or if you fancy tanking in dungeons, there is usually a lack of tanks).
---
Multiboxer - there is Videos on YouTube.
---
I think I remember one guy playing 40 shamans at a time. Also on Youtube.
---
He might have been from the same guild as the MT and one of the DPS Warrs. They played really well, which is sad cause they are prob triggered off planet Earth and will never play with us again. 🥺
---
the pvp server hype is 100% ruining the game for the majority. it's fun for one day, then it's an absolute chore to constantly die without being able to do anything about it. 
---
that said, the grind is definitely insane post lv40. i've played on vanilla private servers regularly since 2012 or something and NEVER reached lv60 on a 1x server. once 53, another time 54. i was committed with my lv54 priest but eventually quit because of world pvp. i knew then that i'd roll pve for the rest of my life. 
---
currently got my warrior at 53 but it's also very, very tiring. it doesn't help that you're so dependent on weapons. btw, making alts is the first step to quitting :D
---
fixed PPM wasn't a thing in classic. If something says "chance" you'll get a chance. WF can even proc off it's proccs.
---
Here is one you should like.  When flying to Gadgetzan, while you are in the shimmering flats, look to the right and you can see tracks leading up to a black spot in the mountains.  Once you go over the mountains and land at gadgetzan, look to the west, you'll see smoke.  Go visit that smoke spot.
---
Thanks. Leaning onto that option as well.
---
I personally agree with blizzard, keep politics out of gaming, because if you let this slide then you would have to let people giving out other political comments slide too, if a guy said something everyone disagreed with like something pro communist, everyone would call for him to be banned, and it would cause a whole load of trouble, it's in Blizzard's best interest to keep political opinions of all kinds out of games
---
Questing is not bad anywhere. Im on the second highest pop pvp server in US and ive maybe pvped 10 times while questing, winning at least half of those as well.
---
Gotta remember theres a lot of average pvpers. If youre above average you will win unless youre on the worst pvp build of all time.
---
Also start your own rfd grps if u cant find any. Be proactive about it and you get a grp within 10min easy.
---
There is also a crashed pod on the other side of town. Possibly from thousand needles
---
Yeah, it's just the nature of raids with 40 people.  
---
Much less responsibility per each player, than in 25 ones.
---
That's what I usually do!
---
But what about people who are not the tank? Or tanks who call themselves tank but don't have all that much HP because they run around in off-gear with the only change being wearing a shield?
---
I'm level 56 and I just got Healing Touch Rank 10.
---
It heals 2.2 k on average. In my healing gear I have about 2.4 k HP and it's similar for most DPS around my level. While some tanks actually are at about 4k hp, some others barely are over 3k.
---
Should I just leave them at 30% and wait until they drop to 10% because otherwise I'd overheal? The Fire-elementals in BRD, when they both cast their nasty stuff at once, do 1k damage in the blink of an eye. So leaving people below 1k hp really ain't an option!
---
I think that having Rank 8 that heals for 1.5k and Rank 5 that heals for 800 bound aswell is much better.
---
Of course I don't spam them. I use them to bring people close to their max-hp with one single cast because the amount they heal is very significant compard to most people's health.
---
Disagree 100%. I was doing Azshara grinding runs on an epic mount and it was taking me twenty minutes to do one circuit sometimes. That was leaving absolutely loads of areas unexplored and mainly looking for ores.
---
Ok just looked it up, and one thing it gets right is decay
---
Yeahh only that Dalrends isnt even your BiS, Peacemaker is
---
Mad throwback
---
You not aware of what disney and apple have to do with this conversation just shows how hypocritical all this mess is.
---
Cannot be dodged, blocked or parried.
---
*Miss*
---
Windfury is OP and i love it
---
Is this supposed to be impressive? Most of the guys you were fighting didn't even fight back. I just see a bunch of people wasting each others time here
---
&gt;You will use a two hander tanking until ZF or even BRD at 50
---
While it can be done, I wouldn't suggest this, really, because it's very hard on the healer. Unless you run with a known healer, the damage mitigation from the shield is always better.
---
Also, an often-overlooked advantage of a shield is that you can use shield bash to interrupt casters and pull them back.
---
When you go to the AH do you see a Scan button? It has to scan the AH once to build a database of prices. I do a scan once a week or so to keep prices more current.
---
You really should just suck it up good ass shit u can get from questing there including a trinket if you dont have any which can save your ass.
---
Just having some fun :D
---
What? I'm pretty sure I tried and it didn't work, similar to how you can't tame zebras or thunder lizards.
---
Herzlichen Glückwunsch and why do you have your mace bound?
---
Your guild/raid leaders decided to let rogues roll on it, if anything its 100% their fault that it went to a rogue.
---
Dont blame the people winning the rolls, blame the people making the lootrules (which in this case were rather stupid).
---
Yes. But psst thats a secret.
---
I’m fully aware of how they are involved, but at some point you either stand up for your values, or continue to say...”what about them, they’re doing it too.” And continue to be apathetic.
---
The video has paladins though, so we can assume OP is alliance. No enhance Shamans to worry about there!
---
 Huh?
---
It doesnt. I asked for an average. Not my server.
---
Probably because of layering
---
Those randoms should be grateful they even had a chance at rolling on Bindings.
---
fucking RIP those of us who bought a normal 900g mount just before the announcement thinking they couldn't wait until phase 2.
---
I value the absence of politics in my video games purely meant for entertainment 
---
That being said overwatch stands purely on political pandering but i want to ignore that right now 
---
The hearthstone player knew full well what he could expect for doing this 
---
Blizzard had no choice tbh bc the company profits are worth more than a social media protest thing
---
Wow you did it good then. I'm working in IT-field too but i already had my vacation =( At least i can play sometimes at my work.
---
These skulls regularly bug out for someone in the raid/party. All of my friends and myself had someone miss out on a skull on one of the 4 dragons.
---
No, he just wasn't sure the paladin was holy till someone whispered him. That's why the holy icon doesn't appear at first.
---

Jesus get geforce experience and learn how to record like human not ape, btw ur ui is disgusting
---
shut the fuck up you now exactly what you did
---
How do I vote against this?
---
Level 41-50 is brutal and feels rewarding. You get a big spike in power at 40 and then after that other talent points are rarely impactful. Quests are spread out across word and a ton of time is spent travelling unless you're a super organized player.
---
You have to be at least in range for your threat to register on a mob, especially if you play in a raid group instead if a party. OP most likely was healing at max range from a boss and his threat wasn't registering properly.
---
Starwars is a disney product fool. Disney bows to China fool.
---
What does it have to do with this convo? Because that same company is doing what blizzard is doing. And your response shows me how blind you are and how all you do is follow the crowd. Damn man your pathetic
---
You can't. MUHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
tl;dr
---
Blizzard took a political stand by selectively enforcing values terms of service. And this isn’t about keep politics out of gaming. It’s about standing up for what you believe in. Especially when you have a large platform to do it from.
---
Warrior was 4d 12h played when I dinged 60 (melee cleave). Currently at work so cant check correct /played on mage, but hes around 6 days last time I checked. 
---
57-60 went quite fast but this really depends on your class / gear a lot. I did  55-60 EPL / WPL quests and it was pretty decent XP and gold.
---
I don't give a shit about the drama, it will be forgotten in a week anyway. But hey, at least with so many people quitting the servers will lose layers faster and that's a nice thing.
---
Darn you, alliance!
---
You'll need those 11 points for consecration in holy, but precision, improved righteous fury and blessing of sanctuary should help quite a bit in addition to the mitigation talents like more/better block. The prot pallies I know even tell me, it is great for leveling, so you probably won't lose much compared to ret.
---
Oh I didn't know I had to do something to make it work, this is the first time I use add-ons. Thanks mate!
---
YOU BUY CAT? 50 MSK?

You need a backslash, four spaces, or just some other text in front of that #showtooltip in order to keep it from registering as a header.

---
You don't get spell power from int. and you don't get spell crit from spell power.
---
Thunderfury was a unicorn in Vanilla and guilds decided very far in advance who will get it so it didn't cause as much drama because Brutality Blades and Core Hound Tooths were drama enough.
---
Of course you got angry nerds whispering you. Even if somebody else got the bindings they would get whispered the same shit.
---
Start planning your grind and go get the sword and fuck people up with it.
---
Did this for the first time yesterday
---
Dual wield fury with daggers tho
---
This. It was just worrisome seeing a pally join because it probably meant more competition. But when they say holy, you’re like yooo welcome!

As a warrior, you can get a healer friend and farm DM:East. You can clear it and mine the rich thorium veins at the end. Since you can 2 man the instance, you can also sell runs for some great gear like the caster necklace off the Water elemental boss. 
---
Disenchanting would be useful on gear that would be a profit to d/e over vendoring or to d/e unique items during your farm.
---
Tbf the people who delete their accounts over this are people I’ll never get along with anyways
---
Seize the asstoucher !!!!
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
Exactly they put profits ahead of their own stated core values. I’ll spend my money elsewhere.
---
I mean, if they didn't want you to win them, they should have started a discussion on who should be allowed to roll *before* the roll happened. Once you've allowed someone to roll, you have to accept it if they win.
---
Imagine the amount of self-entitlement it takes if it wasn't a joke...
---
Worth noting that most servers have more horde I guess - might not be any different
---
Omg how dumb are you? You're not leaving. You're just talking shit on Reddit. If you're leaving, send me your gold.
---
I understand that. That doesn't mean I need to include real world politics when I'm playing a video game about fictional politics.
---
I can separate the two and enjoy myself in World of Warcraft, while using my personal channels to discuss politics.

Do you want to know why people don't take you seriously?

Problem is, these hypocrites are just unsubbing because they _know_ they will play again. All is just basically internet point whoring.
---
Just shut up, classic just barely came out
---
I'm not defending anyone or saying what Blizzard did is right. But I see everybody unsubbing like Blizzard is the devil when in fact China is the devil and they should boycott China and everything that's made in China along with every company that has ties to it and stuff labeled "Made in China".

Yep all of it. I unlike you, have a spine, and values.
---
That's prepared the multiboxer, the biggest multiboxer in WoW.
---
Daggers normalize at 1.7 speed.
---
So the damage on instant attacks from *attack power* gets multiplied down as if it were a weapon with the same DPS at 1.7 speed.
---
You still get the base damage from the weapon, but the contribution to instant attacks from attack power is constant.
---
Imo it's even cooler on alliance. Simply cause they have no access to UD mounts which are similar.
---
Same with the ZG  mounts: the tiger is cooler on the horde while the raptor is cooler on the alliance.
---
&gt;I wanted to heal deadmines, but I put my first 10 points into Feral Combat (for solo leveling) and the group I found didn't want me to heal because I wasn't full resto. (we didn't actually start the dungeon so maybe I wouldn't have done that well then...)
---
Their loss. At that level, spec doesn't dictate viability of fulfilling a role.
---
I think uninstalling is a step farther that what I want to take. I did however unsubscribe. Let Blizzard crunch numbers and see how the immediate downward spike in revenue following their decision to back China

Its all-time bis for tanks and infinitely better than every other option they have. For rogues its highly debattable as a bis-offhand compared to f.e. iblis or hungering cold from naxx.

Over 100 runs, around 20 drops and no luck, I just got my T1.  Fk ubrs I'll never run this agai... damnit the ring :/
---
Haha it was just in my feed. Think it was a video called "always Sunny out of context£
---
I was with you till you mentioned Arcanite Reaper. Till that point, I was convinced you meant fury warriors using 2 slow weapons instead of a slow MH and a fast OH.
---
The reason Arcanite Reaper is/was the shit -no clue if normalization is in classic or not, I play a healer, never cared- is because it was very slow which means it was compensated for that with a higher damage range. So every single attack that scales off that damage (unlike Eviscerate) will do a lot more damage, for example Mortal Strike.
---
The other thing about fury warriors using 2 slow weapons; that's, to my older than 10 years old understanding, due to Flurry. If you use a fast OH weapon, which also happens to have a damage penalty, you eat up the extra attacks from Flurry with that fast weapon for weak hits. You don't want that.
---
And normalization was brought in in whatever patch, it basically brought weapon speeds in line with each other. That was when Arcanite Reaper stopped being THE weapon for arms warriors. Again, I don't know if this is in classic or not.

"At some point" like more than half of your things aren't made in China and you will continue living the same life you did before just boycotting Blizzard while supporting China without even knowing.
---
Mmm you only blocked out the names of your non lvl 60?  Is this gone be a reoccurring thing where the names will slowly be revealed?
---
Stay tuned to find out.
---
1. HandyNotes plus HandyNotes NPCs should do the trick.
---
I don't know about the other 2
---
yes. the DMN boss is a bit tricky, but DME is essy as hell. pull -&gt; blizzard -&gt; cash. 
---
it helps if yiu have herbalism, because there are some dreamfoil and gromsblood spawns which will make good money :)
---
And don't forget the additional 1000g for the skill and the mount. This dude somehow managed to farm 1600g in a month
---
Makes sense, Zug is train in German.
---
&gt;Just give him the item or what?
---
Yeah? Obviously
---
He fucked up by breaching his contract. He is a professional and should act acordingly. But you do you. He is not terminated for anything else, he should never had signed that contract in the first place. But hey, keep removing your accounts. Makes wow classic less butthurt
---
Way to edit your original comment. You have no values, you stand for nothing.
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization)
---
Thanks! Glad somebody gets it. I'm actually just going on holiday for a month and won't be able to play.
---
That being said, I do feel Blizzard were far too extreme with their punishment. I hope they reconsider.
---
I made no mention of money, where the hell did you get that from? Politics has no place in video games, it will always cause problems like this.
---
I should add, I do this from my under 60 alt characters not my main :p
---
Omg I did so shitty damage on Ragnaros because I kept getting thrown in the lava and had to get out and go back
---
What the actual fuck. Are they implying that healing does not cause threat?
---
Moral of the story, never be the healer.
---
Pls stop.
---
I know...debated with myself about the zug zug-zug. Thought nobody would get it tho
---
get pallypower, never forget again.
---
Gold, probably.
---
That's the problem with game right now.  
---
You either play healer with friends, or you play solo as feral.  
---
That group is definitely morons, because everybody could heal DM, if they had at least some gear with int/spirit.  
---
In general, if you want to level fast - you need to play as feral/tank. 
---
As full time healer you will have tremendous issues completing quests alone.    
---
Also healer druids are gimped right now, because you don't have resurrect. So if anyone in your party dies - they would need to run from the entrance (if you don't have pala/shaman/priest alive in party).  
---
I would recommend you to play as bear/cat, tanking dungons in bear form and killing every quest mob in cat form, with a [build like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5030220303222151)  
---
While druid could do multiple things, it make game much harder and less comfortable for you.
---
This is brilliant thank you dying here
---
seems to work for me
---
Yes , god forbid we have to deal with all these loud hooligans fighting for their future.
---
No, if you have cleared some bosses in MC, then this affects the entire raid, if nobody is zoned in. If you try to zone into a fresh MC run, with others, you wont be able to enter the instance. 
---
Only reason to do half a pug raid, would be on the day or two days before reset.
---
Yep let's tolerate human rights abuses.  All you need to commit atrocities is a wishy woshy TOS
---
Do engineering target dummies just generate threat or do they taunt when you place them down? Target Dummies give some amount of items when they die, but also proc Spirit Tap at least on expiration so I'm kinda interested in testing some raid applications (if the best target dummies "yield experience").
---
If you are interested in actual serious Shaman Tanking they can tank raids, if give the right amount of effort: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
This is not even true. You're an idiot
---
You mean maraudon.
---
a really bad one
---
I’ve already read the wiki and don’t understand a lick of it. That’s why I’m here. 
---
The page even mentions barmans Shanker, but doesn’t at all go into detail how it actually works.
---
It is a purely aesthetic thing, it's not like it kicks you out of the AH or bank window. Real trolling would be the Warock Infernal in the AH, now that is actually disruptive.
---
He is not immune to fear either. Easy quest for warlocks.
---
I tamed one a couple of weeks ago :) It is totally possible!
---
Here you go to help with arguments

If I do it without knowing it it’s still better than doing it while being fully aware of it and not caring
---
Sooo.... I’m still not sure I understand.
---
Do I look at dps or dmg? Does it matter? Is it still a good idea to have a slow wep equipped in my main hand?
---
&gt; WF can even proc off it's procs.
---
I have never seen this happen in Vanilla or Classic.
---
Me getting my shit together in life:

* weak attempts*

...ahhh fuck it
---
Wands never scaled with AP, Private server bug
---
Paladin SoC is a PPM.
---
There was one in my realm during pandaria. Everyone would run when he was coming because he would cause a lag so great youd get disconnected. He had guilds dedicated to his death alone.
---
Similar thing happened to me as a druid with the Onyxia mount at 70. Also happened to win with a 98. Same situation with pug and guildies. Though people were more upset cause that was around the time druids got flight form. Also won the VoA mammoth with the the same guild but got pressured into giving it away since I won Onyxia and no one forgot about that (since I swore up and down it'd only use it since I won) up until I stopped playing retail id run VoA for that Mammoth. Never saw it again. This time round. I'm going with what the dice say.
---
It's a BIS item for you, why should you be guilty?
---
Who cares if you're not 60. You're going to be 60 soon enough.
---
We're trying to have a healthy conversation here. If you don't like it, try not to insult people and share your thoughts. This way we can take your words more serious. Also: Rule #2
---
In this case it's a honest and good movement, but what happens in the future if we get another case like the IRA? Violent attacks and innocent people being killed to fight for the future that those who are killed will never get. Should people who show support for that movement on stream get banned?
---
Twitch.tv/preferedwow there ya go
---
I did the same thing as a Dwarf with Darnassus rep. Think I spent 700g on runecloth, then 910g on the mount + training, and I stil have 1000g spare. Farming gold at max level is really not as hard as people seem to belive.
---
If blizzard stands up for themselves I’ll happily return, and thank you, that’s a very useful list.
---
The only application I notice this is in WoW, nothing in CS:GO, Dota2 etc, and in those other games you use your mouse waay more.
---
Clearly a blizzard issue
---
I'm good. I like the thought of TBC coming one day. Feral druids ftw.
---
I'll follow Rexxar =&gt; Win
---
I don't want it *now* but TBC was best WoW ever. Definitely needs to happen.
---
That's a lot of gold. I have Herb and I am seeing nothing even close to that. Care to share
---
Demo roar to get their initial attention, then rotate maul. Swipe as a rage dump, its not great threat and only hits 3 mobs.
---
Growl to get a mob back onto you if it is attacking someone else.

Prepared 32x multiboxer on Faerlina
---
It never existed, pserver bug
---
Ah, thanks for the correction! Already thinking of DM ;).
---
but why tho? isnt that what the starting bid is for?
---
He did express that and got what he could’ve expected but valued his message over the ban 
---
That’s fine I respect that 
---
So blizzard not wanting to anger business partners that bring massive cash is a political statement ? 
---
Blizzard wants no part in this thing 
---
They either get shit by valued business partners or get shit by the community and people deactivating their accounts who will prolly resub anyways
---
They view you as a npc to help them quest
---
Oh damn you right fuck
---
I mean I am at lvl 60 and I don't think I can make 1600g a month. I'm a healer and I have a job. I can definitely make some money but nowhere near 1600g. You gotta have the right class and A LOT of time for that.
---
You use mouse quite differently in CS:GO. You dont spampress rightmouse while turning. Or it can be that rawmouse issue.
---
Technically though, what he’s saying isn’t false. November/December is not next week.
---
No fancy picture, but for everyone who can't open wowhead at work:
---
* 6 large brilliant shards
---
* 35 black dragonscales
---
* 25 dark iron ore
---
* 10 elixier of shadowpower (30 ghost mushrooms, 10 crystal vial to craft)
---
* 3 arcanite bars (3 thorium bars, 3 arcane crystals to craft)
---
* 150 gold
---
* 250 gold, which can be saved if you know a warlock that already has the necessary items (bell, wheel, candle) already and does the run with you. I expect there will be warlocks who sell mountruns, should save some gold.
---
Back then raid mechanics were kept hidden for you to basically discover as well. And guilds that has figured them out would usually not share them with others so that they could get an edge on their server too.
---
No problem! Glad to be helpful. Have fun getting rid of all these things. Otherwise you're not standing up to it. You know it'll be like "Fuck Blizzard! Boycott!!" along with "I bought my new iPhone today." and "Wanna watch the new Star Wars series on Disney together?"
---
lol, I had a feeling this would be the first comment.
---
tl;dr, rogues are awesome.
---
I put my money where my mouth is, you clearly value your video game more that human rights. What more is there to say to you
---
It depends on your crit and spellpower, but typically as frost mage the crit to spellpower value is around 8-12 sp to 1% crit. so like 5-7 int to get 1 spellpower worth of damage.
---
Dude this was golden!
---
Right now, the economies are still building, so people don't have the most disposable income just yet. Selling stuff with bad stats is a bad idea, because you likely won't even get a bite from someone trying to level enchanting.
---
I sell probably 2/3 the greens I list, I just make sure to stick to the rule of, "Only try to sell it if someone on the class will reasonably be able to use it." No agility cloth, for instance, or int plate if you're horde.
---
+4 auschwitz
---
Was AOE farming wrong according to a fellow mage.
---
That's not what I'm asking about.
---
When people stop my alt on high level characters to chat about how I like the class or offer me wisdom. I always engage and thank them. Then had someone craft me worse amour then what I was wearing. It cracks me up how helpful people are and how excited they seem to be up reach out to help low levels.
---
Well, I was able to do some rfd. I would say, do Uldaman. Maybe you can trash farm some ZF. I noticed that a lot of people is willing to summon a tank to do ZF so I mostly staid in Ironforge waiting for a summon or some guys doing Uldaman. Im lvl 48 and I started getting into ZF groups since 46. 2 levels mostly with that dungueon looks promising and I am almost about to just grind dungueons til 60 xd
---
Same way dude. I get obsessive over shit sometimes. Glad to hear you are normal lol. Grats on 2 lvl 60s!
---
Had a hunter roll on Whitemane’s Chapeau against me because “he uses mana too, he needs the int”.
---
Exactly. You didn't give a shit until 6 months ago when the protests started. You also enjoyed playing Blizzard games until a few days ago when this big bad corporation brought the hammer down on the little man.
---
Now you're acting all righteous with a huge side of ignorance and you're even defending your ignorance.
---
Pathetic and hypocritical.
---
It works best after about level 24. Basically you put your talents into the affliction tree, focusing on + to drain life. Because that's how you kill mobs. You don't use void walker after level 24, it has trouble holding agro. Since the monster is beating you anyway, you throw your dots on the mob, drain life, and let succubus attack it.
---
It sounds sketchy. I wasn't a believer until I tried it. It gets way better as you gain levels and talent points. You do have to be careful at first. Before trying it, I would recommend watching video guides on picking the talents and the fighting.
---
I’m currently a level 49 ret and I feel like I’m doing something wrong, my gear seems ok although I’m still using ravanger which I guess I should replace by now.
---
Mobs my level 1v1 just seem so hard sometimes, if I don’t heal, I will often kill the mob with 5% hp left myself.
---
Just not sure what else I can do, auto attack with seal up and occasional judge.
---
Am I bad, is it my gear or just paladin Leveling?
---
Yeah so let's just ignore it while we play WoW in our little bubbles
---
Is this some guys getting salty cus someone won't group with him for mob killing and he's standing around waiting for respawns?
---
uh what?
---
&gt;On my warrior (who I leveled to 60 in  vanilla), I was still used to non-MMO games, and didn't think to look  at DPS or damage ranges of weapons (pretty sure you can see where this  is going). The last weapon I had when I hit 60 was the thrash blade,  why? Because I thought 'Hey! It has a chance to do (do, not proc, I  didn't even know the terminology at the time) an EXTRA attack!'. Among  the sub par warriors, I showed how far down you can go. Heck, I'd even  been considering ditching plate armor for leather because leather tended  to have better agility and I thought 'critical hits!'.
---
im not sure thats good news or bad news.
---
thrash blade IS great for warriors at 60 and leather armor IS great aswell\^\^
---
Most I come across do
---
I'd suck Chairman Xi's dick for 10 more minutes of classic Wow.
---
One of the things that contribute to this feeling is that you actually have to focus and learn your character in Classic. In retail everything is so mind numbingly easy that you just float through the game without paying too much attention. So you don't build that same connection with your character.
---
Nice, your dog already logged you in. Good boi
---
That makes it sound like what he did was accidental
---
Blizzard fucked up
---
Leveled up a char to lvl 40 and changed my mind. 37 now. Let's see what comes next xD
---
There were amazing things in TBC. Candy colored spaceships and flying mounts were not those. Also I feel like it kinda started the dumbing down of wow.
---
Well yeah that’s the point for many people
---
Yes, I read somewhere that 8 Int roughly compares to 1 spell power, but there was no source on this.  
---
I'm looking for the math behind it. Do you remember where you might have see something on this?
---
They aint gonna use the xbow neither, 6 ap difference only but dw with more prry for pvp
---
Yeah, I've had this as well. I'm NA EST playing on Herod and typically average 32ms, but recently I will occasionally see it spike to 450-550ms and stay there for an extended time, often 30+ min. It mainly happens at late night 1am-4am in that window. 
---
As another said, a router reset does seem to help but is not a permanent solution.
---
I think Hunter's Mark was the one exception to the rule and does get removed by Vanish, but I'm not confident in that answer.
---
"no but that's different, i don't personally like that movement"
---
My priest has been 60 for a couple of weeks now, did quests until I Could do stockades then just did stockades over and over, then gnomer for gear, a few more lvls of questing then once I could enter SM I never quested again pretty much. Only farming the SM wings, then ZF then BRD and ending on LBRS
---
we had both the left binding and eye in yesterday's raid, is it that rare?
---
&gt; People forget that MC isn't tough.
---
But Robe of Volatile Power is a drop many want and I'm not even sure it's an upgrade at that level.
---
Robe of the Void is not just good to start raiding, you can easily wear it after MC.
---
Yeah it crossed my mind as well.. but dunno this server seems so dead, i dont think ive seen a single redditor mentioning they play here. I knew this would happen but eh
---
Fuck mages.
---
&gt; I know it has been said a thousand times that Paladins can't tank raid bosses. I would like too see sources on this and hard evidence other than anecdots. If a paladin was in full MC and Ony Epics, could they tank raid bosses, why or why not?
---
&gt; I haven't heard anything about Druid tanks, so if anyone knows if Druids can tank bosses or they can't, why? Please include sources.
---
&gt; A warrior tank is hands down the best tank, but if you want too say "why not just have warrior tanks instead." This isnt part of the discussion i want too have, as that does detract from the topic at hand.
---
They can tank raid bosses, if give the right amount of effort and played with people who know what they are doing. Druids can tank raid bosses. Hell, I play a Shaman Tank and they can tank raid bosses.
---
Only retail retard Zoomers are in a hurry to hit level 60.
---
Lmao 1 multibox vs a guild damn that multiboxer was probably having fun
---
It's worse though, less damage and a faster speed.
---
Not anymore in this patch.
---
Same same ... First 2 weeks, many people connected at any time.
---
Now some have left, some connect maybe twice a week.
---
Hopes of raiding together is now long gone
---
Or alt-gr + I with an English keyboard I think.
---
It costs them money no matter what at the point he made his stand 
---
Being involved in politics is bad in every way for a company like this
---
&gt; They don't have a taunt. Isn't that the whole problem?
---
No taunt is not a deal breaker. We've rectified this issue years ago.
---
I just buy a thousand of the Argent Dawn food and mail it to myself every once in awhile, mage consumables are garbage.
---
Keep supporting them man, it’s clearly more important to you.
---
Oh, look nice.
---
Didn't think about shirt will take a look. Thank.
---
Yup, that's not a bad thing either. I'm more of a 10-men raids guy myself but 40s are nice overall, and a bit more relaxing.
---
We only have to wait for ~2 seconds for our hits to miss!
---
shiiiiiiit XD I was writing it down for tonight, guess it's useless now
---
Exactly, if we let one slide then there will be outcry when you don't let another slide, it's just easier to say no to all political opinions
---
I run 26/5/20 with sword spec (undead). It’s a fun build that revolves around sunder spam triggering sword+wf+hoj and generating rage. Pretty nice build for 5mans and allows for an occasional 2h ss+ww combo on the pull before swapping to shield. Better damage compared to deep prot when not tanking, can basically do hamstring spam for wf+sword+hoj procs in current raids. This is obviously much better on horde side.
---
Impale does scale with crit though, so I usually use some good dps pieces unless mobs hit too hard. I thought about the build a few weeks ago, but switched this weekend after seeing kungen having the same idea. Liking it so far!
---
It’s not about tolerating and no atrocity was committed by blizzard 
---
They tried to minimize dmg after the hearthstone players statement that’s all
---
If I had to guess, I’d say OP and this guy were both AOE grinding the same packs and this guy is mad at the way OP is pulling/grouping.
---
I heard about strategy that you could start with Rejuvenation on yourself right before pull.  
---
This way your self-healing will generate some AoE aggro.  
---
Also you could activate Enrage right after pull - first it will give you rage for swiping, and second - getting rage also produce additional threat.
---
It's slightly better from the base damage of the weapon, moreso if you don't have much attack power yet.
---
But once you get a weapon with better damage, that's better. Which wouldn't have necessarily been the case before normalization.
---
Technically higher dps on a faster weapon is better at some point but I wouldn't know how to weigh that against top-end damage on a rogue.
---
&gt; That and there’s no way to mitigate crushing blows other than an ability that takes a crushing blow to trigger...
---
You mitigate damage from cblow by getting massive amount of armor, just like druids. You are literally worried about something that is not relevant.
---
Ye when i get The urge to try somth else i simply dont play for 1-3 days. I think everyone gets tired of the grind sometimes
---
No you aren't, you literally just posted a [change.org](https://change.org) link
---
I use wand too, I need agility &gt;:)
---
Yeah asmon did it on stream so now eeeeverybody wants to do it too
---
I must be doing what you're doing, cause I'm also always doing it wrong.
---
Instead of weapon speed being a factor in the equation, it now uses a normalized value of 1.7 for daggers.
---
Tbh I don't really know why^^
---
Do humans racial increase rep for runecloth turn in? Sorry if its a stupid question.
---
Hypocrite and a liar. I'm go play some WoW. This world could get hit by an asteroid tomorrow and I wouldn't care. But I'm done wasting my time taling to you. Enjoy your Ben Shapiro sheep. It's been awhile since I've felt bad for someone online. It feels like I'm talking to some dude with autism. 
---
Late.
---
Actually it's 2:2. Not uncommon to stealth two rogues/druids to deeptram, having a warlock breaking through as well and then summoning a whole raid
---
Wait I can actually reply to this? Usually you lock threads whenever you try to address this stuff lol.  God like seriously, I can’t articulate how often that has been the case. You ppl are so not the reason I’m on here, and I deeply wish there was an alternative.
---
that is a bingo
---
I did tailoring and enchanting on my priest. The only down fall is that you very rarely vendor any gear bc you DE it for mats. So you lose out on all that gold. If you have a higher level main then it doesn’t matter so much. If I could redo it. I would go herb and alchemy. Consumables is the way to go. People always gonna use and have to keep buying.
---
lol really? that sucks
---
Hey, are you EU? &lt;3
---
Thanks, that gives me hope :)
---
&gt; crit
---
hit
---
Bwahaha u got so rekt
---
What is your current spec? 
---
I would recommend running either uldaman or maraudon, the last bosses (archaedas and princess theredras) drop good two handers that will last you a while. I noticed a big improvement after getting princess theredras' scepter. 
---
I often judge on cooldown, with sanctity aura on. With mostly plate gear, some with intellect, and with BoW I don't have to drink that often. I also use HoJ on cooldown and judge while the mob is stunned. It adds up. I also judge crusader on every mob. 
---
I'm not having too hard of a time to be honest.
---
Did you joined LookingforGroup channel?  
---
install Puggle addon, join LookingForGroup, add one more chat window, filter /4 channel to that window and remove it from General.  
---
Now you have your own LFG addon! :)
---
WF can't proc WF. That was patched very, very early in vanilla, perhaps even the beta and I've seen multiple youtube videos spreading that misinformation.
---
“I’m go play some wow” - ChocolateReptar. 
---
I’m going to stand up for my values. Bye
---
Same thing happened to me, we had fun questing doing Deadmines, but then they all left. They got to 30-40. Now I'm about to ding 60 and am "friendless" on my server, other people I know started different servers and are approaching 60. I wish the character transfers were more open and not set to those 5 same realms :(
---
The drama is super overblown anyway. Blizzard should crack down on people representing them that do things that actively hurt their business. Just the "woke" police misinformed as always.
---
Might be worth changing to free up a good hot key for something more useful. Aber nochmals Glückwunsch on 60, pre-bis mace and hopefully a few more good from instances items.
---
Some of use alt-codes at work. But then my coworkers also think I’m weird for knowing them
---
It's simple chat parser. What is bannable there?  
---
Also there's tons of such addons. I prefer Puggle, for example.
---
In early raids as Horde, you will probably out damage DW Fury because of Windfury. 
---
In just about every raid as Alliance, you will get out damaged by DW Fury.
---
In either case, 2h Fury is still fine. The only real issue is that BT doesn't scale with weapon damage.
---
This is really BS.
---
The GM said that you didnt generate enough Threat, but He forgets that healing does in fact generate Threat in a 1:0,5 ratio.
---
That means ur 18k heals equals to over 9K Threat..
---
Ah, flying mounts... making wpvp 100% avoidable and meaningless.
---
Lake at the middle-south of Ashenvale.
---
Pretty sure this was a joke
---
I liked the flying mounts of tbc.
---
I've leveled lvl 1 to 60 playing prot, using only 1h+shield in dungeons (2h while questing but thats irrelevant), and I'm now raiding with my guild. At no point did I have any significant problem holding aggro. Of course not all mobs can or need to be tanked, but at no point a correct tank should be the reason for your wype, even if he plays 1h+shield.
---
and then the holy paladin still rolls on your items cause "need it for questing"
---
&gt; Yeah... I’m not even going to try.
---
A 60 warlock can solo farm that with ease.
---
Hahah yeah.
---
Arcanite Reaper is pretty badass if you can afford to make it.
---
If you were Lucky and farmed devilsaurs alone a few weeks ago you could make that amount in a day
---
Tanks that understand their place?
---
Anal rend
---
what was the command to remove the ghostly appearance when you are dead, the white filter
---
Aye, you also got the "Legend of Zelda" quest in Un'Goro ending with you collecting the triforce :)
---
&gt; That GM response is nonsense.
---
par for the course.
---
No. The starting bid is whatever the fuck the auctioneer wants it to be and has no bearing on end price.
---
Why? Because if I'm selling something and only one person places a bid that is well below what I'm happy to accept, then I can say no (which is fair in the eyes of the law). 
---
The only exception is if there is a reserve on the item, which is decided by the owner of the item. If the bid goes over the reserve, then legally it has to be sold for that price. If its under the reserve, it gets "passed in", meaning the auctioneer will go to the owner of the item and ask if they would like the accept / negotiate to finalise sale.
---
Is the letter not enough to trigger the CoD? It has a note in there also. Never really used or received CoD much
---
What's wrong with healing yourself? That's an integral part of your kit, of course you're going to struggle if you only use half of it.
---
This is exactly what i am referring to. Excellent warriors will swap stance when the situation calls for it. You can be a good warrior and perform your role with success. You can also be an excellent warrior.
---
That is the same comment someone said in IF when magni yelled that alliance mage, jnxd has made peace with timbermaw hold.
---
Does no one have lionheart pattern on your server? Arcanite prices should be way higher since every warrior will want to craft it.
---
its basically to stop you looting a chest, if someone else is clearing to it, and you then run in and open it while they are fighting the last mob.  
---
its not a bug, its a proximity feature. 
---
its the same as you might not aggro a mob, but as soon as you go to mine or herb, they'll then run to you.
---
I'm just gonna say this. If you keep referring to it as a dress and don't want to wear it then be a cool guy and also find something else to wear in BWL.
---
Because you don't get to call it a dress then adore and wear the best looking set that was ever made in the game because that also looks a lot like a dress.
---
I was struggling from 7-10 as druid, so slow... but after getting bear form.. man is it like night and day!! So excited to get back on it tonight.
---
This, a million times. This, in my personal opinion, is the major issue with MMORPGs today. I have no idea how to fix it, but it's a huge problem.

I guess retail retard zoomers cleaned up every raid so far then lol
---
There are no actual real world politics in your game about fictional politics, don't worry. It's a parallel you have the choice to draw. 
---
I respect that some would prefer to ignore it, but saying that they should not entwine is a ridiculous and impossible statement. What you mean to say is 'I choose to ignore the political idealogies present in the fiction I consume' for whatever reason. That's fine. The political climate of the world is bleak and I play for escapism too.
---
For the record, I would hope people aren't taking this seriously because it isn't a serious post - it's flagged as humor, the title is intentionally ironic, and I'm actually just going on holiday for a month. I'll be back to Classic.
---
*slowclap*
---
For the record, my social life is as fantastic as my social skills. Thanks for a very uneducated insight!
---
Or just do not change classic since we came here for the more or less "classic experience"
---
As a paladin I always try to buff imps but it's really annoying with thier phaseshift which makes them untargetable. I like to buff the whole party at once outside of combat so I dont have to think about it  more than every 5 minutes, but imps can only be buffed in combat :(
---
I know there are arena tournaments. Having a wide screen there doesn't really do much because it's a small contained area.
---
I know there are world first events. Having a wide screen there doesn't do much either because usually it's a small contained area with little suprises and pre planned tactics. Also with all the raid addons you don't really have to pay attention to you'r surroundings that much.
---
Overwatch is a fast paced FPS shooter where having a high FOV actually gives you an advatage over the low FOV players. 
---
Get it?
---
Oh lol  another  rog!
---
I know how u feel. I never had any friends to start
---
26 days played on classic?
---
It's only been out for like 40 days??
---
Gerade ab 55 würde ich viel Dugeons gehen, guck das du bei denen die Quests machst für viel EP und du kannst Loot bekommen, was du ja eh brauchst. :)
---
Ich hab BRD&gt; Strat UD &gt; Questen bis 57 &gt; Strat Living &gt; Scholo &gt; Ony prequest starten LBRS &gt; UBRS gemacht mit ein wenig Grinden dazwischen reicht das für lvl 60. Als Krieger hab ich die Redemtion Quest von Fordring gemacht vor Scholo und die Zelda ref. Quest mit ein paar Ungooro Quests auf dem Weg zu 57.  
---
Viel Spaß!
---
So fucking glad i went DS / Ruin for raids / instances. Not having to loss 10-20 % of my dmg because a pet is dead is nice.
---
&gt; Crushing blow is the same general problem that too many incoming attacks is.
---
&gt; That is to say healers have long cast times, and tank health pools just aren't that huge compared to the total damage dealt over the course of a fight. Even in a quality group, tanks health bars bob up and down like yoyos on tougher pulls.
---
&gt; Too much burst (be it through a crit crushing blow or X mobs hitting together) won't give the healer time to cast their spell on you without accidentally overhealing. Or you might just die before they manage to heal you at all. That last one is the big worry with crushing blows, healers need to predict damage a fair bit. Their ability to drop instant saving spells is either heavily time gated or horrendously mana inefficient.
---
&gt; Which is why Shaman tanks are likewise not considered viable. They can't get enough mitigation or health bar to deal with crushing/crits and they lack a taunt.
---
Shaman Tanks are my speciality, so I'll share my two cents on the matter, since you said something that is false. Shaman Tanks are viable and yes they can get enough mitigation and heal to deal with crushing/crits and taunt is not a big deal to surmount. I suggest reading this https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
You can also play Retail for that.
---
&gt; Dodge 
---
OVERPOW-miss.
---
yeah, I've just started the WPL cauldren quests, and have plenty to keep me going. 
---
I'm a slow leveller, as I like to run about a bit and explore. Think I'm at about 10 days played already. 
---
Might try to level faster when I make my alt.
---
Dunno about dummies but IIRC ectoplasmic distiller from T0.5 questline can generate a metric fuckton of threat if you place it in the middle of your raid since it contiuously applies a buff to everyone in range.
---
I think it counts all past kills, but not sure if you can reset it. Havent really used it much, just convenient if you farm 1% drop chance items, gives you motivation.
---
Classic just isn't that great for casuals. Only able to play a few hours every other day, the progression is almost none existent and will suck the fun out of the game.
---
Slower is better when similar DPS. 
---
Damage calc is this for white hits 
---
weapon dmg range + attack power / 14 = damage
---
Yellow hits
---
Weapon dmg range + (x * attack power  / 14) + ability specials
---
X is normalized weapon speed, which you can google.
---
On the one hand, I get what you're getting at, and agree with the basic assumption. 
---
On the other, I wonder if a playstyle change could account for that. Basically, hold off on special attacks while Flurry is active, pool the rage from the 3 hits, then quickly use it on BT, possibly Slams, and/or Hamstring in an effort to quickly regain Flurry.
---
I'm with you on this, Classic is the best game for this kind of balance of leveling, community, and end game.
---
Technically speaking, you always need spell power and you should chose it above everything else. period. int have no benefit for damage btw other than crit rate. go try it with your skills with int gear and without int gear. 
---
However if you stack spell power(or frost damage bonus) too much you will observe that you are out of mana too fast or super squishy which puts you in danger in almost every situation. Which means you also need int and stamina as much spell power.
---
So i would suggest to keep it balanced to be more versatile for everything. if you are dead or oom too fast, you can't deal damage after all
---
They can always go prot. Rogues can not
---
&gt; 6 x Arcanite bars (35g ea): 210g
---
What server are you on? Because that shit is cheap. They are around 60 on my server.
---
It won't be amazing pvp, will be spawn camping flying points.
---
We had the same issue with a healer, he was super bummed too. Don't know what response he got however.
---
Help I’m OOTL
---
Enjoy it.
---
Once you hit 60 you'll be lucky for a group invite, let alone a drop.
---
So you post in german language, on a English speaking forum.... and not giving us the translation.....  
---
Making a photo of your screen instead of pressing F12 / screenshot button.
---
entintled stereo type German redditer....
---
Yeah not to bad.
---
But you spam rightmouse 10000x times more in Dota2 for example, and I've been maining tank in Retail for the last couple of expansions and this issue does not occur there, only in Classic.
---
&gt;Ok, all that aside, why didn't y'all just kill the dude again? 
---
Group literally instantly ported away.
---
There are real world politics in my fictional game about fictional politics if people decide to bring it in, such as a certain guy did during an official Blizzard tournament stream.
---
They should not entwine. Not now, not ever. I don't play for escapism, I play because I can enjoy myself. I don't need real world politics to enjoy myself, that's a matter of great importance. Video games are a hobby - politics are not. They should not be "entwined".
---
I highly doubt your last statement. Highly.
---
The vast majority of auctions are reserve auctions. There are very few no reserve auctions, at least in Australia. Usually if this is the case, the auctioneer will announce specifically that there is no reserve and that it Wi be sold for whatever price is reached.
---
Since there is no reserve in wow AH, I'd say that the buyout price is what would be considered the reserve. If it does not reach the buyout price, the seller has the option to decline the offer or "cancel" the bid.
---
Its tricky. I download the extended character stats add on to help play with my gear. I try to pick a good balance of +frost power and +spell power. Haven't gotten to raid yet but my frost bolts can hit almost 700 now
---
What Queue ?  
---
aer you using an add on ?
---
peacemaker from start
---
TLDR: Don't play healers = no quest loot
---
Totally. And thank you mate
---
BRD is the place to be IMO. You can start running LBRS, but if you are a bit too unsure about the pulls, the last part can be a bit painful in pugs. Hit scholo as soon as you can and get the pala-tank set there and you are well on your way.
---
So thats why you hide somewhere that isn't a 'hiding spot'! Somewhere so absolutely barren that they'd have no reason to run past it if looking for someone who is specifically hiding and they have a strict time limit.
---
Unsusbcribed and deleted my lvl 57 Druid.
---
You can't summon through a portal, so no.
---
The good thing, is when BGs are released, you will only wait a few seconds to be summoned in Warsong
---
Except for leveling healers who are collecting gear, especially if the 2h "tank" has some leather pieces "for DPS and aggro". Healers (non-priests at least) without gear of the same level as the dungeon or higher are likely to get shafted with this "superior strategy on every possible way".
---
boomer
---
If you want to crudely put it like that, then yes. But that just backs up my point.
---
I ran MC for the first time we cleared every boss except domo and rag cause we couldnt summon and my t1 chest dropped and I rolled a 1 on it so I'm prolly just quitting
---
this
---
Blizzard needs to step in and modernize the AH imo. #somechanges
---
I also would like to do this
---
It only drops if you name your character Pewdiepie
---
Nah, it's only 25.
---
Hmm, maybe my view of my time with my warrior is clouded because warriors have a tough time in solo PvE and I primarily played solo :p
---
But I'm actually surprised to hear that about the thrash blade, I actually thought it was easily replaced with a weapon off of instances like BRS, BRD, Strat or Scholo.
---
&gt; No instances either.
---
While arcanite reaper seems a better option for both speed, dps and stats ( and looks too ;) ), peacemaker looks like a more viable options.. how much would an arcanite bar cost?
---
Moonglade, because then at least they need to grind rep or kill everything in order to advance through felwood
---
Living the good life.
---
I eat any warrior under 55 for breakfast with my 49 warlock.
---
Are they the ones south of Shimmering Flats near the Kodo bones before Tanaris?
---
There is no skip to Winterspring.
---
Yes.
---
I roll under 10 for like, almost everything ahha. Bad luck rolls suck, but it makes winning something feel that much sweeter.
---
English doesn't really use that many accents, so your average English speaker doesn't have a need to know them. Doesn't really have anything to do with useless keyboards or stupid people, just the English language.
---
I'm in a guild with a merried couple who are playing Prot Warr + Resto Shammy. They are playing super casually and only to run dungeons and so far they are lvl 53 already (im rogue and i am lvl 52, doing quests, dungeons, farming someties). And it is a great pleasure to do dungeons with them . No problems, no vipes, every target is marked all the time, etc.
---
You weren't stealing his tags right?
---
Because that's the scenario in which we both level slower if I catch you doing it repeatedly.
---
Another AoE mage knows exactly how to ruin your pulls and get you killed.
---
But the time I did it the mobs weren't gray to my main yet. so I killed them 2 by 2 until the spawns were under my control and there were no aoe packs for anybody.
---
Be kind my dudes.
---
Oh please tell me you at least got Mortal Strike at some point
---
Auctioneer can sort by price/ea instead of price/stack and, well maybe my server is an anomaly but stacks are often more expensive each than singles. It's annoying as shit but it is what it is
---
What's that addon with the disenchant, market price, etc.?
---
You forgot to account for bonus damage from your own AP on windfury hits, but also for higher damage on specials from sharpening stone. I think windfury should still win but it's much harder to calculate.
---
Hey! These are my guild mates. They are led by a shaman named Splinter.
---
The way attack power works, you get +1 dps per 14 attack power. So let's say you have 560 attack power. This would be +40 dps to your weapon. If your weapon swings once every 3 seconds, this would translate into +120 damage to each attack.
---
However, this made slow weapons excessively powerful with instant attacks. Consider Backstab. This deals "150% Weapon Damage + 15" to the target.
---
The Barman Shanker has 51 - 95 (73 average damage) per attack and a weapon speed of 2. Prior to normalization, your 560 attack power would translate into an average damage of 153. Filtered through Backstab, you'd end up with 245 damage per Backstab.
---
In contrast, Finkle's Skinner has an average damage of 54 and an attack speed of 1.3. So it would end up dealing an average of 106, or 174 with Backstab.
---
Post-normalization, the additional attack power contribution for instant attacks was based on a weapon-specific modifier. For Daggers, it's 1.7. So both the Shanker and the Skinner would receive +68 damage per attack. Note: This does not affect white damage, only instant attacks.
---
This change drops the Shanker to 227 Backstab but increases the Skinner to 206 Backstab (using same numbers from above).
---
It's like Ferrara and Ulm in EU3
---
The only issue is that he can farm it alone.
---
Thank God for Dire Mauls arrival soon. I can't stomach another UBRS run
---
Why would I delete my account and lose all the SP games I already bought? You boycott with your money, not by burning stuff you own for no gain.
---
Why did they leave?
---
Fanatics or not.. still cute
---
Pro tip, never go for the chicken beacon in an area, its always one of the furthest from a graveyard
---
I have leveled both a druid and a shaman to 15 now to see what I would prefer as an alt but I really don’t know what to pick. There are a lot of differences in gameplay obviously but at 60 they both kind of resort to healing.
---
This is probably very personal but which of these classes has the more enjoyable experience at 60? I’ve heard shamans have a way better time to find raiding groups and they also have more versatility to their playstyle in battlegrounds etc.
---
Leveling speed is not really a problem as I’m not in a hurry to get my alt to 60 and I generate a lot of resting exp on the side while I play my main lock.
---
Is it working on mobs you’re killing before installing Killcounter?
---
He didn’t insult anyone, you didn’t even write anything in your post for us to discuss.
---
Reddit is a circle-jerk. People here become mad at blizzard for banning and stripping a HS-player and quit. 1000 others on reddit does, hence everyone on the game must quit because of this. What they don't realise is that a big majority don't sit on reddit nor give a flying fuck about that HS-player and will happily continue to pay sub and play, or cancel because the game is outdated.
---
As a rogue I only use it for pulling mobs, so faster speed is good for me :D
---
I don't have the spreadsheets no, but I can lay out the rough stuff.
---
Frostbolt has a 81.4% coeffient, with a 2.5 cast time, that means for 1 spellpower you gain a flat 0.32 dps multiplied by your crit chance(since crits do double damage with frost spec). Say you have 25% crit that makes it 0.4 dps. So you can attribute each spellpower as a flat 0.4 dps specfiically for a crit chance of 25%. The more crit you have the more value a spellpower is.
---
Now for crit, it adds flat 1% dps increase. This is your dps without using cooldowns just spamming frostbolt. Find out what that dps is, and 1 crit will be worth 1% of that. So for 12 sp to 1crit with a crit chance of 25% that would put your dps at 480 with no cooldowns.
---
I don’t live in America so about 99% of this list is irrelevant to me. And the remaining bit is easy. The difference is, which of these companies actively suppressed political speech?
---
Thanks for the pointers.
---
No
---
No shade but how does this work out monetarily in terms of copyright? Genuinely curious.
---
&gt;we just had the surprise attack
---
Surprise attack in classic, whats the surprise. Spy addon been going crazy for past 30 seconds that you will see opposite faction ?
---
the few hundred people in unsub will be outweighed by the tens of thousands of chinese players they would lose if the Chinses government adds hearthstone to their banned games list.
---
&gt; Being a raid leader in classic sounds awful.
---
Not to bad yet, although people are already buthurt and gquitting when they have to sit out because we have over 40 :). Not our problem you decided to be one of the 3 million mages on the server.
---
Not to derail your accomplishment but when people say solo farm Dire Maul what does that mean exactly? Is there a lot of trash mobs that drop valuable loot?
---
i loved tbc and wotlk was okay, but i'd still prefer a classic+. just in case anyone was wondering.
---
No, it's still lame.  BGs have always been and will always be better than wpvp.
---
Yeah I was just being dickish for the fun of it ;)
---
Damn, I’m going for server first on Arugal and thought maybe I could be world first! Gratz and enjoy the trinket :)
---
Definitely worth it, it's much better than thrash blade and it + mirah's is not that much worse than Dal rends.
---
I always laugh when I think about the rogue that took the world first legendary bow drop as a stat stick. Take that you “need everything” bastards!
---
The eternal struggle of Tsunaman
---
Yeah he absolutely got punished way too hard but anyone saying it was undeserved is kinda silly, a hearthstone tournament isn't exactly the platform for political agendas, especially one as touchy as the hong kong situation.
---
Look at him sitting there with his chimp feet in the middle of a pile of shit like some leftover garden gnome that nobody bothered to take off the lawn before winter came
---
Including this comment
---
I want to caveat this with, I have no idea and have pretty limited experience! 
---
But a few things that might help you decide: 
---
- for me, playing with friends is the best part, I’ve met some pretty cool people, but it’s never the same as being on discord with your irl friends 
---
- certain areas just have more PvP, when I went to STV, I got killed hundreds of times by alliance, then in desolace, it was the alliance getting ganked, it might just be where you are at the moment? 
---
- I havnt seen one Redditor mention my sever either, I think Reddit is actually a really small percentage of the player base
---
- have you tried “lookingforgroup” or “LFG” world chat? It’s not just for dungeons, use it to find people to quest with, people go for easy solo targets and hesitate more when it’s even two people 
---
- join a guild and quest with them 
---
- be aware of where the horde territory is, avoid questing near those areas
---
Yeah I was only being dickish for the fun of it!
---
What do you mean by binging as that makes no sense to me :O
---
I am, 25 is my highest at the moment. 
---
I really should start focusing on one.
---
Cleave hit's NPC totems, not sure about player totems though.
---
Yes. I get these things. I understand the importance of stats, spell power, hit and crit.
---
I just wanted to keep the post short and to the point :)
---
Have you guys considered being open to a poly relationship just to have a dps on board
---
Exactly this, sure 99.9% people probably didn't deviate from their initial pick but it still gives people a moment to think about where they went to queue, would suck if you assumed you were going to X server but 2 hours later you got onto Y instead.
---
Hunter's Mark gets removed. Use flare and serpent sting rank 1 vs rogue, unless when you're planning to trap. Use scorpid sting if you used serpent sting when you want to trap.
---
how do you even farm mara solo? at that low lvl
---
I always bid on those low copper posts, just to make it more annoying for the poster - so that he would have to take them down and repost them if he wants full price. It's an awful trend and needs to stop!
---
Pfft, just Moonfire every time it wear off and...
---
Oh sorry, I was oom and Innervate wasn't fast enough to leave me enough mana for Regrowth!

From what I found, with the swiftness potion, as long as the helper kills the first 3 mobs, I didn’t even take a hit, you just run past them, I took one because I got stuck on a root, but only died when my swiftness ran out - it’s a long tunnel 
---
The priest can’t revive you as he pulls the mobs as well, so unless he’s a friend that doesn’t mind escorting you, he probs won’t do that
---
True. Leveling in retail is so fast that players just get handed all these abilities and have no idea what to do with them, and what's worse for rogues is that if they don't learn fast that they're gear dependent, they'll achieve a huge gap between their levels and their weapon's level.
---
I'm enjoying learning every little trick I can use as a rogue, learning every tool at my disposal. Slow leveling really helps here because I can master the tricks in all that time.
---
Lol I’d just hop in a shop in IF or SW. Try the mind games.
---
I don't wanna tell what makes the most fun at 60 because that is totally up to you but what I can tell you for sure is that druid is the master of versatility. 
---
As a druid you sometimes cast spells in your caster form, often you'll fight in cat form, sometimes you'll need to switch to bear form for survivability and in dungeons or groups you generally heal.
---
And the fun part: **All with the same spec.** 
---
I love it.
---
Fair, as a stst stick it doesn't matter much
---
you have 2 flasks but use the lesser arcane pots , nice meme
---
Me and my girlfriend are level 40 and 41 and we went stv during weekend. We kept getting killed by level 60 hunter. I feel like at least when you were within the curve you would get attacked by same level or similar level people but now its just annoying level 60s hunting low levels ;/
---
Alrighty, thanks for the info!
---
Heirlooms tarnished the legacy of these items. It won’t stop me from collecting the set though, I can’t believe Blizzard was so lazy in implementing them.
---
Eh just do slowly and have fun with your mates along the way
---
So you bought heirlooms
---
Yep and has the same issue with people hoarding.
---
For the record, I don't think politics are really there to be 'enjoyed' like video games and I see why you would want to ignore their presence to further enjoy your experience. 
---
Unfortunately, what I'm saying is any work of fiction is man-made and, intentional or otherwise, as a result of this they harbor attitudes and ideologies that are inherently political. Look at Orwell's 1984, look at Cyberpunk 2077, look at Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Its impossible for politics to not be present in your video games (this is partly why censorship differs continent to continent) and it's impossible for people to not be constantly engaging with these ideologies. However, being aware of this and choosing to actively ignore their presence to enjoy yourself *is* a form of escapism. 
---
The Chinese kid on a stream you probably didn't watch and maybe don't care about didn't put politics in your game. They've been there since the beginning.
---
Split up their mobs, get them to take pushback on blizzards, wand their frost novas before they cast blizzard hoping to break a mob out.
---
You can definitely make the pulls take more time and mana, probably get their cold snap, and if they get into trouble without coldsnap they have to reset or die.
---
Yeah tbh i often do this, i just invite people when on kill quests if there is limited amount of mobs. Dont think there is much explanation needed, why would you not want to group? Do like competing for tags when you can both get them?   
---
Loot quests are a different thing, but for kill quests grouping up is quite a nobrainer.
---
For some reason, your reply reminded me of  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMr4B05eDiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMr4B05eDiM)

Hey well at least you have buddies right :)

Leave your Mason jar of raid piss on the desk?

Why the hell would you need a second account for alts?

I am afraid no

the kids that joined our guild were ALWAYS jokingly known as young, after years of playing together and they are now missing raids because they're at uni/pub - it was always met with 'he cant be at the pub, hes only 12!' and became a running joke

If he attaches some drums to that kodo beast, he is allowed to keep the mount.

Don't hunters have almost the same needs for armor as rogues do? Like agility is the primary stat for both.
---
Looks like Marsh worldhopped to Azeroth.
---
Which ones? Whats the Onyxia faction and whats the reason for getting their rep?
---
There are PUGs or partial guild runs where you likely can join. That likely will be less reliable than having a guid/friend raid group every week.
---
The rotation is so lost on me :(
---
You didn't do anything wrong, really. Give it a few months and they will forget it, I hope you can too.
---
I'm myself a warrior and would always give it to a tank or warrior in general before giving it to a rogue, but your loot rules were clear so I don't see any real reason they should be that mad and livid about it. The fact that you weren't 60 yet does change nothing, really. The others couldn't use the binding themselves right now, just like you.
---
Why not farm the furbolgs in Winterspring? You get firewater and e'ko. Ton more gold than Felwood
---
pug and reserve loot
---
whats it called
---
Peeveepee
---
Because resistances don't actually make a fight any more interesting beyond "wow im wearing different armor" it makes your character feel worse to play because you do less damage, and the only difference it makes is "i take less damage in this fight". You may as well make the fight harder mechanically and let people actually learn to play better to overcome it, rather than an arbitrary number to reach to do the fight.
---
I’m just saying I dont get along with people who lose their shit over this stuff only while it’s popular and everyone who’s not their ally is automatically the enemy 
---
I enjoy playing video games without unnecessary drama
---
One or both of you won't make 60. People don't realize how much of a slog 40-60 is.
---
You can blame quotas all you want, but this GM never addressed healing vs damage, even when the OP patiently laid it out for him.  This is just someone reading from the script, not escalating it to someone who actually knows what is going on.

pugging

Yes. He breached his contract that is a fuck up. Blizzard Only followed their part of the contract

That's what he's saying mate; His figures are calculated based on the data he provided - the threat number he calculated is based on the assumption he did 0 overhealing, and if he did (more than likely) the number would be higher.

Dude it's 2019. Virtue signaling and fake outrage is where it's at!

I did play retail in end-game (PVP) to try, but never really enjoyed it. I mean, you got like 90 levels for free and you ended up dinging 110 not even knowing how to control the class. Horrible...

So what it's a PUG, Yeah but it's still a selfish masturbation-tissue throwaway mentality, fucking selfish mentality, especially since the dude just left on the spot just behind without warning, Dole is a fucking douche. Even if it's a PUG he's with people. If you feel like he's in the right, then fuck you too, PUG doesn't mean they're at your mercy; Why do people think PUG's is the place to be an asshole and do shady shit. Yeah he was allowed to roll, and okay he won it, that's fair, he could have been altruist and let it pass but sure no obligation there, but seeing what happens behind just shows it was just self service and no respect.
---
Fuck this "It's a PUG" mentality, it's not a valid reason.
---
Its cheap when you put it into perspective like that

I wish I had been part of a melee cleave XD My one an only character, a warrior, is currently 54 sitting close to 12 days of /played XD

I'm not defending them. All I'm saying is you're here preaching about standing up to something and yet you don't even do that right. You can't boycott one company that supports China and not all the other companies. It's a fucked up world we live in.
---
that depends on your keyboard settings. For most people, that doesn't work.
---
Whats your addon to show stats like that?
---
There is a respawn timer but also respawn location roll - when you mine a node the next one can spawn within "mini area" of which this node was part of. Some zones has this visible more clearly than others (like clearly visible "mini zones" for rich thorium veins in EPL).
---
I've been having a lot of fun playing a rogue these past several days but I feel like I need to go back to my main after reading how difficult it can be for rogues to find spots in groups and get gear. Is it really that big of a deal or are people over exaggerating the difficulties rogues face later in the game?
---
The Chinese market is much, MUCH smaller than the western market.
---
"don't say things that may offend or upset others".

Any and all political statements are gonna offend or upset someone.

The stream was still an official blizzard stream, just because the tournament is over doesn't mean you can use it as a political speaking box.

that was amazing hahaha

Why are warriors so prone to miss lvl 30 to 40 even with a good weapon and with the weapon mastery at the max allowed by the level?  
---
My friend can't do quest of his level because of this, he dies so often that he prefers to take quest 2 to 3 levels under his.
---
Never heard that shit and ive been in some retarded groups lol.
---
&gt; left on the spot just behind without warning
---
It's the last fight in the dungeon. Does he really need to announce he's leaving?
---
&gt; Farming gold at max level is really not as hard as people seem to belive.
---
it's not hard, it just gets pretty mundane after a while. need to have something going on a second monitor.
---
Lol :&gt; 
---
ALL DD warriors need to use leather / mail in terms of lack of dps plate
---
Something modern storytelling has forgotten
---
SHOW, don't tell
---
How long does it take for rested exp to max out? I'm under the impression you can get a level and a half of it.
---
not so much now but it used to depend on the GM you got, some were golden some where shit, problem is the current GMs are employed based on customer service background and not on understanding of the game so they are just trained on how to deal with tickets and anything that may be a bug they could have experienced is just shrugged off as they dont have enough knowledge of the game to know how it works, it has never been based on individual participation in groups its been based on group tag and being in range of the kill
---
In all my time playing wow, I've never once played a warrior past level 30 so it's really hard to say what might be a difficult transition. I think in terms of PvE you'll have a harder time finding a group as Rogue, especially if you were a tank on your Warrior, there's more gear competition as a Rogue, too. 
---
If you're a PvP guy, it doesn't get much better than that of a Rogue. Pick your fights, insane damage/control, plenty of utility. I suspect that if you're itching for some PvP then you're going to enjoy it but you're likely better off asking someone that has played both extensively
---
Quick failed gank story for you: Running to tauren mill on my level 20 rogue, following my level 19 priest friend. I get charged by a 37+ dwarf warrior (full scarlet set). My friend just sits there and heals me while I chip away at his hp. Warrior realizes his mistake and tries to run. Killed him with a throwing knife
---
I left Herod with the server transfers and I hated to do it because I enjoy being on a high population server. I just was not having any fun being constantly outnumbered no matter what zone I went to quest in. I enjoy world pvp, but I didn't enjoy being killed by multiple Horde with little to no Alliance in sight.
---

---
I usually decline invites on my alt too. More xp for me on the long run. Also, of its a looting quest theres no way im joining a group just to never get my items.
---
They dont get the gear.
---
BWL is still a long time out. If your guild is clearing MC now, you should have more than enough gear to take on BWL once it releases
---
Speed and damage aren't that great at that level I feel. Completely ignoring any bonus, the hypno blade still has higher DPS and can be farmed really easily. And that's a caster weapon, there have to be some much better weapons at that level available.
---
One guy not looking to share any drops from MC

Would it be different with 5 individual druids moonfiring you? No . Your report is a waste of time

And this is why people hate on wow noobies like me. Cuz some idiots claim to know shit about the game when they in reality are noobs to classic.

---
Damn, my main is not even lvl 10. I dont know what to play :(
---
A dumb joke then that he should be ridiculed and called out for just as much.
---
I would recommend Pitbull then, its highly configurable, give it a look :)
---
Single-target is MS prio, 2+ is WW prio.      Charge in, bloodrage if you don't get enough rage on first swing, pop SS, stance dance, zerker(+bloodrage), whirlwind, cleave, MS.
---
Yup a level and a half, takes 10 days inside an inn or capital city.
---
Yes, Kazzak was leashed because he was virtually unkillable and would make a zone completely unplayable due to his super long range high damage AoE as long as a GM didn't intervene (and in that case it's indeed griefing). He's a very special case though. Most elites aren't any dangerous.
---
shit got that knock off klumpke saint laurent mooncloth bag.
---
I've read enough GM responses to know that this is basically an automated response. Might be a person behind the screen typing it, but it's all a script they use.
---
&gt; I don\`t think anyone is reading my in-game bug reports, via in-game submit bug function, since no one of my bug reports is fixed until now 
---
you think Blizzard has an personal employee stationed just to fix your bugs ?  
---
There is a huge process for fixing bugs.
---
Which starts with reproducing the issue, and ends with the update.  
---
In between that there is a huge chain, that needs to be followed.  
---
Als the game is out for 1 month now...... if your bug is nog game breaking, it probably hasnt prio 1.
---
So yeah - it takes some time
---
There is a streamer that always plays with 40 characters at a time
---
Wait, what CC do i have as a shaman?
---
*sigh*
---
You can add new unit frames with it, seperate bars and much more
---
Right. 
---
Im a Backstab combat rogue, and i really like this build. 
---
I feel like Its best for me to go with a slow weapon as a still feel that makes a big difference in actual backstab damage.
---
Yes, give them a reason to report you and then wonder why you get a timeout. Sound logic.
---
Well on a mob 3 levels above him he has a 9% miss chance, a 5? % dodge chance, some parry chance that all adds up to a lot, and then there's a 40% chance of glancing blows which are hits that do almost no damage. Melee dps are just affected a lot by level like this. Rogue has it a bit easier due to 5% hit and 5 weapon skill in talents, however duelwielding adds a huge miss chance on autos.
---
i know. dinged only on Sunday evening. but what should I await if in all these runs nothing even dropped?
---
Of survival
---
At your level you can do RFC (Ragefire Chasm) but you should work out how to get yourself to Ogrimmar first then watch the chat for groups forming. The dungeon entrance is actually in the city so it's easy to get to. You can take the Zeppelin from outside the front of Undercity to get there. Let your group members know you are new to the game and you'll get lots of advice. You can heal or DPS (damage) as a priest.
---
That's not true I hear emotes from nearby players all the time.
---
I'd love to see his setup. Any links?
---
First time I’m hearing about it. 
---
They’re a top tier dps class with a cc utility. If anything I would have thought groups would find rogues refreshing considering how many mages there are that compete with the locks and priests for drops. I personally love having them in my groups.
---
I love Vanilla more than any other gaming experience in my life but TBC was peak WoW. As long as they dont rush patches and expansions i m ok with TBC being brought to classic, personally.
---
Honestly most of the collect x of stuff drop for the whole party (especially the ones that only need 1 item), and the ones that don’t are often still faster in a party of 2-3.
---
Lol your prob right, idk why I don’t ignore people. Feel like if I do, maybe I’ll miss somethin in the future, like a hilarious conversation in org or somethin I might miss cause I got people ignored
---
Yeesh 😬
---
Really depends on your class and spec though. As a healer, killing stuff isn't really a viable option, so it'll be running a lot of dungeons for shards and some cloth and greys again, which is ok income, but nowhere near that level.
---
CHINA BAD GIB UPDOOT PLZ
---
&gt;but TBC was best WoW ever
---
It was not. It started a lot of the design trends that led to the deterioration into the sad state of current WoW.
---
* Daily quests, which aside from being horribly boring repetitive trash content, are also the earliest form of timegating. Yes, grinding mobs for hours is actually still preferable to this. At least you can do that for as long as you want, whenever you have time and feel like it, instead of basically being forced to log in every day to not miss out on reputation.
---
* "Streamlined" quest layouts, where all quests tend to be conveniently found in one place. Basically eliminates a huge chunk of what made vanilla engaging - the fact that it made you plan where you wanted to quest at any particular level, rather than just railroading you through a set path of zones.
---
* Short, linear dungeons. Turns the whole dungeon thing into more of a fast-paced repetitive loot treadmill, instead of dungeon runs feeling like an adventure.
---
* Stupid wonky trivial gimmick quests, usually involving flying on a railed mount to bomb huge numbers of super-weak mobs
---
This is probably not a complete list either, just the things I could think of off the top of my head.
---
Maybe the raids were good. I couldn't really say, as I didn't raid back in TBC, but all content outside of raids and general world design was certainly a huge step down in quality from vanilla.
---
What level is recommended for Dire Maul East? It looks like the last boss in the wing is only 58.
---
So should be possible to do with a group of 56er? Also, how big is the wing, how long does it take compared to other dungeons?
---
So, do you have a follow up on that? Did you try to argue a third time, so they admit clearly that healing doesn't do shit and it's intended as is?
---
Report me for what?
---
Sadly yes. Gotta wait until BW before they’re truly useful, just exciting! :)
---
Thank you! :)
---
Reminds me of that one scene in Spongebob haha
---
When he dies in Undercity he's not lootable ("You don't have permission to loot this corpse"). Killed him a couple times around Tarren Mill too, where he was lootable, and he looted 20 ish silver and nothing else special (like x2 runecloth).
---
Which is ridiculous. It's fucking cheating and the fact this is allowed is beyond me.
---
I just had a look at a google search for it there, it looks pretty comprehensive! Are you still able to use the vanilla unit frames? Or will they always change?
---
Or maybe just whispering to the wrong person and not noticing? Probably happens to me once a session.
---
how do +spell damage/healing items work in crit calculations etc?
---
Eg is it (base damage+spell damage) x crit mod or (base damage) x crit mod+spell damage.
---
Similarly with chain heal/lightning is the bonus heal/damage added before the damage reduction from jumps or after on each proc?
---
No but it makes things way easier. There are pugs though, and some of them are even like a consistent weekly pug. Also it will be a lot harder to do new content, it usually take some time before newer raids starts having pugs.
---
Me too
---
Language
---
Did it just fine with holy/disc. My main source of exp was dungeons but I did a fair amount of quests and have never struggled.
---
Could you guys list the chats used around the servers?   
---
I just found out about /lookingforgroup yesterday and it really helped.  
---
I know /world /lfg /lookingforgroup ,
---
Love how everyone started to care when it had something to do with videogames, before then? Not a single fuck was given. This is nothing more than flavor of the month outrage.
---
Because its a very rare item thats a huge boost for any melee and a very small one for ranges.
---
Eventho its a pug you can still be social and pass for very small upgrade?
---
Basically everyone I know or played with passes for tiny upgrades if someone gets a huge upgrade.
---
Ikr. You can see the quest text on my screen which I realize now woulda maybe been a better screenshot but at least it’s not from my phone ;)
---
Sigh.. Cant you keep this shit out of a single subreddit?!
---
I've never played wow before this and didn't know you could check which side the server was on, or that they would even split. So now I'm on a West coast, and I need to be on a east coast.
---
Suicide kings was my favorite
---
I was thinking the same thing yesterday
---
How hard is LBRS? I read it can/could be done with a 5 man group. Or below 60. Maybe for skilled players only? 
---
groups searching on my server usually go for 10 ppl at lvl60. Would you say that's overkill? Or maybe good since people are fresh 60 and have crap gear?
---
 Tell me... tell me everything!
---
Wish i had your problem lol! Hope u get the other binding asap :D dont worry about this man. U won the roll.
---
Telling someone they are being an asshole won’t get you timed out, pretty sure language falls under slurs an hate speech. Would be pretty silly otherwise
---
Goblins got Richard Hammond to test a new rocket car
---
Oh yea, thanks, all my problems disappeared once you said I shouldn’t have them. Ganking is no more.
---
no, being able to buy things is good
---
I'd pug some in the meantime. I've only had positive experiences with pugging so far/guilda pugging half a roster. Even joined the last guild i raided with and found myself a nice home. Of course not all pugs will be like that but it doesn't hurt to try. Especially onyxia since its so short and if the people suck you can leave without getting saved.
---
Horde have to run around the world and kill elite dragon bosses as party of Ony attune.

Eh if you leveling with a mage you can get tons of mobs and aoe while you keep them all in place.also good for dungeons

The time he spent for those whispers could have gotten him more than 1g

Well damm, that is really unlucky :(
---
Just to clarify. 
---
Windfury is not running on PPM. It's a straight up 20% chance everytime you attack.
---
If you're using a 1.7 speed 1h. It'll have the same 20% chance of proc than a 3.8 2h.
---
Just need to pray you hit the jackpot at the right time.
---
Never done with more than 5 people
---
I’m playing on laptop with touchpad rn, nothing can save my ass at this moment :D
---
That's fair. I guess I didn't even think about PvP (or marginally so) when I rolled my warrior. I'm a PvE guy through and through, though I enjoy the occasional WSG or AV. I tend to find lower level PvP more interesting (39 and 49) because you have access to some of your big talents, but less spells and toys (like trinkets or engineering gadgets) are in play. Maybe I'm just not cut out for top-level PvP.
---
This is why I had so much fun just *exploring* back in vanilla. You'd see so much stuff like this just in the middle of nowhere with no explanation. It's because of things like this that make vanilla more alive and organic to me than the zones in the newer expansions. Things feel random and spontaneous in vanilla, whereas in newer expansions you can just feel how scripted everything has become.
---
I'm a level 30 horde lock and was wondering about how to find out which gear I need as I level. I'm new to WoW so I don't know all the names of different items etc. Should I be buying items from the AH via a guide or something or just get better gear from quests? 
---
I know that I have extra gold to spend due to getting a free mount but also that spells cost a lot down the line, so maybe I shouldn't spend too much. 
---
Thanks!

We just have a discord and an ingame channel to chat in. This way occasional wpvp and instances can be done but everyone can go at their own pace.
---
Human rights isnt politics.
---
I've seen people mention it but how does it actually work?
---
Besides, what do you do if there's only one druid and he gets all druid pieces automatically, does he get penalized on rolls where he has to compete with someone?
---
Heh been the opposite for me. I’ve never been so hyped for anything before, so I poked a lot of friends new and old. Didn’t have any real expectation other than playing with at least a few, finding a guild and having fun. As it turns out, a lot of them showed - and brought friends of their own. So many eventually it made sense to make a guild of us, and so we have. They even voted to loosely name it after my character, which has been so special. Looking to start raids in late October now, got about 30 people that should be raid ready by then, recruiting the rest runningly. Honestly as much fun as I had in vanilla, raiding and clearing as far as AQ40, Classic is turning out to be even more fun. We had a ton of tourists to be sure, but a ton of them stayed as well. I suspect it was the guild element that did it for a lot of them (a few wrote as much in the introductions part of our discord)
---
You should change the font outline in your bags and bars btw. That's what's making the stacks number weird. Default one is fucked up with Expressway.
---
Umm... No? Classic gas always been like this.

Wait, they complain about 1g and then tell you to tip 1-5g. Are they okay?

How important is hamstring kiting as a warrior? I find it kinda annoying to do for every mob fight, but I am hoping that at higher levels it becomes irrelevant?

---
BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT IS UNFAIR!
---
Eh fuck it stats are always mice..and even DM is coming soon
---
I wish I could give you a better source than my knowledge. I promise the ideas are accurate, I just don't have a good source at-hand that can break this down, and tired as I am, I can't think of how to find a good one.
---
Basically, how it works is this. When you attack a target, the game rolls on a table to see what the result of the hit is. If you're behind the boss, your attack can miss, can be dodged, can crit, can be a regular hit, or can be a glancing blow. All of these results are kept on a single table, and let's suppose it looks like this:
---
Roll | Result  
---
:-- | :--
---
1-8* | Miss  
---
9-16 | Dodge  
---
17-57 | Glancing Blow  
---
58-63 | Critical Strike  
---
64-100 | Normal Hit
---
*Technically, you have an 8% chance to miss a target at +15 defense over your weapon skill, but the first 1% bonus chance to hit you gain from gear is ignored in such a scenario, meaning you need 9% hit, but the table still only checks for 8%. 
---
This table will dynamically update itself for every hit, expanding, collapsing, and/or shifting the brackets as needed. So for instance, if you were to gain 1% additional critical strike chance, then the row for Critical Strike would return a crit on a roll of 58-64 instead of 58-63, and the game would return a normal hit for a roll of 65-100 instead. In essence, we've reduced our chance to get a normal hit by 1% in order to increase the chance to get a critical hit by 1%. With me so far?
---
The biggest thing to realize about this table is that the categories always go in this order. Things that could prevent you from hitting, then things that reduce your damage, then your actual attacks. If we were to swap from a 2h, as the above table is assuming, to dual wielding, the new table would change dramatically, and would look something like this:
---
:-- | :--  
---
1-27* | Miss  
---
28-35 | Dodge  
---
36-75 | Glancing Blow  
---
76-80 | Critical Strike  
---
81-100 | Normal Hit
---
*I'm not entirely sure that this is the correct base miss chance when Dual Wielding. I'm mostly going off of memory here.
---
As you can see, because of the huge increase in the base miss chance your auto-attacks have when dual wielding, the table doesn't have a whole lot of space to expand your critical strike range into. We can add 50% additional chance to crit if we like, but our crit roll on this table can never be wider than 76-100. This is what people are talking about when they mention the crit cap: The point at which additional critical strike chance has no effect on the outcome of your attacks. 
---
Because special attacks will exclusively use the first table, the crit cap for them is absurdly high and probably will never be reached in normal circumstances. But because your auto attacks will exclusively use the second, there will hit a point where +1% hit not only increases your chance for your auto-attacks to hit by 1%, it will also increase the chance for them to critically strike by 1%, since reducing the miss bracket at the top-end allows the critical strike bracket to expand at the bottom end.
---
yeah, 1600g is not that difficult. i'm nearly back up to 900g after buying my epic 3 weeks ago. spent a lot of time doing EPL runs for thorium and herbs. not uncommon to pull in 70g worth after about 2 hours of gathering. but to be fair I don't expect to keep at this pace, since a lot more people are starting to finally hit 60 and the zone is becoming crowded.
---
It's gonna be good in P2 though.
---
Used that on my rogue until I got sword of serenity/vanquisher sword
---
Because that area is contested and you will get ganked by lvl60s
---
its pretty good to try and proc while you wait for cd on multishot and explosive trap/feign death combo-
---
Their loss I suppose.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing the ganking go away. But PvP players seem to really love that.
---
Guy filled after someone bailed, got the drop and left. I don't see it as a big deal because I don't know what else buddy has on his agenda for the day and neither do you.

no, do 2/31/18 if you want to play dps tank.

What show/film is this from?
---
Maybe his space bar was broken.
---
I just hoping for the best. after 2 year from now you will be already did everything in classic. so what next thats what i am asking
---
It consumes a lot of gold to push enchanting...  give tips.. (I am not an enchanter)
---
I guess that's a fair call.  
---
But those are fringe cases, even someone wielding two handers will have trouble with the two scenarios (albeit less trouble).  
---
The damage mitigation is too much to give up, dungeons go way faster for me in defensive stance + shield, as we are waiting for drinks less often, and have less chance of wiping.  
---
And almost the whole time, threat is good.  
---
There's definitely a place for two handed tanking, or duel wielding, but my point is that sword and shield should be able to keep threat if you're doing the right things.
---
Your tank shouldn't be lower than 58. The last boss hits very hard and a sub-60 tank will get shredded without strong heals. Without enough dps you won't last long enough to burn the boss down before that.
---
This post is hilarious :D
---
All I want to do is pvp. I really appreciate the information and at this point I have to give it a shot. Thank you!!
---
I'm honestly disappointed with the amount of rogues at 60, everyone is rolling a warrior this time around, and all of them refuse to tank. I love having rogues in my group most of the time. Good dps, single target so unless they're idiots they don't end up pulling the wrong targets, and if they do they have an aggro reset.
---
what exactly are the new patterns?
---
the healer cloak and?
---
Hi all,
---
I'm really loving levelling my warrior using Arms, especially with Swifty's crazy sweeping strikes aoe macro.
---
At the moment i've tanked every dungeon up to the early 50s and have always been top dps (using a 2 handed weapon).
---
I'm almost at the point where I need to think about respeccing and am wondering if it's viable to do a hybrid Arms/Proc spec where I can still use Swifty's macro (sweeping strikes neeeded) while also keeping all of the important Tanking talents for end game dungeons (not worried about raiding at the moment)
---
My main concern is my single target thread generation without having Shield Slam.
---
What do you think?
---
global boycott of chinese goods when.
---
3 separate times in felwood when I was farming felcloth this hunter wanted to group and I had to decline him and had to justify why I would not group.
---
Someone needs to make a warlock one
---
Well thats just no true.  Had party members not get completion on 2 of the Chicken escorts, while i had issues with Tooga in Tanaris - mate got completion, I didn't.
---
As soon as you got targeted you knew you were dead. 30 moonfires hitting you at the same time. RIP dood
---
Yeah and most wlocks don't realise that spamming Shadowbolt is incredibly wasteful, a lot better to just DoT everything and wand and save Shadowbolt for bosses.
---
When you get Hellfire, DoT everything while the tank gets aggro then use Hellfire. Save dying to trash mobs for me and the other mages.
---
Anythng is viable for dungeon tanking, even if you put 0 points to prot.
---
For efficient dungeon tanking I'd go deeper into fury, maybe even up to 31 points.
---
You can tank dungeons in any spec but why did you choose this? What does this offer over a impale-prot spec?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hit#Hit_results
---
Cannot relate at all. I don't argue with kids so I've yet to encounter someone ignoring me. I do however have one person on ignore but that's just a chat spammer
---
Pretty much you can. The thing is you gain about 10% damage reduction just from using a shield. Sometimes it's more and sometimes it's less; but overall 10 is a good number.
---
Then you gain another 10 percent from being in defensive stance. 
---
Also when you block you cant be crushed or crit. So not having a shield means you miss out on spamming shield block ad a defensive. 
---
Does this matter? Depends. For tougher fights it matters a lot. Which is why almost all of the best guilds have 1 to 2 dedicated deep prot tanks for raids later on in the game. At this stage at least. 
---
Now for a vast majority of the content. It doesnt really matter and you can even benefit from having basically an extra dps in a 5 man. 
---
There is a lot more details I could go into but in the end the general consensus is this. If you over level or overgear the content then use a two hand or dual wield fury. If you're at level and at the same gear level then go prot. 
---
If you're a level 60 in dungeon blues then two hand tank BRD. Will be better. But if you go into a raid in full dungeon blues and 2h tank then you'll just be wasting healer mana. But once you're fully raid geared you should be able to tank no problem. Etc.

TBC.
---
Also go here to discuss this stuff /r/classicwowplus
---
Who cares? Getting people involved is never a bad thing. Quit the pessimistic gatekeeping... it's posts like this that are the direct cause of exactly what you are complaining about.
---
"appeared AFK"? Back in the day, at any point in a raid, about 5 people WERE afk. :D
---
I love sword and board when I'm tanking in dungeons. I love it so much I made spec'd into a hybrid prot/arms build at 40 so I could get 5 points of defiance to make my life easier. But for the love of god don't bother with sword and board out in the open world. You don't need it, you're just going to take three times as long to kill something and end up taking more damage because it was attacking you for three times as long as well. Do yourself a favor and keep a two hander in your bag for PvP and questing.
---
The only part that might give you problems is the ogre summoning event after the spiders. It requires people to play very mana-efficiently and dps to CC &amp; focus the correct targets. Most pugs won't be able to do it, even at 60.
---
maybe only group 1 of a raid group can loot it? 
---
that sounds odd too. Thought it would be either "none can" or "everyone can" when it comes to raid groups for quests
---
Warrior too
---
More fake outrage. There are so many things more devastating than this going on even today and no one gives a fuck about it, and even those who keep posting about HK in these reddits dont really give a fuck, they didnt give a fuck this entire time but now suddenly a guy who purposefully violated his contract being shitcanned makes you care? Please spare me your fake outrage of the month. We know in a month you people will go back to not giving a single fuck.
---
And, you generally kill things MUCH faster.
---
All you have to do is look at the economy and all the companies that, out of greed for money and to gain access to the Chinese market, sacrifice all the values that many people once have fought for. It's sad to see where this is leading to.
---
ty!
---
Literally look at what comes out with dire maul, and look at the mats required to craft those things.
---
in classic very specific gear was best in slot and it was very time consuming to get without extreme outlier luck.  this kind of thing is why titanforging was invented and why loot drops got more generous over time.  This is what people are/were nostalgic for.  It'll feel great when you actually do get the item (or you just move on to the next tier of loot without ever getting it).  Most people never actually got all their BiS items at any point back in vanilla.
---
genius
---
Alliance ony pre bugged  for me at the brd escort had to do it 4 times nd it take about am hour to do it. got the same retarded answets from bilzzard support explaining to me how escorts work. Fucking morons by far the worst coustomer service i have encountered in any mmo
---
RIP shoulda waited till the weekend and got more.
---
My original guild in 2005-06 had 3 or 4 TF eventually.  None were from our own raids. I think we got 3 bindings, 3 times the same one , in 2 years.  So all the swords were from recruits. Getting 2 halves in 6 weeks is incredible
---
The arthas tears potion does that doesn’t it?
---
How you can go to the same spot? As a mage may I can go down haha
---
Inky, Blinky, and Clyde!
---
For dungeoning arms is far far better.
---
I average around 400+ dps as arms and 350 on bosses, whilst fury I average 300+ dps and can hit 500-700 on bosses.
---
The boss killing speed is far superior as fury dual wield but sweeping strikes makes everything else so much faster.
---
For raiding though arms is functional but it's a bit of an rng fiesta. Good windfury procs make and break your damage.
---
Yeah probably
---
It's much easier if you do all the quests for the faction while leveling (if you do them later than the appropiate level for the quest, you sadly get almost no rep anymore). I switched over to Kalimdor for Barrens, so a little late, but at lvl 51 now I'm almost half way to exalted already just by questing.
---
Mages just frostbolt 90% of the time
---
Might I ask... why?
---
What I always hated with WOW and loved with guild wars 2 is how they treat expansions. Why keep raising the level cap? Just focus on new content. So maybe release tbc, wrath etc but do away with the level grind each expansion and make it new servers so when tbc comes, every classic character has a one way transfer to the tbc server and those that want to stay in classic can stays.
---
Omg this is perfect!
---
You play on a low pop server I see :D
---
Why not grind satyrs in felwood/azshara as well.
---
Because spots like those are 100% camped on any good server.
---
No that's a disease
---
How do MS&gt;OS groups handle the DPS warrior they begged to show up and tank? He's also only allowed to roll on tank gear?
---
I did this cavern yesterday, and asked myself "Why the f*** do they loot barrels"!
---
yeah you’re right, doesn’t do damage either
---
As a mage, it is generally more time efficient to kill the enemy with spells, then sit and drink rather than wanding it down. If you have level apropriate wands at very low levels they are great, but once you get your first 10-15 talent points in a tree of your choice you just don't wand anymore.
---
Any blue dungeondrops that come with random stats shouldnt even be included in any prebis-lists, the people making these lists and seriously list such items are non-kidding borderline retarded.
---
It may be acceptable if atleast there can be multiple viable suffixes on that item. F.e. Slaghide gauntlets from urok doomhowl in lbrs (feral tank bis) are fine with either "of the": monkey, bear, stamina, defense, or even tiger. But if you need to look for 1 specific suffix out of \~20-30, just scratch it off your list and forget about it, you have about the same chance getting the baron mount.
---
It's not hard to find a party and kill him again. Grow up, pussyboy.
---
Yeah that one just increases the ammount of damage they take by 8
---
I’m gonna go out in a limb and say you will be 60 by the time you get the other one and can craft this so why would anyone care?  
---
If you couldn’t roll on loot why would you have attended?  
---
Jealous people, not worth the time worrying about them
---
Isn't that one of the 2 spots the spider quest boss thing spawns? Always figured the ground was like that because the boss was stepping around so much there.

Thank you for the NSFW tag, spared me an embarrassing talk with my boss of why I hadn't send it to his fap-folder already ! Puh ...
---
I mean how often do you prep for raids.
---
And for yourself, that means you don't have any need to buy AD biscuittos for farming. Spending a minute drinking level 45 water while farming is not fun and a waste of time really
---
Where did this insult come from? I just started hearing it last night. And in game, at that.
---
Too early to comment on it. I think.
---
You're so close to the point, yet missing the script.
---
I don't want to sound like an elitist but a majority of players are complete downies and the game would quickly turn to shit like this.
---
Yeah, I feel like the full prot is a significant mention here. I was also levelling full prot for easy dungeoning, and the heals always love me haha. Try pulling aggro from that, bitch!
---
Two words:
---
Reckoning bomb
---
"He's immune to my moonfire spam!"
---
Not if you dont play Retail and engage with it.
---
About as uncomfortable as I am using 90% of goods manufactured from China. Blizzard is not China, it’s a game developer in California.
---
Yeah there was just a huge discussion in my guild and someone left because they wouldn't take him along as 57mage.
---
So I was. Wondering if the drama is really necessary
---
it was 12-01 am so I guess it could have been more packed. was a couple people there farming the earth elementals but they respawn quite quick. Noone seemed to care about the air elementals though.
---
Server pop is "Full" most of the time, but only see queues on sundays or other random days now.
---
Does that apply to everything? We had a binding drop in the first MC run of classic, and only like the left bindings in all of vanilla.
---
Oh my god are you seriously playing alliance
---
Paladin shadow protection aura doesn’t stack with the priest buff. Is this a bug or working as intended?
---
Looks like a normal day on Faerlina.
---
That's good. Now if only I had any desire to play retail...
---
You sure drinking is drinking Regen and not normal mp5? Like to remember in vanilla eating and drinking stopped working in combat.
---
I tried it in ubrs and I lost briarwood Reed 😐
---
you get less overall exp for a quest if you are teaming.
---
pretty much my reason why i would hardly do it.
---
Farmed that shit for 3 people... didnt see my second wind trinket drop at all during those 3 HOJ drops :/
---
Nope. Because they're not pandering to a genocidal autocracy. They're pandering to their companies' and peoples money, just like every Capitalist corporation will. If you're shocked or dismayed at the thought that a corporation could willingly do something that opposes freedom you haven't been paying attention to literally every multinational corporation.
---
What do you do, when you can't find math? You do it yourself!
---
So assuming you have a talent that increases crit-damage to 200% of a normal cast, then you know 1% crit equals 1% more damage.
---
So let's say your frostbolt does 458 damage non-crit. The spell-damage-coefficient for it is 86%.
---
So for 1% more damage, you need 5.3 Spelldamage or 1% crit.
---
However, as your spelldamage increases, crit becomes more valuable.
---
Let's say you already have 300 Spelldamage.
---
That means your frostbolt now does 458 + 300 * 0.86 = 716 damage non-crit.
---
In this case 1% crit is worth 716 * 0.01 / 0.86 = 8.3 spellpower.
---
In order to make a generalized formula:
---
(Base-spelldamage + current-spellpower * (base-casttime/3.5)) * 0.01 / (base-casttime/3.5) is the spellpower-value of one crit.
---
This can probably be simplified but I don't remember how to it.
---
Ahhahaha this is so true(strikeshoulders)
---
My guild was hesitant to transfer but we ended up doing it right before they closed transfers to Heartseeker. IMO it was the right decision. On Skeram I was getting ganked so much that I pretty much stopped playing because I felt like the game was just wasting my time. Trying to quest was frustrating, and it was getting harder and harder to find groups to dungeon with outside of peak times (and even then it could be slow).
---
I'm actually getting shit done on Heartseeker. It's definitely ally dominated which is a bummer for my friends that are more PvP-oriented, but they agree that QoL is a lot better as far as finding groups and the economy is concerned. 
---
My friend kept his lvl 60 on Skeram to fight the good fight but he only actually gets to do anything is when it's planned with other people ahead of time.
---
Nah, I don't think so. He's made a calculation based on meter numbers and is basically saying "assuming none of this was overheal, here's how much threat you produced". The only way this could be interpreted any other way is to assume that either the threat was overestimated because part of it was overhealing (it's not - zero of the figure was overhealing since it's not included in the metric).
---
Overhealing produces no threat anyway.
---
Dung spam
---
A dude im my guild got chat restrictions or smth cause he called out some dude in the general, GMs can do whatever the fuck they want
---
So he’s going to pass up on the best in slot trinket for a couple of randoms because they are people?
---
Sit down boy, he won fair and square and OP is just salty because he lost the roll.
---
Yeah it doesn't work, but there's a funny interaction with the Ravager axe from Herod... if the axe procs, you attack everything around you every 3 seconds. Windfury CAN proc off these attacks (you can see it if you use a combat text addon like MSBT), but your character won't "use" these attacks immediately. But after the Ravager's whirlwind ends, you instantly "use up" all your procced windfury attacks, resulting in sometimes more than 5 attacks immediately. In dungeons if there are big pulls, you might get several WF procs during a whirlwind, resulting in completely destroying your current target the instant your whirlwind ends.
---
This interaction made me think WF can proc off WF at first, before I tested it more extensively and understood what was happening. At first all I saw was 4+ white numbers in one attack.
---
Doesn't it come with a staff that's a really nice stat stick?
---
Seems to be the latest copy paste, I've seen it on 3 different subs from 3 different people now.
---
Engineering would likely be more useful for you in the long run
---
&gt;He did that and asked GM to restore his "accidentally" deleted character. And they did! So, he ended up having both Horde and Alliance characters on the same realm.
---
That's actually amazing 😂 somehow I don't think a monumental cock up like that will happen again though. Also I wonder if his character creation was permanently cocked up due to flags for both alliance and horde characters showing up on his PvP realm
---
That is why you use addon for AH.
---
This will never stop so enjoy it :D
---
Why? If they both rolled and he kept winning, then there's no issue
---
How though? If I may ask
---
incorrect. guards will always attack.
---
Thanks for the replies guys, at this stage i'm just throwing together ideas. @sealcub are you talking about the impale spec on wowhead classic?
---
Cheers
---
Almost certain you could with CoE, and 100% certain if you use CoE ***and*** have minor speed increase on your boots. He has something like a 10% speed increase, I could actually kite him without cheetah using only my enchanted boots and throwing a snare (concussive shot) once in a while. You'll be good.
---
What I'm not certain about is wether some rank 1 dots will keep him from despawning. You have to damage him relatively often to prevent him from running away. Not sure if it's direct damage or DoTs, as I haven't checked myself. Else, just take some low level high speed wand and use it on him every 8-10 seconds or so during the kite :)

Battle stance charge

Defensive stance while charging

Bloodrage

Sunder and revenge on the main kill target
---
Rotate sunders and revenges on any extras

By this point dps should probably be pulling aggro on the main target. Taunt it while they finish and mark a new kill target.

I've played more than you in /played and you have twice as many 60s as me. Nice work.

they aren't literally next to the guards. they are shooting you from outside the range of the guards, even if you stand next to the guard

there are spots inside and outside gadgetzan they can do this and get away with it

People seem to be way more introverted now, cutting themselves off asap from any little thing that bothers them
---
My mage is full BiS and Pre-Raid Bis besides the trinket, I'm currently using Carrot on a Stick because I refuse to get anything else other than this damn trinket.
---
It dropped last night and a healer won it, they then wrote in chat "It will do until DM comes out on Weds :)"
---
Bitch there is no fucking caster trinkets in DM and there are 2 decent healer trinkets and you take this.
---
Of course I just said "Grats" and continued the dungeon, though.
---
Global boycott of all goods made by exploited workers 🤔

Anyone thats political i ignore. I don't participate in those conversations outside wow don't plan on interacting with those types online. If your name is even political i most likely won't invite you because in my eyes your trouble
---
I hate this show with a passion I cannot describe, I watched all the first season in the vain hopes that it would live up to its premise, that it would do something, anything right but I was wrong, oh I was so wrong.
---
As a former twin emps lock tank... I can't wait
---
blame the rules tbh, i'd imagine that a guild that actually cares would have prioritized warriors
---
Weapon almost as good as the reaper is coming out with dire mail next week, I think it's called barbarous blade.  Hold off for that
---
Why not, you can set up multiboxing software to achieve different formations. In this case you'd just make a conga line then turn everyone 90 degrees.
---
That seems like so much work.  He’d have to create different groups for each 5 characters to still get quest credit and XP.  And fighting over the same spawns/quests between the different groups then.  Idk...
---
😥
---
Level 43 high enough to heal Zul'Farrak as a Paladin?
---
I don't know. My ignore list is almost empty. I have an addon where I can attach notes to players and that attaches a link to that note to every mention of that player in every chat channel etc., so I can mark good and bad experiences that way. To land on my ignore list, you'll have to really earn it.
---
I don't think it's a good rogue weapon, I would left it to warrior.
---
Yea, with both hands
---
Yessir, outside of like one or two bosses I dual wield the whole time.
---
Priests got a talent that makes mana regen happen while in combat thats why spirit are bis for you and druid.
---
Shamans and palas doesnt have them so they have to stack mp5
---
Near the cloth quartermaster in Darnassus.
---
Why? It is way more efficient to farm honour in bgs, whereby wpvp has no justification. Right now it is merely a tool for harrassing others on pvpservers. Nothing will change with honour.
---
So far i have yet to see those big battles in hillsbrad as nobody cares about them anymore. Theyre also not efficient at all, as you do not gain honour from people recently killed. Back to bgs if you intend on doing anything serious with ranks.
---
Mt status bb
---
Are people seriously getting reports for not saying yes to a request?
---
This is what I do and I fucking love it. Constantly pushing what I can handle and trying to outplay tough situations.
---
Do prot or Arms, but don’t cripple yourself. I am able to Tank every dungeon with 31/20 arms.
---
Can't aoe winterspring mobs so easily. :(
---
Jed Runewatcher is a rare boss spawn in UBRS that drops Briarwood Reed, the pre-raid BIS damaget trinket for casters (and healers, really). Most people go in and out of UBRS with a /target Jed macro to find him in one, prior to entering the dungeon to farm him.
---
Raids don't use different loot rules. The only difference is that you cannot progress non-raid quests. Not only would that mean _nobody_ could loot the skull, not just OP, but also Axtroz **is** a raid quest.
---
Lmao yes, these pussies wouldnt last a minute on private servers, it is honestly sad to see.
---
I really like that idea, what’s the addon called?
---
Trinket from ragnaros

---
Oh, cool thanks.
---
The fact that there was no balanced druid made me laugh
---
TBC I think?
---
There are a few amendments to that.
---
As fury dual wield you have higher flurry uptime as you hit faster and this crit more often.
---
The +1 rage on hit is actually worth taking as dual wield as it builds up but because its a flat 1 rage on a flat % proc rate its pretty garbage for 2h. Big dual wield synergy!
---
Two weapons generally give more AP than one. Not always but often, and blood thirst scales off flat AP not weapon damage and therefore hits harder.
---
Dual wield specialisation is actually hugely significant as it essentially makes every point of AP 1.75* effective for dual wield over 1* with a 2h or 1.5* without.
---
But all that being said for Horde 2 handed fury especially at molten core level and lower gear is super viable. Even arms is. In any situation you can burst cleave arms is stronger than both, if you need sustained cleave and single mix 2 handed fury out performs dual wield (on horde).
---
For alliance dual wield fury gets stronger though due to a lack of WF and the presence of Salve letting you 'uncap' your damage much more easily and dump more heroic strikes.
---
Keep your highest DMG weapon in your mainhand is what he's saying!
---
My friends all quit already, but I hardly play casually.
---
In Soviet Azeroth, you recoil gun.
---
“Power is dangerous. It corrupts the best and attracts the worst."

There are 2 sets of lifts into TB
---
Well, they could've just extended Vanilla. Alot of people were very unhappy about TBC being released so quickly. So many guild died during Naxx progression because people didn't see the point when everything was getting wiped in a few months anyway.
---
Congrats! I love this weapon, i still have it on my live account from my very first character :D
---
Preach brother.
---
Imagine expecting to get support for something you pay for, so childish amirite?
---
Ehh. After a while, you can go all plate for DPS war, though. Once you've cleared BWL, at least.  
---
For holypal? That's not til after you're BIS from Naxx, that you can go all plate. &gt;.&gt;
---
It's not a connection to wow classic and this show it"s the connection of reddit to this show.I guarantee you at some point in the front page there will be someone saying something about JoJos, it's just widely referenced everywhere since the common trope is that anything can be a JoJo's reference.It happens a lot on Reddit so if you really haven't seen someone say anything about a show called JoJo's you're pretty out of touch with modern memes.But that's not like I'm saying it's a bad thing.Because of course it's not that would be silly.
---
Was questing on an alt and I see two guys killing the mobs I need for a kill quest. So I walk over and ask for an invite and they say their just here for the chest which is surrounded by the said mobs. They refused to invite me and proceeded to tag and kill the mobs I needed. So I went over and opened the chest they were going for. They started bitching in barrens chat. Not saying what I did was right and I didn't give a damn about the chest, but declining invites can have consequences sometimes
---
Not really. This decision was made by someone in upper management and doesn't represent the views of every single person in the company. Rest assured that a lot of people at Blizzard are upset about this as well.
---
Communication is the key here.
---
Am rogue. Can relate. This was brilliant
---
Check the DM class trinkets you get through the books
---
Lol never bother with what pugs say.
---
Is it a dot tho??
---
Yeah. For so many expansions, they were partnering.
---
Yeah, it was so interesting. I couldn't get through season 3... it lost all appeal.
---
Seems too op imo, you could equip that item or potion etc as soon as you see a rogue stealth up near you and mess up his ability to use vanish effectively. Could work though, like if it was a chest item with very low armor and no stats so you sacrifice a lot to have that free auto DoT.
---
German doesnt use lots of them either, and the ones we do use regularly have dedicated keys. Were also just as close to France as the Brits so that isn't really an excuse either.
---
As far as I'm aware totems, auras and other spell buffs don't stack, you just get the highest one.
---
Absolute hogwash. OP even said (and the GMs also confirmed) that OP actually did damage to the boss.
---
I'd say sure, provided the tank isn't too low lvl himself
---
Imagine an ant with a sword trying to swing at you. You think you COULDN'T dodge  some of them?
---
Cool, thanks for the input.
---
Why so much time in there? Is there gear I don't know about? :)
---
I dont really have a problem with rude or toxic players. It can be quite fun just shooting some shit with them.
---
I use my ignore for bad players and people who cant communicate in english but still choose to play on english servers. Somehow being bad at english also translates to being bad at wow. Atleast on EU realms.
---
That's such a cool detail!
---
Night elf here, sounds like ez 1000 bucks.
---
Is it Bloodsail Buccaneers? Theres some frisky horde, my undead warrior got some action multiple times.
---
3 mages and a warlock. those eye pulls and hellfire are amazing
---
Sweeping strikes for one, the damage from Swifty's macro is waaay more than impale on 2-4 targets.
---
Please do the needful and perform damage sir.
---
1% hit and 20 AP are huge differences without even calculating the rarity of the item. I have seen plenty of warriors passing on it dor hunters. Especially since its not BiS for warrior, at all (apart from prot).
---
The difference between having it and another trinket for you is less than 5 dps. The difference for warriors is at least 10x as much.
---
If you want sweeping strikes, just go all in as a 2h-arms tank (obviously with a 1h/shield macro bound). 
---
Right now, that spec just has no identity. Rage is limited in dungeons, yet you've opted for so many talents that augment rage-spenders and it's just not functional.
---
Is this for real?
---
HEY! I only wore it once!! ^^and ^^I ^^looked ^^sexy.
---
so it was overpowered before release. Ended up being nerfed into oblivion, making warrior the most tedious class to level
---
Shamans, more speed = more chance for windfury?
---
Zug Zug
---
Me and my wife are on Grob - A. 
---
I changed my main from a priest to hunter and she is maininng a warrior. Lets quest!
---
That is the perfect place to ding 60. Congrats!
---
I enjoyed it on my second watch through. You just have to accept that most anime is trash and you must enjoy the trash
---
Yeah I would understand suspension or a fine, but to withdraw winnings he'd already won was excessive. I respect that Blizz don't want their shit to become a political tool but also kinda feels like it already is if this is the level you're silenced to.
---
Not at all meaningless. Especially when fighting over economy. Our guild currently have complete control of the devilsaurs in ungoro.
---
If you really want to make a warlock i think you should and in regards to the problem that you dont want to go though the same quest again maybe try another race so you get a new starting zone and other starting quest
---
Well some genuinely had such terrible connection they fired off like one Frostbolt every minute or two. ;P
---
Ahh ok I wasn't aware there was nodes in there, I only knew about the lashers dropping tons of herbs
---
Every class has their benefits and disadvantages.  
---
And yes the druid is maybe not on top in HPS but for example Nature's Swiftness with a big Healing Touch or BRez can save whole raids. The heal in the right moment is much more worth like some stupid numbers.  
---
The only really weak thing as druid is the missing res. But if you make some shadow priest or pala friends you can fill this gap. But if you have a good group there is no problem.
---
Thanks mate. I like the place too.
---
im pretty sure im gonna see Baron drop his mount before i see the cape drop :(
---
we ran UBRS last night and the ONLY item that dropped that anyone needed was painweavers, literally everything else was trashed
---
Only a complete douchebag would roll on it versus melee. Next time your in a group with him roll need on a ranged weapon since you need it more as a stat stick apparently.
---
Have you tried RealMobHealth?

How does resetting an instance to force a rare spawn work?
---
I was entering (while in a group of 5 waiting outside) and trying to target the rare spawn. Then went out, pressed 'reset all instances' and went back in. I think on my 5th try our priest entered the dungeon. So when I left and tried to reset it said it is impossible because people are inside.
---
Then when I tried to enter it said 'You have entered too many instances recently'. How is that possible? Shouldn't I be able to re-enter and join the dungeon with the priest in it?
---
Warlock is one of the strongest levelers and can easily hit top DPS in a group. Warlock is way more fun and versatile than playing a mage imo.
---
Yes, you should absolutely make a warlock right away.
---
You get half the XP from kills for the quest, but it takes a third of the time. And that's if you do just the bare minimum instead of going full cowabunga with the power of teamwork and annihilating everything in the area. I find two people can destroy ~20 mobs in the time it takes a solo player to kill 8.
---
Teaming up is almost always a net gain.
---
Pretty sure that's just the regular "make a copy" button and not an attached letter
---

can i enter the deep run tram tho?
---
I'll be honest. Given how hellish it was going for Ferocious Bite 5 in ubrs, I won't set my heart on bis from rare instance spawns. I'm willing to take a performance hit to avoid investing that time in something so heavily stacked against me.
---
For me personally, i felt like 1-52 ish was as far as you really needed. The rest of the way I just leveled while getting my BiS pieces.
---
Well, in that case I'd just hide somewhere on the eastcoast Eastern Kingdom with water breathing potion + stealth as a rogue waiting it out.  No  chance they'll find  me
---
Thank you for your answer. Yeah i was thinking about that but i wanted to make a gnome one surely 'cuz of their bonuses. I will stay with the alliance surely just don't know what other character should i choose then...
---
Its 10% from being Honored
---
Also 10% from being Rank3 but that comes in the next phase.
---
This addon does a completely different thing.
---
Instant Health simply updates units health faster(data from combatlog) instead of waiting for server.

You are new to WoW. Multiboxers have been around for a long time and will continue to be long after you’re gone.
---
Hardcore players can have their day...so long as it doesn't shorten the days for the rest of us [who are still trudging along to 60 and gearing; so far that's about 80% of Alliance on Pagle; ~20% are lvl 60; scanned as of last weekend 10/5/2019].
---
TBC is next. I know this because Vanilla was a smashing hit. Blizzard will take the 'safe [and easy]' way and simply release the next two expansions, which are frequently hailed as the "best versions WoW".
---
More like an attempt at being re tarded. Well, not just an attempt
---
The quest to kill toxic horrors in felwood.. there was like 8 people running around fighting for tags I spent 20 mins there and couldn't get a single kill, I think it was the 2nd time I just abandoned a quest and left
---
And the game is designed to discourage playing solo around other players. You might not want to party, but the game punishes you for not doing so.
---
Spy doesn't trigger if you don't appear in combat log.
---
that's they all say
---
At what point does Feral dps not depend on the crowd pummeler?
---
I can recall myself doing +25 in Legion without discord it was doable because of common strategy knowledge. Maybe something changed right cause of the new affixes I am not sure.
---
In Wrath BoP items in dungeons were temporarily  BoE for the party so even if someone won the item they could give it to another party member.
---
Kings for everyone, I keep it simple.
---
Thanks for watching :)

Yeah I’ve met a few friends from us bonding over giving each other shit. Yeah I’m the same with non English speakers, it’s rough.  I can’t stand players that straight refuse to communicate, just won’t respond back or Idk just put a lil bit of effort into communicating, but then again might go back to English thing.

If you both benefit from eachother, sure.
---
But a lot of times I simply don't accept invites because I know they will slow me down.
---
what spec please?
---
The fuck is he preaching? That doing nothing for 0 days is better than doing something for 2 days? The logic literally makes zero sense.
---
They do help, but there's a few guidelines. Loot rules need to be clearly established, by the raid lead, in a public ingame chat channel (public as in /raid, not /w) beforehand.
---
So for example, if your raid lead establishes beforehand "We all roll on every BoE, regardless of spec" and then pockets every BoE that drops, a GM can and will remove the item (or the gold if he already sold it) from his character. They won't give the item to anyone else, so the item's still lost to the rest of the raid, but it acts as a deterrent to other ninjas.

Your point being? This is a well known fact that doesn't need a reddit post. Move along.
---
aaaaaaaaand its gone.....
---
If we assume that your goal is to survive and their goal is to kill you then it's a draw, right?
---
Honestly I'd say let them make their attempt. If enough people want it to warrant the investment then it should be made.  
---
That way when it fails, because it will, they'll have noone to blame.
---
Be serious.  China would not have banned Blizzard games that they have invested hundreds of millions in just because one kid said something about Hong Kong.  
---
Blizzard acted cowardly for no reason.
---
call him out if his/her pets is getting killed, the pet is not supposed to die that often
---
Shanker is terrible for pvp btw, because the bleed proc breaks blinds and gouges.
---
But generally speaking, yes keep the slow main hand, but dont ignore everything else, f.e. a Heartseeker is still better than the shanker, even tho its base dmg is \~2-3 lower than the shanker, but the 1% crit more than offsets that, and your white hit damage is slightly higher too.

U can solo farm the lashers in DM east.

I'd say hunter or feral druid are more engaging imo.
---
frost has always been best for leveling in vanilla post release, as I remember it, at least on a PvP server because no-one baring rogues and some feral druids would dare attack you if you were frost.
---
Original frost mage was a killing machine
---
I used like 75 water on my healer dudu during my last MC raid.... Gotta drink eeeeveeery chance you get.
---
Took me and 2 others in their own group 20min to finish a kill quest that would have taken 5min if they accepted my invite.  Makes for real shitty experience for no reason.
---
Ya as a leveling warlock void rly can't hold aggro
---
Its a evil circle of each class tresspassing on eachothers loot turf. 
---
Im not breaking the circle.

It is. Just watch the /new for a bit.

There are enough places to discuss this topic, this subreddit is about a game, not chinese politics...

Also, it's not allowed, beacuse of Rule 5 
---
&gt; No real world politics or religion.
---
&gt;The damage mitigation is too much to give up
---
You're telling me the mobs hit SO hard in RFC and DM that you simply must have a shield or the healer is OOM every pull? This is just simply not true. I've tanked without a shield until 30 without issues whatsoever, and asked the healer plenty of times if I should equip a shield to be polite, it was never needed. The only reason I even equipped a shield eventually because I got one that looked cool. Your experience isn't everyone's, both playstyles are viable.
---
I don’t get how someone just flat out quits Classic WoW, unless they just have absolutely no interest in ever playing again. I’m one of the slowest levelers, and have taken a few full week breaks from classic, and still I’ve never thought of just unsubscribing. At the very least, making it to 60 seems like a goal with pursuing, even if it’s super slow going.

Main problem is that you forego dark pact. The other problem is that the blueberry sucks.
---
I'd get the below addon. It changes enemy name plates based on how much threat you have. If you intend on stance dancing (which you should) theres a setting you can change so that it is always the same colour whether you are in DPS or tank stance - I have it set to always be green if they are on me, yellow if i'm losing threat and red if someone else has threat.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/threat-plates-classic
---
Allright I'll check. Thanks!
---
The only threat generating ability he listed was thunder clap tho, and that is a battle stance spell.
---
... Are we gonna ignore that flipped mouth LOL
---
Yeah, about to waste time memorizing alt codes for all possible accents that I will never use anywhere else.
---
Because they didnt. People are offended by anything these days. I have yet to put someone on ignore in 15 days /played and i certainly played with people who behaved badly.  I dont need to cut communications with someone because they maybe were in a bad mood and im sure i played with some of them after that and they were nice. Companies only help this mentality further and blizzard is a prime example. When you report someone in heroes of the storm for instance it automatically blocks them, meaning i had to unblock every person i ever reported. Thanks blizzard but i'd like to make my own decisions. Just because i reported someone doesnt mean i want to block them forever, that i will never give them a second chace. Besides is a team game, i dont wanna block someone who might say something later one that helps us win the game and i dont see it. Winning the game is more important to me than not having to look at some mean written words.

A lot of evil is done by good people who have been misled by people they see as authority figures telling them lies.     
---
At first the believe is genuine, in the end the believe only exists because admitting to themselves that they were misled would be admitting to themselves that all the evil they did was pointless.     
---
Classic tragedy.
---
Debatable, but probably not. Still gotta go through an instance portal, even though it’s a public instance.
---
More tedious.
---
Why do people get so salty about these videos? Who said they are trying to impress anyone? It’s just a fun little slice of a good brawl! I personally miss this stuff and it makes me jelly I’m not 60 yet!
---
Then they have plenty of time to grind for it.

how are the servers that were low pop but had layering removed?
---
Play boomkin? No need for hoj then. Seriously though, I feel you. I can’t get the arena cloth belt for the life of me...losing it to a 52 the other night really hurt.
---
In raids you should have like maybe 2 prot warriors and one feral druid for tanking and then a bunch of dps warriors who will situationally tank. Most warriors can't just go prot even if they wanted to if they want to raid.

Blizzard just kept politics out of their tournament. It just happened to be pro-HK politics. If someone else would have won and spread some pro-Palestine stuff, nobody would care much if they banned him.
---
when you enter a dungeon you get an instance id.
---
the   'You have entered too many instances recently' only counts for every id triggered on your character.
---
ubrs fishing for "jed" the rule is to do it max. 2-3 times since you dont want to be locked out.
---
the cd for instance id's is 1hour with a cap of 5.
---
when you start a new id at 14:01, 14:02, 14:03, 14:04, 14:05, now you are locked out until 15:01(2,3,4,5)
---
No. If you want new, original content then there's Retail from it. Classic is not for new content. With new content Classic turns into Retail 0.5. The only acceptable way for introducing new content into Classic+ is to retrofit some existing retail stuff. Dreanei and BElfs for Classic? Level 60 Kharazan? Level 60 Uldum? Why not... both nothing new that would diverge from the boundaries set by Retail.
---
Why can't I name my characters in Cyrillic or Chinese, then?
---
Just a theory but it might be because there's less of an EverQuest influence than there was back in 2004. In EQ the tank would almost never pull to the group, it was usually done by a Monk or Bard or another class that could Feign Death or drop their aggro in some way in case the pull turned out bad.
---
That was mainly because EQ was a more difficult game, and 1 extra add could turn an easy pull into a wipe. WoW was also a lot more challenging to players in 2004 than it is in 2019 so I could understand wanting to have that possibility for a reset.
---
You’re correct, but you’re time gated on Morroweed due to the item cast cooldown.  It can only be used every 5 minutes(or maybe ten, I forget).  Plus you have to have the Un’Goro soil which isn’t a big deal unless you skipped the zone.  
---
I would say use both, especially if you’re going to sit in TB and buy up stacks anyways.  You’ll have time to spare and kill two birds with one stone.

except good farming spots are sooooo over-populated now that you're often better off farming somewhere crappy with noone than farming the best place but with 2 or 3 players for every single possible mob respawn spot
---
If this is the code I got, I had to go install an update in the launcher.
---
Black bear is best
---
Well...MC was cleared with sub-60s in 'crap gear', something like 5 weeks after launch. More guilds followed.
---
Ion specifically says they're releasing Dire Maul (aka Content) sooner than expect because many are asking for more to do (I suspect those are players who rushed to 60 and now have BiS for Phase 1).
---
WoW Classic has been a huge success; Blizzard will want to continue that, especially since the Quarterly Reports for Activision-Blizzard have been trending down when compared to the 'same time last year' reports.
---
I look at it from a businessman's perspective. If I have a product that is selling really well. I have 'variations' of that product that I want to release at timed points. But...I notice that the selling of the main product is slowing faster than expected. I will most certainly release those variations sooner than I had planned. Because I want money.
---
That's where this "prophecy" is coming from: The mindset of a bunch of greedy corporate suits that don't give a fuck about you, me, the community, or the "Devs' Vision". They want profits....no matter the cost (because reputation is easily bought).
---
Lol, what a joke
---
It's silly. The other materials don't really cost much in the current markets - my lock will get his epic mount for around 600g this time (if even, have to recalculate, though)
---
&gt;Never had these experiences in vanilla etc as i played on RP realms at the time
---
Can't say for sure that it *never* happened to me during vanilla, but it was certainly a lot less common than it is now in Classic. However, that could also be because there are a lot more people playing now in Classic than there was in actual vanilla.
---
Maybe it was different at vanilla launch, but I couldn't say, as I only started playing sometime mid-2005, around the time 1.5 came out IIRC.
---
I know it’s total shit for pvp. But it serves me nice in pve.
---
And for sure, I will take a nice add on a dagger for a few dmg. Just wanted to know if I wasted time thinking about something not even in the game.
---
Yeah where you fly out of.
---
Best to watch that on mute.
---
It's always been there. WQGF put back something that fell off over the game's lifetime.
---
Now I was sitting there waiting for a named spawn before anyone else then a group of five came along wanting to do the same quest I asked to join alas they were full, I tagged said mob first and got the kill. I was then berated in whispers and general chat for the rest of my session that day because I 'stole' their kill.  SMDH.

Pallypower doesnt buff pets. And pets cannot be buffed by "class", they have to be individually be buffed.

Yeah I’m the same, I don’t wanna ignore people an never communicate with them again, never know when I’ll meet them again down the road an  have a wonderful exp  with em an who knows maybe it was me that was ina bad mood, that’s why they left me with a bad taste in my mouth. But yeah I’m of the mindset if I have problems with someone, try and settle it, have words an get over it an move on, or that’s what I try to do, maybe down the road they will try an communicate some important info involving you in world pvp or somethin an you miss it, or he’s lookin to fill 1 spot ima dungeon an you don’t see it
---
EA is better in that regard, is it ?

I started a levelling group with some friends now. We are 5 and do EVERYTHING together. No gathering quests for us. :D

Its fun and relaxed playing though. I assume we will do lots of instances.

Nope and this post finna get locked by the mods see ya goofy hypocrit boy

finding new friends was a realization i was forced to ponder for the entire waiting room,

I’m on the other end, but on the same boat. Just a while ago, halfay from killing Caliph Scorpidsting, an invite just pops up. It’s not like the invite covers more than half of my screen. So I just accept. Caliph dies. Dude gives me a buff, a heal, and promptly thanks me for the accept, and leaves. All was well.
---
&gt; Yeah he was allowed to roll, and okay he won it, that's fair, he could have been altruist and let it pass but sure no obligation there
---
Did you even read ?
---
&gt;be able to loot friendly people when they die
---
That does not sound like something any DPS should be asking for.
---
"*Whoops*, there goes the mage with Staff of Dominance again. Let me just res you real qui- oh, sorry, misclick, I just looted your corpse. Again. Silly me."
---
Dire Maul; Phase 2.
---
Dire Maul; releasing before Phase 2.
---
It's fine, though, I'll just sit here and wait for the mid to late December announcement of Phase 3 "because all of you have been asking for more to do in Classic, so we're working hard to get Phase 3 ready for release later this month".
---
((One poster in either this thread or another said I shouldn't expect Phase 3 until March. We'll see which of us is right. - Part of me wants them to be right, but the cynical bastard part of me wants me to be right.))

Yes you receive both. In vanilla before patch 1.6( or something) you receive the bow/staff as 1 item like anathema/benediction

I can't really say it's as big a weakness,  it depends on the situation, but iirc, the tram and the mage tower can both be occupied by horde with no guard presence and no possibility to fight back because of the portal.  Really let's a raid make themselves comfortable, summon, regroup, or just massacre whenever wanders through.

Yeah after looking on the classic database i didn't find anything that could apply a dot when hit.
---
It's not even okay. It's extremely bad.
---
We did get a transfer, thus the Exodus. It's like 90/10 now
---
My Classic experience yesterday:
---
Get to that quest in STV where you have to kill goblins for those 10 gems. A hunter is there and we group up. A mage is there and joins our group. We kill the camp of goblins and there is a chest. I roll for it and the mage immediately runs towards it, clicks on it and leaves group.
---
Kinda weird, to leave group for the usual garbage that is inside those chests, but his choice...
---
Then 10 seconds later he asks us in /s if we are also doing that quest. So obviously we made it our mission to tag all quest mobs he wanted to attack
---
Only 20 sec??
---
Fair
---
because we already are in voice chats with our real friends at that point.
---
I was in a similar situation where I roll-won a best in slot thingy but given I was just 59 the raidleader decided I should not get the item and instead the 2nd roll got it.
---
I was pissed and certainly made a comment about it which now got resolved.
---
Let me say this one simple thing: If you're taking part in the raid you deserve to be credited for in the same means just like anyone else being there. You're helping, you deserve rewards. No more, no less than any other player partaking the event. 
---
So in short, you shouldn't feel bad about it. Be happy and hope for the second piece to the puzzle.
---
Play the race that you would enjoy, but yeah orc has better racial if you really care.
---
1. Doesn't matter which zone you are in, skill points are based off numbers caught.
---
2. Server time. It's believed to be divided into 6 hour chunks, midnight-6am, 6am-noon, noon-6pm, 6pm-midnight. Some fish are also seasonal.
---
3. Weather has no impact.
---
A big part of it is the culture shift away from the novelty of online socialization. After 15 years of internet exposure, all our Monkeyspheres are full.

[The epic kodo mount has drums attached to it](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/5/50/Great_White_Kodo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091107103945)
---
I have two accounts made it my hobby
---
This gave me a terrible idea to have people surround the thing with campfires runescape style
---
Warrior is pretty rewarding with a group. Saw few solo warriors in EPL and I can feel you pain.
---
Honestly it's made me a more patient gamer. I'll defer the spawn to whoever got their first, and if they let me get it first or help me with it I stick around to help them with theirs. I have encountered people leveling who don't want to group, or even get mad when I ask them (one feral druid in Shimmering Flats asked if I was trying to leech xp), but just as many people were happy to group and didn't care about the xp loss.
---
Demo shout only applies threat when the buff is applied not renewed let it wear off then reapply. 
---
On multiple mobs tab sunder armor if revenge or shield slam is available use that instead. Once everything is secure on you and you have enoff rage drop a few cleaves into the rotation.
---
On single boss pulls or maybe 2 mob pulls sunder to 5 stacks then revenge on proc and sheild slam. If you get over 50 rage heroic strike. Never let sunder fall off so if you dont have an addon that shows you a timer make sure you do a random sunder every few hits or so to reset timer.
---
LUDAAA
---
I there a list of quests that give rep with ogrimmar ? Other then the cloth rep quests. After I get my normal Kodo mount I want to try and go for the wolf as an epic mount. honored right now so still a long way to go.
---
You can on horde side in classic, reach over 104% dodge while using Evasion. Only problem is the fact that rogues generate low threat and the build requires you to use defence Gear, which in turn lowers your threat even more.
---
Unrelated but any advice on how to get BT, been trying for 3 days now...
---
I agree it’s probably not worth the hassle : rich thorium veins seems to be farmed on my server, arcane crystals and bars costs 50 g at the auction house and blacksmiths would better spec armor as it’s more useful.
---
What makes it a dumb joke, your inability to pick up on it?
---
OEB also wasn't added until BWL or something I think?
---
Squid probably. Always a good seller.
---
every build with some point in prot is viable.
---
Hell i run DW Fury with 0 point in prot, and still able to tank dungeons when i equip a shield :)
---
In a raid group you would be kicked if you use your healer Moonfire, though.
---
Those 16 debuff slots are there for the useful party members only. /s
---
Run dungeon a lot. If you are prot and a good tank. You can ask for thinks like the first crusader orb. Juat dont be greedy.
---
And you can use alchemy and make greater fire prot pots(if you have the recipe) they sell  really nice and fast
---
Thank you, I was tweaking my build and came up with something almost identical. (I had the extra defence instead of 1H weapon damage and sunder reduced cost.)
---
"KILL THE ONE IN THE DRESS!"
---
Yo I’m a 60 rogue and it’s fine to kill lowbies
---
It should increase both weapons individually. If it doesn't, it's a bug. I'm talking in conditional because I haven't tested it myself, but it is meant to work.
---
Whats peoples opinion on needing on DPS gear while Tanking in a group.
---
I'm leveling a human warrior and enjoying tanking dungeons. I'm looking forward to Tanking some of the 10 man raids. However, I'll never been be able to commit enough time to become a 40 man MT or OT and PUGing as a tank is meant to be hard.
---
Is it acceptable to Tank 10 man's and need on DPS BiS for when I respect to DPS in the hops of joining a Pug?
---
Reserved Abc as a joke and was planning to use my normal main name (Qllix) but suddenly my mage was around 20 and just went with it.
---
Anyone know what addon he uses for the debuff counter?
---
Cheers, I think i'll try something more like what Grisu1 posted, getting rid of imp hs and tc and going down the impale route.
---
Thanks again
---
If your flair is correct then I can understand why you feel that way. Gearing a Rogue at 60 can be tedious and the competition is real.
---
At least as a fury Warrior while we share the same gear I have the luxury of forming my own group if I tank.
---
This was obviously a joke by this guy.. How in the world can someone not get this? Holy shit
---
Definitely if you are holy spec. I started healing it at 42. If you're off spec I'm not sure, might be pretty difficult.
---
It depends more on the gear, rather than the spec. 
---
Although personally I would stay away from horde feral minmaxing since you are missing out on horde'a most powerful perk - WF totem. Unlike ally feral counterparts getting full benefits from paladin's blessings.
---
Yeah squids and nightfin snapper always solid.
---
Lolwut
---
Cult meeting.
---
If you make the following macro:
---
&gt;/cast !eagle eye
---
You can recast eagle eye while channeling it, so you can easily travel between BT spawn locations without being in danger. (must be in the Badlands zone to see npcs)
---
It's made for 5-men, usually around lvl 56-58. UBRS is designed for 10-men.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
The blessing of playing on EU. Not saying that it literally never happens but in 15 days played on mograin EU the only thing i saw so far that could be considered political were some brexit jokes
---
I don't understand why people won't group for kill quests. It goes exponentially faster for everyone and the xp you get from completing the quest quickly is much greater than the xp you would get solo farming the mobs. Drop quests is one thing but simple kills should be done with groups.
---
Auctionator is also really good, and more lightweight than TSM.
---
2.0 was the TBC pre-patch, it added a lot of stuff Classic doesn't have including cobra reflexes.
---
Yeah GFPP seems to be the farm, elementals in arathi drop elemental fire and charms for the WW quest
---
Money well spent! Ggz
---
No it wouldn't interfere with [stealth] pounce because that part is in the "else"-statement of the [nocombat, nostealth]-condition. So it only gets there when the person is in combat.
---
The faster things are mined they faster they seem to repop up sort of like mobs at least a minimum amount.  If you run a circuit around a map that isn’t big enough you won’t see respawns every time.  If you expand your circuit sufficiently enough you should get nodes quite consistently.  If you are mining mine the nodes you don’t want in an area as well.  If you are having problems with respawns on a mount running a circuit then other people are mining.
---
this makes no sense m8, don't spread misinformation.
---
but the questing though, rough! If you can get a 5stack that wants to level in dungeons though, sweet baby jesus.
---
The BiS hunter head and leg enchant is Libram of voracity which only requires a black diamond not a PBD.
---
We had no warriors in guild either when it dropped and our rogue takes it. Same deal, lots of drama, people leave, run over.
---
Refusing to support companies that pander to the CCP *is* something. Supporting Blitzchung's right to free speech *is* something. 
---
Just because you don't want to give up WoW doesn't mean I'm disingenuous.
---
I got to 47 before i hit burn out.
---
Didn't help that i'm now on my own, rerolled Horde and slowly leveling a shammy, not putting in 12 hours days.
---
it's elementals. there is no ' for plural versions of any words.
---
let me write this with the ', so you realize how "elemental's" looks to me:
---
&gt; it's elemental's. there is no ' for plural version's of any word's.
---
Druids just TP there.
---
Totem will not pulse immediately.
---
I could not even remove my weapons last night during MC, another rogue has this issue as well. Dragging the item into my bags did nothing.
---
It is technically BIS for a while, but you'd have to be very careful on threat.
---
100% this is complete garbage.  Healing causes quite a lot of threat.
---
About that, it's actually pretty easy as a 5-men group providing you respect priority targets, because you can activate the head of Omokk to blast an ogre for about 90% of its hp, multiple times during the fight. Most groups don't know this and do it the "hard" way, but it's unnecessary.
---
Nice little story! Your English is pretty good too for it not being your first language:)
---
Why anyone would choose to play with the default party frame instead of the raid frame is beyond me
---
Jewelcrafting
---
30g. Arcane crystals are more expensive atm. No idea how or why that is.
---
After hours and hours in the game now the real game starts. Love it and thanks mate
---
I just did DM last night with a 17 warr tank, 19 lock, 17 priest, 19 mage (me), an 18 hunter with a bear and honestly, the bear was doing a better job of tanking than the warrior. If the healer had healed the bear half as much as the warrior we would have been fine. Well, if the hunter would have chilled a bit and waited for the tank to get aggro properly we would have been a lot better but still.
---
Trolls have a bow buff.
---
Your answer is not related to my question, where we can post bug reports except ingame system. I dont care what is blizzard structure and i dont need any clarification on that point. I am pretty sure i know how one organisational structure like blizzard bug reporting team is working. Also I dont know how you realise that i am expecting all bugs to be fixed in the first mount of release.
---
What i want to say with your quote is that there is no feedback from blizzard ingame reporting system, so i would like to share more in official forums and i am looking for this topic. They are plenty of people posting bugs even here on reddit.
---
&gt; My friend can't do quest of his level because of this
---
While that's super exaggerated
---
&gt; he prefers to take quest 2 to 3 levels under his.
---
that's what you're supposed to do as a warrior anyways.
---
You mean the branch for lvl 10 rogue quest?

---
&gt; With randomized numbers, even if you follow a tree it really feels like your items set apart your character. It gives this weird feeling of ownership that I was never able to feel in WoW.
---
Do you play retail? Do you remember without looking what items you are wearing and where you got them from? Random numbers basically make it so the gear is meaningless, you just wear the highest ilvl one most of the time, nothing is iconic. So the "feeling of ownership" sounds really weird.
---
The feeling of not being able to forumalte a unique endgame build comes from the fact that there is always the meta setup. No matter what game there's always something that's best and Classic has been theorycrafted to the death. I don't know of any game where you could just formulate your own build and have it be competing for the best performance in theorycrafting.
---
**Do you have a GREEN colored mat (or with GREEN dots, lines, circles, squares ..etc) and a RED point optical mouse ?** Then your issues are caused by color cancel-out, get any NOT-green mat mousing surface
---
**Do you have a 'invisible dot' - high resolution gaming muse, and you use it over a ROUGH surface ? (rough as in handkerchief cloth rough)?** Then your issues are caused by the mouse tracking individual cloth fibers, get a high quality SMOOTH mousing surface, like a Razer-Speed  mousepad.
---
None of the above ? try  **/console rawMouseEnable 1**
---
It's completely normal and completely fine. In fact I get surprised when tanks pass on dps gear, because there's so few "real tanks" and so many dps warriors that tank to get dungeons going. 
---
Though if you wanna be a nice guy, tell your group that you need dps items because you are main dps.
---
Corpse camping for several hours is just as pathetic.
---
This.  I think a lot of people are unaware of what the mechanics are for this quest so as you say, well meaning people end up ruining it.  My experience back in Vanilla was very similar.  I had no issues with all of them except Un'Goro when I had two attempts unwittingly sabotaged.  The next time I asked some kind guildies to stand outside nearby and warn people off helping.
---
You’re not obliged at all, but expect your progress to be slower and more frustrating. Pugs can often go wrong because of lack of coordination, ninjas not being held accountable etc. 
---
Guild raids will often take a couple of randoms when there’s vacancies, but don’t be surprised if they reserve loot for their own.
---
You could always find a casual raiding guild, there’s no real obligation to be ‘social’.
---
Hmm wonder how much the loss would be compared to ally if you get the agi totem instead.
---
A bunch of male draenei sat in Dalaran as I powered through Legion to get caught up on retail. They all had Ruin (or some spelling variation) in both their name and guild, but where all from different guilds and even some from different servers.
---
They sat in dalaran for a week at least. (Or just  for as long as I was there)
---
Look closely at the photo. Everything is submerged in fire but not a single burn mark or crumbling. They’re just in perfect condition surrounded by flames. He doesn’t acknowledge anyone saying it’s fake and won’t follow up with a pic of when he put the fire out. The things people will do for karma are so damn corny.
---
I’ll give you the named mob because the hit to xp or loot for one kill is extremely trivial. 
---
I disagree on kill quests.  Often times people are simply grinding xp so grouping up doesn’t benefit them, and I’m 100% ok with that. 
---
People have a right to decline and that doesn’t make them an asshole just because you think they should accept.
---
I had that moment tonight while leveling, why am i doing this to myself again, i know what a time drain Vanilla WOW is, do i care about end game enough to justify this.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROWND!
---
*groans*
---
Did this years ago and the bug remains.
---
I guess this is mostly semantics and we can always disxuss tge exact meaning behind a word's definition. For me, the difference between altruism and egoism is "Doing something that benefits someone other than me at the cost to myself" vs "doing something that benefits me at the cost of someone other". And then we can also discuss stuff like "is doing something at a cost to self for benefit of a group, that includes myself more of an altruistic or egoistic behavior?". It's just armchair philosophy, as far as I'm concerned, but there's nothing wrong with that.
---
The cloth turnin npcs really shouldn't be in the game until a later phase :/
---
then go 31/4/16 if you want it that bad or just take anticipation... not like it matters in dungeons anyway can just 2h tank everything anyway
---
Fish squid and stonescales in the bay of storms you'll also get a lot of big mouth clams with a chance of golden pearls. Around the bay of storms pools for essence of water will also spawn. If you're on after midnight fish nightfin in the lake in feralas.
---
Perfect!
---
Patchwork, by design doesn't do crushing-blows with hatefull-strike. That's the whole reason why druids are the preferred hatefull-strike-tank.
---
Lashlayer also doesn't do crushing-blows.
---
What...? There's a single elemental in the clip, and this elemental in particular hates campfires. We're watching elemental's hate to campfires.
---
He took his bis trinket,  what's  clueless about that?
---
So many warlocks? Not on our realm there ain't.
---
Nope still the same for me......  I maxed my ignore list out in Vanilla.... All it took was one "Did someone say Thunderfury" comment, or a shite Chuck Norris joke.  Still holds true today....  The ignore list feels much larger this time around  XD
---
No? You can be AFK in China (while still in range for corpse) and still get loot. Or is this some sort of special case?
---
I really really don't want to be that guy that reserves things.  I know logically it makes sense and will help me, but it just **feels** wrong.    
---
That makes sense about the pots.  I forgot about that option.  I've just been selling stacks of herbs lately and transmuting arcanite every 48 hrs for 5g.
---
Yea but the human percentage of the earth
---
That will apply to some people sure, but i think a lot will also be people that are actually enjoying it too much and finding it too addictive. It was fine to throw 4 hours a day or whatever at a game at the age of 14 with few other responsibilities but a lot of people getting back into now are that much older with a lot more on their plate and more people to consider in the real world. I've not gone anywhere near 'no-life' playtime yet its definitely having an impact on what i do with my free time and making it harder to crack on with responsibilities when i would rather be playing. 
---
I bloody love the game and am having just as much fun as i thought i would but its something you really have to be in control of otherwise it can lead people to just up and walk away cold turkey like any other addiction. A lot of games are addictive to play but the ongoing, persistent world of WoW makes it hard to not want to play regularly and the open environments with dozens of small (5 minute) quest objectives make it hard to finally call it a night sometimes. It doesnt have the definitive 'at the end of this match' or 'once ive completed this level' which can apply to other games.
---
In an ideal world people would be able to play the game in moderation fine but sometimes thats easier said than done and i think a month in some people are feeling that strain, making the game a victim of its own success in many ways.
---
oh youre one of those people, good luck
---
Then I stand corrected. Thanks.
---
We had to collect donations within the guild to get our main tank an epic mount , as he ran into the same problem.   I have no idea what a warrior can do.  maybe mining and getting a lot of arcane crystals?
---
https://youtu.be/ctVrpQ-orss
---
Yeah don't take much note of those that state farming thousands of gold is fast and easy. They're the same ones that were 60 a week after release.
---
You then ask their /played and it's more than your full time job.
---
Another thing is lots of preraid BiS items for tanks are dps items. LBRS crossbow namely, but there's also Maraudon's ring, HoJ, etc.
---
Yep, this is what I found out ‘accidentally’. Leveling became a chore, so I started focusing on my pre-bis and now I only need one more piece of loot from BRD at level 56
---
Not if you buy it on AH.
---
a 40 man multiboxer.  There's at least 2 in the US and 1 in EU.  Quite possibly more.
---
Congrats :)
---
You'll use it until BWL probably!
---
I think eating just increases your normal health regen. Normal health regen stops in combat. Mana regen is active when you dont cast for 5s.
---
Wait wut, a friend of me has a char named celinedion, what is this about?!
---
why do healers generate heal-aggro then? are there really two different gms not knowing how this game works?!
---
No, it janky threat from healing works only with healing, you can try it yourself in next open world raid group, throw a rejuvenation on someone wounded, watch them move 50y away, and you won't get threat from mobs he's fighting
---
Because I’m probably going to see this person for about 5 mins and then never again.
---
My warrior is currently level 38. 
---
wPvP really wasn’t an issue up until STV. Not that it was a huge issue there either, but I had one horde player at level 60 that corpsecamped me and my friend for a solid hour while we tried to get tusks for the WW axe quest.
---
As a solo leveling warrior you often feel like a sitting duck. You’re vulnerable, and others know this. With that being said, warriors aren’t as bad as most people say. At level 36 I was attacked by a 41 feral druid and his friend, a 34 warlock. I thought for sure I was dead, but with a couple of lucky crits and immunity to fear I managed to kill both. 
---
Other than that, when seeing players of the opposing faction I’m always mentally prepared to get ganked, it wasn’t like that when I leveled my hunter.
---
Which Ah addons would you recommend ?&gt;
---
I said that in the OP.
---
I dont think the commitment required for an RP server is quite for me but i bloody love reading posts like this! Always make me chuckle.
---
Classic should stay classic.
---
Should have killed him. Since he was afk, the thought of him realizing he was killed by someone with the same name in the combat log is hilarious
---
It's a reference to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqCkDcx6KIs)
---
Fuck asmongold, we were doing this before he was because it's actually clearly better. It doesn't take a 30iq streamer to realize that either.
---
small talk sucks
---
Alchemy is great money maker. Make fap potions health/mana potions, make sure you make or sell your arcanite on cooldown. And make armor potions.(with everyone so obsessed with the fury prot spec they sell like hotcakes).
---
Farm dungeons, the random crap drops in high level dungeons sell great and the random boe can be worth alot 
---
Get good at strat living side. Some groups will give first orb to a good tank As a thank you. And even if they dont you can get lucky and win a few rolls yourself
---
For leveling, definitely. Everyone's a DPS while leveling.
---
At level 60 as long as you state it in advance and the group is ok with it, sure.
---
If you're rolling one for fun, roll the race you prefer.
---
Alchemy is the best prof to make money. If you know what you are doing.
---

---
Thats not how the taunt works. The taun skill actually gives you 10% more threat to that mob than the guy already hitting it. If you bursted a mob and a tank taunts it, the dps can go nuts cause the taunt granted the tank a lot of treath.
---
Questing in zones populated by orcs should give you Orgrimmar rep : Ashenvale, STV through Grom'gol, SoS, Badlands, etc.
---
Keep in mind Orgrimmar is a Horde rep, and as such gains 20% of all your rep gains in the faction. As an exmaple, gaining 100rep with Undercity gives you 20rep with Orgrimmar.
---
LBRS with a 60 fury warrior tank that swapped to shiekd when needed. A 55 and 60 hunter, a 57 mage and me, a 55 druid 0/30/16 healing in resto Q rewards. 
---
Run is pretty smooth till we jump down next to the lava. We do a sheep pull and start killing the first pack. We moce around the corner to LoS the remaining caster and he comes running. After a bit the sheep pops JUST as a patrol walks by and he was close enough to the next pack to pull it all. The mage dies pretty quick and I battleress him. The tank is doing pretty well but dies when there are still 4 mobs up with one just about to flee.
---
The tank dies cause of the 1000 added fire damage debuff and the 60 hunter falls quickly after. I put HoT’s on myself and go bear stunning 1 caster and charge another. The lower hunter and mage clean up while I stay barely alive.
---
I'm taking that as a compliment, as Hpal I always buff a hunters mana unless they specifically ask otherwise. 
---
And like, I'll buff pets if I remember but more often than not I'm busy keeping up yolo tanks who like to pull everything they see at once.
---
Problem is, a lot of quests require drops which doubles the kills needed when you group with one other person and increase accordingly with each additional party member.
---
If it wasn't already broken, it probably is now.
---
Ganked much by rogues?
---
&gt; You then ask their /played and it's more than your full time job.
---
LOL, exactly!
---
&gt;  I dont know how you realise that i am expecting all bugs to be fixed in the first mount of release. 
---
Because of this line of text :  
---
&gt; no one of my bug reports is fixed until now. 
---
and  
---
&gt; you know any other place where i can post bugs, 
---
Be more patient, or log an GM ticket and ask your question to a Blizzard employee
---
Well, yesterday while looking to fill a spot for BRD, some warrior ignored my healer friend who was searching after not receiving an answer for a full 1 1/2 minutes!
---
Those people exist, those people will sooner or later leave the game. They are the same people who report you for every single thing that rubs them the wrong way.
---
Me and my friend are levelling a priest/warrior together and Im really glad its just the two of us. More people mean more hold ups. To add to what you were saying, even if you all decide what to do there's always "oh i need some more food/water gimmie 5 mins" or "whoops I need to get my bags emptied" or a hundred other little things that end up causing lots of waiting around. With 2 people it can be mildly frustrating but with 5... nah.
---
Trolls have bow racial aswell
---
No, you're not weird for liking a dungeon most people don't. Everyone has the right to like a different part of the game. Most people dislike Gnomeregan for the same reasons WC is disliked : it's long, you can get lost easily, etc.
---
Wrong
---
Grab PallyPower makes buffing pets easier.
---
You forgot the two biggest offenses:
---
1. Rendering all level 58+ content obsolete, especially the entirety of Vanilla's endgame.
---
2. Tearing all high-level players out of the world.
---
Nope, it was Sauron that imprisoned him in Tol-in-Gaurhoth.
---
If you can’t decide between two classes then go by more trivial factors to distinguish them. For example I prefer how Shaman armour looks at late game versus Druid armour, and their spell animations and lore just resonate more with me than Druids.
---
This is definitely broken, don’t listen to the others
---
mhh, you're right, this might be the case here. i still do not understand why this is done wrong so often.
---
Solod him 4 weeks ago as druid too.
---
Took me 20 minutes tho
---
I am level 13 so I usually just charge in, rend, hamstring, and then switch to defense and kite while stacking sunder. I can kill one mob without hamstring kiting it just leaves me so low
---
I use [Mastersmith Hammer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18048/mastersmiths-hammer) for tanking, 14 Spelldmg is quite nice.
---
Regarding the Stormhammer, I don't see an aoe proc as particularly useful, aoe threat is generally not a problem for a paladin tank, single target threat is the problem and flurry axe is simply better for that, the extra swing + SoR proc will generate far more threat than the nature dmg. Faster speed also means it scales better with Spelldmg.
---
When warlocks / paladins talk about free mounts they are really only talking about the level 40 mount.  It's still cheaper though.
---
This is why when I level these classes I still farm gold as if I was going to buy a level 40 mount.  By resisting the temptation at all to spend what I have saved on other things, there's no issue at all affording the mats for the epic mount.
---
Why do the guards not spawn on you?
---
You should check out Frostadamus  or something like that on twitch. Has like 5k plus gold
---
I found in my experience if I set realistic goals in WOW it helps. I gave myself 6 months to make 60. I am level 39 now and if I ding 60 before the 6 months that will be a bonus. I have had a fun time just taking it slow and doing lots of traveling. It helps that I main a druid and travel form helps alleviate the travel time.
---
As a healer the damage warlocks do to themselves from life tapping should be added to my damage done tab 
---
I thought you could only do the quest once per day?
---
they did, while time. Apparently not in the canal though?
---
I was in Fereales Last night and I caught alot of Big Mouth Clams and one Winter Squid.
---
I was wondering if it was worth just staying there and fishing but I might have just got lucky.
---
Ive read somewhere that NightFin and Squid can only be fished at select times though.  Also I dont fish from ocean pools at the moment but is that what I should be aiming to do ? Or are pools only for inland?
---
Not seem 1 ocean pool yet in my time in Fereales
---
No, i sell them raw. Recipe is usually expensive and not worth it.
---
Lucky for you, my market is mad right now cost me about 350 for all the materials except black dragonscales which I’m farming
---
Yep same, except I have about 10 characters max level 13... 
---
I feel settled on druid though as I can just re-reoll inside myself. Want to be a rogue? Cat form. Then some tanking in bear. Maybe do some healing later. :D
---
Distract shot before FD
---
Just use 2 cruel barbs until like 35
---
Why?? I like to know these things. I have a 60 shaman that I pretty much just raid log into now. I am ready to level an alt.
---
I am level 37 and already bought 2 (one at 14g and one at 25g).  
---
I'm poor as fuck now.
---
Most of the time I get a "I can't see pet HP" because the healers haven't set up their Add-ons correctly (or play fully vanilla) :(
---
Nobody cares
---
You're only looking at one side of the coin. A lot of low level mats like Wicked Claws are going to skyrocket in prices as well, so selling things you pick up while leveling earns you more gold.
---
Unyielding maul is basically the same stats and can take elemental sharpening stones.
---
also a sewer that flows down into the city rather than out of it.
---
It probably depends a bit. If there are enough or almost enough enemies for everyone, then it's fine to not accept, but if they are very few, then you shouldn't force the other people to wait in the same spot for 20-30 minutes waiting for respawns. One of the insect types in Shimmering Flats comes to mind, only like 3 spawn and your quest requires killing 6, so even if you are only one person you are forced to wait for respawns. If you also have to fight for tags with someone else, it becomes that much worse.
---
Ah, I totally forgot free server transfers were a thing for high pop realms.
---
I suppose moving to a smaller realm actually increased the amount of people on your faction when the bias was so heavy on the old larger server. It's unfortunate Blizzard never bothered to help prevent or mitigate this problem. Something like queues for only the majority faction or free transfers off for them.
---
And gay is good.
---
Now THAT'S a breastplate
---
all I know is I am fucking sick of seeing all these generational descriptors.
---
If you're going to reach 60 soon it makes no difference.
---
Of course the cry babbies were mad, i would too!
---
So, if you play hunter and join a pug with people you never seen before and maybe wont ever again. You just pass up on the best trinket for your class  because.. Why?
---
If you had arrived after them I would've fully insulted you, but whoever is there first should get the kill. People shouldn't feel entitled to a named kill just because they're a full group.
---
...yeah, but your argument that altruism doesn't exist makes no sense.
---
I thought I pointed out clearly where you were off, but maybe there is something else wrong.
---
I'm in a similar situation. Just been wondering why you chose the two-hand specialisation over heroic strike? Don't you plan on tanking with a shield? I can post my current setup if you want a we can disscuss it, but it's a work in progress and I'm trying stuff out as well at the moment..
---
Did a guild group for this like 2 weeks ago, all the other healers didn’t get loot but I did.  Only difference was that I did damage
---
Which comes out to around 600g. That's a lot of gold to spend on acquiring a mount!
---
Hmm.. I guess Ill hold on to my FA till Ironfoe then. Thanks!
---
got flurry axe for 95g yesterday, with my blue tank gear, fiery weapon, seal of righteousness and judgement of the crusader i'm doing 100-120 dps single target
---
i'd say it's handy for the extra SoR procs if you're tanking, since that technically means more threat
---
Fellstead is free from a quest and it's the level 40 mount. Dreadsteed is the level 60 mount which requires a lot of quest chains and materials to complete. It's not free and will cost anywhere from 156g to 650g depending on how you do it. You can farm most of the mats yourself depending on your profession. You can also get the help of a warlock who already bought 3 of the reusable items.
---
It's nice to have alts on the same server but if you never have before, it's probably a good idea to see what the leveling experience is like for horde, so you experience some new content. And if you ever wanted to make a shaman for example, you would need to go on a different server anyway, so it's up to you.
---
As for hunters, I have a level 42 hunter which I'm starting to get bored of as the rotation is pretty brainless atm for me. It's basically just apply hunters mark, dot them whenever they don't have a dot, auto attack and use arcane shot when off cooldown. I believe at 60 it's roughly the same thing of auto attack and use aimed shot/multi shot when off cooldown, however I've heard hunters have a high skill ceiling so they may become more interesting up there (not sure myself). That said the leveling experience is a breeze and you can solo so many quests on your own quickly and efficiently, and PvP is pretty easy and fun as a hunter as well.
---
Also Prot Paladin life: 
---
Them: "Hey you want to tank a dungeon for us?"  
---
Me: "sorry I'm about to log off, next time I will though"  
---
\*10 Minutes pass\*  
---
Them: "Hey can you please heal for us in this dungeon?"
---
Won't see that kind of begging as a dps.
---
Likely not, and I would say because it may be that specific NPC that hits that specific canpfire, unless it has something to do with that certain water elemental
---
Damn, blizzard gm are rly starting to look like clowns
---
No spirit is your regen thanks to talents leave mp5 for the shammies
---
It's not even that.
---
My addon is stating that 58-59 as a Hunter will take me around 4-5 hours of grinding. I have 1-2 hours a night to play. It's pretty demoralising to come home from a long day at work, to achieve absolutely nothing even after 2 hours of grinding on a game. Classics amazing if you've got the time, but if you don't you fall so far back.
---
MS paint
---
Arcanite Reaper?
---
If you are having to use consumables to open it, then take it.
---
I can agree here. My husband and I play, generally, at the same time; however, we dont tend to play together unless doing a dungeon. I like to grind quests, he likes to grind dungeons. So we kinda do our own thing for the most part until the time comes. Plus he has the ability to play more often than i do, so our levels got off set pretty fast lol.   
---
BUT i have made some great friends along the way in-game. So no harm no foul.

---
I know a guy who has his epic mount and his lionheart helm. He said he farmed stockades to make gold, just vendoring everything.. I don't know personally how lucrative it is, but I know another warrior that farmed elemental fire in arathi highlands (3-4g each on our server) and they have a 15% droprate or somewhere around that number.
---
ALSO once you hit 60, quests give gold instead of experience, a simple quest could net you 3g, the ras frostwhisper questline gives you around 30-40g throughout the whole quest plus rewards.
---
Another raw gold farm I use to do was killing the birds in deadwind pass, they all drop lots of grey, stackable items that vendor for quite a lot.

How does one get a mount with cloths?
---
Furious howl + trueshot auro comes out to a flat \~10.2 dps increase per party member. Not sure what the windfury version is, however it does scale with better gear unlike the hunter buffs.
---
&gt; Honestly most of the collect x of stuff drop for the whole party
---
While you're correct that *some* do, the vast majority of drop quests do *not* drop for the whole party.
---
Source: Leveled with a warrior all the way from 1-60 and it was uncommon for us not to have to farm double the quest drops.  Nice when it happened... but it didn't happen often.
---
There is nothing really complicated about playing a warlock. You have a lot of spells, but your rotation is going to be more simple than retail no matter what.
---
What service is this? Theres a gnome mage named pepitos on Earthfury who has killed me like 3 times in the last ten levels.
---
How though?  Gathering professions?  You can't match the pace of other farming characters, which can strip the spot out from under you.  Also, did you grab these before prices started inflating?  I know a friend of mine snagged a few epics for only 10g that are now climbing at 100g on the AH.
---
Try sixtyupgrades. It's not perfect but it's pretty good and the best I know of.
---
Or if you roll warrior “improvise, adapt, OVERPOWER!!!
---
Du hast die Zelda Quest nicht beendet, schäme dich.
---
Just make a macro that says
---
"/r Hey I'm just here grinding for loot, I'm not questing, sorry.  Good luck!"
---
I've used it a hundred times since Classic and not once have I had anyone get angry.  Most people either don't respond and go about their business, or reply "okay thanks, you too" and go about their business.
---
Ask any tank in WoW classic and they will disagree. There are no thanks that use a shield...for some odd reason.
---
Actually quite easy today because in retail you can loot herbs and ores up to 10 times before they will dissapear (or a few seconds after being picke). Which means you will get ten times the loot while farming.
---
Gz mate! Just in time for DM farm ;)
---
Obviously, I realize that neither mount is truly “free”. And I’m a little bit jealous that my mage can’t do something similar.
---
What a fucking weirdo, I honestly love seeing these types of posts. They make me laugh
---
Those are the main ones. Depends on your server but there might also be /global and /reddit
---
Searing gorge last night, guy invites me to kill golems. I only needed two he needed 15. I agree anyway. We kill one and there’s none near so I start killing a nearby spider that we both need. He kicks me. 
---
Fair enough.
---
I carry on killing spiders and then some of the nearby dwarves and he comes along when one is nearly dead and invites me, given that 2 minutes earlier he just kicked me for no reason I decline. Dude proceeds to start swearing and hurling abuse at me saying I should go back to retail. When I point out he kicked me two minutes earlier ‘oh, well I don’t remember that’ 
---
...
---
That's not a bad idea.  Assuming there is a person willing to pay or a group willing to meet those terms/split the bill.
---
imagine all the people
---
Oh my god that’s brilliant! Love it will save that for the memory later!
---
I don’t see that much wrong with it, if anything it preserved it and they weren’t forgotten
---
Oh wait, you don't realise this is a joke, OP??
---
Ahh thanks
---
I personally like seeing the party's members portraits. Feels more like a team. Plus it's how I played back in the day, so there's a certain nostalgic element.
---
You know if it's your alt account you may have a better time playing a druid as it's a bit more versatile. Unless you fully expect getting an alt to 60 and putting in serious time to it I would roll druid and just tank / heal / dps dungeons. Sounds fun, and my main is a 56 shaman.

I have nothing to do at work, so here you go!  Corrections in *italics* 
---
&gt; I was doing some quests in ~~desolation~~  *Desolace*, and one of *the*  quest lines end in a fight between me vs *a* cultist and his master, a powerful demon. I clearly remember the quest because in another quest from this quest line when *I* was helping the npc to find this demon, the demon and his cultist *appeared* in *an* illusion to laugh *at* our efforts, in this moment (and when *I* see "elite" in the quest log) *I* realized* that *I* need help!
---
&gt;But before *I* seek help *I* need to find the spot of the cultist and his master! (I *do* not use *a* quest addon so *I* started my journey to the south and after some *time looking I* founded both! The elite lvl 40 demon and your cultist! But * just* when *I* was going to start *typing* in guild chat my mouse was resting *on* the spell "enslave demon" and as a new player who never played wow before * I did not know* that "enslave demon" is a spell *that* evolves with the warlock.  And what a good surprise when *I* see that this spell *at* the current level *can* enslave demons up to lvl 40, so *I* just *thought:* "lets see if this works", *I* start the cast and *I* enslave the powerful demon in front of his cultist and order him to kill the cultist and *I*  *laughed* thinking *about the powerful demon and his cultist and his pride, being forced to fight each other* because a *filthy* undead warlock enslaved *the demon*! But *it did not end here*, the demon easily killed his cultist, so *I* *rest?* his minion in front of his eyes (because *I* needed *to* heal some damage)  and  then after *I was healed, I* start to send the demon to attack random *infernals* and other demons,  to do damage to the elite demon and sometimes *when* I *sent* the elite to kill other mobs *I* hear the quote "you will be the next" so *I laughed* because until 30 mins ago this was a *prideful* demon, but now the demon becomes a pet *for the enjoyment* of a *filthy* undead. After some mobs *were* killed *I dispel* the enslave spell, so the elite demon goes mad *and starts attacking* me with his demon pride *destroyed?* by this stupid warlock in front of his eyes, with all the dignity that *is* left *in him* the demon comes at me!...*Then I fear him and *watch* the rest of his *dignity* be burned down by *an* immolate *while I laugh* like a mad man! Hahaha.

Blizzard make twice as much money off you if you use two accounts. Blizzard like money. So it's fine.

1600g at 70g/2 hours is 44 hours.

Yeah not that difficult for you no lifers
---
Who am I? Who are you?

mine has gone thru so many times, just got the legs, level 24 now... still no chest, havent even seen it drop :(
---
naked trolls arent my thing, sorry
---
You didn't originally say it depends... you just blanketed everyone that doesn't group is an asshole. You are just as bad.
---
Technically, weaving melee between autoshots is the highest theoretical dps a hunter can do. So if you are super tryhard orc might have an edge.
---
No you didn't, but I can clearly see you can't understand sarcasm or just voluntarily don't want to take it into account, just to be able to reply that ? the point was about having decency...
---
Keep yer beffs on da grouund.
---
I guess what I'm saying is if you have all 16s bags then this isn't really much profit to work for. It's 20-30g and we can earn that much faster as level 60. 
---
If you don't have 16s bags, then you don't get 20-30g profit. You get 20-30g value for free. That is different than profit.
---
Anyone born after ~1997 is Gen Z, actually.
---
Loot rules were CLEARLY stated beforehand, so it's completely fair you won.
---
I'm very jealous though :P Would love to have TF on my rogue!
---
Yeah I just fish the nightfin in camp mojache, feralas. Those fish specifically are best fished at night (12am-6am). Catch rate is 25%. Think you can make like 10-13g per hour, on my server anyway
---
British person here, can confirm this was said with banterous intent
---
Possibly, I haven't been to that area in years. I wandered onto it by accident, I thought it was just a nice part of the map, I didn't realize it was part of the rogue quest.
---
Maybe.
---
In vanilla if you didn't hit 60 at the start, before BWL/Nax, then it was impossible to catch up as no one ran the dungeons for pre-raid BIS. I'm worried this will happen here too. Once people are fully BiS geared there's very little to actually do.
---
it's classic set, but m'kay
---
Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v
---
Im not going hunting for it.
---
I spent an entire evening (~3-4 hrs) in Un'goro and cleared out almost every quest in the zone and I got from level 51-&gt;52. yay. 
---
now off to felwood.
---
Hope it wont be too long for your desk to arrive, because this looks uncomfortable as fuck
---
Just wondering, what’s the name of your ranged attack timer?
---
Okay. Never more than 5, got it.
---
But the part that i still not understand is that I was physically inside WITH THE PRIEST. And when I went outside, I did not reset it (wasn't possible with priest still inside). So by my logic I should be able to walk back inside and join the instance with the priest still in it. But I couldn't. I was still on that instance ID yet couldn't enter.
---
I forgot about the XP converting to gold!  
---
I've been stripping the zones barren of quests so far.  I think I only have EPL and half of Winterspring left to chew off once I hit 60, though.  Plus the end game dungeon quests.  
---
Elementals might work if I get there at off-peak hours.  Last time I was there, it was fairly busy and hard to tag.
---
Well he might
---
Sure but why report someone for not grouping?  You know that's going to go nowhere - pretty sure it was a joke based off him saying "get off".
---
If there wasn't an option in the interface to show the pet's HP. (I believe there is) then I would be sad for this comment because of the mindset that people need addons.
---
Cops rape and torture people like psychopathic kids with a cat. Imagine the amount of self entitlement that takes, now imagine they have time off, no kids, no wife.
---
I did think of it but he was in Gadgetzan so would rather not be pummelled by the guards! Il get him at some point I’m sure ;)
---
2% crit is nice, stamina is good for PvP and int is just decent on hunters. i\`d say it\`s a weapon for Kazzak attempts.
---
DM is comming out in a couple of days, healers Will stand in queue to do DM east jumpruns with you. This will be your best moneymaker by far for the rest of classic.
---
I literally started making this video yesterday, you beat me to it. RIP
---
I told you how. Just go to a spot and farm for 2-3 hours at least and see how much you got, don't tell yourself that other classes will farm faster than you. Yeah they will farm faster than you, so what? did not get any of those epics for some scam price, deep woods - 300, flurry 150, edge 300, devil set 300.
---
I blame Fortnite, the first thing kids do in that game when they are attacked is built a 4 story building around themselves. We're looking at a future generation that runs and hides from all difficulties lmao.

^ I used to say this as a joke but it's im starting to think there might be some truth in there.
---
Walking? To me it looks like people were dragged
---
He got da good stuff mon.
---
typical boomer comment /s
---
This is the right idea, no one would expect a priest to be hiding underwater. Get the hydrostaff, hop your way into hyjal, and sit at the bottom of the pool
---
I hardly buff people on my pally... mainly because I'm prot and I tank. So you either have me sitting to regen mana because I buff or I pull another group.
---
Cool! And do you know if for ex. dark iron node and thorium node can share spawn place? To me, it seems it does.
---
"pvp"
---
prebis, not bis, but also not worth the 20 arcanite at current pre-dm prices imo.
---
Cooking, fishing and first-aid are secondary professions - you won't lose those.
---
Yeah multiboxing is not as easy as some people think unless you really only spam moonfire. As soon as you are using multiple classes it becomes complicated really fast.
---
Not that I'm aware of. +Healing is the undisputed first priority. After that, I'm pretty sure raw Intellect equates to more overall healing output than Spirit or MP5, especially due to the shorter nature of encounters in Classic. Meditation also allows for 15% of your Spirit to regenerate Mana whilst casting, alleviating the need to prioritise MP5 as much.
---
I could be completely wrong though!
---
Thanks! Might stick it out then. :-)
---
No one can use it until phase 3. As long as you reach 60 by then you are no less deserving than anyone else.
---
Shouldn't one be a level 10 dagger? I am surprised at how hard lifesteal can carry a bad wep
---
Yeah, I can only play if I am able to login before teh masses arrive.
---
That looks so great, I would love do this too! I had a few questions if you don't mind:
---
-What are the dimensions of the printed map?
---
-Do you find that size to be large enough/easy to read all the information or would you change the size if you were to print it again?
---
- Did you choose the medium quality picture file to send to vista-print (40ish mb I think)?
---
- How much did it cost?
---
Thanks much in advance!
---
and btw that's first time i draw female character in such "aerodynamic" outfit, so could be less judgemental.
---
Yeah as I said, I understand it for gather quests and don't mind seeing people kill the same mobs solo.
---
I had my ignore list full, I had to delete old idiots to put new ones. It was same as today.

---
Insanely well done!
---
Which hunter wouldn't though ^^^^^;)
---
But Meegan, your coat though.
---
Because most people realised that the hype of classic wasnt all that. There are so many people doing the same quests, drop rates are god awful, respawns take ages and it takes ages to level if you work full time and can only play during peek hours.
---
Ask for his social credit, whoever has more gets the spot!
---
Yep. Ravager In dungeons is OP. Get ready to dps with the mages.
---
I'm not 100% sure but i think you mean BRE, OEB and earthshaker were both in the game back then I believe.
---
That is the last fight of the run, not the last fight of the dungeon.
---
Right? I'm still baffled by the existence of gnomes...
---
My char is named Orodreth :D
---
All unique abilities were removed as of 1.12, only differences in pets is their base attack speed now
---
I would love for them to adopt the polling system from OSRS. Its such a good system that allows the game to grow but all in the hands of the players. And the layering of the polls is essential, as in, not just a yes or no to the new content, but detailing how it should be implemented. Honestly, blizz should do some research into that system. I thought the same thing once classic launched.
---
Honestly if I was that MT I just wouldn't tank for your guild again.
---
But morally you were fine to roll on the bindings.
---
No, you found the original owner of the name and had to add special characters to get a name that looked like it.  You're kill on site 100%.
---
Very well done!
---
&gt; If they're eating/drinking, they're bad at teaming
---
thats where it often fails and at that point i rather don't even try, because leaving in the middle usually means more drama.
---
i mean, it does get pretty scarce at the end, unless you want to do every single quest and visit hubs like azshara or silithius for 3 quests.
---
This is some weapons-grade autism right here
---
wat, the shoulders look fantastic!
---
Sometimes I don't group with people for kill quests because I'm not fully paying attention to WoW (sometimes I kill a couple of mobs, then go do some homework for 20 min, then back to killing a couple of mobs, etc) and I don't want the group to think I'm some kind of flake or die because they expected me to be there and I wasn't.
---
I will say that grouping for kill quests is definitely my preference though.
---
But it’s not big and blue though!
---

Correct. He states many many times with pulse totems that they "will probably not" or "may not immediately pulse" and you have to wait 2 seconds for the first. 
---
He didn't say verbatim every time, but it happens.
---
Also dropped items like that sometimes are just... Buggy.
---
Bonus points :
---
Berserker Rage before charging so you generate extra rage when hit.
---
Bonus bonus points if mobs don't hit you too hard, for big dick dps and initial aggro, when you're leveling and tanking instances as Arms:
---
*assuming you're already buffed Battle Shout because that always should be the case, just use remaining rage at the end of a pack before next one to rebuff)*    
---
    Berserker Rage -&gt; Battle Stance -&gt; Charge + Blood Rage -&gt; Sweeping Strikes -&gt; Zerk rage -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt; Def Stance -&gt; Demo shout -&gt; Sunder/Mortal Strike
---
Thin ice
---
Thicc boi !
---
This. If you think mages are strong now... whoosh. Early beta they were insane.
---
I don't think what you said has anything to do with self entitlement at all, if at all it just shows how mentally ill some people are. 
---
If that even happened.
---
Did you know that a man who’s truly skilled can look quite good in twill?
---
Fine.  Whatever.  It's a conspiracy.  They are out to get you or something. 
---
Jesus.
---
Nothing, but I'm not a cop, just had to interact with them, get surgery because of them, lost 10k in schooling, pilots licence, house, tooth, some brain damage, had them falsify  evidence and reports, camera footage disappeared.
---
New player to WoW in general but I always wanted to start with the "classic experience". Is it normal to die a lot in the beginning? I am a 14 alliance mage and I must have died 10 or more times in westfall already, the enemies are just SO dangerous and a stroke of bad luck like accidentally pulling a single extra mob means death even if you full sprint away. Granted, I am doing much better after realizing frost is a million times better and sticking with that, but still 2 equal level enemies is one too many to handle. Am I doing something blatantly wrong or am I just terrible?
---
Yeah heartseeker now has double the alliance of stalagg, despite stallag being a much more populated server. 
---
The horde dont make it any easier either. 
---
They sit in front of UBRS with 10 people not even wanting to run the dungeon just mind controlling people down and killing them far enough away they cant rez close to the portal. 
---
Their are always 5-10 horde raiding furbolgs for e'ko so getting winterspring furbolg quests done is literally impossible, even at like 5-11am their are still MINIMUM 5 horde partied. 
---
herbs and minerals and such are ridiculously expensive alliance side because places like EPL have 20+ horde on both layers scouting for herbs and minerals and will jump any alliance on site and help each other.
---
Alliance are basically only allowed in safe zones on stalagg, everywhere else is dominated by pvp starved horde.
---
A druid in my group last night lost a roll on some pants. He started saying he couldn't believe he lost a roll to someone from shit guilds like us even though we were all different guilds and he lost the roll to one guy.  He dropped group and berated us for being in shit guilds and rolling on his loot while he waited for port.  Insane.
---
Yeah it’s a horde server for sure but idk what the actual numbers are.. so still see a good bit of alliance but it’s easy to see horde is dominant
---
Or the easiest part if you are a warrior
---
I was actually inspired by that one :D
---
Troll for pve and orc for pvp id say- the bow bonus of trolls is quite beneficial to your endgame hit rate, can probably skip some of the early hit chance talents too and get raw dps instead.
---
Not a warrior, but honestly wPvP can be exhilarating sometimes. No better feeling than someone attempting to gank you, and you then counter kill and hit them with the /spit, or if you hunt down and kill someone who ganked you before. 
---
Honestly though, i have very rarely been ganked, and never corpse camped. As other people here are saying, usually people just go about their own leveling and don't waste time trying to kill you. I have a similar mentality where I don't start a fight with people unless provoked. 
---
That being said, in phase 2 when the honour system is here I'm sure this is going to change DRASTICALLY. I have a feeling most people are going to switch to KOS and if you're on faction with lower numbers (usually ally), unless you group you're gonna get ganked a lot.
---
 If you've never experienced wPvP before, definitely give it a shot! You may find you really enjoy it (I was dreading the thought but once i got that adrenaline rush from a few battles I love it). However wPvP as a warrior may be difficult especially in the earlier levels, so maybe use this as an excuse to make an alt :)
---
Interesting how when Chinese police do it, it's war crime, when Canadian police do it, I deserved it.
---
During their escape they take the silmaril from Melkors crown?
---
On our server it's going down and there is a lot of it. I bought up all runecloth on AH under 1.7g per stack. And that was often only a few stacks.
---
Now I see dozens of stacks @ 1.4-1.5g
---
Still only halfway... Also, all the runecloth is still in the mailbox in case I decide to give up. That way I can still sell it again.
---
Thought you said pool elemental for a sec haha
---
I use a shield! There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
40 man Death Knight mutlibox was literally AoE lag hell. (Thinking about it, maybe it was 20, effect was horrible nonetheless)
---
I rly tried! Thanks!
---
If they've already tagged the rare quest mob spawn you don't have time to whisper. Not everyone reads their chat in combat.
---
Like sure if their not in combat whisper but if they are I don't think it's rude.
---
Thanks for all of your replies guys, I really do appreciate it.
---
I think i'm going to go for this;

---
It has most of the main tanking talents that I want (just missing 10 Defence, Shield Slam &amp; 10% 1 hander damage) while keeping the 5% crit chance from Fury, sweeping strikes for the Swifty macro (that I love, no matter what people think of Swifty), all of the impale talents for extra damage/threat and improved Overpower for even more damage/threat.
---
I put the last spare point into improved charge as the extra rage will mean I can pop the macro as soon as I charge into a group of mobs meaning quick damage/threat before I change to defensive stance and start sundering.
---
With this build I can carry on playing my Warrior like I am now while being much more tanky so i'm pretty happy. 
---
Thanks again everyone :)
---
Well If I could force you to know it you would.
---
Bullshit semantic argument followed by desired expectation. Goodbye.
---
I stand corrected.
---
Guess I encountered a visual bug in an earlier version of auctioneer.
---
You're not aware of blizzards stance regarding LGBT stuff?
---
If they're just trying to quest while I'm farming felcloth / runes I always invite them on the condition I get all felcloth and runes.
---
&gt; Yet it truly is classic for me.
---
Yup same thing here. Everyone was so damn excited, talking about how fun it was going to be dungeoning and raiding together. The queues fractured us up bad the first week. 
---
A small number of us that landed on the same server played together the first night and were spread out levels starting the second. I saw them for maybe 2 dungeons as I went 1-60. Now they're rolling Alts on other servers, some have server transferred and the couple of us that are left aren't even in the same guild. 
---
Completely alone. Completely classic.
---
Can someone explain to me what makes this staff good?
---
Thank you so much for your work /u/Morihalda and OP, I printed it on a wall tapestry 1.50m\*1.30m and it looks awesome :

Until you can spec in to improve Blizzard around 20 it'll be a little tough. I'm playing a mage for the first time and using this guide to help with aoe spec and macros and general help.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-leveling-guide#AoEGrinding
---
So its gonna take 2 nights to pop a level. Really not that hard. Just do some Arena/Anger spams.
---
most of the gear isn't even good on a hunter. strength is a useless stat
---
What is just not true? My experience I shared?
---
Geez what kind of attitude is that, you seriously don't buff players because you're a tank?
---
If you get the charge - you just oneshot that mage. Ir if you bring a priest with you.
---
Good to know thanks
---
No no no, you don't understand. They're *support*. lmfao
---
Nope, just ungodly luck.
---
Oddly enough I was always alive after alt-tabbing, but then when I started playing I would almost instantly encounter lvl ?? hordies.
---
If you're a lvl ?? Tauren Hunter and you killed a Human Priest in STV yesterday. fite me irl.
---
Grounding totem has always absorbed the next spell immediately after I place it. What’s happening in the video is a bug.
---
Why do you think he’s in the dungeon at all if not hoj?
---
You need to be exalted with another faction if you want to buy their mount. You do that by going to the faction cloth master and give them 20 runecloth for 50 rep.
---
That means you need thousands upon thousands of runecloth to hit exalted.
---
Once you do that, you can buy the riding skill and mount for that faction, meaning another 900g.
---
guys i am new to tanking (in vanilla) and was wondering am i allowed to roll on this items? The stats are way better and even agi helps me, but obviously as a warrior i can wear mail (and plate at 40) while these are leather
---
Alliance Server - Human Ret Pally / NE Shadow Priest
---
\- I know both are sub-par to the say the least when it comes to raiding, although I definitely don't have nearly the ability to raid this go around as I did when the game first launched with my rogue so I will likely be jumping in with content that has already been cleared by the guild to begin with as I am not even close to 60 as is.
---
\-Both characters are at level 30 and I enjoy each for different reasons. The Pally is fun with weapon progression and seeing the burst numbers jump with Ret &amp; the S Priest is fun because I will be able to stealth up and hang out in the shadows with 2 rogues that I play with. 
---
\-Either way I'd be a sub-optimal spec with a Shadow Priest with a few talents elsewhere or a Pally either as 20/0/31 for raiding or a mix of holy / prot to get get the weapon spec.
---
That's fine, but then there is still no need to get angry at people if they don't want to party.
---
You seem too dense and you're also choosing what you want from what I said, as well as how you're interpreting it instead of trying to understand what I ment, also you're making no sense. There's no discussion here, so... I'm gonna head out.
---
My ass they don't. Millions of people have died upholding them.
---
So what is better then? Staff gives +2% crit +15 int &amp; +26 sta. Next to this +10 nature resist and 46AP when fighting demons. Both not that important. 
---
You could say Barbarous Blade. Give 60AP and +1% crit. But not sure if that is really better. Or from MC loot, Brutality Blade + Core hound tooth. Which is +9 str, +9 Agi, +9 Sta, +20AP, +2% Crit. Which could be a little bit better. But not much better like you say.
---
Thanks for the laugh OP.
---
People are playing more "pure" classes because unlike 15 years ago we now know just how useless meme specs really are.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah. I saw a Priest do it. Basically just kept dots on her and kited. Took awhile but he makes a decent amount of gold selling runs. I think Warlocks and Hunters can do it faster, but it's doable on a Priest too. 
---
Get the scepter and know where your purchaser needs to stand to be safe and still be looted the ring. Hint, it's before you even zone in, in the waterfall area.
---
I can’t read it on my phone.  What did he say?
---
Your back is going to be fucked.
---
Wow, thanks!
---
With this probably this syory will be easily read by more people!
---
Tbh i just not give you a gold now because i have no one :/
---
TrueStory™️
---
As a Warlock how much of my gear slots should be focusing on increasing spell dmg vs getting an increase in Stamina/Intellect? All the website say #1 stat priority is spell dmg, but how much is to much?
---
I use to play hide and seek for gold in various zones back in vanilla. I'd use snowman disguises and just sit there trying to last as long as possible without being found. The foolproof method that always worked the longest was to get a bunch of water breathing potions off the AH and go sit underwater at the bottom of the ocean.
---
So I would probably pick a coastal zone, find a sunken ship a decent ways off the coast and chill in there with 50 water breathing potions to last me  the 24 hours. Otherwise theres a few places in azshara that no one ever bothers to try to get to.
---
It takes a lot of experience to know you and your characters limits. The "vanilla experience" is very much about grinding and to know where your limits are at. Many zones have unique monsters which requires unique encounter tactics which can only be known by encountering them. So I'd say it's normal to die much in the beginning since you don't know the zones or mobs you are fighting. I've levled like 10 chars to 60 over the years and I still die a couple of times wich each char, so don't feel bad about it :)
---
The Google.
---
I’ve never had this happen in years of pservers and classic. Are you sure you are an innocent bystander.
---
No, man. Blizzards determination that "there are no bugs for any escort quests" isn't true.
---
Yeah I like doing that on trash pulls. Once you WW you are never losing aggro lol.
---
The launch really dismayed me and my partner's will to play. And because the group we wanted to play with picked a massive server to start on, the queues every night were 4-6 Hours +. We did not nor did we want to Remote Desktop from work and try to stay logged in...however other people in our group did. My partner wasn't the biggest fan of WoW, and though we played 30-40 hours together, it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had reliving the nostalgia. 
---
If the launch was better prepared and more people were allowed to play together, it probably would of been a great experience. But now everyone else is level 60 and starting on more alts, and I'm still level 18 on my Warrior without a lot of time to play.
---
I realize that Classic is here to stay, and I may come back and visit in the future, but for now I've put the idea of playing the game in it's former glory on the back burner.
---
I've literally never seen anything even remotely close to this and I have 30+ days played. Neither has my girlfriend who is much more casual and is still level 42.
---
Everyone has been incredibly nice. If someone kills a mob you need for a quest before you get a chance to group up, they pretty much always say sorry and offered to help you and wait for the respawn. 
---
This is on Thunderfury-Horde if anyone was curious.
---
Bonebiter is alliance only.
---
Op is horde.
---
Oh, I have to check that when I get home as buffs works fine but setting judgements didn't seem to work.
---
&gt;with just one point you are effectivly blocking 1 more hit every \~6 seconds
---
Ooooh that's awesome, thanks!
---
&gt; i dont know if the 10% armor or the 10 points in defense is better. 
---
I don't either really, just heard that people tend to not pick the defense talent sometimes and I didn't really have much points to spare since I took the crit from fury. It doesn't seem like that big of an issue right now, I had it before when I went deep protection. Maybe someone else can shed some light..
---
The hunter probably didn't turn off their pets taunt.
---
There’s not much a Warrior can farm himself. In a few days you can do DM:E jump runs with a healer which can be very lucrative. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto
---
What about the alliance players that DIDN'T enjoy a shit tier pvper who couldn't hang with his own level? If he's "bored" at 53 and fucking with level 30s i feel sorry for any level 40s if this guy gets to 60 and actually gets any gear.
---
If they cant abide by the loot rules adn harass you for that they should be warned and if repeated, kicked out the guild by your GM. If they are randoms, god, ignore block and incinerate their names.
---
Timing is actually perfect lol. My plan was to get my mage 60 well before P2 so I can start farming DM. Worked out pretty well.
---
Hypothetically if I were a fresh 60 Rogue and wanted to pickpocket my way to my epic mount in LBRS or BRD, about how many hours would that take?
---
I'm only 52 but fully intend to do this when I'm 60. And yes, I'll respec to pick up that sweet 15% faster walk speed while stealthed. For this grind.
---
&gt;Or are they expecting to get paid?
---
If you spent gold on those materials, and then some random asks you to go, wouldn't you want some sort of payment in lieu of 1) your time helping and 2) buying the materials?
---
Personally, I wouldn't charge guildies.
---
yeah I'm in LFG and a guild, lotta the guild is closer to 50 though. But yeah I'm hoping its an SM thing, but I see posts for ZF same stuff too
---
what about if you stand somewhere where there are already loads of humans?
---
You can can go full shadow and heal absolutely fine. There is no reason to spec into holy until end game content besides your personal  preference.
---
00:00-06:00 (nightfin)
---
06:00-12:00 (nightfin/sunscale)
---
12:00-18:00 (sunscale)
---
18:00 - 00:00 (nightfin/sunscale)
---
I guess you were the "first person" to do this.
---
It takes a while to get used to it, but keep in mind that if the quests get too hard in a zone, you might want to go to another zone for more managable quests, for your level I would suggest Loch Modan.
---
If you play human or orc, you benefit more from wearing the devilsaur set.
---
I have been lucky, the opposite has happened to me.
---
We started out with 4 people. Now more old friends have come back and we are all still playing, almost a dozen of us now.
---
You will find new friends OP. I believe in you.
---
I mean you would need the slowest bow in existence, too
---
Nope. That name means quite a lot for me in IRL, so I was lucky to get it.
---
As human BIS is flamegauntlets out of mc.
---
😬
---
Looks very well orcanized.
---
that'll show them
---
You're right.  What dungeons are you running for that income?
---
When I was about 35, I camped the Flats searching for him to get this sword. Made a /focus Ironeye macro. After about a day of searching I found him and got the sword :) The macro was a big help for anyone hunting Ironeye.
---
Yeah i wonder for how long i can keep tanking with 2h. I have a great 1h and shield, but it's just not as effective.
---
It lets you progress while doing nearly AFK things like the AH or offering lockpicking services for example.
---
I've mostly cleared Westfall and Loch Modan, is it worth it to go to darkshore at level 19 or should I just go to Redridge?
---
20 - 30 mins if you minimise deaths in Arathi and PVP
---
I just watched a video of someone doing it, maybe I’m stupid but what element of the run gives such good gold?
---
/r/titlegore
---
Well they are, at the end of the day, all things considered, right?
---
So you played like four evenings since release?
---
Hands Across Azeroth!
---
expect to pay some fee lower than 250g if it's just some random warlock.  if it's a guildie and they charge you for it i'd leave that guild.
---
Unfortunately, that is almost every private company. As someone who has worked in CS roles, it's safe to say that helping the customer is hardly ever the number one priority.
---
Was talking of pre-raid, since the Edgemaster's handguards are pre-raid too
---
For real that's gonna make people want pally tanks even less, pally buffs are amazing that's insane to not buff your party.
---
I have two rl friends playing.  We group up for elite quests, and that's about it. One of my friends is a grinder, when he logs on it's a-b-c-d-e quest grinding with few breaks. It's a chore to keep up with him when he's in that mode. 
---
The other friend generally plays the same hours, but we're on different parts of quest chains or feel like doing different leveling zones at different times.  We group up for instances or knock out elite quest chains like Crown of Will, etc.  I think that's a great compromise.
---
dont forget beast slaying and to a lesser degree bow skill.
---
I too like gnomeregan, but I understand why people hate it, it's a sprawling confusing dungeon with lots of annoying mechanics, enemies and patrols.
---
Clouds in WoW are part of the skybox not actually rendered with a mesh, so your altitude isn't causing it the weather is, those clouds are heavy weather clouds. But I suppose I'll take your word for it. I guess that just means either I'm incredibly unlucky for having never seen a storm yet or blizzard has fucked with the rate of heavy weather from vanilla. I'm guessing the latter again.
---
OTOH, when a priest invites me on my warlock...
---
Yeh i dont get it where people get that from lol
---
thanks! but why rank 1 serpent sting? too mana costly? does flare tag them and they cannot stealth/vanish? or do they get put out of stealth as long as they are in flare range?
---
Darkshore is a very good zone for leveling, but I think at 19 you're very close to having outgrown it.
---
Just charge people for dungeon runs :-) Warriors are a  wanted resource .. I make about 50g a day running them
---
Last time I was in Deadmines, the hunter butt-pulled Greenskin while we were still clearing the ramp. The only ones who got on the wheel were myself (tank) and the hunter. Everyone else died. Hunter and I realized we needed to go back for the priest because respawns. 
---
We died fighting respawns.
---
So we run back, rez, reform and clear respawns down to the boat. This time, the paladin butt-pulls Greenskin. I call for a reset and everyone makes it to the wheel except the paladin. Yakety Sax starts playing in my head as I watch him jump completely off the boat and into the water, dragging Greenskin and ALL the adds down with him, collecting yet more adds from the islands we didn’t clear and the backside of the boat, and finally dying again.
---
Players do dumb things in Deadmines.
---
Crimson Whelps are right on the north border of Wetlands so probably less than minutes walk
---
Prioritise stam whilst levelling at spell dmg at 60. You can tap for more mana during PVE pretty much infinitely with good healers, so stam isn't as important as damage. If you're PVPing you should find a balance.
---
Redridge is the way to go
---
There's a program people use that takes the input from the game you have active and sends it to the other games running in the background. Its the reason most if not all multiboxers run the same class on all chars.
---
The entitlement is strong now a days
---
Yeah, oh well. Might need to level a hunter again to check. Hunter raiding was fun after all. Pet pulling, afk and still top 10 DPS.
---
Loved that route as a paladin. Even if an enemy gets to the node first you can just stun, bubble and grab it.
---
Gutterspeak: Strange. Why does that tree have a name plate in red.
---
If they aren't there to kill the mobs they need for a quest but refuse to let you kill said mobs for a quest, I think that's preferably acceptable.
---
Take of Show helm. Dwarfs should never have helm enabled! Let that glorious beard flow
---
True, although these are kind of a fundamental and recurring problem with every expansion, not something specific to TBC. Then again, I guess it was TBC that introduced them, seeing as it was the first expansion, so still relevant.
---
It essentially comes down to every new expansion release effectively obsoleting the previous expansion's content by introducing a massive increase in levels and item power, to the point where quest reward greens in a new expansion is better than all but the most powerful legendaries from the previous expansion. The more I think about it, the more I've wondered if increasing the level cap in and of itself was just a huge mistake. And in current WoW it's even worse, as they're not only doing this between expansions but basically between every raid tier.
---
Same thing here. My friends all convinced me to roll on a pve server because they don't like pvp. Now i'm in too deep to consider starting over on a pvp server like i'd originally wanted to. I played myself.
---
That seems more likely, that he's AoE grinding an area that includes a named mob and people are asking to group and he's declining for whatever reason.
---
The 30 minutes of them "following him" is just them hanging out waiting for the respawn.  I'd probably tag a few mobs during that time as well.  Whether to troll or just keep the xp coming in during the downtime is up for debate.
---
I've just never seen anything like that happen, but I can definitely see one person getting mad for no reaaon when declined.  But if it's continually happening to one person, I have to think there is more to the story.
---
Here is a tip. Spend 2 points into improved charge and 5 in tactical mastery, so you can switch to defensive stance mid-charge and slam the main kill target for huge threat.
---
Ya thunderfury has some really nice people on it
---
And yet, the multistage questing and grouping is one of the things that makes Classic stand out from the lonely disengagement of Retail and GW2.
---
Others might suggest otherwise but I'd just hit Redridge and throw in some dungeons like DM or Stockades/SFK a bit later for extra exp plus gear!
---
I will never understand why people are so eager to express and celebrate their mediocrity.
---
that is exactly what it was, probably AOE farming mobs needed for a quest
---
PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
---
Ahh! I think that might be the answer.
---
There is one barbie face on the troll female, which is probably used by 80% of the troll females, including my mage :D
---
I haven't seen anything like it in retail. Or stuff like wolves killing critters. Don't think it happens in retail.
---
He himself is just controlling one single character while a software is distributing his commands to all other characters. So all 30 characters are performing the same action at pretty much the same time.
---
If you Win on a druid, there is some reasons : 
---
1- you outgear him by a lot
---
2- he's bad
---
3- you burst him so much hwith crit that you OS
---
as a druid player : mage should fear us, WE are the hard counter
---
Yes but the game does not really foster an experience for noticing them so many go wasted. It's all about gogogogo and super fast spammy action and streamlined systems and playsessions. Very little focus on immersion anymore.
---
no.
---
Mate we havent even entered phase 2 yet. R e l a x.
---
The pally bubble should work...
---
Again, no.
---
I found mine 7g in the AH, probably someone pricing mistake. Well, now I'm happily wearing it myself at 60.
---
Thought about selling it for profit but I already got the epic mount so might as well use it.
---
If you’re in *any* guild that is trying to progress, you should use LC. If you’re just going in for fun and to down a few bosses here and there, sure, free roll or DKP. If your goal is to progress on bosses though you should be using LC.
---
[Warlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh1dGAEbdIs)
---
As long as your healer is semi competent and knows you're gonna 2h tank then you can 2h tank untill you start raiding.
---
I think Rank 2 is actually more mana efficient when look at the damage to mana ratio, but the reason you use it is that it's cheap, yes. They can't stealth while inside flare or and it breaks stealth if they enter it.
---
&gt;force
---
I don't think you know how petitions work.
---
It's SJW shit to support democracy? huh, TIL.
---
levels 12 - 25 are usually the hardest for solo PvE. You haven't gotten all the tools your class gets yet, and there's a significant ramp up in difficulty when you exit the starting zones.
---
Basically the mage at those levels should take care to pull from max range, and 1 mob at a time. If you accidentally pull too many mobs, you will die, as you lack the escape tools at those levels.
---
Battle groups where introduced in 1.12 patch June 05.  First battleground was launched in 1.5 Aug 06.
---
I mean if you both are killing the same mobs you know whats the invite about. There is no reason to compete for kill quests
---
I assume you have 5/5 in tactical mastery?  Bloodrage - charge - sweeping strikes - berserk stance - berserk rage - whirlwind- defensive stance and spam Sunder while using Revenge every time it\`s available. Keep battle and demo up if you have extra rage. Pay attention to enemy casters so that youknow when to interrupt with shield bash. If your taunt is on CD and you need another one - you have Mocking blow in balanced stance.\\
---
Oh, and get shield spikes from a blacksmith.  
---
Equipment advice: do your lvl 20 class questline for a really good tanking chest. After you complete it - several more quests open up, including the one for a helmet (you probably don't have one yet).  When you\`re near lvl 40 - run RFD until you\`ve got plate chest from the 1st boss.
---
Thanks for the swift replies! Redridge it is.
---
not accepting though does mean you are a selfish jerk, just said so yourself :)
---
Pedantic idiot right here, yikes.
---
Most buffs have a visible and invisible ID. If the invisible ID says "this is for shadow resistance" then you'll end up only with the strongest one cast on you. If they invisible ID says "priest resistance buff" and the paladin one says "paladin shadow resistance buff" you're good. But the only way to know if something has that same invisible ID is to try it. 
---
You can see the same sort of interaction with debuffs, where some that are very similar overwrite like Demo Roar and Demo Shout. But you also see it in very "different" buffs like some armor reducing item procs have the same id as Druid Faerie Fire, even though they are applied with physical hits and Faerie Fire is a spell....
---
Players with special characters in their names are to be mocked.
---
It's at time like these that you wish for transmog.
---
I've been taking it way easier than I did in classic.  I do know a lot more about the game, but if I'm not feeling 100% into playing, then I log off and do other stuff.  Back in vanilla I felt the compulsion to level and had FOMO big time, wanting to see all the level 60 content.  Well, I've seen all the level 60 content and everything in between, so this time I have no compulsion to take the optimum path.  I've optimized the little things like carefully mapping out my talent progression, and I managed to get a mount at 43 by saving money and only buying leveling skills.  I know where to level and all that stuff, I just don't feel compelled to play every possible hour that I could play.
---
He doesn’t mean game time played. Just means he’s played on 30 different days. I’m around the same
---
Holy shit, Pepitos?!
---
3 out of 4 times if a mage is aoe grinding quest mobs and refuses to group I'll throw a casual /rude but that's it.
---
I will also enjoy myself and fear the mobs everywhere for a few minutes.
---
First few people were talking about why he could possible report OP so I was thinking it was meant kinda serious
---
Bruh what lol
---
What utility do they bring for this fight? I'm not familiar with the boss, but I guess windfury or posion totem?
---
Fuck off.
---
Got really lucky, actually got them in 2 weeks. We just did MC for the first time as a guild last week and first one dropped. Then this week second one dropped. Crazy.
---
And Dire Maul is not even full phase 2 lol. (just a part of it)
---
ty
---
Nah I’ll stay with the official server 
---
If I want to protest the China thing I rather do it properly and not by protesting blizzard who doesn’t really have anything to do with the actual issue
---
Not even close.
---
They have a few niche fights they're better for, but only marginally, and being crushable severely inhibits them throughout the course of progression.
---
I've never seen shit like this.  Y'all must be on one of those streamer servers.
---
Same here. I think without swing timers, hamstring kiting is just too hard to pull off, so it's not worth it.
---
Problem is you're taking up debuff slots to deal less damage than a full blue / green geared warror / rouge
---
God I miss Ivan memes. Thank you comrade.
---
Don't forget the improved thorns for extra threat

Floating Combat text

What I try to explain is, on retail, from Vanilla to Legion (and further) they've changed their way of coding to make it more easy and efficient and overhauled the graphics. Because they use the same engine now for both Classic and Retail, they can use of course the new graphics, but they'll need to adapt every Xpac (BC,LK) etc..to the new engine IF they want it exactly as it was for the release of said Xpac like they did with Classic. 
---
Today if you start from scratch on retail it's nowhere near the same experience as it was then.
---
Yeah, I feel that. I used to main hunter from end of vanilla when I started until cata, and things sure we're rough in the beginning
---
This has literally not happened to me in dozens of group ups
---
No attitude here, if people want a fast dungeon with less downtime I can't stop and buff everyone then sit for water on top of sitting for water after X amount of pulls.
---
 The buffs from pallys only last 5 minutes - that's a lot of up keep and they're not cheap when you do the whole team. On top of having to maintain aggro from people using AoE skills or attacking different targets. We don't get a taunt so my aggro = mana.
---
just guys bein' dudes
---
The turd Tirant
---
IMO Troll is the superior Elemental Shaman. Berserking is incredibly strong.
---
As /u/MWhighlander laid it out previously, regarding Troll as top Enhancement, but I think is even more relevant here:
---
&gt;The 43% haste for spell casting and attack speed is absolutely busted. It allows you as full enhance to spam 1 second lesser healing waves (with spell batching is pretty much impossible to stop) along with zerkkng brining down chain lightning to 1.5 cast speed matching that of elementals. Something no other race for enhance can do: cast lightning spells effectively in combat and have a higher attack speed for that inital melee attack out of the cast animation.
---
The whole shaman kit is designed to support warriors.
---
Windfury totem - nuff said    
---
Purge to remove shield that fuck up rage generation    
---
Poison dispel to remove Blind and slows    
---
Frost shock to help the warrior catch his targets when no charge/intercept     
---
Earth shock and Grounding totem to soak up/interrupt spells that are warriors' most threatening type of damage     
---
AoE slow/Str totem
---
made me exhale loudly... thank you for that
---
If it was truly MS &gt; OS, your raid leaders should have only accepted Tank (druid excluded) rolls on the bindings. If your guild is doing a guild-only run, and they feel like getting a rogue TF, that's up to them. But you guys had PuG tanks who are aiming for one of the best tanking weapons of all time in your group. So honestly, pretty shitty leadership on the part of whoever ran the thing - I imagine they only stated "MS&gt;OS" during the raid, and when the bindings happened to drop they just allowed rogues and furies to roll in a semi-rushed manner. I also imagine that, had the tanks known that bindings were going to be offered up to rogues (and fury warrs it seems like), they would not have joined your group.
---
Overall nothing done wrong on your part, but imo your raid leadership is pretty bad if they are willing to let those go to basically any melee.
---
Deadmaul! It's deadmaul
---
Auctionator or Auctioneer
---
Man, I mean wow, a third of comments in this whole thread is you hating on druids. Who hurt you?
---
I am only making money from mining mainly and I am about to hit 400 gold. Level 58. My repairs vary from run to run, 1-5g my vendor/auction from things in gather along the way usually covers that or more. Not sure what you could do different than maybe try and look for a demand in the market that's not being met, if fap potions aren't selling for much then look for something that does. I know for a fact on my server elemental fire and greater fire resists potions are in super high demand right now and therefore price is way up.
---
Do you mind posting this macro for people not in the know?
---
I just made a warrior a few days back with the sole intention of tanking, because I was tired of not getting groups with my rogue. Hell, I couldn't find groups with my priest, though it may be a product of the time of day I get to play, too.
---
&gt; with a party of six
---
A party has five people maximum. Everything above that is a raid. Since this *is* a raid quest, I am guessing that *maybe* "loot eligibility" is computed on per-group participation, i.e. if you were the only player in your raid group, and did the healing, this could ostensibly be a reasonable explanation as to why it happened.
---
Not saying it is working as intended, just trying to suss out how other can potentially work around this, e.g. by not having the healer alone in a group.
---
I’m loving my priest grind, lvl 50 now!
---
* If healer/you are reasonable levels for the instance then use 2H weapon to tank in defensive stance. But have a macro that will switch you to shield/1h in case of big pulls or other emergencies.
---
* If a priest enjoys putting shields on you other than in an emergency, then click off the shield so you retain your rage income from taking damage. also tell the priest to use shield only as a last resort
---
* you don't necessarily need to tank all the mobs, often it's acceptable to tank all but one, and let the dpsers use their stun or frost nova or whatever as they burst it down
---
* if ranged mobs are near a group you don't want to aggro, fire your gun at the ranged mob, then run round a corner to avoid Line-of-sight so the ranged mob comes running. While you wait for it to get you, use bloodrage and battle shout which generates a bit of threat which should help you keep aggro.
---
* You can bind the raid target icons to numbers on the numpad if you want to quickly mark targets
---
* on the subject of marking targets, communication is key
---
* on the subject of communication being key, if you don't know a dungeon, don't feel as if you have to lead it, you can ask someone else in the group to tell you where to go
---
* if you are tanking multiple mobs, tab between them and do sunder/revenge on them. This is enough to stop them losing aggro to the healer. Your other challenge is to keep aggro on the mob they DPS are attacking, so you might want to mark one of them with a skull and apply extra sunders to it. Or, as I said earlier, maybe its ok if there's one mob you don't tag.
---
* sometimes dpsers are retarded and there's nothing you can do to hold aggro against them - if you don't take damage from mobs you don't get much rage and you can't hold aggro. Don't sweat it when this happens.
---
* always keep an eye on your healer's mana bar. It depends a bit on the healer, but it doesn't need to be 100% full before you pull the next mob, particularly if they're drinking.
---
* it costs a lot of mana for healers/mages/druids to buff the group. If you were about to pull and you hear them buffing, maybe don't pull until they've drank.
---
Thousand Needles cats have 1.2 attack speed. Does 0.2 attack speed difference is so crucial that you've spend your 3 days? I don't think so.
---
*I'd trade your gear back, but it's BoP. I'm just gonna DE it.*
---
This is interesting.. I haven't heard of this issue with people getting reported, and the general chat/trade/LFG gets really raunchy and everyone (that I see) is decent with each other when it comes to game etiquette.  I wonder if maybe it's only a problem in certain servers.
---
He would have to be literally signed in for every waking hour since launch minus 7 hours a day for sleep.
---
Supporting blizzard huh?
---
Classic plus would obviously be sweet,  and everyone screaming "nO cHaNgEs evvvvvaaaarrr" like blizz is going to leave classic on the post naxx patch forever is obviously incredibly smooth brained,  but take a step back and look at this whole post. This is a really bad post.
---
Selfish in the choosing to play the game the way they want to kind of way, sure.
---
But not in the negative way most people use the term selfish.
---
It's not true. It does apply threat, it's just not effective to spam because demo threat generated is very low.
---
because of Weapon Skill and Defense Rating, Your max Weapon (without racials or gear) is 5xLevel. If you are fighting something one level higher than you its defense is 5xits level. thats like a 3 or 4% chance to miss/dodge/parry right there. at 3 levels difference its a 10% or so chance to miss/dodge/parry just from that difference, not counting any other effects. 
---
warriors are heavily reliant on weapon dps which only counts if you get the hit... so you don't notice the thousands of hits you get in a row you only remember the times when you miss 3 in a row and almost or actually die.
---
Underrated
---
They’re there, but retail is about sitting in a crowded town and queuing rather that traversing the works. So content is forgotten or goes unseen.
---
There's an argument to go with the warrior simply so that you don't have 2 DPS classes at 60 to give yourself a bit of utility. I've got a healer main at 60 and im levelling a DPS so I can switch between the two. Will do a tank class after that.
---
Farm high level humanoids.  Sell drops.
---
Deadwind pass ogres is a great spot you can get non-stop solo pulls.
---
Doesn't matter though, DM is the first good warrior farm and is here in less than a week.
---
Oh, no, sweaty. 
---
I just don't like people with zero idea what they're talking about spouting pure bullshit.
---
The rule excuse is bullshit. It didn't even contain the word politics in it. It literally says "Blizzard's sole discrection". They could ban anyone for anything they want. They didn't have to enforce the rule at all because  it doesn't mean anything. They could have at least given him a slap on the wrist and put out a statement saying they won't allow any more political statements (even though they are happy to support LGBT now that it makes them a profit). Instead, they went full nuclear on the guy in a blatant effort to appease China.
---
One guy reported me for ‘being gay’, when I used the /dance emote.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing...
---
It's been known that you need to deal damage to the dragons in order to get credit, but when we did it, the healers just tossed a rank one spell or whatever. I tagged all of them with a 20-damage shock and had no problems. Seems like there might be a bug in whatever code determines whether or not you "contributed." It's a silly concept given that a whole third of the class structure is designed to have no reason to deal damage to mobs, but I guess that's the way it was back then.
---
implying 30 wow subs a month is *instane* money
---
I'm 60 on my paladin in classic and I've done protection mainly and Salvation on the party is absolutely necessary if you want to tank in my experience
---
Yeah, I can google „warrior bis list” trust me. I was wondering if someone has a profesionall theorycrafting spreadsheet showing how much value has that additional 7 weapon skill in comparison to 2% hit from devil set. All the bis lists from the internet have 0 comments on why certain gear is better than other.
---
Incendius?
---
Based on the OP I assumed the chasers were Alliance, in which case no Shamans.
---
My brother asked me to come back again when him and a bunch of his co workers started playing. So I hopped back into azeroth. Started a Hunter cuz i never played one before. A ton of his friends were playing. Now his friends went their own way and my brother and I leveled together since I don't know his friends but I've talked to a bunch of them and they are all very nice. Now what started off as a good dozen people have dwindled to like 4 people. My brother, 2 of his friends and me. I know me and my brother will make it to 60 since we've played vanilla and the grind doesn't bother us. A lot of people do not have the time or the will to grind to 60 so that is why they quit most the time.
---
That's what makes the game good; it incentivizes you to group.
---
Dude that’s crazy.  What dungeons are you running and what’s your cost?
---
&gt;everyone is rolling a warrior this time around, and all of them refuse to tank.
---
Tanking is just not nice. Whenever the DPS gets aggro, they blame you, and you often get essential weapons ninja'd from underneath you by the hunter just tagging along.
---
If people were more friendly to the tanks, they'd have less trouble finding one. I play a tank, and everyone I group with who isn't nice gets on my ignorelist.
---
Maintain buffs and aggro = mana
---
The buffs are short duration (5mins).
---
Either the DPS need to learn to wait for me to maintain aggro so I don't need to waste so much mana on spamming my AoE or they need to slow down and let me drink every couple pulls because now I have to drink due to aggro + buffs.
---
Demo shout is good as initial @some kind of@ aggro, so heal doesnt pull mobs from you instantly (for those who still doesnt know - blizz nerfed demo shout spam). 
---
Best way to maintain aggro - marks. You cant do much if people starting AOE instantlly. So best way is - tab targeting.
---
People shouldn't join runs if they don't agree with the loot rules.
---
Conny.
---
This is 100% a reference to the movie “Us” by Jordan Peele. Great movie!
---
Yeah back in 08/09 it took a decently large sum of justice badges from heroics in order to get a single character kitted out
---
I feel bad for the people who take this so seriously that they feel the need to be dicks to other people.  I'm just over here having a blast.
---
Improved thorns + T1 3set bonus makes tanks so happy. I'll keep 3 T1 pieces in my bags forever.
---
&gt; I can google 
---
They you should have been able to find an awnser to your question because this was awnsered 14 years agon , and shitloads of sites has several post about this once again
---
Did someone say
---
Grounding totem catches the sleep spell he casts every 30 sec or so
---
Little column A, little column B.
---
Level them both to 30, there just aren't many differences at level 15 specially the classes that have spells and hit things. Yyou've got to try out the druid class abilities like bear/cat into caster form to heal and then back into bear/cat and see if you like swithcing through a lot of abilities.
---
I am almost Revered with SW now (currently at lvl 35)...I still have a long way until exalted but it's something :).
---
No one cares if they take tank gear when they're tanking. Other DPS wars get pissed if they roll on DPS gear. You have to clear that up with the group ahead of time.
---
Like worshipping the devil kind.
---
You're a priest.
---
I was questing in barrens doing the dwarf gather bomb materials quest at level 28. This 23 hunter was also there struggling. I was in a group forming an rfk run. He kept asking for an invite to do the quest together. But it's a gathering quest so not only would he have made me take longer he wouldn't provide any assistance that I needed essentially leaching off of me. But he just kept asking for an invite and got upset that I wouldn't help. He didnt report me but it was a similar experience.
---
I giggled right away when i had my first drop, knowing the ref. 
---
Also remember sorting the gray stuff in my bags to make room for more barrels as they are far more valued than any other grey in that area. So that's why you thought it was 50s or something, actually it was more valuable than other
---
Yeah, let me explain that one. A lot of party members are either imptient or are trying to runs dungeons as if it were retail. Many people will begin dpsing within the same second of a tank engaging. 
---
When that happens, usually all but 1 or 2 mobs will peel off the tank, leaving him rage starved (when 1h tanking, almost all your rage is gonna come from taking damage not dealing it with your puny dps wep).
---
But if you equip a 2H, you're going to keep up a bit better because you'll have way more rage to hold aggro with AND your aoe will do more damage so you can initially hold the pack better.
---
Is it better for a mob to be attacking your 2h tank then for the mob to be attacking your warlock and druid while your tank twiddles his thumbs with a shield equipped.
---
I thought he said poo elemental.
---
Why are you still playing? You dont care that an american company is openly censoring peoples freedom of speech?

i saw a shaman chain lightning kill three full-health alliance dudes while they were talking to the questgivers in Nesingwary's camp... That was epic...
---
Use the Threadplates-Addon. It shows enemy-nameplates as green, yellow or red depending on whether you have aggro or not and it shows how many stacks of sunder each mob has and whether they are affected by demo-shout.
---
Skill-Priority while tanking is: Revenge &gt; Sunder-Armor &gt; Heroic-Strike
---
Use Demo-Shout on AoE encounters. Use Shield-Block when you feel you got enough threat and/or can spare the extra-rage.
---
nice blog
---
Ok so if its not at Blizzard discretion who the fucks discretion should it be at? Or should their be a massive book of all acts banned on stage? 
---
Theres no way to make a rule like that and NOT have it be vague / up to the decision of the company hosting the event. Which is why you CHECK BEFORE YOU GO ON STAGE.
---
Go on - how would YOU word that rule to avoid potential embarrassment for your company then. Or would you allow anyone on stage to say anything?
---
I meant for max level PvP. Also you often wouldn't use serpent sting in PvP because it breaks CC and for mana users it's usually better to use viper sting.
---
Did you just misspelled your name?

Represent!  I don't do quests and just grind mobs.  I always get invites for groups and decline them.  I just send them a whisper telling them "I'm just here grinding for XP, not doing a quest.  But thanks for the invite!" and it's always either been followed by "No worries!  Good luck!" or silence.  Seems like we have a pretty awesome server!  Everyone I've met has been super friendly so far!
---
Mages and casters in general drink after every pull or two, so effing buff your team. It'll also help with dealing with the packs anyway.
---
no i mean those people wanted your help and you selfishly told them to no that you are more worried about yourself, its a shit thing to do either way :)
---
interesting, doesn't do it for me. Maybe some other setting is also involved.
---
Runecloth is nice (being a tailor). I'll be back to finish after I exalt a rep that actually has value right now such as Argent Dawn.
---
I was also keyboard turning back in the days. Doesn't mean I'm going to go full \#nochanges
---
They will be crying when their bg queues are 3 hours, and then they get steamrolled by the one alliance gm grinding premade, that just does nonstop bg after bg.
---
Ironic that the place to pvp will be on the "worse" pvp side.

I couldn't, I don't like when someone starts to judge me without a proper reason and research and i wanted to stand for myself.

and i'm the one who gets downvotes on my comments lol.  This subreddit is bitter a bit

I love it.  I have 3 mid-20's characters at the moment, so I haven't seen mages AoE grinding yet, but I'll be sure to do that if I do!
---
Yes, you are wrong. It's a behavioral definitional. You can't measure "internal benefit" and moreover it would be meaningless.
---
That was the problem I tried to point out.
---
You're defining altruism as something impossible and then saying it doesn't exist.
---
I disagree; as someone who started shortly before LK and heirlooms were released, and for a long time only knew the items as heirlooms, I get excited and think it’s SO cool to see (players use) the original versions of these renowned items. 
---
I was so excited to get Thrash Blade precisely because my retail characters years ago had it as an heirloom.
---
You should start a youtube channel - "how to make 6.4k gold with mining and herb" I've made a good 500g-600g with it by now.  I was just commenting on how it's much more annoying to level that one of those and skinning.

My favorite way to assert dominance is to buff other druids with improved thorns and mark.
---
You need to communicate with your team as the tank. I'm level 47 right now and I mostly try to heal dungeons, but tank every once in a while. I usually just mark a skull, hit it with a JoR and drop max rank consecration, then only use SoW from then on out and rank 1 consecration to keep threat held. Combined with retribution aura that's usually good enough to hold threat, I'd imagine even easier if actually tank specced and using blessing of sanc. This usually lets me tank without being oom after every single pull because that's miserable.
---
I am doing the research for a few days already and the only official info gives raw bonus values of certain weaponskill thresholds. Seriously, if you have something interesting to say, go on. If you came to blow your steam, please, walk yourself out.
---
Yeah, but that is the thing, discrimination as it was defined is just recognizing the differences exist. Racism should be the word to describe someone treating someone different based on their race, but discrimination has been coopted to also mean that by how it has been contextualized. Least that is what I have encountered, even trying to address differences is seen as a racist act by many people. I wasn't trying to suggest racism itself wasn't shameful, as it certainly is, I just felt it was likely r/crUMuftestan meant discrimination (IE recognizing differences, not the bastardized usage equivalent to racism) when he said said racism. Everything has been so obfuscated by rhetoric at this point it is incredibly hard to even discuss the issue clearly. "But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought".
---
Oh wow, look another 15 year old who doesn't know shit. Stop begging, it's against the rules. Some people are not addicted to gaming and don't care about the game. I have other things I enjoy as well. I'd rather delete it all than give other players shit, cause I do not support the actions of blizzard, so nor do I support the players.

---
Westfall at 14 is suicide. Every guide worth it's salt takes you to darkshore after doing elwynn to come back to Westfall at 16.
---
Taking more damage and I also a drawback. You either keep aggro and die quicker and the healer has less mana, or you don't keep aggro and then rest dies.
---
I had the exact same issue. Killed chronalis twice, healing both times, unable to loot.
---
Formed a new group and tanked that asshole and got my head.
---
I don't know why these guys specifically have this issue, but it's real.
---
You got silenced by players that are tired of hearing all the fake people whining about this, but doing nothing about the real tragedy happening over there. But of course, to you conspiracy theorists it's all Chinese people doing this to you. It's ok. I know the tinfoil can be a bit tight, but you do you.
---
I was assuming that if I only had 1 death, so would the ones chasing me.
---
I think it'd be rude not to offer to pay a guild member who is helping you though. At least offer 10g considering the typical fee another lock would charge might be as high as 50g
---
Few and far between sadly

We're not trying to bang you, you won't catch anything by accepting an invite I promise

Unless you are the GM or his irl friend you shouldent promote LC. Any guild can clear all content up to bwl without much thought.

Omg i need to see this, bur my fav is the one in Hinterlands that fishes all day.

really? im going to try it mate thanks

Haha you are so right. Brb. LFM UBRS Literally everything worth going for is on reserve. Also personal loot ruined retail! pst.
---
Swifty's macro is:
---
/castsequence reset=10 Sweeping Strikes, Berserker Stance, Berserker Rage, Whirlwind, Battle Stance, Thunder Clap   
---
I also use this charge macro for extra rage:
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/cast Charge  
---
/use \[combat\] Bloodrage
---
This macro uses charge first and then if you press the charge button again uses bloodrage. It will only use bloodrage if you're in combat to save wasting it if you're out of charge range.
---
I really prefer Archivist Cape with healing on it, also coming with mp5. Don't see any other cape topping that off anytime soon.
---
yes it's correct that Shield slam and revenge do more threat than sunder, but they both have cooldowns so you can't spam them. So it's kind of correct to say that you spam sunder - but it would be a mistake for anyone to think that's all you do.
---
So shield slam always on cd, revenge every time it comes up, then sunder spam until one of those comes back up, making sure you always have the rage available for shield slam. If you can't get rid of all your rage quickly enough by doing this then you can also queue up a heroic strike (or cleave if multiple mobs).
---
Also if more than 1 mob, TC I think is better than sunder in terms of threat per rage.
---
Tank dungeons in trade for the Rightous Orbs in strat works.
---
aw man you had to break our streak....
---
Normally what happens is I pull 1-2 mobs and can do this for 3-4 pulls pending no one does something stupid or a mob runs into another group. 
---
Problem is people AoE when the fight starts. Or you have a warrior that charges an enemy. Always funny when the war or a pet taunts. I'm like GG lol
---
I’d take a point out of Supp or Imp Drain Life for Amp Curse rather than range.
---
Also yeah, better off going into destro after getting Dark Pact so when you do dungeons your shadow bolt dps isn’t terrible.
---
One of my favorite things to do is MC alliance off of boats

---
Considering that the main reason people bid is to get auctions at an extreme profit that the poster forgot to put a high price on, I don't have an issue with it.
---
And the comparison to real life auctions doesn't really hold up, because real life auctions are usually for singular/limited numbers of items of semi-significant value, therefore more care is taken in posting them. Compared to low bid prices being that someone accidentally forgot a zero or two in-game.
---
Not a surprise, considering that Horde players have assaulted Alliance players at Blizzcon in the past.

Just the Horde player mentality, I guess.

 A decent farm for horde is shadowfang keep. Not only are the boes from there insanely good for twinking, but the gold per hour (clear time and vendor time included) is around 15-20 raw gold per hour. Most low level dungeons with humanoid mobs are pretty decent for raw gold if you have the gear to solo them. I'd do some research on it, lots of very decent raw gold farming can be done.
---
Bats in EPL drop items worth a lot too, just vendorable greys like evil bat eye, bat wings.
---
Scorpids drop a lot of decent grey vendorables too and glowing scorpid blood.
---
Golden pearl farming is another very lucrative (but kinda time consuming and rng heavy) farm.
---
dungeon spamming as a tank is also incredibly good gold per hour if your group is good.
---
There's honestly a lot of ways to make gold in wow, and a lot of them can be uncontested in instances without using the AH.
---
I personally play a rogue and pickpocket brd, paid for my epic mount, my devilsaur set, engineering, and all the trinkets that come with it. just gotta find that farm that works for you and do it for a day or two. Kinda mind numbing, but the payout is worth it in the end.
---
This is a very good question. There was streamers on alliance side and they weren't lagging that much. But yeah serv was totaly dying at this moment
---
People play warriors, mages and priests because they are much better designed for their role than any hybrid. A "support" is useless when there is no need for one. What's the point of a healer who can't heal as well as a priest? And this isn't about meters and numbers. "Pure" classes have straight up more &amp; better spells to excel in their role.
---
The situations where you get value out of being a hybrid are few and far between. In a normal run there is no need for an additional, inferior tank or an additional, inferior healer.
---
Back then, people chose their class mostly from a gut-feeling or a first impression. Nowadays they have the advantage of knowing *how* the classes play and what they are able to do at max-level. Consequently, more people picked the more "well-designed" classes, whereas hybrids are played mostly because people like the game-feel of the class. This is also why almost every melee on Alliance is human, most mages are gnomes and most hunters on the Horde side are trolls.
---
Class- and race-imbalances are so noticeable in Classic that many people don't want to handicap themselves just to go against the flow.

There is a common factor in all of his bad experiences.
---
I put sal on healers and any DPS that seems to like to go crazy. Outside of that I don't maintain other buffs as that's not my priority.
---
Which addon are you using for stddev of market price?
---
thanks, one sane comment in here.
---
Ohh I trust in Blizzard to fix this by the time it actually is very necessary to be fixed.
---
While I often times didn't trust in Blizzard - they usually always delivered - at least to some extent. 
---
We might not be completely without lag but I'm sure they will find a way to reduce it to a bearable Level. 
---
You can't expect too much from them. You have to find a way to be happy with things being OK. Because that is that we will get. It will be OK
---
I rerolled to Druid with my shaman only at 51 and 8 days 12 hours played. With absolutely no regrets, I am loving it, and the time invested on my Shaman doesn't even feel wasted because it's still there, and will still be relevant if I ever decide to play it.  
---
My friend had a 57 Hunter and he was back and forth between going rogue or not, and I told him he had nothing to lose at all, it will still be there and relevant if you want to re-roll. So he did, to UD rogue. He said he's having the most fun he's had in 15 years.
---
You're a priest, so you have levitate.  Imagine all the high places you could go, then using Levitate to float down onto a distant lower area that is still some distance from the ground.
---
Someone offered the example of floating from Silithus cliffs into Ungoro Crater.  That's a good one.
---
...for now :)
---
That kinda reinforces my point
---
This the "normal" frames are terrible
---
I was so happy back in the day when I won the need roll in my group.... As a hunter...
---
Hunters usually have to be reminded to turn off growl, but a warrior taunting? Can't say I've experienced that lol I can't imagine a dps warrior using taunt, I hope that doesn't happen to often for you that sounds terrible.
---
If somethings happens by accident or pure luck 2 times in a very short time, is not called a trend, thats is not the meaning of the word.
---
This is looking like extreme luck.

Either English keyboards are stupid or the people, not both. I don't know how visible accents are on qwerty keyboards and I'm too lazy to Google it. If there actually is a dedicated button for à á â accents then yes, people are stupid for not knowing about them

---
Wrong, mp5 is often superior until you have 3 T2, and even then, it's not so easy to say.
---
You only have 15% of spiritregen infight, 30% with 3 T2 (can only get that at P3).
---
That is so cool! It’s even related to magma/lava, it’s so good. Check this one out too: http://www.wowhead.com/item=137098/zoldyck-family-training-shackles
---
Well if I remember correctly, you end up getting the riding skill with the completion of this quest. So after your done you can go and buy a horse or ram for less than 100g I believe after raising your cost overall but still half of what epic riding skill costs. Good point about PVP though, Also a pain if you go OOM and have to wait for the 5s rule before mounting.
---
You are the tank
---
You decide on the speed
---
If they want to go faster than you let them die
---
Everytime i ran into a mage aoe farming i would whisper them and ask for group for specific quest.  I would sit back and let him do his thing, loot my quest items say thanks and move on.  This happened 4 times while leveling 1-60. My experience might be rare, or maybe its just because all of the coolest, nicest people play on my server.  Dunno.
---
I leveled with a priest too. If you want to play normally - go shadow. But since my priest is lazy semi-afk ass i made her go holy-disc so i easily aoe down packs like 6 mobs while questing whle she just heals me.
---
I'm not home right now but I can guarantee you that casting buffs on a full party costs less than 600 mana per 5 minutes, sorry but your stance on buffing is just wrong bro, buff your party
---
Yes, DS is also slightly better in PVE I believe.
---
It seems you didn't really understand what I wrote, I'm not advocating the use of hybrid dps at all , if you read the fine print you will see I gave this exact example of how hybrid dps are subpar compared to true dps classes.
---
Put 3 points into improved imp, and on the destruction tree pit 2 points into the impa fireball- he will do 35% of your damage against single targets. Get your cooking up and have stacks of food to eat.
---
Am I a dick for needing on Blackstone Ring against a warrior? I'm a rogue and I thought it was pre bis but I looked it up after and I guess it isn't.
---
I saw [this pic](https://imgur.com/FVdSvCD) and now I want to reroll as tank. They're so hard to find
---
I don't think I'd have the patience to level a warrior, so I'm thinking to make an tauren druid
---
How bad are they compared to warrior tanks? Will I get the same kind of whispers?
---
That changes at higher levels.
---
When I play my 32 mage I don't need to drink every 1-2 pulls. And no I won't effing buff my team. People get sal if I believe they need it. Other buffs are if I remember or have mana. I didn't join a team to be a buffer and tank. If I wanted to maintain buffs I would spec holy and be a healer.
---
well the rank4 is the highest rank with a faster cast time. so no.
---
also u get more from your spelldamage the longer the cast is you are casting. frostbolt (2.5s) only gets 80% while fireball gets 100%. 2.1s frostbolt would get less then the 2.5s ones
---
Yeah, so in other words a person that gets paid to play the game is targeting gold...
---
Yeah, took me hours to farm the linen cloth
---
I never said that I didn’t group with people. Point in fact I said that I usually do. All I said was there’s nothing wrong if someone chooses not to group up, because they have the right to play the game they want to. 
---
If you want to interpret someone declining an invitation that they are under no obligation to accept as them being a selfish prick, that says a whole lot more about who you are as a person than them.
---
And the level of pettiness you’re stooping to at this point with the childish insults just confirms that assessment.
---
You can level a hunter alt to 60 in a few days played, which is the easiest way to do it.

---
No OP is correct.  You will get the mana from drinking while in combat but all health regen from food will stop while in combat. I thought it was bugged too but don't know what's correct.
---
Spirit mana regen ticks every 2s. If you've cast a spell in the last 5s, you get zero of that regen by default. This is often called "in combat" or "while casting" state. Talents (meditation for 15%), buffs (innervate for 100%, with +400% regen), and items (T2 set bonus I think) can modify this. Priest mana regen is roughly spirit/4, so 8 spirit is 1 mana per second. Items that give +Xmp5 give that full amount *while casting,* which makes them valuable in situations where you don't get much rest between casts.
---
Healing coefficients are based on a spell's cast time and effect duration. For spells, it's roughly base_cast_time/3.5 since 3.5 is the maximum cast time for all WoW spells. For effects, it's duration/15. For channeled... it's kinda arbitrary sometimes. Here is a comprehensive [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) of coefficients so you don't have to do the math and know exceptional cases; it's all just listed.
---
So this might sound crazy, but I played alliance back in the day and SW in particular was a lag hot spot, even on busy days without a huge battle in the city. IF wasn't half as bad during a raid, and Orgrimmar doesn't seem so bad now, maybe it's more spaced out with less npcs. Who knows. I do remember SW being bad for lag.
---
the only thing i dont understand is that you're lookin at what 60" or 70" display while sitting no more than 0.5m away from the screen... how can you see just about anything?
---
Oh, my bad!
---
Lots of quests, including the Onyxia attunement, the UBRS key, a lot of pre-BiS for various classes.
---
The dungeon itself gives really good xp
---
Alright hehe I see. Yea I mostly picked imp drain life up because there was nothing else to get. It just gives a marginal boost to your efficiency so you are definitely fine without it.
---
Regarding curse of exhaustion it’s mostly a value point. It does not work on princess, and actually Curse of Doom is more dps on her than CoA. There are plenty of youtube videos if you’re curious to learn more.
---
Skarm is awesome. I recommend anyone who is tanking both warrior and druid check out his channel.
---
It's not about soaking (bears can do this, but...), it's about bear MTing Patchwerk for increased threat (and therefore increased dps).
---
...misinformation...?
---
you dont. make a mage and farm with it.

From my experience I prefer ww over ravager. I killed Herod 20ish times to get ravager and it was fun for some time, but it procs very very often. It's ok if you have good  initial pull with whirlwind and then it procs but good luck if it procs right when you pull, have to wait 3 seconds for the 1st aoe hit, it generates no rage and low threat. Also when you tank/dps 1-3 targets, your white hits and whirlwind will do more damage and you have more control. So cancelling those procs every 10 seconds is annoying af.
---
33 Warrior here. What dungeons should I be doing tanking or DPSing for (Alliance if that matters)?
---
Also is there a quick reference guide to abbreviated names of Instances that match up what level you needs/should be to run it?
---
I'm normally in the LFG chat, and people say certain abbreviations and I can't remember what level you need to be to run them.
---
No joke, back in vanilla I had a boomkin tank scholomance one time. We cleared the whole dungeon so, it "worked".

Hello,

I am a prot warrior, and, as such, use 2H weapons for questing only. I currently possess the 3 following weapons, and was wondering which is best for my situation, considering I am an orc :

---
Do swamp of sorrows and badlands quests, and the other zones that end at 40, dustwallow maybe? After that just start spamming ZF.
---
&gt;This dude somehow managed to farm 1600g in a month 
---
It's not as hard as it seems, especially if you got 60 early on. I got 60 after like 20 days of the game being out. Had plenty of gold since I could farm devilsaurs somewhat freely the first week or so. So I bought a non starter faction mount, which set me back a total of 1,6k gold, then some BoEs and BiSs from the AH for my main as well as a skullflame shield and stockade pauldrons for my alt if I get around to leveling it (cost like 1k in total). Despite this  I have over 1k gold still.
---
I haven't "played" anything for the last 1-2w as I've understandably gotten a bit burnt out on the game, but I still have a 1k cash stack from just playing the AH a couple of times a day.
---
Can you not read?

No: orc rides wolf, orc rides kodo, orc rides wyvern (though i always cringe at that naming, those are manticores, not wyverns). Troll rides bat. Tauren rides nothing, tauren just smashes things with a big ass totem. Warcraft 3 gang represent.

Why are you jumping on an under informed bandwagon to demonize a company that enforced its breach of contract?
---
They lost. No need to feel bad.
---
If you want to fuel their fire, tell them you decided to re-roll a new rogue because you didnt like what race you picked.
---
Warriors,mages and priests are much better designed for their roles , for sure.
---
But what makes you think the others weren't? do you only judge someone/something at face value?
---
Let's say you're in a raid, since priests, mages and warriors are obviously superior why bother bringing other classes? why do we bring any other class?
---
When hunter's are considered the weakest "pure" dps class yet still have a spot in raids for the utility they bring what is this called? when shamans are brought in for their totems above all else what then ? same concept for pally buffs and most of the other classes, they each bring something that simple meters aren't reflecting, the impact of utility or "support" that each class brings to the table, something that isn't apparent on the damage meters.
---
I don't know why everyone keeps thinking im talking about hybrid dps classes in a dps setting, it's obviously not what I'm saying, the term "support" is mostly a utility-based thing that impacts a group beyond it's face value.
---
Why? I help Warriors, Druids, and Priests more than anybody because I like making friends with tanks and healers. Can't ignore them while questing then ask for their help with dungeons and raids.
---
I was dreaming of shadow priest. Switched back to my hunter at level 34. Best decision ever made... (for farming)
---
You’re a millennial. In general, anyone age 23-38 is considered a millennia, though the exact age range is a little wishy washy.

Do I, as an individual, take any meaningful action against the PRC? Of fucking course not! I'm a random internet user, I'm not going to be able to meaningfully harm one of the most powerful countries on earth in a meaningful way! Just because I lack the power to do something about it doesn't make it okay, nor does it mean the issue shouldn't be raised.
---
I'm on an RP server, and reporting for non-rp names is huge.  Blizzard rarely does anything with these reports.
---
When I first read this, that is what I assumed was happening.  Dude didn't had something like XXXLegolasXXX on an RP server.  The names are blocked out so hard to tell.
---
Why would you do anything but try to get rid of such an ugly mount?
---
This is the reason people don't roll tauren, the mount is so shit.
---
If you are raiding then Lohk'delar is BiS for PvP. Great top end damage and stamina with good dps stats plus no competition from non hunters.

Oo wow you sure showed him,  what a macho comment wow o wow

Fuck off.

Your pseudo-morality is just a way to mask your complete and utter lack of importance to the human race. Who matters more: a medic that saves lives and play WoW or a random-delusional-pseudo-hero-redditor that criticizes people on the internet over harmless hobies? It gets even worse, because you are most certainly doing this because you saw other people doing the same. You have done nothing to contribute to the Hong Kong situation, yet you feel like this is your chance to finally matter. Guess what? You don't matter.

Up to probably AQ40 it doesn't really matter if you are holy or shadow if you want to fill the healer spot.

You played by the rules, that were announce pre run. You abided like Everyone else and you happened to roll. Despite not being 60 you contributed to the run just like others did. Yours fair and square. Those who threatened you?

Game is fun and they aren't silencing anyone's freedom of speech. Yes, they did something shitty, but they definitely aren't keeping that person from saying what they want.
---
That GM have no idea what they are talking about. This have never been a issue in game and is clearly a bug lol.
---
Why are there so many incompetent GMs working at blizzard...
---
More like 42-43.
---
Possibly. I also believe that this is just a routine that the devs programed into this this area exclusively.
---
I'd gladly play the GOAT support class if it were available to the Alliance.
---
It gives dodge, armor, and crit. The main thing is the 1% crit for every 20 agi, which is actually a really good ratio. Note that enhance has talents that synergize with crits, such as flurry.
---
That's bad, ass.
---
You will be more of the backup healer if your spec is mainly shadow. Dungeons should be fine but raids especially fights with high damage your heals might not hit for much, but if the raid already has solid healing your extra wouldnt hurt.
---
Its not like your gonna be top of the DPS charts so may aswell keep people alive if you can help.

Not if you choose money making professions. I've made something like 3-4k gold in total and probably only 1k of that is actually farmed. Rest is from making things and selling on AH for profit.

---
It's a quest line
---
Use the improved imp with improved fireball, ruin, and nightfall and shadowburn. Basically the idea is to hit
---
The mob hard and he dies so quickly you don’t get hurt. This is also great for PVP. I open up with a shadowboltand the imp attack at max range, pit in my three dots, then use death coil, another shadowbolt, and either improved drain mana if he is almost dead or shadowburn to finish him off. Then life tap to regen mana and eat some food I cooked (every third mob or so). Dot and fear any adds. Basically you kill the first mob so quickly you can handle most situations.
---
Huh I love renew in dungeons. I barely use anything else, unless the tank is taking a beating, and an occasional shield on mage/lock if they pull aggro and inner focus+prayer if its off cooldown. Renew just scales so well with +healing and only takes 1 GCD.
---
I think for starters they just don't know whats to come from leadership, then after prepping to raid new rules appear. I've joined terrible guilds that seem good until the time comes to do guild things. These guilds tend to crumble fairly quickly. I've always thought GDKP was terrible system within a guild as well. Screwing over members just causes stress in a video game.

It got deleted automatically due to not adding a flair. As I said to some guy before, I made a post with a clear intention of starting a discussion on a certain topic. If you do not have anything relevant to say please, find another topic to unload your frustration

Not like that.. But most gaming companies wont even put things like this in 2019 with all the resources they have today and blizzard did this back then. Imagine the thought process lol “ i will have this water elemental beat the shit out of this campfire”

If there's alot of melee/pets in the group then battle shout works great. It's all dependant on how many it buffs.

All I can say is, best of luck to you and your progression. The guild is very transparent in everything we do, from loot to raid members attending the raids. As the leader of all raids and groups. Not once have I ever said we will only be taking 60s. I believe none of the class leaders have either. There are no favorites here, everything is and always will be based on contributions or final resort is a roll off. Thank you for your response it is clear to me you are Kadak. You lost your roll for the raid spot to khronix fair and square. Last I checked. If two people rolled 1-100 and highest roll gets to stay in the raid. And your number is lower, you lose that spot. But maybe for some that is unfair and we must resort to reddit. I don’t use reddit. But I, as a diplomatic person, brought it up for discussion when a guild member mentioned this reddit post. And as a person of responsibility talked to the guild about how this person should talk to me to settle issues. At that time, I believe you were on your alt(Since we know who you are now) Decided not to talk it out and just sat there ease dropping pretending not to be there. Says a lot about your character. 
---
Again, best of luck on your classic wow journey sir.(you should start your own guild with your own rules so you get hurt) No hard feelings, some styles just don’t fit well with others.
---
Axe, even if you weren't an orc.  The slower speed and higher average damage per strike will enable all your attacks to hit harder and generate more rage.  Toss in your racial and its even better.
---
Definitely agree with that, if a warrior wants to taunt a mob off me theres no way I'm going to waste my mana trying to grab it back.
---
Not sure if you can conplete the sword pre-60 but if you can you should stay 59 and make it a twink.
---
Wow
---
Idk why but I feel like you just insulted me
---
Why is that lul
---
I’m in the same boat
---
If I boycotted every company with stupid political views I’d have to move to the forest like the unibomber.
---
all of those reasons fall under motivation for "absolutely no interest in ever playing again". Where as the OP is wondering why people cold turkey Classic instead of you know just playing in moderation? 
---
And the answer is FOMO probably, people understand themselves well enough to know they wouldn't be happy with their accomplishments unless they were just as advanced in the game as the twitch streamers that play 14 hours a day minimum.
---
Give it time, in a couple months they might be interested in resubing just for a month of battlegrounds. Who knows, just make sure you don't stress them out about it.

I'm 33 Warrior and for sword/board I'm still using the **CRUEL BARB**. I haven't really "tanked" since DM's.... You know with life and stuff I can't really feel comfortable (right now) committing to completing a dungeon.
---
Most of my friends are 10+ levels ahead of me so if I need a dungeon run they just run me through it.
---
I might have picked up a few 1-handers from quest but I feel like I've just vendored them....
---
Should i just pickup something from the AH? Or any recomnedations on quick/easy 1handers I should keep my eye out for?
---
How much rep do low level quests give at 60. 
---
Starter zone ones for example - I know its reduced, but im curious how far
---
Yes I do. I'm literally in thailand right now. I've given over a months of their salary to charities since I've been here.
---
Chapel is outside target range. But I guess rules weren’t specific about spawn location, I guessed it would be trade district
---
Glad to hear it.
---
And I don't care.  This is just the current outrage du jour.  Boycotting Blizzard for smart financial decisions is dumb.
---
I thought of calculating that, but by leaving it out I thought that it might be the same for both cases. But now that I think about it backstab complicates matters because of percentage increase in damage. It would effectively be +12 damage for backstab instead of +8. Still think windfury wins out by quite a bit.
---
This is fucked no way you can play this lol, all the more to you.
---
Perfect, thanks ! I'll sell the Barovian sword, but affectuously keep Destiny, I've been questing with it for a while now and... *sigh*
---
Pardon me I may have confused this weapon with some other. But haven't we seen a couple of pictures on here of guilds completing it already. Again I may have mixed the weapon up with some else.
---
Doesn't work on Classic sadly ! Phantis and Dreamstalker are leashed :(

If I was a pug, definitely wouldn't be mad at you. You'd be elevated to a god-tier meme and my favorite thing I've ever witnessed. If I was in your guild, I'm instantly gquitting after raid. Absolutely completely ridiculous to allow you to roll on a binding.

If I were you, a casual rogue being carried in a guild that obviously doesn't give a fuck about anything, fuck yes, keep the binding, stay in this guild no matter what and let them get you another. It's so fucking ridiculous. It's an opportunity of a lifetime, server first rogue Thunderfury, a meme that will never be forgotten.

I grinded out ~120g one night there at level 39.  Maybe 6-8 hours.  None of my fishing poles sold well, I sold maybe 3 for 2-3g on the neutral AH, vendored the rest.  It was all about the shellfish.
---
Tank with corpsemaker.
---
If you can get carried for WW go for it.  I still have the quest and its green.
---
At 37 armory drops ravager.  While slightly inferior to WW it is awesome for tanking trash as it is pretty easy to proc it.
---
Bonebiter is a nice axe and I wish I had taken it over the 1h sword but the difference is so minor as I head into Ulda and ZF I am not losing any sleep over it.
---
The other night our main healing preist was mad we masterlooted all the cloth to the mage, who CLEARLY had more dps. 
---
I cant believe these entitled healers thinking they deserve loot with out doing ANY damage.
---
I don't know shit yet you're the one who think can stop EVERYONE to stop playing Blizzard games. Like... You can't make this shit up, brilliant.
---
Btw, you're not deleting shit.
---
Quality is also relative to the level. A blue 33 might have more dps than a green 33 but it doesn't mean it will be better than a lvl 40 green. DPS can be way more important than str or agility if the difference is big enough.
---
You know why
---
Especially the venture co. mobs caused a lot of my deaths there. Very closely spaced, they run when they get low, ...
---
Yup. I remember a multiboxer in 5v5 arenas back in WotLK playing 5 ele shamans. It was fun.....for him.
---
Some have completed sulfuras. Thunderfury requires elementium ingots which can only be obtained in bwl (p3)
---
Like i said, yes.
---
He didn't say anything about pre-bis though. In retail you have 6 stat combinations you can have on any piece and they're shared among all slots except trinkets. Classic has all kinds of unique itemization. Might not be the best raiding gear, but it can still be fun to collect or level with.
---
Aren't you questing? you should be doing quests and seeing the zones and stuff.
---
Honestly if you don't enjoy that or dungeons while leveling, or pvp, then the end game isnt much different.
---
End game is all of those things but extracted and done repeatedly. If you don't like dungeons you wont like end game at all - but thats kind of just like saying 'you dont like wow' tbh, since you seem to hate all of it
---
I was in a 13 man raid group
---
I've been trying to get him to nap on me, but it seems like he likes it better whilst I'm standing up.
---
&gt;Corpsemaker comes from RFK 
---
Oh My bad, I'm so bad with instance names.
---
This is 99% photoshoped. I saw the original post and zoomed in. (it was a larger photo) You saw a rectangle around the font of the item which seemed like it had a noisefilter from photoshop on it.  
---
However, the most important indicator for a fake is the chat window! Whatever the height of the window is, afaik the controls are ALWAYS on the bottom line not at the top. So originally the "Tender Wolf Meat" was the last line in the window. The 3 other lines were photoshoped in it afterwards.
---
the way battle shout calculates threat is how many friendlies it buffs, the more targets the more threat, so if there are many FRIENDLY in range of battleshout its better threat.
---
Demo shout is a set amount of threat spread onto all enemy in range. its enough to keep threat off of healers but the larger the pack the worse at holding threat it is
---
Tsunamanmon?

I dont care if I get traction. I care about the people of hong kong. And I honestly dont give a fuck if 10000 people see this and 9,999 dont care. If even 1 cares... it matters
---
Yes I’m afraid of this too. And I’m 60 and already farming MC/Onyxia. I’m happy with BWL not releasing for another 3 months or something.
---
That's my battle cry.
---
I got into it with some guildies on this topic. Do you have a source for that? So far my sources have been community comments and a blue post from 2011. My argument is basically yours, If loot rolls are stated in chat GMs will overturn ninjas.
---
5/5 Spirit Tap and 5/5 Wand Specialisation are must haves during levelling. The rest is honestly up to you, but I would suggest going:
---
2/2 Improved Shadow Word: Pain - This will allow SW:P to tick for longer, allowing you to wand to finish off kills along with the extra ticks of the DoT. This saves Mana and makes you more efficient.
---
3/5 Shadow Focus - This will mean that you cannot miss on enemies the same level or lower than you. In terms of efficiency, you shouldn't be killing mobs higher level than you, so these three points are very worthwhile.
---
3/3 Improved Power Word: Shield - You can tank more hits before taking damage. Pretty self-explanatory.
---
2/2 Improved Power Word: Fortitude - Better buff is great for grouping, but more HP is always nice even solo.
---
1/1 Inner Focus - Great talent that you'll want to get used to having. Great 'Oh Shit' button. Use it to preserve Mana regen in the 5 second rule.
---
3/3 Meditation - Mana regen whilst casting. More efficiency. Self explanatory.
---
[It will look like this at 33.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05023013--50023)
---
From here you can literally put points wherever you want, since you will be respeccing at 40 in order to go [full Shadow](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/--5002325100511051). The next 5 levels will have you putting points back into Wand Specialisation. After that, I would personally go back down into Discipline to get Inner Focus. This will take you to 51. At this point, you can respec to heal dungeons and farm your pre-BiS.
---
This is essentially the blueprint that every Priest follows when levelling, with a few alterations depending on personal preference.
---
Curve the Bullet!
---
I like this theory and kudos for not just participating in the circlejerk.
---
Is there!?!? I'd love to turn on an option like this, do you remember what it is?
---
Here's a clip of me having 5 seconds delay on using FAP

Look at my keybinds 3-5 seconds in when I press FAP. 51 seconds left on clip when I press, 46seconds left when it finally goes off. And this is even before the fight happened.
---
If you’re going to respond you should do so intelligently; after actually reading what the other person wrote while also using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. 
---
Again, I never once said *I* decline invitations, just simply said people have the right to refuse and that doesn’t make them a bad person. Because again, people have the right to play a game *they pay for* the way they want to play it, and being forced to play it the way someone else wants them to makes that person the selfish one, not the person declining.

Even if you find an addon that works - keep in mind that the batching can mean your heal arrives too late and the target is dead. Frustrating as that is normally, with an addon telling you health should be up yet the tank dies would be doubly so.
---
Yeah, pretty much the same for me.
---
As a healer, solo questing, I didn't really have time to waste engaging others and they rarely engaged me in 1v1s or even 2v1s. However, if they were 3 or more, they'd suddenly grow a pair...
---
There was this one a time, a solo Warrior charged me as I was Mining, which I perfectly understood and was ok with. Just as I was finishing him up, a Mage jumped in and CSed me out of my Holy school and proceeded to kill me, now that the odds were in their favour.
---
I tracked both of them down, waiting for the Warrior to be out of combat and at full health to kill him 1v1, then almost doing the same to the Mage a few moments later, although he sheeped me and ran like the coward he is once I brought him down to 10% life.
---
Don't fuck with a Holy/Disc Priest...
---
Crazy how they had a shitload of other things to do and still took time for Details like this. 
---
Hell - if they didn't do this we might have had Caverns of Time in Classic xD
---
Is having no life and spending all day on Reddit one of them?
---
what do you spend your money on oh woke one?
---
It's shit even for pvp.
---
You're talking about an addon that ignores spell batching
---
Derp, meant server lol.
---
This is why they should have improved many aspects of the game ignoring the fools that wanted exactly what was WoW 15+ years ago. It's not fun to waste hours looking for people to try a dungeon. I started with an hunter but at lvl 41 after a lot of pvp I got tired of that shitty deadzone i hated so much in the past so i made a lock. Got the lock to 48 and i love it , it's so annoying to fight against one e now I fully grasp why. Got fishing and cooking to 300 so instead of selling it i decided to use it to level up my alchemy on the lvl 30 rogue that i have... yes i have lot of characters and that's why i'm not bored yet. I cant play the game like I used to, I get bored really fast and i believe that is way better to have more than one char so you can level up with bonus exp most of the time. We had around 25-30 people in my guild the first month, now I'm alone most of the time. I made an undead on another server where I got some friends still playing so maybe I'll end up there if I'm not tired of this game in a couple of weeks.
---
yes, they have good single target and their shadow weaving talent buffs warlock shadow damage
---
I'm just saying that there are also randomly generated bullshit items in classic.
---
Lets hope it works properly
---
I'm around that level and I tank with the 1h axe from RFK.

Good fishing video to watch.

I have played warrior at max level about 6days or less /played and so far i have edgemasters + epic mount and 200g in bank. I have only tanked dungeons for fury bis gear and mined some ores every now and then. Stratholme is excelent money if you can grab the boxes since they often have bunch of potions and stack of food / water and grey gear. So far im sitting at maybe 20 strat ud runs, few scholos and about 100 brd arena anger golem runs with some lbrs and ubrs mixed. Offtimes i complete quests as you can get anywhere between 3-5g per quest plus the quest reward. I heard that you can make easy money with dire maul jumpruns so you should check that. Fishing might be ok money if gear is issue. You could also try to sell tanking services but that might require good gear and perhaps a good healer
---
Better than being stuck on a crappy mount. Am currently buying runecloth to be a  cow on a wolf, cuz I wanna fit through doors.
---
&gt; need to have something going on a second monitor
---
This is crucial. Certain classes have it easier as well, letting you turn more of your attention to other things.
---
Mage ZF graveyard farm is an example. You have downtime between the pulls, and the blizzard cast duration is so long that you can browse reddit while DPSing mobs. I spend very little time actually playing the game while getting 50gph.
---
Agreed, I guess the difference is that's a very small % of items in classic compared to retail.
---
20% is the floor. The reduction starts at -20% at grey, then another -20% for each additional level you're over the quest, capping out at -80%. This is the same for kills and quests.

About the story, some streamers from the alliance decided to not let the horde to go at MC so this shit show happened but the serv wasn't able to handle it lol
---
How does tag xp work?
---
I was trying to help some friends level with my 60 hunter. So we went to some elite mobs 5 levels higher then them (lvl 30 mobs), they tag the mob, I kill and they would only get 50% of the XP. We confirmed xp values by having them solo the mob. 
---
Is there any way they will receive full xp if they tag and I kill?
---
Any good resources for endgame pve for rogues? Curious about how to utilize a swing timer, optimal cd usage, mixing weapon types.
---
Yeah he has moonfire on 4, and on 4 in every other acc is 
---
/assist maincharacter 
---
/cast moonfire
---
How is that possible? Fun? Hunter?
---
No, they didn't disable it.
---
The player fucked up and blames Blizzard. Try it yourself.
---
As a hunter? Just go farm. 4 hours to level and you are 58??? Thats great. That means you will be 60 in less then a week haha. Its taking me like 6-8 hours.
---
Lmao I've never had an experience like any of those you mentioned. Maybe this kind of stuff is more prevalent on US realms. Non of my friends had something that excessive happen to them. An argument about loot in a dungeon, sure. Nothing crazy like that tho.
---
Squeeze em’ you son of a bitch
---
In this phase? What would you use over it?
---
You realise I’m the alliance one right? The guy with the original name?

That's what /u/Mulum said, and he explained why that's the case.

That's not how it works
---
That's not how any of this works...
---
Aah shiet, my bad
---
same guy with 117 accs
---
Really far. I know when I did some starter zone quests at 20something the rep was like, 10 rep instead of the \~100 you got for doing it at-level.
---
I didnt brag. He asked.
---
It's Weapon Swing Timer.
---
Stand somewhere else please.
---
Instead of selling cats, hes giving citations
---
The smartphones are assembled in china, yes, but the raw resources are mostly from African mines.
---
Balancing an improv around pvp is part of the reason retail sucks now. Arenas added in tbc are the culprit.
---
Give up TF for a bit of spite, lmao no
---
Yeah it's hard to play with friends when you aren't able to stay right together.   I've told my buds to drop me a line when they gather a bunch of orange/red quests and I'll come boost them thru it, or I ran some friends through low level (RFC, WC) dungeons super quick and it actually gave htem pretty good xp provided they had all the quests ready. 
---
WC especially, you can get the 'kill the leaders' quest at level 10 or something and get the crescent staff, level 20 rare quest reward or the 1h sword.
---
Now use damn good arrows in it damn 😅
---
Its beneficial to have a typical number of healers because a lot of the clear time in MC is trash. We essentially never stop for mana so it makes things go quicker, the kill times are good enough so there isnt much demand to squeeze more dps out of the raid.
---
I was wondering when the "I pay for" comment would come into this, can you puhp pleassss take your retail attitude back to it. I never use to hear that phrase back in the day when we all had to work together in groups of 40 people. sad to be hearing it now.
---
OP being the real hero here.  Going to save me time later.  Thanks!
---
Is there any way to remove politics from my gaming?
---
Bait
---
Every PvP server is a horde server. The consequence of making a comically unbalanced game.
---
I don't even Salv them (Unless they're AoEing very strong despite my best efforts)
---
I let them get aggro and if they don't run to me and my AoE then they gone learn today.
---
Wait wait wait, wait about my buddy named Frôsted? That’s a pretty cool ice mage name
---
What's an Arena run of BRD?

Achieved plenty!

Farmed some gold, got several bubbles worth of xp, ganked some silly alliance, and had a nice time unwinding.

Gen X are born in the 80/90?
---
Depends if you are Horde or Alliance.
---
Thats not exactly a political issue per se. But no, I am not aware on blizzards stance on LGBT stuff. Can you direct me to a reasonably credible source on that subject?
---
Both?
---
just wait DM EAST and run it with a healer. Ull take gold shower, pun intended.
---
There's a quest that can be repeated that gives faction rep
---
Nice, it's looking like I might actually be able to afford it when I ding 60!
---
The hardcore players have been playing this version of the game for years. My guess is they wouldn't quit over BWL not being released quickly. They probably want Classic to last as long as possible.
---
He is probably talking in some existential sense where "good" and "evil" don't really exist and "justice" is childish human construct.
---
You're misguided if you think spamming Barrens chat is doing anything to help Hong Kong residents.
---
You base that claim off of what? Your gut feeling? The data available shows your wrong.

If you keep provoking GMs into banning you, they'll end up perma-banning you?
---
How many shades of dumb are you?
---
It was a hyppogryph that flies around in Ashenvale, forget the name. I don't AOE, I'm fire all the way.
---
"Oh no! Clumsy me, I was so focused on the tank, I didn't notice you dying... again"
---
Scarlet Monastery is your go-to in the 30s.
---
SMGY (Graveyard) do this until about 34.
---
SMLib (Library) do this until 37.
---
SMArm (Armory) do this until 39, or until you get all the gear you need off of Herod, who is lvl 40.
---
SMCath (Cathedral) you can do this until 44 or so, I think.
---
After that, you can jump into Zul'Farrak (ZF) without a problem.
---
I also recommend that you spam SM runs for gold/easy XP/fast groups. Last night there were 3+ groups looking for tanks for GY at the monastery, so go ahead and run over there and then spam in /1 General that you're looking for a group. I had to tank with my hunter pet last night if I wanted to get any XP at all and it sucked. The more tanks the better!
---
Frost novas shouldn’t be a concern you can simply sift out of them. As a Druid I have never died to a mage in PvP because we are the hard counter to nova blink combos and ice barrier falls in almost 2 solid hits.
---
looks real enough for the loot windows. they have different pixels and background graphics (its a little transparent), and the text pixels are different too, so it doesnt look like it is just copied and moved.
---
Meant when doing stuff like BRD, U-/LBRS. Haven't had a single 2h user so far. Some might switch back and forth a little though.
---
1/3^6 = 1/729
---
Where can I download the pally power add on??
---
&gt;I knew it was a new low pop server but I thought surely more people will be coming
---
well i also know of another occasion of it happening to a friend of a friend and three times is a different story.
---
How do I be an effective DPS in Dungeons? I'm a Warlock for reference.
---
I feel like my job is as simple as don't leave my pet on aggressive and don't randomly spam AoE to accidentally pull more than is necessary. Occasionally my DPS will peak pretty high and I'll pull aggro on one or two mobs, which is fine because I'm a Warlock and can easily survive until the mob either dies or the tank regains aggro on it.
---
Is downranking my shadowbolt really something I need to be doing? Or slowing my DPS rotation down a bit? Is taking aggro off the tank really much of a crime if nobody gets hurt for it? I always feel like a dumbass when I steal aggro, was wondering what it's like from the tanks perspective.
---
What does the Dragonscales go for on your server? Like 1.5g on mine.
---
Don’t sweat it, some people don’t get the concept of pvp. Nice vid, brought back memories.
---
It's a bug.  It's pretty clear it's a bug.  It's also a bug that's been in since Classic.  It's "just the way of it." 
---
Rather than putting a ticket in, wait the 10-15 minutes and kill the dude again.  Make sure you throw a few spells - it doesn't have to be much more than just tagging it - and you've got it. 
---
This isn't nearly as bad as the Gnomereggan bug for horde.  That one is crippling for feral druids.
---
Yes most of the data I’m finding is self surveyed. Do you know how blizz handled this in the past though? I’m curious if they ever rebalanced servers in vanilla
---
Based on your English skills I’m thinking you were still in diapers back in ‘04/‘05, so don’t even try and play the “back in Vanilla” card. 
---
You still refuse to address the fact that you trying to dictate how someone else should play the game is actually the selfish act in this scenario. 
---
Not to mention, refusing to group up in an isolated questing scenario has literally *zero* bearing on whether or not that person is helpful to others or not. You choosing to label a player as a “selfish prick” based on a single scenario is so small minded and childish.
---
All of my friends who said "I'm just going to take it easy this time around and enjoy it" have quit.  All of my hardcore friends are still playing thankfully.
---
THIS
---
IS
---
SPARTAAAAAA
---
Noone gives a shit can you stop this nonsense?
---
Damn this really triggered some folks....keep up the good work!
---
Nope, it was to get a quest item from a rare spawn in ashenvale, a hyppogryph (sp?). It only drops one, even if there's more than one person in the group.
---
Yes Dire Maul will change nearly all BiS lists.
---
Can't answer the other questions though.

Prices peak in the morning?  What’s the theory behind that?
---
Each point of Weapon Skill provides .04% increase to the following:
---
    Critical Strike
---
    Hit chance
---
I've been fairly disappointed with skinning on my server. I'm not a mage though doing AoE farming.
---
My server:  
---
Light 15-20c on the AH. Which is expected. (Vendor is 15c)
---
Medium: whatever 5-10c over vendor is. I forget the price.  
---
Heavy might as well vendor. Goes for like 1s60c. The AH posting and cut eats large chunks of profit.  
---
Thick has been good to me through LW'ing a chest to vendor for profit when it costs 6s50c or less. Ranges from 5s50c to 7s50c. I tend to sell on AH or in person when it hits that upper end and I have a bunch that I bought for cheaper.  
---
Rugged is basically worthless. Hangs around 50c-80c over vendor. But again AH post and cut eats a large portion of potential profit.
---
Things like war bear, chimera, panther skins just hardly sell at all so their higher price of 40s-60s is kind of meaningless. Devilsaur was around 5g last I saw but too difficult/slow for me to farm. Scales of all kinds sell pretty quick but it's not very fast to get them. Though they do tend sell for a nice price at least. 
---
Hides past heavy are vendor trash. Thick and rugged were at vendor price and tend to only go a couple copper over that.
---
As a LW cured rigged hide was great initially when I could get 25-30g each but on a 3 day cooldown. Though the last couple weeks it has crashed. Yesterday it was as low as 8g. If I had maybe 500g more I could probably run the market on it but current supply would wipe me out gold wise and leave me nothing to defend the marked up price.
---
They come from the undead cave in Thunder Bluff I think.
---
That's actually interesting. Always thought most of the gold and other stuff in our electronics is from africa
---
Because those are created by players instead of bought from a vendor. Their price is dependent on the market cost of those items.
---
I don't AOE grind, I'm fire spec. It was a single rare mob spawn in Ashenvale. I literally said that in my comment.
---
what data?
---
Sounds like a perfect time to farm the guck out of mats and stuff that go for a shit ton of gold hen hope they allow server transfers thus giving you the opportunity to make some decent gold.
---
It is.  I deleted my quests and moved on.  Haha.
---
If this is gone, it might have been overlooked or unintended by the Classic devs. Maybe you should report a bug or post on the forums?
---
If you're quitting Blizzard, you're gonna quit this sub, too right? Bye!
---
_Laughs in Shaman_
---
The more I read about this the more hopeful I become.
---
Well they dont have to adapt a lot.  For example, I'm quite certain they dont care about how a boss ability is coded as long as it behaves the same way.
---
i usually go like this while in deep prot spec:
---
mark targets all the time.   
---
these are marks that i'm using and people usually dont have trouble following:
---
* Skull &gt; 1st kill
---
* Cross &gt; 2nd kill
---
* Diamond &gt; 3rd kill / banish
---
* Square &gt; Freeze trap
---
* Moon &gt; Polymorph
---
* Triangle &gt; Patrol / reserved for extra marking if needed
---
* Nipple &gt; Tank / reserved for extra marking if needed
---
* Star &gt; Shackle Undead / reserved for extra marking if needed
---
I usually try to polymorph casters, and freeze trap melee mobs.  
---
When the CC's are wearing off I personally always go for SQUARE first of all CC's because mages, wlocks and priests can always cast their spell from far away to CC.

---
Those are my personal rules im trying to stick to, they're working fine, and there's always room for improvement, but in the end it all depends on your group composition. if you have another warrior than some skills can be completely ignored.
---
other than that make sure to have some sort of threat meter so you can commandeer your party, i.e. tell that mage to chill a bit with frostbolts, because he's outaggroing you.
---
other than that, don't be afraid to let that one hunter or that one rogue to eat a juicy crit because they were focusing wrong target while skull was up.  
---
or let that mage eat shit because he started to AoE while you were running into the battle.  
---
respect and be good a good chap to your heals, and basically forget about rest of the group. your healer is your best pal.
---
Huh, I don't know if that makes it better or worse.

This is solid advice, much better than "just go deep shadow" like the other posters have said. To add on, I would actually recommend switching to shadow at 44 instead of 40. 44 is when you get rank 4 mind flay, which is actually worth casting compared to just using wands; and if you switch at 40 you're missing out on wand spec which is still a huge talent for priests even with shadow form.
---
I would also add on, that if you are *exclusively* leveling as a duo, holy actually isn't too bad. Smite spam is a solid build, the downside is mana consumption; but you'll generate a ton less threat than with MB in shadow so you don't need to use PW:S at all. An occasional renew on your warr friend will really be all you need, and high crit smite is pretty good at getting last hits for spirit tap. Ofc you still pick up wand spec and spirit tap though.
---
Your hitcap with +4 would be 7.4% so you'd need 8% hit on gear. You basically gain 1% hit from the skill bonus.
---
Sounds like you could use  a stand-up desk and a sling! ;P
---
1 / 729, or 0.00137.  You had it right.
---
What data? Is it less than 2 months old?
---
I don't think they will force it. They'll likely allow you to copy your character to TBC servers or something of that sort.
---
I could see it splitting the Classic population though
---
When we are babies. Sure.
---
It’s human nature to poop in a field. Most of us grow out of it.
---
Yeh but you are a salty bitch that deletes thread
---
Didn’t think it would stay low pop, rather.   So the influx of classic players is done you’re saying?
---
no, they didn't. nothing other than free character migrations, which never really fixed any problems and actually created more problems than they solved, imo.
---
My man, PvP is going to be a blast with this. Don't feel bad, Rogues can use this weapon for a reason.
---
Don't know the odds but if it dropped C 10 times in a row, 11th run, it will still drop c in %33.3 chance.
---
At 34 get Scarlet monastery quest, one of the rewards is a nice 1hd sword of serenity.
---
Im pre raid bis and i can kill the "Devilsaur" ones, with evasion and adrenaline rush it was cake
---
Keep in mind that this mount costs mana (interrupting 5 second rule) and can be counterspelled. Hardcore players will still want the regular epic mounts.
---
What? xD
---
No kidding, he won the roll fair and square given the rules, but his dumbass raid lead should probably take a hike.

Reeeee3
---
What happened?
---
Druids are fine for dungeons, maybe better in some cases. The problem for druid tanks is raiding. It's much harder to get gear with +defense, and +hit is harder to find too. Those don't matter too much in dungeons but matter a lot more in raids. 
---
You might not get as many whispers as a warrior would because "everybody knows" druid tanks are "bad", and reputation aside, druids can also heal and that's pretty highly in demand too. But if you're willing to tank, you won't have problems finding groups for PUG dungeons.
---
In general:
---
* Boomers are 50/60s (post war baby boom)
---
* gen X are 70s/80s
---
* Millennials are 90's/00s
---
* Gen Z are 2010s they're really just coming of age
---
And of course there's no clearly defined line of "You were born in 1990 therefore you act like a millennial"
---
The generation blends, A 1990 millennial will act more like Gen X, while a 2000 Millennial will be more "millennial"
---
Should I be saving up all my gold for an epic mount or something else at level 49 - orc rogue?
---
Currently I have 2 14slot bag(from the quests) and a 12slot and 10slot bag. My bags tend to fill up quick while questing which is starting to bother me. I’m a casual player who does quests most of the time and only do dungeons when trying to finish up quest lines.
---
its pretty painful to gear a rogue, get into a core raid group and it gets alot easier but getting into pugs with rogue while everyone rolls for same preraid-bis is kinda "hard"
---
I mean its not impossible but takes more effort than some other classes
---
Slaveknight Gael anyone? He must be in gadgetzan
---
I literally said in my comment it was for a rare spawn that drops one copy of the item even if there are 2 people in your group. It's a hyppogryph in Ashenvale.
---
Death skip in a survival run is maximum brain time

I've tanked from level 13 to 50 almost exclusively inside of dungeons. I just like tanking dungeons more than solo questing on my warrior.
---
[Here's a good list](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-dungeons-overview)
---
I have done a few of the easy quests along the way, but usually just some quick kill quests and then jump right back into tanking dungeons.
---
I will keep tanking dungeons until I'm 60. Next up is Maraudan, then Sunken Temple, then BRD, then LBRS. After that I'll start mixing it up with Scholo, Strat, UBRS, and Dire Maul.
---
I'm glad I spend 1200g on my Tiger.
---
Cat very fresh
---
nice one, cheers.
---
Yeah, the mob only drops one copy off the item i needed even if there are 2 people in the group. I got ninjad 3 times by people who said they just would help kill it. What part of that seems impossible to you lol?
---
Posture Check!
---
Blessed Prayer Beads is better than Briarwood Reed. Even if you suck and activate it randomly, it's up 1/6 of the time for 190 healing, which is more. Hopefully you can be smarter than that.
---
It's also trivial to get instead of nearly impossible since this list takes that into account.
---
Yes. Frostbite is really strong in solo play since you shatter on them.
---
Having enemies freeze while aoeing them spreads them out and ruins your pull.
---
Why not sunder instead of hamstring for the procs?
---
Frostbite is great if you don't intend to aoe grind or ale dungeon spam.
---
If you're the tank, Ravager is toxic and you should drop it. You can't control the procs and tanking is all about control. Every once in a while you'll get lucky and whirlybird everything you need to be hitting, while already in the right stance, and it'll all just stick to you, but more often than not you'll have to cancel the spin immediately because there's a mob running somewhere for you to chase down, or you really need to build rage (you generate none from the ravager proc), or you're in berserker stance and you just know you're gonna get peeled if you let it finish, or you have a cooldown you need to use, or whatever.
---
It's pretty good if you're a dps warrior, or you constantly run with a melee cleave dungeon leveling group that can maximize it, but it's absolute poison for tanking
---
Did you at least tell them to "keep yer feet on der ground"?
---
This is WAI. Please stop being such baby back bitches. Thanks, Mgmt.
---
I wouldn't say done, but anyone who joins from this point on is going to be very less likely to join a low pop server, when there are no longer queues on high pop ones.
---
And if I'm slow rolling?  Trying to manage wife/baby aggro?
---
Or if I'm leaving?
---
If people don't want to group, don't take it personally.
---
Shadow priest maybe, rogues gonna get shit on by a full plate arcanite reaper warrior in similar pre raid gear.
---
Personally I like to get everything just in case you get that odd weapon drop that will carry you for a couple levels.
---
No, you're not being too gold-conscious. gold gain speeds up as you level, but if you want to get that mount at 40 (and you're not a warlock or paladin), you'll want to be conservative until then.
---
Reading the group is very important to tank. If you are tab targeting to sunder all the mobs, you aren't going to get threat off 3 trigger happy DPS that do way more single target threat than you get by trying to slow roll threat gain on everything. In a group like that mark the targets, focus on single target threat until 20%-30% hp left on the mob then switch so you get threat before they start on that one. If they can't figure out to focus the mob with a giant skull over them, they can die or be forced to use cooldowns. Make sure to do some aoe threat (battle shout/demo shout/thunderclap) near the start so they don't beeline to the healer, which can easily happen if they threw a HoT on you before you charged in.
---
These things absolutely struck terror into my little holy priest's heart. As soon as I saw the warrior charging at me with the big-ass skull axe, I knew I was dead. I'm glad to see someone carrying on the tradition.
---
What a stupid thing to do. Blame the victim because you decided to profile someone over the class they play. Amazing you’ve never seen toxic shit in wow but here you are doing toxic shit on Reddit. Good on you for “apologizing” but maybe this is a good time to rethink how you jump to conclusion based on zero evidence
---
It also depends on class/spec a lot.
---
Some really depend on their level 21 or 31 talent to own, like Mortal Strike makes 49 Warrior Twinks more desirable than 39 or lower.
---
Likewise, Shadow Priests have access to their entire arsenal by level 39, so if I was to twink a SPriest, I'd aim for 39.
---
Easy access to gear also matters, 19 Rogues can get a full Defias set from VC, which makes them gods.
---
46 priest here, went full shadow at 40 and did several runs at uldaman and zul farrak, still fairly easy to heal.
---
I do think you need to respec early 50's to make life easier in dungeons.
---
And you dont need a healing set at this stage, i still focus on spirit and intel.
---
I even did ZF as dps a few times full shadow, more fun then healing xD
---
Guy relax, its just a better looking character... nothing chad about this... no one is rubbing it in or thinking they are better.
---
Men, you are the real thing not using questie. I was going for a pure pt and not use that kind of thing but i lasted a day tbh.
---
Mind to explain?
---
Thunderclap is kinda tricky, and not everyone uses it. It's a great debuff and quick burst of aoe threat to help start a pull off. You have to be in/switch to battle stance to use it, which can cost you rage if switching and you have to get right back in def stance after so you don't hobble your threat. The debuff also doesn't last very long.
---
I use it mostly for large aoe pulls, and usually just once right after charging then switch to defensive stance, pop blood rage, and demo shout, then tab/sunder spam.
---
Otherwise i don't think it's worth the hassle.
---
The difference is warriors relay on crit way more than rogues. For warriors crits = flurry = more white hits = more rage = more yellow hits = more crits and thus crit is more valued than hit after hitcap, untill you are critcapped, period.
---
If you dont want to AOE, I would recommend fire not frost.
---
I have never tanked before and just rolled an Tauren Warrior, any basic tips/strategies for beginner dungeons?
---
If I go into a dungeon, I'm rolling on something that is an upgrade.  Otherwise, why should I be there?  You followed the rules handed out, don't feel bad.
---
One bad gnomer experience tends to ruin the dungeon for people, mostly because it's SO long and tedious if everyone has the quests and nobody knows where to go or what to do for them. I did it knowing the dungeon pretty thoroughly, and with a pretty good group, and it was fine. I've never hated gnomer for any reason except the fact that a bad group makes for a miserable experience. The dungeon itself is fine, though.
---
&gt;Level 25 druid. Livin it. Lovin it.
---
Druid is a great main to level. I would suggest trying to keep both Feral and Caster gear to be flexible when doing dungeons.
---
On My Druid (currently level 39) I have been doing everything in dungeons. Tank, Heal, and DPS.
---
If you're efficient you can do strat live in an hour, maybe less. Just request first orb (or greens, or whatever, orb is just the most common. Been seeing around 2 or 3 per run) as payment. If you dont need anything else most groups should see that as reasonable
---
Greenish, like a troll
---
Most of my pals are on lvl 60 but there's a group of "rebels" that got to lvl 5 and said the game sucks and it's for old people. There's a guy that says the game is too easy even tho he's lvl 46 and bases easines of this game on onyxia and MC that he seen my guild raid, yea it's old content for this patch, talents, itemisation, nerfed 10 times before TBC released. Got 3 or better 2 friends still enjoying this game with me but we'll see how long it takes for them to get bored. All I wanted was a discord/ts full of friends laughing at how great and bad that game is playing AV/AB and just having fun. The most discouraging thing for them I think is faction balance on our realm. It's impossible to leave your character for 30 seconds in Light's Hope to not die mindcontroled into the guards or mobs. Leveling redridge ? just go spam deadmines for 5 level beause you won't survive a second in RM. I'm really amazed how the faction works...
---
I meant they would probably do a circuit of Stormwind first, then head out.
---
Sir this is a Wendy’s
---
Lol.  You honestly have no idea what you're talking about if you think the majority of people came back because of, "access to old content."
---
Classic tripled the subscriber numbers for WoW.  I, and many, many others, would have never have came back if they just put the old world into BFA.  I have no plans of ever playing the current expansion.
---
Shouldn't you be donating money to homeless or curing cancer? Why waste your time here?
---
Your gold intake picks up considerably around 30-40.  Everything in the early game is essentially worthless which is what makes gold so hard to come by.
---
When I started and was super poor, I prioritized getting one ranged skill (I like Thrown Weapons) and one 2h skill.  Eventually get them all.  
---
Having a ranged skill is important for tanking, so you can easily LOS enemies.
---
Have you seriously not read a single word I’ve typed? I’ve stated *at least* three times that I do group with people and help when I can, but am not so single minded that I believe everyone has to play the game the same way I do.
---
There's a couple of global channels that are used for this. I'm not naming names because that's how you get a troll brigade.
---
There's also the scroll down to see it 18+ sections in people's RP profiles.
---
It happens, it's just kept to its own places. And that's as it should be.
---
Fortunately, Wrath is gorgeous and also has a cooler name.

Yeah, I've done 2 priests on 2 different pservers and never realised how easy Mara was as a priest before now.   
---
But even so, I stil augment my Mara farm with other stuff like herbing and fishing. Nothing really beats a good uninterupted farm in the world. So if Im awake early on weekends etc I always go herb/fish until I notice my spots being more contested.

---
Well he got killed by someone he trusted
---
Fortunately people who care about stupid names are confined to the RP servers. It makes the experience smoother for all of us.

The guy brought in politics to a gaming tournament on Blizzard's platform with clearly defined rules against that behavior, what did you expect would happen? Anyone can say how they would have handled it, but then again, neither of us are running a multi billion dollar company.
---
Can a shaman get there with sight?
---
Opening the floodgates for changes sure would, though.
---
It's +5% per 8 hours, with max +150% (so exactly level and a half).
---
well its a bit easier comparing what you gain and what you lose if you just have crit/hit/agi on your gear. thats why i started this post at the first place
---
Yes, dark iron and green ores can spawn instead normal ones plus dark iron is limited by zones.
---
But Ravager!
---
Generally, the only nearly even PvP servers you are ever going to find (in ANY iteration of WoW) are RP-PVP servers because the community on those servers takes care of it themselves.
---
After over a decade of PvP servers existing, it is evident that most of the PvP community does not want fair fights or balanced servers. They want every advantage they can get, especially being on the more populated side of the servers.
---
The underpopulated faction then starts leaving the server because of the mass of gankings and the other faction making it nearly impossible to level (as evidenced by Stalagg &amp; Heartseeker.)
---
This isn't a problem Blizzard can fix, and unless the PvP community completely changes its mentality after over a decade of this...  It's not something that will be fixed any time soon.
---
If you want to be the bane of every warrior's existence, the only logical choice is mage.
---
As someone playing an Enhancement Shaman which is pretty much *the* meme spec, I can understand what you're trying to say but unfortunately it falls flat practically. Sure I buff the others in my group, but the boss would die faster if there was another warrior in my spot.
---
That's all people really care about in a PVE environment. Does the boss die in one shot without difficulty? Can we make it faster by switching classes out? If a singke class can bring more impact in his role than I offer by supporting the other 4 in my group, then why care? Sure they individually perform better thanks to my totems, but not enough that it's worth bringing me.
---
We'll have to ask you to leave now, Sir.
---
That's exactly what the raid lead and officers were saying. Makes me feel a bit better, thanks!
---
Wait really? I play rogue so thats why I don't know?
---
It's likely they nerfed this. It was a pretty easy way to level on private servers, so I'm guessing they didn't want zones flooded with 60s taking entire areas over.
---
This. If you're ret trying to heal it, I'd wait until 44 or 45, but holy spec typically has the tools that make healing things way over your level pretty easy. (Healed Cathedral at 34 on a holy pally with no trouble.)
---
Nope, just the one!
---
Why are they entitled to our time or attention when their actions show otherwise? 
---
I won’t tell someone to shut up, that’s their freedom of speech to exercise it. I am however allowed to decide I don’t want to listen. Everyone gets a chance, and they blew theirs. Yet to have them say anything of value that couldn’t be gleamed from other sources.
---
I gave you the chance of letting me ride by in peace, but you have elected the way of pain!
---
&gt;Druid generally sucks balls for making money
---
druid is one of the best grinders. if you have some passable feral gear from leveling/quests, you don't even need to be hotw spec
---
I've got one, it's awesome too, like a transformer.
---
it is slang or short for pissed off or ticked off etc.
---
That's nowhere near enough. You have a slot left
---
As horde I usually start from WC to lvl 22+, then sfk to 30, SM up to 42 (easy to find groups) then Zf. You can spam zf  up to lvl 52 as it's pretty quick dangeon with a lot of aoe. Very easy to find groups and also tanaris is good for quesing around while spamming lfg. You need at least 1run to maraudon for quests but probably more for the ring pre raid bis. Make it to lvl 54 and spam brd. Of course you can run every dangeon if you find a group but those are the faster way as people stick around those dangeons for power lvl. So usually u get invited and start running it pretty quick.
---
I see no reason why not. The only thing that doesn't proc are weapon-effects, as you never actually attack with your weapon.
---
If you pick-pocket naga, you can get Shiny Digglehopper, a (Disney) little mermaid reference.
---
No thai would be arenas that did that.
---
Shame on me but it is. Don't know... just never changed it😅
---
Shield slam is prot only and the reason why I raid tank prot instead of fury / prot
---
Makes sense. Like I said, hit is still valuable. I I'd take 1% hit over .5% crit for example, even far away from the crit cap. Everything has a conversion weight for your gear level. More hit is literally more hits, and *could* mean more damage, but if you're actively sacrificing crit for hit beyond the yellow cap then you have issues.
---
&gt; Having a ranged skill is important for tanking, so you can easily LOS enemies.
---
Truth right here.

That's what I thought at first, but some people are really just that dumb. I think OP is one of them.
---
And the woooooorld will TOTALLY BAN YOUR @$$!
---
Because it wasn't bannable back then they are lying
---
Yes, but at the same time, leveling and gearing a warrior first will take far less time than doing a mage then a warrior.
---
It's not for lack of creativity that this stuff isn't as common now. It's that video games became BIG money, and that leads to corporations, which lead to the sanitizing of products and scrums and dead lines and less individual freedom of anyone involved in projects.  
---
I mean, look at all the gnarly details in RDR2. That's a game where the studio still lets devs and designers have a lot of individual say.
---
this is why you roll tauren from the get go
---
Once I hit 60 it's likely on to the next char!
---
This was me at first too but now I've come to... like it? I don't know, it makes the world slightly more dangerous. I definitely wouldn't have picked it if I didn't have much time in the day to play though. But I've yet to be corpse camped. If a high level kills me, they kind of just fuck off afterwards and I respawn. Plus not all players pvp eachother. I'd say 15% of the people I've run into attack me.
---
So your macro is 100% working now? Because imabout to steal it.
---
Balance is fine to PVP in. Just don't expect to raid with it at all.
---
That's kind of a stretch lol
---
Regardless, the system in place requires that you do damage to receive kill credit. I think this only pertains to (RAID) quests since obviously you can heal in dungeons/other things. 
---
Either way, it's either a bug or not and it seems like the GM has recognized that there have been many bug reports (mine included) and the team has not recognized this as a bug. So the GM told him how to get credit. The same way I got credit.
---
&gt; Are there any I should just skip?
---
Polearms. And if you don't plan tanking - you could skip all one-handed weapons.
---
49 MASTER RACE
---
19 is especially easy though because any level 60 can run you through the level 19 dungeons (wailing caverns or deadmines) and get the relevant drops.  Higher levels require a little more 'commitment' from friends to run you thru, and the time requirement is a little higher to get you in.  
---
39 twinks are interesting because you can have 300/300 professions so some crazy engi trinkets make an appearance!
---
That was well deserved!
---
Oh interesting. Is this a thing?? I assume a baby OT for smaller mobs/group of mobs that die quickly + evasion?
---
Well, since that increase in spellpower allows your spells to return more health, you actually have more health to tap mana from therefore more mana at your disposal.
---
A rogue that had TF in vanilla and then wins the roll on a binding in his first MC, what are the odds lol
---
Ahhhhhhhh! Lmao.
---
Remove it homie! If you ever need to melee just right click.
---
Shift all spells over 1 spot to the left. Your fingers will thank you :)
---
My price whenever I did it back in the day was that I get all gear drops from DM. I was an enchanter, so I'd more than make the money back by simply disenchanting all the drops and selling them on the AH.
---
Some skilled tanks, with a good group where they know their healers are good, tank some dps race encounters with twohanders even in raids to allow more dps from DDs
---
You did, too
---
There's one where the aeroplanes are behind iron forge.
---
It's got in unfinished FP there too
---
The feeling when you complete the blood red quest. Impossible to describe.
---
I can some guy yell at me for not wanting to group on the Felwood furbolgs. It's like, I'm trying to get the rep drops, fuck off. They get real butthurt real fast "OMG IT'S A KILL QUEST U NOOB"
---
It's likely everything will increase. The economy as a whole might get right fucked.
---
This is just a list I made for myself and decided to share.
---
You are right though, I'm wasting my time and energy with these people. Where would you recommend I post this list to avoid the dregs and degens of Reddit?
---
One would be silly NOT to roll a paladin at that point, considering they can wear EVERY armor class!...I'd let ALL my groups die, ALL of them!!
---
Indubitably
---
So a quick question. 
---
Did you do the entire grind with runeclothes? Or did you also do some questing at 60 to get additional rep.
---
It might have been during a different era, but can't you go back to the starting zones you didn't play in (and other zones as well), mop up some low level quests and get tauren/orc/troll/undead rep that way? I think you're able to get into honored doing that.
---
(Plus since you don't get XP, I think you get increased gold for doing quests at 60?)
---
Same reason people buy foreign cars
---
Big column dildo
---
Wait you only level by killing mobs? Good lord
---
For my friend group it was doomed from the start. The east coast-west coast time differences had us all split on different servers by the end of week one. Despite the free server transfers, everyone was all reasonably settled with extended friend groups. Shame
---
This is Crossroads.

yep, and larion &amp; muigin.  aka mario and luigi.  un'goro is full of cool nintendo references.

buffing entire group with a huge increase of dps&gt;your pet
---
If it would be Heroes of the Storm, then you could bet it would be report. But then, there ppl wouldnt even talk. :D
---
Yeah I'm glad there's some etiquette around it.
---
Personally I wouldn't play on an RP server, but it's the most balanced pvp server too.
---
I remember in WoD, idle ogres in Nagrand would ocassionally fish in the river.
---
Why would you gquit? There were no tanks from the guild there, they weren't giving it to rogues over guild tanks, only pug tanks. Not sure why you're so mad at the guild here.
---
You can make some funky deep holy builds around Holy Nova with Spirit Tap and farm the lashers in Dire Maul.
---
I was wondering, there should be a universal emote to tell people that their macro makes no sense. Like, this one, you can read.  A popular one, is obviously go back to retail. But twice, i've encountered someone spamming something and I know they were trying, because it was all spaced out and random letters, but it was gibberish. So they messed it up. 
---
I kinda want to know what insult they were going to use, but they have no idea whatever they are spamming is nothing.
---
Can we pick an emote and make it a thing? like /golfclap or do people use that too much when pvping.
---
This is what I did.  Couple of late night farming sessions netted my 50-60 hides - at 12g a pop on my server was essentially enough to boost my gold sufficiently for Epic mount.  
---
Did some more farms more recently and it's just too over-contsted now (not to mention the skining ninja's)
---
CIA agent is CIA agent
---
Yes, wowhead has numbers from the lowered costs that were implemented during TBC.
---
It would really help if you disclosed your class.
---
Druids, paladins, and priests use entirely different stat priorities.
---
Most guilds I was ever in you just told ML your spec before the raid and this went on through any xpac. I'd show up to do LK 25HC as combat rogue but I was out for the dagger instead of the axe so I said MS assa before the raid. Same thing for say, RS. RS drops bis assa wrists but also bis combat arp trinket so you had to decide what you were after and be aware you likely weren't going to end up with the other if it dropped.
---
Doing your guild a favor is doing it a favor, it doesn't mean you get to step all over a 40 man raid for rolls in 2 specs unless you have a very relaxed guild. Regardless, all that stuff has to be sorted out ahead of time.
---
I once spammed my right mouse button to pick up a quest item that resspawns and I noticed that sometimes my mouse cursor was ported in the middle of my screen and back to the original position as I spammed it. So i guess that is what happens sometimes if you press your right mouse button I don't know why it is happening tho
---
Gnome warriors are adorable!
---
Ive seen many classic players say they would pay for a character boost in classic, that questing in classic is bad, etc. The average casual always whined about how long everything took in classic. They started giving in to them in Wrath, and the game became progressively worst, in fact most classic players quit in wrath/cata. The game became shit to classic players when they started to listen to casuals, which are far more numerous than hardcore players who actually understand the game.

Currently 39, been slowrolling this hump, I've basically done nothing but a few quests in STV late at night and farmed 3 straight levels in SM Armory because I'm so done with questing.
---
Leveling guide is pointing me to Duskwallow Marsh which seems like a nice change of pace. What's next for me, a Horde Warlock, as I approach 40? What's the next dungeon I get to be interested in? That's my favourite part of the game currently.
---
This was my thought.  By the time I hit 60 I'll come strutting into a city full of Eagles wearing badass raid gear.
---
It's 100% because of Murphy's law.
---
Running Scholo and other dungeons is reliable
---
I would hope to be past pre-Raid BiS and onto Phase 2 post-raid BiS by BWL, so this list would indeed be obsolete.
---
I'm unfamiliar with the term Willpower. Is that another word for Spirit?
---
Try my method i mentioned before. It should always work as the only condition is that youre using a modifier. Any modifier. And you dont have any other modifiers in the macro, so essentially my line becomes the onlything relevant
---
A bear MTing patchwork will die unless they're grossly overgeared
---
And you know what, mr RAID LEADER, Yes, I DID just innervate myself instead of a priest...you got anything to say about it?!?...didn't think so.

---
What were you reported for?
---
lol? why do u think i made the post to begin with? as i said it seems a trend, at least in my experiences
---
You're the only dumb one here who doesn't get it. This is a very simple conversation that you are still struggling with.
---
Anyone can throw me an invite to warocks’ discord?
---
Don't forget Shaman. Filthy Alliance. :P
---
It’s been 59 levels what’re you waiting for haha
---
Are you sure it’s not just the Lying Character Screen? Find a rogue with low level weapons (better yet: weapons with a static damage range) and have them hit you a lot, change armor worn, etc. Any dual wield character would help get data quicker, but you have to adjust for the off hand damage penalty.
---
Well the main problem is not what we think is better, u might say i have issues but unless you back your things with sime math then we can throw shit at eachother whole day. This post is about that math that i cannot find
---
Man, at least savage glad chain is a 5(if that) minute farm. Fucking Rend runs and the 15 minutes of RP and waves, ugh.
---

---
can't be bothered to do your own research? it's not my prerogative to assist such a pompous fool in any endeavor, but as I said before, GL to you sir.
---
For sure. I've loved remembering all the nice and even the mean people. They get a reputation for something, so might as well make it good!
---
Yup.  It's very relaxing for me.  With questing, I get stressed at trying to be as efficient as possible.  Grinding mobs is just very chill and theraputic to me.  Lots of money as well.  I do dungeons as well when I have time, but that's not often.
---
You won it fair and square. It's insane that any warriors would join a pug that did that but hey, it is what it is. Thems the rules.
---
But hybrids aren't support, they're healers. It's a blog post based on semantics if you're discarding hybrid dps.
---
Hunters, rogues, probably spell casters, although once battlegrounds open, it’ll all change.
---
Agreed 49 is by far the best bracket. My 49 shaman with kang back in the day was so much fun! 29 and 39 rogue was great too!
---
&gt; But I'm the one with a big head.
---
Yes. You are acting as if you are better than anyone in this thread, all because ... they still play a game you don't play anymore. I am not even saying your reasons for not playing the game aren't valid. They absolutely are. But again, I am sure there are companies you associate with that I wouldn't. I don't presume to think I'm better than you for it. 
---
Also, I have to wonder about your username. What does it mean? Because surely someone who clearly considers themselves to be a good person isn't using gay as an insult in 2019, are they?
---
lol, most servers are imbalanced the other way. at least you have superior racials to carry you. cry more horde baddy
---
&gt; and it seems to me that the horde vastly outnumbers Alliance
---
yes, every server with one or two rare exceptions
---
Ah I see your account has special characters. You see it undermines the players who reserved or obtained the names early, when you can put a little dot or symbol to take the same name they have.
---
Now I have to spend gold to test this
---
yes, go back to your LFG tool. Where Value is king!
---
Thank you very much sir! This helps a lot!
---
Wait what did he say?
---
In Vanilla I always lagged in World PvP. If it didn't lag I would be surprised. lol.
---
AQ opening was horrreeennndous. lol.
---
Wasn’t that worried about it until you called attention to it.  Thanks.
---
Virginity
---
It should have been mentioned in the OP, but in other comments it's mentioned the tanks were PUGs and no guild tanks were present.
---
This is great information, so people don't buy up too many mats if it's not needed.
---
Can anyone confirm the correct amounts?
---
Honestly, if you're able to clear the content already, then bring in others with underplayed specs - it's a win-win for everybody.
---
If you're still on progress, maybe stick to more conventional strats until you can fly through?
---
Or don't and just play the game for the fun it brings!
---
ur full of shit, it became completely 100% un fucking playable when a zerg guild raided stormwind on our server
---
Boring for you but some people having way more fun doing some work in groups. It's fun to kill targets helping your group to survive. Human interaction is the key here. Try to view it from different perspective. Questing solo could be boring af. Quests are very similar, kill those, loot that. As a veteran I saw all quests and locations I like to group with new people rather than kill bots solo.
---
So then I need to make a choice- sell things so I have gold, or keep them to use for mats in my professions. I either will have gold to train as I level or I have to sacrifice my profession leveling until I hit 60 and have money. 
---
Whereas right now, I don't need to make that choice. Even though I can only play an hour or two a day and don't have time to grind for gold, I don't need to because the economy right now is reasonably priced- if I only have a gold or two left over after training, I can still afford to buy some mats off the AH to continue leveling my professions (because as you know, the higher your profs go, the more you need other mats for your professions, like leather or potions for tailoring).
---
In MoP days their were a few 40 man multiboxers, mostly for their own reasons, but MoP had more chance for world pvp due to Timeless Isle and world bosses.
---
PVP and making my own fun is what I plan at 60.
---
Not suggesting you were asking for this, but if you are on the tanks heels on threat you can use cleave as your rage burn to avoid cap rather than heroic strike. Not quite as much damage, but generates a lot less threat.
---
Again, I'm not trying to single out any specific playstyle, but merely trying to find a way to compute support into a visible variable.
---
You might not be bringing much to a dps grp except for slightly stronger totems but how do you know how much extra dps you are providing compared to a resto shaman who's totem twisting ? that slightly increase in variation might not be enough to justify you taking the spot of a pure dps but how would we know that exactly? what if you're wielding a nightfall axe, then how much does your utility increase when combined to your superior totem twisting? in order to judge things we need data, but there is no metric that covers this.
---
What is the alliance equivalent to this? Anyone?
---
zoomer
---
it's necessary to be fixed right fucking now dude
---
priests can farm dm with decent gear and holy nova
---
This fellow looks like an orc shaman, so I'm not sure what his method would have been, but 1600g in a month is not undoable, even with limited play time.
---
There's a mage in my guild who solo farms the Robes of the Archmage pattern. He has gotten 10+ of them and usually sells them for ~200g within minutes of the drop.
---
So i keep getting stuck in shadow form and as you can see I’m pressing my key bind and it doesn’t work and I have to right click the top right portrait to get out of shadow form this is really annoying and has gotten me killed a few times now
---
Don’t play retail, haven’t played it since Wrath. But keep on trying to rep that you’re “OG” like you’re the only one. Good luck bro, you’re going to need it.
---
Why do you need multiple gear sets?
---
sounds like it's time to gtfo ;D
---
Or maybe it is the word COSTCO clearly printed on the seat of the shopping cart?

---
if people get mad about your spec in a DM run, just escape quickly - they are morons.
---
Best class for bgs and pvp in general are tauren druids 
---
Hands down end of discussion
---
This comment is bot biased at all
---
&gt; The rules were simple: free rolls on loot, MS &gt; OS
---
&gt; I plan to put it to good use and PvP tons with it.
---
&gt; I don't think I'll be using them in PvE since it does pull a lot of threat
---
Do you see the problem here? For dps classes in a raid, main spec is PVE. PVP is off spec. If you can't use Thunderfury in a raid, it is not for your "main spec."
---
Rogues rolling on bindings is no different than a healer rolling on the Talisman of Ephimeral Power (except bindings are much more rare and valuable). It's not for raiding, it's for having fun outside the raid.
---
The raid leaders should not have permitted it under the stated loot rules. They should have given it to a class that can use it for PVE, in the role that they were performing at the raid. This was a colossal fuck up on the raid leaders part. They are too stupid to realize it.
---
This is why you don't let huntards watch the movie "Wanted". They start trying to curve bullets and its just silly!
---
lol thats probably why, most of this crap is prob from alliance side

Tauren can't ride wolves.
---
Bear Form doesn't scale each level, but at higher levels you get a better Bear Form called Dire Bear Form that replaces it.
---
That sucks. Had something similar happen to me when I only healed a group and didn't actually tag the mob. Both of these GMs were useless, they could have easily given you the credit, but they appear to be "by the book" assholes.
---
I've been checking for weeks and haven't seen any worth getting.
---
Literally saw a Human riding a Nightelf Mount 2 weeks after launch.....
---
close-minded nonsense. keep rolling for ban'thok's sash and watch your reputation dwindle on your server for being a greedy person.
---
lmao
---
why in the world not
---
Why did you roll Paladin? The buffs are one of the only saving graces.
---
Broke: Mounts and pets in retail
---
Woke: Power levelling
---
Bespoke: Memes
---
Baroque: Screenshots taken with phone camera
---
Frost is more efficient
---
In dungeons, where the debuff limit is a non-issue, should I start using Rupture instead of Eviscerate on high armor targets?
---
So much dedication from this drood !
---
Not much of a probably about it
---
We’re trying to figure out why you have had a different experience than us. Maybe you’ve just had bad luck, but we don’t know you, so it’s reasonable to consider you might be doing something to cause this situation. We’re just assuming, just posing the question.
---
Bc i didnt know...
---
Going to look into what a raid frame is
---
You're saying it's a "myth". Which implies that it didn't actually happen.  
---
Then you go on to say it was justified.   
---
I guess I can't read because I'm not getting it.
---
Is there a resource/recommendation for bis or stat priorities for Arms warrior PvP? I'm tanking for now but I want to keep an eye out for gear I can snag along the way.
---
i have reed as well, but the 3 ban'thok sashes i've seen drop i passed on because i had casters in my group. i was lucky enough to get thuzadin's sash when no other casters in my group needed it, which is actually better than your ONLY listed option for belt on the list. *facepalm*
---
Not when using pyro.
---
They have reverted the fingerprinting.  You no longer need the TTL value changes or IPv6.   Keep those option in your back pocket in case it happens again later though.
---
Ohhhh
---
Hmm maybe it’s just me then, my server is low to medium population so if I was on a higher pop server I’d have a better chance of seeing more I guess
---
I had a full run today with a level 53 priest healing.
---
It's fucking insane the lack of understanding GMs show about this game. Absolutely insane.
---
I play a Rogue but on the Alliance side.  On my server we are uncommon...I wouldn't be surprised if we are the least common class...but I haven't got any concrete data on that, just observational stuff.
---
You need to tame them to get the highest level skills, then you can teach them to your baby raptor and keep using it if ya want.
---
Art, downvote and move on
---
off the coast north of the hinterlands, right before you hit fatigue waters
---
ez
---
They don't want to be seen.
---
Feral, restoration, and balance. Some gear overlap but if you want to play feral and the other two you’ll want two sets of gear
---
Just a heads up for anyone reading this, hunters have to be engineers to blow a locked door open, or a blacksmith with a skeleton key otherwise you ain't getting to the last boss.
---
What the actual hell is going on with this UI?
---
Why don't you just remove your spine while you're at it
---
An hour of their time is a long time to spend simply helping someone.  
---
Guildie or not they’re still spending their time doing a service for you.  
---
If a guildie helped me get the warlock mount I’d pay them for their work, and if I helped someone else I’d expect to be tipped too.
---
Loot Council guilds tend to be quite rough.  I happen to be in one but the only items that are loot counciled are tank gear primarily or if there is caster gear that greatly benefits the healers over dps.  Usually it is mostly master loot with a few slight exceptions like tank loot.
---
Probably either your server or class discord. I know the Whitemane discord usually has some decent class discussion.
---
It's a good list man. I play priest so I'm gonna be checking it out. The players on this sub are just condescending casuals sadly.
---
No this is false, it simply removes the health update delay that is on top of spell batching.
---
off the coast north east of the hinterlands, right before you hit fatigue waters
---
Lol Jesus. Just walks around destroying everything in his path.
---
If anything we’re closer to that now than then.
---
They're not as popular as Warriors or Mages but they are popular. Probably not seeing them because they are stealthed. If you play on a pvp server, a rogue out of stealth in Classic is SUPER vulnerable, so it's in their best interest to stay stealthed often.
---
PVP is main spec?
---
You're doing a great job, keep practicing English!
---
When I played on the PServers I ended up buying one because I got so tired of looking at Trash Blade, and I wasn't getting drops for Dal'Rends, Viskaag, or Brutality Blade. But it was like 250 gold I could have used toward my epic. This time I'm gonna resist the urge to buy one.
---
I swear there was this streamer who had 40+ accounts that he multiboxed. I later did hear (not witness myself though) that he was some what of a toxic person/asshole. So yeah, there are some crazy few that do this kind of shenanigan. I think the 40+ person was filled with DKs and 1 other class, can't remember what though.
---
I guess if you have to buy the seeds.  I have like 50 from my time in Un’Goro ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The loot rules were MS&gt;OS. The weapon is basically only useable by tanks in PVE - it generates a great deal of AOE threat, and would likely cause problems if you had one or more non-tanks starting to use it.
---
Like I said, it is mostly the fault of shitty raid leading. But to offer up these excuses such as "Yeah I know it's a tank weapon but other people were rolling!" and "I'll make good use of it in PVP" makes next to no sense. 
---
If you make loot rules such as MS&gt;OS, and then after hour(s) spent in MC you make a slight adjustment to these rules on literally one of the best items in the game (i.e.: randomly deciding, at this point in the run, that all elligible classes can roll on bindings, despite it not being suitable for most of them) then yeah you are incompetent.
---
Tanking on your way to 60 is chaotic and the only advice I can give is to keep your reviver alive. 
---
Your dps is going to pull aggro and not care about your stacks of sunder or 10 second cooldown melee taunt and they'll assume that your aoe taunt with a 10min cooldown is always available.
---
So save money for repairs and set aside at least a couple hours per dungeon and all you can do is hope you get everything you want on your first run
---
Level 40 Kodo: Bad
---
Level 60 Kodo: Good
---
You don't see them because they are stealthed :P
---
any tank level 50-60= anthropomorphized self entitlement
---
Stonetalon camp more alive then Anthem.
---
done 10 runs so far only, 6 of them being orc boss :D no chest tho
---
I'm sorry, you're saying 2% crit, 9agi 20ap (which means 38 AP total, plus crit from the agi) isn't much better than 2%crit 0ap?
---
Are you high?
---
I don't like avocado, but generally happy with Applebee's going away. I've never had a good experience at one. This labeling stuff is too difficult to keep up with.
---
I said the custom groups were broadcast to users with the same addon. It will broadcast your group in whatever channel you tell it to, to anyone regardless of if they have the addon.
---
FEED YOUR PET!!!
---
What category you picked on vistaprint to get it in good quality ?
---
Mage saltiness is 100% okay. I'm in a group to do the dragons for ony attunement. I'm giving food/water left and right making ports to get close to dragons/ turn in quest. Not one thank you
---
We get the the last dragon and I'm out of ports, I let them know I'm out and I just port myself. Queue 3 people whispering how I'm an asshole and a shitty person, they kick me out of the Ubrs group we were gonna do.
---
Like fuck off, I'm tired of people being demanding. So now I'm a dick to get people off of my back before they even start
---
Never had it happen to me personally. My experience has been a pretty positive one. Imean this could be a joke wooshing right over me.
---
keep us updated sir, thanks.
---
naaah it isn't :D
---
Then you are doing it the hard way.
---
Thank you, mate. It is much appreciated.
---
I'm not quite sure the game's launch had anything to do with your decision, moreover, it seems like it was your choice of server.
---
/gquit and never look back.
---
If you're flagged for pvp, then killing lowbies is fair game!
---
I also play a undead rogue on the german server lakeshire
---
Actually I'm surprised. Rogues are usually a very popular class due to absolutely wrecking in world pvp, but I gotta say I've seen a lot more of the other classes around the world and in groups and stuff. Maybe because so many people ran mages/warlocks? Idk
---
Epic mount is usually an eventually thing
---
Such an Aries thing to say.
---
damn XD thanks, Indalamar !!! XD XD XD
---
Get the hell outta dodge and advise others to do the same. Which server my guy?
---
Nope lmao - hes the 100% kos
---
While you all are getting level 19 and 29 twinks, I'm out here with my level 59 twink
---
absolutely.
---
Usually CC the main character. At least I remember that being the go-to strategy back when multiboxing became famous. Unsure if mboxing strategies have become better over the years.
---
Thanks all
---
The responses have been great and I now have a game plan going forward with my Fishing :)
---
Lol why would I ever give thunderfury to a random pug when i can use it.
---
Lol. That was my first thought as well.
---
Totally agree with this. It's better to just play warrior. Also, as you get higher level, warrior is amazing at farming lower level instances which is actually a solid way to earn extra gold.
---
I mean the problem is their metric of utility will always be compared to the loss of losing a pure DPS. I think the context for this matters a lot but for the vast majority of guilds no, they don’t have to minmax every raid slot this hard to kill raid content that players cleared in greens well below lvl 60.
---
As someone who played Druid to 60 and in raid, most hybrids are simply forced to play healer as a result of their dps specs (or support as you might call it) being either so wildly unoptimized, or simply the  pros don’t outweigh the cons. You have to consider that whatever mentality you are frustrated with here is simply the logical way to assess why you should or shouldn’t bring something.
---
Every utility option that is brought by a hybrid class is at the loss of someone doing significantly much more damage, generally so much so that it’s almost not even comparable. This has to be considered if you want to sit down and have a serious discussion about why non meta specs aren’t brought much to raids, especially hybrid DPS. 
---
Keep in mind that the vast majority of utility benefits are brought simply by bringing the class and not the spec. Which is why most hybrid classes are brought as healing as they provide almost everything a hybrid dps would, but they can at least do decent healing where they wouldn’t do decent DPS. Basically the utility provided by such “support” classes is literally there to allow others to do more DPS. If the DPS benefit of utility provided does not outweigh simply bringing a more meta DPS to fill the slot, why would you?
---
I’m not saying the point of the topic is wrong, I just think you can’t disregard others saying you have to weigh both options against each other. At the end of the day someone has to pick and choose what class or spec combination they want filling that raid slot, and you can’t just ignore major deciding factors.
---
This isnt a Loot Council it's a "Funnel everything to the class leaders" council.  Saying someone has "helped the most" is a ridiculous abstract reasoning.  If they had said "Our class leader still uses carrot on a stick in his trinket slot and has helped a lot" okay I get that, but then dont funnel him another piece the second it drops.
---
So yeah, I'd start looking for a new guild.  Even if the new guild just free rolls, at least you get a chance at items.
---
/u/reft0
---
These are from TBC times when the amount of mats needed to get the mount was nerfed. The actual 1.12 patch required 35 scales.
---
and without fail the items drop for your grp mate more often so he gets 8/8 while you're at 1/8 and they dont want to stick around to help you finish, then you have to solo the rest anyway
---
This is wrong. Those are not classic numbers. I'd recommend you get the 35.
---
They were changed. PVP is not "main spec."
---
I've been questing here lately and Tanaris in particular is a really good place for that - it's a pretty bleak and dangerous place, and there's a lot of dead tracks and abandoned camps all over the place with tracks that tell a bit of a story. Even the beach south of the southern mountains has a crashed plane!
---
hehe, it's mix of context, art atmosphere and her face expression
---
Sigh, upvote... (Chuckling inside)
---
its probably because it looks like a $5 hoe asking "you wanna private dance mon?"
---
vendor all your greens and blues, buy 24 hrs worth of water breathing potions
---
The city hubs in BFA are literally chock full of tiny NPC behaviors/interactions like this.
---
I sent one poor priest who saved me roughly five long messages meant for someone else before they were finally like "I think you're whispering the wrong person". 
---
Yes, yes I was. And I would have continued doing so all night, apparently.
---
Since when is PVP main spec?
---
Are you trying to top raid meters or have farm nodes?
---
I used to 5 box a group of shamans and was considering doing it again in classic. I couldn't remember the email I used to create the accounts, and they're not merged with my main account. There is no account recovery option, you have to open a ticket. I opened one, gave them all my info, everything I could remember, the guild name I created, the server, the credit card. They told me they couldn't find the accounts. &gt;&lt;
---
&gt; Also stick to 2h weapons for tanking for now. You do more damage intially which helps maintain threat. First dungeon I felt like I needed a shield was BRD.
---
No consideration for shield wall, shield bash and shield slam?
---
Well now you've gone and screwed my comment.
---
"Shut up I'm the leader you're dumb"
---
*laughs in red flag*
---
The orange items are the 'quest items', which total to 400g.  Cost of the mats isn't included
---
Which also happens if you go solo, you just don‘t know it.
---
Rogues are very very very popular, and for a good reason!
---
Not better for PvP though! Two birds, one stone. I got it as the only Cloth wearer in my group in one of my first BRD runs.
---
I actually passed on Bonecreeper Stylus yesterday to let a Mage who I know has been trying for it for a good few days have it. I care more about my reputation than you randomly assumed.
---
You seem to have taken offence to my entire existence over a Reddit thread. Interesting that, isn't it(?)
---
I like the idea of charging a righteous orb for a run as a minimum + usual looting rights.
---
I can see that being profitable
---
That was me. Yesterday. I slacked, already lots of eagles around.
---
So what I’m hearing is it doesn’t matter at all what pet you have they are all basically the same for PvE other than the skills they can be taught.
---
Look at all the stupid replies arguing with him about irrelevant stuff like the Briarwood Reed droprate.
---
So this is what they mean by "hybrid tax"
---
"lol you must be a chick"
---
What, one shield alone that made paladin tanking viable? For what, entire expansion? Seriously?
---
To quote my old Rift raid leader, "these things shouldn't even look at me".
---
Can you actually report people? I picked a lockbox for a guy yesterday then he whispered me "lmao get cancer retard" and put me on ignore. Had no option to report him when right clicking his name in chat.
---
Warrior is probably the most dynamic class in the game. It requires a lot of really nuanced skills to be effective.
---
No one should be Dark Pact in raids because you can't have Ruin with it
---
Clearly I was waiting to get crucified for it first.
---
The reference I can find doesn’t strongly support my case:
---
https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Lying_Character_Screen
---
I remember back in the day, reading elitistjerks.com, that folks would test off combat logs rather than trust the values on the character screen.
---
Thats... a lot of runecloth. how long did it take you to farm it all?
---
Main spec is he is a sword rogue. Thats his spec. PVP is a part of the game.
---
I'm a druid main in both retail since BC and in Classic and I love my rogue man. It's probably the most fun I have leveling in Classic so far and I've got every class going.
---
Oh shit that's awesome! Here I was using the old archived site this whole time.
---
it has 26 stam which is really good in pvp, in pve peacemaker is better
---
See you at Scarlet Monastery. May the Chapeau bless you, brother of the cloth.
---
This happens to me all the damn time. I decline group invites and then they harass me until I block them. My ignore list is 95% rogues that didn’t react well to not grouping. The other 5% is other classes that didn’t react well to not grouping.
---
I can respect that. Out of curiosity, what's your level/time played?
---
I generally try to, but I forget about it a lot and it is a negligible boost in dps anyway.
---
Yikes, I don't understand how something like this would even bother someone lmao
---
If you want to have options probably play a warrior, then. It’s not like feral dps but it at least gives you the option to tank
---
Ron Magill once said “The Bald Eagle is just a buzzard with a good PR agent”
---
If you can pull appropriate sized groups, and know when to cancel the proc, I would argue the ravages is a great 2h for tanking.  Some of my most successful and quick runs through SM have been with myself as a tank and my ravager leading the way lol.  
---
To call it toxic is silly, while it might not be ideal you have to remember this is vanilla and 9/10 times tanking doesn’t go as smoothly as you think it should. The ravager has saved me countless times and although I have a great sword and shield I find the 2h axe with the proc is far more effective most of the time.
---
no way dude no one multiboxes raids lol you wouldn't get quest credit
---
By looking at art? 😅
---
What sad individuals. I had someone whisper me to group to share kills for a quest and ended up playing with them for about five hours with plans to do so again tonight. 
---
Being kind costs nothing and it makes the game so much more fun.
---
in a pug I agree its a good idea to roll need so everyone gets a shot but that is not at all what you said which I still say is a shit opinion regardless.
---
I mean him being an ass aside, you say you already gave him an answer, but he seems pretty confused at why you didn't want it. A simple "thorns doesn't work well for what I'm doing right now" or whatever reasoning you have could alleviate some of this kind of shit.
---
My healing experiences in dungeons so far were completely chill with Greater Heal and Prayer sometimes. Nevertheless occasionally I like to just spam renew on anyone so I can take a look at my phone for example 😅
---
Yes, these quests can be done in a raid group. No issues on the other three
---
This need to be tested and added to the (awkwardly long) druid bug list in the US bug forum. If this turns out to be true there is a serious discussion to be had about the buggy state of some classes in Classic.
---
I wish my project car only consumed $1500/year.
---
Wow it’s a joke
---
i'd say if an hour of your time helping someone is a lot to you then this is a real shit game for you to pick up.  at level 60 you should expect to spend a lot of time on activities with no chance of actually progressing your character like going back through getting people attuned to stuff (over and over) and doing farm runs of stuff you already got BiS from.  
---
If it's just some random guy from trade chat?  yea expect to pay money.  If it's somebody from your guild?  This kind of thing is how bonds are formed, you help people out.
---
Can we ban those posts now? They're clogging up the feed
---
Why don't you want Thorns?
---
Get out as soon as possible. Don't explain anything, don't discuss anything. Be friendly to everybody just say that this guild is not for you.
---
Wish everybody good luck and all the best and hit the road real fast and never look back.
---
Hah
---
I like that weakaura for applying battle shout, i need to do that!
---
I bet that chafes like a bitch
---
Surprised you survived his whirlwind wearing metal panties
---
I am sure very, very low lol. I got the second TF in my guild in vanilla many months in, but I tend to be pretty damn lucky with rare drops. I also had Swift Zulian! I got Swift Zulian in WOTLK before they made them unabailable, though. But still very lucky! I am not very lucky IRL except for raffles, so maybe that is the trade off LOL
---
Dude, this will destroy your back and your neck
---
Wrong, click on the picture and look at the bottom of the image, OP states that you can have another lock summon with the orange items and save yourself 250g (which is correct) but he is stating everything else on the list equals up to 150g which for my realm at least is way under
---
I played BFA and the city hubs are a fucking mess. Dalaran in WotLK was amazing for these types of hidden secrets. Then they fucked it up in legion. It became flanderized.
---
lvl 44 Druid visiting Teldrassil when a low level gave me his thorns buff. I clicked it off after he passed because it was basically useless and I would just rebuff myself if I wanted. That's when the tells start.
---
Depends on your priorities. but typically mount is used for pvp and herb/mining. Devilsaur is used for raiding, farming prebis and farming gold. So usually I'd say get prebis before you get mount, unless if your mount is used for making gold.
---
So, that encapsulates neatly everything wrong with private companies.
---
Insecurity.
---
I always get annoyed and occasionally say out loud 
---
"Why bother? Have you not seen the shit I've killed in raids?"
---
Just out of curiosity, is there a particular reason you want to go there? Good views etc ?
---
Although, to be fair "did you just get here?" "ye" implies that you are just starting your journey there, not ending it.
---
If you're insisting on leveling your professions at a low level, you're willingly making things harder for you. That's fine, but you'll have to deal with the consequences of your choices, one of them being that you're dependent on the people who spent their time leveling instead of training professions. 
---
And 99% of the time, you do not have to make a choice to sell mats or keep them to level your professions, because you won't be able to use a vaaaaaaast majority of the items you loot while leveling for your own professions. Wicked Claws are a good example - unless you're specifically planning to be able to craft the Lionheart Helm or the Wolfshead Helm, you will not need them. You can't use them to train your professions because they're literally only used in two high level recipes. Yet you find them all the time while leveling. Right now, they go for around 50s a stack on my realm, and their price will go up quite a bit in the following weeks. 
---
So yeah, if you're playing at least a bit economically efficient, a leveling player is going to benefit from the increase in price. If you're willingly buying mats off the AH while leveling, good for you, but that's simply not a smart way to do things, and the release of DM and it's (completely overblown, considering people are farming ZF and Mara like stupid) effect on the economy isn't going to change this.
---
Yeah I've been wondering if I should use a BoE Headband that has just +44healing or the Soothsayer Headdress (25Int, 8Spirit, 7Stamina) as a shaman
---
"For fun" aka. to sell level 60 chars or to use them so farm gold and sell that.
---
Honestly, I loved turning all those quests in shimmering flats. Such a satisfying feeling.
---
This should work. You may have to bite the bullet and use a mod. Too much going on to get it to function without it. You could try to druid discord and ask in there, maybe someone has some insight.

We put up with the Warrior leveling experience, we've earned it.
---
It basically makes your character five times as powerful as it would normally be.  Many would argue, myself included, that's it's cheating, but it makes Blizzard more money so they don't care.
---
Wait, what does that mean? How is that possible?
---
 Yes, that's true. Another way to word that is a steamer is spending his time in game doing something he enjoys. 
---
Are you trying to make a point? Because if so, I'm missing it.
---
Because you only do WSG and no one has speed forms yet. Mages dont have blink, druids dont have travel form or fast cat form, shaman, hunters etc.
---
Everyones using base move speed with speed enchants on boots.
---
I was thinking that but I’ve heard leveling a warrior is bullshit lol.
---
this isnt inherently funny, but for some reason this is funny
---
Everyone except the MT should be on a DKP or rotation system. If you want to Loot Council gear the MT first out of the other warriors, fine by me.
---
OH
---
It's an English thing. Why would keyboards for a language that uses no accented letters have easily accessible keys with accented letters?
---
Most mature adults learn how to deal with and accept rejection.
---
It’s clear the person we are discussing hasn’t done that. 
---
Re: the baby comment. I think you’re projecting much more than you realize man. I was just pointing out a simple fact that contradicted yours. Not really a big deal. Take care.
---
You can modify your config to set the realm it will load up automatically fairly easily.
---
I'll addon to part 1.   If the loot council is clearly stated in a way like, we want our main tanks and most reliable healers geared first because most vanilla content isn't a dps race then Loot council shouldn't be a big deal.    Otherwise yeah there can be a lot of red flags in leadership this way.
---
BTW i would love to this yours. To see an other exemple to work again on mine !
---
Imagine being called a shit healer by a game master 😂😂
---
Man those are some bad lands!
---
Battleshout no longer generates more threat ever since they fixed it about a month ago.
---
It's not *my* doomsaying, I'm just summarizing the complaints from the bigger threads. You don't agree with the idea that a dungeon being released early might be a sign that other content will be released earlier than expected as well? That doesn't seem like a particularly crazy theory to me, though obviously it's all speculation at this point.
---
So far, all of my friends are adamantly committed. We have almost all hit 60, and our first guild raid will be this weekend. It’s sad that your friends didn’t stay committed. Hopefully once they see you having fun they will come back.
---
Any loot system involving subjective decisions is doomed to collapse. I cant believe its 2019 and people havent realized this
---
I am mistaken my bad
---
Haven’t seen this in a while lmao
---
there's a big difference between offering to chip in 10g and being charged as if you were just any other rando.
---
But with money being tight would it be that big a difference? Was thinking edgemasters as I can use them in the future to wield any drop I want, vs boe axes which I’ll vendor as soon as I get ony drop.
---
I can’t find anything to support this. Is there someplace you can reference to verify this? As far as I’m aware, if you are in combat with a mob, you are on its threat table. If you’re in combat with a mob, and healing you do will generate threat.
---
To me it sounds like the OP was dealing with a bug that only used damage as a factor for allowing them to loot the mob.
---
Please take your ps4 and pc off the carpet lol it could seriously fuck them up
---
The only one what?
---
One of the worst things to come from Reddit. In MY day, we used context clues to recognize sarcasm.
---
And if it resists ur dead.  My frost mage can solo epics up to 3 np
---
The fury warrior meta and mage popularity imo has made people not really be as drawn to rogues at the moment. There are still a lot, but I see far less of them than I did playing original vanilla and a shitload more dps warriors.
---
I main a tank aswell and I’ve also found that I am more effective with a 2h currently. Specifically the ravager lol
---
screenshot or it didnt happen
---
Why devilsaur and edgemasters?
---
Looks like something I expect to see in barons chat haha, was flying over the other day and heard some guy like "I'm going to pour acid on your face" and I'm like hmm just a normal day in barrens chat!
---
i weapon, and stance swap for stuff like whirlwind and executes
---
Thunderfury-Alliance, and yeah people don't tend to do this. Most people are super helpful.
---
Unless you soley want to be killed by hunters and rogues 29 is the way to go. So much more diversity and skill.
---
people deal with rejection lots of different ways. sending people tells for example is how I would do it. meh, have a good one.

---
This is the funniest comment I've seen in ages.
---
Ya I'm super pumped to hit 60 and mind blast mofos lol
---
My take is that Loot Council is used for more casual guilds that don't have someone to track Attendance, contribution, and such. If nobody wants to step up and provide open statistical evidence of contribution then it's basically up to a council to subjectively decide. Seems (and likely is) unfair to a lot of people who's experience with other players in the guild may differ.
---
Anecdotally, had a player that was amazingly helpful whenever the guild leaders were on. But a complete asshat when they weren't. As such he got councilled a lot of gear because he was such a great help. It always bewildered people that played when the leaders weren't on, until we started noticing the pattern.
---
That said, I think they work well for casual guilds that don't have people to step up to track things like attendance. BUT, I honestly thing the only things that should be council'd are MT gear, recipes, and things like bindings. Possibly heal gear, but that should be based on attendance. ALL DPS gear should be available for roll, with the possible priority of people that are about to hit a set bonus.
---
yup this has happened to me a few times, some very entitled children on my realm.
---
Devilsaur will be with you for a long, long time, unless you get incredibly lucky in your first MC runs.  They are pre-raid BiS.
---
I am still fighting the good fight. The past few days have been better, I joined the best guild on the server and have been seeing a fair number of Allys questing about recently, more than last week. Horde are still numerous but not as aggressive lately. (Still getting attacked, but not grouped up on). I also respecced to output more damage, so hopefully that will help me defend myself more effectively. 
---
As far as being level 60... I don’t think there is much to do without a group in end game anyway, so hopefully my guild will provide me good company when I get there.
---

&gt; MS &gt; OS
---
&gt; I don't think I'll be using them in PvE
---
How fucking dare he remove it! Never seen such ingratitude in my life 😂
---
it's also 10 times harder to work with, i coudlset up anything i ever wanted in powerauras in an hour, in weakauras it's a huge mess, it does too many things and the layout is tedious
---
As a 51 hunter, it's a goddamn fun class
---
I used the poop metaphor because it’s s simple one that’s easy to understand. 
---
I legit feel bad for you. Might help to learn how to deal with being wrong, and rejection. You’re clearly fucking terrible at it. Based on your responses.
---
Considering my goal coming in was to simply clear MC. I'm not terribly concerned with gear, but I empathise with your frustration as I'm a father and full time worker.
---
Anyone find it odd that the OP acts as the person who removed the thorns yet the screenshot is from the perspective of the person giving the thorns?
---
as a warrior I feel like 15g an hour farming sm is good lol
---
Essentially, when the people handing out the gear aren't entitled, Loot Council works.  They have a better idea of the overall guild and know where the major improvements are while also rewarding the long term members.  Handing gear to the officers because 'they are the officers' is a red flag.
---
They multibox just for the memes
---
It is literally impossible to get arcane crystals to make the arcanite bars on my server rn. They are 70g a piece on the AH and are immediately bought out when they get put up
---
Other way around for me : 
---
There was a lvl 20 priest farming in Hillsbrad nearby and i happened to find a +9 spirit chest as a rogue, so i just helped him finish his mob, and opened trade to give him the item.
---
He then proceeded to insult me for preventing him to sustain (not sure what he meant by that, probably some priest ability), and ignored me aswell, saying "why do people keep doing that stuff"
---
Yeah i wonder why people keep trying to be nice to you, asshole.
---
Ya we use a dkp system with erosion, explicitly designed because they want people bidding and getting loot, even reserve option to demote to casual raider if you never bid on things. Basically don't want people boarding waiting for one specific item to drop but rather roll on every gear for your class that don't have yet and eventually you'll win something.
---
Is that tested and proven accurate? I just wrote what the last past had and did a quick verification from an old Evil Empire forum post. They seemed to think you could reclaim the lost glancing glow damage.
---
The glass cannon meta is not always your friend.
---
*Especially* in pvp and fights with AoE damage.
---
LOL this whole thing started because I called you out for being selfish and suddenly that in itself is toxic? have any other  buzzwords you wanna add into this convo we are missing?
---
Sounds like you broke the law.
---
Like I said before. Thread is about math and facts. Not assuptions. You say that I have issues, sorry sir but if thats not „antagonistic tone” for you then well... you have issues
---
I know that's an exaggeration but it definitely feels that way.
---
Except for Nintendo.
---
Yeah, that's a guild with seriously bad leadership.
---
When loot rules aren't clearly spelled out, what ends happening is that loot will be given out on a "buddy system" where the officers get loot first, then their buddies, and lastly the quiet people who don't suck up to the officers might eventually be able to fight over the scraps.
---
I highly recommend moving to a guild that does a DKP system, or some other raid-participation tracking system, so that there's zero question about when somebody has earned their loot.
---
Been an mmorpg vet for almost 20 yrs, but never played wow til now. This is the only game I've played where loot is always an issue, and everyone is greedy. Other than that, great game - I can imagine there was some humility and shame back on vanilla but not so much now. Still, great game other than that.
---
pm
---
Yes!!  Hup two three four, keep it up...
---
Oh I am fully aware of why it is easier than the true, Vanilla, first release. Doesn't change what I am saying though.
---
I wish it came later so people would run some dungeons.
---
Then def. go priest(or shaman). Paladin is purely support/defensive, priest can be both offensive and supportive at the same time.
---
Why didn’t it go out?!
---
aux/auctioneer will show single stacks by the same poster as one listing you can expand to see all the single stacks.
---
As there's no way to obtain pvp gear atm, the best way is to start collecting gear in end-game dungeons. You should google bis and pre-bis gear for your class, there are lists online for each one. Basically, you should pre-bis now in 5-mans after which you have a choice to stop there or continue with raiding to get bis.
---

---

---
Oh God I hope you're joking.
---
The serious discussion happened during the early 2000s. It's a well known fact that each class was lucky to have one working PvE spec and one working PvP spec, if that. This is the experience, working around the bad, working out and using what's good, and abusing anything that's just a bit, just a *smidge* too good.

Vanilla content absolutely is a dps race. Healers being geared is fairly trivial. Main Tanks and dps should be loot prio. Stuff dies faster healers oom less. Vael itself is a literal dps check. If an item is bis for a dps and bis for a healer that stuff should go to dps first.
---
0.00136 is not 1% but 0.1% similarly 0.00761 is not 7-8% but 0.7-0.8%.

What is with the horde ganking circlejerk up at SM? I play on a PvP server and went there yesterday to start grinding graveyard as a 30 Warlock and it was ridiculous trying to summon and get the group gathered. I dont understand the mentality it takes to waste your own time griefing people when you literally get nothing for doing it. Is this par for the course outside every instance 30+?
---
Damn, those last few lines were like poetry
---
not sure what you mean? if you spend 20 min getting all your grp mates stuff and none of yours, then he leaves you have to spend another 20 mins getting your stuff now. or just spend 20 mins alone and you're good
---
Depends on how much +healing you're getting form other sources. How big a chunk of your mana pool you'd be losing with that 25 int. And if you're down ranking a ton, which I would recommend (look into coefficients for lower rank heals). I'd recommend giving this a watch:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBDfRiB1Zlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBDfRiB1Zlk) 
---
If you're down ranking and you aren't constantly running out of mana, then maybe switch to the +healing helm.
---
That's pretty much what I ended up with for the healing set.
---
I cant bring myself to equip gear without white stats. 
---
Sure, if you and everyone around you plays perfectly you can go for max +damage or healing for throughput.
---
In reality, people are going to make mistakes and that glass cannon outfit means you're going to die more often.

wow and my pug had issues with like 20 people in prebis
---
mechanics are hard am i rite
---
I'm assuming there's only 31 people on the server, so there wouldn't be an active AH or anyone else on your faction to interact with.
---
The server is obviously hypothetical because guards can't attack, I don't know why there would be an active population on a server with no city guards.
---
Also if there is a population on this server main cities could still be considered a safe area. Surely your faction would fight invaders in your capital city.

Releasing content too fast will kill the classic player base faster than pushing it back a little. Its not like classic has endless amounts of repeatable content.
---
I mean technically, with enough money, they probably could. 
---
I mean how much would it cost to buy WoW from Blizzard?
---
In my opinion, people who use these kind of insults sincerely never really care about the literal definition of the word. They just latch on to whatever trending stereotype to justify their hate, and confirm their prejudices. You have to take it all facetiously most the time they're either meming or what I said above and not worth treating seriously.
---
Make sure your healer isn't getting hit. Don't use all your rage up, make sure you've got some so you can taunt mobs attacking healers and squishy people. Use target of target so you know when you've lost aggro. Rely on Revenge and Sunder Armour to build aggro. Let the DPS know that you need time to build aggro and rage, don't let them nuke targets immediately otherwise you won't have aggro and therefore no threat.
---
my question might be stupid but hey, here goes.
---
If I remember right, pirates are lvl about 45.
---
Deep borers in maraudon are 46-48.
---
Why would you be aoe farming in a super popular questing zone with sky high competition, when you could be farming deep borers in maraudon alone for more xp and more gold ?
---
Guess it depends on the raid leader's ability to herd a bunch of cats XD
---
On bosses it can be useful but for trash mobs I don't think they live long enough to make up for the damage eviscerate would do.
---
thx, pretty useful guide safer than a lot of farming places. Will def try that.
---
In retail I really enjoyed Prot Paladin Tanking
---
How would leveling wanting to Tank and Paladin work? in Classic? In retail I just slap heirlooms on and blaze through Dungeon finder. I'm aware that pointing tank talents would make open world questing a bit shit.
---
I really enjoy the class fantasy of Protector / Sword and board / Holy. Also I think Consecration is cool.
---
No cloth dresses, I exclusively want Sword and Shield tanking. How would I go about this? Should I talent Ret? Consecration is kind of mandatory for tanking, do I put points into Holy until 20 so I can get it and then start Deadmines? Will I be shoehorned exclusively into healing if I ever decide to raid? Is there any armor, now or future, that isn't cloth that works for Paladin in a raiding environment?
---

MTs on patch get hit for 2k every few seconds. You have no clue what you are talking about. OT is the important part for soaking hateful strikes. And druids can do both. In fact walking into naxx for the first time having 3 druids tanking patch would be preferred because your close to full body from aq40 and bwl due to how itemization works and will be pushing more threat than any warrior possible so your dps can go ham.
---
Right? I'm 7 days played on 5 characters. Plenty of enjoyment for the cost.
---
Question - when Honour and BG's are eventually added, will XP locks be included, too? Otherwise people won't be able to twink for very long (good), unless XP wasn't added to BG's in Vanilla?
---
Considering doing this. Any issues fitting through doors?
---
Idealy you would never get a nonaxe drop as an orc, even if you had edgemasters, and deepwounds+flurry axe is basically same cost as edgemasters but more dps, and flurry axe(if not bis) remains a great offhand for when you get deathbringer.
---
I've seen enhancement shamans do very well, basically able to tank, dps or heal at lower levels, without an issue. Very solid all rounder imo, and very strong raid healer if you go that path.
---
If you are oom how do you get into cat form?
---
Didn't think I needed to just come out and say it but yes, yes I am.
---
Except for the fact that I'm still playing thus farming the end game zones like Silithus, Winterspring and Eastern Plaguelands. 
---
We weren't discussing quest routes but farming areas.
---
You work during what time? All but peak? If so its of course more contested but your personal experience during peak doesn't reflect reality. Also your server might just be full of open world farmers which isn't the case of all servers.
---
I just gave exact information on better farming spots, hoping it could help someone else. Honestly there are so many spots giving a lot more than 20g/h with good experience, I could mention 10 from the top of my head.
---
For every character I ever made in Vanilla/Classic, I just farmed SM. 
---
The mobs are humanoids so they drop cash and cloth. You can make heavy silk bandages with the cloth and vendor them for 40s unless your server’s AH pays more.  You’ll also see plenty of BOEs drop and get to greed on plenty of blues.

If your flair is accurate, you’re a warrior so finding a group for SM shouldn’t be too hard. You’ll probably hit 40 before you get 100g going this route.... but this is the route I’ve done and I personally like it :-).
---
(.....if you’re in a guild you could also probably get a loan)
---
On a pvp server yes
---
**Rule 5. No real world politics or religion**
---
Mountains in western Ashenvale was my thought too. And in case someone actually finds the path for the climb you can MC throw them off the cliffs and escape.
---
Hehe it’s MY secret spot!
---
We have similar goals, but I prefer the [sword-and-board look](https://i0.wp.com/media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/tcg-series2-007-full.jpg?w=600). Draconian Deflector and a nice sword is what I'm after.
---
I remember reading that it was an avg level of the group. So you as a 60 running two 30s have a total level of 120 and an average level of 40 so everyone in the group receives exp as if they were level 40 against what mob your killing. So if you are running as a 60 with FOUR level 30s the total level is 180 and the average level is dropped to 36. So your boosted friends will get more exp if they fill the group. Also heavily screws over low level runs but by the time they’re 30+ the exp loss is almost nothing.
---
i dunno exact term for casting something when only solo try.  
---
/dance [noparty]
---
Had the same problem around 55-57. Get your hands on every PuG you can and don't mind going to western and eastern plaguelands a bit early.
---
I too ponder race choice or visuals ha. I hope we can get the hair dresser in classic someday!
---
Why do you ask other people opinion instead of choosing yourself?
---
And yes, the latency IS real...
---
Mage does all of this better.
---
Hopefully the ones who've claimed they were leaving over this have already left and you won't get many of them here.
---
As a tank, if they insist on having the pet tank bosses, I let them. I also generally let the healer know to not stress about healing it. Once the pet dies, I'll get aggro back.
---
Super fast.
---
They dont want to be inappropriate
---
That shit is expensive. Gotta flex it.
---
Outside of SM, ZF, and BRD are common areas for world pvp. It’s all about denying the enemy valuable resources. This is why I didn’t choose a pvp server, that and I hate waiting on queue timers. If you don’t like it, roll on another server.
---
In fact, it's very clean, thanks
---
It's to indicate which servers still have layers. Eventually none of them will.
---
I can't speak for yesterday in particular, but Blizzard recently changed up their display to show 'Layered' instead of just 'High' or 'Full.'
---
"Dinged" never felt quite right, but "Dung" or "Dong" doesn't seem to fit, either.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say that it's because German uses the same alphabet as English, whereas Russian uses a different alphabet: Cyrillic.
---
Now feel bad for that thread title.
---
That'd make 70-30 faction pop servers even more unplayable then they are now.
---
\[Here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dfwcol/dreadsteed\_materials/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dfwcol/dreadsteed_materials/))'s a reddit version!
---
Big dick swangin'
---
My wild guess would be that most Rogue players were tryhards who are long 60 by now.
---
Or they're simply just not popular anymore since Warriors do more DPS with far less clicks.
---
I think it’s because you told them you were about to “get off”
---
Using Cleave over HS is an interesting idea for threat management.
---
I try to only use Heroic if I have like 70+ rage while still weaving hamstrings. Our tank has like no +hit in his cobbled together fire resist gear so I was trying to go real slow.
---
Awesome, I've been using IceHud but I prefer the look of that one.
---
Ice cream!!! Nooooooooo
---
One of my favorite wow memories is back during vanilla someone brought a diesease into ironforge, i believe it was an attack from a boss in a raid, but it constantly spreads. So the enemy was killed but this took out ironforge i was laughing my ass off.
---
Why buff higher level player of the same class?  Unless they don’t realize that you get better ranks of buffs as you level.
---
It was very simple, and yet you failed so mightily.
---
“I don’t understand this game”
---
That is correct, I made a oversimplification, it's 1% of your noncrit dps
---
Great job! I wish I could draw.
---
Kinda fucked up that rogues were allowed to role imo. But those were the rules set beforehand, so you shouldn't feel bad about it. Enjoy your loot!
---
Wait, where can you hand in runecloth for Rep? I could not find one for UC...
---
that just sounds liek you should move to a /roll, because if you are telling me I have to spend DKP whether I want to or not, i'd rather just not have DKP and just randomly assign all loot.
---
Feel you man, got mine a week ago
---
Thanks I feel good
---
Once saw a hawk eating a squirrel in a tree that was at eye level for me. Not a pretty sight lol. Flesh is.... stretchy
---
Hawt, and awesome!
---
Might as well go big and see what happens. The market will determine its worth.
---
I'm at 3days 16 hrs played and at 40... I'm not sure I'll make it to 60 playing 2 hours a day any time soon
---
And UBRS! Drakkisath drops the robe I believe
---
Are you talking about Sharptalon's claw?
---
UwU = downvote.
---
Which means I gotta downvote my own post.
---
Warlock and druid probably less popular than rogue for alliance, but feels the same on my server.
---
You are missing the point. I am cancelling to not only teach Blizzard their mistake but other companies. Think bigger picture. Honestly I’m at work and don’t care to go into more detail at this point :P.
---
it's why I had it reserved for 2 full weeks of farming for it in pugs I organised, looking for replacements constantly and scouting for Jed. Fun.
---
I was in a loot council system for years on retail during this period and i think it works out better overall (assuming your officers aren't knobs). I plan on doing a loot council with my guild, but i plan on gearing myself last, and having representation from each class to check me on things. Transparency is the key i think. 
---
Of course we need to actually get people to 60, so any LC wouldnt take shape in my guild till 3 or 4 months down the line....but im thinking ahead.
---
If I'm alliance I would do the Light of Elune quest for the item and jump of the edge of winterspring, hoping to land somewhere on the cliffside without fall damage and just afk for 24 hours.
---
If I'm horde I would probably glitch inside of Mount Hyjal or Caverns of time.
---
That's a little confusing since if they change 1.12 they will have to make that change to every other version of warcraft they plan to release on classic. It's unrealistic.
---
Even if they did that, each different version has a chance of reacting differently to any small changes and could actually damage or alter the experience in unintended ways.
---
That's the way one of my buddies was, he would always jump ahead and start doing the quests ahead of us.
---
Eventually I got sick of it and instead of farming, or leveling an Alt when he wasn't on I said fuck it, and just went off on my own, it was honestly much more enjoyable that way sadly.
---
[yeah thas a good look](https://i.imgur.com/5SshHTV.png)
---
We are missing 3 people in the raid and even had a couple pugs. Think we were just taking whoever was online.
---
Priest.
---
You make your own group.  Find a healer.  Whisper every priest and paladin in your level range.  Find a dps that wants to go with you.  Then whisper every paladin and warrior looking for a tank, they might have a friend with them so you want to keep a slot for two people.  Ask everyone in the group to ask their guilds.  Ask your guild.  
---
you have to go the extra mile since you rolled a DPS to find a group.  It is a cold day in hell when people post "LF DPS for Dungeon."
---
So im currently a combat swords rogue but im dying to try daggers. Ive never played wow before and this is my first char so I’m not sure how somethings work. But when you arent in a dungeon how do you deal with mobs? Isnt it slow since you cant backstab?
---
Most people are insecure and emotional to a surprising degree, especially these days. So it makes a lot of sense to throw in all kinds of assurances and empathizing before actually doing anything. (Or *not* doing anything, in this case)
---
We're the odd men out. The only communities I've been in that can operate on the assumption that people have thicker skin than a balloon are the military and the trades.
---
I actually farmed the ogres near Karazhan back in vanilla (as warrior) and got my epic mount that way. You're like the first other person I've seen confirm thats a good gold grind :D It was a "secret" spot back then
---
I’m the rogue and didn’t steal any of the lockboxes in this video. 
---
Would you like the screenshot from the GM also saying that I didn’t steal any of them?

Do a subreddit search.  It's supposed to be multiplicative with bear form.
---
21days total, 9days at lvl 60
---
Give it more time. Im sure blizz will either open more transfers to the server or merge the low pop servers together in future.
---
Classic. 40 people in raid, 2-3 items per boss. This ensures some people will not get loot week after week. This is why DKP sprung up. DKP rewards presence and intelligence in spending. It\`s actually pretty fair.  
---
Loot council can become easily corrupted, and round robin rewards fresh 60s and missing raid until your turn comes up.
---
BOOM!!! Grats!
---
What you are saying is true but Classic is not Vanilla, this stuff should work in 2019. When you read the bug forums regarding druids (or other classes, hunters and rogues come to mind) you'll also find a lot of stuff that actually worked back then and is buggy now - this is a huge problem. So no, this is not the experience.
---
I bought it at lv 51. I'm still using it at 60. It's a beauty, totally worth the golds.
---
No food left, sorry, I  already feed to many trolls
---
Yeah, i was amazed at how little cc is required if the dps isnt stupid and you have a tank.
---
Funny thing is, my small guild has been able to run multiple instances with no tank, and that actually requires cc. We did live strat the other day with 60 hunter, 60 priest, 58 mage, 58 priest, 56 rogue. It was actually a ton of fun
---
Yea I remember the pain very well , and the necessity of going to Dire Maul. But have fun with your Dread, one of best looking mounts certainly in Vanilla, now Classic and retail although no pain involved in getting it in retail.
---
None of the sets are specifically designed for the BM spec. They are more directed towards Marksmanship.
---
Cant tell you numbers untill i get home. I can surely tell you, that BS generates more aggro than demo (when 3+ party members are buffed). 
---
But there is a big but. You can tank aoe on BS alone. Maybe with some grenades it would be enough, BS alone barely gives you enough aggro so healer doesnt aggro mobs from you if hes constantly casting
---
thats entirely up to you.
---
Yes demo shout was to good before, and battle shout was to bad.
---
If you read blizzards own posts about it they clearly stated that they fixed battle shout, and yes battle shout is good now.
---
Exp to BGs wasn't added until much later, like in Wrath or something. There won't ever be exp in BGs and there likely will never be an exp lock.
---
I have the sudden urge to draw Whitemane on a leash while my character sits on a throne made of vendor trash.

i usually hate desert zones (i f\*\*\* hated elona desert crystal in GW1), but Tanaris, despite being a desert, felt so... alive !

Fuck it, I'm out.  This is not what I signed up for.

I was gonna say they walk like a t-rex from Jp.
---
Okay you know what, this dude is douchier than Sylvanas! I’m not even gonna look for those erotic RP realms.
---
This guy is a pathological liar. He didn't win the roll, the first guy that tried to skin that was gonna raid roll whatever dropped failed skinning. This guy jumped in, skinned the corpse, got the loot,  immediately HS'd and logged off. Later he split the gold he got by selling it with his GM so he would stfu. Stay away from this guy, don't invite him to your groups.
---
I put MOTW on them, and also Thorns if it's a tanky pet. A few people in a dungeon group had their mind blown, thought it was some 200 IQ play. :|
---
Guess growl is going on auto-cast.
---
I laughed way more than i should of...
---
Most ppl in this game is nice, but the ones that are not... Boi, oh boi... They r cRazY sHiT lEvEL of crazyness... Its sCarY
---
It’s been a strategy for warriors in vanilla for a long time, it’s a nice alternative to HS in those types of situations.
---
As a horde on Stalagg, I'm also considering this. Not sure what things will look like when world pvp starts, but I actually want something that resembles a fair fight.
---
That's not exactly what they fixed.
---
&gt; In addition, we’ve also identified a fix for a separate issue that was causing Battle Shout and most healing spells, effects, and buffs to incorrectly split the threat they generate between enemies that had members of the buffed party on their threat list.
---
The net result is "less threat", but this was being produced by a lot of different effects (for example, tossing Fort in the middle of a fight made mobs run over and beat you down).
---
I know I already did but I wanted to know what the community though of the “blizzard is a china puppet” thing
---
I also got one of these, I've been putting it up in the AH for the last few days at ~900g to see what happens.  I plan to do that for a week or so, and then drop the price to half and hope somebody with Auctioneer thinks they can flip it for an easy 200-300g profit.
---
It's more of a PVP weapon than anything else, so the market for it will be small until phase 2.
---
The straight DPS formula output is not the whole story for the effect attack power has on your damage. The higher top-end means bigger crits for MM hunters, and AP application to abilities like MS and AS means better damage for those abilities as well. 
---
It's a no brainer
---
I enjoy my server but I think I made a mistake in the long run rolling PVP. I'm absolutely terrible at PVP. If I beat anyone I fucking lose my mind. At 50 I beat a 60 rogue who tried to gank my leveling buddy and I. It definitely wasn't my mad skills that killed him...he was just terrible. I guess there's room for improvement on my end in some ways, but I can't help my physical limitations; they will always be a hindrance. 
---
I prefer PVP in a caged environment. But it's too late to go back now.
---
What the heck location is this? I work for Costco and I've NEVER seen the steel that empty in any location ever.
---
If you're close to level I don't see why not if you plan on equipping it.
---
Yes you will get the ability to roll on items that are too high level for you.
---
Not at all. 
---
Plenty of people are only in the 20s-30s with their ONLY character and many others who hit 60 already are starting their alts.
---
The type of person who mains horde is weird. Usually they’re super social yet, they can be nice, but can also be huge assholes like this guy. There’s a weird variety in their population
---
Yeah, this is very true. I have put up an updated post and included an actual BiS list on a new tab in the spreadsheet. I've made sure to state that Briarwood Reed is hard to obtain, and put up alternatives.
---
I initially included it because it meets the criteria I set myself (BoP and not a random enchant). I must admit, I more than likely overlooked the difficulty in obtaining it because I already have it, and I made this list for myself.
---
You'll be fine. Play what you enjoy.  Or really play both. Keep up your rested on your druid. Both are great. Some places I prefer a druid over a warrior. Like Strath live side for example.
---
nice
---
For the horde!
---
I mean what, may I enquire, were you thinking on that day when you conjured up for a man like me a robe that looks so gay?!?
---
I think raid debuffs were coded to only be active in their respective instances after the [Corrupted Blood plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident). Pretty sure this part of Vanilla was patched in Classic.
---
True that

This guy starts with a statement, then turns it into a question? ^(/s)
---
You can interpret this in so many ways:
---
Question: Is it possible to change a server from PvP to Normal by paying Blizzard \[enough money\]?
---
Question: Is it possible to change \[my character's\] server from PvP to Normal \[by\] paying Blizzard?
---
Statement: It is possible to change a server from PvP to Normal by paying Blizzard \[enough money\].
---
He's using the old QQ'S method of communication.
---
It will appear yes
---
You can roll need even if ure lower lvl than the req
---
**Corrupted Blood incident**
---
The Corrupted Blood incident was a virtual pandemic in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, which began on September 13, 2005, and lasted for one week. The epidemic began with the introduction of the new raid Zul'Gurub and its end boss Hakkar the Soulflayer. When confronted and attacked, Hakkar would cast a hit point-draining and highly contagious debuff spell called "Corrupted Blood" on players.
---
The spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines.

I reaaaaaally would advise against worrying about something like that. There will always be groups for raids, and they're not releasing content super fast. If you really like tanking and want to be the best tank in the game, do it.

my issue is mostly the matter of not needing shifts to switch functions, since i have that Razer gaming keypad with all the cool buttons.

Hey my man. Counter to that point, the GM I talked to definitely says you did NOT hold up your end of the bargain :) [https://gyazo.com/e00d0f0940ece7421c7499cb19f6318a](https://gyazo.com/e00d0f0940ece7421c7499cb19f6318a)

You seem very lucky. Ima need you to join my party. Haha

lmaoooo multishot is part of my single target rotation though!!
---
Oh yeah. There was a 40 man boomie multiboxer on one of my old servers and you died FAST. Had to outdo him with numbers mostly.
---
Below vendor price basically.
---
You're fine.  Average levels are around 30-40ish.  Those of us that are already 60 and raiding are just ahead of the population curve.
---
Negligible disadvantages. You're just salty that we get our mount for half price.
---
Stunning and brave.
---
Earth shock can be reduced to a 5 second cool down and we have grounding totem that redirects spells. You’ll have to learn to juke cast and create a target grounding totem/wand macro.
---
You dont have to spend it, you just can't hoard it. 
---
If you don't spend it you will always stay in the first spot.  But once you do spend it it will fall back.  Not "I came to every raid of MC and therefore I will always be able to win every item I want from BWL and AQ, and no new guild member will ever be able to recieve an item that I want."
---
OwO
---
Same for me. I just hit 40 on my priest when I heard spineless Blizzard's decision. Was about to run to sen jin and buy my mount on the following day but decided instead to cancel sub and uninstall all blizz products. Shame, really, I was having a lot of fun and convinced my friends to play as well.
---
Yeah that was basically it. I transferred to heartseeker cause I know phase 2 will be a shit show.

Awesome!

lmao, I never thought of it like that but this is definitely what I do and how I gauge if the other people around have seen me. I kind of love it.
---
You'll be re-subbed within 2 months.
---
I actually pike the deadzone mechanic. It makes distance managing fun.
---
The problem is the dumbass melee leeway they added in. Why even have a deadzone when melee can hit you as soon as they get in it? Melee leeway means you only really have a deadzone vs casters.
---
so ironfoe and deathbringer together will be more efficient?
---
thanks for clarification!

I was able to need a lvl44 2-H mace at lvl 42, and once I hit 44 started to use it

Love it.

I had to repost cause I was to vulgar lmao damn bro u ok!? Lmfao
---
Warriors can effectively farm all the scarlet monastery dungeons as fury or arms. If you're fresh 60 with bad gear you can do gy/lib, once you have some pre-bis and raid gear cath is the best. With diremaul coming in a few days more gold farming options will be available too.
---
*revive
---
What server? Lmao
---
Jumping on this, Tanaris is a fun zone, so highly reccommend doing the quests there then hitting Feralas if you want more.  Badlands is pretty good, I would do that before Tanaris, but quests were more bland and lots of competition at the elementals.  Also found that Badlands was more PVP heavy than even STV, maybe just me.
---
Yeah exactly. Lots of competition for stuff but I get by
---
Never have such feelings of love and hate lived in my being until now.

tho there also isnt much demand

Rogue is probably the one class I have felt like there is less of compared to vanilla. 
---
Back in vanilla the stereotype was all the "edgy" kids rolled rogue cause they could stealth and were the best gankers. There was never any shortage of rogues back in vanilla, especially evil ganking ones
---
Now it seems like all the kids rolled mage so they can be l33t AOE farmers.
---
Ok bye
---
Yeah so they have a spell called earth shock which is an instant cast. It has a 6 second cooldown but it interrupts and prevents spells from that school for 2 seconds, so technically it’s a 4 second cooldown or interrupting a specific spell. Super annoying.
---
Flash of light + Blessing of light is great for healing
---
alliance so no just very little input from the raid lead and I wasn't supposed to say anything
---
The great money maker for warriors is to level to 60, become a tank, and literally get into any dungeon or raise whenever you want. Watch and laugh as the DPS cry lfg for an hour.
---
This is my feelings around it as well, breach your contract you're gonna get fired I dont care how worthy you feel the cause is. This whole Blizzard HK situation has seemed to me like a massive reddit karma circle jerk.
---
While youre at it get rid of your iphone

You don't have dead keys? Keys that you press before a letter that doesn't do anything on their own, but will put an accent on letters.

In any case, this "people shouldn't be allowed to use accents" is an incredibly arrogant and anglocentric mindset.
---
pleasing? to be honest, priest is the class I've always enjoyed leveling. you're rarely stopping, health and mana tend to be 70+% all the time thanks to spirit tap, they are generally left alone even in the most murderous pvp areas. finding dungeon groups is easy, healing them is even easier, see below.
---
/u/LiterallyMrRogers wrote probably [the best priest leveling guide ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/), I'd urge any wannabe priests to give it a read. the preferred order is going mostly holy with the talents till 40+ then respecing into deep shadow, because shadow talent mostly suck before that, and it gives you amazing healing prowess. only thing I'd disagree with is his rotation - starting with holy fire is fucking awesome and gets way better results, not to mention meshes better with spirit tap.

Honestly I don’t think it’s worth much... unless you’re a pally tank MAYBE?  Just think who needs spell casts when they’re using melee...  and even so most pally casts for tanking are instant, no?  It’s cool you got an epic sadly it’s one of the lame ones that isn’t very useful
---
So I guess you also think Classic has great class balance and quest design? Really dumb to think it’s perfect and even dumber to think if someone doesn’t think so they should be playing retail.
---
Stunning and brave
---
Finally being a poor sap payed off :^)
---
I’ve only played horde since B.C. launch. And I’d never go back to ally... mainly due to liking the city’s and character types. But when your playing a game based on war isn’t it just appropriate to slaughter your opposition? Ionno I kill on sight and will keep killing on sight. But I won’t jump u if your fighting a mob. That’s just dirty.
---
My bad, I was being a dumbass. I forgot humans have both. 
---
 I’m not sure what you mean by efficient, but I would guess it’s probably more dps if you make up for it with some extra hit gear.

holy crap, where do you ppl play? never encountered anyone remotly like this, yet
---
If you level as shadow and lookup good wands to get its easy. 0 down time for mobs at your level. And can fairly easily get mobs 2-3 levels higher with little work. Also has the benefit of never being at low health cause you'll always be using power word shield
---
Lol no.
---
It’s amazing for pvp. Massive raptor strikes, 26 stam, 2% crit and some int too.
---
It’s BIS for pvp you doorknob
---
Rip, not my classic
---
Nice, could you post a link of Druid/ Paladin tanking for science?
---
Same. Going to assume a video is not needed
---
Buy them all and repost for 1g. /r/stonks
---
Ok so 2 weeks.
---
Well if a guild wants to carry them, that’s their decision.
---
Mage is pretty terrible at getting iconic gear, because there's 10 other mages wanting the same stuff.
---
I'm already lvl 60, I concess I should have mentioned it.
---
The great white kodo is a magnificent beast
---
&gt; At first the loot system seemed fine. It's set to master loot, you roll on items that you need, and if you win you can't roll again until everyone in your class has gotten something. Sounds fair to me.
---
This system is typical for casual guilds, teams starting out with a new ungeared roster, PUGs, and any team that doesn't have the time to keep track of loot distribution or point systems. In other words, it works fine for about 99% of raid teams in most situations, and it's fair enough that pretty much everyone can live with it all the time.
---
Is it common or how most guilds work? I mean, most guilds that want something fair that works and is easy for everyone to understand and manage, yeah. But there are a lot of guilds that only exist to funnel gear to a "core" of IRL friends at the expense of everyone else, who are basically just disposable semi-PUG labor drafted to carry the "core" through raids and farm gear for them.
---
The reason they made a "guild" to do this is because when they try this in a pure PUG everyone leaves after the first pull. No reason to act otherwise just because your shitty PUG has a nametag, but it's up to you. Either way, do not expect it to change. It won't, and over time it will get even more ridiculous as the content gets harder and the loot more desirable.
---
There are good reasons not to do this, like if you need to funnel loot to certain positions to beat tight gear checks, when you're pushing hard for firsts. Very few guilds actually have the talent to perform anywhere near the level where this is required. Certainly in MC at 1.12 levels of easiness, it is not needed.
---
That's why you spec natural shapeshifter for cheaper shapeshifting, then you use your last bit of mana for cat form. Obviously.
---
My comment also wasn't serious though, tbh.
---
True, there are two main reasons I picked Orc for my elemental shaman
---
1) Stun racial to assist in large group PvP where a stunned target == ded.  Even resisting a single charge, kidney shot, hunter pet stun, or cheap shot could potentially give me enough of an edge to nuke a target or escape.
---
2) Aesthetics.  I simply like the Orc animations more than the male troll animations.  
---
Granted I plan on making a 39 Troll Enhancement Shaman twink.  With no storm strike I want to get around missing the only melee ability, and stacking every source of IAS% would replace the functionality of PoD.  2% gloves, 1% helm, 1% legs, 3% weapon counter weight, up to 43% zerking, 30% flurry. With a 4.0 base speed weapon, all these little 1-3% add up significantly. All sources of IAS appear to stack multiplicative (PoE Fans eat your heart out with more multipliers!), but its never tested whether static sources of IAS% from gear enchants multiply each other.  Either way, troll zerking giving enhance 1 second lesser healing waves is incrdebily powerful, on top of proper timing with flurry, more than making up for lack of Storm Strike.
---
Yea, but farming lol that is highly class specific, isn’t it?
---
frostbite is one of the strongest single target and pvp talents
---
it absolutely fucks with blizzard and you should remove it from your bars if you have frostbite
---
You waste more of your own time by not grouping and enlisting in a tag war
---
Lmfao, imagine being this sensitive, oh well, have fun in your protective bubble
---
Yes you can.
---
Will whoever lose the roll to you bitch about it? Maybe.
---
It is, welcome to the real world where not everybody min maxes the shit out of everything :D.
---
Why do you need this info?
---
Or setup?
---
This happened to our healer as well on the green dragon. Ive only seen this bug happen on these dragon killing quests.
---
Ran MC with many of my guild members brought along with a larger guild. Loot rules were defined as roll for main spec, one item per run. Earthfury Bracers dropped and I rolled, the input other Resto Shaman did not. When asked by his guild why, that player explained that EF is only BiS if you have 8/8 and showed his bracers to be better. The RL also determined that my bracers were better and because I didn't have 5 or 6/8 EF that the guild would keep the bracers to AH them. Really I suspect they got funneled to that same Shaman once I was gone and they were just going to try to keep loot inhouse. My question is: do I have any course of action I can take to get the gear that I rightfully earned? Because at this point it feels like ninja looting at worst, and extreme greed and ignorance at absolute best. This is doubly frustrating because Boots of Prophecy dropped and all the Priests in their guild rolled. Okay well those definitely aren't BiS ever, 8 piece set bonus or otherwise, so wtf?
---
literally going full circle, where people behave toxically because their expectations of a non-toxic community "aren't met”
---
Just join a new guild.  I'm in a guild with nobody I knew before classic started and having a great time.
---
Since apparently warriors cant keep aggro without it, although u see streamers just skipping shield to go fury cuz it's so easy anyway and nobody ever get close in threath.
---
You can heal as disc, sounds like you just heard from an idiot.
---
allows you to automatically throw your bomb at cursor position, rather than getting the targeting circle and clicking.
---
Btw, if your MT got his own TF, you'll be able to use yours with no threat problem.
---
Gathering professions to be honest (herbalism, mining notably).
---
i know priests like to play around with it for instant Mind Controls.
---
Best mount.
---
Its a fine line you have to walk.  Hold threat and let people go all out and maybe die, or produce less threat and hope the dps watch their own threat..
---
&gt; It was a free roll, so tough titties.
---
Indeed.
---
I just had a flashback to when I played around the time of Burning Crusade's release. I was just AFK slightly outside of a village by Orgrimmar and came back to some random's /w asking if I wanted to party and then behaving like a little shit because I didn't respond. I mean at least the guy apologized when I got back and told him so but jeez. It was just a newbie zone.
---
Short answer: no. 
---
Long answer: generally I'll sell half my stuff in full stacks and the rest in short stacks. When people are leveling trade skills and doing crafting they usually don't want extras, and will pay a little bit more per item to not have a bunch of leftover mats. The fact that singles are more expensive isn't an oversight, it's a convenience fee for not having to buy 20 of something.
---
Lock this please
---
yeah i always try to quest alone as much as possible, if you group up with even one other person it becomes too easy
---
you can also see mana with raidframes...
---
You answered your own question.  Instead of controlling one character you are controlling five.  
---
So if I as a Shadow Priest roll up and cast Mind Blast on you, what would normally just take out a chunk of your health now probably one-shots you or come close because it's being cast five times.
---
I have become addicted to Classic, and sitting a lot was killing me. I mentioned it to my wife and she ordered me a stand up desk. I love this thing. I totally recommend it to stay the risk of blood clots from sitting for hours on end. The only thing that sucks is I can't straf in game when I stand up.
---
BiS can kiss my ass. Not everyone plays this game to min/max stats.
---
I have the opposite trouble. I've got my lvl 60 warrior in full prebis and I cant bring myself to level up my farming mage.
---
Swim pot 1G for how many?
---
Other companies won't care if you cancel your WoW subscription, it won't affect them in the slightest.
---
Cancel your subscription to hurt Blizzard, you do you, but don't think it will actually teach other companies a lesson.
---
There’s no focus in classic
---
I think best is farming kills for pure gold drops.
---
For example tyrshand elites drop 10-30 silver plus runecloth, greys for 1-2g, greens for 3-5g. 
---
If the good spots are all full, try low level dungeon solo - may even xp carrys for few gold.
---
I’m sorry that you had to see that.  That must have been horrible.   Coyotes come within a mile of my house, and I’m scared as heck of this happening.
---
The firing of the casters was a bit overboard as well as revoking his tourney winnings, imo. Granted I haven’t seen the video and if what some things I hear are true (the casters egged him on to say it) then maybe it’s not that overboard.
---
you can even buy BFA and other games by redemeing the tokens for 15 blizzard bucks. When I wanted to try multiboxing I found a reddit post explaining that (at the time) the most officiant gold farm was 4 druids spamming an AOE ability and a hunter pulling mobs into the AOE.  They explained that they started with a single account and farmed tokens to buy BFA for their 4 extra accounts. They claimed to be able to pay for all 5 accounts subscription with only 8-10 hours of farming.
---
It's okay, I'm sure you'll still like the game when you come back at a later date.
---
If you look, its showing that Esfand is the in the top 5 of DPS in Molten Core with ret.
---
It’s funny that you say this when to perform that well they have to min max the shit out of everything
---
I get what you are going for, but all in all it's just not great to think of buffs like that.
---
For instance, let's take the MotW buff. Are you saying that feral druids should get to count the MotW buffs they put on people as effectively more DPS? They should not, because there are also resto shamans, so it's not like if that feral druid wasn't there you wouldn't have the buff.
---
For similar reasons, people say things like "put nighfall on a shaman and they should get to count all that extra DPS as theirs", no, because you could put nightfall on a warr and they're still doing more damage than the enh. shaman would be doing. Or people say 1 SPriest is better than no SPriest; but again, you could have a 0/31/20 shadow weaving priest who will still function as a good healer but throw 5 rank 1 mind flays to stack up the shadow vulnerability and replace that DPS slot with a mage/lock instead.
---
You do get to count things like WF totem on shamans, trueshot on hunters, and boomkin auras because that's party specific. So you actually do need X shamans for your X melee groups; having multiple actually can matter.
---
In terms of general buff utility, yes that absolutely already is taken into account in other ways. They aren't counted towards DPS meters, but raid leaders should be well aware of what buffs they need or are missing; and the buff utility that people bring to a raid. That should really be treated as a totally separate reason to bring someone besides DPS; no raid lead is saying they want only warriors and mages in a raid because they have top theoretical DPS.
---
Loot council is both the best and the worst loot system. 
---
When it works, it ensures that the loot is distributed in the optimal way between raid members to provide the best possible upgrades and thus best raid progress.
---
When it doesn't work, some people get loaded with gear at the expense of others, drama ensues and the raid falls apart.
---
I'm currently in a guild that uses LC and I think they've been doing a great job so far. Loot is distributed fairly. Fingers crossed it keeps working that way.
---
You can [mod:xxxx] if you'd like.
---
Doing just [mod] allows you to use any one of them. So, that same macro will work regardless if you push alt shift or control
---
No, pretty sure they're bitching about people who want to party who can't get the message through their thick skull.
---
Would be a fun twink sword.  Youd be like a raid boss when the thing procs.
---
I've found its made me quite a bit of money with leveling as i go saving meats and vendoring the food i make. the cooked food vendors for significantly more than the meat vendors raw (even with spice costs)

I don't think [@focus] is a thing in classic.  Please tell I'm wrong because I really want focus.
---
It is removed from the economy via quest turn in for 75 rep per 20 cloth
---
weird that rogues weren't at the top.  Alo all of your melee could have had much more uptime.
---
You forgot the Shadowy Potion(s) 6g each.
---
Should only need 1, but on PvP servers you may need 2

hes right tho, the Chinese Communist Party is basically the state capitalist party these days

what makes you think people who roll horde are any different than people who play ally?
---
[https://youtu.be/lGZQi3ODB-U?t=16](https://youtu.be/lGZQi3ODB-U?t=16)
---
The only thing I've been annoyed with it for is Threat EP for Warriors , because it just shows pure Fury gear.
---
Whatever is within the loot rules. In this case they were free for all and so they were aquired. No reason not to accept them.
---
Do you buy “made in China”? If so, are you stopping?
---
A lot of people hit a wall when they reach 40. It's like you're almost there but there's still a long road ahead. Myself and my friends noticed that we were all getting bored of the game around that level but once you pass 50, the hype comes back. Especially between 55-60.
---
The subscription is prepaid. Whatever is paid for you’ll still have access to.
---
Druid shapeshifts are based on a percentage of your base mana. i.e. before any int bonuses are applied. A level 60 shapeshift to bear/cat always costs 684 without NS and 479 with. With that in mind, you will find HotW to be a better use of your talent points.
---
Tanking without the threat bonus from Feral Instinct and Savage Fury is not viable outside of early dungeons. You will never be able to hold aggro and it's simply not worth the ~1-2% physical damage reduction that Thick Hide provides.  Once you obtain a Warden Staff and a few good pieces of armor, you can tank any 5 or 10 man dungeon without issue even without thick hide.
---
Seen the same group the last 3 days on my server "LF TANK/HEALS LBRS. gems and blackcrow reserved"
---
The worst part? It's a warrior shouting about needing a tank to carry him. The entitlement is real.
---
Don't go 20/31, lightwell is useless and spirit buff is always good. 21/30 is pretty standard.
---
PI is fun in dungeons and mages/warlocks will love getting it, but in raids it's very situational since it basically amounts to ~1500 damage every 3 minutes.
---
no BGs until phase 3
---
Similar situation here.  The same group of guys I played with in high school started playing again.  Launch night we were all on Discord trying to figure out which server to play.  The first guy went back to retail the same week.  He gets off work during prime server hours and didn’t like waiting on the queue.  Two other guys lasted until 20ish.  At least we got to run Rfc and WC together one last time. 
---
Just myself and one other friend are left.  He’s 49 and I’m 47.  Problem is he works the opposite shift as I do so we haven’t got to group up much.  I’ve devoted a serious amount of time to the game to the point that I’m falling behind on other projects and not spending as much time with the family.  I’m gonna have to break the news to him that I can’t continue playing.
---
Hmm okay. Well seems people are smashing the raids anyhow, just wondering if it's a classic change or just very theoretical theorycrafting in vanilla.
---
healbot or vuhdo for heals and why?
---
Idk about that particular instance but ive found that women who play WoW can be pretty weird, more socially than mechanically though so idk why the guy whispering the OP said that.
---
its disgusting that you think deleting your account makes a difference in any of this
---
ahh so just slightly better then it seems.
---
It's been fun.  I'm out.
---
So you think none of the other companies changed because of the EA loot box fiasco??
---
Was thinking the same thing, lol
---
Thanks man, ill look into it!
---
Tanked DM for the first time last night and it went... poorly.  I'm a level 17 pally so I wasnt expecting a cakewalk but it was definitely more complicated than I realized. What are some simple quality of life tips for tanking (the more pally specific the better).
---
It isn't a 1v1 fight. It's a 1v5 fight.
---
You're missing the point of the thread, contributing nothing. Consider getting a different usename.
---
What Blizzard did was shitty, but it in no way amounts to censoring of free speech.
---
This just made my day
---
More blood for the Blood God!
---
Bye, Felicia!
---
He does and he won't.
---
If youre in a 5 man and youre not the tank, and you pull agro, thorns damage generates threat on you making the mob stick to you slightly harder.
---
I am planning to use it for both PvE and PvP, it's amazing in PvP and it's going to be a learning curve for PvE use to dump threat.
---
The best part is that they were probably in a city where it would have gone to waste anyways by the time they finished AH, Professions, etc. and got to somewhere they would actually use it.
---
All based off of over 10 years of experience on each faction. The people I met and talked to all seemed to line up based off of the faction they played
---
The removal of daze was one of the best decisions in the expansions.
---
I forgot how annoying it is.
---
Yea, on another art post someone was downvoting every single comment (stuff that just said 'looks great!', 'Great work!'), pretty weird
---
Okay Soni got the biggest poster they offered under their poster category. Matte finish. 
---
You can't tell in this crap photo but everything is perfectly legible when you look at it up close. I had to use the low quality 25MB file because Vista print won't take anything over like 30MB or something like that. But it didn't matter because it came out great.
---
The cost was 30 USD with shipping, I had a coupon code that gave me a lot of money off. Can't remember what it was. I use this browser add on that automatically gives them to me. I think it's called wikibuy or something like that. I think there is another one called honey that works very similar. Or you could just do a web search for a code. I think it was like half off or whatever. The quality of the paper and ink was well worth it in my opinion, it looks amazing
---
Your profile shows you've been a karma whore for 2 years, so now, all that is left to answer is how long have you been a hypocrite?
---
It was a joke. oof
---
Proof was shown. I already said I deleted the video, because it was an unlisted video. Wish I had chosen a rogue who wouldn't have scammed. Goodbye.
---
Fishing in STV is very profitable as well. Doing that while questing and killing mobs is how I made most of the money for my mount.
---
What is R5?
---
Is it weird to feel a sense of camaraderie with someone just because they are the same level as me?
---
Guys bein' dudes.
---
Isn't that... like everyone about everything? Don't mean to go all metaphysical skeptic but no one *truly* understands everything.
---
I've won so many auctions because I bid 14c on the green equipment.
---
Against one actual person...
---
Agreed. It's not. I'm level 31 with 7 days played. How about you?
---
Great thanks for the link!  Armory was my introduction to classic tanking.  In that same instance, I switched from 1h//shield to 2 handed tanking with the WW axe a few times.  Both felt so... useless.
---
blatant attempt at karma farm, or just severely stupid not to know how a subscription works.
---
Nice! And set the HS in a location like.. which one would be best? An alliance only town (we're currently assuming the enemy have waterwalking). Maybe darnassus?
---
ur gonna be farming dungeons at 60 anyway, might aswell get some xp for it now
---
Whenver this happens, i just yell "You motherfucker!" and i kill it
---
It's especially annoying as a Hunter. I will definitely group up for bosses or if there are very very few mobs around for a quest, but if there's a ton of them I am playing literally the best possible class to solo mobs. Unless you're whispering me like "hey I need help with this" I'm not going to accept some rando invite.
---
What did it cost?
---
I just wish I didnt get it Horde side, definitely seems to be a great pally weapon.  Thanks for confirming what I had heard.
---
Really? I don't remember that. So from ranks 4-10 you just got nothing? That doesn't sound right.
---
Nope you got screwed over sadly. Try to be the larger guild next time but obviously don't be like them!
---
T1 might not always be BiS it's still awesome. Many years ago I was ecstatic when I got my T1 bracers as my very first epic.
---
Still, 55-60 is leveled in end game zones that people farm resources in at max level so your layer arguement is weak at best.
---
Secondly you can level without questing, a questing route is entirely based upon quests. This is a leveling discussion and in this sub-thread we were specifically discussing grinding mobs that were related to a quest but with extremely weak rewards both in terms of experience and gold. After that quest was completed the best thing to do would have been to grind more profitable mobs, and thats what I left a recommendation on.
---
I stupidly tried to flip these last night and it backfired on me, tried to set price at 2g 50s and everyone spammed 1g  ughhhh the auction house can fire you up sometimes hahah  Now I have over 100 scales but will probably take a loss on them thinking I could sell for 2g at least. We’ll see I guess.
---
I don't get the point of trolling like this...it's not like it's clever, it doesn't make you any money...is it to pat yourself on the back or something?  Like what's the point of being an ass?  Do you show this to your friends and they smile and tell you how proud they are of you?
---
so exactly what would happen to you if a 5 shamans run up to you and one said "Hey let's kill this noob"
---
You arent in a 1v1 fight. You are in a 1v5 fight.  Sure their cordination for the first attack is better then most any 5 man team could hope to be but they are easiliy delt with by a group of 3-4 players.
---
You could but you have to make sure that almost all of Rupture's duration will happen, if the mob dies half way through it's better to just use Evis
---
Ask for the tailoring profession trainer.
---
Best of luck out there, don't take the flack too hard. You're not alone.
---
But that doesn’t apply to this case.  The person was an rude prick, how is that a “zoomer” characteristic?   Are “zoomers” the only entitled generation cause I’m pretty sure I’ve seen that accusation lobbed at “millennials” too.
---
I'm 32 right now. Should I be leveling as arms or fury?
---
I hope it was a joke, I just started playing this game man
---
It's funny how big of a decision this feels like haha
---
Basically I'm deciding... Do I want to stay on Stalagg which is relatively familiar and has a high population, but wPvP is totally shit and alliance is currently dwindling? Or do I want to take a chance at an unfamiliar server where there is much more faction balance, but may not have the population to stick it out in the long run?
---
He has 60% uptime on power of infusion. Interesting.
---
&gt;It's obviously a joke, just like saying "no" when the priest asks the mage for water in a dungeon.
---
I made the mistake of pugging the Garrosh raid and was chastised by the so-called raid leader for my shitty heals.  He told me that I was a shitty healer and that I should feel bad for being the third-worst healer in the raid.
---
I was logged on as my Blood Deathknight, tanking.
---
hows that different from having 5 eneimes run up on you. It is not a 1v1 fight. It's 1v5
---
Stalagg is fine-&gt; mid 50's warlock-&gt; it's not endless ganks and last of the horde are trash. Questing the epl, felwood, wherever, i'm hardly slowed down by the slight horde numbers advantage
---
Emperor (full run) pretty much.  Grim Guzzler is kind of right smack in the middle of the dungeon.  It is further than the runs farming the trinkets, and would be skipped over with a lava run.
---
I'd also say it's very strong in pvp unless you're in a large group where your pet can die quickly, or a warrior decides to end its life. The fear and move impair immunity from bestial wrath is pretty great, and renders fear mostly useless since so much of your damage is coming from your pet even if you happen to get feared. Plus on demand 3s stun at range is nice.
---
literally suck a dick dumb shit
---
Well, yes. As you can see at the bottom. I am the hunter
---
That is five actual people you fucking dunce.
---
With multiboxing you are only fighting one other person who has the combined power of five people.
---
How you are somehow not able to understand this is fucking mind-blowing.
---
I'm assuming it's because I didnt want to group up with the guy
---
Use battle shout for small amounts of mobs or if u see someone facepull a mob, as it will pull it off them.
---
There is no argument in the first place. The guy just followed the tracks and speculated at what could've happened, like people have done throughout human history. He doesn't claim that it's the official story. Just a fun post. Chill
---
Tabards and Titles
---
Sure, lets see him one shot 3k health mage with 800 barrier absorb on top of it in 1 second charge stun.
---
Then grind on some basilisks! They are indeed pretty good for their loot. And you'll probably level up which will make the quests around your current level easier.
---
Like others in this thread I stocked up on the mats from mining and leveled engineering upto 250 with ease after dropping skinning at level 50ish.
---
Yeah, get it to the point that it can summon, park it outside brd, get invited to raid group, summon everyone else, leave group and get summoned by raid warlock. So hard to understand right?
---
He's not wrong though. It can't be racism because German and Russian isn't a race you dummy.
---
Go educate yourself.
---
There is 1 person controlling 5 characters. That 1 person has 5x the power of another 1 person who is playing fairly. That 1 person has 5x the power they should.
---
How is this even an argument?
---
I actually had just gotten to the questing hub and was getting off for the night
---
suck my flappy foldy holds
---
Blizz started it to be fair...
---
private servers made it illegal in PVP situations. dude wants to be a loser and pve with his 5 chars and subs alone, np here. he wants to spam moonfire id flip
---
/petattack
---
Consecration helps a lot for paladin tanking. Before you get that it might be wise to just DPS/heal. Level 17 is also at the lower end of the spectrum for the dungeon so might be a contributor. Consecration + righteous fury is a massive generator of passive threat. 
---
Without a proper taunt errant aggro will be a challenge, you need to keep your dps and healer aware and correct them where need be. A mage hitting a big crit and dragging the mob off you creates a lot of problems and should be avoided as best as possible.
---
While I agree you should be happy you won it, it doesn't even matter anymore.  You won it fair and square, and nothing can change that now.  All the luck to you on the other two pieces.
---
As long as you're having fun it doesn't matter what you're doing.
---
2 days to late for the karma,
---
Suuuuper late to this post but this comic reminded me of good times. Was back in WOTLK during the rise of wizardcleaves during the second half of the expansion. Warlocks would do some combo of Chaos Bolt -&gt; Immolate -&gt; Conflagrate and that would bring you from 100% to 25% in like 2 seconds.
---
Gratz, fuck the jealous people. You won fair and square.
---
My guild was invited along and we brought ten people with us, we're all feeling pretty used. I was wearing mail 3mp5 bracers with Int and the other Shaman was wearing Loomguard. I can only imagine they would use the same argument if Earthfury Vestements or Helm dropped during the course of the run. It's incredibly frustrating and I never had this sort of experience in my years playing Vanilla to Cataclysm. I imagine reaching out with a ticket would not affect any change?
---
If they would make Classic+ I would be committed to classic, but that doesn't seem like the most realistic option even disregarding the political stuff you are talking about.
---
TBC has been the most popular option after classic vanilla. More folks want it than Classic+ even though I think Classic+ would be an amazing reboot to WoW overall (again ignoring your concerns for blizzard decision making atm).
---
I'm probably going to quit playing Classic even though I have loved playing it so much. I just don't want to be grinding on two versions of WoW. I want to devote my time to the WoW that will be developed on in the future. Re-releasing TBC is just more rehashed content and I don't want to put all my time into a game that will just have me relive all of blizzard's past mistakes.
---
Hopefully they will bring the spirit of classic back into retail
---
r/talesfromwow
---
Before the mods silence this post, I am with you brother. Fuck Blizzard. We thought we did, but we didn't. Not like this!
---
So you choose bad gear on purpose??
---
yep perhaps an alliance town but also one with many exits or routes out of adjacent zones. If deeprun tram is disallowed, then I think that rules out IF. Can't remember what SW is like?
---
If you find a group running Arena/Anger/Golem runs, it's only 2 pulls to get it turned in.  The bar wont be hostile to you, and then you can all run out and reset (assuming you're doing more runs)
---
1000 elite 60 melee mobs slowly heading your way... This is fine... A level 1 caster appears behind you, I'm in danger "exxageration obviously since a level 1 would never break barrier ofc but more or less how it feels"
---
Is that the faerlina multiboxer? He has a ton of awesome names in that train of accounts, idk what hes doing he just shows up in org or crossroads and jumps with all of the toons at once, then he logs out
---
you assume there are unlimited mobs and no other groups killing and no respawn timers. its far slower with 2 people even if you are killing mobs faster
---
My ideal set up would be the information and debuffs given by UI overhauls, but with the look and feel of the circle name plates in the classic ui.  
---
(Currently, I have a big problem in that when I turn on my blue light filtering I have no concept of my party members mana status in the default UI.)
---
lol
---
I am on Ashbringer
---
If you played both factions, doesn't that undermine your theory that there are differences?
---
Whats the point of filling this reddit up with shitposts of unsubbing
---
I pugged MC with 4 druids last week. Only problems came from dps pulling aggro, as with pretty much the same problem with every raid at max level.
---
Yet there’s still no proof here or on your youtube channel. Weird. Have a nice day. :)
---
Im contributing to calling out the stupidity of suggesting that because German and Russian languages not being playable on the same are racist.  
---
Which would mean that you believe the German and Russian nationality is a form of Race? Which is stupid. 
---
Its comical its almost like suggest that the reason  they don’t have the Russian language on the same server is because they must hate Peruvian flute bands. Its and outlandish, absurd and quiet frankly retarded comment to even suggest.
---
They really didn't, the HS player did.
---
They followed the contract. The HS player did not.
---
You think you have a tough time making money as a warrior??? Give me a break lol, I’m a resto Druid and literally can’t do anything to mobs. Yet I was able to farm orgrimar exalted to get my epic wolf mount. I’ll give you two words of what you need to become to be rich (what I did), become a “strat slut”. 
---
You are a tank, which will make forming a group much easier than me (had to wait for guild tanks to log on before I could do anything). 
---
Important things to notice in strat:
---
Always, always, always check every supply box. You can walk slowly to them and if it prompts you to disable the trap then it’s bad. If not open it up. Take everything from the box and vendor it all as there is usually food/water/grey item and even sometimes a green. 
---
Go with guild mates so that you can actually do a RR
---
Good job! Everyone should do it, I've been thinking about it but I'm too weak.
---
Oh, well what I see a lot of Prot Warriors do on my server is make Strat Live groups but reserve the orbs for themselves. They always manage to get full groups..
---
Or just a deepdive helmet
---
Keep up the good work my friend
---
I’m sure no one is shocked that a horde rogue posted this.
---
Search for chief brigadier set. Originally it looks more suggestive over crotch area lol
---
Oh, thanks! I really appreciate this non-toxic comment..
---
It's like they didn't think you would ever use it, like what the hell.
---
Between all the repair bills, consumables and reliance on healers, it's not easy to make money.
---
Lmfao it's like fan fiction
---
BB
---
You can literally google "(class) guide wow classic" and find multiple guides that give you the info you seek.
---
If you're on Incendius hit me up. My guilds looking for players like you.
---
The Blue gear was added with all other others, but got a nice stat boost later down the line. I want to say 1.9 but I could be mistaken and it was 1.11.
---
The number of players only hurts the multi boxer as 3 players with 3 characters will often easily kill 1 player with 5 characters. The multi boxer will take up 5 spots no matter where they go. They hurt any raid they go to. They hurt every BG they go into. You get hung up on player vs player in a game that has always been character vs character. If you want a fair player vs player game you should play CS:GOm
---
yeah 50g is still very much more interesting if you don't plan to "market" this later on.
---
OP didn't, did you read the chat wrong?
---
er, ive run over 50 brd as a hunter from 52-60
---
No shield slam at 26.
---
Make sure you have tactical mastery maxed so keep rage when stance swapping.
---
DPS still think it's retail and tanks have full aggro after one demo shout, so be prepared for them to aoe immediately after pull and/or pick their own target to kill that's not the main kill target.  Remember you have both taunt in defensive stance and mocking blow in battle stance to keep mobs' focus on you.
---
Didn't think about SS having no CD. Why you'd be using SS as a dagger rogue is beyond me though (yes yes, I know backstab can also procc it, just being nitpicky)
---
Yes you do. It just sucks.
---
Now I understand why you were being antagonistic from the start.  It's about being mean, lashing out, maybe even feeling cruel.  I gotcha...and it's OK, I don't mind.  We all feel like that sometimes.  Maybe life is pretty challenging for you right now, maybe things ain't going the way you want them to.  It's all good my dude!  We got your back!
---
Take care and good luck out there :D
---
I dont want thorns because I dont want to generate more threat while I am trying to get rid of it you soggy bag.
---
Yeah I'm gonna try to push it out until 56 for resto spec.  I thought about going the pvp spec 30/0/21 and see how that goes as well.
---
You think it's flawed because you are looking at it from an optimaztion point of view. As an RPG, having gear with all different kinds of funky stats on it is far more fitting of the game.
---
Yeh. I'm pretty much the CC shatter and winters chill  bot for raiding so I have to deep frost. Elementalist sounds fun as I miss 1 shotting people on pvp server with pyro
---
They have 5 accounts with the same time played.  That's their time played for one character x5.
---
Simple maths.
---
Also, no.  If you pay for 5 accounts, you have 5 characters and will still get absolutely destroyed by anyone with half a brain who can think of how to mess with multiboxers using the abilities their class gives them.
---
Turn them in....
---
1 person controlling his lvl 60 in the BiS gear cannot beat another person controlling  5 level 60s in mediocre gear.
---
Its called **player vs player** server for a reason. Its mind blowing that this is allowed as it would not be allowed in any other pvp game. 
---
1 person is securing a massive and unfair advantage over any other opponent.
---
Not sure how it functions in classic, but on some private servers, if you attacked a guy with Thorns on in Booty Bay or Gadgetzan, the guards would hostile him as well as you.
---
This problem exists in-game as well
---
... unless he wins, like he said.
---
Getting off lol
---
He hard-casted his aimed shot even when I knew he wouldn't get the cast off by running into melee range
---
That's great, thank you!
---
That line of thought holds no water.
---
And the 1 person has to level multiple characters and grind out gear for multiple characters. The reward they get is to take 5 slots in everything they do and be worse the 5 different players who can take those slots.
---
It's called Lorti UI Classic
---
Funny enough I actually started in westfall at 12, I got brutally murdered until I got to 14 and now it's just a little easier. I thought that was where we were supposed to go because someone in elwynn tells you to go there after doing some quests.
---
I'm actually stupid, I forgot to use polymorph but sure enough if they don't break out of it I can survive 2 pulled mobs
---
This dude's so mad he can't even form proper sentences.
---
if you have already learned bite or claw, on the front page of your abilities is a 'Train Pets'. Use that to teach the skills you already have.
---
It's pretty much pure luck, knowing the right people, being on loot council, which is why I loved the conquest pvp vendors, which are now not in retail and caused me to play classic
---
yea and what happens when you each get 20 mobs loot each and only his 20 dropped the loot? he's done now and leaves and you have to wait back for the next spawn by yourself thus slowing you down. or if you killed all the mobs yourself you are done instead
---
... you must play horde
---
To be honest, lvling a NE rogue i do enjoy the agility+ stats NE have. Because it do increase alot of more power and quicker grinding on mobs. They also look sexy in gears(Not that it add anything helpful lol). But gnomes and dwarves racials are very useful for PvP. 
---
But shadowmeld can be a big saver for you, if the vanish and stealth is under CD. For example, if you have to run away from a stunned enemy.. you can hide behind objects and go shadowmeld until the stealth is ready and pop it. 
---
But not sure how far it helps you tbh.
---
I can’t tell if I’m going insane, or if everyone has lost their shit completely this week. So many obvious jokes made, and nobody gets it
---
This bear tank appreciates you
---
can't get off as easily with a mage as you can get off with a paladin

---
As a dps, you should be fine for graveyard now. After 30 you can start looking for library groups but might not get a ton of replies until 32 - graveyard has a lot of possible rares and is useful/easy to run repeatedly, but library has the nice caster gear.
---
I’ve been camping it for a few days.
---
I have two characters on different servers in the water here, with underwater helmet and a +15% swimming speed belt.
---
I pretty much just keep killing the mobs and wait for hours. My rogue was 38lvl and it’s 41 now.
---
As there are many players came to take a look and leave, and low level players guided here by the quest addons. So my strategy is as long as I stay in the water stupidly, I get better chance to see the Prince. I got one kill and it didn’t drop, and another witness of the mob and didn’t get the tag, the tag dude said it didn’t drop though.
---
And yes I don’t know what layer I’m in so there is no way to calculate the respawn time
---
Yeah, this looks like pain lol
---
Un'Goro crater. I'm a 54 rogue. Soloing a Devilsaur and a lvl 60 rogue comes up and starts watching me.
---
I have to pop blind on it because it blocks my gouge.
---
Douchebag shoots it out of blind.
---
I luckily got heals off and had enough damage to kill it, but when I call him out, he says "I was just helping. Geez, never helping you again."
---
Right, sure thing buddy you were just helping by shooting the blinded target you had been hunting for too, knowing that it could easily kill me.
---
&gt;Just some dickheads, not too sure why they get off on being unprovoked assholes to people
---
Anonymity. Bet they're both pussies irl.
---
This is generally not the case. People sometimes choose to skip quests or grind dungeons, sure, but it's not required. Often it's because they're hunting a specific thing, or in some quest for optimal xp or whatever. But that's player choice. 
---
If you attempt to do \*all\* the quests available, you will generally have many of them gray out before you get to them.
---
While you are right, you are very condescending with your steps. Its almost as if you are a tank main complaining, although nothing wrong with that, reddit would expect a little more humility.
---
I thought you weren't being political?
---
Is it me? It must be, I never get the point of these posts- for the slow-witted amongst us please consider adding a one line summary of why this is funny or deplorable or whatever the point is. I still don’t know. Tough being stupid.
---
With earthbind should be doable
---
Just making sure. Many aren’t quite aware of what levels are appropriate for certain dungeons or types of runs for a dungeon, since most dungeons span such a large level range. BRD being one of the worst.
---
People get very very angry over gear. You shouldn't be put out because you won it fairly.
---
I've seen a guild split already because of gear, multiple people leave good guilds because of gear. Officers in my guild had a full blown shouting match because me (ret paladin) bet and won on DKP ring. 
---
Congrats on your binding, you deserved it 😊
---
I do remember this from back in the days. Not a new thing !
---
The enemy!
---
I'm on the alliance side.
---
Fellow warlocks what would you be willing to pay for a mount run (use another players mats)? I was thinking about charging either 100g or 150g, does that seem reasonable?
---
Even dumber to say my opinion is dumb and I should be playing g retail for having it.
---
If the single most meaningful upgrade to my value to the raid is a new weapon why would I squander the chance to get it by not having enough dkp to spend on it? Which is more effective: 150 dkp spent on a 5 dps increase by bidding on 5 t1 pieces or a 12 dps increase by spending 100 dkp on 1 new sword?
---
Again I'm not saying that rules can't be made and followed, but statements about "everybody should take their chances and get an upgrade possible" doesnt need dkp, you could just do /roll tier+1 and not track dkp
---
One day? No. 
---
Farming for dual shadow fangs,  lucky fishing hat, timber maw offhand, and dual agms could take you months.
---
Doing battlegrounds gives you rep for that specific bg's faction, and there are mount rewards from some of those factions. Not sure about a kodo though.
---
That's honestly the funniest thing I've read in a while.
---
I requested a standup desk at work, the spring loaded desktop kind.  I showed up to work one day and find that they bought my whole department the top of the line, floor mounted, electric motor models.
---
Standing some part of the day really does make a difference.
---
Pretty sure defense rating does nothing in PvP
---
I'm gonna be such a pain in the ass for Horde trying to get anything done at Blackrock Mountian, it's gonna be fun.
---
I'll try the jump runs strat, I'm a miner and I can find a healer who plays ench pretty easily in my guild. Thanks !
---
People think blame = deserve and get angry about it. 
---
If you don’t look both ways before crossing the street and someone is speeding and you get hit. 
---
The driver is legally at fault for speeding, yes but you are at fault for not taking the necessary precautions to insure **your** safety.
---
Just like mouthing off to someone about how their wife/mom is a big ________ chances are you are going to get hit. They are legally at fault for assault but you could have avoided it by not being an ass by calling their wife/mom a big _____.
---
I believe LC is one of the best systems to distribute gear if done properly. Which is unfortunately a big IF. Shitty leadership can and will abuse the system, so you only should use it if the leadership is sound. Which fortuntately my guild seem to be, but yours definitely is not :D
---
using  "Shut the fuck up, clear comms, relax, you don't know shit about running a guild"  as argument for literaly anything is a very simple reason to /gquit
---
Wowhead is high and got tons of stuff wrong.  
---
I'm betting that they have some misconception that we'll get the old lvl 58 blue pvp sets in p2 and the updated versions later. That however doesn't gel at ALL with the route classic has gone (r14 set was just updated while entirely new IDs were created for the new r10 set). We'd end up with some super messed up version where pvp legitimately isnt worth doing between ranks 3 and 10, which is insane.  
---
No, we're 100% getting the updated pvp sets. You can quote me on that. u/vincentwillats
---
Can we get some proof? I’d love to believe you but there’s no way to know for sure
---
You CAN roll need on something that you're not a high enough level to wear but you shouldn't. 
---
Boils my piss when something I genuinely need for my level drops and someone 3 levels below me that cant even equip it ends up winning the roll... They have another 3 levels to farm the dungeon for it if they want it...
---
5 people have to pay for 5 characters the same way 1 person can pay for 5 characters. The money changing hands is exactly the same.
---
The 1 person with 5 characters still has to level 5 characters and has to grind put gear for those 5 characters.
---
That's not a bad idea, I need 2 orbs for myself too.
---
Do you agree that alliance have more noobs? That's my experience.  
---
I do think most of the theories just come down to confirmation bias.
---
You guys forget that one of those 30 will probably have track humanoids. Which means you'll have to keep moving
---
Circlejerk = ...documenting a clear bug and subsequent bad customer service? 
---
Under no circumstances in the game can you not loot a mob in a raid/party or otherwise based on the amount of damage/threat dealt. If that’s circlejerking then /shrug
---
Yeah that's not at all factual.
---
Shouldn't have taken the bait, mate
---
I do the big chains late in the game. Pick up side quests whereever the chains lead me. They are a good guideline, lead you into the dungeons and are overall good xp. Even though the long travels certainly aren't the most efficient way to gather XP it gives the grind purpose which is much more enoyable than doing single quests and grinding only.
---
Yes there are, I believe they were from farming WSG/AB/AV Marks OR from getting exalted with AV.

On Grobbulus if you wanna fight.
---
I hope writing this was cathartic for you.
---
"Finally"
---
Yeah, I thought so. I mostly leveled with quests so I didn't skip that many, but I will see which quests I can do on my free time.
---
I understand him being punished so GM isn't always used as a political position, but we don't know what's in the contract, or is it publicly available somewhere? 
---
Taking all prize money, suspending him for a year etc seems harsh to me. Also firing the casters that were there? How were they at fault?
---
What does layering mean on classic server? I read somewhere that it splits up playes in zone in the same server so does that mean if I play with a friend and theres a chance we dont see each other even though we are in same server? Im kinda confused.
---
I'm currently maining a mage, but I played a rogue from vanilla-cata then quit till classic came out.
---
Idk man, seems more complicated than that. PvP is not main spec. He came to the raid to dps, and that is his spec, and you do NOT want rogues in raids with TF until you have a tank that is capable of putting out an insane amount of threat. Even if he had the sword right now he wouldn't be able to use it without constantly pulling threat from any tank, you have to remember how much threat that proc gives, it's not just damage threat. He'd have to intentionally gimp his own damage to use it. 
---
I really think TF should go to warriors right now, but whatever I guess its not that big of a deal, at this point he should just enjoy it.
---
I’m by no means poor (350g at level 56) but warrior grinding is painful. Don’t bother fighting enemies at or above your level, you’ll be eating after every fight. So unless that ends up changing much at 60, it could potentially be a painful grind.
---
Crazy, wish I was on there since I farm them. On my server they are only 30-40.
---
To quote Preacher: "if the loot system doesn't make sense, it's a bad system. Find a better guild."
---
Preach may seem like the super hardcore type, and he is, but the reason the hardcores make it so far is because the things they do make sense.
---
A proper loot council isn't deciding things on the spot, everything is predetermined and everyone knows what order they are getting items. Mage A gets X if it drops because they are already highest on DPS and we want to keep them pushing, but Mage B gets Y if it drops however cause it'll give them their 3pc. And Mage C gets Z because despite 500 arena runs they can't get the damn belt to drop.
---
A lot of people don’t realize, when you become the face of a company, they are certain things you cannot say while representing them.
---
A good example is if you are in the military, you are not allowed to attend political rallies while in uniform.
---
Awesome! Thanks for putting this effort in!
---
I started a toon there and dipped when I noticed the major cities were all sleepytown. Nothing ever sold on the AH, it was impossible to find tanks for dungeons. Can't pay me to go back to that toon
---
Pretty sure that's not a thing.
---
&gt;The guy just followed the tracks and **speculated** at what could've happened
---
And that's why I made my initial comment which basically corrected the "this is *the* story* with the fact that it's just an opinion based on speculation.
---
&gt; And the 1 person has to level multiple characters and grind out gear for multiple characters.
---
In actuality they have to level one character... and four others level at the same time with literally zero extra effort involved.
---
Sure, a piece of dungeon loot can't be applied to all five characters.  That doesn't change the fact that it's still inherently unbalanced to be controlling five people at the same time.
---
How you are too fucking dense to grasp this very basic concept is absolutely unreal.  It's like you're trying as hard as possible to be stupid.
---
You have to tame certain pets to learn abilities like claw/bite, which you can then train to your other pets forever after. Petopia has a great list of what cats can learn and where to get each ability.
---
Really?  I do it all the time.  Pulled a xbow out of strat dead last night and passed on the rest of the greed rolls.
---
Politeness starts with you.
---
That’s unwarranted, no need to be a dick, jackass.
---
There’s the frostwolf howler and turning in your ‘for great honor’ badges award rep so you probably got your rep up high enough to by another mount without an intentional grind if that makes sense
---
I farmed blue dragonkin. They have a low chance to drop that pattern. I teamed up with a priest who was looking for said pattern. It dropped from the FIRST kill in party.
---
You forgot west :p
---
The gym example works like this I think.
---
1) Some people have a membership and maybe remember to go once a week or twice a month for maybe an hour or just until they get uncomfortable. They probably aren't getting a ton out of it, but they can rightfully say, "yeah o go to the gym." These people don't want to go to the gym, they want to be healthy and lack either the time or discipline to really focus on it. They are casuals.
---
2)Some people force themselves to go two-three times a week for an hour or so. These are probably your average gym goers. They're not casual exactly, but it's kinda clear the gym is in addition to things they want to do, not something they really want to do in itself (yes there will be exceptions), but they want to be healthy and either have extra free time or discipline from the "casuals" above.
---
3) People who go literally every day for 2-3 hours every day are *not* casuals. They aren't going because their schedule allows it. They have made it a part of their life. There is nothing you do consistently for 2-3 hours per day that is not a significant part of your life. This is not a casual gym-goer. This is a person whose life partly revolves around going to the gym.
---
4) There are people who have personal trainers and spend hours upon hours working out every day. These are the gym equivalent of the wow no-lifers. It's not just a part of their life, it is their life.
---
Saying that anyone but 4 is a casual is ridiculous. I think it's kind of a stretch to call 2 a casual but if that's what everyone agrees is casual fine. But no fucking way is 3 casual.
---
None of that means that 3 is entitled to the same benefits as 4. It just means that I think people have an incredibly unhealthy mindset if they're calling 3 casual.
---
No, pretty sure the threat goes to whomever is doing the melee attack.
---
IMO it's a symptomatic thing with the classic mentality. I've heard it constantly; "Reputation matters!" And it's absolutely right. However I think a lot of people swing that mentality way hard. I know an absolute shitload of people who think them ignoring someone is going to make that person just permanently blacklisted from doing anything. In addition to that, I genuinely think people are being far oversensitive, and jump to *any* reason as sufficient to ignore, whether it be someone actually being an ass, or someone just saying something that you might not like. Ignoring people is fine, but if you're needing addons to expand your ignore list like I've heard from some people, maybe your attitude is the issue.
---
I mean, it really isn't "trying hard as possible" to just get over it.
---
You think you're making a point by saying 5 humans are different than 1 guy with 5 accounts.
---
It's really not.
---
In World PVP, you will come across unwinnable unfair and completely one sided attacks from the opposite faction.  Whether it's 5 humans or 5 players controlled by a multiboxer it doesn't matter.
---
Our POINT is that the multiboxer is EASIER than 5 human players to kill.
---
How are you not getting that?
---
If you accept getting ganked by level 60s, how can you be such a little bitch about a 5 man multiboxer who you can actually fucking kill?
---
It was only upon defending my clams did I learn that Crab meat is as tasty and buffing as it is.
---
Now I kill all crabs on sight.
---
That is a categorically false answer they've given. I did it last night as resto shaman, contributed absolutely 0 damage and still got the skull along with 7 others in the raid group. You my dude have been robbed of glory.
---
Many classes can make 20g an hour farming basically anything at 60, so it makes sense that they would pay up not to waste time. That's only 5g per person.
---
undead rogues are very good
---
No agenda behind it. Just is it new or is it not does anyone have any evidence towards either
---
I hate materials market, is so fucking volatile and unpredictable, I just prefer to buy twink items and hold it.
---
I have about 4-6 friends that played bfa for a month and dropped it, then like 16-20 of my friends and affiliates were all there the day of launch on classic and now it’s down to just me and my hunter buddy who are the only ones who got to 60. Everyone else has either been on an infinite alt cycle and only made it to high level 30’s or playing other games now. (Mainly borderlands 3, which I was never a fan of)
---
Hyrdocane
---
Theres discussion on thus in yesterdays thread if you want more info, but devilsaur wont be replaced til rag at the absolute earliest. Rings from dm outclass whats available now, but are also harder to farm than blackstone (ie farmable, but wit a coordinated group of 60s), as do bracers off prince (so deepfury or sc for cheap might make sense, but 100 on deepfury not so much) and distracting dagger vs everything but maybe alcors. Muggers belt is also interesting but i havent done the math to figure out if/when it beats cloudrunners.
---
Us east
---
I dinged 60 last Friday and have been working on pre-BiS. I was unaware pre-60s ever went on raids. Starting to feel slightly bad as I joined a guild who said they had 28 guildies who were going to raid. Then I joined and saw only 13 60s. so I left for another guild that offered me a spot. 
---
WELL overall grats on your future sword and may you spam it in chat at all times!
---
Ganking lowbies happens and should be expected since it’s a PvP server, but yeah, unless that lowbie was an asshole somehow, a level 60 corpse camping someone much lower than them makes me lose all respect for them, alliance or horde lmao
---
I don't get it. Suck it up for a few mins or go quest somewhere else, or take a break. This kind of thing happens all the time in classic. People should play another game if they're going to react like this every time they have to wait a while for quest spawns.
---
There are two sets of elevators in TB. Technically, there are two entry points there too.

Thinking about starting a warrior to tank dungeons with friends. They are around lv40 so I'll mostly be pugging and questing until we close the level gap.
---
Suggestions on fury vs arms for this situation? I'm most interested in leveling quickly to play with friends.
---
The only thing basic is your shitty american education.
---
BiS for survival hunter! Actually I dono if it would be, but for the hunterrrrrs! Haha
---
When I ran out of quests I would just grind mobs for a couple hours. Also remember if you group up you can tackle higher level quests
---
hunter is pretty strong at 19
---
Sir this is a wendy's parking lot
---
&gt; don’t go getting all defensive
---
Have you even read your own posts? You're demanding proof and exclaiming #nochanges over a loading screen tip thinking it's aimed at people spamming dungeons. Get a grip.
---
Where have you been where you get shit service? And our servers aren't paid enough? Alright man, that's why they survive on 40 hours a week compared to Americas standard of two jobs at minimum wage.
---
Iirc you go to your class trainer and pay gold for it, not sure how much.
---
So i can play alts when i afk on my main. Also so i can trade my bank for instant transfer of items and gold. And i can boost myself. Also i can check the AH while im out doing something else. Reset my own dungeon, so i dont have to run in and out.
---
Says someone who cant record properly
---
I'm only pointing out that generations are a much better indicator of just about anything than astrological signs.
---
Tsunamon evolve in to.... MEGA TSUNAMIMON!
---
Yes. Create scenarios by twisting statistics in a way to prove your point. What about the scenario where you get all the loot and the other guy doesn't? You didn't even try to understand the other's dude's point. Your bias shows.
---
An AFK rogue that is not stealthed deserves to die. Or, it's a trap.
---
A ticket might help. Loot rules were established, you rolled and won. They can't take them away from you at that point.
---
I‘m maining a priest as well. Currently in my late 30‘s. Mad excited for shadow form at 40. 
---
Anyways - Congrats, my friend. How has your experience been? 
---
(Und aus purer Neugier: Auf welchem Server spielst du?😊)
---
I got half a mind to make an r/classicwow Bingo board, some options include:
---
“No one cares”
---
Mage=bad
---
Help I’ve been banned and I won’t tell you why
---
“**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**”
---
back in my day... that's a paddlin
---
You can't be serious. You have to be deliberately disingenous now. Those are **five different players**. Requires 5x the amount of people, 5x the amount of effort. There are 5 people sitting behind 5 computers pressing 5 different buttons to match the power of 1 player sitting at a computer pressing 1 button.
---
Furthermore, 1 player has to find and convince 4 other players to group up in order to get the same amount of power as 1 player turning on his multibox. Now what happens if the multiboxer matches that level of effort by also calling upon 4 other players?
---
Now the multiboxer with his group of 5 people still beats the other group of 5 people because, with the same amount of effort and luck, he now has the power of 10 vs the power of 5.
---
Human is the top choice for ret due to the weapon skill bonuses they have, just FYI.
---
hahaha you beat me here by 10 hours. #respect
---
and they all want the same loot, so they all have shit gear
---
I always wondered what the draw to boxing was. You’re paying $75 a month... for what added benefit? Is it more fun? I’m genuinely curious.
---
Loot council is in most cases just another word for clique looting which means friends of the GM and officers will get loot first followed by bootlickers who stay behind them long enough. 
---
If you don't leave the guild it will fall apart because of this very quickly so the choice is yours.
---
Just give me my damn Baconator and i will see myself out
---
Meh if you get a CS on a pally mounting you need to blow him up before he can bubble etc. Should max dps and open on him
---
You're wrong.
---
Do the Arena/Anger spams with me. Purple chest and HoJ on reserve. of course. Oh and that other thing you need...I need it more!
---
Yeah. Similarly, Retribution Aura assigns both the damage and the threat to player receiving the aura, rather than the Paladin with the aura active. I'd say it's highly likely that the threat goes to the person _healed_ by Seal of Light, rather than the Paladin.
---
The funny thing is it's only possible to config it now after the change. It wasn't before.
---
Sorry for the wall of text. In the end this is all just a matter of opinion. I can agree to disagree. But at this point if we look at the facts it doesn’t matter if you complain because it’s already happening. You can either catch up quickly. Sit and complain for change. Or do your own thing and not worry about how far everyone else’s and just enjoy your own time at your own pace.In my opinion everyone should have equal rights but not everyone is equal in every aspect
---
Why do you think alliance on stalagg is dead?  There are a ton of guilds raiding still....
---
Screw them. Blacklist and tell them good luck finding another guild that even allows randos to roll on that.
---
Trash blade refusing to drop?? Isnt it a quest reward?
---
I thought so too but I was killing a mob in front of him and he didn’t budge and since he was quick to jump me when I was in the middle of killing the mob that spawned on top of him, it was either a really elaborate trap or he was an idiot.
---
That’s all a meme. Sorry it triggered you
---
NPC Scan does this, but I haven't tried it for Classic so I don't know if it was ported over.
---
No? And as long as im not doing something I wouldn't care. The most bags ive made before for a guildy is 6 and I still don't care if he was using the bags or selling them. Im not gonna go out of my way though, if you wanna come to me ill do it though.
---
maybe both decided to do their name that way because the real one, Lúthien, was taken.
---
i'm more than calm
---
It all depends on who you play with.  Some groups will expect the tank to know everything.  Try and find a guild or a group that you will enjoy and be comfortable with.  As a tank you will get groups very easily no matter what, so it's really your choice who you'd like to play with.  All that said the dungeons can be learned pretty quickly, just one run is often enough to get it down.  Tanking can be a lot of fun so don't stress on it too much.
---
There's this random pool of water in Un'Goro that's unbelievably deep, that's where I'm heading.
---
I think the site www.petopia.com gives you info you'll want about various pets. Not all Raptors are the same.
---
Spirit tap -&gt; wand spec -&gt; Holy talents
---
IMHO, the damage boosts, cast time reductions, and mana cost reductions of holy are much better than disc, especially for leveling.
---
I'm on Smolderweb and it says that it's not layered.
---
Love it. Seems to be maybe 40/60 alliance/horde and I like knowing that there's only ONE layer, so I have a good sense of the "true" population when I walk around.
---
Or hydrocane
---
I think there's an option in the regular blizz ui for whispers to always open a new chat window popup? Something about turning off 'whispers in-line'
---
This is the method that I used, no warlock necessary.
---
I read one of the quests as "Rocket cat farts"
---
Now I'm disappointed...
---
That's crap. Blizzard stated only Kazzak is leashed, because he's a "server reset" problem. Everything else should be kitable.
---
I did 1-270 for 50g last night. Will do 270-300 later but Thorium is about 12g or so a stack on my server so probably looking at 100+ to cap it off.
---
Which BRD runs are you trying to do? I wouldn't take a 55 on an emp run, but for everything else it's fine.
---
Plus you can get into dungeons np and level that way!
---
Proof?
---
I havent used a shield for tanking any dungeon up to lvl 50, and it hasnt been any problem what so ever for me. And while being arms specc. Am I  bad tank because of this? Since I am able to do more damage and thus generating more threat (And much better AoE threat, mind you) I would make the argument that I am a better tank because of it.
---
I dont think you need a shield or prot specc (which is ridicoulus because prot sux balls) to tank a lvl 20 dungeon, thats just stupid.
---
Nah, its to be expected of course, but i do find it a questionable use of time when, say, a level 60 hangs out for hours in places like Stonetalon or Redridge just to kill players 30 levels lower than them.
---
What's the quickest/cheapest way to gain ~1.5k reputation with Darkspear Trolls? I'm rapidly approaching 40 and have been exclusively grinding without a lot of questing, still friendly with my home faction. If I can easily get it up to Honored I'd like to save myself 10g off the mount price.
---
You could cut your hoof on that, or hooves.
---
I lold
---
Exactly this
---
You just need to snag int gear and you should be fine.
---
Eh, I only roll for chests during dungeons. Out in the world it's not common, at least in my experience. Most people including myself just want to get the quest going.  
---
Getting salty over a chest in open world is petty.
---
Our guild looking for more on Rattlegore and we running MC tonight at 5:30 PST!
---
Five people paying for five accounts is how the game is meant to be played.  You are forced to group to be powerful; on your own you are weaker.
---
The multiboxer meanwhile is just paying five times the normal subscription rate so that he can be "grouped" at all times... while still being on his own in terms of actual human players involved.
---
Again, how you two are somehow unable to understand this is unreal.
---
Golemagg - EU :3
---
Super easy. if you go to the skills trainer, they preset an option to reset your talent tree. All the point you spent in the talent tree will be refunded and you can spend them again. The trainer charges a fee for this service, but as long as you don't respec all the time, it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Even though i play NE i gotta agree, it doesn't take you that far in help but. 
---
Shadowmeld can save you for something, if your stealth and vanish going CD atm then you can out of combat try to outrun the pvp enemy and hide behind trees or other objects in shadowmeld until u pop stealth again. And if a spellcasters trying to bolt you, it will interrupt them.
---
In your specific instance, I'd say go more holy.  A friend of mine has a holy/prot mix that heals whatever party member is attacking his target. He has two seals he judges, one for mana and one for health.  Apologies for not knowing right off, I haven't played a Paladin since WotLK.
---
It should make for little to no downtime for you both.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=DPS
---
Allstars rank 2 is a druid. However the symbol made me think it was a boomkin. It's a cat. Probably with the Gnomeregan hammer. Rank 3 is ret pala though.
---
Although for single bossfights warriors seem to take up the ranks (recklessness lul).
---
Reminds me of how I got reported by two groups in the first week while bear tanking Hogger for random people, I’d wait till someone tagged him then I’d taunt and take the damage. But I guess being helpful to others is a crime in wow nowadays.
---
Mark your targets for kill order and communicate it to your team if necessary. In your opening rotation, it's also important to get a Revenge off ASAP against Skull, so very soon after Charge, use Shield Block and toss Revenge on Skull. At the beginning of the pull, I also try to cast Demo/Battle shouts before tab sundering, and remember to use Shield Block/Revenge on cooldown. You could also consider throwing on a 2H weapon for the very beginning of pulls, Charge &gt; Whirlwind for damage/threat &gt; equip 1h/Shield and then proceed as usual, but make sure your healer is ready. 
---
Your job is really just to keep shit off of the healer. If the DPS don't follow your kill order, and they die for it, it's their fault. Tell them to focus Skull instead of something else, and to wait a few seconds before AoE. If all else fails, talk with your healer, let them die to learn the lesson the hard way.
---
indeed
---
What server? Here on Fairbanks 52s are farming arena and 53-54s are adding angerforge/golemlord plus emp at 56.
---
blizzard and the chinese government are going to see this post and end the corruption once and for all.  great speech 🤡🤡
---
Go ahead and spec holy, you will be a godlike duo while questing and be able to form dungeon groups easier than snapping your fingers.
---
I agree that any 5v1 fight is probably going to be unfair for the team of 1. 
---
The software multi boxers are using just replicates key clicks across multiple windows, they then use in game macros to do the fancy stuff. Anything more then that amd the multiboxer is breaking TOS. 
---
You aren't playing like you are a single character. You are playing like you have 4 idiots following you and doing what you say. That's why fear bombing a  multiboxer is so powerful. Just getting those 4 idiots to look in the wrong direction will prevent them from casting on you.
---
Hey man! The problem isn't your spec, it's your gear! Try to keep a second set with intellect on it and you'll be fine.
---
&gt; and passed on the rest of the greed rolls.
---
Something's not adding up
---
No one said anything about handling or not handling the PVP aspect of the game. The fact is, OP is a shit show of a pvper who had to go "gank" some lowbies because he was probably getting rolled in his level range and needed to get some angst out. He could only terrorize people 25+ levels below him in an area that usually DOESN'T have much of the opposite faction in it. When i leveled through Duskwood i barely saw any Horde at all. 
---
People celebrating this or saying "Roll on a PVE server" are just as big a shit show.
---
I reread your post and see that you agreed with the basic theory but possibly not the tone or the exact examples that I listed. And perhaps the tone  could be somewhat elitist and in your face.I just wanted to put my opinion out there. Kind of trying to stir a constructive debate without being too blunt or sounding arrogant. But as I leave this post I just want to let everyone know that it’s just a game and most of the people who are at the endgame already are there because they have probably not done much else with their lives in the last couple of months.
---
 Can you reuse the talent points right away too?
---
1. OP says no dungeons
---
2. Both ally and horde can enter Stockades
---
Yes, it does. I rely on it for swipe-spam while tanking.
---
I'll buff the hunter pet when the hunter figures out how to FD immediately after aimed shot, and never before.
---
I just watched the video and checked your posts.
---
He's not even that pissed and his youtube channel is small.  You are, however, deleting your replies to him which is sketchy.
---
Definitely just ignore it it will go away.  By bringing it up here you are just bringing more attention to it.  I get you're trying to defend yourself but a classic drama mistake is by defending yourself you're putting yourself out there for more criticism.  This would have gone 100% unnoticed to most everyone until you posted about it and the guy didn't care that much which he said in the video he was just using it as content.
---
I'd go disc to meditation/inner focus then Holy for the cast time reduction. Also wouldn't go imp pwf since it's negligible at low levels but I guess there's nothing better at pve servers, maybe martyrdom for when you pull several mobs.
---
That's the line out your mother's bedroom.
---
Rules were established, rogues were allowed, end of discussion.
---
Warriors should avoided terrible raid leadership if they want to avoid terrible outcomes, don't blame the winner.
---
I'm mostly just being goofy. But level requirement isn't something to really consider. There's twinks in every bracket, and a 39 twink could potentially have some use for this depending on proc rate.
---
Just as a small theorycraft; a hunter could swap to this if someone gets in melee range of him. If the proc rate is good, then it will trigger on wing clip and raptor strike relatively easily. Now when the hunter is trying to get away and create space, he also has 5 seconds of heavily increased defense. Basically like a bargain-brand Deterrence. 
---
I'm not saying this would work, but there's also no reason it *wouldn't* work. You can swap weapons so easily in classic so it's not like it's a big deal to carry niche gear as a twink. Like I said, it's actually incredibly common, and for "serious" twinks it is definitely required.
---
Priest here. I know nothing about Warlocks. In dungeons at the beginning of lots of pulls they're usually around 50% health. Do they get some sort of bonus for not being at full? I usually just pop a Renew on them and then focus back on our tank. Do warlocks want to be at not-100% health or are they all just doing that convert health into mana thing?
---
I by far I  like loot council.   I joined a guild on Pservers and we used this.    If you wanted an item you would link the item it would be upgrading.   Most of times it would go to the biggest upgrade unless it was a rare Bis,  then it would go to the member that was always there on time and ready.     The guild progress threw content like nothing I experienced in all the guilds I raided with prior.    Also with loot council players always make deals,   Let me have mageblade and I’ll let you get the cabal shoulders from BWL.
---
Guildmates and I ran through STV last night on Kirtonos ganking alliance.
---
Some were our level (46-49), some were higher, a lot were lower (obviously). 
---
Did we sit there and camp anyone's body? No.
---
But we most certainly did revisit areas where we had ganked players. If they were still there, we ganked them again. Some may have perceived that as camping. 
---
I don't feel bad at all though.
---
I am aware of this. And thanks. But im talking about what i can do currently - seems like I have no options.
---
I would have ditched the raid the second that mage class officer got the second item.   Your guild is run by scumbags get out before giving them more loot.
---
That was decent man fair play got that children of bodom swag
---
Yikes, you're hopeless.
---
I'm on arcanite reaper and if anything the server feels like it is growing. More and more people intruding on my farming of winterfall village at any rate.
---
That’s not my point/question tho.
---
OoC rezzing was dependent on a player literally staying super far away and not participating in the fight in any way. No healing no nothing. By not getting into combat, they could rez people mid fight.
---
If this person was healing people in this fight with the dragon, they should’ve been forced into combat. If they were forced into combat, they should register on the threat table.
---
Darkspear trolls is my home faction.
---
I am a troll.
---
&gt;I am just really tired of hearing all about DPS Rankings being more important than overall contribution to the raid. I believe, and I need data to prove/disprove, is that While you need core DPS in any situation, there becomes a point of diminishing returns where as the group size scales the more support oriented classes start contributing more to overall success of the raid and we should, instead of using DPS as the deciding factor on what class/spec is the most beneficial, we instead look at potential raid contribution (which would change based on comp).
---
You have it backwards. As soon as the minimum amount of buffers are in the raid you'd benefit from more of whatever class gives the highest dps (fury warriors) and bad dps specs (boomkin, ele sham, ret) would be even worse.
---
Who the fuck is mei and whys she trying to do that?!
---
That was the same guy as this screenshot!
---
I haven’t deleted a single one of my comments on here or on youtube. 
---
Just really frustrating watching a video that says “You suck, Sholton” and just watching people agree that I’m the one who did something wrong.
---
It's time to talk to the people you enjoy playing with in the guild and GTFO and stat your own.
---
Regardless of whether you are going to be healing or solo more often, if you are doing a smite spam build you should be rushing the smite talents right after wand spec/spirit tap. I'd go straight for 5/5 holy spec, 5/5 divine fury, Holy nova, 2/2 healing focus, and 2/2 searing light. After that, I'd go back to disc and get 3/3 PW:S.
---
From there, it's a tossup whether you go finish off disc or get spiritual guidance. I also think it's absolutely worth considering improved inner fire over mental agility; but both are good talents, it comes down to how much solo you will do. Do not put that one point in silent resolve. Put it in martyrdom. Silent resolve, especially a single point, is pretty useless; whereas martyrdom is great for any kind of solo play and a single point actually carries a bit of weight on a 2-rank talent.
---
Respectable
---
I will be the second tank warrior to get to 60 in my guild, we are planning on raiding once we get 40ish people to 58+, Our GM is already the main tank. I know he will get the best gear funneled to him, but is there room for me to be a prot tank as the second best tank in the guild? Not sure how raid groups work. Will they need another prot tank or should i go fury?
---
See, that's the freaking elitist thinking that I don't want to see in this game, to be honest. If I invite someone to play with me this person has EVERY RIGHT to get the loot.
---
If I don't think someone is worthy of loot - by reason: not helpful - then why invite him in the first place?
---
If ever there's a person in the group and he's carrying his weight, then said person deserves rewards. Period. IN MY BOOK, everyone who disagrees with this is a disgusting piece of sh*t that has wrong human values at their core. Sorry to be this blunt but that's the way I see it.
---
How to delete
---
I love Reddit. This post did exactly what i expected within minutes. Downvoted into the basement immediately and riddled with the expected comments.  
---
10/10 predictable.
---
Cuz hey, its Reddit. People love to hate whatever they can. I'm putting up some puppy videos next to balance it out. Only a true psychopath can hate on pups
---
Is there another competitor releasing an expansion soon that Blizz is worried about?
---
Thorns lasts 10 minutes, which means even more basking in the glory of the buff!
---
yeah i had a similar experience.
---
I flew to southshore to run up to SM. I'm a 41 warlock, and i see some 32 troll mage on the road getting attacked by a bear. No one around, i run in front of him, see no response. So i do my good deed of the day and kill the bear so he doesn't die. 
---
I wave goodbye, mount back up, go on my way and get just passed the farm below the dalaran crater and some horde shadow priest attacks me on sight. He's got a skull for his level and a 36 druid with him.
---
I made it past the range of his mind flay but his dots killed me before i could toss up a shadow ward. 
---
Then a day later I'm waiting for a group to come down to Uldaman. I'm standing next to a 41 gnome warrior and some 47 orc warrior comes up and see us. He stops and I wave. Just being friendly. 
---
I see him adjusting his distance. Not too close. But measuring up for a charge. I move out of the way and he takes out the 41 warrior next to me. I manage to get away, the rest of my group shows up and we manage to exact some small revenge by killing every single horde we met between the meeting stone and the zone entrance.
---
This is wow not overwatch
---
Is it? I dunno. Just made it up
---
Hold my downvote bruh
---
If you hop up around the walls outside of that cave you can get on the other side.
---
I like being useful but not in the spotlight, usually. I'm not a big fan of tanking in classic and while I like healing dungeons I suspect I won't enjoy healing raids (which is true in retail and other mmos I've tried healing in). So I'm kind of looking for a dps class that has some tools I can use to help the group out in a way that's appreciated/useful but not super mandatory and going to end up stressful - which also means having space in the class's rotation/playstyle to use those tools. Any class/spec suggestions??? In retail I leaned towards hunter, but a lot of their usefulness there doesn't seem to exist in classic (have to stand still for autoshoot, fragile pets with no utility, etc).
---
as a gnome rogue i feel somewhat targeted.
---
Whats COD sorry?
---
Imagine trying to fight a 40 ele shaman multi boxer in AV.
---
I would just /afk if I was a paladin.
---
Well we wanted no changes didn't we?
---
PvP lag was always there and was always bad. Not just 5-10 second delay bad but freeze your computer for a minute then disconnect bad.
---
omg lmao ofc right.
---
Now that's a Classic story :)
---
I hope someday I can understand why people like you do this kind of stuff. It seems so sad like maybe you have little control over your own life so you use the game to feel some type of power. PvP is great and I would never play on a PvE server but people like you can sometimes ruin it. You know what you are doing is cowardly and cheesy.
---
see above
---
So, a hunter
---
It was supposed to lead to Mount Hyjal zone.

One of the many things that never made it into the game.

Arms is basically your tanking spec until 60. There's one or two things to grab in the prot tree early on I think but it's mostly arms.
---
Your opinion is not important to them anymore....they are focusing on the Chinese market....look at how they forgo human right and embrace Chinese censorship
---
That literally doesn’t not matter if that’s the basis of your argument. Whether the quality is shit or not, you can CLEARLY see the problem being addressed on my post. 
---
I just don’t comprehend your incessant need for being a rude person.

Im good

Remember doing this.  Don't remember what I was after though.
---
There was a gnome named this on Deviate Delight.   Yes he was RPing selling cats.
---
No ones gonna mention the lotion and Kleenex lmao
---
Should have shielded when you got an opening instead of fear, undead rogue will expect you to fear and you have to wait it out until he uses his cool downs wait out cheap shot and kidney shot then fear and dot and win, if you lest a rogue rest early you’re pretty much dead
---
Okay. I see deleted posts in those threads where youre fighting with him.  May have been someone else calling him out for it being doctored or whatever.
---
That's why my hunter's name and pet name I had in vanilla and used again in classic are the best:
---
My name: Buffmeplz
---
My pet name: BuffmeTooPLZ
---
“Git gud noob” is the free space lol
---
You're a rogue, your job is to make everyone else salty.   
---
No I'm joking.   This particular drop should have been reserved, it's not your fault that your raid leader was sloppy.  
---
And just so you know, thunderfury is BiS for rogues up until naxx.  It's just more BiS for a main tank.  
---
PS:  10 arcanite bars.  Start saving.  And you have to get the other to binding to drop so that's another 1 in 30 chance to get.
---
Nah, at this point of classic you don't need to exclude MT from dkp. I am MT RL and I pay for items like everyone else do. We will see that in future content but MC/Ony doesn't really need that. And yeh, we have everything down.
---
the ol' classic Insult+ignore combo.
---
Who? China or the dude I was replying to?
---
That sounds awesome!
---
If that is the case and we get the updated blue sets in P2 I have heard they are way to over tuned compared to other accessible gear at the time, I haven't looked into it myself but would this not be an issue with that?
---
Make sure pws is always on. And just use all you offensive skills.
---
He rolled it first. 😂
---
You're missing the point that it's allowed by ToS and legitimate game play.
---
You're right, just me, a pebble. But a thousand people? A million? Mountains are built from mere pebbles. But hey it's ok I get it, you need to rationalize supporting a company that directly supports a totalitarian regime. Not everyone can give up things they like due to human rights abuses.
---
I'm in. COD me the game board
---
Shadow form gives you a huge boost in killing speed I can tell. If you want to play heal priest I still recommend not to change into healspec before 60. You should be able to heal nearly every situation with a lvl spec.
---
Und ich bin auf Everlook leider.
---
Pay 2 win

Thought id need to wait longer so bought normal epic like 2 weeks ago haha oh well, got 1k gold left so might get both
---
And it's not even look aroused with blush and sexy pose. It's just her outfit (which is classic set) and you already called her hoe, well done mate.
---
There are tons of screwed up people out there some of which play video games.
---
Similar situation, on Retail: Jump in, use all your burst cooldowns and dps the shit outta the mob...
---
Using chick as an insult really reveals how poorly you must think of women. If the point of this post was to humiliate the person you spoke to, I think it rather does the opposite.

So they dispelled your ability, who cares? Its a huge mmo, just walk away. Whispering them just to bitch makes their defensive response completely expected, whether they are objective wrong or not. I don’t know what you thought you would accomplish here honestly.
---
Whats that and can horde do it? Im literally 37 and at 14g...these fucking healing abilities are killing me..
---
I have gel inserts in my shoes which makes a huge difference :)
---
Interesting, my experience with Sulfuras as a shammy is always getting ganked by druids in STV. YMMV I guess.
---
Its highlighting a funny/lucky coincidence.
---
It's incredibly easy. Spirit tap + wand specialization and shadow is questing heaving. Plus you don't have to spec into holy from 1-60 for dungeons. I've been running BRD as a 55 healer specc'd exclusively in shadow and disc.
---
I play a rogue but there aren't as many of us as I was expecting. Trust me though if you're a rogue less rogues is better.
---
Only comment I see deleted is the one where he shows “proof” with screenshots. I’m trying to ignore it but something about people just being shitty for no reason or for “content” is really annoying.
---
Try a free action potion. At least it will give you a fighting chance.
---
..that's what I'm saying. I didn't realize it said melee attack power.
---
That’s the wrecker express
---
Real multi boxer here.
---
This! 1000% percent
---
&gt; I never said it did. I said time played full stop. Nowhere did I say IRL time invested.
---
Then saying they've played for five times as long makes no sense at all.
---
&gt; All I hear is wahh fucking wahh.
---
&gt; Seriously get over it. You aren't making a point by saying it's unfair. It's world pvp. It's ALWAYS unfair. You pretend we don't understand how 5 characters can beat 1 in a fight. We do. We just get over it because that's the world of warcraft that you play. Don't like it? Uninstall.
---
This is the point in the conversation where you've realize your mistake but you are too arrogant to admit it, so now you're going the route of calling everyone crybabies for pointing out pay-to-win mechanics.
---
I don't whine and cry when five guys roll up on me in world PVP because that's how the game is meant to be played.  That's how it's designed: for five people grouped to be more powerful than just one.
---
Hence why one person controlling five characters is unbalanced.  You pay 5x as much to be equivalent to five people.
---
&gt;I have gel inserts in my shoes
---
Ah I play PvE (ew, right lol) and I never see stuff like this.
---
So this is par for the course. Got it.
---
Thats not even remotely close to one shot tho, thats two global cds in a stun that can be blocked or blinked. Point is, if you kill a mage as a warrior, he is bad or you caught him in a ridiculously disadvantageous situation.
---
Nice one!
---
Loot council us usually the way to go, and over a larger sample size of raids, they may turn out to make sense in the long run.
---
They should be clear(er) in their communication regarding loot system. That being said, "more helpful to the guild" is definitely not an invalid reason - at least it doesn't have to be. This also includes out-of-raid activity such as hunters running Mara princess runs, helping guildies with your professions etc.
---
Whether you stay or not is up to you. I doubt they are interested in running their guild into the ground this early, but the truly bad loot councils are out there.
---
Classic has been designed to be, and has been *openly advertised as being* as close to the Vanilla experience as possible. Now if this issue did not infact exist in the Vanilla patch being, for lack of a better word, emulated in the current version of Classic, then fair enough it does deserve to be fixed because we are then not getting the advertised product. Now I wasn't big on druids back in Vanilla, I only capped a Warrior and a Rogue, so I can't say for sure if this is the case. But since you've not actually shown me anything that would lead me to believe that this is the case, I stand by my statement which is that this is the experience until proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, to be otherwise. You've not got to like it by any means, I'm not a huge fan of the frankly incomplete and poorly put together talent trees myself. But this is Phase 1 of a game that Blizzard previously claimed to be essentially deleted, so honestly I'd not be all that surprised to find that they've managed to make new bugs. But just like in Vanilla, you're going to have to find these new ones yourself, because in true Vanilla fashion, no one truly, 100% knows what works and what doesn't.
---
If anything, there being bugs people are now having to discover themselves and work around makes it more in line with Vanilla than it otherwise would have been, because back in the days of Vanilla you didn't have massive banks of shared knowledge right from the get go, you couldn't just go look up a rotation and the ideal stats, you had to either ask in chat and hope for a serious and informative reply that also happened to be correct, or test things yourself.
---
So *yes*, this is the experience. Buggy, and full of both fun and inconvenient surprises. Couldn't have gotten more Vanilla if they'd tried.
---
If you're wondering what happened, on ties there's a coin flip in the background you don't see.
---
We found him boys
---
you won it. it's yours. tell em to piss off.
---
Yeeeea buddy
---
1 minute of auto attacking to kill mobs?
---
No wonder paladins just alt tab and watch adult content.
---
Priests getting pwnd by rogues for a good 15 years now. Very little in classic wow to do about it. It shouldn't be a honor kill, not that we have that yet, for rogues (or rouges since that's back too)
---
Try AOE farming in caster instead, apply dots to 4-5 mobs. Apply rejuv, hit barkskin and hurricane everything down. Than go bear and clean up. Here is a video https://youtu.be/V9sI38mG46k
---
Honestly, its not a very good rogue raiding weapon. Just a PvP/status thing at best.
---
If it makes you feel better, you probably won't ever get the other bindings so its a moot point.
---
anytime after you got your last rank of direct heal and hot, but anything below 60 is an aggro magnet so you have to be super careful if they are doing minimum trash clears.
---
&gt; Also, is tanking generally considered a stressful or high skill cap position?
---
I'm still leveling.  Last night I tanked 5 back to back runs of SM Cath and followed it with a single run as dps.  All 6 runs were smooth and quick as we all knew what to do.  
---
The run I dps'd was almost boring for me.  So much less to think about.  Tanking has more to consider in a dungeon, that doesn't mean its more stressful though.
---
As the other guy implied, you d have to automate the login with a macro or something similar. Only the launcher has the ability to skip the login screen, there's no way to emulate that if you launch the WoW executable directly.
---
Holy shit, can you actually not read? I said you two were dumb in response to you saying that people are insane if they like classic itemization.
---
My friend has done 47 rend runs for his true strike shoulders, he has seen it drop 6-7 times, lost ever roll. I got my shoulder my 1st run at lvl 56
---
Group up and turn on Master Looter. Problem solved.
---
From there I'd go 5/5 into Holy Spec so you can dip 5/5 into Divine Fury. From there I'd pick up the rest of the Disc points to help with mana and finish out Holy after that. Reason being is getting your heals down to 2.5 second cast time will be a top priority. Having 3 second heals is slow, harder to deal with, and just annoying. Second priority after that is dealing with mana issues.
---
Its around 60 for all classes, it can vary very slightly but not much.
---
There is a destruction talent that turn him into a mini burst cannon that will do 26-32% of total damage againstsingle targets mobs. It’s the one where you can put two points to decrease the time between his fire bolts. Highly recommend this as you can more quickly kill things before your dots run out. You need to let him rest between fights though to regen mana.
---
To be fair, if you’re good enough you’ll be in the “inner circle” in no time. 
---
Good guilds aren’t recruiting right now, at all, on any server, they’re all from private servers and have full rosters, the rest of us are trying to get into at best the 7/10 guilds that are left. 
---
If you’re good at your class, and actually put the effort in to get your gear, you’ll perform better than 90%+ of the competition and they’ll be gagging to get you into the inner circle. 
---
Be good, be rewarded, that’s how loot council works. If you’re consistently top 5 in your role and not being shown priority for loot, because a “class lead” is 20th and getting drops, find a new guild. 
---
Almost all of these posts complaining about Loot Councils are from the 17th place dps that hasn’t bothered to farm more than 3 of his pre raid bis. If you’re that guy, you don’t deserve loot.
---
The network overhead for wow is fairly light
---
This. You can plan ahead on what level you are able to complete that red quest that will give each shammy a shiny new stick to beat down mobs that will be viable for the next 10 levels.

You cant trade with someone ignoring u

---
Same here.  Still have my fingers crossed it will fill up more.
---
hey look its me -   
---
I tried Druid for the reasons you suggested but something about it didnt sit right. I think its the lack of feel of OOMF when you upgrade your weapon.   
---
Shaman has been really fun though so far. I can heal when I need to - my totems give all kinds of fun buffs for the situation, I can turn into a fucking wolf, say again - IM A WOLF, and he hits a lot harder thatn my druid did. Been fun so far but only about lvl 30
---
Probably a few at that
---
Gehennas vs Firemaw?
---
Which one has the highest pop? The most balanced faction ratio?
---
Wear? not exactly, but definitely use, since engineering has a lot items that require engineering to use.
---
Exe's Cleaver is honestly better, slower and more damage (minus the proc on we wuz kangz)
---
But We Wuz Kangz is a purple and people think that is impressive somehow. 
---
Usually exe's is cheaper.  Basically WW axe's bigger brother.
---
Make a healer gear for intances, basically a cloth gear.
---
Nah, I was basically a god. #humble
---
In contrast, I’ve had tanks insist I sheep one of two adds and then get mad when I break my own sheep early cause it’s two fricken adds and the one is almost dead
---
58 is pretty much the minimum for MC for all classes. I went in as a tank at 58, and while I didn't have much of a problem surviving, I definitely had problems with holding threat. The change from 58-&gt;59 was instantly a noticeable improvement. As a healing druid, 58 should be just fine for you.
---
I love those "hidden" stories in WoW. It makes us imagine what happened
---
Oh snap!
---
I leveled faster than one of my buddies but have had enough time to make a 2nd char that I just kinda leave at whatever level he is at so we can still do dungeons and stuff
---
my first char isnt 60 yet but its more fun for sure
---
1%crit=29spellpower=54int
---
I had blackstone ring drop my first run as well. Lost it to a dps warrior guildie. Cool whatever, I'll get it eventually. The day after this dude hits 60 he fucking nukes his character randomly in a dungeon and is never heard from again. Fucker took the ring and didn't even utilize it much.
---
They dont go back to 0, they drop it in favor of another profession entirely.  Usually engineering, which has a LOT of items that are bind on pickup and also require engineering to use.
---
DKP can be just as abused. I've seen people inflate the bids on items just to waste points on people that might compete with them for something they care more about, and it rewards those that bucket sit the most while putting people with more sane schedules at the bottom of the pile.
---
I've gotten myself stuck in a chimney in wpl and in a tree at felwood so those places seem like a pretty good choice
---
Cost/Charge on Delivery. You have to pay the cost to accept the mail, otherwise you can return it to the sender.
---
Isn't the first 1% hit from gear ignored?
---
Nice try, bud.
---
It's not a snowflake thing. It's just what you'd call that in-between generation gap. Depending on who you ask, the start and stop years for generations are different. Micro-generations incorporate those years and take a bit from either of the generations before and after. My learning in elementary and middle school was completely different than my learning in high school because the internet wasn't around until I was in high school. The Xennial generation is that micro-generation between Gen X and Millennials who learned how to do things the old fashioned way and the new way.
---
Yeah first part of UBRS is easy. 2nd part not so much. Those assassins hurt.
---
now that's what i call classic 44
---
Some people do. It's only worth it because this robe will be BiS for them for 4-5 phases (i.e., close to a year minimum, maybe even longer).
---
The effort it will take to get full blue pvp gear in P2 is beyond the same for getting equivalent blue from dungeons.  It will take weeks, if not months to reach that point, while you can get full blues in a week of grinding, with good luck.
---
BiS is another story and besides the point.
---
Also, we haven't gotten an update of whether you need to remain that rank to use the gear.  In early vanilla, you had to maintain your rank to use the gear.  Which is why it has a rank listed on the pieces.  To use the R14 weapons, you had to stay rank 14.
---
That alone will make PvP gear being overtuned acceptable.  It's not gear you can get and keep forever, you have to actively work to keep it.
---
That does happen yes, its not as bad as it sounds if your level 60 because oyyu can easily farm the 400 or so of each cloth to spam level tailoring get the needed recipe then have the item. I wouldn't say its exactly easier than just getting a drop out of DM or something, but its a thing you are in complete control over.
---
Right, but if I want that item and decide to farm for it after someone that cant even use it ninjas it, I'm likely going to be almost a full level or more past the required level before it drops again... and that's IF it drops...
---
IIRC it talks a little bit of shit to the fire as well.
---
&gt; but if you don't you fall so far back.
---
Fall back in what? Who or what are you racing?
---
And depending on what you answer, my follow-up would be: Why?
---
You're expected to know a bit more about the dungeon but nothing crazy. Honestly what I've been doing in using the map/guides where the bosses amd quest items and whatnot are marked on the dungeon map in numerical order of the most efficient path. Then I just alt-tab to check the map between pulls when ppl are drinking or if I'm not sure where to go.
---
You have the time for a quick alt tab to keep going the right way, you're the tank so they need to/should wait for you anyways.
---
The 5% increment discounts were not in vanilla/are not in classic. 10% or bust for rep. 5/10/15/20 was added in TBC I think.
---
You will have 305 as combat and only need 6%hit at 305 weapon skill at 308 your glancing blows do more dmg and at 315 you only need 5%hit although get to 315 isn't worth it
---
Congrats on your new shadow priest
---
Cash on Delivery.  You sell items through mail.  Person A sends runecloth to Person B with a COD amount of 1.3g.  Person B pays 1.3g to receive the mail and that gold is sent back to person A.  It's a feature of wow's mailbox
---
The mount costs 900, the skill is all the same. It doesnt change untill later.
---
But whats the rush? You're going to be grinding the same dungeons for gear after you hit 60, so in the long run it's going to save you time.
---
Your Dwarf has a nice beard.
---
The difference between Imp PW:F and Martyrdom feels pretty negligible while leveling. In theory Martyrdom should be more useful, but I didn't notice it much while leveling so I'm not sure it matters where those 2 points go.
---
Actually I'd even say OP could put those 2 points into Silent Resolve because a lot of leveling tanks tend to have threat issues - partially due to the learning curve, but partially because a lot of them just aren't tank spec at all.
---
I usually (*usually)* only attack players who either attack me first or of the same level as me and not in combat.  I think killing someone questing while you're in a group is kind of douchey or killing someone by themselves when they have low health/mana and no CD's from fighting mobs; its cheap, there's not skill.  That being said, once I'm ganked under these circumstances, I generally abandon questing and focus on killing everything that I can.
---
I agree with this. I transferred from Whitemane two weeks to ago to Arcanite Reaper and it seems like it’s growing. Obviously the server drops in the evening, just like vanilla servers did, but it seems alright. We will have to see how it is in a month, it wasn’t a release server and most people did not go super hard leveling. This has caused most of the people that are already 60 to be transfers, I’m pretty sure the people that leveled on this server from 1 are in the mid 40’s to low 50’s right now.
---
They convert life to mana, they are also trying not to waste your renew by letting it overheal (so they'll tap), and also they'll tap away from full so they can benefit from passive regen.
---
I mean... bruh what are you complaining about? 
---
"The majority of players wont get to rank 10"
---
"Wouldnt pvp gear be super overtuned?"
---
Do you think people shouldnt be rewarded for there effort
---
This is a streamer controlling 40 accounts. Specifically to kill asmon gold and other alliance streamers on faerilina.
---
You could do East and West maybe
---
North I think is decently challenging at 60
---
Then again healers get away with a lot of shit
---
Are you afraid nobody will run MC/ONY when BWL is released? I think you'll want to farm up MC/Ony just to be invited to BWL. Maybe a hardcore guild could clear it in blues, but there are some gear checks, IIRC.
---
I cant wait for Blizzard to announce that the microtransaction shop is coming to classic! With our exclusive Demon Hunter!
---
So I suppose the priority should be Execute &gt; Bloodthirst &gt; whirlwind &gt; heroic strike
---
Regardless of whether you're using a fast or slow mainhand
---
Not if misses are knocking crits off the result table or if some of your attacks cant crit. The former only matters when you have a lot more crit from gear than hit, but i imagine there exist realistic gear sets that run up against the effective crit cap for fury warriors and sf rogues.
---
You'll be able to dungeon instantly and will probably get whispers the moment you log on in the evening.
---

---
Agreed. Also he was 59....MC was cleared by a bunch of almost 60s in the first week or two. For all we know, since nobody is super geared yet, he could have been outperforming some of those fresh 60s on rotation quality alone. Let alone spec and gear. Bullshit that he’d be passed over on gear when the loot rules didn’t include “only 60s can roll”
---
Is your IQ ok pleboid
---
Only you can prevent forest fires.
---
They're both really good! Ban'thok Sash is BiS for PvP too, so I rank it slightly higher for its dual purpose.
---
In the alternatives tab, I list Dustfeather Sash and Thuzadin Sash. I think they're all really good.
---
Thuzadin Sash is definitely better from a pure PvE healing standpoint, so I'll change it on the PvE tab.
---
Not what I was setting you up for,  but still an acceptable response
---
No I'm not listing out all 15 microgenerations because each group will want their own. Those are the big 4, everyone gets them, use critical thinking and understand someone at the Snake Person end of Gen X will be more snake person like and someone at the Boomer end of Gen X will be more boomer like. We don't need separate labels.
---
I dunno what that other guy is talking about in regards to colors. I can tell who is who just fine.
---
But the screenshot does not show the hunter (you) passing on the item, so it's a fair enough question.
---
When I am playing mage and someone else is taking my farming spot and being a dick about it I poly one of their targets so they heal up in between blizzards and run to mess them up.
---
sometimes
---
Gotta tab back every 30 seconds to refresh your rank 1 seal.
---
&gt;as of last night it was showing 74% alli
---
How are you getting that stat? Last time I checked, blizzard disabled the functionality that addons used to gather census data.
---
You knows thats just all bs right? All that will happen if you say that, is that youll end up in the stockades
---
I'm pretty grateful to have 4 out of the 5 I started with still playing. The ones who stuck it out have been 60 at least a week now. The one who quit is a big bummer because it was my friends dad. We used to get out of highschool and go over to his place cause he had 2 extra computers and would see his dad up in his office playing. It was like a holy shit moment to see someone older than us playing and enjoying it. Let alone raiding and raid leading or class officer I get it mixed. He tried it for a bit. Got a mage a warrior and a priest all up to 20+ but just couldn't stick it out and dropped it on us he wouldn't renew his sub after the first month. Big bummer. On the plus side 2 of the ones coming back to play had started in BC or WoTLK and are really enjoying it atm. One hit 60 before any of us.
---
people who roll on PvP servers generally like to kill other players
---
Great, another circlejerk thread where people personally attack each other over what they used to/currently abbreviate a Deadmines run as.

They did open paid character transfers towards the end of vanilla.
---
Lock playstyle can be called, "functional chaos"
---
It is a lot of juggling variables and I find it super fun. You can handle 3 mobs between you and your pet and its a mad game of whack-a-mole. Your pet, your health, your mana, your fear, and your soulstones are your resources and a good warlock uses all of them to their full potential.

Tl;dr: do it, bro. Do it!

Fuck everything about your attitude, no one required you do to shit but dont be surprised when people send you tells calling you a prick.
---
Acceptable responses
---
And move it off to the side so there is a place for OPs legs
---
It's heavily reliant on the player and software used.  It also depends on how closely they are toeing the line with regards to botting and single input, multiple output programmings.
---
But you wouldn't have killed all the mobs yourself, because he would still be here and killing half of them, maybe still getting all the drop while you get none.
---
And if you group up, he might stick around and help you kill the remaining mobs for your drops (which you get all of because he is done) whereas if you don't group up, he'll definitely go away.
---
The only way you may be better of solo is when you are way faster then him killing mobs.
---
what if SHE has it backwards.
---
my god.... how did you not get ganked while farming this?
---
Wow this is bad, don't help these shit birds gear up. Leave now.

Cleaver better . The strength

I cancelled my subscription. There are other games. I would just feel guilty still supporting a company like that. IMO, they (and others) need to be sent a message that their actions will not be tolerated.
---
I'm a 33 hunter with 2d9h played, with my professions in a similar range to yours. And I've done exactly one dungeon (WC run in my early 20s). 
---
So I think you're doing fine. Or maybe we're both going hella slow. But who cares, as long as we're enjoying the journey.
---
correct
---
“That can easily be healed”, multiply it by 20+ people and we are talking about a good chunk of healers mana in “easy heals”. That’s the difference between 3h full MC run and a 4h+ with few wipes here and there and paying the potion cost in repairs.
---
Night elf druid haha, you can tank and you can pretend to be a not as good rogue
---
goddamn it, you're right
---
Mage bad,

Upvote me

Do like I did when I had problem deciding. Go make a druid 😄 then u can focus on 1 char and play all the roles u want
---
Are hunters supposed to be hard against shaman? I don't think I've lost a fight to one, yet
---
LOL this is a multiplayer game so....no!
---
There is a add on that changes rare mobs' golden dragon around their unit frame to a silver dragon, tso that you will know that its a not-elite but just rare.
---
Ultimately play what you have fun with.  I know I leveled as combat swords.  Bladefurry is just so good.  Evasion/Bladefurry is a free 2 kills every 3.5min.  I hate being combat against frost mages though... Maces will work fine, only difference between maces and sword is slight dps loss due to 2 hit proc.  The stun increase from talents on maces should be cool for pvp though in combat.  I can't talk too much about hemo, I think any weapon will work fine with that so long as you have a slow high damage main hand, same as combat.
---
It's why I rerolled warrior and never looked back early in vanilla.
---
Paladins are an incredibly low-interactivity class.
---
Depends, horde side has much less room to play with threat. There's no point in gearing your fury warriors if their dps is hard capped by the tanks threat anyway
---
I only /spit on people that try to crash me on Toxic Horrors then over pull and die.

Advice, do maraudon, get the scepter of celebras and farm there.  
---
The runs are very very easy (once you get the rythm down), i knocked my level from 48 to 51 in 2 days (2h played first day, and 5 hours played the second day).
---
Im probably going to knock lvl 52 down today and maybe look for another area, but i've heard wester plaguelands is CROWDED as fuck by other mages (a friend of mine is fighting over pulls with other mages there)   
---
TL:DR; do Maraudon, get scepter of celebras and farm (refer to the mage goldmaking guide in icy veins for a video showcase of this method)
---
You’re already playing different characters which is what I wound have recommended. What’s wrong with that? Not really sure what your question is
---
Heirloms killed low to mid lvl BGs for all those who don't have them. It means newcomer can never compete with somebody who already got max character, no matter how good are they
---
If you bring someone to the raid and have not  discussed specific loot rules, then they should be able to get the loot.
---
Yea but who knows what blizzard will do for classic.  I’m not sure they’ve talked about it. I’m hoping they’ll talk about transfers soon, trying to move my room between two accounts.

It didn't in this particular run, but when I ran UBRS and need rolled and won a drop from Rend against another warrior, I passed on the belt from Drakk to him.
---
Mages are far worse IMO
---
The WoW mounts are generally based on whatever the mounted Hero units in War3 rode.
---
Death Knight, Far Seer, Priestess of the Moon, and Archmage.
---
Wish they'd thought a little harder about Gnome mounts.
---
You can't poly tagged mobs though
---
Interesting goal you set yourself there. I just reached 300 with tailoring, engineering and First Aid
---
When why conversate?
---
You can disenchant soulbound items if you take up enchanting.
---
Not LotR, same universe, different age
---
I have one more question then, considering that it's better to be spamming WW over HS, it seems like damage-wise a slower mainhand is far preferable to a fast one, but at which point does it become using a slow vs fast MH when the fast weapon has more dps?
---
For example Eshkander's right claw has around 48 DPS and is a very fast MH. How much dps would a slower mainhand have to be for me to justify switching down to it to maximize my damage generated?
---
No one cares, fuck off.
---
Yes get fishing and go farming for certain reagents drops. Nightfin fish, mystery meat, and a few others are the standard Raiding consumable for food. Grind your reagents yourself and sell the food in person or on AH right before Raid times.
---
Unfortunately you do get ganked sometimes, but its more so because they want the devilsaur your killing.
---
You will be able to find spots for any dungeon extremely easily as a tank. Last night I had the single longest wait for a dungeon group of my Classic WoW experience, and it was a 10 minute wait. Others talk about waiting 30-45 minutes and then disbanding because they can't find a tank. You will always be in high demand, and pretty much always receive whispers from strangers/friends for dungeons, sometimes while you're in a dungeon yourself. 
---
For raids, I'd be very surprised if you got to tank unless it was a full pug group and/or you put it together yourself. It's the least needed class for any raid content, so almost every guild has their 3 tanks identified and that's pretty much all they need. 
---
It can be considered stressful, because you're generally the one setting the pace. However, I find it to be the most rewarding. I've played DPS classes in MMO's for 6 years now, and recently made the switch to tanking, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to most DPSing. There are some pretty obvious downsides too, first and foremost being the repair costs, but overall I think tanking is well worth the effort.
---
These people are real. I killed a quest mob in a Thousand Needles in a group of 5 and this Tauren who was in another group got really mad because we tagged the mob first, he told me i griefing and that i was going to be banned now.
---
Fuck Dal Rends, that FR Gyth Helm!
---
wack. its just for lulz...
---
You’re one of them huh
---
It's the only way to "punish" someone in your own faction.  But it just makes you look like an impotent crybaby.  Ironically these are going to be the folks that have half the server on ignore by 60 and will wonder why they hardly see advertisements for dungeons.
---
It *was* Blizzard that said it. It was Blizzard Taiwan.
---
Tencent having some stock in Blizzard does *not* mean it was them that said it. This guy is spreading lies.

I’m not sure what to do with this information.
---
Don’t forget about berserker rage..you can pop it before you head into a group of mobs. It’ll keep you with plenty of rage to hold aggro.
---
Thanks mate. Grew to last.
---
just quest ,past lvl 40 quest gives alot of money
---
Judging by OP's purple name, he's a warlock. Reed is 29sp, DM warlock trinket is 23. You do the math.
---
not a phase, just when Dire Maul is released next week.
---
You people are fucking flying through this content.
---
I don't think I'd pay that much- at the point that you're charging a large portion of the cost of the mats, I'd prefer to buy them myself and sell runs to other warlocks. At 50g, I'd consider it.
---
Was this a thing back in Vanilla?
---
This sorta rings a bell.
---
1) Whirlwind is an extra attack. It deals your weapons damage.
---
2) Even though it seems heroic strike might hit hard, it is actually your normal white swing + a pitiful amount of added damage. Don't give heroic strike credit for a 500 damage swing if your white hit was already going to be 450, it only gained you 50 damage.
---
3) Heroic strike turns a white swing that would gain rage into a yellow swing that consumes rage. This means heroic strike costs more than 15 rage, it also costs the amount you lost from the white swing you could've had
---
Never use heroic strike unless you're sitting at high rage with nothing to spend it on.
---
Granted I’m only in 1080p, but even with graphics on max, mine doesn’t seem this crisp looking. Just an illusion from being shrunk down?
---
If you want like how Night Elves look then by all means play Night Elf. Your characters race is what you'll be staring at and you'll be staring for a long time, if you like how your character looks you'll be better off. 
---
For the rogue vs warrior debate that's up to you. Both are great in PvP and PvE so really just level both up to 20 and whichever you enjoyed more stick with that.
---
I am running almost the same SM ruin spec as someone responding above except I moved two points into improved drainsoul and I use that to boost soloing efficiency by casting rank 1 right before the mob dies (and macroing to delete a soul shard if my souls bag is full.)
---
With 302 spellpower right now I top damaged overall for the four mc boss run my guild did yesterday and top damaged by a huge margin on Onyxia (102k 8.3%.) I will say in earlier raid tiers while your imp is still a few percent of you damage on non fire immune bosses, SM ruin is just as good as demonic sacrifice if you get permission to use a corruption. The issue is you have to be more careful with timing your consumables to keep replenishing mana when you are burning through more. During that Onyxia I used my healthstone, 3 major manas, and two bandages to replenish mana, in addition to some healers throwing me hots phase 2 and early phase 3.
---
Even in higher raid tiers you will still have at least two warlocks running sm/ruin for the sake of applying the imp stamina buff to melee groups. At prebis gear levels, a perfect world nonstop casting scenario gives a warlock 27dps for applying a corruption over spamcasting shadowbolt without accounting for nightfall. SM ruin then comes with nightfall procs aswell. With more careful resource management and a debuff slot, sm ruin easily out damages DS, but those debuff slots will become more and more scarce in higher raid tiers with on hit debuffs and things like a shadow priest needing at least two becoming more common.
---
Youre an alt-oholic. It doesnt matter which class you play. You cant judge a class til lvl 60 so at some point before 60 you will probably get bored of warlock and think another class is even cooler.
---
Its hard to do, but you gotta commit to a class all the way. Dropping mage at lvl 15 before you get the majority of spells that make a mage unique isnt a good representation of mage so you dont truly know if you like it. Same with rogue.
---
&gt; because of this.
---
what?
---
Oh! I did not know this. I thought the gold earned from the questst would be a hidden value that would be added on top of the quest reward. If so, then that's great! Maybe it's better to just not quest at all and spam dungeons and then go back and finish all the quests!
---
Some people cant have "just one drink"
---
They do. 
---
 Then the bottle is gone.
---
I just didn't need 3 extra nature damage for mobs I was one-shotting. I knew i was just gonna rebuff myself eventually anyway. It shouldn't be a big deal for me to click off a R1 thorns.
---
Back in BC one of my earliest raiding guilds used an all in DKP system.   You want the item you spend all of your dkp it gave priority to people who showed up everytime and stopped people from buying everything out from under newer raiders.
---
Hands across Kalimdor.
---
Loot council is such a good system for serious raiding, but so difficult for casual raiding. 
---
In a guild where every player is entitled, it will never work. In a guild where every player is selfless, it's the best tool ever.
---
you can type cyrillic in chat just fine though
---
If you want to fake something, work on your photoshop skills at least...
---
You can clearly see the black corners on each icon which you probably cut out of the upper left.
---
Buy two skinning knives, enchant one each. Profit.
---
Did you swipe right
---
I get ganked just by staring at the devilsaur (im not even a skinner). 
---
congrats on the farm. May gold overflow your bags
---
Don't believe so. I wouldn't expect anything before Phase 2, which is when layering is scheduled to go away. After that it's still only a possibility, not a certainty.
---
Did not know this. Thanks for that info
---
The worst is when you don’t backstab someone or even help them and they 2v1 you once they’re done. Yesterday me and another rogue teamed up and killed them  one by one like 5 times haha
---
Oh thats cool, TIL, thanks
---
Badlands has some nice quests at 40, then Duskwallow and Swamp of Sorrows. Between those you should be at least 42 at which point you can do feralas and then tanaris.
---
Thorium bars was like 80% of the cost to power level gnomish engineering. 
---
and if I drop it and go goblin it's the same pain again.
---
did the exact opposite with less days played too funny - but I deleted my druid. What was it about the druid you liked over shammy?
---
Why respond? Good question. Probably because I am outgoing and usually can't help myself.
---
go to WPL find the level 50-52 farm starting killing those mobs not a bad leveling speed while getting argent dawn rep and tokens
---
Can I be a night elf priest? I'd probably climb as high as I could in the mountains surrounding Teldrassil and use shadowmeld.
---
&gt; I think ...killing someone by themselves when they have low health/mana and no CD's from fighting mobs; its cheap, there's not skill. 
---
But... the ability they gave me is called cheap shot.
---
you have no idea how freedom of speech works
---
The latter sounds like a horrendous system unless you have absolutely nobody available who is trustworthy enough to me Master Looter (in that case, it's not a guild I would like to be in). 
---
Even in an "everybody rolls for everything" loot scenario, which I very much prefer to DKP or loot council, I'd still want a ML to make sure no dumbfuckery happens. No hunter need on melee weapons, no second gear needs, TF for tanks, no healers rolling for caster DPS trinkets, no "oooops" rolls, no need rolls on BoE for auction house, ...
---
Your allowed to have that opinion... just not here this Violates Rule Number 5 on the Subreddit. People need to stop posting it.
---
To be fair, I also read it that way at first glance and immediately jumped to thinking "why the hell would OP post this, they're going to get roasted". Had to re-read it to clarify.
---
Yikes is getting mint ice cream with lavender sprinkles cuz the bitch at Dairy Queen is quitting at the end of her shift and decided she's taking us all to ice cream Hell with her
---
I'd recommend full fury spec until you hit 40, at which point it's reasonable to switch to prot if you think you'll be mostly tanking for groups or arms if youd like to be able to play solo and level efficiently. Fury has a lot of tools to help you get through the early game, but Arms really stands out when you can take Sweeping Strikes.
---
Keep a 1H+shield on you at all times, and use macros to switch between stances when needed. You should be able to tank any dungeon from 1-40 in any spec, and most of the pre-60 dungeons in a solid fury or arms spec as well.
---
If it's not really that OP, why do people pay thousands of dollars per year to do it?
---
Awesome, ty
---
You don't think all the people posting on reddit with full Teir 1 rolled and won them legitimately, do you?
---
It’s part of the song 😂
---
Archeage: Unchained launches on the same day as DM.
---
Loot councils sadly often lead to this behavior. It's either the council taking everything for themselves or handing it of to their friends. Go join a guild that uses DKP or simply needs/greeds.
---
It doesn't work thaaat good, it is very nice and I used it for tanking, but it basically gives you green plates if the mobs are attacking you, yellow if they aren't targeting you, and red if they are targeting someone else.  It doesn't give you an indication of when you're about to lose threat, but it does let you know which mobs you have lost threat on so you can switch to them and pick them up.  Stuns do make them go yellow though since they stop targeting you.
---
I was wondering the same damn thing.
---
Yeah you can use 1 of each element at a time. Welcome to the sham club man, they're a lot of fun! I recommend keeping a shield and 1 hand on you to switch when you get into rough situations. You can switch weapons while in combat in case you didnt know
---
You should do some research my friend. Few experienced multiboxers run 5 of the same class. It's just not viable for anything endgame. Sure, the first 20 levels are great. After that? You need a dedicated tank, healer, and 3 dps.
---
I heard phase 2
---
I missed a letter there... is fixed~  
---
Suppose the other was true too.
---
Single-target chill warlock here: fuck these idiots.
---
The markets just blew up as of the announcement, I would basically break even currently.
---
Which boss?
---
I'll admit, very Karen.
---
Personally I’d go fury until 40 for tanking, then respec to arms after that. Piercing howl is pretty nice but I guess the meta these days is to always have mages so maybe it wouldn’t matter a whole lot.
---
The CC the second half does is pretty nuts! Stuns, assassins hit like trains, from memory there's also a gouge.
---
Deep fury splashing prot is perfectly fine. All of the worthwhile talents in prot are early in the tree anyway. You get the added bonus of extra threat from fury. Viable in this phase? No probably not.. However, lots of people have this tendency to aoe on pull and if you have to play against massive aoe threat on pulls then that spec will help you keep aggro.
---
get. a. frame.
---
Since they have restrictions on file sizes, the so called low quality one (25 MB) one was it. Its really detailed up close though, even though this photo I took is crap
---
If your are going for Tribal Leatherworking i would suggest the [turtles in tanaris](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=14123#skinning) , that way you farm thick leather and the turtle scales you will need lated on for the tribal quest chains in feralas
---
Combat drinking is a well known trick for speed running dungeons, and I use it pretty much every time I'm drinking. You start drinking, the tank pulls the next pack, when he gets low you get up from drinking, cast a gheal, before it puts you in combat you hit your water and start drinking again. With good timing you can get off gheal/renew and go back to drinking.
---
Targets don't need to be taking consistent heavy damage, they just need to be taking as much/more damage than a renew tick, which really isn't much. It's often enough to save me a few more mana ticks before I have to get back up and start healing, and in some groups, a gheal/renew is all I need for an entire pull. 
---
&gt;As for Renew, you're likely to overheal if you are always using it after a GHeal
---
In low level/overleveled dungeons, maybe? Once you start getting to like SM this wasn't the case at all for me. It depends on the group, but in any sort of speed running or melee cleave group that is semi-competent and decently geared you can massively reduce the amount of time the group is waiting on you to get mana back by properly combat drinking.
---
Not to mention, no healers will care about healing your pet.
---
No not really, hunters can get squashed by basically anyone with a slow, stun or immobilization. If you can get within their deadzone, they kind of fall over.
---
The preferred terminology is Speedsters. Even Dr Zoom doesn't call himself a Zoomer.
---
You people are faking these interactions for karma
---
First of all First Aid isn't even really a "profession" it's a secondary profession and does not take up one of the 2 profession slots. Engineering is relatively inexpensive to level off of the auction house, especially as a mage considering we can AOE farm 70+ gold an hour, and it's essential.
---
People often label engineering as some pvp tradeskill without realizing the multitude of benefits it has for PVE. Sapper charges pretty much completely trivialize multiple encounters most specifically Viscidus in AQ40 and Nefarian in BWL (skeletons). The combat pets can be summoned and then you can swap the trinket out and still keep the pet, with Battle Chicken proccing haste for your group and Arcanite Dragonling putting flame buffet (increased fire damage taken) on bosses come AQ+.
---
I would be so sad if I transferred off Whitemane. It’s very healthy now, huge pop with no queues.
---
That's rough when others want to run it for loot though.
---
You're thinking of DotA.
---
Alliance human warrior or horde orc warrior.
---
Alliance human rogue or undead rogue
---
Yeah, same with how it ruined twink gearing/farming as well. There's nothing to really farm for when all the Heirlooms are BiS for each bracket anyway.
---
First off, you won em fair and square, abiding by the loot rules in place.
---
Second, it's not like you actually have them yet. Elementium Ingots aren't coming out for another couple of months at least. If you already have MC on farm, you'll see a lot more bindings drop before anyone can start working on completing a TF. If it becomes an issue, just make sure tanks get a few bindings passed their way first.
---
Just wait for AV then. You’ll save both time and money
---
Why keep doing something you aren't enjoying on the off chance that they will get really into it months down the line? Chances are if you aren't enjoying it now when hype is still high then you won't be enjoying it later.
---
It was a 5% experience boost.
---
Yeah you're right.
---
do you really have to type like a 13 year old white girl?
---
If you don't complete the Chief Engineer Scooty quest, or never grab it, but then go on to complete a few other quests, it prevents you from ever getting the Chief Engineer Scooty quest.  Thus making it so you never get the Gnomer teleport.
---
I'm throwing my hat in with Druid.
---
You can decide after if you like tanking or rogue better, and if you like neither you can try healing, or booming.
---
Its your best bet.
---
I’m level 15, leveling in Silverpine alongside a troll and tauren. We don’t really like the aesthetic of the barrens. Next we are hitting hillsbrad foothills. Not sure what direction after.
---
Could you maybe expand on the leadership part of your comment?
---
actually, my enhance set is better than my healer set still, and since i'm running guildies through for their ring (which I have) I go about 50/50 heals or dps. I think its also that I'm on a late starting server (Netherwind) So we have a large chunk of our population in the 48-52 range.  I can get mara groups as DPS or heals almost constantly, but you see 0 shouts for people trying to sell the ring.
---
Sprite darter pet is great !
---
Hunter is probably tier 0 as far as 19 twinks go. If you don't mind being in a mirror match situation often, I'd say hunter is the way to go.
---
Im currently 33 on classic and not really enjoying the play style of Druid on classic, from the comments I’ve received im looking into warrior or shaman.
---
its for people who are too scared for pvp so they get the addon so they know when to run away
---
Now that's a good-looking shield!
---
Regardless of class stuff you aren't even 60, that is pretty casual as far as raiding goes. There were likely a dozen people in that raid who are no lifing and will probably play more hours a day and continue to play long after you quit. Taking that in context I think it is justified some people were angry. Honestly they probably would have gotten much more joy and use out of the item with a higher likelihood of actually finishing it. But its just a video game I guess. They should have had more strict rules honestly.
---
You can do this horde-exclusive repetable quest on desolace, https://classic.wowhead.com/object=176582/shellfish-trap
---
Usually I get 8-10g per hour doing this. Make sure to use greater water breathing elixir or any water breathing spell to help.
---
What's up with the Onyxia head buff in regards to layers? We placed ours last night in Org (Stalagg) and nothing happened.
---
It's also 250g they spent that you don't have to.
---
When I left there were several hour long queues and I just don’t have the time to deal with that.
---
What situation is this a factor in?
---
There are 4 types of totems, earth, fire, water, and air. you can have one of each out at a time. To see what type a totem is, check the tooltip, it'll say something like "requires Earth Totem" and that tells you what type it is.
---
I love Archeus, used that on my paladin back in the day even though I had Verigan's just because I liked having the SoC + Arcane procs so much. Very nostalgic item for me.
---
I think your mace is The Pacifier? One of very few weapons with that staggeringly slow 4.0 speed.
---
I farm stocks or SM as a pally, prefer stocks due to less travel, it's pretty good.
---
I would definitely tank dungeons until then, tanks are in massive demand right now for basically all levels of dungeons. 
---
In terms of whether or not guild groups would take a fury warrior, it's definitely got less competition for entering a raid than a tank, but it could still depend on the group/guild you're running with. Of course, the trade-off is that there's more classes/people to roll against for gear, but I think that's a small price to pay to be able to raid.
---
The best way to farm gold, especially on a high pop realm/faction, isn't to farm at all... it's to play the AH with a profitable crafting profession.
---
Throughout the week, stock up on raw materials (herbs, elemental fire, winter squid, etc.). Craft them into consumables, and drop them on the AH on the common raid days. This will vary by server, but generally it's Tuesday, and sometimes Friday/Saturday. The trick is to get a feel on the day-to-day variation in prices on your realm, but generally raw materials prices are lowest on weekends (due to the number of players farming and adding these items to the economy), and consumables demand is the highest on raid nights.
---
Alchemy and Cooking are the best for this. Demand for potions and stat food only rise over time, while for your other crafting professions demand slowly declines as people get more and more dungeon/raid loot.
---
eewwww habs
---
You have to stable your pet, tame a new pet with the skill you want and then kill with it until you get notified you have learned the skill. Then you dismiss that pet pull your cat from the stable and you can train it.
---
I never intended to show off my skills or anything like that, i just personally found it kind of funny that the boss i needed to kill resisted 2 cone of colds from this gnome mage, at 1% hp
---
Great, could you please tell that to the stack of elemental shamans 1 shotting me with chain lightning.
---
O k
---
I was born in '78. So we're back to depending on who you ask, I'd be either a Gen X person or a Millennial.
---
That's cool. If 39 other people you raid with don't care, that's cool too. I care, so I'd find another guild that does too.
---
The math is correct, but the thought process is what is getting in the way here.  
---
The thing you have to remember, which I’m sure you realize if you’re able to do basic probability, is that each drop is independent.  So each kill still has that 33% chance.  In this context, it is likely to see the item.  
---
Another thing is that a good portion, or used to be good portion, of the population believe in seeding a raid.  If you’re not familiar, the talking point is that drop rates are actually calculated by the leader of a raid or party and the first person to enter three instance.  This generates a loot table for the bosses which can help provide a drop.
---
I personally am up in the air, but always willing to change the seed because what’s the harm.  But, for example, when I was farming black stone ring, we had a seed combination we were confident was going to drop the ring.  In 2/3 of the attempts the ring dropped.  Is this because of seeding, perhaps... is it because of luck, perhaps... with tote further testing I wouldn’t know.
---
Just some thoughts on classic loot tables.
---
I thought no sash yet after 20 runs was a lot.
---
Blame a much more moderated Internet for this. I like to think that it wasn't always like this, and everyone wasn't so quick to tattle on each other.
---
Both Facebook, Twitter, and of course Reddit cracking down on "harassment" and making reports much more accessible.
---
LOL, wha? That's messed.
---
Yeah. Originally I thought the gm just didn't have enough info to prove that op did what he claimed, but in the 2nd message he obviously has access to logs that prove op should be eligible for the quest item. It's bullshit.
---
Cash on delivery, means he doesnt pay until he gets them out of the mail.
---
Nice!
---
STOP BEING BAD.    
---
WINDFURY = MORE HITS    MORE HITS = MORE DAMAGE   MORE DAMAGE FROM MORE HITS = MORE RAGE THAN MORE RAGE FROM SLIGHTLY BIGGER HIT

GIT GUD
---
There isn’t enough quest in ashenvale to get you from 20-25. You either have to grind or quest till the quest are too high then switch to another zone and do quest till they are too high, then go back to ashenvale.
---
As an orc i want to do the opposite. Spooky horses are the best!
---
why is it called Crusader though? Any hints?
---
Has been corrected, thanks :)
---
Hunters can stealth??
---
250g is easier to get than Dal'Rend's unless you're quite lucky. The epic mount is nice but a much better mainhand will help you more.
---
This is the worst way to do loot council.
---
I'm in an LC guild myself. We have a publicly available spreadsheet of planned gear distribution, and if we override that spreadsheet, we talk about it for some time. Leadership goes out of their way to not take gear. Under no circumstances do we chastise people for asking about gear not going to them. I wasn't part of the officer core when I came on, and when they asked me to, I flatly told them the only way I'd allow it is if they never let me influence my own gear distribution. We have dedicated officers for the various main roles who know gearing in and out so they can properly get gear to the people who use it best and/or are most deserving. We quantify guild contributions in and out of raids so that people aren't left wondering how stuff is decided.
---
The only way LC works is if your officers act as fiduciaries. If at any point they're trying to obscure transparency or enrich themselves, get the fuck out. LC is easily the best method of vanilla loot distribution *if* it is handled properly, but it's also very easy to fuck up if any of your loot council gets even slightly power hungry or nepotistic. And it sure as shit is going to get fucked up if the guild leadership just decides, after the guild is already running with roll+1 or some other system, that it's going to be LC. You need to give all of your guildies ample advanced notice of LC rules, or there will be very justifiable resentment on the matter.
---
Perhaps, but in the current situation its extremely ominous of them and to a lot of people it's a huge (communist I guess lol) red flag
---
Seems so everyone is pointing out faults. This is temporary, any tips before the real desk gets made, feel free to shoot!
---
LoL didn’t come out until sometime in Wrath or maybe even Cata iirc
---
Yh Sindra was an awesome boss but terribly plain as a tank. Good thing he wasn't, say, a melee dd
---
Yeah, the additional dmg dealt by tagging ALL the mobs doesn't only make it hard to maintain aggro, it leads to more wipes. You're not clearing dungeons when you're dead and you're probably pissing off the tank. If I was a DoTer I would dot other adds unless 1) situation is under control and 2) the tank has established a good threat lead on the mob (2-3 sunders).
---
This actually made me feel bad for that person cuz it’s obvious he’s emotionally very fragile and maladjusted. Loneliness screws you up man.
---
You can /dance after you cast shoot! Works with wands dunno about other ranges weapons, but it’s awesome!
---
You need to tame another pet that knows that skill, then use that pet with the new skill enough until you see the desired skill in your skill book. Then you should be able to teach it to your old pet.
---
Last night's dungeon:
---
Tank: Sheep marked mob
---
Mage: ok
---
Tank: (pulls)
---
Mage: starts spamming the tank's target, never sheeps the whole battle.
---
Not "somebody broke the sheep", that spell never happened. As melee DPS I was next to all the mobs.
---
Tank dies and needs rez, DPS kitty has to auto-deploy the backup Tank.
---
Start of next fight with no sheep mark: sheep.
---
W.T.H?????
---
Just wait for AV. It’s both cheaper and less time consuming
---
25 or so days played, haven't seen this behavior either.
---
Honestly if you’re bored at 25 you’ll be bored at 60 unless you’re in to this game no amount of extra play will change that.
---
Exposed D:

Deciding which faction and class to make my main and stop switching/making new ones?

And what did you learn today?   Sap first.
---
&gt; recumbent 
---
Where you can recline, not lean forward.
---
I leveled with a buddy, Hunter/ Priest. The quests drops weren't too bad, but definitely more than solo.
---
We've kinda rerolled because my partner decided they wanted to play, too. So now we are doing it all again as a trio. Feels like we have to kill twice as many mobs as before for drops.
---
We don't really mind, what are quests anyway but an excuse to grind with a big XP bonus at the end?
---
We are rolling Warrior/ Pally/ Warlock, so we pretty much just wreck shit 5 mobs at a time and it's not too much slower. Most of our /played is waiting for them to do little things in Stormwind all the time.
---
Very cool! Well done!
---
What's your name on Sulfuras? Theres a 53 warrior orc who has been ganking me every night. :(
---
They got salty about him doing that and then immediately leaving the group
---
I'm curious as well
---
exactly! PvP in this game isn't always about fair even fights, it's about resource control. dungeons, herbs, veins, and a brute showing of force
---
Yeah for example, when I mythic raided we had a spreadsheet that showed mathematically which piece of loot should go to who as part of our overall DPS / HPS. If someone had an issue (which they didn't) it was like...check the maths--his DPS increases by 10%, yours increases by 0.5%
---
Well yeah but the main message of it not being hentai is clear :p
---
&gt; Combat drinking is a well known trick for speed running dungeons, and I use it pretty much every time I'm drinking. You start drinking, the tank pulls the next pack, when he gets low you get up from drinking, cast a gheal, before it puts you in combat you hit your water and start drinking again. With good timing you can get off gheal/renew and go back to drinking.
---
I've never heard of anyone drinking after a pull starts or even being able to honestly. But that's besides the point - if you even *need* to do that, you're wasting a ton of mana and a ton of water. You should not be low enough to need to drink that often, nor should your group be so bad that you're afraid to start a fight without full mana.
---
please
---
Are you stupid or just pretending? The armor pieces are over 100g already lol
---
We are a month and a half into classic and are still in phase 1...at the current pace we are likely to see a new 60 instance/raid about every three months or so I would guess. Many (myself included) would say the game doesn’t start till lvl 60. There is a ton to explore and fun quests to do while lvling but the awesome raids the the sweet loot doesn’t really start till 55+. Id say it’s more than worth it to get to 60. BUT if you enjoy the up close neater style I would not lvl the pally. Paladins late game are almost required to go heals. Unless you’re into PvP then get to 60 and you can do decent in battlegrounds as Ret once phase 3 releases and warsong gultch come out
---
I sarted off as AoE frost, swapped to single target, and then respec'd again back to AoE. AoE is has more utility, and is more interesting to play imo.
---
Because I deleted the other two. I honestly don't know why.
---
I'm sure your revenge will only result in coming here to cry more.
---
Skeram wasn't that great for wPvP either. Once the free transfers came, it got real bad. Glad we moved to Heartseeker before the free transfers ended.
---
rogues have a decided advantage is most 1v1 matchups. you're probably supposed to win if they get the jump on you. 
---
If you're human you have a racial that might help get out of stunlock. Keep PW:S up, and a renew if you're just hanging around. There's also a trinket in Arathi that gives you a 3 second stun - that can come in handy.
---
if that's a joke - i'm not laughing, call me a killjoy.  
---
If you see this in her eyes - that's your...desires :D  
---
I see in her eyes "don't mess with da horde, or ya will be next, mon
---
Literally you did. Sorry you're retarded.
---
Amen
---
I have had many times where the moon is right next to me a few seconds into engagement and not getting sheeped so I think "I guess I should sunder this so I dont lose threat" and the second I hit sunder I hear "baaahh" and I break it.
---
Hurts my heart
---
I can’t comment on other companies, as WoW has been the only game I’ve played for a while.  But I just wouldn’t feel right continuing to support Blizzard after this.
---
I don’t understand why you have to call me ignorant though. I admit, that hurt my feelings. :(
---
Eh, I've been in a successful loot council. We had a spreadsheet that showed which piece would benefit which classes the most. It was like, if you had an issue, you could check the spreadsheet and see 'oh, the mage gains +10% damage from this, I gain 0.5% damage on this, clearly our raid DPS increases the most if he gets it'
---
It became less of a loot council and more of a mathematical formula to work out who gets which piece of gear
---
Yeah I've had a ton of fun so far with playing a paladin, it was tough too because it is my first experience so I had no clue what to roll and all my friends knew exactly what they wanted. Now I am catching up to them while they're at 40+
---
I've been an officer for LC system. Basically anyone who wanted an item whispered what they currently had equipped. Took that + attendance in to mind. Rarely ever had any issues
---
“But it looked different in the AH catalog.”
---
Which was me expressing my opinion that Classic itemization isn’t good. So you called me dumb for my opinion. If you took it literally to think I actually think people are insane you are just special.
---
You the went on to tell me I should be playing retail because I think Classic itemization is bad. Which is insinuating that just because I don’t like something about Classic it means I should be playing retail. Which is why I pointed out class balance and quest design, which by your logic if you think are bad you should be playing retail. 
---
So you seem to be the one having a hard time comprehending what’s being said.
---
I was in your situation a few days/weeks ago. I farmed some fire elementals to get those fire thingies worth 2g each until I had 90. Past 40, all quests will give you a ton of money. I had literally 7 copper when I bought my mount, I never farmed again, and by the point I was 50 I had made around 180 extra gold. I really don't understand how people managed to get 1k gold for their epic mounts just leveling to 60 though.
---
There’s an offhand quest reward in duskwood called the skull of impending doom that gives a 1% chance to inflict shadow dmg on an enemy melee attack. 
---
It gives you 50 armor too.
---
Whenever I grind mobs, people get real defensive when I don’t accept party invites.
---
Only place i know it Ashara.  You have to have max fishing plus Aquadynamic Fish Attractors.
---
Eh, those groups will have trouble filling slots. You should get a group faster by starting it yourself
---
28 seconds, 128 damage.  that is ~4.5 dps.  Is that a not good improvement for like level 35?  What level did you train your newest rank of seal of command?
---
8c
---
The entire point of releasing the honor system before BGs is to encourage world pvp as it existed back then. If they add WSG early you can forget about that entire part of wow's history as all the rankers will spam WSG instead of doing world pvp...
---
Keep in mind that there are a lot of children that play this game
---
yes
---
? 52
---
No, dwarves really are THAT ugly.  No bug.
---
Who even notices buffs have been removed unless you're actively in a party with them?? I just buff and go, ain't nobody got time to see what happens after that.
---
Since it puts out such insane threat
---
Download the TotemTimers Classic Addon! Great visual representation of which totems fall into which element, and it will help you track how long each lasts, so that you know when to drop new ones!
---
I always remove as a tank because i think the damage transfers to the druid that gave me the buff and they start getting aggro... I am wrong about that?  Would thorns damage transfer to me and add to my threat?
---
9c
---
Thanks.
---
Nydris, only level 37 at the moment but feel free to add me if you want! I’ve been spending a lot of time in STV these past few days
---
Ye, that was my previous pseudonym. I changed my main occupation now.
---
What did you hope to gain by photoshopping this?
---
Right. It's just lazy multiboxing to harass players with pvp. They don't represent any significant portion of the population and I'm sure they have trouble doing anything significant.
---
Can confirm. Unless you got friends in high places.
---
Troll is super fun, beast master Hunter has a talent that increases HP regen for you and your pet, stacks w trolls passive regen. Bow +5 helps in end game or fighting mobs higher level then you since its equivalent to 1 level of to hit, meaning you miss less on higher level enemies, meaning you can get an extra 10-20% XP per kill.
---
8c and a /hug
---
Omg your Valeera Sanguinar piece, Kael'thas, all of it *DROOL* You have serious talent!
---
Whoosh
---
Jumped off a cliff into a river a few years ago on a float trip and hit my knee on a hidden rock when I went in and it took MONTHS to get over, was lucky I didn't hit my head
---
I could see it as a "trophy of war" taken from an enemy soldier.
---
In my research, which is not extensive at all, it looks like it very much depends on the green. They need to have desired stats, like intellect for a mage item. I think also look up good items for twinks and then see if your green fits into what a twink would use
---
This is where I farmed so much mageweave for AQ40 event
---
Best way is just to create a spreadsheet of which loot helps who the most. If it improves one class by 1% and another by 12%, then the numbers show who should get it
---
Hell of a mandingo party...
---
What kind of priest? 
---
At 60 this matchup is solidly in favor of priest (for disc or shadow, not sure about holy). Ultimately the rogue just cannot do enough damage to get through shields and heals, and either dies very fast (to shadow) or moderately fast (to disc). 
---
If you're getting jumped without shield up though that's a huge starting disadvantage. Also if your leveling gear has little stamina that is another compounded disadvantage. 
---
So the biggest tips I can give are: keep PWS up all the time and wear gear with more stamina. But personally when leveling I just focus on PvEing as efficiently as possible and if that makes me a free kill to rogues whatever.
---
I think it looks super fun. If I had the means, I'd give it a try.
---
Queues were horrible for everyone else though.
---
Tauren Mill is better.  It's where the moo cows get ground up.
---
Fine add a zero if you're so smart, smart guy
---
yea works fine. when i was still playing retail addons made it super simple as they did all that work for you and you could set custom things for people (BIS/upgrade non BIS/sidegrade/whatever) so you could see how people who wanted things ranked them. would also show current item in that slot
---
That's great. I hope they started circling you, shouting, and spitting!
---
Exactly. I'm also French, play in English and while I get that French people who don't know much English find it easier to play in French, in the long run, they learn to refer to places, abilities, items and quests using the French "translations", most of which aren't direct translations, which makes it hard for everyone else to help them get something done when they need help.
---
* *On t'attend à Stormwind.*

/facepalm.
---
I find that it's pretty hit or miss. Due to the AH deposit, I wouldn't recommend listing them more than 8 hours, and only once - if the auction expires, then just vendor it. (For me, the deposit for 24h ends up sucking up too much of the vendor value to be worth the risk of not selling)
---
Alternatively, get a bank alt to level 5, take up enchanting, and disenchant everything.
---
Then pop blade flurry and finish off their pack for double salt
---
As a tank I would have left the raid (since TF is only tank MS in that type of setting) and ignored the raid leader to avoid them again. Congratulated the rogue and wished him luck on getting the other half and started searching for a guild to raid with instead of being salty about stupid loot rules in a pug (which is to be expected).
---
Yes it is still worth going for hit. It still has a stat value like all other stats. The exactly value of that hit is kinda difficult to calculate, roughly 0.60\*(1+critchance) of a crit. So for 25% crit that would be 1% hit being worth about 0.75% of a crit, but I'd advice to look deeper into proper dps sims.
---
Bestest PvP troll in the server! Killing someone low on mana who is killing a boss require insanely low amount of honor and ethics! Not to mention your need to grab attention from Reddit! You just set the bar for the new low!
---
yeah i guess i couldve just said friend cause u wouldnt know the difference but i did hear it straight from him. I just dont know him that well. I guess i thought that if i just said 'friend' it wouldnt seem likely that me AND someone i know well had the same rare experience. Either way we freaked out when it happened and i guess he did too. When i heard him tell me i started thinking it might be a weird glitch in the loot system, especially when i saw this screencap, which i guess i have now learnt was fake..?
---
"You're just a bad tank, I've run this with tanks that never lose threat when I aoe"
---
It's on a pike near the front entrance of Org.
---
Loot council is helpful if you have officers who have the best interests of the raid in mind (IE, math out which piece of gear should go to who before the raid even starts. If it benefits one class by 10% and another by 1%, its in the raids best interest to give it to the former)
---
Yeah dude, you messed up.  Next time watch them die, then /lol and walk away.  Never help a horde.
---
Yah it sucked but a couple of weeks of pain isn’t worth the rest of classic being on a dead sever. It was a known trade off we all made
---
Dkp works also when everyone is adults. I've been a part of 3 raiding guilds as an officer. One was LC and one was dkp. For the dkp guild we made a rule of "no bitching" because that's the issue with DKP, if someone spends their points, they earned it. Og lot of the time it was idiots not spending points wisely but if they wanted to they could
---
When the 60's show up...
---
https://www.youtube.com/embed/IggD9g5_IXk?start=110&amp;end=148
---
Here is why LC is bad:
---
Loot council puts people in a position where they have the opportunity to benefit themselves and their friends, at the expense of others. This is a tough position for most people, since everyone is greedy. Worse, each person who participates in a raid a bunch of times feels that they deserve that one item. Soon enough, you will hear stuff like, "Organizing all of the Mages is hard work, so Mr. Mage Class Leader deserves something for his trouble." In many cases, people are sincere when they say stuff like that, since they are sincerely trying to convince themselves that they aren't scumbags.
---
With a well-defined system (DKP,MS&gt;OS+1,etc.) it is much harder for someone with authority to cheat the system for their own benefit. People still try though, which causes guilds to fall apart.
---
I post some of my items in singles for 2 reasons.
---
1) same as when I'm the buyer, I dont want to buy a 20 stack when I need 2 of an item.
---
2) I have the auctionator addon, so I have no reason to cry about it.
---
Yes, I'm aware. My point is regarding the thread topic: *future* changes.
---
Glad I'm not on that server that doesn't look fun what so ever
---
I'm at work so I cant really investigate it but highly possibly.
---
More like 3:0, Thunder Bluff has 2 entrances as well.
---
I've been switching it up so much that I'm at 50g respec costs already.
---
The rules are a little bendy since the incidenr. The mods don't want people to feel like they're censoring.
---
I wish they weren't allowed.
---
I guess it’s possible, just extremely time consuming.
---
Only because the honor system isn't in yet.
---
I can definitely understand your point regarding the metrics, and being more easily visible within related addons such as details/recount etc. The opportunity for some of these to be tracked is definitely available within logs, for those that were willing to do a lot of manual data review. 
---
I think for a lot of these scenarios it’s just a lot of effort for not much reward, as not many would care to use the resource even if it was more readily available. For instance there are plenty of options within details to look at different statistics throughout a fight, but how many truly use more than just DPS meter? I’d wager the majority of players almost never check HPS or even dispels.
---
I think asking for things like better utility in the sense of scaling isn’t a bad thing, but we are also talking about a 15+ year old game. If the topic was about retail I think it would be a lot more appropriate. This doesn’t mean discussion shouldn’t happen if/when classic+ happens. But I think we can agree there likely won’t be any major balance changes or reworks before that becomes more realistic.
---
Ultimately I think a lot of this stuff more unfortunately boils down to buffs like leader of the pack or windfury totem being party based. You just simply don’t have enough slots to bring everything when a set few buffs are by and large the most important. Things like debuff/buff cap, with things like hots not stacking. The game simply was not designed for something like utility based classes to really shine and stand on their own. Also to mention my previous comment, that most hybrid specs are just not fully fledged and as a result those classes almost always end up healing or in an identity crisis.
---
I joined a group at one point that asked if I could OS DPS for some 2-3 boss BRD runs on my Druid (on 21/0/30). Even with a decent nearly full set of spellpower gear that had me around 150 spell power, I could barely out DPS the tank in most encounters. And generally would oom before trash packs were fully killed, regardless of what combination of offensive spells I was using. At some point you have to realize, in a PvE setting just how much the lack of damage affects these incomplete specs from being considered “viable”.
---
What zone are you talking about specifically?
---
Also yeah I feel you. But to be fair I put it all on myself by picking tail/ench professions too haha
---
Warlock is smart class and Hunter is stupid. You decide.
---
Man it's like 2005 all over again. Good times, good times. Classic giving that legit 12 year olds playing WoW experience.
---
You would be better off using these two weapons:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22816/hatchet-of-sundered-bone](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22816/hatchet-of-sundered-bone) 
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22802/kingsfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22802/kingsfall) 
---
Which give 2% crit, 1% hit, and additional attack power and agility.
---
The OranThul
---
Well at SM you’re on our home turf. So expect to die
---
If getting rekt is getting 1 shot then I definately got rekt. Alot.
---
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Attack Power increases your base melee damage-per-second (DPS) by 1 point for every 14 Attack Power.
---
Executioner's Cleaver:  
---
23 Strength = 46 AP.  
---
46 / 14 = 3.286 extra weapon DPS.  
---
41.8 + 3.286 = 45.086 DPS.  
---
45.086 DPS * 3.8 speed = 171.327 average weapon damage.
---
Kang the Decapitator:   
---
(136 + 205) / 2 = 170.5 average weapon damage.
---
So I'm pretty sure the Cleaver will actually hit (slightly) harder on average than Kang. Kang does more DPS though (45.1 vs. 47.4).  
---
I don't know how often Kang procs, but I don't think most mobs will last anywhere close to 30 seconds when you use such a weapon, so I think that chance on hit bonus won't be that good. The 1% hit of the Cleaver on the other hand is very useful.
---
I'd go for the Cleaver based on that information, assuming it is correct. On top of that the fact that Kang is more expensive, it'd be an easy choice for me.
---
A very SAd moment.
---
I'd play Night Elf Feral Druid, it sounds like it offers everything you like.
---
Either that, or you make 2 characters, one Night Elf Warrior and one Undead Rogue, on two different servers, unless you play on a PvE server.
---
I have met my counterpart https://imgur.com/gallery/cJDK8io

ugh, the worst kind of shrimp. I prefer mine with some butter, lemon, and garlic.
---
PSA: there has been a humor tag on these posts the entire time. Please spread the word that this was a HUMOR post
---
&gt;Again, what was stopping either of the other two warriors from tanking the instance?
---
Being bad at the game apparently.
---
To something that has 5x a normal healthpool. Factor in the 4 GCDs you have to blow through to get those DoTs up and you're doing *less* damage on average.
---
Even if he didn’t deserve to die at this moment, he’d deserve it later on. That’s just balance, you should understand that, especially as a Druid!
---
I wrote this whole long post and chrome crashed. : (
---
So this is the short version
---
Spirit Tap -&gt; Wand - &gt; Reduced smite/heal cast time -&gt; go back to disc tree to meditation and inner focus -&gt; then after that is whatever you want.
---
Inspiration I dont think you need until raiding.
---
Holy Nova isn't a great damage or healing spell (I used it to destealth rogues in PvP)
---
I like Martydom for the focused casting for when you are soloing.
---
Meditation will help with healing dungeons and really that's all you need and can put points in anything else you like.
---
I'm on a PvP server, so I NEED mindflay because if a rogue kicks my holy tree I would be tweedling my thumbs until MB comes off cooldown.
---
(I hate that I wrote this long thing, but lost it, I did level as holy in vanilla, which is why I didn't do it this time around. lol.)
---
I think you're playing the game exactly the way it's meant to be played. You're taking your time and doing what you like to do. I'd say it IS slower than average, but that's because a lot of people are actively trying to skip the game with dungeon aoe speedruns. Those guys aren't having nearly as much fun as you are and will be the first to quit. Keep your pace and enjoy your time :D
---
Tauren hunter
---
how can you waste a character slot? is there a limited amount or something? you cant have 1 of each class?
---
Unfortunately stonetalon for alliance is just an unfinished quest hub :(
---
I'm starting to think that comments like yours are the real copy pasta. Everyone I know who's currently playing classic or was has had something like this happen. Just because youve gotten lucky immediately makes everyone else a liar and their posts fake? Omg it can't be possible, a bad experience in classic! IMPOSSIBLE
---
Yes, that’s exactly what he said. Not everyone aims to min/Max their gear.
---
What is going on here?
---
Strengthen your faith in the light! SoC is all about believing 😎
---
This guy doesn't rogue.
---
This. Savage Strikes + Lok = 800-1200 damage crits on cloth constantly. It's so much fun and I don't care about PvE tryharding.
---
Plus crit, stam, and int are perfect stats for PvP.
---
Realky Like your interface, can you name addons used please?
---
Fair enough. Expect the same on our turf.
---
Just looking for a reason to complain probably
---
As a tank, every time a sheep pops it starts going for the healer. My one melee hit to sunder and get agro is always a 100% chance to crit.

78 is solidly Gen X, millennials are at least 85 if not 90 or later

Honestly I'm the same. I'm probably wrong a lot of times but the way someone communicates or types a lot of times will lead me to believe they're male/female.
---
Download questie then look at your world map to see available relevant quest
---
Thorium is very heavily farmed and nearly impossible to find in any quantity. No matter the zone, you do a full pass and find one small thorium vein in 20 minutes. It's rough out there!
---
I did, do it before you hit lvl 60 once you hit 60 it greatly diminishes.
---
Nah nah your thinking of Pespora
---
No way. 
---
There are less than 60 zones in classic so each participant can be designated 2 zones to scan over 24 hours. On normal speed mount they can probably look in every crevice of those two zones in 2-3 hours. So to make this challange realistic you would need to reduce number from 30 to 10.
---
magetards kek
---
Horde here. I'm alternating between a 30 rogue and 33 hunter right now, playing one for a couple days while the other earns rested, then switching. 
---
Currently the rogue is on Kalimdor (1k needles), while the Hunter is in EK (Arathi). I'm considering keeping them on separate continents, so I'm not just constantly repeating the same zones and same quests. 
---
I've heard that Kalimdor is more grindy in the later levels, while EK is more focused on quests. Is that true, and if so, would I be better flip-flopping their locations? Seems like the hunter would be better suited for faster grinding.
---
Unless i've been wrong since TBC it gives threat to whoever procs it, same as fire shield from warlocks. So if you're tanking keep it on, if not remove it since the last thing you want is additional threat if the mobs are already pummeling you.
---
There are items, like the Truefaith vestments, that don't directly require you to have the profession in order to be worn, but since it's bound on pickup, you need to craft it yourself (with the profession) if you want it.
---
Install DBM

Often, because people know how to DPS Now, it will be impossible to keep agroo on the main Target let alone on 3+.
---
I will pull, sunder/revenge the other targets than the one I mark for the kill, then taunt and burst agroo skull. If it looks like I can keep that targets agroo until it does I start cycling through the other targets again. If there are 5+ targets start off with Demo Shout and sunder the Elites.
---
Basically, because taunt give you the agroo of the highest threat target, you can use them to help you get agroo. Healer will have to heal them but they should be fine. 
---
Only way to prevent this is to make DPS wait for 2 sunders but that isn't worth the time to be honest. I would always concentrate on tanking everything else.
---
As a druid I actually never thought of this side effect...
---
Martyrdom is amazing? It procs all the time for me.
---
You have fishing. Farm nightfin snapper.
---
What an awful thing to do
---
well it doesnt say you have it, and you're not allowed to go in instances
---
bro do you mind if i shake you over my fries, they need a little more salt
---
I think to most rogues, hunters mark is starting something!
---
Spoken like a true alt leveler. Commit to leveling your Paladin for about 5hrs straight and then you will see how those 70-80% actualy becomes like 30-40% but feels like 10-20%.
---
I play a dps warrior, I really enjoy it. Every group I join I get asked to play tank even after saying I want to dps. I reluctantly agree to speed things up. I'm level 60, out of all the 100s of dungeon runs I've done, roughly 20 I've been able to play dps. 20.
---
What makes it worse is that dps still at 60, still don't know to give me a few seconds to generate some rage and get some agro. It sucks.
---
I am sick and tired of playing a character I want to play only to be told by arseholes like you I should play it different so you can play what you want to play quicker.
---
Edit: spelling and grammar
---
Deviate delight? tell your guild to stfu with the spamming
---
&gt; If they don't need five shamans to kill me then why are they using five shamans to do it?

Because it's fucking hilarious, duh?

You say multiboxing is pay to win but admit you can easily beat multiboxers.

MFW
---
Yeah the sustain is crazy but the overall speed you work with in solo content is rather slow. Even most classes can kill a mob faster or can take on more of them at a time.

Truer words have never been spoken, friend

The advantage is that is scales with melee stats and can crit. SoR requires spell damage. If your gear sucks yeah it's probably gonna be pretty lackluster.
---
It procced enough for me but I rarely felt that I really needed it.
---
Don't waste too much mana on warlocks, they eat their own hp and convert it to mana and expect you to heal them, so they're basically trying to drain your mana pool instead of drinking like you do.
---
how pleasant
---
Welcome to the World of Commodity-craft!
---
Thanks, thats how I approach it as well.  I was just curious if that was the general consensus and I imagine it is.
---
I had a dude in barrens steal Echyakee or however you spell it, that white lion you summon by the bones.  I even asked before hand if they could not kill it bc I’m trying to tame and they said do it some other time. I guess it was my mistake for not hitting the mob at least once and the dude just took it and laughed at me. Couldn’t use the horn to summon unless I picked the quest up again. We called him an asshole immediately. My friend blocked him bc he was harassing my friend in whisper. Then he found my name and started whispering me saying he doesn’t feel guilty at all and I was like good for you?
---
You should be sorry!
---
Can comfirm.
---
~Dontseeme - Benediction
---
Feel your pain dude. I'm now 58 and I'm getting other gear to supplement things but that damn HoJ is still a better tank trinket then FoW is. That hit is soooo needed.
---
You can turn that on with the default ui

---
I was selling some ore I'd found in trade chat a few weeks back. This guy messaged me, but I'd been seeing around that he was a notorious ninja asshole and I ignored him.
---
He tried to call me out in trade chat about it, so I told him, "Dude, shut the hell up. I'm not selling you shit because of your reputation."
---
Turns out the guy was a multiboxer. He took all six of his accounts, reported me on each of them that I was spamming in chat and I got a 48-hur silence.
---
The worst part was he bragged about it in chat. I took a screenshot of it, sent it to Blizzard when I tried to appeal, but because nobody takes a look at shit anymore, I got a blanket "don't try to escalate or the penalty will be increased" response.
---
I just finished these up last night, grouping with a random mage that had just picked them up as well.   We started towards the southern end near the entrance to Tanaris and made our way around counter-clockwise, just clearing mobs and moving on.  We were on our 2nd lap before I realized that this must have been blizz's intention with the entire quest hub.  Players running laps around the flats, just like the track in the middle.
---
10
---
This is blasphemy!
---
lol you're the ones bitching about someone controlling 5 players.
---
Keep healing set and rest set respec at 60 or sooner if you feel like it. Killing stuff solo as holy sucks.
---
I'm Horde on Earthfury, pop seems pretty even. I have had good pvp interactions thru my leveling, horde side AH is pretty stable with about 5 large guilds on the horde side. With the lower pop, guilds become a lot more important in tackling the content, all of my dungeon runs have been min 3 more guildies in my group. (I'm a member of &lt;Scorn&gt;) Hope to see you in Azeroth!
---
Weeper, Troll Hunter
---
Soooo OP, can you comment on the irony of your poor Photoshop attempt at farming reddit karma ending up doing the exact opposite instead?
---
Yeet. I mean yes.
---
You don't see threads like this because of rule 5. No politics, just that one huge thread yesterday.
---
I'm addicted to Classic WoW and will keep playing regardless.
---
I am sheep lord
---
lmfao i laughed like a hyena to this
---
thanks, now they're just right
---
what ... Stormwind is actually called hurle-vent .... what the actual f..
---
I am a horde rogue in sulfuras.
---
Wasnt me though, I'm long gone from stv.
---
I saw a hunter questing the sasquatch things in that place west of gsdgetzan (forget the name). I would occasionally sneak up and hit him super hard as I am sub spec and wear him down. Then I would back off. Didnt ever kill him and helped him take out a few packs after he tagged.
---
It's all about dominance really.
---
If you AFK outside of a town in PVP land, then you deserve to come back in the spirit world.
---
Follow the advice from Iarehealer until ur 40 than respec to shadow priest. 
---
This is what I’m doing anyways.
---
As a tank, I've always thought of it. And Fire Shield. And Retribution Aura. If I had a choice between Ret Aura and Dev Aura in an AOE heavy dungeon it'd be ret aura all they way.
---
I’m in the same boat. If I go edgemasters I gotta replace my leggings and I sure don’t have the gold to get cloudkeepers.
---
That is literally the ultimate level of rekt.
---
Lol only advice I have for you is to have your group meet up outside the castle to the side then run in straight to your entrance as a team.  That way only 1-2 will get picked off and you can summon once you get inside.  It's unlikely all of you will be targetted at once.
---
And if you have a priest get them to fire their AOE fear as you get to the main room where the doors are at.
---
Also keep a couple greater healing potions on you.  It might be enough health to get you to the dungeon.
---
You also have a fear but at level 30 it's unlikely you will get to cast it before being killed.
---
Oh no, they managed to counter one strategy for killing multiboxers what has the world come to.  Guess you'll have to walk in the other direction huh?
---
Whine more.
---
My sheeps are always broken by hunters or the tanks. Which I don't mind much, but don't expect me to keep spamming sheep after a couple times.
---
Sorry  :(
---
It already is. I should've seen this coming on the Tuesday announce.
---
Price on my server is going up 10g/day
---
Questing helps create direction and flow, but grinding is solid exp if you can find a nice spot for it for your level.

+Dodge to cloak as well I believe
---
Yeah, that’s their genius plan because obviously the people who only subbed to play classic would just hop over into retail and be fine with it. That’s really the “greedy” option.
---
If you actually used critical thinking skills, you’d know that makes zero sense.
---
this is so true, when you get a whisper in the middle of whispering people is guaranteed to make you respond to the wrong person
---
you're welcome
---
Heh, funny. I just posted a thread a few hours ago with very nearly this same build. Although in my case, I was inquiring about the order of talents to take each level.
---
Orange quests are only doable if you are in a group, patient, or well geared.  If you are in a rush, in a heavy PvP zone, or in greens from 10 levels ago, don't try it.  You'll die quickly and often.
---
Virtue signaling addiction much?
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I'd be really surprised if that was the first kill on Ony though. Get geared up and the game is easy. Get organized and the game is easy. 
---
I think this really just comes down to me currently playing a different game. I'm not in a raiding guild, I've had to pug most everything and when you are dealing with randoms on the internet CC can really help.
---
Edit: As for the M+, I only played it in legion and I must have been doing it wrong. Everyone was obsessed with three chesting everyting and if you didn't they got pissed off. I had some seriously negative experiences with it and  I guess that turned me off enough that I never got to a point where cc was needed.
---
I actually got lvl 40 blue BOE leather shoulders from a chest yesterday in STV
---
I find healing really fun at least from a minmaxing point of view. Picking which seal to use, when to judge, assessing when can you burn mana to consecrate/holy shock, picking when to use divine favor as a mana saver and when to use it as a burst CD. Dealing with bother healer and melee mechanics.
---
 I imagain in raids they're much more dull tbh.
---
DKP wastes time. If loot is preassigned you keep going while one dude stays back and distributes loot.
---
The horde on Deviate Delight are typically outnumbered. They usually show up mid-day and just camp Nesingwary's camp until Alliance folk start logging on. Then, no where to be found.
---
because they lack social interactions
---
Also the entire zone is a reference to Land of the Lost
---
I only got my paladin to 25 before I gave up on her due to how bad SoC was. Everyone I talked to was telling me it'd get so much better when I got that talent that when I got it I just chose a different class after seeing how underwhelming it was. Even dedicated a Saturday night getting verigan's fist at 20. 
---
To add insult to injury is when SoC activates and gets parried, dodged or you just miss.
---
Trade is in /2
---
I actually found someone who endorses such a build!
---
I respect your optimism, but I don't respect your tone.
---
Appreciate the response.  Us Hybrids COULD roll on damn near any piece that drops, which is why I get frustrated in situations like this.
---
It is. Keep it.
---
Because it's a stupid question.
---
Being able to cast five spells for your one doesn't make them five times stronger.
---
Every advantage they get added together is less than all the disadvantages they have.
---
You don't win an argument by comparing your weakness to their strength and saying they are OP pay to win.
---
You admit they aren't pay to win because there are many ways to deal with them.
---
It's usually not a full pug.  It's usually a "mount run" group that is pugging the warlock who has the mats.  If it was truly a pug group, it's going to be hard to convince the tank and healer that they should help out with this difficult encounter for absolutely no reward for them.
---
I'm not a warrior so I'm not sure on specifics but every warrior or dps class I know would kill for an ironfoe
---
Do you play on a shitty server? I've never had this happen to me ever. and I pretty much haven't gone a day without playing. Are you sure you aren't maybe breaking an ettiquette rule? You didn't ninja a node someone was fighting next to or anything
---
That's cool and all, but others don't have to do this, and most likely won't do this.
---
You have to have extreme patience to use stealth. It's slow as molasses.
---
Look on the bright side, at least you chose the correct race for quick corpse runs!
---
Also if he really was afk, chances are he missed the part where you pulled the mobs off him.
---
I was one shitting on you 😂.
---
But yes, AFAIK you can 100% summon inside of instances.  My warlock is only level 23 but can summon to instances.
---
Ive also helped warlocks summon others in a variety of instances.  So you should be set.
---
I started with a hunter so I did them time to time, but he really it just isn't worth it. I zone hop now, a lot.
---
Yes you would only need 1% from gear, but having more hit than the minimum isn't bad. Since most of your dps is white hits
---
Clearly I had a r/woosh moment and I still don't get what I did wrong. I'll just leave it up.
---
No problem! Good luck.
---
No other guilds I could raid with on the server.
---
I don’t really care if you respect my tone. It’s just an absurd theory fueled by nothing but “blizz bad.”
---
Oh Snap!
---
You could use this to merk the annoying 1 copper AH bots... you could be the hero classic needs.
---
I'm in a similar situation.  My highest is a 25 shaman.  My issue has been more server/friends related than anything.  Some didn't want to be on a PvP realm so we rolled PvE, but then a bunch stopped playing and others went to PvP. So I moved to another PvE server with a buddy who was playing with others but then he was more interested in retail. I rolled new toons on a PvP server where some other guildies went to play with a different guild.  Then they stopped logging on and the server was super unbalanced.  Now I have decided to just pick my own server and do my own thing, while trying to make new connections instead of relying on old ones.  I'm up to lvl 12.
---
How can you tel if a sever is layered or not?
---
Hillsbrad feeds into Arathi Highlands and Alterac Mountains.  I was able to go from 20 to 30 through those areas with a helping of a few dungeons.  Just know when Phase 2 hits, Hillsbrad will be a slaughterhouse.  So, I'd suggest that you and your friends be done with the main quests in Hillsbrad before December.
---
That's actually kinda brilliant thinking using dreamist to blow their cd's never thought of that.
---
I'd say more than 50% of guilds find a way to funnel wealth and materials and drops from members to officers and the GM.  You see this in a variety of ways - from designating inner circle folks as guild crafters and funneling them all the cool mats and recipes, to rewarding effort points for contributing gold to the guild, to allowing officers to play offspec / nonmeta characters but not regular raiders, etc.
---
At the end of the day, there is messaging around - trust us, we'll eventually disenchant stuff so you will get it before that happens (unless, of course, they decide they need the disenchant mats then you are SOL).
---
I call these guilds pyramid schemes and folks who show up to raid are generally at the bottom.
---
Loot council is the best system for groups that value group progression over personal progression, however there is two big "but's"
---
* Some people value personal progression. And there is nothing wrong with it as long as everyone agrees. You can still progress as a group even of everyone values personal progression
---
* It is really easy to abuse. If there is no clear explanation why this piece gives the most upgrade when given to this person, it is a red flag. And no, "he helped more" is not an explanation because it doesn't explain benefits to the group. (However, "we are sure he will not leave the group" may be a reason)
---
I had a great-uncle who was pretty much a vegetable after hitting his head diving. Always check the depth, kids!
---
I mean loot council is conducted that way but most loot council's are shite or a friend grp
---
Loot council is the best option when the loot council is good (rare) and the entire raid is willing to go with LC (also rare)
---
Right now, because of the ease of content and how little gear is really needed to clear 11/11 , it should be dkp bids for MC imo. It's the most fair currently and since the gear isn't crucial to the success of the raid team (besides a few MT pieces) loot council just isn't required until BWL or even AQ for a guild to shine
---
If my guild doesn't swap LC and show they can run it properly by AQ I might also be finding a new home, but I hope that isn't the case I love a lot of these guys and I already got my mageblade so j don't wanna be that guy that gets his BiS and dips but I also already did my progression on ND, I don't wanna deal with a guild failing to adapt for simple vanilla raids
---
Re-posting one of my older comments where I typed out a bunch of different BRD run types. Note that all of these runs are extremely flexible, it's a huge dungeon, once you know the layout you'll start to understand better what bosses can be easily added/dropped from certain runs, and which classes want which bosses for BiS farming.
---
The main runs are:
---
Arena/Prison
---
Emperor Runs
---
Lava Runs
---
~~Torch Farm~~
---
Quest Runs
---
Attunement Runs
---
Full Runs
---
Arena/prison is very doable at level 54, or even lower. Level 50's could probably get through it alright. It consists of Interrogator Gershtan and the ring of law, and occasionally Roccor. This is the most common run, usually just arena, but people will often roll in Angerforge since he's easy to get to and needs to be spammed endlessly for Hand of Justice. You'll usually see either Arena+prison (interrogator, arena, roccor) or Arena+Angerforge; people don't usually do both; and when a group is doing it once they're usually farming it for multiple runs. This is a BiS spam run, and not great XP/hr.
---
Emperor is close to a full run, skipping the chaff. You skip past prison, possibly doing arena, and using the shadowforge key to start at general angerforge. From there, you go through golemn lord arglemach, grim guzzler, flamelash, tomb of the seven, lycaneum, magmus, and emperor. The big reason for this run is that it hits the biggest BiS bosses: angerforge, golem lord, tomb of the seven, and emperor having quite a few really good drops. Doable at 55, earlier if you can get some higher leveled support/have a good group. Emperor is the one who really sets the level requirement, the rest of the bosses are doable at a lower level.
---
Lava run is a shortened version of emperor, cutting out everything up to flamelash but adding in incendius. It involves dropping into the lava and swimming up to tomb of the seven, and doing the rest from there. It is the fastest way to get to emperor if he's the one you really want to farm. This is often done by people close to 60, as they are just rushing for drops; it isn't particularly good XP since so much time is wasted with all the jumping/lava/skipped packs.
---
~~Torch runs are for very heavy AoE spellcleave comps. Run through the lyceum where the normal mobs respawn every 20 seconds, and just pull/LoS massive packs and AoE them down. Lots of XP/hr, but not great loot.~~ This was removed by a nerf to torch run XP, people don't do this anymore.
---
Quest runs complete all the quests, and are usually pretty close to full clears, or potentially more given that there's other non-boss things that need to be done. The biggest quest line people want to finish in BRD is the "Saving the Princess?" chain, which allows you to loot the princess in future runs. She drops several pieces of BiS, so you want to complete this ASAP. This may involve hearthing out to your capital to turn in, and running/being summoned back. This run is also the main run that clears the right side of the dungeon; including the coffers/vault for heart of the mountain, golems for rise of the machines, and the two bosses for the shadowforge key. I believe the alliance Ony attunement chain sends you to BRD, but honestly I'm not 100% as I play horde.
---
Attunement runs can really fall under lava, emp, quest or full runs; it just means "we're clearing the two packs of fire elementals before the lyceum so we can do the MC attunement quest". Any run going towards emp can get the MC attunement as well.
---
Full runs clear everything, or near everything. These are solid for groups that have a variety of needs, or want to just farm XP/BoE drops. Biggest reason IMO that people do this, is that they want offbeat boss drops and/or would rather stick with a group through sub-optimal content than have to find another group since that can take forever.
---
Schedule reasons? I would rather just try to PuG than put up with that nonsense.
---
That's actually really decent gph. 
---
I'm sure a lot of it depends on the route i take. I'll have to try to figure out the most efficient route.
---
It’s bis until phase 3, so it’s definitely worth the farm, especially considering everyone and their mother is doing jed/rend runs right now which take ~25 minutes each.
---
**How do you go about rolling for BoE Blues that drop in a PUG dungeon group?**  
---
I've gotten into groups and there doesn't seem to be any sorta of 'general consensus' outside of, NEEDing + leaving = cancer.
---
a) NEED because it's gold on the AH and it's still 'early' so everybody still needs gold
---
b) NEED only if you're on the character that would immediately be using it
---
c) Advise the group that, if nobody on those toons NEEDS it, you have an alt that would use it right away and NEED it
---
d) Entire group GREEDS; regardless of who can use it and cannot use it -- i.e - everybody should have a chance at winning it
---
e) PASS unless your character can use it in which case, NEED.
---
Or golem if you are a healer
---
Yeah, not really a lot you can say. 
---
Two things I would do: Not run with him any more (which hurts you more than him, but that's your only recourse) and also take note of what guild he's in. Second time you have a problem with someone from the same guild, I would stop running with the entire guild. No need to really shame either one unless you're running with guildies and don't want the headache of that person or that guild, but I always take note of this kind of behavior and remember it.
---
I thought people wanted this mod to be banned?
---
Some people seem to think we healers have infinite mana.
---
I wish.
---
Now for the real question.
---
What happens when you are now in a full guild raid and it's established that TF is going to the MT.
---
The other binding drops that you don't have yet and the MT doesn't have either binding.
---
Do you let him get that binding that you don't have in an effort to ensure the MT gets an early TF. In case that binding doesn't drop again for months. Or do you take it, having the other binding already. But than  the MT will have to wait on both drops?
---
Yeah this is what I did. I played the bag/tailoring market early, but now that people are pretty well stocked on bags I've swapped to alchemy/herb. I spend my weekend days when I'm not busy doing other stuff farming herbs. Then Monday night and Tuesday night I post elixirs up before I go to work and most if not all are sold when I get home.
---
Doing this got me my mount, my epic mount, and a solid nest egg. All of this while spending a dumb amount of money on BoEs for alts and respeccing because I like trying different specs out
---
Grats on the kill! Hoping to get him down this week since we finally have enough people to douse the runes. 
---
Could you give me a rundown of the addons you're using? I am digging the simplistic style. Thanks!
---
Have you always played as a pally? I’ve tried mage, warrior, and Druid and so far paladin has been the most fun at least for me but I can’t say longevity terms because I’m not a high level at all. Warrior has to be my second favorite.
---
How long do strat live runs take?
---
I also have the same issue but with Rogue stealth. I have to click the "buff" icon like you did here to take it off. Keybinding and clicking on the Action icon doesn't work. I can also attack something to get out but it's annoying not being able to just hit my keybinding.
---
Sort of Holy/Smite im liking the burst damage + being really useful for healing in 5 mans. I prefer it over shadow.  But ya i didnt get my shield up i dont think.
---
Hope his wife is doing fine...
---
I know it's good, but is Ironfoe + Mirah's song better than Axe of the deep woods and flurry axe? 
---
I imagine the +5 racial makes a big difference, but I don't know if Ironfoe combo will do more damage even without racial.
---
Please fix your minimap icons, my eyes are bleeding
---
Like /u/kaydenkross said: it's a mount run.  You aren't typically getting a tank, healer, and third DPS as a complete pug.  You are a mount group pugging the warlock with the mats to summon the mount.
---
The encounter is not easy, especially with the gear most people have when trying to get it. Convincing a random tank, healer, and DPS that they should do this encounter for literally no reward other than "the warlock gets a mount" is going to be a stretch.
---
And if the price is too high for your group, then spend the 250 for your own mats, or find another warlock. But I rarely had people decline the offer.
---
It was one of the best gaming moments I have ever experienced. Made getting the Carrot trinket that much sweeter!
---
Glad you enjoyed reading.
---
To be fair, a lot of us have these goals from vanilla. I want Benediction and I wanted it back in vanilla. So if I get it, it will feel like fulfilling a dream from my high school days, not a dream from 6-7 weeks ago.
---
Retail is calling you my dude
---
Yeah I had already edited my comment to reflect that.
---
Since no one added this - at 20 you have access to complete the fire and water totem quests (air is 30). The fire totem quest is ok but water totem quest is a pain cause you go back and forth over and over to a bunch of zones.
---
Call of elements is the quest chain if you need assistance, you can look it up
---
Questing in Barrens, I see.
---
I didnt say they have to? I just said it annoys me lol
---
I'm still having a blast so far. How long will it last? 
---
I don't know, I figure I'll make end game at least.
---
3 30's  (I do have a alt problem)
---
Holy Specialization, Divine Fury, Improved Healing, and Spiritual Guidance all buff healing. It just so happens that three of those ALSO buff damage.
---
That's the beauty of the Holy tree. Talents often buff both.
---
I don't get it. One person is normal and kind and you post it? This is not the norm! Every time I play I see the most vitriolic disgusting conversations. What you posted is not a typical experience.
---
My goal was to have 1000 devilsaur on hand before I started moving it, and I'd argue once single layer hits we'll see a bit of a spike.
---
Depends how far you're tapping. I'm not the person you responded to but typically I tap to just around half, which means while I'm doing damage my demon armor is healing me up anyway. I only really use life drain when questing or if I've somehow pulled aggro and need to try to survive.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7465/knights-crest#same-model-as
---
This same thing can be done to farm Incendius in BRD for that sweet pre raid BiS wrists.
---
I fish mine and run a lot of dungeons, with disenchant. Sometimes ask for greens, depends.
---
It's long but doable (prot).
---
I'm generally a very nice priest. I mind control horde to give them fortitude, I dot their mobs, but rogues. I will always jump a rogue. If I see you you're not doing your job as a rogue anyways.
---
FYI,  Lúthien is spelled with special characters. They're just in the wrong place.
---
Classic at its best and hopefully less salty tears from people who take themselves far too seriously!
---
So this is why Elixir of Shadow Power shot up to 12g each -.-
---
How does personal loot from trash mob work in instances? Not specific rolls for items I mean every little trash mob.
---
I see in the chat “your share of ___ money” is split but what about mats like cloth and what not? Sometimes I can loot a body and a lot of times not. 
---
Is it first come first serve?
---
4 level is not enough of a difference to justify what you did.
---
I figured it out. I was just pointing out why somebody else questioned it.
---
I’m pretty sure they enjoy your compliment though, jackass
---
I only ever report the gold spammer chat invites.
---
How do you know he isn’t a DPS that is just gearing himself in prot spec?
---
I don't see how quitting WoW is a huge deal. Sorry.
---
&gt;  It's an instant speed cast, so it takes zero extra time for the 5SR 
---
You need to wait for the GCD to finish before the 5sr kicks in after instant cast skills.
---
&gt;In raids, you spam your max rank heal
---
No way lol. I rarely use max Rank of either Greater Heal or Heal. It's just totally unnecessary. In raids what I use most often is Rank 2 Heal because people just aren't taking enough damage to need more. I have rank 1 and 4 of GH as well when it's needed but it's certainly not what I spam. I'm not sure what sort of raid groups you are playing in, but ours have an abundance of healers and only a few fights where the raid is taking consistent high damage to warrant big heals (and those fights are often quite short). Have you hit 60 yet? I've been raiding for 3 weeks and it's not hard. It's not Vanilla and it's not PServers. 
---
&gt;mana spring totems
---
Ok you're a Horde. I guess you guys play differently due to different class options. With 7-8 Pallies, 2-3 Priests, and 1 Resto Druid, we play a bit differently.
---
&gt; On top of that, to heal like raid healing, you need to have a huge amount of +healing and in-combat mana recovery like MP5, mana spring totems, innervate, meditation, healing pots, runes, etc.
---
As I've said I use Heal and Greater Heal primarly, our most efficienct heals. But also fights are super short, as in 2 minutes max. I'll be honest in that my spell usage is more conservative than most. A ton of 60 Priests just say fuck it and spam Flash Heal *because they can*. It's not efficient but they don't care because with easy, short fights outside of a handful of fights, it just doesn't matter. Especially with 8 HPals topping people off everywhere and still having mana to spare, we're not exactly stressed.
---
You lose your character because of the hack/exploit you implemented to get 52 talent points.
---
If you're one shotting every boss, and your GM doesn't care, then do whatever you want.
---
Some people don't realize you need the horn to summon him. I joined up with a guy who said he was killing mobs there for 15 minutes and it still hadn't spawned. I wonder if that has something to do with it
---
Also if you're friend was there couldn't you just use his horn or was he trying to tame it too? You definitely should have tagged it though, people can't be trusted. Your friend could've kited him until you were ready or something
---
Roll a lvl 5 alt. Get them enchanting, disenchant everything. Sell enchanting mats.
---
I only sell green weapons rn.
---
They said they ducked their heads to show they weren't involved in what he was saying.
---
I'll post a video later tonight when I am back home
---
How do you have to drink every 2-3 mobs while questing as a priest?
---
Filtering out identities in these videos is lame af.   Show us who drew blood or don’t show at all.
---
do not judge tanking with DM or WC, those are very difficult instance for warrior at that level.
---
Is hamstring kiting even a thing in classic? there’s so much leeway i don’t think it does.
---
They aren't though.  They are incredibly gimped in PvP except for morons like you who let them roll up on you.  If they were OP in PvP they would be the meta.
---
I love this game for the social situations it creates
---
How can someone this stupid have so much disposable income?
---
Yeah I have my fire totem already but going enhancement I’ve most done strength and stoneskin totems
---
Do it, it's not hard at all. Make sure you're around other players, close and open your inventory a couple times, move items around in your bag, put them in your bank, etc. If what you say is true, it's not hard to prove.
---
Okay so I'm not alone here. It sucks I opened a ticket up and the gms just blamed my internet which is running everything else flawless and has 400 down speeed
---
Should I be doing 24 hour auctions, or is this generally a bad idea?
---
Dont encourage human warriors, unless asked about absolute min-max. Human warriors are disgusting
---
Yup a rogue will always wait for you to trust them, then backstab you at any possible time.
---
Curious how this changes when Dire Maul comes out
---
there would be no reason for you to roll on it anyway, it's BOP :P
---
you mean like when we are coming to a gnoll camp to complete a quest?  But can't since every single mob is dead and we can't tag a single one since they all get tagged as soon as they respawn by a blizzard cast?
---
That horrendously rude act by us is 'askin for it'?
---
This is great because most gank topics are about bragging about a kill. Or killing an enemy despite the odds stacked against you.
---
I mean, that's like a 5% chance. Very unlucky for sure, but astronomically is a little dramatic.
---
Pretty sure this was staged.
---
15 min.  IF NO ONE is holding the vendor open...so with campers, it can really be forever.
---
We are 4/4 on bene, not a single leaf yet.
---
Mark targets, I bind the marks to the numbers on my num pad.
---
I was in your exact position. Everyone recommends the elementals in the Badlands, but they're immune to bleeds, so that's no fun as a Deep Wounds spec'd boi. Also their armor is kind of high.  
---
I ended up running Shadowfang Keep. Each run took 32 minutes, and netted me 4 gold before auctions. I got lucky and found 3 BoE blues in 8 runs. 
---
I made enough gold from the wool/green auctions to buy my mount (I was only at 23g) in a few hours over two days.  I did ding 40 and had MS for the farm though. I also spent 8g on plate armor on the AH to bring my gold down to 23.    
---
Made the money, still had a bunch of auctions left over, and got SUPER lucky and found The Shadowfang, and sold that for another 100g after I bought my mount.  I know that last part is insanely lucky, but I had already made my mount gold regardless.
---
GOod luck!
---
You just know the warrior rolled off-spec and got both of them.
---
I have a list saved of all MCable mobs in classic open world/dungeons, I was more so looking for funny anecdotes lol.
---
Personally I went paladin. I feel they’re the best pvp healer. 
---
My reasons:
---
-Melee don’t touch you in plate armor. 
---
-You have a dispel like priests to cleanse your teammates. 
---
-Freedom and blessing of protection is amazing. 
---
-Can bubble yourself. 
---
-No pushback with talents and aura. 
---
-Takes forever to oom. 
---
-Holy shock, judgement, hammer do decent burst damage. 
---
-Hoj stun is amazing. 
---
-Free mount at 40
---
Things I think kinda stink for paladins:
---
-leveling as a paladin. 
---
-gear itemization. 
---
-casting our mount cost mana (at 60 as holy I guess it doesn’t matter)
---
If I think of more things I’ll edit later. Priest may be more “offensive” because they have a offensive dispel, but I feel paladins are way better at supporting your teammates, and you can play aggressively with hoj, judgements, and holy shock /shrug
---
&gt;So obviously we made it our mission to tag all quest mobs he wanted to attack
---
Sounds salty to me /shrug
---
My own personal experience, I may put a couple points elsewhere because when I use blizz it's not important to be improved, imo, anymore. I don't aoe farm and the times I do aoe are few and 1 point in imp blizz suffices. Might stick those points in a couple arcane talents for help with mana or resists.
---
You did say "cheapest".
---
I don’t think you realize how little damage a resto specced cat does
---
Sun Rock Retreat has gotta be one of the most beautiful horde camps
---
He's a mage
---
If you're a warrior, then it's normal to die to every other mob.
---
That much is for sure. I would never expect a mage to sheep pull unless I asked, since pulling is usually the tank's job.
---
"Hardcore players." Is this what you tell yourself?
---
Are there any quests in Silithus at launch?
---
I always stand my ground and at least take one of you with me. Always worth my run back knowing one of you are running as well.
---
You get reduced XP for turning in red quests.
---
It's also affected by Curse of Tongues which I haven't seen mentioned here. That really sucks when it happens.
---
Turtles in eastern Hinterlands. I make 12g/hr and 30k xp/hr skinning and vendoring greys. They usually aren't crowded and will not aggro unless you attack first.
---
Yup. DKP has a lot issues, but this kind of bullshit isn’t one of them. Blind bid, winner pays 2nd highest bid plus 1. Simple and fair.
---
Hey hold up, I'm a rogue and I save people all the time! It's one of my favorite things to do is pop out of stealth and save someones life by cheap shotting the thing chasing them. It's you horde assholes that then heal yourself and immediately attack me for saving you. Your hatred of rogues is what is making rogues aggro, I went rogue so I could avoid pvp when I want to and farm easier in endgame.
---
&gt; Are you sure you are an innocent bystander.
---
this times a million. What's that saying, something like "if you run into one asshole thoughout the day, you ran into an asshole. If everyone you run into is an asshole, it's probably you that's the asshole"
---
Think of all those viral videos where the person uploading them thought they were making the person they were filming look bad, but in reality it was the person filming the interaction who was behaving like an asshole.
---
I'm not saying there aren't bad interactions that happen in this game, but I am saying if you're constantly running into shit people, maybe try looking at yourself as to why
---
It may even be accidental. Maybe you stole someone's tag without noticing them or ninja'd something when you were half focused on the netflix show on your second monitor. All I know is I'm nice to everyone I interact with and they're nice back
---
I didn't say you said they have to.
---
You don't do it in cat form, you use your AOE spells and barkskin. Look it up on youtube for how to do it.
---
Someone on Pagle has been selling at 2g per run plus 15g when the ring drops.
---
[Honrar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Honrar/) is that you?
---
PvP
---
It’s against sub rules to not be livid at all times
---
Always remember, when that player is ganking you, he's not actually ganking *you* he's taking out his frustration about the last player that ganked *him*.
---
Priest here, also level 34 I feel like we would be friends, if you weren’t a filthy alliance player &gt;:(
---
&gt; Jesus... Just save your mana at that point and get 5sr, if you can't get off a rank 4 heal idk what to tell you. 
---
If you mean the 5sr addon but I have it. As for Heal rank 2, mine actually heals for a lot so using something huge just isn't neccessary. Again if people are taking a ton of damage I'll pull out a GHeal, but most of the time all they need is a Heal rank 2 and they're good to go. Why would I spam rank 4 when it's overhealing? At current gear levels, the efficiency of GH Rank 1 and Heal Rank 4 is about the same, so I keep Rank 1 GHeal on my bar because it heals for slightly more and gets more usage. It's my go to when someone other than a tank is taking huge damage (because max rank GHeal is so huge that really only tanks need it).
---
I see, will do
---
Also the good pve weapons are ridiculously easy to obtain and there's no good enchants for anything yet so you might as well use Lok for PvP and peacemaker / barbarous blade for pve
---
There seem to be a few weak spots in that armor set.
---
50g imo.  150g is actually insane and 100g is still heavily pushing it.  Gotta remember that while you're offering them a discount they're also forgoing a future revenue stream.  Why would anyone pay you 150g when they could pay 250g and then, based on your price, make their money back and then some in two runs beyond their own?  50g is a fair price for an hour or so of work.
---
Haha I’m in danger
---
I played a Tauren Shaman back in Vanilla, and they actually look great. IIRC the wolves scale with the Tauren's body, because I remember sitting next to an Orc on the same mount and our wolves were different sizes. If you were wondering what mount I had it was the Frostwolf mount.
---
Here is an example:
---
https://i.imgur.com/WdWzlkM.png
---
very original
---
Ice barrier, cold snap, and engineering. Easy.
---
Hunter obvious choice, priests very strong, Warriors with support and mages.
---
Mage will not do very much damage but your CC can control damn near the whole battlefield. Rank 1 frost bolt every1, sheep the OP priests, nova etc
---
"In this moment, I am euphoric"
---
So phase 2?
---
“Class leaders” is a scam it just means they get first priority on loot without having to roll. You should have ninjad the majordomo chest and g quit for them saying to shut the fuck up. Better off in a pug where loot is fair.
---
I was going to say Suicide Kings. My guild from vanilla to cata did suicide kings, and I never felt shafted by gear. Not to mention, in our class chat we were rooting for each other for a sweet drop so that someone else could be next! 
---
The only down side is technically a brand new person could take something awesome, and never raid again. We implemented a rule that you start at the bottom instead of the top, and after X missed raids (I think 3) you would go back to the bottom and be skipped until the next raid you showed up
---
Searing totem is solid damage and can finish fleeing stuff at range. Magma totem is your only reliable persistent AoE.
---
Also don't ignore Stoneclaw if you have been. It's excellent as an escape tool, for allowing you to heal, etc.
---
A bunch of my friends are already saying stuff like "I cant wait to hit 60 so I can play something else"
---
I'm not expecting them to stay long enough after 60, they just want the classic experience so they can say they did it.
---
That’ll get you killed in .org if a guard sees you. TRAITOR!
---
Are you tanking as a prot pally? I remember trying that a long time ago in late game but without a taunt I would just get frustrated.
---
Insulting me doesn't make your point.
---
I know that I can heal as a disc. He didnt how it seems.
---
Wow, that's powerful stuff...
---
LOL, GOT WHITEMANE'S HAT, LET'S RUN IT AGAIN\~\~!!
---
Get a whiff of that halitosis.
---
Nope. Silithus didn't become a real zone in Vanilla until much later, either.
---
It was really placeholder.
---
Small edit: a few quests happen in silithus, but they're raid related.
---
I checked the AH on HEROD Alliance last night and there was 0 arcane crystals. I couldn't beleive it.
---
That’s actually true.. they can be a bitch to deal with but with phase 2 and people have a incentive to kill others hopefully this leads to amazing battles. I know my guild is gearing up for it and Bgs
---
The addon functionality seems excessive because people under utilize the combat log, not because it does anything OP itself.  You can't "ban" addons in the first place, you can only break them by changing the way the API works, and that' 100% isn't going to happen. If it did, say goodbye to recount, details!, DBM, and every other combat addon.
---
You're also totally not screwed by Spy if you're a rogue or druid. People seem to think that it shows you where stealthed players are, but that's not the case unless you already have a track stealthed effect enabled.  It's literally as "OP" as every good hunter.
---
you spelled worst wrong. Who the hell wants to be a fat cow?
---
Is it just me or is there absolutely nothing fun to do besides wait for raids every week? They should release pvp and wsg like tomorrow
---
The fact that you think that only further proves my point.
---
It doesent need to affect everyone to be a shit thing to let happen. Its an unfair advantage of being able to have 5x the power of other players at the push of a button. But Blizz makes more money off it so whatever...
---
This mace is absolutely nuts on elemental shamans. I'd save it for BG drop in phase 3 or whatever, and sell it.
---
I mean, I feel like people are just trying to find a reason why to not use dreadsteed. If you have CoT on you, or any of these situations, you should probably be fighting. If you decide to mount and run away, you still will be dismounted by their next spellcasts.
---
rofl, you must be the easiest person to trigger to write a rage post like this. Go work on your insults btw, they make me laugh.
---
Can you get to him as a warlock without aggroing/clearing other stuff out? That's interesting
---
Previous comment:
---
&gt; You don't win an argument by comparing your weakness to their strength
---
This comment:
---
&gt; They aren't though (any stronger than you)
---
Want to make up your mind, buddy?
---
You're so deadset on "winning the argument" that you're going full retard. 
---
You're focusing on PVP and everything else and the fact that they can be beaten while deliberately ignoring the point I'm making.  When you think a question might prove you wrong you just call it "stupid" and write it off.
---
It can be PVP, it can be PVE, it doesn't matter.  They have one "character" with the strength of multiple simply because they paid more.  There is no skill involved, no grind involved to get those extra characters.  They just paid more.
---
You're taking the term "pay-to-win" way too literally.  All it means is paying more to increase performance, which is exactly what multiboxing is.  It doesn't mean they're immortal or unbeatable.  Just stronger.
---
\#NOCHANGES
---
Spy looks at your combat log and simply uses the information to display estimates of player names/level/class.  That's it.
---
As a horde, there is honor in your words. Zug Zug.
---
It's the one i put up after one too many horde shield bashings.
---
Maybe it'll come full circle and you'll use it on me.
---
Chin up.   I put 10 days of time in in September with a bunch of buddies.  But we fatigued ourselves hard.   We all have taken a bit of a break but are slowly getting back on.  Maybe the same will happen for you???   What server, btw?
---
Hi, does anyone know why my warlock has started to say random lines in game? Usually when I'm summoning a minion, but he randomly says shit too. Its really annoying and cringey. Is it from an addon? Or something I can disable in game?
---
Thanks for the insight. Have a good one.
---
KT is a bad fight to have as a metric because his spells can't crush you.
---
There is a column that has the upgrades that come with Dire Maul.
---
There's definitely incentives to run DM for gear aswell as Gold farming!
---
Just wait till he sees Ragnaros.
---

---
“How can I make money?”
---
“I don’t want to be that guy that makes money”
---
I agree with the others stating these guys clearly don’t play. The fact they re-iterate they checked the combat logs but don’t mention the healing you brought up lmao. Super lame
---
[Target is too low level]
---
thanks for the camara tip!
---
Yeah they will just level alts or just login on raid nights and play other games. It's really not a big deal.
---
If I'm honest, I'm probably going to quit once I hit 60, everyone has left me apart from a few faces. The fun start has slowly deteriorated into trying to quest hard areas alone and it's getting frustrating. Who knows, maybe I can encourage the dropouts to all play Retail or something.
---
Depends on how quick the turnover is on the AH.
---
Weekends are quick on my server so I can do shorter listings and know it will still probably sell.
---
Individual items have variable turnover as well,  Things like mooncloth are always moving.
---
In the end, isn't that how rockets work? You mix a fuel and an oxidizer and give it the Taco Bell shits and then you fly.
---
Recommendation: If you are duoing, one of you should be more support based. So if you want to go Shadow, then he can go prot. Or he can go fury and you can go holy/disc. If you two pair up to be the main two players in a dungeon group, it's important that at least one of you is specced a bit better for their role.
---
Personally, I'd recommend you the priest go with a Disc/Holy (with 5 points in Spirit Tap) as that spec can solo much more easily than a prot warrior. And I'm assuming there will be moments where you might not be playing together.  
---
EDIT: Mixed the two of you up. Replace you with her and vice versa when discussing the priest player and warrior player.
---
Using a buff/debuff isn’t cheesing it, it’s a community game! In fact, it makes a ton of sense for your demonic bro to say “oh I can make you so mad you won’t feel fear anymore”
---
Best wishes to Pertento &lt;3 my heroes.
---
Look up the ratchet bank alt skip, can use any class really.
---
Consider leveling to 5 for disenchanting though.
---
What is my purpose?
---
&gt; You cast frstbolt and make food.
---
Oh my god....
---
Yes. With a little bit of help sprinkled in though.
---
This is why I play on a PvE server. The game is slow and grindy enough as is without dealing with this shit
---
The fuck? Coulda sworn I disabled loading screen tooltips.
---
If you’re at the stage where undergeared is fully pre raid bis with no epics, then yes, you should be getting some loot rather than finishing someone’s complete set. 
---
If undergeared means you’ve got half questing greens, then no, you didn’t put the effort in and don’t deserve loot over people that did. 
---
If you’re equally geared, and doing less dps than someone else of the same class, then no you still don’t deserve loot, he’s better than you so he gets priority.
---
Nope. There’s no API
---
Right but the item isn't rare so it really doesn't make any difference. I got my SGC on my first Orc kill but it doesn't change how rare the item is.
---
Horde or Alliance doesn't really matter... just create a level 1 character on same server as your main and run to the big city.  I (for instance) have a Level 1 Mage parked in Ironforge on the Alliance side.  He literally just runs back and forth between the AH and the mailbox.
---
If you get crazy once you have enough gold you could level him some just to do a profession or something but mainly you just use him to mail stuff to while you are out "in the wild" so you don't have to go back to the city as often.  You can also use them so that you never list anything under your main's name but I don't see a reason for that unless you are doing something shady.
---
Pretty sure you've got a better chance at getting loot with a PUG run at this point
---
I make mine tauren (any class) and keep them in Thunder Bluff because I like the bank/AH setup better. If you sell in person via trade chat though Org would likely be better.
---
MC will be farmed through all phases because of legendary mats.
---
I still remember the first time a horde warlock feared me off that lift.
---
Don't call that halitosis!
---
Call that...
---
*Troll mojo*
---
Yeah, it's not ideal but its still more fair than the GM and top officers taking all the loot like OP says is happening.
---
Great, thanks!
---
Don’t forget people having the last word then hitting ignore. They probably feel like they’re on top of the world.
---
What benefit do you get from tracking number of kills? Just so you can complain that the number went up again?
---
Wow that sounded pretty intense, even if it was for a short time.
---
This is the interesting thing too that I feel the need to be chatty about. I truly believe that many people tend to associate the player's class with who the person is deep down. So we might tend to associate priests as a patient, good listeners, kind but firm, mostly polite lot(it's not always true of course). And Druids as *generally* tolerant, understanding, kindly souls deep down(I say this now, and of course I can remember a few who've made my blood boil).
---
Also the whole husband/wife bf/gf duo thing. It's not always the case, and I know it's incredibly stereotypical of me to say this, but it just seems that very often, the wife is the healer of the duo, and husband is either the tank or damage dealer of some kind. And if something happens which angers one or other, if it's the wife who's taken particular umbrage, then both will leave the guild. Your story there really, really resonates with me, because I've witnessed firsthand a situation where even though the specifics sure differed, the end result was the same(both of them leaving together).
---
Reading through the specifics, the social "contract" so to speak, and what must have surely felt like a betrayal...holy god(no pun intended).
---
I don't know, but it does seem that when the hate message comes a man, the punch is swift, hits hard but clean(mostly). If it comes from a woman, the blade is jagged, rusted, and after entry, is twisted.
---
I rerolled on Faerlina, pretty decent alliance population and ironforge/stormwind is always populated, I was on horde Sulfurus and don't notice as much gankning on Faerlina as I did on Sulfurus
---
Nah, he's not orc. Only orcs hard roll offspec on the only swords available to rogues.
---
?
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who does.
---
This ensures that if I survive the encounter I will find you and i will gank you, and not just you but four other of your colleagues. Their blood is on your hands.
---
Okay this is ipic
---
Eventually it will happen, right now markets are weird because there are huge groups at certain levels, and many people are still leveling their skills and the market is flush with certain mats because those groups of people are in similar zones.
---
Every group i do theres someone who doesnt know what to do. This is to show people that dont know. obviosuly.
---
Just jumping in to say that the 15% agility talent is  very gear dependent and being willing to sacrifice higher gear (i.e. AQ40) for higher agility gear coming from MC or BWL is what makes it work.
---
If you have necrosis installed, it does that by default I think. I actually like it so I've never disabled it.
---
You blacklisted someone for asking for a buff?
---
You can keep repeating "going full retard" all you want doesn't make it true.
---
You're the one laser focused on the number of spells you can get off instead of any actual PvP mechanics.
---
You refuse to acknowledge that you can just leave the area.
---
You refuse to acknowledge that they put in more than 5x the effort to level those guys together.
---
You refuse to acknowledge their incredible weakness to cc and AOE.
---
You refuse to acknowledge the fact that you can get 4 other characters, controlled by you or your 4 friends (as if you have any LOL).
---
You refuse to acknowledge that it's world PvP and was never meant to be fair in ANY fashion.
---
Literally all you're doing is circle jerking yourself trying to maintain a pay to win high ground that you yourself admit isn't true.
---
The fact that you see a difference between getting killed by 1 guy with 5 accounts and 5 guys with 1 account each shows you're really just butthurt.
---
You could make the same argument about exploits/cheats but it wouldn't make it right to use them.
---
I will try to if I get invited to a dungeon but only for leveling. I like healing too much to try and tank with a suboptimal class in end game.
---
Paladins were made to be a support class and that is where they shine.
---
Yeah, just a few
---
Achilles heels i say
---
We don't consider those accent marks necessary enough to warrant space on english keyboards though, since those marks are kind of a formality when you use those terms in english.
---
Whichever one you have the most fun with 
---
I did the same thing, created about 4 different characters on horde. Ended up playing a shaman in the end because I thought it was cool and fun
---
Which quest is that?
---
I'm running out of gas in the game.  I hit the boring mid-30s where the zones to me suck, and I'm discovering what I feared before Classic started with regards to the old friends who have returned.  We are all on different schedules and seldom see each other.  Changing guilds means no more friends that I run with.  It's just what I suspected what be the case - was fun for the first 30 levels but now it's become the grind chore with no distinct zones to level.  You have to level some in Arathi, some maybe in Hillsbrad, some maybe in northern Strangethorn or Badlands....
---
Yea having a blast not spending hours looking for a tank for a dungeon, got my own 5 man party to clear dungeons, having a blast.
---
Considering the mods had already taken down this post before you replied... I don't think they care since the rules are VERY clear. The only reason we can still talk is that we have already commented on it.
---
I guess your guild is just starting to get form, so unless you can see other bad signs, I suggest you to wait a few weeks and let dust to settle. Yes, officers fucked up and they have to come up with some transparent and fair method of loot distribution. They are humans, probably not very experienced in guild management, that happens. But if you can see that things are not changing over few weeks, then yeah, time to leave. Or may be your guild will just break and you won't have to worry about it.

Warrior tank main looking to make an alt to counter the weaknesses of my main in order to make money by farming with high mobility

Hunters don't get their pet until 10 and also do not have any of their kiting tools except conclusive shot, which isn't until 8.  If you only play until 10 you will not get a good feeling for the class at all.
---
That's how you fight back when a high leveled Ally ganks you.
---
This, and it may not even be a performance issue, sometimes it's just them making sure you'll be sticking around.  In my small experience of being in guild leadership, we had several members use us to gear up and bail... We're maybe 4 weeks into MC for most guilds and I don't think that's enough time for anyone to make an assumption.  
---
However OPs example about the hunter is a little extreme, and if true is over the line.
---
\#petty - What exactly should this person be blacklisted for?
---
Trains were a big problem in older MMOs and one of the things WoW fixed. It shouldn't be happening the way it is... mobs should only aggro if you do something to get on their threat list (heal, de/buff, damage).
---
Going to need to see a blue post saying that trains were a thing in 1.12 if they don't want to fix it.
---
Which addon is that? I'm using perl right now but I like that better
---
Oh yes.  BRD was my favorite thing from classic.
---
Anecdotally, I believe this is the case. I'm regularly pulling out 4-5 morrowgrain, and a friend of mine was complaining how hard it was for him to get 10 for his quest.
---
It might be a good idea to snag it asap though. 100 gold is an extremely good price for the rarity of the pet.
---
Good luck, I’m sure youll get it.
---
Now do the paladin one :D
---
Grobbulus is the best server

...and he says "Durotar! They got em all over the place!"

Just relevel it'll take you like 2 days to hit 30

People will still play classic no matter what the future may hold.
---
If I wanted to dungeon grind what should I play to be able to always finds groups. I don't exactly remember the layout of any dungeons other than VC and stocks. Finding groups on my hunter is near impossible unless I make the group myself. Which is more fun, tanking or healing? I tanked BC 5 mans with a war but typically only played as mage or hunter
---
I do not understand this subreddit at all.
---
You share accurate information and people downvote. 
---
At crit cap, the highest stat weight is +hit% until 24%. So there obviously must be a formula or table to calculate the effectiveness of your hit/crit before crit cap. 
---
At crit cap 1% hit is basically 1% hit and 1% crit.
---
OP is unfortunately spreading misinformation as we don't know which version of the quest will be out. You can buy some but you may have over spent or have to go buy more. I'm waiting until next week.
---
any interest supporting why you think mirah's is worse? spreadsheet shows deathbringer as pretty noticeably worse, so i'd be interested

Pretty sure recount/details/DBM would still function fine if the combat log omitted combat information about enemy players on targets other than you.
---
is that altoholic add-on?
---
That is starting something. Druids who faerie fire it's the same thing.
---
If you prevent me from stealthing you're fucking a core component of the class, and your mark lasts a very long time. You're going to provoke me even if I didn't intend to fight you before.
---
I watched my dads best friend paralyze himself from the neck down landing on a rock like that, I’ve never done it again
---
&gt;  I count 33 characters, that would need insane money for subs ontop of insane hardware and an insane connection.
---
The record in retail is over 100
---
It shouldn't be slower than rolling. DKP add-on can just autocalculate everyone's bid (if using bid rather than static points).
---
Just need to spend the time initially to set it up correctly.
---
LoL got big after WoW started getting “small.”
---
Yeah because you’re sitting up on the boss meleeing right?
---
Oh no, PVP happened?!
---
This is important if you’re a healer and a group needs you.  I’ve negotiated to kill golem lord for the boots since very little drops and healers have almost no reason to go without golem lord being killed.  He’s in the next room but does require a few pulls to start.
---
The fact that you're still talking about world PVP for the ten thousandth time while literally refusing to acknowledge any of the things I'm **actually saying** makes it very true that you are indeed going full retard.
---
&gt; The fact that you see a difference between getting killed by 1 guy with 5 accounts and 5 guys with 1 account each shows you're really just butthurt.
---
Actually it shows that I'm not completely fucking braindead like you.
---
No one is saying shit about getting killed by them or that that's such a huge problem.  Simply that five characters are stronger than one.  
---
Are five characters stronger than just one?  Obviously.
---
Can I get five characters at once simply by grinding and playing the game?  No.  
---
The only way to get that is to **pay more.**  Therefore it is a **pay-to-win** mechanic.
---

Reroll if you care about ping. My BIL plays a West coast server from the Philippines. And he's been 60 a hot minute.

"Hey man, how's it going? Mind grouping up to deal with these mobs? Will make the quest go faster for all of us. Mind if I get a buff while we're at it?"
---
"OMG BLACKLISTED HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME, SCUM."
---
Use Shadow Unit Frames if you want to show all of that with portraits.
---
I'd add to that you could also grind the Ogres (they might be slightly higher level than pirates) in Tanaris.
---
If you don’t want to lead, healer. 
---
Priest  Druid shaman or Paladin. 
---
I find tanking more interactive than healing and thus more fun. 
---
It is more responsibility though.
---
It’s one handed... when you’re ele you think you’re gonna be meleeing in PvP bro?
---
I still have the Jar, Loadstone, and Glyphs on my lock on Live, been in my back for quite some time, but I never had the heart to just chuck them in the bin.
---
Whites aren't generally worth it, but I do make an exception for shoulders. Low-levels will buy them just for the aesthetics, since it takes a few more levels for them to find any drops or quest rewards for that slot. Otherwise just vendor.
---
Unused my free respect to make a compromise build that has the AOE toolkit but without shatter and improved arcane explosion, that way I could pick up rest of the points into improved frostbolt and pick up winter's chill so I could justify not being arcane Frost in raid, now I don't have to swap specs and I'm a respectable contributed to the raid damage. Cookie cutter builds are fine and dandy but making some variations to fit personal playstyle is important.
---
You are correct. I believe it needs to be a 2013 or later supporting Metal API. I have heard people say they can play it utilizing bootcamp. Don't expect anything over 30fps. Still is plenty playable
---
Do you suppose they're gold farmer types? Or just dudes over there that want to play? I dont know why I am so fascinated with this lol
---
I would still vote against buying all your spells =). Plan them out so you have what you need to efficiently level and get the fluffier ones at a higher level.
---
Definitely get bags.  More space = more money over time and less trips to town.
---
Orherwise, yes, save it.  No sense in buying items.
---
Seems like you already have it figured out
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Fury with a 2H
---
Im a lvl 60 Prot Warrior, and super broke. What are good ways to get some money? Proff are skinning/eng.
---
Depends on the competency and gear of the members of the group. It's certainly possible with 5.
---
Go into graphic settings. It defaults to a higher/newer graphical setting. You can change it back to worse graphics for better FPS. 
---
Downscaling the resolution helps a bunch and doesn’t change too much.
---
But like...does it still work haha?
---
It is possible that it's working as intended if there's some kind of exploit which they tried to prevent by explicitly filtering out healers.
---
Spoken like someone who will never retire
---
All of it
---
Yup, my friend had it and he was protecting me/hunting players in Un'goro and I don't think anyone slipped past us. Its brutal.
---
I think he already ignored you.  Really the only explanation.
---
This. Effort = Loot. Early on it may be hard to see the differences in loot. It’s up to the leader ship to rationalize. On p.servers, our guild had a viewable google spreadsheet with attendance records past loot distributions and prio’s for next drops, etc. It’s a lot of work for officers to maintain but transparency is crucial to community. It’s up to a guild’s leadership to communicate effectively, however that looks. Loot council when done correctly is the best method imo.
---
Hunter doesn't do much damage but they can pretty much never die due to being one of the only classes that can slow and range at level 19.
---
Priests are best healers at 19.
---
hmm should probably put being a tank.
---
Definitely makes it sound more dramatic though, eh?
---
Agree.
---
this sounds like the GM is missing the point. Not sure what else can be done here. It's crazy that they are basically saying you cant be just healing and need to be mana inefficient and waste it so u can contribute a bit more to dps.
---
calling somebody a moron once  = throwing insults?
---
okay. 
---
i'm not the one getting mad because of special characters
---
Yeah it works fine it's just EVIL
---
Prostitution. 
---
Selling your tanking for certain things. 
---
Tank Strat Live for 1st orb drop. 
---
Tank ZF for 5g. 
---
Tank ST for 10g 
---
Etc.
---
MC trash runs?
---
Silliest looking race in wow.
---
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM! You’ve violated the law!
---
Whats this addon called?
---
Exactly this. You want an addon to predict the future. 
---
Dmg and healing received are all processed in batches, the addon you want will only give you wrong info and sounds completely useless imo.
---
Sap would break his stealth so he wouldn't be able to use ambush...
---
Raids and dungeons are two different things.
---
Dungeons cap to 5 resets an hour. So if you chain reset like BRD arena runs you will need to wait a bit for you can reset again. Beyond that nothing else impactful for any other dungeon.
---
Raids are different. MC has a weekly reset on Tuesday. If you kill a boss or join a locked raid you are tied to that Id until it resets. Ony is every 5 days on a rolling timer with the same principals.
---
Pepitos, eh? Did you ask him if cat was for sale?
---
I stopped and stared at the moon in desolace for about 5 minutes a few nights ago. I love this game.
---
They mentioned they didn't want to implement an amrory as it would hurt the LFG aspect. People would screen you via the armory and if your gear wasn't up to par they might not invite you. People are kinda petty and do this kind of things when we saw first hand mc be completed in greens.
---
Not even close man. No offense. Try this:
---
Pre zerker rage. I see hundreds of these rotations and not one person mentions prezerking or zerkrage at all. Do it. 
---
Prezerk&gt;battle&gt;charge&gt;tclap&gt;d stance&gt;blood rage&gt;demo
---
I should add I've already set it to the 1 preset.
---
The hypocrisy is astounding.
---
You're still focusing on one aspect and claiming that makes it pay to win.
---
Overall, multiboxers are weaker in pvp than normal people.
---
Every strength or advantage they get is matched or outmatched by disadvantages.
---
It's not retarded to look at the overall picture, it's called pragmatism.
---
holy shit... as someone who has never played alliance or a paladin, that combat log... is playing pally really just autoattacking?
---
Just as a general rule, if it's a PVP server it's usually Horde majority, and if it's Normal then it's usually Alliance majority.
---
You called me an idiot too, maybe you’re not intelligent enough to remember. All things you wouldn’t say in person though 😳
---
Im actually planing on making guild that will take bounties on black listed players off oposite faction, and money would be transported via BB AH, so I guess ill have some horde friends and a lot of enemies :)
---
You'll still get raid groups even if you stay feral.
---
That said, you'll do better off respeccing resto/balance for raids and guarantee yourself a spot.
---
All guilds, at least on my server, have a high demand for druids as raid healers + buffers + innervate.  I've been solicited and bribed for guilds.  A few even wanted me as a bear tank which is wild.
---
I'm still only level 42 and have a ways to go before I start raiding.  Which means the demand is pretty crazy if they want to groom me at such a low level
---
Good read
---
Right behind you! Level 31.
---
Whats the addon called... gonna give'r a Download tn ;)
---
I think paladins require less skill, and priests can be better but require more practice to get really good at.
---
There was a girl in my guild in WotLK, who had a potato of a PC.  It was so bad, that after Anub'Arak would drop the floor out of TOC, her computer wouldn't load the water until after she hit the bottom.  She needed a rez every time.
---
Goodluck finding a good raiding guild that isn't loot council lol
---
Hope it's gone for good. From experience such injuries to knees can come back as random ache even many years after it. Stupid knees.
---
But does it really use the combat log? Spy shows people who haven't made a single action and can be afk when I run up on them.
---
then why dont you do that? Having an addon that tells me what enemys are close to me without me seeing them doesnt even sound fun to me?
---
If you don't mind respecting arms or fury (if you're prot), I highly recommend solo farming library in SM
---
You're confusing raids and dungeons. Right now, there's only two raids: Molten Core and Onyxia. Everything else (including UBRS) is a dungeon. 
---
Raids have lockouts. They reset weekly, on Tuesdays. I don't know WHY Tuesday is the lockout, but it's been the lockout for practically every MMO I've ever played. 
---
Dungeons do not have lockouts. In most games, when you leave/re-enter a dungeon it's reset. Classic is unique because it requires you to physically run to the dungeon. In this case, the way to reset the dungeon is to have everyone exit the dungeon, have the party leader right click on his portrait and select "reset instance". This will make sure all mobs/bosses are respawned. It's likely this step was skipped on your BRD runs, either because the party leader changed or he wasn't doing it in the first place and ya'll simply encountered a bug. 
---
For OT, you've got several different jobs depending on the scenario. Normally you'll split up trash mobs between tanks (in my guild, MT takes Skull and OT, which is me, takes X). You'll also be responsible on mobs like the Annihilator, which continuously reset aggro, to rotate Taunts. Some bosses have adds - you're generally required to hold those adds. An example would be Lucifron. Some bosses require multiple tanks, either because there's multiple adds (Lucifron, Garr, etc.) or because there's tank swap mechanics (Golemagg). Some bosses, you literally just sit there acting like a DPS unless the tank dies for some weird reason (Magmardar). You may also have additional debuff responsibilities - as the OT, I'm normally responsible for keeping up Thunder Clap on bosses. I don't normally worry about my position on threat unless I see the MT lose it for some reason, and then I'll taunt it off the DPS. This is pretty rare if your group actually gives him time to get some threat.
---
Yeah getting whispered to tank some dungeon makes me feel really important
---
The trash pulls before Drakk are normally more difficult than Drakk himself. Especially when your average UBRS group contains an overabundance of melee. You have assassins which hit hard and the tanks usually must not aggro and let the dps tank it or they will get gouged and lose aggro on everything. The captains cause a knock back which drop threat so you have to save a taunt for them. The dragon wizards do a large amount of AOE dmg that can easily blow up a geared tank who gets fire nova’d twice if they don’t separate them quick enough. And lastly the other orc mobs stun the tanks constantly making it even harder to get threat. On each of these pulls you are usually dealing with all of that shit at once. Tanking Ubrs dozens of times puts hair on a mans chest.
---
I have bad news about this mount run if you are bringing a tank or anyone that needs gear from dire maul east.  
---
This run is to get the warlock without a mount an epic speed mount.  Everyone in the group besides the one providing the summoning materials are going there on behalf of the warlock.  Also, not everyone has to get some big gain out of a dungeon to want to join it.  Tangent - some people just go to help, which is kind of what got us players in retail into this titanforging debacle.  People running not essential content for a chance at a piece of TF gear they can use at their current progression level.
---
Classic rattlegore server
---
And you're lucky if it's only 2 other people rolling.
---
How do players get added to the KoS function? Does the addon track gankers or do players add people they don't like to a database?
---
^^
---
Do you have rage? It will light up but if you don’t have the rage you can’t use it. It’s small like 5 or so, but still requires rage.
---
If anything that might be the problem.
---
TAKEN OFF THE BLOODY BEATEN CORPSE OF A DIRTY ALLIANCE DOG
---
If you're doing quests/side bosses it can take upwards of 2 hours. Going straight to the Scarlet mobs is much faster though, you could do 60-80 minutes if you're cruising along with a good group
---
I don't know. I haven't seen enough of them to say it's an epidemic but I've had enough gold selling invites that they must be farming with somebody. If it was just gold farming would they even bother questing? What's their method of leveling like?
---
Yeah, you're really "articalte", little Johnny.
---
Jesus fucking Christ, you are still going on about fucking PVP?
---
Why do I even write out these explanations when you don't even read any of it and just launch into your pre-prepared schpiel about how they're still beatable in world PVP?  I've acknowledged this like five times already.
---
Simple question: Do five characters do more or less damage than one character when you hit a button to cast a spell?
---
The true value of this mace comes from the fact that you can smack a bunch of alliance fools and then instant hearthstone to safety.
---
Haha just finished this today, and went to work (wacky shift) completely satisfied. And awards are just great
---
I was pretty psyched when "Azaghâl" was available on my server, then I was even more psyched when I found out I could make a macro that would /y "Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!" with just one click.
---
It seems so, but that's just a confusing way to phrase it.
---
Looks like PreparedWow is back in town
---
It's fine. Take it and go.
---
I'm sure you would've received the same threat if you were main tank and also did the most dps the entire time
---
What level are you?
---
And if I get a guildie to borrow me 300g and never pay him back, I'll get my epic Kodo for 600g.
---
Why would you expect him to carry the whole cost of the items while letting you leech off of his investment? Why wouldn't you just split the cost evenly?
---
You have a problem with him wearing the best possible gear for the job? Most warriors gear for both roles. Not everyone knows what the best gear is for other classes, nor do they have to care about helping a rando they dont know gear. He won the roll fair and square.
---
Also, dps gear becomes more valuable as your raid dps gears because you need to put out more tps to keep up with them. So yes, warriors need dps gear.
---
Well Blizzard is not the UN security council. It is a company and it is bound to please its shareholders both long and short term. It is hard to argue that the chinese gaming market does not have a huge revenue potential. Should one then conclude that Blizzard should do fuck all to just please its shareholders? No. Should you look to gaming companies to be stalwarts of international human rights? Probably not.
---
You need to find the places that gives you pleasure and the places that give you meaning. However these are most likely not the same places.
---
Wow for me is fun, its not Amal Clooney with taunts and a cool looking shield. She is not in wow, and that is ok.
---
&gt; . You are a level 58 priest in dungeon greens and blues.
---
It doesn't say they don't have it, and Hydrocane *is* a dungeon blue.
---
I most cerainly am not, always a warrior for me
---
Mages are invites for aoe groups otherwise tank/healer.
---
And yet people have raided with it as DPS - it's insane AoE threat affected by Talents IIRC.
---
People spent over a decade playing private servers.  I doubt classic is going anywhere, though eventually they may have to roll servers together and launch fresh servers periodically.
---
Its a video game, this attitude is totally appropriate here
---
You can make them more interactive by pulling more, there's just not really much benefit since you have 0 aoe... But they're great with even just one more player because they have so much utility the whole game.
---
Def deserved it.
---
Depending on what you're putting points into that could also include 3% dmg + 3% crit damage and 3% hit.
---
But yeah, if the group is cool with it then no reason not to go for it.
---
I've never seen so many salty rogues in one thread
---
If you‘re a tank i think you‘ll have to relay on your jobs for that. Just be steady, do the dungeon quests, don‘t buy anything until you‘ll habe your mount.
---
I didn‘t specc tank until Inhaf my epic mount and I‘m just now skillong mining/engi and don‘t know how mich I can male of that.
---
To farm my epic mount i precisely took over Satyr camps in Azshara for the sweet felcloth.
---
It depends what you refer to as longevity. The thing about classic is it is finite and will have an ultimate end (phase 6) but it has phases with an unknown release schedule too, so this could be a couple years or whatever in total time. Not that the game ends, but  popularity will seemingly drop once everyone has geared out in the best they can get and run the final raid a lot.
---
I feel the same about my shaman. Unless I want to use up my mana bar on every mob, I need a shield, slow 1-h and WF. Ligntning shield, auto-attack till dead, heal and repeat. 
---
I always throw in some shocks when I get too bored, but then I'll need to drink after. Totems are not efficient on the move.
---
Yes, loot will still drop
---
This is great thanks
---
No. They are decoupling Dire Maul from Phase 2. It is releasing on Tuesday, the rest of Phase 2 is not.
---
Real nice mannnn. Realllll nice.
---
Imagine being an orc an saying this
---
We kind of forgot about the iron price
---
It's hard to say.  I am a healer by nature but as a Druid I have also been tanking a majority of the time because there as so many priests.
---
I would vote go Druid so you can do both.  Or maybe Paladin but I have no experience playing them.
---
Shaman is also great utility/offheals.
---
Healing/tanking come with great responsibility.  Moreso for the tank as the healer can just press a key while the tank is madly tabbing through mobs to keep aggro.
---
If you want full on activeness and respinsivility and always get a group go warrior.  If you want to fill any role at any time you're needed, go druid.  If you just want to heal and nothing else go priest.  If you want to be more relaxed and dps/utility go shaman (though you may have to be main healer sometimes still).  All are very sought after.
---
Tank requires the most effort.
---
Oh no, some random dude i don't know ignores me...wait. is my life even worth living anymore?
---
I approve of everything in this comment.

If only I could wear plate - I'd go grab some of those crazy paly shoulders.

---
Hunter for farming deffo
---
You don't need one. The best pet for raids is a wolf, the rest of your setup looks fine.
---
PROTIP:
---
Spirit regen on priest =
---
13 + (spr/4) mp2 (after 5 seconds of no casting)
---
So 400 spirit = 113 mp2
---
#mp5 gear also ticks mp2, so 10mp5 is actually 4mp2
---
Extra tip: Spirit regen continues during casting, and won’t trigger the 5 second cooldown on regen until the spell actually casts. If you download an Addon, you can time your casts to start right when you tick a regen to get an extra tick or two in.
---
After few they'll block your account.
---
An example of two people being unkind to each other.
---
Hmm im a waiter and survive well. Lower middle class. Work 32-38 hours a week as well. Some times bring home 500 dollars a night on weekends.
---
So what about this encounter is supposedly bannable?
---
The disadvantage is actually bigger then the advantage imho
---
The lesson should definitely be: Rogue = Dead
---
It straight up tells you when a rogue is near you in stealth. You have to be close enough to trigger the default effect where you see / hear a rogue for a split second, but the addon then has a giant pop up to make sure you realize you just wlaked passed a rogue. Even gives their name and level.
---
I gave up farming this recipe for days, even helped a hunter get his sinew (and he actually got it). Price of these robes have gone too far down for me to want to continue farming these

people like u should burn in hell
---
If OP lights up on a cleave, it means one of them dodged. I usually spam it on the primary target, and if it fizzles, tab then OP again on the 2nd target will work
---
&gt; I switch targets, but then overpower is not available any more.
---
You most likely took too long  to swap targets (you only have a 5s window to use OP)
---
I respect it. Had to kill mobs in 3 different zones, for 3 different homing beacon quests, all of which to be turned in at booty bay.
---
Rogues are stupid easy to kill as shadow priest too IMO. They can blind, sap, or gouge me all they want but my DoT usually stops a full reset and my bubble negates their burst. Then its just fear &gt; mind blast &gt; mind flay. 
---
My KoS targets are paladins as an undead priest. They've got so many CDs it always becomes a fun battle of attrition.
---
There are literally two comments that are saying "no, retail bad" and then two rational responses:
---
&gt;They’re there, but retail is about sitting in a crowded town and queuing rather that traversing the works. So content is forgotten or goes unseen.
---
&gt;Yes but the game does not really foster an experience for noticing them so many go wasted. It's all about gogogogo and super fast spammy action and streamlined systems and playsessions. Very little focus on immersion anymore.
---
These are critical of retail but at least present legitimate reasons and acknowledge that, yes, they do still do things like this. 
---
So it's pretty much 2 circlejerk-y comments, and two real responses. So I'm not really sure "dont listen to the others, anything critical of BFA is a circlejerk" is an accurate response. Just another layer of circlejerk, it's jerks all the way down.
---
Lol, cute outlook!
---
For me in SM ruin I usually will do
---
1-3: corruption immolate &gt;shadowbolt
---
4+: keep corruption on all and then move to aoe spells
---
I dont have math to back this up as the best but its what I do, also I always agony if mobs live long enough for it to start ramping but if not I just leave it off. Even at 58 running UBRS mainly only bosses live long enough to make agony worth considering. The corruption on all is just to try to get some good damage flowing and get nightfall procs
---
Look at osrs. It peaked, it dropped, now it's bigger than rs3. I see the same happening to classic.
---
Yes I did need that much cloth because you dont get as much rep once your level 60 from those quests.
---
Typical response: help them kill whatever mob they're fighting, /wave and/or /bow, move along
---
Rogue: They're already dead, I helped. Can't vanish if you bleed.
---
Yes, it really uses the combat log.  It does not show people that haven't done anything to be in your combat log.  You may just not realize what the combat log actually shows. Things like auras will trigger a detection, even though it doesn't really look like they've done anything.
---
Well, you CAN press Judgment every 8 seconds and recast your seal, but my ability to concentrate on that and watch por\^h\^h\^hYoutube at the same time is lacking.
---
Nah Fury tanks get BoLight.

I don't think people are feigning the outrage over this lol. Do you see how many people are permanently deleting their accounts over this?

wtf this is unplayable

Thats Prepared, he streams on Twitch, cool dude.

He runs 40 accounts.
---
And no, Multiboxing is not cheating, or unfair.
---
CLASSIC + CONTENT LEAKED YOU SAW IT HERE FIRST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I see Iron Grenades as the one to use for PvP.
---
Yeah because the Alliance on Sulfuras are just little angels in STV lol.
---
As a shaman, I do it rather regularly. Totem weaving is OP yo.
---
Correct. Although kinda not relevant to do conversions at lower levels. Hardly any gear has power or crit
---
suggestion for good mobs to grind xp as a level 45 horde rogue? I'd prefer mobs over dungeon grinding. Thanks!
---
Ok, so you're in the "Its fine to roll need on off spec" camp.
---
That's all I was looking for.  I'm sure that leather eye of rend will receive a ton of use main tanking in MC.
---
That will take the rest of his time for the duration of classic - nobody sells elementium like that. 100% solo is 20k gold - again - a fucking waste.
---
It’s elementium ores, not comparable to ingots, which is a meme weapon.
---
The purpose of a Loot Council is to maximize the net dps of the raid group, get the main tank(s) kitted out as quickly as possible, and gear the healers that show up consistently. It’s about gearing a team, not individual guildies. If they can’t do that effectively, leave. If they can do that effectively, but you want to see progression in your stats panel more than progression in your team’s overall strength, or raid in a more casual environment with flexible attendance, also leave. That isn’t a dig, either. Different strokes for different folks.
---
I think a lot of guild leads are turning to loot council prematurely because of how much easier the content is relative to vanilla release. Clearing the content in two weeks means you’re a top tier guild, right? The problem is that maximizing the performance of 40 players while minimizing drama and keeping a level and objective head didn’t get easier. There’s no wowhead strat guide for that, so people get in over their head.
---
The add-on literally screens information already available. It's not a breach in any way and is basically normalized at this point.
---
I think it's best to use the "50 DKP MINUS!!!" method.
---
Oh, and find a new guild run by mature folk... not selfish twerps.
---
Horde racials are generally better in PvP
---
still a badass thing though an undead epic horse in classic I cant wait to move that fast, currently only 53 here but I am a warlock so
---
My goal with priest to to drink a little as possible.
---
My record so far has been a full Lib run drinking only twice for rebuff.
---
Your lock is higher then mine level wise but I've been testing this theory as well. Honestly depending on the spec I would say it can vary so let's start with affliction. Up to 3 targets I would say if you cast, agony, corruption(instant cast b/c of affliction talent) and immolate all of them it can compete/out compete rain of fire. The Hellfire ability is the best way to go for most damage for groups 3 or greater no matter what spec you are running I personally dont go for it all the time thought because it can strain the healer, (if they are nice enough to heal you) and it can pull a lot of aggro. If their is 4 or more I would definitely go for hellfire all the time though. While throwing some instant curses on a focused target if need be. 
---
Destruction I have not tested to give strong enough advice, I know there are some talents that can stun and prevent spell push back as well as increased fire damage down that tree that could alter some best case group damage scenarios.
---
Demonology depends on what pet you have out and if you sacrifice it for the sake of the pull. That being said I would still lean towards hellfire unless you have also speced into affliction, in which case sacrificing your succubus and throwing a few DoT's on a group of 3 or less would compete if not beat a hellfire. After those DoT's are up just spam shadowbolt. 
---
The previous info is based on groups, for single target rotation it depends on spec. Which is a lot of info and if you look up the Deep Dives on YouTube you will find all the info you are looking for! 
---
I am also not level 60 yet so this is more of for warlocks who are 45 and lower. I have done dungeons and questing.
---
If you're at the bottom and think you deserve gear then you're delusional. The reason why the top players get the gear is because they are putting work in for it. They are showing that upgrades will matter more to them than someone who is "undergeared" (I think you mean lazy or inept here)
---
So tagging a mob is not ok? Lol

Throws grenade at where you cursor is at the time of clicking. Hitting the macro again while holding shift again cancels the macro.

You will learn soon enough that you can’t show mercy. Bury those feelings of pity and compassion DEEP INSIDE
---
You also need around 6g for the pots to make jaedenar friendly with you.
---
It doesn't, go read the code if you don't believe me..  Or go look at your combat log settings, turn everything on, and see just how much stuff is actually detected (like auras). By default the combat log prints very little information, it's all there though.
---
You gotta kill the elementals, but warlocks have banish. Stopid helpful especially if you are timing the curse of dooms welll.
---
I'm 58 and I use grenades all the time for PvE. Even use them in Dungeons to CC sometimes.
---
Yeah you want to only pull 1 at a time until you're much more comfortable and have some more utility skills
---
This is how he responds to the people asking to quest with him I bet, accusatory, sarcastic, and riding the victim card would rile plenty of people up
---
The second time around will be a lot quicker. Just put your head down and grind it out.
---
They can't, but assuming they could, how exactly do you think that would happen?
---
But, have you tried dpsing more instead of healing so much?
---
I agree with this...and it's one of the coolest abilities for the class.  I'm not an RPer but I feel more "in character" sneaking around to avoid things.  Other classes are known to go slamming into battles and dealing as much damage as possible.  Being a rogue is more fun if you're tactical.
---
This person had you on ignore before he sent the message, and forgot about it.
---
and all cooldowns are ready 5-10 min later
---
I only see one person being a dick in this conversation, but maybe I'm just old.
---
But if it turns out the dude doesnt get to tank because no guild wants tanks (trust me, i looked) and hes forced to go dps, that eye of rend might be useful.
---
A little late, but yes, Spazz can be solo'ed from lvl54 on:

yup
---
Rogues have been on my list for years. Classic Hunters are close to earning kill on sight. Too many have waited for me to be in combat and then started something and that's a match up where the person who starts combat has the best shot.
---
So how high did the hunter roll?
---
Lmao you noob
---
r/SailorMood
---
For the Hor.....liance?
---
Completely. And all of retail is now.
---
Pay to get to level 110. Hit 120 in a couple hours. Buy wow tokens, sell for gold, buy BOE gear. Congrats, you are now raid geared with less than 24 hours /played.
---
Watching all my guildmates follow this pattern with their alts was one of the last straws before I quit retail and just waited for classic.
---
I enjoy a good cheap shot
---
I can only see it happening with rare recipes like flasks because theres a limited amount of people able to make them
---
Real life
---
Fify and let us never speak of this again.
---
Back in BC I offered in trade like 50g per person to anyone willing to help me out with the paladin portion in DM. I had one guy whisper and said him and his friend would help. We get to the dungeon and the "friend" was just on follow a majority of it, some times moving and casting a spell or two, but then the other guy would stop moving. I'm like 99% sure it was just some guy with his second account trying to get an extra 50. So at the end I told them to both come to me and I'd pay them. Guy runs up alone and I trade him, then like 5 seconds after he stops moving and the other guy starts moving again so I just hearthed out paying only the one guy. 
---
Not really related, but it's a story that stuck with me this whole time.
---
there are three types of efficient dungeon grind groups
---
1. Healer, Tank, 3 Mages
---
2. Healer, Tank, 3 Warriors
---
3. Healer, 4 Mages or 4 Warriors
---
The best healer are priests, and in my opinion the best DPS are mages.
---
So all you gotta do is either be a tank, healer, mage, or warrior
---
People greatly underestimate the power of Gheal + renew into spirit regen.
---
Go from 40% hp to 90% with a 300+ regen ticking means I get A LEAST 4-5 ticks of spirit regen in, which at 63 mp2 fro. spirit is 320 mana regened, which almost leaves me back at my original mana before casting the heal in the first place.
---
If I ignore renew, I get my gheal, and maybe 2-3 ticks in before I have to start my precast on heal, not to mention tanks working around HoTs (popping block chance spells or stuns to get that extra regen in)
---
Also for those unaware
---
Ya! When they both crit, a paladin jumps above holy priest wand damage.
---
Shankergirl is reporting him for poaching an endangered species of lion, often butchered for their whiskers.
---
unsub'd. they made a valiant attempt w classic but i just can't take how glitchy this game still is after how much time and money they've had.
---
aha! thanks for the clarification -- that makes sense if that's the case and adds another 100g of savnigs!
---
Lol he replied to a jab at him. Did the video make you feel bad? :'(
---
Oh that is perfect thank you so much. Now I don't have to reroll my hunter just for a race change lol.
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
Dude!
---
I like ony in the air longer because I can pad the healing meters more. My best so far is 25k ahead of 2nd place.
---
Other than that i agree (I'm just memeing about p2 ony). The people who disagree are literal retail babies who are likely used to getting normal tf gear to mythic ilvl and think they deserve it.
---
Thank you! I love to draw armor with scratches, make it more worn, aged, forged in combat:) glad you've pointed it out and noticed!
---
maybe its cuz i mained a shammy in a past life, but i agree with you that pally can be a very engaging class if you want it to be.  you can do some crazy blasts if you stay on top of your procs and cds, take on packs of mobs, and do some cool stuff when fighting undead enemies.  plus between heals, slows, stuns, and clense make for a fun group role.   also there is something to be said about having moderate engagement for loooooooooooooong peroids of time vs. having to sit and eat/drink every three mobs.
---
I was also R14 in classic. Both rogues and mages can beat a shadow priest 1v1 if they know what they are doing. A mage can full clear your dots twice, sheep, reset, and run me oom. A rogue can 2 shot me with the right set up. Plz dont make excuses for them.
---
I got straight mobbed the one time I tried, mighta just sucked though.
---
This is customer service. Usually agents (in this case, GMs) have no idea what it is they're helping with. Just the rulebook laid in front of them along with training on how to deal with it.
---
and ele as well I assume?
---
Incendius gives Hydrax rep too so not a bad boss to farm.
---
Well this must have been a good read because it has made troll blood boil at the thought of loosing to weak spined alliance, with no satiated retaliation. You will get your comeuppance!
---
How are we supposed to blacklist you if you don't tell us your char name?
---
Sitting in org to get that much cloth? Are you buying gold?
---
Superior faction icon got it.
---
2h hands down.
---
Once you hit 35 run SM Arm until you get Ravager  or your eyes bleed.
---
Ravager is kinda bugged (In a good way) with WF in that its WF procs can build during the spin and any WF "hits" you have while spinning  won't actually trigger during the spin but will add extra chances to proc the spin effect again.
---
Its basically BiS for any fight with 2+ mobs until around 50
---
Yep, BGs were cross server in 1.12 and will be in classic.
---
That is simply not true. The whole sub is still raging against them.
---
Might as well get the rest of the armor...😂
---
&gt; Do five characters do more or less damage than one character when you hit a button to cast a spell?
---
Why are you so fucking terrified of answering this question?  You've dodged it like a dozen times by now.
---
When AQ40 dropped i told all of my higher ranks in the guild they would not see any gear for the first run. They all agreed and never had issues. MC is a little different and most of the gear is junk, tanks always get first dibs. Spread out the gear to others that are top performers, it doesnt require gear to see how one is capable of going above and beyond. Consumes, potions, world buffs, knowing / learning the content before hand.   
---
Most guild leadership is corrupt and it will break most guilds apart before AQ, many others will break in AQ when they have troubles. Players shouldnt care of gear, but care more of the progression of the guild but that doesnt mean you should be passed up on every piece that you can use.   
---
Check loot prios, the guild google doc's and see how prepared they are set up before joining and raiding. 
---
Best of luck and i'd suggest finding a new guild.
---
How is it cheating? You pay for 5 accounts, you get 5 accounts.
---
Now that's a story i'd like to hear
---
Okay fair play, misunderstood! 
---
While I see the value in not wasting 30 mins looking, it makes it robotic and you wouldn’t form a bond. I can definitely see that and why you hate it
---
why do people need the addon then? if it screens the information available they should just be able to do it without it, no?
---
Come on now, this is a silly excuse. They've broken plenty of other addons that used already available information
---
Get that last execute off before you die! Literally my whole questing experience in STV.
---
So they were supposed to be assassins keeping the world on track by killing people who were going to screw up the weave of fate, or something like that. They got their targets from stitching in the loom, if you remember.
---
Well, at some point, Morgan Freeman's character's name cropped up. As well as hers and every other assassin's in the group. Maybe not at once, but over time. Rather than kill off everyone with actual skill, he started ignoring the names that they were supposed to kill and instead started selling hits to the highest bidder.
---
When she finds out, she kills everyone, because she was the last believer in the system.
---
I’ve heard this a lot recently. Excited as I’ve never done it. And as a fellow tank with same profs I feel this dude’s post.
---
You may be right.
---
Yeah guess they go 1H + Schield too, due to Manareg, but I'm not sure about that.
---
Imagine thinking I am Chinese when you can clearly see where I live from my post history, mods aren't in anyone's pocket if anyone is it would be the admins but if you want to stay delusional and play martyr for a cause you didn't think about 48 hours ago you are more than welcome to. Don't forget to post a screenshot of you unsubbing! 
---
 #FreeHongKongUntilIforgetAfter3days
---
Yeah I main a priest, so I think it’s just a conditioned response, lol.
---
&gt;Near
---
In my experience it's never done correctly.  It's always the guild leaders just giving themselves the items they don't have and then passing the "leftovers" to whoever they like best.  I'm sure there are guilds that keep spreadsheets and stuff, but I don't believe for a second most of them are doing it that way. Now I only join MS&gt;OS + Need&gt;Greed runs and it's way more fun and fair.
---
Not necessarily. His sentiment is “don’t worry about next year, live in the now”
---
Well, what if you devote a Shit load of time to classic, and you’re really proud of your account, and it’s the only game you play. Well, what if they decide to can it in a year? There’s definitely something to be said for planning ahead for potential possibilities.
---
My only note: Emperor doesn’t drop HoJ.
---
GG Allin? Especially with that mustache.
---
What about the chinese-cu?
---
What if it’s like a reverse loot council where one mage has gotten lucky 4 weeks in and gotten most of the loot?  Is it okay to tell him he needs to hold off on rolls?
---
Smh
---
noice - thank you!
---
Now in my 40's when I respec to ele (ThAtS WHat ThE GuiDES SaY) should I ahve a 1h+S ready with spell caster stats on the 1h or just go with like a staff?
---
Nobody cares.
---
Next time save your $$ and buy a desktop ;)
---
Your analysis of the Woman as the Healer thing is actually pretty on point for the most part. The only reason I rolled priest was because my BF at the time wanted a healbot for BG's.  Other Husband and Wife Combos I've seen have been Wife Healer, Husband DPS/Tank, but while that is fairly common, isn't always the case. I just think it just ends up being convenient for one person to be healer when leveling together as well.
---
haha, ya. I'm level 36 now. I level with a warrior friend so once every 30 minutes or so half a monsters health will disappear and I'll yell out FUCK YES on discord. I'm not noticeable the other 29 minutes outside of my timely heals :)
---
Style trumps substance at that level.
---
And those five characters, they are stronger than just having one character, yes?
---
And you are paying more to get this competitive advantage?
---
I really wish I had talent now, after seeing the interest.
---
OP is keeping his personal blacklist, but is probably on everyone else’s...
---
Dunno anything about that. I'm level 40 and would die if a devilsaur sneezed on me.
---
Feel free to gloat if I am wrong but I guarantee the price of obtaining Crusader enchant (and every other twink enchant/end game enchant) is going to go up, not down. People that spent the time and effort to level Enchanting aren't going to give you an enchant for a tiny amount of gold. If the amount of everything else increases, Enchanters will raise prices to make it remain a profitable profession.

[VanasKOS](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vanaskos)
---
You can add custom lists of people you consider KOS, good list, hate list (like a member of your own faction who is a dick), etc etc.
---
You can also share your lists between guildies (I have it set to share and accept automatically between any other guild member also using it).
---
It also has some nice features like if you mouseover a person name it tells you have many times you have seen this person, killed this person, and been killed by this person.
---
Will be really cool once you start gathering a lot of data once you been pvping against the same people a lot when the honor system fully implemented.
---
That seems to be a server thing, this Sulfuras. Just the other day some guy was claiming that on Sulfuras, multiple guilds all registered their Rag kills weeks ago, and 25+ guilds are all yawning and saying how bored they are, and hurry up Blizz we need new content.
---
Yeti's in feralas, should be pickpocketable and skinnable quick respawns too.  I farmed multiple levels there even while groups were doing quests and never ran out of creatures to kill.
---
I've never forgotten a show so quickly.

Max proc  is 7 per min which is why you want ist to Hit harder than more often. Use wepon with Ort higher than 3.5.

Yeah seems like it works when the guild officers actually have the best interest of the guild and its raiding progression at heart, if the members of the raid core understand and accept their decision even if they may disagree, and if effort is rewarded fairly. In this case it sounds like it is just used as a way for the officers and their friends to get gear faster.

You can DE any level item at level 5 with rank 1 enchanting. Good for getting mats you either need, or mats to sell for decent gold.

I mean not taking advantage of the dungeon layer mechanic would've put me at a disadvantage for not using it yet this sub was fine that everyone who used it was banned. How is this different
---
Same. 4 of us were hyped af for classic. They all know a bunch of people from vanilla and we all rolled on one server in one guild. Numbers have dwindled but us 4 are still logging in nearly every night and running dungeons/elite quests. Been having a blast.
---
Maybe a little lol :)
---
This is why I unsubscribed from Gnome Air Magazine.  
---
You never get what’s advertised, it either looks wrong or blows a hole in my couch!   
---
And I still haven’t gotten my refund!  Working as intended my ass!
---
It literally is. Read the headline

Nothing feels like turning in a bunch of quests and seeing that XP bar get woke AF.

Sounds like a Paladin.

Can I switch between goblin and gnomish engineering or do I have to start back over at 0 to get the other one?

i ran mara twice while leveling, Blackstone and croc boots dropped both times

won ring on first run, boots on second
---
What server you on?
---
Thanks, I'm gonna give this a go. This ret stuff is gettin dry.
---
Yeah usually after one pattern spawns the bag spawns. Some days more than others or so it seems
---
Bruh just unsub dont delete your toon, literally wasted like 6 days minimum.
---
One of the bosses in shadowfang keep drops a blue quality shield that has the same model.
---
It's not the first, I've seen another one, it's honestly just not that good of a weapon. You might be able to get 250g if you can sell it to someone that doesn't realize just how niche it is.
---
SoC mana maintenance is also much more annoying
---
How are these people GM's.. These people are actually getting PAID to be this bad at their job?
---
Loot council can work well, but I think it will struggle in classic because of amount of loot dropped and raid sizes. I personally used loot council and was an officer in the loot council discussion in tbc and wrath. Loot council felt much better for the general guild members in wrath than tbc. We did 10 man in wrath and had a fairly wide class distribution. In tbc many more people were left upset with decisions I think partially because there were just more people affected in 25 man raids.
---
I was fortunate enuff to have a loot council that often prioritized the least geared players so our progression was rather good.
---
Bottom line there isn't a lot of loot dropped in 40 mans in classic, and there is a lot of competition for good gear. Without clear explanations of their decisions it is always gonna feel shitty working with that loot council. Regardless of if they are right if it makes you feel shitty leave, if you dont want to leave adjust your expectations of the raids. Managing expectations makes most things more enjoyable.
---
You can definitely slow most elites.
---
Even é? Despite words like "cliché" being fairly common and would rhyme with "niche" without it?
---
I seriously doubt you need to use Alt codes for it, though.
---
What resolution? If say, 4k that could be an issue.
---
Then you enjoyed the game for a year. There aren't many other video games out there that I can play and enjoy for a full year so I'd count it as a win. There are so many games I have sunk countless hours into that I will never play again. Does that mean I wasted my time even though I enjoyed it? This seems like a weird mentality for a video game. It's only worth it if the game never ends?
---
This is what anyone who buys things that are Made in China have been supporting all along. They just didn’t know it until we got social media.
---
That one may be preference. I was just noting that I like it.
---
I'm using Dominos actionbar combined with Lorti UI Classic (for the black borders) quartz casting bar, chatter for simple chat window etc. Minor addons that make the UI cleaner.
---
Also extra deadzone range for Tauren hunters. However, can shoot like 44yards.
---
unfortunately, its a ""fashion'' set. 
---
At some point, its not even close to what dungeon /raid can offer, so for this I just pick whatever was available.
---
I think I had 1 or 2 piece while leveling, probably of the wolf (agi/spi) and of the monkey (agi/sta).
---
But at 60, its only to walk in town and fish.
---
No, it does not. Stop fishing for karma and go back to the political forums. Blizzard has nothing to do with someone being killed in another country and dumped in the ocean. 
---
I highly doubt Blizzard has an SOP on how to effectively kill Hong Kong protestors. They have the right to fight for freedom and should have it. But Blizzard is not the one murdering them.
---
That is the best use case, but even then it's just not very good/worth it at all.
---
That’s a Freudian slip if Ive ever seen one. So you only learned about the Hong Kong protest within the last two days eh? Sorry man some of us have been following this a few months longer than you. Glad you want to voice your opinion, but you should for sure do more than two days of research.
---
Isn't SoC still on a PPM system rather than a probability one like WF?
---
I’ve seen a group of 6 both times I’ve done it.
---
People who downvoted you obviously don't work in a corporate environment.
---
Ah the joys of parenting. Just gotta wait until they're old enough to game with you. I have had to stop all online gaming for now until mine is older too. Keep on keeping on friend!
---
It’s better until you’re hit capped.
---
It reduces the chance of misses and glancing blows.
---
Thanks i'll grind the area's you suggested and hope i get some nice progress
---
S5 did it for me. I could see the threads unraveling.
---
I usually group with others and help them but there are few cases like being busy or having the other player(s) being severly underleveled (I've seen lvl 13s ask for deadmines for example).
---
Some vastly lower level priest got really angry at me for denying his invitation as I didn't need heals and my killspeed was already ridiculous thanks to random onyxia buff. Commencing huge rant about being player of opposite faction(?) and ruining classic.
---
I mean, I don't mind helping with some quests but when I'm grinding with op buff trying to make most of it, I don't want to halve my experience for next to no gains. Then again I later saw this same person being on too high level zone for him wanting people to powerlevel him.
---
It doesn't work well against serious pvpers
---
I'm saying that weapon speed affects proc chance.
---
Soft PPM means there's no hard limit to the procs. It's based on weapon speed. If you use a fast weapon and the stars align you can potentially get a proc off each hit. Or if the game hates you (as it hated me in this combat log entry), the entire 30 seconds I spent autoattacking a yeti it procced only once (out of the average 3.5 times it SHOULD have procced).
---
You are greedy as hell everyone who is there deserves a chance at loot. Bet you are on a loot council yourself. Only thing I could see is maybe gearing up the main tank first. Shit is easy anyway you don’t even need a full raid of 60s to clear everyone is there for loot
---
What's the best way for me to find help with my lvl30 warrior quest (horde -- Azuresong)? Spam public channels? Wait by the quest giver for other folks to show up? I'm lvl36 and finally ground out all the mats necessary to summon the big elite elemental at the end, but I need help to kill it.
---
Blasted Lands
---
I did demons/cultists along the ridge.
---
Or just don't be a baby and roll against the other class so you're not adding to the issue of people not able to find groups for anything because "NO GEAR MINE YOU CAN'T TAKE MY PIXLES" be a fucking man and roll. I've run armory with 4 warriors and a paladin healer that wanted the gear too before. They were all great guys.
---
they broke census last week and all it did was /who comands
---
They can't fix the nature of PvP players.
---
Yeh, TF offhand is BIS for combat rogue, BUT the threat output is through the roof. Even with a badass tank with a TF, they will struggle threat-wise.
---
2/2 in Improved SW:P is decent-ish... but also gets in the way of the 5/5 Spiritual Guidance which is so damn good. Or worse, gets in the way of Divine Spirit which is not only good, but synergies well with SG.
---
Honestly, while it's been a while since I've soloed level 50+ content, but I do know that the level 36-38 content I was doing on my 36 druid took no more than the time of regular SW:P to kill. I'd personally rather a SW:P talent do more damage than additional ticks. Exceptions to this are if you are spreading the DOT love around to several mobs at the same time just like a Warlock Corruptions everything in sight. But I just don't see it's use in one on one engagements since mobs will die sooner than the 18s of the base spell.
---
The decreases  you gain for dodges and parries but doesn't directly translate to hit. After 305 the percentage drop considerably lower and it's not worth stacking. To my knowledge
---
More hit.  
---
Less chances of glancing blows/parry
---
I dont think that is a bug,  pretty sure you just can't crit on absorbs
---
This is much easier as a horde. No one runs deadmines haha
---
As someone who has also gone by Xen in several games, thanks. I can show this off to my friends and they'll believe it.
---
If you have the Cyrillic alphabet you can’t properly communicate with English speakers whereas Germans can easily. Community is a big part of classic, it’s smart not to endanger that by introducing inherent segregation by alphabet.
---
Also what about that racism nonesense?
---
That's reassuring to hear, thanks for replying!
---
That was your first moosteak.
---
no that's a paladin
---
I've had an active sub since day one, but I don't remember when they added LFG nor when they made it start teleporting you. There was a time where it did not, it just organized the groups for you.
---
LFG alone I don't think ruins the community, it has a bigger QoL gain with minimal impact. But, combining Cross Realm battlegroups with LFG ,and adding in teleporting to dungeons, is where it fucked everything up
---
Guild member is probably the best bet.
---
And if nobody can spare 15 min to help you get a huge upgrade, why be in that guild then
---
Dang that is crazy to hear!  I just hit lvl 40 myself last night... Long ways off from 60 but Im so excited for it. It's reassuring to here that, thanks for replying!
---
There's many different types of loot systems, each of which have their pros and cons. You're used to the /roll system from the past, but even that can be problematic. The "fairness" of that system can come down to just pure RNG especially when another class rolls for the same item as you, but gains much less from it than you would, eg. caster leather drops and a hunter rolls on it(yes you, Mr. "I'm an Intelligence" Hunter).
---
Next thing, the inflammatory communications. A lot of people are reacting to that crude language used. For one - yes I agree that the communications could have come across better. And this can leave a bad taste for many. I also acknowledge that there are a lot of WoW players out there(even 15 years later) whose diplomacy skills are lacking and/or they simply don't care to even pretend to be nice.
---
It doesn't automatically make them horrible human beings. But it does mean that their brusque treatment of others can and does reflect badly on more than they think. Moving on.
---
Next, the loot council system. So based on what you said here. There was a non-insignificant amount of discussion on the loot. You weren't privy to all of it, and this example also shows us why our managers/bosses tend to have meetings *only with each other*, behind closed doors. Does it mean they're automatically being shady and doing nefarious things to bring down the peons? No, of course not. They are doing that, because there are topics of discussion which need to be discussed by specific people with specific data, with the right context. So saying that - I likewise cannot say that this guild's loot council had enough contrarians to counter the popular opinions.
---
But I will say that the raid's response is exactly the type of drama that's broken up guilds in the past. Notice the language used "why am I being PUNISHED" etc etc. These people forget very easily that this game, by its very design, is meant to make loot a scarcity. A 40-man raid, aaaaaaaand what do you get to divvy up between 40 people?
---
Welcome to WoW Classic and the way things were 15 years ago. Really - it's the game that forcing us into this very situation, just think about it.
---
Back to the loot council. This system only truly works, when everyone **trusts the leadership**. If you do not trust the leadership, then you cannot be in this guild. You would then need to be in a guild, which manages loot distribution via more traditional tracking systems. It means that for you to be awarded gear, that you would have to do the time, meaning be there consistently, with all consumables, 100% prepared and any and all metrics that the leadership deems necessary for you to gain standing and hence earn gear.
---
So which way do you want to go? It's all up to you. Best of luck!
---
The only raid guilds I've been in where the loot distribution has been poor have used DKP.
---
It needs a load of checks and balances in place so theres DKP decay etc otherwise it's no better than a shitty LC and often times worse.
---
In a flat DKP system someone can raid once or twice a month and eventually be able to rock up to a raid and take look. This does not benefit the guild whatsoever. I say this as someone that regularly passes on loot for other people and I don't even mention it because I don't need a pat on the back for being a considerate player.
---
Makes me feel better about having never jumped on the bandwagon
---
Pay to win, got it.

I thought that too at the time and checked, but I just have the Outlaw Sabre and a Knightly Longsword of the Monkey.

Edit to add that it only happened that 1 time.

Two instances share the same initials and for some reason, you have people in Westfall chat arguing that DM isn't Deadmines, which is incredibly stupid considering the context, since a level 20 in Westfall is certainly not looking for a Dire Maul group.
---
And now this guy who takes exception to Deadmines being called VC, as if I just came up with the idea and comparing it to instances like SFK, which don't share initials with any other instances, asking me if I call it AA...?!
---
Like I swear some times people don't use their brains.

It's going to be a shitshow next week when you have both level ~20s and level ~60s going "LFM DM" in LFG chat.

Eh I don't know about those numbers then, I played Ret through most of vanilla and even with a 3.4 speed weapon (The Untamed Blade) the proc chance felt more like 10-20%
---
why would you help a rogue? you deserve what you got, rogues got enough help from blizz, they dont need yours too.
---
If you click on it, it should tell you. For example, defense lowers enemy chances of critical hits on you.
---
I think it is hit chance. I know when I switch to a weapon I'm several levels beyond I miss a lot.
---
In my experience, if you can just PM someone nearby they'll usually be available to help you for a minute or two.
---
I've had a warrior PM me just as I was running by and we took it down without any trouble.
---
Okay, but how is it cheating? What rules does this break? You know the definition of "cheating," right? Where is it written that you can't do this?
---
5wep skill is 3% hit with that specific wep if it’s equipped.
---
I'm loving my pally but I'm switching back to holy/prot fuck ret lol. Starting to realize SoR might be better than SoC over time because its adding damage with every hit....I don't care about leveling or kill speed. Rarely die as it is now with a shield and the armor bonus talent you become unkillable.

Yer mum

Combat log tells you a lot more than you think it does.  Spy only looks at three things: the combat log, what you're moused over, and what you're targeting.  It'll only warn you about stealthed enemies if it sees the stealth/prowl aura get applied (i.e. it shows up in your combat log).

I mean the true evil of group finder isn't that it automatically pairs the right people together.
---
It's that it:
---
1) Removes all need for human interaction
---
2) Teleports you to the dungeon
---
3) Pairs you up with people cross-realm so that you do not need to care about them as "people" (since you will never see them again)
---
4) Is so insanely efficient that any other way of setting up a group is frowned upon.
---
There is *plenty* of room for addons / systems that do not have such drastic effects on the community. The retail group finder is the most extreme of the extreme.
---
People talk about how horrible the 40s and 50s are but warrior pre-30 for sweeping strikes and 40 for your 31 point talent is the real struggle bus.

I feel the same way about DBM. Sometimes you just need to take the honor system and simply agree not to use it. Some people will but it will at least be a minority.

Depends entirely on build/spec, but Shadow Priests are notoriously tough to beat in PvP.

Ice block will remove debuffs, and Ice Barrier will save you from taking damage, remember to use Coldsnap as well.

I havent played a priest or mage in classic, BUT what I would think to do as a mage here is chain polymorph until you can reset the fight (eat while he's sheeped, wait for the DoT to run out)

From there, just regular burst rotation, stay out of psychic scream range, and CS the heal

even 1 blackout stun ruins your whole day though

Last night in STVietnam I'm playing my 35 lock and have been melting Ally. Come across a 39 Hunter and decide to yolo it. He kills me, I soulstone and get killed again but my dots get him. He then proceeded to kill me three more times lol. Not even mad. Man his pet sure annihilated me.

And the threat you get is more than the damage it gives because of the debuff threat which gives u insane threat, so essentially it's actually worse to use it untill you get a tank with it that can keep up threat enough which probably won't happen for a long time

We want to avoid PvP. Was planning to primarily play duo, but hoping to make some friends along the way. Not sure about end game content yet, figure we'll see how things go. I think we're leaning towards a low-medium population server, just to make things less hectic. NA East time zone.
---
Edit: forgot about faction. Not really sure yet, she's leaning horde though
---
And let's talk about the positives of community impacts of LFG.
---
* 1) Stops people from setting up reserve groups, where they reserve everything good.
---
* 2) Stops people from being meta zombies
---
* 3) Lets rogues and hunters in on the fun
---
Why use recount when you can just look at the combat log yourself? Basically the same argument. It is only presenting data thats already available. It's a QoL addition, like 99% of addons.
---
Not 100% sure but I think it would just be whichever Horde faction you have at highest rep and farm cloth for it, if you don't care about wolf/skele/raptor
---
I played holy in Vanilla, refused to touch Ret. I was also on an RP server, so... yeah.
---
TBC I played a retpally hordeside, Seal of Blood was just so good.
---
Generally your loot council has: Guild Leader, Raid Leader, Class/Role leaders in it. The Guild Leader isn’t in charge of tracking what everyone has donated, he’s more like a general manager (finances and such.) In our guild, the Role Leader tracks everyone’s gear profession and effort. For example, you generally pass out Heads of Onyxia to melee and hunter  DPS first, as the necklace is amazing for a long time. So, the Melee DPS and Ranged DPS class leaders talk it over with some contribution from the other leaders and you hand out the Head of Onyxia accordingly. The Raid Leader only chimes in if someone is fucking up encounters regularly, and the Guild Leader only chimes in if there are behavioral problems, at least for us.
---
Just gotta get that Savory Deviate Delight
---
Yeah definitely haha
---
Why don’t you run sm cath to get the shield? Drop rate isn’t bad
---
I actually use it to see who’s nearby to kill.
---
Sure, but the Druid tank we had yesterday took 33% more damage than the Warrior, which wasn't really an issue, but P2-P3 threat isn't much of an issue either if people are using the right strategy, ie.: stop damage (especially DoTs) before Onyxia lands for P3 and whoever grabs aggro take her to north (and die there if they're not a tank) while tanks grab aggro back, before everyone resume doing damage on her.
---
Also, if the Druid Tank gets targeted by one of Ony's Fireballs, he'll drop all his aggro, so having a Druid tank build aggro during P2 isn't really a very reliable strategy, but not a bad one, either...
---
I might have turned out different if I was another class but people really hate rogues. Eventually the quiet kid in class blows up and everyone goes "wow he's a psycho" or "wow fuck him". Meanwhile I'm the kid getting shit on left and right lol. People dismounting just to kill me while waving at other classes nearby. Reap what you sow alliance.
---
If you rolled on "Deviate Delight," I think you were appropriately warned.

I can't think of anything with a particular edge. What's your highest rep outside Tauren?

Don't bother all they care about is spell cast damage at level 1.

They can't wrap their heads around the fact that playing 5 accounts doesn't give you 5x the benefit and has more than 5x the drawbacks.

Imagine hating to see it.

I skipped TBC but came back during the WotLK pre-patch event and it felt AMAZING to play my old Paladin decked out in full Tier 2.  I was an unstoppable twink in AV

Ret was an absolutely joke until TBC
---
From what you have posted, I believe you would be gaining some dps, but losing overall raid dps. Losing true shot is a big deal if you’re not stacked on hunters then the raid might want the buff.
---
oWo
---
You mean from normal to PvE? :)
---
NP, what I found that worked best was to kill the casters surrounding the giant crystals. They have the lowest HP and respawn fairly quickly. It took me around 600 mobs to get from 59-60.
---
&gt; Then 10 seconds later he asks us in /s if we are also doing that quest 
---
Sounds more like a basic player and the OP of this comment exaggerating the story
---
Dagger w/ rockbiter + shield and you can tank some dungeons as well :D
---
You aren't ruthless enough, Rogues don't make this mistake
---
It has a lot of downsides. A friend of mine was playing a tank in a guild with a DKP system, but they really needed healers, so they allowed people a one-time offer to reroll to healer but keep their DKP. 
---
He swapped and suddenly had a massive lead over all the other healers in the group because of it, able to buy literally all the loot that dropped and gear himself up absurdly quick. 
---
And while could be said that's a failure in allowing him to transfer the DKP in the first place, the opposite would have happened had they not allowed it. He would've never won a roll unless all the other healers, who had been there longer and therefore had more banked DKP than a new healer, didn't need the item.
---
In general, even not considering the above example, it has a serious 'rich get richer' problem.
---
Then you have a different spreadsheet for each raid. Problem solved.
---
I've ran some SFK as prot warrior.  I like using the Flame Wrath polearm (dropped by ambassador flamelash in BRD) to AOE down the mobs.  The AOE can proc off sunder / other abilities so I just whirlwind when it's up and then spam abilities to try to get it to proc.  They do have protect magic which can get annoying since they become immune for a bit of time but I can usually kill big groups with the AOE from the weapon.  You could also just do an AOE shield with a shield spike.
---
Gnome=ded

Mage or hunter is best for gold. Mage if you like aoe farming, hunter is great for mining since you can run to nodes and FD mobs off(or trap/pet tank while mining).

---
My guild uses EPGP which is kinda like DKP. We have a loot council that only exists to make sure people get what is deserved (like tank priority items or thunderfury). Our raid leaders are often getting gear last.
---
Have you tried plugging in? Some systems underclock on battery
---
Deleting these with reckless abandon I see. 
---
I agree OP. I’m torn too. I understand that “they have a board, and China is a huge market” and all that shit, but this is simply money&gt;people. It’s tough. Good luck OP. I’m hoping they apologize or something to give me some cover to continue playing this game I love so much. If not, it’s gonna suck...
---
I think I meant to say mithril
---
Druids are awesome and although most raids only want a few druids, if youre good and can earn your spot you will get filles up with gear in no time. Leveling as feral is my recomendation because you can always tank in groups and so effectively. At 60 the order of desirability is probably Resto&gt;Tank&gt;&gt;&gt;boomkin&gt;cat. 
---
Boomkins are super fun but classic itimization and tallent trees sucks for them, but they get more fun in later expansions. 
---
Resto druids are really good healers one you get some gear and learn to down rank your spells and know what to use in what situation. Its more reactive then just straight rotations.
---
As a tank that usually doesn't care about what dps I bring, I actively try to get a shaman in the group, dat WF is just so good for me
---
"Cheating" doesn't have some ironclad definition that's written in stone; it's fairly subjective.
---
If Valve let you pay to wall hack in CS, would that magically make it not cheating just because Valve allowed it?
---
It's a competitive advantage that I think we can both acknowledge wasn't how Blizzard intended the game to be played.  They just don't care because they make more money off of it.
---
I raid in Vanilla as a Shadow Priest. I am brought in to amplify the shadow dmg of Warlocks (3-5 are in the raid sometimes more). I get some loot that no one else wants because well my DPS isn't strong let's be honest. I can off heal and save people via shields (I put points into Shield). Know your class, know your limits and be valuable. I have swapped guilds 3x but now I am in the top guild on the Alliance side of my server because my 1st guild wasn't ready to raid, and my 2nd guild already had full priest and wanted me to go Holy for the 2nd raid group. Try it out but if 10-20 guilds are raiding thats maybe 5-15 spots in raids for Shadow Priest over multiple groups.
---
Maaaaaaan fuck them kids.

---
Holy shit. I have 4d 12h on my priest and i am only lvl 42
---
A lot of people believe items should be awarded on a combination of performance and attendance. If I am a top dps player in my guild and another same class player is bottom constantly then I’m putting in more work and trying harder than they are, even if we both make all raids.
---
I support the support of the support of the support
---
I really enjoy hunter, I got to 25 on mine then thought "I really dont want to invest a lot of time if I'm useless later on"
---
I might say fuck it and level him anyway because I enjoy it. Worst case I have a really good farmer/grinder to funnel to a rogue later.

Your mage can instantly teleport to the capital cities and bind your hearthstone wherever you want. Trust me, its better.
---
He's an asshole because someone pissed him off. Just like he pissed you off and caused you to be an asshole to him.
---
And herein lies the problem. You're out there doing you, having fun. Some dickhead comes along and pisses you off. Now you're in a pissy mood and retaliate against them, and that makes their mood worse. Its a cycle and it sucks. 
---
Be the person who breaks the cycle. Ignore the attention seeker, because that's what they want, your attention. Deny them that.  We've all been screwed in this game at one point or another and it does indeed suck to have your efforts wasted all for someone's shits and giggles. THAT's when you know you're dealing with crazy.  You can't fight crazy, you know this.

And then you wake up. 😂

---
Yeah, people can kick you after /inspect. But at that point, you're in the group with (I hope) other people, and the lead has to admit to being a jerk and kicking you for your gear, leading to the additional wait of the rest of the party members.
---
Refusing to invite ≠ kicking once you're at the instance.
---
Shadow priest and lock will be tough to beat unless you really out play them. You gotta use ice block to clear the dots. Engineering shadow reflector will help a lot too.

The real crime with the 2H Shaman spec is if you respec you lose your weapon skills

One very good option at your level is the 2h axe from the murloc boss in BFD --
---
Honestly geared skilled tanks are so in demand I would just reserve anything you want (meaning master loot to yourself after announcing it at the start of the run) and if the rogues don’t like it they can go find their own group.  Plenty of casters and healers that will gladly come to your group.
---
Nah but I *would* point out publicly that it was a circle rather than a square. For rightness points, you know.
---
Instant karma
---
They didn't /y AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Bosses often can't be slowed.  Elites are different, and most can be.
---
I say this all the time to that response:
---
If you couldn’t trust your guild leadership with loot council, why would you choose to raid with that guild? If someone wants to abuse a system DKP won’t stop them.
---
Retail gets a ton of hate, yet somehow retail guilds run loot council pretty much exclusively. If classic really is about the community, why is there always so much bullshit surrounding loot?
---
Sure, some consideration needs to be given to veteran players. But good luck keeping new players in the same spec who realize that they won't be able to win anything in a new tier for a minimum of 10 weeks after joining due to how much dkp the veteran has banked.
---
Rich get richer systems that promote gerontocracies are insanely hostile to new players joining. They'll slowly but surely kill raid groups, since the outgoing players will always outnumber incoming ones.

Yeah true, true. But wouldn't then the problem be to actually get to you? Assuming you are boxing with 5 or more chars, you'll more or less oneshot me the second I come out in the open. And only locks and priests can aoe fear, both need to be in "melee" for it to happen. I guess if you can fool a boxer into melee range by los'ing then it would work.
---
But yeah, you are definitely right, a AoE fear would prolly screw up the boxers majorly.

See, the great part of the free world is that the rest of are free to compartmentalize things. If all of us want to keep politics out of a gaming forum, we can. If the company wants to keep politics out of it's official gaming events, it can. If the player is incapable of following the event rules he clearly is aware of, then he too can pay the consequences for such.
---
Freedom!
---
Also, you ignorant !@#$%, Hong Kong IS in China. It's a separate administrative zone with some unique laws, but it's still Chinese, it's citizens are still mostly Chinese. So claiming you're fighting for the rights of Hong Kong citizens but then snubbing your nose at those Chinese on the mainland that are still in fact much worse off than the HK Chinese just shows you don't give a rats ass about human rights and are only jumping on this bandwagon because you thrive on internet outrage, just like every other white knight wannabe out there. Maybe do some fucking research about the shit mainland Chinese are forced to deal with under Winnie the Pooh's autocratic social monitoring police state before talking out your ass!
---
I care about what's happening in Hong Kong. And I read the news and discuss politics with friends. On gaming forums that have a strict no politics rule, letting even one thing slide sets precedence that everyone thereafter gets to abuse. THAT is why these threads get locked. Otherwise, everyone and their mothers will use the opportunity to spam political messages when the next anywhere in the world elections come about. That's the consequences that comes from allowing politics into a gaming forum.
---
Don't like the rules on this subreddit? Then leave and go somewhere where those two mix as you'd like. That's YOUR freedom to choose.
---
Please make your point without the insults political references. Thanks.

&gt;Ive gone full gatherer and picked mining and herbalism. Is there any tips and tricks i should be aware of along the way? 
---
It's going to be a little bit difficult because both Mining and Hebalism cannot be tracked at the same time, it might be worth adding your "Find Minerals" or "Find Herbs" abilities to your hotbar and swap between the two.
---
I find the mining nodes are more likely to be found near mountainous/rocky areas, so areas like Badlands/Blasted Lands/Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes are great for mining. Caves will generally always have a few node spawns. 
---
Herbs are a bit difference since they can spawn pretty much anywhere, some herbs spawn in specific places so it may be useful to farm those if you need to.
---
Ah okay, I will download that straight away!

You can't open a chest while in combat, I'm assuming that's problem one. Problem two is that opening the chest actually generates aggro outside your passive aggro range, knocking you into combat.
---
There's no real workarounds I've found. You need to kill them.
---
King’s honor, friend.

Try drop the dummy, vanish, then loot the chest.

you hold down right click and move. Obviously only works if you're not a clicker as well

These names will typically add a few different combinations to them, here a few off the top of my head. All of these runs will give good XP for you aside from straight Arena runs.
---
-FULL QUEST: Obviously a full run killing everything in BRD (this will take well over an hour, plan accordingly)
---
-ARENA XP FARM: Usually lower lvl 50s run these with multiple mages. They clear the large first room and around the sides and end up at the Arena and then reset.
---
-ARENA ONLY: Very fast runs usually consisting of lvl 60 chars. Usually casters looking for Ring/Belt and Warriors/Shams looking for epic chest from arena
---
-ARENA/ANGERFORGE: The same as above but they add in angerforge for hand of justice.
---
-ARENA/ANGERFORGE/GOLEM: Same as above but they kill Golem lord for tank ring or healer trinket.
---
-SAVE THE PRINCESS: These runs will not killt he princess at the end for a quest.
---
-LAVA RUN: These runs will jump down to lord Incendius and jump down further from there to hop over to just after the 7 Dwarf event. From here you can get MC attun,use forge, or hardskip to Emperor. People do this when they only need loot from the end.
---
-RELIC COFFER/STILGRISS: This run will include a trip around the arena and over to Warder Stillgriss' room, people who run this typically need the frost damage shoulders or items for libram enchants.
---
-BAR RUN: Typically this run will include all bosses on the way to the Bar area of BRD and will stop there....players who need the Helm from ribbly/Phalanx or the Dagger/chest from Plugger do these.
---
-7 RUN/7 DWARVES RUN: Same as above but will go two bosses further to end at the 7 dwarves. Typically done for healing mace and leather helm.
---
Again people will use combinations of these, so you might get.
---
QUEST/SAVE PRINCESS
---
LAVA SAVE PRINCESS
---
and things like that. Happy BRDing!

Night Elf males are pretty ripped, and your side literally has walking skeletons.

I'm an officer in a guild that's still building its core playerbase and we pug a lot of our raid still.  Unfortunately we've had a guilded mage win like 4 items where the rest of our mages dont really have anything.  Hard to move to DKP since we have about 10-15 pugs per raid still.  Ultimately we may just need to bite the bullet a couple more weeks and hope some other guild members get lucky.
---
For your own sake, turn on the extra action bars and set some more keybinds. Warrior is impossible with only the 3 you get by default with your stances. 
---
Interface Options -&gt; ActionBars to turn on the extras. Key Bindings -&gt; Action Bars to bind them. Unlike your main bar there, the new bars will be static as you switch stances, which makes them perfect for macros, important cooldowns to keep track of, or just abilities that don't have a stance requirement or are otherwise somewhat rarely used.
---
Alternately, get an action bar addon instead. Either way, you need more button slots.
---
First appeared in WotLK and it’s just like you said: it was matchmaking only. You still had to truck your ass to the instance, however, by that time, meeting stone summons were also a thing and they require only 2 participants instead of the warlock’s 3. The funny thing is, in-game LFG was added because of the prevalence of LFG addons that did this exact same thing. Many mainline features came to be this way. A lot of the TBC and WotLK QoL improvements were originally addons.
---
I had an UBRS where the following dropped:
---
* Cloudkeeper legplates
---
* Felstriker
---
* Dal rend MH
---
* Finkles Skinner
---
* Pristine hide of the beast
---
* Painweaver band
---
I lost all of them
---
No. See Rule 2.
---
Why? It's not like you can reliably dungeon this way after the early levels. You're getting much less XP, so leveling is actually much slower. The infrastructure required is a huge pain in the ass. It costs a lot of money. The only instance in which this is an advantage is in open world PvP. It sucks major ass in BG's. And if you run into this in the open world, it's no different than running into five people. I don't see the frustration. It is what it is. If it was "cheating," it wouldn't be allowed. Pay for five accounts, get five accounts lmao  
---
EDIT: And it is actually different than running into five people because multi-boxes can only perform the same action.
---
Pretty sure they fixed this? You should have the same skill when you go enhance again
---
The standard is for the organizing guild to reserve. As long as the loot rules were made clear no one has any right being upset over it.
---
You mean 1 horde vs 4 alliance, right? Because I've never been in a fair fight against an ally scum.
---
I hit 60 on my rogue and I'm tempted to make a warlock. I played one in BC and really enjoyed it.
---
I mained feral in vanilla and fell in love with the feral playstyle, it was my main spec thru WOTLK until I quit.
---
This time around I rolled warrior, and HOLY SHIT is it amazing. This is what a melee class should be.
---
Thanks , so you know how many levels starts to make a big difference ?
---
Why would a guild do that in a run with tanks not from a guild tho? It’s better to let rogues roll too so your guild would have a chance of having it instead of randoms. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
The questing zone was added in cataclysm. The raid in caverns of time was added in tbc.
---
Exactly I'm concerned that if we ask him to forego rolling and give him an out to leave he may just quit and we lose all the gear entirely.
---
As a Hunter, you should be rolling on leather gear that is an upgrade for you. Where Hunters get in trouble is rolling against melee classes for melee weapons. If you compare a Rogue's pre-raid BiS list to a Hunter, you will see a lot of overlap. There just isn't enough good mail gear for Hunters at this point.
---
I forgot to mention I tried that as well.
---
Tell us what's not gross, Littlekidlover.
---
You want real, three piece wheels? That's about $5000... ouch.
---
You are now banned from entering China
---
No idea about how it currently works actually
---
If you somehow  both had identical skill levels and gear, the level 20 would have some passive stats gained during the leveling process, better skills available, and more talents.
---
Ninja edit- but I think the level 10 reduction at 100 armor would show higher on the stat sheet (because they'd reduce a higher % of level 10 enemy damage than a level 20 would reduce on a level 20). And a level 10 would have a horrible chance of hitting a level 20 mob.
---
But people with tons of dkp usually are decked out.
---
I joined a raid in AQ as a fresh 60, and most people of my class didnt need anything so I won items even tho I had 0 dkp. Its not that bad.
---
I used to play on a RP server. There’s zero expectation that you RP 100% of the time. If somebody initiated a conversation in ‘RP speak’ I’d usually respond in kind. Otherwise it’s just a normal conversation.
---
Healers don't need to worry about using abilities on mobs.  
---
With a tank that you know, they can control the pull and you just have to be aware of where you are.
---
I have my preist buddy /afk on the side of roads while I wait in stealth.
---
you most likely are not playing PvP then
---
Ontop of all the other comments remember some quests require other quests to be finished first. Even though a place may have 2 quest givers that could turn into several more quests.
---
I'm not sure the formulas involved, but your specific armor level is calculated in your character sheet against enemies of the same level. So if you're level 10 and you have 25% damage reduction, a level 10 mob will deal 25% less damage. A level 9 mob will deal even less damage and a level 11 mob will bypass some of your damage reduction.
---
Thank you :)
---
This. Joana's will literally hold your hand through everything...it even organizes your killing and turn ins for you to make it the most efficient
---
But they also have hitboxes twice the size, so a melee class fighting them would in effect also have 2x the melee range.
---
Itemization, talents, class balance, and raid/dungeon encounter difficulties are all drastically different in 1.12 than they were in 1.1 and onwards. The kinds of things you can do now (like killing rag before he submerges in a group wearing greens) were not possible back then.
---
Do you have a source for this information?
---
I want my facts straight if I'm going to tell this to other people.
---
You need to open a new ticket with the "problem with purchase" option so you can get a live chat. Opening regular tickets is a waste of time.
---
large *female* dwarf
---
Ah! Well shit that is actually my bad as I mis-interpreted what you had meant. I read it as "Item drops, I ask if I can roll on it, if they say no, I do it anyway." Where as what you meant was you tell the party before going there "Listen my dudes. I'ma be rolling on dps gear." Alright yup no issues. 
---
Okay that last part sounded sarcastic but no I'm actually cool with that. Sorry for getting that wrong!
---
how do you say your name??
---
People saying hunter "drop off" are simply misleading. Hunters simply do not scale constantly like most other classes; their power spikes come from a few important gear thresholds. These being, in order, Rhok, 8/8 T1, Ashjre'thul, 8/8 T2. The power spike with Ash out of BWL is massive. The problem with this is that the next upgrade after that is the crossbow out of Naxxramas. Which basically leaves denies you any major power increaes for two entire tiers.
---
As a fellow 60 clearing content since week 4. Can confirm, we want it to last.
---
Grats man! So cool 😎
---
A FELLOW MEMBER OF THE TRIBE! Have you migrated over to the other guild yet?
---
Lol me and my guild buddies were running through here for the ony attunement (horde) and we killed 1 caster and it dropped the pattern i was the only tailor and got it wasn't until the following week i learned how rare it was.
---
I agree with this mentality. Except when savage chain/HoJ drops. Better believe I’m going to need roll on both of those.
---
I'd 30v1 you with my bois any day kid. Just lmk.
---
   ^^^^/s?
---
Hey there! I was curious if you ever had any luck using the in game voice chat with classic. I'm hoping to avoid downloading discord myself.
---
I only played for a short time before the Dungeon Finder teleported you to whatever place you were queued for, so what's the  maximum distance from the dungeon entrance that is considered acceptable when looking for a group? What I liked about the Dungeon Finder was that I could continue questing anywhere while trying to get in a group. But I'm a huntard that no one really wants in the first place, so I feel like I need to just loiter around the entrance and wait 20 minutes to find a group that needs my kind of DPS. I'm not really doing any dungeons because of that. Ugh, that's what I get for choosing no queues at launch.
---
First time I leveled to 60 I did it without questie, and i dont think I'll ever do it again. Too much time wasted being too high not being able to find stuff
---
Yeah I have no desire to pvp in a situation where my opponent likely has been at it for years already
---
Grind a lvl or two. Go to dungeons, scarlet monastery gy and lib runs
---
I see it more of a bad communication than an instant branding of the guild leadership as bad. By this point we've seen plenty of good people but with horrible communication skills, and of course vice versa, the silver-tongued likeable charlatans.
---
Anyways I've been through different variants of the loot distribution, the truth is that the game makes the loot table very small for a very large group of people. This results in the drama and these systems formed to make some sense of all this. Also not to mention that humans have their own perceptions of what's fair and what isn't. Now make that 40 people and oohhhh boy.
---
Anyways Loot council, only really works if it's a trusted group of friends but with strangers probably not.
---

---
Mage!
---
I'm Alliance, too. I think the shield would still be kinda big for a night elf. Shield Wall would gain a whole new meaning.
---
My first interpretation was that it was an immediate back-stab, but maybe I've just been on this subreddit too long.
---
The gold you make at 60 is SUBSTANTIALLY higher than the gold you'll make around 30-40. Like it's not even comparable. Same for 40-50 and then 50-60. You'll make enough gold as you level and I would just focus on leveling.
---
Very much was so during the emmys
---
Yetis doesnt have pockets
---
&gt; And if you run into this in the open world, it's no different than running into five people.
---
It's "no different" except for the fact that you're running into one actual IRL person as opposed to five real people.
---
To get a group of five you have to get four other people to work with you and coordinate in a group.  
---
The multiboxer has to do none of that.  He is already five people by himself.
---
I understand it's not a perfect 5x strength modifier and that there are drawbacks.  It doesn't change the fact that it's significantly stronger than just having one character, and all it takes to get there is paying more.
---
How is this better than Eye of Org for lock?!
---
Also you're likely already running a ton of BRD Arena for Belt anyways.
---
So half of them died in the attempt.
---
True, I've noticed some of the items it suggests really aren't the best and have incorrect enchant recommendations, but it gives me a good jumping off point to items I didn't know existed.
---
Just tell them you are rolling on DPS gear and/or reserve items if you are making the group yourself. As a tank, you hold all the cards here. DPS are a dime a dozen but I've seen groups wait 30+ minutes for a willing tank.
---
I’d recommend not doing a low or medium population server. It’s possible the population could drop off over the next few months and low servers could be hurt by that. Most of the high populated servers shouldn’t be too hyper populated anyways in the first 1-30 zones . Plus seeing other adventurers about makes the world feel more alive
---
The bears and bulwark will fucking destroy you. Swimming the lake is lame, but the best way.
---
That sounds like a pretty great idea for an RP server. Sadly that would require me to level to 56 on an RP server and I'm not even 42 on my main.
---
How quickly people forget about The Legend of Honrar...
---
Thanks! Any class combos you recommend? I'll play anything, planning to pick around her, but she's undecided still.
---
To quote World of Roguecraft:  
---
"Rogues don't scale with gear, dumbass!! Eviscerate has **static damage**."  
---
Eviscerate does the same damage with a Worn Dagger or Andonisus, Reaper of Souls.  
---
Hunter scaling issue arise from the fact that the weapons don't scale as much due to the ammo not scaling.  
---
Thorium bullets/shells will be your ammo until TBC drops.   
---
The Nerubian Slavemaker is only 57 DPS.  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22812/nerubian-slavemaker  
---
77 DPS with Doomshot  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12654/doomshot  
---
Gressil, Dawn of Ruin is 73 DPS by itself and benefits from Human and Rogue Sword Specialization and WF totem if you are Horde.  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23054/gressil-dawn-of-ruin  
---
Warlocks are kinda gimped early on due to no +hit in talents and sbolt crits making threat very spiky. 
---
That is why the Warrior, Rogue, Mage DPS trinity is here.  
---
Rogues scale for everything but Eviscerate.  
---
Warriors are unstoppable killing machines.  
---
Mages still kick ass while playing gimped Frost in MC.
---
It's not that bad for old content, which is why I specifically called out a new tier. Raid groups see the most volatility in membership between tiers. That's great that you were able to win AQ stuff with 0 dkp, but what if you stuck with that group and went on to Naxx? By the time the people who had been there forever ran out of dkp, TBC would've been out and you would've never once seen a single Naxx drop.
---
Also, if the group makes you spend your dkp on those drops that nobody wants, you're even further hurt as a new joiner, because what little dkp you do have goes to stuff that would've been vendored or disenchanted anyway had you not been there. Meaning you wouldn't even get a chance to begin building enough to see an item.
---
Further to what everyone else has said, your chance to hit mobs increases as you level (due to increased cap on weapon skill). Thus, generating more threat for you to keep aggro.
---
It's worse than that.  I had an other-faction fight going on which I wasn't involved in and wasn't in combat, and when I tried to open a box it told me I was in combat.  I vanished and tried again and still couldn't open it.
---
tl;dr-You can't open shit if any form of combat is happening around you.
---
There's the missed Brazzers comment.
---
Hey man, I just want to let women know where my priorities are.
---
Our guild is in a bit of an odd spot, we ended up having a vote about loot distribution and it ended in LC which was weirdly supported by mostly fresh recruits whereas the initial people wanted DKP and next to nobody wanted pure rolls.  
---
Cue into hectic management of spreadsheets and trying to make things fair in a system half the people have little experience with. But despite all that we've had very few complaints and people even actively stepping up to pass loot to others and discussing what pieces they are after the most, it has made surprisingly good atmosphere.
---
Rofl
---
Yes, because of threat levels and new abilities you get as well as the damage increase you naturally get from leveling. 
---
Put it this way:
---
A level 10 fighting a level 15 mob with no armor or weapon, just punching away, would be constantly missing. That’s because the weapon skill, even maxed out at level 10, isn’t high enough to consistently hit the mob. 
---
A level 20 fighting a level 15 mob under the same circumstances still has more + strength attributes due to being the level they are, and their weapon skills would be higher than required to hit the mob almost every time.  
---
Lets not forget the health a lvl 10 tank would have  (or lack thereof) compared to lvl 20, because stamina also increases with level.
---
Or they don't want to deal with the stress and pressure of tanking.  It is not easy when you are doing it with pugs, and can be more frustrating than its worth.
---
especially if you are an inexperienced tank.
---
I would still go for a higher population server... with just two of you you'll at least want enough people to group for Elite quests and dungeon runs as you level up.  IF you go with a low population server you might risk not being able to find a group when you want to knock out a dungeon to finish your quests for it.
---
Where is a good place to level fishing from 180-225 (horde)?
---
There is no honour in defending the enemy. Do your duty and kill a gnome today!
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
you'll enjoy the game a lot more playing something you enjoy and want to play, so go for it.  You'll never be useless, you just won't scale as well as some other DPS classes.  You still do things others cant and keep in mind most of the people playing wow are NOT the hardcore players so they won't get into that crazy gear for a long time anyways.
---
Is it worth getting to 60? For me yes. For you? Only you can decide. 
---
Will the game be around in 1-2 years? Probably. No one can tell you for certain. It may be a lot less popular. People may quit. But enough enjoy it that it is unlikely to shut down. Yes, it may stay very popular or it may not. 
---
Will the game be around in 2++ years? Probably. But how active it will be is questionable. It will depend on their plans post phase 6 and how players react to it. Do they go with re-releases of new expansions? No changes at all? Or a Classic plus experience? We don’t know right now, so your guess is as good as mine. 
---
You never know how healthy MMOs will be years from now. Some MMOs fail soon after launch. Bless is a great example of this. Other MMOs survive for decades. Retail WoW is a good example of this. Given how active the classic servers are and how much interest it has garnered, I think WoW Classic will be healthy for the next 2+ years. More than that? Who knows. It will depend on what Blizzard does with content.
---
Or hippogryphs in feralas
---
Free Action and then I'd try to Fear and MC that guy. To me thats your best chance. You could even try to bait a kick out of the rogue. Mage's would do this crap to me all the time back in Vanilla. They'd fake cast a spell, I'd kick em and then they'd rip right into me.
---
Well aren't you adorable, still farming for your epic mount?
---
Lava Runs: When emperor is dropping HoJ again (when it's no longer angerforge) and people are just farming Emporer.
---
Full Runs need a distinction between killing or saving the princess.
---
Yeah you really need some good friends for that. Mine could have easily outleveled me, but they chose to go fishing or cooking instead for me to catch up. And to go questing in areas where most quests were green or white to them while they were orange to me.
---
Desk lotion spotted 😏
---
If I made a YouTube video about my gold making then I wouldn't make as much gold tho
---
Could you explain how you got this working? Can't find info on it anywhere and mods deleting all the responses to your questions.
---
IIRC it's possible to get under Org. I haven't tried it in current classic but I did it in old classic.
---
Priest or druid is your best bet.
---
If your wife can handle the CC, some kind of healer would really round you two out.
---
Priest brings a lot to the table, strong heals, damage over time, another form of hard CC (point blank aoe fear). Druid of course has heals, can go bear and tank things, has their own CC through bear stun, and roots.
---
One of those two should really help the fast leveling!
---
I was pvping in SW last night and got attacked by what I thought was a guard. I was like “since when did SW guards hey HoJ??”
---
The overall behavior where I think logically and make sound arguments?
---
Paying for additional characters makes you as one individual player stronger than other individual players.
---
That makes it pay-to-win.  There's nothing left to discuss.  Go home.
---
Paid 25 for mine. Got it on the first run
---
Will be doing that for sure! I don’t dis believe you can’t say I am the most attentive I just have never seen it mention stealth. I also didn’t know there was additional settings so I will definitely look into that! But it for sure says stealth player nearby or something along those lines! Maybe that does show in the combat log somewhere?
---
You can use a group to do some things but if anyone else is on the agro table for the demon it will reset and sometimes despawn. Including put pets
---
Make sure you go into the combat log settings and turn on all the checkboxes, if you haven't already.  Most stuff is off by default.
---
Lol , none of you was deemde worthy😅😂
---
Not orcs
---
Disgusting. Trolls I mean. Yuck. Nice art tho!
---
Its basically E.T. + a vampire.
---
It says 100 hours in the damn thread title.
---
You are the one that could use some re-education here, because it clearly says he only had help for 5 hours, not that this was all accumulated in 5 hours.
---
But whats the difference between using all your dkp on 1 bis item and joining the guild? You are at 0 afterwards in both cases and are fucked for other items. You can make dkp pretty fast if you always show up and follow the DKP rules. Its not only the new people who get low dkp, its the people who spend it, its also a rotational system. I mean guilds give DKP how they see fit, so maybe they can even give starting DKP to high geared people from other guilds as a ginvite incentive. Its malleable.
---
Is it that bad also that somebody who always showed up for raid since the beginning has a lot of dkp and gets gear first... I dont see it badly.
---
I'm gonna need to you to Xfer over to Kromcrush and be in my grp till I get HoJ from Angerforge and Savage Chain Chest from Arena....kay thanks.
---
No its not.
---
Tauren is the best Horde race, Dwarves are the best Alliance race, and I don't think it's even close in either case.
---
1) You generally want to kill elite mobs ASAP and spike them down hard. Stopping the DPS and letting the priest finish him off is not easy. On top of that, there will likely be other DOTs on that mob and there's no guarantee you'll get the kill credit.
---
2) Good luck with actually explaining that to your DPS. They'll read the chat AFTER the mobs are dead. Or not read it at all, lol.
---
Spirit Tap is great for soloing. One of the best first tier talents in the game. Just don't depend on it when grouped up.
---
They don't always! Sometimes they 1v3 at level 60 against lowbies!
---
What logically sound argument have you made?
---
Spell cast damage doesn't mean you're stronger, it just means you do more damage.  You also take more damage.
---
This isn't math equations, it's an MMO.
---
If one person playing 5 accounts is pay to win then 5 people grouping is pay to win.  They are paying 5x for 5x the characters.  Zero difference.
---
As a healer I've been looking for an addon like this for my own faction. Thanks.
---
Stupid Ali Express.

It is called VC!

Yes it could work in boot camp. Ive done this with a non-mac supported card before.
---
His last post he States that he did it in 5 hours. That's what I'm referring to. You might wanna see the big picture before looking like a jackass?
---
Oh man that patch was amazing for Ret pallys. I remember soloing Zul Farak at level 45, just absolutely destroying everything. Never felt so overpowered in all of wow.
---
*Curb Your Enthusiasm theme starts to play*
---
If you're in a low level zone and see a high level character, they're there to gank people. World of Warcraft literally gives players zero reason to be in level inappropriate zones other than working on professions that you let fall behind. Higher level zones are just far more rewarding.
---
This is my experience at least. In all my years of playing WoW, I've never seen a high level come to a zone and advertise that they're helping people. If you see one, they're up to no good.
---
Tank here. Yes
---
Yeah I use it too and that’s the first shit I turned off lol.
---
One dude trying to wrangle 5 characters will rarely be as aware of the area as 2+ folks being situationally aware. Like most of classic you have to focus on the weaknesses and against a team have a team that can counter.

ROFL!  I feel that pain!
---
I would have said in chat: “Wow!  This is going to make me play this alt more now!”.
---
there wasnt xp from bgs back in the day
---
You are the type of player i love playing with, your willingness to fill a roll you may not be comfortable with, accepting you can improve and sitting back and learning for someone who might be able to show you a couple tips/tricks, 
---
too bad you went horde :)
---
Hate me, I got it at lvl 54. I think that used up all my luck though, haven't won shit since then.
---
So its closer to 10sp = 1% crit = 60 int.   The 6 int number was equivalent to 1sp.
---
This is a nono. The dps warrior in your group that hates tanking and only wants to play a dps role will lose a dps weapon roll to a prot warrior building his dps set? This is unfair. Main spec should not have equal priority as off-spec for drops.
---
I actually did a lot of these things when vanilla was current, because I ran addon-less. Never got into addons back then.
---
Parsing shows hunter at 73% of max DPS in Naxx, but keep in mind mage damage hugely spikes in Naxx (they out DPS warriors in Naxx). 
---
For reference, hybrid classes like spriest, feral, etc. dont even get to 60% of max DPS and enhance and boomkin are around 35% of max DPS.
---
In comparison, Warlocks have the reverse issue (low DMG early and high later on). In Naxx warlocks do around 85% of max DPSx but in MC they do 50%.
---
Hunters are really great DPS, dont let anyone tell you different.
---
Lmfao at having your feelings hurt so badly by someone accurately making fun of your childish personality that you literally went and tattled, hahaha.  Enjoy having a life so simple and uninteresting that you can get your feelings hurt by a stranger online so bad that you'll literally throw a tantrum and call an adult over it.  I can't imagine being so boring and having so little to think about that I spent my time the way you do.
---
Not all horde are bad mmkay i helped an low level alliance party kill 2 elites in stv and they thanked me.
---
It's a bullshit addon that eliminates the whole purpose of an entire fucking class. Are you defending this?

Which is probably very limited indeed 😂

Thanks I'll give it a shot over the next couple of days :)

No, I'm saying that even when you know about this, you won't contribute anything other than leaving comments on the internet. You fake care about this. You will not be proactive in the slightest towards this cause, as with most people. that's what I'm pointing out, but go ahead, leave a Reddit comment and pretend like you're changing the world.

As someone who used to play Alliance and currently plays Horde, there is no better feeling in WoW than watching a bunch of orcs pop their racial cooldowns on you only to watch you bubble and then hearth away while they furiously try to break through the immovable object that is Divine Shield.
---
Let your memes be real, friend.
---
Going to file a complaint to blizzard to fucking ban it. It's retarded.
---
Wherever is fine.   There’s always someone who is on another continent and misses the zepplin.   Just if you’re going to be the last one there AND need a bio break before you’re ready to go, tell us ... so those of us who are early can extend our own break.
---
Get in early with joining the team btw.   As a tank, starting a group I usually only get one or two dps bites at first, then a wave of whispers after I find a healer and announce we’re just looking for one more dps.
---
Ah, so it’s nails,screws,duck tape, whatever’s within reach basically. 
---
,)
---
Why not program a little window that pops up separately telling you something specific did something?  It's the same thing but more customized to your liking.
---
If that's what people want to do with their money and time so be it, I personally see no joy out of doing the above, but I do get it from killing them, it's as if life is subjective and some people enjoy other things. Look I'm no monster, in fact this post also helps those that are getting sniped get less sniped tremendously. 
---
It's more petty to think less of people because of the above then it is to actually be one of the people like you mentioned above. Let that sink in.
---
I mean for all we know, you could've killed an alliance member and stole their shield.
---
What are everyone's thoughts about bringing arenas to classic? Just for speculation purposes, do y'all think Blizzard would reintroduce them in much later phase? Arenas made their debut during TBC, and was easily my favorite aspect of the game. Would y'all like to see it implemented in classic? Or just stick to battle grounds for structured PvP?
---
Watch out for my mage Portalthot
---
He wasn’t really “high level” so I didn’t think anything of it. I’m 37, he was either the same level or maybe 38 - I probably could have won if I didn’t get jumped when I was less than 1/4 health from dealing with the mob that spawned on him. I usually steer clear of horde I see lurking around that are obviously just there to gank, but I’ve helped out several horde players while questing and a few have helped me so I didn’t think much of helping him at the time haha.
---
I’m soft, but rogues are making me want to murder.
---
I had some PVP the other day but sadly it always ends with a lvl 60 horde Rogue ruining the low lvl PVP, I get it, horde rogues can't kill people their lvl but come on
---
Go tank. Mention you're rolling on DPS gear.
---
That ring dropped my 2nd Mara run lol. Gratz man
---
Haha it’s the level 60s of alliance are smart on my server. They never go out in groups less than 3. So I gotta lore them out by killing their level 15 Alts in RR
---
why would you take the time to do any research on a topic when you can just type a question on reddit and expect people who already took the time or effort to learn just give you the answer?
---
Warlocks have some of the most skills to buy, they pay for pet spells at the same cost of their spells, and they have no other speed increases inherit to the class. No sprint, blink, travel form, etc
---
I think what he means is that what is being registered exactly in your combat log when someone flies over your head while taking a FP? They can’t cast spells or act while flying so if spells/auras/damage/crafting are what get seen then how do they show up? I’ve wondered this myself.
---
You’re lucky it was just ice cream you had to say goodbye to 😳 I had a similar experience when I was younger, count yer blessings.
---
Got my Warrior to 24 and its already popping off!
---
Yep, seconding this as a Rogue. I wish we didn't share so much loot but that's Classic WOW. You're fine rolling on leather no matter how much I hate it.
---
Gotta buy it again bud.
---
we can solo princess!?
---
I suppose being tall in basketball is cheating then, eh?
---
welp.... *\*unzips\**
---
I agree. I think the problem is that a lot of guilds that try it aren't thinking about overall raid DPS when making decisions about who gets what. Certainly attendance and contribution are a factor, but officers shouldn't be giving themselves drops when an upgrade could be of overall greater significance to the raid in someone else's hands (puts a dps at hit cap for example vs adding a couple strength to the officer).
---
What can i say. Im a sucker for zombies
---
I’d love to see an example of how nuts this is, don’t think you’ll be proccing it a lot melting faces from 30 yards, plus you can’t be moving when you cast a spell when it’s procced so that makes it even less nuts
---
Easily my favorite, I will say the first 9 episodes drag on a bit but you shouldn't skip them. The anime is called jojo's bizarre adventure
---
I've heard that 1h + shield is mostly when you are facing heavily armored players, like warriors and paladins.  Your physical damage from windfury falls off sharply compared to the damage of the frost or fire weapon buffs.  And no, dropping windfury will not stack with your weapon buff.
---
Question on the quest to save the princess. I've been confused by this, as I don't think I've ever done it successfully before.
---
But my group last night in all honesty, was too low level to kill Thaurissan the proper way. We ended up kiting him across the room, jumping off the ledges and forcing him to chase us back and forth while dots ticked away. Due to this method the princess had to be killed.
---
Everywhere I looked, the quest to save her, seems to start AT her. And all the comments seem to state, so long as she's alive when the Emperor is taken down, then she will "wake up" and give you the quest, at which point you take it to Thrall for completion. Is this correct?
---
And if so, I wonder how, 15 years ago anyone figured out that specific mechanic, to in fact not kill her. Are there hints in the game tell you or hint that she's not to be killed?
---
I've had dps warrior tell me this same thing a lot actually. 
---
I really don't have any gear prejudices when inviting dps, but I will try to form synergies whenever possible. For example as I am forming the group if my first dps is a rogue, then a warrior, then I may try to find a shaman dps or healer specifically so we can have windfury totem. Or if I get a warlock, I might try to find a shadow priest (hard to find these most days T\_T). So while I am not prejudice vs. gear types.... as the group grows I will be more specific about what I want.
---
But i've invited warriors that just straight out thanked me for inviting them cause they suffer from this all the time.
---
Oh :( thanks for the help
---
You can't trade it in, you need to buy again.
---
If I just want to get something up on the wall yeah but for a work of art like this, got to be framed and hanged properly.

Lol no, I love pvping.  I jot down names of cowards that kill me in "unfair" ways.

No they too big. They can ride wolves though. Just like only dwarves and gnomes can ride mechanos

It's not. I didn't say it was. 4th bis is not bis..

Grats! I find the quests that make you travel far and wide to be come of the most satisfying. :D

Pbd is like 5g on my server.

I used to main Horde in vanilla so I speak from experience lol

Fuck solo healing that dragon pack in the corner in the room before the bridge, they hit hard, everything else is pretty easy
---
To be clear, I love Runescape and WoW. But I remember seeing the original video back when in 2006 and thought it was so funny and actually got me to play WoW for the first time.
---
I wish I had someone who wanted pets on my server, I got the hyacinth macaw on my first ever bloodsail kill (extremely lucky) and nobody to sell it to
---
how did u get exalted with SW? i’m trying to do the same :)
---
Fuckin nubs. Its pvp server and you complain. Roll pve then...
---
Anyways.. every second day i gather team of three and we travel up and down and kill everything on sight. After 1h-2h alliance scum logs off.
---
We got our ass spanked few times tho. :) but its fun jumping in front of ally mounted, while two others kill him xD
---
I thought you got some at the end when you win? Someone said that didn't happen until wrath, but I thought I had a twink earlier than that.

It's a quest chain. Starts in ironforge throne room. I dont think princess is who gives you the quest to save her. I think you'll pick up one of the last quests of the chain in IF throne room again and it will say something about saving her from Emperor
---
What if youre also a DPS warrior that sucks it up and tanks dungeons. You know, like the vast majority of warriors that dont play this "im only dps" nonsense when tank positions in 5 man dungeons is in high demand. If you truly only want to dps dont roll a warrior in vanilla.
---
rip
---
Yeah those are the only true Rare mounts in my eyes....mmmmm that ZG tiger. You. Will. Be. Mine!
---
Are you friends with the gm and officers? or are you saying they're friends with each other and you joined in as a random
---
What? Im seeing hardly any hunters and a lot of warlocks on ashbringer
---
Yikes

TL;DR: It happens all the time.
---
Well maybe not if you've been friends for 20 years

B E N E D I C T I O N

This is kind of the mentality I have. Main spec should always take priority over offspec, but if I don't need anything for my main spec and am just running the dungeon for offspec at that point.... when/how does it become ok? Unless I am running friends out of the goodness of my heart... I have the option to go in as my main spec and roll for the off spec stuff I want, or go in as my off spec and roll for that spec.
---
From most feedback here so far,  the prior seems to be fine as long as I let people know in advance and don't just go "SURPRISE needing this for my offspec."
---
lots and lots of questing.
---
Yikes indeed.
---
This, at 55+ a lot of uncommon loot is vendoring for 1g if not more, I set bidding value to right above what a vendor would give me and buyout for a bit more (maybe a lot if the stats are useful). If it doesn't sell I just vendor it cause it doesn't make sense for me to put something that vendors for 4g and put on AH for 50s just for it to not sell multiple times.

I’ve seen some bad shoops, and this is one of them.

There is nothing dishonest about paying for multiple accounts.
---
How in the world do you even reach for that.

I have honor. I don't kill people if I'm ignorant to how they play. You deserved a bloodbath for justice for that Orc Shaman. Or maybe the Orc Shaman deserved it. I don't know, you don't know.
---
Fair fights are the best ones. You improve, your opponent improves, you both have fun. Ganking is just so lame. I've always felt this way and it will never change. I akin it to playing on easy mode.
---
Thank you. Much appreciated!
---
Speaking of HoJ and purple chest, I just won both on my warrior after 5 runs lol
---
Arcanite Reaper hooo, and all that.
---
Nah, that's not how it works.  I've opened chests with a mob in combat right next to it.
---
Leave it to alliance to spawn camp with 30 people, never seen horde do that shit just sayin.

Go post this to /r/politics man

If we’re talking solely dungeons, you shouldn’t need the threat talent period.
---
Mobs/bosses die in dungeons die in under 20-40 sec. in what situation would you possibly need 15% more threat, when by the time the mob is pulled off of you, you just taunt and the boss/mob is dead anyway. 😂
---
Your individual character isn't stronger.  You overall do more damage with 5 characters.  The exact same as if you had 5 players controlling 1 character.
---
There is no difference between 1 person paying for 5 accounts and 5 people paying for 1 account.  The math all stays the same.
---
Trying to argue 5 is more than 1 is absolutely pointless.  5 is 5, regardless who controls it.

First off, these are 40 man raids and we’re at literally the peak number of casual players right now. Not everyone is good. 
---
Second, if they are all good, you’re in a solid guild that will be forced to have a reliable and fair loot council or collapse, things will average out 
---
Third, if you have to ask that question, you’re a long way off being in a guild where everyone is good
---
Crazy. Still haven’t seen the Chromatic Carapace from Gyth in UBRS
---
I'm thinking Mara orange caves, nobody can find there way around in there...
---
Bindings should of definitely went to the main tank of the group. It makes all future runs easier for everyone. But that’s their fault for allowing you to roll. Warriors should have made the loot rules clear from the start if they’re going to bitch.
---
&gt;I don't get why Ret Paladins always get shit for poor DPS, but I've  also never reached level 60.
---
They don't get shit for poor dps, in classic they have shit dps. hehe! We do decent low level dps because everything here is based on melee attack and most classes don' get their big damaging skill abilities right away. Unfortunately ret's never get a big damaging ability. It's just seal , auto attack, judgment, until you run out of mana half way through a raid boss fight.
---
Well yeah, I wouldn't go in with randos if I'm underleveled. Its like asking for someone to make a reddit post about how terrible you are.
---
You managed to get to exalted already, but "need to get 72g again"? Isn't that like, pinching pennies at this point? It takes 8400 runecloth to go from revered to exalted, so even if a stack was just 1g that's still 420g.
---
Druid is definitely easier than Priest but Shaman has a lot of downtime leveling. Totems are very expensive and their dps spells are mana inefficient, and their mp regen is non existent.
---
Priests are just safe since they can stack of the whale gear and don’t need to sit to regen mana.
---
Horde priests also have great racial spells for survivability. Undeads heals and does damage while trolls reduce incoming damage, which are nice perks for leveling.
---
Mods are gonna delete this you know...
---
But before they do, I totally did the same thing and agree with you. Thanks for supporting HK!
---
I assume its just run speed on boots then run around the pillar until evasion is up again and you can go in for some damage, bandages at opportune moments.  
---
Honestly just bring a resto druid friend, so much easier xD
---
Oh dear. I would recommend a different class to you then, friendo
---
Never saw it until the 55th run lol. Still haven’t seen Helm of Valor from Scholo either after 20 something runs
---
Riiight ok 😂
---
I didn’t buy runecloth? I just quested
---
The reason for collaboration is irrelevant.
---
F
---
Yes, such guides exist.
---
Thank you for this!
---
You can do this, but your pve damage would be ass.  Losing imp Backstab as well as the assassination talents would be a massive loss in damage.
---
You can do this and probably be fine in most respects, but any similarly skilled rogue would destroy you in damage.
---
There aren't enough quests to get exalted even with your home faction by 60, there's absolutely no way you can get exalted with another faction at 43 through quests alone.
---
My buddy has a 36 pally that he leveled with ret. Said it was like playing a totally different class once he went Holy/prot. Now he is enjoying it as well. I went this route cause I wanted to have versatility in dungeons to tank or heal, but it ended up being my favorite overall pally spec.
---
Can that be changed to something like "picks &lt;random money text&gt; out of your pocket."? 
---
I tried messing with it a bit, but it either fails and doesn't send anything or it sends the "..GetCoinText(random(1000,9999))" as text in the emote too instead of converting that.
---

Imo arena destroyed a lot of the mystique with being a formidable PvPer. Ratings are dumb, in short. If you were good it was better for people to come to understand you were good through word of mouth or merely coming across you.
---
Also it was basically the beginning of the end of classes being unique. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem in classic because there would be no balance changes, but yeah. Having PvP so heavily formatted like that put each classes weaknesses and strengths on blast and gave everyone a lot more to bitch about until Blizzard would inevitably cave and balance in accordance to the players wishes. In wPvP and battlegrounds both weaknesses and strengths are a lot easier to compensate for or play around since it's not so closed off and there's a lot more freedom. Not so in arena.
---
What would happen, since we probably won't tolerate balance changes to classes because that spells death for class uniqueness, is arena would be super boring as rating goes up because only the classes well suited for the format would be playing it. There'd be a schism in the player base of people who give a fuck about arena because they happen to be one of the good classes for it and people who don't because they understand that the format isn't well suited for all the classes. Vanilla's formatless-ness helps it more than you may realize.
---
Which faction/server?  
---
If you are Ally and Herod you are welcome into our guild.
---
Especially a good one.
---
as a fan of The Bonfire, i approve of this
---
This is not a good guild. Nothing "hardcore" about it, these are teenagers.
---
Incidentally, having "class leaders" is another sign that the guild is bullshit.
---
I'm calling bullshit, there aren't enough quests in the game to get exalted with another faction by 43.
---
Lmao yeah idk if I'd want to move from there either
---
Gordunni Ogres in Feralas. Way south of Camp Mojache, there is an old ruins with a ton of them, and most of them are not for any quests. There is also a spot where you can use terrain to kite a bunch of ogres at a time, if you're so inclined. I was fighting 3-5 at a time on my warlock. You can easily grind out a level or two there, lots of cloth and item drops.
---
Tell people its a war trophy, you killed ten alliance to get it.....then change the subject. Never buy a shiled from the used shield guy back behind the AH....
---
The mobs outside of strat are not that bad if your there.
---
Never trust a horde. Never trust a rogue. Never trust an undead.

Now you had all three. Fucking rape his usless corpse and camp his ass till they find him and his dumb ass suicide note days later.

I can stress enough the amount of times being nice to the horde shit stains have been paid back to me in pain.
---
Demo/battle shout gives more threat per rage. I don't even have thunder clap on my action bars tbh. Thunder clap is only useful for the debuff I think.
---
You have to drink the potion which disguises you, then do some quests for Jaednar dudes, then you get access to the ability to buy the dust. I'm pretty sure it's BOP, and if it's not than you can expect it to go for more than the price they vendor it at.
---
And yet you literally just said they do, they are just more limited in scope now.
---
That is correct. You will be unable to roll on or pick up any loot from Princess until you are in a run after you've turned in the quest to save her.
---
It's like a 6 pull or something, dragons are immune to hibernate which is so much fun! (NOT)

&gt; You've flipped flopped back and forth between calling it pay to win then claiming you aren't saying it's pay to win back to pay to win. Whining about PvP then all of the sudden PvP is irrelevant, whining about pve without acknowledging that overwhelming disadvantages. As long as you can point on one advantage you think you've proven something.
---
&gt; You can't even keep your story straight.

I checked out this absolute goldmine of a comment from your post history.

Can you do me a favor and point out where this happened?

&gt; claiming you aren't saying it's pay to win

Please point out the specific post where I said that.  Thanks!

Most of everyone has been nice but I've had 2 negative interactions. One with a priest in hinterlands, I guess I took a mob from them, with a 2.5sec frostbolt cast... They followed me around saying "Up yours" and "Your mad lol". Then another instance where I was looking to do a Princess run so I asked if I could join and the dude asks, "Do you need the hit ring?" -- I said, "Nah, I'm a mage." and he replied "Fuck you." then put me on ignore. Some people are just fuckin' weird, but the majority of everyone else (and I've grouped A LOT) has been nothing but positive.
---
What's s jailbreak run?
---
Not when you kill another Warlock in AV and then want to mount up to continue on but have a fresh predeath CoT they put on you just to stick it to you before they went down. I feel like people are trying to find a reason to be able to consider the Dreadsteed an equal mount to regular ones, when really it's a budget epic mount with downsides. What it really boils down to though is if you care about PvP you should get a normal mount, if you only care about PvE then save some gold and get the Dreadsteed.
---
Can confirm. Am Tauren tank. 
---
Love Tauren warriors played one in vanilla and TBC and again now in classic. 
---
Chose Tauren initially just cause I liked the way they looked but warstomp is a great tanking and useful pvp ability
---
go full dps, mobs die quicker that way
---
Agreed.  
---

It just didnt feel right. I love tanking on my warrior but he just didn't feel right. Ive played a rogue as a main since 2005. The feel of playing the rogue is like coming home.
---
You’re so committed to trolling you are following me around to other threads 😂
---
Ret Pally and spelladin have to pay out the wazoo for consumables (and spelladin MCPs) or they can't compete.  But that guy doesn't sound too hot, unless all your 58s are at prebis and he's still in greens. Certain fights that don't favor melee he should 100% be healing.
---
With whirlwind it basically adds an auto attack. Heroic strike adds damage on your auto attack and you don’t generate rage from that auto attack so it is really only to dump rage. Hamstring doesn’t do much damage I think it is only good for windfury procs or sword spec arms warriors. Could be wrong about that though
---
Also orc racial makes for very strong warriors/rogues in pvp. passive 25% stun resist is pretty big. There's also bloodfury which boosts attack power by 25% for 15sec.
---
Not really very relevant to the point you're making, but dropping a fire totem wont give the shaman any threat.  the fire totem has it's own threat table.
---
but not working as intended
---
So not sure why you're just linking a page, but let's do the math here. You're starting at friendly, and I just did the math and summed all of those quests. It's a total of about 27k rep, so not bad! Except it takes 21k rep just to get from revered to exalted... And once we take out the 8k rep from all the 50+ quests, it looks like OP is just, oh, 17000 rep shy from getting ex. This is assuming you complete literally all of those other quests, and I was too lazy to take out the class quests; so yeah I'd say it's impossible like I said. Thanks for posting a link with no explanation though.

Fuck people who reserve items. I'd never ever ever ever ever join that sort of a group.
---
&gt;You've got a real hard-on for contradicting yourself, huh?
---
A group of 5 friends does have a competitive advantage over 1 player controlling 1 character.  They also have a competitive advantage over 1 player controlling 5 characters as I've said previously.  I've contradicted nothing.
---
&gt;Yeah, all I have to do is pay more money.
---
No, all you have to do is **pay equal money** to the group of 5.
---
&gt;There is nothing left to discuss. Case closed. You are just flailing around and screaming into the void at this point.
---
Oh look more personal attacks.
---
Drain tank relies on a pet with good mana regeneration. A voidwalker has crap mana regen.
---
Your general choices when drain tanking is succubus (solo), imp (group), and felhunter (situational). 
---
Why succubus over felhunter? More damage. Better mana regen. 
---
Why succubus over imp? Succubus can do damage without using mana. So an imp has great regen but runs out of mana if you use fire bolts and also dark pact. 
---
Why imp in groups? Blood pact. Plus the imp is more likely to stay alive due to range and phase shift (often without attacking). 
---
Why felhunter situationally? It has good mana regen and damage, but also has spell lock. A good choice for grinding some caster mobs. Also a good choice if pvp with specific classes is a possibility. 
---
When do I use a voidwalker when drain tanking? If I need sacrifice. Only really relevant for non-fearable elite mob soloing or pvp at times. 
---
When not with a dark pact build (e.g. SM/Ruin), which is the reality at 60+, voidwalkers can be useful. But when drain tanking after you have dark pact, voidwalkers should rarely be used.

But if I see someone engage on me the trap gets sprung. It's not that I'm looking to bait someone but if someone tries to kill an afk they deserve to get punked.
---
That's not true. You get reduced xp if you overlevel a quest by 6 levels or more, but orange and red ones give the full amount. It would be silly to complete an orange quests and have to wait around until it turns yellow before you can hand in in order to get maximum gains.

Thats dumb.
---
Servers transfers are locked to their type, though. You can't go from, say, PVP to PVE. Only PVP to PVP, PVE to PVE, etc.
---
I don't remember single posting items ever being a thing when I played during BC and LK.  I saw it all the time on private servers though and now it's all over classic too.
---
That's a cata thing.

Oh I'm sorry I thought this was the Hoard.

Doing my civic duty to keep the subreddit clean of the trash threads that don't relate to WoW Classic. :)

'it was 99 silver'

I started a reread and I just didn't bother at the end of the second book. Didn't pick up the third yet.
---
As a lot of people are mentioning you should download a questing addon, it’s a quality of life addition that is a must. Also classic isn’t as streamlined as retail where there’s a clear path through quests that’ll get you through a zone. I was all over the place while leveling. Also, consider grinding for a while. When I was 32-36 I grinded centaurs in desolace. A LOT of your xp comes from killing mobs, not just the quest rewards. Grinding is tedious but it’s consistent xp and you can make a lot of gold that way
---
Unfortunately this is pretty common. I dislike loot council systems, even given the problems with other ways like DKP. There are always "reasonings" in loot council that don't make much sense, but in your case it seems particularly egregious.
---
Projecting much?
---
It's holding back a very very small percentage that have complete BiS gear, so that a greater bulk of players have time to experience and enjoy the game, rather than feeling constant pressure to race along. It lets you play your own way without falling behind
---
End game TBC as Horde Paladin was amazing, you had +150 AP Trinket vs UD/Demons (Absolutely amazing for Sunwell) which Alliance didn't get, Seal of Blood, and then pre-patch hit and you got Divine Storm to boot. Felt soooo good.
---
Feral druid. Attack, use claw. Pop out heal. Pop back into kitty form attack. Repeat.
---
Servers Layered? What does that means?
---
based cringeposter
---
I don’t think I’d want to meet either of you two in game tbh
---
Lol. The Open guy was being weird, but your response didn't need to be so rude either. Neither of you look good in this exchange.
---
If they function under the same principles of "how much can i get away with without spending anything", no.
---
Warlock 100%
---
&gt; No, all you have to do is pay equal money to the group of 5.
---
So all I have to do to be equivalent to a group of five people is pay more?
---
So if I pay more I will be stronger than if I just paid for one account?
---
And how exactly is that not pay-to-win?
---
&gt; Oh look more personal attacks.
---
Oh wow, not like you, the absolute saint who has been pious and pure and free from personal attacks this entire time.
---
Congratulations on your less than zero self-awareness.
---
Paladin or shadow priest
---
Vendor price to see what items sell to vendor for. Aux for a completely new and improved auction house UI. MobInfo2 Classic so you can see what mobs have dropped. FasterLooting to save on looting time. AltasLootClassic so you can check what the loot tables for dungeon bosses.
---
TIL telling someone to fuck their mouth in general = an especially clever play on words.
---
Look do what you do, no guild or pug will ever raid with you again on our server. You all made decisions for people to roll on strikers mark that dropped by restricting classess. You didn't lets hunters roll on bindings even though "open rolls lol" and you didn't even fucking state THAT YOU WERE THE ONE MAKING THE LOOT RULES.
---
get fucked seriously
---
lol oh no, I have bad knees from taking a chop block in high school football, they hurt semi frequently and any time I walk a lot haha
---
No, I gotta agree with him. You opened up with a full broadside when he was simply informing you that he was camping then. He even gave you permission to try and take his camps. 
---
Also its quite far from the MOST assholeish (is this a word?) conversation to occur in classic wow. Ask Trade chat what they think about Needing BOE's in a dungeon to initiate that barrel of fun.
---
WW strikes with both weapons (iirc) and is an instant strike, heroic strike is on next attack (rage loss on that swing) and cleave is the same, only worse for single target (minus the part it has normal threat gen)
---
Thanks for the input, glad we both drove this discussion to some real places.
---
I knew he’d do us all proud.
---
nothing. It's not illegal, just unethical.
---
Oh thats very nice
---
&gt;So you need five IRL players in order to gain a competitive advantage over one IRL player.
---
Obviously not, since I can kill multiboxers by myself.  As I've said multiple times and you've agreed there are multiple counters to them.
---
This is why I love it.  There are a lot of droughts, but it seems like when I open up on a clothie it’s usually there at least once or twice with at least one crit.  RNGesus loves me 
---
I think a lot of people here are skipping out on the 3 points in precision.  It brought my damage up pretty good.
---
I'm a Holy Paladin.
---
Nah man you're super negative and projecting your own shit onto people online. It's a reason for concern.
---
I'm high and going to go get some tacos so I'm good.
---
I legit just hope you feel better soon.
---
Sending me a personal hateful message and reporting me  isn't helping your situation.
---
&gt; If you couldn’t trust your guild leadership with loot council, why would you choose to raid with that guild?
---
Because paid realm transfers don't exist, and beggars can't be choosers. On my server, there is exactly one guild that was recruiting my class.
---
The word really means get the fuck out of my inbox for splitting hairs lol
---
So if a multiboxer casts a spell, it will do equal damage to me when I cast the same spell?
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
where's the graveyard they would spawn at?
---
I think you're projecting a bit here. There are lots of tanks and healers who are in raids for tanking and healing gear.
---
I remember hearing some way of getting around that, but can not confirm 100% if it’s true or not
---
I'm guessing I wrote this in Cata, maybe Wrath.
---
This is perfect! I want to explore some cool places and take some guildies around, thank you!
---
Would love to know as well.
---
Yeah if we’re talking only dungeons, you should be a 31/20/0 build. Sweeping strikes + enrage + whirlwind = GG for threat.
---
31/5/15 is a build that lets you raid tank while in PvP/AoE threat spec.
---
&gt; Begonethot
---
I originally read that as beg-one-thot. Was confused.
---
Don’t stream
---
I believe you can use an ornate spyglass in the direction of him and /tar jed also
---
well I was hoping you would spot the repeatable cloth turn in quest amongst the 328 other quests there. So...between the hundreds of quests that give rep you turn in some stacks of cloth.
---
Posting this again because?
---
Oh is it just gnomes? I heard staysafe talking about it but couldn't find the spot on my undead warlock haha. swiftness potions are definitely clutch
---
It sounds like the orc warrior just doesn't gel with you. You *want* to want to be the big burly tank man. But it's just not working for you. Something about the gameplay style isn't connecting to you. 
---
Just switch. You could try tauren/undead warrior, or just leave horde and join alliance. Try playing a nelf druid or nelf rogue. 
---
Seriously, the game is very forgiving for whatever spec you want to play. Do what you enjoy.
---
I'm with you guys op was a dick. I'd group with open he seems chill and not like op who'd probably rage hard if he got ganked or mobs stole from him.
---
Edit: Just read the title, to bad you are the toxic one there.
---
I believe the last time I counted the bosses in there I was at like 17 or something. Not sure how accurate that is, but thats a freaking adventure of a dungeon, especially if you do all of it.
---
But its one thing if its not BIS for them but it a 7% upgrade vs. a mages 10%. Or it could be BIS for mage, but a bigger upgrade for them
---
Question is more of why should they be able to roll on it when its only a .5% increase in DPS vs. someone else's 10% increase in DPS&gt;
---
Me and my gf have been playing duo all the way up to 57. We have NEVER ganked any alliance and we have ran past hundreds. Yesterday I got so fucking sick of peice of shit alliance 60's killing us on sight that I went on a rampage and will slay every filthy mother fucking alliance I see. F them all. They literally never have engaged when our level and 2 of them. Only when they outlevel or outnumber us. 12 days played and i feel no remorse for these piece of shits
---
Your lack of self awareness is astounding. He is being weird but still polite and then you suggest he has been dropped on his head, and you think *he's* the toxic one?
---
Fuck yes. Great read! 
---
BTW, It’s the same on Kirtonos and I cannot tell you how much satisfaction I received from revenge killing the pack of horde that camped the entrance of BRD the last four nights. We were very outnumbered, stood our ground, and came out victorious. Eat it!
---
Rogue was very popular back in the day
---
Now, we all know how scaling and exponential rage, dps, damage taken, and balance works
---
So, everyone that played back in vanilla knows better today and all the rogues basically rerolled warrior this time
---
More of a preference thing imo. You definitely do alot more damage with a 2hander, but you also take more damage. I mostly swung my way to 60 with a 2h (ravager, mara quest staff) but I always made/make sure to keep a 1h and a shield ready for hard quests where I might tank and stuff like that.
---
For ele I'd try to get my hands on a 1h+shield if possible, since the armour value of good shields is pretty insane. Now ideally you'd of course kill the target before it reaches you, but it won't always happen and sometimes you're gonna pull more than 1 mob at a time, so the extra armour definitely helps.
---
In dungeons it shouldn't matter that much, but tbh shamans do alot of threat so the shield could save your life sometimes.
---
Also I wouldn't listen to what spec people suggest you to play, try them all and figure out what's fun for you. Personally I enjoyed solo leveling more as ele, but in dungeons I pref enha or even healer. I mean ele can be decent fun in dungeons, but if you really go all out and burst that insane dps, you're gonna pull aggro and either die or at best just tank the mob-&gt;pushback-&gt;bad dps.
---
Also I found it sort of frustrating to just sit there drinking when the rest of the group is already fighting the next pack. With enha you can just whack on even if oom. Also enha can offtank mobs that would otherwise run to hit a healer or a mage.
---
OP insults this guy after he gives him a heads up that hes camping these mobs, then like a child puts him on ignore. Cool post.
---
lol deleted
---
Really? Lost, Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, Mad Men, etc. There are so many shows in recent history that had AWFUL endings, it's better to wait for a series to finish before deciding whether it's worth watching or not.
---
This is classic in its purest form
---
Lots of people are altoholics. So yea it is.
---
As it relates to classic, anecdotal evidence is indeed all we have about the statistics at large 
---
However the retail realm has many statistics generating devices to illustrate the net impact of both factions.. and it’s clear that Horde has dominated PVP in the game throughout every expansion.
---
So maybe a more accurate statement would be, “to my surprise, they were more clever than I gave them credit [for]...”
---
Yeah I dont think so.
---
Screw that. It’s a cheap way to pay for tanks who are in short supply. If you are a good tank getting the first orb is a decent way to say thanks and doesn’t directly come from anyone’s wallet.
---
Our mt farmed SM instance forever. It's not contested and it went fast for him.
---
As long as you are having fun!
---
Because it increases their dps.
---
&gt; It's pretty clear every time these comments come up it's about equal on both sides because statistically... It has to be.
---
That assumes that the factions average out to being balanced. For example, it’s entirely possible that 65% of all classic wow players play Horde.
---
100%  
---
I was never interested in coming back to vanilla, but holy shit I enjoy this so much more than Retail!
---
Correct 1 alliance vs 4 horde, close to even field.
---
I like the lore behind the Paladin and I like my little dwarf, but holy fuck is leveling a Paladin boring. They're god like in PvP but I don't think I'll make it to 60 it's just fucking awful.
---
The ONLY way to do loot council is to have a public list of gear and who gets it, in what order. 
---
No arguments, no complaints. You can see who is getting what and if you have a problem you message an officer and sort it out before raid. If you don’t like it you don’t need to go, but you are fully informed in advance.
---
Problem with DKP is people end up hoarding points and potentially passing on upgrades in order to key in on a specific item (usually a weapon). While this is fine if only a few do it, you potentially have a case where all of one class pass on an upgrade to save points and you end up slowing progression as a unit. 
---
We use a couple of raid mods that keep track of everything from attendance to loot distribution and every member has to have the mods. This way everyone can see how loot is being distributed / peoples attendance / BIS wishlists. So far we havent had a problem and gear is going around evenly sans our main tank / off tank getting priority on main spec gear. Good thing is that doesnt cross over with anything our dps warriors want for the most part.

If your intent in playing is min/maxing and getting that 1% more damage done a fight, delete your character and reroll. It sounds like you're like the majority of us and don't give a fuck though. Keep on keeping on my man, the only class/race combo people really care about at all is Dwarf Priest, and even that is minor.
---
female orc? no that ain't normal dude
---
Thank you for this informative answer.
---
Should the loot rules have been different? Maybe. But everyone agreed to the loot rule by staying in the group, so this doesn’t even matter. 
---
Should you have gotten the bindings? Absolutely. You won based on the stated loot rules. 
---
Would I have kept the bindings in your situation? Absolutely. I wouldn’t take it from a guild tank. But that is just me. But this was you or PUGs. And you followed the pre-established loot rules.
---
lol. I have nothing against them. They are free to play how they want to play. Maybe it's because I'm the tank so I've never faced the problem of endlessly waiting for a tank to join when there is a dps warrior in the group.
---
Books are the best fantasy I've ever read.
---
Cant ninja skills
---
It's a war trophy!
---
- OP, prolly ;-)
---
That's a really good deal. Too bad they're horde.
---
Well, he's not wrong, it does give more value to a human then a gnome.
---
Most classes can solo them easily, including rogues
---
When honour returns, the nice rogue will disappear. That's what everyone remembers. 
---
  - A rogue
---
That's a retail player right there boys
---
It’s an extra swing that they can dodge yaaaa feel me? Dw i had my mind blown a few months ago too lol
---
MS&gt;OS means the spec you raid with.  PVP gear is considered secondary and some guilds place it ahead of OS.  If you're raiding as a healer or tank and expecting to get priority on dps gear you're doing it wrong unless you clarify with the guild / raid leader that you're filling a role but rolling on dps as your main spec.
---
Tier gear depends.  For warriors its generally considered tank MS.  For shaman I believe its generally considered MS for healing and OS for elemental.  If you have any questions you should clarify ahead of the run.  Whomever is leading the raid should be able to clarify and if they don't you can decline to join the raid/guild.
---
I disagree that just because your tier gear doesn't fit your MS means there's no reason to raid.  The best items in most raids are non-tier components.  As a fury warrior I have almost no interest in my tier 1 gear.  I'd much rather have tanks passing on brutality blade and viskagg than me have an opportunity to roll on tier gear.  I think most elemental shaman would also prefer healers passing on ToEP than have the opportunity to roll on tier gear.
---
##*whoosh*
---
I sure as fuck wouldn’t you are better off in a pug instead of a guild where buddies funnel loot to each other. Unless you are good friends with gm you are SOL
---
Plus... just... he’s a gnome... eww...
---
But, the leader should have stated that ahead of time. No sense in getting someone’s hopes up unnecessarily.
---
Yeah I’m mostly against loot council in general after personal experiences with it. I was with a guild in vanilla that raided up through BC. We were all noobs at the time but we put in work and effort at learning and eventually got into BT in BC and started downing Illidaddy. 
---
Our loot system had been loot council on rare items but everything else was DKP. It worked well up until BT and Glaives started being part of the equation. 
---
I was the melee officer as a DPS fury warrior that had been with the guild since our days in vanilla. It was always the understanding that I would get the 1st set of glaives. Then we picked up a rogue midway through BT progression who stuck around and was very regular and helpful to the guild. He was also insanely good at playing a rogue so when the fated kill came and the MH glaive drops, loot council decided the rogue would “benefit more” from the glaive. I was the only officer that opposed the idea so I had no choice but to concede. The glaive no more than hit the bag of the rogue before “stabzystab has left the guild”. 
---
I’ve never been so furious before in my life. I gquit that night and haven’t talked to a single one of those guys since. From that point forward I’ll never trust a loot council again.
---
If it wasn’t stated prior to the rolls started it is considered ninja looting according to blizzard’s TOS. They will not honor a ticket so it sucks but ninjas don’t get punished
---
The first week of the raid you can't trade much, but it really doesn't take long to get to the point where a large portion of the drops can be traded and people are looking for upgrades in the form of sockets, better secondaries, better azerite traits, or better trinkets rather than ilvl upgrades.
---
But then I eventually realize you have ties to the inventor of Windfury so I'm trying to write you out of our publications so people won't think I'm biased, but it's all too late. You already sent your goons after me, and now I'm living a life on the run, constantly fearing for my safety.
---
The thing is, TSA and Furious Howl also provide an increase to dps, but I was uncertain of which buffed the dps more. Still am for that matter.
---
Report him. If you won the roll and that is the loot rules, it is yours.
---
Luckily with DM coming soon, the ring is worthless
---
Come to Herod and fight me
---
I quit wow a month or two after cata released.  Literally didn't play for 9ish years. Classic brought me back after testing on a private server I'd still enjoy the game.
---
I fail to see how this is obvious.
---
Sadly the costs of race choice in classic. Play what race you want with a possible cost. :(
---
Nothing faster than 100% mount.
---
Friend?
---
You know what gives me feelings of power? [**Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker**], that’s what.
---
Good point. But: If you're going to PvP, the BG mounts should become available at some point, up to which the epic mount is still better (and cheaper).

I highly recommend hopping on the warlock discord server!

Not if there's 3 other guys to res him. Or he's a shammy and can ankh.
---
Must be fun not facing undead rogues. While leveling its pretty impossible to survive until the second fear.
---
Depends. Goes back &amp; fourth. Really it’s fun
---
Your assumption that people who play tanks and healers aren't interested in getting better tanking/healing gear is not correct.
---
Lol it’s super old. Idk if it even works.
---
The only things that piss me off is the teleporting and cross realm "features".
---
I'm still in contention that flying mounts ruined wow.

Why have a highly detailed open world if everyone is just gonna teleport everywhere

Agreed.

"Man, I don't like that dudes tone and attitude.  The best way to deal with it is to give him a tone and attitude he won't like.  Yeah, it won't de-escalate the situation nor show him any compassion or understanding, but hey...gotta fight fire with fire."

---
Thank's for the reassurance everyone. Forsaken is best!
---
Are they not aware that milk should be rerigerated?
---
I wouldn't drink that milk if you paid me.
---
we used to have a term in EverQuest called The holy Trinity and it wasn't tank healer damage it was tank healer support and that was the foundation of the group.
---
so most groups we would do in EverQuest it was always the tank healer and someone that can debuff the mobs and then you filled in damage afterwards. 
---
I know this doesn't really add to the discussion. I just find it funny how much change there was between generations of the genre
---
It doesn't raise it faster if you fish at a harder place?
---
Because tanking is mind numbingly boring and dull compared to dps.   I tanked when I played during wrath -&gt; mop.   The tanking in classic is just.. really really bad.   It's not compelling, you have no control over the situation if dps even slightly open up,  and you basically have two abilities to spam depending on the situation.   The pulls are all the same, there's nothing to break up the monotony.  The class diversity in tanking classic is essentially zero. 
---
I tank when I have to, which is almost all the time because heaven forbid any of these mages roll a class that can tank.
---
You don’t even need full pre bis that was your choice and mistake if you didn’t enjoy doing it. People acting all elitist for easy ass content where you could jerk off half the run and still do fine. I understand where you are coming from but 99% of the time loot council and “class leaders” just means we give loot to our friends
---
I don’t want long que

You shouldn’t have left biggles!

If you feel that strongly find me on Kurinnaxx. I'm not arguing semantics with you, jfc.

---
who the fuck does ubrs with a loot master?
---
My Holy Light and the mob's attack landed simultaneously, causing the game to register it as an Overkill.  I thought I was dead and was amazed when it went off.
---
Idk man. I felt great when he finally logged out. /Who'd him a few times that night and didnt see him online either. It was cathartic. I went back to playing like normal afterwards, happy as can be.
---
theyre just about gone (the queues)
---
It says maybe 5 of the 100 hours was doing with his warrior friend.
---
Reading Comprehension -10
---
But 'Pre raid bis' and then 4th overall in P1 is how I read your response.
---
It’s the same problem I have with the Commander’s Crest - it’s incredible for a prot warrior but it feels weird repping the alliance insignia (which also doesn’t make sense lore wise why the ghost of a lorderon commander drops a shield with the insignia of the alliance)
---
As the Hyjal area is under construction there was no way to get your body back. I'm not 100% but I think the GY you spawned at was in Winterspring. You had to take Rez sickness if I remember.
---
That's why I said the only reason it doesn't count is through a technicality. A multiboxer using these programs is at their computer, pressing buttons. They're also *technically* getting one output per keypress, because all the boxes characters are just copying what the controlled character is doing.
---
In reality, though, they're getting 5, or 10, or 40 outputs for one key press, and the external program is automating the other 4, 9, 39 characters to mimick their inputs.
---
The whole time I'm leveling I'm thinking about endgame but never seem to get far enough
---
And it lasts 5 minutes.
---
Edit: and shaman's have shocks, totems, and lighting to supplement the damage.
---
Paladins get a seal and a prayer...
---
I am :)
---
More like S4 onwards.
---
Tell everyone you took it off a dead ally.
---
Tbh.... sounds like a pretty shitty guild you're in then. Is it a guild you actually have an attachment to or is it one you just joined while leveling or just joined because it's a "big" guild on the server? 
---
I would suggest finding a guild where the members actually support each other. It will provide you a much better game experience than just a random faceless mob that doesn't care about others.
---
The difference is small, you will be fine.
---
Edit: And this is coming from an orc warrior enthusiast.
---
Did they? Holy shit...well that explains a lot.
---
What makes this happen? I exit the game all the time while flying (update addons, etc) and have never experienced it
---
I can see people enjoying the video who knew nothing about mmo's or wow prior to retail but yeah pretty much wasted 40 minutes
---
just charge for runs like every other tank
---
Overpower's charge is lost when you switch targets away from the target that dodged, confirmed working as intended [in a blue post here.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887) I've also had some sketchy losses of the charge in general from target switching, that I can't explain.
---
In any case, yes, I use a mouseover macro with Overpower to avoid this, you probably should too. The one I use is
---
    #showtooltip Overpower
---
    /cast [nostance:1] Battle Stance
---
    /cast [@mouseover,harm,nodead][] Overpower
---
    /cast Overpower
---
It was modified from one I found in the Warrior Discord, so I'm not quite sure why the empty brackets are there on the third line. My guess is as an additional targetting requirement that'll have it hit your target if there's no mouseover target, which I only now realize, and I think that makes the last /cast Overpower redundant. If someone could confirm, that'd be nice.
---
In any case, it's worked wonders, I've yet to drop an Overpower proc since using it.
---
Sounds a lot like my guild tbh. Started off as "you can't roll if you already got something, boe included" to "you can't roll if you already got something, boe excluded" to "would you mind giving that item to the main tank" after winning a roll.
---
&gt;So all I have to do to be equivalent to a group of five people is pay more?
---
No, all you have to do control a group of 5 characters is pay the same as that group of 5 characters does.  Just because you want to play all of them yourself doesn't make it unfair.
---
&gt;And how exactly is that not pay-to-win?
---
Because every account is $15 doesn't matter who is playing it.
---
&gt;Congratulations on your less than zero self-awareness.
---
I'm not the one who reported to the mods and then continued to harass someone and break the rules. Notice how I'm not the one with removed comments in this chain?  It's because all of my comments have been on point and without personal attacks since then.
---
How about you pull the enemies further away from the chest, drop the dummy there, vanish and sprint back to the chest and try looting then.
---
I do dkp in my guild and when a player bitches about how the best should be rewarded more, I remind them that they're all equally garbage in my eyes.

For most groups, MS &gt;OS doesn't necessarily mean what spec you're performing in but whichever you consider your main spec. So if you normally play Ele but help out the raid as Resto, as long as you state your intentions at the beginning of the run most groups would be fine with you rolling need on pieces considered Ele and taking Resto pieces as your offspec when no one who needs them for main spec wants to roll for them.
---
So sad but so true.
---
But how do you bind them
---
So you started in either wotlk or cataclysm. Dont think there is much nostalgia to get from vanilla then, imo
---
 Of course:
---
/run SendChatMessage("picks "..GetCoinText(random(1000,9999)..” out of your pocket.”),"emote")
---
`..` is the string combinatory for macros/lua
---
Should be noted that it's Alliance only.
---
Brutality blade drops in MC.
---
No I’m talking about people only rolling in groups that they watched a YouTube video on. Spell cleave melee cleave etc. 
---
Reserve groups are just lazy ass players that want the game to be easier, they don’t want to have to grind for the loot and compete with others. They want their reward with minimal effort, a lot like retail. 
---
It doesn’t take much effort to make some friends or join a guild and do the runs that way, but that’s too much work for them
---
Then you have the people that outright buy their BiS from reserve groups. Literal pay to win.
---
Textbook dick move
---
Ignore nostalgia, the game is great and holds up on its own.
---
-Sincerely someone who has never played retail wow.
---
Anyone know what the odds are of both Dal'Rends dropping in the same kill?
---
It’s a guild that matched my raiding times. To be honest finding a guild where people give a damn on my server has not been easy. Idk what it is everyone seems to have this chip on their shoulder and I just want a fun relaxed community.
---
what do you mean due to 2 hit proc?
---
Some people will tell you Arms is better, some would say Fury.
---
I leveled 1-40 as Fury in Vanilla, and 1-40 as Arms in Classic.
---
Hard to compare since it was 15 years ago, but I'm having a pretty easy time with Arms.
---
Arms also gives you Tactical Mastery early on, which is almost necessary for tanking while leveling up.
---
If you do go Fury, go 2H Fury. You will miss way too much if you Duel Wield without hit gear.
---
Either way, Arms at 40. Don't go Prot until the 50s.
---
Get AtlasLoot addon to see what all dungeon bosses drop.
---
My man....that's your decision to make, not anyone else's.
---
You can get it for 1 month and see how you like it, then you decide if *you* want to continue.
---
"Selling rez service for 1g"
---
Yeah thats normal. Kind of a dick move on your guildie though not giving it to you though. If I was the GM I'd be pretty pissed at him.
---
Except you still have a health potion that you can use when you're actually in danger of dying, thus saving the healer from having to flash heal or shield you, which is far more mana than topping someone off with a downranked heal.
---
ok cool. as a backstab/ambush spec for lower level since easier access to daggers + no cheap shot, would you recommend assassination or  sub
---
Is that so? Good to know, that explains why I see warriors with fast off-hands all the time. Thanks!
---
Damn, only 6 people to run UBRS now?
---
Only you can prevent forest fires
---
They rolled over you and your in their guild...that’s lame. That being said if everyone is contributing then they should all have equal opportunity to roll it.
---
I'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet, but, uh, where will this dwarf sex party be? I need to know so I can stay far away from it. What a disgusting thing.
---
But definitely, please tell me exactly where it is. Wouldn't ever want to stumble into something like that!
---
If I use my old account I think I'll have all the DLC till 2017 or 2016 whatever the one that levels to 100
---
No worries! 😊
---
Yep and here I am 58 getting a LvL per week
---
This is exactly what I was thinking as well. Want to roll a gnome? Ok, well have fun corpse running out of your starting zone!
---
Auctioneer
---
Now do one for skul in strat from service enterence
---
Orc for stun resist against all the Rogues.
---
Cat. Boars are too slow and you want that sweet, sweet spell pushback.
---
Just join a guild with dkp.
---
Quest run: Typically just going around doing whatever quests people have.
---
Jailbreak: Doing the alliance ony attunement chain, specifically the last part of it that involves the escort quest
---
Emp run: Just going straight to emperor; Angerforge -&gt; Golem lord -&gt; Guzzler -&gt; Flamelash -&gt; 7d -&gt; Emp
---
Lava run: Using the lava jumping trick to get straight to the end of the instance; usually just Incendius, Magmus and Emp
---
This is my first time playing the game too and I'm on a pvp server. I've lost most of encounters but on the whole world pvp has been rare for me. I've definitely met more friendly people on the opposite faction than jerks. Sulfuras Horde, by the way
---
Shout out to every alliance player that waves back
---
No no, i'm asking why some server has the Layered write on Population while others have just Medium or low?
---
You'll be fine.  Just remind people they might have to pull an extra pack when you enter the orc room after the hatchery.  (due to aggro radius)
---
idk, my bff Jill
---
It's my understanding that Mind Flay, assuming you have at least 11 points in Shadow, only becomes good once you're in your mid 30s, and even then is best used with a full Shadow talent tree for the added damage and shadow vulnerability. It's base damage over time is not great, but it is mana efficient ... until you realize that Holy Priests spamming Smite will do more damage over time and stop spamming it to start wanding sooner for that sweet sweet mana regen. I'd say the real advantage of mind flay is the slowing effect so that it takes mobs much longer to catch up to you. Also good for runners.
---
I'm a rogue and I kind of agree honestly. Rogue and warrior should roll for main hand and whoever wins gets both. The off hand isn't great without the main hand. At least that's how I would ask the party if they wanted to roll as such obviously.
---
What system would you prefer?
---
&gt; why is it considered bad etiquette or "ninja-ing" to compete by need rolling for the item upgrade against a player that can only wear leather?
---
It's not. Some people will bitch about it, but let them. Itemization in classic is fucky, and Leather is just about the best stuff all around for anyone who uses attack power as a result.
---
So Pandaren, Worgen, or Vulpira?
---
I was playing with a paladin yesterday, we were level 42 and 45 and he was not great haha, he didn't keep up his blessings, he used all his mana on one mob and he had pretty outdated gear. He was a fun guy though and it was fun to learn about how little he cared about efficiency and he just liked to play while watching Netflix haha
---
&gt; shocks, totems, and lighting
---
And you sped 80% of your mana on totem twisting and spamming rank 1 ES for elemental devastation. You also never LB in a fight as enh.
---
Yes, you messed up because you didn't roll a dwarf. That is all.
---
Not ganking horde when you get the chance...  On PVP servers there are two types of playes; pimps and bitches. I think it is very clear what type you are.
---
How much did you pay for the dagger?
---
He’s talking about MC, that was an example
---
"Especially if they're lower level than me"
---
Well at least you're not delusional about your ineptitude for fighting people of equal level.
---
also hit up AH for "... of the Eagle" greens. sometimes you can find some real steals!
---
Edit: so I was thinking of int as damage. If you meant spell dmg my bad!
---
Lost painweaver band last night but you got it beat by a long shot
---
All of these people downvoting, trying to keep secrets to themselves lol
---
I'm sharing the knowledge and the power. YOU CANT STOP ME!
---
I assume it will get longer with layering?
---
&gt; That's paying more, you fucking dunce.
---
One person paying for 5 accounts is the same as 5 people paying for 1 account.  Equal amount, equal accounts.
---
&gt;Except the multiboxer's account is essentially $75.
---
So is the group total of 5 friends.
---
&gt;Oh cry me a river you fucking baby. You've been an asshole from the jump and now you're claiming to be "harassed." Let me play you a song on the world's tiniest violin
---
We were mutual assholes to each other.  I thought that was fine, so I didn't report you.  You got upsetti spaghetti and brought in the popo, too bad you ended up getting slapped instead.
---
To quote Liar Liar - "STOP BREAKING THE LAW"
---
This. Agreed 100%
---
[Actually it was super easy, barely an inconvenience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhKOV3nImQ)
---
Can someone explain the details of the lockout? I thought it was 5 per hour.
---
You can, but don't expect to be taken in to every group. It is common for someone forming a UBRS group to only take 60's. Other times they are fine with taking lower levels. 58+ is usually what is ok for DPS, 56+ is fine for healers.
---
Taking lower levels really just means the group will have to clear 1-2 extra packs through the Jed area before Rend.
---
Depends on the loot rules. As G09G said, the default is group loot. In it, all money is split evenly between everyone in the group, all items below the loot threshold are distributed in a round-robin style that rotates through the members of the group in order, and all items above the loot threshold are rolled on using the default need/greed/pass UI.
---
Retail is probably the one closest to what you had, but you should give classic a chance.
---
The game does not really compare to retail imo. It feels like two complete different games.
---
This sounds all fine and dandy until you realize it's possible to run bed 20 times, lose roll on him, run another 20 times then lose roll again. It's not noble it's just brain-dead.
---
LBRS is 5 man, UBRS is 10 man (2 healers)
---
I started healing UBRS at 58. It’s not hard at all, you should be fine. The only problem is, your level will cause greater threat and make the group have to avoid occasional  shortcuts etc.
---
May as well try it out. LBRS you can 100% do.
---
Also - it can be weird at first with 10 players. Healing MC is another beast though with 40 players and it’s just a matter of getting used to it.
---
So I am currently dagger spec as mentioned with gutgore ripper, bonescraper (from stratholme) as offhand, and the aged leather core gloves. Are those better than having the devilsaur set right now?
---
It's not cheating. If you had any idea how much work it takes to multibox, you'd understand it's just a different way to play the game.
---
2 people have given me 1g, I didn't even ask for it :) a mage also gave me some water
---
Tanks can go for him as well, has a nice ring.
---
The idea is that the items go to the person who needs it the 'most', so the entire raid improves, which improves the overall time taken to complete the raids so that in the future you can just farm MC/Onyxia in like &lt;2hrs. Sure that cloth item may have been a decent upgrade to your BiS item, but that mage/priest/warlock going from a green to an epic is going to add a decent amount of damage/heals. 
---
After a few months it gets to the point where MC/Onyxia is just a quick farming adventure and all the major players are geared, so then the equipment that is more liberally given out to other classes that don't benefit from it as much. 
---
You may not like it and that's fine, other guilds use DKP or even rolling, but the idea with loot councils and distributing loot this way is that the raid group improves the most which allows for easier farming down the line.
---
Is it best for the guild/raid as a whole? Probably. Can it cause you to get screwed over, or feel like it's unfair? Also probably.
---
It's really about whether you are invested enough in the guild and the people the guild is distributing loot to in order to make a personal sacrifice for them.
---
If it's a bunch of strangers you joined on a whim and aren't connecting with personally, I'd say look somewhere else. Also your general attitude about the situation makes me think you're not going to be happy with that system.
---
You're just justifying being a dick in game. I hate rogues for being so stereotypically cowardly, and apparently two faced. Same goes for mages, honorless peons.
---
How can I trust people I don't know? I just got into my guild. Sure if everybody has been together a long time then it's probably a good idea, but most of the time it's only a core of people who have and any newbies should be wary of that core getting favoritism.
---
Hands Across Azeroth.
---
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_(2019_film)
---
Yes raid epics are tradeable for an hour or so to others in the raid if you haven't equipped it
---
Stop using add ons that ruin the game, l2p scrub
---
Edit: a word
---
You are disregarding the 100 additional AP from TSA. Windfury gives each attack 20% chance to proc for 315 additional attack power. My question is simply this: is this chance to proc better than the 100 additional AP from TSA, which is constant, + with Furious Howl? I'm not good with math, which is why I posted this question.
---
Oh fuck off with that shit.  Gear doesn't magically become better on a human verse a gnome.  If the roll was before the announcement that humans get priority, then the sword was ninja'd by the leader.
---
So boring
---
At 14 you are the same age as I was when I first played at it's release. Personally, it brought me great amounts of joy back then and I think you should do it. It's a great game overall, the community is great, and the adventures are heavy.
---
Few games like this exist anymore. At this stage, be mindful of the realm you choose to begin playing on. There are a few realms whose community is different due to popular players on them. I would recommend choosing a medium populated PvP server. It's nice to be a part of a "just another realm." The realm isn't in any highlights online, but the community within is isolated and it feels like the real experience.
---
And PvP because the world feels wrong without being at real war with the opposing faction. It adds so much to the little moments along your quests through Azeroth.
---
If you choose to roll Alliance on Deviant Delight, send a private message to me on reddit and I will help you along your journey. Do not feel obligated, choose what you want. There are thousands of players like myself who will be there to help. Many will not, but they're lame anyway.
---
 loot council probably isn't necessary,  but this sounds like normal master looter stuff it's about what is best for the guild. Upgrading a green is a lot more beneficial than a pre-bis. If you want a more fair system dkp with decay is more up your alley.
---
For sure, but even still its affecting you even while solo.  You'd have a harder time finishing quests and finding mobs to kill if there was no layering, as well as servers have double and triple the materials available on layered servers which affects the AH pricing.
---
Very interesting, great to know. I did not know you were allowed to do that here in Classic WoW.
---
I found it difficult to heal BRD as shadow at 52. Definitely could not keep up at angerforge and the pyromancer mobs. Switched to holy disc at 54, and spammed dungeons til 60. Healed brd, lbrs, scholo snd Strat with no issues
---
So, real life basically?
---
Lost painweaver to an enhance shaman. Who plays an enhance shaman lol??
---
Well put everything on low put detail on low. Make sure in power options it's set to high performance mode. Make sure screen resolution is set to 100%/make it full screen not borderless windows.
---
Now this is pog raking.
---
Exceot that dire maul isnt a dungeon. Its 3. If someone asks for DM north you wont think its the northern part of dead mines
---
Seems kind of odd that Mount Hyjal has existed as a partially-finished zone since vanilla yet was only fully made available 6 years later. Perhaps they had issues with determining how to add the zone in a way that's best-fitting for lore development?
---
I'm a tank, I want the tank gear. If I wanted DPS gear I would re roll to fury
---
As a mage who's just getting into raiding, what are all those consumes? And is that a normal amount of each for an MC?
---
I get this a bit but with the away tag.  There are times where I will be  doing something on my other monitor that takes up like 90% of my attention but not my active participation on that screen.  So I will go down to a coast and fish.  I even put myself on Away so anyone who has me on friends knows I am not available.  Its amazing how many people still whisper me asking me to heal stuff.
---
Gold is a lot easier to come by than it once was.  I hit 60 a week ago, had my epic mount the day after hitting 60 and am back up to 4 or 500g with zero layer abuse.  Just running dungeons and some farming with mining and skinning.
---
&gt; you clarify with the guild / raid leader that you're filling a role but rolling on dps as your main spec.
---
This is the key here. It should be your true MS not your Raiding Spec. Hard to prove but hopefully the raid leader is a rational person.
---
6 man rend runs are pretty common. Generally it's all melee trying to farm Truestrike and one or two other pieces (battleborn Armbraces, and the swords).
---
Poor kodo 😢
---
Using a relatively small subreddit like this, especially when comparing to the size of the retail wow subreddit is hilarious. The classic wow subreddit nor the official forums are representative of the majority of the wow player base. The only places future legacy server questions get downvoted are this subreddit and classic wow forums. 
---
Thank you for proving the circle jerk theory correct.
---
This is my mentality as well I just hit 59 last night and I’m not in a huge hurry to get into raiding or anything he’ll PUGs can clear the content. I just thought these guys were cool as a good sized guild but the longer I’m in it the more I regret it. People barely speak and don’t reply in guild chat. Maybe they just don’t like me I’m not sure I’ve not been in it that long. I even been giving up my alc CDs for them and barely have any interaction. I regret the server I picked.
---
Well, damn, you're right. It is just the hat. Was that changed at some point, or is my memory just that bad?
---
LBRS is technically a raid as well, but usually not raided. LBRS and UBRS is in the same instance.
---
I’m in your guild, you are exaggerating pretty much everything you said, the class leaders didn’t even take loot, check who got the trinket again lol. But congrats you got a good reaction and some free karma
---
I swapped to that because there will likely be another paladin in your group at that time who can throw Retribution Aura on. This way to get maximum benefits from devotion, and still retain retribution for the extra holy dmg when hit.
---
Can you list them so I don’t have to watch the vid?
---

Maybe in BfA. Frostmage did a lot more than frostbolts and procs in Legion and Warlords.
---
Mage
---
Then yeah, what I said before. Medium and Low describe the population on the server. Layered should be taken to mean the population is above Full.
---
RIP all warriors still farming to get lionheart helmet now... prices already doubled
---
I think he might be a professional quote maker.
---
You never watched laintime have you.
---
Warriors don't make good alts in my opinion, you need good gear for them to shine and they aren't good gold farmers.
---
I'd say Hunter = Mage &gt; Warlock = Rogue &gt; Warrior. 
---
Hunters and Mages are easy to level solo, and make great farmers without needing much gear if you get them to 60.
---
If you don't much care about gold farming on your alt, Rogue and Warlock are both great classes. Rogues are obviously fun on PvP servers. 
---
Warlocks are fun, and diverse for a DPS class. They have a lot of utility, both group and solo (Healthstone, Soulstone, Summon). Since they can switch health to mana and mana to health, they also rarely have to stop to eat/ drink. Their pets are awesome and they have one for each situation (Imp in groups, VW solo, Succubus/ Felhunter in PvP), and have some cool flavor abilities to let them (temporarily) control other demons as well.
---
They also get a free mount at 40, which is nice on an alt.
---
What server is this? Think I've seen a dwarf priest do this a couple of days ago, so it might be you
---
Your logic makes no sense, considering people spend far more time 'farming' for gold and not making anywhere near this amount while putting in about 200x more effort. 
---
And no, you cannot make similar amounts with Mithril casings, i have tried. You say you've made 100g on casing, im saying ive made 1300g on Thorium. I've probably spent like 1 hour more than you have in the AH....

---
Also to throw in for orc tanks, you may not want to use blood fury due to reduced healing, but I think that doesn't apply to priest bubbles. Haven't tested though
---
Edit for spelling
---
Yes rush your epic mount. That’s what everyone should do but they impulsively spend their gold on gear
---
I'm assume exit/alt+f4 still ends the packet transfer "properly," while in my case, my wifi straight up died, so the connection was interrupted instead of terminated. Something. I'm not a networking expert, but common sense says it's something along those lines.
---
Not a problem :D. I actually stopped using the addon at like level 29-30, and went to southshore/Arathi highlands on my own as I saw there were quests there. I too was at a loss of what I should be doing, and felt annoyed there wasn’t really a route with good quests that I could find (until I loaded up wowpro again).The way wowpro works is there’s a singular leveling zone for each level up to level 30 (ie: a red ridge mountain guide from 15-18, duskwood 22-25, etc). The 30-40 and 40-50 quest guides aren’t locked in to a particular zone, but the people who made it did a wonderful job. The level 30 one starts with buying bloodstone ore/bronze patterned bracers and a couple of other items which are used in booty bay for quest turn ins at like level 33. And it has you go to thousand needles, then at some point you’ll go back to darkshire duskwood to finish the “the legend of Stalvan” questline (if you’ve done parts of it- it takes you through Westfall/elwynn and duskwood), before bringing you south of duskwood to Stranglethorn vale. It’s a great addon. I hope it brings you as much ease leveling as it did for me- I highly prefer to follow a guide and just cruise along its instruction so I don’t always need to be mapping out where I need to be going. Good luck friend. Let me know if you have any questions
---
My friend finally got his hoj at 87 runs. So there's still hope.
---
bruh
---
looks like Commander's Crest from sfk
---
I by no means think they can’t roll on it, but like you said cloth is bis for most of the game for pallys. Just want an equal chance to roll on gear that’s clearly just as good for my class. Or possibly even better considering crit and lack of good tier sets for pallys.
---
Traitor!!!
---
#2 rogue in dps charts out of 6 rogues and also the only rogue without epics 3 weeks in. I can’t ever roll more than a 26.
---
I thought the red bar would be all of the AoE/cleave spells!
---
Did you not talk to him again and get the staff?
---
LOL I do the same shit. If I know I’m going to die , I might as well get the mob kill for the quest and xp
---
Got both on my rogue in one run a few days ago. #feelsgoodman.
---
He said rely and meant relay
---
Gear will matter more than race till youre all wearing high tier raid gear.
---
Ability will always matter more.
---
Its true that UD brings very little to a warrior's kit, but in the end it just means youll itemize a little differently and will be a few % dps behind an orc in lab conditions (all else equal)
---
I am a dwarven rogue. Currently I'm level 44. I use a sword in my main hand, and a dagger in my off hand. I've invested my points in the Combat talent tree, so I'm pretty formidable in melee combat. I never rely on stealth to kill, I'm more of a in-your-face-explosion type of rogue.
---
While it certainly wasn't the right call if the priority wasnt decided beforehand, the sword does magically get better if a human uses it versus a gnome using it.

I've played rogue since tbc...I'm pretty sure I know the difference between garrote and rend &lt;3
---
LBRS and UBRS is in the same instance,so both are technically raids. But yes, LBRS is usually 5 manned.
---
Posting here to check later. I too have a fondness for that.
---
&gt; Your logic makes no sense, considering people spend far more time 'farming' for gold and not making anywhere near this amount while putting in about 200x more effort. 
---
That 'farming' is still playing the game, and people have fun killing mobs/questing/instances. I know very few people that actively enjoy sitting in front of the AH and just buying/selling.
---
&gt;And no, you cannot make similar amounts with Mithril casings, i have tried. You say you've made 100g on casing, im saying ive made 1300g on Thorium. I've probably spent like 1 hour more than you have in the AH....
---
Like I said, it varies from server to server and I'm sure your server is different to mine.
---
My total time on the neutral AH is probably &lt;10minutes, so I really doubt that.
---
It’s always done that.
---
That’s one of the worst raid (classic/vanilla) advice I’ve seen. Prot pots lasts for 1h, you use it before the pull, so you will have the protection and be able to use a healing pot during the fight, hell even bandages are supposed to be used in some fights. Again: &lt;3h run or 4h+ with pot money sink into repairs, your raid leader choice.
---
Always thought the normal rams were ugly, but the epic rams were badass.
---
I have been alone the entirety of classic #feelsbadman
---
See the thing is i hate LFG, but only because of the fact that it teleports you, if i didn't teleport i honestly would not have an issue with it being in classic, it's literally just an automated trade chat spammer but without actually flooding up channels, and automatically deals with finding roles.
---
This should be top comment. 
---
This post was probably botted up to try and knock some anti-China material off the front page.
---
Angerforge/arena runs are what you probably need.
---
Yeah man, because 2 people taking out an elite with adds are totally going to be at full health and mana when the elite is almost dead.
---
I think it's pretty metal. Looks like you beat an alliance soldier on the battlefield and stole their shield as a trophy.
---
Or you just bought it off of the AH.
---
70 hours!? fuck my life i wouldn't go that far for 2% more attack speed
---
Many classes are missing a ton of useful skills until BC.
---
I think you are missing the point which sort of proves your lack of understanding the class. You are sacrificing int which could give you extra blizzard spells for an absolutely trivial amount of damage. I would rather have 6 blizzards at 30 damage per tick then 4 at 33 damage per tick. You just proved his point beyond a shadow of a doubt.
---
mace, legs, hands, and wrist i think
---
xtra pop compared to og vanilla is problem too /
---
You're probably thinking of [Aegis of Stormwind](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1203/aegis-of-stormwind) which is pretty legit for a BoE blue at that level. I'm using one at 57 myself.
---
The [Commander's Crest](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6320/commanders-crest) from SFK looks like OP's (a square shield instead of kite shield) but it's golden, so I assume OP has a [Knight's Crest](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7465/knights-crest)
---
Currently leveling my first classic character, a Priest. I'm level 54, specced shadow, and will be switching over to a more healing centered build when I start raiding with my guild. I, also, have a level 26 Rogue that I've enjoyed a bit of, but am kind of... luke warm towards.
---
That said, I want to try something different, but I can't figure out what. I want to avoid Mage, since half the server is mages and I'm kind of meh on it. Warlock seems interesting, and since I have 300 tailoring, gear wouldn't be an issue.
---
That said... There's a massive needs for tanks, so... Warrior?
---
But then there's PvP, which will likely be very mage-oriented, so maybe Hunter? Hmm.
---
Or, fuck all that and roll a Pally, since we only have 4 of them out of my 5 friends, and having a 5th would mean we could Pally-around everywhere.
---
Just log out and in again.  People were reporting issues with things not being in their bag and when they logged out and in it was fine.
---
Who says hella?  Now that I started playing classic instead of retail I see so many people saying it so much!  
---
You do you but it drives me nuts!
---
it is 5. 
---
You walk into your groups instance at start, thats 1
---
2 resets after that means you did 3. This is to be safe. Push it to the limit, you might be upset.
---
I think your memory is flawed, sorry.
---
I wouldn't because it's a waste of time for you exp wise
---
I only started healing dungeons at 58, just did quests in the dungeons to level to 60. Try avoid using LHW anyway it's mana inefficient.
---
 Fellow warriors over 40: im 42 arms spec using whirlwind axe and just picked up sword of omen and hand of righteousness. Seems like could be great for DW with a few % hit gear even without respeccing. Thoughts?
---
Kromcrush?
---
Meet desertlectics, my durotar locked ultimate troll mage
---
Yeah, that's what I'm guessing, too.
---
Better off leveling and not going into a healing spec yet. It’s only a few levels, don’t make it hard on yourself and your group.
---
This is not the best way to do it, it is such a waste of time going into the corner and waiting every time. For starters, it can take up to 2 minutes of spamming the macro for him to show up, do you expect a fresh 60 pug to have a stopwatch out timing this? As a rogue and druid you can simply just stealth up to the door and you'll be able to see if he is there instantly, none of this sitting in the corner.
---
Every class can in some way efficiently get to the door to check, hunters ( eye of beast or perhaps far sight), mages can blink through the middle of first packs and wait for the pat to check, warriors just simply just run up and tank /hamstring kite, priests mind vision or MC, pally can bubble .
---
Also, you said you normally only do two resets.  On the solid chance you don't get jed in those 2 resets, by the time you finish your first run, you will have been in 3 instances, and then if you go check twice again and fail, congrats you are now locked. Even if you are only looked once after the first run and failed, you are getting locked after that 2nd run. This is assuming you are looking for jed before you actually have the full raid there ready to go.
---
It is better for everyone to only do 1 reset, then once everyone has looked once, you all go look again.
---
Because some of us are good at PVP and don’t lose engagements.
---
I found [one](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F264471557029) on eBay but it’s in French...
---
iirc you have to kill the last boss
---
Thank you for having foresight and objectivity in moderating this matter
---
I've been in and run guilds with various loot systems over the years (dkp/epgp/loot council). LC can be done fairly, I've been on both sides (a raider and a council member) of good loot distribution, and on the bad side of bad loot distribution. You really have to understand the raid, progression, and guild members as a whole to be able to loot council well, most people can't.
---
OP's post sounds like a nightmare, get out while the gettin's good.
---
Maul has a threat modifier that increases the threat of not only the additional damage, but the threat of the auto attack as well. Swipe does not.
---
Equality in this game.
---
LOL.
---
Never was such a thing to be broken in the first place.
---
Honestly, it won't be a problem. 
---
Some super uptight guilds may care, but it wont' affect much. 
---
Winter's Chill is a 1 off. Frostbite should be fine unless there's a mob that needs to be constantly moved.
---
Are World Epic loot drops more common is some area than others? Im lvl 54 and I have yet to see one drop for me, although I have gotten like 4 BoE blues. Another guildy, who is barely lvl 30 has already gotten 3 epic world drops, one being staff of Jordan. Are some people more lucky than others are there any factors that make the loot drop faster? He tells me he has some ritual he does before he goes out to farm and lvl, but he doesnt say what that ritual is.
---
Fury warriors shit on warlocks regardless of race, Deathwish + the damage output are the primary reason.
---
You'd only ever use wotf if the fight lasts longer than 50s.
---
Oh boy, the exact same video again!
---
Also, the higher level the enemy is than you, the higher chance they'll resist abilities and parry/dodge/block
---
Sorry, I’m ESL and read your reply incorrectly.
---
You are right about that.
---
So you think people wont want to make 50g a day by spending 15 mins in an AH because its not enjoyable?
---
Then. don't. do. it.
---

---
Ahh ok thanks
---
You seem like a shitbag.
---
There’s obviously nothing wrong with being a 13yo White girl you nincompoop. I’m criticizing the way OP writes.
---
I'm playing my warrior in exactly that manner. Full protection build, good shield, pull mob, alt-tab. Return few minutes later, Shield Slam, bom-bom.
---
There is no way anyone would agree the game "forces" you to do this. Hell, not only did I never do a dungeon twice while leveling, I don't even know anyone who did, apart from this spellcleave group who leveled exclusively in dungeons. Stop making shit up.
---
Sell Savory Deviate Delights and Giant Growth elixirs, those are very popular (especially for Tauren), aren't too hard to obtain mats for (just go to Barrens and fish at the oasises near Crossroads and WC) and are almost never supersaturated because making them requires leveling fishing AND cooking (which is too much trouble for most).
---
Even selling the various oils from fishing is decent money since Alchemists need them
---
So even if i run LBRS as 5 man the XP will be bad compared to say BRD?
---
1.5g for a blackvenom knife if im not mistaken about the english name.Since almost every rogue went combat daggers were pretty cheap at the start in the server but I must say that was a bargain even compared to the others.
---
He's fucking with you.
---
There's nothing you can do for world drops. It's the lottery. If he has 3 world drops before 30 he should play the powerball.
---
Where’s here?
---
Whitemane player spotted
---
It does give you a benefit though.
---
It does.
---
No, as long as you stay a five man group and don't convert to raid you'll be fine.
---
The item clearly says that warriors and rogues can use the item so you won it fairly.
---
There is indeed a hidden additional threat modifier on Maul, higher than even that Heroic Strike.
---
And bear form doesn’t list a threat modifier.
---
Blizzard punishing bad consumerism
---
AV is easy way out, normal wolf's are cooler as a cow.
---
Figure it out yourself?  There's no way someone can tell you without doing the legwork for your server for you.  
---
Look up a 1-300 engineering powerleveling guide, put the items in a spreadsheet, and go to the AH to get prices.  Total it all up and there you go.
---
Again, if it wasn't explicitly stated at the start, it was ninja'd.  Don't enable it by defending shitty behavior.
---
Dunno if it was mentioned but nathanos in plaguelands sometimes throws bone for one of his hyenas it fetches it :3
---
Nope.
---
Lets you do everything the same as everyone else, five times.
---
You don't get 5x the xp, you don't get 5x the resources, you don't get 5x the gold, it's nothing but downsides.
---
Ah ok cool :)
---
Seems like it's not the game for you. Mid 30s is like 35-40 hours of play. You've played less than an hour per day?
---
I think you missed the point, but enjoy your thread
---
Oh I don’t doubt there are pvp communities in the Horde that take themselves too seriously and play like assholes. Poor sportsmanship isn’t faction specific, and I wasn’t trying to say it was. Of course choosing your battles carefully is something every raid group does, and as a leader in a pretty large Horde pvp community, I’ve seen toxic bullshit from horde players too, but my community specifically doesn’t really tolerate it. I was really just throwing a bit of shade at a few specific groups who pride themselves on their “tough and valiant” image (the mount is their identifying “uniform”, though it’s not always the snowy gryphon) who regularly spam toys to crash servers (and brag about the “victory” on Twitter) and recruit two full raids to jump on groups of like 35 but will actually run when they catch wind of a similarly sized group approaching (and then return later when they’ve recruited more.)
---
It matters enough for some people to plan a route around it which this guys trying to do
---
Isn’t there a main thread for this? I’m so sick of them clogging my feed on reddit.
---
I'm sure you can find a good guild of people on the server somewhere. Just go without a guild for a while while trying to run dungeons for your pre-raid BiS. If you run with a cool/fun group of people and you see they're in a guild together... see if you can join. Or maybe people will ask you to join while you're running with them. This is how I found my guild. Entering into a guild after actually interacting with some of the members usually results in a better experience than just seeing a recruiting message and getting an inv.
---
Shoutout to the tooth nerds
---
The best way? No. It's the easiest way, that anyone can do.
---
Now you’re gonna get bullied
---
Not the same as everyone else if you're doing it five times, is it?
---
in wow, /macro is allowed. thats multiple actions with one press of the button
---
I prefer 1h and shield for the defense and I personally enjoy faster attack speed than slow weapons. I'm also a shammy tank so kinda biased, but when I hit 20, I didn't like the added damage I took without a shield.
---
Traitor!
---
With equal gear, maybe.  The gnome could have better gear to make up for the +5 swords, and it would be a bigger dps increase for him.  Race alone means nothing.  If you think that being human makes up for gear and skill, you are not playing the same game.
---
Not their problem you don't feel like finding four other characters for your group.
---
It's so disappointing to me that this is the kind of stuff people actually believe is optimal. I'm level 38 enhance spec up to flurry and parry, using hypnotic blade with flametongue weapon, and I do actually use lightning bolt for every pull... I've been tracking my damage, I have average 98 dps with enough spirit that I have literally zero down time, haven't even carried water in my inventory for the last 2 levels, and lightning bolt accounts for 25% of my total damage dealt.
---
&gt;Another guildy, who is barely lvl 30 has already gotten 3 epic world drops, one being staff of Jordan. 
---
Yeah I doubt this... It's a level 35 item and usually drops off level 40~ monsters. 
---
If your guildie is just hitting 30, he's probably nowhere near a level that he can find it unless he's being carried through areas by a higher level.
---
Warriors have instant attacks, stances and a *whole lot* more combat utility than paladins. I definitely average more than 1 action per gcd because stances are gcd independent
---
both classes lvl extremely well, just start one of each and you’ll probably make up for your mind on the journey to 60. personally id say lock is “stronger” but the folks who like hunter can be pretty passionate about it so who knows
---
Take the L, rez buff and hunt them down. Ofc the 5% gank is scummy but calling in a raid to handle 2 guys? Zzzzz next
---
all rogues deserve to die. If they don't now, they will later
---
Heh. Annals.
---
I've mostly quested in Tanaris and spammed ZF when I was at that level. You're just a tad too low level for Hinterlands yet, maybe SoS+Badlands+some ZF should put your around 48, where you can then spam Hinterlands (and get that bis trinket).
---
The Chromaggus xbow has abysmal drop rate... It could be far into Phase 3.
---
If that wasn't clearly stated in the loot rules before the raid then this deserves a report for sure and hopefully Blizz takes action. If it was, then not sure why you're complaining ... you knew the rules.
---
Tank runs and create groups of people who won't need your bis gear. As a tank we have this special privilege to make sure if our item drops we get it.
---
Exactly there’s only a couple pieces out of mc I need and I’m not allowed to get them. But hey you seem like a really smart person that’s extremely capable of having a civil discussion on the topic. Thanks for the insight champ.
---
So then it's a benefit for him.  
---
I need to find four other people.  He doesn't.
---
What the fuck Blizzard?
---
Epic BoEs are exceedingly rare and expensive. The line of thinking is that everyone could "use" the high amount of gold you'd earn from selling it, so everyone needs.
---
I think it's dumb and defeats the purpose of Need/Greed rolling, but that's just me and I don't make the rules.
---
Sure, that's great, but have you tried going back to the low zone and one-shotting all the level 9 mobs that used to gank you?
---
That great!
---
&gt;So for frost mage, would there be an issue with raiding with a more PVP focused talent spec?
---
Nah, we have AP + POM frost mages and they do fine.
---
Just don't blow your cooldowns at the start and grab aggro.
---
&gt;Does every mage need winters chill or just a few? 
---
Only one in the raid needs it, no one else does.
---
&gt;Would also want to grab frostbite but wasn't sure if randomly freezing mobs would cause problems for some fights or not.
---
You won't be freezing monsters in MC, they're immune to most CC.
---
Lag even for just one second, then your blink doesnt go off immediately, and you hit the ground dead before blink goes off :)
---
In EQ2 the crafting stations would sometimes kill you.  But that was by design, before they wussed out and changed them.  They also used to have trapped boxes which could kill you.  Good times.
---
Sorry about your flask!
---
The goblin ah? As in gadget or bb? How are they close to the hand in for scholo key?
---
I had this kind of frustration until I realised that I wasn't actually in any rush to finish anything.   Then it didn't matter if I needed to kill Y but we were killing X for someone else's quest.   We were playing together and that's what was fun, not how fast we could gain XP by rushing around and trying to be efficient.
---
Ah kiddo, you are being delusional again.
---
The only correct way to do loot is MT&gt;Offtank&gt;Class Round Robin&gt;Pugs/Alts

---
Please provide a larger sample size of player opinions.  I'll wait.
---
Guilds and discords are anecdotal.
---
Before any changes are made, we need an in game, per account vote. That will ensure that the circlejerk is minimized.
---
Alright big guy, not everything can be everyone's cup of tea, but this comment is just unconstructive and unnecessary
---
I don’t roll need on items I cant use immediately if it’s an upgrade for someone who can wear it immediately.
---
I don’t expect reciprocity in a pug; but it’s my rule.
---
LOL! Sounds like he didn't pick a very good spot to stealth. Usually you pick a spot right up against geometry or something out of the way so you reduce chance of players or npcs pathing into and discovering you.
---
&gt;never seen horde do that shit just sayin
---
Yeah must be pretty fucking new to the game then.
---
Just did these
---
Is this a bad thing?
---
You have options:
---
* Lawbringer
---
* Helm of the Lifegiver
---
* Wild Growth Spaulders
---
* Salamander Scale Pants
---
* Aurastone Hammer
---
+ You are the only class who can make use of Malistar's Defender
---
The other cloth pieces are more caster anyway so I don't see why you care so much.
---
I play Shaman and there is nothing cloth in MC that I would take, leather and mail is fine at the moment. Issues will arise if you have  many druids in your raid, which is a rarity as they're the least played class.
---
You can't get the loot without the other 39 people that are in the raid ultimately the loot council is trying to distribute gear so everyone gets something, maybe you should leave if you don't like it so much that you have to post about it on forums
---
Was looking at all the replies to see if I could tell which ones were bots
---
No, no political posts on a subreddit for a video game.
---
Warrior + any healing class is always a good choice
---
"just becoming a grumpy old man who is behind the meta streamer curve that seems to control the minds of the community?!? 
---
No you're right. Years ago we would've ganked those idiots untill they left the game and nowadays everyone sucks their dick for some kind of reason.
---
The orange ones, Flask of Supreme power, these give 150 +damage and healing for 2 hours, persists through death.
---
The pink ones are Arcane Elixirs and give 20 + damage and healing for 30 minutes not as good as the upgrade version that give 35 for an hour, but are a fraction of the price so I like them ,will probably bring a few greaters for Rag this week.
---
The blue ones are Mana Potions, they costs 2-3g a pop on my server but are nice for longer fights when mana gems and evocation isn't enough.
---
The red ones are fire resistance potions. similar to the pink ones these are the cheaper options, but with fire ward and ice barrier I haven't been having an issue.
---
Lastly, i'm missing bandages but hadn't gotten around to maxing it out at the time I took this but since have and carry 2 stack of heavy runecloth with me.
---
My Undead Rogue loves to eat happiness-spreading gnomes like yours. Very tasty.

I've kind of had this suspicion hes just doing it for attention. Says he has like 200g already saved up on his alt bank. He does always like to "one up" others on discord whenever someone is excited about something dropping for them.
---
MADNESS!
---
That cleavage daym!!
---
Buy them before DM comes out
---
Hey man,  do we stay in Berserker stance all the time? because you can't use overpower and rend in Berserker stance. even though that build  you linked says put points in those, plus ww is only berserker..im confused and its totally my fault
---
Oh yes, I find a dull part in the game and it must not be the game for me....right.
---
Yes it's the game for me. I played since 2005 yada yada. It was the same thing back then when you hit the mid-30s you have to go all over the place and there's no distinct zone just to stick with like you did the first 30 levels.  
---
Your estimations to get to the mid-30s is super subjective...
---
Also so far 5 1/2 days played....
---
HS/Cleave so not only are you spending rage but you also miss out on your would be AA's rage generation

Yikes dudes. If you want people to support you, you probably shouldn’t have a trolling response.

If a Rogue is on your faction, just be glad he's not your enemy. He can't kill you.

Bro get off reddit you're supporting China by using it you commy scum. Absolutely disgusting. Best dump that Chinese made phone too

At least i wouldnt want to blame the people actually make it if that had happened lol

They're crooks!
---
Its pessimistic attitudes like yours that are the reason why nothing gets done. Putting people down for doing what they are comfortable doing is going backwards, and is far more damaging to the cause than sharing without caring. There is no argument otherwise.
---
I've heard people mention that the numbers we see are rounded but the actual values are to like 3-4 DP, so it's something like two people rolled and one got 99.9923 while the other one got 99.9852 or something like that.
---
Nah. Other guild leader full of crap. A social guild in a social game can thrive. You sound like you're building a guild for longevity and relationship rather than bursting through content. There isn't one set formula for a successful guild man. Sounds to me you're doing great and if you're concerned ask guildees in chat or on discord their view, it's their opinion that matters, not this dudes
---
He is paying an equal amount of money to have equal number of characters.
---
Are you trying to argue 5 characters are more powerful than 5 characters?
---
I don't "have" to coordinate with my friends when I'm in a group with them, I do so because I'm playing a game with my friends.
---
lllllllllllloooooossssssseeeerrrrrrr
---
i MEAN... you Can pug lol...
---
Id main a paladin if they weren't so boring to level. Like, two buttons, thats all you get
---
Really depends on how fast your group clears. for ratio id say yes. Also a lot of people here (the angsty ones) are upset at me not having the premium version of the pots but its adds up. thats 100g for the flasks, 15g for the mana, 10g for fire pots and 10g for arcane. so 145g of mats. yes we are mages and can farm fairly quickly. but when you are raiding, trying to get gear from dungeons, trying to level an alt, and trying to spend less time playing than when you were leveling, 145-150g for a raid or two can get pretty pricey. so try to use cautiously.
---
Yeah but if magic can keep their joints together then surely it provides them strength of some amount.
---
People like you are the reason I don't visit this sub too often.
---
No, you absolutely couldn't. Exploits/cheats are against the ToS. Spy, for whatever reason, isn't.
---
That's a horrible strawman, and comparing an addon that scans combat logs to detect players within render distance to any actual exploit or cheat program is asinine.
---
There were plenty of guilds that were still working on clearing BWL when TBC released. Don't worry about MC right now, worry about the environment you have for your guild. Especially since BWL isn't coming to classic any time soon.
---
You don't have to break out of it, there's nothing wrong with having several lower levels characters instead of a 60. 
---
Honestly I think hitting the cap is overrated. Other than raiding, there's really nothing you can't do at lower levels that you can do at cap. I play WoW for the wPvP, BGs, Dungeons, and exploration. I would rather enjoy variety than focus on farming best in slot gear.
---
Do you have any guides for setting up different classes? ie warr/shammy?
---
That appears to only be for Microsoft products, it's not a universal way to type the character.
---
I got HOJ first time running BRD as 52 WAR.  Rogue was pissed and said its Bis pulled a mob then quit lol.  I was like its Bis all melee DPS.
---
Was i downvoted?  I dunno, was just a joke cause he's not a rogue :D
---
Like i said before, if that's what you choose to take out of what i said, then theres not much else to do here. You seem to have your mind made up already. Enjoy being close-minded.
---
I’m envious.
---
Weapon skill helps with glancing blows. You get glancing blow on mobs 3+ levels higher than you. On mobs which are only two level higher than you or less it just adds little extra chance to hit, crit, lower dodge, lower parry. Because of this weapon skill is most usefull agaist raid bosses and not much else.
---
For weapon skill to be usefull agaist everything you would need single item with atleast +10 weapon skill.
---
WotF is redundant for a warrior (especially fury), literally the only new perk it adds is the ability to break seduce.
---
as a horde, type "j o a a f" in /say, trust me
---
Kurinnaxx
---
The world is full of people who think everyone else is shit compared to them.  You ran into one of those.
---
&gt;Rogues will still slap any class silly blindfolded if driven by a half-decent player with cooldowns.
---
You are delusional if you really think that is true. Nothing more to say.
---
As far as I remember not a single rogue spec was ever banned from any classic or private server 1v1 tourney that I am aware off.
---
Engineering, flasks and special trinkets/items dont count as an argument because any class can use them so theirs no way to determine who will win
---
Their are enough specs in the game that are extremly hard to beat as a rogue and a lot where its a uphill battle to win for a rogue. Without trinkets right now you cant beat some specs no matter what you do, exept when you use trinkets, engineering etc.. but like I said every class can use them.
---
I mean you are free to upload duels where you consistently win against stuff like shadow priests, sl locks or feral/restro druid hybrids with your rogue to convince me that I am wrong.
---
Didn't notice a resto mace in BRD could u share links/names of these items would like to try obtain them myself
---
[This one](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19120). Preraid bis for all melee, including tanks. You get it with the horde elite quests taking place in Jintha'alor, more precisely the one where you need to kill 20 of each type of elite troll.
---
How is using the info in the game cheating?
---
Try it out for a month. It’ll only run you $15 and you can decide if you want to keep playing or not.
---
I think with this much popularity though,  he won't make everyone happy. Especially with all the fan theories out there.  Their will always be better theories so it'll be hard to match that.  I feel bad to a degree but it's all self inflicted.
---
No, he's paying five times as much as they are each paying.
---
Paying $75 makes him as powerful as five people all on his own.
---
&gt; Are you trying to argue 5 characters are more powerful than 5 characters?
---
No, I'm saying that one human player shouldn't be able to pay extra to be equivalent in power to multiple human players.
---
Probably not more than a human, though. But someone more into the anatomies in the lore would know better than me.
---
Yeah he’s in the picture.
---
Hard pass, I'm a good tank but I don't enjoy the brain dead dps that don't understand how Classic threat works and won't give me more than half a second to hit the mob, and the healers that don't want to dispell.
---
"Yes I said i'll buy a cat..." "Cat not for sale good day sir!"
---
According to wowiki it’s a hidden second roll, but honestly, this makes more sense and is what I assumed happened.
---
Thanks for just laying it out. I'll stop wasting my time on what he said
---
Oh, in the silent bid systems I know of you usualy paid the DKP of the 2nd highest bid.
---
Until endgame, you don’t need a tanking spec or really gear for it. At most (and it’s not even required), you just throw on a shield. It doesn’t even have to be a good one, a grey you picked up would do.
---
That excuse is just as bogus as people requiring warrior to always tank.
---
Tell them to wait, or enjoy the aggro
---
Just made him! Any guilds you’d recommend? I’m pretty casual but I love love love PVP
---
Thanks for the explanation. 
---
I thought it was obvious that a Druid can’t stay feral for raiding. Our guild already has 4 druids at 60 that have been raiding for two weeks. I may have to leave for a diff guild to get a raid spot!
---
So it’s okay if I decide to go heals and roll on prefigured cloth? Or go boomkin and roll on mage gear? I don’t recall any of this happening back in vanilla. I knew of some holy Paladins rolling on priest cloth but that was accepted, not warriors rolling on leather. I can understand the reasons for it, but if I’m basically forced to heal end game and can only wear leather, then I think it’s unfair to rolling against a shaman.
---
Kinda yeah, you can push for more dps by using abilities but then you need to drink more often so it's not worth it.
---
It's pretty funny that paladin have so many abilities but most of them are so specific you almost never use them.
---
Queue to your moms house
---
Just go to the AH and look up shadow dmg gear
---
50/50
---
Didn't it go to the mage class leader? 
---
Also my main points still stand. The GM told people to stfu, and the hunter class trainer was giving himself loot that even the officers didn't understand.
---
Only wear wool socks so I'll take your node; also bring on the watee.
---
Thank you. Yeah we place a heavy focus on guild environment, I'll keep doing that.
---
Does "heaven" even exist in WoW lore? 🤔
---
Fuck loot council honestly. I dont understand where this shit suddenly came from. I cant remember any of it being in Vanilla whatsoever. Is it a retail thing?
---
They literally cannot ban this.  It parses information your client readily receives.  They would have to take away chat log information from players to make the addon stop working.
---
Even if they did that your client still receives packets with information of where other players are.  Even if they could stop an addon from getting that by default everything has been reverse engineered to the point we could still pull the incoming information that cannot be gotten rid of.
---
No I get if you're already stacked up on melee dps you do need ranged. But when I see them LF2 or LF3 DPS I know I never got answered cause they just dont want gear competition
---
I am an officer of a very similar guild. No you are not doomed. Just a couple things I would recommend for you are:
---
\-Set a date of when "Guild raids" will start. This gives players that are 60 a realistic timeline of when you will actually be going to MC and may prevent them from thinking "oh we are never going since we don't have enough people". Even if you set it for a month or 2 out, stick to it and form a raid at that time. MC/Ony can be easily pugged so fill any spots that are not filled by the guild with pugs. 
---
\-Make relationships with other guilds of similar size. It is very common for smaller guilds to partner to do raids. Talking with other GMs on the server is a great way to organize these. Honestly don't be afraid just to /who a guild, whisper a random person and ask who their GM is, and strike up a convo.
---
this is that real, wholesome shit  
---
You mean products that are not Windows itself? Oh, okay. The US keyboard seem extremely limited. I can even type the Spanish ñ with ease.
---
Thats what i was looking for, thanks. But i am EU and cant post in US forums. Hope they will integrate this section also in EU forums.
---
It drops in shadow fang keep. My SO aka pocket tank rocked it on his NE warrior for a while. It looked great.
---
Right! It went from being a major fascination to something i regret ever being into.  Like NKOTB or Milli Vanilli......
---
Take this advice from a former guild leader in classic who quit on his guild when we only had 20ish dedicated players.
---
You go down with the ship but you better not be the reason it sinks. This guy is being an "elitist jerk" which good for him and his guild that they were able to clear 15 year old content and rush to 60. For some its great and trust me there is a silent minority of us who are still 40s and enjoying the slow progression.. it's not a fucking race anymore it's been done. Keep your head held high mate you have a very active and very young guild. These times are crucial- find a couple of members who you see day in day out logged in but also being friendly and helpful in guild chat. Recruit these people as your officers and learn to rely and trust in them. Fuck what other people think man do you and build that guild up.
---
PVP is not a main spec.
---
Ravager is about a 15% drop, inviting a DPS warrior can be the difference in me reasonably expecting to get it in 10 runs vs 20 runs. I prefer to be Ret but I go Prot so I can make it easier to gear myself and my friends, you can do the exact same.
---
Aggro in classic is much different it is not only the tanks job to generate aggro but the DPS's job to watch their own aggro. Ask them nicely to hold off if they are pulling off constantly.
---
Not with the healer going OOM after every pull.
---
The shaman absolutely can roll on leather or cloth healing shoulders. He is the healer. He gets priority in healing drops. No DPS player should roll need on healing shoulders regardless of what spec they play or plan to play down the road. 
---
Now, if you clearly state your intention to roll on healing gear as a feral Druid, and the party agrees, then sure, you can compete. Guild groups will often agree as they want to gear you out for raids and not for content you are clearing now. PUGs may or may not agree. Keep in mind that if you roll on healing gear, you have to only greed on any feral gear another Druid/rogue/DPS warrior may want. 
---
All this is subject to change of course if the party agrees to it. Sometimes you play an off spec in a dungeon to fill the group. If you state up front you are rolling on X gear, the party will often be fine with it. Just keep in mind that most parties will expect you to only compete for gear for one spec (you can roll on healing gear as a feral DPS with party approval but not on DPS gear unless no other DPS wants it). 
---
TLDR: You were right to pass. The shaman was right to need. Barring an agreement otherwise, healer gets the healing gear over DPS. This is true regardless of what you plan to do later or even what spec you are. Your role in the dungeon or raid determines what you can need on UNLESS the party agrees upon other terms (guild groups often will).
---
The loot rules were MS &gt; OS, bindings not reserved. They didn't follow their own loot rules, people are right to be upset.
---
If you are a really, really good tank (no fury prot) or doing the fury prot thing with a personal elite healer, I'd let you reserve all the orbs for an easy run. You'd have to establish your reputation as a top tier tank for me to give up all the orbs but the first one. 
---
Dire Maul 2-man could be another option, but most of the healing classes can solo the lashers too.
---
I wish you decided on picking flowers instead of skins. Oh well.  It would very time consuming to level flower picking now even with a mount.
---
How much does it really matter that some players are sitting on a fat stack of gold in the scope of an entire server? How much does it matter that they bought their BiS BoE epics and are wearing them beyond the individual who bought it? All those items would still be out there, maybe just more spread out.
---
But realistically, they haven't had a drastic long-term affect on servers, and when by the time phase 3 rolls around, it won't even matter that they had that early game advantage.
---
Yeah, we gotta use alt codes or copy/paste for all of those. I don't find myself using any accented characters very often though, so it's really not a huge detriment to us!
---
D. Revenge on the filthy blameaux horde is a point of pride. I like to imagine I am ruining their evening IRL.
---
At least the entire final season of Dexter wasn't a shitshow. I was of course disappointed with them throwing out 8 seasons of development with that ending but the final season as a whole wasn't terrible.
---
So you were tanking, and he was healing, and he took shoulders that were a main spec upgrade for him, while resto is  still your off spec? I'd say he rolled well within the lines, as they would just sit in your bags.   
---
Also pre raid bis for both healers are crafted from LW.
---
Watch em die lol
---
Tanks are the #1 thing people are looking for right now. Most of the predetermined main tanks are already 60 and covered in epics so finding a tank below 60 is harder than ever.
---
I’m not supporting this, I’m just explaining. There are a lot of pure dps classes out there that like to demand tanks, call tanks shitty, and refuse to give gear to fury warriors even though they absolutely refuse to level a tank. You picked a tough class for vanilla, and this won’t be the last time you are treated more like a commodity and not like a player.
---
I appreciate that. Yeah that's exactly what we are looking for. I'll keep going in that direction. Thanks for the encouragement
---
Current record holders (bipolar, Herod US) did their last two runs in like 54 and 53 minutes. It's getting pretty nuts already :p  
---
But I totally agree.
---
That's not how it works.
---
At this point everyone should just leave the chest alone and fuck off
---
Yeah, stick with one thing and say it over and over again. I heard that *definitely* makes it more correct.

---
Rules were apparently stated somewhere in a disc channel, and I obviously did not know of this incredibly stupid rule since i then would have opposed it, like i did after this happened and half of the guild with me.
---
Btw to answer your question im an ele/resto shaman and i started healing BRD at level 52, thats a perfectly acceptable level to heal the whole dungeon.
---
I've done 2 full runs which can take a few hours, and arena runs are the most common you usually go straight to arena kill the boss that spawns there then go to anger forge as he drops a BiS tank item then reset.
---
Yeah the first time around I just pulled an entire pack and almost wiped the raid because I couldn't build aggro on anything. You get kicked, disarmed, gouged and knockback.
---
That's how Loot Council works for the most part. LC is a stupid way to distribute loot but that's typically how it goes. I'd stay away from anyone doing LC and especially stay away from anyone saying "Shut the fuck up, clear comms, relax, you don't know shit about running a guild".
---
Doesn't matter what "you'd rather" what matters is that they didn't follow their own rules.
---
The sweaty dudes that are cancerous in this game are the reason wow has the incel gamer stigma. 
---
I just can’t wait till the mouth breathers go to retail.
---
Everyone demands you be 5 levels above minimum and follow some archaic form of dungeon crawling.
---
As long as shit dies you good. This game isn’t complex or even hard people just make it so by being elitists
---
Thanks buddy! I'm thinking about posting this in r/unpopularopinion lol
---
Yes sir! We do have good officers currently and what you just said is why I chose them to be our leaders ~
---
You can't draw a conclusion from that sample size, so your entire comment was worthless
---
As a lock with dot macros it’s difficult not to do that. A good lock however knows when to dot and when not to. 
---
Maybe ask them to use curse of reck. So they don’t have 3 dots on, and it helps with cloud control as the mobs will not flee. That is especially useful if the lock is higher level than you
---
Except he did say that...
---
That's amazing advice. I'll start long term plans with my leaders soon!
---
That happens, and can’t always be used as an excuse on your part. It could be the healer having little intellect on their gear, or using mana inefficient spells, or just spamming necessarily.
---
You’re right honestly I’m thinking rogues need a buff they’re actually pretty underpowered. 
---
Yeah, sure, eviscerate *scales*. With .15 AP. It’s basically still flat damage! It should scale 1:1 with AP. It’s only fair. 
---
Once trinkets come around... we’ll be completely useless!
---
What level are you? Sniping last hits with mind blast for spirit tap regg is not that easy to constantly pull off, but worth practicing for sure :b
---
I was doing some murloc quest in Swamp of sorrows. me being a ench shaman healing 4 warriors. We passed a lone human rouge opening a chest, letting him do his thing. Two minutes later we pulled a large pack of mobs and he ambushes me from behind, one second later all 4 of warriors intercept him and he dies within seconds. He ressed and tried to do same thing 2-3 times with same tactic and result.
---
&lt;insert le far cry 3 quote&gt; "Insanity (or stupidity) is doing the same shit over and over expecting things to change"
---
Not for healers... Not for tanks. Why are dps special and get priority for PVE and PVP loot?
---
It’s possible. Usually 60’s will want to start getting bis items and run those dungeons/raid. They end up sitting around trying to get a group. That’s when they might make the decision to leave. Because they have stopped if they don’t join a guild that’s raiding. Nothing worse then sitting around/always getting asked to help constantly without getting help
---
Disarmed is funny as I play druid, YOU CAN'T DISARM MY RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS!
---
But yeah the CC is pretty bonkers. I feel like popping a free action potion before charging in....
---
Depends on my mood and the situation. If they're a baby, I'm most likely going to leave them be. If I'm busy, I'll leave them be. I'm usually busy. WPvP stuff is fun sometimes, but I do have gold to make and mats to farm.
---
Mage with a warlock/shadowpriest helm, siiick.

When you’re questing do you get a lot of grief?

I'll be real. You're right, it's important to be real with my guild

That's irrelevant.

This is the type of post we need to see. Not this HK bullshit! That’s awesome man!

---
There's a decent guide, they have maps for each zone.
---
**EDIT**: changed link.
---
It's not just "okay", it's absolutely unavoidable. Look at some BiS pre-raid resto druid lists. Nearly all of the helms, chests, shoulders, and boots are going to be cloth. You might not remember this from vanilla because information and the fruits of thousands of theorycrafters wasn't as widely available, so the prospect of rolling need on cloth for a resto druid wasn't as well accepted. Today, I'd wager most folks have at least glanced at a guide or BiS list (especially with all the streamers using them like Bibles), so while you might get some rustled jimmies initially people should be more understanding than they used to be.
---
I would love to hear some ideas on this!
---
The culture in my guild is very much "literally never wait to dps anything" in 5/10 mans, to the point where I just don't even try beyond taunting, demo/BS spam, and keeping my 1 target. After that it's on them. UBRS is so bad that I won't tank it anymore. The first room with the runes to open the door, they just spam their heaviest AOE and it's impossible to hold anything.  
---
The game is officially saturated with retail players.
---
He also has a quest for his head as well. Its a pretty easy clear and fight. Did it 5 times today to try and help healer get 2nd wind. No luck. I pulled Savage Glad chest and HoJ though
---
Is farming manual crowd pummeler necessary if I want to go 0/30/21 HOTW spec for druid and off-tank in raids? Or can I get by as an offtank/healer without it?
---
I know it's necessary for main tank and definitely necessary for DPS, but I'm wondering if I would have to farm them as an off-tank for raids.
---
probably just ignore people like that.
---
You'll only start losing members if they expect something that's not going to happen, ie you promising to clear MC in x amount of time then never doing it.
---
I hope this is the only binding that drops for your guild.
---
All default :)
---
It all comes down to Wow karma
---
Typical alliance
---
good to know. Thanks. Ill just start linking Thunderfury every time he links something.

Although a lot of us are saying that we don't trust Activision to make changes.
---
Virtue signaling at its finest. Get any pussy from trying to shame your fellow gamers yet?
---
I want to mainly focus on PvP and casual raiding.  I don't have a ton of time to invest so I need to be able to get into groups easily.  I'm torn between Holy Paladin and DPS warrior (I don't enjoy tanking).  Which one should I pick?  The focus will be on PvP first and then raiding.  Like I said, not a ton of time to sit around the city looking for groups so getting into a PvP group, dungeon group/raid group quick is important to me.
---
Jesus your UI is busy
---
Been said many times, you primary responsibility as a tank is the healer, without the healer its a wipe. Save your taunt for this purpose, try and hold the aggro, but if you lose a mob to the lock, dont worry about it, 1 mob against a lock with a living healer is pretty safe, worse case its 1/3 or more dps down and the add will return to you, and if the lock is sensible, they will switch target and run to the tank to let you get aggro back, if they are not, well atleast the healer is still safe. 
---
Said before, but its on dps to watch aggro just as much as a tank to hold it, you pull it, your problem long as the healer is safe.
---
Either it happens or it doesn't.
---
That's where it gets sticky.  Priests can't use leather, mail, or plate.  So if those drop and have good caster stats, they're screwed.   Paladins can roll on it all, and priests can't, so to be totally fair, you want to make sure cloth wearers get a higher chance to get cloth gear.
---
As a rouge who goes AFK while questing frequently I agree with this statement.
---
It doesnt
---
Do you really have everything the game has to offer including fully maximized enchants and BIS in every slot? Are you topping the meters (if you're big dick DPS) or are you topping the decurses+heal meter+wipe prevention (if you're healer)? Do you have the mats already for Dire Maul craftables? Do you have enough gold for consumables for the next couple of weeks and preferably longer? Do you have a profession alt?
---
Oh a Pepsi Max?
---
They won't
---
You are just trolling. Do you seriously think any "naked rogue gank pvp video" says anything? Are you aware that their are also naked mage, lock or priest videos? Those videos are made to entertain not to proof anything.
---
No all the temples and churches and holy light stuff is based on NOT heaven.
---
I hold you personally responsible for that song being stuck in my head all night. Lol
---
I'm on Incendius, and when I checked serv pop about 2 weeks ago it was 50/50. Doesn't seem to a shortage of either in game, either.

Just be careful it doesn't impact school like it did for me at your age dude

False.

---
In what world are you living in that you think that a healer should be getting the "good cloth pieces" over dps??? Also if you have put in effort to get full pre raid bis and your leader is inviting people to raids in greens who have put in no effort, find another more dedicated guild.
---
Your system only works if everyone has similar levels of almost pre bis gear, as the loot will properly get handed out to classes it benefits more and those performing better.
---
I mean tanks are already tanky but I eont see why'd a healer or dps would pass up some big stamps piece of gear if they want to pvp
---
Hunter beastmaster with healing+ gear.
---
What a waste.
---
100% agree on a logical point of view. But as bad as that experience burned me it’s just not something I’ll ever trust again because of the
---
human factor. You can have the best leadership in the world and they can still make a bad decision here and there. I much prefer DKP because I can control my points and what pieces I’m all in on as priority dictates.

First 4 seasons are top top tier TV. Sadly it starts going down hill and ends in a dumpster fire.

Do you guys think kirtonos will hold its population?

Just because it ain’t an rp realm doesn’t mean you can’t have some goofy fun :)

A free action potion and some deadzone can do alot
---
I don't know why you are so salty through this entire thread. I think you missed where I said I am using it for PvE AND PvP. Literally using it to it's full extent. I just need to learn to aggro dump. Don't be so classless.

Naked mages are a classic, anybody who takes any of those videos seriously is a fool
---
I've been farming the sinew for fuckin days.
---
Had 4 Robe patterns drop, a couple dragonling schematics and all sorts of other crap.

Going to go insane before the sinew drops I think.
---
I'll try that out, thanks! Still wish it was on by default though.
---
what hit?
---
Just tell them it has winnie the pooh on it
---
No thank you.
---
I don't really understand the other responses to this comment, you're very right. If someone is over-bidding in an attempt to get you to waste your own dkp, just let them take it and teach them a very expensive lesson. I've actually used that to win games of Monopoly on property auctions. We both know how much money you have, you think I'm going to try to outbid you after you just wagered your entire savings? Good luck building a house on that lot, homie. Now I have the power to win every bid for the rest of the game for pennies on the dollar.
---
Then you are already there my friend. Raiding is just around the corner and with good people on your team you will prevail. Positive thoughts produce positive results. Cheers!

Had this happen yesterday crafting some level 24 blue mail chest piece. Deleted my WTF folder and it came back. Then just put my wtf folder back.

Yeah making a shitload of gold from the AH is beyond easy if you make that your focus. Plenty of addons to help with it as well.

Nice info I guess but it's no secret. Everyone knows it but very few bother to do it because effort.

So in your opinion only the 3 tanks should have been rolling for it? If so I’d say that’s a fair position to have I’m not disagreeing with you.

---
Proto Drakes are the closest to a Wyvern in WoW. Though they got the tiny T-Rex arms they look to be on their way out evolution wise.
---
60 seconds/4 second swings = 15 swings per minute. 
---
7 procs per minute/15 swings per minute =46.6 “chance” of proccing
---
A 4 second swing time weapon has a 46.6% chance to proc SoC with each swing, making it so 7 procs will happen in 1 minute. 
---
So what’s wrong?
---
What server is that? If your in oceania come to arugal
---
Holy hell Grats!
---
I went from priest to Hunter the first time through classic and it was a blast. It's amazing in PVP and pleasant to play and it's nice to be able to solo nearly anything. Plan ahead for keybinds, because you will need a lot of them. Get familiar with macros. I like scrollwheel for pet control, but to each their own. Don't forget to flare/trap friendly drinking healers when you pvp.
---
First 10 levels are slow and don't forget in classic you must train skills to your pet such as growl (the spell with the slingshot icon)
---
It’s pretty easy. My first foray in to mc was with a pug 4 weeks back, 34 people, handful of people under 60. Cleared to domo and had to stop due to no douses. 1.12 really fucked up balance for mc and probably bwl.
---
Ah so just a casual ;)
---
I don't mean to make excuses just venting.  :)
---
Rockbiter does more dps with a dagger than wf does.
---
Using Flamestrike + Blizzard and occasional Cone of Cold + Arcane Explosion with Ice Barrier is really safe and easy to do. Doing non stop Arcane Explosion isn't required or even recommended. I did this 2-3 days ago without demo shout. Mages specced into Blizzard slow makes tanks barely needed outside of pulling.
---
I’m around the same - as a first time wow player I feel like I’m doing something very wrong when I see people saying they hit 60 in 5-8 days played lol
---
the imp armor is what the footmen look like in WC3 that's where the confusing is coming from. so that's most likely what lordaeron guards looked like before arthas betrayed the king and the undead moved in making it the UC
---
Right here.  Try to keep your healer safe, and let the warlocks rez themselves when they die.
---
I healed UBRS at lvl 56 with a feral spec. Did 50% of the healing the other was a paladin lvl 60.
---
Ahh ya sorry didnt mean to insult retail players. Just an easy quip to throw out around here to people looking for participation trophies.
---
Go run LBRS I thought it was a good test for UBRS since it does step up difficulty from BRD. So once you ran that a few times probably 2-3 till you got it right you can think on going UBRS. Atleast that's my opinion.
---
And someone made a video on how to use the macro to scout for Jed Runewatcher. It was like 10sec long. Concise and to the point, something many need to learn.
---
"McCarthyism" refers to an unjustified/low evidence witch-hunt of ideological enemies. Which is a real thing that does happen, but in the case of McCarthy the unjustified/low evidence part is mostly a myth because the country might've fallen if he didn't act and his targets were later revealed to be quite accurate.
---
Ganking in BRM, you deserved it.
---
the female undead attack animations look sick though. that flip that do is pretty baller
---
Honestly warlocks are one of the highest sustain classes in the game..... so unless the mob is going to one shot them if it gets to them.... just let them tank it and life drain. They'll be fine.
---
That’s random enough to be believable.  I’d give the poor fella benefit of doubt.
---
Ahahahaha
---
with +24 intellect :F...that no one wanted in the run.
---
Pshhhh couldn’t be me
---
I must be. This has bothered me since Classic launched.
---
Religion does not imply heaven. See: Judaism
---
I mean if people play actively they should long be 60 even as casuals 
---
But I guess not everyone wants to play regularly 
---
I always saw those massive guilds as walking corpses doe
---
Ignore that guy doe Classic was designed a turkey for casuals at the time everyone who’s thinks classic is a hardcore mmo and prizes themselves on being able to fulfill time sinks and looks down on others bc they don’t should be ashamed of themselves 
---
Casuals can clear most content 
---
There’s no real difficulty it’s just all about being online regularly
---
This is my favorite spot to mind control alliance, a lot of people think UBRS is the best spot but this spot is underrated. The enemy is already at half health because they jumped in the lava to break the fall so when they turn the corner (where the MC portal guy is) they run into me where I mind control them and toss them into the farthest spot away from the ramp. If they manage to make it remotely close to the ramp I will be there waiting for them to fear them away from me.
---
I am your evil opposite.
---
Come on over, I would be happy to have Tauren in the Alliance where (let's all be honest) they really belong.
---
One strategy is to ask the group/healer if they are okay with "You guys burn skull, I'll tank X." If you choose Skull properly and the DPS is decent, then Skull will ping pong between targets and be dead with the healer hardly even needing to heal.
---
 I really think this would work because so far, as a Level 40 Disc/Shadow Priest, I've spent over 50% of my time/mana on trash pulls in Classic doing DPS anyway.
---
Another idea is to WHISPER the lok as early as possible and ask them not to DOT anything except Skull until "Skull gets to 40% HP". (This works better than "for the first X seconds because it's easy for them to see Skulls HP") In your whisper, include the reason. Doing it as a whisper makes them feel like you are working with them on a personal favor level, the opposite of calling them out publicly.
---
You understand that a lot of people (especially on pvp servers) raid so they can get gear for pvp, not to make guild runs 10 mins faster? So “not a main spec” argument doesn’t really work here. 
---
This is more than fair to everyone in the raid. The fact that randoms were even allowed to roll for the bindings in guild run is already beyond generous. 
---
Noone is saying that his guild is gonna drop everything that they were doing and start gathering resources to do TF for op. You can’t even do it in phase 1 iirc. Ofc any guild will prioritize its tanks to do it first once they get their drops. The raid leader absolutely made a correct decision here.
---
It was 50g on elysium back in the day.
---
&gt;Paying $75 makes him as powerful as five people all on his own.
---
You can't just look at his damage as 5x and say they are stronger.
---
They also take 5x more damage, require 5x the experience, get 5x the gold costs, require 5x the gear and everything that goes with it.
---
&gt;No, I'm saying that one human player shouldn't be able to pay extra to be equivalent in power to multiple human players.
---
One player controlling 5 characters will never be equivalent in power to 5 players controlling 1 character.  It's just not going to happen and undermines your entire argument.
---
Running into a 5boxer and running into a dungeon group is fundamentally no different.  You're still dead, the human players are just going to be way better at it.
---
Mages hate him.
---
If only those aoe mages weren't jerks and told people to pound sand when asking for a group, lol. 
---
If I see them doing that, I just come back later. It's a lost cause imo
---
Looks like it's possibly NeatPlates
---
Please don't use alliteration in a professionally produced document.

Play a non cookie cutter build. Destruction is much more fun

Distracting people off things is always comical.. but killing low level players? Really?

I think youre taking my post as a "well we arent leveling effeciently and need to do quest 1 2 3 in this order and this time window" which is not what I am talking about at all. I am saying that after a while, you kind of want to go at your own pace, be it slow and gathering every single plant/ore you run across, or just mindlessly grind, or fish, whatever. Its much harder to do that when you are worrying about what your friend also wants to do and their feelings on things.
---
I was planning on staying as 30/0/21 even at 60 i heard this should be fine for healing raids and dungeons?
---
Everyone here can tell that he was being facetious but a joke is still supposed to be funny, or at the very least clever. I'm not seeing either here.
---
Use to be everyone's responsibility for threat, omen was a must. You see a DPS high on threat you tell them to chill the f out
---
And then you price yourself completely out of the market.
---
Yes I don't see how this works well unless it's a heavily one sided server in which one faction isn't able to farm thorium on their own. Meaning the goblin ah is the way to balance that.
---
Or you actually prove your worth and put in the effort to improve your gear outside of raids, show up on time, bring consumables and optimize your performance in the raid.  
---
Last guild I was in that used LC, the guildleader actually usually took his loot as last and burned through a ton of cash on consumables to bring competitive damage to the raid. That guy was the prime example of a leader and inspired his guildies to go the extra mile.   
---
When done right, loot council is without question the best way to progress as a guild and it feels that much more rewarding when you acquire a piece of loot.
---
&gt;Undead Rogues are made to dismantle clothies.
---
Thats absolutly not true, two cloth classes are the worst thing a rogue can face 1v1 and the other one is really hard to beat.
---
Disc/Shadow is extremly in favour of the priest, Locks are in general good against rogues especially SL locks which is as close as it can get to a hard counter to rogues and mages its 50/50 depending on skill etc. Of course that means decent stamina on gear and not a gimped PvE spec.
---
Which cloth wearing class do you mean that is weak against rogues?
---
to be fair "mind over matter" does apply even to depression, the problem is most people dont have the "mind skills" to actually rewire their brain and pull themselves out of a negative place, thats why people need professional help, because they need to be taught how to make their mind triumph the matter, its one of the bonus of being an introspective loner, you eventually learn to deal with your problems and work your mind out of its laberyntian mess, but most people arent introspective loners, or introspective at all, so yes mind over matter its relevant, its just not as simple as the phrase makes it sound.
---
You need some mental help, my friend. Maybe move to China since you seem to care about this so much?  
---
Next week you'll be back to sitting at ur PC making useless comments on reddit, helping nobody. Keep pretending that you care, it's adorable.
---
They're just angry nerds who need to lash out.  I wouldn't worry about it
---
Do you happen to be into Diablo 2 Holy Grail list?
---
Agree emphatically. People who want the instant gratification are ruining their own experience. When some one defends some add on because it " makes life easier" they look ignorant. The reason being is the most fundamental state of reality, relativity. 
---
Happiness is results minus expectations. When you have to walk your ass across horde territory to get to sm, your expectations of getting there with zero altercations are small. When you succeed, bam, happiness. If your expectation is that you will magically appear at the instance then nothing short of a blowjob at the entrance is going to exceed your expectations. 
---
This can be observed in any situation in life but I think it's most obvious in a simulated environment like wow where almost everything is quantifiable.
---
Add ons like this are the slippery slope that will be the end of the world...
---
.. of warcraft
---
Okay cool, I figured that was the case for winters chill but nearly every site I look at has it for PVE build so wasn’t sure. Thanks!
---
&gt; You can't just look at his damage as 5x and say they are stronger.
---
You can though.
---
He hits the same button and does five times the damage I do.
---
&gt; They also take 5x more damage, require 5x the experience, get 5x the gold costs, and everything that goes with it.
---
Ignoring that this isn't entirely accurate, it's irrelevant.  He hits a button, he does more damage than I do.
---
The only reason he does more damage than I do is because he paid more money than I did.
---
&gt; One player controlling 5 characters will never be equivalent in power to 5 players controlling 1 character. It's just not going to happen and undermines your entire argument.
---
Good thing that's never been my argument then.  It's just something you made up all on your own.
---
My argument is that one human player shouldn't have the in-game power of multiple characters.
---
Notice how your first few replies in this thread are downvoted to shit?  It's because the majority of people disagree with you.  Take the hint.
---
Threatplates I think its called
---
Spread the word.
---
Well gee friend if it makes you happy I don't mind taking a little ghost hike every now and then!
---
The reason hate rogues is because they do what you just did... Or actually, most are nicer than you even. :|
---
&gt; I think you missed where I said I am using it for PvE AND PvP
---
That's not what you said...
---
&gt;  I don't think I'll be using them in PvE since it does pull a lot of threat
---
But whatever. Self justify it however you want. Ignore the responses that don't support what you want to do.
---
I believe WeakAuras can do that.
---
Great so you save time by running groups with at least 3 people who want the same item as you. Now your 11% droprate drops to 3.66%. Now instead of slowly doing groups with an 11% chance you get your item now you might get cucked out of your item multiple times in a row after running the dungeon literally dozens of times. I'll take the reserve.
---
I'd say wait. Almost all the mobs in UBRS are 58+ and the bosses are all 60+ so your low-level dps will be basically unable to hit anything. It's really meant for a full group of 60s but if everyone's communicating and decently skilled and know what to do then you'll probably be fine if everyone's at least 58.
---
Rockbiter and flametongue are comparable in damage output. I prefer flametongue personally just because it goes through armor. I believe rockbiter will outperform if you stack agi, because the damage added will be multiplied by your melee crit chance while flametongue does not get the same benefit. But I think overall it's a lot more effective to stack spirit on shaman. My melee attacks only account for 30% of my damage, if every point of spirit that I have was instead agility, I would have bigger white hits but my elemental damage would disappear, overall resulting in lower damage.
---
Fuckin awesome
---
Terrible ratio. You're better off selling your heavy leather and buying thick. At least on my server
---
The world where classic itemization sucks and cloth pieces are bis and the plate alternatives aren’t even worth using till naxx save a few pieces here and there. And I’ve never said I should be getting it over dps. Just a fair shot at it. How hard is this to understand? Also the guild themselves said they’d gear tanks and healers first
---
That’s some awesome stuff. You have a great mother. 
---
My mom and dad took WoW from me when I was a teenager because it had demons in it and they didn’t want me worshiping the devil.
---
Did you intentionally reference two diablo 2 runes there?
---
4 out of 5 dungeoneers approve this dungeon.
---
Runecloth must be extremely cheap on your server. I'm at 9000/11000, which means 23000 more rep at 50 rep per turn in, meaning 460 more turn ins. Is Runecloth less than 1g on your server or something?
---
Message the tank and then tell the DPS you set the pace. Few repair bills later they’ll understand.
---
I mean it's also just not a good idea to loot council in casual guilds.
---
Loved lain SO much
---
agi for crit also helps flurry
---
Your position is not logically wrong, but its the content which does not follow through with your reasoning. By releasing DM early, it helps casuals MONTHS in advance on pvp realms to avoid getting farmed for honor.     
---
If this was BWL or the honor system I would be in full support of what you are saying. But DM simply is not a dungeon where anyone is falling behind or not experiencing it with others being a detraction.     
---
At a certain point the rubber has to hit the road and extreme casuals who don't/can't spend time leveling be accounted for.
---
I'm really unfamiliar with weak auras, I've heard it can be complicated? I've never used it before.
---
Windfury gives an extra hit with 300+ attk power. 20% chance to get 2 hits in one is hard to beat. Attk power is just a bonus.
---
They didn't call in a raid to kill 2 people they were killed by two people so they murdered everyone looking remotely like those people in the entire zone. Seems pretty legitimate to me.
---
Thank you:)
---
Given that MS &gt; OS was announced, and they were not reserving them, that is the appropriate course of action.
---
You are literally cutting off the entire sentence. I said ". . .Unless I can manage to figure out that aspect." That is the completion of that sentence you cut off. I have been doing research and asking an old theorycrafter Rogue friend of mine how people managed this in vanilla and it's not particularly hard. You'll see in other comments I also stated that I was going to be using it for PvE if I could figure out how to do it. Apparently it is brain dead easy.
---
A disc or shadow at lvl 60 with good pvp gear and spec should almost always win against a rogue. Theirs no way a rogue can blast through shield and 5 or 6k hp and phys resistance bevor he melts to the dots.
---
Shamans use 1H and Shield. Unless they're Enhancement, then they use 2H. :-)
---
45% +- depending on how well you play
---
&gt;I think lvling becomes easier solo and 
---
Not if you're a warrior
---
There’s not really a quantifiable number, but it’s definitely better by a decent margin.
---
Yes. I am fortunate to have friends that have the same interests as me.
---
Yeah but enough to push the middle ground to an even 40.
---
Resto shamans wear mostly non mail for a good bit of progressive raiding in classic. They’re borderline clothies in some phases
---
Funny enough, when I first played I had a warlock and my parents didn't like it. But they just made me pick a different class.
---
Edit: but now I'm playing a lock with her. Oh how times change.
---
That's how I felt. I had so much fun for a month and a half with friends and the community but it got to the point where some friends got to 60 too fast and kept trying to Make me get on and play as much as I could and I got tired and stressed and finally said fuck it im gonna do something else and take a break. I feel alot happier now then I was grinding at 47
---
The other GM is full of sh1t and just wanted to gloat. Ignore him and enjoy the game with your guild.
---
&gt;Retail gets a ton of hate, yet somehow retail guilds run loot council pretty much exclusively. If classic really is about the community, why is there always so much bullshit surrounding loot?
---
Loot is far more scarce in classic, which is what makes tensions surrounding it higher. In retail is practically a given that every player starting raid B will be fully kitted out in gear from raid A, given that they started raiding raid A as soon as it came out. That is absolutely not a given in classic.
---
And I think you're misunderstanding something, "about the community" does not imply there is no drama or such. In fact, there is drama precisely because it is about the community. A lack of drama is a good sign of there being no community more than anything, because in all likelihood it just means that nobody cares, rather than everyone being happy with each other.
---
Been GM and raidleader for over a decade of a hardcore guild.
---
A guild is slow or quick based on its goals. A deadline to get to 60 and when you plan to start raiding will get a lot of people happy, waiting with no clear duration is where you start frustrating members as their only indicator is the peoples leveling speed.
---
600 Members is A LOT and impossible to manage. It's fun to have many people to talk to sure but classic is a logistical nightmare compared to casual raiding on retail (its not too different from hardcore raiding in retail though.) You need estabalish a clear 50~ people who you want in your raidcore, make sure you got a good composition of classes, that they can attend your raiding days and let them know when you expect them at level 60.
---
A casual guild can function as long as casual = not alot of playing hours a week. A casual guild with lack of leadership and logistical oversight will be nothing more than a guild and not a raiding guild.
---
ps: your friend is a dick.
---
Tbh though, this is vanilla so assigning loot shouldn't be in a 'we need the huge dps increase from his 4-set instead of you getting your 2 set' kinda mentality. 
---
Loot council is mandatory in progression retail raiding because that shit is hard. You don't want the best loot going to the monkeys because a 15% DPS increase on a top dps could equal a 2% DPS increase overall instead of a 0.05% overall increase by giving it to the group clown.
---
In classic though? Loot council should literally only be in place so that every consistent member of the raid group gets the dopamine hit of a new piece of gear fairly frequently if you're not having trouble clearing bosses.
---
Classic raids aren't hard, but they sure can be tedious. If I go three weeks watching mr raid lead's friend the hunter getting every good drop while the other 2 hunters and you are out in the cold with greens in those slots then I'd just drop the guild TBH. Spending hours and hours clearing and getting jack because someone is so greedy that they'll essentially ninja loot for their friends just isn't worth the headache.
---
This is great! Happy for you and your family 🙂
---
It's not about whether people pass up gear, it's about whether the raid leaders allow healers and tanks to roll against dps on + damage gear.
---
In that case you kinda have to "start something" with rogues. Because you cannot trust them, and you cannot let them have the first hit, especially from stealth.
---
Correction: 2% on melee hit to gain 1 extra attack.
---
ClassicAuraDurations I think.
---
I put 22 into Sub before I started putting some into combat.  The only reason I went there at all is to pick up some hit.  I enjoy sneaking around too much to just play a gimped warrior.
---
I can tell you're still upset about the last Paladin that did this to you.  It's ok.  Time heals all wounds. :P
---
In all seriousness, though, if a group of people's idea of fun is to gang up on a single character of the opposing faction, denying them that fun IS showing them.  Whether or not they use cooldowns is irrelevant.  I just thought it added to the imagery I was trying to convey.
---
Ony hits like a girl, have your druid put on some fr
---
Wait, do people actually use the goblin AH?
---
MC is being cleared that fast by people who spent hours farming for their BiS and learning their classes. If a guild has taken 1.5 months to get to 40, how long would it take to get to 60 + BiS + competent? 
---
Meanwhile, the MC pugs are becoming more and more prominent. They would appeal far more to a casual raider who can pick and choose a pug according to spare time. That is why casual guilds have it tough in classic, pug raids were far less common in vanilla and they certainly weren't in MC 1.5 months after release.
---
What quest is that?
---
During the DDOS I ended up in a tiny island off the coast of some zone several hundred yards from shore. I think it happens when you have a dirty disconnect as OP mentioned.
---
could you PM me it lol
---
You can with certain programs on your phone and computer ( I have no idea how I've just seen people post pics of them doing it)
---
He hits the same button you do.  His character does the same amount you do.
---
He just has more characters, just like you would have more friends.  You can't sit there and whine about only playing one character and compare yourself to a group of 5 characters.  If you want to compare a group of 5 characters compare it with another group of 5 characters.
---
If you have a equal number of characters, the total of which costs $75, you have the advantage against a multiboxer.
---
Will it have a long term impact on server economy?  Probably not.  But did people who got to 60 / max herb/mining when the servers had 5-6 layers have an unfair advantage over people who get to 60 when the server has 1 or 2 layers?  Yes.  I myself was an early 60 (but not the earliest) and I've noticed a significant drop off in the amount of resources I'm able to secure as herb/mining since the server went from multiple layers to two layers.  This is without "exploiting" intentionally.
---
In all MMOs historically the players who race to the top first get an advantage and reward for doing so in that they are the first movers of the economy.  In WoW classic it happened to be significantly enhance by layering.  It is what it is.
---
Mate, you're the one pissing in his coffee.
---
The beautiful thing about classic is you also get the reputation.  You better believe people keep track of who’s who.
---
Ok.
---
Now I will die just to cost you 15 minutes.
---
Nah lol too difficult to work out
---
Hey I'm on kurinaxx. You horde or alliance?
---
Haha I was one of the people ahead of the curve... Until I got burned out at 59. Started collecting my Boss list and trying to get attuned, but once it got to like, oh here's the raid days and this and that it just turned into straight up work mentally and I had to get out. Not unlike my original vanilla experience, where I would stop playing characters at 55
---
I'm Alliance
---
What spec are you? What is your daggers skill at with the gloves? And without the gloves?
---
Why? That seems like an age old stigma simply because Balance has to need on clothie gear.
---
People have said they can last 5 mins or so casting. How many fights really last longer than that?
---
if i remember correctly it was doable in BC too, i remember a rogue that Tanked Illidan or something
---
Being fair and avoiding to being selfish.
---
As long bosses goes down everything is fine. People have also other things to do than raiding.
---
What difference does it make if you are Horde or not? Windfury? Slam is a melee attack also
---
Well he's a pally for that flawless tank spec. 
---
Hell I play Ret pally BECAUSE I want to support my team with buffs.
---
Took me 15 hours to get the recipe.
---
Upsides of being undead. Look sick, not a super popular race and class combo. You get cannibalize, shadow resist, and WoTF. You lose out on some stun chance, Bloodfury which isnt too great, and axe skill. Axe skill is great to have but as an orc you're forced to use axes basically. So this opens your options in some ways. There will be no problems with you raiding. And trust me, if you think undead looks cooler than orc but you had gone orc for racials, you'd probably be deeply regretting not being undead and actually enjoying your race choice ascetically
---
Oh, no. I've probably killed you before. My bad.
---
Eh, I get ya. But it’s to be expected with a re-released game. Nothing is new cause we’ve done it all before.
---
You are right I should have said you don't use slam at all
---
Vanilla came out Nov 23 2004, during retail the 1st Ragnaros kill was on April 25 2005. Give or take 5 months, if your guild gets a Kill  (which i know you guys can do !!!) before the the end of February  you would still be ahead of the World 1st guild during Vanilla times,  
---
The people and players who have kills have 15 years of practice in this game, just enjoy it at your own pace.
---
I've been running Shadow priest the majority of the game with the intent of switching over to Holy for healing. Now at level 51, I was wondering when would be an ideal time to switch specs.
---
Let the afkers die and take durability loss. Then /point and /laugh.
---
nice. I'd need on those immediately
---
Hmm interesting they are listed as pickpocketable with a loot table for it on wowhead
---
yeah if I miss ambush its a bit slow///
---
He's published one book in the series in the past 15 years, there's no way we'll see them finished unfortunately.
---
It's the minmaxing attitude, the rest of us are just obstacles to their supposed efficiency in their eyes. A lot of warriors have this too, but strangely no priests. I guess no one's trying to minmax healing, heh.
---
I do main horde, but after leveling a dwarf I definitely like the alliance leveling zones a lot better.
---
Haha this hit me in a special way
---
Why dont you tally up the dps your doing manualy. Why dont  you just use default action bars. Why do you need an addon to combine your bag space?
---
Always better than Heroic if everything else is on cooldown
---
Ground mounts ruined wow, now everyone just presses autorun and alt-tabs while their mounts sprint past the environment too fast to appreciate the carefully crafted world of copy pasted grass clumps and 5x5 dirt textures.
---
The best way to play wow is to /walk everywhere, then you're forced to interact with other players and appreciate the game because your so fucking bored out of your mind. So what if it takes like 2 hours to walk from the Crossroads to Ogrimmar, if an MMO isn't mind-numbingly boring why are you even playing it?
---
Even without pvp servers it wouldn’t have changed a lot 
---
There is no skill needed for raids in classic, it’s specifically designed for casuals after all 
---
It’s a chill casual mmo with big time sinks and a good feel to it 
---
You can wing ragnaros with 20 players without even watching a guide
---
I farmed essences of x, devilsaur leathers and elemental fire solo as a warrior. I got my epic mount about 10 days after 60. Had about 450 gold when I reached 60. Seems like your tank needs to look for some tips online. It was surprisingly quick and easy to gather the 900g gold needed as a warrior as well.
---
The last dungeon I did was deadmines, should probably run some SM
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
That’s the case for a lot of mods like DBM though, and no one thinks they’re cheating anymore.
---
Has anyone had trouble installing Auctioneer? I install it normally but it doesn’t seem to be registering or working
---
Hell at the very least you can throw out  Blessing of Salvation on people so you can keep threat up.
---
This is false. You only lose xp when you convert to raid. I did lots of lbrs runs from 56-60 and would get about 6 bars each run
---
This is a troll looking for attention.
---
* Mistakes Thunderfury for "Windfury" - even though he claims to have had a 60 Rogue with TF in vanilla.
---
* Later claims "Rogues and Druids were allowed to roll"
---
* Edits post with "Holy shit this blew up over night" - despite only 140 upvotes.
---
Absolutely nothing! :)
---
Fax
---
Your server is trash then or you have never done brd and have no clue what they are saying
---
The fuck you talking about?  The horde starts a friendly pvp bout with people the same lvl and the alliance calls in all their 60 friends to ruin the fun.
---
I'd agree to some extent. WoW was my first MMO, so the nostalgia is like a warm blanket fresh out of the dryer, but other MMOs have surpassed the questlines completely. You can read the texts and have a little backstory, but it's kill x, collect y. Nothing like ESO, where you actually have choices in how to do quests. Choices don't really block you from other content, but NPCs might be pissed you didn't do what they wanted, like the Captain gives some serious shade when you chose to destroy a dangerous artifact instead of using it against the other factions.
---
One thing that I do like about Classic is you're not THE hero, just another wanderer who can help. The NPC's would totally go kill those boars, but we're kinda busy atm. Other games and later on in retail, everything is based on you being the only champion capable of doing such monumental tasks. We need YOU to take on the big baddie. Thrall and Jaina need you specifically. Being a peon with a little autonomy and a to-do list is a better way to build a big world.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
That just says you have no idea how to make gold. Can your priest really make 40-50g per hour? As a warrior that isn't very difficult. But tideous.
---
They each have their own positives and negatives
---
Druids can use this in animal forms?! Is this specific to just this trinket or others too?
---
Nah it’s because they look like tryhard dorks who couldn’t think of another name once their pick was taken, lighten up
---
The game is so damn huge. Yes cutting edge content can get farmed but you are not near finished!
---
Where do you get an Ally tabard? I snuck into their hall of honor and grabbed one on a private server but i dont know if thats possible in vanilla/classic
---
I've made about 3k since release without layering or gathering profs since I'm tailor/alch. Gold just seems pretty easy to get atm and in 5 days it is only going to be easier.
---
That's good to know, thanks. Poor ret. Guess prot is the way to go :D
---
It’s not really an age stigma when it’s still a reoccurring problem in classic as well. They have the same problems as Ele Shamans as they run out of mana too quick. You better hope you farmed tons of mana runes to keep yourself from starving of mana. Also they take a debuff slot as well with moon fire. It’s just not worth bringing a balance Druid to a raid when you can just take a mage warlock hunter or even a shadow priest to buff the warlocks. I’m not trying to say you can’t absolutely find a guild to raid with it but just don’t expect for it to happen unless the guild your going with is super casual and don’t mind.
---
Then you spam hamstring. You don't use slam
---
Considering I'm level 55 getting one level a day I think you are doing good!
---
I think it’s mostly because we’re new. People are so efficient at leveling now and doing dungeons. I’m also kinda bummed that there’s even more level 60 content coming out next week and I haven’t even gotten to 60 yet. Just feel like I’m more and more behind
---
My alt is tankadin and main(sadly a mage).These magetards manage to land a frostbolt+fireblast before i even get to judge the target.Pull without being asked to(i have nades),i let them die after the warning " mage ,you pull it you tank it".I had one today pulling an extra pack of mobs(to go faster in a non-spellcleave group) while i had %10 mana....And when they are called in a spellcleave they dont even know how to help tank kite or even being specced into imp blizzard.I would have rolled a hunter as farming toon,but the leeway changed my mind. 
---
Mages are the new hunters EZ.
---
I've had "Sorry! Cat walked on keyboard!" 
---
So I can believe, angry gf hitting keys.
---
Read "I'm talking shit on Reddit while my Rez sickness counts down"
---
Never said it was, I agree.
---
Yall are angry at names and *I* need to lighten up? Fucking lol
---
I love the faction animosity in this thread.
---
Pyrewood Village. I raided with these guys a couple of hours ago.
---
Just yell or /1 offer to hand em out for free (tips appreciated, but not necessary) in w/e town you are in to whoever opens trade/whispers you. You may actually make more in tips than vendor, makes people regard you positively, and could even help you find people who want to do group quests. You could also hand em to your tank if you do dungeons (always nice to make a few quick tank friends.) You always want to try to leverage your professions to make more positive connections, this is a social game after all.
---
Why do you dumdums think I'm talking about giving it to the pug tanks? Use your brains.
---
Dead on sight
---
&gt; He hits the same button you do. His character does the same amount you do.
---
&gt; He just has more characters
---
So he collectively does five times as much damage because he is paying five times as much as I am.
---
&gt;If you want to compare a group of 5 characters compare it with another group of 5 characters.
---
I am comparing two human players...
---
&gt; If you have a equal number of characters, the total of which costs $75, you have the advantage against a multiboxer. 
---
Okay so that's five human players needed to have an advantage against one.
---
I don't understand how you can have like ten people all explaining the same basic concept to you and you still don't get it.
---
I use NeatPlates and it can do this. I think TidyPlates is another.
---
I feel it's more because people don't want the Chinese to control our art and media (edit: and our players speech). If we can let companies know that letting the Chinese control their player's speech isn't gonna fly, then companies might think twice before doing it. If Blizzard were to get away with things like this, then other companies would follow suit and we'd have China controlling American player's speech and before you know it, people won't be able to speak their minds or have political opinions if they want to play a game.
---
I remember a 5 man group using a rogue to tank Gruul during TBC too (Gruul's Lair was a 25 man raid)
---
What’s the minimum level to run SM Cath
---
Pretty sure this has been a thing for as long as people have been raiding. It has definitely become pretty common in retail for quite some time, especially with paying a group to run you through mythic+ dungeons and raids
---
If they’re providing food pots enchants and all that shit ig I can see that being reasonable. 30 seems a lot though
---
They also typically start to panic when they're hit with a silence
---
what a nice war trophy. A symbol to all the alliance of the hordes superiority!
---
And that book was released at the same time season 1 ended.  We've had the show run its entirety and he still isnt close to getting winds put
---
He actually doesn't know what he is talking about. Why do people not want group finder? Why not raid finder? Why is there anywhere between 40 and 200 hours of content from level 1 to 60? Because classic wow isn't about just end game content and farming. Social is the main reason people don't want group finder. If your guild is social, sure you may not raid or trade but you be social and social people will stay to socialise.
---
Other people not me. ;)
---
It’s been so long and I was so young that it feels pretty new to me.
---
I keyboard turn sometimes, but mouse turn when it matters
---
But the third is the best book

As a casual player with little time to dedicate to the game, those are all the things I want. When I was younger, I loved playing WoW for hours a day and could really hang out with the people and spend time getting groups for dungeons and raids and enjoy that time spent. Now I get maybe an hour to play anything at the end of the day and just want to be able to get through a dungeon or raid so I can get my gear and enjoy the game I pay for. I don't have time to sit and wait for a right group and I can't enjoy hanging out with other players. But I still want to enjoy a game I've enjoyed for over a decade.
---
Already happening by releasing a catch up mechanic for a raid that isn't release yet just because some people play 8 hours a day. I play a lot for having a full time job and social commitments and I'm still not 60. If you skip a good Saturday of leveling apparently you're behind. If they don't wait for p2 for a few months I might have to throw up my hands and admit I'm not hard core enough for wow.  After all the talk of relaxing and enjoying the leveling, blizz just told us we are moving too slow.
---
My friend was telling me yesterday how he would hide underwater with a hydrocane and then silence nearby AOE farmers and just watch them die. Funniest shit ever.
---
Honestly, so would I. Priests are way scarier than you'd think.
---
R.I.P &lt;3
---
Yeh true.
---
For the sake of min maxing I get it. But that's where I think most of classic stigma comes from. Apart from huntard looters.
---
I'm sure people raid as balance given the right guild.
---
Everyone who played a hunter in vanilla is playing a mage now.
---
So much this... Always annoyed me how MMOs essentially obsolete all your achievement in an expansion, by releasing a new one. I've always been a fan of horizontal progression instead of vertical; let me do my numbers in different ways, instead of making them bigger.
---
Its inevitable on a lot of fights.
---
Majority of MC fights involve aoe damage on melee and nobody is healing the pets.
---
I've never seen a Restoration Shaman so I guess *most* people play Enhancement?
---
Oh okay cool, I'll check it out.
---
I switched over at 55 to do BRD and LBRS and it worked out well.
---
You can easily kill multiboxers by yourself.
---
Bam, you're stronger than the multiboxer.
---
Multiboxer is five times stronger than you.
---
Guess you're over 5x your own strength.
---
Leaving this dumb as hell convo.
---
Buying multiple accounts and playing multiple accounts at the same time is not cheating or dishonest.  Get over it.
---
stop playing this game. free hong kong
---
Paying an established mythic team for a carry is a bit different from paying a fee to be part of a team who needs every drop for upgrades. 
---
Ive been around since 1.0 but have never seen a subscription based raid in person.
---
Half of MC will just kill pets. Even if you micro them.
---
I love crap like this.
---
No, you can even be lvl 55. Just need to be attuned.
---
I'll be honest from a guild that is kinda falling apart and what I've seen, I'm not the gm, but have some ideas for you.
---
The raiding guilds are pillaging our 60s when they fill in the missing pieces, so what you need to do is have a stated plan for your guild. My guild was the biggest on the server but since we didnt have any stated endgame plan, as people hit 60 they slowly left.
---
 At this point we would have had a full raid team, but people slowly moved on as they hit 60. Get a plan in place so they dont feel like they are done with the game and you should be fine.
---
It's almost too cruel, but I if I see a hunter from "the" enemy faction guild or someone on my KoS list, I'm moonfiring that demon to make it despawn, absolutely.
---
I do have a bank alt and his mailbox is an even more mess of various trade mats and valuables. Still, I keep some mats on me because I don't wanna wait an hour for my mats to arrive by mail every time I wanna level my profs or just restock on iron 'nades. And not other trash is useful only on my main.
---
that's pretty cool. Thanks for sharing
---
What do you farm? That seems super slow...
---
Leveling warlocks that know what they are doing use the drain life spell a lot. They get healed from the damage they deal with that spell so they generally want to be below 100% to avoid overhealing themselves and wasting health that could be free mana with life tap at most times so they'll life tap before fights.
---
Bad warlocks use their healer's mana as a resource to fill their mana pool without drinking though. Only heal a warlock's lifetap damage if they are at serious risk of dying or your mana pool is full. If you need additional mana breaks because the lock doesn't want to drink it slows down the group.
---
I'll never level an orc, Durotar burns my eyes.
---
I main a shadow priest and I'm aware of how scary we are. Between silence stopping casters, high armor though inner fire/ power word shield, and the ability to heal it's pretty easy to outlast people. I'm also wearing the shadoweave set so once I start melting your face with mind blasts it gets pretty wild. Highest damage I've done is 750 on a crit at level 44. That's basically half of a casters HP.
---
Okay that's what i thought i just see so many People concerned and stressed about getting every single peice
---
Long Live Hong Kong.
---
My first time in MC I was a level 58 hunter wearing a mix of greens/blues. I was not the lowest DPS in the raid.
---
There aren't any "gear check" bosses in MC before rag so you'll be fine.
---
There are LFG add-ons that parse the LFG channels.
---
Because it's not a chance thing . If it procs one time in 30 seconds. It will Proc 6 times in the next 30.
---
I used to be so invested, but I'm past it now.
---
I don't really get mad about getting killed but I do wonder what the motivation is for a level 60 to hunt down people who can't fight back and kill them. I had to fight my way through a horde blockade at thousand needles that was mostly people my level plus a level 60 warrior and I'm just trying to figure out what he gets out of it. Or like the level 60 rogue who was camping level 21-25 people outside Lakeshire. It's not really mad, I just feel sorry for this kid who is probably in his 30s and shouting at his mom about how he can't take the trash out because he's busy, playing on a computer his grandparents bought for him because he said he was going to learn to code, even though he's never finished the second lesson on codeacademy.
---
I do not worry about support
---
I’m not sure why it takes an hour to get a group together. Chat spam is full of dps looking for a group. If I’m starting the group for an instance I want a piece of gear from, I’m going to stack my chances of getting it. If someone invites me to tank for them I’ll go and chance my luck against dps. I’ll also state at the start of a run I have joined that in looking for XYZ, if it drops I’ll decide then based on a number of things whether I’ll roll against others.
---
Things to like about the Alliance:
---
1. FAR better leveling zones
---
2. FAR better leveling quests
---
3. Alliance players are by a wide margin better PvPers. Like, holy shit it's not even close. Do Horde players even know they have attack buttons?
---
4. Female Night Elf dance.
---
5. Did I mention better PvPers? Seriously, I have to ask this genuinely, do any horde players actually win any fights? Like, literally... ever?
---
6. Jaina Proudmore wins in the end. So.... yeah.
---
I mean, there's 6 right there.
---
Source: Am an alliance PvPer. And what I said is 100% true. Fight me.
---
Teamviewer. But the lag has to be absolutely unbearable. Probably can only do auction house stuff... and even then...
---
Five characters are stronger than one.  Get over it.
---
I guess you must be a multiboxer or something because this is a weird hill to die on.
---
You're leaving because even you realize that you're wrong, but you lack the emotional maturity to say that out loud.
---
You misunderstand blizzard - way prior they have in their clause that players cannot use the competitions to bring attention. And blizzard intends to stay neutral - the player used blizzards stage and bring a non-neutral statement from their platform and this is why they stopped it.
---
Essentially, they don't give a shit either way, but it's fair enough that they will ban anyone who uses their name for political statement, as it is blizzard who pays the price and they don't want to get involved which you cannot force them.
---
They aren't supporting china, they are just not willing to pick sides. If they let people get away with it, they will do it again and again, this is why blizzard professional team just makes sure that players know this is not okay.  
---
And that's actually fair enough for them to do, they aren't a news station, and if they take sides like that it can have real economic consequences for them which this player wasn't considering with his acts.
---
I also didn't realise that using all your available PI's on a ret pally so he can barely scrape into 400 dps on aoe bosses was a thing either.
---
I would switch specs when you can no longer heal dungeons effectively I suppose.
---
Word! \^,\^
---
When I did mine in vanilla, I had a group of guildies with me to whisper friendly characters to stay away and to kill any horde that showed up. Needless to say, it helped tremendously.
---
It's north worth it dude! &lt;3
---
Oh no shydagger...
---
I've started trying going bear against shadow priests. More HP than cat, and a stun. But I don't know, yet.
---
They are called typos. Are you new to the internet? And it's got almost 300 comments. Definitely not what I was expecting.
---
Yeah this is a common thing
---
Mod removed my 'hk #1 post'
---
Ok thanks
---
Really cool, simple RPG element that modern wow seems to be lacking as of late.
---
Odd, I've had literally the exact opposite experience, alliance is all buddy buddy when there's more horde, then the second more alliance show up they're all in on the gank.  I have been beaten 1v1 by alliance exactly twice, both times they attacked while I was fighting a mob.
---
Example, horde get WF and alliance get fear ward. Two most noticable differences.
---
i dont bring 'dps warriors" along my tankadin's groups.Annoying AF,i agree.I had one today actually saying,"lets test some aggro".
---
mages and "dps warriors" are the biggest aggro wh##es.
---
Imp - Stamina buff if needed in dungeon/raid and good mana battery with Dark Pact.
---
Succubus - Good DPS, nice to sacrifice for shadow damage, decent mana battery with Dark Pact and her abilities turned off. My preferred pet when leveling. 
---
Felhunter - PVP for silence and dispel.
---
Void - Sacrifice when going solo for awesome health regen, sacrifice for shield, and i guess some odd case you need a pet tank and cannot fear.
---
Looks like China police on a Hong Kong protestor
---
Thanks for all the feedback guys. A shame the voidwalker sucks so badly.
---
Yeah, and it still happens in BfA. Rarely.
---
Nothing close to consistent with the frequency with which it happened in the original pre-TBC era.
---
Tab targeted, since you're too small to fucking click on.
---
This makes me excited for the future. Thank you for your comment.
---
It wasn't random. There are certain strings of text you can copy and paste that translate to actual words on the enemy faction.
---
Thunderfurry is about 55/45 and is a high pop/full server. I've only heard good things from others as well.  One thing I can give to Earth furry is alot of the people actively tried getting to get people to switch to there server. Mostly met with ya don't want dead server in 3 months but maybe it worked out!
---
That’s a good point.
---
Ooo thanks I'll take a look
---
Horde PVP warrior, duel accepted
---
Is it really that bad to level up flowerpicking from 0?
---
Yeah you do get a reputation. I’ll blow wind up my own arse, but mine appears to pretty good based on the number of random whispers I get asking me to tank because they ran with me before and liked my tank style.
---
Used to be able to do this intentionally in BC using a switchback macro, by popping a shoot command in-between "main hand" weapon swaps.
---
I could never make it work with a two-handed weapon, wanted to bonk things with my gun.
---
People are sheep
---
Bag sorting is easy, why allow addons to do it. If they remove the combat log functions so be it, but if there there im gonna use it.
---
Actually had one repeatedly kite stuff into range of an escort quest to kill me
---
Just out of curiosity, which do you guys prefer the looks/class fantasy of: male undead warlock or female orc warlock? I legit can't decide which I like better and need a push in the right direction.
---
I've also seen similar behavior from people who buy currency for real money (RMT). They start saying all this insanely lucky stuff happened to them to explain how they're suddenly super wealthy, but they're usually not experienced enough to make claims that sound believable. Claiming you found a Staff of Jordan by level 30 is one of those wildly ridiculous claims, as the Staff doesn't drop from mobs that low.
---
If he actually has hundreds of gold on him, I'd bet he participated in some RMT and he's trying to make his wealth believable by saying all this crazy shit dropped. Of course it's also possible he's just looking for attention and doesn't have any gold at all!
---
bit different when considering pvp vs pve, especially considering that all the raids have already been figured out completely. it's one thing to improve your advantage vs a boss. it's another to do that vs another player through an addon. it forces everyone to download it. it nullifies rogues/druid cats as a class. it's completely unnecessary except to gain an unfair advantage that upends how wpvp is played. the most that can be said for dbm is that it lets people playing raids be lazier.
---
I'm already 60.  Don't act like it's some unobtainable level of prestige.   It's just time.
---
I think you misunderstood my reply because of how I worded it.   "When we are both 60..".   He still has a long way to go.
---
Mained an undead rogue for 9 years, I played an awful lot of pvp, exalted FW, MercGlad Arena 3v3, Ssn2, almost VengGlad Ssn 3.  
---
I destroyed cloth wearers, period. 
---
Were locks harder to kill? Yes, but they still died. Same for Priests.
---
Locks and Druids were hard because of dots and hots but still meat.
---
The threats were:
---
 - Warriors, Paladins because of the Ttk. 
---
 - Other rogues it was often who started combat first. 
---
 - Hunters and their pets almost impossible unless I got lucky.
---
 - Mages only won it they started the engagement or my abilities were on CD.
---
If a rogue, especially undead, comes after you. It is exceedingly difficult to stop them. In wpvp, which I'd what we're are talking about, where I can choose when to engage? The math is in my favor.
---
Not as true in retail, but in classic and even BC, rogue are made to kill cloth casters.
---
edited for spelling, phrasing, etc.
---
Oh look some Olympus members.
---
Hahaha yes
---
I just wrote my plan. Thank you. It's actually incredibly good advice.
---
I see, I thought it was just random jibberish.
---
Or is this Blizzards sense of humor?
---
It's a good way to learn about the perils of parry-haste :(
---
It's physically impossible for a level 30 to have gotten a Staff of Jordan I am pretty sure. It would drop off level 40+. 
---
I have got 5 BoE blues and I am level 41. Most weren't worth much, although it did really help with my mount. The weird thing was that 4 of them dropped in the space of 2 hours when I was level 36 in Arathi Highlands. I was going nuts lol.  
---
It's just luck though. Some people will hit 60 without getting a single BoE blue. Most people will hit 60 without getting a single epic BoE.
---
What? You don’t have phones?
---
whats hilarious its that you think the tell hurts the people or is somewhat of complete detriment, when in reality people just think "lol another loser", you didnt catch my point its not the end of the world coming across people like you, its just anoying because its a reminder of how stupid some people are.
---
"ignore is an option and im sure your list its vast" youre projecting there honey, i said i was a loner, not a bitch who needs to send people a tell when brushed aside i dont ignore people in games, people are free to say to me whatever they like and im free to disregard their stupidity, idiots like you get forgotten on the next loading screen
---
i find it hilarious that youre trying to make it seem as if youre a cool guy for being a minnor anoyance to others, its like you dont realize youre a joke and your whispers/tells are the punchline.
---
to be clear i dont have a problem with you sending a whisper to someone who was a dick to you or that was actively anoying you in game, but bitching at someone because he chose not to party with you its just, i have no words to describe how stupid that is, thats like me dumping my laundry on my neighboor and asking them to do it for me, only to bitch at them when they refuse.
---
This data is available on the internet.
---
thank you! that's an awesome history lesson for me. Did not know that fact
---
That's not how that works. That's not how any of this works.
---
Are there que times?
---
What do you need thorium for in engineering - looks like not many recipes? Also it seems like I get very few new recipe after 245, any reason to max out to 300?
---
Horror works the same as fear except it only being breakable by immunities like bubble and iceblock, and not being breakable by damage. Fear is breakable by a ton of stuff like wotf, berserker rage and damage on top of immunities and such.
---
Felhunter is the anti-caster pet. Its most relevant abilities are a dispel and a spell lock. Best general purpose group PvP pet. 2nd best damage. 
---
Succubus has the best damage and can control a humanoid enemy with seduce. Best leveling pet if you are a drain tank build (ie, affliction with 5 points in Fel Concentration). Good for escaping ganks (seduce and run). 
---
Voidwalker is the 'tank', I say this in quotes because his ability to hold aggro becomes increasingly poor as you level up. Ok for a slow and safe playstyle. Terrible damage.
---
Imp is the primary pet to use in dungeons and raids because he gives the whole party HP, and he can be stays in phase shift and doesn't get killed by AoE and doesn't accidentally pull stuff. That being said the other pets offer valuable tools in dungeons so don't be afraid to pull them out if you see a need. Imp has OK damage but runs out of mana.
---
Ya, it's sad to see what's happening to my guild, we have a lot of really good people that are super helpful, just lost people as they hit 60 to raiding guilds.
---
I hope everything works out for you guys and you get to experience all the content you wish!
---
Fairly open ended question.  Are you asking the minimum level to actually enter the dungeon portal, or minimum level to actually be effective in the dungeon (and if so, that depends on your role).
---
Minimum Level to ENTER the dungeon:  Level 21
---
Minimum Level to be effective:
---
* As a healer:  ~33,34 (if properly itemized)
---
* As DPS:  ~35,36
---
* As a Tank:  ~38 (could possibly get away with it earlier, like 36, if you knew the group and it was solid heal/dps wise)
---
Great tip someone once told me: you can bind marks in the keybind options. I have them on numpad. 1 is skull 2 is cross, 0 is clear mark etc
---
In light of the DM announcement the market for these items spiked
---
 by 400 to 600% (Grobbulas)... so yeah I'm pretty bummed out... can't afford to pay like 900g right now
---
Thank you mighty Rexxur!
---
You can run even lower as a healer. I had a really powerful group and was able to run it at 32 somehow. Probably would have been better to wait though.
---
2 pulls
---
I mean, every server has guilds or specific people who don’t give a shit if people don’t like them.  If thats you, more power to you.  
---
As to your point, people are desperate for tanks because the game is still new, only hardcore people are 60. The bulk of people may be close but 40-55 seems about right for most. I don’t pay attention to which tanks on my F list suck or are assholes atm, I just need a warm body to let mobs hit.  As time goes on that will change.
---
i had to get ganked 3 times to turn mine in
---
but right when I got there I 2v1d a 60 spriest and 52 rogue even after the spriest got the jump on me without my pet out
---
then I got 1 shot by fire blast while at 4% health after the fight
---
It's bannable to intentionally ruin hunter's and priest's class quest from what I remember
---
You should've needed. The GM's response is correct.
---
Why did none of you NEED on the carapace like you should have? Blizzard  GM's have no part in this, you guys just screwed up.
---
What do you expect when everyone greeded?
---
How?
---
i bought one 2 weeks ago for 120 g
---
My general rotation during 5 man trash is as follows:
---
* Immolate and corruption on priority target
---
* CoA on secondary targets
---
* Burn down priority target with shadow bolts (or drain life while leveling and conserving mana) 
---
* Maximize dps on remaining targets by guessing the times till they die to decide which dots to use
---
CoA only does very little damage in the beginning and ramps up in the end. This is great because it ensures that you don't pull aggro on the secondary dotted mobs while also giving the tank a little bit of time to establish aggro on the primary target before you go ham with shadow bolts.
---
On most bosses I go all out with dots and shadow bolt after letting the tank hit the boss for a few times if the tank seems to hold aggro well. If I pull aggro on the first boss which happens occasionally I know how much to hold back on the remaining ones.
---
Yea after the LFXRoleM for Ydungeon maybe add Tank rolling on dps gear only
---
Maybe you'll find a dps warrior that has all his pre BiS and wants to gather tank gear lmao
---
i think it's handsome and any girl would be lucky it have it
---
Are you even real? xD
---
Grew up playing through original vanilla, this is just the nature of the beast. Shit happens. Gotta run it again, endlessly, over and over and over mind numbingly so, until you get your drop. Or run with a guild or pay for runs with guaranteed loot. That's the way she goes, eh?
---
I did the same duo to 60. I found that as I got 30+ spirit became my best friend. The warrior had much better damage than me anyway so my role turned much more to a support class, despite me having ravager etc. 
---
I had an intellect/spirit set that I'll switch to when out of combat to increase my regen, and then a strength set to kill things. 
---
What you might found however that just the higher intellect allowing you to do more consecrates and throw more heals etc will up your duo damage during bigger pulls. So after I outleveled the scarlet monastery gear (kept ravager till mauraudon) I basically just rolled healing gear as I was more versatile.
---
If you have a set of healer gear, you shouldn't have trouble healing dungeons till late BlackRock Depths really.
---
Fuck Blizzard, Free Hong Kong!
---
I was trying to quest North of southshore but various hordes would kill me, then i gathered a group to kill them and we totally slaughtered them, but then a skull Rogue appeared and killed our whole party in 5 sec lol, I was pretty mad honestly , it was pretty fun the same lvl PVP, but after this Rogue camped us we had to disband and leave
---
Im rogue and i love spy. It perfect for a rogue. Just because they know a stealthed player us near doesn't mean they see you. Heck most people will ignore you if you just kill a nearby mob first. "O hes just farmin" Blaming a plugin for your bad play is stupid. Now saying it help you is another story, im a shitty rogue, but knowing when to be a little bitch is nice. Or when you go mind control cap a ?? Spit on him, then run away like a loser, lol.
---
If you are marking a skull target and your group is somewhat competent and willing to focus it, it is totally fine to put less threat into skull and more threat into the other targets. You'll lose aggro on skull but hopefully by that time it is below half HP and will die before doing too much damage.
---
Looking requires nothing but your eyes.  The info is all in the chat log if you turn on the options to show it.  That's where tha add-on pulls it's info.  This is just weak auras customised for PvP.
---
A warrior?
---
Seriously?
---
I was kinda hoping for a shammy. Something that is still easy, but you know, at least they're fun to fight.
---
But a warrior?
---
No no, don't get me wrong, the fact that I know 100% of your entire attack combo doesn't make this trivial at all... But /sigh, okay I guess. I suppose I can spend the 20 seconds of my life it'll take to prove my point to a, "pvp warrior". (you really just used that term, didn't you?)
---
Priest
---
Try  /console ffxglow 0     thank me later.
---
Working as intended.  
---
Don't underestimate that dude :p
---
Are their any resources that show mana efficiency vs damage for offensive spells? This weekend I was planning to figure out my damage vs mana cost of all my abilities and a paladin and see breakpoints for when it's best to use spells like Concentration and Holy Shield. Also interested in the mana efficiency of things like judgements and also exorcism.
---
All items can roll for any class.  You weren't aware of this?    
---
You k what solves this?    Use the NEED option if you NEED something.  The guy wouldn't of been able to accidentally greed roll for the win.
---
I don't understand how the NEED button is so confusing.   If you need something hit NEED.  If you don't NEED something then hit GREED so if nobody needs it then everyone has a shot at it.
---
What should you play? Another game.
---
Yea it just wasnt adding up and some other guildies and I were chatting through whispers about his claims. 
---
I also had 2 Boe blues drop but form demons in Felwood i farmed for like 4 hours trying to get runes and felcloth to sell. It really makes you want to keep grinding when you get lucky like that.
---
At least he didn't say something completely unbelievable like he was getting head while playing
---
&gt; more work and not necessarily faster
---
:(
---
You can still report, 3rd party programs doesn't count as facts
---
UD
---
As someone who probably spent 30+ hours in BRD this past week, it really is amazing. Despised it at first. But it grows on you and every run you get a little bit more familiar with it and appreciate a new layer of it.
---
I am so amazed that people can't understand Need/Greed.    If he needed it he wouldn't of had someone accidentally rolling greed on it.
---
Yea, Healers get huge leeway in terms of level requirement to perform well in a dungeon (even more so these days with people actually stacking proper stats like +healing).
---
32 makes sense, you get another set of skills then (and if your class got a new healing spell, then you're just as effective as a lvl 33 in most cases).
---
Male undead by farrrrrrrr. Best animations. The female orc is ok but their run and idle stance is so awful, they look like they are pinching a quarter in their asscheeks and trying to keep it there.
---
That requires your attention and focus and remembering to look out or knowing to look out. You could be chatting away with guild doing a million other things and this will give you at least the same level of awareness as what you suggest. It is a pussy ass addon.
---
It actually is starting to make me question my rolling on a pvp server. What do I really want out of this game? I work full time and have a family, so I just want to quest and maybe a dungeon after work and chill. At the start I kept hearing that not rolling on a pvp server would not be the full experience, but TBH so far, and I'm lv50 so it's been a while, is that the full experience of getting ganked by groups or higher lv players, or those who wait until you pull mobs, sucks. I actually ganked low lv to see if that would be fun, but I just felt dirty and guilty. What Joy is there to gank someone totally helpless?
---
Maybe by "full experience," people meant rolling horde and ganking helpless Alliance players? As a new player that read quite a bit before I started, I certainly would have appreciated that.
---
When I started there was also no high population pve servers. But now, there are. So my fear of a dead server is gone. So why do I even still care? I can play battlegrounds anyway when it comes out. World pvp means nothing when it's a one-sided getting ganked, and rarely am I in a position where I even have a chance to fight back or successfully run away. Alliance groups I'm in just never gank hordes. So what's the point?
---
Looking good! For the Alliance!
---
No, people have been experimenting with cross faction communication for a long time.
---
it all depends on what time you want to raid , i live on the east coast but often times a west coast server is better for me due to my work schedule. often ill be home around 10pm  so  a west coast server with a  guild that has a raid time of 8pm their time = 11pm my time
---
Hmmm I had not considered him buying Gold with Real life money. but wouldn't Blizzard be able to catch that and either ban or suspend his account?
---
IMO i dont think he has anything, not even the gold. I guess we can find out once he hits 60 and has no epic mount! ha!
---
Same. They went horde. I went Alliance.
---
Yes ofc, just like all auras
---
Every group I've been in just zergs those rune rooms...and it goes completely fine. It's an effective strategy, that's why people do it. After all it's 5 man level difficulty and you have 10 people. 
---
I understand psychologically it may be annoying to you personally, but the tank doesn't need to be in total control of everything all the time.
---
Orcs are better in PvP as well.
---
How? If this is preventing you from getting close then your a shitty sword rouge anyways.
---
Looks like a rerollin for you. 
---
Its all fine though :)
---
It was an extremely rare thing in vanilla but it become a thing once guild banks were introduced in TBC. Most of the legit guilds who did it would use those funds for consumables and repairs for the raids on top of the occasional buying BoE neccessary for a raid member. So unless the guild is providing everything for everyone every raid and you are guaranteed a spot every raid with fair chance at loot, avoid any guild that requires a "membership fee".
---
Questing through STV on a PvP server will make you realize why gang violence is perpetuated.
---
Very rarely at this point. 5 minutes maybe during peak times, but usually not at all.
---
More personal insults, what a surprise!!!! You know what, I typed up an actual response but fuck it (lel), it's not even worth it when you literally (yes, literally in the literal sense) can't hold a rational conversation without diverting to the most basic defense mechanisms.
---
While I completely agree with you for dungeons endgame, OP did say leveling. 
---
While leveling, i feel you wanna take imp drain life if your drain tanking. The extra range really doesn't do much, as things are running in to melee you, and still need to be in range to SB/immolate. If anything you want more point in suppression, your miss chance vs +2/3 level and shadow resist mobs starts to ramp up.
---
As I was leveling on a PvP server I just ignored demonology and got points in curse of exhaustion asap, finished SM after. Yes, exhaustion does very little pve, but its game changing vs rogues, warriors, shamans and paladins in pvp.
---
Bwl isnt even in phase 2 which is coming in 2 months.  I imagine BWL is a lotttt more than 3 months away.
---
Ohh I getcha! I thought you meant a quest named “Blood Red” haha, not the quest color for when it’s too difficult
---
Nice!! Looks cozy 👌🏻
---
What is flurry haste?
---
Drastic change in CS policies constitutes gameplay changes.
---
This is terrible.
---
spray paint it with pro china slogans and watch people get mad butthurt
---
##NoChanges
---
Hilarious in a good way :) Well Done, WELL DONE indeed.
---
"-Horde welcome their heroes home, Orgrimmar" I laughed loudly :)
---
&gt;Nothing obnoxious about the hate  
---
You've been living under a rock, then, and I'm envious. Butthurt GoT fans are among the most obnoxious people on the planet. Head over to /r/freefolk to see some of the most childish and vitriolic people you'll ever see. Not to mention they're super unoriginal with their canned "u fookin' kneeler" lines they like to spout if you don't agree completely with the hivemind.
---
I totally understand and agree with you mostly, I just don't think it was the "right" thing to do. It pains me just thinking about what that warrior tank must have felt. I know I would feel slighted if that was me is all. But oh well, it is what it is.
---
When he hasn't lied about every major alliance guild blacklisting you
---
I see, i definitely see how. See all that gold in my bags after 2 weeks? 
---
it works.
---
I hope you're right dude :-)
---
At 39 you can go to razorfen downs in addition to the ones already mentioned.
---
Imagine valuing this game more than human rights.
---
Dont remember him having Windfury =p

Why are you being such an asshole? This is something GMs would have done on vanilla WoW just about every time.
---
Just why?
---
Yeah as a healer I can know this feeling and will never join groups with 3 mages. I either solo quest or wait for another group
---
I know the feeling. Couldn't decide between Hunter, rogue, mage, warlock with a druid/Shaman alt. For now I'm definitely getting hunter to 60 (currently 42), but still undecided on what my main/Alts will be. 
---
Every class looks so bloody fun and unique, i want play them all. Also,  I've definitely got some mage envy.
---
Faction and race have been a big issue too, currently got characters split across both.
---
Everyone competing for PVE achieves could make those same arguments, but they don’t cause they’re not salty rogues.
---
At least I can blacklist you for being a shit paladin.
---
Zoomer actually
---
I’m currently an arms specced because I wanted to PvP, but the PvP is very mild in Phase 1. What spec would you guys recommend for late game dungeons 55+ and pre raid, and raiding? 
---
(I don’t want a deep prot spec)
---
I came late and joined a new server westfall population is high but I log in immediately
---
Disagree 100% with that because of will of the forsaken.
---
Say goodbye to all your gold
---
It's a good show, particularly the early seasons. Last season in particular could have been better, but don't take the vocal haters seriously. The butthurt is still pretty fresh and the entitlement is strong.
