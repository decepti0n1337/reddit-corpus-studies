We pugged a lot of mc/zig/aq and actually ran a suicide kings list for loot out of it so returning players got some benefit. We were pretty successful and near the end even got into BWL. There were usually ~20 guildies on alts or mains (if they missed main raid) 12-15 regular returners and 5 or so true pugs out of trade chat.

So i decided to dig through the vanilla wow binarys and it looks like the first instance of this code (referenced in the function Spell_C_GetMinMaxRange) was introduced in 1.10.0.5195.
---

---
prior to this there was no additional range given (at least in the client code).
---
for those who want to check themselves:
---
1.9.4.5086 (completely absent from this build)
---
&gt; 0x006C9840  Spell_C_GetMinMaxRange
---
1.10.0.5195 (first build i can find with the leeway code added)
---
&gt; 0x006D53C0  Spell_C_GetMinMaxRange
---
sigh........
---
it's true though, if there's only 10 realms and each realm has 5 layers you will only need 4 accounts to reserve your name on all of them.  if there were 50 realms you would need 20 accounts to reserve your name on all of them.
---
They actually did, then later they said *for sure by* phase 2. There's your range.
---
yes, roll a race you don't like the look of for an hour of raiding a week thats pathetically easy
---
This is crazy informative. I would love one for every dungeon.
---
I got there back in the day on a trial account with a modded file. It was something to do with changing where zeppelins transported you.
---
I mean I get your point.  I think because it's no longer 2006 it should go away or be ramped way the fuck back from where it's at on the beta.
---
no words...
---
&gt; I can\`t even comprehend as to why one thinks its ok to play on PVE server. 
---
Just read the thread replies? There's plenty of reasons. Feigning ignorance just makes you look dumb.
---
&gt; The entire point of online games is to bash eachothers skulls in. 
---
Well no, it's not. There's raiding, crafting, farming, dungeons, exploring, questing, collecting, role-playing, auction management, literally tons more things to do.
---
&gt; The thrill, the excitement 
---
In your opinion, which is fine, but what have you got against people who just want to play a damn video game however they like in a way which harms nothing but your apparent ego? What are you compensating for my dude?
---
this. OP is an idiot.
---
This is not in any way proof of anything but a slight leeway in the interface and ATTEMPTING to cast spells. This has NOTHING to do with whether those spellcasts/attacks actually resolve on the server.
---
&gt; Except if it doesn't you can just modify the client to do whatever the fuck you want. The piece of code you are modifying is just for the UI. Your explanation of why the client has this code is completely incorrect.
---
Most people won't modify the client to remove this check. Checking it clientside first means that the server only ever needs to run the check if you *are* in range -- but it still has to run the check in case people try to cheat by modifying the client. This is better than running the check every time someone tries to cast a spell while out of range, which happens often because players will spam the ability until it goes off.
---
&gt;Also "It would be slow and unecessary having the server manually check" is more wrong. Comparing two small numbers is the fastest thing a CPU can do and is completely necessary since every decision is on the server side.
---
It's an MMO. Little things add up. Plus computational effort isn't the only reason this is done: it also saves bandwidth. The server still checks, it's just that it doesn't need to check all the time when someone is spamming a spell while barely out of range.
---
I see the benefit of the 10% for sure. That's a noticeable decline, especially where chain ha is concerned.
---
But I'm certainly aware that shamans are going to do more than just chain heal, however, it is usually their intended role so I'm curious how devoted to that role I need to be with this hybrid.
---
???
---
*starts spamming rank 1 arcane explosion*
---
**Run away little girl** *run away*
---
look in the linked thread. the top comment claims it was based on time and not that it increased your range.
---
Nice
---
Yeah, where we had good luck... Had 3 thunderfury... we still had bad luck in others. I think we only had one deaths sting, one dark edge, and everyone that got a drake fang quit after a few weeks haha. Also had a resto druid try to take the drake fang and throw a fit that we wouldn't give it to them. Ah, vanilla drama!
---
More often than not server population will be skewed in favour of one faction meaning world pvp is nothing more than a gank-fest. There is no fight to be had.
---
I get that but occasionally their are rational people out there in the world... 
---
They can have a untouched classic server each expansion can have its own server. Their gameplay will not again I repeat not be touched.... but this is also the same community that rages over the idea of allowing orcs to be upright only on the individual players screen and no one else has to look at it, just because "its not what I want so no one can have it."
---
I thought that was the case. I knew you could on pservers but was pretty sure that was something not from Vanilla. Thanks mate.
---
I just wanted to add that you can easily tank or dps as fury dungeon, collecting loot for both roles. And then do either in raiding. Also, my guild use to run 3 prot and 6 fury warriors. That's almost 25% of the raid as warrior. Dont let a high warrior population daunt you - they are needed.
---
&gt;Damn it's almost like you're so blind with rage
---
Dudes comment history is some real incel shit
---
Warriors have a high burnout factor to because of their high gold costs of raiding for full consumes is so high generally warriors quit a lot. It is very rare to keep all 10-11 warriors in your raid team. 2-3 tanks and normally 8 fury warriors.
---
I came to that conclusion due to the client literally sending 0 packets to the server when you try to use a skill out of range.  
---
Like you said we can modify the client to remove the range restriction obviously, then the only thing stopping the attack would be the serverside check I mentioned above.
---
Your looking at it wrong, the circle and cross piece is the stave head  being thrust in a downward swing.
---
Naw. I'm with you man. You organically made new friends in Vanilla and BC. I've met a couple buddies through mythic + but we are all waiting until classic.
---
What does RP mean in the context of WoW servers? I know it stands for role-play, but I don't know what it means in practice. So as someone who has played lots of role playing games (pen &amp; paper and computer) but never played on a WoW RP server, what does it mean in this context? How is it different than other servers?
---
I think &lt;Doggo Noir&gt; be a perfect place for you! We will be raiding on Tues/Thurs at 7-11pm EST. Its a laid back group that knows people have lives outside of WoW and don't expect you to put the game first. We are hoping to have a full guild run by week 5-7.    
---
Things completely irrelivate to the game that might be of interest to you:  
---
We have a ton of Texans in the guild 28-32  
---
Have a no politics rule in place that will 100% be enforced.  
---
I will shoot you a PM with a link to our application, discord and my personal discord info. Hope to hear from you soon!
---
dungeons, free ofc. random BGs ill give them lvl 45 water for free and nothing else. In city, lvl 45 food/water for free lvl 55 water 1g a stack at least.
---
Lul I'm against layering after the first 1-2 weeks [(this is a total bummer)](https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ) but on the release IT WOULD be totally unplayable without layering or dynamic respawn with crazy rates... Blizzard can't really let everything sort itself out since that would scare away all casuals permanently... I dug some screenshots from nost release https://imgur.com/a/wx0Y33n. It was so crowded people would go grind farms at level 2-3 in groups... :D  
---
I think I just quit for those 1-2 weeks and when I came back it was playable again... What I'm afraid of is that blizzard will keep layering for 2-4 months and that would really impact the journey to 60...
---
Everything on [this graphic](https://i.imgur.com/OdjMlp0.png) is correct except the TCG Riding Turtle.
---
To put it in perspective, that's what plenty of modern WoW players say about Classic when you describe it to them.
---
Without Leeway Ranged have no advantage,
---
With Leeway Melee have an advantage.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I corrected you.
---
i cant speak for how it was in vanilla, but you can check how mangos handles it here:
---
https://github.com/lh-server/core/blob/development/src/game/Spells/Spell.cpp
---
The server actually does somewhat trust the client to check and then the server adds its own check on top of it to prevent it from being abused by capping it at 5 yards)
---
considering this exact offset is also scanned by warden you can safely assume it was being abused at one point in time.
---
while checking if the input is valid might not be very intensive you have to remind yourself that people are playing with all kinds of variable latency, in order to actually make the game playable you have to extend some trust to the client.
---
if the game was to send input to the server to be verified BEFORE it could perform the action that would make for some very clunky feeling netcode.
---
How do racial mounts work? Can I eventually get every racial mount for all Ally races if I do all their quests? Or is it impossible?
---
Other people comment different things than you. This comment is unnecessary
---
They are needed in raids although not as many spots as other dps but most people are running around with this retail mindset of having to be top dps to do anything. Classic Raids are a joke! No part of them are hard plus most players are much better now at wow then they were in the past.  Unless your playing in the .01% guild (which is just dumb because classic is about the experience and people not blasting through content first) then you will be fine on a hunter. 
---
A lot of stigma with hunters so might be harder to get a group for dungeons but classic was all about friends and community so you will have people to play with much easier as long as your not a tool.
---
They are great at solo, far more complicated then a mage who can assign frost bolt to their scroll wheel and watch tv while being top dps. Plus pvp just wreck face if you are good.
---
Plus!!!!!! When/if tbc servers come out If i recall hunter was the top dps.
---
Yeah he’d be tanking with earth shock which is nature and unaffected by elements. Curses in 5m goes for the highest dps and utility where required. No need to worry about any other factors.
---
When you have exalted with them you can buy them, mostly done through cloth donations as there aren’t enough quest
---
For every 10 people who roll warrior (or say they will in a poll) 5 of those will reach 60 and 4 of those will be trying to pvp/dps with 95% of their time. If you wanna tank you'll be in demand
---
How about the epic weapon questlines? Some of them were ABSURDLY obscure. For one of them, you had to find a random NPC, with only vague clues about WHO they might be, let alone where. Then you had to "/say" the right text. What did you need to say? Sometimes they didn't tell you -- you had to work it out from other conversations with other NPCs. In other words, you had to play the game like a damned mystery novel.  
---
*Eventually,* you could find forum posts outlining the various steps of the quest, written by someone who did all the groundwork. But the internet was different in those days -- it wasn't always easy to get the information. Clearly, this is all extremely unapproachable for casuals.
---
... what? Classic is all about community. Your name is how the community views you.
---
Bad is relative. A good hunter will out dps a bad mage every time.
---
Hunters are also needed for tranq shot.
---
Hell back when I played Vanilla my guild had me pull bosses by mind controlling my pet.
---
Hunters also make the last boss in UBRS wayy easier.
---
There's a reason groups are always looking for tanks.  Tanking is a pain in the ass compared to the other roles.
---
Didn't they said that 1 layer will have the size of one original classic server so how comes that he is on another layer since there are at max 500-600 people online on the beta
---
your post... question mark ?
---
Okay so it is physically possible. That's good to know.
---
By the time hunters start sliding (naxx), you won't be playing any more.
---
Me too brother. Me too.
---
This. Great game, but I can't bring myself to put in 700+ hours to level a character to cap.
---
You're confusing my conversations to others with conversations having anything to do with you. Thats why to you im 'straight up incorrect' 
---
please don't confuse my conversations and muddy the conversation thankyou.
---
I’m really hoping for this. No one has really stuck since back in the day.
---
You should care about winning with skill rather than being gifted it.
---
You can have a very nice name but still have a bad reputation
---
You can have a shitty name but still have a good reputation
---
Names are irrelevant to you as a player unless you RP.
---
Great advice. One thing I want to add is to make sure you understand how taunt works and that you are using it efficiently. Taunt doesn't just force a target to attack you, it sets your threat on that target to the threat of whoever has aggro.
---
You can use this to your advantage to generate "free" threat if you pool rage, allow a dps to aggro, and then immediately taunt before dumping rage. Super useful when rage deprived or when tanking multiple targets.
---
For riding skills beyond your own faction, you have to be exalted with the faction to learn the skill. For instance, [Wolf Riding](https://classic.wowhead.com/skill=149/wolf-riding) can be obtained by any Horde race that has exalted with Orgrimmar, but Orcs don't need to be exalted.
---
&gt; Names are irrelevant to you as a player unless you RP.
---
This very thread proves otherwise, lmao
---
Sap breaks stealth in classic though, right?
---
Some people definitely have a issue with changes.
---
It's called nochanges not somechanges.
---
Damn I forgot rank 11 pvp mounts :p
---
If you want to do more recording check out Open Broadcaster Software. It's free and doesn't have a watermark.
---
Warrior Hunter Mage Paladin.   Great damage, control, and can do dungeons and stuff just fine.
---
You definitely need to put the shield on for that baroness in stratholme. If you have your 2H on for her, she'll kill the party when she mind-controls you. :)
---
Pretty much. nochanges just seemed like a way for people to be elitist.
---
It was started by streamers spread by sycophants
---
Tell me how being named «Jesus» makes me a better player than being named «Hitler».
---
Dire Maul is being rolled out in Phase 2 fyi, you may want to consider a Scholo wand. Bonecreeper's Stylus and Oblivion's Touch can be farmed there.
---
During Warcraft 1 and 2? Sure, the Horde and the Alliance would attack each other on sight. But Warcraft 3 and vanilla WoW? No, the two factions were not at war with each other, because it’s an entirely different Horde. People may not realize that we have at least four different Hordes by this point in the story, with completely different ideologies and allegiances.
---
We can even see this in-game: A human in a Stormwind tailor shop tells players that there’s no open wars going on. Thrall himself commands players to return the Princess of Ironforge back to the dwarves unharmed as a gesture of goodwill, and orders the death of Onyxia because she threatens the existence of the Alliance. If players read through these quests and think they’re at war, they simply weren’t paying attention.
---
Those who believe in the Horde ways of attacking the Alliance would have their interests more aligned with the Dark Horde in Blackrock Mountain (under subjugation of Nefarian), the Fel Horde back on Draenor (still in service to the Burning Legion), or in one of the many cults under the influence of the Shadow Council. A Horde member openly attacking the Alliance and breaking the armistice would get them exiled, or worse, executed as a traitor to the Horde. Thrall has done so in the past. Similarly, the Alliance of Warcraft 1 bears little resemblance to the Alliance of vanilla WoW due to leadership and member kingdoms changing or simply ceasing to exist.
---
Sure, the members of both factions aren’t fond of each other, but they aren’t immediately hostile to each other either. They don’t actually go to war with each other until the Cataclysm when Garrosh became Warchief. 
---
The immersion argument becomes a bit… odd in that sense. Do you want more immersive gameplay? Sure, PvP absolutely grants that. Do you want to be immersed in *Azeroth*, specifically? PvE servers are closer.
---
Holy cow, this code would be hard to maintain...
---
Just buy something from the auction house without trading/sending mail to anyone. Impossible to proof = legit.
---
Now that is a HOT take.
---
Thankyou I  think. Can't really tell which side your supporting.
---
Are mounts account wide in classic or is it per character?
---
Paladins are RoboCop bug zappers, eh?
---
I'd like to not know exactly what is coming at what phase, an authentic vanilla experience
---
It's there in Mechagon trust I invited my friend from getting Rustfeather and he had to wait again.
---
I don't like cheating/cheats.
---
I live in 24/7 pasta cognition. Itsa me

Mario
---
I just started watching that TV show because of this post.
---
In 5m using up multiple GCDs for a small % gain is going to drop your personal dps by a larger margin negating the benefit. It’s also why you’d switch to searing pain on low hp mobs because while those shadow bolt overkills look great on the meters if the mob dies before it connects you’ve lost even more dps. When I play casters I usually gauge npc damage taken and swap to the next kill target at 5-10% because melee/cleave will finish it and my spells won’t hit it before it dies.  
---
  
---
It’s the same principle with dots. You don’t run a full dot rotation on primary targets because it will be dead long before they run their duration.
---
Yea I think they did plan on it to be in vanilla. A lush drwaven mountain dungeon would have been sweet
---
There's always a shortage of tanks don't worry about it. People will be looking for tanks for groups for literally hours.
---
Play a tank.
---
made more friends on the 2 day stress test than i have in the past like 6-7 years on retail lmao
---
Spam sunder armour, that was pretty much it back then.
---
Yeah, but there wasn't really much benefit to having more than 1 ele (if you even bothered), and 1-2 enhance.  Stuffing your raid full of restos was the real jewel.
---
You want to play with the fucksticks that post here?

Cheers!
---
Every server is going to be "full" because there's not going to be many.
---
Actually I'm pretty sure there's a weekly thread posted on this sub for exactly this.
---
Played private servers on and off and i remember one of the biggest servers DIDNT have mellee leeway until it became open source and then people realised it wasnt there and petitioned for it to be added.
---
I remember alot of my ranking guildies would talk about it all the time saying casters had a big advantage against mellee in pvp without it. I was a warlock at the time and had multiple ways of keeping mellee off of me anyways so i didnt really notice it.
---
Sorry for the ramble but the point im trying to make is that people have been looking at the code of this game for over 10 years trying to make it as close as possible to the real thing and if it was that major of a thing to cause uproar in the private server scene id put money on it that they are correct.
---
What happens when Blizzard over projects the tourist numbers and can't get rid of layering because the servers can't handle the load without it?
---
I get this reference.
---
The average player may not even play LFR... and in LFR you ignore half the mechanics and STILL get the boss down.
---
When I was a kid in vanilla I too played on a PVE server. I have the same memories of WPVP on a PVE server. I was the kind who pretty much thought it was a badge of honor to be flagged almost at all times on my PVE server, and at the time I felt like many people felt this way. The reason I am going to go PVP this time in classic is that people already know what they are getting into. They didn't just join a server not really understanding the differences between PVP and PVE. I think theres ganna be the strict PVEers who will play entirely unflagged and then anyone else will play PVP server. There will be no more organic PVP battles because they know about them ahead of time. They happened on PVE servers in vanilla because they heard about these epic battles happening on a PVP server.
---
Holy shit, I had blocked these horror shows from memory but it's all rushing back to me now. That fucking turban....
---
Mounts are items in Vanilla WoW. You don't "learn" them, they're items you have to keep in your bags. This is how it was until WotLK. Same goes for vanity pets (toys didn't even get a page until WoD). 
---
The first Account-wide mount didn't exist until late into WotLK and it was only obtainable for $25. All mounts didn't become account-wide until MoP.
---
So that's a pretty big change.
---
if every realm is full with only people subbed 2 weeks in advance they'll know they need more realms immediately
---
When I hit 60, I went looking for a good starter weapon for dungeons as a tank. Decided to go with the masterwork stormhammer (which, people new to tanking in vanilla, cannot be your only tanking weapon, as it breaks CC).
---
No one on Alliance had the pattern, so I spent a ton of time working through the neutral AH to get money over there, get the mats, and get it crafted. I wonder if I still have it in my bank
---
And later, having that lvl 20 Horde character became my account's largest source of gold, oddly enough
---
Lol oh the drama, and RNG...
---
We never saw a Drake's Fang... Only one Rejuvenating Gem but every Warrior including the casuals had a Lifegiving Gem!
---
We also only ever got one T2 Warrior Chest and no Shoulder.
---
BWL was cruel to us.
---
Exactly, that's why I think this would be nice.
---
[removed]
---
You can still play in that time, that excuse is very lame
---
Would they still be level 1 even with exploration xp?
---
You should take some advice from your user name
---
Pretty much this.
---
You want feline swiftness as the 30% move speed cannot be undersold.
---
Furor allows you to have less downtime, less waiting for your initial energy.
---
FFF (Feral Faerie Fire) is amazing. Range pull and decreases enemy armor is awesome. (Bonus points, when facing a rogue on a pvp server, have fun when you can't stealth sucker)
---
OOC vs LOTP is a tossup, personally I go OOC before LOTP, the free ability is kind of nice when it goes off. This one is up to personal preference.
---
Ahh, well I definitely wouldn't say that. Twinking has a few kids here and there, but it's a great community (not a fan of 19s though). You can gain a lot from twinking, beit team competition, fighting people you're familiar with due to lower population, or even to grief lowbies within a semi-close level range. There is a lot more purpose to twinking than to ganking lower level zones, and the amount of competition you'll expect to face varies greatly between the two. I'm sure there are some mature gankers out there who do it for whatever reason, but at face value it looks like gankers fear equal or even semi-equal competition, and choose to take the easiest possible route to make themselves feel powerful.
---
&gt; I'm hoping that the internet hasn't changed too much to prevent these types of interactions
---
When the game is designed to promote social interaction (because its the most efficient way to achieve your goals) then social interaction will naturally occur.  The internet overall is very different, but basic human psychology doesn't change.
---
...oh no... it's retarded
---
For me, the EQ aesthetic doesn't hold up. I watch some EQ streams and those uis literally cover the screen
---
This is why I just heal.
---
Slightly more fleshed out? They made hybrids not suck. It was by far my favorite expac.
---
The last stress test seemed to test the functionality as it will be available on August 13th. Before the stress test you could log on and create 3 characters in game, you just couldn't actually log on and play them until the 'launch'. So yes it's the same as it works in game, you have a realm selector that displays low/medium etc and you can create your whole character as it will be at lvl 1.
---
Since they are using the modern client instead of the old 1.12 client, how can we be sure that the modern client is calculating leeway in the same way as the 1.12 client did? If we are able to verify that then how do we know that the accompanying checks on the server side are also as comparable from then to now?
---
I actually find this whole situation interesting since leeway AFAIK was never a topic of discussion back in Vanilla that I had ever heard of.
---
there will still be dead servers, layers encourage grouping together on the poplar servers more than unlayered.  if a server is already dead there won't be any tourists to leave or layers to collapse to create a healthy server, it's dead.
---
and i'm still not sure how we got on the topic of layers just from all the realms being full, i didn't bring them up you did
---
Mages who give me water in BGs are mages who get BOP prio
---
Sorry warlocks I love you &lt;3
---
Unless I’m forgetting some aspect of it, I *loved* the class system at launch. Starting out as a general class, then choosing my subclass at level 10, then specializing at level 20, felt really cool.
---
The video mentioned a front shred build balance down to natural weapons and respecing at 20. It’s a similar path to the BC shred build which is a very solid option. I’d still recommend going down to omen grabbing furor in resto until you hit 26 then doing that respec directly into the early shred build. I’d also recommend feral instinct over thick hide. Better tanking threat and opener/pvp utility is a superior option in my book.
---
I'm only writing this because a screenshot of IDA/Hexrays was the last thing i thought I would see on this sub :)
---
“HEY MAN YOURE DYING JUST TRADE ME 1G AND ILL HEAL YOU”
---
Not cringey at all but honestly probably not going to happen with layering for the first few months and software like discord with server specific channels. It's going to be very different this time around and honestly not in a good way.
---
&gt; they'll know they need more realms immediately
---
Remember saying this? The entire purpose of layers is that they can function with a low number of servers.
---
He's not talking about tourism or population vacuums, the opposite actually. He's talking about a server becoming too full and thus needing more servers opened. Layering has no defense against a server that becomes bloated. Re-read the text before assuming he's trolling.
---
When did they add Necro summon corpse? I know it was only usable in the zone your body was in, but that's part of what made EQ (and classic) amazing games - class identity and utility.
---
We just made an offtank spam hamstring.  But yeah having 2 really helps with the uptime.  The debuff is just too good.
---
but they're not speaking from experience with best buy. I worked for a competitor of best buy, and there was nothing free about any product placement (except for that store where the guy set Gabe up on all the tablets as a prank).
---
I mean, your argument requires the belief that Best Buy, home of Geek Squad, *is fond of leaving money on the table.*
---
To each their own. I didn’t play EQ 2 at launch though I knew how the class system was set up seemed really cool to me. No one I knew liked it though.
---
Really want this to happen too!
---
thats on purpose. it sure is a whole lot better than layering all the zones for the entire p1
---
How about healer? Because I'll do that if the tank is taking too long. It's annoying af to have so much downtime when it's not needed.
---
The vast majority of the time, you'll have greater than 100ms to get your action in a batch. The part that takes skill isn't getting into the same batch; the skill is in predicting when your opponent will cast his spell. For some that's super easy, like blinding/fearing the moment a polymorph hits, but at other times, like for instant casts, it can be far more difficult. You need intuition, and to have fought/played enough of your opponent's class to know what options they have.
---
I recommend practicing your batching abilities by jumping in any direction when a warrior charges you. You'll know how good your timing was by how far you jumped. The issue people likely have with timing is they're closer to 400ms than they are to 50 or 100ms, so they'll hit the window far less often.
---
Feel free to message if interested in a guild focused on PvE progession at first. Then, we will be intent on putting our mark on the PvP scene: world and BG.
---
A dozen or so of us are getting back together from TBC glory days. We had the top PvP guild on server. We regularly camped Org as Alliance. Take 20 of us and sit outside gates on their graveyard for a couple of hours. I was top page gladiator and was GM. None of us intend to be no lifers but we plan to spend our extra time destroying Horde. (NA/2 Raid Nights).
---
When I worked computer retail, one of the sales managers did his guys' schedules based on who he raided with.
---
The problem seems to be that they do not want enough servers online for launch.
---
No approach is good enough honestly, 
---
Have plenty of servers = plenty of people will end up on dead realms like it happened in Vanilla.
---
Use some sharding tech = have shit like this. 
---
The main question everyone seems to forget is, what happens if the playercount stays high after months? Keep layering going up to phase 3? Still merging them down and introduce queues?
---
No stance from Blizz here, they seem to be set on "player count will die down fast".
---
whenever we had extra paladins, I would always demand blessing of might as a priest.
---
You realise in 1.0 the classes were a lot weaker right? All I'm saying is this wont be the vanilla most of us who started in 2014  remembered.
---
Baron / Cstrike also raids naxx on a pserver as a feral and warrior as well, I believe hes the guild lead or he at least leads the raids.
---
&gt; I mentioned my explanation earlier. A layer is cross continent.    
---
The thread we're in is about a video. That video shows layering that isn't cross-continent. You haven't explained that. Look at the thread you're replying to.
---
they're only going to have a set number of layers per realm, that's why they need more than 1 realm.  if a realm is full, that means all its layers are full, and if all the realms are full they need more realms.
---
I thought the wand/Melee weaving was pserver only?
---
ww axe + sweeping strikes + whirlwind is insane aoe dps and gives you a really good headstart on threat on aoe pulls.
---
I’ll walk you through his rational: Let’s say there are 100,000 people at launch (random number) - without layering, they might have 30 realms, so someone would need 10 accounts to reserve their name on each realm (10 accounts, 3 names per account, = 30 realms covered). With layering, they could use 10 realms which each have 3 layers, so someone would only need 4 accounts to cover every realm). Does that make sense?
---
&gt; He's not talking about tourism or population vacuums, the opposite actually. He's talking about a server becoming too full and thus needing more servers opened.
---
"Full" basically means there's a queue, because there's no space for another character. To combat a server being "full" you have layers, allowing more space for more people. You can't determine if a server is at max layer capacity based on a login screen so it would make zero sense to go with that definition of "full".
---
The first couple of expansions were as much a real-time social media platform as it was a game for a lot of players.
---
[Here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Armor) is some light reading for you.
---
He’s not wrong though
---
Thats fucking awesome! Honestly might roll a character with my manager and some of the other guys as well just so we can talk about that stuff at work too
---
We brought a dedicated prot pally to our raids on pservers. Anything with adds became a complete joke (suppression room? nef adds? Trash pulls (AKA \~70% of raiding)? lol). He could tank any boss that didn't require taunts. He even took the first tank spot on Vael a couple times. He just off-healed every fight that he couldn't tank. People write off 'meme specs' a bit too easily, IMO. Classic will not be difficult.
---
I bought one of these but the lid leaks unfortunately :(
---
You’re joking right?
---
Probably better off swapping annihilator MH and leaving NF for a hunter. If it’s a caster heavy comp 2 would be amazing.
---
I agree with your sentiment! 🌅
---
Even if it is that doesn't mean it's acceptable. I'm a child of polish post war refugees, bedtime stories were hearing my grandfather talk about watching his teachers get lined up and shot and similarly cheerful things.
---
Seeing shit like this in games takes me from "ah this is nice and relaxing" to "cool now I'm thinking about why my grandfather and grandmother can't sleep in the same bed (he thrashes around because ptsd) and how I've never had an extended family (they're all dead).
---
ww2 was one of the darkest moments in human history, the suffering for everyone was unreal. Many people today are still feeling the effects, why bring that shit up? Just be decent to each other.
---
I'm all for banning people from shared environments if all they want to do is make things less pleasant. They don't ass anything, the dude shouting nazi crap on the corner isn't adding some cool rp, or organising a wpvp situation, or whatever.
---
and blizzard loves collecting data for everything.  they can tell the difference between an account with a character on 3 separate realms, and an account with 3 characters on a single realm.  i think most people will be reserving 3 on the same realm, personally.
---
either way, telling us 3 realms are maybe possibly full is a heck of a lot more helpful to picking servers than going in completely blind.
---

Have raided all content in Vanilla up to AQ40 Twin Emps down and Cthun attempted. Stopped playing in WOTLK and retail now is strange.
---
Had a great relationship with my previous guilds but not in touch with anyone anymore. Love to be a team player, enjoy leading raids and PVP premades.

Plan on focusing souly on just my Warrior with Engineering and TBD, I actively fish and cook in game and provide what I can to my raids. Enjoy helping the guild out and running 5 Man's regularly.

I'm 30 Canadian, one 3 year old and work for a Police service, shift finishes at 6pm and I work days mostly unless I get called to do crime scene work at night. So I can make 7pm/8pm start times or later.
---
Looking for a new batch of friends and to relive the experience, I was planning on encountering players naturally on the server I roll on but now figure I'll get a head start so I can be of assistance to new friends while leveling.
---
I'm well aware. Not everyone has great internet now either. The point is that not everyone was playing vanilla on a laggy dial-up connection so making changes to the game based on the assumption that they were isn't logical.
---
&gt; Also patch 1.5 is still phase 2.
---
[No it isn't](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1121853269033328641&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fuser%2FEveClassic%2Fsubmitted%2F).

"Why play an MMO when everyone doesn't want to play exactly like I do?" - Mshaffy

Can you name something the classic dev team has done so far, that is horribly wrong in your eyes? Where is this hate coming from towards this specific team
---
Haha
---
this is awesome. thank you
---
&gt;This isnt relevant for classic wow
---
Yes it is. It shows the math you want.
---
&gt; DR% = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * AttackLevel)
---
A level 30 vs a mob with 1250 armor will have 29.76% damage reduction.
---
1250 / (1250 + 400 + 85 * 30)
---
^ that's 29.76%
---
Nice blog post.
---
Hey, hybrids were fine if you accepted and embraced your inferiority!
---
wants to bring back ghostcrawler, troll confirmed.
---
I wonder if  Ancient Petrified Leaf is farmable or not in the first phase... I know its a VERY rare drop in winterspring.
---

---
I think a lot people are taking vacation time off.
---
Mine too. 
---
And i really can't stand this uneducated arsehole.
---
Over 9000
---
Step 0.5: Tank didn't bring arrows or bullets
---
IIRC, all items will be using the stats they had in 1.12 regardless of the phase.   
---
Also, dungeon set 2 is tied to the release of Naxx, and Twilight Cultists will be tied to AQ40. (Necessary quest NPCs don't exist during earlier phases.)

I really don't think you're getting the point. Yes, some people were rich enough to afford amazing internet back then. Yes, some people have terrible internet now. But overall, internet quality has drastically gone up since 2004.
---
If you start the classic client and close your eyes the experience becomes even newer and mysterious. You’ll never see what’s coming next.
---
Here's what NOT to do in BFD:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luh4zWCeMRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luh4zWCeMRU)
---
Nelf rogues can have the highest native stealth, which is a small thing but cool. Tons of good rogues played nelf.
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
Well, the Winterspring mobs didn't have it on their loot tables until patch 1.5, so that would suggest it won't be available from them until Phase 3.
---
https://imgflip.com/i/34tanw
---
It's de-compiled. A program created the code and its only job is to compile into the same binary as the source.
---
So what happens if you drink while standing?
---
That's not even remotely the same. Hunters are supposedly "needed" for Tranq, yet it seems people still arent taking them. Druids are just complete shit and really no reason to take a non healing one.
---
Unfortunately, we are pretty adamant on rolling PvE since most of our members prefer it
---
I'm guessing we're gonna get to login through the normal client and pick a server through the normal server list. If populations are calculated off of total characters rather than currently playing characters it should show population
---
Played on some private realms that operated without leeway. It's an extremely bad time if your latency is over 100.
---
That is indeed what actually happened a lot, this entire post is very misleading.  You show the clientside functionality only, the server would not necessarily accept requests so nothing is really proven here.
---
Actually, no, that video illustrates what i just said, i looked back at it just now. the 2:40 - 2:42 instance of slow is procced before that trolls health bar ever moves. So that was actually one of those examples where the aura applied first before a damage tick.
---
So all that stuff you told me about was irrelevant basically to this specific function
---
This is honestly one of the worst "New dev team sux" posts I've ever read... and I read this sub *a lot.*
---
Yep.  I was a rogue too, had the same thing happen all the time. 
---
I don't know if this is just a Pserver thing, where everyone wants tips for clicking a button for a lockbox/food.  I'll do the button clicking for free, as long as someone asks politely.  
---
Now, with a mage if you ask them for 16 stacks of summoned water/food, that deserves a tip.  Just as much if you throw up 20 lock boxes in someone's trade window.
---
TY!
---
Your "measurement approach" was idiotic since it had absolutely nothing to do with the topic, like I tried to explain.
---
You're welcome.
---
Sprint does not, distract, pick pockets, and disarm trap.
---
I'm rolling pve, I've leveled a character on pvp servers three times and I never actually engage in world pvp because I just don't care about ganking lowbies or waiting around for someone to come by in blackrock mountain etc.
---
Nighthold has some of the best sets in the game. The mage set is gorgeous in all 4 color variants, the Priest set has probably the coolest cloth shoulders and helm of all time (M variant), the DK set is the best DK set of all time imo, and the Pally set going back to robes was awesome.
---
Yeah I was amazed looking at the loot tables. It’s heaven for me, as a warlock!
---
I fully understand the point you're trying to make, I'm simply pointing out why it doesn't really matter and why we shouldn't start changing how the game works just because some people had shitty internet back then.
---
Haha, that's my hand! 
---
Crazy to see this post come full circle years later.
---
I took this back when I was in law school... sadly this particular bottle broke, but I luckily bought 3 of them, lol.
---
The opposite, people were spamming this shit because the server goes offline forever in 2 hours who cares if you get banned or not
---
&gt; IIRC, all items will be using the stats they had in 1.12 regardless of the phase.
---
Yes, this is explained in the blue post at the top of my link.
---
&gt; Same is true for drop-tables.
---
No, this is explained in the blue post at the top of my link.
---
&gt; Necessary quest NPCs don't exist during earlier phases.
---
The necessary quest NPCs for the Dungeon Set 2 are in the Beta right now.
---
Dunno what you mean by swords or staves... Just looks like a hunter weapon to me?
---
I remember buying a new staff from there (white/common quality) and it cost all the gold and silver I had. I didn’t realise you could get weapon drops from dungeons or mobs and was used to RPG games where you bought items from shops. The one I bought had higher damage than the one I was using.
---
I was a Druid and I used to melee stuff down in caster form in between Moonfires.
---
I'm actually rolling a Druid first for Classic.
---
I was a Hunter main back in Vanilla so this time I figured I'd roleplay as my old pet.
---
According to "elite" players, you must be human for rogue or warrior, it is a must for try-hards. But horde doesnt have human rogues or human warriors. Does that mean horde is unable to complete raids?
---
Rhetorical question fyi
---
I've seen some guides on those questlines and they are pretty cryptic. I believe the Benediction and Rhok'delar questlines pay homage to the EQ questlines with the whole "Maybe you should find the original owner of this leaf?" and The Eye of Divinity doing nothing at all until you just happen to equip it in the right place so you can see the questgiver. I don't really like how modern games have evolved to hold your hand all the time. I can understand that some people want waypoints and it certainly makes designing quests easier, but it's sad that these epic mystery treasure hunts don't exist anymore. 
---
It's why I always tell new people to don't read guides on the major questlines in vanilla like the Legend of Stalvan, Linken, Darrowshire etc.
---
Also keep in mind that in Vanilla there was some race restrictions as to who can ride a mount-for example Mechanostriders could only be used by gnomes and dwarves. Also Tauren were restricted to wolves and Kodos (not counting the ZG mounts or deathcharger).
---
YOU DIE IN GAME YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE
---
Nothing wrong with looking forward to playing with a mostly positive and interactive community where your actions can really help someone. I'll always remember that 60 warrior in STV who just gave me the final 10g for my mount when he found me farming for the lvl 40 mount.
---
Classic has a sense of humor, retail has a sense of humour
---
Maybe easier but it's certainly better.
---
I can't see myself ever going shred while leveling. You just dont get the opportunity to do it much.
---
I think I agree, kind of. I think I'm gonna grab furor after swiftness and then Respec once I level more to grab FFF.
---
You can just...you know, RP while being on a PvP server.
---
PvE server players don't exactly have the same luxury on a PvP realm.
---
If you're going to make a claim like that, I'm going to need quotes with what you consider trolling. And not a single one of them should be opinions you simply disagree with.
---

The fringe areas of the internet are filled with non-normal people, How could this happen?

That's 41
---
Paladin T3 is darn rootin' tootin' neato.
---
Icc 25 man was easy enough, the groups on my server, or at least the 1 group i went with rather had people who wanted gear, pretty sure it was run by a handful of more geared alts from a raiding guild, so those 5 or so people were the ones that carried for the gold, so wouldnt make sense them bringing in people that werent going to contribute to any bidding.
---
In 1.12 and Classic all mounts are Bind on Pickup. Before then you could have someone who was Honored &amp; PvP rank 3+ buy them for you, saving you money. But not anymore.
---
As some people have pointed out already, this is a client side check. We don't have the server side code. It is most likely the case that the client gave you leeway to try an ability and the server checked to see if you were actually in range. 
---
I played a rogue quite a bit in Vanilla and I can't count the number of times I was told I could backstab someone, only to get the message that I'm too far away.
---
Lol I know better now
---
wheres the paladin, i only see a lobster
---
Rag will be downed either week one or a day or two into the second week. Not sure when exactly but I'd wager somewhere between day 6-9.
---
I always give 110 %
---
Or, hear me out here, lets just actually try it their way first?
---
Edit: Before you complain that we already have tried it their way, no... we haven't... everything so far has been a TEST
---
Savage
---
The heck is bandicam?
---
Super chill road to 60, strong flavor, good looking tier sets, always in super high demand for stones, summons and pact, decent dmg, amazing in pvp. Guess that tempts a pot of people to roll one
---
Played ret all vanilla.  I was mocked whenever I tried to get an invite to anything.  Every group would say “yeah right roll a real class”
---
Every guild would say “We don’t bring rets, heal and we’ll bring you”
---
Blizzard just censored titties in hearthstone, you really think they won't ban people for saying "poo poo pee pee" at this point?
---
&gt; Thoughts?
---
Yes. My thoughts are that we should print out all these suggested Layering fixes, douse them in gasoline, torch them, and then one by one, we urinate on them until they stop sizzling. And then we do the same to everyone suggesting those fixes.
---
They've added their own fixes to Layering to prevent exploiting and will continue testing it for the next couple months. They don't need your ideas.
---
I agree, someone was eventually going to take them to court in the grounds that private servers are merely offering a service that blizzard doesn’t. 
---
Classic is closing that argument so blizzard can really go after private servers.
---
Tailoring, de first greens you can craft. You can get the LME from the first green robes... On pserver anyway. I cant test the beta. You need two LME, one for the rod, one for the wand. 
---
When I focus linen dropping mobs I can get it right around lvl 9.
---
Salamander Scale Pants don't show up in the general item filtering if I check P1, P2, P3 and go to legs. Not sure why. 
---
Would you consider adding an option to filter which instance loot comes from even with filters checked? For example so that if I checked all 3 phases but only wanted to see MC loot, not also BWL loot.
---
14 years ago it would be fine but these days the meta is quite different. Putting 5 points in imp arcane shot is silly because you rarely would use arcane shot in pvp as it shares a cooldown with aimed shot and it does very little damage. Also, skipping hawk eye makes no sense as range is one of hunter strongest aspects of the class. Skipping surefooted and deterrence in the survival tree is very odd as well as they are incredible for pvp. 5 points in Improved hawkeye is not necessary. If you really want it 1 point is enough.
---
Easy for people who have dedicated their life to WoW perhaps. Not easy for us mere mortals.
---

Frank it sounds like you yearn for those days
---
It’s being done on purpose. Anti layering threads are being instantly deleted by the dozens for “spam”, while pro layering comments are always left up.
---
This is the best possible reply. You win.
---
That's wonderful
---
It comes out at the same time everyplace. No region with have an advantage.
---
Improved Arcane over increased range is a bit of a strange choice, but otherwise I think its pretty good.
---
I could be wrong but I believe that Taurens couldn't ride the normal Orc wolves, unless they changed this at some point.  I specifically recall grinding AV rep for the Frostwolf because it was the only Wolf (and only non-Kodo mount) that I could ride outside of crazy low % drops.
---
No. Not 3 days ago I bought a raptor mount for my alt on the Beta from my main because my main is Rank 3 and would save 8 gold.
---
Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.
---
Let me clarify: I was a druid pre-1.9. I played feral as often as possible. My alt was an enhancement shaman.
---
I don't even derive sexual pleasure from pain.
---
Well I know it comes out on the 26th for some, the 27th for others because of that. Just it terms of the first lockout
---
This build is terrible.
---
Is bash not considered an interrupt?
---
I didn’t know nor did the linked video have that info. Even less of a reason to push a feral build early on.
---
Depends if youre human or not, how much quests you did for that faction. Runecloth is gunna be very expensive early so its hard to say
---
Now do it on a private server with proper elite tuning.
---
So you cheated. 
---
Asshole.
---
Oh thank you! Sorry for the confusion
---
Arcane shot did not share a cooldown with Aimed Shot.
---
Malygos!!!
---
(In the upper right) What are my stat priorities from 31-39?  Seems odd to do 1-30 and then 40-59.
---
That’s achievable- was looking to sink 20-25 on average per week! (Also just got into a job that’s a standard 8-5 with a ton of flexibility)
---
Dude I miss being able to make friends. I made so many more friends in WoW a than I did in real life, it just comes so much more easily when we're paired together to run a dungeon or just strike up a conversation in trade chat.
---
I do a whole Mana Bars worth of Water/Food for people for whatever they choose to tip :/
---
Doubtful, seems like they want to stay true to classic as possible.
---
did some quick mafs off an old blog, to go from neutral - exalted using just cloth turn ins would take 840 20x stack turn ins. you better be rich boi
---
Strictly vanilla. If they were to do any tuning it would be with the lack luster classes themselves and people would probably flip shit.
---
&gt; Clever traps does not get used in PvP or PvE
---
Clever trap 100% gets used in pvp and will be mandatory in classic because scatter DRs with trap.
---
In Everquest, every mob in the world is about as powerful as an elite mob is in WoW except they have about twice the health that elites do in WoW. Because of this solo leveling was largely not a thing. Some classes were able to level solo without the help of others but it was difficult, risky, and almost always less efficient than grouping.
---
Everquest was also a lot more hardcore and grindier than WoW. If you pulled a mob that you couldn't kill and you were a class that didn't have feign death, congrats you've got a new buddy who will corpse camp you until you reach the zone border where you're able to zone out by hitting the loading trigger. Don't aggro any extra mobs by the way or you'll start a train who will never leave you alone until you zone out.  
---
Oh and there's a death penalty. You lose exp when you die. And if you don't retrieve your corpse you can lose it, meaning you lose everything you had in your inventory at the time.
---
Want to be a progression raider? Alright, here's an epic class quest for every class that everybody in your guild needs to complete in order to unlock the next raid. That's more than a hundred hours of work per player. And there's like 56 people in a raid. Oh that thing about mobs camping you? Raid mobs do that too.
---
That's Everquest for you.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
Very nice. Have fun tanking
---
[lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0)
---
A-effing-men.  I can't stand it when open world PvP is forced on me because I don't want it.  I spec as resto so I can heal dungeons while leveling up, which leaves me as a defenseless chud in a solo PvP environment.  I can't waste time as a ghost running back to my corpse while I'm pissed off.
---
Looking forward to BGs though.
---
Why would that offend me? Why would I consider that a zing?
---
Go smoke some more pot you loser stoner.
---
The lack of a taunt *is* a particular problem in pugs. Guild groups will be fine.
---
This circle jerk of lecturing people on not the downfalls of skinning because of seconds of downtime after a kill is fucking hilarious to be honest.
---
If we get more patches post 1.12 I can see them making new raids with better itemization to allow for more builds to shine. Before then no they will not.
---
took 6 months of getting little bullshit that culminated in me scummy down to trakanons lair in Lguk. logged out in the corner and waiting for him to spawn, a guild to come down and kill it. Once Trakanon dies. An undead bard will spawn in his place within 36 hours of the dragons death, you had be there when the bard spawns, on the right part of the quest with all the shit on you. and that spawns another trakanon poison dragon. The most stressed ive ever been was trying to convince my guild to send 30 people down here to kill it for me. It took even longer to obtain a gnome skin mask. [here is my bard in full class singing steel gear with the bard epic weapon on off hand. You can barely see the little blue notes flying around the blade.](https://imgur.com/a/FNyWPb0)
---
Yeah, actually really stoked that max level actually will have some merit again.
---
I'm rolling mage so I hope I can effectively AOE farm this shit lol
---
&gt; They buffed 1-10 to make it easier. Mobs die quicker, players die less.
---
Sauce? Everything so far has been corroborated as accurate.
---
Great summary! Also there were hardcore servers where if you died once, you're character would be gone forever. Eq really was the most hardcore mmo I know of.
---
And blue arrow it is!
---
Bye then.
---
What you just described to me makes total sense but I'm not gonna break through the echo chamber on this one apparently.
---
Sure neither does a Priest's Power Word Fort or Fear Ward or Fade or Abolish Disease or Dispel Magic....
---
So you can have a ton of dead servers after 3 weeks? Then trying to combine all the servers which changes everyone’s name/guild progress/server economy/server time? Oh and now we are adjusting spawns so people can camp them with their guild to increase spawn rate?
---
Yea how about no
---
Our retri in Naxx does about 500 dps, significantly higher on fights with lots of AoE like Anub and Noth. Our warriors range from 400-900 dps but most are around 700-800 dps. We use almost not consumables so the retri dps could definitely be higher. Personally I don't really care if one person does around half the dps of the others. He also AoE tanks and occasionally heals on some fights that really don't work with retris like Twin Emps. He's been there for every single raid and is very patient with loot while also wielding a Nightfall axe to buff the spellcasters.
---
What is a clicker alt?
---
It's fine. Items will be added whenever they get added. If they're there from the beginning that's fine too.
---
Be your own Nigh Elf Mohawk.
---
Big true
---
Interrupt stops spell casting.   Like kick or pummel, earthshock.   They have low cd.
---
Bash is a stun.
---
The point is that starting zones will be equally crowded either way.  Layering is just supposed to help the server stay at maximum population longer.  I'm saying that the original game was fine without layering and the servers will be fine, as the majority of them were in vanilla, without layering.
---
This has nothing to do with mangos.
---
That is my recollection as well.  Then again, that was 10+ years ago.
---
U are using it to play wow?
---
What some hardcore guilds will do is get warlock alts and level 1 alts to accompany them to summon the raid around azeroth to get all kinds of buffs before starting their raid.
---
I wouldn’t say people like or dislike it. But the vast majority of people that play any game don’t use any forum for it.
---
They've been marinating on private servers for years. Outside of this sub and a few select forums I promise you the tryhards are rare. There will be plenty of easygoing casuals when classic launches and we'll down content. Slower, but we'll have plenty of fun along the way.
---
yes it does
---
Lackluster?
---
It's a tough question.  I seem to run out of mana really fast at level 35 (fought a lvl 40 paladin in stranglethorn). Each point of int I'm getting 15 mana, stam gives me 10 life.
---
 I can turn 200 mana into 300 damage absorb, so that's about 13 int worth of mana vs 30 stam. That 30 stam would have about 25% dmg reduction against physical attacks however so I suppose it's more like ~22 stam worth of absorption
---
Ahh, this reminds me of my 'Halo 3 Modding' years
---
None of them will want to tank, in fact most of them will refuse to.
---
I mean warriors are arguably the only retail like class in vanilla. Every spec is good and they do very well in almost every aspect of the game just following the games gear progression.
---
Yea fair enough all i know is my job after 40hours im too mentaly and physically drained and then to play wow for 40hours a week aswell maybe im just getting old but dam thats dedication
---
yeah the devs didn't think it through 
---
Everquest had a shot at being the MMO
---
but instead it was wow
---
4:37 to 4:39
---
the npcs are not even on his screen but he gets hit by a melee hit
---
The most toxic
---
Thank you so much for bringing this to attention!!
---
Nobody at all is talking about this huge impact it will have on rogue gold farming..
---
I'm kinda scared to roll rogue if I can't make above 25-30gph!!
---
Hunters maraudon farm is 35gph+ depending on luck with leveling and some dungeon gear but that is with the /Camp and Reset from inside thing..
---
Also dm tribute gold farm is rumored to be ruined by Activision..
---
Really seems like so much is broken because of not being able to reset inside dung and /Camp.
---
Sure you can inv some1 and make it to raid, but that gets old very fast
---
I mean, they have the highest starting agility and a free rank in Master of Deception too. They’re clearly “the worst” from a min maxing perspective but OP is just asking why the min maxers find the small difference to be so big of a deal that they’ll never pick Nelf as race for a rogue since they do have some merits too, and you’re really bringing it home for him haha.
---
&gt; So you can have a ton of dead servers after 3 weeks?
---
Servers today can handle at least 4x as more than servers could back in 2004. Just allow a high population and the problem sorts itself out as people drop off. Servers only need 2500 to be the size of a full realm from vanilla. The need for layering isn't there, except when you don't want to launch a lot of servers. 
---
&gt; Oh and now we are adjusting spawns so people can camp them with their guild to increase spawn rate?
---
Dynamic spawns were a real thing in vanilla and Kevin Jordan has even said they adjusted spawn rates on launch to help alleviate the player traffic. It's something adjustable on the back end.
---

---
Here we go again.. Now we need another savior to measure screenshots from vanilla to prove to Blizzard their tech guy needs new glasses. (talking about that Gnome size post a while back)
---
At this point I think we might be getting masterfully trolled.
---
Healer mana = lock mana
---
Great post, this is actually a significant decrease in leveling speed , not only does the skinning action itself costs time but the swing timer gets reset. With the addition of batching causing a loot delay as well this all adds up to a lot of extra time for melee especially. Best alternative strategy for this would be to kill a bunch of mobs in the area and then drag them to the same kill locations and then spam loot and skin all at once so your swing timer is only affected one time. Or simply not skin at all if this isnt an option in most areas unless youve got a well thought grinding route
---
I love this chain of comments.  "How did you get to an impossible off limits place?"  "Had to alter game memory" "CHEATER THIS GUY IS A CHEATER!"..............
---
That's the only way you got to these places realistically.  So stop freaking out over it afterwards.  As long as they aren't still proponents of scripting/hacking let the past die.
---
What? I don't see anything but posts saying it's okay to not min-max and play hardcore. 
---
Personally I don't think anyone should tell anyone else how to play and I see this a lot from both casuals and hardcore alike. I don't find it fun grinding a bunch of gold so that I can use a bunch of usually unnecessary consumables. But I also don't like going into a raid with people who haven't even bothered watching a 5 minute video explaining the entire raid.
---
&gt; I can turn 200 mana into 300 damage absorb, so that's about 13 int worth of mana vs 30 stam.
---
You already mentioned that but yeah, that assumes you are not dying during CC. Imagine you had just 10 HP. Most classes could kill your 310 HP pretty quickly. Does not matter how much mana you can turn into absorb.
---
On top of that you can only convert 300 absorb per 30 seconds, that is 10 per second. That is regen levels of low over time. Most fights are decided before that. Anything beyond your 200 mana is often irrelevant.
---
&gt; It's a tough question.
---
In a duel situation spirit is almost entirely useless. It's all about having just enough stam and as much int as possible at low levels.
---
But in wpvp you are not in duel situations. Fights are initiated out of questing/grinding. You are usually not at 100% mana, you are using your resource.
---
No amount of maximum mana matters if your current mana is low enough. While intelligence increases your maximum mana, spirit makes sure your current mana is actually high enough.
---
In the end, they compliment each other nicely. If you have too much int, you will be oom a lot and run around at lower current mana. If you have too much spirit you will always be at full mana, which is not a whole lot since you are neglecting int. The more spirit you have the better your int gets and vice versa.
---
In the end you will want both for leveling WPvP situations. In PvE leveling you want just the spirit.
---
So I would prio spirit as I do both WPvP and grind PvE. But still get int. Perhaps 2:1ish.
---
The nice thing about spirit is you can swap gear sets to a more stamina centric set. Just use an addon to do this when you feel there is risk. Of course you would miss your stamina vs. rogues - a situation where it is most needed. But you could still use your defensive gear when getting into new areas and just swap to a more efficient leveling gear after five minutes or so. (If there is a rogue, he will probably gank you before that).
---
Ah.  I'm not really versed in gauging with my eye between random points in Durotar.  There's no clear indicator for distance here we can really go on.  Thinks like having or not having Hawk Eye are important here too.
---
The easiest way if you cant find it through discord is just Google wow classic guilds discord you'll get a link that will invite you to the channel
---
Who knows at this point.
---
Holy shit I haven't seen the name CauthonLuck in years.  Left Frostwolf for Frostmane but hardly miss being constantly abused by Shadows of the Horde
---
I guess it all comes down to individual priorities. That whole "one world" feeling in vanilla is, in my opinion, more important than initial launch chaos and log in queues.
---
Take this video clip for example. What if a friend was telling me to check out this crazy good PvPer outside Ieonforge. I hearth or fly there, go outside and it's empty. That totally kills the immersion and feel of the game for me and I would much much rather sit in a log in queue than deal with that.
---
Thabk you!
---
The crying about leeway is because people don't think it existed in classic.
---
Idk about the spell batching. I feel like a vast majority are satisfied with it.
---
Layering is going to be disabled in phase 2 anyway
---
Dwarf priest is highly prized for fear ward alone. It’s very strong in vanilla. A 10m fear block on a 30s CD and stoneform for bleeds, poison, with even more armor is a very strong pvp kit. Tbh I’d always recommend dwarf for any pvp centric character.
---
Stay mad retail kiddy.
---
I do not like this asmond guy one bit but I do like how streamers like him allows bugs and exploits to be discovered quickly due to the fac that they have everything recorded.
---
I’m a pretty big try hard person , and the thought of world buffs is VERY annoying to me lol. Hopefully the CD thing from private servers to retail makes these rare.
---
OMG its him 
---
the man himself!
---
The fact that retail has at one time had 12 million subs meanwhile the subreddit only has 1 million subs.
---
Yep, gaming really isn't social anymore and it's a damn shame!
---
Is human more optimal for combat swords pve? Yes. Does that matter? Depends on who you are as a person.
---
can we get one of these for a computer monitor??
---
Same, tbh. Competing for mobs really wasn't that bad of a thing back in the day. Adding shit like layering is blizzard sacrificing player interactions for convenience yet again.
---
Sounds like you're bound to be either guildless or play in some clown fiesta of a guild. Good luck and have fun.
---
*tinfoil*
---
Could be a bug introduced from them trying to fix leeway.
---
Not new thats how its always been.
---
I wholeheartedly prefer PvE servers.
---
When I'm out doing a task like leveling or farming mats engaging in world PvP feels like a complete waste of my time from achieving my goals. WoW is already a time consuming game as it is I don't need to make it even worse by playing on a PvP server. Even if I do win the PvP encounter it still feels like a waste of time to me.
---
It's not that I dislike PvP either. I had &gt;2300 3v3 rating during WotLK and the Battlemaster achievement. I've PvP'd plenty. But I prefer instanced PvP where everyone there wants to PvP and it's fairly balanced. Most world PvP scenarios involve a ?? ganking you, 3-on-1 battles or at the very least someone attacking you while you're engaged with mobs. I see no reason to give other players the ability to block my progression in the game or at the very least significantly waste my time.
---
With all that said I have over 750 days /played in WoW and all of it has been spent on PvP servers because that's always where my friends wanted to play and I prioritize playing with them over playing on the server type I would enjoy more. It looks like that's going to be the case with Classic as well unfortunately.
---
You can stop your concern trolling now thanks.
---
 People would rather okay with optimal classes and good players instead of xXxLeGoLaSxXx. Deal with it. You can always  just go play with the 50% who don't give a flying fuck about anything and see how "easy as shit" the content really is.
---
me and my brother both dual boxing, full group spamming dungeons/elite quests whenever we want, never have to rely/wait on other people.
---
What was your mains name?  I was an undead mage named lilstunna.  Had a PvP video.  Became decently well known around Blackrock mountain and played against Boo etc
---
No they didn't.  And the mobs in the first areas (Northshire, red cloud mesa, etc) were always easy.
---
You got downvoted by mad retail kids lol.
---
Sad when people downvote even though the comment is only informative and not opinoinated.
---
This is what’s referred to in many cultures, as a retarded post.
---
Honestly reserving items was pretty common on my server in vanilla. Also lfm ubrs full on warriors and rogues.
---
It was great. It kept all the shitters away. Most garbage can players didn't make it past the second zone. This left you with mostly good players.
---
+1 level stealth is pretty decent for PvP and great for leveling because mobs.can be higher level than you
---
Range and 5/5 in hit aren't really necessary so Blackout is incredibly easy to gain with very, very little loss.
---
I got a bunch of good ffxi gm stories. One time in crawlers nest a lvl 75 player was training all the crawlers to the entrance so they would walk back and wipe our group leveling. I called a GM after a few wipes and we talked for a good while, and i got her to appear next to me. She popped up and died instantly to a crawler then disapeared and laughed about it with me. Another time I got sent to gm jail for speed hacking and while being questioned I put the speed on maximum and ran circles around the GM. Eventually we agreed to a 1 week ban if I sent the link for where the hack was from
---
For sure, just drop Shadow Reach and 2 points in hit. There's no reason to have 10% hit on Shadow spells
---
No need to get defensive I don't think I implied that you endorsed it. I was adding my own thoughts that's all
---
Hey, It's T2, didn't think I'd see him brought up around here. He made a youtube video the other day going over whether or not he'll be playing Classic, his channel is https://www.youtube.com/user/HypocriticalMass

He streamed later that night and got a good response, his stream is https://www.twitch.tv/t2darlantan if anyone feels like checking it out and seeing what he's been up to.

Good content but it's way too visually cluttered

Damage off the curse chart is reason enough not to give one a slot. TF and SS debuffs are not reasons to justify them either. 70 NR on bosses is a large dps decrease.

---
plus more gold
---
If +5 swords is the difference between a good and bad player in your eyes I don't even know what to say.
---
i like this one most lol
---
The issue without layering would be sitting in a queue for 8 hours not able to log in
---
You're in for a treat.
---
I've played WoW before. Ranged inherently have an advantage. It's on the melee to overcome it. 
---
I educated you.
---
BGs don't come out in the first release, talk to you in a year
---
All they had to do was copy paste the game they made freaking 15 years ago, but they even managed to fuck that up.
---
Who cares that we might have to wait in queue , I'd rather they'd have added 100 servers that eventually die and be forced to merge them over the shit layering has created.
---
This is seriously destroying the hype I had built up, what a fucking mess.
---
That art alone makes me want to roll fem human priest.
---
Great work, but you have a few conditions that are off.
---
For example your war stomp macro (button 5): on press [mod: alt, @player] warstomp would be cast but also hurricane would be cast at the same time because the condition of [stance:0] is true.
---
that's athene level whatever for me
---
Loved his south park cameo appearance
---
Bahaha of course they did. It's a sure sign of decline when a company starts selling something that every living thing on the planet needs.
---
Yeah 2 points early on then 3 more after Silence/VE
---
Right...so because they are trying to piss people off on purpose...that means it's totally OK...
---
Interesting...
---
+5 weapon skill is not small. I understand 3% hit and reducing the glancing penalty from 35% to 15% sounds small. But in a raid environment, it is not.
---
The PvE aspect as a rogue is a game of wanting to see bigger and bigger numbers. Of getting upgrades and becoming better and better. Of trying to do more damage than the others. Doing the most damage.
---
In that aspect it is a bit like playing without wearing gloves. The point here is that the difference in this case of PvE for rogues is not small.
---
That's so easy that I feel like that market will become too saturated very quickly. I could try though, definitely at odd hours.
---
Sounds like fun. I'm getting excited. I never got into healing at all. What was the best healer?
---
&gt;  I never understood why I ran into so many people during games being like this.
---
I just answered him why they do it. If you don't like it just put them on ignore.
---
Is there a term for stereotyping sections on political spectrum?
---
If you flag yourself while leveling pve, trust me, you're gonna get ganked
---
Nightfall for raiding, zinrohk/ashkandi (after melee), and barbarous prebis
---
The solutions to the fact that the population will be wildly different launch day and a month in are basically 1) use layering, slowly add servers and eliminate layering if the drop off isn't that bad or 2) don't layer add a ton of servers, end up having to merge them all and piss half the playerbase off. That's all I'm saying.
---
this post is completely correct. Needs to be upvoted. 
---
If you're upgrading your wands like the wallpaper suggests, then mobs won't be surviving beyond the untalented duration of SW:P. Also, doesn't make sense to respec before shadowform (level 40). Arguably 44-45 is even better (shadowform, higher rank mind flay, and 4-5/5 imp wand).
---
Classes like hunters will probably only be exiled in the hardcore top tier raiding guilds. For more moderate raiding hunters would probably be acceptable and having different classes allows more utility, but they probably wouldn't be in as high demand.
---
It’s about 30 yards old timer
---
Best way to make gold in vanilla Warcraft, sit in IF/Org spamming trade and hunting the AH.
---
[I've already answered this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8hqta/i_have_very_little_faith_in_classic_but_not_for/esn1a56/)
---
If I remember correctly melee range has always been 5yds regardless whether a 1hd or 2hd weapon is being used (some class specific skills were an exception like whirlwind which has an 8yd range I believe). I could be wrong but I can not find any reference to the 8yd range you are talking about.
---
I think the main issue were seeing with the current version of Leeway, as multiple people have said, is the constant 3-5yd range increase if both targets are running. I mean if this is to remain there may be instances where a tauren warrior can hit a mage with melee attacks from \~12yds while the mage casts frost nova and the warrior is unaffected due to being out of range (10yd range on frost nova).
---
I would test leeway. Maybe they changed the range on stuff?
---
&gt;But Classic is a move by Blizz to protect their IP and be able to sue and shut down private servers.
---
The countries that host private servers don't or can't enforce American intellectual property law (at least not effectively). Outside of China, many European countries have the highest rates of software piracy in the world. ~63% of software used in Russia is pirated, and many other European countries have comparable numbers, even if they are WIPO members. To give credit where it's due, some countries seem to have legitimately tried to crack down on pirating and copyright/ip theft (via new laws, etc.) but still failed. That's not going to change when Classic WoW comes out.  
---
The argument that Blizzard doesn't have vanilla servers and therefore people can legally host unofficial versions has always been a theoretical defense that's been thrown around when people discuss potential court arguments. That's never actually been the issue at hand; nobody has ever successfully argued that to a judge in regards to WoW, and Blizzard hasn't been withholding cease and desist notices because they don't have official servers up yet.
---
A more realistic outcome would be the Gabe Newell/ Steam philosophy, where if you give people a legitimate product at a fair price, they are less likely to pirate or use illegitimate versions.
---
People literally make shit up to ruin their potential fun.
---
Your mind is your enemy.
---
Not even just dps.  I've gotten shit here for stating Paladins are not viable tanks in vanilla.
---
Source:  Played a paladin for the entirety of vanilla
---
Pallies can tank everything except 40mans.  Its just tougher to pull off than warriors and druids
---
well my view is 8 years pserver experience, but im all for people trying their own specs, thats how i found my own favourite spec ever, hybrid priest.
---
Where'd you get it???
---
But that's irrelevant to the fact that Koreans play WOW and they will be killing people in STV in PVP
---
Or, Blizz just pulls it's IP from the countries hosting until they take IP-violating content down, which has been done before.
---
Dire maul isn't going to be in the game until phase two.
---
Force reactive, sappers/grenades, and immolation oil will put up crazy numbers on fankriss.
---
Exactly friend and after I get tank gear I will be rolling even on leather or swords for my dps/ mob killing gear.
---
I remember doing RFK in classic with a warrior insisting it was fine taking 2h without a shield. 
---
The hike was a bitch as alliance.
---
3 wipes before the first boss and the warrior admitted to having no shield meanwhile blaming the wipes on shit dps and a brain dead healer. 
---
Healer left before we could kill first boss. 
---
Group fell apart after that. 
---
"Do you have a sheild" became the awkward question i asked tanks for months after that while leveling....
---
Nothing is 'necessary'. You can do fine without, but it helps.
---
Good points. So weird, everything up until this question was that they are basically needed for Tranq and kiting.
---
Yeah for sure, although crippling and a good rogue can be a serious bitch to get away from
---
Why would you hamstring before rend? You're likely going to kill the target before rend expires, so apply it first.
---
The good goblin crafts are also BoE so gnomish is better overall. Death ray scales off HP iirc.
---
Why would it be added twice/either direction? I'd imagine its a +2.6yd increase to the range of the attacking player, not a hitbox increase to the target. So in other words if the above code is legit/correct then melee leeway is 5yds+2.6yds=\~7.5yds if certain conditions are met.
---
Not sure if it’s been done, but I wouldn’t mind seeing a Hunter(Alliance).
---
Hybrid Druid is a strong counter to rogue and mage. Good ones just happen to be rare is all.
---
[Here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bxayrjnkny) are two graphs I made to show you how armour scales. The blue graph is against a level 60 attacker and the red graph is against a level 63 (boss) attacker. 
---
You can easily see how important armour is for casters. My priest right now has 824 armour which gives me a 12.3% reduction against a 60. Applying Inner Fire bumps that up to 2219 which is 27.19%. So in this case Inner Fire is an almost 15% physical damage reduction. I feel like this is largely unknown by casters. Armour carries a lot of weight at lower levels.
---
We're not talking about getting to GM island.  Programmer Isle required cheating, that was what someone asked how did he do it.
---
6 hour queue is alittle extreme. Maybe if it was only for the first day or something but 6 hours every day during the launch week? Well no I guess I wouldn't prefer that.
---
Do you have any sources on it being per zone? Its the first time I've heard of it and if makes no sense they would handle it like that since it sounds like it's basically a shard.
---
I legit want this shield so I'm going engineering for sure now. How quickly does it's durability degrade though?
---
Thank you so much for your dedication and work!
---
A hybrid druid build of equal gear who gets their opener first is a strong counter to rogues. Just go out and find the very rare good ones and you will be enlightened.
---
Imo it's unlikely DM is out 8 weeks after classic launch. I could definitely be wrong though.
---
Idk why I feel like phase 1 will be 10 weeks...
---
Well if it's 31 yards, then it's out of range.
---
I blame heirlooms.
---
I agree I always have 3/3 in ele precision , vanilla resists are just too OP
---
Yes.
---
My exact thoughts. I no longer have the crazy amount of time I did as a teenager. I want to get on and be able to play without getting camped or changing what quest I'm trying to do because of someone else.
---
Same with many other games, I used to love playing on more difficult settings because I had the time to grind it out. Now I want I just want to play and get stuff done.
---
It degrades fairly quickly depending the the amount of mobs triggering procs. You’ll likely need 2+ to accommodate large pulls.
---
Particularly when you know the dungeon well. I've used my pet as a tank during a 5 man when the tank had to leave. Doable but not great.
---
It's not difficult at all to keep threat as a warrior while leveling. A ton of your abilities have "generates a high amount of threat" built into the tooltips. Spam sunder armor and mix in some revenges and heroic strikes = you're golden. 
---
You'll hear "If you need to use taunt, you're doing it wrong" from youtubers a lot but with the influx of retail players there are a LOT of DPS now don't wait for me to even hit mobs before attacking them. Don't be afraid to use it frequently.
---
Don't be salty about one of the greatest video game montages of all time
---
&gt;server side client
---
Dear lord
---
Hahahaha
---
The key here is that it is a way to gain threat on a boss that is currently out of your range. Sometimes ranged classes will just keep plugging a boss even when you can't reach them, by healing yourself can *somewhat* try to counteract that.
---
IDA created a C version of what it thought the assembly might have looked like. It is essentially an easier to read version of the raw assembly. The original code was likely written in C++ making even the pseudo C generated still hard to read.

How expensive or difficult are the mats to acquire?

BIG THRIST
---
I'm under the impression blizzard under estimates the Classic fandom. 
---
I've worked in the same company for about a decade. Out of the blue one of my work Google hangouts blows up with excitement over classic. People taking about the good ole days, the guilds they'll be running with, goals and expectations, etc.
---
I've never once played video games with these people. Been playing retail off and on roughly one stretch an expansion and wow has never come up in conversation. Out of all games to make my coworkers excited is a 15 year old reboot?
---
Okay. Hopefully your experience is exactly what you want it be.
---
It's a mechanic not an advantage. 
---
No, you tried and failed.
---
It did not. That is merely your perception of it because you have not taken the time to ignore or block the threads or posters negatively influence your perception of the community.
---
I honsetly do not think it will be that bad. Launch day it'll be bad, but not 1k people in a zone competing on a single mob. People are clever and will go to other zones to level, naturally creating a balance.
---
I am a programmer by trade and trying to preemptively fix problems that only theoretically exist is one of the banes of my existence. Plan for the now while acknowledging the problems with your current implementation. If your fears are realized t hen you are already prepped to fix the problem. Don't sacrifice development time and system resources for theoretical shit that may happen. 
---
Layering should've been a contingency plan if the demand was overwhelming. Implementing it day 1 is a bad idea imo.
---
These are definitely amazing. Thank you
---
You login to an RP server to gain another level of immersion. You give your character a persona, and you play that part in the world. You interact with other Player-Characters, as your Avatar with the persona you created for them would interact with them and not how you, the 20 year old chemistry student would.
---
The environment and conversations you'll have on an RP server, especially in Vanilla are character driven and very different and oftentimes more mature than non RP servers. Granted there are a lot of freaks out there.
---
It's just being a part of the story rather than reading through it.
---
What is hard about retail dungeons? No threat/mana problems for the most part. Tons of tools to work with and easy on demand dmg single and aoe. Raids are more free loot with extra bonus loot minus like mythic which a tiny number of players do. Rotations are more complex but they still have to work for Uber casuals so it’s not that complicated. Like fury warrior? So complex lol. Classic isn’t that hard but it’s not brain dead easy like retail either.
---
You're right on all counts. I rewrote my macros instead of copy-pasting them. Button 5 should have [stance:0,nomod]. I actually wrote out help and harm for organization, then trimmed one to cut down the character count. It's correct in my game and in the other thread, but I absent-mindedly got it backwards there (not a great way to start the macro list, huh?).
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
The people who want to be max level will put in the time and generally when you put in the time you more thoroughly understand how your class works.
---
where'd you get the 1.12 client?
---
With those graphics I wouldn’t see shit either
---
shaman wanst tidal focus and not impr. HW , main reason: healing wave is hardly better (hps/hpm)  than lhw  WITHOUT  healingWAY-talent.  (and it's too slow for pvp)  .  
---
also you will use chainheal a lot in pve and you will want that -5% manacost.
---
It is specifically the threads you are reading and the people who you converse with. You play whatever you want to play and you hang out with people who's perception of you or your character is something that will be a positive experience in your gameplay. Or you can hang out with elitist jerks who make fun of your night elf Rogue constantly if that is your thing.
---
no
---
Well the math checks out. During leveling the extra damage gain from strength doesnt outweigh the reduced downtime between farming. That being said? Strength prio is better if you dont grind efficiently.
---
Looks awesome. This will probably be my desktop background by the 27th.
---
Might flow better if you remove the alliance questing zones from the horde and vice versa to make it look a little cleaner.
---
Also, for weapon progression, I think just knowing its an upgrade is enough, so it's possible to remove the DPS and you can color code quests and drops to remove some of the filler as well. Like turn the quest name yellow and remove the work quest, or turn the boss it drops from blue and remove the drop %.
---
Take my upvote.

In my experience it started to dawn on people during the AQ period how insane fury can be. I remember the rogue tears over new loot competition all too well.
---
Then you know when you should start playing
---
I doubt it would be that interesting but I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has.
---
Play what you want to play
---
We already knew there won't be OCE servers this is nothing new.
---
Absolutely not - he’s referring to the large numbers of players that will be attempting to log in at once, and how they will be nesting several server populations inside one server with layering. You will still be competing with a servers worth of players on your layer - go read the detailed blue post explanation of layering again.
---
I'm sure that was part of it. They guild leaders needed to recruit more players, but they also had to incentivize the regular raiders to suffer carrying a bunch of randos who couldn't be counted on. These try-outs were mostly MC or ZG/AC20 later in the server life, so the core could still expect to succeed. The raiders who went would only be missing a few pieces, so the PUGs got to pick through the trash DKP-free. It wasn't as one-sided as I may have made it seem in the OP.
---
They don't

Yo mama is so fat, she uses sheep for tampons.
---
&gt; talking about that Gnome size post a while back)
---
Was Blizzard proven wrong saying that Gnomes were the correct height? I didn't see that.
---
Maaaan so many people care about their name.
---
Also, mobs could sense you through the geometry. They didn't need line of sight. So if you went in a cave/maze you could end up attracting all sorts of mobs that you couldn't sense.
---
true, if this was only client side it wouldn't be different in pservers
---
Classic is that wonderful mix of people you consider real life friends you can depend on and a smorgasbord of people that are so toxic you would think they are playing from a prison cell.
---
"so many Warriors it will be very hard for me to find a Tank spot."

I remember dying there and it was before they added the location of your grave or teleport back to the spirit to ressurect you. I spent almost 2 hours trying to find my corpse then gave up and spent another 30 mins looking for the rez spirit.
---
&gt;Ulduar
---
Ulduar was also the only raid HC done right, the rest "click this menu option to increas HP damages and abilities" is just bullshit.
---
I love my Enhancement Shammy and everything tells me to pick Orc but I just love my trolls mon. Going Enhancement probably tells you all you need to know about the lack of fucks I give for min maxing haha
---
All about balance.  And this is why we need RP PvP servers.
---
&gt; It definitely seems like leeway existed, but is it identical? Is it different enough to matter?
---
OP's evidence seems to show that Vanilla leeway and Classic leeway function in the same manner.  That is, it wasn't a "check if someone moved out of your melee range" system like the comment you quoted said, but instead was a "give a flat range increase if both attacker and target are moving" as it is on Classic.  The values may or may not be accurate, but the mechanical functionality seems clearly to be correct.
---
EQ2 which was a wow competitor had solo leveling although not as good as party leveling. They also got rid of death xp and corpse runs early on. WoW prevailed because players could play casually, whereas EQ2 required you to devote your life to it to get any measure of real progression.
---
I am a huge fantasy fan and mostly care about class itself, not meters. I always pick a class that I know I'd enjoy leveling, I never ever look at charts and think "Damn I should play as a rogue because his dps is sick", it breaks immersion for me. But obviously I try to do my best, collecting BiS items :)
---
My main concern is the PvP set vendor.
---
Will the Grand Marshal healing mace, and Grand Marshal's Swift Blade be available when the PvP system launches ... even if you can't get it till phase 3 because the grind takes so long ... if it launches in phase 2, that's BIS through 3 raid dungeons, no?
---
The main worry I have with this is: If they are released later ... do people have to do the hardest grind in the history of gaming *twice* to get the new stuff, if they did the grind in an earlier phase?
---
That would make me physically ill.
---
I doubt more than 20% of them will make it to 60.  I think I only made it to like 28 or so when I leveled one back as a teenager.
---
You mean to tell me that you want to *socialize* on a massive *multiplayer* game?
---
Total cringe bro - nobody does that.
---
^^^obvious ^^^/s
---
You would be surprised. I worked policy for a social media company and within my NDA I did a AMA and people loved it. I know every GM I ever met was very kind, and I know some even came to watch us do server firsts. 
---
They also did things like after my friends like 5th name change (clitauren, clithauren, etc etc) they just changed his hilariously well known and stupidly geared shamans name to shootingstar or something else that was great. Fun way of putting him in his place without a ban.
---
How much copper was this?
---
Bingo.
---
Holy shit thanks for reminding me how awesome orc females look in plate
---
So did 100% of feral tanks
---
Yes. I played a caster (I think mage) till about level 17 or so. I remember getting a group and grinding whirling dervish all weekend to get one level. I spent that weekend staring at chat (to make sure we weren't panicking and running) and my spellbook. The attack phase for my character was just a minute or two followed by at least that long staring at the pages again.
---
I did the back of the envelope math on how long it would take to finish leveling and canceled my sub. The rest of that sub was bitter sweet. I was sad that I wouldn't be playing anymore but I knew it was the right decision because I knew ultimately I wasn't going to enjoy the experience all that much. Maybe I was playing the wrong class but I think EQ was just not the experience I wanted.
---
I did resubscribe one more time when an expansion came out. I tried the lizard monk that time but I don't recall making it much past the starter area.
---
You can play EQ for free now (plus whatever microtransaction stuff keeps the servers afloat). I made a character again for nostalgia sake but the UI is so dated and clunky now that I only lasted about an hour before I decided it was best to leave the fun parts of EQ in my memories.
---
Under the big tree at the top of the ramp. I had an alt parked there to help friends tame him.

I usually just have that shit away for free.  I never did have a ton of people bother me.  I enjoyed being helpful to the few that asked me.
---
&gt;In fact we have evidence to support the opposite. The Beta has the Gurubashi Arena event available (added in patch 1.4) and the quest to obtain Arena Grand Master (added in patch 1.5). So either that means the beta has been on Phase 3 the entire time, or quests aren't going to have progressive releases like "vendor lists and treasure tables". 
---
Quests related to the world and outdoor content will all be on release, like all the new quests that were added in Searing gorge and Hinterlands
---
Gurubashi arena is considered like one of them
---
Quests related to dungeons or end game that came later won't available at launch
---
I remember that period too.  I remember my guild brought a tank to MT UBRS back when people ran it with 20-25 people and he didn't have a shield and couldn't hold aggro.  We basically pet/DPS tanked the whole instance.
---
2h tanking isn't hard to do, but it's the kind of thing you do while always have a sword and board ready to switch back to depending on mob damage.
---
not this one, i posted the other one [https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=51](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=51)

lol! too funny. I actually remember a few situations like that, usually I'd give them names of flowers of some kind if they kept picking inappropriate names.

My friends bothers, mothers, daughters friends works for blizzard and they say that OCE severs are still happening. So i dont know who to believe here. Both creditable sources.
---
Okay, that answers a couple questions, but not the big one.
---
that pic below the talents don't make sense, can we have a picture of a durpy human wearing a brown robe flinging his lesser magic stick
---
I mean, read the other post OP linked. Some people were pretty sure it was in no way in vanilla.
---
Vanilla pretty much used EQ as a base but made it more healthy and reasonable
---
"""friends"""
---
I’ve been on layers of Org that had 3 people in it in beta. And when I went to my friends layer, there were also about 3 people there.
---
In vanilla my thought process was, I like bows and spears. Dual wielding is also awesome. Im going to be an archer. Rolled a hunter and loved it. For me class fantasy is number one. I can focus on trying to be the best whatever I chose to be after that is decided. I'm not rolling the same thing this time around though because I've changed a little and learned what I enjoy more.
---
Extended range was added in Cata, leeway is when an attack or spell starts before the opponent moves out of range and there is a window where it still goes through.
---
Right now it works plus there is the extended range that shouldn't exist, this is why you can see some ridiculous hit ranges because the leeway stacks with the extended range.
---
Yes that's as soon as possible
---
I also use numpad.  
---
1. Skull (First)
---
2. Cross (Second)
---
3. Triangle (Third)
---
4. Square (CC)
---
5. 
---
6. Moon (Sheep)

Said retail WoW player to someone describing Classic to them.
---
?
---
luckily human warrior is both my class fantasy and the min-max option
---
That's the spirit, hope I meet people like you !
---
I believe the same logic applies to layering - it also shouldn't affect much past the first few zones for the first few weeks. I will agree that if layering exists past even level 20 for months on end then Blizzard has massively fucked up, but having it make the game playable the first week is not a bad thing at all. It's all a matter of degree, and the saltlords are just convinced Blizz is going to let layering exist for 3 months all the way up to 60 when they have zero indication that that is what is going to happen.
---
The argument in the other post that OP was responding to was whether it existed or not.
---
no the meta wont change, mage, lock warriorcraft is still gunna be it
---
Im not so sure what you’re saying is true. I’m in beta and I’ve switched layers when players in different parts of the world invited me to group.
---
That's what the people want, him reacting to shit. 
---
He has 3 faces, confused, angry, and smug

It's like Joe Rogan for Warcraft to me

Excuse me? Dont know a single person who said leeway didnt exist.
---
It wasn't that horrible

Plus this ironforge gate thing was happening before.  Not sure the exact circumstance in either.
---
None of this explains the 12 yard range on the beta, leeway is fine but it’s clearly wrong on the beta
---
Since everyone here is making EQ sound like some kind of torture you have to pay for, let me offer a slightly different perspective(note: it's not mine):
---
&gt;EQ basically spawned the current generation of MMORPGS, so there are a lot of similarities here. Where it ventures off completely is the difficulty level. Some classes are legitimately boring, so I knew I needed to play a more active one. I grabbed Bard and went for it. 
---
Right off the bat, you realize soloing sucks, so groups are key. And since it was so early on, there were a ton of groups. I grabbed one and went out as designated puller, grabbing us crap to kill. Of course, coming from WoW I went a little overboard a few times and we had to run for the zone line to escape, but that's just part of the charm. It's a dangerous game and playing in dangerous locations is always more rewarding, albeit with massive consequences. Many like to chill in overland zones and do it slow, but I stuck to dungeons where 1 extra mob too many could mean wipe. Luckily bards are probably the coolest class in any game, so I got amazingly good at chain pulling and crowd controlling the trans of crap I'd bring back for everyone to work on. There was little actual DPS going out by me. A full on support character, something I've missed a ton. My friend list grew massively every day, and I'd regularly pull a group together from people I'd previously worked with. 
---
Eventually once I hit around 48 I joined a raiding guild that was pushing for the top and with many of who's members I'd joined with while leveling. I wasn't planning on doing hardcore raids, but the comradery I'd built with these people during the grind was hard to resist, so there I was. PVP in everquest is more around who can coordinate the fastest and, we did a whole bunch of competing with other guilds for world spawns. This is something I missed a ton, as instanced raiding never really had real pressure for me. Racing to DPS a boss down harder than another guild or getting that surge of "TIME TO GO!" when something popped and we had to get there to kill it before someone else does is hard to replicate. As expansions continued on, it continued to be a blast. I guild hopped and had Ultima hiatuses throughout when an expansion was on farm status and we were waiting around for another. I'm still playing now, though I might swap over to the new TLP Corniav server, because honestly the leveling and journey was the absolute best part of this.
---
I've discussed my concerns [here](https://redd.it/c8h2vr). Basically, we don't know about Phase 1 itemization. A ton of loot could be missing from Molten Core and Onyxia.
---
Only if the healer shammy is in the same grp, which doesnt seems to be the case in this cartoon...
---
True I suppose.
---
What if I told you that an RPG cannot be difficulty *by design?*
---
Sword and Mace skill are useless when you're using Nightfall
---
Eight classes, eight characters, two races of each. How they look matters but I guess more importantly how they’ll perform pvp wise. I’m pretty locked on the alliance side (I think) but it’s a bit more difficult for the horde side because each race has such good traits, I’m almost at a loss with which combinations to go with
---
**Horde:**
---
Warrior - tauren
---
Shaman - orc
---
Rogue - orc
---
Warlock - undead
---
Mage - undead
---
Priest - troll
---
Druid - tauren
---
Hunter - troll
---
&gt; I don't think there was one thing that was easier in EQ 
---
Boss mechanics
---
I liked that you guys had personalities and goofy emotes and mannerisms. Made for a very real experience. I was never the RP type but you did feel like you were just being helped by some very friendly supernatural force within the world.
---
Really hoping classic has the same vibe!
---
I don't think that's right, I watched a lot of Preach's tanking Streams, he was using Battle Shout a lot, never used taunt and had a mostly smooth time.
---
&gt; I believe the same logic applies to layering
---
&gt; it doesn't introduce tech that wasn't there in the first place.
---
Not at all. The game is still playable with spawn rates being adjusted. Private servers launch with 10k+ populations and people are still able to play. Frankly I'm sick of hearing that excuse because it's a poor excuse. If people have to fight over mobs for a week it's the much simpler solution than introducing servers on a tech not even from the time the game existed to solve problems that had already been solved. Blizzard views this as  a side project to try and lure people into playing/buying BFA. Already they have shown their cards by not wanting to have a lot of servers considering they are making all of EU share.
---
I thought they changed it so you could buy gear from your highest rank earned.  Your current rank doesn't matter.
---
The full run is called DM, but I only uploaded the final boss fight so it's technically just VC.
---
Has this been tested by anyone on the beta? As in is this working as intended on the beta rn
---
Well Classic is all about the open world and pvp challenges it brings comapred to any of the expansions that came out, due to the FLYING. Really if you play on a PVE/RP server you are missing out on a big fraction of the game when it comes to classic. Open world PVP makes for such an entertaining leveling experience.
---
We won't see if any DM changes come through until after Phase 2 is launched. At the moment though, /camp-ing is just a faster version of getting partied and dropping party, which teleports you to your hearth (which you can set close to the instance). It's relatively close in time depending on the dungeon.
---
They could. We were a Tauren only guild and our guild leader had a wolf. We all helped farming resources he could turn in when the AQ opening events started.

idk about very rare.
---
the main winner in this i think is hunters being able to fudge that dead zone. I feel like rogue dont get the same benefit as the classes they'd be kiting would be getting the same buff. The biggest loser? hmm more of light nerf to casters. spriest warlock are still going to do work mage kiting should still be effective with nova, blink, but maybe hunters lose the most have a larger vulnerable hitbox and typically leaning heavily on active kiting for pvp. As someone whos never played hunter I cant really attest to wether its a net gain or loss.
---
&gt; They don't want a lot of servers because only a fool thinks this game will appeal to very many people.
---
That's why it was #1 on Twitch when the beta launched right? 8.2 didn't even get that much attention on the platform. There have also been over 100 million accounts made since WoW launched, if they get even 2% of that it will be more popular than current WoW. You're a fool if you think this will just be a fotm event. 
---
As for tourists even just having servers cap at 12.5-15k is enough to combat that without layering. Remember a Vanilla server was full and put to the queue at only 2500 players. Layering isn't going to solve that unless literally 4/5 of a server drops off before the end of phase 1. 
---
&gt; Making the game as healthy as possible without ruining it is an intelligent move for the entire community
---
You say this then say we should have layering. Fool confirmed. Private servers are not the same for end game considering a newew phresher server is released every month and that community abandons ship to do it all over again because the old server probably had a scandal about the GMs selling gold. Blizzard servers are staying and won't be constantly refreshed by a new set of corrupt GMs to sell gold on the side. That argument doesn't even compare.
---
&gt; there are tons of things that have improved over the years that will make classic a better game without fundamentally changing anything about how you experience the gameplay or content itself.
---
Oh you mean like how sharding has totally been a god send and a blessing for current wow? There's a reason people want to go back to Classic and it's because of all the bs that's been added ever since that has driven the soul and community out of the current version.
---
Yes, I do not want an Expansion. I want level cap at 60 &amp; T3 Nax Gears as best gears.
---
In 2007? they introduced Expansion so fast people didnt even get full T3 yet. And for slow progression players spending years to get full T3, we want years to benefit from those gears, not be immediately watered down by level 61 gears...
---
Many people are coming back only to be in Patch 1. Those who want continued progression &amp; moving forward should transfer their characters from Classic to Live when they are bored.
---
/roll
---
You can use gear you've purchased at any rank, but you can only purchase the items at your current rank.
---
What exactly is the exploit? I've never hear of it. Is it just "having a lot of buffs"?
---
You would have to be a trogg to NOT want changes to Classic. If nothing else because the beta is already *full of changes*.
---
&gt;That won't go over well.
---
What won't go over well? Explain to me how turning down or tuning down the leeway is going to "ruin Classic".
---
Programer's Isles was on another instance/continent so no impossible without hacks
---
How can you presume to tell a random guy you've never talked to before how long he'll be playing?
---
I am extremely confident the PVP item vendor will be present and stocked on the day that PVP ranking begins.
---
I had the set on my hunter. I cringe thinking about it.
---
At 60, I will give someone 60x lvl 55 water (on PS, I know 55 water won't be available in phase 1) and however much bread they want (usually 2-3 stacks suffice) for 1g
---
It's not even like portals where it costs you money, it's *just* time and Mana. 
---
Basically, if you tip me 1g ill make you however much water you want lol
---
Well who said it didn't exist? They have clearly said it was there as lag compensation. People had trash connection and computer back then. But now, 2019, that's not an issue and should therefore not be in the game since it rather fuck up things without lag.
---
Any *gameplay* changes in the beta are bugs. This would be a big gameplay change. When people say no changes, that's typically what they mean. Stuff like battle.net integration and whatever else don't matter, they don't change the gameplay.
---
Why does thunderfurry look black in the screenshot near the end with human female in middle?
---
Also, it would be interesting to see if mage tier 3 shoulders (frostfire from max) look how they should on beta (on live, after patch 4.0, the crystals that float on the shoulders have the wrong color. Since beta uses modern client I wonder if it still renders that  shoulder piece incorrectly). 
---
Also, the horde mage rank 13 shoulders had their look change on live (don’t know what patch) compared to vanilla. On live they don’t look nearly as bright orange as og classic did.
---
Kinda hard to tell due to the camera being zoomed out quite far but it does seem like you should be in range. Do you have talents in Hawk eye? It would be interesting to test with casters as well and see how they are affected.
---
Nah, the barrier is your sub fee.
---
Not really. Majordomo started giving loot in patch 1.4 (supposedly phase 2). The Mature Blue Dragon Sinew only dropped from Azuregos until patch 1.5 (supposedly phase 3) when it was added to the 3 elite blue dragonkin mob types in Winterspring.
---
The truest form of forum based PVP
---
Insults peoples IQ, claims everyone back than had shitty internet and FPS. Dude, we're talking 2004, not 1994. Many people had decent setups back then, but that's not even the point. Changing spell batching would definitely change the way PvP is played. Changing the timer would be a balance change. There's absolutely no reason to do so apart from the fact that people want the game to be "faster", something it's not supposed to be. Leeway is a ping counter, and pings haven't change that drastically during that time. Internet speeds did a lot, but many people had decent pings back than. Some people act as if WoW was released during the stone age...
---
People say it's because of laggy connections because they don't know what they're talking about. Shit, most of them can't even tell the difference between ping and bandwidth.
---
It was likely just a QoL change for melee classes to make the game feel smoother.
---
There's a youtube interview with bliz dev about mounts. They said no cross race mounts will be allowed as that was only there in 2006 as an introduction to TBC Expansion. I can look up the vids if lots of you want, but rather not.
---
Not really understanding the rationale here. I'm getting heavily downvoted for saying that literally cheating and hacking in an online game is bad? That makes zero sense to me.
---
Gahz'ranka drops Nat Pagle's Broken Reel. +10%Spell Hit
---
It was popular on twitch because the popular streamers went to play it. Not sure what about that indicates the game itself will have a massive recurring playerbase. 
---
&gt;Oh you mean like how sharding
---
Why even bring this up? Sharding exists all the way to level cap and exists forever. I don't know how many times I have to repeat the fact that layering will exist for a few weeks.
---
That still doesn't answer the question how removing leeway will ruin Classic.
---
All I I'm saying is there are a lot of fights that don't have massive AOE damage to the raid, where you want to heal mostly the tanks. Look at fights like Chromag-you are dispelling all sorts of stuff and healing the tank - mana efficiency is huge for dispelling. Or a fight like magmadar/ragnaros where the targets may be too spread out to efficiently chainheal. There are a LOT of fights where chainheal is awesome, but its not the only thing you'll be doing.

Persistent area spells like frost trap used to check if enemies were in range every 400ms and then apply the slow debuff on the next batch. 
---
I'm not sure how imp. blizzard used to work under the hood but if you analyze any footage from retail vanilla frame-by-frame you can see that the interval between the damage tick and its debuff application is consistently 800ms (2 spell batches)
---
If you have to make constant support threads about PVE servers, something isn't right
---
&gt; It was popular on twitch because the popular streamers went to play it. Not sure what about that indicates the game itself will have a massive recurring playerbase. 
---
Even if you want to think that it's only because of streamers you still ignore the vast pool of people the Classic launch appeals to and how little they actually have to retain to be more popular than current wow.
---
&gt; Why even bring this up?
---
Because it's the same tech that layering is. Are you simple? We don't need layering with high enough server pops since server can easily handle the load nowadays. Why even introduce it when it's not needed? Unless of course Blizzard doesn't have servers capable of competing with private server populations, or they just don't think it will be a big deal. Like they still believe the "you think you do but you don't line" despite being shown time and time again how wrong they were.

Its very viable for dungeons, you just have more downtime with drinking
---
Thanks for this thread, take my upvote!
---
MC loot is is a big mistery. As you mentioned lots of loot got addes in later patches. But also loot (T2) got removed from MC. I doubt they add T2 do the droptable as it was back then. But then there are not many items in the loottables in MC Phase 1.
---
&gt; Maybe they dont want hunters having a 10mile range and they have shortened it
---
lol so maybe they made a huge change to the game?

Some people like to experience the content, but don’t have the time to dedicate themselves to a guilds raid schedule. Usually guild run pugs only have certain things on reserve as well, and randoms are free to roll on everything else.
---
Retail PUGs are cancer. Because it's so fast and easy to get into group (group finder, teleport to dungeon) people just leave if they feel like that. It doesn't need to be real reason any mad excuse is enough and poof they are gone.
---
I am really looking forward to get into dungeons of Classic where leaving isn't something you can just do because "hey it takes 5 minutes to be in new group"
---

I.... Listen her--
---
I GUESS you're technically correct.....
---
I play 6hrs Monday to Friday and when the kids or mrs allow then 18hrs each day Saturday and Sunday, I have booked the first week off of work to play constantly, the guild I’m looking at said that my time wasn’t committed enough and would only accept me if I rolled fury.
---
Should I find a new guild? I have a feeling these guys will fall apart pretty quickly
---
And xer is the reason the cycle will continue

A little of both to be honest.

STV on a PvP server makes me roll a PvE server for classic 100%!
---
Where did you get the original 1.12 client?
---
Um sorry sweatie, we only make up terms that hurt our political enemies, not ones that would make us look bad
---
It *works*, ain't great. Having your tank's mana breaks be the limiting factor to clear speed gets annoying quickly.
---
oooo spicy code post.
---
NICE. I've never actually seen/looked at the original Source for WoW. Are there any comments or old functions in there of interest?
---
There was one with some pirates on it I believe that was pretty far out, but this one was unmarked. I remember having to use a soulstone on myself with a fast mount, extra speed + water walking. I had nothing to do really.
---
And that´s precisely why we have separate gear for gameplay and RP. After all, you aren´t IC while doing quests and raiding anyway, so why wear inferior RP set while doing so?
---
I love the 2.5 look.
---
And while T2 is pretty, it feels like too many paladins on live wall around in it. It ain't special or interesting with everyone trotting around in it.
---
Strath and scholo are actually fine with a paladin tank just due to all the undead. Lbrs and ubrs will be a uphill battle for sure.
---
Nah. I agree with minmaxers when it comes to meme builds like Ret/Prot Paladins or Moonkins, but the difference between all the different races of Rogues in PvE or PvP boils down to something like 1-3%.
---
You should switch you internet subscribtion to dial-up then, to get that truly authentic Vanilla experience.
---
Female dwarf with double braids... Now you're a windmill. You're welcome.
---
While we're on the subject, I would love to have them in 16:9 format so I don't have to zoom and scroll them on my computer.
---
Depends on situation.  Paladins are best single target healers.
---
Nefl racials are arguably the weakest ally side but shadowmeld gives some very creative pvp options. being able to stealth a warrior, hunter, priest can individually be really powerful. but as rogue benefit the least from shadowmeld, while rogues receive better benefits from sword spec and stoneform. That said roll NE if you think humans and dwarves are gross. I'll have a hum mage toon because I detest gnomes.
---
That's just a pure grind then, not any demonstration of skill.
---
Except no one has any idea what does this mean.
---
Also, war. War never changes.
---
Thanks!
---
That´s false. Sharding and CRZ is only turned on in new zones (Zandalar/Nazjatar/Kul Tiras), old world is not sharded.
---
You missed those legendarys. The hammer may be added phase 2 and TF maybe added phase 3 but how knows?
---
&gt; But yeah even then it doesn't solve any real problems just avoids the issue by giving something from the past prior to the issue coming to be.
---
Absolutely, I'll take up to WOTLK, then reset back again.
---
Everquest does this rather well, called Progression servers. Every year they usually come out with one, and sometimes they come up with some slightly different rulesets, generally around raid unlocks / expansion unlocks.
---
Depending on how classic wow goes, they might do the same thing if/when the timeline is advanced into further expansions. (Yes this is a classic+ discussion slightly, but just furthering the point here)
---
I don't think retail is inherently bad, it has its market, but there's a large vocal following for the way old mmo's are played, and are willing to return week after week, month after month to play in a world, with PLAYERS in it. That's why I played, that's why I return. I want to get lost in the world again, and hang out with people. Even random people, just hanging out having a laugh in a dungeon (even if it is BRD and takes 4 FREAKING HOURS TO CLEAR). 
---
2 months to go, I just need to remind myself, 2 months to go.
---
&gt; You'll hear "If you need to use taunt, you're doing it wrong" from youtubers a lot
---
Seriously ? If you're not using taunt as a means to generate threat in dungeons you're just doing it wrong....
---
(and yes, I know taunt on its own doesn't generate threat)
---
he licc my toe, he attac my foe, but he ain't Broken Tooth GTFO
---
I just want a Mr.T ad please
---
As a fellow PvE server veteran, here's my take on the server types in classic:
---
PvE: I like warcraft, mostly the story, but if given the opportunity I might kill that horde/alliance player over there.
---
PvP: I like warcraft, but what I really like is the danger of being out in the open. It's also important to me that I can prove who's the best player in a 1v1 situation.
---
RP: I love warcraft, I love the story, but what I really love is to live in this living breathing world.
---
RPPvP: I love warcraft, its story and world. This is as close as I'll ever be to living in Azeroth.
---
That's not how that works. The DR is based on the base duration.
---
You can keybind things to target party members 1-5. Raiding might be a bit tough, but 5-mans are doable.
---
As for macros, because we are dealing with the legion client (someone please correct me, I know we're working with a modern client), there should be a way to cast specific heals on party_member_X. (X is their group number)
---
As for being a druid, yes, druids use typically just healing touch rank 3-5 (and more but those are usually the most common)
---
To reduce the damage you take. Proper hamstring kiting will save you a lot lot more time than early rend, since you will eat way less
---
Auctions are auctions,,having a pact that x horde guild and y alliance guild controlls all tue devilsaurs and attacks everyone who is not in said x and y guild
---
Yeah I fully agree with you. This is one of the main reasons I hope they remove layering. It damages the community for the sake of making solo questing super fast and as convenient as possible.
---
I was just hoping that it would alter raiding Mets like druids viable for dps and tanking, and paladins for dps and hunters ds doesn't drop off dramatically but doesnt sound like it
---
you need thicc pc for classic wow sure
---
As you wrote as a reply on other posts: That’s what you say, but Blizzard didn’t ;)
---
&gt; Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan.
---
I'm not.
---
That may be so but in a world where people look sideways at the rogue who's falling behind the other rogues by 5-10% you can bet your dollar on enhancement shamans being persona non grata in a fair amount of guilds.
---
&gt; Bad is relative. A good hunter will out dps a bad mage every time.
---
Unfortunately only true up until the end of phase 1. Starts dropping off and keeps falling. Only relevant if your guild believes optimal=viable though.
---
Not saying you should have elemental shaman in your raid just saying that they can do decent dps on short fights. Especially early on like mc. Might eaven beat a laysy warlock or mage never going to top meters tho
---
[Ion did say it](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641)...
---
I think you're missing the point. Everyone misses this point: 95% of the playerbase will be casuals and guilds won't care about MIN MAXING until AQ/Naxx if then.
---
All i can remember is even in wotlk i played with shitty 150+ ping, i can't imagine what i had used in vanilla. And this crappy ping had given me a 'bad' habit of moving before my castbar completely finished the cast to maximize the number of spells i can cast in the same amount of time. Now with all these sub 20 pings i get everywhere i'm still having this old habit which only does make me interrupt half of my spells.  
---
I'd say it's impossible to figure out if leeway was or wasn't in the original client since we had so terrible connections worldwide.
---
Really? Can you link it?
---
Yeah because every time they tried to sail across they got attacked by tentacle monster and instead discovered underwater location, so they stayed there to get those sweet XP.
---
In context, WoW was very hand-holdy compared to its mmo predecessors. Of the MMOs I played, WoW was the least-grindy and, therefore, most casual.
---
There were parts of WoW designed as grinds (farming an epic mount) but even those were nothing compared to, say, GMing Resist Magic in UO T2A.
---
No surprise. They keep trying to apply bandages to layering without focusing on the actual solution: Remove layering.
---
This is what you get when you think a cooldown is enough to magically fix the game.
---
Forgot Rogues.
---
Ah okay, great work none the less. I'll definitely use some of these as I'm rolling druid again.
---
That's really cute.
---
A lot of us just enjoy the friendlier, more mature playerbase that speaks coherently.  Well, that and the lack of players named after Twitch memes and cow puns.
---
Yes, let's just keep applying more and more bandages to this shitty system instead of just removing it /s
---
Are you trolling? The link is right there in my last comment.
---
Like i said im not sure myself but keep living that negative life
---
Yeah I don't get this, when content creators are like "well I'm not sure" just PAUSE recording and look it up!!
---
The top of the top can reach 60 in 4-5 days /played, 8-9 days is more realistic, with a 9h/day average playtime you can get there in 24 real days.   
---
Just keep burnout in mind. To each their own but playing like this would make the game feel like a job and suck out all the fun for me.
---
min-max &gt; aesthetics &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; class fantasy but ima tryhard
---
this is going to sound odd but im in so deep often min-max and aesthetics are the same thing to me
---
Alas i think this is just life in general. Convenience ease and accessibility are stressed during development so people can play whenever they want. (see lfr) I think people are hanging out less nowadays because its so easy to do anything else from the comfort of your home.
---
It really is legitimately horrible lol.  
---
I'm amazed at how bad people are when it comes to MMOs nowadays.
---
NA pleb here
---
Well it's not actually the source code, it's decompiled code from the .exe file.  IDA (the program used here) creates that pseudocode tab by default when you decompile something.
---
They can't remove layering.  It's already a fix to the problem of early launch rush ruining beginning experience for all and then later the potential void left behind from the new players who didn't really know what vanilla was which would lead to dead servers in some circumstances.
---
They want populated servers after the rush dies down and to do this they layer several times per server and as the rush dies down they remove it and now there is a healthy server.
---
I get we're frustrated by the issues but the reasoning of why they need a tool like layering makes a lot of sense... I don't really get the argument of just have nothing and fuck launch experience and fuck the servers in a month.  Very shortsighted.  I'd rather have weird layering CD then that bullshit that will actually destroy the game.
---
You just don't get it. When you have 40 people raiding not everyone has to do the MAXIMUM amount of dps to win the encounter. Not even HALF the people have to do the maximum amount of damage. The issue is that people get caught up in numbers that don't matter. That's the simple fact. The numbers don't matter. 
---
If you get in a situation where you can't break the dps check and I'm in your raid as a shaman and you need more dps, sure. That's a very niche situation where I'll be totally okay with getting a better DPS. The sad truth that everyone refuses to recognize, those situations barely exist in vanilla.
---
People need to stop arguing for the sake of inflating their ego with numbers that don't matter.
---
This is the biggest reason why I think layering will be permanent. Blizzard is already planning for failure (see: limited EU servers) so they might be surprised if a lot of people stick around. If the population doesn't drop as much as they think, layering will absolutely become permanent, because Blizzard will have backed themselves into a corner they can't escape.
---
Druids had the best agi to dodge (15 agi per 1%) and agi to crit (20 agi per 1%) conversion rates.
---
The risk in EQ made the reward so much sweeter. Zones were mysterious and forbidding, because you didn't dare explore every little corner.  Certain classes were designated as "pullers", and if you weren't a puller, you basically only ever got to see the "camp" where you killed stuff for hours on end.  The world wanted to kill you, and it was up to you to find a team to kill the world. It was glorious.
---
&gt;Viable
---
This word always means different things to different people, but anti-meta specs like Boomkins and Ret paladins with 1.12 abilities and talents have always been "viable".
---
For example, Skarm (youtuber) has shown that bears can very competently tank nearly every boss in Naxx, including KT. 
---
Honestly the hardest part about running unpopular specs is clearing up people's misconceptions and convincing them that you deserve loot too.
---
I think you didn't understand why even layering is implimentent. It's for the QUE not for the quest. if you can't even log in for 6 hours i think you will understand why it's needed.
---
Oh I like this.  Downvote one comment then upvote the next and then... Oh fuck I'm going down.
---
I don't think comments actually get compiled with the source code.  And since this is just decompiled code, I doubt there would be any comments.
---
PETA
---
Indeed, been saying this from the start as well. But this reddit have boomed in pop from retail players who down vote you to oblivion for mentioning this.
---
That's not even relevant. Layering isn't a bug, it's by design. It's a terrible design and everyone knows that, but I'm tired of people thinking they can bandage it up to make it better. No, it needs to be completely removed.
---
No no be afraid. More tanking for me &gt;:)
---
Because the beta has a very limited number of people.  So to actually test layering the threshold is a lot lower.
---
They can't test the same numbers they'll use on launch in a closed beta.
---
This should honestly be a sticky during launch week
---
Nah they're good while leveling. Don't let poopy people make you mad. Show em how it is!
---
Yes, for the somewhat realistic no-lifer I'd say ~5 hours weekday, ~12 weekend would be a good goal, which would average out to 7hrs/day.     In reality most people playing 5+ hours average a day are either students or casual/part time (or less).
---

---
pve farm you kite &amp; kill with crit &amp; slows
---
pvp you do the same, and throw in a few sheeps if needed
---
pve raid its decent damage until BWL / AQ where mages go fire in order to hit higher dps
---
People obsess over 'cringe' or being 'cringey' now. Fucking hate it, do what you want to do and don't feel ashamed that you're enjoying yourself.
---
Well said, at the end of the day it’s a game and you should play what makes you happy.
---
This is what I’m considering doing. Wondering about the answer to this as well.
---
Head and legs were from onyxia and Ragnaros si some people had the old versions of t2 before Bwl released
---
I saw plenty of ferals as main tanks in naxx40. I think you really underestimate their power.
---
The problems that exist with layering are bugs because they allow unintended things to happen.
---
It does not need to be removed. Quit acting like a 5 year old that dropped his ice cream cone.
---
but you're OP
---
There are no dinner or raid maps in vanilla
---
Firstly, there are other solutions. I'm sick of people pretending like it's either "use layering" or "do literally nothing"
---
Secondly, even if tgat were the case, I' still *significantly* prefer they do nothing.
---
I'd rather wait for a good game than have an instant piece of shit.
---
Sacrificing community for convenience is what killed modern wow. It's insane how people are defending them repeating the same mistake in Classic.
---
Same back then.
---
I actually own a  private data center now and have dedicated fiber hooked up to my facility.
---
I partitoned a tiny percentage of the network for myself and checked my MS on blizzard official servers : 3 MS
---
I was floored.
---
&gt;I'd rather they'd have added 100 servers that eventually die and be forced to merge them over the shitty problems layering has created.
---
I wonder if people with your opinion actually went throught he time periods of servers dieing...  I would rather something that messes the game up the first month or two then something that irreversibly screws up the game for the foreseeable future.
---
It's much better to have a server grow organically with all the original players then to force servers that have already grown up to merge together.  Guild relations, alliance vs horde rivalries, the economy all get fucked so hard in a server merger.
---
This shit isn't great but I'd still prefer this.
---
You have to be frost for the first two raids. And there it will depend whether you're the [Winter's Chill bitch](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005--05353203102351051) or not. All but that one mage should be [this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300052310231531--053500030022).
---
Around AQ40, fire starts to outclass frost, but only if you have enough mages [specced for it](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005031-5052021123033151-003) (some mages don't take Pyro + Blastwave and instead go for 2/3 Arcane Meditation, totally up to you). This is because you'll need to work together to get the Imp. Scorch debuff stacked to 5 ASAP and keep it at 5 for the entire fight. Plus, you want to work together to keep a big Ignite rolling on the boss without the one person taking credit for it getting too high on threat.
---
Personally, I think a raid with ~5 fire mages is so much fun. It requires coordination and skill that just isn't part of being a frost mage. We used to be in two voice chats at once just to keep it all together. No other class requires that much teamwork.
---
Frost mages with a point in imp blizzard are nearly always welcome in a raid just because they trivialise nearly any aoe fight. Damage isn't great for a pvp specced mage but it is ok (certainly above meme specs), so should be fine as long as you aren't expecting or being expected to top the parsing logs.  
---
Frost mage with barrier and imp blizzard are extremely good dps for 5 mans too. Not the highest dps but so good for control and very survivable with barrier + iceblock.
---
Never knew venom hide raptor was added in wrath, kinda bullshit lol
---
Because Dragon Age?
---
that is all
---
Seal twisting is a pvp techinque to get a simultanous SoC and SoJ proc, it's useless in pve.
---
For PVE, on the discord, we are currently trying seal weaving, alternating between Sotc and SoC, but so far, there have only been preliminary tests, no clue how good it actually is.
---
*Big* dps boost? How much are we talking here? Do you have any clue what you're talking about?
---
Last panel made me sad.
---
Don't seem like a tauren hand
---
People generally play RPGs to make powerful characters. Sure not everyone, but that's a very common reason why people play. It's true in Diablo 2, and LoL, and Baldur's Gate, and DoS, and it's very true in WoW. In addition, for many people what they enjoy about WoW is the raiding, and specifically while raiding being a valued and useful part of the team. A big part of that is where they are on the damage or healing meters.  
---
So yes, you're technically correct that you might need only 400 dps or whatever on patchwerk to not wipe as a raid. You technically can succeed in vanilla with low dps. But by and large people don't enjoy being carried, they like contributing, and they like creating and playing a powerful character. So I don't think the fact it isn't strictly necessary won't really come as a surprise or change priorities for the vast majority of players.
---
To be fair, this sub seems to think world PvP was a big part of Vanilla.  People seem to forget that all the "WoW-killers" main selling point was that world PvP was going to be a big thing. 
---
Not saying world PvP didn't happen. It did, but not to the extent most people are making it out to be.
---
That's entirely besides the point in his very common scenario.
---
I mean this would work if you have a group that wants to do this as well. It is a lot of world traversing though, so it wouldn't be super efficient.
---
I would recommend against dungeon leveling. It's not as effective as blizzard made dungeon leveling later on.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8avbb/investigations_vanilla_tier2_graphics_changed_in/
---
And here is why I would never want to play hunter on classic. I'm fine with the wotlk system, but I'm way too lazy to feed him everytime.
---
How many servers do you want them to setup? Pvp, pve, rp x 5-10 different languages?

You still need to min max to compete in raids lol. Min mazing will give you more dps. If your best at it you win the competition....
---
True for most encounters. But there were exceptions. Pre nerf C'thun e.g. If your dps could not handle him in two phases you hat a bad time. He wasn't a guild breaker for noch reason. 
---
Though i think that mf will be released nerfed.
---
I wouldn't say horrendously toxic, but what you need to realise is that there is a wide range of players here from hardcore min-max raiders to noobs who just want to be part of the hype. I think the majority of people saying play what you want to new players is spurred on from the meta that this sub can push people towards. Hearing someone who has never played the game before asking about BiS for end game content seems a little silly as many people won't be raiding every day at 60 like the hardcore majority.
---
In the end isn't everyone going to play how they want to? I don't think anyone can control them from reddit
---
I just really doubt the MF approach... MF may be good on paper, but it requires PWS which is horribly mana inefficient. So I would not use it until you have to when you get shadowform with 45. Smite is just better.
---
If the old resist tables are correct the dps loss is around 17.5% due to nature resists. Considering mage/lock is literally one button you are talking about some serious knuckledraggers. Shaman are amazing raid healers if fights don’t require spreading (cthun).
---
I wrote it wrong: will leveling arms but still tank dungeons and respec at 60
---
On one hand, you can force basically any race/class to work. If you really wanted to play a ret paladin in PVE, or wanted to try a 0-0-0 talent spec, you could do it. Have fun, knock yourself out!  
---
On the other hand, people need to understand that vanilla doesn't have the class balance of later versions of WoW. When you decide to roll a moonkin, you should be fully aware of what that means. When you're an alliance priest and you're not playing a dwarf, you've traded powerful abilities for visual aesthetics.   
---
It's not toxicity -- it's about different players with different play-styles and expectations.
---
It's just the demographics of WoW. Hardcore min/maxers are a super minority. They're still correct, but only in their own world where every boost to any number matters most.
---
An overwhelming majority of players won't be level 60 before BWL releases, won't ever clear AQ40, and won't ever step foot in Naxx. It's just not a priority for them, so naturally they don't care about getting every number to it's maximum level when it means picking a race or class or spec that doesn't suit their preference.
---
Both parties are in the right, but since it's more common for non-hardcore players to ask questions in this sub, usually the min/maxers telling them what race/spec/class is best get downvoted because their answers only matter in the world where that person asking questions probably doesn't belong.
---
Thanks for reacting. Does your version happen to be in Dutch?
---
I used speedhack too even in wotlk. I was a burnt out wow player who hated the game, but the addiction kept me going and only logged in to do arenas and only the necessary stuff to do arenas. So i tried to reduce these necessary stuff as much as i could. Was really easy stuff to use. I had a sidebar where i could reverse gravity, increase speed, allow wall clipping, set coordinates to teleport somewhere. The main use was simply traveling on a very fast speed. Couldn't use max speed coz that disconnected for some reason, but it took like 10 seconds to travel from Booty to WPL. Simply turned on clipping, went underneath the ground and came up above very close to where i wanted to go in some remote location so noone can see me. Had like at least 5 friends using the same stuff, none of us got banned. I guess your speedhack just sucked.
---
Yeah, but it's weird. Presumably this small business owner who specializes in magical staves had to go to some master woodworker to get a sign for his store made. And he chose a fucking sword. You know good and well he has drunken dwarves in platemail stumbling in all the time asking for a Bastard sword because of this. Imagine a drunken dwarf asking where you keep your Zweihanders and you having to explain, again, that you sell staves and maybe a few refurbished wands. Just imagine that.
---
Right now the Blizzard responses we do have suggest that the PVP vendor will not have all their available loot in Phase 2 and Molten Core will not have all it's available loot at launch.
---
I think it would be a mistake to exclude the PVP rewards until Phase 6, but we just don't have a response that suggests Blizzard has taken this into consideration. Likewise with 1.3 and 1.4 Molten Core loot.
---
Vanilla is the time where tanking has the highest skill ceiling, start out by cc'ing every mob and putting the skull on the mob you tank. Get used to the amount of threat you need to generate before a mob dies.  
---
Then split it up, try to tank 2 mobs, always keep the skull up so dps'ers who aggro the non skulled mob doesn't have an excuse to whine when they die.  
---
When tanking multiple mobs, get used to to the taunt combo:  
---
put skull on high health mob, tap it once for sunder, then stun it. While dps overaggros and bursts it, you build threat on other targets, keeping rage for a single sunder.  
---
Once stun is about to drop, you taunt the mob and negate all the threat the dps'ers did, and tap it again with sunder to get ahead.   
---
Tanking in vanilla has so many levels you can play and improve at. All the finesse of tanking died once they introduced 200% threat in tank stances, and buffed aoe damage and threat of skills like thunderclap. Threat hasn't been a mechanic in the game since \~wotlk
---
True, and a 4-hour raid is pretty dull when you don't get any loot for the 2nd week in a row...
---
Blizzard does not add the Winter's Chill debuff to any target caught in it, even if you're specced for Imp. Blizzard.
---
All you need is good stam and a freaking taunt.
---
correct but also false, keep in mind classic runs on 7.1.5 and is then downgraded and that is why i ask this question to the players on classic.

It's pretty barren in most builds in terms of info besides sometimes some asserts and the lua binding strings. There have been a few builds throughout the years where some debug symbols etc were left or names were not mangled, but none from vanilla afaik. There's an alpha build with partial pdb/symbols, but from what I understand it's different enough in code from the release builds to not be super relevant, though I've never actually looked into it myself.
---
Back then yes for sure. With “modern” exploration xp they would probably be level 10 when they came out the gates of stormwind after taking the tram lol.
---
most bosses didn't have enrage timers though - two have soft berserks and one has a hard frenzy - there are some soft frenzy as well but those can be tranqed
---
Back in the day i was begging my guild to be druid cat dps for a single zul'gurub 20man raid (we had it on farm). 
---
\- They were like "no you'll be shit". 
---
\- "one raid gddmt and i'll shut up and go back to healing".
---
ofc i eventually got to try it, and ended up #3 on DPS meters 
---
and they were like "yeah ofc you tryhard that run while rogues were slacking"
---
And that's really the key argument here. Always pick players that care and constantly perform over players that slack through everything.
---
It’s been the exact same way for months. I think people just like to be victims or pretend they’re victims.
---
Okay, stawp dots
---
I made one battlenet friend on the stress test.  more friends than i've made in six months of wow.
---
lol this is why I dont Hunter I forget that shit 😂
---
Yes there is.
---
Competing with your guild mates numbnuts
---
I visited there once on a ptr during vanilla
---
Not sure how it worked.. was convinced to enter a duel with a priest on the zeppelin tower outside org and they mind controlled me off the tower.
---
I thought they were trolling me until I somehow ended up on gm island. Still not sure how that worked..
---
Managing Fear means the Warlock is doing 0 damage. A Mage only takes 1 global to Polymorph, another global to Frost Nova, and if they're Frost, they automatically slow their primary + AoE targets. Warlocks are really good overall in TBC, but they're strictly inferior to a Mage when it comes to heroics.
---
4. Make sure to use multishot as soon as you see the warrior pull
---
&gt; PVP was fun back when the game was new and everyone sucked. The skill gap was small 
---
The game still had it's fair share of high level players camping/griefing low levels, which had nothing to do with skill gap.
---
Yeah, I agree. Blizzard was (is?) very good at taking a gaming genre and streamline it to suit a larger player base. Games for "normal people" (not necessarily *only* for casuals, but gameplay that suits *both* serious gamers and casuals). I use the term normal people lacking a better term, I hope you understand what I mean.
---
* WarCraft 2 was one of the first RTS games for normal people
---
* Diablo was the first(?) roguelike for normal people
---
* WoW was the first MMO for normal people
---
(I guess Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch are built on similar principles, but I don't play those games/genres, so can't really say for sure)
---
In my opinion, the ability to streamline and make genres accessible to a larger player base is one of Blizzards key success factors. However, I also feel that streamlining can be taken too far, and that has led to the state of current WoW.
---
Looking for a EU ( GER/ENG) - Horde - PVP Server - Guild that raids on weekdays at 11pm or Fr (7pm), Sa, Sun.
---
I'm planning to play a hunter or warlock and get to 60 in the first month. Age 24
---
Kk keep drinking the koolaid and trust Blizzard when they IMPLY it will be gone after two weeks. We'll see what happens.
---
That's some shit tier math then. Do you know what gross means?
---
Other races certainly can MT but if one player had to be a min maxer in your guild it should be the MT.
---
They're whining because they need fodder to abuse. If a PvP server is full, it's much easier to find people to gank.
---
Thinking about switching over to warlock now...
---
I always disliked how some icons were so cool compared to the looks. I still remember in dun morogh I saw the icon of a cloak which looks like a bit shoulder wide mantle and I was so pumped.. I was so dissapointed lol
---
Private meets pet collectors.
---
Elitists are either players with a lot of wisdom and experience, or players who think they are good but just follow the things that pros say, and both might just be stubborn.  Gotta first decipher if this guy knows wsup or is a gatekeeper.  Also, this games been played by the private server community for more than 5+ years.  Opinions are cemented.  There is little room for debate.  Just hear their words, dont listen to it if you dont want to, know that theres a guild for everyone, and you wil find happiness by playing however you want.  But there is optimal and viable, and you have to decide what matters to YOU personally.
---
Probably because you should have stopped "the grind", and started working on your pre-raid bis at 54-55.
---
I didn’t mean to make a low effort post regarding leeway. This community is pretty much damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I only wanted to get blizz to pay attention to this mechanic. If it’s working as intended, dope. If not, I’m rolling Tauren warrior lol.
---
Hi planning to play a hunter or warlock and get to 60 in the first month. age 24, I'm dad.
---
You're not a real man unless you're RPing a woman on RP servers
---
I want to play a shadow priest that does good damage and doesnt go oom quickly.
---
Just because I want to doesnt make it possible. (just an example, I know there are sp in raids)
---
Its not toxic if you are telling the truth.
---
You may have saved a newbie months of leveling a class that isnt really viable in something.
---
Imagine a guy after months finally getting to 60 and then getting laughed at for applying for raids as a paladin tank just because they told him "play what you want, everything works"
---
C’thun was unkillable until he was nerfed. 
---
After he was nerfed he promptly fell to most raiding guilds. Cthun was defiantly not a guild killer.
---
Yeah but who wants to go there
---
The amazing irony is he doesn't understand y he would massively struggle to ever get r 14 even if he did just "grind"
---
Rofl it’s not Vanilla, they die. Do that in Bota, Arc, SH, Underbog or Steamvault and they get one shot.
---
You keep smoking that kush bro, 18 months lmao
---
Multiboxing is alot harder than just playing one character.
---
You'd realise the issue isn't people that can't speak English. It's English speakers that don't want to find themselves on a French server. It has nothing to do with "Just speak English" it's bigger than what one person can do.

Good luck getting the AQ Mount.
---
There are some zones, like swamp of sorrows, that will be absolutely trash if you don't bring in some outside quest lines.  
---
If you want to be efficient, use a guide.
---
I was thinking about this too, until they announced that there won’t be language based servers in Europe, I went from spending an hour or two ok this sub to just 10 minutes per day and I m not sure anymore that I will play
---
What happens when a random server DOESN'T lose 80% it's player base by phase 2? They just get merged into a 15k active population server? Good luck getting consumes in a world designed for 2.5k
---
God damn fucking auto correct.
---
The population shows how it is currently with online players, as such all realms should be shown as "Low" since nobody is logged in. They could obviously change this, but this is how it used to be atleast. My server always went to Medium late at night.
---
Omg I love it!!
---
18 months for farming MC and Ony is too much my friend.
---
Every Horde guild wanting to get to AQ20 or AQ40 as quickly as possible.
---
Every Alliance guild wanting to get to Azuregos as quickly as possible.
---
They would also be useful for leveling (since you don't get the self-teleport for either location until level 30).
---
This is a very important point - unless the utility of "sub-par" specs (on the meters) is readily apparent, people playing the "good" specs will perceive the guild's inclusion of "sub-par" specs in raids as a waste of their time (not to mention the consequences of handing a big ticket item to a "support" class before all the "primary damage" classes).
---
The return is coming!
---
Locks and Hunters have higher sustained DPS against raid bosses (at least in early gear when heroics would actually give upgrades) but not higher burst damage, which is what you need when trash packs die quickly. I'll give you that Mages are extremely good in heroics and they're never a bad choice, but stacking melee for buff synergy is not an issue with a Shaman healer.
---
Going Lock so, no worries here
---
Uhm. I’m pretty sure the best ones develop in the military, in college or in a football squad.
---
Yeah but nobody wants to carry a oomkin and have him roll on precious caster gear.
---
GL with your fury and 1 Button. 
---
U know how to stancedance?
---
O.G. WoW life is hard.  How'd have thunk'.
---
Just get those hit ratings &amp; you're fine
---
Funnily enough I will be playing a Holy Priest because I genuinely enjoy healing in vanilla WoW with all its downranking shenanigans (I dropped healing in WotLK when they removed downranking being a thing by normalizing mana costs across all ranks), so I definitely will be getting back to healing. : D
---
I think every serious gamer has played pre cata wow atleast once in their lives and the majority of them will be back
---
I was just think of starting a similar discussion. I am of the bullsih group that think playerbase will not only at launch but once the dust settles will be comparable if not larger than retail(yes those numbers can only be speculated). It is a wonder that Blizz hasn't advertised classic seemingly at all however I cant browse FB this forum without getting nauscous from every BFA add thrown in my face.  perhaps Blizz execs don't take classic seriously as a potential revenue asset, or perhaps its an intentional test to see how strong the support in the community is for this type of product. Financially I imagine Execs have a pretty bold line between success and failure and because of uncertainty on where classic will fall they simply want to minimize investment and potential sentiment backlash(investors) if it does fail, where as if it is a "surprise" success its a huge win for them.
---
There are going to be tons and tons of human rogues that are hit capped and wearing bis fear that suck at keeping alive and dice up, don’t ask if they should be using rupture, stand in the wrong place, etc. I know the amount or ret pallies and cat druids and enhance shaman etc that do as well as they can will be small, I think everyone deserves a shot if their build and gear is decent even if the spec isn’t ideal.
---
The guy in that twitter thread saying the R14 weapons are so OP they are gonna have to force everyone in their guild to grind R14 even alts has gotta be trolling or delusional!
---
Nice thank you for this excellent conclusion.
---
Your post still checks out. A windfury shaman is in the melee group, if he has to support the healers he might be transfered mid-fight to the other group, to drop the mana totem. In that case, the windfury totem won't refresh the buff on the melee group untill the shaman is back in their group.
---
My first Wailing Caverns run, the tank asks me to polymorph something.  I never bought the skill because I couldn't understand why I would want to turn something into a sheep.
---
I hope he dropped some void walker gear?
---
1) I wouldn't be in shadowform during the premade, or use mind flay or vampiric embrace. 
---
2) By spell damage I mean I wouldn't equip any +shadow damage gear. My primary job would not be healing, my primary job is dispelling targets.
---
I think Night Elf is the best race for PvP. The extra stealth level is noticeable and will help you land openers. 
---
If you do roll Night Elf, then I recommend using daggers instead of swords. Human Rogues won't want daggers or certain pieces of gear (like the gloves from MC). You will personally do less damage than an equally geared Human Rogue using swords but you will soak up gear that is useless for them. The raid as a whole will progress more quickly because of the better gear distribution.
---
Holy shit a genuine 30yo boomer!
---
They’re like children, having to make lists for themselves so they have something to do while waiting for the game to release.
---
Iirc, this was for spells in Vanilla to help a cast land if someone ran outside of range the moment before a cast finished. This was a huge problem for casters in Vanilla so they added a small grace period to the cast range if a target got out of range while the target was casting.
---
They were added in 1.6 but they didn't retro upgrade the pieces people had gotten from pre 1.6 until 1.9. people had mixmatched sets for a while, the world first nef all looked like the old set cuz they have gotten new pieces yet.
---
That's such a vanilla story I love it!!
---
fuck man, planning on playing a hunter but i dunno if i can handle the guilt if they ever slip into yellow
---
Thanks a lot, very informative reply.
---
If blizzard intend to keep the release schedule anything like the original schedule, then phase one will last for about 4 months (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x). (link shows dates for patches). Since Wow was released on november 7 2004 and dire maul, kazzak, azurefos (phase 2) was released on march 7 2005. Another handy link (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x) To top this off, Ion Hazzikostas has even stated in an interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZH3UAwUZo)(10:30 ish) That they expect the phase1 to phase 2 progressing to be "one of the faster progressions". Which lead us to believe that that wont go slower then the original progression, which was 4 months.
---
In this interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=jYuUD0o-Nz8) Ion promises that "a few weeks in" layering will be removed. In said interview Ion also said that as players spread out they have no problem reducing the amount of layers, meaning they are ok with a layer density higher then 3k. So if the dropoff of players is lower then expected, the servers can handle it, and i guess blizzard is fine with having more players crammed into its servers for profit. Noone would probably be happier about high realm numbers 4 months in then blizzard. 
---
tldr: Your first argument is plainly false. And the second is based on that any server is expected to only host 3k players at all times of the progression, which isnt what blizzard has told us. 
---
conclution: blizzard knows what they are doing, Ion was a high end Guild master way back when, and has knowledge about classic and its resourses. Peace.
---
I holy paladin-ed back in the day. It was pretty fun yeah. It helped that I had a warlock too.
---
I quit in Cata, but I had a priest then and I really liked healing with smite lol... I just didn't like most other things much.
---
10% hit is is very useful whenever you're fighting a mob that is 3+ levels above you. That shouldn't be the case in general of course, but there are plenty of quests where it will be needed.
---
I ended up with a week off starting the second day of Classic, but that's just a normal long weekend. I had to bid vacation LAST summer, so Classic hadn't even been announced yet. I won't get any extra free time outside my normal weekends, which tend to fall on week days. Since I work nights, I'll be playing from 9PM-9AM instead and won't have as much server overload to deal with. Here's hoping for the best.
---
I think they will make it so that the vendor will work form your highest achieved rank like it does in retail now. So you won't need to do it twice , will classic feature achievements ?
---
Didn't know the German client used english names for cities back then
---
Agree with this. Furor is great if you have the mana to support it. Which you really don't while leveling.
---
Rogue? Absolute garbage? What. Theyre the class that dominates 1v1 and wpvp throughout 1-59. Leveling isnt hunter or warlock tier but it sure isnt garbage
---
This is a bad and exploitable implementation. If wow had something similar it would be exploited on day 0.
---
It's not part of Reddit, it's part of your OS.
---
It was kind of mixed back then, Blizz translated everything in a later patch.
---
Found the JS/PHP dev.
---
Lol
---
I misunderstood what you wrote, cheers for clearing it up.
---
At the start of Classic, there will be a lot of Retail players who wants to test it too, and who are not necessarily at ease with (or wants) social interactions (unlike Retail and the pure solo dimension). I hope this will not jam the social experience during the early months.
---
BTW, I'm really looking forward to quest, meet, help and interact with strangers again. I'm a little afraid of the servers being "only English" and that may divides the community inside a same server into dedicated channels.
---
I hope that a majority of English speakers will be lenient towards the minorities who wish to interact with them despite the barrier language :-) The social bond can only be  strengthened .
---
Sorry for my english, it's not my main language.
---
My casual and yours are likely very different, but agreed, it was a long time ago and timescales may be different to those stated.
---
There is nothing more dangerous than bored healers. Keep them on their toes I say!
---
Speaking as an experienced tank: 99% of healer overaggro is due to healers pre-casting a heal on pull... which they NEVER should be doing!
---
Yeah to clarify paying to win pvp battles with little to no skill. You press one button to blow even the most skilled player up, while they would have to she'll out ~$60/month to be able to do that to you.
---
That’s awesome haha. 🤣
---
Usually the first thing to go with sleep deprivation is memory. Besides, it's much easier to put useful tidbits in a spreadsheet than it is to memorize them all. Without constant use or practice, you simply won't retain the tiny details.
---
They could give a warning. "Swap &lt;name&gt; in 6." There you go, shaman can drop WF so will probably fit.
---
\#nochanges also means people being able to play on localized servers, like they did back in the day.   
---
Having the game client translated to swedish, and only having servers where the majority of players speak swedish, would be a pretty big change for Eng/NA players aswell, this is what players from localized servers experience with this change.
---
Hey, could you redo the test with your modified client while kiting a mob at range, to see if the skill icons are white at 20 yards then also? That would verify whether there really is a check for if both parties are players, or if it appears to work in PvE also.
---
Yes people have a bad memory.
---
They cant even remember from 15 years ago that they should at lvl 45 put a point into mindflay while getting the Cairnstone Sliver from the Quest The Morrow Stone in Feralas while grinding the Southsea Pirates in the Lost Rigger Cove in Tanaris.
---
Eh with 1.12 talents and itemization + peoples raids being better geared on average due to starting to raid earlier in the servers life cycle I'm sure they'll be more than fine unless they have like 20 ret paladins.  
---
I say this as someone who min maxs and tends toward min max guilds.
---
I subbed for the last one. Retail is so foreign to me. I'm kinda leveling my characters to burn off rest XP. So much has changed. Some of the new mechanics are interesting
---
Were missing too much information and context without the full code, decompiled code is already too hard to read imo and my C++ knowledge is rather limited anyway.
---
But the checks on lines 97 &amp; 98 are not "if caster &amp; target are running" but instead "if caster &amp; target are NOT walking", that little "!" is a big difference. "is not walking" should logically also return true if the players are standing still (or perhaps only then), and thus would have nothing to do with the players movement speed or slow effects. This whole code could just have to do with your casts not getting interrupted or failing if you were casting from max range and the target keeps slightly moving around, slightly out of your max range before your cast went off.
---
I am still baffled at the fact that people think it works. Shows how tech illiterate people are.
---
I disagree, T2 is way better. It looks cool tho
---
Except they only start getting better from level 30+. And maybe even later in the game. The first 20 to 30 levels are a pain.
---
Minmaxing your leveling, it is.
---
How on earth did you come up with this as a response out of all things?!
---
Well said!
---
If that behavior was implemented you'd expect to see pushes of white "in range" indicating buttons resulting in out of range responses.
---
Just wait, if it isn't too late. They've changed everything so much that it's barely the same game beyond the names of places. Professions are so overhauled that they're unrecognizable and anything that's less than current content is utterly ignored and not necessary to progress current xpac crafting. It's a fun game, don't get me wrong, but it's not World of Warcraft anymore.
---
Do you understand that removing leeway and doing nothing else is a massive nerf to melee? They'd need to balance it out by increasing the real range of melee attacks a bit if they get rid of leeway.
---
Didn't see this thread, thanks ! 
---
Anyways, i learned that it existed reading patchnotes iirc, so pretty easy to find that it did exist
---
Ah gotcha.
---
Should be quick to check. Could you redo the test with your modified client while kiting a mob at range, to see if the skill icons are white at 20 yards then also? That would verify whether there really is a check for if both parties are players, or if it appears to work in PvE also.
---
I make checklists for pretty much everything.
---
We all tend to remember stuff just fine, until that moment when we don't.
---
I mean if you're gonna rely on Mage's slow and the positioning requirements of frost nova to prevent ranged targets from ignoring the 'cc' then by all means you do you, warlocks are more suited to more traditional approaches to tanking and CCing.
---
Fury in the early patches was dogshit because the talet tree was fucked up. This changed in- and around BWL patch (I dont recall exactly which one). By AQ40 release the tree was pretty close to the one currently in 1.12.1
---
Yes, of course sub-optimal specs have a right to exist, but they need to find an environment that is accepting of their choice. For reasons I mentioned above, they can't expect every guild to be jolly about it though.
---
I'm not sure that bringing up that "bad rogue-player" example is of any use really because a.) He will still do better than an average meme-spec player and b.) he might learn and become a good player while the feral druid will not respec (assuming the latter, because it would kill the whole argument)
---
He tried to say that he doesnt have sense of range.
---
They will all put any internet user in China on a government list.
---
Leveling only really teaches you a certain style of play which is geared toward a solo playstyle. Max level requires a totally different approach when it comes to group play and that is where a lot of people fall short in.
---
Healers for instance may never heal a dungeon until max level. It's basically an aspect of the game and their class that is completely foreign to them even though they are level 60. 
---
So yeah, being Lvl60 means something but it generally doesn't mean a whole lot.
---
Well, as people talk vanilla more and more, with realization what the game really was, people now see that they don't have to always fit in the cookie cutters. It is better but not needed for vanilla.   
---
The more information and talks have made it so, because before, people thought vanilla was hard and top raiding was only for the best of the best.  
---
These "haters" were norm back then, now with people more educated (and with vanilla being mostly about having fun and not going hardcore) it is exact the opposite for the better.
---
I was oversimplifying there are tons of mechanics which punish you for bad dps.
---
MC:
---
Lucifron: oom from curse of impending doom 
---
Garr after 4 guards are down gets really nasty and needs to die fast.
---
Golemagg DoTs at &lt;10%, ragnaros's submerge timers, 
---
BWL: 
---
Vael is a hard DPS check
---
Chromaggus will utterly ruin you on several curse combos without high dps
---
Nefarian I don't think I need to say much about
---
ZG: 
---
Spider boss: the adds will grow out of control and wipe you since they grow
---
Bloodlord will eventually start getting people and ding
---
Arlok will spawn panthers galore on you. They don't stop spawning. 
---
Tiger boss full enrages
---
Jindo will wear you down and overwhelm you eventually
---
Edge of madness I remember absolutely none of
---
AQ is full of soft, but not really soft enrage mechanics  like Huhuran
---
i made another post here in this thread but you can check how leeway is implemented on pservs here:
---
basically relies on the client-side check for spell start, and then will allow "up-to" 5 yards of leeway before the action will be invalidated.
---
Wont alot of people already be lvl 60 by the time that happens though? so most peoples experiences would of already been ruined lol..
---
Or when he dies.
---
Protip: dont play a warrior if youre not going to tank, youre going to have a bad time and nobody will like you.
---
Questing isn't going to be fast either. 15-20 player trying to farm the same quest mob. Instanced dungeon spam sounds like a good backup plan.
---
Rest in peace, Verne
---
Huh? No it isn't
---
Oh I get it.. TRAINing
---
Search for [INSERT CLASSNAME] reference wallpaper, find a decent one and upgarde the spells for the rotation, for healer class upgrade your main heal skills too. That's it. Or look up a leveling guide and upgrade focus on the skills fof your leveling dps rotation.
---
But it doesnt even require a video or usage of "skills" to know that the violencelevel console command has been removed or put to 0 and isnt possible to change. Look at every single clip of the classic beta, not a single player have the hit flashes or blood. This isnt something that private servers created to make the game feel more alive, this is something that is in the game client itself and has always been there. I've played the game since open beta so I should know. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
What about the guilt of running out of arrows mid-instance! That shit is real!
---
Knee-jerkers reacting to knee-jerks
---
What if someone likes having the optimum choice? Does that still make them a tryhard or someone just playing what they like
---
IIRC that only affects the 1-5 starting area mobs.
---
It is one of the reasons why I want to play hunter.
---
then you bought it and couldnt stop turning stuff into sheep!
---
Damn, right on. Everyone wants to make their own little change, guess what, not gonna happen. Blizzard is giving us1.12.1 on their new engine, deal with it.
---
I think you will find that shifting is very mana intensive such that you want to be shifting as little as possible to conserve mana and utilize the five-second rule. 
---
This really diminishes the impact of furor as it essentially gives you one free claw every time you shift. OOC gives you potentially much more than that (including a very expensive heal for free). This doesn't include the guaranteed 10% damage you get from natural weapons. Furor can't compete with that.
---
Cause I hate enemy hunters.
---
Afaik they did hit you very far away
---
&gt;It got me through molten core.
---
see, thats where you revealed its a lie. no serious guild would bring a mage who can not conjure water as mages are basically the catering service of WoW.
---
It's really cruel to say to someone "play what you want" and leaving out "but don't expect to  be invited to raids".
---
We can only hope.
---
Dude I’m not even gonna lie I made a buddy on p server and when he stopped logging on I got loweky sad.
---
In my experience as a MT/GM/Officer/CL and various roles I have held in guilds, min/maxer are often also the most reliable players though. The memespeccers have always tended to the the more casual-minded players.
---
It is because mobs cleave, have aoe, thorns shit - you simply die from trash and bosses. In a perfect world then yes, you can just cleave it all down. But then you realize you can't and end up ressing the melee or having them stay out every other pack. 
---
You also can't underestimate healing aggro in TBC - a priest going full dick CoH or PoH does more threat than a big dick DPS.
---
Yeah, that's the word we have from Blizzard too. It just doesn't really make sense for Phase 1 Molten Core. There were a lot of issues with Molten Core loot in those early patches (it dropped all of T2) and Majordomo gave no loot.

Nah you didn't miss anything, they're just creating imaginary scenarios in their head so they can farm karma.

what are you talking about? This is pretty basic shit, especially if you can read LUA. This has nothing to do with aoe, it is literally a hardcoded function to add range to your abilities based on your state of movement. This is client side code which has a reciprocating bit of server code that limits to total added range from this and other functions to +5 max, which then has its offset validated by Warden.
---
Leeway exists, this is literally decompiled game code proving it. There could not exist more irrefutable, concrete evidence. You're either trolling or stupid if you continue to deny it.

Ohhh boy, carebear alert over 9000. I have nothing against nobody, without pansies this game would be duller. Keep up the good work.

I got multiple accounts banned for hacking the game, the ban usually comes a few days/weeks later. Doesn't mean you go off to be a programmer for blizzard.
---
Serious question, never played hunter - If you don't feed your pet, and it runs away, can you recapture it? or does it just run off and despawn?
---
Debatable. You need a decent amount of crit for fury to worth it. Its hard to come by in earlier levels. Not to mention you need to get crit for enrage.

MC loot table will be in it's "fixed" state, how it was in 1.12.
---
That means t2 legs from Rag no other t2. 
---
I'm not 100% certain but I assume even the hunter quest item will be available even though you need to get stuff from phase 2 to finish the bow and staff. 
---
TF parts should probably drop as well even though you need BWL to make the sword.
---
People like to say BWL is the same as MC and is a cakewalk but Vael is a bit of a DPS check to be honest and I think a few guilds will be shocked by that
---
Also its crazy how many people seemed to have forgotten that threat management was a thing in vanilla. Remember that one enhancement shammy that always talked shit about how godlike his dps was that ended up wiping his whole raid over and over because he didn't know how to manage his threat, only how to go all out? There are going to be so many of those douches this time around.. I can hear the retail players now: "no mechanics in vanilla so I can just focus on perfecting my rotation to do maximum deeps" ... "WTF TANK HOLD AGGRO YOU PLEB!!1!!1"
---
Here's how I see it. I'm still subbed but I'm not playing BFA at the moment because I hit a plateau, raid or M+ to progress and I spent so much time (mage) reading about spell rotations etc... that it wasn't fun anymore, one mistake and you get shit/kicked for not doing "your DPS" even when I am literally glued to the computer and making sure I a. Don't die (can't DPS when I'm dead) and b. Praying to whatever deity for my cooldowns and stuff. This does not make an enjoyable game, now lets get to the original wow, if as a raid leader you are going to try and call out people for DPS you won't be a raid leader for long. The mechanics are different you had to play many different abilities of your class and DPS while important wasn't the be all and end all of everything. I'm going to play how I want, sure I'll DPS (not decided on class yet)  but there is so much more to it. I had some crazy settings back in the day and never had an issue with raids or dungeons.
---
It doesn't cause a problem in my eyes. It seems like you don't want a recreation of the game like blizzard tries to do but rather an improved vanilla. And if you want that I agree it's a problem.
---
Theory crafted to oblivion
---

Do you have an issue with other that make spreadsheets ?
---
We might not have the device memory you are blessed with...
---
Too bad that the boss won't drop that much fury loot. So for the first few months you'll have optimal class vs. unoptimal class with better gear. 
---
And after those first months the local min-max guild has stolen all your top geared warriors to fill their 10 slots and you're looking at new hires in pre-raid BIS.
---
It didn't. It first lost health and then the debuff applied the tick after.
---
Cant find it bro :D
---
Weird thing is, I definitely had T2 Wrath helmet and pants before AQ, but I have no memory of them looking like this.
---
Right. But RP on a PvP server doesn't solve the issue caused by the community not having a home to meet like-minded people. People will spread over different servers while the RP-PvP community could definitely regroup on the same server.
---
Yes it does. The server tick after it took damage from blizzard.
---
I agree. I hope we get an definitive answer about how layering will be implemented soon
---
Whoosh?

You make it seem way worse than it is. Anti-cheat?? Isboxer is 100% legal

Thunderfury bindings were actually added 1.4, which suggests phase 2, though of course you can't make the item without BWL. These old comments show the bindings were dropping just after 1.4 release: https://web.archive.org/web/20050526054935/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=18564
---
Leeway was confirmed to be in 1.10+.
---
I don’t understand this mentality, why wouldn’t you want to keep improving, if you’re a raid leader you want to see improvement in clear times, raid dps and coordination. Every person in the raid is a link in the chain, I love the idea of support builds that exist to buff the raid dps and assist in utility/heals but if they aren’t providing an improvement to the raids progression more than bringing another mage I don’t see the point, bring your Reckoning Ret pally on alt night.

Is that what a mechanical keyboard sounds like

This is EVE

Or a pretty genius move selling novelty water. Bet the profit on each of these is great.

Props to blizzard for their wow classic efforts. They are doing everything right.
---
Because not everyone enjoys tryharding.
---
I tryhard in Dota 2, but I never tryharded in WoW Arenas for example, because I just played them for fun.
---
Tryharding can be fun too, but it is different kind of fun than just chilling with pals and killing some dragons etc.
---
Toll!
---
Unless he, or anyone else, ends up, 3-4 weeks into Classic, on an unofficial German or French realm, where 80-90% of the players talk in German or French, EVEN IF THEY KNOW ENGLISH.
---
I hope you really understand this.
---
There was a lot of weird stuff going on in those early patches. At one point Molten Core dropped the entire T2 set alongside T1 sets. I wouldn't be surprised if it dropped during the first week of patch 1.4 and then was hotfixed to not drop again until 1.6.

The thing is, unless you are the top guild of the server, everyone won't be skilled and geared (remember you have 40 slots to fill every night, and considering that everyone won't be able to come every time, that's about 50 person to have.)
---
A geared and skilled ret will always be more valuable than a bad fury warrior. Of course, bad ret are even worse. 
---
But good players will always be valuable even if they want to play a meme spec.
---
That's... not a lot of servers at all.
---
There's no way there's gonna be enough servers to handle the population post-layering, they will have to open new ones and make transfers (what they didn't want to do) or we will have 10k+ servers post phase 2.
---
More people should understand that other people choosing to  MIN-MAX has no bearing on their game and they can do whatever the hell they want
---
Probably will give them bad social credit score too.
---
Yeah, I think we should focus on getting the "best possible" layering for release and hopefully it will not be activated for long.
---
Are there any vids about tier 2.5? I can‘t find any on youtube except of „how to get transmog for 2.5“. AQ was always a mystery for me because I never went into it. (I didnt do naxx either but yeah wotlk you know).
---
Yellow is not a problem, they're just indifferent and they know you'll feed them soon. Red on the other hand, you disappointed them by forgetting to feed them but they still hang around because they love you.
---
Disappointing them once more, they will have to fend for themselves at that point, they'll be heartbroken but they'll have to leave.
---
Feed them while yellow, you can also throw 'em snacks while still green, they deserve it!

The thing is, no spanish servers ok, but if you look at top 10 spoken languages in the world, wtf blizzard

Great, now we just need to give the spanish a realm on their own and we are golden!

Torn between mage and warlock alliance side. Part of me wants to roll warlock because of less competition, but then I feel like I will regret losing out on portals / aoe farming etc. Another part of me wants to roll rogue for the world pvp aspects, and then another part of me wants to roll a healer so that my friends will need me.
---
Sad in the sense that Blizzard would have more capacity using a single server per realm. I'm not sure if you have played retail, but in the most recent expansion, anything more than 20-30 players at the same spot and you're experiencing unstable performance and that's being excused with how much is going on today and how pretty abilities are, but that seems very unlikely considered hardware is also much better now than they were in 2004/2005. Their cloud solution simply isn't geared for an MMORPG, but their blade servers were. I clearly remember massive world pvp with 2-5 seconds delay, but compared to how todays server solutions handle large amount of players (layering, sharding) the latter was preferable.
---
As mentioned, I have no doubt their server infrastructure is better and more powerful today, but they don't seem to make them able to handle the same load per server, since it can be dynamically scaled, but that hurts a game that is MMORPG.
---
Geil!
---
Male or Female Orc Rogue?
---
It's 2 levels extra to stealth.
---
It's an important part of the RPg genre to have these kinds of little class specific mechanics. Otherwise the difference between classes would be mainly esthetic, sounds familiar? *Cough* retail WoW *cough*
---
sounds nice in theory, gaming is not commerce though.
---
In reality where is scaling when you cant even play in a 40 man raid without the server crashing and the phasing and cross realm stuff is just awfull.
---
All that was possible and better on 15 year old hardware, pretty embarrassing.

---
No.
---
He is indeed right. Look up bubbas warcraft hack. Notice that this worked eaaaarly in vanilla
---
You should always bring the player and not the class. Good players tend to not enjoy playing something that is sub-optimal and not competitive. This means you can pretty safely rule out 99% of the people who want to dps as a healing class just right off the bat.
---
This triggers me so much. I'm working with networking, server infrastructure and software development for a living, and the amount of people that have no clue, but still give "good" technical advice completely blows my mind out of the park.

Cloud bad. New servers bad. Like when did people stop actually using their brains?

Yeah lets make changes so it feels like bfa /s

Can we all now rally to get Leeway removed so that Casters can be viable in PvP? This is coming from someone who mains a Rogue so definitely benefits a lot from Leeway, but it's honestly not needed with todays connection speeds.

THANK GOD. I love all you Hermanns and Pierres but you should be allowed your own realms where you don't have to expend the extra effort to speak in broken English if you're not familiar, it's not fair on anyone. Good news.
---
All: Yay! woooo! Yeah! ...
---
Stan: what now?
---
Cartman: now we can finally play the game!
---
All depends on how successful you think Classic WoW is going to be. If a lot of people come back then 20 realms is a low number. However basing it off the current sub count then 20 realms isn't too far fetched.
---
Because having local in house hardware for a game as big as WoW is unrealistic, it's much cheaper/easier/effective to have it in a data center were the company hosting it will have it's undivided attention on managing and supporting the hardware.
---
Damn, all 15 of you guys?
---
THANK YOU
---
&gt; Its debatable is lvl 1-39 better to do DW or 2H fury, it all depends can you get good 1h weapons but its sure that leveling as fury until you can get mortal strike is better. But thats just minmaxing, so do whatever you want long as you dont quest as prot warrior. :D
---
Thats debatable, also Arms is much better for world PvP than DW or 2H Fury.
---
Ye i know dat, we conquered that ages ago😂 But even blizzard forgot about those guys, i personally dont have any problem playing spanish or english servers i dont care, but its just wierd.

The new servers are fine, Blizz even acknowledged themselves the reason why they lag under large PvP battles on Retail is because of the amount of calculations going on for spells which just chug them, large PvP battles on Beta seem to have been fine thus far

...it would be pretty fucking stupid to have this code client side but not server side.

Tbc fixed mana issues perfectly with its different talent additions.

If they're connecting to a game outside of China, they're already using a VPN, so it won't do anything.

It’s incredibly safe. PvP is just queing for it, or duels.

There is no world PvP.
---
It is still satisfying since it’s classic, but no risk attached to it other then the more difficult mobs
---
I played retail up until the end of 8.1 and I have no idea what you are saying about 20-30 players in the same spot making the game unstable.
---
I've been in multiple locations in the open word and instanced with more 20-30 people and I have not experienced anything near what you are saying here

YES! We did it guys :D

You aren't that smart, are you?

Pretty repulsive post history too.

RP PvP severs and I'm set! Go for it blizzard. You know we want it and you know it's needed.

Female easily. Orc make rogues are too clunky imo.

Thanks Blizz for not forcing me to play with French people ❤️
---
Enhance is absolute mey-mays. 
---
But I would love to play around on some target dummy server and test out damage with lets say, ironfoe+HoJ and a lot of STR and AGI for kicks and giggles. WF doesn't have an ICD nor is it on a PPM system (yet). 
---
Obviously this wouldn't work in reality because even if it did do decent damage (which it probably won't), the amount of threat it would generate would be fucking ungodly.
---
There was never a reason why we wouldn't get servers, blizzard spent the money to get servers located in sydney, they are going to make use of them..
---
One of the things I'm looking forward to the most is hanging out in IF and seeing the same names and guilds every day.
---
This is so true yet goes completely ignored by the masses
---
Priest is a free pass into raids and Ive healed before, but pvp sucks unless you have good teammates in discord and you cant farm solo.
---
Warrior is another pass into raids, tanking is super fun, but pvp sucks unless someone healbot you and everyone kite you to death,also cant farm solo very well. 
---
Warlock is fun to play, somewhat usefull for raids, can solo a lot of stuff, pvp is fun, but do I really want to spam shadowbolt through all raids? 
---
Rogue is super fun to play, can pvp, lockpick and farm solo, but there will be a lot of rogues and its WAY harder to get into raids, unless you grind like crazy. 
---
Mage is basically rogue, but without -lockpicking +AoE farm
---
So, what the heck should I play? I want to play all this classes :c

Yes, you are right, every single employee at Blizzard is just lazy so they produce a mediocre experience because they can't be bothered to do anything better. Great analysis.
---
There are literally dozens of us!
---
I tend to disagree depending on the situation. On past games like ff11 I had fun trying to bridge the language barrier. Granted it was easier work the system they had in place but I've had similar situations while playing before lfg where occasionally I'd run into someone of the opposite faction and we just happened to not want to kill each other so we helped each other out with the help of emotes and running around and jumpin, etc.
---
What hybrid class has the most equal balance of a viable healing and DPS spec? My ideal class is one that I can do really well mainly as a healer, then start hearing an off-spec for DPS and not be laughed at (ie. Holy Pala playing Ret).
---
This is for both PvP and PvE.
---
Venite con noi mes amis :&gt;

I envisage people having more issues on Razorgore and Vael than they expect. They're not mechanically challenging fights, they just require some semblance of organisation and you quickly find out who the weakest links in your guild are. When there's 40 people there are bound to be a few
---
Yeah come a week after release this guy is going to come in here and say something like "we didn't get rag the first week because..." and just insert an excuse that people aren't claiming will be an issue.. something like hunter pets not working properly or zeppelins being slower than on pservers.. something stupid
---
You were the one asking me another question, if you don't want answers don't ask.
---
Female. Male Orcs will probably look weird with small daggers
---
Think everyone can agree that - can't see any downsides to be honest.
---
male sure, female has the best 2h special animation available ingame
---
Wand spec is still better in pvp at early levels. Priests will never beat any class with healing spells without wand spec.
---
I'm absolutely stoked to play this game again when it comes out, and the developers willingness to listen to the community on a whole host of issues have done nothing but made me even more excited. They're awesome, the game is awesome, it's going to be a...mazing!
---
Great news... I'm from a French speaking country but will still be playing on an English/EU server.  
---
Why? Well, I don't believe that the french server (singular of course) will be all that alive after 6 months. The server will either look like a barren world where you cross someone once a day or players who can speak well english will change servers (or play on an english eu server from the beginning).
---
The question is: Will the FR server be PvE or PvP?
---
As much as this comment is?
---
Rag will die 2nd week.. Asmongold probably won't be there, but tThe real question is if someone will be able to get him first week, imo..
---
I mean, no? Blizzard didn't forget. This is about EU servers, not Central or South American ones.
---
&gt; you look much better by actually trying 
---
Raiding is a *group* effort, and you're both contributing a good deal less to the raid than you could. And if that's the climate in your raid ("my co-players make me look good by being lazy fucks"), you will hit a brick wall sooner or later. That lazy player can fix his attitude, but you can't fix your numbers and mechanics. That said, "Yay, I look good because someone else isn't trying" also isn't really conducive to a successful raid, because the corollary of this attitude is "I won't help my mates get better, because I'd look worse in comparison".
---
&gt; Do raid leaders actually click through each member to see what self-buffs they've brought along?
---
Raid leaders? Usually not. But a raid has 40 people, and quite some *do* check out their brethren and sisters. And if you're a rogue who takes care to always have your elixirs up, and your food buffs, and your gear enchanted and whatnot - and then you're clicking your rogue mates, and there's one that doesn't even have a +dam enchant on his Perdition's Blade, and no Mongoose up; The first thing you'll do is to whisper them if they forgot their pots/enchants, and offer some of yours in case they didn't have time to suit up. B
---
But if this sort of attitude persists (if they're short-term-borrowing mongooses off of you three times in two weeks, it's a pattern), you can be sure that people make a mental note of it. And if that perpetually-relying-on-others rogue gets loot priority over the engaged one, the rest of the pack will bring up this lack of engagement.

Stealth have a 10 seconds base cd (5 seconds with a 5 point talent in subtlety).
---
With 5 seconds or even 10 seconds, it is quite likely that someone can come running around a corner if you started eating or maybe if you start eating in the open a hunter suddenly hunter's mark you. 
---
With no cd at all (by using shadowmeld) you can safely start eating anywhere.
---
Damn, saving these 10 silver will surely matter.
---
I believe they are valid dps contenders in the beginning days/weeks of MC. Afterwards, they fall off dps-wise and a great deal of effort is needed to remain relevant.
---
Porreiro!
---
Definitely. You often see posts on here complaining about people complaining. And sure it's a bit tiresome to see the same thread about x perceived problem every day, but if most people don't like a change it's a good thing to make some noise about it. The "stop complaining about x" posts are usually not adding much to the conversation, as they often don't talk about the "problem", just about people complaining.
---
Tho, you can do that in many modern MMOs, too. You just have to be more active about it instead of getting forced by the game.
---
Standing is also = "not walking". So is swimming, riding, flying.
---
And if that check was purely based off speed (I highly doubt this has anything to do with that though), what would riding a 60% mount with a 40% slow debuff count as (resulting speed = 96%)? How about a rogue using Sprint (+70%) with a 40% slow debuff (final speed 102%)?
---
Based on common practice naming conventions in coding and for what this function is used here, its much more likely and logical that this function just checks for a few simple state of actions wether a player is currently "moving" or not. We would need to see the code of this function to be able to tell.
---
This is very interesting. I love this sort of pvp. However I'm a bit skeptical of finding a guild thats interested in world pvp. One can dream:) Thank you for the reply!

There isn't a clear line here, even if you're right everybody speaks about things they don't have a formal education in at some time or another.

Looking forward to all the posts "lost my pet!"  "Logged on and my pet was gone?"  "Anyone know where the stable master is?  Cant summon my pet."
---
There's no massive difference other than the fact that ganking isn't a thing. As far as how satisfying the leveling is, it depends on how much you enjoy world pvp. For someone who is only interested in leveling it might even be more enjoyable.
---
The thing that makes some people choose PvP over PvE though is that the player base of PvP servers tend to be the more "hungry" players, while PvE server tends to have more laid back and "alternate play style" players. So when you do pugs on PvP servers you will generally be playing with people who are interested in doing things efficiently, while on PvE servers you tend to run into a more meandering mindset.
---
I was pretty sure they will offer French and German Servers since its really not much additional effort and it would have made really no sense to not have them since there would just be unoffial German/French Servers anyways. 
---
Now less people get stuck on a German Server without speaking German.
---
Rule #2: Be civil and respectful.
---
Just because someone isn't fluent in your language does not make them sub human.
---
English is the 3rd most popular language in the world and 75% of Americans aren't fluent in anything but English (and I would argue many aren't even fluent *in* English). So that makes Americans sub-human by your argument.

Just need to PvP now and we are done!

It's private server mentality leaking over into classic WoW, which funnily enough also wasn't a thing we had in Vanilla much like streamers. Basically, the dudes who've played nothing but Vanilla for years and years and years had nothing better to do but figure out the exact way to do everything and then decided to speed run everything. 
---
Since they've been doing it all this time they're trying to tell as many people as possible that that is the only way to play the game, which isn't true, but they believe it is. It's also why so many gods damned people keep talking like AQ40 and Naxx are right around the corner and that if you don't gear up as quick as possible you won't be able to do anything and nobody will want to take you to any raids. 
---
Simple fact of the matter is, we all know vanilla is easy. If you want to min-max, then go ahead and do it and find people/a guild that shares that interest with you. If you don't want to min-max, that's perfectly okay too and you should also endeavor to find people who share similar interests. Nobody should be trying to convince the entire community how to play, one way or the other, and everyone should try to get along and have fun in Classic (whatever that fun is to you).

Can there only be one AQ mount per server?

Have fun trying to get a certain Naxx boss down with shit like an enhancement shaman.

What country in OC (with a meaningful player base) has a language barrier towards the USA?

I think people are underestimating vanilla, yeah the encounters aren't as hard as mythic raiding, but wrangling 40 people is tough, threat can be a real killer, and undergeared tanks are pretty hard to keep up,the first few months are going to be rough for people who think they are going to raid as suboptimal specs.
---
I joined a fairly hardcore raiding guild, we have been doing our own private server and raiding to practice for live, we intentionally gimp our gear to roughly what we would think we would have depending on when a raid will be released and things are absolutely not smooth sailing all the time, tanks die sometimes, dps overaggros, people get caught by mechanics, healers run out of mana. 
---
TLDR: Again im not saying vanilla is super hard or anything but its still respectably difficult  content for probably 90% of the playerbase and the amount of times we have killed a boss by the skin of our teeth tells me that people who are expecting to raid casually/use subpar specs are going to have to be waiting for probably 6 months or better until the average gear of the raiders is enough to make up for their lack of numbers
---
Oh my you are not the sharpest tool in the shed...
---
&gt; They've promised an authentic Vanilla experience, warts and all.

Except for the layering that is.

Hope they change their minds on that one tbh.

&gt; if as a raid leader you are going to try and call out people for DPS you won't be a raid leader for long 
---
This will still be the case.  
---
Any spec that ends up "below tanks" needs an excellent reason for being there.  
---
pure dps classes, should be in their expected output range.  
---
Being called out is not a negative thing, as a raid leader its impossible to have 100% overview, and if some event is causing players to not deal their expected dps, it needs to be resolved from a strategy point of view.  
---
&gt; The mechanics are different you had to play many different abilities of your class and DPS while important wasn't the be all and end all of everything 
---
You're right, you can be called out on other aspects aswell, if you have bad uptime on windfury or low amount of decurse/dispels, those are also things people can be expected to be called out on.   
---
It's a package deal, if you have an Enh shaman and you expect him to flail on the boss for \~300dps, and he ends up doing 150, his windfury uptime is below 90% and most of his damage is from lightning bolt.  
---
You're getting called out, on multiple things.
---
&gt;A geared and skilled ret will always be more valuable than a bad fury warrior. 
---
That's a nice fantasy, but it's not true. A bad fury warrior is still much more valuable than a good ret.
---
That was what he said dude.
---
Damage is multiplied, first time by 1.3 so you get 130% and then by 1.15 for a total of 149.5%
---
oh right... not going hunter
---
Hahahaha...hah
---
The meandering mindset aspect is very interesting. I'm more laid back myself. Maybe PVE could even be my main realm. But then again damn I enjoy PVP. Decisions decisions.
---
Dwarf priest for treasure finding.
---
As someone who actually raided as enhancement shaman for quite a while in classic I can assure you, that this isn't just about a small difference. You are lucky if you do more than the healers.
---
The only part that is, is if you’re levelling by yourself you never have to worry about being ganked. And even for some, that’s not a good thing. I’m also assuming there will be more people on WPvP servers as well.
---
You can most likely level faster on a PvE server though as no one can kill you except for mobs.
---
Let's hear those magical solutions able to solve both problems at once
---
&gt;Personally, I'd say fuck #nochanges on this one, and get some more balance up in here, but what do you guys think?
---
Fixing the existing game certainly makes more sense than adding more content(1.13)
---
Every country has cunts in it.
---
Gl getting the 2.5 tokens before the non retardins. Maybe when they are rotting on bosses after a few months of clearing AQ
---
Great news! Wonder if I'm gonna be able to play on EN servers since they said that RU will have separate client.
---
Rare, not very rare.
---
Russians are an absolute plague on EU servers. Their decision to merge them with us on live was absolutely stupid and it still fucks us all today.
---
Keeping them separated is the best option.
---
To clarify, this is because of how Russians play (always premade in BGs) and how laggy things are when placed with/vs them, not because they're bad people.
---
Sadly i cant, as i didn't play on pvp server :)
---
Well, maybe just a tiny bit, but not long enough to provide any accurate judgement.
---
To be precise, you need around 56-60 linen cloth to craft the appropriate amount of robes to disenchant. If you really focus on just getting your wand ASAP, you can have it by level 6-7 usually.
---
This will absolutely be the case in the first few months. Most will learn relatively fast though and those that dont learn are the ones that are shit in retail aswell.
---
So screw Spanish players right? They probably believe we are in Mexico or something like that.
---
my romance language is pizza and netflix
---
Earning 1000 gold in BFA takes a laughable amount of time compared to Classic. If they every implement something like this it would be the dumbest shit ever
---
It is very important to take breaks whenever possible and walk around stretching your legs so the blood doesn't stop flowing.
---
Humans didn't evolve for sitting 12 hours a day and that's why these office jobs are so bad for us.
---
Played a little at the end of legion, people got mad and called us elitist when we shit on them for not knowing the mechanics of a raid that has been out for weeks and constantly kept dying to that c'thun eyebeam slowroll thing. 
---
Being "bad" is subjective and depends on what you want to do in classic. If you want to do tryhard speedrunning, not having engineering is bad. If you just want to clear Naxx, obviously you don't need to have engineering.
---
PvP is a bit different since in PvP an engineer vs a non engineer is in a completely different league. If I ran a pre-made group or were in a pre-made group I wouldn't allow anyone without engineering, since getting high ranks is already time consuming, wouldn't want to waste time losing BGs.
---
Oh, they just did. How's the snarkyness now?
---
Learning spanish atm,spanish servers would be great to practice
---
Thank you blizzard
---
It will have next to no impact compared to 3rd party gold sellers. The fact that you can "buy" ~130,000 gold in Retail for $20 won't give players an incentive to trade their Classic gold. The exchange rate will be dictated by the GPH in Classic versus the GPH in Retail and will be near identical to the exchange rate on 3rd party sites. And since it still violates the EULA and is likely to get flagged by Blizzard the same as 3rd party gold selling/buying, if you're going to bother, the people with Classic gold will just sell it to the 3rd parties (or more likely, just keep it).
---
Grim Batol was mostly a Portuguese speaking server, that so that merged with Aggra-Português Server on retail. 
---
Aggra is a portuguese specific server but in English community.
---
I am asking classic participants, i know for a fact you are not one of those...
---
furthermore as stated its 7.1.5 and its simply a recreation... a lot of the code is still that of 7.1.5 and will remain, what i seek to find out is if the maps remained or not...
---
As a German: Stabil.
---
Seriously, this gives me hope that we may get RP-PVP. Keep making noise people!
---
They keep making the right choices.
---
Np! Any chance you could share some of your fondest memories from a PVE server? I'd like to really understand what's it like to play and enjoy a PVE server.
---
Oh yes they are, Demi. Especially on such a hype release, expect a ton of whispers.
---
Well no wonder since that's not fun at all... For me wpvp is those random 1v1-5v5 encounters while you are leveling... not some bored 60 who one shots you while passing by...
---
Any chance you could share some of your fondest memories from PVE server?
---
This man is clearly delusional, get him to the infirmary.
---
Race I pick whatever I like, but in terms of spec and gearing I would choose whatever is optimal
---
Anyone got any idea how it'd be for a hunter to stack Thunderfury, Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom and spell dmg / nature dmg for a optimal dps meme specc ? 
---
I'm starting to think it wouldn't be as meme-y any more.
---
The only thing left now is RpPvP servers at launch. You can do it Blizz!
---
Making the most of your contribution to the group and feeling like you bring value to the table *is* fun for a lot of people.
---
Italians being somewhat dominant on servers is more plausible than Spanish. Looking at both: actual population of the countries and active current players on retail show that there are way more Italians than Spanish.
---
Both will certainly be way lower than French and German players, so the current decision is definitely sensible. Iirc Italian servers were only added way later (in BC even?), don't know about spanish tbh. but I think it was later as well.
---
nerd
---
Not four, but my five man group is looking pretty good.
---
Mage, Lock, Restro Shaman, and Rogue
---
Then me either Prot Warrior or Enhance Shaman
---
Prot Warrior more for the group
---
Enhance Shaman more for me
---
I personally probably won't play Classic again if they don't have Oceanic servers. Experiencing that lag and delay once was enough. 
---
It will be a shame if they don't give us atleast one server.
---
Wow I’d totally forgotten about model changing. When did that even stop working?? I definitely model changed to make up for my lack of raising..
---
:( no spanish realm...Spinebreaker here we go again lol..
---
We cant put a server there.....they didn't have any in Vanilla.
---
Remember everyone...no changes..no QoL changes, no balance changes, no upgrades.
---
Where would it end? TimF'ingbucktoo? Antarctica? 
---
We can't do anything to change how it was in Vanilla...Or we end up with just another copy of Retail.
---
&gt; Sadly I doubt they will let layering go
---
Probably, but for me personally, it's either a Classic sub without layering, or no sub. And I can either shut my trap and just let things play out, or I can at least *voice* my position, so the devs may understand *why* I prefer hours-long queues and maybe even an inability to log in to layering. 
---
 This really is a make/break issue for me, because the mechanic compromises one of the core qualities of Classic. Keeping it in just demonstrates that the devs talk a big talk about the Vanilla Spirit, but they aren't prepared to walk the walk.
---
They can just take the french server not like the bully victims are going to try and do something
---
I'm happy that we are getting our own servers (am French), but also I'm disappointed by our reputation on English realms x( 
---
I wish I could prove you guys otherwise, but that's the sad reality. Anyway, it's a win both for French/German and English speakers, let's celebrate!
---
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=jYuUD0o-Nz8) (around 5:45). Ion states here that each layer will have the aproximatly capasity of a wow vanilla server at launch. Even though its second-hand-knowledge (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17618023994) Mark kern (project lead vanilla wow) have said that the server cap was 3,5-4k (the original tweet is gone). (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-servers-population-caps-and-the-likeliness-of-queues/129840) In this link the poster doesnt either give a source, but asures us that the server caps were around 2,5-3k! There are also this screeb shot(https://i.imgur.com/yNWkujT.png) Of Mark Kern stating hardware limitations! Thank you for the opportunity to clearify!
---
As a former Crushridge Italian players I found an international guild, I've had enough to play with Italians only
---
huh? xd
---
Im not the one trying to sensationalize something trivial
---
It won't be missed.
---
Layering won't help a dead server, it's meant to prevent them.
---
Instead of launching Classic with 500+ worldwide servers like the old days that eventually created problems that lead to dead servers, realm mergers, and cross-server play, they'll launch Classic with 50 worldwide servers or probably even fewer than that.
---
This means every server will be grossly overpopulated at launch, giving them the best chance to have the best population later.
---
&gt; Its is bad for the economy
---
No, not really.
---
&gt; it is bad for world pvp
---
&gt; it is bad for social interactions
---
&gt; But when i do /who i see that there are still people in my zone except in another layer.
---
If you're talking about the Beta or Stress Tests, the Layering logic in both of those is way more aggressive than what they'll likely be at launch. And since the the quality of the economy, world PVP, and social interactions is not the goal of the Beta nor the Stress Tests, those issues are irrelevant.
---
FR server needs to get region locked
---
There is too much gear going to waste by using only warriors and rogues for example. I dunno find likeminded players. I know I got about 30+ friends currently starting up a guild and even though we are pretty hardcore in the sense of achievement I doubt we would ignore anyone who wanna raid as feral for a while.
---
Welke server gaan wij K O L O N I S E R E N?
---
I'm sorry but if you mean ALL vanilla raids, you have to have a point where you draw a line. Raiding with 2 boomkins, a shadowpriest, and 2 ret pallies will bite you H-A-R-D come AQ40/Naxx.
---
This looks great!
---
Dubito seriamente ci siano decine di server come in vanilla
---
Realms won’t be added when they remove layers.
---
I really hope so too.  I miss that old vanilla community.
---
As a warmup for classic i resubbed to retail for the first time in a long time and the community was just utterly toxic.  Sucked any sort of excitement I had for it right away.
---
Hoping classic is different.
---
Most of this was mitigated by the time you reached cap though.  Everyone had money for ports, 90/96 rezzes took the sting out of death and coffins were 180p in classic and about 60p (and fit in bags ) in kunark.  Early early eq was difficult but once you were capped, outside of fear breaks, wasn't too awful.  Very time consuming though.  Think in kunark I camped ragefire for 88 hours straight with one break covered by a guildy.
---
Not that wrong you just used an old grammar form, that nobody use anymore
---
This is my favorite line.
---
[ODD GROUPS HAVE LEFT](https://youtu.be/uLDytJC655c)
---
As a English-server player living in Berlin - I'm happy for you guys but sad there wont be any locals on my server.
---
Also I hope you guys have seperate battlegroups for cross-realm bgs.
---
I'm not playing the game currently but aren't all live servers just PvE servers now? My understanding is that War Mode is essentially the same as a PvE server and that there is no longer any such thing on BFA as PvE vs. PvP servers.
---
Ok. Where is portuguese servers?
---
I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of people who are not subbed. I'll be honest, I'm not subbed. Although I'm not subbed to a lot of subs I frequent
---
The entire reason for the name reserve is for Blizzard to see if their estimates for Classic player base is correct or not.
---
I fully expect that Blizzard is WAY OFF in their estimation, and the realm names list that will be available prior to August 13th will prove it.
---
For the EU, Blizzard is planning, as they said "several" realms. The range of "several" usually means less than 10. So, worldwide, we can expect less than 30 realms for Classic, and the initial list, prior to August 13th.
---
Several also means 5-6. Which translates into 15-18, maybe 20 realms worldwide.
---
So, realistically speaking (based on "several"), we can expect between 20 and 30 realms for Classic, worldwide. Which is an EXTREMELY low number of realms, even if it's the upper end of 30.
---
30 realms, with Vanilla-like population, is around 300k players. With a slightly higher population, around 350k players.
---
So, LONG TERM, Blizzard is expecting between 300k and 350k players for Classic.
---
Or, to say it better, Blizzard expects NOW, before the name reserver option, 300-350k players, long term for Classic.
---
I expect the realm list that will be available before August 13th to be updated on the same very day, to at least 3 times more realms, because, let's be honest here...does anyone normal in their head expects less than 1 million Classic players long term?
---
I think I'm horny now
---
It already exists my man. I’m going to buy a ton of classic gold, fuck farming I actually want to play the game.
---
Indeed they will 😋
---
Not true, I could play from China without a VPN with no problems whatsoever
---
Phase 1 raiding won't really matter, you can clear MC with a bunch of monkeys. You can level up multiple toons to 60 then decide what you want to main going into phase 2. I'd even argue you can still change your main going into phase 3, but you will have a harder time after.
---
So just level up a bunch of characters and don't worry about raiding until P2.
---
If classic features achievements it's DOA.
---
its still an insanely obnoxious amount in a subdivision of a unit. Hence the metric system is so much easier to understand/use for the rest of the world.
---
It sounds like your decision is made (and I think it’s a good one), you just haven’t accepted it yet
---
I wish we could give you guys your own sharded version of IRL too but that’s the sad reality x(
---
I've always been a player that focuses on doing my best, and that's not gonna change. But back then I was very much a "front of the pack" player. I've done pretty much everything that a lot of people are aspiring to achieve with the launch of Classic. 
---
This time around I'm not aspiring to be a leader in any way. I'm picking a healer instead of my traditional warrior as main, I have no interest in any of the racing, I'm not gonna take any responsibilities beyond being a member in any guilds I join and my main goal is probably gonna be to just get a bunch of alts leveled and geared. 
---
Still gonna play a bunch and always apply myself, but I'll be fine with joining a mid tier guild that just gets together and raids for the fun of it. At least I hope I will, maybe my impatience sneaks back in and I'll end up playing a warrior again. Not gonna touch the PvP grind with a ten foot pole though, that's for sure. Once was enough =)
---
You won't get far with your decision-making if you don't introduce a score-system that you can use to weigh the pros and cons against each other!
---
I disagree, I think enough people will play to keep the servers alive. 
---
And if not, then we can migrate to an English speaking server but that would probably cause the initial language problem. 
---
I know that if the French server I'm playing on is dead, then I'll be fine by migrating to an English server and switch language. Not sure about other people tho.
---
Om the other hand they are the only healers that could off tank for a bit if your tanks die when the boss is at 2% HP, they are the very best flag carriers, they are the hardest class to kill in pvp... you are just looking at balancing ehen it comes to the stuff you are interested in instead of looking at the whole picture
---
thanks for the meaningful response!
---
I do agree, but consider the flip side. What if Blizzard releases Oceania servers and they end up with absolute rock bottom populations? That's exactly why they first decided to squish all of EU into the same handful of servers. Whatever metrics they used to determine that decision must have changed, probably in response to the reactions from players on the forums. 
---
So it's good you have this stance and likely that many other Oceania players do too, because if they announce no Oceania servers, you're going to have to make as large a stink as Germany and France did, but with half the population.
---
What if he doesn’t like to play rogues though?
---
No but you have to turn in the quest within 10 hours after the first one used the gong
---
I genuinely can't wrap my mind around the idea that saying someone can react to an event up to a fifth of a second after they've been hit by CC from someone else and that adds a layer of skill.
---
You’re actually retarded
---
LOL
---
What did we do to you?!
---
Likewise dude. For me it's always been about competing within the class as well, I get the most satisfaction out of beating my mates of the same class. If I can jump someone playing a theoretically better class that's just a bonus
---
좋아
---
Dumbest choice blizzard has made so far
---
lol me too honestly.
---
10 years ago I moved to AD and I'm happy there.
---
Cities full of people and super-active AH.
---
After Dire Maul is released, you could farm lashers in before 60. You need a large mana pool but it’s safe and great xp if you can pull it off.
---
Honestly I dont know. I quit wow in 2007 and only played on PVP servers.
---
Feral cat DPS
---
Should have made it asskandi
---
&gt; but I'd be hesitant to support altering it because ultimately I still enjoy the game, which isn't a guarantee if they start making changes.
---
That is always going to be a good point. I just had this on my mind for a while and wanted to post about it. I will also be enjoying the game, just like you.
---
...kurwa?
---
Thats the only reason I‘m going to play classic. I tried to talk in heroics in bfa once and got told to shut up. So yeah that was sad
---
Exactly.
---
They have a ton of PvP-relevant tools in their kit that are totally not taken into consideration by OP.
---
Stealth, Charge, can get out of polymorph, can get speed-bonus without having to mount...
---
pve is farming for farming. avoid pve servers if you want to get full expirience
---
i literally never had a bad experience with UK dotka players.  they were rare, but when they did crop up they were always cheeky banter lords.
---
Russian players often got rage-y but just as often were really funny and good to play with
---
Germans though... omg the passive aggressive comments over voice chat when you didn't do everything just the way they wanted... they're an anal bunch
---
Time for russia to get us that leeway code, so we can know for sure!
---
I only remember that there was a hunter back in the days stacking arcane spell damage and one shotting everyone with arcane shot.  
---
I think it was nerfed later on.
---
jawohl
---
Yeah it probably wont be a perfect 1:1 as like what you say about domos chest they'll just let it slide I'm sure. As far as the extra rank 14 rewards  I could definitely see that being in early as well. I think there will be positive and negatives of what they choose and it'll probably have its own meta.
---
Does it exist a server list of what that will be available at this point? If not, do we know if we can expect such a list before launch?
---
I imagine that me and many others with me will try to organise friend groups to center around certain servers.
---
Rogue:
---
You can stunlock people who are busy fighting elites and then post videos on youtube for quick subs.
---
i want to get a gorilla and name it after my RL friend though D: he is built like a gorilla and since he's a white guy we call him the vanilla gorilla haha
---
Also PSA: If you level a character on a PvE server, that character cannot be later transfered to a PvP server. Atleast that is how it worked in Vanilla. So you couldn't level up a toon on PvE for smooth leveling and then transfer him to PvP once you got max level.
---
Balance is definitely tricky when you make changes that affect such different aspects of the game as PvE vs PvP. I am deffo not saying it would be easy.
---
bLiZzArD dOeSNt LisTEn
---
cLaSSiC iS Do0OmEd
---
Hunters have some of the lowest dps, but are still required for their tranq shot and other utility.
---
Yeah honestly after playing a bit more I'm realizing that at this level I should be in bear form more than cat, and stick in the feral tree. That way once I get a better finisher for cat form as well as fff it'll start to shine.
---
Sounds like a plan! So I can get rogue or mage for farming and then level warrior or priest as a raid main.
---
Gotta think about it a bit more, thank you for the tip tho c:
---
Just exploring, doing stuff with guild

[Patch 1.8](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.8.0):
---
&gt; The Thunderfury effect's spell damage will no longer be increased by other item effects.
---
I found sources claiming DMC Maelstrom *might* have scaled with spellpower and I found sources claiming DMC Maelstrom did not scale with spellpower, but I found none that said it did.
---
I believe all you need is a subscription to WoW there may be quit a few classic players who won’t actually own bfa
---
Male or Female Nelf Hunter or maybe dwarf
---
I mean it solves both
---
When did they update the MC weps? I remember obsidian edge being that curved model and core hound tooth being the little claw
---
Really? Wow that's disconcerting because I get dodged and parried so often and I'm level 26
---
I'm going with Shaman. I have no interest in playing Paladin, Druid is sorta garbage and Priest means I'll pretty much be stuck in heal spec no matter what (which has no versatility).
---
My very first character (technically two first) was a Priest, and I still remember slowly bashing Satyrs with a mace while SW:P was ticking away to farm Felcloth for my epic mount (this was before auto-wand was a thing). I quickly lost the patience for that after playing other classes.
---
You won't be buying shit until the farmers are levelled and have stock my boy.
---
all group content is more difficult to complete because the player skill is so much lower, you could probably start on a pvp server and play there for 6 months and if you dislike it by the time you hit 60 on a pve server no one will have even cleared MC yet
---
&gt; I am deffo not saying it would be easy.
---
Which is why it will never happen. We're getting Classic only because it's relatively easy for Blizzard to produce.
---
that's not true, I know what you mean but there's actually a lot of people who will be playing that didn't even buy the bfa pack and will just sub when classic's out
---
No, you don't have beta.
---
Blizzard is adding a bunch of shit that doesn't belong to simulate that  just fine.
---
You'll be swinging nightfall so make your idea based on that
---
I never targeted anyone, why are you offended by this?  
---
Just because you haven't met them doesn't mean they don't exist. There are lots of people (not just germans/french/spanish) that do not know and do not want to learn English. I'm not talking about a specific person or country here.
---
You can create 3 characters or something 13th of August
---
you can play the game and make friends on retail.  it's not remotely the same experience as vanilla, and layers result in a more retail experience.
---
&gt; Because Johnny doesn't care enough to try and be better, you look much better by actually trying (which you should be as a suboptimal dps class anyway), meaning you might actually get higher priority over something 
---
When your guild full of lazy people and feral druids will be stuck in MC, because they don't need to min-max at least a little...your guild will disband or the better players will leave.
---
Point is...yes, you don't need to min-max for Ony and MC...but after, you will kinda NEED to, at least a little bit, if you ever want to see raids PAST Molten Core and Ony.
---
&gt; Do raid leaders actually click through each member to see what self-buffs they've brought along? - I don't know, but I somewhat doubt it. 
---
There are addons for that.
---
I would caution that per server/faction you have 1-5 guild raids that can choose the perfect combination for the majority of their raids. The rest depending on server size and age will have to make do with left overs so to speak.
---
I wasn't blind when I played last time but alright.
---
Hashtag dwarf priest master race
---
Blizzard this language layering is just unacceptable.
---
The strive for "balance" is why BFA is the way it is. We don't need and really shouldn't want "balance."
---
I played on pve Bronzebeard through classic and i found it very rare to see someone toggled.
---
Was vanilla shipped in spanish and italian? I just wonder how present theae countries are in retail and classic beta
---
At first I thought it was a troll too. It's a poorly written post in broken English, countering the exact point he is trying to make. It just seems TOO perfectly ironic.
---
But if you skim his posts u/morfisia consistently has the same rambling style. So it's probably option B.
---
It has settings, you know :)
---
3.5 gb dl.. 3.16gb on screen. Prepare yourself for the infinite patcher pop ups
---
This guy downloaded WoW 2.0 already years ago, why do people still cry that they want a WoW 2 ^/s
---
Huh that's weird. I did play vanilla but it was long enough ago that I can't claim to remember how it actually was. 
---
I do know on Netherwing that everyone spams T clap for threat. Improved T clap is also a talent that tanks dip into arms for.
---
I just finished playing a warrior to 70 on Netherwing and clearing all the heroics. Warrior tanking was already a pain in the ass for large and fast pulls. I can't even imagine trying it without t clap.
---
What about layering though?
---
WOW
---
Choice.
---
THANK THE GODS
---
Just secure your name on every server lul
---
except only a small number of people a week would be able to even get them. its not like you are gonna see an entire raid with R14 weapons
---
Alright, I stand corrected. Let's say "most" then.
---
You misspelled French :D
---
Retail doesn't have much that I wnat, tbh. They homogenized everything, which is so sad. Homogenizing is not a requirement for balance, though.
---
Still, I hear what you're saying.
---
Is this sex?
---
Did you play alliance?
---
It's cool to have some healthy skepticism to what I said. Either way, it's all good, my friend. I'm glad you found what server type you enjoyed more! That's the way it should be. We should be glad Blizzard gave us the choices between server types instead of shoehorning us into one.
---
I do feel bad for those who feel coerced into playing on a server they enjoy less because of peer pressure, though. On any server type.
---
I'm french and my first thought was "nice because french servers !" but my second was about the spanish and the italian not getting their servers, for now, because i truely think it could change. I think lot of french and german people don't forget about you and wish to help you.
---
I think the highest raid DPS recorded in classic was a gnome fury warrior with 2 swords. So yeah...
---
Couldn't find any but I wouldn't take everything on Classic WoWhead as fact either, there are inconsistencies and lack of data all over that site. Like drop rates for items are mostly missing or inaccurate.
---
ok
---
Because retail has class balancing and it's no fun at all
---
lmao, I thought that particular brand of bullshit looked familiar.
---
His old account looks extremely mentally stable too.
---
Congrats guys.  Well campaigned, great result.
---
Now we need RP-PVP!
---
Bros... still undecided between Night Elf and Tauren Druid.
---
Also on professions.
---
Man I was on Dunemaul and Crusridge was on our crossrealm BG's. You guys were a pain in the ass.
---
Dwarf Male
---
It's actually a "how good is your tank at generating threat" test. Since healers have infinite mana they can spam max ranks on the tank the entire fight so there's no excuse for not gearing for maximum threat on that fight.
---
Some people see min/maxers as some dreading issue and i dont really see why. As a min/max player i can clearly say that min/maxers (on average) dont really care what happens outside of their raid.   
---
Thats why all this "Will be be ok if i play ..." posts look really strange. Im surprised how much of a discussion it is on this subreddit. Does people nowdays get kicked from stratholme for not being mage or human rogue/warrior?  
---
No, you wont be in a min/max guild as cat or owl, and even if, for any reason, min/max guild wants to have "meme spec", most of time we have our own geared player who is happy to respec and fill that spot. But as a "non-optimized" character will you want to join a min/max guild? Clearly no. It wont be effective for us and wont be fun for you (i expect it to be pretty stressful). We just have different goals and views on raiding, and we dont hurt each other in any way. And im actually pretty happy to see boomkins or retri palas here and there, like in some random 5-ppl dungeons if im pugging. Moreso if they know what they are doing.  
---
Also min/maxers are minority, but i would suggest to stay out of "top" realm because there will be a lot of competing min/maxing guilds and as a person with non-optimized character you want to have as many non-"elite" guilds on your realm as possible.  
---
But there is also something for people that are willing to raid as a hybrid (as an example). Im not aware of any guild being able to constantly clear actual content with something like 3 cats, 2 ele shamans, 7 hunters and 2 owls. Ofc there are a lot of really good guilds that utilise feral, deep shadow priest or elemental shaman, but their raid is still made of characters with "proper" specs by like 85%.   
---
So when it comes to weekly raiding as "non-optimized" character expect competition to be much more dire than your average pre-raid bis frost mage.
---
NOW CONFIRM RP-PVPER SERVERS
---
Thank you blizzard !!
---
Mobs on the beta have some crazy leeway that makes any kind of mob kiting completely impossible. 
---
And yup this wasn't in 1.12.1
---
&gt; People like to say BWL is the same as MC and is a cakewalk 
---
Those people are idiots. They clearly never raided in Vanilla, be it in the old days or on private servers.
---
Guilds that won't min-max at least a bit (consumables and at least a core of proper DPS classes) will NOT going to go past Razorgore. And by some miracle they do, Vael is the end of their raiding experience.
---
BWL and MC are not even close to be the same.
---
If a guild is going into raiding with the mentality that "it's easy" because they somehow managed to clear MC with feral druids, ret paladins or whatever, and didn't used consumables very often...they are in for a rude awakening in BWL.
---
yeah, but in classic we will be playing 1.12, not 1.8.
---
Okay, thanks for the info. Really appreciate it ^^
---
Hi some people. Careful using we as if you are the representative of all rpers. If you're not IC for leveling, questing, or content clearing you're only doing organized events mostly which is a really small % of the gametime. I'd encourage you to let it happen organically instead of scripting. I'd also recommend finding a good balance between being a snowflake and being a peasant.
---
I disagree. Every class in vanilla has stuff they're good at and balancing almost always ends up hurting a different class when the totem pole shifts. The constant bouncing around is not fun, and I think a lot of people are looking forward to vanilla when they can choose a class and know what their strengths and weaknesses are ahead of time
---
I would like to add to the other that so much people outside english speaking country don't know about reddit at all. In France for exemple it's just unknow (hey english is not our speciality, we suck a it !) I'm sure it the same for most EU country.
---
WE WON 
---
YESSS
---
Very interesting. I want to look into this a little bit more, that sounds fun. Thanks for the response!
---
This takes me back holy f...
---
I started in 04 on a PvP server with friends, and we watched each others back while grouping.  Since it was early in the game there were no bored lvl 60's ganking lvl 20's and any opposing faction that came across our group quite quickly decided they had somewhere else to be.  Not many people try and take on a group of 4 that had a Mage, Priest, Hunter, and Warrior.   However, when the group began to dwindle and I found myself playing solo, or alts, then I spent more time corpse walking than anything else.  After a few years of that, I switched to PvE and never looked back.
---
\&gt; Whats it like to play on a PVE server
---
Quiet.   The only threat to you is mob aggro both while fighting and while walking by, you can focus entirely on mob patrols and pathing, gathering, and keeping an eye out for rare's and elites.  Watching a movie or listening to music is common because you don't need to keep focused for that "rogue stealth" sound, or keeping your head on swivel for enemies.
---
\&gt; How does PvP work. 
---
You have the option to flag yourself, meaning you open yourself for PvP attacks.  While now this allows any opposing faction to attack you (flagging themselves in the process) and fighting.   Any person not flagged that attacks a flagged person, or heals/buffs a flagged person will also become flagged for PvP.   This flag remains active until turned off, or if already defaulted to off, 5 minute timer elapses.  
---
\&gt;  How satisfying is the leveling experience without pvp? 
---
I find the leveling experience is what you make of it.  Some people say its easier, some say its boring without a threat of death constantly.   The only thing I can say is its the same as leveling on a PvP server (quest wise) without the fear of being attacked by someone while you are low on health engaged with another mob, or one shotted by someone 20+ levels higher thats bored.  I like it because I can focus on the quest alone, without being interrupted by a PvP battle.
---
\&gt;  How often do you encounter open world pvp? 
---
If you don't flag yourself, it'll be rare to be part of PvP.  There are a few areas where its common (Southshore/Tarren Mill, STV, Barrens) but for the most part, you can go a dozen levels without seeing one flagged enemy.
---
\&gt;  **Those of you who have played on PVE and PVP servers. Which one did you enjoy more and why?** 
---
Depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want to go pick a fight with someone, then I go on a PvP server, other times I just want to chill and gain a few levels in peace, and thats where PvE comes in.  Overall, I prefer PvE.
---
truth, but at some point (providing people play that long)- everyone will have it within a raid/guild. Where it then becomes a throwaway item, unless it's given to anyone (like say hunters)
---
Actually he's right. Class balance is a concept that led to the state of retail now. You're the guy making weak arguments and slinging feces here.
---
Oh, now I get your point. Alright.
---
I'm french and i agree
---
No, whether youre try hard is based on your decision process. Being a human isnt try hard. Picking a human because you like their armor isnt try hard. Picking a human because you like how they look and the racials are nice isnt try hard. Liking dwarves but picking a human because you think the racials are better and youll therefore be better is try hard. 
---
Whether youre a try hard is based on the decision making process. 
---
Calling it minmaxing is less salty.
---
It's pretty clear what I'm saying. Large scale PvP in active areas still causes problems. The stress test had more than one server and with more than one layer per server.  The beta has an extremely small population compared to what is realistic for most servers and layers the first few months of WoW Classic.
---
That said server performance is by no means poor, it's significantly better than retail's performance. I'm just refuting what Sinical said with my own experience and input.
---
I know about nightfall, but I'm contemplating potential : )
---
Herligt!
---
I know more people who are actively friends with people they met online, then people who are actively friends with people they met in the military.
---
You couldn't just post that in the official 'What Should I Play Wednesdays (July 03, 2019)' thread?
---
You forgot the most important improvement, people will have more than 0.3 fps.
---
In all guilds I was in we had more problems on Razorgore (organisation/shitty hunters) or Broodlord (undergeared tanks). For Vael you just need a tank that doesn't click his abilities and dps to have KTM installed.
---
Guild List Updated
---
Nightfall is your potential. Or one of the dozens of shadowstrikes being vendored.
---
Am German, and as much as I hate to say it, the French are seriously badass except for **one** incident. Italians on the other hand have proven to be... unreliable allies ;)
---
yep.  same people who undercut prices down to nothing because it'll sell faster.
---
the people who continue to make obviously stupid choices even after you explain why they're being stupid.
---
Depends what you wanna do.
---
Im rolling Druid cuz i want to tank for my buddies in dungeons and maybe offtank in raids.
---
Because of this alliance is actually better for me cuz of Dward priests having fearward and paladin buffs&gt;Shaman Totems.
---
But mostly the suggestion is, you wanna do pvp on your druid=Tauren
---
You want to pve=NE.
---
Professions for me are gonna be alcy to provide lower costs for my raid consumables, for pvp again enginering is a solid choice.
---
Go pop open the compiler and find it. Why do you think Blizzard is in the background randomly coding shit like this into the beta client?
---
If I'm not mistaken 1.8 is actually 1.08 relative to 1.12
---
Yes, we'll be playing 1.12, which came after 1.8, meaning all the changes from 1.8 will be in Classic.
---
If you're in a melee group, then yes, if you aren't in a melee group, then no.
---
Any raid group worth their salt put their resto shamans in the melee groups though, so there really is no point in bringing elemental shamans to begin with, as long as you can find at least 4 resto shamans, ideally 5-6.
---
Even enhancement shamans would be taken over elementals, because at least they can be nightfall bots.
---
That is hillarious. I might borrow that.
---
What ?? Why and you all assuming they dont have a job? And that the cost of Wow is somehow comparable to higher education?
---
Yeah, it sucks and I don't like it but it's a good game anyway. I'm just hoping they release more content where they balance classes and specs or give us TBC which has more balance. Too early to think about adding new content though, so for now I'm just sucking it up.
---
Similarly, the AQ Commendation turn in NPCs are in the cities (at least on the first stress test) It makes no sense for them to be in the game until the AQ patch.
---
Also every class is exactly the same with different names for abilities and animations.
---
It's not a problem. Pretty much the entire rest of europe speaks english just fine. It's only the large countries that are stubborn enough not to learn and speak english, because their country is big enough to get away with it.
---
Even a single second matters to min-maxers, otherwise you wouldn't call them min-maxers.  
---
Your story is a good example of how anyone can choose to become a guild and raid leader to play the game in the way they want to play. That TBC leader wanted to maximize his personal DPS to the detriment of the overall raid and everybody in that raid was ok with it, completely fine. Just not in my min-max raids.
---
Well it does have a bearing, because the min-maxers aren't holding everyone else back.
---
I think I need to do exactly that.
---
&gt; I don’t understand this mentality, why wouldn’t you want to keep improving 
---
This is the mentality that exists now. It will change once Classic is live, and MOST guilds won't go past MC unless they change their mentality. I say most guilds, because most guilds will be casual, since most players will be casual players.
---
And they WILL change it, unless they don't want to see their raiders leaving for another guilds.
---
The MOMENT a guild steps in BWL, and realize that Razorgore is 10 times harder than Ragnaros, it will have 3 choices : disband, stay in MC forever or change their mentality in order to progress in BWL.
---
Mate, the world record of 4 days 20 hours is PLAYED time. That takes way more than Monday-Thursday and till 8PM on Friday. No one can play that long, you would die without any sleep for 5 whole days.
---
On retail you can just LFR and you need not min-max. What is your point?
---
I wouldn't be so sure. National realms are NOT for everybody. There will be plenty of germans who don't mind speaking english playing on english realms.
---
Agréable
---
Yeah I don't actually plan on doing much endgame raiding. Just gonna chill out in dungeons and maybe a little bit of pugging.
---
That can't be right. Blizzard has said that layering is continent wide. Nowhere have they said that each zone is further split, so unless you have any credible source you're wrong.
---
Not true, some specs lose gainst almost all other specs.
---
Is it though?
---
Never said that but ok buddy
---
I never said I would never work but ok buddy (check edit)
---
**Shamans** are not common, don't worry, that's beta inflation. They are the least played class in the horde, and are hard as fuck to manage, totems are not so simple.  
---
**Paladins** are not common as well, and even with spelladin you will still heal. They are the best aoe tanks in game if played correctly.  
---
**Druid** can be played as main tanks but be ready to cleanse/heal at any time you are not tanking. They have the highest threat ceiling in the game, no wonder why the guild with the fastest naxx in game was using 2 druid bear tanks. This class is a true hybrid, if you learn the ways of true hybrid you good to go.  
---
**Hunters** are tranq shot bots. Believe me, if they didn't have tranq shots they wouldn't raid lol
---
I mean i haven't ever really gotten the "i need to top the dps meters" because what really matters is clearing the dungeon or raid.
---
I'm genuinely surprised by the fact that Spanish isn't one of them. They have a huge playerbase in WoW.
---
I fully admit I just wrote this to pass along 20 minutes waiting for classic launch.
---
Am I right ? Like wtf
---
Who gives a flower
---
I know you're exaggerating, but I have seen more of the former than the latter. Sensible people say "play however you want" speaking to both sides, minmaxers and non-minmaxers, people who follow the private server meta and those who don't. The point is to let people have their fun their way and make their own decisions about shit organically instead of trying to sway people one way or the other.
---
\^
---
For all those who are quick to comment on anyone who repeatedly posts about issues like this, layering, etc., understand it's actually productive and everyone ones wins in the end.
---
Remember: It took a petition to get classic. What will it take to get it right? . . . people speaking up!
---
I do agree I switched to a more casual guild where we said you play the char you want to play.  
---
Hell we had a 0:51:0 holy priest in my guild.  And I. Experimented some more with 31 shadow 20 holy build earlier when levelling. It worked fine to.  
---
I bet unless your bleeding edge hardcore raider you can play what you want and have a load of fun.  
---
Well unless your a fire mage wanting to raid until we get another raid other then MC and BWL 
---
Sure weaponskill for melee characters means they have a easier time gearing but it’s not critical to be a good rogue.
---
What a great news for me, when they told us there would be no french and german realm, I felt a little scared. I'm so happy right now.
---
Not arguing there. Just trying to point out a way to remember feet in a mile.
---
locks are mushrooms confirmed.
---
It never does though. I don't think you understand how exceedingly rare it is to get thunderfury.
---
Bien
---
Server merges suck big time, economy messed up, people forced to change name, it wasn't pretty.
---
If they can avoid it I'd like that.
---
Yes you won a further split of the population and in 2 months you\`ll be playing with 5 other people. Grats. You did it boyo.
---
Okay, assuming all WoWhead comments are wrong. What about the rest ?
---
This is a cosplayers heaven.
---
I never said it didn't. But when you have 5000 people there, layering will be needed. Not so much later on.
---
Who is going to chose to play fire mage in raid? Our tanking on paladin etc? That’s the problem, people just won’t play it and that makes the game worse IMO
---
Thinking that the only way to have a balanced game is to have retail with no other way is just silly.
---
Thank you Mr. Blizzard.
---
Going to be there to Stresstest the German servers to show my support.
---
Erstklassiger Stoff
---
Mage.
---
Personally, I wouldn't get hung up on the whole AOE farming meme. As several ppl have commented, unless you're pushing server first 60, there will be so many others trying to AOE farm (or just mess with your attempt) that it'll be neigh on impossible. AOE farming Dire Maul East might be a thing though at 60.
---
Two thing swung it for me (was between Mage, priest, &amp; lock); firstly, unlike retail, in Classic you're a mage, not a fire mage / frost mage / arcane mage. Even if you go heavy into the fire tree, you still have frostbolt, cone of cold, frost nova, sheep, for the cc/slows. The fire tree also gives you blast wave with a 6s daze. I wasn't entirely up for fire because of the rng on crits.
---
The final confirmation was watching fruitnut's dps videos on YouTube. He's done a back-to-back patchwork dps comparison geared at pre-raid (dungeon gear), post-BWL, and full-BIS. The pre-raid fire mage does way more dps than BIS frost mage, near-as-dammit the same as the BIS fury warrior &amp; BIS combat rogue, and twice that of BIS warlock. Even allowing for the fact this was on a pserver, no fight is pure patchwork, etc, etc, it's a pretty compelling relative weighting guide. I'm very unlikely to have the time to raid Naxx, but even as mid-ability, pre-BWL geared mage; I'll be able to dish out the dps! 
---
Yes, I'll have to re-spec if I get into MC/BWL raiding (or try AOE DME), but that's quite a few months down the line.
---
My problem is:  I am from Canada and now live in Germany. I can speak German no problem but would rather play in English. I have to wonder now how the English European servers will be now... they will still be booming and healthy I hope? 
---
Anyone have any idea?
---
Hi 'from Canada and now live in Germany', im DAD.
---
Arguably moreso.
---
There is certainly an argument to be made on weather or not this mechanic should exist or if the range should be shortened today, but yes there are people pretending this was never in the code at all. They got tinfoil hats on thinking Blizz is in the background coding this into the beta client because... reasons?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c88xci/to_all_of_those_who_claim_melee_leeway_was_in/
---
You'll probably want to be in cat form the vast majority of the time as soon as you get it. It is just simply higher dps/faster TTK. The only times I used bear was for difficult mobs or AOE pulls if I was over leveled. 
---
The only finisher you will use is FB... but even that is pretty meh. Vast majority of your dps will come from auto-attack and claw. Another reason why FF is so important.
---
Only thing I want for classic realms  is  opportunity to choose where to play. If you  don't know English language and don't want to learn it - you choose realms with your  regional language.If you want to play with players from other countries and ready to speak on English - you choose  EU English language realm.
---
Nett
---
Well to be honest the only real downside with shamans, which is the class I'm leaning towards, is their popularity.
---
I am more than prepared to heal when needed, if it wasn't obvious I don't intend to do any endgame raiding to speak of anyway.
---
My primary spec as shaman would be an enhancement tanking spec.
---
ooh, alright.
---
Thanks so much for this. 
---
Still wondering about the dmg though. I've seen hunters get 1k single target with a TF / BM specc alone. Just wondering how that'd be with a Maelstrom trinket + Hand of Justice
---
No, starting zones will still be insanely crowded.
---
Every layer hold a realm population. So you'll have 500 people per starting zone at launch.
---
You just won't have that AND 4 hours queues
---
I don't think most people played with single digit fps though I may be wrong about that. WoW was triumphed at the time for running on the most dog shit of pc's decently well. EQ2 on the otherhand required me to upgrade to a 6800 GT which I played before wow.  
---
Our biggest problem when we got to BWL was the server lag that occurred. It was terrible and made vael and razorgore extremely difficult though we managed to kill them eventually despite it lagging like fuck. Once the server was no longer a lag monster (which took a few weeks) we breezed through bwl fairly easily.
---
Il n'a pas bien écrit ta belle langue. Quel horreur, insupportable !
---
You sound like someone who has never played a hunter in vanilla.
---
I know it's rare. I played in vanilla. I'm still wondering about potential.
---
I'm not min-maxing because it's *necessary*, I'm doing it because it's *fun*. ^^^to ^^^be ^^^at ^^^the ^^^top ^^^of ^^^the ^^^damage ^^^meter
---
Well to each their own! I think it is pretty sad personally as the game is coming out with limited content and people want to rush through the first chunk inside a week.
---
for what was it used? Didn't they have a dev environment?
---
There's no Canada like French Canada, it's the best Canada in the land!
---
&gt; It makes no sense for them to be in the game until the AQ patch.
---
From a development point of view it kind of does. The goal is probably "remove the bare minimum to make the phases thing work, keep everything else". So after they went through the list of quests, loot tables, and vendors and flagged which ones should be turned off until X Phase, they realized they had no reason to go through the list of NPCs and do the same, which would have been considerably more difficult in any case.
---
Imagine caring about minmaxing pve.
---
The content is easy, you don't need or even want to be this serious about vanilla raiding. Vanilla raiding is balanced by the fact that you need all kinds of utility and it takes forever to gear people so you can't just run 30 warriors. 
---
Besides when the fuck was raiding ever balanced? I've played TBC and wrath Pservers and the raid balancing both in raid spots and dps was actually worse than what I'm used to on pservers.
---
Warlock.  I’ve decided... for now. Now....gnome or undead? Gnomes are rad, but I’ve heard cannibalize creates endless killing. I’ve also heard it’s forgettable. 
---
Then, tailoring or engineering??? I’ve read pluses for both. Specifically some BiS warlock items that are specifically related to tailoring.
---
Maybe I can slow some trash too :&lt;
---
Polls are skewed they never hold any water. Silver Hand launched less than 2 weeks ago and its nothing but LF1M NEED TANK, keep in mind loads of people will vote in polls of what they want to play others will lie. At the end of the day you will want 4+ shamans in raid. You will want 2 per WSG 3 per AB 8 per AV. They are a great class and people enjoy them for all aspects of the game. Leveling they are decent, pvp they are strong and dueling elemental shamans can ruin people.
---
"You pull it, you tank it"
---
They'll learn.
---
I feel like meme spec is nicer than calling them bad specs lol
---
No we are, it starts around 6 yo nowadays (at least my little sister is), the probleme is that i probably learned more of my english from tv shows/speaking through the internet/movies/reading than i did when i went to school. Most of the older generations doesn't speak english because they didn't need it, now it gets slowly better but yeah it's still crap for now.
---
Do you want authentic experience or good experience?
---
Having problems with picking mage, lock, or rogue for PvP and raiding ;(
---
Everquest tlps can be fun.  Try mangler for now--slow unlocks and I think it's in kunark right now.  Epic quests and the new kunark archaeologist quests keep even the casual player very busy.  As long as sky is off rotation raiding is quick and enjoyable during the era.  The agents of change added from phinigel onward provides raid instances while pickzones allow for multiple copies of a zone once a player threshold has been hit.  Makes for a more enjoyable experience for those of us with limited playtime these days.
---
You know you can! 
---
Use that crazy range!
---
People know that. You're not offering some kind of profound revelation that nobody ever thought of before. However, if someone applies to a guild or asks to join an open raid and all the leader really knows about them is that they chose the worst spec for their class, it just makes more sense to pick the applicant who has instead chosen to arrive in their strongest spec. 
---
There's a higher chance that the min-max player is more concerned with their own performance. They'll perform better even if they aren't a better player. No raid guild has any real incentive to recruit a ret paladin or balance druid or whatever. Even when a piece of gear drops for the odd specs once a month, someone will usually want it for PvP so loot isn't typically wasted just because nobody raids in that spec.
---
It's like a job interview--that guy who's got "self-taught" on his resumé could very well be good enough to do the job, but the employer is always going to pick the guy with the actual education. Noone has any obligation to cater to people who voluntarily choose a weak spec. 
---
In most cases, if a veteran member of a guild suddenly wants to play a moonkin after having contributed for a long time as resto, they get to do it. But why should they recruit a stranger who puts in an application that offers less than the others in line?
---
Yeah I know that Ele especially a 30/0/21 build is best for bgs because You can stand behind and deliver massive chain lightning crits but...! I want that rng. i want to die and be kited i dont want to have it easy. And when I catch up to a cloth wearer and get a wf proc i want to delete them from the face of the map. I will play with engineering to help myself with trinkets and nades. And if I get bored or smashed too hard I can always respec. Thats the fun part about playing a hybrid class. You have to take into concideration that there are other classes that can do your job better but you can do everything with one hero. And this time around thats what ill do.
---
French are starting slowly to get good as well, just takes a ton of time, and most of the older generations didn't even need english at the time so they didn't bother to learn it. Nowadays it's a must have so it's getting better.
---
Not sure what you're referencing, but I cant make sense of what you posted here
---
People way underrate what a shaman does. Even more so early on. Your tank doesn't have thunderfury, threat is an issue. I think a lot of raiders are used to alliance. As long as your raid isn't already 7 shamans deep you add a nice bit (unless your raid also has 2 groups of hunters/druids). Tranq air totem alone is  about equal to ~wf for casters early on and while they put a resto with casters (i think locks are the exception early) before an ele/enh that means a melee group is now open. 
---
Even adding 5-10% per group member is enough to get you a bit under pure dps.
---
And another one to become a spanish colony too!
---
Wasn't it just a bug the first month or so? 
---
I highly doubt that it will be in classic.
---
That was fixxed around AQ if i remember right
---
Execute spam with infinite rage works wonders
---
Was that armor ever in the game btw lol
---
Literally the only reason for fruit vendors to exist in wow - to buy food for your gorilla.
---
Blocked attacks have a zero percent chance to crit.
---
Depends on what you want to accomplish for the DPS part, do you want to pve or pvp as offspec? Most guilds will accept 1 SPriest per raid so if you secure that spot early once you get more gear and progress in BWL you can turn on Anathema and do decently but your job is utility, you bump up locks dps which is the whole point. And as for duels, SP may be the strongest 1v1 class in the game with proper gear, i think only SL lock can really pressure that class and not even that well if both evenly geared.
---
Not necessary to complete them, true. However, vanilla is not as easy as some people are making out. If your guild is made up of pvp and meme specs you are going to really struggle clearing all raids in a timely fashion once the phases roll on. Especially if people are turning up without or with minimal buffs.
---
It's a lot of lockouts to get through if you are taking a whole night to do MC or BWL. Most people will want raids to be cleared as fast as possible so they can clear 2 a night and retain some semblance of a life outside of Azeroth, or perhaps pvp or run back and forth between ah and bank.
---
Karma hunting post, nobody thinks this and you’re typing like hardcore guilds only do raids with 35 fury war(best dps class) and 5 healers? Everyone knows that wont happen. Every raid will have hunters pallies druids(not always druid), mages warlocks etc.
---
Just use glyph of mend p-...
---
Thinking you can do better than a whole design team is hubris. They tried to create a balanced game in retail. Learn from the past or you're doomed to repeat it.
---
Same, I get really annoyed with all this "Moonkins, Rets and Ferals are gash" attitude. Unless you were in server top guilds, nobody gave a shit in vanilla, same with clothadins, its a bleed over from retail culture onto private servers, and its the one thing I feel could ruin Classic.
---
Well, if you hit 60 in weeks then that's probably 10 hours a day. I don't think that's casual for anybody lol
---
Classic is the time when you can make new friends!!!!
---
Melee leeway was implemented because netcode sucked, now it's fine and it's not needed.
---
Ok mum :(
---
He defend, he attack, but in dungeons he'll get feared and pull another pack
---
Female Orc laugh is the stuff of nightmares.
---
"DPS refrains from attacking", yep you lost me there. I need to dominate the Damage meter dude. 
---
God I will miss trick of the trade :-(
---
Yeah so I've heard. Every spec I want to play sucks unfortunately, oh well
---
I pick huge queues.
---
And no, dead servers is not the guaranteed alternative to layering.  Vanilla wow thrived originally and on private servers without layering.  Classic will be fine.
---
Most people won't be anywhere close to 60 after a month.
---
The total French playerbase across non-RP-PVP realms (~8.7%) is twice as large as the total RP-PVP players across all of Europe (~4.1%).
---
The decision to not give Italy their own server(s) is still telling that RP-PVP won't happen, as they have a similar number of active players on their realms as the total of the English RP-PVP realms.
---
Still, I'm afraid of what will happen when Classic launches. The spanish community will choose a server to roll on. Spanish people will speak spanish in tradechat. English people will start saying "fucking mexicans", "learn english u fookin spic", etc...
---
It's this post again.
---
Yeah, but names are reserved for 90 days after deletion, so you can't create a name on a server, then delete that character to use that name on your "main" account. 
---
So yeah, you could get 6+ names but they would still be stuck on their respective account.
---
More likely they will go to the English servers and form a community there.
---
As a priest your most used spell in a BG will be dispel. Downranking only works when you have a load of +healing, something your PVP isn't likely to have. I can't remember the break points but you can experiment [here](https://wow-downranking.herokuapp.com/#). 
---
PW:Shields are ok as they're instant and will probably break before the enemy priest dispels it.
---
What did you have to delete to get a 3.5GB of free space OP
---
It's that post again.
---
My point is that meme-spec implies it's a deliberate joke.
---
Champagne ! On va pouvoir faire des ref à Kaamelott dans le chat des Tarides !
---
I can only give my Druid perspective.  I down rank heals a lot in PvP but mostly between engagements to top people up efficiently.  You're not going to save someone being ganked by a rogue by spamming Rank 4 Healing Touch.  The ranks I use are the same as PvE because my goal is to be as mana efficient as possible while there's no pressure being applied to you or your team.
---
Years into Classic, the more raids that are released, the less you'll likely down rank.  By late BWL/Naxx people are going to be two shotting each other so you're going to be using max rank nearly always.
---
I also think they greatly overestimate the value of Devilsaurs. Classic will not be filled with tryhards who go above and beyond for every fraction of dps increase. High level blues are enough to start raiding, come without charge and feel more rewarding when dropped and not bought. I would rather pay the iron price.
---
No, you aren't understanding.  With layering they will increase the population cap on the server so there aren't queues.  The whole point of layering is to handle the initial surge of players and allow for a healthy population once that surge of players ends.  Each layer will still be crowded, just like on the stress test.
---
I raided hogger at level 5 on the stress test and I can assure you the spirit healer is in Westfall. Pretty much dead in the middle of the zone. Not far at all.
---
If you get a rare make sure you hearth and get food immediately or bring the proper food with you
---
They can do whatever the fuck they want, just not in my raid
---
Well your class balance idea is very much a retail concept. He isnt acually name calling. You're using strawman to replace citing facts while he is pointing to a catastrophy your path of balance leads to.
---
Go both? Level speeds are similar and both can make money their own way at 60. As for raids Warlocks would be sought after for Garr and their utility. Mages are just safer and the reason a lot of people play them. Talents wise Mages win, locks don't become a threat on DPS til ZG hit gear and if you are good dps on lock you are riding the Threat line threshold.
---
I prefer the community on pve servers by a margin, but I have to go pvp if I want those epic raid vs raid fights over the world bosses. Worth it.
---
Well yeah, they kinda are a joke, don't know about the deliberate part though.
---
Still better than calling them bad, they are just the silly specs you play for fun instead of progression
---
They can always levels alts afterwards and play with more casual friends or whatever later.
---
It's literally a once in a lifetime opportunity to go for this specific goal.  It doesn't take a huge amount of skill, but it takes a huge amount of knowledge and dedication and commitment by many people.  Don't be sad for them, they will remember this experience for the rest of their lives.
---
thank you for finally making sense
---
Or rather don't want to play on national realms. Like me. English only or bust.
---
I guess you didn't expect the spanish inquisition
---
Thanks for the research!   
---
I appreciate your effort.
---
more utility with a hunter. You're gonna pvp as well you know ; )
---
My opinion though. 
---
But I like to switch it up. So- IF the potential is there to acquire what I see potential in. That potential will be utilized.
---
That is your prerogative my man
---
To any Linux device. Including a hacked switch.
---
Source: did exactly that and played wow on my switch the other day.
---
Ces gens fous l'ont fait !
---
Okay boomer.
---
Or your population is not big enough to fill an entire server alone?
---
Same for me, just regarding feral dps druid :)
---
There's the truth about it
---
&lt;Insert overused wall joke here&gt;
---
It looks a lot like the alliance hunter blue pvp gear. Not the exact match but very similar. it could have been the concept art for that.
---
We need to post on their forums weekly if not daily asking for the servers, and we need those posts to get lots of attention.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSXBuTE6khTWi5qoT8F64T9IriJuTPNDPJA9c8Xk7qo/mobilebasic
---
I feel like these notes are incomplete, but under patch 1.5, you'll see where the lava splashes during the rag fight were nerfed.  Also, under 1.6.1, you'll see where loot tables for all MC bosses changed to allow better loot to drop more often.
---
He has a life, no time to reply to threads
---
I've been really surprised that this isn't being talked about more. Isn't there only 3 hours between server name release and name reservations? That's not going to work for a great many people. Give us at least a few days to get organized.
---
Yeah I ever say don't play X meme spec but I do warn new players what life at 60 will be like for said spec.
---
We don't hate T\_T we just like our language and the comfort of not speaking english lol.
---
Spoken like a true Enhancement :’)
---
At least one for Australia.
---
Half as much dps if your very good.
---
Most meme specs will dps less than the tank
---
I know.... studying them classic skills costs alot of gold. This is why you gotta bypass some skills.
---
Now we just want the layering to be city based please . I fkn refuse to play with people from copenhagen or gothenburg. I can only play with people who understand the real stockholm culture. But blizz wont lissen as always. Game ruined.
---
Highly inaccurate to use a map of the general populations knowledge of english. The only thing this map shows is how long ago it their school system started teaching it, it does not show the actual english capabilities of the countries in age 18-30.
---
&gt; Thus I am so sad that they didn't went with the 2.0 talent trees.
---
What? WoW is never more unbalanced and ridiculous than in the pre-patch for the next expansion. With 2.0 talents, it wouldn't be vanilla at all. The entire game would be totally changed and all the content would be utterly trivial, unless Blizzard also went around redesigning absolutely everything in the game. How could you possibly have expected that?
---
I would go in there expecting to find a staff vendor. It would be a bonus if they sold other types of weapons, and also a little annoying if staves were not featured in some way.
---
lol I remember the billions of disclaimers that this game is online and requires a membership, it was such an unknown notion back then.
---
I know that feel. It's changing daily
---
Come on, come on!!!
---
I'm personally okay with not sitting in a login queue, but that is just me.
---
&gt; Whats it like to play on a PVE server?
---
Well, ok I guess. I personally prefer helping people instead on jumping on them when they are low on health, so I quite enjoy helping a struggling player even if they are Alliance.
---
&gt; How does pvp work?
---
By manual flagging, attacking other faction NPCs, being seen by a guard or entering other faction main cities.
---
&gt; How satisfying is the leveling experience without pvp?
---
Good enough, quite chill and enjoyable. I even did some elite quests with players from the opposite faction. We communicated through emotes and pulled by turn so everyone got credit.
---
&gt; How often do you encounter open world pvp?
---
Quite often. I've seen lots of players manually flagging themselves or trying to grief other players by killing quest escort NPCs or destroying Crossroads and so on. Sometimes a flagged player with friends tried to flag me when I was using my AoE skills. Sometimes we were sitting in Ironforge or Stormwind and provoked other players to attack us. It was quite often, but not so often as on PvP realms, as one might guess. Depends on a realm population, mine was bursting with activity back then. Now it's desolated.
---
&gt; Those of you who have played on PVE and PVP servers. Which one did you enjoy more and why?
---
PVE. I don't like being forced to take part in an activity when I'm not in the mood. I enjoy PvP, but only when it's my own choice. I prefer to be in control of my time and my actions.
---
And Greekjuros 2.0
---
Literally the same debate, except I prefer female orcs to male, and am still considering other classes. 
---
Currently trying nelf and, while I love playing my favorite race aesthetics wise, I miss the horde feeling of brotherhood. Playing ally feels a bit alienating from the rest of the players, hordes feel closer. Maybe it's just placebo.
---
It's one thing outsourcing your servers to randoms and having your own in-house ones. Hence name "cloud". You idiot.
---
Okay thanks for explaining man. I’m still not seeing where our misunderstanding is coming from though - with layering blizzard needs less realms at launch right? Without layering, they would potentially need to create more permanent realms to prevent over crowding, right? So doesn’t that mean there will be less realms to reserve names on because of layering?
---
Maybe. But I'm simply referring to a I a lore/immersion perspective.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one with the retad hate!
---
Oh it's nothing so special. People like to RP; People like to PvP; people like to RP while they PvP. RP realms have special rules that encourage immersive RP, so people like to roll their. PvP realms have special rules that encourage immersive PvP, so people like to roll there. People want to play on both, but without RP-PvP they are mutually exclusive and you would be forced to pick one or the other.
---
Thats all contextual.
---
Consider things like ammo, reagents, pet food, travel times, inability to solo many quests. I've literally heard many people who never played pre-Cata say that it sounds terrible. To them it sounds excessive, and unnecessarily annoying.
---
It's all relative. EQ was extremely immersive and social due to all of those things coming together and creating the game that it was.
---
“feature”
---
"Hell is other French people" /Sartre
---
You need to go and take a look at Vanilla Players private server rankings. The 'hybrid tax' is nowhere near that high. It can vary from 50-70% of a main DPS class, depending on the specs in question.
---
I think he's just saying try not to be an ass when you warn noobs about the perils of meme specs
---
I did an internship in Belgium 2010. Met probably hundreds of people who applied for jobs in management/marketing/HR jobs. About 50/50 native french speakers and native dutch (Flemish) speakers. I remember meeting maybe 1-2 native french speakers who weren't utterly crap in English and in the opposite side maybe 1-2 dutch speakers who weren't good in English.
---
Don't think that was ever the case. You have a battlegroup and can be put with anyone in the battlegroup both as friend or enemy. People on discord are talking about how annoying it was when your battlegroup included other language servers.
---
Thank you
---
Never tried PVE but i have friends who did, they all quit for different reasons. But i know i would get bored out of my mind playing a "non dangerous" game. As many have stated in the thread, if i find resources i want to fight over it, world boss fights, 40 man running to raid, the absolut chaos that can happen at any point and the constant danger is what creates good communitys. Wow is all about connecting to people and play with community, and if there is danger, people will group up. I have this memory from pserver times when we were 4 x40 guilds on discord cordinating going to MC/BWL just to get throu the zerg and be able to raid, it was awesome.
---
I have played on both. 
---
I started at the end of vanilla on a PVE server and I did enjoy it. I was a complete mmo noob at the time and was afraid of PvP servers because I didn‘t really know what I should expect. 
---
I cleared all the content up to Sunwell Plateau albeit at a very slow pace. After I got more experienced I started to create alts on PvP servers and I noticed almost immediately that the average player there would be more competent. You didn‘t really find many keyboard turners or clickers there. You could get be with this on PvE servers but on PvP you were simply cannon fodder. 
---
I did regret choosing a PvE Server and when the option opened up transfered to a PvP one with most of my guild.
---
Hunters can still do good dps, even if they don't scale as much as mages/rogues/furies
---
Yeah that’s exactly what I think, too. NELF looks the best, has salto jump and cool cat mounts but I can’t get rid of the feeling that it feels wrong.
---
You guys are so butthurt is hilarious and sad at the same time
---
I tried RP servers early wow. Without PVP it was extremly boring to wander the world where the horde n alliance cant touch each other. I thought the idea to form huge RP battles  against each others would be cool but no one did it becouse of the /pvp barrier
---
Might not be THE reason people want rp pvp, I dont know, but it was the reason I left my 35ish lvl undead mage for good in tarren mill when I realised nobody wanted to/could start conflicts or go on "raids" against allys
---
Yeah always give a warning or explanation of what life is like at 60
---
I see, makes sense! So you can RP whilst queuing for a BG, for example? Or whatever your PvP plans are. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Good thats fixed. No one needs to switch every 1 minute or even once every 30 minutes.
---
But that's the point. They're not a joke. Most may not be raid viable, but that doesn't make them a joke.
---
I leveled as an arms warrior back in the day and outside of bosses I rarely ever used a shield. It's not needed at all 95 % of the time in pre-60 dungeons. Sweeping strikes, Whirlwind and Cleave spamming is the way to go in most cases. You'll hold agro better, clears will be way faster and while your healer might have to heal you more, the packs die so much quicker that they actually need less time for replenishing mana between pulls.
---
Did somebody call in about Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?!?
---
Countdown To Classic is back again as we inch another week closer to launch day, and we’ve got more topical issues and game related chatter for you.

Callers from far and wide hit the show up to discuss the minutiae behind using Thunderfury, a pro-world buffs reply, and Twitch sensation Dr. Lupo stops by to talk about his history with WoW and give his thoughts on how well WoW Classic and streaming will mix.
---
Then we hear from a couple of European players who have concerns over the recent news from Blizzard about EU servers, and finally, vanilla dungeon designer John Staats is back again to discuss the making of Wailing Caverns.

Cheers,

---
Note - I realise that just now Blizzard has released some news on the EU server issue that is a bit of a backflip on that issue, but the call on that topic still has great chat about why language specific servers are important to EU players.  Happy for the French and German players :)
---
People in quebec and parts of the Caribbean speak french so theres still that.
---
Maybe because.... they play on the French servers? Also, most french players on private servers keep to themselves... something something EU hating on French something...
---
Josh what are your plans for this podcast whenever Classic finally drops? Because there will no longer be a countdown to classic lol! Keep up the great work man.
---
I bet saying that made you feel better.
---
Well I find them amusing, I guess different people have different senses of humor
---
What about English servers?
---
Clears it up, thank you! :)
---
An AQ40 geared elemental shaman does around 600-700 DPS depending on the fight (source: played one), sometimes it spikes as high as 1000 DPS, other times it can dip to around 450-500 DPS, but usually it is around the 600-700 mark if you play properly and bring the correct consumes.
---
&gt; Keep on their asses about layering.
---
Has there been a change recently or have people just forgotten layering is only for the first bits at launch, it will be turned off after things settle down.
---
I have no idea, but: could it come full circle in the end? Could it be that in the extreme speed-run situation, the boss dies fast enough that the hybrid dps don't run out of mana, such that they actually have good dps on those fights?
---
If a moonkin runs out of mana in the forest but no one is there to see it, did he really run out? (It is his nature...)
---
A bakers dozen
---
Do you think you've ever run out of idioms to use when you want to say nothing?
---
Layering is there to prevent dead realms after populations stabilize. After populations stabilize, Blizzard can always bring more servers online.
---
It’s easier to add more than do catastrophic things like server mergers later. 
---
It’s really a non-issue. The number of people who need upward of 36 reserved names (an example with say 12 realms x 3 names per) is probably a very small minority. 
---
I see the point you’re trying to make, but I don’t think it works that way. We don’t know how many servers Blizzard plans to have at launch.
---
I've been playing on a pserver for some months now and I've never been bothered by a single gold seller/scammer. Is it that common on official servers?
---
That's a bummer. Spain is by far my favorite country in all of Europe. I spent about a year int total living in Cadaqués and on Mallorca and traveled all over the country. 
---
My wife is passed now, but our wedding was in Cadaqués (it was our "home base" while we traveled to 100+ countries over 3 years). We knew no one, invited no family, it was just something we wanted then and now. We went to the local parish, made a few inquiries, and by the end of the week the entire town got together and threw us the most perfect wedding. I don't think we had to cook a meal for a month because we just kept being invited into random family's homes.
---
Best people on the planet.

This is the leeway range on a pserver for a non-tauren.  If you check it against Perplexity's video at 0:55, its the same range:  Enemy running against the rock, attacker just before the road.  That doesn't mean the pserver is correct, but this isn't something that just cropped up in the beta out of nowhere.

---
Also, make a lot of noise on the forums of course. ;-)
---
&gt; so the devs may understand why I prefer hours-long queues and maybe even an inability to log in to layering.
---
well you are clearly a minority here. Why would they cater towards your needs if you're 1% of the playerbase? What business on earth would loose revenue and risk their infrastructure because some spoiled and clueless people refuse to understand how their server infrastructure or even business works?
---
I don't want to wait for ages in queues, because I now have some kind of a social life, work and other staff. I'm not 13 anymore with shitload of time. I am sorry if I prefer gameplay over login screen. Do I care if I miss some tourist players during the first 4-5 months of my game? Ofcourse I don't. The realm's identity and population won't be formed until 6-9 months into release, so it's not as bad as you're portraying it to be.
---
Crushridge and Hakkar...we should never had left. The Italian severs were an empty joke
---
I bet trashtalking someone on the internet didn't make you feel better
---
I  have no idea, but: 
---
Could it come full circle in the end? Could it be  that in the extreme speed-run situation, the boss dies fast enough that  the hybrid dps don't run out of mana, such that they actually have good  dps on those fights?
---
I learned the game on a PvP server, but my first hardcore raiding guild was on a PvE server. Although PvP is a significant part of what makes WoW so fun, there's also something nice about being able to focus on getting shit done without the problems that go along with leveling on a PvP server.
---
1. MC without hunters will be IMPOSSIBLE.. not nearly,... IIIMPOSSIBLEEE .. since u will never and I mean NEVER kill 2nd boss &gt; Dog &gt; Magma w/o a tranq shot .. well, u can but u will need to go with 30 casualties or mb 35 when u actually down him the 1st time...and this is ,again, if ur tanks r actually geared with at least 150FR :)   Then, 5men grps, if they don't like u, either they retarded or u don't know ur class...  A guild w/o at least 4 active hunters(not for raiding, like, online every raid or pvp day) will never progress MC , nor UBRS .. These trolls here have never done a single 5men or MC/BWL , trust me, as a fellow Warlock/Mage/Druid/Hunter/Rogue Raider(ye! all of em AQ40 cleaned and some of em Naxx partied..)  a good Hunter, especially in the starts of 40men Raiding will be top5 DPS ..heck! he might even be top3 on some bosses. I will give u few reasons:
---
1. max range ,no need of mana cus Autoshot does tons of dmg as well
---
2. feign dead for possible wipes, aggro or pulling
---
3. aspects that change ur party dps or resistance
---
4. UBRS last boss pulling perfectness 
---
5. frost trap for important CC and frozen trap for slowing down, delaying possible wipes and easier CC .. 
---
6. PVP rox! world pvp especially since oh man! AimShot+MultiShot..with BWL gear and u see 2-3 ppl down :D
---
7. Mining and Skinning .. best 2 profs for Hunter and lot of money
---
They are the same to me
---
Technically no cause all addons are based off the 1.12 client while Classic when it releases will be 1.13.X version so there could be something in between the porting that may cause the addon to act up.
---
Not trash talk if it is true, darling.
---
It's not fun when you're the one carrying.
---
If the feral goes afk none notices. If the try hard Mage goes afk stuff won't die.
---
I have no problems with 4 hours raids. I just don't like a 2 for raid to take 4 hours
---
Alot of hateful people here not even reading comments and assuming stupid shit....im sorry for your loss and hope it works out! See you in azeroth!

Thank you dear !

Thanks !

Yep I agree with pretty much all you said! Thanks for the long reply, I enjoyed reading it.

---
&gt;French people are often seen as those guys who refuse to speak English and will just speak french in *any* game while also being very toxic to others.
---
I know, we are bad at english  :-( so we hide behind our "pride" of our language ;-) 
---
&gt; We're also either *really* tryhard and care way too much, or crazy relaxed and go for the "iT's jUsT a GaMe bRo" mentality  
---
got it, that's quite interesting. I feel (that might be a cliché) german mentality is like that: either you're super serious about your hobby and try hard, or you just do it for the Lulz. I met a german girl who told me something about German folks that I found interesting. " It's hard to make a german friend because they may look cold and not interested. But it's just because they are very concerned about who they engage friendship with. If you manage to get their trust/sympathy, you will have a friend of a lifetime."
---
I personally think that's pretty cool !
---
&gt;Germans have a different attitude towards WoW than english folk from what I can gather and we also have a ton of weird injokes based on a handful of radio plays called Allimania and Barlows' Blogs. These are awesome and English folk won't ever get them as...Well, they're German.
---
I think France &amp; Germany are very similar about this, we had a lot of inside joke (thanks to awesome translation from blizzard too). 
---
I could survive playing on an english server, that would be good I think , but not if we have X languages on the same server. It has to be a English-ONLY server, with some kind of enforcement.
---
&gt; Another thing is that Germans seemingly are less...Streamer culture influenced. I seldomly see people reference bigger streamers, reply with "Pog" or "monkaS" in any chat in German servers whereas this is quite widespread on english and priv-I mean, undocumented servers. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer it that way.  
---
I couldn't agree more, Streamer culture was not a thing back in Vanilla, I hope it won't have too much of side effect on this occurence of WoW. We have quite a few known streamers that will play. But it's not like the US streamer culture, which is a good thing for us in Europe (imo).
---
What did nost start off with in terms of population? Also nost 1 or 2.0?
---
I hope they bend to allowing one RP-PvP server now. Not my forte but giving the roleplay community their separate niches would be welcome.
---
If that truly is the case I’m sorry for your loss.
---
1. Equip Nightfall

Based on reality and playing emulated Vanilla for over 4 years I can say you are wrong. It is in fact almost impossible for meme specs to experience end-game raiding in Vanilla. It can be done but its very unlikely that any guild will invite you.
---
Hear hear!
---
I really liked the video. But i feel like if you put a little more effort in some of the clips (more time showing how the low levels are fail or max levels are the same but in flashier enviornments) this would really be great. Looking forward to the next one.
---
Very interesting. I see the *lack of competent players* on PVE servers being brought up in this thread on multiple occasions. That's something for me to think about. Thank you!
---
The consistent message has always been that you can play whatever you want. But it doesn't mean 39 other people will accept it.
---
Has this been tried on the beta?
---
That's a proper Vanilla economy decision alright!
---
Why is this guy obsessed with soy?
---
I'm set on my main, but I want to make two alts to help with farming.
---
The first will be a lvl 35 alt with alchemy and tailoring. I want to get this one to 35 asap and then just them for the professions. What class should I pick? I'm leaning towards hunter.
---
The second will be a lvl 60 alt with mining/herbalism who's supposed to collect profession materials for gold and personal use. Mob farming capability is a ncie bonus, but not that important. I'd probably rather do that on my main. What class should I pick? I'm leaning druid here.
---
Well I'm stuck on a train, might as well write an essay on this so we get the whole discussion out of the way.
---
There are a few problems left, and they mostly come down to:
---
* Community - sadly layers are not nearly sticky enough. They cycle every session, so if you play one day and come back the next, it's very likely that you'll never have met most players before. Repeatedly seeing people while leveling over the course of multiple days is really the game's primary way of forming community bonds while leveling, both friendly and hostile ones. I really cannot stress enough how important this one is.
---
* Resource availability - the timer they added, which we still know very little about in lieu of any blue post, does _alleviate_ a single person hopping through multiple layers to easily farm materials in a single spot, but does not change the sheer amount of extra materials that will be available due to so many low levels creating more layers for the higher leveled players.
---
* PVP - A 5 minute timer is nothing when it comes to avoiding a ganker. And most hardcore guilds will hit level 60 within 2 weeks. Lots of massive 40 man guild vs guild clashes outside raids will simply not happen for the first weeks or even months.
---
* Duration - We know Blizzard would like to remove layering as soon as possible, but their stated worst case scenario of layering being in until phase 2 is just unacceptable.
---
The most common suggested solution is to simply disable layering for players above a certain level, or disable layering in all high-level zones, like level 30+ characters or zones. That is multiple days /played which for most people will mean weeks of playing. At that point you are basically guaranteed to not be a "tourist" and you should be with the main population. This prevents most of the current flaws with layering.
---
Now, whenever this solution is brought up, some people like to point out the following problems with it. I'll just list them and their very obvious answers to save everyone some time:
---
----
---
_"Layering isn't sharding. You can't just layer certain zones or certain people"._
---
Layering is basically a continent-wide shard. Blizzard have some of the most competent engineers in the gaming industry, they've brought a 12 year old game back to life to run on modern client and server architecture. We have no reason at all to believe that tweaking layering in this manner would be difficult for them.
---
_"Won't the high leveled zones be overcrowded? / If you have 5x more people, and 5x more resources, won't it even out?"_
---
Unfortunately, no. At a glance, it may seem like we have 5x more people, but we actually don't. Layering is meant to create extra copies of the whole game world to accomodate a large number of low level players, so called "tourists". These tourists will never reach the higher levels, but still massively inflate the population count, and by extension also the number of layers. [Ion explains this very well here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=54). We're not going to have 5x more level 60s than we would on a normal server. Those players are part of the realm's permanent population. If that was the case, the realm would have a much larger population than a single server can sustain, and Blizzard will not be able to turn off layering. Sure, some level 60s will quit too, but their numbers will be totally insignificant compared to the _massive_ number of tourists in those early weeks.
---
**tl;dr: Massive amount of low levels creating lots of layers, but not a massive amount of high levels, who regardless are able to use all those extra layers.**
---
_"It's just for a few weeks, what's the big deal?"_
---
What is "a few" weeks though? We'd all love to think that a few means two, but it doesn't. Ion, who is the source of this claim, is pretty infamous for his PR-talk and sweettalking, kind of like [Todd Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFcLyDb6niA). If there's anyone out there who thinks "a few weeks" wasn't carefully chosen to be _very_ open ended, then I have a really nice multi-layered bridge to sell you. It'll be done in a few weeks, I promise. But just to provide something more substantial, even Blizzard employees have talked about it being in the first few ["months"](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779).
---
_"You will always log onto the same "home" layer"_
---
Unfortunately completely incorrect information that seems to come from a poorly written wowhead article which misquoted a video from a content creator. Your layer only remains the same in a single _session_ of gameplay. If you relog, take a boat, or simply if population demands, you may end up in a new layer. [\(Source 1\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=410) [\(Source 2\)](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=333)
---
_"I'd rather take layering than 10 hours of queuing!"_
---
Me too. Glad you read the post.
---
_"Blizzard should just pay for more servers"_
---
Layering is not because their servers can't handle the number of players. Each layer will host a full realm's worth of players, so hardware costs would be very similar. This is not a cost-cutting measure.
---
Oh I didn’t knew that, thanks for the news :)
---
Yeah totally agree with that but I think mega threads should at least be refreshed weekly with bullet points on the top issues at hand as things can get lost otherwise.
---
Exactly this. If I had 16 hours a day for the next 12 months to play then I'd roll on a PVP server but I don't. Time to kick back, relax and enjoy Azeroth.
---
Need level 60 to farm it, killing each boss and pickpocketing every mob. Vendoring alone makes you the majority of the gold and you can be an enchanter for some good shard farms.
---
let me fix this for you:
---
its only the wrong choice if you plan on raiding end game.  if you are just into the RPing or levels 1-59 then by all means play NE.
---
Did they went back on the official statement about non specific lunguage in EU exept for russian speaking people?
---
I didn't followed closely after last week EU server situation but if they stepped back and actually announced French and german server aswell as internationnal I'm happy
---
I know... and back then 3.5Gb would take soooo looong.
---
Sounds like a lot of dead servers lol
---
Going to disagree with you there. A lot of the story direction in these expansions I've personally disliked, but in general I'm going to prefer character developer (even if said development makes me like said character less) over no development at all.
---
Jaina going *into* classic had a great, and tragic backstory. Within Classic though she's a lifeless NPC. Nothing really there.
---
Jaina in retail has been through more tragedy, lost her way and went full bloodmonger, and slowly worked her way back into the main story and, as of 8.2, is on something of a redemption arc alongside Thrall.
---
Those kinds of story developments can be interesting, if a bit predictable.
---
Plus her model is cool, and the armour itself is pretty awesome.
---
Is that why they were doing it? Source?
---
It's kind of weird. I've seen classic hyped as this social experience with great leveling journey where anyone can go at their own pace and still have fun, where the world is full of interesting quest lines and RPG elements like talents or professions that let you make a unique character. 
---
Meanwhile, a lot of this sub's content is "gotta go fast to lvl 60 first week molten core cleared", character guides that are extreme to the point of listing what weapons you should get at which lvls, which quests to skip etc.
---
Don't get me wrong, anyone can play as they wish and I don't have the right to tell you how the game should be played. It's just confusing from the viewpoint of someone who hasn't played classic, but is excited to try it out, as to why are people so obsessed with being min-max and speedrunning the game? I get that there are people here attempting server firsts and world firsts, but then why choose classic? The raids have been cleared more than a decade ago, private server players reduce even the most challenging of raids to a joke and the game (and it's meta) is solved months before classic is out. 
---
If some of you are that thirsty for end game raids, then why aren't you playing BfA or other MMO? Isn't the quality of modern WoW raids one of the reasons one might choose it over classic?
---
I do realise my comment might come off as rude or offensive, perhaps elitist even. It isn't meant to be. I'm just genuinely curious.
---
Layering is only used to combat the players who will visit for one week, then never play classic again. Remember, every single person who plays retail now will have access to classes.
---
Just imagine how many hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, who will try Classic for 1 week, maybe even 1 day, and then never come back.
---
Layering is **only** used to combat the tourism issue.
---
Layering quite simply won't be needed after a few weeks. There will be no need to turn it on.
---
aoe farming in scarlet monastery was a good way to use cleave and whirlwind as a warrior. Some pulls you might randomly die, but there was no point in going full turtle mode for the relatively easy content
---
As a warrior, if I meet a rogue out of stealth 1-40 at least, he is gonna die. Can’t say that about any other class as they all kite, out dps or out survive me
---
Could be rough not tanking much and not having enough time to farm gold/consumes as a warrior. You would have a much easier time with everything as a warlock. I'd suggest considering tanking or maybe starting with a lock after making sure you would enjoy the playstyle enough to stick with it since your time is limited
---
Japanese Senkaku Islands is a pleonasm, the Chinese name "their" islands Diaoyu Islands.
---
I totally support this and would love to get the Ivory Raptor again.
---
A bit off topic maybe, but if I play Undead, how bad is the rep grind if I wanted to get a Raptor mount?
---
Umm, I was in a server leading guild back in vanilla. We got all the way to C'thun before it became really obvious how many scrub dps we were carrying. We used consumables and such, but almost never had any World Buffs, iirc.
---
Yeah sure, exactly how it's implemented is beyond my imagination. Your suggestion seems like a good idea. I just find it quite necessary for something of the like, especially as rule #7 is rarely enforced by the mods.
---
HOLY HELL THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE!
---
Tide pods really did lower peoples intelligence.
---
I think blizzard should disable scarab mount too, we wouldn't want to force players into completing the scarab quest too fast now would we ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That will just make it too easy to game the system.
---
You gonna fall, pick a truck
---
you seem confused.
---
i play the game but i don't pretend to be the character.  when i talk to you in game i will talk normally and not "role play".

Glad to hear, looking forward to enjoying it every week after work. Keep it up, my man!
---
It's pretty impressive how much advertising/promotion he has, given that he himself puts very little effort into doing so.
---
He's just sitting back letting the other YouTube channels do all the work for him. I mean, sure, those channels are probably making a nice bit of change off his content, but I suppose it's a trade off for him not having to do the work himself.
---
I will probably loiter around for long in each area lol.
---
I personally prefer the oldschool wc3 jaina look and I feel like that matches the classic theme better but yeah you make some great points I just dont think they convey as much with the generally direction of this exact meme lol
---
MC first week clear will not be a thing.
---
I believe it's been changed to both an alliance/horde tourney now.
---
You don't really downrank that much pvp. Downranking is to be mana efficient with less healing per second, in pvp you have to do as much as possible per second even if that means ooming yourself. At least in most cases, but when things aren't that critical sure you can slowly heal up a guy with downranks.
---
If you tank, you need a thick skin. If you don't have a thick skin, don't tank.
---
Most of the time the DPS are going to screw up your LOS pulls, they're going to use threat generating abilities, they're going to ignore your requests that they stop doing it. They're going to pull mobs while you're waiting for the healer to drink. Then if you screw up one pull or forget about one patrol, they'll blame you.
---
There's a reason the game always has a shortage of tanks, and it's because people who aren't tanks are idiots.
---
Yup but they get listed a lot cheaper as well
---
Most important is to play how you want. There is no right or wrong answer if you are having fun. 
---
I find bear grinding relaxing compared to cat. But it is slower as you say.
---
Idk if this works in wow, but it works other places as it triggers Chineseautomatic censorship
---
Is this with rogue diaries incorrectly priced at 45silver like on private servers? On classic they vendor for less than 3silver, rogues are going to be much worse gold farmers than what we're currently used to.
---
If you understand that getting to lvl 60 just to farm resources is a big task, go for it.
---
Both of your suggestions are perfect. The hunter will level fast to lvl 35, the druid is perfect for resource gathering.
---
If you're horde, you even get the Tauren herbalism buff.
---
But yeah, a druid has the option to travel form (I read somewhere that if you only run for 10 seconds or something, travel form is quicker than mount cast + run). And stealth to get to veins without having to kill mobs, also roots.
---
EU the german one (: I‘m still deciding between pve and pvp didn‘t make up my mind yet
---
Well it isn't like they gain anything from it. I'm sure people would agree cheating at bgs is a dick move.
---
Mine too.  I've been saying it, out of context, for years and nobody ever gets it.
---
See my below comment. Private servers have been implementing leeway for years. Everyone knew it existed.
---
Cute. I guess you have no argument.
---
If he did, the Voidwalker still didn't get, because he have no DKP.
---
&gt; their current implementation of Layering.
---
...which is perfectly reasonable and necessary for the game's initial launch period.
---
From an old nost guide you can get about revered. The rep bleed over isn't as much as it was on nost. It was about 10% on the classic beta so every quest you did gave a small portion of rep. But the best thing is those mounts aren't BOP they were BOE so you could easily have your friend buy them for you and trade it to you and just grind the rep up after via cloth. But if the beta stays true I think it will be decently hard to get exaulted with darkspear. I am still planning on doing it for my orc warrior because i want a raptor mount.
---
You can't run when casting anyhow.
---
Thanks guys! It is heartwarming to see support from whole community!
---
This might only be my personal perception but players on PvP servers simply had to get better at the game to stand a chance versus other real people. So people either got better or left to play somewhere safe.
---
I could dig a giant hole in my backyard by hand...or i can use a machine that does it much quicker...
---
no one is going to bring your useless meme spec to a raid unless they cant find anyone else to take the spot.  any raid leader who doesnt try to min-max to the best of their ability is a terrible raid leader.
---
Funny you mention Swamp of Sorrows because that was the zone I had in mind when I asked the question. The real root of my question was because if I had a zone I wanted to grind/farm for gold making purposes (green whelps and herbs in that zone) would I still find quests to do when I got there to grind? Seems the answer is pretty much, “mostly” which is all I needed to know. Thanks!
---
This
---
I'll play WoW for real life $$, shit.
---
Will be no problem. I'm German and my friends and I are going to play on an English server.

"Asmongold hosts amazing transmog competition"

insert slutmog nightelf thumbnail and a picture of him making a face
---
tbh im glad hes super popular now , i usto watch him back before he had a sub button , i dont really watch twitch anymore but i like hes stayed pretty much the same dude
---
I mean i feel this is an unnecessary troll of the discussion here, the scarab lord mount is part of an event for AQ. It is classic all over again so they should offer all of the mounts that were obtainable in vanilla. This is the same as saying you don't think the ZG tiger or Raptor should drop.
---
Probably off by a factor of 10 there - early on I would expect 100g on classic to be worth ~100,000 on retail.
---
You mean the reason that classic wow has even become a thing?
---
Tbc warlock's pve gameplay was the same. Cast curse of elements or curse of doom and proceed to spam shadowbolt... Seed of corruption replaced Rain of Fire and they could soulshatter... That's about it...
---
Been there, done that. è una storia che si ripete all'infinito, ma non sarebbe vero Vanilla senza i GM che regalano pezzi di set a ragazze nella speranza che gliela facciano annusare. Bei(?) tempi.
---
&gt; They don't get my memes.
---
We do get them alright, but most twitch memes at this point are overused like a cheap hooker in bangkok
---
Tbh I don’t really like the language barriers, I always enjoyed played on an international server and I’ll always enjoy it. Playing with people of the same culture language seams a bit boring to me.
---
Blizzard didn't really give a reason or an excuse for the decision. But it did come right after the last stress test where they had so few players login, they couldn't test all their 15 realms and had to reduce it down to 2. It's also the only reason that makes sense.
---
Fair enough, I've never really cared about the way my character looks enough to base it off that. Looking good doesn't get rank 1s at the end of the day so it was always just a bonus thing in my eyes if the character looked good. 
---
Never really understood why "tryhard" is meant to be a putdown anyway, it's like calling someone a nerd because they stayed home and studied before a test instead of going to a party or something, seems like a weird thing for people to be proud of purposely gimping themselves.
---
Now i want southpark to make a second warcraft episode that switches between the new "HD" models and the old models. But that won't happen because blizzard is no longer as cool as they used to be. Where when trey parker and matt stone asked: "can we use your models for ower south park episode?" Blizzard replied: "here is ower burning crusade beta server and some modeling tools have fun"
---
The reason to care is that you are contributing less to the raid than others, why is that so hard to understand? 
---
I feel like half of you people have never been in a raiding guild or something. You don't just show up to raids to get loot or whatever, you want the guild to do as well as possible, and that involves min-maxing to some degree. If you're in a good guild you shouldn't have problems really in raids, but you can still help by making clears faster. 
---
Every class is welcome and needed in raids, even min-maxers agree on that. What some people don't agree on is that it's perfectly acceptable to come as for example a ret-pala to raids. Obviously you can still beat raids with a ret pala, but unless you're purely there for entertainment value or something you are a bad guild member, your guild could very likely use you as holy.
---
Yes, I'm going resto and ele/resto for ranking. My guild currently has about 16 priests on roster and 9 shamans and one of the shams is Cdew so he'll be going enhance and a couple others are ele so I'll be needed more there,  plus shaman is just my favorite class in the game
---
More people should understand that min/maxing is fun for some people and you should get over it.
---
All those Catholics stuck in BC?

I have a hard time believing that layering will still be in place just before P2. That would mean that a large group of players are all clustered in a single zone working on the same quests and resources. After a couple weeks, most (if not all) of the borrlenecks will naturally work themselves out - some players will quit (or only seldom log into Classic,) and people will level at different rates - they will be scattered throughout differeny zones.
---
The only case where I can see layering still being a thing near P2 is if they badly underestimated the amount of interest in Classic, and there are so few servers that the only other solution to controlling high population is additional layers. If that's the case, then we might see them adding servers towards the end of P1.
---
There were a lot of factors that resulted in Classic WoW's announcement, Private Servers were one of them. That doesn't mean content exclusive to Private Servers belongs on this sub.
---
My friends and I are also going to play on an English server and we are all Germans too.
---
Forgot about them being BoE. So a troll friend could easily buy it and trade it to me, but I'll need the revered rep at some point to actually use/ride it?
---
Its healthy and delicious
---
Name one other factor
---
I was competing with the bottom mages/rogues, couldn't get near the top ones though.
---
Same here. Looking forward to regular dungeon runs with fun people. Also to join a good guild.
---
 - Each continent contains all zones within it.        
---
 - Therefore each layer of a realm and continent contains a second (or more) copy of each zone within it.    
---
 - Therefore "Nowhere have they said that each zone is further split" is a basic misunderstanding of how layering works. Every second layer contains a split in a zone, because it is continent wide and contains all zones.          
---
 - The discussion is about which layer it places a player onto (e.g. default layer Vs. overpopulation layer) and when a shift from one layer to another occurs (like zone change). Your post essentially questions the whole idea of how a layer over the same zone would exist, which is well documented.    
---
 - I feel like I'm speaking Greek here. People cannot grasp a very simple concept: How do you decide which layer to place a player onto? What event would you use to trigger a shift (e.g. like zone change!)? They either have no answer, or mumble incoherently about how layers basically work, over and over again... Throughout now 20+ posts. I'm just wasting my time.    
---
People that keep on posting this stuff, please, for the love of all that is holy come up with an explanation for how this video works technologically. The player's zone determined their layer, it is right in front of your eyes. Just explain that, THINK ABOUT IT. Write it down. Hit post.
---
If they pull it, they tank it. Let them die.
---
If they have a problem just leave the group. You're a tank, you don't have to put up with their bullshit. There's a million DPS out there, there's barely any good tanks.
---
&gt; If you understand that getting to lvl 60 just to farm resources is a big task, go for it.
---
I know, I'm not 100% on the 60 alt, yet. I plan on doing mining + herbalism on my main while levelling and switch out one of them for engineering on max level. I'm not quite sure, which one though. When I get the 60 alt, I'd also replace the other gathering profession, but again not sure with what. So, I'll always keep the possibility in mind to just drop mining or herbalism and let gold buy me the resources instead of going for a 60 alt.
---
Is melee leeway that big of an issue? I don’t remember ever hearing about it in vanilla and I leveled and PvP as a warrior
---
Farming is part of the game
---
You are confusing what can happen with what is likely to happen.
---
Meme specs CAN ve carried and experience vanilla end game but it is very unlikely.
---
Turkish Nether/Finreaver 2.0
---
Then I don't want your idea of balance.
---
I never really needed to be "not helpless" in the world. At lvl 60, the only world content you do is farm for professions. All the rest is done in group. Correct me if I'm wrong here. 
---
I played most of my end-game just sitting around in the city, waiting for queue's to pop, or raiding. Or world PVP, but always in group. I wasn't "solo" out in the world, in zones that were lvl 55+.
---
Even then, deep resto shaman can still kill mobs, and a holy priest can also still complete quests.
---
So I wouldn't use that as a factor.
---
However, I still personally prefer Shamans, and here's my reason:
---
They're so unique. A holy priest is just the most generic healing class you can ever think off. The Shaman is so interesting, you are a support class, which isn't something I'm used to in current WoW. I love the idea of a resto Shaman having his own "group" in a raid, to buff with totems.
---
Now, the real reason your 20/0/31 resto ele hybrid is interesting, is for battlegrounds. You won't need to respec to still be able to chip in some damage here and there.
---
Shaman all the way for me personally.
---
I am so happy that Blizzars listened! Now I am absolutely looking forward to launch, can't wait to get back into the real classic game after beta.
---
At Spanish and Italian players, make your voice heard. I wish you the best for own servers too
---
Gross
---
PfQuest for people who ain't playing games
---
Isn't hamstring kiting impossible in Classic atm due to how melee leeway currently works on mobs?
---
All of which are hosted in Los Angeles anyway. That's about a similar ping to Oceania having to play on NA realms.
---
You have to be exaulted to ride it. You can get to about halfway though revered if my math checks out on classic. Once i get back from my work trip the end of this month i will test on the beta doing every troll quests possible to 40 and see how far i can get into revered/ exaulted for a mount. Hopefully i can get close, ill stream the whole journey so i can document it.
---
It will probably be the same 1-5 guilds who are actually able to kill 4hm aswell.
---
I was an NE rogue and our guild cleared everything - vids are still up on YouTube after the Google Vids transfer, including our realm first KT kill (The Last Watch, Turalyon)
---
Don't let your Elfness hold you back, be at one with the green hair.
---
addons can change a lot the experience, you can change the UI to look like diablo 2
---
&gt;cause all addons are based off the 1.12 client
---
Not sure what this means, there were addons for every patch of the game from early Vanilla to BFA's 8.2.
---
----------
---
Most addons are not ported from Vanilla to Classic.  
---
The Classic API is closer to BFA than Vanilla.
---
Anything that works in Vanilla will almost certainly not work in Classic and vice versa.
---
I won't tank for groups that have a DPS warrior either. I'm the one doing all of the work, why should I share the loot.
---
But reincarnation is a valid cooldown for threat reduction!
---
Also what kind of boomer tier person tries to ruin someones content by posting what you are posting? It's crazy to think there is actually someone so overweight that they're bedridden and forced to moderate a wow classic subreddit while slapping up cold cuts off of their own stomach mountain and watching tipsout talk about how good he is at dueling
---
NEXT MONTH oh gaawd how awesome that sounds!!!!!!!!!!
---
&gt;With 2.0 talents, it wouldn't be vanilla at all.
---
Well, I never claimed I wanted a 1:1 vanilla. What I wanted was a "enhanced" version of vanilla with stuff like fucking worthwhile talent trees and not the shit we had.
---
It probably will though
---
I do remember a few RU and Spaniards on my server so much fun when grouping with them. I don’t understand neither language and often replied in Swedish or German if they didn’t switch to English.  
---
Trying to make 5mans work when one is not understanding even basic English is so so so fun.   
---
Raiding is well easier just let them die if they can’t follow instructions but for 5man and general chat it’s bad when we got tons of Spanish or German or French in the channels.  
---
Perhaps If they added different language channels for those it might work but it’s bad for fr/de/Es as if they spread out over several servers they may struggle.
---
just want to say you are beautiful
---
You can complete vanilla raids moving and clicking ur abillities with a mouse.
---
You realize that guys post proves my point?
---
He's running the same version that popular private servers run.
---
That means any of you can make a free account and log on and test it for yourself.
---
Go ahead and do it and post your results.
---
Spoiler, you can't reproduce this on private servers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Z8MTAX-nQ&amp;t=
---
The melee leeway they have on classic beta is **NOT VANILLA-LIKE** and should be fixed.
---
Which echos what I said about it not working.
---
Good on you, now what about the english speaking realms?
---
I'm not talking out of my ass; I was playing during Vanilla and saw how people played and cleared content. 
---
Aside from realm- or world-first progression guilds (and there were many more non-progression guilds), there were many with meme-specs, "casual" raiders who made it well into Naxx40, all sorts of things people are discounting because the examples are all either BLACK or WHITE. CASUAL or HARDCORE.
---
Pservers are a bad example of how the "non progression" or non-realm-first players will actually do content. I'm not discounting your experience; the pserver crowd more fits into the dedicated group example (which I think Blizz cited as less than 1% of the playerbase).
---
As an example, [Here's Vanilla wow C'thun 40 with boomkins on Shattered Hand.](https://i.redd.it/bon7cnk3l8131.jpg) There were **plenty** of outliers to content progression as discussed by the "hardcore/world first/real first" crowd. 
---
The whole idea that "it's this way or that way" just doesn't really work in the way people actually played.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/class-trainer-plus
---
The guy who taught it to me did it in vanilla.
---
It really was a problem back then before all national servers were up and running. Some servers would end up with a very large portion of [insert random nationality] that refused to speak english.
---
I watch all of Skarm's videos and enjoy them, but he has some strange ideas about tanking. If everyone in the group is competent, it's easy. If you have 39 people whose keyboards keep shorting out from drool, his advice isn't going to work.
---
This probably leads to an endless cycle of re-optimization so I think you're busy until launch. ;-)
---
I respec at 52. But yeah the mind flay level at 44 or so is where most good priests respec.
---
As someone who wanted the comeback of the early mounts in Vanilla, I support the idea.
---
Also, I would like to see Plainsrunning back in the game. I know it ain't gonna happen, because it wasn't in the final version and Tauren got Kodos. But I can dream, can't I?
---
It's been a while and no one has replied so I'm gunna say hello even though I myself don't play on Linux and Win10 rather but regardless I wish you the best of luck friend
---
The layer of skill is from things like being able to Vanish Death Coils, without the spell batching you can't do that, it hits you regardless of if you Vanish before it hits or not. Hell I've had multiple occasions on live without it that I've hit something like Blade Dance on my DH and another Rogue has Kidney Shot me. The animation for Blade Dance happens but it doesn't do anything. Doesn't go on cooldown or give me the 100% dodge. I just get stunned.
---
I give them a little compliment... Maybe a wink and a smile.
---
I would honestly disregard the idea of having a lv60 alt just for farming. It's such a battle to get to 60 that it would have been more financially viable to spend that time grinding mobs for gold on your main.
---
I would get the hunter to 35, but the druid to 60 is a lot of time to use for a gathering character. 
---
If your main is relatively good at farming, you'll be better off just farming on your main and then buying the resources. 
---
I will level an alt, but they'll be more a product of me wanting to level an alt than "needing" to for professions. 
---
So unless your main is a healer, you'll be spending your time better not leveling a druid strictly to gather.
---
Perhaps your, but not my experience. Wasn't using quest addons and reached level 60 anyway.
---
I've had highschool spanish. It's arguably an easier language to learn than French (despite them being cousins).
---
They aren't *as* bad as everyone makes them out to be.
---
But they bring nothing to a raid that a Rogue wouldn't bring.
---
Your biggest problem isn't that they are "as bad as everyone makes them out to be", it's that everyone who isn't playing druid will still firmly believe that you will be useless, doesn't matter how good you are.
---
It's the same as enh shamans or prot warriors in the first patch of BFA. If you wanted to do mythic+ at a high key, it didn't matter how good you actually were, people just didn't like your class/spec and were biased to just ignore you in favor of a better dps/tank.
---
So, you can play feral druid. I did too in early TBC, they're fun to play as, really fun.
---
But in Classic, people will be biased towards your class and spec and you will hear shit for it. Even if you're the best druid in the game.
---
You are so sweet and generous
---
Russian is actually above German, by 9.3% or 26.3%, depending on which statistics you use.
---
because MC is the pinnacle if classic raiding...
---
how many dead weight meme specs can you bring to kill kt?
---
Yeah, it's still a roleplaying game. Those are the elements of the game that you like. They're there because it's an RPG. It doesn't mean you have to play a role, it means it has RPG elements.
---
Dude don't forget about the Scandinavian countries + Netherlands, UK + Greece(you were a weird bunch, still love you though) all rolling on English servers.
---
Feral cat can pull more damage than a rogue if the druid is tryhard and the rogue is casual (or bad). The difference is not as large as its made out to be.
---
On the Hunter Classic discord it was discussed that this was not affecting all hunters.
---
But are there enough of them playing wow to warrant a French speaking NA-server?
---
You need to have game time to play so you will need to create an account to add game time to.
---
Considering your specifications I would without question say an SP. It ticks all the boxes you are after.
---
The one thing that bothers me about the image is the arrow directky ontop the character.
---
As a filthy American, this excites me because now I don't have to hear people complaining about merged EU servers.
---
Also if you're French or German it's cool too I guess.
---
The mobs are grey.....
---
That depends on a huge multitude of factors.
---
But one thing is for SURE, if a tank can support itself with consumables, he will be MT/OT over a tank that relies on guild supplying the consumables.
---
Back in Vanilla, it took me less than 2 months from a newbie lvl 58 recruit to MT position...because I played 8-10 hrs /day, had plenty of gold, always had flaks (even if not needed) and much more consumables than all other tanks.
---
I replaced the MT, because while all tanks show up in time...I was the only one that saved the guild gold and being online all day long to run 5 men with everyone else.
---
The more time you have, the better to solidify your position as tank in a guild, if all the other things are equal.
---
It's not just about showing up in time for raids. Pretty much ALL tanks will do it, in a raiding guild.
---
What will separate them is skill, but if they are all skilled (which they will most likely be), commitment to guild OUTSIDE raid times and the ability to sustain itself with consumables and enchants will be the determining factor.
---
People are absolutely underestimating it. The prevailing attitude is that the raids will roll over and die to people just showing up. That will be true of pserver players and hardcore guilds but the average player has no idea what they’re in for.
---
13 healers is a bit much (assuming you have a shadow priest and a feral tank)
---
Just wanted to picture the opposite poles. Regarding MC clear first week, it might
---
There was not really that much of a difference in buffs when it comes to Enhancement versus Restoration, tho. At least not enough that it made it worthwhile to use a enhancement spec.
---
I might be wrong but playing 15-20 hrs per week doesn't seem that bad to me.
---
Also, I've known guilds that provide repairs and consumables for their key role players (on of the few good tanks in a guild, for example).
---
Puts rockbiter on and max rank earth shocks, “why does this tank keep losing aggro!!”
---
No need to tell me what your parents told you :)
---
People keep saying that guilds won't invite meme specs. And that's true, to a point. Nobody wants boomkin for progression.
---
However, if you put your time in as an optimal spec, you'll collect off spec gear when nobody needs it. Eventually, you can go as boomkin or whatever, but still expect to be asked to go back to your main spec when needed for actual progression.
---
いいですね
---
Both classes will have no issue farming, warlocks are better suited to farming though. 
---
Unlike other poster, both classes are highly gear dependant in PvP, unfortunately shadow priests are very strong, and have no escape mechanisms, so you are targeted by most enemies. This means if you don't have good gear you will be deleted, similar to warlock.
---
We're talking about how how she is, not how many mental scars she has.
---
&gt;All the finesse of tanking died
---
Charge, thunderclap, go for coffee while the DPS kills it.
---
I’ll be playing on Linux. There was another post on reddit a while ago discussing this - pretty sure people had the beta (or maybe the Blizzcon alpha?) running okay. At work or Id try and find it for you.
---
It's not their fault, but it's certainly not worth the hassle either. Playing with people from so far away (basically Asia servers) creates massive latency where they run (slide) around even if you've stunned them or whatever for the entire duration of the stun. As a melee it takes the absolute piss to try and connect. Factor that into random battlegrounds where you're with randoms and they're premade communicating on voice - even if you can get your team to work together you still can't hit them half the time anyway. 
---
Communication isn't half the issue. Lag and playstyle are the major factors.
---
a feral tank can be useful.
---
moonkins and rets are completely useless.  that is a fact
---
people were clueless in retail vanilla so dont use it to compare the modern classic player base
---
I want BRM, world pvp, and that faction divide, but i fear that being around fortnite/league angry 13 year olds will ruin my experience now that I'm an old fogey. hmmmmm
---
I wouldn't play alliance to be a PvP warlock. PvE is great for alliance warlocks, but not PvP. 
---
If you're a good hunter, there won't be any huntards jokes, hunters have one of the highest skill caps in the game.
---
he isnt arguing for the latter raid...
---
he wants to play a meme spec like boomkin or ret pally
---
Hello there! That's very kind of you. 
---
I know it's quite a stretch from the usual content of the sub, but figured this would be the best place to post, aside from /r/linuxgaming
---
Add a 0
---
Funny how every person screaming "NO CHANGES" is going to run ten different AddOns on day 1.
---
Even as a godlike enhance Shaman you will do half the DPS of a semi competent Rogue. It isn’t a skill issue.
---
Dude i would love to see plains running i always loved the idea that tauren could do that over using a mount especially if you made them have a cast for it just like a mount. Give people the option to do either. I love the idea of the old mounts after playing on the private servers and having an old Horse on my warrior and my paladin people would comment to me all the time how they were jealous of those two mounts when i was on either character. It is an achievement to have one of them and should be like that.
---
The windows way? thanks mate had a chuckle
---
better off having a warrior use the nightfall over a ret pally.
---
You have to be trolling or just have zero clue what youre talking about.  Either way....bye.
---
Private servers are constantly looking for tanks.
---
Tank burnout is massive in vanilla.
---
As a tank, you should really just start your own groups when you want to do an instance.
---
1 Silver if below 30.
---
5 Silver between 30 and 40
---
10 Silver between 40 and 50
---
10-20 Silver at level 60
---
Nah, 15 healers man :)
---
So you'd rather carry a rogue that's not trying than a feral druid who is? 
---
&gt; most rets aren’t going to be putting in a ton of effort to make themselves a bit less useless
---
Sounds like projection.
---
There are more Hindi speakers than Spanish. Spanish comes in at #4.
---
You guys have so weird 'horror' stories with Loot Council haha
---
hell no ! :P 75 silver for 15 seconds of work ?!
---
It really comes down to preference as the classes are very different. One thing I will say to take into consideration is that if you pick a gnome you will always be a priority target for the Horde. That was a big factor in my friend rerolling his race.
---
Why a big nono for you?
---
That isn’t normally the case.
---
DAMNIT BOBBY
---
Razorgore is more about raid coordination than min/maxing. And Vael is mostly a gear check; you have to be decent, but not flawless. I do however agree that BWL will be a rude awakening for many.
---
Ok, dont do that.  You have zero clue about the inner workings and are make leaps that have no base in reality and claiming its what blizzard wants like it was in a blue post.
---
Anyone else feel a sudden panic that the installer was about to detect a problem and stop the entire download?
---
Dude same :( Fuck I want soooo many things..
---
So how many of ret palas and moonkins was invited to raids? You have demonstrated that it can be done but how likely is it?
---
This may be reason enough to justify leveling with dw.
---
You don't even know how I would balance. All I said is that I think it would be good.
---
Also: You bring 2 druids and 5 paladins for healing. Do you think that is a problem, or do you think it is fine? To me, it is a little like just taking a big fat dump on druids.
---
&gt; most spoken language in the world?
---
That would be English by ~1.43%.
---
If there is a client side and server side check (which we can deduce already), then it is very reasonable they are different.
---
The client side check would just be so the server is not flooded with tens of packets per second of someone trying to spam abilities *that could not be working to begin with*.
---
It makes sense to give the client a very big leeway that would ensure any ability that has the tiniest chance of being in range gets sent to the server. This client side leeway would really help in situations where you have seconds of latency in a lag spike. The server would be (and frankly is) still the final authority in that case. But that would avoid rubberbanding and having your abilities locked client side, even if you happen to be in range server side - which you can’t know during a lag spike. Better let the client send out the info regardless as lagspikes are not a norm.
---
Tldr everything points at this being a spam/flood protection.
---
Druids are a hybrid in the purest sense. You will never top any meters, bear form is good and has a niche, but will always be second to warriors. 
---
Druids don't do anything amazingly except kite, but they do a lot of things very well. 
---
It's a niche playstyle that leaves a lot of people unsatisfied.
---
They announced them earlier today: [](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/french-and-german-realms-for-wow-classic/60051)
---
But at no point did they say there would only be three international servers, just confirmed the three rulesets would be available.
---
Then what do you suggest?
---
Anything will run it decently
---
In Brazil HUEHUEHUEHUE
---
So, if I just look at the ones that stuck to the lvl cap, and only on a pvp realm (because I'm going to play pvp)
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?faction=Horde&amp;maxLevel=40&amp;minLevel=40&amp;realm=4619_Classic%20Beta%20PvP
---
It's actually balanced.
---
Wouldn't that mean you've taken all of the dps slots and made them "meme"? Aren't we talking more like 2 hours or 2 hours and 10 minutes? I don't think anyone in this thread is saying bring 6 enhance shammy, 4 feral druids, 8 shadow priests. Saying bring...I dunno, one of each?
---
I think gaming is still really social....just not how I want to be social lol. I play lots of team based games, but anytime people get a chance to talk...they just screech in the mic or yell racist/sexist stuff constantly and I have to mute them. I mean maybe I'm just older (only 29) but then again, I hear people my age doing the same thing as the teens. 
---
I miss the social aspect that OP laid out exactly. It was so cool to do all the things he listed. Like damn, I remember one of my biggest friends I met through vanilla, and how we talked about what we were going to study in college, that damn keyboard turning rogue who stole perditions blade from me, sharing new music, watching pvp videos and talking about them. Man and I did that with a large handful of people. I relate in that I haven't had an experience similar to that since vanilla/TBC.
---
I remember levelling an alt (shadow)priest in vanilla. Obviously most of the time, I would run dungeons as the healer. Usually, if a tank was sporting a 1h+shield, he would have so shitty threat generation that I was better off staying in shadowform and helping as dps, since the mobs were just being kited around by the dps anyways. If the tank somehow managed to keep agro, he would take basically no damage allowing me to stay in shadowform most of the time.
---
Same! I have a real guild back in vanilla and tbc but after that they were more like a chat group I joined and never really knew the others. Haven’t made friends since then. Hope I can find nice people to join at classic!
---
I don't know, man. Corpsecamping does happen but how often did you get camped for hours on end? I think I can count it on 2 hands. 
---
If I did get camped usually one of two things happend: 1) I logged to an alt. 2) I mobilized my friends/guild to help me.
---
If scenario 2 occured it sometimes lead to the most fun I had playing WoW. Massive WPvP that took hours was way more fun than turning in a quest or two. At least in my oppinion...
---
There will be a stickied thread on Monday for guilds that are looking to recruit.
---
Isn't "zug zug" a submissive acknowledgement? It's like saying "ok boss"
---
BWL is the first true raid tbh. MC was like a “well let’s just make a raid real quick” and they copy pasted half the bosses and changed 1 thing. Only Rag was a proper fight tbh. BWL has a challenge in nearly every encounter and unique mechanics to them. Anyone who think they’re on the same level has never done either and 100% never did Vael because that boss alone killed so many casual guilds since their good players would peace out and join proper guilds.
---
I think we both realize that the difference between the best and the worst at things is a hell of a lot more than 1%.
---
I'm french and there is no way i chose to go on french realms lol. I see too much toxicity with them in retail and other games.
---
I'll be doing that in classic as I'm levelling with a healer. But sometimes it's easier to just whisper someone in world LF1M Tank.
---
Wouldn't the vast majority of these gold selling whispers made by bot accounts?
---
We will see but so far it actually looks *possible* - it requires a lot of coordination and having 40 people that pretty much hold no regard for themselves and their health but by hardcore grinding dungeons and whatnot you should be able to hit 60 within 120-130 hours, meaning with absolute minimum downtime (let's say 5 hours a day) you should be able to raid MC with semi-decent gear from said dungeons already on day 7.
---
I think it's kinda pointless and it will ruin the game somewhat for people doing that, because you literally make yourself miss a shitton of content this way, but yeah - definitely theoretically possible.
---
It's perfectly acceptable content considering it's not the usual sludge that's repetitively regurgitated constantly so no worries whatsoever. 
---
I imagine the Linux playerbase is fairly small?
---
I personally think I'd use a program to run windows 10 if I was using Linux but that's just because I'm scared of change
---
Dat ist richtig juuut!  Überraschung der Woche. Abgesehen von Von der Leyen.
---
You want to take Shield Specialization, you will switch to a 1H + Shield almost every time you engage a Rogue and Warrior. Otherwise they will kill you before you can kill them. On the other hand 5% mana isn't really significant. If you have 5K Mana, which you will not have as Enhancement, then you'll get 250 mana and that's not even enough for half a chain lightning.  
---
Since you're taking the Elemental route I would take Elemental Warding as it boosts your survivability. It can make the difference between making it to your target or not while you're being kited around or barely surviving to heal yourself when you're getting nuked.  
---
I'm a fan of Eye of the Storm because healing interrupt free is just nice but that's just preference. Overall your build is solid to maximize personal DPS for WPvP as Enhancement.
---
Look at that, just another example of the great evil Blizzard not listening to its players!!!
---
Shadowbolts are just single tick dots
---
Entitled english and frence players got their way
---
True, it's easy to pop into a group that just needs a tank, but then you don't get to choose who is in it.
---
Im excited for crafting to matter. Idk why but in other MMO's it never seems as important as in WoW. WoW always seemed to emphasize another player making things for you (bags and consumables) then vendors. In other MMO's i never felt compelled to ask crafters for things. In WoW it felt much more encourages / necessary.
---
I was there in Vanilla. Feral rarely tops the damage meters but the amount of utility they have is incredible. They are very strong in world PvE and PvP. If that's the class you want to play, absolutely, you would have a lot of fun.
---
If your EU I'll join you
---
Ayyyyyy.
---
Addons existed in Vanilla
---
Didn't expect that many.
---
I never claimed I had inside information. The decision was an obvious one, otherwise you'd be able to come up with a better excuse. And the numbers supported it. You really think
---
&gt; We think this approach will give players more freedom to move around to where they want, and find guilds and friends that best match their interests.
---
Was the reason they lumped everyone in the EU together? Just no.
---
That's a good one.
---
Yes, OP is every person screaming "no changes"
---
They were added later. Vanilla started with English, French and German servers. Spanish was later added as the fourth language if I remember right, again later joined by Italian and Russian.
---
If you get held back with having a enhance shaman in your raid, I dunno about the raiding prospects of that guild.
---
I just say "looks like you already have a tank, good luck!", then if they whisper me I say I'm already in a another group.
---
Interesting.
---
I'm interested
---
\\s
---
!RemindMe September 20th
---
Always thought that RU servers are located somewhere im Europe since I have same ping on AD and on any RU realms. As for bgs, lost insane amount to Russian horde premaids so i feel the pain. Anyway almost everyone who started before RU servers came in will stay on EU for classic since playing on RU feels like hell for a lot of reasons (mostly cringy localization and sukablyat mentality)
---
I was recently approached by a person from a casual guild, that had read my post on looking for a casual guild.  
---
They plan to take it easy during progress clearing new content during the first week.
---
&gt; I'm also curious about total PUG raids. Did they happen without a core of guildies starting them? How many players formed the core? Surely there was a master looter, but did applicable classes just roll-off for items without priority? 
---
They didn't happened (or if they did, they disbanded after first wipe, which was usually the first boss).
---
It was always a CORE of players, from the top guilds that started the raid, and the core was usually 20-25 people for MC and Ony.
---
The other 15-20 were most of the time, friends of the members of the core team. Rarely, if ever, an unknown player will access an MC / Ony PuG, unless it was a healer.
---
For BWL, the core was usually 32-35 people, mains and alts from a well established raiding guild. 5-8 spots were allowed for random players that will drop serious gold for item drops. Friends usually were not taken in BWL raids.
---
AQ40 and Naxx were never outside the guild.
---
You have a community to post your "content" to. It is not this one.
---
I know the horde side have been preparing for an upcoming duel tourny but I don't think they have been merged with the Asmond/Esfand/Rich tourney. I believe the Horde has their rules worked out a while ago so player knew how to prepare but the Ally was still debating their rules last night.
---
So even if there was a merge, would their rules even be the same?
---
But addons existed in vanilla, what?
---

be aware that you cant have both find herbs and find ore active at the same time
---
Actually the real question will be is your guild dumb enough to give previous few loot drops to a guy playing a meme spec and is a guy getting literally 0 drops because he’s playing a meme spec dumb enough to keep playing it?
---
I truly respect and value your thoughts and ideas :)
---
&gt;450-500 DPS
---
this is what a fury warrior can do in MC.
---
Do you have a link for those rankings?
---
Never pointed at you saying that I can’t play it. I just said a fact.
---
Made my morning commute Epic, thank you Josh!
---
you have to understand that all of the people saying "its easy and we should bring in their meme specs" are not going to be clearing aq40 or naxx.  
---
the best they will ever do is get a nef a kill
---
That looks like Questie. pfQuest is way better and more subtle. I just want spawn locations for quest items and enemies on the map.
---
It is a step in the right direction but it can probably still be exploited.
---
Yeah eu. I think in all the time I played on it up until wrath, I could count on one hand how many skirmishes I saw.
---
I went the same route as you. For whatever reason after being a long time Warcraft player (since Orcs and Humans) I went the EQ2 route. Sold my Alienware at the time and built a new PC specifically for that. By the time I finally crossed over to WoW, 1.4 or 1.5, my PC was more than capable of running it at 40+ FPS.
---
Female NE is overused in my opinion. You see far more females than males.
---
How about the Senior Engineer, Omar Gonzalez, finding the backups and hacking together a prototype of the old data working on the 7.3.5 client in his spare time? Ion Hazzikostas said WoW Classic would absolutely not have happened without that breakthrough.
---
Played from release and I had the updated T2 set doing BWL and quit the game shortly after. I never did AQ and it wasn't even out yet.
---
Thank you!
---
I found combat as priest to be the most mind numbing of all classes. Easily the most boring class in game to level.
---
I think I'll do what I want and argue how I want, but thanks anyway.
---
Hold on with spreading corrupted blood to locals this time!
---
&gt; Well, I never claimed I wanted a 1:1 vanilla. 
---
You literally said the 2.0 talent trees.
---
Think about if for a second, though. Let's say they made all classes perform equally well, like they intended in later expansions (even if they didn't always succeed). An enhancement shaman now does as much DPS as a mage. Awesome, right?
---
But now mages are shit. They don't provide totems or innervate/rebirth or whatever, they can't heal in emergencies, they don't increase the DPS of others. So now you need to buff mages as well, and all other specs in the game. You need to give everyone the same utility that the "bad" specs have, if they're all going to be competitively viable. Otherwise you've just shifted the "bad spec" malus onto other classes.
---
So now all specs are 100% viable. Yay! But now the itemization doesn't make sense because you can't bring four ret paladins to a raid when none of their tier gear is usable. So we have to have whole new loot tables, new tier sets, etc. You want raids to freely bring anyone without concern for their raid setup, right?
---
And now 100% of the content in vanilla is totally trivial, so all of it has to be completely overhauled. Every mob across the board needs to have its stats updated to accomodate the fact that the overall power level of players has skyrocketed.
---
Then there's PvP balance. What the hell do we do about that? You can't just double the damage output of an enhancement shaman. You can't just remove a balance druid's mana struggles. These things would totally obliterate the PvP scene. At this point, the release date has probably been pushed to 2024 given that Blizzard would have to basically create a completely new game.
---
And at this point, it isn't even vanilla WoW anymore so the game will satisfy nobody except those few who are so irrationally hellbent on playing a weak spec in the endgame that they're willing to suggest turning the game into something completely different in order to get what they want.
---
Or we could just fucking stick with what has been proven to work.
---
Wow I can't believe this is a thing.
---
I love it. 
---
Thanks for this!
---
Hi, /u/analyticalAllen

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8nx59/i_just_quit_my_telecommunications_job_so_i_can_no/). 
---
Thanks mate. You are right about that survivability. Better take shields and elemental ressists. Will take that into concideration.
---
Thanks for admitting it.  Should make it easy for the mods to delete your shit post.
---
comedy isn't really a talent of yours is it?
---
Played a gnome rogue back in vanilla. Loved it, especially being able to destroy clothies in PVP. 
---
Decided to try out a warlock. Leveled an orc warlock up to 33 on a pserver. Decided I’d go with a gnome lock in classic. The leveling is EZ mode. 
---
Then I started thinking about the awesome bloodfang set, vis’kag, brutality blade, and perd blade....so now here I am leveling up a dwarf rogue to try it out again. 
---
/sigh
---
At least I am significantly better at PvP as a rogue (me personally, I was getting trashed as a lock). 
---
Have to go dwarf rogue over gnome this time, my one issue with gnomes is I hate the mechanostrider and no way I’m grinding for rep.
---
Hahaha yeah I’m with you, it’s going to be more than a few weeks. 
---
I’m thinking a few months - probably done before the new year - but that’s conjecture.
---
Yeah, that may be true, now that I think about it :P
---
Hi 'leveling up a dwarf rogue to try it out again. 
---
Have to go dwarf rogue over gnome this time, my one issue with gnomes is I hate the mechanostrider and no way I’m grinding for rep.', im DAD.
---
Hi 'significantly better at PvP as a rogue (me personally', im DAD.
---
brilliant!!! Have a thumbs up! :D
---
no one is saying its not an RPG.  I am talking about a style of play.  some players "RP" and others don't
---
What a pretentious thing to say.
---
Your devotion is worth at least some respect, mister HK.
---
Cool, thanks for the link!
---
How efficient is Warlock gold farming compared to Mage?
---
Ohhh the days of the download just stopping for minutes and minutes (or more), while I know full well that my internet is okay.  The frustration. We've come a long way.
---
everyone needs bags! It should be extra interesting with no one having spare bags in the beginning lol
---
That would be nice but it would be even better if we knew what realms where in what timezone. NA-CST vs NA-EST etc.
---
Everyone knows this already
---
Das ist ja mal knorke!
---
i know its a joke but lets try to min-max this roster you put together.  horde or alliance?
---
Wasn't trying to be funny.
---
Excellent news. The concept of everyone on one server might sound inclusive, but considering nearly half of the adults in Europe have a questionable grasp of English at best giving these massive populations an (*optional*) language-specific server is far more consumer friendly.
---
Nah. You have to tank swap so much that every tank will easily pile on more threat.
---
It’s always bugged me when relevant NPC’s don’t help with specific bosses. It would have been a really nice touch if both Jaina and Sylvanas were there to do bits of damage and provide some sort of utility to the raid.
---
It’s especially baffling since they’ve done that both before and since. Maiev in the Illidan fight; Kalecgos in the Kil’jaeden fight; and Yrel, Khadgar, and Grommash on the Archimonde fight all come to mind.
---
Go go power rangers!
---
As a dude who's gonna dungeon grind speed-run to 60 and "ruin the game", I just want to start my raid gear progression soon as possible and lock a good reliable spot in raids. Then I'll take the scenic route on my alt afterwards.
---
But I also really like dungeons.
---
That's Italian, bruder.
---
&gt; Oceania, you can breathe a sigh of relief. If France is getting at least one realm in WoW Classic, it's almost certain you are too.
---
That is clearly an opinion.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
Or why we need to shut up about their current implementation of layering because it’s good for the game, temporary, is the best solution to keep servers from dying.
---
Does your account have to be subbed to reserve a name?
---
If not whats to stop people from making 20 accounts and reserving a bunch of names?
---
Being bound by faction until betrayal was kind of annoying but certain subspecs just absolutely outclassed the others.  Coercer was an illy with better buffs and damage while losing just a little cc that didn't work on anything that mattered.  Defiler added way more damage at the cost of very little warding.  Inq dps boosts were incredible and Templars had nothing to show for it.  What the fuck does a swashbuckler even do ?  Brigands with dispatch were the godkings of debuffs while swashies...had light shields? 
---
Eq2 was badly balanced.  Fun though.  Easily surpassing classic wow in dungeon and quest design.  Just not as much fun to play unfortunately and you can only oggle the scenery for so long.
---
I couldn’t possibly be more logical and reasonable. 
---
That’s how dkp is done in guilds - it always favours the members who are “in” with the group. 
---
You have to claw your way to the top if you aren’t “in” with them. 
---
LC w/ randomly selected members choose where to send the next item. 
---
So unless you are thoroughly disliked, or a pug - you’ll receive gear at least once every few raids. 
---
You can also talk to your guild about an item you specifically want and that can factor into the LC.
---
Communism / dictatorship is favourable to smaller groups of people.
---
36 41
---
and for other casters its 30 - 36
---
That's because it's difficult for the simple-minded to imagine something that isn't true.
---
You're picking on the lower end of my numbers, which I say happens very rarely, while conveniently ignoring the fact that the majority of the time I'm doing upwards of 650 and sometimes even has high as 1000DPS, while also bringing an extra set of totems and a wipe-saving instant heal with NS + Max rank Healing Wave.
---
You are completely wrong.  I have never seen someone so wrong.
---
It's a joke about how blizzard removed unarmoed mounts because they don't want people rushing to 60... cmon man :/

---
If blizzard was not full on retarded on listening to NOCHANGES crowd, then I would've not had to install OmniCC, Theorycraft and Omen (or whatever the fuck people use nowadays) day 1. Because everything I listed exists in modern client and doesn't affect gameplay or completely mandatory.
---
In reality though, you don't see much tanking done by non-Warriors in raids. Druid tanking becomes a hypothetical, with only little practical value. Druids in raids are predominantly healers, just like priests. They have the same role, and one of them is just better than the other.
---
&gt;I think it's kinda pointless and it will ruin the game somewhat for people doing that - because you literally make yourself miss a shitton of content this way 
---
The people doing this will be private server veterans. Those people have gone through the levelling content so many times in the past years that they won't really be missing anything.
---
Anyway, I think that you are underastimating the actual tryhards. Stuff like 120-130 hours to 60 and 5 hours of downtime each day is still on the more casual end of the spectrum when it comes to speedrunning vanilla content.
---
I know I'm way late, but from my memory, the actual 'hard mode' of early WOTLK was basically the Glory of the Hero/Raider achievement, which were actually quite fun and challenging at release. They rewarded you with some awesome 310 % mounts and unique titles. I remember having a lot of fun figuring out how to do many of those achievements.
---
10/10 guter ebayer
---
I leveled a Spriest as one of my many alts, and loved it. I enjoyed the different game play. I didnt pvp too much at all with it, as my gear sucked. But I always had difficulties with a good shadow priest, when I pvp'd on my hunter, even when I was well geared.
---
80% of the playerbase will flood in two weeks before release once marketing goes into full swing.
---
The cloth turn-in NPCs are up in beta. If they stay around for phase 1 it'll be extremely doable. If they don't...
---
You were spouting these numbers when people were asking for language-specific EU realms, saying they wouldn't happen. Now here we are. It's like you take blizzards word as gospel and can't think for yourself.
---
Lmao, guess how I know you're triggered.
---
Our poor unarmored mounts should not be caught up in the whole '1.12 itemization' thing. They were separate items, not just different looking like the t2 armor sets, and not differently statted like some other loot. Just straight up different items that for some reason Blizz decided not to include.
---
And more should understand that having that +5 skill vs raid bosses means:
---
* You only need 6% hit as opposed to 9% hit.
---
* 40% of your white hits deal 30% more damage.
---
* your enemies have 0.5% less chance to dodge and block your attacks
---
It is a bit like you passing on gloves that offer 3% chance to hit, 12% more white damage and -0.5% enemy block and dodge.
---
That item would be super bis throughout the game. You decide to go naked instead.
---
If you still want to play a different class, **that is still cool**. I mean it. But please try to understand the differences before you make a permanent decision like this. The difference is *huge*.
---
If you like the idea of raids, for rogues and dps warriors your dps will play a big role. It’s not needed to clear the content but part of the fun.
---
Don’t let me tell you you should pick humans or orcs *but also don’t let OP tell you not to*. Understand what I wrote and make an informed decision instead. Make up your own mind.
---
I take a bit of offense with OP equating the desire to pick the far stronger race with a “world first” mentality. Your DPS has nothing to do with that.
---
There are plenty of reasons to carr about big damage numbers and if your dps is lower or higher than your guildmates’. *It can be a lot of fun*. And I really don’t think many dps raid without a dps addon.
---
Thank you mate &lt;3
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BLAZZARD WHY!
---
Some people just want the world to sparkle.
---
&gt; I'm trying to avoid big streamer realms, and my plan is to watch streams to find out which realms they reserve names on.
---
Good luck with that. Nearly every streamer has pledged they won't be announcing their realm choices until launch day. They'll simply not stream until they've reserved their names and then never speak about it.
---
The only exception to this will be the guilds that streamers are making. Other members of those guilds might leak it.
---
Do you really need to clear MC 15 minutes faster that much that you'd force the warriors to play something else? It doesn't make much sense. Just bring warriors if you want warriors later. You're gonna need them in Naxx anyway.
---
You literally answered your own question here
---
Stop kidnapping
---
Nightfall here I come :)
---
I’m in the same boat. No OCE servers = no play. I got 3 mates that would be out without hesitation too fwiw
---
I agree to some extent.  It is 'boring' but then again I could argue most classes have a boring leveling experience as well it's just that a lot just aren't as safe.
---
What is really fun is leveling a priest on a pvp server.  You are generally at full health and mana most of the time so your window to pvp as much as possible is a lot more open than others classes who are constantly eating/drinking.
---
Hahaha there is no “Windows way.” That’s just called *the way.*
---
Oh, I see ! Makes sense so it should be equally bad for people are in european part of Russia as well. 
---
Shame we can't fix it anyhow.
---
Indælt
---
I'll try to make testing happen. I really want the answers too. I'll keep you posted
---
Lol is this guy serious?  
---
"Sorry but I have life..."  
---
No dude, you obviously don't.
---
Destro spec is ridiculous on horde side with good gear. Since nobody has WoTF, you can just run around with a succubus and **Seduce &gt; Soulfire &gt; Immolate &gt; Conflagrate &gt; Seduce &gt; Shadowbolt &gt; Immolate &gt; Shadowburn &gt; Conflagrate**
---
Very few classes, if any, are going to survive that in gear like [THIS](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12aca6f80be4965f706a27dd51c62e929d004e0879979e7d32cbcee9460b56c95f2a6e5f5a664f68afe8032662d6247587ef643e61f73aac27db7bbe6c2fd12902b476185814b0e627f91467501673bebf52c99f91f5392769620a1821c750d985a1fc10c5641e349f96bd4d03ad1209ce78158b27981fc0c0fb642e5f7a4d66e068e2575e0104125280ccc468a9274e70e68bedce8f5a0c3282d8ee41ac1d62e278ebdaa14c8abb24268aea0bf697d738bb459cf4960f8f0ca36a8f5)
---
EDIT: Seeing as the poster felt he needed to delete his account, I'll preserve the rest of the conversation. It's not a matter of "right" or "wrong", it's a matter of taking things and saying "this is the only way". And that's not how things work out in a larger population.
---
&gt; So how many of the ret palas and moonkins was invited to raids? You have demonstrated that it can be done but how likely is it and how likely is it 2019 when everyone know they are doing less damage than the tanks.
---
In my experience, it's not dependent upon the spec, as much as the player. Again, that experience was a much broader player-base than all of the pservers combined, which *ever* operated.
---
I can go down any rabbit hole you throw out. Eventually you'll have some sort of "aha!" thing to disprove anything.
---
I can't say "how likely" it is in 2019, just the same way you can't say every raider in the game will be just like raiders on pservers.
---
But I do know a raid leader would rather take a dedicated sub-performance spec than someone specced and geared who hit two buttons, was consistently late, and didn't farm consumables.
---
My point still stands: Anyone wanting to do world firsts, realm firsts, or be in a dedicated, hard-core raiding guild - sure, and I agree.
---
*But* to say the words "you will never set foot in any raid otherwise" is total BS. It will more likely that you don't want to put in the work to do so.
---
Best of luck dude!
---
Now you can stop being grumpy at oceanic players.
---
We used to save WoW patches and then burn them on CD's because downloading the entire 800 mb patch was too expensive so we shares those CD's. It was a long process of updating the game several times, from 1.2 to 1.10 and possibly downloading the latest patch of 50-70 mb if we didn't burn it yet
---
I got to 60 without 1 single add-on. I was shit as well
---
Give me my unarmored mounts so the dankest troll shaman i know can buy me my ivory raptor!
---
Ahh gotcha
---
Out of all the features people are complaining about, I see zero complaining about achievements.
---
No clue, it seems fairly chaotic and disorganized. I just caught it on discord yesterday. There's no real announcement, no website.
---
All I've heard is 6pm GMT is an alliance classic duelling tournament on asmongold and esfands stream. So I'll check in at that time and see what is going on.
---
This works about as well as "Copy paste to 10 people within 10 minutes or your mother chokes on a metal cock in her sleep!"
---
The only thing triggered here was the gun your father put in his mouth after realizing what kind of child he brought into this world.

Oh my gawwwwwwwwdddddddd
---
If the rumors of a switch mini are true then I could buy one of those and hack my day 1 switch and turn it into a wow machine. You have any guides on how that works?
---
Horde is doing another tournament? They had one a while ago already.

The only reason I am not on Linux is because the majority of games are on windows. I don’t just play WoW and it’s still too much of a hassle to swap from windows to Linux. If there was better compatibility I would swap.
---
There’s no 100% perfect solution.
---
One or two more steps in the right direction over the next 60 days would be nice, but it appears pretty solid as-is.
---
I’m willing to accept a bit of exploitation by selfish players in order to help guarantee me a healthier server population a year from now. Said a different way, I don’t want to gamble my long term server population to try to clamp down on smaller and smaller levels of exploitation during the launch months.
---
As long as warden plays friendly with it, I will be running the game in Linux for both myself and my wife.
---
Seems you're the butthurt one downvoting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
100 dps is a lot
---
no one cares about what you did in retail vanilla.  everyone has a story like yours
---
you dont know anything about raiding so you should keep quiet about it
---
Nah. We need layering at launch.
---
I'm looking forward for:
---
- Why can't I tame this bear?
---
- I'm a Druid, idiot!
---
eh?  i didnt
---
Imagine playing without Addons tho
---
Hunters fall off pretty hard in Naxx. I've out damaged some of our hunters on a couple of fights and i'm an Elemental Shaman. They are skilled hunters too. I don't always beat them, mind you, but it does happen sometimes.
---
Well this just took a crap on my heart
---
It's still a uncommun notion now !
---
But in WoW we trust!
---
Generating threat isn't too bad. Make sure you're in defensive stance.
---
Don't use Thunderclap. Battle Shout is better. If you can charge in and you're fury, charge, battle shout, get into defensive stance.
---
Revenge is your best low level threat generator, however it's only available after a block. So use Shield Block, then Revenge. And use Revenge whenever it's available. Shield Block+Revenge costs the same as a Sunder, and it generates more threat and has the added bonus of reducing incoming damage.
---
You probably won't have any more rage available so just keep shield blocking and revenging. If  you have extra rage for some reason, throw sunders on enemies.
---
If your DPS is disciplined and only attacks one target, you'll have an easy time. If they're all attacking different enemies it's more difficult.
---
Taunt puts you at the top of the threat list temporarily, but you have to hit the enemy to turn that temporary threat into permanent threat. If you're the one at the top of the threat list, it's a waste of a taunt.
---
If you taunt fails, go into Battle Stance, use Mocking Blow and get back into Defensive.
---
Clear MC first week ROFL
---
I put groups together for this exact reason - selfishly inviting players of other armor types. That said, I try to be mindful of prioritizing the group to have only 2 players of one competing type of gear - Hunters and Warlocks level quicker outside of dungeons so I don't feel as bad stacking mail or cloth in groups as they'll grow early level gear quickly. Just my approach!
---
Hey, if you were all going to play for a year, that's almost 5 days of toilet paper costs at the Blizzard HQ in Irvine!
---
I think you will be one of the few person to migrate to French servers and are not French citizen :-D Good on you, best of luck :)
---
I'd bet there will be at least one MC first week
---
Thrall was really the only one tortured and beaten. The rest of them were so far into withdrawal they didn't fight or even move much. They didn't even keep many guards at most of them because the orcs would just sit there staring at the walls. 
---
Now Blackmoore was filth. Poor Thrall.
---
Where exactly?
---
&gt;all group content is more difficult to complete because the player skill is so much lower
---
Playing on a PvP server doesn't immediately make you good at the game - what are you even trying to say here? I've seen just as many tryhards and just as many noobs on PvP servers as I have on PvE servers.
---
You're probably getting downvoted for spreading false and ignorant information. If anything, PvE servers would clear MC **faster** than PvP servers. Unless the server was 100% dead, there's no way it would take 6-8 months to down MC.
---
Duo level with smite build together with a Ret paladin who has sanctity aura. :)
---
Mettmann is actually a town in German. Mettmänner are male people from that town.
---
Yeah I get that, but that doesn’t mean that after this first week every server will be low on pop. 
---
So after this first week, if the server is full you get a queue ?
---
Fino.
---
Ahah quello è vero, ma sono sicuro che certe cose non fossero esclusiva delle guild italiane
---
I use arch btw.
---
I will be, though currently running Win 7, haven't decided what distro I'll be going with yet.  
---
Either Linux Mint Cinnamon or Arch.
---
Most of the time, that 1 ret pally spot is going to a long term guild member or personal friend of the of the GL.
---
If you are a random ret paladin applying to good guilds, I wouldn't expect that to work for you.
---
IIRC Pats video was made in the few days where warriors could get 52 talent points due to a bug and could get deathwish + mortal strike.
---
That's going to exist in Classic?
---
Solid choice mate. Duo leveling is always more fun:)
---
There will be tons of account sharing to get that 24 hour play time in.
---
Most hunters are huntards, but a great hunter in a dungeon group is amazing. Play what you want to play, just learn and be good at it.
---
You're 100% correct. If you just "tanked" mobs you'd get murdered early on. Some packs were like 6 elites (Slave Pens and Shadow Labyrinth come to mind just for how many times we did them) and cc's were mandatory.
---
Warriors aoe was non-existent compared to druids and paladins too. I was so jealous.
---
Yes but that self-deprecating from blizzard them selves. Deprecation from a third party is a different matter these days
---
ELI5? Does this mean that if I am kiting, it is more beneficial to backpedal because it won’t add  range to the mob’s attack?
---
I’m confused by what the leeway means for us as players
---
\&gt; probably shadow for easier leveling 
---
Yep, you're in the right direction. You get the shadowform late in the game though, it's the 31st talent in the shadow tree but before that you will have an easy time leveling and also great kit for mitigating damage (Power Word: Shield, Renew). You also have aoe fear for when you aggro too many mobs, mind soothe so you safely pass around mobs you don't want to deal it and fade to lose aggro in dungs.
---
Couple of tips: 
---
Get a good wand and put your first 5 talents in wand specialization, then start on the shadow tree. Your fights will basically be dot dot and wand. If you decide to level professions and decide to be an enchanter at lvl 5 and 10 enchanting skill you can make a Lesser Magic Wand with which killing mobs will be like a walk in a park. Or you can simply buy the mats and ask a fellow enchanter to make it for you.
---
You might have to heal in dungeons sometimes, but don't worry, even if you're shadow specced you can heal dungeons no problem while leveling. Do not use Power Word: Shield on the tank. It hinders them gaining rage. You can shield the dps if they get aggro, or yourself.
---
Now, let's continue complaining about not having an RP-PvP server. Because I really really want one~☆
---
There's no way we're related to those guys.
---
I'd go with Orc warrior and orc shaman because shamans are very fun to play. More fun for your wife = more fun for you.
---
30/0/21 Ele/Resto is pretty good for raid environments too, even as a healer.
---
Horde Priest in Album: https://imgur.com/a/HMHvQ3O
---
Basta sceglierne uno e andare tutti la come si fece nel 2004, non serve avere una lista infinita di server su cui giocare. Inoltre, siccome gli abbonamenti saranno condivisi, non vedo perché molti utenti retail nom debbano provare classic. Mi aspetto un bel po’ di gente, almeno per i primi giorni.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that this is client prediction code and not server code, which has final adjudication on everything. The leeway could have been active server side but not client side, which would allow leeway for higher ping players but not for lower ping players.

Not remotely true on epic class quests. Really only needed a few cleric epics.  The rest were nice but not mandatory.  Once velious hit most went into the bank only to be used for your 1.5 and 2.0 in omens.  Like 3 better daggers in velious for rogues though it made a good offhand for the atk and haste. Bocs, sods for warriors , pal/sk have lots of weapons and do garbage melee anyway with original skill caps.  NEC/dru clicks didn't land on raid mobs.  Vog was better than speed so enc epic wasn't really needed.  Mag pets were a goddamn liability and without lure spells or bane spells like wizards they mostly mod rodded and cothd.  Mnk/bard were fantastic for a long time but not particularly hard.  
---
What really got em twisted was that damn VT and emp keys in luclin the first time.  Finding 10 shards from random mobs throughout luclin was a pain until the guides came out.  Vt was a buggy mess with collision issues .  the wardens were dting the zone from the first door because Sony was grossly incompetent at testing these things before launch.
---
I've yet to have a bad experience in the 5-6 different raid guilds I've been in with Loot Council. I have had a few with DKP just because the rules are too lax.
---
You can have solid rules and guidelines that the guild knows about in a LC as well to handle that 100% vs 60-70%. But I agree that a solid regulated DKP system can be very beneficial as well.
---
No one likes French Canada; not even French Canadians.
---
I was genuinelly wondering
---
No one will expect it, though.
---
&gt;Nah, the dps of a good ret will be ahead of bad fury warrior (i know because we had both in our guild) 
---
That seems unlikely. If a fury warrior just presses Bloodthirst and Whirlwind every time they're off cooldown, he will be miles ahead of a tryhard ret who optimizes his performance with stuff like timing max rank Consecration with Vengeance procs.
---
If you're playing a fury warrior, you would have to be unbelievably bad at positioning to do worse than a ret. Yeah, if the fury warrior deliberately walks into every patch of fire he sees because it looks pretty, I wouldn't take him over a ret. That's not a very likely scenario though.
---
Ha
---
LK Heroic was incredibly easy mechanics wise. Limited attempts and the artificially tuning circumvention with the 0-&gt;30% buff was basically what made the fight difficult. The health of adds, valkyr and LK aswell as the enrage timer just felt pulled out of a hat.
---
That's the way the world is now. It doesn't matter what you are saying. What matters now, is how people FEEL about what you are saying.

---
If it was in vanilla, you probably wouldn’t have noticed it because of internet quality back then.
---
before the 13th even, you need to get your name reserved.
---
i don't think so. hear me out.
---
ret paladin: increasing mana would not resolve its low dps. what this spec needs is an instant damage attack (a pala version of mortal strike).
---
prot pala: needs taunt ....... would then become viable but still not better than warrior, but probably better for trash tanking and some bosses where aoe is involved (kind of like tbc). however it would make it VIABLE, just not the best tank.
---
enh shaman: yes. mana would fix this one. a better solution would actually be to reduce the maan cost of his spells instead of increasing the mana of the whole class. maybe a reduction to his stormstrike cd from 20 to 18, or reduce it by 1 sec for each windfury proc.
---
elem shaman: mana. pure mana. this class is actually not bad at damage but they oom way too fast and are left with nothing. either reduce mana cost for lightning bolt and chain lightning (preferable solution), or give the spec a spell to get mana back, similar to mage's evocation or lock's life tap. how about a totem that consumes all totems and restores instantly 10% of mana + 5% for each totem used in the last 2 minutes.
---
Spriest: all about mana. reduce the mana cost of swp mind blast and mind flay.
---
bomkin: need a readjustment on its damage numbers. and most of all a reduction to his form switching. btw the druid class was meant by blizzard design to be played as a hybrid that keeps shape shifting, by that sense they want the class to have hybrid gear that had agility strength intellect stamina and keep switching forms during battles (whether dungeons, raids or pvp) to put hot on players, then switch melee to reposition or kill a low target, then switch to casting when you put distance away. but then they gave his shapeshifting abilities like 500 mana cost if not more which made all this impossible
---
hunter: needs a separation between arcane shot and aimed shot cooldown, and have both pets and arcane shot scale with hunter AP.
---
Feral druids: for tanking they need a cooldown. 1 strong 3 minute cooldown would suffice. for dps they need a re-tuning for their damage numbers to put them around 10-25% behind rogues.
---
Orc warrior / shaman. Can tank/heal/dps. It's a ton of fun. Solid group material. Just do it.
---
Some people consider being stronger fun. My point was that on horde side, pretty much everything except undead warrior can be considered best in one way or another.
---
Best I've got so far: https://imgur.com/a/HMHvQ3O
---
I'll probably do another class today. Any requests?
---
Average time, according to WoWhead, to get to level 60 is 12 days /played. Let's say the person is above average and only takes 10 days. That comes out to playing 2 hours every single day for 12 weeks to hit 60.
---
I was going to ask what language this is because it looks nightmarish. Those "V16" etc variable/function/whatever names make my eye twitch. Going through old legacy PL/SQL with names like that is bad enough. I can't fathom the headache of trying to keep all these "V" things straight. Even if you have an IDE that can mouseover and tell you, why wouldn't you have simple, descriptive naming conventions?
---
I'm ignorant to a lot of things in this world, particularly in development, so this might be a super novice question.
---
You do
---
True, but on of the first ones crafted on my vanilla server Azgalor, gave TF to a hunter who spammed rank 1 wing clip and murdered people. Twas a good meme.
---
Nice. I don't wanna be playing with anyone that doesn't know English. BREXIT means BREXIT.
---
So what part of it shows discrimination, prejudice, or mentions superiority over a race? Did I miss something?
---
Good call.
---
Thank you, I agree :). 
---
Warrior probably, but also considering Warlock. It depends on what the rest of the crew picks. 
---
What about you?
---
I suck at pvp
---
11 years, 1000 hours /played
---
Still can’t get a flag return with my kid
---
Reworked talents from day 1. Late itemization in from day 1. Greater knowledge of class/spec/gear mechanics. Near-complete knowledge of raid encounters. Players with 15 *years* of experience playing raids with actual mechanics. Better internet instead of dialup, 60-240 fps instead of 5-30.
---
Is it even possible to underestimate it if you played in vanilla?
---
Supply and demand is going to be the important factor.
---
If I can fill a raid with mostly mages, rogues, warlocks and warriors, I will. If thats not possible, I will grab a few of the weaker classes.
---
Will they get the legendary neck is the real question
---
Razorgore is only challenging when everyone has low gear and you have to set up some kind of strategy. You can just face roll kill every add when you have the dps and it isnt hard to get. 
---
The pug i see on private server usually don't have much difficulties with Razorgore. On Vael, there is always some idiot to over aggro when you are in pug but it isnt a hard fight either. Most pugs end up being stuck in the suppression room and bloodlord because this require good coordination.
---
how long are those fights lasting and how geared are those raids?
---
Someone is paying for it.  Nothing is free.
---
If you keep it constructive
---
If you go full /r/fuckepic or /r/dankmemes with full hate and no good reasoning you'll just alienate the devs and make them ignore everything you say
---
Thank you very much for this. :D
---
I play in EU, so cant help you there. But upvote for visibility and I hope you will find some good mates for the game!
---
Trying to decide between playing a gnome rogue or a gnome warlock. I played an undead rogue back in the day and loved it, especially for world PVP and all the stealth shenanigans. Want to do something different this time so decided to roll alliance and I think gnomes are pretty cool. 
---
My brain is telling me Gnome warlock would be the optimal choice due to expansive mind. Also, I really like the class fantasy of warlock and the thought of playing a small gnome that keeps getting more and more powerful stacking stamina and int in the late game. The only issue is that I don't have as much time to play these days and it will probably take a long time to get to that point.
---
My heart says gnome rogue. Although it's not as optimal, I think it would be really fun and I would enjoy the process of leveling and getting to the late game more. 
---
Any thoughts welcome.
---
Reminds me of trying to tame ghost howl. After hours finally finding him just to learn he’s untamable
---
Rogues can bleed kite with crippling poison. Tbh a decent rogue should kill a warrior 9 times outta 10 with cooldowns up.
---
I might roll prot pally again, its such a niche spec. I am only gonna be doing 5 mans and offtanking anyway even if I were a warrior. 
---
And oh man PvP is fun as a prot pally. Wsg flag running, ab defending, av tanking the npcs, and most people arent expecting that spec and arent prepared to fight it. I love starting out encounters healing and having a melee dps switch to me.
---
It will happen. It will be rare but it will 100% happen, with more than just 40 people working together to achieve that.
---
Moonkin is the poop. It's fun to land huge starfires so maybe try it once you're geared to the teeth.
---
Hoto/Resto 0/30/21 is a solid pick for Druids and can be used in all content. BGs, raid healing. It's such a great spec.
---
Why? I'd see that as a perfect opportunity to learn Spanish
---
Thank god. Now I don’t have to deal with some people randomly starting to write their own language in group/raid chat, just because they see some other guy being from the same country. This usually happened especially with German and French people.
---
Except it's not, I mainly do .net/sql server performance, often for large clients with business critical infrastructure.  Scalability is crucial in my lines of work, which is made easier when you're not hammering your servers for stupid reasons.
---
There is a Horde Mage version in my ablum, created by U/Qeliasq: https://imgur.com/a/HMHvQ3O
---
Play the mage. I’ve rolled classes to “fit the group” for others a few times now and when it doesn’t pan out because someone quits or someone isn’t online etc. you’ll be left annoyed that you didn’t roll your first choice of class. Resolve the gear by taking turns and obviously priest gets priority on spirit heavy gear, etc. less of an issue than not playing the class you like best.
---
I support local language realms, for the single reason that people who desperately want to talk in their native language are gone from my international server. Still, international/EU servers should be open to anyone, and russian players should be allowed to play on them too, possibly with the english client / latin character names only. 
---
Everyone being like 'lol ruski english suxx' please play on your local potato realms too.
---
I haven't had warmode on since i first leveled the opening week of bfa. Apparently in the new 8.2 zones, the alliance main hub is camped most of the time. You port in and arrive dead.
---
Will be really interesting to see how they try and fix it. They offered a really nice quest reward for alliance once, but there was so much crying they're scared to do it again. 
---
Every day it stays like this, it just snowballs further and further. Alliance players that actually want world pvp can't complete quests. No amount of bonus whatever will help because you can't complete them in the first place. Horde players that don't care for world pvp turn it on anyway because it's free 10% bonus. There's no alliance so they don't have to worry.
---
Ty
---
This post caused me to spray coffee all over my work desk. Well done, you deviant.
---
Money doesn't grow on trees (unless you're a herbalist, I guess)
---
They wouldn't want it to happen, but it definitely happens 😛. You can only do so much with client prediction and compensation.
---
Tbh I love bows, but Ive played hunter too much on retail, so I want to try something new c:
---
Probably gonna level up rogue and then warrior or priest as a second character
---
Check my album: https://imgur.com/a/HMHvQ3O
---
I'll continue to add classes when I have the time to make more.
---
Hey mate, any updates on loot distribution style?
---
I also noticed that you haven’t advertised on the more recent threads (at least under PvE). Has something else changed?
---
would 1 gold cover the cost ? either way i'd school you for free in classic :P
---
Well, no they're not just like priests, as mentioned previously. Priests don't have the utility druids do.
---
Are you saying that all the other healers are on par with each other evenly? How would you rank them? Purely in healing?
---
The battle itself? She was in ICC, just not fighting the Lich King. Storywise we took ICC in a single bloody battle. There was tons of people at various sections, with the implication they were holding back the scourge forces.
---
If you've not seen it. [Here](https://youtu.be/ZaJluSlVhKU?t=416) is her speech when you give her locket back to her after finishing shadowmourne. Its quite touching, like all the speeches from the various characters Arthas personally interacted with throughout his journey to become the Lich King.
---
I'd be on about 9pm est to midnight est. would that fit your schedule? I like the idea of joining a guild! I'll definitely let you know brother.
---
\&gt;  Within Classic though she's a lifeless NPC. Nothing really there. 
---
The reason for that is because Classic isn't about Jaina... it's about the adventurer's journey. The game should have never shifted attention to the NPCs.
---
Est is 2 hours later so id be 11pm so no :(

I plan on running it in Lutris. I have a full pass through setup as a backup, but I've actually found retail runs better in wine than in Windows (0.o). Probably because WoW is a cpu bound game so the performance loss from pass through cpu emulation means more than gain from gpu performance.
---
Once Classic hits, raiding guilds will form just fine. You will quickly be able to find one on the server you're on. It's just that pre-launch raiding guilds is more of a PvP thingie.
---
Hoto/resto is the ultimate hybrid spec. Your cat does stuff, you can switch to bear and feral charge and maul things, and with hoto you get 20% more int which is a huge boost to your healing power. Healing you do the usual. Rank 4 healing touches, Regrowth/Rejuv in emergencies. This is the true Druid spec in my eyes. It can do everything decently, but when played well, you're impossible to kill.
---
This is cute.
---
I was twelve at the time. English was hard enough, but I do credit wow for helping me learn this language.
---
aww tha makes me a sad panda. I just work a 9-5 and my lovely ladyfriend likes to hangout from 5-9 or so. I don't want to completely ruin my life xD
---
happy for you EU
---
Quello che intendo é che dubito possa esserci un server dove la maggior parte della popolazione sia italiana
---
Yea I’m a couple hours behind you so that’s probably be perfect. I’m military and my schedule gets me decent amount of time off as well. Rolling Gnome Mage so if you roll Dorf Priest we’d roll in the same starting area. I’ll bring the mana biscuits!
---
Spot on
---
Not really his fault. He's generating 20% more threat per damage than rogues and fury warriors around him and pulls aggro \~20% easier than the range.
---
3.5Gb haha, that's about a 5 minute download for most of us, back then Oh lord...better to just go out to dinner and wait
---
Take me
---
I think you'll find that most gold sellers would use bots to spam, and not sit and read replies. There are of course exceptions where someone is literally typing it out, and maybe responding, but what are you odds at a "hit" here?
---
Dump her. Lol
---
Man I member trying to patch this game on 50kbps internet. The green dot turns yellow and then you wait a week to play.
---
I rolled in vanilla on a PVE server. I loved PvP it was the main reason I played the game. I ranked 14 while also in a guild that held every server first through into TBC.
---
I played PvP servers for longer post TBC content. I was never the guy ganking low levels or even attacking players on sight unless they were from known guilds / pvp players. To me this seemed a douche move, I never respected any player ganking lowbies or griefing. Im not saying this playstyle was wrong but I didnt play like this. As a hunter I should be trying to hit first but I mostly let people do whatever they were doing anyway and didnt aimmed shot people in the back because they got to a node first. Back to my PvE server there was always PvP too be had every day either at popular places such as southshore or anywhere you wanted to start it. It would only take attacking some town gaurds and people would come to defend / help attack and soon there would be zergs of both factions.
---
Maybe I was lucky with my server community but I much prefered this pvp to random ganks while trying to farm reputation or resources. I appriecated being able to relax and pay less attention while farming pirates and such. So while I'm still not sure what I will play in classic still my experiance with PvP on a none PvP server was fun and always there when I wanted it. Unlike what most people seem to be saying here.
---
Bring 20 warriors and throw away half your drops. This is surely the strategy that will be  employed by any serious guild!
---
Stop listening to parrots on this sub. If you want to play a hunter you will find a guild to raid in if you arent really bad.
---
Yeah arcane Frost is the most boring spec in the game. You're specced into Frost without any of the fun and useful Frost talents like shatter and iceblock. The spec is just awful to play imo. Fire has pyro, blastwave and just sick dmg overall.
---
Well, true it doesn't have an internal cooldown in 1.12, but it can't proc off any source of extra attacks, including from HoJ and ironfoe.  Also, no one has been able to get an ironfoe in Classic wow, while private servers have its proc rate all over the place.  A lot of unknowns absolutely worth testing!
---
And I'm glad you mentioned threat.  The third component as to why enhance is just not good for raids (aside lack of sustain and overall mana longevity problems).  An enhance's bread and butter is storm strike and earth shock combo.  Earth shock doesn't apply a debuff which is great, but it generates a metric fuckton of threat, which is very very bad. And of course the fact storm strike itself is a debuff which has no other raid synergy aside maybe helping a tank generate more threat with TF procs? But man that is a stretch.
---
So many mechanical issues with enhance shamans in a raid PvE setting the more you look into it, the worse it gets.  But for solo, leveling, 5 man instance or even some small group pvp they are perfectly fine.  The unpredictable burst is often beneficial in those scenarios, but that is the exact opposite of what you want in raid pve.
---
It's not a error I'm familiar with. I didn't have it. My friends didn't have it. I used to work in a videogame wholesale company at that time, I don't remember there being any returns with that specific error.
---
after the rampage of german boomers in the official forums I can imagine that Blizzard said fuck that they didnt want to deal with that haha
---
I agree, not every spec has to be a raid spec, that's part of the beauty of classic
---
Warriors on alliance can get bless of salv
---
Greater heal is a bit slow, but heals for so so much.
---
Make sure the enemies can't see you, or can't interrupt you if you're casting it.
---
Do you think Holy/Reck will be anywhere near ass effective in classic as it is in pservers without sit crit triggering working?
---
Most peeps just enjoy the friendlier and more mature atmosphere on RP servers. While many may not RP, my experience is that most will try to not break immersion if they get approached in /s. I won't in any case although I will not RP in general chat or guildchat.
---
I will however be one of the many characters real RPers can converse with in the world and I will stay in character for them.
---
They mean raiding dude
---
that sounds awesome! I'm usually off at 5pm my time, but the ladyfriend (yeah this guy sexes) likes to hang until about 9pm my time. Dorf Priest was one of my main ideas actually! This sounds awesome. Is the idea to roll main with friends and alt by yourself? or the other way around.
---
Yeah, Tipout hosted a tourney at lvl 30, now someone is doing another horde tourney for lvl 40
---
I used to seat and watch this slowly fill up as a kid with our shitternet back in 2006.
---
For sure, there are the couple stray gameplay mechanics from retail that are interesting, but the sum of the whole is just terrible in comparison for someone who is interested in Vanilla/Classic WoW. Its just too different, too "hand everything on a silver platter" style dare I say "mobile shovelware" esque.
---
Remember Camp Taurajo.
---
BFA has WoW tokens - Classic does not (and hopefully never does.)
---
There will be people that are great gold farmers, but may not have the extra funds for a WoW sub. I can guarantee you that these players will find some person/entity/guild that will transfer gold back and forth... unless Blizzard bans it, of course. 
---
This kind of activity was super popular on OSRS and RS3 back in the day.
---
Feral is probably the best hybrid DPS though, along with Shadow, and actually has a high skill cap making this possible. Even pretty hardcore guilds might take them (1 per raid). 
---
Other hybrid DPS cannot reach even average DPS for their gear level, regardless of player skill. Both because they're just that weak, and because they're extremely simple.
---
If your only warrior negative is consumables, go warrior.  I'm sure you can find a casual guild where a million consumables aren't required.  You'll also have yourself a designated pocket healer in your priest friend if you plan to PVP and will have a perfect starting set up for any 5 man content with a healer, tank, and hard CC.  
---
You could also consider druid, as it'll hit some of the warrior and rogue bits at the same time while not being quite as great at either.
---
shes a doctor and blonde and beautiful and smart. Im a washed up baseball player who is now a designer/photographer. Shes way out of my league xD
---
hmm...you will probably see about 35-40 people (not all level 60) clear mc within about a week or so
---
Pally or shaman if my main goal is to heal in pvp pugs and premades
---
Writing gold farming bots is fun too.
---
Yes. I had to copy my friends wow folders.
---
I am not saying they are all exactly on par, nor that that is required. However, in many cases I think the difference is too large.
---
You know one class contributes less when they are consistently brought in lower numbers than others by people who know what they are doing. Yes, druids do have utility, but not enough to make up for the difference in healing output and flexibility that priests and paladins have.
---
That's the beauty of it. If you want to speak English, you can.  And hey, German accent isn't bad. It's understandable. I'll answer with my Finnish Ralli-English accent.
---
You figured that an entire country’s economic problems &amp; labor laws would just like -resolve overnight?
---
Not too concerned with an alt for a while. After I hit 60 I might roll a Druid.
---
Yellow light was my life dude.
---
Yes, that quest.
---
You can use many specs and classes to kite in gluth, no need to gimp a top dps by having them spec Frost.
---
Its better to dump her now before she realizes.  That way you can play more wow
---
People definitely talked about it back then.
---
Lol. It's ok. The guy who corrected you messed it up again anyway.
---
Its quite possibly that these haters are in fact straw-men that don't exist. I read or hear literally every day to play whatever you want and don't let anyone tell you not to. Yet I cannot remember the last time the opposite was true.   
---
Maybe the "fear" is coming from the idea that you're not playing as well as you could under the optimal circumstances. And considering its a team-oriented game its easy to start to doubt if playing a suboptimal build is really worth it because you'd be wasting peoples time otherwise.
---
Most likely this boogeyman is created from a couple of elitists, and peoples anxiety at being a burden upon others.
---
I figured they had figured a way to block people from that region of the world from playing on na servers by now.
---
Spellbatching simulates bad latency. In its current state it's actually worse than in vanilla.
---
You can't have one without the other.
---
I was just thinking so that one of us doesn't out level the other. I dont know how easy it is to do that.
---
True but having a wolf is better anyway. Not a cast and you cant get dreadsteed phase 1. Also orcs in nemesis look sick.
---
You have no reason to believe they’re not gonna do whatever they can to avoid phasing
---
Level 1 - Shadowbolt spam
---
Level 60 with high end raiding gear - Shadowbolt spam
---
2-59 - Sweet, gooey affliction.
---
I will use Shadowbolt as an opener if the enemy mobs are too strong for the DOTs to kill.
---
Of course, but here is the magic of 40 people. You have to bring in noobs, low gear bois and second class specs because they are better than nothing.
---
Raptors are super underrated.
---
Tons of upfront damage from bite/claw combo.  Shame you can't get the WC black raptors to go stealth like in TBC.
---
hmm..true. but shes real nice
---
This escalated quickly
---
Thank you for this PSA.  
---
You started this Horde, don't forget.
---
Quest helpers, bah! Read the text and figure it out.
---
Honestly, you shouldnt get a mentor friend that will teach you everything. You'll get his version of wow and what it means. You should start alone and be a noob and shape your own version of wow
---
They were both things that the community wanted that weren't going to be in classic.
---
Thanks for making me type this out I appreciate it
---
Hoard never put anyone in camps, think they are safely in the right on most issues.  But good job for catching the subtext of the story! You seem to have missed a turn along the way tho, Lmao
---
Seems like you're more PVP-oriented, so you might be glad to hear, that most of the top classic rogues actually rate gnome rogue as the best race choice on Alliance side.
---
Hope that helps with your decision.
---
No wonder so many players went alliance.
---
They wanted a piece of that cute nelf booty.
---
I agree, but I bet if we had gotten to the Tauren first they would have joined us.  Taurens and Dwarves usually get along fairly well, even on pvp servers.  We can trade you the gnomes.
---
It’s bound to happen. Worst case it helps with carrying people through dungeons.
---
If u want to play on a German EU server, feel free to join me and about 2-3 other friends :)
---
Alright fine.  Gl with your hunt. Id try and find a warrior to play with
---
I would usually agree with you, but I think my reasoning for wanting a mentor friend is not so much to learn, but to always have good company
---
I didn’t have any issues installing, but I did have a unique error where there was a specific section of searing gorge that if I ran into it my game would crash and it was actually impossible for me to log in to that character. When I found it I had to have a friend log in and move me, and I made a permanent mental note where that spot was.
---
The only other issue I had was in BWL in Nef’s room. If I faced my camera to look out over the ledge of the room, I would crash and couldn’t log back in until I died. Quite an issue to overcome when you are the MT, but once I figured out the issue I successfully tanked it every time.
---
I only found out by accident a few months ago. Probably because I don't read or follow much gaming media much... i just like playing games.
---
I think we as a community should do more to get the word out.
---
If you're showing up in pre-bis with full consumables you're not an average player.
---
that makes sense! I'll try to keep up with you if I can xD
---
And it will go, just as soon as the population finishes dropping. Until then it's necessary.
---
I'm somewhat torn between Warlock and Rogue. I prefer warlock for most things, such as the safer combat distance and the potential for soul shard utilities, but I love stealth mechanics across all games (including WoW, and especially for PvP) and the monetizable potential of lockpicking is attractive to me. 
---
With all of that in mind, what are some good resources to look at to decide between the two?
---
(playing both is a possibility, but not at first - I want to get a character to 60 before playing an alt)
---
I'm watching these retail videos and thinking to myself. Dafuq is that game? Is that wow?
---
Mage, Rogue, Warlock, or Warrior?
---
Super casual.  If I ever get to 60 end game for me is dungeons and Onyxia.  If I go Warrior I will end up tanking as that is what happens when I play a tanking capable class on retail.
---
thanks man. I appreciate it. best of luck enjoying your wow time!
---
I think the people who are asking others to stop complaining about X are tired of people who only say "fuck layering," as opposed to people who provide reasonable discussion.
---
dps refrains from attacking... yeah right
---
An ancient repost from over a month ago
---
Nobody asked for Australian.
---
I agree with that you'll get a better experience by going in blind. 
---
You'll find good company along the way. There will be plenty of social/leveling guilds for you to join.
---
AN ANCIENT REPOST FROM OVER A MONTH AGO
---
Level 1, vendor all your starting items except dagger. Buy Immolate. 
---
1-59... :D
---
Dk + monk
---
They need shards !
---
Traffic going out of Australia is far more expensive than traffic inside of Australia. Not hosting a server in Sydney would actually be more expensive for them.
---
Yes, that's what makes druids so great! If you need healing, they can throw on a healing set and heal. If you need them as dps, they can stay feral.
---
Their utility is still there no matter what they do (with sone limits for tanks ofc)
---
It is for speed runs, which will be the meta for top guilds
---
Regarding twitch emotes, if you get the add-on you see the pictures so it's easier to follow if you're not familiar
---
Probably useful information for retail players who aren't used to ripping threat off the tank with heals/dps too early.
---
People LoS pull in retail too. Calm down.
---
My current plan is to play a hunter main.  Probably with herb/alch for the cash flow.  Maybe with mining/engineering for the feign death jumper cables and iron grenades.  I'll be playing semi-casual at probably around 2.5-3 hours a night about 5 nights a week. 
---
I'm still debating what to make my main alt.  I had been heavily considering mage but it sounds like leeway and instance resetting is going to put a big dent in the AOE/farming abilities of mage and drinking after each pull might get old real fast this is now one of my lowest considerations, but still a consideration.  I was also thinking about warlock, but they seem really squishy and pet management pvp wise for them seems like a real pain.  God willing we get TBC servers and can roll a class into it, this would also be one I want for that, but could always level it once that is announced.  I thought about warrior but I figure at my playtime it might be hard to ever get him the gear to be useful to anyone.  PVP looks challenging but fun.   I've really considered druid pretty hard as it was my main in WOTLK and I loved the dual spec and being able to swap between bear/tree and so thinking the 0/30/21 (or 1/29/21) spec looks like it could be great, but pvp on this sounds dreadful as it's just described as fights of attrition basically.  I also don't want to deal with farming those crowd pummelers and expect I'd rather fall back to healing in a raid than playing a cat dps (probably what they'd want anyways).  At this point though, this is still my highest consideration I think.  Lastly, I was thinking about paladin but it would mean locking me into alliance (had mostly been thinking horde for the stun resist on orcs for pvping).  I like the idea of never running out of mana while healing and think I could still enjoy PVP in a support role and appreciate not being as squishy since I'll still be pretty new to pvp.  If any of my IRL friends decided to join and specifically wanted to play an ally warrior then pally would jump up substantially on my list, but they're not currently planning to play. 
---
I've never played vanilla.  I expect I'll try to get into a casual raid guild if I can find one where our hours line up but will otherwise mostly do 5 man and BGs (once available).
---
Stealth will allow you to make big plays when needed if you’re playing solo with some luck
---
Even without it, fury warriors were still top DPS on 90% of fights in vanilla in my experience.
---
Exceptions being ranged heavy fights and/or ones with funky aggro mechanics.
---
You mean everyone started talking in its language and made so many posts blizzard had to cave in, right? Because nothing happened here on reddit.
---
I'll have to remember that.
---
No. It just means they can both get each other. You're not adding both to one circle. You're adding the same amount to two different circles.
---
gonna do that spec then, thank you. Are there some [these are the most important talents of the spec] talents? aside from well hotw and nature swiftness i guess?
---
After watching Preach I can say, for some strange reason, girls play priests and Druids. I think priest is a much simpler option for her. Shaman has a lot of totems to manage.
---
The thing about vanilla wow is that it pushes people to all interact with each other. As you play, you'll naturally be partying with other players and crossing paths constantly with other friendly wanderers as you naturally progress. As long as you're a decently friendly person yourself, you'll be making friends left and right as you casually stroll through.
---
If course, this doesn't mean you can't come up with friends outside the game beforehand. But you shouldn't feel obligated to find a mentor or anything like that, it's all gonna be just fine buddy.
---
They listened, thank you blizzard cant wait
---
Also worth consider, I believe warrior doesn't generate rage from taking damage while priest shielded.
---
I would consider Warlock. Pretty good solo class, solid at pvp, not overplayed.
---
I play(ed) on Zul'jin on retail and it's the unofficial NA French server for all of the Quebecoise and it's not terrible.
---
Half the names I don't recognize, the other half this list is absolutely warrented for.
---
Madseason and SmoothMcGroove I think are the only 2 I wouldn't mind if they are on my severs. And I think Madseason is an alliance player anyway so even better.
---
That sucks, I like the pfui.  Fuck me with a razor tipped donkey dick.
---
Tank meta changed to more dmg and less defensive stat to hold more threat so dps can go all out
---
more like start it up before bed and hope it's done when you wake up before school.
---
It's not about being camped. It's about not being able to get any quests done. If there's opposing faction members present, there's a good chance you'll just be dead because they don't wanna share quest mobs. The corpse runs in vanilla are pretty brutal. Even if you kill him, he'll just get buddies or a 60 friend to kill you. Yes, this can lead to some decent world PvP if you call friends and they come help you, but usually I'm not interested in that. I just wanna do my quests. 
---
If you come across a random lvl 60 during questing, 50/50 chance you're dead.
---
If you're at max level and you're say farming Dreamfoil or Plaguebloom because you need to make some gold, and there's an opposing faction member farming the same stuff and he has better gear than you or he's better than you, you're dead. 
---
It's just too much of a fucking pain. If I wanna PvP, I'll enter a battleground or turn on my PvP flag and see who bites.
---
The Layering they want to add absolutely destroys the server integrity that is one of the core aspects that makes vanilla better than their recent abominations.
---
absolutely never stop giving them shit about their shitty sharding please.
---
&gt;Yes, that's what makes druids so great! If you need healing, they can throw on a healing set and heal. If you need them as dps, they can stay feral.
---
Yes, and because of that people wanted resto druids. No one cares about a 3% crit aura, but the healing they provide while also still having all the other utility. Shamans had the similar problem. Resto Shamans STILL had basically every kind of support (except Windfury totem I believe? Don't remember) plus mana flood totem and a stronger chain heal. There was no reason to use an enhancement shaman at all.
---
And then after a while the French realms will be merged into the German ones.

---
My first alliance 60's name was "Entrance". I made the char long before honor system came out. Everyone got a good kick out of that.
---
I don't either. But I'd rather deal with that if the community can at least remain intact. There are other things to do in WoW than grind boars (despite what South Park may say).
---
And I don’t disagree with any of that.
---
If you want to play with good players you yourself need to be good, I think that should be self evident.
---
I’m (currently) in this semi-popular boat of spriest vs warlock. I’ll be PvPing plenty which from my understanding means roll spriest, but there’s this argument that it will be garbage in raiding which I might change my mind and want to do. 
---
The questions at hand: how inefficient is healing gear as an spriest in PvP? Are any PvE pieces BiS for both? Is it too much of a pipe dream to primarily heal my way to Rank 10 and then buy spriest gear?
---
Great news!
---
I want to play melee dps so I’m stuck between warrior and rogue. Will most likely be leveling with a Druid. Rolling a PvP server but I mainly do PvE, with a bit of BGs and world pvp sprinkled in. 
---
Warrior pros:
---
- can flex tank for dungeons, I love dungeons so being able to find a group quicker is very beneficial
---
- I like the ability to use a two hander AND one handers 
---
- endgame gods, crucial in raids whether I tank or dps
---
- plate armor is cool
---
Warrior cons:
---
- leveling (might be slightly offset by running with a druid) 
---
- weak in early game
---
- my only other max level was a DK in wotlk so it’s very similar experience
---
Rogue pros: 
---
- I’m running pvp server so I can start battles on my terms
---
- playing w a feral druid so maybe some synergy w stealth 
---
- engaging rotation, dynamic w poison applications, stuns, etc etc
---
- also very viable endgame, but less versatility than warrior
---
- lockpicking
---
Rogue cons: 
---
- competition for gear w the druid I’m leveling with
---
- hard to find dungeon groups
---
...
---
Let me know if there’s stuff that I’m missing, I need more info bc I’m still very undecided. Thanks guys
---
The good thing about this solution is that non-native English speakers that *want* to participate in an international community can still do so voluntarily by playing on English realms. It just keeps those players among themselves that would rather not speak English.
---
You can't learn immolate at level 1.
---
The two main differences I noticed when switching from pvp to pve back in BC was there is no ganking anymore and no big battles outside of raid entrances. There was still world pvp and city raids.
---
Is this a joke? are you trolling? if not, then yes, you should most definitely tell those guys to go pound sand.
---
I remember my friend buying a million gold from a Chinese chat spammer... the Chinese guy was asking him why he needs so much lol, that was in late vanilla
---
Ok, then by your definition of bug, layering itself is the bug, therefore it should be removed.
---
&gt; Quit acting like a 5 year old that dropped his ice cream cone.
---
Say that to all the retail players who will cry if they can't solo boars without any competition on launch day.
---
Ret was perfectly viable in tbc. They refreshed all judgements with crusader strike (mana/spellpower/healing) and gave 3% crit to everyone... I don't think it's the case in vanilla
---
But the fact that blizzard caved for one means if we talk about it enough and express want for it maybe they will add them back in.
---
Oh wow I didn't think about it that way. My preparations for hardcore hermit mode must accelerate!
---
Thank you, makes sense to me!
---
Thank you, appreciate the feedback.
---
Also got a question for you. Is there a reason you are respeccing to fury at level 40? Usually I see the opposite. Occasionally people will level fury and at 40 switch to arms for MS. Ive never seen a leveling path go from arms till MS then respec to fury to 40-60. Any reasoning behind this?
---
english is just french spoken by germans. switzerland has 4 main languages spoken throughout the country and they have been doing all right since forever. seperating the kurwas and the cykas would have been enough.
---
Confirmed as Human on Stress Test but some races start out with less food/drink.  Test it yourself, I wouldn't want to be responsible for seeing a naked Shadowbolting Level 1 Warlock ;)
---
But yea it's a nice little tip I picked up off a streamer...  not sure how much faster it is to be honest. If at all.
---
Little question on the side here: Do you need an active subscription to reserve the name?   
---
I don't have an active one and don't want to pay until classic launch (I KNOW!! I'm stingy, can't help it)
---
Multishots are reserved for when mobs mystically turn into sheep. I mean, sheep are the most dangerous creatures. But don't worry everyone... No sheep are getting past _this_ hunter.
---
So in practice, every month (probably every 4 weeks b/c raid resets) every raider parties up with an officer and goes 'Helm: /roll Neck: /roll' for each gear slot and each raid? Your officers will be thrilled. I think you'd need some sort of online tool on your guild homepage or something. Notably, most guilds struggle with having their raiders sign up for a raid two days in advance, which only takes a few clicks.
---
I kinda do like the idea to make it slot- and raid-based though. The way Classic is itemized, this creates little incentive to pass on a small upgrade.
---
I think you forgot to explain the part about BiS (as determined by loot council). Do some classes always get priority over others if it's 'BiS' aka a major upgrade for them, and a smaller upgrade for others? I'm thinking about Drake Fang Talisman and Hunters here.
---
Also, you will get to a point where people only need one or two items from MC. If they roll low in that slot, they know in advance that they probably won't get it this month, even if it drops. So motivation to show up for old content might be an issue.
---
Sounds like your cd drive was particularly picky about some types of discs.
---
Lol exactly. But hey, you gotta shit on those filthy retail players somehow right? /s
---
oh haha. i had a similar experience. I had a lone horde priest (i was alliance) come across me in duskwood. I was like level 25 or something, and he was 60 i think. I had the same "oh great. here we go again" type of dread go through me. But he decides to mind control me, then casts fortitude on me and then rides off into the sunset. i will always remember that.
---
Yeah I was thinking hunters would be great. Wasn’t sure if healers would have a bigger impact than dps.
---
Unfortunately Druid just isn’t my thing.
---
People on classic sub-reddit : play what you want !
---
Same people : shammies, priests , pallies and druids only heal in raids nub!
---
&gt; we speak American
---
Sounds like you dont even understand your own language (I know youre probably kidding).
---
[Nope, I definitely meant sudoku.](https://i.imgur.com/XFJpnKP.jpg)
---
I’m honestly thinking of making a toon on a French realm to help myself learn French
---
I knew about this site already, but seeing you link it I was like "hey let me see if any streamers have actually committed to a server yet." So I clicked through and see nothing but TBD....
---
In unrelated news my morning dose of Dumb Fuck Juice was delicious.
---
I used to do this.
---
In WOTLK I had:
---
idot - lock
---
ihot - drood
---
itott - rogue
---
ishot - hunter
---
isolot - dk
---
Ahh so itl give me the opportunity to find the win condition and make the play. Makes sense. Thanks!
---
Why spend money on advertisement when you can give free beta keys to popular streamers?  Activision always about that bottom line.
---
The idea that you wouldn't is completely *preposterous*.

This sub is toxic lol...  I'd say be very cautious about rolling PvE - I transfered a char from PvP once and immensely regretted it.  I still remember some battles I had in BC, it's worth the issues leveling unless you are totally against the idea of wpvp.
---
**Very undecided between rolling Warrior or Mage.**
---
**Warrior** fulfills my "Class Fantasy", being a bulky Warrior (Probably Orc or Human) in a badass looking armor, big shoulders, wielding a 2-handed weapon and charging people all day. However, Im a beginner, started playing in BFA for 4 months as DPS (Mainly as DH, but I also tested Warrior, Mage and Monk). I dont have the knowledge/experience of most players in Classic. And Im probably be playing solo, most of the time, cause my friends dont like mmorpgs anymore, maybe 2 of them are gonna play but its not guaranteed and they dont know which classes they are gonna roll. As I read through posts people say Warrior is the hardest class to level, the skill rotation (stance dance) is kinda tricky to learn, no escape skills, very gear dependent, needs a pocket healer on PvP to perform well, hard to farm gold, need to set up some macros, higher repair costs. Plus, ocasionally I would have to tank and Im bad at it. I had to tank in BFA as a DH, on those Timewalking Pandaria dungeons, to speed up the queue as I was farming the Water Strider with my friends and it was a shitshow. I didnt know which skills to use, how to hold aggro, generate threat, the dungeon route, etc... So Im kinda reluctant to start rolling a Warrior, get facerolled and have to reroll as Mage.
---
**Mage** would be my other choice because I like the skill animations, messing with Ice and Fire is cool. However I really dont like the Cloth armor sets, they look so ugly. Their weapons are not great either. Plus, the "optimal" races (Undead and Gnome) doesnt appeal to me... However, I read that Mages are a great "beginner class". One of the easiest Classes to level, easy skill rotation, great utility kit (water, food, portal), best aoe farming class, defense skills (ice barrier, blink, poly, nova), less mechanics to avoid in raid, better duel class, strong at BGs, cheaper pre-raid BIS, full DPS role. So Im also reluctant of rolling as a Mage, and end up unmotivated.. wanting to reroll as a Warrior because of the "Class Fantasy" issue.
---
**So how do I solve this dilemma?** I really wanna make up my mind before launch because I hate rerolling, feels like a waste of time. Speaking of time, I would be playing something like 3 hours a day or so.
---
Critical bug.  Classic delayed 30 days to fix + stress test.
---
It will almost certainly last past that. Blizzard is relying on the population to wither away within two weeks. If that doesn't happen, then layering will become permanent because Blizzard has backed themselves into a situation they can't get out of without intentionally splitting servers apart.
---
As a matter of fact I want to, but 4-5 people will be a problem, time schedule wise.  
---
My friends live on roughly the same schedule as me, that's what's unique. :/
---
Uhhh why would they ever do that?
---
&gt; Typical french. Giving up right away eh?
---
&gt; I gave up when I realized how incredibly rude french people are.
---
Good one, also we're not that bad you should make peace with your inner child. Cheers
---
With 2 h/day that'd be approximately 17 weeks and a day.
---
Regardless, it doesn't matter how many people are 60 by then or not. The argument should be about the sheer amount of hours of playtime it will have affected for people by then.
---
Yeah just went to double check and there's a 11 million difference about Russia between the number given on the french wikipedia and the english version, but doesn't change much of what I said anyway
---
Damn is that the announced date? It’s everyone with a current sub right?
---
will linux have layering?  I have an idea to fix layering on linux!
---
jk jk
---
Both so I’ll probably pick orc then
---
Close, but no cigar, it's in danish :/
---
True, but you can meet that fact by pinning the thread to the top of the sub for a certain amount of time.
---
Unless AT&amp;T has a corporate billing scheme way different than pretty much everyone else, Blizzard is only paying for usage, not distance.
---
Yeah, their options are 1) queues and 2) server migrations, like opening up RPPvP servers post-launch. I think they should do both. Put hard queues up, if there’s more than 3.5-4K people on, you have to wait to get in. And then, if people want to escape the queues, give them the option to transfer to new servers. If there were 10 NA servers, opening up two more would be enough to spread the population. 
---
I don’t think they’re gonna do that though. They’re probably just going to keep the layers rolling like sheets of ethereal wax paper, until 3 months have passed and they have to drop phase 2.
---
Exactly this.
---
remindme! 54 days
---
Oh yes! That! Also that. Faction specific. But doesn’t change otherwise.
---
Of all of her character development arcs, this is the one I also agree was handled (or a lack of handling?) the worst. It's like she broke off all ties with him before the culling of stratholme and then "nah nah nabooboo, I can't hear you" during his transition into LK and subsequent defeat.

I have been trying to put this into peoples heads since the great 16 debuff slot debate. Everyone thinks in order to have success you need to have a perfect comp with people playing non meme specs etc. and that is just false. 
---
I have raided Vanilla, yes it was 15 years ago, but I do remember the minimum effort people put into min/maxing in my guild, and we still cleared all relevant content (except for C'thuun and 4H in Naxx, but those were show stoppers for most guilds)
---
Knowing what we know today, mechanics and the fact I'm a better MMO player than years ago, I do suspect that I will find these raids super easy, and to your point, no need to min-max my Elemental Shaman.
---
It'll be hard for you to raid as feral dps.  If that's what you want to do, I'd say go rogue.  If you don't mind healing, druid is super fun.  Unless you want to use druid's whole toolkit as a true hybrid, you'll mostly feel like a gimped rogue.  
---
I personally will be rolling druid because I love the class fantasy and love the massive toolkit.  I also greatly enjoy healing in raids.
---
Anybody who didn't raid in Vanilla or BC is going to have a learning curve just like they do in any new expansion. You can look up boss fights but doing them properly is another thing entirely. I watched Method live stream kill M Jaina but that didn't mean I went in there and 3 shot her, it took us over 300 wipes even knowing precisely where to stand and how to do the fight. The average player will have to learn all the fights because watching someone else do it is different, and they will have to relearn how to manage their aggro and mana. MC will be relatively easy but starting from BWL people are going to fail a lot more than expected. They will not steamroll it like normal or heroic current raids. 
---
There are also twice the number of people in the raid which makes logistics much harder. It will never be as hard as it was in Vanilla, that's preposterous and basically like saying it's just as hard to build a car in 2000 as it was in 1910. But it will not be a cake walk for most guilds doing the content. You grossly overestimate how good the average retail player is. On private servers I'm amazed quite often at how bad some of the players are. 
---
Bozos are going to show up to raid in shit gear playing a spec they used for levelling because they don't want to  or cant' afford to respec. Your typical guild is not brining in full pre-Bis players with all their consumes. Too many years of playing on pservers has honestly made people retarded man.
---
That protip is great advice. I started tanking in WOTLK with my guildies that were decked out, I got good at tanking when things went as planned, but I fell apart when things didnt. I started tanking more and running with random pugs and that's where the real fun began. Like learning how to drive vs learning how to race.
---
Now that's a shitty company.
---
You should see their bathrooms. Better shitting there than my own
---
You're not wrong but there's spotlight and then there's reverting back to a 13 year-old drama queen. People speak of any possible, perceived problem as if it's going to end the game before it even launches. It's honestly fucking exhausting.
---
Yeah, only active subscriber will be able to reserve 3 name maximum account wide
---
IF you're not trolling, you need to run like hell.  That's already an insane commitment.  That's like every non-work, waking hour if you have an 8-5 job.
---
NP man, just be aware that the soonest you'll get to AoE grind DM is at least 15% of a year.
---
Servers have to trust client positions to a degree because it's computationally intractable to verify everyone's movement is valid 100% of the time.  The only thing which could catch you is client anticheat, but IDK archaic history on exactly what warden would detect.  I do know simply modifying a piece of a game's memory requires very little coding (just WriteProcessMemory calls), and preventing tampering with that requires fancy code.
---
Speed hacking with cheat engine works different than changing your in game speed value.  That actually overclocked the frame rate and your game would send packets with incorrect time signatures, getting you banned.
---
You can't modify spell damage since that's calculated server side.
---
Yeah, they never put anyone in camps, because they flat up murdered them.
---
Most of the wipes in MC are almost always due to pulling a wandering patrol.
---
Yeah! Few games have a small community structure like that. Last game I still play that has a server based community is DayZ. 
---
I think screechers understand each other, honestly. They make allies pretty quickly once they hear each other's calls. Then the loudest screecher rapidly asserts himself as the alpha. It's an intricate social structure!
---
The answer is simple, their realms are empty on retail. That's about it.
---
No. TP = Teleport
---
I play retail, enjoy it.  But threat isn't nearly the concern.  Most tanks have much better taunts and threat generation than classic, so it's less of a concern.
---
It's not the source. It's a decompilation. There aren't going to be any comments.
---
it can be good and bad. certainly at launch the high pop realms will be terrible to play on, but what about 6 months-1 year later? I honestly think we're going to see the 6 months population be about 50% of the launch week max, but I expect it will remain steady after that.
---
We called it the voltron set
---
&gt; Paladin
---
&gt;Pros:
---
  &gt;  Can play all roles.
---
Prot and Ret are terrible specs.
---
That's why I said to expend the rage with Battle Shout first before switching stances.
---
Actually I just watched his streamable.
---
He's looking at the client code, which is obviously....not the server side code.
---
It's only the range check to see if your bars show red/white, that's it.
---
It has nothing to do with whether or not hits go through with an added range.
---
You can look at the server code here:
---
https://github.com/mangoszero/server
---
I've spend the last 2 hours at work grepping through every string I can think of including the ones he listed in the decompiled client and none of them add range:
---
AttackingRequirement
---
CanReachWithMeleeAttack
---
GetCombatDistance
---
meleeReach
---
SPELL_RANGE
---
pSpellInfo
---
rangeIndex
---
IsWalking
---
Do you get what I said?  Again, he's looking at _client_ behavior only, the range indicator is for your bars lighting up white or red, not an added range to successful melee hits calculated by the server.
---
Yeh that’s generally gonna be my playtime unless I have a day off. I do plan to take a few days off at launch to get a little bit of a head start
---
WTF, you actually can. I never even thought of that.
---
The gear on a level 1 warlock sells for exactly 10 copper (robe, pants, boots, dagger).
---
Might be worth rushing it on release.
---
They were announced with the original announcement.
---
So what are the point of these? I just don't see waiting so long for a game and then just following a premade formula. It's half the nostalgia learning where things were or how to do them? To me not much fun doing a walk-through.
---
Once you get your mounts, enhancement really isn’t too bad, especially in BGs. I played enhancement and if I was mounted, you can get in their faces before most have a chance to CC you.
---
You shouldn’t be able to hurt fire elementals with fireballs.  Think about it.  I like having that part of the game, and I’m a mage player.  It gets me excited to spec fire later in the course of Classic
---
I will say that if you're rolling with a druid, warrior leveling will be a BREEZE.  Having access to some kind of sustain is massively helpful.  It'll essentially eliminate any downtime.
---
Plan on bringing in a couple of other noobs to play the game with me as well! Don't plan on going hard on anything, just taking it easy and enjoying the leveling experience. Will probably be rolling Horde side. Saw your playing time of 9pm-12 EST, basically what I will be playing 8-11 CST.
---
dude that would be awesome to have a group! maybe u/neecodemus could join us as a mage, and i can heal?
---
Wow dude.. Best sub
---
That's why I don't have a leveling route on here, I will be taking my time during leveling but I still want something to reference to so I don't have to compare talents etc
---
This is great, thanks for making it.
---
wooow... so unnecessary and yet so entertaining. 
---
Actually, this is a very good example of how BfA came about: Blizzard employees producing shit.
---
She actually had a nice story arc within those second-wave 5man dungeons. It's just that I expected Halls of Reflection to be the lead-up to a final showdown, not the actual showdown itself. Like, did she go back home after the Saurfang business in ICC?
---
It's a pretty versitbile spec. Things to 100% take are the the single talents. Feral charge, Faerie Fire, Insect swarm, stuff like that. Most of the talents in the spec should be tailored to whether or not you want to spend more time in bear or cat, on the feral side of the tree at least. Oh, and take Furor.
---
everyone else here is rolling alliance it seems xD
---
So to make sure all blizz employees can wipe, we need to all sub for a year.
---
What’s the best Alliance class for a lazy person aka the most simple class? I’m guessing PvE is Mage (frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt...) but I’d like to see input on both PvE and PvP. 
---
Been a tough class decision...
---
this guy knows
---
LOL ok yep, a nice combination of the two.  Well done, solidjade-san
---
okay awesome! when i decide on faction i'll let you know for sure!
---
Not in duels but in BG's you have better things to do instead of abusing the mechanic
---
And you had a legitimate gripe back then which was addressed late (TBC), but if you are signing up to play CLASSIC there is no mystery anymore. You are signing up to play an offensive disruptive spellcaster (and a strong one), the fact that enhancement isn’t viable shouldn’t be a shock and it isn’t a legitimate complaint.
---
These were literally the only ones I ever had issue with with that rig. Weird. 
---
Ha, "rig". Hardly the word for the store-bought beige piece of crap I had 14 years ago...
---
I don't mind healing raids at all, I'm just worried about the constant respeccing if I want to have the best build for each aspect of the game I will play. Not sure if druids have a one off spec.
---
What's the lore reason for her hair?
---
As long as you speak English there which it seems you're well capable of then I see no issue
---
I just use every opportunity I can to complain about retail.
---
I wouldn’t say that’s a pipe dream—many people did that in Vanilla.  That said much of the healing gear will not be useful, but you can pick some items that are, especially benediction /anathema.
---
Spriest struggles a lot in raiding for two reasons:  It's not particularly mana efficient, and more importantly there typically isn't room for the debuffs that spriest brings to the raid.  If you're okay with PvPing spriest and healing raids then I'd say there's no problem with choosing priest.  You could probably heal dungeons just fine in a spriest spec if you had to, so I wouldn't worry too much about changing specs outside of raid night, if you choose to raid.
---
thank you!
---
To quote myself:
---
&gt;Well, I never claimed I wanted a 1:1 vanilla.
---
This looks pretty solid! Thanks for sharing!
---
&gt;The average American users approximately 8.6 sheets of toilet paper per shit.
---
Holy crap, now I understand why so many were so pissed at that lady that suggested we only use one square per trip.
---
At least you're not Brazilian gamers... I'm not sure whats going on in their gaming culture but wow they are toxic as shit. I presume it's some national humor I don't understand. It's like every hyper troll on Earth was exiled to Brazil.
---
I don't have the time to dive as deep into this shit (pun intended) as you in order to figure out specifically how, but I think you are vastly overestimating the amount they spend on toilet paper every day.  It's maybe $50 a week.
---
So you shouldn’t be able to melee bosses with shields or dragons with tough scales that breathe fire? 
---
Come on, it’s stupid. They barely do it anywhere else in the game.
---
I want to play all my mage specs, not just the same cookie cutter frost spec as everyone else, that is boring as hell and I don’t see how anyone can think it’s not...
---
Vanilla taught me English. Learned German in school. Native Hungarian speaker. 
---
Should I go for French or Spanish? I can't stand vodka for long so Russian is off the table. :P
---
Actually if you play hunter at skill cap it's not as bad as people say, I've known a few hunters on private that would top meters on some fights.
---
Definitely. Someone just recently posted a build that gets furor right around when I was feeling the pain of no energy. I may go with that to be able to cat form it. You're right, bear is relaxing and less stressful haha.
---
Ah... A fellow r/hydrohomies where do I get that water bottle
---
Minmaxing is definitely important for clearing AQ40 and Naxx.  But most players will not see that content and will be farming MC and BWL.
---
Druid’s tend to respec once they acquire certain pieces of gear, but I rarely respecced from a heavy resto/ feral utility role. The fact of the matter is that Druid’s role in PvP as a pocket healer is absolutely vital, so having healing talents is almost mandatory. That being said, once you get good feral gear, you can definitely go into BGs and dunk on people for kicks.
---
this isnt back in the day.  on release you will get the 1.12 version of ragnaros which was much easier than the one originally released.
---
only the tanks will use fire resistance, the rest of the raid will simply use fire protection potions.  
---
some no lifers will do it in under 5-7 days but i assumed after about a week there would be enough people level 59 and up to fill the raid.    your own math proves my point.  rag will die once they get enough people to fill a raid.  
---
thank you for proving my point
---
No but that’s why people are talking about the issue of Chinese gold sellers again.
---
Classic opens the door back up.
---
We will see, that hasn’t been the case on private servers or beta, but we will see.
---
It was a typo that's now fixed.
---
That was my initial thought. I assumed that it meant it you start PVPing on an RP only server then you could get flagged for griefing etc.
---
i mean there are plenty times where equiping a 1 hander and shield in pvp doesn't make sense. Like if you are swapping to defensive stance just to disarm why would you want to weapon swap on top of that?
---
Me am dumb.
---
Bazmeg
---
So everyone who has been saying blizzard was full of shit is right...
---
Chimpanzees would be more pleasant to play with than some of the people I encounter lol.
---
Anyone defending world buff stacking exploit is trash.
---
Domo arigato, hippoofdoom-dono!
---
"Technically, this is Pre-BiS for me. You have dungeon epics to grind for, dw about it. Yeah I already have 2x [Dawn's Edge], why'd you ask?"
---
I recommend going in blind, you will more than likely meet more than a few people that are brand new want to explore, and adventure right from day 1.   If you do go thru this route, don’t group with try hards or min maxers
---
Broken Tooth is nice and all but his attack speed is 1 million when he's rooted away from the target. Wind Serpent every day.
---
J'ai hâte de lire les fautes d'orthographe et de syntaxe sur le général.
---
Speaking for paladins, if you get enough crit, Mana efficiency can be almost irrelevant due to the illumination talent.
---
I appreciate these, just wanted to let you know. :)
---
That depends, I think if you have a guild that is not hardcore, you will just do it they way I mentioned.  
---
But of course that depends for sure, in 3k pop server it might not be even an issue, curious to see that in action.
---
EU english?
---
#SHITPOST
---
I think you may have messed up on the math.  You did the primary math and came to the conclusion of
---
That's roughly:
---
* \~824 people in the no shit column
---
* \~756 people in the 3-a-week column
---
* \~748 people in the everyday column
---
* \~178 people in the slacker column
---
From that math, one group doesn't shit, one group shits everyday, one group shits 2+ times, and 1 group shits 3 times a week.   
---
 If 748 do everyday that means 748 shits, 178 do twice a day so 356 shits, and 3 days of the week another 756 on 3 days.  That equals 1104 per day (748+356), increasing to 1860 (748+356+756) on those 3 days.   Now if you add those into a 5 day week schedule it comes out to 7788.
---
I think you mistakenly put 7788 shits per day instead of 7788 shits per week, so if you break that down to 7788 / 5, that means 1558 shits per day.
---
I'll use a marco to stance dance for urgent abilities, but usually I just bind F1-F3 with the stance and then the toolbar switches so that everything is quite manageable.  It's not like other classes that need a lot of modifiers.
---
Paladins in vanilla are even more mana efficient. In TBC Illumination only refunds 60% of mana I believe. In vanilla, it was 100%. Also, Blessing of Light made down ranking pretty ridiculous because the added spell power didn't magically go away on downranked spells (above level 20... you still got quite a bit below though)... I don't remember of Blessing of Light was still a thing in TBC or not.
---
That's damn good advice right there.
---
I wouldn't mind ending up on a Spanish server. Since I am learning Spanish.
---
Because there you had mostly people who actively looked for it.
---
The expression has gotten a bad rep, mostly from pservers, but its still often linked to consistently valueing best spec etc. over player competence.
---
Id 10x times rather have a competent player behind a shadow priest than a combat sword rogue that doesnt have a clue what hes doing in fights.
---
Id say realistically though theres 3 levels of classic players:
---
* Casual (New players, ppl who dont have time or want to know about their classes optimal performances)
---
* Competent (Returning vanilla players, know their class, fights, what is best gear for them etc.)
---
and then
---
* Min/max'ers (utilizes only the best available strategy, spec and gear for their class)
---
Keybind your mouswheel to frostbolt, that’s all you need to know
---
Rule 7:
---
&gt; Restricted content may be removed: Reposts; Intentional Misinformation; Troll Posts; Google-able questions; Low Effort Memes;
---
1. Definitely not a repost.
---
2. I tried to be as accurate as possible.
---
3. Not trolling, was just curious.
---
4. No fucking way google has this answer until the next time their robot caches Reddit.
---
5. Hardly low effort.
---
So I really hope the mods don't remove it! ;-)
---
Nah dude not everyone is going to have a Thunderfury.
---
Dont worry about the beta census. It's a bunch of people with either lots of experience with the game and or deep historical ties. The general public at release will be different.
---
Like your language?? And the comfort of not speaking English is exactly why people think that you think you're better than them. Everyone else is learning English and you guys are just nope.
---
No, what they do is the let them hold it in and ferment in their intestines.
---
Get it really gassy and hot. 
---
Then using a digital camera - they used advanced technology to scan the steaming shite after it has been dispensed with manual assistance on a table. 
---
This scan copies the shape, smell, look, tastefulness of the shite - and converts it into retail content.
---
Take the journey alone. Many will do the same and you will notice that people will engage in social interactions. Will add you as a friend and might invite you back into a group as you grow and get more skilled. Your class will be highly sought after. Perfect to make friends. Just flow with the newbie crowd. You'll know when to take your game to the next level. And don't be shy to ask for help on general chat etc.
---
If it's for time efficiency, then it's your call.
---
That depends on where you live I suppose. When the game was released the village (yes, not even a city) where I grew up had 20Mbit lines to all households (and today we all have 1Gbit) through municipal policy. Even back then this was a mere 1 hour download, which was less than the downtime of the servers during maintenance.
---
Jaina's story arc was one of the most delusional in the entire franchise. It made absolutely no sense at all.
---
The average player on live still bombs their raid with mechanics despite DBM blaring a horn in their ears every time. Being able to Google a spec might get you through most of MC, but that's why the first two bosses of BWL are guild killers.
---
You mean my vacation spot in retail?
---
Great thanks for the advice/response. I think I’ll just heal PvE and spriest PvP, maybe save gold a few weeks and just heal PvP. I’m guessing in pugs my heals will lead to more honor aka ranks than a comparatively less geared spriest
---
Did you try turning her off and on again?
---
Of course. Spanish pronunciation is very easy and there's only one accent, which just denotes stress and doesn't change pronunciation. Gender is also easier in some cases for example when you say "my mother". The my is the feminine form in French but just "mi" in Spanish regardless of whether you're speaking of a mother or father.
---
&gt; I responded by pointing out that having an extra set of totems will always be helpful.
---
The point is not if it's helpful or not. The point is if it's enough to compensate having a shitdps like an elemental or even worse an enhancement. It probably isn't.
---
SOA is the ultimate hardcore game.
---
Oh absolutely. I just mention it because you used feral as your example.
---
idiotic statement considering what warcraft games do  
---
did you even play any warcraft game?
---
Back in college I dreaded ever having to reinstall the game as we had a 4gb weekly bandwidth limit. If you hit it you would lose your connection till you went back under the limit by days falling off. Large patch days all ways gave me anxiety over my dl.
---
Never out of toilet paper
---
Late in Wrath the bear and cat forms were individualized. I remember spending a lot of time perfecting the looks of my cowcat form for my horde Druid.
---
When someone gives actual good advice here the idiots will downvote it. 
---
My first two suggestions for you:
---
Don't play a warrior or hunter
---
/r/theydidthemath has to be gleaming with pride at this
---
It's really not a beauty. This is vanilla. This will annihilate the possibility of playing on an english realm if you want to play with friends. This is the worst decision they made for vanilla as of yet.
---
I know for sure that my potatohead friends will hit that deDE realm without even thinking and i have to decide: play with friends for 2 months or enjoy the game for a year.
---
No, go full feral.  All you care about is killing mobs faster when leveling as a druid.  Your hybrid spec will just be an annoyance.
---
Fortunately the meme specs usually have at least some uncontested gear (ie leather gear with spell damage for the oomkins)
---
Just FYI - it’s against the rules of the sub to encourage private server use.
---
Don’t threaten me with a good time
---
Time
---
God the memories that just flooded in. I can smell my old apartment right now.
---
A BGC for Jaina keeps Baine away.
---
Party-wide, no? I don't think any auras are raid-wide in vanilla.
---
A warlock with HP left is never out of mana...
---
Kom med den min dreng, share the wealth Mikkel!
---
I think Blizzard didn’t get the point. Spanish like high quality games, there’s not a big budget for games, so they focus on the good ones.
---
This is the reason why Spanish retail servers are less populated. Once they release classic they will invade one or more servers with no mercy.
---
Most of Spanish wow players speak English as well so they can even mix with other with no problem but they probably will tray to have their own server.
---
I feel like being able to shame bad rogues should count as attributable DPS
---
Wow, a dev team who listens to the players.
---
Dont worry, we use discord and not ventrilo. :D
---
I pray that they don't change world buffs so that there can be epic gankings on pvp servers like there were on private servers:
---
- Alliance ganks Horde during ZG turn in https://youtu.be/alVMDhA6QGE 
---
- Same video above but from the Horde perspective - all of those tribute/fair buffs :) https://youtu.be/wmcuNW5d73Q
---
- Gank during a Nef head turn in https://youtu.be/4go53HvtEGQ
---
Oh, must’ve missed that! Good to know.
---
Yeah thats my point. So how are you setting something like this up? Do you have 2 different buttons for your defensive stance? How are you equipping your 1h and shield? Separate macro?
---
Let her watch Classic class overview videos for priest and shaman! 
---
Keep in mind that you don't have to roll the same race as you can easily get around to other starting zones :D
---
&gt;Calling Countdown #2 – Leave World Buffs Alone w/ Fahq – 25:15
---
No....  Only a twat would argue to keep this exploit as is.   It will totally break the pve aspect of the game.
---
Burning Legion? I had no idea aswell and picked it at random. Though im polish so...
---
This is exactly why I'm ditching the EU English servers and just rolling my main on German
---
Not I just wished they would separate western EU tokens from eastern EU tokens.
---
No. Servers and mounts are two completely unrelated issues. Literally. You can't just say two completely unrelated issues are related, because you want them both.
---
OP recognised that language servers are a very popular announcement. So he tried to combine his unrelated mount issue with a more popular issue and ride the wave.
---
I'm going for Warrior as well with the intention to tank end-game content. Back in the day I had no idea what I was doing, so hoping to get more out it this time around.
---
Funny story, I actually leveled as Protection from 10-60, all points in the Prot tree. I spent my last two levels grinding mobs in Western Plaguelands, because I always saw Mages AoE grind there. I figured the mobs would need be dropping some really good stuff for them to go back to that place all the time. It must have taken me weeks to get to max level, but my memory is blurry. :)
---

---

---
I didn't mean the buff effects the entire raid, I mean that not speccing for it makes the raid as a whole does less dps.
---
Are you accounting for how female employees would use more TP on average than males, and also in situations where they aren’t shitting?
---
Well your post makes it sound like people don’t know what they’re asking for. That refrain:
---
&gt;you think you do, but you don’t
---
Which has been shown to false. Yes many many MANY will not like classic wow, but classic isn’t for those people and classic shouldn’t cater to them.
---
I don’t feel sympathy for those that order grapefruit juice and expect a sweet purple drink either.
---
Classic as it exists has a large and passionate population
---
Can you line out how it plays out being the only German on an English server?
---
Would you mind having a german Main Tank with "okayish" tongue in an English guild?
---
Look at Mr. Fancypants with his dark leather set he bought from the vendor.
---
Is your German fluent? If it isn't just go for that
---
I can't speak German that well but I understand enough so the game isn't fully unplayable. Going to a French server without any knowledge of the language would be a nightmare
---
mr tim sweeney actually comments on /r/fuckepic though.
---
bazmeg kurwa
---
For me personally, the whole point of wow is pvp realms. I wouldn't consider a pve realm real vanilla, at least to me. But also, I like to rp. Rping as a member of *insert faction* but not being able to fight those scum *insert other faction* heavily breaks immersion.  I therefore want an rp pvp server.
---
Not sure if you know what you're arguing. I played a resto druid in vanilla too. We're talking about bring a hybrid dps in place of a pure dps and how it impacts a raid of 40. Not being down a healer. I don't think anyone is really arguing that hybrid dps will do as much dmg as pure dps, just that it's not going to make or break a raid.
---
Technically you could reserve your names then delete and remake the characters on launch day with the classes you want.
---
More people should understand that min-max DPS reduces time spend raiding by a lot when ZG is out and you have to farm 4 raids per week, no one wants to spend hours because of meme specs.
---
Nope they just announced they will have languages
---
Watching now thank you
---
Layering does nothing for the starting rush. This is a common misconception. 
---
Layering is only meant to alleviate tourists leaving after a month, at which point server merges can take place via the cloud, as enabled by layering, and therefore Blizz can keep a healthy 3k pop. 
---
Even with layering, every layer is intended to have 500 people in starter zones at launch. Not to mention economy exploits as we’ve seen and immersion killing.
---
In its current form layering is a mess. I agree there needs to be a solution to tourist attrition, but not at the cost of immersion and economy.
---
It's a joke
---
Hey, since Classic's coding will be so much different from Vanilla's, I'm guessing there will be no working addons for a while, right?
---
I have a video of our Loatheb kill from a resto druid PoV where he's clearly clicking his abilities.
---
No issues with my CD drive but on dial-up I'm pretty sure I had to leave my computer on overnight and while I was at school (much to the chagrin of my grandma) to get the damn thing patched.
---
Patch days were a nightmare.
---
Thats a fair point too. 
---
But I dont think you need them in naxx. People clear Naxx in 4 hours day of launch with out them.
---
I have a vivid memory from all the way back in early vanilla WoW (2004/2005) which I have never forgotten. I was leveling my level 45 Horde mage, killing ogres in the Alterac Mountains. Suddenly, not too far in the distance, I noticed a group of three Alliance around level 55, looking all mean and dangerous. 
---
But they were not coming my way. There was another Horde player, a female troll hunter also around level 55. The Alliance were charging towards her. The fighting started and the hunter began to defend herself. I immediately thought: "*OMG I must go help her! She won't stand a chance alone against that group!*". As quickly as I possibly could, I finished off the ogre I was fighting and then headed to help the hunter. 
---
But when I got there, all I found was the troll hunter standing there alone, with three Alliance corpses around her. She had killed all of them single-handedly in less than a minute. I was stunned. My jaw was on the floor. How was this possible? How could she kill all of them by herself and so quickly? This was early WoW, a time before PvP videos even existed, before anyone knew how to play the game properly. Most people had not even reached level 60 yet. I had never seen anyone play like that. I just stood there in awe without saying a word, contemplating what I had just witnessed. The hunter mounted up and rode away towards the Western Plaguelands as if nothing had happened, as if that kind of PvP ownage was normal for her.
---
The hunter's name was Cauthonluck, the best hunter in the Frostwolf realm. I never forgot that peculiar name. It's so great to see you are returning for Classic. Thank you for an unforgettable WoW moment more than 14 years ago.
---
I think that's the joke.
---
Looks like I'm playing druid! Thanks for the answers :D
---
Get out
---
&gt; I didn't study any of these in school.
---
Well lucky for you that you had the family support and time to be so fortunate and studious. OP is 65 years old, it's unlikely your 3rd world country even had basic human rights then.
---
&gt; It's rude to be pretentious when you can't even express yourself in a manner which people can understand.
---
Presuming that everyone should be able to speak a certain language *is* pretentious and therefore rude.
---
Also, for the record, OP scores "High" on text readability.[^1](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#morfisia)
---
Your score is "Very Low"[^2](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#saurdang313)
---
So go back to school kid.
---
Posting this here again because it appears you have layering wrong:
---
In its current form layering is a mess.
---
There's something about that honestly. Been to france twice (skiing and sihhtseeing) and it felt like "why in heaven did tourists have to choose our hotel". And Paris was like the worst experience ever.
---

Your FREE trial is FREE for a limited time only
---
There's no joke in that title bruh???
---
Well AT&amp;T has to pay more to other providers for routing traffic going out of australia, and as all companies do, they pass those costs onto their customers.
---
I would think if your main is a Hunter, that you wouldn't want an alt that is ranged DPS only. Although, if you do roll Warlock, you'll be used to having one less bag all the time.
---
If you forced players to choose layer upon picking server and then dis-allowed layer hopping, you get the same Classic experience as 2004 but without immersion and economy failures.
---
big Mood.
---
Cartographer allows you to turn Questie off with the click of a button. Just see where the quests are and then toggle it off
---
The whole reason I went down this rabbit hole is because I read a comment threatening to withhold their subscription if Blizzard didn't do what they wanted. I wanted to let them know just how much Blizzard cared.
---
It has about 5k players according to their website and SW feels pretty alive considering it's a wotlk server.
---
To deal with the population dropoff Blizzard is anticipating. Each layer is still going to hold about 3000 people, so it's still going to be extremely packed on launch day.
---
Estimated time to download - 12 days 14 hours and 26 minutes
---
There is one more stress test scheduled for July 18th-19th. You may or may not be able to participate in that. The last stress test was open to all NA players with an active subscription. We'll likely have more information on who can join that stress test in about two weeks.

https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080
---
I think a fair number of people will do this, but mostly I think all of the players that play BFA and thus already have a sub will log in to save their name even if they don't play to ever actually play classic.
---
"Know" as in personaly know. Of course I am aware that there are plenty of people who will reserve their names, I just don't think that they are the majority.
---
The real strugle will not be dps check. It will be managing 40 people, people even fail LFR mechnics.
---
A feral druid who's trying will be high dps, it's the single meme spec that's actually viable. Ret paladins do less damage than tanks after a while.
---
&gt;I've told you my own personal experiences of raiding as an elemental shaman and the DPS numbers I put out, along with moonkins and ferals that also do competitive damage.
---
Even taking your numbers for good, you still aren't doing "competitive damage"  
---
You're doing roughly 60% of a mage in similar gear.
---
Repacks for theorycrafting where people give themselves every buff/consume in the book and put every single debuff on the target dummy.
---
Anything can reach 1k dps if you give them BiS gear they'll never get and every buff in the game, which means pretty much nothing when actual dps specs will be around 1.5k-2k dps with the same setup.
---
Have rp-PvP servers been confirmed yet?
---
Then they need to make the gold....
---
was letzte preis?
---
Each layer is intended to mimic a regular wow server population from 2004. I told you to read the blue post and clearly you didn’t. All your misconceptions are explained there mate. Listen to their podcast too if you want more details.
---
They intend to have maybe 15k per server, and enough layers such that each layer has 3k online or whatever the original pop goals were.

So doesn’t matter which layer you are on. You’re still gonna experience 500 people in the starter zone with u. It’ll be a mess. Layering does not change anything about the initial rush
---
I think that this man is trying to say that some people wanted Vanilla but will import retail QoL throught addons
---
Lol. Called out again for your bullshit in your own thread. You are full of shit and you need to take a step back and analyze your thought processes a bit.
---
I'd do it. And in Vanilla, I totally did.  Doing Scholomance once a day will be all the game time I get in a week. I will defiantly not have time to farm.
---
he´s not, it is just Vanilla´s weird lighting engine
---
Vanilla was a *very* social game and you will be forced to interact with people along the way.   You'll make friends easy.  Hang out in the hub cities and find a leveling guild with people who seem like your type of crowd. Guilds played a very large role in your day to day. They become your friends and you help each other out and.   I still talk to people I met on vanilla 10+ years ago.
---
&gt; I think people here are drastically overestimating classics success and theres a reason why blizzard wont do **language-specific-realms** (and they should have the best playerbase estimate BY FAR). 
---
Woups. They are doing it :-D
---
Not if it works properly as in, the way it did in the original game.
---
People pulling aggro after major domo ugh seriously guys we ran up there avoiding everything.
---
I would heavily advocate against (exclusively) linking stance and gear swaps. One reason is that changing weapons triggers a global CD - so if you're a tank stance dancing to Berserker Stance for a fear, you're not only unequipping your shield, you also can't use Berserker Rage right away. On the other hand, it makes sense to have buttons to switch weapons without changing stance - equipping a shield for Shield Bash in Battle Stance for example, or dual wielding in Defensive Stance when you don't need a shield.
---
So I would use dedicated, independent buttons for stance- and gear switching, and maybe a few combined ones for common combinations (like Zerker Stance+Rage).
---
"While we haven’t yet finalized the numbers of realms and realm types for each language, we’ll let you know those details before name reservations start on August 13." 
---
For people at work and such
---
China has a billion people. Even all those gold farmers pay a sub. But they also have hundreds of thousands of "legit gamers"
---
This was done on a repack where people give themselves every buff/consume in the book and put every single debuff on the target dummy.
---
Anything can reach 1k dps if you give them BiS gear they'll never get and every buff in the game, and that 1k dps means pretty much nothing when actual dps specs will be around 1.5k-2k dps with the same setup.
---
Realistically you'll barely be above the tank if you're lucky. The only melee hunter that's *somewhat* relevant is the one that runs Trueshot Aura and then spams Wing Clip all night with Nightfall.
---
It wasn't possible though. There was too much moving around and target switching  to maximize dps.
---
False, it is related because the community wants it. There was no different language servers on the private servers. So it is relevant to the topic of the win for the community, and if we ask for it we might be able to get it.
---
That's also the joke!!!
---
It's kinda bad on mobile, I've seen worse, but it's still kinda bad.
---
Remember when you had to install patches in order too? You just got done installing the game with all five(or was it just 4?) discs then you have to download .1, then .2, then .3. Thankfully blizz had mercy and let us download a big patch then all the mini ones that came after it so you could kind of catch up more quickly but man was that a dark time..
---
i have defensive stance bound, and then i have different key binds for abilities such as shield wall that will swap me put on sword and board and pop shield wall.
---
Again, repacks are useless. They've gotten so many things wrong that using them as a metric for Classic performance is just fruitless.

Those AddOns existed in Vanilla. So if you want Vanilla, there is zero dissonance between also wanting to use addons.
---
RP filters for decent human beings. PvP is core to the WoW levelling experience. :)
---
Now it’s all fury warriors your first move is sunder.
---
You don't see a point in a franchise that is based on narrating story of its characters?
---
&gt;We were just talking about splits, though...
---
That's fine. But splits or mergers can/will cause issues. Nothing that can't be handled, they did it in the past, but still, they are there.
---
&gt; I'm telling you that layering doesn't solve that issue. 
---
I know it doesn't. I'm just telling you what Blizzard said when they even started the initial conversation about any form of sharding (layering is a form of sharding). And they still are saying that this is the point of layering. 
---
&gt; No matter what, the layers are going to be about total population, not zone-specific population. 
---
This is not what Blizzard says. Care to share a link to them saying it's about total, layer-end population and not zone-specific? Because everything I've found says zone-specific is the main focus. It seems like people who want to defend layering have latched onto this total population idea as though it somehow negates all the other drawbacks, or the fact that it doesn't guarantee a smooth transition from layering to no layering.
---
&gt;This statement was back when they were thinking about putting *sharding* into classic... not layering.
---
Right, layering is a form of sharding and is the option they decided on after starting the conversation about sharding. This is just you being a pedant. I'm using them interchangeably here because they are, in effect, the same thing relative to this discussion.
---
&gt;They talk about using sharding to (among other things) solve the exact problem I mentioned: server pop issues.
---
You seem to be really stuck on this. They also talk about zone-specific, which is the main reason they put forth for sharding/layring. It can be both. 
---
&gt; As I've said, layering solves the population issue 
---
You saying something doesn't make it right. And it doesn't solve this. It potentially solves it, and potentially exacerbates end-of-layering population issues.
---
&gt;  Just look at what was going on during the stress test. Starting areas were crammed full of people trying to catch repops for a few kills. That's what happens with layering, and it's something that sharding could have solved. 
---
And Blizzard (and many people on any of the Classic WoW forums) still say that it *is* technically helping reduce that starting area overpopulation (and consider this one of, if not the, main reasons for layering) due to the fact that with the newer (than Vanilla launch) server tech we can have potentially 10's of thousands of people on one server, and layering breaks that down into 3000 people chunks.
---
In fact, if each layer is going to be one continent, and each layer has 3000 people, the layered starting zones (at least on each full layer) will be *more overpopulated* than going in without layering and just using multiple full servers with their own pop caps (assuming Classic servers will have a similar pop cap to Vanilla, which they will have to in order to keep the end game economy as close as possible to the original)
---
&gt; The stress test, at least, had no queues.  
---
Yes it did. They both did. I sat in a queue for the actual Beta and 2 stress tests.
---
Look at mr big shot over here with his 20mbit line. When my family finally upgraded above dial up we had this crazy 3mbit dsl line which got upgrade to 5 after a few years! 
---
Wasn't until I moved out of my parent's home that I got 20mbit :(
---
Paladins can tank 5 man dungeons and are good when there are a lot of undead enemies. Overall if you want to tank I’d go warrior it’s more reliable.
---
0-1 shadow priests per raid and tons of people want to play as one...
---
so most of the people wanting to raid as shadow will end up healing or not raiding...
---
lol! that makes me so happy.
---
You gotta pick if you want end game pvp, pve raid, or solo farm or all three.
---
From further down:
---
Mage is basically rogue, but -lockpicking +AoE farm
---
Shaman can do both pve/pvp but needs to spec into resto and carry 2 sets of gear
---
Apparently fecal germs can pass through up to 10 layers of regular toilet paper. So wash your hands no matter what!
---
That's actually a perfect case to take a feral tank - you can make one of your warriors a dps and it will make it easier to gear the remaining 4, and 4 resto druids in one raid is already pushing it (since their hots don't stack) so you really don't want a 5th resto.
---
I'm guessing it has to do with server tick rate and the reason why spell batching is 400ms.
---
Just because your connection to the server has a 22ms latency doesn't meant the server actually updates ever 22ms. It's all done in batches at static intervals with each action having different priorities for being processed/updated.
---
was expecting some at the end that you would mention Porn.
---
the truth is considered toxic to most people here
---
I think that's fine. Do we really need to know all loot tables for all enemies at launch for each phase? I believe it could actually be one of the more entertaining things to figure out as a community which bosses drop what.
---
I guess people are scared of farming something that's not in the game yet?
---
It’s okay if you can’t handle PvP servers.
---
What would you like to know friend?
---
Blizzard says Layering will be gone before Phase 1 ends.
---
So it shouldn't be too much of a problem.
---
Link or it didn't happen
---
you need to include "if you want to raid at level 60" each time
---
Bloodfury
---
Your pet does more than 0.  And if you don’t resummon on you are playing wrong.
---
If you play a Sac build Bloodfury is better than Troll’s Berserking and better than Undead’s nothing
---
I'm sure the tenth mage won't get bored/annoyed and quit when your 50th boss is killed and he's still five people away from getting a piece of gear since only a couple pieces drop per boss for the entire raid in vanilla.
---
How dare you assume the name of our lord and savior!
---
Turns out you were right. I calculated the weekly usage as the daily usage. The right figure is $10.53 per day or $52.64 per week.
---
For me it’s about dead realms. I know for a fact I’ll be on a high pop realm but I would feel bad for any bros stuck on a dead server. Even with ND at like 5k pop sometimes I can’t find mage water / anything to do.
---
Well I digged into my old english course  :   
---
(English -&gt; French)
---
* Present simple = Présent 
---
* Present progressif = Présent
---
* Preterit simple with a verbe of state = Imparfait
---
* Preterit simple with a verbe of action with a link to the present  = Passé composé
---
* Preterit simple with a verbe of action without a link to the present = Passé composé (or Passé simple)
---
* Preterit progressif (only verb of action) = Imparfait
---
* Present perfect = passé composé
---
* Présent perfect + for / since / how long = présent
---
* Past perfect = Plus-que-parfait
---
* Past perfect = Imparfait
---
Verb of action (I don't know the real translation) = Doing, or being the target of, an action (I'm walking / He got shot)
---
Verb of state (Don't know too) = a verb about something... who is not an action..? (He look tired, the table is round)  
---
So...  
---
"Je ne compris pas" is a Passé simple, meaning it need to be translated into a Preterit simple.  
---
The Passé simple is a form only used when it is written, it's something for the extremist of the french lexicon. And more than that, The first person of the Passé simple, is even less used. Some are debatting if it should exist or not, because the Passé Simple should not have a link to the present, but if you use the first person you become the link to the present as a narator and a protagonist. Yeah Pretty hard isn't it?   
---
Right now, I becoming to have a headache. It's way to complicated for me. Just for you to know, we have something like 14 past tenses. And I understand correctly any of them. I deeply sorry, I can't help you
---
&gt; Our plan is to have English, French, German, and Russian language realms designated in the final stress test. 
---
Nice, that's July 18th. I might actually be able to get in when they open this time.
---
Still works. Lotr quotes always work
---
This is amazing news! Thanks for sharing for those of us at work.
---
If you have the luxury to be picky with your groups, it should be fairly easy to build a Shadow set made of blues. As for Epics, that's going to take a while longer, but even then it won't be too painful I think, especially if you're patient and do lots of ZG/AQ20 when they come out. 
---
Holy is OK in PvP, but Disc is much better. Trispec works aswell, not much of a raiding spec though.
---
Maybe it helps for you to know that voidwalker was extremly overtuned on private Servers. So the leveling with voidwalker and wand won‘t be nearly as smooth.
---
ITS A BETA. You aren’t meant to have all your fucking fun before the game has even come out. Quit whining about dead game lmao
---
Following your logic then this topic would be valid:
---
* Now that EU got their Language specific servers, can we get Progressive Itemisation back?
---
Or for that matter:
---
* Now that EU got their Language specific servers, can we get &lt;insert literally anything you want&gt;?
---
At this point I don't think I can simplify it further. Servers and mounts are literally completely unrelated. It's common sense. You just don't WANT to understand it.
---
&gt; What happens when a random server DOESN'T lose 80% it's player base by phase 2?
---
Easy. A month or so before, they set the server to full and stop allowing new characters. They limit the number of layers, creating queues. They open new servers, and allow free transfers off of the populated servers to the lower pop servers. They let the community figure it out. Based on previous experience with server merging, this is much less bad.
---
&gt; Rule of large numbers dictates some servers won't perfectly die down to the 2.5k sweetspot
---
And those servers get queues. And character creation restrictions. Maybe even free transfers off.
---
* There are gonna be soooooooo maaaannnyyyy roguessssssssssssss
---
* Soooo many roguessssss
---
You say that under Rogue cons but there are almost certainly going to be more Mages than anything else.
---
This is all I've been wanting to hear/be confirmed.
---
Wouldn't be fair to open the flood gates on Aug 13th without letting people coordinate in advance. Or else all the solo players would reserve all the names within the first 20 minutes.
---
I seriously feel like 107 days was last week....
---
It does wipe threat
---
I’m trying to copy it but it won’t let me lmao. I’m new to Reddit and on a phone. If you sort by «new» and scroll down to 22 hrs ago you’ll find it. I’ll link it if I sort out how I can do it in phone.
---
for 1-59 yes,
---
for level 60 raiders, no.
---
anyone who raids at level 60 will be converted to the church of min-max.
---
same as IRL : if you can't sustain your pet, don't take one :'(
---
They just released the new retail patch. They want people (and streamers) playing that. 
---
After the hype dies down I imagine they'll probably do a relatively short 40-60 final run of the beta. Despite the tin foil hat theory that the beta is *only* for promotion, 40-60 stuff does need testing.
---
Thats what I did. He basically asked me to.
---
Yea, french is hell.    
---
   
---
Source: am french canadian.
---
Noh.
---
well yeah if you dont want to raid you are truly in Play whatever the hell you want country 
---
I might main a hunter were it not for my desire to raid
---
I love the way BM plays in solo/open world content

As has been discussed elsewhere in the past we were working with other European communities to try and establish unofficial servers for each language that is supported on Retail (and also try to establish an unofficial RP-PvP server), on what Blizzard has now referred to as the English servers. It's really fantastic news to see the French and German communities now have an official home, but we still want to continue with this project and establish unofficial servers for everyone else, even though fingers are definitely still crossed for further official server options.
---
The reason I'm writing this long diatribe is because despite efforts we've not managed to get in touch with any Italian or Portuguese communities, who both have official servers on Retail, and we'd like to help signpost towards an unofficial server for them on Classic too. If you are a member of any sizeable Italian or Portuguese communities, or represent one, please get in touch with me.

It's not about the person providing the service demanding compensation, it's about the person receiving showing their gratitude to another who went out of their way to do something kind.
---
I've never asked for tips, and I've always offered more than what was reasonable compensation to others for their services.
---
If you are annoyed by pushy people asking you to do shit without so much as a please or a thank you, then you should be the first one to buck up your change as a thank you in return for other people's charity.
---
The people who are nice enough to do so for you for free are definitely the ones you need to offer a tip to. More often than not they'll decline, but it's the gesture that counts.
---
FICK JA!
---
But it's fundamentally not a single player game, though. It's specifically the largest form of multi-player platform gaming offers. To me, the gameplay should reflect that. There are compromises that must be made, sure (How many times does this guy need someone to go out and grab 4 zhevra hooves?); but when the single-player starts interacting heavily enough with major characters that they play large roles in character development or major arc for the whole world, I stop investing in the story because some orc is "saving the world" right next to me (being a little facetious) instead of *with* me.

Swamp of Sorrows is [real bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akqzzAA7F08&amp;t=2m25s)
---
&gt; This completely defeats the purpose of class stacking.
---
yet you propose 8 shamans in a raid. 20% of the raid composed on one single class.
---
&gt; Hybrids bring more than their damage, and they also soak up loot that would otherwise go unsused.
---
Loot that would otherwise go for PvP offspecs keeping healers happy, also WHAT exactly do they bring more than their damage? Because most of the times it's just something healer spec of said class already brings.
---
&gt; Neither is having another "oh shit" moment instant heal with natures swiftness that can take a tank from 20% hp to 90% hp.
---
From a Ele shaman? You aren't going to heal 70% of a tank in one cast, and you're not going to be "oh shit fast" more than a tank healer. You are going to "oh shit overheal".
---
&gt; like ferals being able to battle rez, off-tank and provide 3% physical crit.
---
This is actually useful. A feral offtank is likely to get gear nobody would want anyway and still be useful for the raid. But he's a tank mainly, not a dps.
---
&gt; you can clear Naxxramas with 30 people
---
Sure you can. But again, just because you can it doesn't mean you should.
---
Ehh, transmog was one of those things that seemed neat at first but long term I think was bad for the game.  It just adds another layer of timewasting and ruins the sense of gear progression with everyone running around looking like silly meme characters.
---
Druid form styles are just a lesser version of the same thing.  Makes people focus on aspects of the game that I think detract more than improve the game overall.
---
Wish you the best, have fun there! Probably a higher lvl cap as well, maybe 20?

TIL yesterday wasn't a week long, I was just really hung over.

It is no longer an RPG, and does not resemble a sandbox experience because much of the game is on rails. I gave up on retail in 2014 for Blizz-like 1.12 and I have not looked back.

All my friends stopped playing, looking forward to meeting some of you.
---
Man, I was set on rolling a human pally for a good while until I logged into a p server and noticed the fecked up 2h animation. I can't unsee it now.

well if blizzard “promised” it then I guess it’s certain, it’s not like they’ve changed their mind before
---
Does Bloodfury not give SP in Classic?
---
Then Troll &gt; Orc &gt; Undead if you want to min-max as Warlock on Horde.
---
5% per bonus damage &gt; nothing Undead does
---
God bless you
---
I mean, I am familiar, I'm just not too fond of it on WoW if that makes any sense.
---
Bro you can’t just say “no, not really” and pretend that’s an argument.
---
I have a week off work and so do friends and members of my guild. We have our professions set up to take advantage of end game farms. Most people will not be our level, and people who are our level we will reach out to on both factions and work out deals to take advantage of layering &amp; farms. So rich thorium, Black lotus, devilsaur. These are all very important resources that we will have at least 3 days but maybe even a week+ to farm with a small group of people. 
---
I’m not going to say the world is ending here, but I do think with this organization we will get a lot of powerful resources with very little competition and potentially even multiple nodes per node. 
---
I think that won’t be great for the economy because for a while the number of people farming these resources will be way disproportionate with the servers population. Few people will control the prices for these things
---
Very legal and very cool
---
Im not "blinding defending companies" im stating  the truth. Fact is you're just trying to justify throwing fits like a toddler. I honestly don't give two fucks about these insanely miniscule demands you people make for this game. Money is what talks not whiny children on the internet. Blizzard may throw you guys a bone to make you feel like you're input matters but at the end of the day they're doing what they were pretty much always planning to do regardless.
---
&gt; but that’s conjecture.
---
No it's not, it's speculation.
---
Am I going to have a fulfilling experience if I play as a warrior tank, if I'm unable to commit to a guild raid schedule (will have to Pug almost everything)? I really want to tank. But I worry that the experience might be a bit diminished. Thoughts?
---
I was a Troll Rogue in Vanilla. Still got 8/9 AQ40 and several bosses in Naxx even though our guild didn't start raiding until 2006. And I also managed to get my Rank 11 mount.
---
Most importantly, I had a fucking blast.
---
Would I roll Troll Rogue again? No, I knew nothing back then. But my experience would not have been noticeably better if I'd been Orc or Undead.

I never proposed 8 shamans in a raid you monkey. You implied that a resto shaman would bring everything an elemental did. In order to have totems cover every group you would need 8 resto shamans, something that would never happen. 
---
Like I said, I won't list every classes utility, a simple google search or even a shred of private server experience would provide you with those facts.
---
You also clearly don't understand how much a max rank healing wave heals for with a decent chunk of spell damage &amp; healing.
---
I refer you to the previous edit, in which a feral is top DPS in BWL. They are more than capable of pulling their weight when played properly.
---
No meme specs allowed in our guild if you went to raid.
---
My blind carrier pigeon is en route to your location with the 10 schillings I promised

Ya he should roll troll lock... BiS horde warlock race for sure you’re hearing it here first.... like I said keep up the awesome advice, you are very knowledgeable vanilla player
---
I'm speaking purely from the perspective new players from retail we never played classic. They will think they can kill like in retail at first.
---
if you did things right you could entertain yourself by weaving in wand shots and staff hits.
---
But I don't know if that was removed in a patch prior to the one we'll be playing on.
---
Seems they could do some really cool advertising too.
---
"World of Warcraft.  The game that defined a generation.  Play it from the beginning now!"
---
"World of Warcraft Classic: Play the multi award winning game, from the beginning, the way it was meant to be played!"
---
etc. etc.  Sure they could drum up lots of interest quite easily.

How to make people pay one more month of sub just for 3 name reservations
---
What I’m saying is the changes that you want aren’t gonna happen because 
---
1. It’s too close to release and 
---
2. The majority of people don’t want balance changes
---
Blizzard doesn't want to invite more casual people because they know a ton of people are going to quit before 60 as it is.  The beta doesn't have to be a hot game, it's a beta.  The characters are going away in a few months, I'm surprised it got as much play time as it did.
---
Ill translate ;)
---
Right...WTF
---
Does that really sound like much to you? I mean the first wipe you'll always want at least 2 papers in case it's too wet - one layer would just soak through to your finger and likely tear, leaving your finger in your dirty asshole. And then the second one is likely another 2 papers, unless it's been super dry (stay hydrated). So that's already 4 papers just for the rough groundwork. You'll easily take another one paper swipe and then one more to be sure. And that's 6 papers for someone who's economical with it. I can easily see the average being slightly higher than this. 
---
My ex once actually commented on how low my TP usage is (hadn't switched rolls while she was gone for a couple weeks) so I'm not wasteful by any stretch of the imagination. I'm just baffled how 8.5 papers sounds minds blowing to you.
---
Not to be confused with the first EverQuest.  II was the game that competed with WoW and had several differences with the original.
---
This is great, I'm hoping to somehow learn from this what realms might become more Alliance/Horde populated so I don't end up with hours-long BG queues as a Horde player. That might prove difficult to determine, but at least I can try to extrapolate some data and take a decent stab at it. At the very least it allows us some time to coordinate with friends. 
---
I REALLY hope WarcraftRealms is a thing so I can 100% determine battlegroup populations after launch and change servers if need be.
---
I don’t understand why people make great/hilarious posts like these and hide their votes. 
---
Pussies.

Spanish makes 2% on EU population sadly, compared to 10% of french and 20% of german :/

I did consider applying a bonus for caffeine intake, since that stimulates the bowels, but no, I figured any time a Blizzard employee has diarrhea they just squat over their keyboard and the sheer force of the blast produces everything we customers see on the forums and in patches.

That’s just getting older I suppose. Especially once Classic comes out, and if TBC and Wrath follow suit, my 20s will vanish before my eyes.
---
Shaman and warrior I have 0 interest in, and I've never played a Shaman in my 12 years of WoW and was considering it, but they are so slow and totem management has always just seemed boring to me.
---
PvE (i.e. raiding) is definitely at the bottom for me. I used to be big into raiding when I was like 17 until I realised it was just too much of a time-sink and too easy if you're not going for world firsts.
---
I would probably casually do PvE from a perspective of "i want to see the content, I need some purples and it could be funny every now and then just for the comradarie"
---
Very few italian players in the playerbase apparently, would be a dead serv following their logic :/

It certainly was but I feel like that's why it caught on and exploded the way it did, and it was just the right enough level of easy.
---
I’m not trolling, I could play fire against deathwing and Rag in cata, melee can damage armored bosses right? 
---
It’s stupid, just let me play the spec, why does it matter to you?
---
I’m actually quite excited to try healing at endgame.  Really, it was just a matter of deciding between auras/blessings and the druid’s innervate/mark of wild
---
Population isn't the main factor, its the ratio of guild/raid leaders to raiders. And in vanilla theres (in my experience) a ton of people who wanna run the show. You need 39 regular raiders for every single one of these, to keep the supply up.
---
The big p.server had 10k online at a time and it could still be tough to fill a raid slot, caus often 4-5 raids would be advertising LFM at the same time.
---
I figured windfury wouldn't proc on extra hits but the flat chance for there to be extra hits through either ironfoe or HoJ proccing (and the chances of those procs being crits) would mean some decent uptime on flurry, which means more hits with a faster weapon. That was in principle what I was thinking about.
---
I think enhance's problems are just with the way raid mobs health scale for large party sizes. In 5-10 mans, mob health is pretty small to the point where a series of windfury procs absolutely obliterates what's there. Threat isn't an issue when whatever's mad at you dies before it has time to really get mad at you. 
---
But this doesn't scale when things have 100k HP and you just shaved off 8% in one global. The threat mechanics are the same, but the HP difference is massive. 
---
Coupled with, like you said, 0 raid synergy of stormstrike and you're already at a pretty bad disadvantage. The cherry on top is the lack of proper gear itemization, which is already silly for a spec that would literally require a little bit of everything. But there isn't even any good STR mail gear that drops from raids. It's either healing gear or hunter gear (agility+attack power if you're lucky), meaning that your returns from bloodfury are paltry.
---
Yep, may take a bit longer, but ultimatelly more fun and interesting i think
---
Orcs murdered 2/3rds of the population when they came to azeroth
---
People who min max aren't concerned with clearing the raids.  They are concerned with their position on the damage meters.
---
is pick pocket actually any good, im not sure why lockpicking seems that useful either.
---
im not saying rogue isn't 'better' than druid but I'd happily counter lock-picking with travel form / fast cat form / defensive stance via bear / self-healing
---
Yeah I agree it’s an issue, and yet another reason why current layering approach is a mess. When you have an issue with this many bugs and concerns, and even worse, things could be bad if pops don’t attrition like you expect, that’s just a bad approach
---
Personally I would go druid, battleres, a bit more damage than a pally and some cc. Pally may have buffs but so does a druid.
---
Oh jeez I remember patching that way, downloading packages on their own. There was this website for german WoW where you could download patch "packs" so that you only needed to do one download.
---
Sadly they split em up via...Old rapidshare, so they were 200mb packs that all lead to one winrar file. Man that's one thing I *won't* miss about classic for sure.
---
Also, it was 5 discs I'm pretty sure
---
I'm hoping server related discords start cropping up once the realm names are known. I want to browse around to see what type of community will be making their home on each realm.
---
&gt; I figured any time a Blizzard employee has diarrhea they just squat over their keyboard and the sheer force of the blast produces everything we customers see on the forums and in patches.
---
That sounds reasonable. So you did take it into account after all.

french are on their own server, all what i wanted ;D

I never used swords at 60, so being a Human wouldn't have helped me.

lo siento mucho
---
WoW also ran on a toaster, were as EQ2 required some beefy specs.
---
&gt;Not everything in vanilla is about pure dps numbers
---
Serious guilds are only going to bring a couple Hunters and they won't have time to tolerate meme-specs such as BM.
---
You can do stealth runs of dungeons and pick pocket and open locked chests solo. It's fun. Also, pick pocket is just extra gold while leveling. Super easy with auto-loot on to pick pockets of just about every humanoid you fight while leveling.
---
The time it would take to level and gear a mage alt for farming would result in a lot more gold lost than gained imo
---
Sorry to piggyback here, if you don’t have the time to reply, I understand you’re busy AF. But if BC came out, would your podcast follow in that direction, or is it more oriented towards the Classic experience alone?
---
Those are mine, plus the guides of U/Meech1889 and U/Qeliasq 
---
I'll be adding more classes and other info-graphics to that album as they pop up.
---
Orc warrior is OP, and that's universally accepted opinion. 
---
Regarding shaman + warrior combo... Of course it can shine on lvl60 when both of you are geared fairly well, but it is a bit of a trap while leveling. WF totem might sound attractive but there is no use of it when warrior gets polymorphed/rooted/slowed there is nothing a shaman could do, but a priest can. Another reason Spriest + Warrior is an extremely strong duo is passive healing provided by Vampiric Embrace, Shield and virtually zero gear overlap which might be another issue in warrior+shaman combo.
---
Your less likely to meet PvP players as alliance. Because fewer board horde make there way to goldshire or sentinel hill than alliances attacking crossroads.
---
How do we imagine humanity of 1200, 1950, or 2019 would respond to such a threat? It’s entirely likely it would be more brutal. Real humans have committed far worse atrocities than anything in WoW lore.
---
People wouldn’t abide forsaken either. Big part of why I like the scarlet crusade, I think. It’s an ideology and a paramilitary cult that I could see realistically existing in our world if something like the scourge and forsaken existed.
---
C'mon man, that's why you need on Corpsemaker last run! You're prepared for this!
---
&gt; The cooldown won’t be too long that we can’t take advantage of it.
---
&gt; Also we will have guildmates &amp; friends just on different layers farming.
---
There you go make an ass out of assumptions again.
---
We're also seeing that you can't reliably control how you get Layered anymore. The logout trick is gone and sometimes you're not the party member that gets layered.
---
Friends and guildmates are now prioritized all to the same Layer, which they have no consent over.
---
And again, we're ~2 months away. Blizzard *is* going to get Layering right.
---
Except a free 60? A 60 that people work their asses off and are proud of, except he just cheated and got it with 1/10th of the effort of anyone else. By cheating. I truly don't understand how people are saying that literally cheating and hacking to get something that people work hard for is ok.
---
This. Streamers don’t want you to know their realm because they know they’ll have 100 people following them day one. We won’t find out on what realms they are until a little bit after release.
---
See yall lil blue bitches out in Hillsbrad!
---
Considering how slow priest gold grind is before DM? no lol
---
I had the same dilemma and I picked Mage. Leveling is good. End game is great. You do good damage both in dungeons and you have loads of tools for PVP. You have portals and you can farm gold with ease. respeccing wont be a problem cause you can farm gold. If you only have limited play time Mage is a good choice. I do love Warlocks but for me Mages can do more.
---
Not really. The first few levels of classic mobs are deliberately not very threatening but they clearly take a while more to kill, there's no way they're going to die to level 1 mobs and past that point they'll be well aware there's no point in pulling several.
---
Guaranteed, type this /1 Healing Priest LFG questing \_\_Insert the zone you are in\_\_  . You will get 5 people willing to play all the time.
---
I don’t think they’re exploits. As said in the interview, Kevin Jordan said they were aware of the *problem*, but they didn’t fix it as it wasn’t an exploit. 
---
That being said, I think there are a couple common sense solutions that I would be for. Make world buffs decay when logged out, and only allow X number of world buffs, or don’t let certain ones stack.
---
My experience comes from those days 15 years ago, so it's not up to date with the pserver meta at all, nor was I all that great back then either. But I do remember tanks definitely stacking as much EHP and mitigation as possible, we wipe in the raids for hours from tons of things, so any way to keep the tank up was priority. Also, DPS pulling aggro was never an issue unless someone started too early or the tank was bad. What was the old saying "2 sunders and dps is gtg"? 
---
Comparing that to the new meta is interesting, has DPS got so much better that they can pull aggro more often? especially if the tank isn't more damage/threat focused?
---
interesting.. with voice tho? hehe
---
I still feel like tuning meme specs slightly to make them more viable wouldn't be harmful
---
Way to comment on nuanced conversation from two points of view with “you is trash”.
---
More of a placeholder for down ranking...although the mana difference is negligible.
---
I dunno why people are downvoting you. The early 2000s was the prime internet shit-taking time. The shit-talking wasn't that bad in WoW, though. The cancer was mostly contained to the fps genre.
---
The naga razer?  Interesting suggestion.
---
pfQuest does this. Exclamation points on map but you can turn off where quest mobs are on map
---
I actually can't even remember any leather gear for boomkins that isn't itemized for resto. They wore mostly cloth and gearing a boomkin usually means passing up upgrades for Mages and Locks.
---
Interesting I’ll dig around on the vanilla addons.
---
I think you'd be surprised at what a properly geared feral tank is capable of.  You can tank Nefarian even through a class call as long as healers are paying attention and you're in full BWL or better gear.  You're an ideal tank to soak hateful strikes on Patchwerk.  You're more than capable of tanking literally any boss in the game if you're properly geared and specced, without being a liability of some kind.  People just have it in their mind that Vanilla druids can't tank, but they're wrong.
---
Not even mentioning the higher threat output without having to sacrifice survivability like warriors have to.  You can be in full threat gear and be maintaining way higher health and mitigation than a warrior specced into fury and wearing threat gear is capable of, while putting out higher threat.
---
I'm not saying guilds should go out seeking feral MT's over warriors come Classic release, but don't lose your mind if you see a dedicated feral tank in a guild, and seeing them main tanking some fights.
---
Hey, we need to talk about your math because it's quite frankly shit.  Your forgetting to take into account a few aspects of business overhead so you might as well flush your assumption down the toilet!
---
First we need to account of the fact that the money is not pure profit to wipe their ass with after said shit.  
---
Now we know for a fact that the dynamics of most business models in the US yield a GROSS of 30% with a net dynamic profit (based on general averages) of about 5% yields.  
---
We can then assume that Blizzard is saving some financials on overhead as the game model already exists and thus the work is slightly less time consuming to create, so let's bump that gross income on subs up to about 15%.
---
Thus, you must assume that an individual sub can create only about 15% of the poo paper you have projected.
---
Who needs toilet paper when you have all the god awful novels they hired Richard A. Knaak to write?
---
Christie Golden? Better treat those pages like gold.
---
Richard A. Knaak? An affront to the English language.
---
Does it show on the minimap? Thats the only thing I need so I wont be missing any quests
---
I am really stuck between Mage and Warlock.  I played warlock in vanilla and mage in BC I played both in Wrath.  I am an adult now with a kid, a wife and a job.  I have time to play but not like I used to so I would like to play as few characters as possible.  I always enjoyed the versatility of mage in pvp and the ease with which it is played in PVE.  I love the idea of exhausting all possible options to survive an encounter.  For Warlock I love the leveling ease it has, I love that it can face-tank in pvp, I love that each spec comes with a new playstyle.  I don't know.  Deep down what I am really looking for is to have an emotional connection to my character, to really feel immersed in the game and my characters relationship with the world.  I don't know which class best fits that role.  I guess I will just have to play both and hope I end up falling in love with one (which is what I am currently doing on pservers).
---
You don't even bring any arguments to the table. You just spit out random thoughts and try to shove your own understanding of the situation in my face.
---
Operating costs aren't figured in with profits.
---
It doesn't matter what form the game is set in. Its Warcraft universe first and foremost. Its story was always about the world and characters, not some random adventurers collecting bear asses.  
---
If you dislike character focused story, you're playing the wrong franchise.  
---
Sad how stupid you people are and deluded with your "its about adventurers!" shtick. Story is not. It never was.
---
Holy shit! I didn't remember him until I saw the thumbnail and then everything came back!
---
I am playing with a close friend of mine and our primary focus will be crafting/gold farming and PvP.   
---
He's playing a rogue and I am torn between playing a warlock and a mage...  
---
Locks seem to have the best overall potential for gold farming (free mount at 40, great tanking pet) and from the Class tier list it looks like locks have the highest dps output in both PvE and PvP.  
---
However, Mage + Rogue has always been a very powerful combo TBC and beyond. What about classic? Would a mage be a better fit with a rogue for leveling and PvP over a warlock?
---
And it wasn't nearly as helpful as it is now.  Content was barely non-existent.
---
I still enjoyed this post more than most of the sub today, and in general more than I should have.
---
Except it does.
---
Yes, really. They are by far the most profitable thing in the game, it isn't even comparable. IF you're part of the mafia and the mafia operates in a sell your own with multi hour rotations you're looking at 300+ gold per hour, which is 3 times as good as the next best thing you can do (which is hunter only). For reference outside of being a hunter you're looking at 50g an hour farming if you have a good farm.
---
&gt; Just because a group doesn't need totems, doesn't mean it won't benefit from them.
---
OF course the group will benefit somehow from those totems. The raid as a whole will benefit more from some other classes than from a ele shaman though.
---
&gt; People were shit back then and had no idea how to itemise for maximum damage.
---
I'm pretty sure we did. Don't forget we didn't roll in 1.12 from the start. People tackled MC in shit gear because shit gear was all that was available.
---
&gt;  I've shown you numerous examples of several hybrids specs putting out over 1000 DPS.
---
And the literal worst pure dps still puts out 20% more. Your point being?
---
Franchise always comes before the game genre.  
---
Especially when its direct sequal, not some "off spin" that takes place somewhere on the sides.  
---
WoW story was always single player focused for the most part.  
---
You can quest and do almost all of them solo in every game version.
---
Tbh a lot of that would depend on the Tauren's attitude towards hamburger consumption
---
&gt;Blizzard is shockingly listening to us.
---
Blizzard has always listened to its players, in fact I'd argue some of the worst decisions in wow's history were overwhelmingly from the players
---
They were a "safe" class for leveling because of all their utility and tools but definitely not one of the faster classes.
---
Things like fear, dots, mind flay slow, pw:s, blackout, silence, etc... they were really good at dealing with tough pulls or defending themselves in pvp but your optimal leveling rotation involved mostly wanding and dotting and leveraging Spirit Tap to keep your mana regenerating.
---
You get bonus points for playing shadow priest on horde because then you don't have to deal with undead rogues and will of the forsaken. I played troll rogue back in the day and generally avoided locks/priests while leveling because dots and fear made it nearly impossible to live through a fight, even if I managed to kill them.
---
They weren't thoughts, they were facts.
---
Here's another fact: Nobody likes you, you're ugly and your mother dresses you funny.
---
Be warned - Playing a warrior in Classic is a very different ball game in comparison to retail... Leveling is quite the chore but if you are good at tanking, you always have a group instantly.
---
Mage is great - you can AOE grind/farm (efficiently after lvl 21) etc, no cost for food/water and travel is fast with portals and smart placed hearthstones. The great crowd control abilities of a mage shouldn't be dismissed. I had a human mage and he was a blast to play back in vanilla and TBC. Selling food/water and portals is a great way to make coin... gold is fairly hard to earn in classic especially if you want to buy that mount at lvl 40.
---
Maybe you're right. I'm between shamy, priest or druid and I really can't decide. Had mage+druid back in 2005 and I want a healer, but on the other hand I really hate the horde cities. So, Dwarf Priest? (Just started a Heal Druid on a wotlk server)
---
What i wanna know is if its 3 names per account PER SERVER or is it just like 3 names in general and then you pick servers after?
---
&gt; the stats I found on average sheets per shit didn't discuss gender either
---
Females require TP for every toilet transaction
---
Warcraft games are RTS RPG.  
---
Get your genre straight dumbo.
---
Well, youre only proving my point. You do realise shaman is horde only? Those stats dont specify faction speficic numbers, so you can basically 2x shaman and paladin numbers or divide the others by 2, to get a comparable number. 
---
As you see on the middle chart for example, shaman comes right next to rogue and mage, even though horde population is even smaller. As faction specific numbers dont exist for this private server, we cant get an exact number for it. 
---
Stop spewing your bullshit here, troll.
---
Ps. I’ve played on those servers, even the new one, I’m fairly familiar with the class division.
---
If you fancy yourself a master kiter you should really use the improved range. Its a huge bonus.
---
I was torn between these two as well. I've decided on druid. High mobility, flag carrier in wsg, tanking abilities are great as you level, MotW is an amazing buff (30 min vs. 5 min, as well), and overall much less gear dependent than a paladin w/r/t dps (I'm assuming paladin healers arent quite so gear dependent, but I've never played one at 60) and since there are typically so few druids you'll have less competition for gear.
---
Plus Dwarfs are cool. Swol little scottish bruisers with big ass beards, and a lust for beer. That is the real reason you should play them. 
---
If your tanks need fear ward, they suck.
---
Fortunately, [this is confirmed.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1106722-french-and-german-realms-for-wow-classic/)
---
On a private server the most plausible theory is gold spawned and then sold by admins.
---
If you're only wanting to farm gold as a duo, lock will be perfectly fine. If you plan on farming gold as a solo, mage is better than lock. (aoe farming)
---
Dude's name is assburgers...

"THIS IS UNFAIR!"
---
-the Horde
---
I'd really like to play a Shaman but the Horde cities are so ugly and I can't imagine playing without "going home to Ironforge". I want an Alliance Orc Shaman!
---
Druids.
---
No doubt
---
Yeah, they however told us this when they gave us the release date too weeks ago:
---
&gt;If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.**Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. **We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!**
---
Im guessing at least 1 week before the 13th of August they will give realm names out. And then 8/13 we get to reserve our names. Its the reason I also don't understand why people have been freaking out about streamer servers.....
---
We will know where they are gonna go long before launch man. They are gonna want to reserve their names. Avoiding them will be easy if you really want to avoid them.
---
It's all instinct, baby!
---
Doing the lights work
---
You can only do the adventurers journey so much before everyone complains and says they want to know more about the npcs. Really vanilla is the odd one out on that since even WC3 focused on the characters.
---
If the Germans start invading the other servers, will US realms automatically be called in to save them?
---
&gt;But it's fundamentally not a single player game, though  
---
Questing and world content was specifically designed to be as single player as much as possible while adding some group options here and there.  
---
&gt;but when the single-player starts interacting heavily enough with major characters that they play large roles in character development or major arc for the whole world, I stop investing in the story because some orc is "saving the world" right next to me (being a little facetious) instead of with me.  
---
You're playing the wrong franchise then.
---
you guys usually stick with the dutch and other scandinavians on an english server
---
Once again, I reiterate: People were shit at the game back then, and any memories you have of class balance/damage values are directly skewed because of that. 
---
Ferals did not understand that in order to do the best damage they would need to wear a level 26 gnomeregan weapon and a level 40 leatherworking helm. I have shown you a video of a feral using these items doing over 1000DPS and being in the top 4 damage.
---
Elemental Shamans didn't understand the value of downranking lightning bolt based on fight length, and that spell penetration was a priority stat that provided more DPS than spell damage. 
---
On top of this, people were so bad back then that they rarely strayed from their classes main armour type. Look at all the Paladins healing in their dreadfully optimised Tier sets, even though they were GARBAGE for healing. Same goes for a lot of the hybrid spellcasters, who would straight up not roll on cloth gear...
---
Or they don't ask questions at all and just make a statement that he then has to go off of.
---
Stun Resist? What? That's not that important ... you chose Orc b/c Blood Fury or Weapon Spec not due to +25% stun resist.
---
I think that’s what the kids are doing nowadays. We should use Ventrillo for the true Classic experience.
---
As "cringey" as this may be I'm totally taking a personal day at work come character name day. 
---
I have names for my main and all my alts and back ups in-case those are taken......what has this game done to me....
---
I'm between dorf and hooman. i dunno yet.
---
&gt; but pvp sucks unless you have good teammates in discord and you cant farm solo.
---
That's just not true.
---
Greatness at any cost!
---
Well, wish automatically granted, then!
---
unfortunately the economy on your realm is gonna be fucckkkked.
---
Max rank if you intend to kill something in pvp.
---
Downranking is just an efficiency thing to do in Raid DPS / Healing.
---
As of right now Cartographer won’t be available for Classic WoW. It’s only available for the 1.12.1 client and not 1.13.X.
---
Millions of players AREN'T also champions. Its like SWTOR. YOU are Darth Oculus no one else. All other players are adventurers/random sith you found. And I never got why that was an issue, does Joe really need 20million boar asses? How does azeroth have enough Boars for them to not go extinct from how many assess are being collected?
---
haha discord is so good though. I never had the classic experience so i dont think i need ventrillo for the nostalgia xD
---
As long as the gear that drops in those new raids and zones doesnt get out of hand, sure why not?
---
Yeah op is an idiot. Warlock has the richest variety of spells to use. The shadowbolt spam could only apply to raiding just like mage. Then again this is vanilla and no class has an actual engaging difficult rotation in pve whatsoever
---
I’m gonna miss it as well due to work, big oof.
---
People have been working them out with the beta.
---
I never said authentic experience in my life, im playing vanilla wow cause i love RPG games with RPG mechanics, love a permanent bug world and love community driven games. So fuck off with your idiotic argument thats based in something i never said.
---
You can min/max any spec. I'd take a min/maxed moonkin over a casual mage. Who wouldn't?
---
It comes down to what players are available to a given guild. 40 slots is a lot to fill.
---
with switzerland and austria we are nearly 100 million german speakers in europe
---
" The Tauren character model has a larger attack range than other humanoid models; the feral form models do not benefit from this as the feral form is no longer a Tauren. Simply put: when you shapeshift to a smaller form (feral), you will need to get closer in order to attack – this is not a bug. "
---
I once seen a bit personal PvP when I stupidly went exploring the ruins of lorderon which auto toggled me. It was a long time ago but the only other time I can recall was zangermarsh. When realm transfers were allowed from pve I joined kazzak and realised what a mistake I made languishing in Bronzebeard. 
---
I enjoyed my time thoroughly on BB but I just feel you are missing out on another huge aspect of what made vanilla great.
---
also don't be a punk. shift your movement keys to ESF and never take your left hand off homerow.
---
Awesome news! But the aussies are sleeping now! 
---
This will be good news to wake up to.
---
I dont think anyone is saying that they want to be playing a non oom shadow priest. But rather that they wanna play a shadow priest.
---
I plan to offtank when I can. Feral tanks are great early on for sure. Don't have the same defensive that warriors have and can be crit/crushed unluckily, but yeah they are beasts!
---
Thats fair. I fall into the needing to fix my nutrition.
---
It might have been possible in Vanilla but I'm pretty sure you can't use an addon to activate abilities now. Prepared to be wrong on that.
---
In Wrath they introduced totem sets for Shaman where you could configure  totem set to drop one totem of each type, then bind that set to a keypress which would drop those four totems at once.
---
I wish there were fun ways of saying what language they are. 
---
* Italiallidan
---
* Germannoroth
---
etc
---
On that same note, dont be afraid to leave a guild.  If for example, someone in the guild is being rude or racist but they wont kick them because they are a friend of the guild leaders. Just find a new one that fits who you are.
---
Thank god!
---
Paladin is again way more useful in raids.  Those buffs are great.
---
And then wotlk arrived
---
pfQuest won't be in classic.  It's written for the vanilla client and will not work on the modern classic client.  It will require a total re-write, and AFAIK shagu has said he won't be redoing any of his stuff for classic because of the huge effort it would take.
---
Unfortunately pfQuest also is only available for Vanilla 1.12.1 as of right now and not the Classic WoW 1.13.X client.
---
The button I click the most often except in raids is lightning shield and you have that on shift+alt+f1? How is it even possible to bend your hand like that?
---
You can learn more about the NPCs... but the game shouldn't be ABOUT them as it is now.  
---
WC3 is a different genre...
---
Umm SWTOR does the exact same thing WoW does and is an MMO. The story was what SWTOR was praised for. DFO also has players being a big deal.
---
Cross realm BGs will be a thing from very early as far as I know.
---
Also, I'd go on a wager that 99% of the actual player base wasn't even invited.  Fewer still had an active sub to also be able to play in the first place.
---
But don’t forget
---
_To give him snack_
---
Gah! You missed an amazing opportunity there! Go feign death...
---
Hahaha, soon as I said that, they announced the beta end date for next week, no 40+ testing! Perhaps that theory wasn't so crazy after all...
---
Reddit sub does not equal the entire community, please keep that in mind
---
Why would I get upset over someone being bad at the game?  I would get mad at someone in my raid for being bad but none of these guys would be allowed into the raid...
---
I'm going paladin. Originally wanted shaman since I was going to be horde and wanted to support, but friend convinced me to be alliance. Reason I decided on paladin and not another healer is they simply have the best buffs. They were the reason why alliance had a better time in raids in vanilla. They also pretty much never go out of mana once their gear is good enough. I'll admit it's kind of lame that blessings don't last long so you don't get that cool sense of greatness from buffing a rando out in the wild, but whatever. If this were a TBC server I'd go druid FOR SURE since resto in TBC was fucking amazing in every way, but classic druid is just... very meh to say the least.
---
Congratz on succeeding pushing this, RP-PVP servers next?
---
So it is possible. For the ones interested, we should definitely push for having available non layered servers as an option, which is way more important and impacting for the core values and philosophy that vanilla stands for.
---
Ended up on genjuros with a bunch of irl uk mates. Your best are the best your many others were garbage!
---
You're looking at it wrong. It takes an average player 10-12 days in-game time to level, so 240-288 hours. Let's say you can farm 20g an hour at the very least, that's 5k or so gold you've lost out from leveling instead of farming.
---
Go whatever race you want and laugh at anyone who tells you otherwise.
---
They were begging for authentic spell batching and not this botched crap where it feels like you’re playing with 500ms.
---
Frozen happened.
---
And 2.5MB per second means 150MB per minute or 1400 seconds (= 23.5 minutes for 3.5GB). What's your point exactly? Blizzard downloads didn't always give the full speed in the first 30 minutes due to the peer 2 peer system. Our connection was rock solid, why wouldn't it be?
---
Fair enough. I agree with you that Blizzard will underestimate the server load, as they historically do every launch. Except for diablo 3 ros, that launch was flawless and my friends and I had a great time.
---
Great.
---
NVIDIA?
---
Man, Kaivax is on fire this morning. First the Beta ending in a week, then promising Oceania realms, and now we don't have to hear about leeway on this sub anymore.
---
The good news at least for raids is they'll want a bunch of rogues simply because they're great dps. Having a lot of rogues also makes vael way easier, which is a big block for many guilds. 
---
But to answer your question, yes, rogues will be less populated on pve realms, but don't expect the pop to be low. They're still a pretty fun class to play even if you don't get to gank people.
---
oh no no no my 15 year old memories of 200+ MS or pserver experiences aren't correct nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Thank you for pointing out the typos. My macros are written less efficiently/cleanly in game, so I wanted to rewrite them to clean them up. I just updated the OP since I think some people will just copy the macros. 
---
Button 1 Caster actually took more fixing, if you look. It's supposed to have the function of casting Wrath on harmful targets without pressing shift, too. So I really screwed up that one.
---
Seems soon judging by the issues that are still there. I want to trust them to fix them all before launch but the last few live expansions make me scared they will decide to launch with certain issues still there.
---
Counter point.  Your retarded if you pick a racial for PvE becuawe the content is 15 years old and has been solved a million times over.  True min maxers pick their racials for PvP.
---
It's sad you have to shit on people for playing what they like in a game where it literally doesn't matter except to people like you
---
&gt;It's all fine, always remember classic is more social than retail will ever be and you can always ask your group for advice without getting flamed.  
---
What exactly are you basing this on?  Having played on private servers that is simply not the case at all.  I think somewhere in the back of your head you think playing classic will be a time portal back to 2004 when the internet was young.
---
No they wouldn't have. They would have stayed on Draenor and not turned it to inhospitable shit.
---
good point. You pretty much have to be questing around humanoids from the beginning (i.e. only human starting area for alliance).
---
&gt; I have shown you a video of a feral using these items doing over 1000DPS and being in the top 4 damage.
---
And I don't care if he's doing 1000dps, because the very numbers you posted show Warriors top at 2200, Rogues top at 2100, Mages top at 1900, Hunters top at 1300, Warlocks top at 1200, and still ferals top at 1000. So good for him if he can do 1000. If he played a better class he would do more.
---
&gt; BOTH THESE SPECS BRING ADDED UTILITY TO GO WITH THAT DAMAGE
---
And Warlocks got way more utility, Hunters you want them because they have Tranqui Shot (at least 3 of them are a very welcome addition), and other classes literally SHIT on hybrid dps.
---
Is ele shaman utility worth 900dps? Not when a Resto shaman brings they very same utility.
---
&gt; On top of this, people were so bad back then that they rarely strayed from their classes main armour type. Look at all the Paladins healing in their dreadfully optimised Tier sets
---
Paladins healing in cloth were absolutely a thing back then.
---
&gt; As you agreed earlier, raids can be cleared with 30 people.
---
Even 20, we did MC/BWL 20 guildies + 20 paying customers for the loot auction on off nights.
---
&gt; Having one class do 200DPS less than another
---
It's 200less than the WORST pure dps class, which in turn brings MORE UTILITY. It's 50% at best of a serious dps class.
---
&gt; I look forward to returning to this conversation a year from now when i'm decked out in tier 2.5 doing some pretty sweet damage and bringing in some extra utility to boot. Ciao.
---
A year from now AQ probably won't be open yet. GL scrounging off set cloth gear which mages will get prio over you in any serious guild.
---
That’s about when lots of players will quit the live game also. Happened when wow first came out, leveling gets a lot harder after 35+
---
Jesus christ, I can hear this screenshot.
---
The part of LFG/LFR that ruined the game was cross-realm and insta-teleport.
---
All this does is prevent the need for alt-tabbing to your realm's Discord server.
---
Still too long, the beta is dead.
---
I'm curious how many of those bugs they can address in only a 2 week window, since they said they'd like as many fixes as possible to be online by then.
---
Just a couple weeks ago I text a friend that I met at level 20 something in January 2005. Haven't spoke to him since we both stopped playing in 2010. It was like old times and we discussed getting the band back together. 
---
Don't worry about not finding a group. You have to, and that's the thing I'm most looking forward to.
---
&gt;
---
So what time will I be looking at UK for an early log in? Midnight? 1am or 2am?
---
dad pesos
---
Turns out, melee actually *love* leader of the pack, its just hard to justify a feral DPS to provide it, a dedicated feral *tank* on the other hand...A space can be justified for that.  Resto shaman had windfury, the only downside is if your raid lead/assists are slow swapping out of the melee group and into a caster group so they can drop Mana tide, then swapping them back quickly once Mana tide is done so the melee doesn't have too much lost time from windfurys buff.  Same deal with moonkin aura, they don't do great DPS on their own, but that 3% crit never hurt your 4 top casters, and can outweigh the loss of swapping another SM/ruin lock for the balance, not to mention gaining another brez and innervate.
---
Personally, I'm looking at bringing one enhance to swing a nightfall and totem twist (grace of air and windfury buffs at the same time) for a melee group, myself as a feral tank providing LotP for another melee/tank group, one spriest to buff lock damage, and 1 moonkin to buff my top caster group.
---
I'm not pushing for any world firsts, I'm not looking to even get any server firsts, I'm just looking at bringing a few "suboptimal" specs that I believe can be beneficial to the raid overall.  I'm going to demand the people playing those specs play like total tryhards more than I would expect from a more meta spec, but I think that just letting them have a dedicated raid spot for that spec will give them enough incentive to actually go hard for us on their own accord.
---
Just my two cents as a former hardcore raid lead who wants to take another crack at it, but with less assholeish min maxing demands this time around.
---
You think wrong.  The goal for a raiding guild is to lower their clear times.  This is especially important when there is a lot of raid content available.  Being able to do mc/bwl in 2 hours is important if you want to raid aq40. Faster clears also means less consumes (less farming), less burnout (losing players), and it gives you a challenge with content that isn't challenging.
---
By that logic, I should be tipping people who bless me after I sneeze, hold doors for me when entering a building, letting me merge into traffic.
---
Everyone should be doing kind deeds to be kind, not with the expectation that someone will compensate them for it.
---
&gt; If you are annoyed by pushy people asking you to do shit without so much as a please or a thank you, then you should be the first one to buck up your change as a thank you in return for other people's charity.
---
Not going to change people who just plop stuff in your window.
---
I honestly think you should find another player who hasn't played vanilla before and group with them to enjoy exploring. Some of my favorite times were me and friends figure the game out together.
---
So, I think I’ve narrowed it down. Druid, Mage, Warlock, Warrior. In Retail I really like Druid. I love all 4 specs, I love the fantasy, I love the flexibility.
---
In classic, I plan on hitting sixty and tanking dungeons. Maybe raiding? 
---
But I know Druid falls off in raids and really only heals.
---
Can a Druid tank dungeons well or off tank in raids? Are druids in demand? Does alliance or Horde need druids more? I’m worried about putting in time to get to 60, and then realizing I’m sort of a dead class. Obviously love Druids and being a rare class.
---
Mage seems like the ultimate QoL class, but I’m concerned about finding groups for dungeons and raids while also competing for loot with tons of other mages. Their rotation also seems a little too easy. Not crazy about class fantasy, but the play style in retail is fun.
---
Warlock seems strong, but worse in PvE due to no threat reduction. They’re also more in demand, and have less gear competition and free mount at 40. They also seem like mages with more maintenance in the form of farming soul shards. Like the fantasy of enslaving demons, and being a more rare snowflake class.
---
Warrior is a pain to level, but if I tank one I’ll never have an issue getting into a group no matter what content I want to do. But then I’ll have to really commit to a guild and consistently show up for raids, and I’m not sure if I’m going to be that hardcore.
---
I don’t really know which one to pick, but I’m trying to just talk out loud to see what everyone else has to say. Any input is appreciated.
---
I kinda wanna make a raiding guild purely of meme specs and see if we can actually clear stuff.
---
Load up on bear druids, prot and ret Paladins, a melee hunter group, moonkin brigade, shadow priests and warlocks using up all our debuff slots. Throw in an Arcane Missiles mage. You get the idea.
---
All of our priests will be Night Elves, no fear wards, and no humans racials allowed for anyone.
---
&lt;MaxMin&gt;
---
Everything in this post with the exception of the title is focused on getting unarmored mounts in. You came in and accused OP of trying to equate the two, when really he just said "one issue down, now can we tackle this one?". Also unarmored mounts are not a progressive itemization argument. They are not items that were updated in the course of vanilla. They are unique (in comparison to the armored mounts) items that had a limited availability. To make them completely unavailable isn't the same thing as having the 1.X version of an item available rather than the 1.12 version.
---
Ah, the tension between submitting a link to send people directly to your Twitch channel for revenue vs. submitting a post where you could explain what you're doing and why we should care...
---
Yeah, exactly and with the gnomeregan mace you can even further boost your dps... but that involves a lot of farming 😉
---
Rogue is actually not a great bg class at all.
---
Hopefully I will be able to lock down the name "steve"

This classic community on this reddit doesn't understand sarcasm.
---
Noone says it never happened. The thought is that people are going to be less tolerant of meme specs now than they were 15 years ago because it is now very well known how little you contribute to the raid. It also causes drama with loot. Holy paladins want gear to pvp with in ret spec too. But this one ret guy who refuses to help out the team and  heal expects to snag all the pvp gear from the holy palas bc its his " main spec" gear.
---
Is MB against TOS?
---
an authentic experience purist
---
curious if he feels same about layering
---
&gt;Its not a race. If you try to be 100% efficient while leveling, chances are you wont enjoy the game as much either
---
Kind of annoying when I see stuff like this. Just because **YOU** don't enjoy speed leveling doesn't mean I will not enjoy it **MYSELF**. I'm all for people taking time and enjoying the game, but I prefer mix/maxing my leveling experience as much as I can because I find that fun. And on a side note..... this kind of content is better than 80% of the other content on the sub  (just my opinion obviously).

---
&gt;Warcraft III: Reforged is a stunning reimagining of the revolutionary **real-time strategy game** that laid the foundation for Azeroth’s most epic stories.
---
Honestly, it feels like just yesterday I was staring at the 100 day countdown. Now we're halfway there. Soon, brothers and sisters.
---
Can someone do a copy+paste for us poor souls stuck behind a firewall?
---
I can’t help but feel like regular PvE realms have no purpose. So you don’t like to pvp, and you don’t like to role play.. what’s the point of playing a ROLE PLAYING GAME based on two factions AT WAR? Do pve players just run dungeons to get better loot to run dungeons to get better loot to raid yo get better loot to sit in stormwind and talk about the game being dead? I’ve never dared to roll a toon a pve realm to find out because it just seems like such a depraved and pointless place.
---
Oh I'm sure. That's why I never understand that stuff, because it isn't something that can continue.
---
Which is why I wanted to clarify for all the people that don't.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I didn't specify which region I am from (NA).
---
It’s a beta, who cares
---
The solution to meme specs and raiding is simple.
---
The maximum respec cost is 50g. Lower it to 5g-10g.  This will allow them to raid in a viable spec, earn top gear for their meme specs, and they can enjoy the spec outside of raid
---
This will also improve the quality of pvp and increase the amount of players engaging in pvp (many people won't pvp because they are stuck in a pve spec)
---
An extra hit like wf proc is considerable and could be calculated, but a 3% crit chance in an rng game is not.
---
This guys plugin will probably just get banned.  Waste of time.
---
I’ve updated the original post in this thread with:
---
    “Melee leeway” is working as intended.
---
After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.
---
There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.
---
- Kaivax
---
No, which is why damage meters are crap and don't matter unless you're hitting boss enrage timers.
---
It depends how you want to go really.  You can go SM ruin and really have to put in work (https://pastebin.com/v0f83deX) or go SL and just dot everything and outlive everyone.
---
Cool thing about a feral tank in particular, is they soak trash loot!  Aside from rings/neck/cloaks, almost all of their ideal gear is stuff that no one else really wants.
---
Obviously there is some crossover between stuff a feral tank and a rogue wants, but for the most part that issue doesn't really crop up until AQ40/Naxx, and it's only for a few pieces.  MC/Ony/BWL?  It's almost all crap that a rogue wouldn't be interested in unless they're replacing greens.
---
It means he doesn’t want Logurt Paul and PooDiePie and their respective meme teams on his realm
---
Update drivers and reboot
---
Thanks from Germany, Blizzard!
---
Mhmm yeah see what you mean. Point begin that when people talk about how bad enchantment shammys are for instance they often refer to dps meters as their proff so in that case specifically, it would be interesting to see how much higher they would rank on those lists
---
Make sure that the party doesn't go all ragey on the mobs from the get-go. You need time to build up rage and aggro on the mob, and have it stick to you. Most of the time, a warr tank will say "no dps until 2/3 sunders" and then you hope to hell that your group follows that. 
---
Your rage builds on several things. The damage you deal, and the damage you take. So it's important for the mob to have some uninterrupted time with you before others slam on the DPS, or you will have little rage to use your abilities.
---
Please don't let someone else tell you that you cannot play some class build race combo because it's inferior in DPS to another setup.  I'm assuming this is coming from you wanting to play something but the elitists say it's useless and you want to prove justification.
---
Understand that no matter what server and class/race you pick you will find a raiding home.  The people here claiming MEME spec this and MEME spec that are idiots.  Each class has its place in build and buffs and no matter what will find a spot in raids.   The 40 man raids will be drawing in all types and constantly, there will be no barrier.
---
That's why I said I dont really care about Blizzard one way or the other
---
my heart will hurt deeply if I start leveling get to like \~20 and then find out I picked one with asmon/soda
---
Cheers man. Good to hear that reinforcement :)
---
pservers all had the same leeway. its the dad gamers who havent played in 15 years complaining
---
Eh, with what people know now, i.e. tryharding on every pull with full consumables, world buffs, perfectly optimized gear from BiS lists, etc. I think its a bit more of a limiting factor than you might think. 
---
I feel legitimately bad for the tank in the semi-casual guild that is 2-4 months behind the curve on his server and is just getting started on raiding. There will be N number of wannabe tryhards in his guild who will go out and grab all the world buffs right before the first time their guild steps foot into molten core and those guys might do literally 40-60% more dps than most other normal raid members in greens and blues. And what happens those first few pulls? A shit show, obviously. 
---
Threat is definitely a concern again, and its honestly going to be worse for middle-of-the-pack guilds with a  mix of casuals and low-budget tryhards who are aware of the meta and how to exploit aspects of it, but don't have the actual high-level experience to know how to manage the threat that comes with that increase in power.   
---
Only saving grace here is that most of these buffs don't persist through death, and most of the aforementioned tryhards will just die on trash when they pull threat. :)
---
Oh is that so? Care to explain to everyone else?
---
what do you mean? I don't use it because I don't play retail.
---
Not really. By then you've unlocked most abilities to help you deal with more than one NPC at a time, so it tends to be a lot safer if you're not including pvp. You're also just a few levels away from mount.
---
Slower maybe. Not harder.
---
Why can’t there be Tauren rogues.
---
I´m saying no one back then went hot for this gear and we still rolled through Molten Core. Why waste a ton of gold then? Demand will be lower than you expect which affects prices.
---
Some people are just rolling those builds because they're masochists and wanna try and change the meta around them too, despite knowing the risks.
---
Thank God I'm in Alaska, it will feel exactly the way it did all the way back in '06!
---
Layering is only meant to alleviate tourist attrition.
---
You can keep misunderstanding it, but it’s a poor design.
---
Oh yeah no worries I am either going elemental shaman or oomkin ;)
---
Heck, the real world doesn't have native non-human races like elves, dwarves, or trolls about to make us used to the idea of non-humans as people, either.  A bunch of bloodthirsty aliens come through a portal to *Earth* and murder millions?  They are all *super* dead.  Lucky for the orcs they went to Azeroth instead.
---
I definitely wouldnt either, but i would take a meme spec if i knew the person was geared and knew how to play as it does turn into being a support character instead of a dps
---
Every game is dead nowadays, god i hate this generation.
---
*Screams at the clouds like an old man*
---
Not if you’re a nurse doing night shift.
---
 Torn between warlock and priest.
---
 I'm gonna play PvE casually, so only dungeons and PUG raids. Is it hard to get into such groups as any of these classes? I know that tanks are usually in higher demand, but what about healers? And as a warlock, will I have to compete with other classes that have higher dps early on?
---
* Now that EU got their Language specific servers, can we get Unarmored mounts back?
---
* Now that OCE servers were announced, can we get Unarmored mounts back?
---
* Now that another stress test was announced, can we get Unarmored mounts back?
---
* Now that &lt;insert any unrelated topic&gt;, can we get Unarmored mounts back?
---
It makes no sense. It doesn't help your case. If you want to convince Blizzard you need to come up with a better argument than
---
&gt;"You should include Unarmored Mounts because you added German and French servers."
---
Time to gear, cost of repairs, consumables, resist gear, etc.  Big investment.
---
Elune be praised
---
&gt;When did they lie the first time?
---
Never? I said some people claimed that, not that i believe they did.
---
Same with the refernce server, im not saying they are lying about that, im saying other people have said so, is that not clear in my comment?
---
&gt; but the mages and warlocks were below him at under 800. The warriors and rogues were also doing around 1000DPS in that fight.
---
Just because he's raiding with scrubs it doesn't mean that's the dps they should be doing. what the fuck is wrong with you, did you lose the ability to think?
---
&gt; as i've already addressed those points several times...
---
You think you did, but you really didn't.
---
So this is going to make classic FEEL different from your actual authentic vanilla experience... 
---
Why is blizzard being so silly here? This much Leeway makes no sense with 2019 latency speeds! You can still have leeway but please tune it down!
---
not worth it
---
With the recent announcement of language specific EU servers I’m hyped even more.
---
I was really confused as I was on crushridge and never saw an Italian, but I'm guessing there was crushridge EU (Italian) and NA (obviously not Italian). I would have thought they used different names in NA and EU to avoid confusion
---
Hunter or Mage are pretty good as a partner.
---
Maybe I picked a bad example. Offset leather gear for feral druids would be a better one.
---
If you aren't DS, you have imp out for stam buff.  It does no damage because you keep it phase shifted.
---
Warlock + rogue is actually super powerful and underplayed. You mentioned TBC; by S3 fully geared I’d say it’s more deadly than popular mage rogue.
---
&gt;Let’s be constructive 
---
&gt;Layering does nothing for the starting rush. 
---
missed the mark there lad
---
Bro I was talking about OP. Not you. My bad I should have clarified.
---
Shadows guide you
---
That's what I said...
---
It's not the aggro pulling that makes me mad, it's the running away part :D
---
Nochanges to the code obviously?
---
*Breaks out of camp*

---
I gotta ask because I've never seen it been used before, what does sperg mean?
---
Thank you for your insight. I think I've made up my mind now. I appreciate it!
---
\&gt;  You can quest and do almost all of them solo in every game version. 
---
That's not even close to true with regards to Vanilla.  
---
\&gt;  Franchise always comes before the game genre. 
---
That's not true. If it was, then you should be wondering why the narrative is Hearthstone is SOOO different from that of Warcraft and WoW.
---
August 13th? we don't have the time of the char creation yet, but for launch it's on the 26th at 23h00 in London and midnight in Paris for example, so for char creation if it's any time in Paris, you'll be looking at one hour prior to that in London
---
For the 5 seconds that they have mana.
---
I dont think that it would change that much, as it would require you to have the other 2 dps to be rogue or warrior for the full effect, and because rogues cant get it if they have poisons on their main wep. And for the fact that i is only really good for 2h warriors because it only affects your mainhand
---
&gt; gain, go look up all the spell damage mail in MC &amp; BWL. Oh, Naxx too.
---
are you high?
---
It's still plenty smooth.
---
Biggest obstacle: Activision Blizzard
---
I work in a cushy accounting job after putting in 80+ hour weeks in public accounting. Essentially, they offer unlimited flexibility, I can work from home and flex my schedule as much as I want as long as I meet deadlines. 
---
The working hours are 7-4 (or 8-5) and any time after that I have to myself and WoW. (Since the wife plays too!) Since I can work from home, there’s no commuting time, and I generally eat meals that are grab and go. (Hard boiled eggs for breakfast; banana, apple, and carrots for lunch, chicken breast with corn for dinner- legit just throw in the oven and eat)
---
Well, looks like the opposite happened. Beta is done on the 12th.
---
Is there a specific post with details around this stuff? Is it just that anyone with an active sub can login and reserve a name?
---
&gt; "one issue down, now can we tackle this one?"
---
More like "You should include Unarmored Mounts because you added FR/DE servers." Which makes zero sense.
---
At least it's nice we agree that Language Servers are completely unrelated to Mounts.
---
Good job beta tester! Very valuable.
---
Yeah, but those are totally different things. I never claimed anything else about private servers, only leeway.
---
For those who don't know what this means, that means that [This](https://youtu.be/S3GH5cWPFOE) is correct.
---
Tauren now OP.

Hi either going elemental shaman or oomkin ;), I'm dad.
---
Damage meters don’t track synergy.  Pretty easy to theory craft out though.  Assume BWL geared balance druids to 500 DPS, and mages do 950.  Ceteris Paribus, that 3% crit adds what, 3% more damage?  In a group of 4 mages that’s 114 more DPS, so even if you attribute that to the Druid, they’re doing 614 DPS to another mages 950.  The Druid has to increase the mages’ damage by 11.8% to justify the DPS difference.
---
Nothing fair enough about it my mate. Some servers may have had a lot more, maybe Bronzebeard did, just never came across any or recollect any tarren mill or x roads action. In all fairness the alliance to horde ratio was a massive gulf, so as I say maybe you're right about other servers that had a more equal population 😄
---
This is a valid point, add to the fact that Ret's dps in PVE is completely laughable even in BIS gear it's weak you are literally a pre-bis Fury Warrior lmfao.
---
Lock's get trashed until death coil because you have no other way to create space early on.
---
Both. Those servers are why spell batching was possible, which they're trying to recreate.
---
I'm hoping to get on an ally-friendly realm this time. 
---
When I started playing just before BC, the guys who got me into WoW played on a horde-heavy server (Thrall), even though they play mostly ally (ikr??).  Needless to say, we all couldn't afford server transfers, and so we're all still on Thrall. Faction servers actually had an impact on the game back in the day when the division between the Alliance and the Horde was a bigger thing. They've made some quality of life changes that help battle that inequity now, but those QoL's weren't in vanilla and so I'm keeping that in mind when I pick a server.
---
In vanilla it mattered what the faction was of the person who tagged the mob first. I remember horde players purposely killing things so I couldn't - and there were just so many more of them - everywhere. 
---
It was annoying back when the Auction Houses weren't all combined, except for the one in Booty Bay (and Gadgetstan, right?) and there wasn't much volume to buy/sell because the ally server pop was low.  It didn't make leveling more difficult, it just make it frustrating to be the minority faction on a server.
---
Funny thing is that I didn't realize that this wasn't a 'normal' WoW experience until I started playing on other servers. Seriously, it was a completely different game for me seeing so many people in my faction! The cities were alive! There were plenty of mats to buy on the AH! There were other people doing the same quests as me and we could group up! 
---
I also seem to remember people being more 'jerky'  back in the day, but since the hate between the factions isn't actually a part of the game anymore and they're not competing against each other for resources, I feel like people are much kinder to each other regardless of faction nowadays.
---
Off the top of my head: movement, key bindings, (if they dont bring over voice coms) communication, pretty much all of the game interacting isn't set up for VR. Unless you are talking about just having the headset on and still using keyboad, then it's probably just not worth trying to convert it for VR.
---
I would think 5 War/Rogues vs 4 War/Rogues and a Shammy for WF would come out with the WF group on top.
---
White damage makes up a significant amount of overall DPS for those classes. Throwing Windfury into the mix for 4 of them probably easily makes up for having a lack of one of them.
---
Where do hunters currently stand in relation to this? Are they still bugged out the ass?
---
No, because everyone else seems to understand. If *you* need help, there are plenty of resources and dev interviews/posts explaining how and why it's being implemented.
---
&gt; On top of this, people were so bad back then that they rarely strayed from their classes main armour type.
---
&gt; Same goes for a lot of the hybrid spellcasters, who would straight up not roll on cloth gear...
---
&gt; Most of my best gear isn't even cloth btw... :) Again, go look up all the spell damage mail in MC &amp; BWL. Oh, Naxx too. Gear is the least of my concern.
---
Man you really need to have a talk with yourself about the point you're trying to make.
---
I am pretty sure some higher up moneysharks at Activision already removed all toilets in order so save time&amp;money. Employees have now up to 12 minutes more time per day to come up with cool ingame swag locked behind a paywall.
---
He's right though, in a sense.  HDD Manufacturers chose to "round down" to the 1000MB designation and, to them, 1000MB = 1GB whereas the true representation of a GB is 1024MB (which is the notation used by Windows)
---
If you pick up a warrior and just try to play without knowing all the tricks you're gonna have a bad time
---
&gt;We went around acting as adventurers
---
Acting as \*Saviors of Azeroth. FTFY  
---
I think we disagree to what extent each game is about the NPCs. I would say that Vanilla is FAR less about the NPCs than the current game. And I think that is so obvious that most people would agree with me on that point.
---
Thanks for the intel. I didn’t got the subtility you mention.
---
Are you stating fact ?
---
I only see players talk about server merging not blizzard themself.
---
Your proposition bring many other issue : 
---
How do you group with someone from another layer ?
---
How do you handle guildes on différents layer  ? 
---
It still double the amount of ressources available if every layer are on the same AH.
---
I’am pretty sure there are way more that I missed.
---
This. And always have a good wand at hand.
---
[You already can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx4fRPTZYCg). Warning: the guy is kind of annoying and loud.
---
&gt;and now we don't have to hear about leeway on this sub anymore.
---
The hunters and mages will have converted to #somechanges now, atleast based on the other leeway threads where pvp was "ruined" with this leeway.
---
I never accused you of lying.
---
Was just asking how “other people” have accused blizzard of lying in the past when they have the reference client.
---
well lore wise the tauren had no affiliation and only ran into orcs through thrall so they would have a entirely different perspective, which can be related to certain things in real life. The lore in older warcraft was way better then recent stuff since it was based on the fun idea of crazy war, no main character plot, and just people murdering/doing stuff
---
Why not a second rogue or druid?
---
&gt; I'm just telling you what Blizzard said when they even started the initial conversation about any form of sharding (layering is a form of sharding). And they still are saying that this is the point of layering. 
---
They're not saying that's the point of layering. They were saying that about sharding.
---
&gt; layering is a form of sharding
---
Layering and sharding are two different things. One is not a form of the other.
---
They don't use the terms interchangably, and they explicitly state that layering is a separate "new tech". Moreover, if you listen to what they actually said in the panel you quoted earlier, they were very specifically talking about sharding individual areas of the map.
---
You can call me a pedant all you want, but that's NOT layering.
---
&gt; You saying something doesn't make it right. And it doesn't solve this.
---
Ok then. Blizzard developers like Omar Gonzolez have said it:
---
"Under this paradigm, when you log in to Northshire or whatever starter zone you're in, you *are* going to be seeing an entire realm's population worth of characters in the world all competing for the same spot. However, because it's dynamic and flexible, for the launch periods we can accommodate more people on a specific realm in order to ensure that we provide the play experience and availability without having to wait a crazy amount of time in the login queue"
---
He also actively refers to layering as a "new technology" and "whole new solution". This isn't another version of sharding, it's a separate thing.
---
&gt; And Blizzard (and many people on any of the Classic WoW forums) still say that it is technically helping reduce that starting area overpopulation (and consider this one of, if not the, main reasons for layering) due to the fact that with the newer (than Vanilla launch) server tech we can have potentially 10's of thousands of people on one server, and layering breaks that down into 3000 people chunks.
---
Blizzard isn't saying this. ***Players*** are saying this. It stems from the misconception that Blizz would otherwise allow everyone to log into the server all at once. They're not going to do that. The world would still have a limit (probably something similar to 3000 people per continent), and you'd be waiting in a queue for hours to get in. There would probably also be extra servers to handle the load.
---
So:  
---
* without layering you'd have a login queue and still have thousands of players competing over mobs in the starter zones.  
---
* WITH layering, you have no (or at least reduced) login queue and still have thousands of players competing over mobs in the starter zones.
---
Layering doesn't solve starter-area overpopulation. It only solves login queues.
---
SHARDING would potentially solve both of these issues, but that's not on the table.
---
&gt; Yes it did. They both did. I sat in a queue for the actual Beta and 2 stress tests.
---
I never saw a single queue for either stress test, despite starting during the first few hours.
---
The starter areas were fucking ***packed***, though.
---
I reported all Bugs  I found. You are delusional if you think any Beta-Tester plays the Game 24/7 just to find Bugs.
---
The whole “I feel like I can’t make a special play” quote hit way to hard. Most of the time I when I was playing BFA I would just feel like “why am I doing this?” “Why don’t I just sit AFK it’s the same result?”
---
Was in Whitehorse for a while trying to game. Was hard man.
---
Would be a nice touch that when you go to install this popped up just to give that little extra feel to the launch.
---
MUWHAHAHAHAH
---
I was right about one thing, that totally validates my existence and makes me feel like a smarty smart boi.
---
Italians english is very poor in most cases. It's not taught in school afaik.
---
It's even simpler than that; it doesn't have to be an enh. shaman giving the melee buffs. So you can have that extra warrior and still get windfury/SoE... and chain heals.
---
Only you know if the name you want is worth wasting two weeks of playtime.
---
I really don't think buffing 4 people is better than having 5, personally.
---
i member those
---
It really depends how you define "as intended"
---
 "There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as **expected**. "
---
It's working as expected. Leeway mechanic wasn't "intended" for 2019 internet. The entire argument has always been if we want/need a technology intended for 2006 in a 2019 environment. That argument is still as valid as ever. Even blizzard confirms " it might feel different" for people with low ping. Which will be the majority today. So the question is really if we want it to **feel** like vanilla or keep it as is, for the sake of no changes.
---
This is the result you can **expect** when you use a technology from 2006 that is based on lag compensation - when there is none.
---
Please, it's _suomireaver_
---
or jonnereaver
---
I do this when fishing. Drop them good cat a nice fish in between.
---
That's how I learned English! I was so fascinated with the MMORPG genre that I joined FFXI and WoW when it was released. I had no idea what anything meant so I played with a dictionary next to me for completing quests and such.
---
I still vividly remember searching for "slay" because a quest told me it was an objetive and I had no clue how to complete it.
---
The disastrous original launch was basic blizzard expected like a 100'000 players at release and got 500'000 (not exact numbers but you get the point) and this was also when they were a much smaller company. Lets not pretend this is remotely the same scenario
---
nope, I had a crappy pc but very good internet when wow launched, everything always went fine
---
Exactly. But some people just want it removed and fish for any reason to justify it being gone.
---
Oh, i guess it was the same as the "no"changes people who wanted the damage increased in dungeons?
---
If they truly are for no changes then they shouldnt want melee leway to be changed.
---
Read Blizzards blue post again.
---
You’re still going to be in a starter area with 500 other people fighting for wolves and boars
---
"onixia" smh....
---
Does she look less like a dude?
---
I've ran with druid before and it's amazing World PVP as you both can stealth and the CC is amazing (bear stun/root ect).  But yes, I agree deminishing returns once you hit duels and BG
---
Work is da poops!
---
221 is a real shitstorm

Arghhh... I'm so jealous right now haha. I just graduated and got no experience so my current employer sucks ass, but I should be able to work from home next year with some experience... and luck. Also, good job on finding a gamer girl that plays with you! Been slowly working on introduing my gf to videogames for almost 8 years now, but she rarely finds something she likes. Good job man, you give me hope!
---
Enjoy the good life :D
---
The stress test had layering
---
You can’t group with another layer. Each layer would be its own server which was their stated goal before this. It’s odd now that they changed AH and general chat to accommodate entire server
---
Nah AOE leeway is also a thing, nova while jumping and you root a warrior from across the globe.
---
Same for AE
---
Well, playing dps once in a while also satisfy that itch haha
---
Outside of WoW I am very political and sometimes I try to analyze WoW through a political lens as a fun exercise. 
---
First and foremost, while the Orcs did indeed invade Azeroth, they did so under a literal mind control/manipulation of their psyche (borderline hypnoses)  via the Burning Legion. Now, I can't remember if the humans knew that during the first and second wars, but that does complicate things a little bit because it begs the question, "was it really the orcs doing this"? 
---
Regardless, the Orcs know why the atrocities they committed were committed and that's why the feel so strongly about Dournholde, I assume the humans know about it today and to my knowledge they haven't apologized for it but I could be wrong.
---
I played classic and TBC, but quit shortly after that.
---
I am considering coming back for classic, though I know the experience will be a lot different over 10 years later.
---
On the twin emps as a non-tanking warlock: a shadowbolt targeting the caster emp that is midair when the emps teleport will swerve like a heat-seeking missile to the caster emp's new position, hit him, and possibly pull agro if it crits and the tank warlock has not yet cast searing pain, probably resulting in a wipe.
---
&gt;We’ll make sure Ragnaros and Onyxia are ready to go
---
Spoilers!
---
Yeah I remember back in TBC paladins were actually valued more highly for 5 man dungeons simply because their aoe threat was much better. I remember lots of groups straight up refusing to do shattered halls with anything other than a pally tank, for example.
---
I dont know about whelp armor specifically, but hibernate is a disorient effect just like freezing trap.
---
However Scatter shot however is listed as a confuse effect here so its strange that it shares DR with trap.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
&gt;All Confusion effects have been renamed Disorient effects. This includes Blind, Scatter Shot, etc.
---
Ah that’s right. You can’t explain it, because you’re wrong about it, and responding anything other than what you wrote would be a hit to your pride.
---
At the very least stop spreading false info
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND

You know there's more hybrid spellcasters than just Shamans right...? Balance druids and shadow priests are the ones that roll on cloth gear.

"Defend?"
---
Did blizz make this meme, jfc
---
"Actor Henry Cavill played WoW during vanilla.  He said that Onyxia's Lair was his favorite raid."
---
They were a *shaman* based society, not conquerors. If they were conquerors, they'd have slain the Draenei without the demon blood and taken their hidden civilization for themselves.
---
Or when you're bored and have trash food
---
Imagine being schizophrenic and thinking I said anything of the sort. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yep pretty much all classes provide buffs (other than rogues) so it would be utterly pointless. Probably the only hybrid that would look better is shaman because WF is such a big deal.
---
They got the authentic spell batching. This is how it was in 2006. They never wanted authentic. They wanted what private servers did.
---
Turn off taunt.
---
It's likely many of the bugs we've seen that haven't been fixed yet have already been fixed internally
---
You're really just asking for network tuning, which is entirely reasonable.
---
Yeah i dont know how would they ever be able to tune something to "feel" like it did back in the days. Especially somthing like leeway.
---
Layers are meant to mimic a regular 3k pop server
---
The alternative was simply have normal 3k pop servers
---
Since all layers will be equally full at roughly 3k pop except for the newest layer, all those layers will experience the same wait as a Norma non-layered server at 3k pop
---
Layering does nothing for the wait for Garrick. You’d have the same wait on a non-layered server with same pop.
---
Unfortunatly, nothing new for 1.12 :(
---
If your healer is oom and the boss isn't dead, it's a DPS issue.
---
Dat be good choice, mon!
---
Did anyone have low ping in 2006? This is a huge change to gameplay for the majority of players. 
---
I don’t think very much leeway is required with 2019 pings.
---
Agree so much, I played age 18-24. The fact that the game was so difficult made the accomplishments and friendships that much more meaningful.
---
It would be a hell of a coincidence if its not the same person, but its a reference to Mat Cauthon from the Wheel of Time series who has incredible luck, so it *could* be someone else? Seems reasonable that its the same person though, especially if it was a hunter.
---
Is there a benefit in rolling Human vs Dwarf for pallies? Plan is to go the usual route, Ret while lvling, Holy for end-game
---
The Succubus needs... something like love
---
I need half a roll per shit...
---
I think it provide a worse experience for the player base.  It's creating a new experience that didnt excist back in 2004 due to the difference infrastructure/lag
---
Most people have played on private servers far longer than retail vanilla. And even if you didn't, vanilla ended 12 years ago. It'd be shocking if you remember the details about something you weren't explicitly knowledgeable about in the first place.
---
I am first and foremost a Horde player, always have and always will be.  
---
My guild and I rolled Alliance toons when our servers were offline to just mess around. I think if I was to roll Alliance, I'd roll a Dwarf, but I have no love for any of the Alliance races. I love IF and I often visit it as a Horde player, but I'm not a fan of the Alliance "experience".  
---
Lore / story wise, there's a difference, but other than that, it's pretty much the same. There are some clear indications that Blizz put a little extra thought / love into Alliance vs Horde, but I have a bias opinion.  
---
Plan for Classic is to play Horde again, but this time play a different class from the start.   
---
No one will be able to recreate Vanilla or "the glory days", because Classic is not Vanilla, but we'll get close.
---
Sacre bleu!
---
I thought people would accept me as a balance druid
---
I’ve watched a couple videos from Skarm who swears by bear tank, saying that there are benefits like better maximum armor rating potential etc etc. 
---
If I enjoy the niche aspect of druid, I feel like feral is definitely a solid option, no?
---
That's a bit too far fetched as far as speculations go for me, considering it was a closed beta that got updated every couple days (though very minor things, mostly).
---
I saw a post from someone with the beta recently saying the pet aggro dropping bug had been fixed. But there’s still some other major bugs that are putting a lot of people off hunters still - FD into trap not working in bgs , melee leeway, auto attack bugs. Really want to roll hunter and could live with some minor bugs but these 3 alone are pretty major.
---
Correct
---
yeahhh it's not very different from forums where you make a post and the first response is "DID YOU READ THE RULES BEFORE POSTING?!?!"
---
shit's 90% the rules, and then 10% the topic that forum was made for. and what are subreddits if not an alias for "forum"?
---
I've made plenty of comments like yours there and don't get hit for them. There's literally no reason to be so fucking anal about the rules, it's not like /r/classicwow has advertisers they need to keep happy. Forum moderation is literally for people who need to fabricate responsibility in life
---
 #NOCHANGES
---
 am I right folks?
---
As a melee player im really looking forward to this.
---
Did you think i was serious about pvp being ruined? Isnt it very obvious sarcasm?
---
I know aoe leeway exist, it was even increased by two yards on the beta since it was too small
---
Yes. That's how it was in 2006.

There's just way too many anomalies that you didn't account for in your shit data!

"relax"

Lol wat
---
You can't support your argument that toxicity occurs in conversations of class choice with a fallacious example.
---
Ele shamans are a burst class. So you will be using max ranks to pick targets. You shouldn’t be mindlessly spamming spells. They will just get healed. Your job is to 100-0 a target. Look for a kill and take it. Setup a kill with someone who has cc. Blow those people up. Don’t tickle them with static electricity. Hit them with the power of Zeus.
---
YouTube can also show you everything you’ll need to know for whichever class you want. I rolled a warrior on a private server a few weeks ago and was dying so much. Then I looked up some guides on YouTube and realized that was normal.
---
Then it showed me that I should not facetank mobs and that I should be hamstringing mobs and kiting them around so they hit me less so I will die less or that my weapon is the single most important item a warrior needs and I should focus on finding upgrades to that.
---
There is quite a bit of nuance to classic WoW that I absolutely loved because of little things like this.
---
Exactly. This is the correct debate. Blizzard is knowingly changing the gameplay experience for the majority of players by implementing 2006 lag mechanics in 2019. Which I think is wrong. I believe leeway should be toned down to account for 2019 pings.
---
Meaningful difference in playing horde? Standards, respect for yourself. Filthy humans...
---
Zug zug
---
I'm probably rolling a Shaman, as that's the class I remember enjoying most in Vanilla. 
---
The only thing I'm not exactly sure about anymore is whether Elemental or Enhancement is easiest for leveling purposes. I'm going to take things chill and PVP a lot while leveling up together with a group of mates. Any tips are welcome :)
---
It's one of the most played classes yet most raids will only bring 2-3.
---
Always a surplus of hunters...
---
No they're overalls
---
You’ll need gear to play at a high level and if you don’t have the time to run around collecting your required items then you’ll struggle to keep up with other warriors that are able to

Are there not potentially a lot of missed bugs in 40-60 content?
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night. The adults are trying to discuss Classic.
---
Not mc or bwl, no, but good luck getting c'thun down or more than half the bosses in naxx (even with appropriate gear)
---
I did 4.5 days on a fresh private server as a hunter. It's not quite as much prep as you are making it out to be.
---
I did some practice runs to 20 to try and get that route down pat because I wanted to get ahead of the pack asap, but after that I mostly followed routes that others created and if I was ever short on XP or having bad luck with a quest I just grinded a level out as fast as I could.

I thought I could be an enhancement shaman and still raid in a casual / semi hardcore guild... Till I realized they only take 1 and it's always the guy that will put in 40+hours of consumable farming a week.

 While we haven’t yet finalized the numbers of realms and realm types for  each language, we’ll let you know those details before name  reservations start on August 13.

So, there might still be a chance for RpPvP types.

it’s the way classic was release back then  ? Or Am I missing something ? 
---
I’am pretty sure the goal is to avoid merging and the community backlash that can come with. Wich is arguably not that bad, but I totally understand where you come from. 
---
As someone that plays from vanilla to TBC it as always feel like a community wich is not the case anymore. 
---
Men that feeling when people where clicking on me because I was one of the few to own S3 shoulder on my server back in TBC !
---
Wheeeelllp. There goes my dreams of recreating my tauren Hunter. 
---
I think the issue is that it is not needed. Time it down to half. Fuck me man, warriors and rogues will be wrecking my tauren Hunter from 12 yards away 😢
---
Sounds like a solid little group. I probably won’t go Warlock in that case though. Mage, Warlock and Priest are all cloth wearers so 2 is fine but we don’t want 3 of us all rolling for the same gear. There’s also a very good chance my friend and I both change our minds several more times before deciding
---
How about we push all the Europeans off the ENGLISH realms??

---
Basically, when you shapeshift, you usually have 0 energy. There is a talent that gives you 40 instantly on shapeshift. There is a crafted hat that gives you 20. By sacrificing the stats you would get on a decent hat, you can shapeshift, get 60 energy immediately, use shred (something stupid like 350% damage + 184 and very high crit%), human, shapeshift, shred... 
---
Also, there's an addon that displays your energy tick meter. After 1.X seconds, you get 20, and the same meter keeps going even when you're in human form, you just don't get the energy. If you can time it well enough, and if you use the free hits Omen of Clarity gives you, you get two or three shreds before you transform. Shreds eaaasily deals over 1k damage every hit. It's a pretty effective strat with -30% mana cost on transformation, innervate and mana pots.

Retail sub is also Classic sub
---
I just remember having to leave the computer on all night/all day/all night while it downloaded WoW
---
Lmao "knowingly changing the experience" by not changing it. Plenty of people had latency and good internet in 2004-2006. Plenty of people still have shit internet. I love reading these nochanges mental gymnastics.
---
I like that its in there, i just dont personally like it. First toon i made was a hunter and I couldn’t find the right food and my bear left me. Scared me for life. 
---
Think of my trauma all you downvoters :(
---
It's 2 hotkeys. I had pet Atk and passive + follow bound to fwd and back on scroll wheel. By the time you are 60 it will be second nature. Admittedly on a private server but my pet rarely died in MC at least.
---
Well yea, that's the other end of the spectrum. More props to the lolret that brings every portion and buff possible to do dps and spot heal vs mr pvp that gives the raid the middle finger and wants his askhandi.

&gt; The adults are trying to discuss Classic.
---
Classic adult response
---
Really hope so...it is already world of meleecraft. Especially on horde side due to Windfury. And leeway will probably make even more people want to roll a melee.
---
Bring back the OG launcher and OG website thx.
---
Yeah its new construction so the house itself is exactly what we want day 1. However I will have almost no furniture and its a 3,000 sq foot 4br 3br so I will be spending many a weekend building furniture/other stuff, I caaaaaaaaaaant wait. I've got bedframes, cabinets, entertainment stands, desks, chairs, tables, end tables, night tables, coffee tables, oh the tables....
---
For the record, i've been living in shitty apartments/with other people/working full time/in college SINCE WRATH so I have earned it. 
---
Follow your dreams!
---
&gt;and there are not enough debuff slots available to make shadow priest be worth it.
---
Holy crap you really are living under a rock. Not even going to justify that one with a response LMAO
---
Naxxramas has several pieces of mail spell damage gear. Tier 2.5 is universally better than almost every other piece of gear in Naxx though so it doesn't matter much. 
---
I suggest you go and look up private server metas my dude. Shadow Priest made it in to a 30 minute BWL speedrun because of shadow weaving.
---
I think it's the opposite, I don't think modern players actually want what modern studios think they want. Was talking with someone the other day that was bitching that he wished there was a mobile game he could just buy the game and play the game without all the micro transaction crap. This whole micro transaction model was created as a way to squeeze more money out of a game, not as a way to make players happier.
---
I would say this the exact same way... But why? Why do we say the Tauren differs from the Night Elf and not the other way around ?
---
Were you ally as well in classic ?
---
I already have multiple offers for guilds.
---
I been raiding vanilla for 3 years now (took a small break before classic release).
---
What kind of proof would you like?  Want to see my t3 warlock?
---
I was in between both as well. I ended up going with shaman for the easier leveling, and then I'll have a warrior alt I'll funnel stuff to once I get my shaman up.
---
I think it should be tested, maybe half a yard is better for 2019 pings.
---
The point is, either way there is a change. Which makes sense because this is 2019, not 2006.
---
The choice is what change do you want? A change in gameplay experience? Or a change in the original code?
---
I don't have to defend anything. Layering and it's intended purpose is common knowledge. If you want to challenge that, the responsibility is on you to provide proof of otherwise.
---
Btw if you play a Mage on beta there is nothing noticeable about this. You can still aoe farm easily and you still shit on every melee 1v1 unless you're hot garbage.
---
Since you can't order your pet to go to a specific spot, the best way to get him in position is to use Eyes of the beast. Set him on the spot you want, put him on Stay, and then break the control. 
---
There are only a few bosses that require this though, since you only do it on bosses that cleave, or dont have some ability that could easily kill your pet
---
But that would alter the og experience of someone with a low ping.
---
What exactly is the difference? I think I've been using them interchangeably.
---
If it's really a #Nochange where is the proof ?
---
People should really think about what 2006 (2004 actually) was. This is not the 90s. Tons of people had decent ping back then already (and tons of people still have a bad ping). There's no point in changing anything.
---
proof?
---
I'm with ya! I think I'm definitely rolling priest, just deciding between human and dorf. We could use a tank for sure though, even if it is just a pet.. maybe huntard?
---
The original poster said he was new so the advice was directed towards him
---
A highly skilled player will be fine at Hunter. He will get a spot over others due to his performance
---
Maybe with certain quests but most classes have all their main abilities by 40 to test mechanics etc.
---
Oh how far we have come.
---
3.5GB and it ran on a 32-bit operating system. Some say they even got it to run on Windows 98 despite the 2k/XP minimum requirement.
---
Pservers use mango values. So, its meaningless.
---
The post says that people with low latency will experience it correctly, and that more people are on low latency than in the past. So actually less people have the problem than back in the day.
---
Sure did, unless there was something wrong my ping was usually around 80ms.
---
It's basically just deadmines without anything in it, IIRC from pservers.
---
Most dungeons nowadays are just an entrance, but at first they thought that they weren't going to instance dungeons and instead have them be in the open world. That idea didn't pan out, but a few dungeons still exist in the world behind their instance portal, they're just entirely empty.
---
I think only the earlier dungeons had that.
---
Likely tied to local cuisine
---
Based on what, sport?
---
We're crying mostly. 
---
Well, the dream of the elusive melee hunter is closer than ever?
---
I used to think that comment was dumb, but after spending some time on this sub its pretty clear he was correct that many people think they do but actually dont.
---
Well, they came to a conclusion as to what the correct leeway range was back in 2006 for 2006 pings, why couldn't they do the same thing now?
---
Depends, it's a nice spell. How many shamans and priests are in the enemy team, and are they close?
---
I'm new here. Are there going to be central/south american servers?
---
Warcraft is almost oxymoronic with its narrative. At times it makes certain genocides seem acceptable, almost tame, yet we have characters who are permanently shaped by those conflicts. Yet we view them as wrong more often than not. Perhaps all of these views are correct and it is all a matter of perspective.
---
Lol i'm just playing, the writing clearly comes 4th in this story. That explains almost everything.
---
F
---
KEEP YOUR FOOT IN MY ASS!
---
It took me three days to update wow after installing it. I’d literally be covertly logging the computer on the net a few hours a day until it was done. Couldn’t do it when parents where home. Thank goodness for summer.
---
I believe meme specs should be buffed to account for 2019 class knowledge.
---
Almost time to re-up my sub.
---
Thats exactly the point. You're definition of "completely useless" is not a true statement, its like when people say "literally" when its not a literal statement. I'm not arguing that ret pallys and moonkins are good, I'm stating that they are not completely useless and should be shoved into a corner and forgotten about. At the end of the day a ret will still pull DPS, even if he does 50% of the dps of the top dps, that's only equivalent to a 2.5% damage loss across a 40 man raid, or there abouts, so if your guild is wiping on a boss at 5% consistently in MC or BWL, then you should point the finger at the ret pally? People were not clueless in Vanilla, we just wernt obsessed with spreadsheets and min maxxing, we cleared the content, we farmed our consumes, not much has changed playing on pvt servers except people are obsessed with min maxxing, when may be 'efficient' but its not how the game was designed to be played, and ultimately takes away from the fun of classic imo.
---
I downloaded it in the background while running Diablo 2.
---
The lag spikes this caused in D2 were painful, but I powered through it.
---
Ah yes I remember being 13 trying to figure out how to get my firewall to stop blocking the download for days
---
Frost wolf axe looks cool
---
That’s the same shit for spell batching and yet people begged for that....
---
Lol the crazy pick and choose mentality baffles me. 
---
NOCHANGES...unless you know we want something changed. 
---
Fucking Catholics up in here lol
---
I agree that melee in PvP are gonna have a huge boost. When players will master how to play with the leeway and probably some addons will tell you the range between you and the enemy, we'll be able to kill hunters just by using leeway and the deadzone.
---
It's authentic **so i'm ok.** But i hope we get 2500 slots on the servers since it's a technical choice too !
---
Report bug and move on.
---
Because someone with low ping back in the day would have experienced this exact thing, and since its a historical recreation then they shouldnt change the game.
---
I honesty have no idea what I’m looking at. He’s casting Blizzard and runs around?
---
Jealousy would be his reason.
---
more horde propaganda. Taurajo was simply an avoidable accident, not a deliberate massacre
---
Because every joe schmo playing this game will absolutely master how to take advantage of this in every possible scenario 100% of the time.
---
Is it ridiculous by its nature? Honestly yeah. Will it have dire effects on you and ruin your game? No.
---
If you're a mage or a hunter you don't even want to be remotely close to an opponent and even then you have mechanics to deal with that.
---
This game at launch was not meant to be a balances PvP tournament fighter. Have a problem with that? Learn to travel in groups. Its an MMO after all.
---
Hidden racial : Activated.
---
u/justthetipbro22 is literally just copy pasting the same comment over and over again. Don't expect anything of substance from him.
---
Yep. You just generally dont find memespecs in hardcore guilds, and thats fine.
---
In my experience, most people who raid memespec generally put on healing gear instead of tryharding for minimum deeps anyway. You can waltz through content up to AQ with a lot of players like this. Back in the day, I was in the prototypical casual guild, and we would scrape the bottom of the barrel each week to get enough healers to clear MC / Ony / BWL / ZG. A good chunk of those guys were offspec priests / druids / pallies in healing gear.
---
Specs like shadow/ret/balance/enhance etc are all viable in PvP, so a lot of players who want to do both PvP and PvE are really just trying to find a way to raid for gear so they can go melt faces and farm without respeccing once a week. Again, these aren't generally the type of players who join hardcore guilds. If you're hardcore and you want to min-max, you are going to respec.
---
What time zone will this be?
---
I feel bad for boomkins because of what happened in their lives to make them that way
---
Lol as if they need it
---
Unless they can drop combat and get on their mount, my shadow priest will catch them and kill them. As will a mage, or a warlock, or a hunter.
---
They would probably do less than half the damage of a rogue or warrior
---
Because they care about the game and its well-being, and also for selfish reasons.
---
I know, but people said melee leeway would ruin pvp and no one but but mages(and maybe some hunters) would cry about melee leeway.
---
What does my answer have to do with you last sentence bering sarcastic or not?
---
Had a buddy who always kept a backup of his WoW folder (with addons) to bring to LAN parties.
---
Also, back then we were reinstalling our OS's every few months for any number of reasons.
---
We'd share it over LAN, external hard drives, or flash drives when the capacity took off.
---
Definitely came in handy. Those were different times.
---
I’m referring to the wowisclassic link
---
And also make it worse with people still having bad ping. Rural internet in many countries is still pretty bad.
---
Hopefully so ass fucked that they become a mere shell of their former selves. Hopefully. 
---
Seriously fuck that class.
---
Very, very few...
---
&gt;As far as how loot was handled back then. It was a HUDGE no no to use the greed or need. ( even in a pug) Everyone had to pass first on the item.
---
Ahh, the good old days when master loot was too buggy to use and it would take the GMs days to get your loot reassigned if they even did at all, so everyone just crossed their fingers and hoped that no one would ninja loot. 
---
It worked so great. Except when it didn't.
---
I'm not missing the point.  How you say it, even if a person doesn't ask for a tip, they should in theory also reject those tips as well if they were in fact doing it for free.
---
There will always be people that will do a service that doesn't cost them anything.  Those people will never accept tips.  That will never change.  Yes, tipping for services will get more people to offer those services, but that comes with an increase in the average price for those services.  To be clear, we're talking about a video game here, so any point to try to compare this to "tip your bartender" and so on is not the point.  I'm keeping it strictly to WoW and someone wanting/receiving a tip for service.
---
If people feel that those people deserve recognition, but in reality they don't want it, it's not really changing anything.  Those people will still reject tips, will still continue doing free stuff.
---
However, now you have people who realize that doing something to be kind, for little to no additional effort, might lead to a chance of being rewarded.  So now you have new people who are doing it, with expectation of an occasional tip.  Those people will bring more available.  In theory, if nobody tips, they will still provide the service.  However, if they see long enough they are not getting any tips at all, they will stop their service.
---
The third, are people who see that there are people who are ALWAYS willing to tip for service.  Those are the people who will then advertise to only do their service for tips.  More selfish than selfless in the sense that they are only willing to help out others when being paid for their service.  These people, in all technicality, only exist because of the people who felt like paying someone for a service, that they originally did not want payment for.
---
It just means that community of non English speakers congregate on that one server, not a private server.
---
"baguettes and Germans" 
---
Seriously? 
---
Baguette and German?! 
---
Baguette and Strudel, you uncultured bawbag!
---
"Blizzard's reference client" already proved to have a lot of non-vanilla features due to backporting BFA. So that's not a good argument to go with.
---
For real... People are acting as if the majority of players played with a ping of 500 in 2005... 
---
Yes, more people did than nowadays but the majority of players still played with a low ping (&lt;100).
---
All my abilities have built-in macros to spam enable /pvp constantly. Even have it bound to WASD.
---
&gt;Heck, the real world doesn't have native non-human races like elves, dwarves, or trolls about to make us used to the idea of non-humans as people, either.
---
Heck, lots of folks in the real word struggle with the idea of all humans being people...
---
Just do the math for it. I don't think it really matters, if you have individual cases for single boss fights rather than a meaningful average difference in dps across a lot of data points. Whether or not you'll be sad about the results or not, is a different matter, but I think the math should be enough to keep your mind at ease as to what exactly your benefit for the raid is (in additional dps provided)
---
It's how development and deployment works generally, you have separate code branches. One is where the team brings all their changes together, another copies from that at different intervals / manually trigger and deploys to a staging environment (live beta). You don't just keep fixing stuff and pushing it out, you merge everyone's changes, test, do teamwork stuff, then push it out. There is a 99.9999% chance that their master branch is quite a lot further than the beta servers.
---
There isn't much careful positioning you can do against a melee with 12y range.. 
---
Been a hunter main for all my time and there's no way I'll enjoy playing a class that is not going to have a single counter against melee in PVP.
---
Question now is if I should roll Warlock or Rogue.
---
Priest or druid
---
Shouldn’t you be proving the opposite of Blizzard if you think its inaccurate? I have anecdotal, classic rogue experience in my mind to support the notion that this was true, but surely the burden of proof for the contrary falls on you, no?
---
Looks like I'm rolling Warrior! Gotta love Cataclysm melee leeway in Vanilla!!!
---
I made so many characters in Vanilla that I didn't even have a main or a 60. TBC is where I focused one character to max and started raiding. I will be raiding in Classic. No alts until 60 except the level 5 bank alt.
---
How does it get you a free 60 lmao
---
It's solo playable yes. But you CANNOT do nearly all of the quests in the game by yourself.  
---
It's not a comparison - it is an example to show your argument that Franchise &gt; Genre doesn't hold any water.
---
How do you know that your ass is clean off of one wipe? I guess if the TP is clean on the first wipe you'd know but if there's shit on the first wipe then unless you're doing a second wipe to confirm or using a bidet your asshole might very well still be dirty.
---
uh no it means their deadzone is even bigger
---
Pets won't get targeted by this. This was patched out relatively early, because players made a joke out of it and pocketed the pet while it had the bomb debuff. Took it out on the auction house and bombed 40 people into oblivion. Fun times.
---
I guess we all can’t have brains...
---
While you can still clear raids with sub-optimal raid rosters it's going to take you substantially longer than people that are min-maxing.
---
1.4% report at least 21 shits per week
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
What a terrible argument. Internet speed doesn't directly affect latency. My ping back in 2005 was pretty much the same it is now.
---
Whelp.  Time to roll a warrior I guess.  Ranged classes getting shit on.
---
I was hoping for a wider beta in the future so I could subscribe earlier to reserve names for my characteres and play a bit before Classic launches, but that won't be possible. I find it annoying how Blizzard is basically forcing non retail fans to waste half of a subcription just to reserve stupid names.
---
Hi, /u/shewieee
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8r3r4/when_will_we_be_able_to_download_wow_classic/). 
---
I'm playing a warrior. If I was being selfish I would just shut up and be happy about leeway. But you are correct about the first part.
---
Thinking that buying a 100% mount would give me the skill.....
---
Tbh I’m still not gonna know until I login and hit create character
---
Mages crying now because they might actually get touched by melee in pvp now
---
&gt;No really, with 16 debuffs slot what are you giving up to let your shadow priest actually do anything beyond mind blasting every 5.5 seconds?
---
Well seeing as almost every raid guild has been using a shadow priest on private servers with 16 debuff slots for the last few years now, i'd say it's just fine. 
---
&gt;You know on live servers spell pen can't get a mob's resistances below 0 and most mobs don't have spell resistances to begin with, do you?
---
Vanilla raid bosses have roughly 70 nature resistance (a few have different) which isn't reduced by any of the warlock curses; that is why spell penetration is a primary stat for Ele shamans. The tier 2.5 shaman set is almost universally better than all of that gear for that very reason. Exceptions can be made once you hit the spell pen threshold, and at that point you are free to start upgrading on a few select cloth items (namely head and belt). The Shoulders, legs and feet you listed are NOT better than tier 2.5 at any point.
---
I agree that NPCs are important. But I think our difference comes from where we think the majority of the attention should lie in an MMO.  
---
Most players agree, that the attention shifted to NPC characters and away from the PC adventurer.
---
I think someone did the math a few months ago and if a boomkin was in a group with 4 mages and applied the crit buff to them - I want to say the dps increase for those 4 mages + the balance Druids dps was still less than if you just brought another mage.
---
I might. I want to look into addon dev and that'd be much more convenient if I could run WoW on my work laptop.
---
I don’t think it will. I don’t think somebodies *ignorant* if they think it will be only two weeks, though.
---
Why? They're staying in Europe, the English want to leave, so fair enough then, push them off away with the Russians and away from EU servers. 
---
Will be different jurisdictions and abiding laws anyway, Blizzard will have to split players from England away from the rest of EU to abide by EU laws. 
---
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can stay as they'll be splitting from England anyway in the next couple of years. Just leave England off away on its own or with Russians, sure the English Brexit party is sponsored by the Russian state anyway. 
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
I talked and watched Zeroeds stream (twitch.tv/zeroedtv) and FD is still buggy. What Perp video are you talking about btw?
---
ya, if the story was good, blood elves would never have been on horde and just been a neutral faction. Too much bending of story for the game, takes out the immersion in a mmorpg when everything just wildly shifts to something for no reason.
---
I feel like you're on the optimistic side of what humans would define as 'people' in a fantasy setting tbh.
---
I don't think tauren-burgers would be an entirely unlikely outcome of that situation.
---
I'm not claiming anything and OP too. But if someone is claiming something, he should be the one bringing the proof.
---
So we have to select a realm first and then choose a name, right? Will they be posting the population caps initially? How do we decide which realm to choose without any statistics (i.e. alliance/horde ratio)?
---
The selfish reason doesn't have to be because you benefit from it, but just because you dislike it as a mechanic and get what you want by them removing it.
---
There's no nuance.  lol.   There's assholes that want to cheat, and people with integrity.
---
He's been whoring DKP the whole time.  Months and months of raiding with zero whispers to the officers.  That Shadowstrike is obviously a void walker weapon.
---
Warsong, black rock and Kargaths clan were all conquerors prior to the fel.
---
wait the beta is ending in a week?
---
The Blizzard spell normally has a % slow as well as aoe damage. Because of how spell batching functions in classic, if your movement speed is fast enough you can run through the entirety of the large aoe without being debuffed with the slow at all.
---
It makes some parts of the podcast painful to listen to. It happens almost every interview too, these people either aren’t vetted well enough, or can’t comprehend the instructions they’re given before the interviews. I wish it would just go back to josh and the interviewing, not random scrubs killing the flow of the interview.
---
Not cringey at all. Without the social element in MMO's, they are inferior games when compared to others in similar sub genres. RPG etc
---
You can't get the experience from 2004 without major changes.  The experience from 2004 didn't have the near universal exclusion of what have been dubbed "meme specs".  It didn't have the knowledge or skill of players in 2019.  My only hope for classic is that 1.12 is a "jumping off point", and that they will make changes down the line that capture the "feeling" of vanilla.
---
NO amount of toilet paper can clean up the shit that is retail
---
Well, they swear it was never there, because the delay and quality of internet connections back then was a different beast entirely. If you played with 20 fps and 400 ping, then you couldn't notice melee leeway as much compared to playing with your shitty connection in the first place. And if you play now with 120fps and 10 ping, you are used to airtight gameplay. But since it's consistent with back then, #nochanges all the way baby.
---
well if they get rooted they're not moving so leeway isn't a factor.
---
dont druids use leather gear?
---
(kinky but not my style)
---
Dude you don't get it do you? They are NOT changing it for the majority of players. The majority of players played with a &lt;100 ping back then, just like they do now. No matter how they handle it, one group of players (the ones that had lag or the ones that didn't in 2005) will have a change. And this way they give the majority (the ones that had decent ping) the authentic experience.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night. If you asked a group of 4 mages if they preferred another mage (who will roll against them on gear) OR a boomkin for extra crit, I think the mages would prefer the higher crit and higher chance at attaining gear.  Same goes for warriors and enhance  shaman.
---
How likely is your name going to be taken.... either way just use it and come back and play classic
---
I’m not with that dude, but I think it’s extremely likely it lasts over two weeks. The only hard stop they mentioned is phase two, and I expect layering to last much closer to 2 months than 2 weeks. 
---
Blizzard is underestimating Classic, imo. No RPPvP kind of spells that out; they don’t think there will be enough servers needed to justify creating one extra for each region. Meanwhile, I think the demand will be much higher than they expect. It’s not based on any statistic in particular, I’m not on their analytics team. But Blizzard has been off base with their predictions and their fan base before, this is just one of those times.
---
I’m just looking forward to the world being huge again, non max level chars having some relevancy and 40 man raids. 
---
Also not having multiple difficulties for every dungeon/raid... that really got out of hand. An easy and a hard mode makes some sense but having a brain dead, slightly less brain dead, ok maybe try a little and then a “true difficulty”  is insane.
---
Holy shit
---
I think you're highly over-estimating the difference in internet response time since 2006. 2006 wasn't some dark age when internet was still pubescent. We might not have had the same capacity, but response time haven't changed much since then.
---
Unless you played Vanilla with 200+ms the leeway in Classic will **feel** exactly the same Vanilla did. And if you did then there are many other things that will also **feel** very different with a lower latency.
---
Nicee lol
---
Horde have will of the forsaken. Undead is 25% or more of the horde population. Paladin is 10-12% of the alliance population.
---
Listen, it’s ironic you don’t like people calling meme specs in a derogatory way but also have no problem calling people idiots. 
---
If you’re going to take the high road - then stay on the high road lol. 
---
Yes there are people who will de facto reject meme specs. That’s fine it’s their prerogative . 
---
That being said - most people just want to point out that you may experience a significant hardship play subpar specs when trying to get raid spots. You have a higher chance of getting replaced, a lower gear priority (usually), you will have to work harder and there’s less room for mistakes etc. 
---
These are just things to consider. I agree with you that most people that want to raid, regardless of spec, will find a home.
---
Oh I'm sure they're still all about #nochanges, it just means no changes from the pservers they have experience with :)
---
Ya... Guess I'll be playing a druid if I play anything at all.
---
I wonder who needs who the most 🤔
---
Nobody will expect it.
---
It’s a stress test not a birthday party..
---
More people should stop telling other people what they are and aren't supposed to be doing in vanilla, yeah?
---
Can tell you didn’t listen to the interview.
---
Because now almost everyone has good ping.
---
And those who don't have good ping should already know they will have trouble in games.
---
Time's change. People have good connections, so lag compensation without lag doesn't make sense.
---
" its only Beta"
---
No mentioning of NPC's having leeway as well but I guess those poor NPCs will also have poor internet connections in 2019..
---
As always good job Blizzard with that stellar research gone into this!
---
I have no doubt people would prefer less competition for gear. 
---
That doesn't really change the point, though.
---
No kidding. I can hear the saliva-sucking noise in my head with the high pitch, broken speech of the class nerd going "ACK-SHULLY MISS PETERMAN, THE VALUES ARE INCOR-ECKT!".
---
**&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;** \- Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
 
---
**What’s it mean?:**
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
​ 
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?:**
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart:**
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such **we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!

**A Brief History:**
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Phase 1 we will have two (yes TWO) Molten Core groups. East and West coast.
---
East Coast: Sun/Mon 7:00 - 10:00 PM EST. (4:00 - 7:00 PST) West coast: Tues/Thurs 7:00 - 10:00 PM PST (10:00 - 1:00 EST)
---
Members may sign up for either that fits their schedule. Some more hardcore members should be able to raid both events with an alt/main.
---
**Guild Priorities:**
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).

Drop us a line and let’s talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we’re gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
Kill the adds on Mr. Smite first
---
Triggering my PTSD back when Blizz use to use Peer 2 Peer and my ISP throttled / blocked that type of traffic because they thought that sort of traffic only pirates used.
---
Because it wasn't intended and fucking breaks the fucking game?
---
&gt; Same thing.
---
Sharding and Layering aren't the same thing... I just explained why.
---
&gt; Yes it is. Layering is Shading with different parameters. It's literally the exact same idea with different limits on who or what you can or cannot interact with.
---
Layering is a completely different technology. It's as different from sharding as having separate servers is.
---
&gt; Layering. Which attempts to solve the same problems in a slightly different way
---
Layering is designed to solve server overpopulation, which can also be solved by sharding or by having more servers.
---
Layering doesn't solve issues regarding resource availability, cross realm zones, zone overpopulation, spawnrates, etc. It's not designed for those problems, and it doesn't solve them.
---
&gt; But it doesn't solve login queues.
---
It DOES solve login issues. They're able to spin up new layers according to demand instead of making you wait for a slot in the server. That's literally the entire point of layering.
---
&gt; Yet another reason why layering is a terrible solution.
---
Layering is a fine solution, no matter how much you complain about it. This community is toxic as fuck, and always has been. Almost EVERY SINGLE THING blizzard does attracts people who constantly whine about it on the forums.
---
If blizzard introduced sharding, people would lose their shit. If blizzard had no system in place people would lose their shit. Blizzard has decided on layering, and people are still losing their shit.
---
I think layering is perfectly fine as long as it doesn't continue into phase 2. No sharding please.
---
&gt; Layering itself does not effect server population.
---
First of all, I think you're talking about population as in "players per server" rather than "number of characters currently logged in on a server or in a zone".
---
Since sharding is off the table (thank goodness), the alternative is simply having more servers. Layering allows the server to support more people in the first few weeks so that the final population isn't too low. Layering also allows more concurrent logins, which effects the second kind of "population".
---
That (and login queues) is the point.
---
&gt; Lol, okay. "It doesn't matter what the actual people making the game say about the game they are making".
---
***“Just like Apple refers to the newest version of the Iphone as a whole new thing every time. Just because someone says something doesn't mean it's true. Let me give you an example:***
---
***"Giraffes are purple and from the moon"***
---
***See? I put that down in text, saved on this site. Someone said it. Is it accurate? No.”***
---
That was your response to quotes from one of the devs working on classic... in the same comment. ZERO self awareness.
---
Meanwhile what I said was that layering was an overall population control "no matter what". A hammer is a hammer even if you're trying to use it on a screw. Now, I don't think they're trying to do that. Blizzard understands the tool they've created and they're using it to solve specific issues. Realm pop (overall pop and concurrent pop) and login queues are what they're trying to solve, not starting zone population... which will be almost exactly as bad with layers as it would be without.
---
And it's now 2019.
---
Blizzard's reference client is the old wow client and server they have  from 2006...
---
food choices also matter. Is there an on-site cafeteria with healthy food options? If so, once a day shit is fair assumption. If there are no food options nearby except a chinese fast food and a mexican taqueria, then people are statistically more likely to have the runs, and therefore, your calculation of toilet paper usage would be too conservative.
---
I don't think this sub justifies layering. But to answer your question, this is exactly why people take the notorious super hard #nochanges stance, because even minor changes will lead to questions like yours: if they made these other changes then why not this? Not saying I agree with them but that's their legitimate argument
---
So I'm in between warrior tank and rogue. My number one pick would be warrior tank, but people say it's a very hard class to level and to get good at. My question is: hard how? If it's about mechanics and good rotation, plus time investment that I can do solo I'm fine with that. But is it 'hard' as in it requires large amounts of grinding gear and consumables? Are those solo-friendly? Most of my friends don't play anymore, so the only friends I'll have is the ones I find on the server, and I guess being a tank will help me make some friends. But I don't want my class to be extremely dependent on other players everytime I need to progress, nor boring to level alone.  
---
My endgame goal is mainly tanking dungeons and the easier raids. I hope I will find a guild to make that easier.  
---
As for the rogue: I'll probably won't play on a pvp server, so I want rogue strictly for pve DPS. I'm worried that there will be a huge amount of rogues though and I'll have strong competition to get into dungeons, raids, guilds and groups overall.
---
Was working in Beta... I have done it. I had issues switching between the totem and myself. I had to cast a new wind totem to start falling again. This could have been because of my add-ons though.
---
I don't have to listen to some fucking pirated server trash share his trash opinion.
---
Sigh. Why couldn't it have come out at the start of summer. :|
---
I'm stuck here playing shit games waiting for classic to drop, and right when it releases is busy season at work.
---
Finding the tram from ironforge to stormwind... I died too many times in the burning steppes
---
Wat? You just buy find people who want to sell token (gametime) for classic wow gold and then trade gold for your gametime, that's it. You don't need to be streamer wtf? I did that in OSRS and it's legal there.
---
does it make sense to anyone else that because he used a movement increase spell. this is a hard counter to the blizzard slow? Like using fear ward to stop fears kind of thing? increased movement speed is a counter to blizzard AOE debuff.
---
source?
---
Aha, ok, thanks. No idea how I missed that announcement.
---
I'm sorry but you really need to learn the definition of Ironic.  I will give you a hint, it's nothing like the Alanis Morissette song.
---
And no, they won't receive any hardship for being an undead rogue over a orc rogue etc etc.  It's literally a fictitious battle being made up by elitists. 
---
They will not receive any hardship over being a Boomkin either, as the raid wants the buff and will want DPS, which in likeliness will be picked up inside the guild if short 40 members prior than picking up externally just because he is a Boomkin and they want a pug fury war instead.  What a player will see as a druid though is a greater need of healer druids, that he may or may not want to do simply based out of necessity for healers, not because "it's the only thing they are good at" mentalities
---
It's elitist bullshit, it means nothing to the actual game and is fictitious nonsense.  All of these squeaky wheel people on Reddit regurgitating what they have been told about min/max are literally just retards incapable of logical comprehension.  Suck it up buttercup, it's true.
---
Oh and as a side note, coming from someone in wow who has participated in multiple world first kills and top 20 guild experience... We never once turned down a skilled player over his class/build/race or combo there in unless we just had an over abundance of that ONE build, at which point it would be unfair to them and our members by adding more pool.  So I can tell you right now, these elitists do not know shit.  
---
Play the game you want to play.
---
Well you say that, but there's definitely a history of those units being used incorrectly.
---
You must phrase it as “I recall it being this way in 2006”.
---
Glad I've spent the past 8+ months preparing to play Hunter at a high level to have to switch classes less than 2 months out. PvP is one of the things I enjoy the most in Classic and this will be miserable... Add the DR issue with F/D Trap and Scatter and Hunters are even more of a joke to the community than they we're before....
---
They have a version running on an old server with the old client, everything the way it was. THAT is the reference client.
---
All of this batching and leeway garbage will piss people off in 2019, authentic or not. We don't have 2004 internet and enjoy lower pings, more bandwidth and greater accuracy for a reason.
---
Quite honestly this will hurt the game far more than layering will since this garbage is permanent unless Blizz changes it.
---
When enough folks get tired of getting caught up in some unlucky batch placement the glitter that is Classic will begin to lose its sparkle. I'd rather have a more accurate play than get lucky in a batch - and before anyone responds that using batching requires skill or you can "feel it", it's not a batch between player and target, it's server side you can't control, can't predict and there's no exposed API to view it. If it was based on player to target it would be so easy to exploit every move being made - which is why it isn't and it's server side.
---
How come a Holy Priest? Just out of interest
---
Finally someone with logic.
---
What happens when people on this sub has their server merged with a big streamer's server, or has their name changed because it's a duplicate. Y'all would lose your fucking minds. Layering is just the flavor of the month to complain about.
---
?????????????????
---
How can original vanilla server and client have non vanilla features?
---
Awesome! I'm stoked for my EU brothers, happy your voices were heard!
---
dont tell anyone but im just going to level a second account and sell it for 200
---
that should cover the sub for a while
---
mostly joking but yea both are just RMT
---
you are trading classic stuff for things outside the game
---
its going to happen , it happened in vanilla too. its really no different from chinese people trading classic gold for USD
---
the other thing is i expect retail wow tokens to double in price over the next 6 months ,
---
You can still hamstring kite.  The slow from hamstring will let you get out of melee range
---
I never thought about it like that. That makes perfect sense.
---
Lmao okay
---
the point is that even if you say "its not allowed to trade gold between classic and retail", people will still use trading in classic to get free things that you don't get, and that's unfair to you.
---
How does this affect hunter range? We can shoot at 8 yards and melee at 5 + 2.66 if moving?
---
Based on the other comments here, I think you're right.
---
What other class do you think wears dresses that night elves can be, like let's use some critical thinking?
---
Trying to decide between holy pala and priest  
---
Pros for pala:  
---
\- class fantassy  
---
\-very strong both pve and pvp (some say best)  
---
\-free mount and 40  
---
Cons for pala:  
---
\-very boring lvling experiance  
---
\-doesnt wear the cool plate gear at 60 to be good  
---
\-one dimensional healing(might be a pro)
---
Pros for priest:  
---
\-also very strong  
---
\-a lot of utility and cool spells you can have fun with
---
\-if decide to dps shadows looks more appealing than ret
---
Cons for priest:  
---
\-have to be a dwarf (dwarves are cool but its too op and kinda forces you to be one)  
---
\-might be complex for a newer player (this might be a pro cuz it makes it more interesting)  
---
\-harder to get gear (not sure about this one)  
---
\-mana problems?? not sure aswell
---
I plan to roll a paladin a be the white knight of trade chat
---
I play every expansion since mop for a few months then quit. I played bfa for 3 months and quit. I enjoyed uldir and progressing with a group, but then it got super Boring having to run mythic+ and doing the daily’s I just got bored and quit again, haven’t resubbed in 8 months.
---
#nochangesexceptsomechangesbutjustthechangesthat*I*want
---
Djesnt quite have the same ring to it.
---
The Warsong and Blackrock sated their lust for battle with the ogres and gron. Kargath's Shattered Hand Clan were slaves that were forced to fight. It's not like they had any other choice. There were lots of other clans and the majority were spiritual. 
---
The point is, they had never sought to conquer Draenor before the deception and demon blood. They lived and *traded* with the Draenei for many generations.
---
I think maybe you're a bit too invested in this if you're still openly jealous about not getting in lol.
---
you will be at the origin of statistics, that's how a launch works :/
---
its bfa client
---
I agree that having the extra buff would be more beneficial but I'd also add that the boomkin would be rolling on mage gear as well :P
---
Sorry for the delayed response. I work weekends and was busy yesterday.
---
&gt; there's a sense of cruelty to the Belfs that make them more like the kinda monsters you don't expect, kinda monstrous on the inside.
---
Which is precisely why they don't belong in the Horde. Thematically, the whole *point* of the New Horde is it's populated by people who *look like* monsters but *aren't.*
---
The Alliance, on the other hand, is all about presenting a facade of honor and order built upon a strong foundation - until you look closer and see the duplicity and corruption eating away at it from within.
---
&gt; Their mana dependency, twisting of the light and horribly self centered tactics all in the name of survival made them feel perfect in the Horde.
---
In the Old Horde, maybe. Thrall's Horde was formed specifically to get away from all that and try to find some measure of redemption.
---
To be fair, the blood elves could have been a fantastic fit for the Horde if they'd also been seeking redemption. Instead they were a bunch of wholly unapologetic sociopaths who reveled in their depravity and cared only about getting their next fix - and specifically *didn't* care who they had to lie to, steal from, harm or kill to get it.
---
Hell, even that *might* have worked out to some degree if they'd actually been forced to face the music for what they'd done. Instead the being they'd enslaved and been leeching power from all throughout TBC simply clinked its bullshit magical wind chime parts together and poofed everything better.
---
Everything about the blood elves in WoW was crap. Their actions, their motivations, their principles; all of it. And they *don't belong* in the Horde.
---
Could it have been a macro I was using? One that would go to the next totem if the previous one met a check in the macro? Sorry, I'm lliterate when it comes to writing macros, so I hope I explained that well enough.
---
For the 35 alt: hunter might be a little faster to level, but I'd go with druid for the portal to Moonglade and easy/fast access to a moonwell.
---
Yeah let's just sweep under a rug the biggest gameplay mechanic that will affect literally every single pvp fight
---
Anyone who says melee was easy in vanilla didn't play melee. I lost count how many times I'd be 1 foot behind a caster as a rogue and couldn't sinister strike because "i need to get closer"
---
BY THE LIGHT OF THE ELUNE
---
Well, I'm not playing WoW anymore, partially because of that. This was never an issue I sensed back in the day. The closest is the instances/raids, but even then, all the people doing those with you are at your side - at least when you do it the first time, for quests.
---
warlock is the closest gameplay, distance with a pet without the auto/spell range, same tanking potential and aoe
---
Likely depends on the tree. I am pulling mobs in Western Plaguelands using the trees to block their line of sight. Originally, it was a square in the diagram but a tree was more pleasing on the eyes.
---
&gt;After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.
---
&gt;There are more people with low latency now than there were in 2006, so we expect for some it might feel different, but it is working as expected.
---
So if you have good internet it will be worse for you. Thanks, technology.
---
There really is a shocking lack of perspective and empathy coming from large swaths of this community who seem to define their very existence by this game's success.
---
A slightly altered version of Mapster worked for me.
---
You dont celebrate your birthday by waiting in long queues and getting frequently dced? Live a little, man!
---
Could just be cheap chinese server
---
They would have launched without local servers? What a great idea! But that's no surprise coming from the company that asks "Don't you have phones?"
---
Aussie insomniac here, great news!
---
I distinctly remember downloading wow with 70-300kb/s Internet and leaving it on all night and checking on it.
---
Can you link to this discord please?  I'm VERY interested in setting up a controll for Classic as I usually play at night and it'd be great to be able to relax on the couch and grind mobs or whatever.
---
I'm skeptical that that is true. I believe someone with a low ping playing on a 2019 computer connecting to these current servers would experience this exact thing, but I think it's more than simply the ping. I lived in Southern California in when I was playing Vanilla and TBC and played on the Pacific time zone servers. I regularly had very low ping and this looks weird to me. And prior to a month or two ago, I had never even seen private server footage.
---
Fantastic news! I now only need RP PvP EU server and it's all good.
---
Hopefully they will listen to us the same way the listened to the language server feedback.
---
But this time it's global. :)
---
2 months and layering still in the game LUL
---
Oh yes, I remember that day when I was sleeping at a friends home and we saw the South Park WoW episode that night. The next day we immediately tried to play it by creating a trial account. Back then there were those "7 days trial" flyers within the retail CD packages, but we hadn't one and nevertheless tried to create an account. We didn't get it to work (don't remember if it was even possible without that trial invitation code from a flyer). That adventure of trying to get it to work was bigger than all adventures I had since Cataclysm. 
---
And I remember that when I was installing it later on after buying WoW, it failed a few times when it was at 99%. And it took 2-3 hours installing WoW with it's 5 CDs.
---
"Do you want it done fast or do you want it done right?"
---
Again, I would recommend you read the entire chain, because I have literally not argued that at all and I'm not interested in arguing that. Parent comment - "It's not toxic if you are telling the truth" is a nonsense simplification as toxicity has nothing to do with content and all to do with the context, word choice, tone, etc. Telling someone that some specs are not up to par is obviously not inherently toxic, but that doesn't prevent it from being either. That's all I've said, so not sure what you want me to do.
---
 \&gt; Its not toxic if you are telling the truth. 
---
\&gt;  (or more toxic versions of both arguments). 
---
\&gt; So now anything that can be offensive is toxic?
---
Most druids are heals endgame and Stat wise you end up wearing cloth, drops more often, with the stats you want.
---
the info will get out there via reddit some how, not sure how a discord becomes the "official" discord but if you google it there has been official discords for each class for some time now and in Legion they were definitely the best place to go for the most current info about your specs.
---
So, realistically will this have any *actual* major impact on classes (hunter in particular, as I'm considering it) or are people just making a fuss for the sake of it like normal?  I saw the demo video and understand the situation but am not an active player so don't fully grasp the *implications* of it. 
---
Does this make it better or worse to be tauren/horde for pvp (either having the bigger hit box/leeway range as horde or somehow taking advantage of the bigger hitbox/leeway range if alliance)?
---
We are not going to truly know server populations until ~1 month after launch. Sure, initially on launch day we will have a general idea if servers are more full/empty but lots of players are going to be tourists that leave soon after starting. So I don't think your question can be truly answered right now. I'd imagine that they will show "server pops" as low, mid, high based on reserved names but that is highly subject to change...
---
A lot of the classic dungeons have been shortened/combined.
---
Of course they can't make a server for every language but thoses two major region are the most important
---
(on retail) German is 24% of EU server population, Russian is 13%, French is 10.5%, Spanish is only 4% and italian and other small regions are 1% and less
---
German + French was over a third of EU's population(including russia) so it would have been so much more impactful than spanish and italian servers
---
LOL that gouge is from a million miles away. Guess the melee leeway really was a thing!
---
*How* is it unfair to you that people value the entertainment they provide enough that they're willing to give them, essentially, gifts? Is it unfair IRL when somebody gives somebody else a gift behind your back without consulting you about it?
---
Which is good.
---
Giving paladins taunt would be an improvement, but would also change the game. Once you make a single change, what's stopping you from making another ?
---
That said I 100% want changes. We're playing the game in 2019, it won't be the same regardless.
---
I mean, some of those major moments/arc where you're the champion are just quests I did to finish Legion zones, for instance. In that case, everyone is the champion. 
---
I think it's an issue of the scale of the task, mostly. But when you're at the point that you're the only one who can save a zone or lead the push to go burn down NE town, and it's such a low-bar quest that everyone else is doing it, it gets ridiculous. At least the boar asses are a deplete-able *ass*et, and the task is small scale enough that seeing a few toons doing it at once doesn't make you wonder how y'all could all be needed here. But again, this is my take. I've seen plenty of people that aren't bothered by it.
---
why?
---
Rogue melee range is 5 yards, leeway turns that into 7.6 ... Tauren warriors could hit you from 9.6 yards max.
---
"Lag" is not that different compared to back than. Internet speeds got a lot faster, but ping isn't all that different. Sure, pings got better and connections more stable, but there were tons of people with good pings back then and there's tons of people with bad pings nowadays. Changing this would artificially change the experience of a lot of players too. There's no reason to do so.
---
I like the idea of focusing on the people I'm playing with and being responsible for their lives. relationships are more important to me than the game and I feel as though being a healer gives people a reason initally to link up
---
Plot Twist: Tank is a bear and casts Faerie Fire. :O
---
They do.  I had one as a hunter.  It doesn't tell you the exact distance, but it showed me if I was in range, in dead zone, or in melee range.
---
Anyway you can send me a link? Is the map smaller and not in full screen? I tried using a Mapster version that didn’t work.
---
&gt; have been using a shadow priest on private servers with 16 debuff slots for the last few years now
---
And the link you provided earlier show shadow priests doing absolutely abysman dps, so yes we can carry them, but don't pretend they are contributing.
---
&gt; That's just plain wrong. Vanilla raid bosses have roughly 70 nature resistance (a few have different) which isn't reduced by any of the warlock curses; that is why spell penetration is a primary stat for Ele shamans.
---
Let's assume you're right.
---
You can get: 25 from KT staff/Anub off hand, 13 from Faerlina neck, 10 from Razuvious back, 20 from Skeram's ring, 10 from t2.5 feet (the ONLY t2.5 piece with spell pen) and that's brings you to 78. 8 over the cap, 33 over the cap if you have a tank with TF, which let's face it you're going to have if you are in AQ40/Naxx. On top of that you can get 20 from Sartura's chest. All those pieces, except t2.5 feet are cloth.
---
&gt; The Shoulders, legs and feet you listed are NOT better than tier 2.5 at any point due to spell penetration being so crucial and needing the 3 piece set bonus.
---
Given that only the feet have spell penetration I'd say it's about what you can scrounge around.
---
&gt; Please don't try to teach me how to play when you haven't played Vanilla in 13 years.
---
I wouldn't if you didn't need it so so badly.
---
&gt; Edit: Here is a BIS gear spreadsheet that proves that the tier 2.5 shoulders, legs and feet are BIS throughout vanilla
---
Even your own spreadshit shows ele shaman in 5/8 cloth gear.
---
Even that is not uncontested gear. Do you really think the other druids in your raid have no desire to play feral or balance in pvp? No, of course they want to play their off spec. They are just actually willing to spec in such a way that benefits your raid the most. On the other hand, you refuse to heal and expect to steal all the off spec pvp gear cause "its my main spec".

---
lol so we're basically picking randomly. They better offer realm transfers if I end up on a low pop 90:10 alliance to horde ratio.
---
Then you don’t have to pay it....
---
I agree.  I almost think the game would be better without the damage meter add-ons. People micro on it so hard (myself included), and it doesn't give any credit to the hunters tranq shotting or providing trueshot to the melee group.
---
Dude calm tf down. We know
---
I would say "begging" would be what's happening right now with layering. Spell batching was nowhere near layering levels of sperging.
---
Gotcha, thanks for clarifying. I can see that. I'm drawn to tanking 5-mans as I level, and I just feel more like a warrior. I'll keep meditating on it.
---
This reminds me of an interaction between some NPCs in the mmo RIFT. Basically it goes:
---
Bahmi (big beefy race) Rogue NPC: Some guy was telling me how bahmi are too big to be stealthy rogues.
---
NPC #2: Yeah? What'd you do?
---
Bahmi Rogue: I stabbed him.

Thinking it would be a benefit for the game overall doesn't fit the definition of selfish. That's why I separated the two in the original comment. That's where the line is drawn.

Example: Bob hates leeway. He is a warrior and benefits from it. But he feels like it's cheap. He doesn't really care about the state of the game, he just wants to outskill opponents with his superior positioning, movement, and prediction. He only wants to benefit from it competitively on a personal level. This is a selfish reason, because he only wants it to be changed for him to make him feel better.
---
Example: Jack plays a Mage. He hates the leeway mechanic because it gets him killed too much. He wants it removed, so he can stop dying in what he considered bullshit situations. He doesn't care about the state of the game or the well-being of others. He just wants to stop dying to a game mechanic.
---
Wanting the game to improve as a whole, or for the benefit of others (generally not in your own group) is not selfish. Even if it's a personal opinion unproven, the intent is different.
---
I believe you're right, it did use abilities.  It had you select certain abilities to base it's judgement off of when you first install it, per character.  I see no reason why it wouldn't work for melee classes.  For hunters it had 4 states, Melee, Dead Zone, In Range, Out of Range.  I doubt this would have any tolerance for leeway though.  If people are trying to find the tolerance level... that might be more difficult.
---
6-7 months of free game time for ~10 min of grinding at lvl 60?
---
I think a lot of people will do it, especially in countries that earn less money and I think teens are also more likely to want to pay with their playtime by grinding.
---
Aussie Bros, I wanted your personalities on my server but I was just being selfish. Grats
---
this would make Warlock the best DPS class by a good margin
---
It was part of the "feel" of vanilla. OSRS doesn't change tick rates pe animation speeds just because we're not on dial up
---
Shaman don't really have the durability for tanking in my experience, but maybe you could make something like that work in low level dungeons.  Mainly the roles available for Shamans will be dps as a caster, dps as melee, or healer.  If you want to be a good tank, you really need to be a Warrior or Druid.
---
Hi pretty sure it pushes out the deadzone too, I'm dad.
---
You do not *have* to be a dwarf unless you're looking for some absolute min/max guild.  Being a dwarf might make it slightly easier to join a good guild, but if you're a good player that's WAY more important than fear ward.
---
This is a change imo. Maybe not in the code, but certainly in the experience.
---
They can manage the rest with an in house beta, no need to keep letting the world to see. Hype will build back up now that streamers won’t be showing it 24/7
---
If the classic gold has a bfa gold value and the bfa gold has a game time value then the classic gold has a game time value. Its a roundabout way of saying I'll trade you 10g for another 3 months of game time. That's something classic players will inevitably value at some level.
---
Go play live then if you don't want batching. You'll never feel it except for the odd moment in pvp.
---
I leveled a priest to 45 without wand spec and spirit tap. Thought min maxing it was blackout proccing so I could get more MB in. Had to borrow like 60g for the mount. Prob spent more time drinking for mana than actual combat.
---
IMO this is a change to the user experience
---
What do you want?
---
Don't know what twitch chat emote is but I can get *behind* the rest
---
Tried to do that my wife and burned off my mustache from the friction
---
Raids will be too easy with more than 10 fps I think blizzard should limit raid fps to 5 like it was back in vanilla #nochanges.
---
That mechanic is already in the game and was in vanilla. You're arguing that it should be removed because "fuck the people with shitty connections". I could understand a discussion for a new game if it's worth it to introduce it in the first place. But changing a mechanic that tries to help people with bad connections just because you believe it's not worth to help them is entitled.
---
You also have no clue about the current average ping and how many people are affected, so where do you pull that "superminority" from?
---
That's a lot of wiping
---
No...
---
if it did show up you would still not get to play a crit chicken.  the damage buff is not big enough to bring one to raid.  your raid dps would be higher with another mage or warlock
---
Back 14 years ago i leveled a hunter from level 13 to 33 without a pet. I thought they were stupid. just dying in 2 hits, eating all my food and running away all the time.
---
Thinking all that i bashed my head against level 18-20 Giraffes and Stormkodos just outside of Camp Taurajo as a level 12 tauren hunter.
---
That's why I said trinket the first and skull the other two.
---
The only piece that's hard to get is the chest cause you compete with both warriors and rogues. The other 4 are pretty easy to get, we were giving them out to paladins after a month.
---
You're looking at shadow priest dps in a vacuum man... You know they increase every warlocks damage output by 15% right? Once you have 3 (or more) warlocks, bringing a shadow priest puts out more effective DPS than bringing along a mage would. Again, the math has already been done on that. 
---
How can you say someone else needs help when you are under the impression that most of the classes in the game aren't brought to raids when they are? 
---
Elemental Shaman BIS is fluid and based off a lot of compounding factors. You aren't going to be getting priority on any of those cloth items until the mages and warlocks have had their way with them. That is why I said that the best option is to stick with mail as it isn't that much worse. 3/5 pieces of tier 2.5 are bis for all of vanilla, along with the ring, which you can technically count as tier 2.5. This is because of the spell pen and the fact that they are the most efficient items to achieve the 3 set bonus with. That being said, I agree that a lot of it is based off what is available. For the majority of naxxramas, the effective BiS majority is mail, unless you are in a guild that lets you compete with mages &amp; warlocks on their BiS items.
---
I don't think it's gatekeeping behavior, simply mistrust in Blizz which imo is incredibly warranted. I agree with you that classic is better but not perfect, and I agree with them in that I don't really have faith in Blizzard's attempts at improving it.
---
Not remove it but it should be toned down a bit.
---
I'm looking forward to a sense of community. I hope I find it.
---
Just plan for one of your pet slots to be taken up by a Wolf for [Furious Howl](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#furioushowl).
---
It will buff the rest of your group and if you macro the pet skill to shot macros you'll spam it with every skill you use so even if you can't use your pet to dps the boss it'll still buff your groups dps.
---
Joined them through Reddit some months ago. Really like the atmosphere, bunch of laid back mature WoW veterans. Glad I joined!
---
If he used skull during the second sheep and 10 seconds have passed before I sheep him a third time that shouldn’t be possible
---
I was set on horde for a while since that's what I have played in tbc, wotlk and 2 private classic servers. Only played Alliance in retail classic. 
---
 When you have played a faction a lot you know all the quests and locations so you level faster and it's a smoother experience. However why should I just repeat everything I have already done? Because of that reason I decided to go Alliance this time. Will level a bit slower and it's going to be a bit confusing but it's not a big deal.
---
Yeah dude for real. The mod that dinged me had only been a mod for like 12 hours at that point too, so it's just an obvious power trip. Reported them and hopefully they get a talking to because that is just absolute insanity to me.
---
If you’re a ranged Tauren, it hurts you. If you’re a melee Tauren, it helps you.

#nochanges (except when I say so).
---
Lol this guy
---
And the wallpaper.... [vortex.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yZNSeED.png)
---
In some ways you’re right in others I think you underestimate classic it’s keeping vanillas numbers which means leveling slooower and harvesting slower which will force some of that community back together. People will need to work together even for low level shit. Like a hunter doing a hunter quest or someone trying to find mankirk’s wife without the quest helper(or the joys of giving someone bad directions to said wife).
---
When did they say they’d remove laying during beta? LUL
---
Skull or restorative potion.
---
5 fps in raids also was part of the vanilla "feel" by #nochanges logic blizzard should implement that
---
#nochanges is core gameplay related not hardware related. We've asked Blizzard to look into leeway and it seems correct, what else to do about it?
---
forgot you can buy game time with BFA gold...
---
Alright yeah that’s def fair.
---
Yeah, and I'm skeptical that it's true. I believe Blizzard looked at things and tested things, but it isn't uncommon at all to forget to control for a variable or two or make a conclusion that is affected by your assumptions.
---
But whether or not that is true, this exchange began with you asking how they could possibly tune it correctly for 2019 internet connections when they obviously did testing etc to tune it for 2005 internet connections. If they had certain parameters they were aiming for back then and adjusted based on average latency speeds at the time, then they could have those same parameters but just adjust the speed variables.
---
This reminds me of the time I had an old computer game, it might have been Baldur's Gate, and installed it on a newer computer. The way the game was programmed apparently had movement speed dependent upon the computer hardware. My newer computer processed things so much faster that my character basically teleported around. It was unplayable because I couldn't react to anything while I was en route to my location because the movement speed was too fast. A similar sort of experience on my first Windows computer with solitaire and my second. The first, when you won, the cards slowly bounced down. The whole thing took a couple minutes. The second computer it was over in about 2 seconds. It did all the same things, it just didn't take into account the changes in hardware.
---
There are no Chinese private servers.

Not needed most of the time when content is on farm status, but if you are doing something new or something goes wrong, more meritorious players the better.   Ex. People who have neglected their bodies can still function in today's automated society, but when when things go wrong, they are less able to contribute.   Their plan is for 'others' to carry them.

Not only does it look awesome but it's also has perfect stat allocation for ret.

Played Vanilla through TBC, all the cons you listed IRT douchebaggery already existed. You may not have noticed but it was there.

The biggest change to friendliness was the world grew by a lot. You didn't see as many people because there were more places to be.

Came just to see the average amount of toilet paper that others use to wipe their ass.

Unoptimal spec/class = ok.

Not focused or a downer when everyone else is having a good time = not ok.

Thats how i see it :)
---
I'm 100% on board with all kinds of changes. I'd like a pure vanilla experience until we all get to the end of Naxx and have nothing else to do - then I want updates. I don't want TBC, I just want updates.
---
Blizz really like money. But on a brighter side, if people mass resub only for this name reservation, Blizz will have no other choice to acknowledge that maybe classic can be future proof with a wow 2 or tbc:classic

Confirmed.
---
Agreed.
---
I feel as though anytime the visual signals from a game don't match up with the mechanics, there's a problem. Systems like leeway and batching were intended to reduce the gap between visual queues and game calculation. Today, with the benefit of faster PCs and connections on the client side and faster/better optimized servers, these mechanics (as currently tunes) create a fundamentally different experience than they did in classic and widen the gap between visual queues and game mechanics.
---
There's tons of other items that take you of sheep. There's even a skull type item that has no duration.
---
Good, no changes
---
The question that remains unanswered: **Should slows that force a walking animation from the player satisfy the check for `IsWalking` that disables extra leeway range?**
---
Make Azeroth Great Again!

Hunters are basically unplayable as it stands.

As /u [Zeroreq](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeroreq/) posted below, two people can do this transaction, but again this is outside of Blizzard wants (a as close to a vanila experience as possible).  
---
In vanilla, you had gold farmers and if you got caught, you got banned. Maybe Blizz won't be as strict thi time around, but hopefully they will be.
---
rolling a night elf rogue if you plan to play at level 60 is stupid.  that is a fact.
---
i am playing a female orc warlock in classic.  stun resist racial is OP
---
Simple but useful. I really wish I had a board on my wall to pin stuff like this
---
I pulled those changes from testing done on the Classic Beta as well as observations from mainly TBC videos.
---
Seeing as blizzard did extensive testing and have now confirmed leeway is working as intended, what I typed above is the current implementation.
---
the agony
---
nope, everything BUT attack speed was normalized (at least i think so, the patch notes said they only normalized movement speed, but from beta supposedly the various rares have lost their unique factor)
---
essentially now there is even more reason to basically only use broken tooth (or the bats in ZG with the same attack speed when ZG releases)
---
Blizz probably feels comfortable with their in-house testing for 40-60
---
I mean according to people here there’s a dozen ways to break sheep, and I didn’t know about most of them
---
Are you purposely saying silly things to wind me up? Or are you just that blind to a point being made outside of your comprehension?
---
If we know the range for each race it is possible, i think.
---
Ex : Orc leeway range is 10yard, just get a spell/item with the same range then the addons will be able to know when you are in leeway range or not and can alert you.
---
This is kind of amazing. It reads kind of like a joke due to the sheer length and brevity of it. Good job, I think.
---
If you’re taking your time and you like it that’s awesome and works well. Hopefully not too frustrating and hope it goes well for you. I found that tanking for retards is worse than healing for retards. But maybe you’re more patient.
---
Do you even realize what a strawmen is? Because all I posted were arguments so far and all you said is "people with shitty connections are OOL because they might be a minority".
---
Yawn. This conversation is going back and forth with no end. You're as stubborn as a mule. It's pointless carrying on with this. All i'll say is that you'll come around once Classic has played out and you're faced with the facts. I guaran-fucking-tee you that one Shadow Priest will be the norm for almost every raid guild. Same goes for a Feral Druid. You haven't even played on Private servers, so you don't know the meta. You're still in the Vanilla boomer mindset of all hybrids = trash. Your memory is biased and dusty after 13 years of not playing Vanilla. Also, "effective bis" isn't the same as "bis". Read what I said.
---
but will you be better than the other hunters fighting for your raid spot?
---
Wow, what a detestable human being
---
I think it will have a strong player base. I mean people still play really bad MMOs because they are looking for a more old school feeling. My entire group of friends is excited to play classic and we all dumped retail awhile ago. Not to mention old guildies I haven't talked to in 6+ years hitting me up.
---
I don't think its going to surpass retail or anything but I could easily see it attracting 1 Million players which would put it at number 4 for top mmos. On launch it will probably be the 2nd most played MMO behind retail WoW.
---
Hey man, shoot me a pm if you want.  We have a guild going that's going to be semi-hardcore and a lot of us are close friends just looking to have a good time.  All of us have been playing on and off since 2005.  Could always use a pocket healer and wouldn't mind showing you the ropes!
---
I was going to refer to it now and then. This part of the video illustrated the point about showing up to a zone being frustrating sometimes. I haven't followed it or even watched the whole thing, so I can't vet it.
---
Gm Island, I think, is northwest of teldrassil, it used to be separated by a lot of fatigue water, but I guess people figured out how to get there so a physical separation was added. In the 1.12 client the oceans end before you reach it so you have to teleport.
---
warrior continues to be the pvp gods they deserve to be
---
They tought there wouldn't even be enough french and german for one server so... They heavily underestimate how many people will play classic
---
If you listen to the interview, you'll hear one of the devs (Keving Jordan) say they were aware of it, but didn't fix it as they didn't view it as an exploit.
---
Honestly if you roll on a PvP server just go Arms in my opinion.  
---
/sit macro doesn't work in Classic, which is why so many people preferred leveling as fury in private servers, and possibly also why Kargoz went with 2H fury in his guide - which most of you are referencing.
---
If you plan to do any PvP while levleing (which is probably unavoidable), go with Arms.

---
I honestly don't understand the appeal of bringing back spell batching.
---
5-8 is the number of yards you need to stay away from a warrior to a) avoid their melee range and b) avoid their intercept range. Basically, an old strat rogues would use on warriors would be to engage, dump all your attacks on the warrior, then back off to 5-8 and wait for your energy to recoop, before diving in and dropping your attacks on him again.
---
I haven't seen this addressed in this subreddit. Maybe I should've searched before submitting this post. Nevertheless I still feel it's relevant to submit my own and honest opinion here, where all people care about this game. This is certainly not karma farming. It's a something really dear to my heart. We're all on the same page. I don't  know what you're upset about.

Death mechanics were the same runescape and runescape 2.
---
Blizz should fix this &amp; leeway. I know they’re saying this is how it was, and we don’t want to change the game. But you can’t stick to that argument when you’re adding layering / sharding to the game. You can’t cherry pick what changes to add and claim authenticity.
---
Even thinking about that makes me anxious!
---
&gt; And I explained why they are. Or at least, different versions of the same thing.
---
The fact that Blizz has come out and said it's a completely different technology supersedes your opinion.
---
&gt; That might be what people are saying now in an attempt to defend it, but that was never it's initial intention.
---
That is self-evidently the intention of the layering technology.
---
&gt; Right, which is why it's a bad solution.
---
It's a fine solution. Calm down.
---
&gt; Again, no it's not. 
---
And again, you're wrong.
---
&gt; Then why were there queues during beta with layering active?
---
Ask blizzard. However, queues aren't mutually exclusive with layering for pretty obvious reasons. One can layer enough to eliminate queues or simply reduce them. It's up to the devs.
---
I don't think there were queues during the stress test though.
---
&gt; Right, so you are just here to defend it, even when shown why it's not a good solution, and even listing all the issues it doesn't solve yourself. Like I said, "That might be what people are saying now in an attempt to defend it, but that was never it's initial intention."
---
I'm not here just to defend layering. I happen to think it's a good idea, and with all the people losing their shit over it, I feel the need to make that clear.
---
&gt; even when shown why it's not a good solution
---
Nobody has shown that it isn't a good solution yet.
---
&gt; even listing all the issues it doesn't solve yourself.
---
It doesn't have to solve every issue. It's not designed to.
---
&gt; No one is losing their shit.
---
People are absolutely spamming the classic forums with hate for layering and it gets brought up every single day in this forum as well.
---
&gt; It's just a bad decision that isn't going to help with anything they say it's supposed to help with while introducing several other issues that don't exist without layering.
---
It's going to solve the issues it's intended to solve... specifically issues caused by the server population spike during the first few weeks of release. Login queues and overpopulation followed by underpopulation as players migrate back to retail. All three of those issues are basically solved and server load is greatly reduced depending on the size of these layers and the size of an unlayered server. It also fits their cloud server model better... which is actually something they haven't mentioned AFAIK.
---
&gt; Being able to distinguish actual developmental progress from empty fluff is something you should learn.
---
I'm a software developer and electrical engineer. I understand how development works. YOU are the person who needs to learn this.
---
You also need to have a little self awareness. At least review your posts before you click submit.
---
&gt; Are we getting layering? Yes. Is it "a whole new technology"? No.
---
Sorry, but when the devs themselves call it "a whole new technology", I'm going to side with them. Given the kinds of cloud services they've moved to, they very well may have had to invent this whole thing from scratch. Just because it looks vaguely similar to something else they do doesn't mean it's directly related.
---
This isn't just "sharding with different parameters. It's a new tech they created for classic.
---
&gt; And you still haven't clarified what you mean by this.
---
Your inability to read isn't my problem. Go back and try again.
---
&gt; Except they never stated that this was the goal of layering,
---
I quoted them as saying that.
---
&gt; and layering doesn't solve the queues for sure
---
I quoted them as having said that it solves this as well.
---
If a layer fills up, instead of having a queue they can simply spin up a new layer. This isn't a challenging concept, why exactly don't you get it?
---
They can even wait to spin up a new layer until the queue reaches a certain size, creating a compromise between layering and queues. I actually mentioned this several comments ago.
---
&gt; will be a hit-or-miss 'solution' for final server populations ...
---
I actually agree with this somewhat. While layering is going to be a major help with this situation, I don't think the final result will be perfect. There's barely any precedent for what they're doing (oldschool runescape comes closest), so they're busy trying to guess how many players will just be "tourists", how many will be part-timers, and how many will actually stay with Classic.
---
Sharding is off the table for pretty obvious reasons, nobody likes queues, and they don't want to merge and split servers, so layering is the best alternative.
---
&gt; and they did say this was the point from day with, with sharding and layering.
---
They said it was the point of sharding. Not layering.
---
Layering doesn't help with starting zone populations. You even think it would make it worse.

Hey now. You can totally skin Worgen in WoW Classic.

Eastern time zone player here, my group I'll be playing with is primarily working adults who will probably be playing around the same time frames you're looking at.  Weekend afternoon raiding, most likely.  Definitely playing Horde, on a PvP server as well.
---
I *am* planning on taking launch week off and no lifing the game, but I'll definitely be playing an alt or two somewhere down the line, if you're interested in playing with a group that's been playing the game super hard to super casually and everything in between for 15 years now.
---
PM me if you want my battletag.

Silverpine Forest.  And I mean...its entire existence.
---
I somehow didn’t see the path south by Undercity and I had a class quest sending me to Hillsbrad.  I hopped in the water off the north shore of the continent and started swimming around the whole thing.
---
It’s literally what pushed me to 60.  Anytime I thought of rolling an alt, I remembered the pain it was to get that flight point connected.
---
I used to like standing on the ledge of the tram in stealth on my horde rogue and then pounce on lone passengers just as the tram took off.
---
I can’t believe people are treating this like a progression race tbh. This content has been cleared, many times. Even more if you count private servers. The game is 15 years old. We know the ins and outs of the classes, items and boss fights. If you think you need a perfect 40 man raid comp to clear anything in Classic WoW, you’re on a different planet. The min-maxing will be for guilds that are trying to break speedrun records, and I doubt that group of players with that kind of interest in speedruns is big enough to really have any kind of influence over how other guilds do things.
---
That's goof at least the most common bugs tend to be the most annoying.
---
The rarer ones a lot of people find to be "fun"
---
Hunter is legit fine. Yes guilds won't take a bunch of them but majority of raids will run at least 2.
---
12 of July is the last day of beta... This makes me so sad... I am currently leveling fishing and cooking, both at 200 atm... Why they are stopping the beta :(((
---
How's that working out for you?
---
you are making bad arguments. in most cases the healing pallies will do a better job of this because they are watching the tanks while the ret pally is busy doing very low dps.
---
i am sorry that losing an argument gets you wound up
---
Nice man, that's going to feel so great playing Classic in the colder months snug in your new place, thinking back to your old Wrath days :)
---
Lol no it wasn't
---
Kinda hyped for when classic dies out and all the true vanilla fans can play on a good pserver following this. 
---
Because classic surely is doomed.
---
It's funny, because nobody likes you guys.
---
&gt; You're as stubborn as a mule.
---
I could be worse. I could be stubborn as a mule and wrong on top of that, like you are.
---
&gt; You haven't even played on Private servers, so you don't know the meta.
---
Nice assumption here, buddy. You also assume that private servers are a good benchmark, while they are all guesswork.
---
&gt; Also, "effective bis" isn't the same as "bis". Read what I said.
---
Effective bis doesn't mean shit. A piece of equip is BiS or it's not. There is no in between.
---
 Not maybe, you should have. It’s frustrating for the reasons I said, people bog down the sub because they would rather make their own thread and try to get some internet points than comment on someone else’s post.
---
Stfu
---
Oh I went through all that about 13-14 years ago lol
---
Posts like this put me back onto hunter, and then I'll see 10 people posting about Hunters are garbage, nobody wants them, etc etc. When I played Vanilla we almost always had a Hunter, so this confused me as well
---
That's an opinion based on the assumption that one cares to be in a so called "hardcore" or "progression" guild, not a fact. Fact is if you do roll a Human Rogue AND go for swords, which is an entirely different discussion, you might have a DPS advantage compared to a non Human Rogue using swords assuming same gear and player skill.
---
I know you’re trolling, boy
---
This should be changed lol. The system only existed because of bad internet it should not exist in the same capacity now.
---
Humor
---
Why are they trying to recreate the latency we had back then?  That sounds like a very silly thing to try and recreate.
---
I cleared 4H in Vanilla and we didn’t have the potential problems you’re outlining here.
---
Real progression requiring consumables only happened in Naxx, and that’s because it’s the first time Blizz actually tuned encounters around having them. Everything before that didn’t require consumables and there wasn’t much pressure to load up on them, especially when you had the raid on farm status.
---
Play it super drunk.  That way you won't know what you are doing most of the time.

Where does he get the 400ms from ? I have a hard time believing Classic has a tickrate of 2.5 Hz (even with batching).

Or better yet if your a hunter in a raid in vanilla dont have your pet out period unless your fighting a boss and they are set on passive.  Then you just use them for the buff they give to your dps like a wolf with their howl.  Have that howl macro’ed into your rotation so you dont have to keep on hitting it.  Outside of that pets are usless in raids.  They pretty much die almost instantly if you put them on a boss since they have no defence to protect themselfs.  Another reason why hunter dps was subpar in vanilla raids.
---
I remember being so scared when I was like 12 that when I pulled the disc out it would freeze and I’d have to start over again
---
i am 100% not trolling.  you don't know about the damage increase from +5 weapon skill?  that is hit and less glancing blows.
---
you do realize that hitting the target does more damage than when you don't hit?
---
Don't forget to copy out your UI/Macros!
---
Where do you collect shredder manuals?
---
Sweet the most populated/desired class got even better, sick game
---
i been playing drunk for years...i would need something stronger
---
It's a horde quest in Ashenvale.
---
spy
---
&gt;Let me guess, his argument is " herp derp #nochanges".
---
I repeat... I can tell you didn’t listen to the interview.
---
Losing an argument requires you actually making a point, rather than commenting random crap.
---
&gt; You're arguing that it should be removed because "fuck the people with shitty connections".
---
Because one couldn't possibly believe the game would play better and be more balanced.. no, the only justification is to fuck certain people.
---
And if you call me out for saying it's a strawmen I'll just accuse you of not knowing what a strawman is 😂
---
Better ask mom
---
&gt; they've been played for years with 16 debuff slots.
---
Yeah, they've been. Back in Vanilla hunters used serpent sting on bosses. That doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.
---
&gt; On top of that, I basically had to educate you on the speedrun meta.
---
Yeah, no. You just went on a tirade about speedrun meta as if I didn't know it, while it wasn't even relevant.
---
Screw you. At least you got into the beta.
---
That there is a train between Ironforge and Stormwind. 
---
My very first character was a Night Elf  Druid. The quest for the water form was in Westfall. I traveled to the Wetlands (the ship didn't work in the early days and you were teleported by an NPC!). I even found my way to Ironforge and  entered the train instance. But since I wanted to go south and the minimap showed the train travel east/west, I left. 
---
After looking for another way south for several hours, I ran back to the Wetlands and swam along the coast to Westfall. I even thought that must be the way I was supposed to do it because the questgiver said something about he hopes I have strong legs.
---
Imagine my surprise when I took  the train in Stormwind (traveling east/west!) to end up in Ironforge!
---
Remember the quest you got in the human starting area that required you to bring a parcel to Dun Morogh? I abandoned that quest because I didn't want to swim back to the Wetlands!
---
You're thinking so short term. Pocket heals for your warrior while leveling? Psh. That's what bandages are for.
---
If you were smart, you would convince her to roll a mage.
---
The ports, foods, CC and damage are great, but the ultimate reason would be GOLD.
---
Think about how much gold will flow into your bag if she learns the joy of farming on a mage! (What's yours is hers and what's hers is yours, right?)
---
Don't forget, faster leveling with aoe grinding is a great bonus too!
---
Restorative Potion
---
You're the only one who has brought up non-WoW scenarios, twice now.
---
The amount of time you're willing to spend justifying not giving a few silver for someone doing something nice for you is honestly kind of mind boggling. If a please and thanks is all that you're willing to offer to someone for their small services, then just be honest about it dude. If you're gonna be cheap, then own it. Trying to use some ridiculous slippery slope analogy doesn't justify anything, it just makes me feel less inclined to continue the discussion with you.
---
Why are you rude to me? I got into the beta like other people, by pure luck. Peace
---
Oh shit I didn’t! Well I’m glad it’s finally been addressed, thanks for sharing that mate
---
You just reminded me to roll on a PvE server
---
Why all the spoiler tags?
---
Great job - amazingly thorough work, btw.
---
&gt; We will know where they are gonna go long before launch man. They are gonna want to reserve their names. Avoiding them will be easy if you really want to avoid them.
---
streamers can still claim their names off stream. so the only way to look for their server is by trying to create their name yourself, which is only useful for the first person that tries that.
---
Uhhhhh.... Yes
---
I mean, oui
---
This is the clearly the best set in all of wow.  I see no problem here!
---
Somebody in the thread where a poster decompiled the 1.12 client claimed they went digging through some of the older clients and found that it was introduced in 1.10.
---
No idea where they *found* those older clients, mind you.
---
2 would be on the low side IMO, but you did say at least.  It's funny how many people on this Reddit think their guild roster is going to be so huge and active hourly that they will have pick of the litter at all times in raid comp to force people in and out as required by class and spec.   
---
90% of the player guilds will struggle to fill the 40 man raid with all guild members at times, and from there they will fill with whatever's available after tanks and heals are covered.  
---
Something many people here seem to be unable to comprehend.  
---
I would probably raise your 2 hunters to about a 4-5 hunter average in 40 man content.  But your on the right venue.
---
I spent a lot of time on RP PVP servers. Ravenholdt, VeCo, and Emerald Dream. The communities just feel more 'engaged' with the game. Friendlier, more welcoming. Like we're all gamers at the same table.
---
With that spec, you only need to use mind flay to apply the initial 5 stacks of Weaving, then you can just R1 mind blast from a safer distance to keep it up.
---
No, you can´t kill named boss more than once (unless it´s someone like Whitemane who was lorewise able to get ressurected) and I doubt that the horse will come to you after using your Hearthstone or flight path.
---
Your "solution" (similar to pretty much every RPG with a mount by the way...you just whistle, use reigns, etc. and the mount comes to you) doesn´t sound like something you put a lot of effort into.
---
My WotLK guild was on Grim Batol, the de facto Portuguese server, but we also had a bunch of Germans, Scandinavians, and some Eastern Europeans. For the most part it's fairly straightforward. As long as you know basics like "kite" and "taunt" you're set.
---
He's actually said on-stream that he's not going to announce where he's rolling, but we'll see if that changes.
---
He said that he doesn't want streamsnipers and "mongoloids" sniping him. He said this like a month ago though, so his opinion may have changed.
---
**You think you do, but you don't**
---
Watching this sub have their weekly meltdowns has validated that statement in so many ways.
---
Human has some advantages in the sword/mace bonus, extra rep, and perception for pvp. Human is probably better in just about every scenario, but I would still play whichever you prefer cosmetically.
---
Nobody is going to reject you from a guild or raid because you are a dwarf. Hope this helps!
---
Yeah, you are getting boring.  Let me know when you have another stupid opinion.
---
I always roll dwarf so I can RP that thick Scottish accent
---
Yes
---
I think I was level 15 or so before I noticed that my first tier talents were 1/5 not 1/1. I was confused why the 2nd tier hadn't opened up.
---
Beware of the voodoo
---
Taunt can be a great threat spike, but if you are underleved enough for taunt resists to be a possibility then saving it and telling dps to wait for sunders is safer.
---
Darkmoon cards?
---
Just a joke bud. Je m'en fiche
---
They are doing I house testing 40+
---
**[EU-Eng][(RP)-PVP][Alliance] &lt;Crab Bucket&gt; is recruiting mature players for Classic!**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **(RP)-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
*Note: If RP-PVP servers are not available on launch, we will play on the PVP server.*
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
Please join our discord "Crab Bucket" qN9ywMy or write Perpo#9044 for further information.
---
That's a lot of gymnastics to try and back up hyperbole.  You could have just owned it bro.
---
That's dumb.
---
That was PvP realms. PvE made it optional even in those zones. And RP is on PvE rules.
---
Which makes zero sense for RP.
---
There are no spell/items with 10 yard range. Unless you consider the melee leway range.
---
The addon can tell you "yes bloodthirst is in range" but it cannot tell you things like "Target 4.6 yards away"
---
With the potions on the table :-D
---
You are very welcome sir
---
I would say level the warrior with your friends, as warrior leveling is brutal solo. However if you want to main warrior more than mage but you think you'll be playing significantly more solo than with friends since getting everyone on at the same time can be difficult, then I would say go ahead and solo level warrior. Basically I say level whichever character you want the most in the setting where you will be playing more often.
---
But it isn't just like when WoW launched. When WoW launched there was an initial rush followed by steady population growth, WoW classic will have a massive day one influx followed by a sharp decline as the tourists leave. It won't be just like launch in any way, shape or form - even if the game itself is the same the population will not be. With that in mind, layering is the solution with the least downsides.
---
    
---
&gt; If the thought of having to deal with a little adversity truly bothers you that much, I daresay WoW: Classic isn't the game for you.      
---
     
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
I hope they have a big ass house
---
If my nuts are numb it's only from over use Meg.
---
Warrior tanks are always in demand and you will find a home quickly.  The best way to take the sting out of leveling a warrior is to approach each zone with a completionism perspective.  This will help you stay a level or two above the monsters which is critical as you reach middle/late leveling when pulling extra mobs results in death.  Getting raid ready as a warrior tank is one of the easiest things you can do in game. This is because there will be a sharply stunted supply of tanks.  You will be able to fill dungeon groups with a quickness.  Towards the end game, warrior is amazing.  A good tank really shines more than any DPS does.  They matter, DPS is just replaceable.
---
I’ve changed my mind from Rogue to Warlock to Priest to Hunter to Shaman. Currently stuck between Troll Hunter and Troll Shaman. 
---
Background: Mained NE Resto Druid from Vanilla through Cata, skipped MoP, then mained Dwarf Resto Shammy from Legion through today. I was determined to focus on DPS this time around, but really love shaman kit. I’ll be fairly casual in both PVE/PVP due to RL commitments and still enjoying BfA. 
---
Hunter Pros: New role and class (never leveled one past ~20). Probably playing solo a fair bit. I remember a couple of great Vanilla hunters who bossed dungeons/raids as MA, marking/pulling/trapping/kiting everything and controlling the flow. Always hoped to be like that. 
---
Shaman Pros: Support classes are apparently my thing. Love the flavor: zapping dudes, nature heals, totem flexibility, chilling as a wolf. Happy to heal although 30/0/21 for PVP seems fun. I remember thinking shaman were unbeatable in Vanilla BGs.
---
Any help is appreciated.
---
I tried /questie hideobjecties on private serv. Works like a charm!
---
Sure I'll make sure to write it in crayon so you can understand.
---
So the Long Night begins.
---
Incapacitate and disorient are different names for the same category. Also blind seems not to be in that category in 1.12 at least. Maybe they got it wrong in the patch notes or it changed later on. Because in tbc blind got a DR.
---
Also just straight up changed significantly and barely resemble the original, like WC and Scholo.
---
I'm going to have a bloody good go.
---
Owh yeah I forgot about that one, I'm sure that has happened on some servers.
---
Ur dumb
---
Yah, I didn't hide that fact...
---
That literally has nothing to do with this post
---
But classic came out 5,335 days ago
---
Yeah, but about that search terms?
---
They should run it on old servers with old switch architecture and then throttle the game down to 2005 speeds then.
---
That's kind of a weird thing for him to say considering the work they did to make it run on 8.whatever on the newer servers and all the bugs and incorrect things that introduced.
---
Combat rogues are considered the worst spec for rogues in PvE according to a highly reputable class tier list I read. But I don't think it will hinder you from raiding or PvP. 
---
Regardless, have a great time!
---
Vs. bogging it down with half the post QQing about layering.  This place is a shit show so just let the crap rain.
---
&gt;**stand** in the backline heroic striking
---
You need to run to activate leeway though.
---
Smh phone, get with the program
---
I think you dont understand how low your dps will be. Mages also give other mages more dps w ignite and winters chill. Warriors give battle shout to their group. You arent the only class that buffs your groups' dmg. But you do less than half the dmg they do.
---
6 hours to level ten is completely off. You should be lvl 10 wihtin 2-3 hours during the zerg. If lvl 10 takes you 6 hours, there is absolutely no way that you will be lvl 20 in 21 hours.
---
Can confirm, rolling ret/holy and am a masochist.
---
But that's not how it is working on Beta. Melee attacks do not trigger if the target is RP walking or backpedaling. Thus, the psuedocode is still `IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(...)`. The question that again, remains unanswered (even by this "working as intended" post), is whether or not slows that cause a walking animation should be classified as walking for the purposes of leeway.
---
Most likely Sydney time at a guess
---
&gt;but its not how the game was designed to be played, and ultimately takes away from the fun of classic imo, retail is and has been designed in a particular way to be min maxxed since WotLK.
---
Exactly and my guild exists of people who left when the min maxxing started and we will not do that in Classic either. 
---
There are guilds that will compete world wide, guilds that will compete server wide and guilds that will not compete at all but try to have fun and overcome each challenge at their own pace and explicitly NOT rush through dungeons or raids, because that is what made them stop playing retail.
---
It is not clueless to play what you want to play. There will be room for second best specs and third best specs, especially in MC. Half of my raid were mouse clickers and we still managed to raid. We also still had a challenge when others were only waiting for TBC to arrive and were bored to death.
---
I am way more scared that the min maxxers are leaving way too fast, bored again after a few months, while I think the people who take it slow and try to have fun at their pace and in their way will stay, pay and make Classic work for a long time.
---
This. Does anyone remember how hard it was to get 40 people together? Haha, I think raid rosters will be a little more slapped together than most people think
---
I blame all you assholes for bitching about spell batching. You know who you are.
---
**You** had poor latency in Vanilla. Not everyone did. Most people I knew would pick their realm based on the data center to get one with lower ping. I had ~60 ms but knew people who lived in Southern California with like 12 ms to the West Coast realms. Most Euros I knew who played on European realms had like 10-30 ms because America's internet infrastructure and ISPs have always sucked shit.
---
What about someone that does not have WoW at all?Do they need to pay for the full game just to play Classic ?
---
You're doing the same saying tips are justified. We're at an agree to disagree. If nobody is offering free water and I need it now, and I'm not willing to wait for some free water, I'll offer up gold to expedite the service. But if someone is offering free water in trade chat, I'll take it, don't feel bad not tipping them since they weren't asking for it.
---
Robes of Guardian Saint.
---
My internet has not changed since 2006. No updates no new options. I have the same provider and lines. I still have the same ms as before. So yes this shit doesn't really matter to me it should be the same.
---
Ok, and to give you the embarrassing part:
---
Of course I immediately set my hearthstone to Westfall. So I couldn't go back to Darnassus. I gave up the Druid and started a Human Warlock. I leveled through Elvynn Forrest, Redridge Mountain, Westfall, Duskwood and Stranglethorn. In Stranglethorn I saw a Tauren, fell in love with that race and switched to horde to play a Tauren Druid (which became my main character) and leveled to 60.
---
I learned about the train eventually when someone someday suggested to raid Stormwind, but enter through Ironforge and the tunnel.
---
Final note on this, I like how people act like there would have been new players to wow blindly picking the wrong server, even if it was unofficial. I’m pretty sure 99% of players looking forward to vanilla understand that you should research your server before blindly picking a dead/incompatible one. 
---
People were acting like everyone would just pick a server as if we were 11 years old again and realize a month into starting that we accidentally picked the server Moonguard that had a bunch of dudes asking if I wanted to join a satanist sex cult.
---
It’s much better this way, but even without it people would have 100% figured out a way to play comfortably, no one is that stupid anymore.
---
Be a rogue then you can wear erotic bondage outfits like gimp masks and such.... mmmm I’m exited already to fap over your character
---
That’s how I felt about rolling a Druid on a p server lol.
---
I keep forgetting if human females in vanilla had the weapon scaling bug that made their weapons ludicrously large until they were scaled down in WoD, or if that was introduced later.
---
If they have the huge anime weapons, it is tempting to play human female even though I typically play Horde.
---
I must be confused, I thought humans were S tier race because of spirit? Or is this a meme lol
---
Congrats. This has to be the best news they could have received. If they planned it all along, they should of mentioned it before though!
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Get ready to never ever escape anyone if they melee you is what it amounts to. Right now rogues can sprint through our traps too and not set them off, its not good.
---
For sure. And both appeal to me. Shaman fantasy is great and a blast for pvp. I dont mind healing either. Con is enhance is a dead spec tbh. Rogue just got all these cool tools, stealth pick lock/pocket fast paced combat. Both got nice gear options too. I dont care much for cloth users in vanilla tbh. I want some longevity and dont wanna get bored. The two things i dislike about both is mana drainage and the energy system feels boring at times.
---
It's been done before.  I mean, it takes the right gear and healers but has been done and proven viable.  I wouldn't recommend it as a main stay, but we had a guild on Stormreaver that used a shaman as a main tank or off tank in raids and they full cleared everything.  I doubt they had him tanking Naxx etc, but I did personally seen him in action in MC.  Honestly, his threat generation was pretty insane. 
---
Keep in mind, highly unlikely it's viable without already having raid gear for it haha.  For all I know he was pimped out while healing as an LOL just for this purpose.
---
Which means that you can't listen to u/Mshaffy
---
Do you have a link for cross-realm PvP? Battleground didn't come out till TBC IIRC
---
Also, hunters do competitive dps in the first few phases. They only really fall off in AQ/Naxx. Don't be worried about your dps compared to others in MC.
---
I agree.
---
I have a few people who will not be reserving names mostly because they know their names won’t be taken at release.
---
I will be fighting for my first name of Ridik, but if I don’t get it I usually just use Ridikiscali. The guys who don’t care go by obscure names that no one will take.
---
You ok bro?
---
BattleGROUPS* not BGs
---
Really? Im not too up to date about specs but thought combat was pve king. Regardless I like big weapons !!
---
And you have zero creativity. Glad that's settled. You do you.
---
leveling twinks isn't the hard part, it's keeping them in the right level bracket that's difficult. This is especially important for the lower level brackets, if you're a high enough level to enter a dungeon you need loot from, then your job is to stay far enough away that you don't get xp but close enough that when a boss comes up that you need to loot, you can easily do so.  
---
As far as speed leveling, I'd say that just leveling a character normally is the way to go, or else speed runners would be using the dungeon method a lot more.
---
Can confirm, she likes pain. I'll be following her around as a holy/disc smite priest to try and keep things patched up.
---
Servers can handle 10-15k without crashing today, you don't need a queue
---
The cs 1.6 days and all the half life mods I would play were the best gaming iv done because of those home servers. Getting on every night and playing with the same group of people was great.
---
&gt; Players are BETTER these days and have completed much more challenging content than Vanilla WoW has to offer.
---
no shit dude, that's exactly what I'm talking about. We cleared almost all the content with hunters using shit debuffs, so OFC shadow priests are viable. Not optimal, but viable. Ofc if you have a lot of warlocks a shadow priest will be gucci, but you shouldn't have too many locks anyway.
---
You say a lot of blablabla which boils down to "whatever you do you'll clear content". Yes, we do know that.
---
Meme specs will still suck.
---
Ahhhh my eyes.
---
That money is hard to earn and easy to spend when I was borrowing gold from guildies for my first mount at level 44.
---
God I hope so or it will be unplayable
---
Bye Felicia
---
All I'm seeing is excuses for bad players
---
You can host way more than 3-4k on a single homogeneous server, but layerings allows for no queue times (big plus for players), and it allows blizzard to scale DOWN, saving them metric fuck tons on an AWS bill.
---
This makes me happy. Thank you.
---
I'm nochanges and I don't have a problem with leeway. We wanted Classic WoW warts and all.
---
I hear there's tons of bugs in silithus too
---
How do I know what? All I'm telling you is what they do.
---
I don't know what their motivation is. But I suspect that they simply get off on causing others grief. I get no joy fighting people that can't possibly lose. Do you? Would you go bowling with a 5 year old and get all pumped up and excited because you won?
---
 Everyone knows where llv 60s hang out/farm gold. If they wanted to fight lvl 60s, it's pretty easy to find them.
---
30 foot melee range...
---
Hybrid priest is great. I don't know much about them, however. What combination do they use?
---
Yep, hunter is fuc\*\*\* by leeway. Players will learn how to play with leeway and deadzone and no-match you. Especially if the can get  throught you freezing trap just, lol.
---
An when Leeway range addon will pop, fight versus range are gonna be about leeway.
---
But it's "authentic" so it's here.
---
We didn't have 4k TVs back then either.
---
Layering allows for no queues.  There will be way more than 10k players on launch.
---
It also allows blizzard to scale servers down when they aren't needed.  Huge cost savings.
---
Why were you excited for Classic WoW? You were hoping that they would make the game off a private server rather than the original vanilla game?
---
Well you do you, but I think you're giving up on it before you've even given it a shot. Vanilla WoW had a great community, at least on my little server!
---
[Bullshit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8q06y/melee_leeway_is_working_as_intended/esoz345) 
---
The majority of leeway complaints I see are from private server PvP players.
---
I'm hearing this a lot. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Holy shit. Thanks for the heads up, I will alert Bobby Kotick and the rest of the C suite and tell them their subscribers are at stake if they don't fix this issue right away.
---
This is exciting. I'm actually considering joining a Spanish language server to practice my Spanish.
---
Nice work.
---
Vuhdoo.
---
retconed
---
People in dungeons get very cross with you if you let your pets grab agro randomly.  I played warlock and hunter in vanilla, and left my pets on aggressive.  What is the use of a pet who is passive and won't fight?
---
It was never gatekeeping, what the hell is even wrong with you types. It was literally just a phrase that united the entire Classic community under the idea that Blizzard shouldn't be trying to re-balance the game 
---
Obviously it was directed at things like micro-transactions, raid tuning, class balance, and dual spec. Stuff like that. Nobody is defending 'melee leeway' because just about everyone agree's that it's a shit mechanic in todays gaming. 
---
The gas-lighting on subjects like this is getting old as fuck. 
---
Like 90% of the people here that like to take regular shits on people who say no-changes were literally no-changes people themselves not even that long ago.
---
This is ridiculous. Spell batching needs to be tuned way down.
---
Don't worry about not being able to cast scatter shot. It shares a DR with freezing trap so good hunters will learn not to use it unless 100% needed.
---
wow, if he can do 1-40 in 10 minutes then the record to 60 is going to be obliterated
---
&gt;You do understand that people from Quebec are not French but are Canadians ?
---
Ya french Canadians. But let's stop right there.
---
If I was ignorant enough to think ALL french people are terrible people deep down inside, do you think I would care about some random terminology. The post was a joke dude.
---
It will have a strong community feeling. Just probably not 12,000 people at once.
---
You're going to be salty as fuck when a try-harding meme spec out damages you 😂 I remind you yet again that a feral druid was no.1 damage on a kel'thuzad kill in one of the best speed running guilds in existence.
---
As a healer who got her fair share of heart attacks because of suicidal warlocks: You won't get me this time. I allow you to die!
---
TBC combat was THE spec for sure but according to what I read that's not the case for classic. Let me dig for this tier list and I will reply to you soon
---
I play Druid. I am on the Horde.
---
It wasn't too hard a choice.

It'll take more than 10 minutes /s

And these things are possible with 15ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms spell batching.
---
Apparently it's still possible to double sheep on retail.
---
Yes, it makes these mechanics easier, but easier double blinds =/= a better game
---
What's the difference?
---
I have always been horde for the most part... But Goldshire may be enough to make me go Alliance. :/
---
Cool. Always interesting to see new discoveries!
---
I figure I'll make sure my guild master is aware just so they don't put me in a group of healers and expect me to drop mana tide.
---
Glad it worked out for you. Hopefully my totems and chain heal make up for the lack of top heal status.
---
The "impact" is identical to what it was in 2006. This is *maintaining* 1.12 class balance. If you want better PvP class balance, Classic is not and never was going to be for you.
---
Someone whose idea of creative solution to a problem is something that has been used as game mechanic for probably decades saying I have zero creativity.
---
Thank you, that´s really nice of you.
---
Bc they thrash &amp; mosh when you /dance.
---
They didn't fix it, because TBC was right around the corner, and Naxx didn't matter.
---
Yeah, keep sunken temple the same!
---
Wait... What are we here for?
---
Who?
---
Not true
---
Like you could in vanilla.
---
Do you have it saved to your HD at all? I’d love a PM’d Google Drive link or something. If not no worries though.
---
Oh I remember, even when raids moved down in size you still had to make due with oddball comps due to roster.  They will have the old memories jogged and eyes opened soon enough (again).  
---
This is how many of us who were there know that none of these guys claiming you won't raid unless X Race/ X Class/ X Spec are completely wrong.  I mean, they can min/max all they want it's cool, but demand will outweigh the supply and voids will be filled.  
---
I am just ready for it to be here.
---
Record holder for 1-60 in vanilla wow.
---
Sounds like you're most excited about druid, so that's what I would recommend. Off tanking as a druid is definitely a thing, although easier for alliance than horde (alliance has pally blessings to increase stats while horde windfury totem does not affect bear druid, therefore less dps and harder to hold threat). Since you state that you're not going to be super hardcore, most guilds have no problem taking a feral druid to off tank (most will even take a feral dps). Super tryhard guilds probably won't, but they are in a large minority of the population. Plus tank druids are probably the best dungeon tanks, since their AOE threat is probably better than warriors.
---
Has the OSRS vote gone through already? I had heard that a sizeable portion of the playerbase planned to vote against it.
---
I was mistaken all are considered the same tier for pve. PvP is a different story:
---
https://rankedboost.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-best-dps-tier-list/
---
Yeah, you should play the intended 2019 WoW instead and go back to retail.
---
Alright. Another Hunter I assume?
---
&gt;Now explain the genocide of the Draenei that occurred prior to the mind control.
---
I don't have to. 
---
&gt;They lived in peace with the draenei refuges and were at war with the ogres. Eventually, the presence of the draenei drew the Burning Legion to Draenor. After investigating of the world, the powerful Eredar demon lord Kil'jaeden tricked the respected shaman Ner'zhul into striking a bargain with him. He convinced Ner'zhul that the draenei were conspiring against the orcs, and were planning on attacking. In exchange for their service to the Burning Legion, Ner'zhul and all of the orcs would receive the power necessary to conquer vast new lands, and Kil'jaeden would have an army able to crush the draenei. To obtain this power, the orcs would need to first drink from the blood of Mannoroth the Destructor, a mighty pit lord of the Burning Legion.
---
This is of course post retcon (where the Draeni were changed from natives of Outland to refugees), but the stories were the same as far as I can remember save the Draeni origin story. 
---
&gt; The truth is that Draenor is a savage place that created a very savage group. 
---
No, even prior to the retcons the burning legion saw potential for the Orcs to be a great military asset, it was just a matter of getting them to do their bidding.
---
I’m saying you’re wrong about the content of the interview. But how can I explain that to somebody who’s already sure the extent of the argument is “nochanges brah lol”.
---
Trolls are just the cooler Horde priest. Horde side priest race doesn't matter that much. When it comes to other classes and races for alts, I haven't decided yet. I don't care about min-maxing that. I'd much rather choose based on what kind of toon I want to look at for n+ hours.
---
If I was rolling alliance priest I would go for dwarf. That's the one exception. The "Dwarf priest is the only priest"-thing is widespread enough that I wouldn't want to listen to whining about why I'm not a dwarf.
---
I hope your right, I wouldnt mind the smaller lesser known ones who just want to deliver content but Asmongold and Tipsout will be pretty cancerous to what ever server they pick will be dealing with their horde of mouth breathers.
---
The plan was to name my character Danny Devito, so I have to play a dwarf as classic didn't have goblin as an option.
---
Time is money friend
---
https://youtu.be/SpC3lZdk2HM
---
You're welcome. I'm done with this exchange clearly you're trolling.
---
I found out that leveling 30-40 on mobs in desolace, as a hunter, using only melee, was not how everyone else was doing it.  
---
My leveling partner, a warrior, assured me it was the way to level......come to find out, at level 60 he still didn't know what first aid was....again, as a warrior.  
---
So basically I found out not all advice is good advice.
---
Racials are a consideration but at the end of the day the game isn't balanced around them. A nelf priest will heal just as well, don't get suckered into it.
---
Add an orc mage called Battlemage
---
RIP druid choice...I always hated that about the class. I feel for you I mained a druid back in vanilla though I was the better race ;)
---
Spell batching isn't FPS, if you had 60fps then you won't feel any difference. Everyone had spell batching.
---
You mean like interp and all forms of lag compensation? Same concept, just accounting for a different type of game and applying it more widely.
---
Im a p server pvp player and no one I know wanted it changed. Guys probably a salty mage. As per the post yestersay leeway range is that extra 2.6 yards, the exact same as every pserver ive ever played on
---
Probably, but I don’t think you need the expansions. Just a sub after buying it.
---
HA
---
That site is wierd. Fury is tier3 pve dps and Elemental is tier1.
---
Why would we imagine that?
---
A druid can pretty much always escape while hearthstone has a 1h cooldown so i stand by my stance. Can the paladin survive longer in an actual fight? Yeah but the druid can probably get the fuck out, ultimatelly not getting killed while the paladin ends up dying after 5min
---
Masterbage
---
I see, a player of class!
---
Im having trouble with this too. Funny thing is I plan on playing a paladin...so that narrows it down to 2 options. If given two options I would pick the more rare one, so that means dwarf right? But if I ever get far enough to the end game stuff I would be a dwarf healer pally standing next to a bunch of dwarf priests right? IDK I guess it doesn't matter.
---
It doesn't really matter, wotf is once every 2minutes, in group pvp it's not that powerful and it doesn't do shit for dots.
---
Pally may be 10-12% but that's still 1 every BG on average, not even counting premades (where the advantage is way stronger).  Don't forget the trade-off, that's 10-12% less dispelling power on the horde side in favor of an offensive purge (strong but not as strong in this particular scenario).
---
It's not one sided towards alliance, but I think people neglect these things when discussing wotf/fear when claiming warlock in pvp are useless on the alliance side.
---
I'm going to create a throwaway char day 1, see the mayhem that is initial zone fighting over respawns, then wait to see till the dust settle and create my "main" (aka first alt :p)
---
Why would they freeze themself for the 16th anniversary rerelease of a game that just came out?
---
Im way to happy to one day be on the quest again to find the missing pages of The Green Hills of Stranglethorn.
---
I have a smile just thinking about it.
---
the beta ends soon?
---
whens the end?
---
Would rather sacrifice xrealm BGs than have a server that 80%+ horde/alliance server with hour long queues.
---
yeah
---
All my characters are nightelves because they look the coolest.
---
I think some things were missing in their old stuff, such as the stuff about elites doing too little dmg and they used a old video someone made to check the numbers.
---
I have fond memories of Goldshire myself. I spent many nights there just chilling and chatting and duelling. I also ended up being pretty good friends with some of the regulars.
---
However I'm not sure I'd be able to recreate that or even want to try. I was young and easily entertained back then. The socialness that Classic will hopefully have and retail definitely doesn't have is something I'm looking forward to, but not to the point where I'd wanna spend my limited free time constantly sat around in Goldshire anymore. I'll have to dedicate my time to levelling/profs/pvp, and any leisure time will go to world pvp/probably Crossroads if its as active as I hope.
---
Tldr: I miss goldshire but not enough to go alliance for
---
fella... you know cross server bg was realised IN CLASSIC WOW?!
---
They were introduced in 1.12 as the flagship feature, along with multitude of other pvp changes.
---
Yes, everyone will run an energy tick addon and use speed pots, just to avoid hunter traps. This will totally work every time!
---
paladins use dildos and analbeads to hurt you haha
---
It's being polled right now. Thing is, Jagex has added to the game certain things that didn't pass the vote (The green pixel on the construction icon has become a meme for this reason, for example) as they add it to "integrity changes". With their newest blog post, a lot of the playerbase fear it's only a matter of time before micro transactions are introduced to the game.   
---
I just don't want to see the same thing happen for Classic WoW...
---
Yeah looking at this a 2nd time idk where some of this logic is coming from. Ive been zerging data lately and I've been mixing things up quite a bit over the last week or so. My apologies for the misinformation
---
cool
---
It was an exploit in TBC. They were mostly % based buffs. So you could easily send 5 people into Onyxias lair at 70 and get a buff that was still super powerful. It wasn’t getting 40 60s in and getting one buff... you could easily have 5 groups of 5 for 5 seperate buffs, which is actually broken. 
---
If they made X=1 I wouldn’t be against that. It would kind of nullify the weaker buffs, though. When you can only get one buff, you wouldn’t go hunt down the weaker ones, and they would probably become entirely unused. Still, 1 is better than 10 from a gameplay standpoint.
---
Can strife side to side and possibly even jump up and down, so only the other target really has to be running, making it easier to abuse.
---
&gt; You're going to be salty as fuck when hybrids are stealing loot from you
---
won't happen, but whatever floats your boat
---
&gt; I remind you yet again that a feral druid was no.1 damage on a kel'thuzad
---
Link?
---
With the 1.12 quest state? No chance in hell you'll run out of quests.
---
Great, ranged is dead, ty bli$$
---
That's not a new mechanic.
---
 NP Buddy.  but ive seen this site before and the data is not right.
---
The fact that it is official already makes it better than any private server for 95% of the playerbase. They could literally release retail wow but capped at 60 and it would have more players than private servers just for the fact that its official. You're in the minority
---
You could also consider druid. Stealth farming is a thing. A Rogue and a druid can two man alot of stuff.
---
I don't recall Vanilla launch, but all expansions have never had a open beta. I think people are stretching it to have expected one. Going by Blizzard's track record they just don't do them for WoW.
---
It shouldn't share a dr should it?
---
No not really but it rubs me the wrong way with all of the min-max guides out there which influence peoples decisions.
---
&gt; Well most ~~of the~~ mages ~~that whine about this~~ are hot garbage so...
---
Melbournian here! *Or* if you just have a really messed up sleep schedule.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish!
---
It must be pretty hard to play with Italians. Being able to only use one hand must suck.
---
12th
---
Neither are melee leeway or spell batching. Most people still didn't know about them.
---
So I didn’t play in Vanilla but I’ve been a Ret main since I started in Wrath(though I’m an altoholic so not overly attached). I’ve never played a Classic private server or anything and I want to go in blind without trying things out. That said, is Ret as bad as everyone says it is? I’ve played a lot of Holy as well and enjoy that but apparently it’s rather expensive to swap so picking one is sounding like my best bet. Reckoning seems like a lot of fun in PvP but of course that’s probably not very viable for PvE and they’re all highlight videos so that could be like 1 out of every 20 fights that gets shown. It just seems like the kind of build you have as an alt to just go fuck around on every now and then. If I wanted to PvE in any serious manner and I wanted to play Ret (all the “screw meta play what’s fun” aside) how much would I be shooting myself in the foot?
---
undead. because they have most badass casting animation :)
---
Ready to work
---
Yeah look at how different this info is compared to what I just linked:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7hl9bq/classic_wow_pve_tier_list_112/
---
Didn't play classic, what was its real value?
---
No it's a completely valid argument, under your definition of a bug. Layering itself is the problem, there isn't a problem with its implementation.
---
Mountains out of molehills.
---
Priest holy nova has one of the best farms in the game when DME is accessible, and the pvp doesn't suck... i dont even know where to start there, but shadow is strong in small scale and wpvp, or unorganized BGs if they dont address you, and disc is a great pvp healing spec.  Its no pally, but you get an offensive + defensive dispell, fear, shield.  Very versatile.
---
Why copy paste something you dont know anything about?
---
Not at all, it´s just always fun watching people who clearly lack some ability claim how others lack it, especially when you are on the receiving end.
---
so not really soon lol
---
Taunt isn't solely a QoL improvement, that's what would stop them from making another. People on the #nochanges train really enjoy sliding down that slippery slope. 
---
I'm ok with changes as long as classes and professions play the same way. Guild banks, flight routes, even transmog, don't matter to me personally because it doesn't change how I play as a rogue/shaman/priest/etc. Adding, changing, or adjusting talents/spells/recipes are out of the question in my book.
---
i have good memories of PvP'ing as a warrior in TBC, and getting cycloned while spell reflect was up. Really made the game more interesting knowing I had to spell reflect within the first half second, while the druid had nearly a second to cancel his cyclone afterward.
---
/sarcasm.
---
Based on that logic, we should all be limited in our fps and ping... That would fix this entire issue. If they somehow did that, people would lose their collective minds.  
---
This really needs to be toned a bit. Technology has grown. People want the same or SIMILAR experience. Well, that is going to be difficult to do when melee characters have 3x the range they previously had. Isn't that OBVIOUS?
---
Lol. You might as well just write
---
 “just because I can’t come up with better alternatives that means they don’t exist. And you guys just want to complain”
---
Well, soon enough
---
In no way are you forced to do anything out of the norm as a beta tester. Just playing the game gives Blizzard information. If beta testing was about finding people always checking for bugs and mechanics like Perplexity and Monkeynews, you wouldn't have had Asmonbald and the other big streamers there in the first place.
---
There's absolutely no shame or anything wrong with just playing the game.
---
orc master race (stun resist OP)
---
You convinced me, night elf it is.
---
that's the only part i left out, 
---
RP walk or backpeddle removes leeway yeah.
---
I'd play a night elf just to spite them. Starshards op!
---
They do in the beta and from what I've seen that's how it worked in vanilla(from 1.9 to 1.12. Not sure when scatter shot got added into it's own category in tbc).
---
I was on dial up. Had to run to a friends/family members house to burn updates on cds.
---
Thanks.  I tried to condense with spoilers but it wouldn't truncate it for some reason.
---
K
---
It would be pretty upsetting
---
Hunters are mostly upset about the bugs and weren't too sure about the deadzone/range being right.
---
Anything else is indeed overblown.
---
RIP bag space
---
Yup, me neither. Disappointed at blizzard making these kind of decisions.
---
Runescape really did a good job at continuing content for its old school servers. Even if it's just raids with more complicated mechanics and side-grades to Naxx for drops
---
This is the real answer. Although, I do play human for rogue.
---
There is a huge misconception in this sub about layering
---
Layering doesn’t affect the initial rush but the new people here think it does. 
---
I’m responding to everyone to let them know. Lay off.
---
Agreed. Dude saw stuff most people had NO idea about.
---
I am very tall, and my friends played alliance, which is why I picked gnome - for the lulz
---
What can I say, I take my character very seriously.
---
No surprise that most of my friends also rip around 30s on pserver. It's part of the phrase where magic dies off and leveling slows down a lot if you don't adhere to a guide or strategy
---
Toodles
---
So, you think they won't have 3k pop layers WHEN THEY SAID THEY WILL. Because you need to bash Layering for NO REASON at all, expect for shit you made up your self? 
---
Wow.
---
Hmm. Okay, that's fair enough if that's really how it was.
---
To be clear I'm not arguing that things be changed / rebalanced. I just want to know what to expect. I'm playing either way, but with hope obviously silly the current leeway implementation is, I'm not sure I'll be playing a class that focuses on kiting.
---
Even if you have to kill like 2-3 starter mobs (they're like 10 steps from where you spawn in every starting area) it's still faster IMO.  It means you don't have to visit your trainer *at least* until lvl 4 and I wait until 6 at least half the time.
---
&gt;A
---
To me it seemed more like "Even if it is correct, it would be pretty bad to keep it in the game because of how much the infrastructure changed"
---
Kinda like spell batching, but worse
---
All these people who didn't play hunters back then are acting like it's the end of the world.
---
But is it not so, that when you are able to see the trap, it is friendly and you are not able to get caught?
---
I never said you’d have 3k for Garrick.
---
You’ll have 500 to compete with. As you would if you joined a regular wow server in 2004.
---
Classic drop, and 2004 drop, will have the same starter rush.
---
Lol, all you idiots downvoting me are in for a rude surprise come August
---
There is no base game anymore. Simply pay for the subscription and play. If you want to play BFA you will need to purchase that expansion. To play classic subscription is all that is required.
---
It wasn't just for how good your internet is, but range. Not everyone in Vanilla had a server data centre nearby. OCE players had to have 190 ping minimum.
---
the "buy list" is in order of priority.  Sometimes I'll hit that Water Breathing quest and be too low level to kill the elite.  Rather than spend extra time grinding a level I'll check the AH on my bank alt and see if it is affordable there.  
---
Bullova is indeed a crappy gray, but I always seem to have a drought of weapons around my level 30 class quest.  I'm also super tired by that point, so I don't even want to try to find a group.  Bullova is simply an easy upgrade at that point.
---
Im understanding that the dead zone is just moved further unfortunatly, meaning that you can shoot longer than 41yard but the deadzone is like 10yard
---
Ironically it's people who never played on private servers who are most often correct about classic mechanics.
---
What would me end-game outlook be for PvP -- which spec would I play to be most competitive?
---
Maybe. My friend is leaning Rogue so Hunter or a plate wearer is sounding like the move here. Don’t care much for Warrior but I’ve been a Paladin main on retail for the last 10 years, though it’s almost a completely different class in Classic
---
They should be removed now.  I tried to add them in to make the post shorter and easier to navigate.
---
At the start yes it will feel like actual Classic release. 500 people competing for mobs in northshire and no dynamic respawn, same story on each layer.
---
Civil discourse is nigh impossible on this subject.
---
Yeah. I stayed up all night doing a deep rabbit hole dive on this problem, all because I wanted to tell someone how much the subscription they were "going to withhold from Blizzard until they remove Layering" was worth to the company.
---
About to crash hard and not wake up until the fireworks start.
---
DO IT!
---
Nope you only need sub. This is true for retail as well now. The sub gives you the base game and all expansions up to Legion.
---
I wouldn’t say baseless. The fact you dismissed immersion, the fabric of classic, means I don’t care to respond to your other points anymore. You’ve lost credibility.
---
6 hours is simply worst case due to server crashes, overcrowding, and launch night shenanigans.
---
/u/eveclassic sorry what was it you were saying?
---
&gt; Do you basically have to set your pet to follow and go to that spot yourself then make them attack, or can you kind of just direct them to a spot from afar?
---
If you want to anchor your pet somewhere, you have to run there yourself first.  Ragnaros and Chromaggus come to mind where you need to do this to keep your pet alive, but usually its not needed.
---
Pet management in raids inst so bad, you just have to listen to raidcalls as if you were a melee dps, and pull your pet back from AOEs accordingly.
---
Undead and Orc Males got such aggressive animations I love it.
---
Enhancement shaman obviously
---
These are so cool. Has anyone see one for Shaman? Not even 100% what I would like to see on it but I am planning to play Shaman in Classic and I love this type of pre-planning.
---
You clearly don’t understand, nor can you articulate, the purpose of layering.
---
I find it pretty funny you’re claiming you know it but you have it backwards 😂
---
Good to know. Where to PTR’s fit in this standard?
---
Then you played on a PvP server. On PvE you had to flag your self through /PvP, attack another player (outside of duel), buff or ress a PvP tagged player or tagged npc to be tagged for PvP.
---
On PvP severs you had PvP flag on in contested zones automatically.
---
It's quite easy to find the rules for each server type online.
---
What cave entrance?
---
This should be removed, this was implemented because people had crappy internet, not because this is an essential part of vanilla WoW. And i know absolutly no one who has been like "i cant wait to play classic with the huge melee leeway like it had back in vanilla" AFAIK most people are kinda suprised my self included.
---
Yes, Im also back from a looong vacation :) Only stumbled upon the blizzcon-classic announcement a year ago and since then im hyped like a small kid :D
---
mr moneybags over there
---
Yes, since both internet reliability/speed was worse AND servers were really far away.
---
$10 says this guy had an ignite on him or something
---
Swedish guy here, I had about 25-35 ms in vanilla during my time 2005-2006.
---
Perfectly said. Tone it down a bit. I mean a Tauren hitting at 10 yard range with a melee weapon is going to break the game. Imagine that? Really sit back and think about that people. Imagine rogues popping you from  7-8 yards away.. what was the range of most pbaoe abilities? Can people even Pop a Rogue out of stealth before they can pop you? Just put some logic on this.  
---
I mean most casters HAD to kite. It was the only way to survive anything. Priests would drop a quick fear and run the opposite direction while throwing dots and or healing. Image a war coming out of fear and NOT having to charge... he can just keep whaling on you, and then his charge just becomes an additional interrupt? Really?  
---
This is user experience BREAKING imo.
---
Never even learned ignite lol
---
Technically speaking, Joana will always have the 1-60 record in terms of the original game release. Different game, therefore a new record holder will be decided.
---
You do realize that Feral is over tuned on Private Severs right? even with powershifting, wolfhead's helm and the Gnomer Mace Ferals will be nowhere near top dps on Classic. It's already been proven they do less damage in bear and cat with correct values.
---
Why are you happy about this? You will not experience the gameplay like you did in Vanilla with your bad internet, this is just gonna be weird and not how it felt in actual vanilla.
---
As a Spanish, can confirm playing in a Spanish server on vanilla back then.
---
Aesthetics.
---
I want my character to look and feel good.  That's not to say I just choose the "pretty" races, but rather that I choose the race/gender that looks the most fitting for how I want to character to feel when playing.  This can mean player model and armor appearance, as well as casting/attack/movement animations.  If I'm going to cast fireball (or whatever) 40 thousand times, I should look cool while doing it!
---
I think I always skipped these, are they worth it?
---
Literal shitpost.
---
Explain how 4k TV is like melee leeway?
---
But it is always how these things work. Blizz has said multiple times that when it comes to betas, the publicly-playable beta is ALWAYS a few builds behind the current internal beta builds.
---
Sure, because most people had significantly higher ping 15 years ago. It's too bad they hardcoded the value, because it failed to scale with tech advancement.
---
Orc Hunter... Hardiness, enough said.
---
the music during instalation of wotlk... I just finish my Black temple run, log out and run to the local game store to buy wotlk (yeah I played on private server then). Launched installer and then epic moment when the music started. I was totally in... remember how few years ago I just play WC3 and then... there were Arthas my childhood hero. You can imagine how 15years old guy could be excited about it.
---
Welcome it life sucking as a hunter. People should not be rolling hunters if they expect blizzard to care about them at all.
---
I'm talking about having all those specs together at once in a raid. They don't deal enough sustained damage (oomking) so the fights will be longer in AQ/Naxx which puts a strain on healers. Having a potential healer dps instead of heal + put shadow weaving up is not smart.
---
Avoiding this snowball effect is important, as is telling people to respec or replacing people not putting in the effort. Imagine getting to C'thun somehow and not having the damage to kill tentacles before more spawn because everyone is OOM from taking so long to kill stuff.
---
Of course it's "doable" if everyone is full BiS BWL + AQ pieces, but there is still no reason to make the later raids harder for no reason. Just try to take 40 people to KT without the guild falling apart. Anything not in line with that objective is just being too casual to make it.
---
[You're about 3 hours too late my dude](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8pwfh/oceanic_wow_classic_realms/esompmh/).
---
Besides, the moment they announced German and French realms, [I flipped on my opinion hard](https://redd.it/c8m8e3).
---
It was all about the numbers and trying to understand Blizzard's decision not to give language specific realms, nothing personal.
---
I'm honestly barely even worried about my DPS at all. Getting into groups is the only thing that worries me.
---
Nobody is saying that they will be top DPS all the time on every single fight. I'm saying that they are capable of doing competitive DPS while providing utility. Even with the correct values, which we don't know as we've only seen them up to level 40 and have no idea what sort of diminishing returns classic WoW might have on the scaling past level 40 (if its anything like base stat scaling, the discrepancy will decrease the closer you get to level 60) the difference will not be huge enough to cause a significant difference in the overall DPS.
---
What I like to do is wait until I'm done questing in STV or Ashenvale, then hit the AH. Sell all my extras and buy whatever I still need, then turn in the quest.
---
The quests really aren't bad, they just take up a lot of bag space at a time when bag space is typically very limited.

Tauren or Troll Warrior for someone whose main goal is just to tank 5/10 man dungeons and do a bit of BG PvP. 
---
Probably don’t have the time commitment to raid.
---
I can hear the replies to this comment.
---
Like in reposted again.
---
There are a lot of things in vanilla that could be changed for the overall benefit of the game. None of them are being changed. Leeway is no exception.
---
I cross-posted it there about 2 hours ago. Not a single vote. =(
---
Furious Howl for your melee boys?
---
&gt; Private server parses when compared to other private server parses are 100% accurate. Thats because any discrepancies on the private server end that inflate or deflate DPS are affecting both the classes being compared. It's not like we're comparing Vanilla parses to Private server parses.

Oh I hadn’t seen it here yet, but with 17 mil views on YouTube chances were pretty big someone else felt the same nostalgia. Sorry for the repost.
---
I forgot Ony got killed by 4 people. Now I remember watching that
---
That’s an assumption on your part.. I actually logged into it after having started in the Draenei zone on a BC server and being pretty convinced I’d never be able to grind it out on Classic these days - that’s why I went to an instant 60 classic server. I had quite a shit outlook toward it at the time. I really don’t think that perspective applies to me at the time of entering this vanilla server. I was caught off guard and mesmerized by what I was seeing. I couldn’t figure out why it looked so good.. it made me more optimistic for Classic.
---
Even running around on a mount the city feel bigger compared to if you're used to hopping on a flying mount and going from Stormwind Keep to the Cathedral in 8 seconds flat.
---
Ehhh as someone who played OSRS they added some fucked up shit. You could afk overnight and get max melee stats in like a few weeks. That plus the snake boss ruining the economy.
---
&gt; mind you that subscription for retail wow dipped below 1 million worldwide!
---
where are you getting those numbers from?
---
My friend, this is the internet - obnoxious people telling people how to think are always more common than normal people who don’t care how anyone else thinks. Just the nature of the personality types, you know? Of course most people think you should do what’s best for yourself! Only takes a handful of loudmouths to fill up a subreddit though.
---
I played a balance druid and a ret paladin. I often got shit but had a ton of fun and did well in pvp
---
&gt;Though, I wouldn't be surprised if he holds both titles. ;)
---
I would since he will do it solo and that doesn't really work
---
'Seeing a flagged horde on a PVE server is like Christmas' 
---
Wow, I really forgot about this point, having played pvp servers for so many years, but I started on PVE and you are so right, seeing a flagged enemy was so exciting! Or if you saw an enemy while out questing and turn on pvp to challenge them to a dual to the death! 
---
I'm still gonna roll pvp but this almost made me reconsider for a moment :P great post really reminded me of some important benefits of PVE I had forgotten about.
---
Probably not
---
1.12 was one of the weaker patches for hunters. So they won't be the fotm class but will be playable. If you think melee leeway will break the class you should probably play something else. There's still many things that could be bugged with hunters besides that but for all we know some or most of it could be how it was in 1.12. But they clearly were playable then.

Probably tauren for war stomp
---
Min max is not required. Getting 40 people to show up and pay attention to mechanics is.
---
Like a shotgun to the foot
---
By good I also meant choosing good classes / roles. If you want to get into a guild that runs an efficient raid, you can't expect them to all have the good classes and roles and you roll up with an oomkin, no consumes and expect them to take you.
---
[Yeah, toilet paper doesn't do shit for shit](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xyyqk7/lets-be-real-americans-are-walking-around-with-dirty-anuses). Bidet masterrace. 90% of homes across in Italy, Spain and Greece have them. I installed one about a year ago. Can't shit without it now.

I won't be surprised if the next stress test (all US and EU accounts) is kept open for a week.
---
I dont. I dont even know how to get it other than its one of the panda reps
---
Cosmetics MTX should only exist in free to play games (see PoE, LoL).
---
Leeway doesn't change their minimum shooting range at all, though.
---
Ah.. you can enter that way?  I never knew!
---
I have to say, as someone who played on OG launch, and who still hasn't made up their mind about layering yet, you're really making me want to support the other guy's point of view. You really do sound like all the entitled, pompous bfa players. None of what you're saying makes any sense. You really truly sound like you just want to play bfa with a classic wow reskin.
---
I am torn between undead and gnome. I love the look of both and motivate to take the character to level 60. Now the question is whether I roll warrior or mage
---
Tauren for warstomp and increased meele range
---
Peek advantage in CSGO is a perfect example of how something clearly favoring one side does not ruin a game.
---
Dat escalated quickly
---
Well, we used to have battle groups so it was still cross server to an extent.
---
I think he’s looking for an answer, not for someone to repeat his question.
---
You can actually get the position of players in your party/raid with the [UnitPosition](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_UnitPosition) API function, so it's actually very easy to calculate the exact range in that case. Unfortunately you're right that it doesn't work on enemy targets outside your group though. You could only use it while dueling.
---
This is like saying that old MS-DOS games should be unplayable because their framerate was tied to the various (slow) processor speeds at the time, lol.
---
Gotta pickpocket stuff in AV
---
Not quite. I level alts still that are glued to the ground in BFA. I think you guys are missing what I’m saying, or this private server has something wrong with it lmao.
---
oh but this time we know better!
---
Im so glad to be getting a second chance
---
Welcome to the proper side brother
---
Yes. With this knowledge that we have now about how the game was. Are we able to use privateserver strategies, which we used for years. Correct, you are able to read 👍🏼
---
Ret is viable in pvp, it’s a proc (luck) based spec. Not very good in pve unfortunately and you need to raid to get good gear unless you’re gonna nolife pvp rank.

Easily over 1000g

I've been collecting their data ever since Classic was released. It's not perfectly accurate, so I usually don't quote the raw numbers, just percentages, but it's by far the best we have.
---
that was levels 1-6 this is part 2 levels 6-10
---
Again, that is why I said I don't care one way or the other about Blizzard, I was specifically only talking about bands and smaller companies that deserve your money.

Rule nr #9 in the guild I am in for Classic, Kor Kron Vanguards: 
---
&gt;**Always defend your guild mates, always protect our cities.**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If you're not in a dungeon, you come to defend your capital if it's under attack. If you see your guild mates fighting the Alliance, you join them.
---
I know about glancing blows, and I also know that instead of going swords, daggers is not at all far behind as long as you have aged core leather gloves, and is overall geared for it. Seal fate dagger with enough crit chance has the highest potential dps of any build of any class. The racial bonus is not as noteworthy as you’re making it out to be.

I would support this but the no changes crowd shall be here soon to squish us
---
Did you read anything I said or did you just copy paste your other comment?
---
I wonder how many original Vanilla players will return for this.
---
Same way as a child, my childhood house looked larger to me. I guess it's all in how you remember it.
---
Grab one of the crafted 2 Handers that has stun built in and go to town. I believe that'll be far more efficient than dualwielding, especially since dual wield Arms is... questionable I reckon.
---
Honestly not sure those are worth grinding to finish also my bag hurts every time I quest in strangle thorn because I’m getting 8 of the same page

Well he had worlds fastest, not world first as far as I know so why should'nt that be possible again?
---
Prepare for posts like this: "An essay on why I think I should have gotten to be part of the beta"
---
People would vote on this matter how it suits their interests. Ranges will vote to abandon it. Melees will vote to keep it. Absolutely impossible to get unbiased results.

Upvoted for calling it VC, downvoted for thinking it’s anything otherwise.

Nah. #nochanges

Is this your second account? Or did you just need to copy/paste someone else's post into yours?
---
It most likely would help. But classic isn't a project to "fix" vanilla. It's to recreate it.
---
Wow this seems off haha 
---
Regular mount is at lvl 40 for instance, and is 100gp(not 5)
---
And I don’t know about the buying gear stuff, maybe if you are good at getting gold via farming or the auction house, but you will need every last piece of copper as a new player for your mount(unless you roll a paladin or warlock I guess?)
---
Tldr; no. This is not accurate.
---
Yea I'm really curious the direction they go lol.
---
You needn't spend that much for a good MMORPG mouse - Logitech's G600 has served me well for many years. They're really useful, the 12 buttons get used a lot on MMORPGs for me and some of them are used for a few other games as well.
---
God damn it now I can't unsee this.
---
Rofl get rekt nerd no try hard premaids farming everyone all day boohoo gtfo and roll alliance
---
So many items I thought were useless had some really important use and I found that out long after I vendored them.
---
It's not just man paladins!  Female paladins have them too!
---
I thought that walking around stealthed is the normal way of moving for a rogue :)
---
Imagine walking instead of running for 10 levels - thats how this felt...
---
Sorry but this is just bullshit. Even if this works as intended, this has to be fixed. 
---
This is NOT Vanilla-like. 
---
I remember countless occasions where I stood right behind someone, trying to melee attack but it told me that I’m “too far away” (I even have that human voice telling me that stud in my head I realize). 
---
Blizz, no. This has to be tweaked.
---
Dude you revealed your hand, not gonna bait me in again.
---
kek
---
Retail is a very *different* game, but it's not a bad game. I quite enjoy it. Mostly for different reasons than I enjoyed Vanilla through WotLK, but a lot of it is still pretty fucking great. You can never please everyone 100% with a video game of any genre, it's just not possible.
---
I think lore-wise that's right, but really it's more like "she's evil now, you can tell because hair."
---
Oh no! you´ve got me figured all out, I´m a con artist! it´s not like it´s a random image I took during gameplay because I was having... fun? And maybe we marked mobs because there were tons of other players in the area and we had to co-ordinate? And my deepest apologies for doing a lvl 10 quest at lvl 7, someone not doing as they´re *supposed to?* in Classic?! O! The Horror!
---
Fantastic news! So glad I won’t have to worry about having to deal with Americans now
---
This makes me more excited to play Hunter tbh. Bring on the extra challenge. Good Hunter players will stand out even more now. Let’s get it!!
---
Or both!
---
&gt; In any case, I highly doubt it will "settle down" enough for them to remove layering.
---
.... what? Why? What are you basing this strange assumption on?
---
They can surely make realm transfers if more people stay than expected.
---
They’ve CLEARLY expressed that they don’t like any type of layering and want to avoid it at all costs. They’re on your side
---
I played Vanilla from day one, raided 90% of the content, made Rank 10, and the first time I've ever heard about Melee Leeway was from "Beta Buzzword Wednesday, brought to you by Billy Beta"
---
There are so many non-issues people are bitching about.
---
Don't make me cry. I was well with the head of the curve so when I got it at like lvl5x in felwood nobody had 1000g. But 15 certainly didn't cut it
---
I'm pretty sure developers can load up quests and do them without having the beta up. They will probably internally test the rest of stuff.
---
Holy shit dude you've commented in this thread over 30 times, almost always being a dick about being "right" or whatever, shove it
---
And they moved a week so you have to resign again if you want in lol
---
No matter what anyone says. This IS a Vanilla Mage kiting on the ACTUAL servers
---

---
He's literally standing next to monsters and avoiding being hit from a very short distance. Yet in the beta mobs have like 10yd melee range. So it is pretty ridiculous regardless of what is being stated.
---
Lol how many pollocks does it take to down a raid boss
---
&gt;It can stand to improve and adjust over time
---
It's almost like that is what WoW has always done and is the direct result of BFA.
---
Everything in wow has the same value cause it’s wow, silly buns:)
---
The odds of not being in the same batch get slimmer and slimmer as your timing improves. At 1-2ms you'd be basically guaranteed to hit it. At 50ms you'd still be basically guaranteed to get in the same batch (you'd have to be 0.05s from the batch end to fail). 
---
If you time it at a tenth of a second, which everyone can do, it isn't "sheer luck" to get into the batch, it's actually quite unlucky if you didn't since the odds are so high.
---
Which ones have been made already? Anyway, thos is great, thanks!
---
She got her ass handed to her in the 5-mans. It's reasonable to assume she was off licking her wounds during the raid.
---
&gt;long weekend
---
It’s not a long weekend here, so that won’t affect our news cycle
---
See, for some reason ... Tin-foil hat time?
---
That actually makes me think that they're considering fixing it, so as not to make Grand Marshals miserable twice.
---
... &gt; . &gt;
---
They're not useless, but for more casual players it affects them a lot more frequently.
---
I could just be confused, but do a lot of people really have their second monitor in a vertical position? Every one of these leveling reference wallpapers seems to be vertical and I've never once felt the need to turn my turn monitor vertical lol. I feel like it would look worse and not really gain much
---
well yeah unless other wise specified a lot of folks are talking about strictly raiding
---
the meme specs are meme for raiding
---
they have their role in game however, Boomkin and ele shammys can blow your ass up fast
---
Ret is close to unkillable (druids kinda can be too) 
---
Shadow can really wreck your dad especally 1v1
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSd6-EvBgN4
---
&gt; Taunt isn't solely a QoL improvement
---
This isn't either....
---
Your whole rotation is keeping buffs active, and using 1 dps cooldown for a while. There is more you can do but it isn't really worth it mana wise.
---
IMO all the classes are pretty boring in the open world outside of PVP or shit hitting the fan situations like if you accidentally pull 3 mobs at once.
---
Lmao. Ok retard.
---
wow!  "Traveling with aspect of the cheetah (with 2/2 pathfinding talent) is faster than mounting up (with lvl 40 mount) and moving with the mount for the first 25 seconds. After 25 seconds the mount becomes faster."  &lt;--- is that correct/accurate?
---
For me tanking is less about the rotation and more about the thrill, I think it's the only 'thrilling' role in PvE - and it's the fact that I can build a hybrid spec that allows me to level, PvP and PvE in bear and cat form.
---
Feral in PVP I find really fun, but my fears of it becoming a bit too try-hard might get tiresome. It's about stealthing in cat, getting a sick opener with some DOTS followed by caster DOTS / control / long-range attacks mixed with bear form too, crit is an isue since I'd rather have str gear where possible, and yeah you can't last too long without going OOM, especially because I prefer Nature's Swiftness so can't take the talent to reduce form shifting. 
---
Having said that, a balance/feral hybrid is pretty fun too, just less survivable.
---
I agree, the biggest problem is gearing, but you can weapon switch with macros when entering different forms no? 
---
But yeah, it's a big kiting class rather than a stand-and-bang type class, which is why sometimes I feel like "uh I should just play rogue" or "uh i should just play warlock" -&gt; but it is still fun being able to do everything even if not the best.
---
This does make me lean heavily towards having a main and a druid alt, but then the problem is if I am having an alt anyway I can afford to have two characters that specialise or one specialist and one hybrid (i.e. rogue / priest) but then miss out on tanking (because I hate warriors). 
---
See why I'm conflicted?
---
resets are perfectly valid tactic against a class that can't gap close well.
---
:(
---
Tons of experience for not really that much effort.
---
Wouldn't Perplexity an EMEA player have high latency on the beta which IIRC is US based? Wouldn't that high latency give him more range? Where as myself US based on an US server would have much lower latency and as a result a lower range?
---
I thought leeway only kicked in during PvP?
---
The world became way too safe, and it was a low pop srv as well.
---
They definitely are.
---
Lol why do you care?
---
This is not how it worked in classic.
---
Play what you want to play and have her play what she wants to play.
---
Serpent sting is a waste of mana and arcane shot's scaling is bad past 30. May want to rethink the shot rotation you have here.
---
I could see them changing batch windows to like 200 or something maybe, but I don’t think leeway is getting changed.
---
Maybe I missed it, but did you mention the experience lost on death?  So if you weren't sufficiently leveled into the max level and you died you could lose a level and have to grind again to get it back.
---
That you can purchase back items you sold to the vendor. (While still logged in) I sold my first rare item I ever got, from a rare elite I killed on my own! Accidentally vendored it then ragequit/logged when I realized what I had done.
---
I never knew that shadowbolt was a skull. All these years. How is that possible?
---
How could I forget RS when it still has such an active community?
---
Now we just need our one RPPvP server per region and we'll be set!
---
Mainly because I'm not a ganker, so it just ends up being an inconvenience. I have less free time to play and don't want to spend it running back to my corpse or retaliating. I also like the convenience of being able to AFK at a moments notice while out farming/leveling.
---
Oh well. Guess I'm not getting in. Thats what I get for playing WoW since 2005.
---
the same argument can be used and was used for spell batching, yet that is wanted
---
to me we shouldn't have one or the other, it's not consistent logic
---
They did kill the Draenei before drinking Mannoroth's blood. The Horde only drank it when they were about to take Shattrath, the Draenei's last bastion.
---
we dont know for sure
---
but... Im guessing they will get thrown in with the rest us...
---
but they did say Kangaroo land is getting their own server or two
---
You’re trolling, right?
---
Melee is broken as fuck in vanilla
---
Anyone know how Tauren cat form is affected by this?
---
Is she evil now? I've been busy burning trees for the other evil lady and didnt notice I guess.
---
Has anyone tested charging through traps and blizzards?
---
&gt;That's not Blizzard's fault, they're still giving you the same experience.
---
Same could be said about people not having good ping in the past, which is why leeway should remain unchanged.
---
I really wonder how people can think the horde iw the "good guys", because the information available makes it very clear that the orcs and forsaken are a very nasty bunch, even the horde biased info
---
Trolls are cool. The fact that they're the least played race in classic makes them cooler.
---
&gt; Layering doesn’t affect the initial rush but the new people here think it does.
---
Except it literally does, but you do you.
---
There isn't a base game for sale anymore. You get the entire game up to but not including the latest expansion just for your subscription. WoW Classic will be included in the subscription.
---
Hell, it's a perfectly valid tactic for *warriors* who want to reset their charges. Any time a mage blinks away from you, just start walking the opposite direction and wait for combat to drop. They're out of range for frostbolt at that point.
---
&gt; 2.7% report less than 3 shits per week    
---
&gt; 60.5% report 3 to 7 shits per week     
---
&gt;     
---
&gt; 32.95% don't shit at the office ever (that's the &lt; 3 shitters and half the large group of shitters)    
---
&gt; 30.25% shit 3 times a week at the office (the other half of the majority)
---
That was a resist as you can see in combat chat as well as his portrait in the top left of the screen

Already sporting a ~30% speed increase early on.
---
Don't forget all the slavery action the horde gets in on!
---
But its not different if you had good ping in the past, so you point is moot.
---
“Melee leeway” is working as intended. After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.

---
Just because you had bad ping doesnt mean everyone did.
---
I'm curious about what will happen to the features from Wrath that everyone playing Classic are playing Classic to escape. Like LFD and raid tiers replacing each other. It'd be really cool to play Wrath without those issues.
---
Think he used to play football but got some kind of injury and now he's a thick boy.
---
More of a joke? Still arguably the best pvp class there is throughout 1-60? Please.
---
I replied to that comment saying I was apparently wrong and I commended that person on their long, thought out response.
---
Really want to play a druid and really want to heal in raids at end game but I keep getting told i'd be really lucky if any guild picked me up for raiding since Druids suck in raids.
---
How true is this? could I raid heal with Druid if I work really hard to gear up for it?

See all those slowed mobs ? Only 2 who are in actual melee range attacks him but if this was the beta the entire pack would attack him.
---
To be fair, 2% is quite a lot when you're trying to get the most you can, stacked with everything else.
---
If I offered you a 2% pay rise this year or let's say, I let you ware your favourite hat at work for the year, what would you choose?
---
But i didnt have bad ping, so this will be closer to the real experience.
---
If they do change it people with bad ping will just get it worse and people with good ping wont get the experience they would have had in the past.
---
No changes.
---
The Exodarians frown upon you, hater of Slayer

Of course I mean for pvp. In pve yeah they suci but that's because they cant use even half of their kits

We never did get that armor set did we...

Depends though, Mage will just as easily be able to cs you into combat.

All well and good, but we actually have proof that they would've become genocidal Invaders without the demon blood now. Look at the events of WoD
---
With $1.8 million, according to the [Trinity Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study) - he should be able to withdraw $72,000 a year for the rest of his life, and never run out.
---
What people say and what people do is two different things. If you look into guild adverts today they still say 'like a family', 'tightly-knit', 'community first' when in reality it's socially retarded, self-serving and disposable. 
---
I wouldn't know why people suddenly behave social just because it's called classic. In my latest travels, people just tried to ninja-invite me, saying little more than 'y', 'n' and 'thx'.
---
Did you mean the node camper crowd?
---
I think it’s funny when these stupid events with already picked players is trolled. It’s only streamers and their friends

It feels off but I am not sure.

136 speed with cheetah, 160 with mount. 24 difference in speed.
---
3 seconds to mount up so that is no movement, 3*136 = 408.
---
408 / 24 = 17. I expect it to take 17 seconds to move faster with mount, but I might be wrong or missed something.
---
Thank the RNG gods this has made my day, ty
---
yes, my ping was low always, fps was trash
---
Im interested in this too. I dont see a reason why leeway would need to exist in a PvE scenario but im seeing a lot of misinformation on if its intended or not.
---
Well I guess I could buy more hats with 2%, but what's the need when I can wear my favorite?
---
I would have named my dick that, but I’m Forsaken, so I’m pretty sure it’s not there anymore.
---
How are they gonna be at high level 60 PvP? For a class that depends on separation this is a huge nerf...
---
And every single one of those shamans decided to become warlocks with the tiniest amount of prodding.
---
I mean, these folks were supposed to be in tune with their ancestors and the elements. When the elements abandoned them because what they were doing was obviously wrong, did they say "hey wait a minute"? No, they all went right to Gulden and became warlocks.
---
That spirit is useful - leveled to 60 as balance Druid only wearing int/sta gear.  I had to drink after every mob I killed...
---
D
---
if they had a brain they wouldve parked some locks around the world (hyjal, mountains, locations where you can fall through the terrain, etc etc) to summon people dueling
---
perp didn't like it one bit
---
Its limitations are that the Arms tree is specifically designed for 2H combat. The annoyance factor of maces would be just that, annoying. You might stun people here and there but you would gimp yourself pretty bad in actually doing any damage, like a mosquito.
---
Get an Unstoppable Force and have fun with mace spec.
---
Did you play on a widescreen or a 4:3 monitor, primarily?  If you played in one of the `(wide)` resolutions, the game was just basically zooming in and chopping the top and bottom of the image off.  This means that a wide screenshot from 1.12 will look zoomed in, and things will appear to be closer to you, when compared to a screenshot from the Classic Beta
---
Oh good. So they acknowledge the mechanic was built for crappy internet and decided to keep it in a time when almost no one has the level of crap we did back then. Ugh.
---
They are already doing shards, so this asinine statement can stop.
---
If I could make all my characters on a server, I would consider paying the subscription early, but for 3 out of my 10 character I sure won't.
---
Sorry, did not notice that (we really need profile pics on Reddit shown when we comment, who has time to read nicknames of people?).
---
no changes, right?
---
Less than 2 weeks is soon
---
I agree! Spell-batching should be removed along with melee leeway. They are “fixes” for the state of computing/internet connections at the time and to keep them in game is anti-Vanilla experience because those mechanisms are now broken.
---
It will be alright if they fix the delay on slows, Ima be full tilt if a meele can just run thru my imp blizzard with no slow and hit me in the race with melee leeway.
---
Huehuehue
---
Hey mate, the show won’t make it to BC, that’s a good 2+ years away if they do it and by that stage the show would have been going nearly 4 years. I don’t think Countdown is a 4 year show. If I do anything after Countdown it wouldn’t be WoW related.
---
Damn...the nostalgia hits me again.
---
They should have limit number of food items a player can use during a match. That said this "tournaments" is NOT good. Zeroed had Blood pact during his duel with Payo &amp; he got healed in the first match, trolls interupting duels essentially wasting players CDs, Esfand making rules on the fly (limit the area in which duels take place).
---
Hey, I just had this tested. When drain soul is used in the following scenarios, here’s what happens
---
1. Pet gets killing blow —&gt; **proc**
---
2. Player’s DoT (any) get killing blow —&gt; **proc**
---
3. Other party member gets killing blow —&gt; **no proc**
---
1. Hard cast Lightning bolt on a soon-to-be-fried Ally. 
---
2. While the bolt is traveling, you're casting Chain Lightning. (Elemental Mastery on this, if you have it.)
---
3. As soon as CL is done. Earth/Frost shock.
---
4. If you have Nature's Swiftness, cast an instant LB here.
---
All 3 (or 4 w/ NS) will hit in less than 1/2 second of each other. If you get 2 crits (One is guaranteed with EM), they're probably dead. If not, you'll probably finish them with another LB cast.
---
"I enjoy playing night elf, but I'm going to sacrifice that because the human will have better stats end game."
---
"I shall sacrifice my enjoyment to get the best stats I can even though it takes the same amount of clicks to make my character."
---
Are you really too stupid to grasp the difference between preferences and people trying to be optimal end game?
---
We didn't start the fire
---
Yea. As a Brazilian, this was Warsong server for us. Idk, I just prefer to play with EU guilds, and some US are ok too. Not that there aren't many good BR ones, but chat is a bit too loud imo.
---
1-40 in 10 mins. That’s can’t be possible. Does they mean the video is 10 mins long?
---
Finding all of the engineering chicken eggs and doing the escort quest. Theres a follow up quest if you do them all. I think theres 3 or 4 of them.. some like the one in Tanaris sucks because it takes you across the whole zone and through some pretty annoying mobs.
---
There's still a bunch of ways you can do stuff like sitting dead until the duel starts and then rezzing and immediately charging/attacking someone right?
---
The hardest part of raiding until ~ Twin Emps is getting 40 people to consistently show up. From that point onward, the raids do legit get tougher.
---
He resisted.
---
The Curse / Twitch app will probably have something like that at launch. Most people are going to publish their addons there anyway.
---
yes you did. Horde took the entire population of stormwind
---
The hope - You and your enemy in the world, suddenly, a herb/quest mob/chest! You fight, win, take your spoils. But now another appears, he saw your victory and will avenge his comrade, alas, you must run from the graveyard. Better luck next time.
---
The reality - 45 minutes wasted while some dickhead terrorises Lakeshire.
---
MC still has Bindings, which many guilds will have by the time Naxx is on farm, but you can always get unlucky. The point is, having cool stuff like this gives people a reason to continue doing lower tier content. The ZG mounts are a similar story.
---
Finally... the little Payo can sleep.
---
No, they had the numbers, they just used the video to show they were getting the same results.
---
The Nost legends. I am so very thankful for these guys. I played on Nost and once I tasted that vanilla again in its (seemingly) true form like that... it was akin to a spiritual awakening in a way. And the feeling I had when it got shut down and how I felt toward Blizzard at the time, signing petitions, and seeing people care so much about this like I did...to how I feel on with the dawn of official classic less than 2 months away...I will ALWAYS have endless love and gratitude for the experience that was Nostalrius and the people behind it. THANK YOU!!
---
A guild friend who played classic back then told me that balance druids were strong in naxx.
---
What an idiot....clearly doesn't played Vanilla or hasn't in 15 years lmfao.
---
Well I don't think the average player takes 10 days any more, maybe back in the old days, these days on xxxxxxx server most people were doing it in 6-7 days on good leveling classes not to mention the 5 day hunter/lock levelers.
---
I see your point though.
---
This is so stupid
---
hopefully all those fucking trash streamers reveal what server they are going on so i can choose around them.
---
&gt; it is likely that the game will be released in a broken and unfinished state
---
Meh I think that's a big reach. Can you list some specifics that you think attribute to an overall broken/unfinished state? I can see the argument for layering which I view as a temporary issue. Interested to see what else people are having issues with

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8tpyk/downranking_heals_as_priest/). 
---
This exactly.  It's a change by omission.  For a lot of players this mechanic didn't cause this kind of apparent behavior in the client 15 years ago.
---
The clips people are sharing of mages trying to kite in the beta are jarring.  I remember watching Faxmonkey's "stupid mage tricks" videos back in original Classic (at least some of which are still on YouTube) and actually doing some of that stuff as a mage in Classic myself.
---
With the old leeway tuning and modern lower internet latency the game is not going to play the same.
---
The solution people are suggesting is doing this inside WSG, try and get everyone together inside a WSG a few hrs before hand. That way nobody can interfere with it. But no these people put it in a contested zone and are shocked it gets griefed. I dont blame the griefer at all, the ones running it have only themselves to blame.
---
Trololololololol
---
Threads like this gotta stop. I suggest you watch the Blizzard Classic Panel Presentation from Blizzcon and then come back and try to imply that they’re possibly gonna screw it up. They have a dedicated team solely working on Classic, and it’s not like the beta hasn’t been overrun with absolute game-breaking bugs. It’s mainly just been little things here and there, and the layering/sharding will be gone by Phase 2 for a smoother launch. I’m not even a Blizz-fanboy or anything and I hate retail WoW, but after playing on pservers in the past and then trying out the previous stress test, the game runs great and it’s the Vanilla WoW you love and know.
---
Italian and Spanish I can understand, Italian even more so than Spanish servers. But Portuguese? For release? Sorry, but that’s stretching it a bit. Even for Spanish and Italian realms I’m not sure whether they would need servers right away, it’s definitely not as clear cut as French and German.
---
&gt; Yeah to me running a meme spec is willfully choosing to do sub par damage and that's not cool.
---
I'm going to be running a guild come launch. Meme specs are welcome, since 40 people is always better than not 40 people. That being said, the contested gear like trinkets, rings, weapons, etc will be prioritized to non meme spec raiders.  I'll never forget a moonkin getting our first neltharian's tear and the riots that ensued. Such a waste.
---
Yeah but the night elves sundered azeroth and siccd the BL on us which is why the orcs showed up with the bloodlust in the first place. But whose keeping score?
---
&gt; It's like a job interview--that guy who's got "self-taught" on his resumé could very well be good enough to do the job, but the employer is always going to pick the guy with the actual diploma. Noone has any obligation to cater to people who voluntarily choose a weak spec. Why should they, unless they know the guy?
---
&gt; 
---
That's why the self taught people need a bit of a portfolio to show off what they are capable of.  Meanwhile the guy with the resume could still suck at practical application.  I do not think this point is as black and white as you try to show.
---
Ah. You're clearly young and in need of examples. Ranged vs Melee is NOT a new thing. Here are many examples of the subject across several games and even different types of media. 
---
Just because you insist that range do not have an inherent advantage over melee does not make it true. This is why melee *always* need some kind of gap closer or some other tool for getting close to people.

Oh of course for bindings/raghammer but the point that I was getting at was shifting up the drop table to favor hybrid specs or buff the drops to still be slightly viable (definitely not a tier up buff).
---
I'm in the same boat. But unfortunately, gotta keep it #nochanges.
---
I would have loved to see them remove the debuff limit too. But eh, no changes is no changes.
---
Were they? I never noticed that... 6/8 of my characters were Troll
---
This was already posted, again lol.
---
except it is as verified by the blue post
---
I have to admit your logic in other threads was starting to make believe we weren’t getting these!
---
Esfand benches 415, he'd crush you. GTFO
---
&gt; I doubt we would ignore anyone who wanna raid as feral for a while.
---
We're the same way. Having a consistent group of 40 is the most important part of building a successful guild.  Once you have the 40 always ready to go, then you can start getting choosy with your raid comps.
---
They should throttle our conections so everyone has base 200 ping, that way we will get the true experience
---
Unfortunately some streamers have said they are not announcing their realm until day 1 or after. Whether this is better for them/their server is debatable.
---
For the Wow: Classic Beta I placed my add-ons in the following folder:
---
C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft_classicbeta\interface\addons
---
sounds prudent
---
Yeah mostly by running fiber backbones to increase bandwidth. ISPs have done routing upgrades but your latency isn’t going to be drastically different. I played CS 1.6 in 2001 which is much more latency dependent and we did fine.
---
I dont think you are following the current events in retail if you think she is “super racist”
---
See but that's just enabling/rewarding bad behavior. Salv sure, but not BoP. Let em burn.
---
you mean when
---
*Stop liking what I don't like!*
---
Willitclassic has 1.12 addons on there that won’t work with Classic WoW, so do your research when you’re on there. I suggest filtering addons by Classic WoW on Curseforge, and checking out the Classic section on WoWInterface.
---
now we need the same for alliance (really like NE female hunters)
---
That's great to hear. I know it sounds lazy, but it's a great way to easily keep all add-ons up to date.
---
Absolutely. I feel like so many specs that are 'viable' but not optimal could become so with gear tailored to their specs. Whether it be through set effect or more hybrid statted gear, it's possible without even having to change the specs/abilities.
---
You will not be lasting in long battles, Ele goes oom faster than any spec I've seen in Vanilla it's only good for burst but has 0 Longevity.
---
So ya it's all the same.
---
It‘s natural in this case. Layering proponents advocated for it ad nauseam. At one point we have argued both sides enough. The majority disagrees with you. Some will downvote.

Nothing says "fair" like maintaining prison camps after the war has ended.

**Tenacious Gamers - NA | Classic | Horde | PvP**
---
https://www.tenaciousgamers.com
---
Guild Master: LoanWolf
---
**WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE TENACIOUS?**
---
Tenacious is a long tenured, multi-platform gaming community of friends and like-minded gamers from around the world. We aspire to be extraordinary, to love our members as people as well as gamers, and to change the world around us. The gaming world knows our name, respects our reputation and our members wear our tag with pride and humility. We are large enough to have a server dominant and guild capped presence in multiple games, yet never so large that we forget our roots, never so large that we don't slow down and get to know our members as friends. We came for the gaming, but we stayed for the remarkable family we found.
---
From the seeds of an idea in 2009 to becoming the premier destination for the multi-core gamer, Tenacious has solidified its reputation as a sanctuary for gamers of all abilities who were looking for something more than 'just a guild'. From the casual to the casually accomplished to the hardest of hardcore, Tenacious offers a gaming experience like no other. No matter your play style or your 'core', you are sure to find a peer group in these halls. Where other guilds and organizations are erected for one game, and die with that game, Tenacious has stood the test of time, bound together by the quality of our members, the friendships we forged and the epic times that we share.
---
We are blessed with an international roster of amazing people, most of whom spend their time together in and out of gaming. We pride ourselves on our commitment to each other, our community service and the rage &amp; drama free gaming environment that we've created. Come as you are, be who you are.
---
**TENACIOUS IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT: CLASSIC**
---
If you’re looking for a guild of adult gamers that understand real life comes first, but doesn’t use that as an excuse to be mediocre gamers - look no further. Tenacious is pushing the limits of what people have come to expect from a casual guild.
---
Being a casual guild - to us, at least - does not mean we do not have goals. It does not mean we do not care about progression. It does not mean we do not try our best. It does mean that we won’t force a certain playstyle or skill requirements, because we understand real life obligations take priority. Because we welcome all kinds of players who want to create friendships and have fun. Because your gear doesn’t define who you are as a friend, or as a guildmate. Because we want you to be in for the long haul.
---
You’ll improve. We’ll improve. We’ll grow and better ourselves together. And make no mistake: When shit needs to get done, we will get it done.
---
In Tenacious, no matter how you come to us, you will progress. You will experience everything the game has to offer. And you will have a blast doing it.
---
**WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT**
---
... Organized, involved leadership
---
... Discord server
---
... Website forums
---
... Active player base
---
... Class mentorship
---
... Community events
---
... And most importantly, a friendly and welcoming group of friends to enjoy this wonderful game (and many more) with
---
Preliminary raid times: 9PM EST (we're still working to figure out what times work best for everyone)
---
Requirements: Open recruitment

Have questions? Feel free to ask them here or shoot @tart#0155, @Averie#0636, or @Misaki#1244 a message on Discord.
---
See you in the game!
---
Sure sure
---
Yeah, the guide definitely isn't the best. I just think credit should be given where it's due is all.
---
People raise this question in regards to flying in BC, but the reality is if they started making changes to those games they would piss off as many people as they pleased. The 'No Changes' mentality runs pretty strong, and some of those changes from the vanilla formula are what made the following expansions what they are.
---
Watch videos of both vanilla and classic.
---
Classic, while having the same numbers, doesn't act the same as Vanilla.
---
Gouge a blink, cleanse a blind, vanish a deathcoil.
---
The range you gain is constant, it doesn't depend on latency. Therefore if the latency is lower, the effect of leeway is significantly more noticeable. Even with 1ms ping, you still get the full leeway range.
---
If anything, lag just did not make the mechanic that apparent. It was a good solution back than for the lacklustre infrastructure, but nowadays it just makes no sense to keep it in.
---
Where did you read this? I used to swap names on alts all the time.
---
I don’t think you understand the meaning of the word “if”.
---
It's important for PVP, and especially so for rogues. I don't have confirmation on this but I highly doubt you could vanish attacks without spell batching like you can in 1.12.
---
They are pretty important.  Inner focus DP is a wicked strong dot that heals you for free, but it otherwise costs a ton of mana and has a 3min cd (thankfully this aligns with IF CD).  Shadowguard can proc blackout stuns and scales a lot better with gear, but you need to re-apply it every 3 hits.
---
Both have their fit in PVP.  In PVE it doesnt really matter, wotf is nice for fear encounter, berserker is nice otherwise, but not hugely important either way.
---
Retail doesn't even have several million subscribers.
---
I'm assuming that extra melee range doesn't apply to shapeshift forms.
---
Arms warrior is probably the closest. Maybe ret paladin but outside of pvp it is considered a meme spec by many so do your research beforehand if you want to go that route.
---
you're dedicated to your trolling, I'll give you that
---
One if the biggest things progression guilds face is the outcry of people when you try and phase MC out of your main raid rotation. Progression can suck, but it's how you get the very best gear. Every single guild I have been a part of on private servers and back in retail had the slew of people wanting to run MC over pushing content in AQ/Naxx.
---
They've promised many thing over the years. I don't really care what they say, I care what they do.
---
What do you think real classic will be like?
---
Expect 50% quits in the first 3 months
---
Gay as fuck
---
I’m detailing out my leveling path.  I’m going to be multiboxing a 5-man group through instances, but I’ve still got to plan out an efficient route for getting to at least 15 to open up all the deadmines quests and then plan out how to pick up the more out of the way dungeon quests like the Wetlands quest that goes to the stockades or all the hinterlands stuff you have to do to get a full Zul’farak clear.
---
Feels &gt; reals.
---
&gt; Inconvenience breeds RP. Want a big world? You need to make it slow to cross and look distant
---
This is clear Mage propaganda everyone!
---
I don't understand why they don't address it. 
---
Apart from external interference - which was to be expected - people were playing fair. Only this duel was... let's say controversial.
---
I'm leaning towards paladin right now. I don't think the fun comes from the moment-to-moment gameplay in Classic anyway.
---
They do have a lot of tricks up their sleaves which I do like. And a free mount!
---
100% this, people still want priests, no matter the race. You'll get an invite even if you're a Nelf
---
you don't have to be dwarf. People don't care except for min/maxing guilds. Classic will have way more casuals than private servers which has a higher concentration of hardcore players who care about racials.
---
I don't think private servers are better but I do share OPs complaint about cross realm BGs. Wish they would have kept it on server like Vanilla.
---
Thought retribution paladin is supposed to have a shield, felt too insecure while using 2H.
---
That's all fine and dandy but to me posts like these just scream "I want to play sub optimal/fun meme specs and nobody should hold it against me" which is perfectly fine so long as come the start of raiding we don't start to get posts where people are complaining about being excluded or forced to raid as a resto shaman instead of Enhancement for example if they want to maintain a regular spot.
---
Just be prepared for the fact that the upper echelon of raiding guilds on your server aren't going to be recruiting moonkins, shadow priests, Ele shamans etc and if you are going to raid as those specs then you will have to be prepared to lower your standards and play with a guild that's at your pace.
---
Bugs in the game is more no-changes than whatever you're advocating for. Relax.
---
A dismally small amount of players will actually make that correct play. Most mages probably won't even have detect magic on their bars. Most of the time they blink -&gt; start casting frostbolt while you walk out of range.
---
I'm not going to pretend this is some secret technique to beat warriors, warriors are heavily disadvantaged against every other class. But casting dispel magic on a warrior who is running out of range of your damage spells to reset/heal/LOS hasn't exactly put you any closer to killing him.
---
Partway through aq40 as a maintank i discovered that you had to train parrying at the class trainer.
---
The "feeling" of vanilla, as you put it, did not include 4k resolution.
---
If you're in the beta or on the next stress test, add these to your config.wtf file
---
    SET lodObjectCullSize "10"
---
    SET lodObjectFadeScale "200"
---
    SET farclip "10000"
---
    SET horizonStart "10000"
---
    SET terrainLodDist "1500"
---
    SET groundEffectDensity "256"
---
    SET groundEffectDist "500"
---
    SET groundEffectFade "500"
---
    SET doodadLodDist "1500"    
---
Be warned, you'll be able to cook a pizza on your CPU, but OH. MY. GOD.
---
I don't think that you need a checklist, just make sure to visit your class trainer regularly, assign your talent points, and keep your weapon up to date.
---
You'll also want to buy a mount at 40, so start saving up that 100g now.
---
Nah I don't do that anymore, it was an interesting challenge at the time. I work in infosec now for a large financial institution so it was all worth it. I genuinely like the game, even if I have reservations about a lot of what's happened since I first left. Right now I'm slowly making my way through wotlk content at my own pace, no more hardcore poopsocking lol.
---
Please tell me what faction are you going so I can camp you.
---
I played druid on horde but because I love the race I am going Tauren again for my warrior this time round. I did consider Orc for the racial but Tauren won out just because I prefer the race.
---
No. Knowing that a client side check exists tells us literally nothing about what goes on on the server side. There could be a different server side check that is more generous to account for lag, or even one that's more strict. We literally don't know and it's not really possible even *to* know without seeing Blizzard's source code.
---
Therefore, knowing that there's a client side check tells us literally nothing about private server behavior versus beta behavior versus 1.12 reference server behavior.
---
Yup.  Thinking of rolling warrior instead of ranged now cuz of this bs
---
Cheers! ty so much
---
Yes they should have the option client side. There is no reason they should not. They already have a classic mode button in there. So they give people certain choices already. Would not have a negative effect on people who do not want them but would be nice for those who do. I don't see the reasoning behind the hate towards the idea from the #nochange crew!
---
Jesus, that triggered a memory.  "ITA??????"  Constantly.
---
Yeah, you can do it if they're on the same account. But if you're using another account to reserve names they will be locked to that account for 90 days after deletion. So reserving names on other accounts for your main is pretty impossible unless you're really patient.
---
Me no get stunned. Me not that kind of orc.
---
Secret cow level
---
They're Italians. They'll get  back to you in a week or three.
---
Hey, just letting you know, I don't see druid in there? But mage is in there twice.
---
I'm in product, not marketing. And while I understand you're being facetious, I'll explain:
---
To be clear here, Product owners (or as Blizzard calls them 'Producers' like Ian, etc) want nothing more than to make the product as enjoyable for the userbase as possible. However, a majority of the time arms are tied when money comes into play. 
---
You're conflating a slip of words by J Allen Brack, which, as I've stated, he was completely correct in thinking, but not saying outloud, with an **entire project being created for a completely different market for a completely different niche.** 
---
However, as I mentioned, the **vast** majority of users, especially redditors lack critical thinking.
---
I dismissed "immersion killing" as an argument because you provided none. You've clearly shown you had no intention of listening to anyone else's opinion though so good job
---
Ahhh makes sense. lol I used to rush praying that the name didn’t get sniped, funny shit.

Their posse will just wait.  It's better for no one, worse for everyone who picked that realm in advance.

Watching Esfand do the interviews is a great piece of content. Unfortunately it's overshadowed by Rich and Asmongold talking way too much which is likely a big reason it took three hours to get two brackets done.
---
You can even hear Esfand try and interject after he previously told them to not do it after every match or something to that effect.
---
No raids? MC and ony?
---
but ok, you do you, Chad.
---
It's the new hot thing /r/classicwow is mad about. Basically allows two moving characters to hit each other from further range. Example with fake numbers: guy1 and guy2 are stationary 7 yards away and cannot hit each other. Guy1 and guy2 are both moving and are 9 yards away, and can hit each other.
---
He knew it existed, the other Titans told him azeroth would save them all.

Mounts were very expensive. Didn’t get my lvl 40 one until 55. I was buying so much useless shit on the AH.
---
Bro I saw people straight up demanding spell batching, saying it would ruin Classic if it wasn’t included and that Blizzard better put it in our else the game would die.
---
For people who are already paying to maintain a subscription it's a nice bonus feature. But do you really think your desired names will be in such demand that you'll start a sub 2 weeks before you can play just to make sure you get the names?
---
Just please don't pull an Aaron Swartz on us. That man was brilliant and we lost him far too soon because federal prosecutors wanted to make an example out of him.
---
I think he means no raids while questing :)
---
Let me just jump in to my time machine and check for you.
---
Ok, good point. I’ll go orc warrior and go Tauren shaman. That racial stun is pretty big to get a chain lightning off. Reason I chose orc sham is cuz of the racial buff to increase melee attack power by 25% (but it also reduces healing by 50%). I was planning on playing enhance every now and then but that healing reduction is pretty big for shams and it’s not as important for a warrior so I might just go orc warrior and Tauren sham.
---
Please dont spam the thread if you have nothing to add to the topic.
---
I believe it's normal.
---
Very low quality bait.
---
I kinda like my clipping and fog. I'm also on a really old computer.
---
i've played on several private servers i quickly came to realize that each of them had vastly different views of Classic
---
now i only play on the one that doesn't allude to being classic
---
Way to not bothering to read anything I wrote..
---
Cool, thank you :)
---
I didnt equip a single soulbounding item becouse i thought it would bind to my char forever. I tryed to equip one on my rogue one time, and was totaly amazed that it didnt stick to me xD. I was level 28....
---
Since you've framed the question in such a positive light I'm looking forward to the wild speculation and doomsday predictions.
---
"You honor... He's leading the witness."
---
&gt; Do you not understand that Latency, ping and a few other factors are coming into play.
---
Latency has not been improved a whole lot since those times, games like quake and CS are shooters which rely on good ping, how do you think people where able to play those?
---
So I dont get your point, melee leeway was the same in the past if you didnt have shit internet.
---
Jesus that is so bad
---
No, it isn't Blizzard. Not even close. You could not hit people from 20 yards away in Vanilla.
---
Isn't that just common sense though?
---
idk, this seems like bait.
---
STFU Karen !
---
I agree. I wish I was able to pick what is was for a complete classic theme.
---
Part of the function of layers is to overstock a realm at launch to prevent the need to merge realms later.
---
Females have better beards imo
---
I agree. It either needs to be removed completely or tuned way down. The combat is way too clunky and damage popping up after the mob is dead is not vanilla.
---
&gt;  they’ll have 100 people following them day one
---
No part of their plan is going to keep this from happening anyway.
---
Detect doesn't trigger combat
---
Well, the minimum amount of Layers per realm is 4 right? (2 for each continent).
---
So that suggests 75% will need to drop out within the first 2 months.
---
Someone make a post about layering so we can upvote it. I don’t care if it takes me a week to get to level 10 from server overpopulation. What a unique experience it will be!
---
Yeah, there are many changes that I'd personally find to be an improvement, but if you are open to some changes you lose the right to complain about changes whatsoever.
---
I like the idea of spellbatching and being able to skillfully use it to your advantage, but sounds like it has a too big frame, making it an unenjoyable mechanic. And yes, no debuff limit would be nice too.
---
You won’t have any problem when the honor system is patched in. People will be going to hillsbrad and south shore and flagging to engage in a never ending back and forth stalemate between tarren mill and south shore.
---
Because it doesn't put you in combat, which is why you have to cs.
---
Which bugs and other issues can you point to, or are you parroting what certain content creators have said?
---
Even if Classic launched with bugs, it'd still be less buggy than a private server and the vast majority of players won't care enough to swap to a private server.
---
Cause you can’t filter by client version still, it’s not specific enough. I’d love for it to be able to sort by Vanilla WoW 1.12.1 and then Classic WoW 1.13.x. I’m actually an addon dev, so I’m pretty knowledgeable on this stuff. 
---
Feel free to check out my Github: https://github.com/shoestare
---
What could I even possibly be trolling about? I mean seriously, you can take a couple seconds to at least answer that instead of saying "lol troll" repeatedly. Is this your response for anyone who asks you for your opinion? If I was trolling, I'd be doing a really shit job at it.
---
or they are fixes for you wanting to play Hunter?
---
I learned that RP servers sometimes have chat out-of-character after I accidentally got a boyfriend.
---
Been great tournament thus far, but its such a shame there are so many grievers...
---
Most people who will quit will be at 60 when they realize the endgame is mediocre at best and everyone raidlogs.
---
I have heaps more memory than 2005. 16 GB is pretty standard these days.
---
woke melby boi here
---
My problem is do I reserve my mains name 3x across 3 servers or 3 names I plan to use for my main and alts on one server. I suppose I should get serious about finding a guild to main tank for before they announce server names.
---
He doesn't have to set the record on the first try. He'll have plenty of time to refine 40-60.
---
Please don't spam the subreddit if you have nothing to add.
---
Dude trust me on this: the most hardcore vanila players you can find, are ALL going to play a meme spec/build xD
---
Why would anyone want spell batching? I don’t understand
---
the people interfering are really ruining the fun of the tourney
---
Please link me to any WillItClassic addon labeled "Updated" (Orange Background) that is made for Vanilla 1.12.1 isntead of Classic 1.13.X.
---
His world record was on a fresh server so in a way it was also a world first.
---
night elves make way more sense then any other race, night elves wouldn't be neutral because orcs kinda killed their demigod and deforested all of ashenvale. Humans just kinda farted a little.
---
You can say sure that orcs and humans both helped fight off the legion in the end but, being what happened night elves would be reasonable to go alliance if not just be neutral.
---
If we where to go completely hardcore story, alliance should comprise of dwarves humans and gnomes, horde should be trolls tauren and orcs. Starting selection neutral races would be blood elves, night elves, and forsaken.
---
This would 100% make the ultimate sense
---
I had 50 ping in vanilla, Europe sweden.
---
Didn't they test deviate on beta and it did reduce tauren hitbox if I remember correctly. 
---
Both NE and tauren cat and bear have the same hitbox, that is 100%.
---
&gt; I genuinely want to know. 
---
lol, no you don't.
---
Yes. Mostly torn cause horde so OP in TBC and that was my favorite state of wow. Alliance so strong in classic though.
---
Not using macros. Takes the challenge and fun away imho.
---
People complain to blizzard that they want answers for leeway. Reddit posts come out showing classic code which shows extra leeway range. Blizzard makes a blue post saying it’s working as intended as it did 14 years ago.
---
People still complain. Man don’t play the game if you don’t like it. Problem solved.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot &gt; Questie
---
Yes I do. Stop being an asshole.
---
Battlefront 2 always was a great game that was blasted because of a some memes about loot boxes and hero prices (changed before launch) and loot boxes (never able to be purchased, changed progression 5 months after launch).
---
But the game play was always good. I boot up the game a few times a month, jump in have a blast with friends and that to me is a good game.
---
The developers are people too, and if I see toxic people repeating the same memes over and over and not providing constructive feedback, especially somewhere like reddit which is not the official forums, I am just going to stop reading it. Not worth my time.
---
While I agree with you completely, my point was to refute your statement of learning how to play a hunter well while leveling 1-60 is unrealistic.
---
You don't really learn shit about how to properly do a raid DPS rotation while leveling, on basically any class.  It isn't really apparent, the game has no manual, and you're not always going to find good advice from people in game.  You could be cruising along doing dungeons while leveling to 60, and just by pure chance only ever group with people who suck at DPSing, and so as far as you're aware, you've always been doing good, you've been doing the most damage almost every time, so clearly you must be doing something halfway correctly.  Then you get to 60, and maybe a friend invites you to his guilds raid, because its Classic and they need warm bodies, and all of a sudden you're being smoked by people who aren't even really that much better geared, they just have some semblance of a handle on their rotation in a raid setting.
---
And lets be real, we can hope all day that people read up on how to play their class/spec well before grouping up with other people, but they don't.  Even retail has a literal in game guide for every single boss in every single dungeon and raid, with every ability, what each role should be doing, what each role should look out for, exactly how much damage everything does, etc, and people still manage to fuck up, generally because they never bothered reading up on what to do/how to play.
---
I remember countless occasions where I stood right behind someone, trying to melee attack but it told me that I’m “too far away”
---
Probably rooted/stunnef target or they didnt move.
---
Or just the regular shoddy memory like "damage is too low in dungeons and regen is too high out of combat."
---
Yes, now. Check out vorpX. I got it about a week after I bought the Vive in 2017 and it is ... ok. For some stuff. Takes some work.
---
Beta servers are dead though, no spawn competition
---
What if Blizzard fucks everyone's mom?
---
People say that on here now til they are searching for a lbrs group - or wiping on twin emps for weeks. Trust me those memes specs that everyone keeps talking about will be treated as exactly how they were 15 years ago
---
No, you are.
---
They’re talking to fill in the dead time while they have to deal with the griefing in game.
---
Was thinking the exact same thing
---
Sounds very much like my beginnings. My first character was human paladin. Went through Elwynn and Westfall without knowing about SW. Trained abilities in Goldshire until there were none. Asked people around and they said "in Stormwind". Seems like a 14lvl asking "where is Stormwind" is something not really common in Goldshire (yes they had a good laugh about it).
---
And damn I was stunned when I first entered the city and the classy SW OST played.
---
The way he screams and rages on his stream im totally not surprised he gets griefed
---
Ok tough guy
---
Nzoth fucks over Azeroth and Chromie has to reset time to do it over. Kind of like Majoras Mask where we use that knowledge of the last 15 years to counter the Legion and start a new timeline.
---
In the Lore, Kazzak used an artifact to reopen the Dark portal. In my new Timeline, Karazhan is the next raid after Naxxramas, we go there to retrieve the artifact to reopen Outlands. We go to Outlands and recruit Illidan. Corrupted Ashbringer questline finishes up here to cleanse it. Which then aids in taking down Arthas preemptively, no wasting time with the Tournament
---
Lmao, sure.
---
I think in most situations you're right, but this is clearly a bug that was kept because of the "classic means classic" movement that will hurt the overall experience.
---
Eve it’s not about if it says updated, it’s about it’s lack of specificity when it comes to client version numbers. I already said I don’t like that anyone can post a redirect link without it being approved, and you know my stance on it.
---
Esfand is the only one I watch from that group.
---
Streamers are really just there for entertainment and Esfand does a really damn good job at it. The rest of them are too busy trying to prove to the world that they are the best or they know everything, while Esfand comes up with clever things to entertain his audience with.
---
If I watch you I don’t give a flying fuck if you are good at the game, just entertain me.
---
Details is plural, detail is singular, which is what I said.
---
I'm genuinely surprised that this game still has enough traffic to justify splitting up servers based on language in a specific continent
---
[https://i.imgur.com/voGMGTr.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/voGMGTr.jpg)
---
I doubt shaman can hold aggro. I played a shaman in classic, I never tanked or was asked to tank or saw any other shaman tank, even in dungeons.
---
I find OP's desire to have a large server of 12,000 odd when he doesn't want smaller servers with xrbg because of community. Basically xrbg is like having a 12,000 person server for pvp and a 3,000 server for pve.
---
Yes, to a lot, but to the majority that had a &lt;100 ping back then (AS THE MAJORITY HAD BACK THEN) it WILL feel like classic. There is no winning in this case and its best to give the original gameplay experience to as many players as possible.
---
I'm just realizing that you're not even arguing what I thought you were. This has nothing to do with how many people are in a layer at a time. I literally never brought that up. It's there to smooth out the population of servers at launch, as has been stated plenty of times.
---
*"Layering doesn’t affect the initial rush"*, but you also say, *"Layering only helps with tourist attrition after a month."*
---
If you want to split hairs and play semantics about what the "initial rush" is, then I'm not interested.
---
Fair enough. I've always been the person that looks into theory crafting despite being more of a casual raider. If I'm going to do something, I may as well do it right.
---
&gt;But sure let all the dragonslayers who never wanted vanilla anyway
---
Sound like you are the one who doesnt want vanilla. You dont want leeway to be like it actually was but instead want a pserver remake.
---
No doubt but they really put too much faith in everyone behaving well.
---
If you go into a feral form the deviate effect comes off.
---
&gt; Willitclassic has 1.12 addons on there that won’t work with Classic WoW
---
That's what you said.
---
If you filter to "Updated", which any half-brained ape would know how to do, then what you said is completely and utterly false.
---
I don't have a horse in this race, but schadenfreude so I will deliver a "Ha ha" and cap it off with a good ol' "Ha!"
---
Can anyone do one for horde rogues?
---
No, at the 35 second mark or so.  If you REALLY don’t see anything wrong with it congratulations you’re the only one.
---
You've got the right attitude, unfortunately, not everyone else has that.
---
I think it will help the overall experience
---
they did correct it. stop whining.
---
Takes a bit of time to run there but you can do nearly every quest they can.  There are a few minor issues like needing a trainer, etc.
---
Also, how is a wallpaper more useful than a web page or pdf. I find it more difficult to try and look at my wallpaper than to just switch to some other app/tab.
---
Although, if you are trying to raid without knowing your class or the fights, it doesn't matter what class you choose :)
---
Doesn't matter how many times I've seen it... I have to watch it again
---
How is that a lazy position? This is a Classic WoW sub and the context of the conversation should reflect that. Whatever happened post Classic/Vanilla is irrelevant.
---
Nothing in your post indicates you knew BGs were phase 2, you're just mad someone had to tell you
---
Just watch out for those FD resists :)
---
Combat daggers spec moves to seal of fate spec when you get crit capped with gear in pve. Though in pvp, which is more about control over straight dps, you wont use combat daggers.
---
there are only two types of realms, normal and rp. absolutely no retail servers are officially designated as rp-pvp realms.
---
and, no, i didn't suggest that at all? not sure how you could have misread my post in such a way that you reached that conclusion.
---
given that the original plain rp realms have higher populations relative to the old rp-pvp realms, it's likely that most people who rolled on an rp server at any point in the last year would been drawn to one of the realms that used to be plain rp, even if they may have rolled on an rp-pvp server in the past, because you have the same access to pvp but without playing on a super low pop server.
---
No, I'm not the only one.  Blizzard thinks it's fine too.  There is nothing abnormal about that video.  *EVERYONE* that has ever ran from a mob in WoW has had that experience.
---
Was addressed. Zeroed moved down to lowers, Payo up to winners.
---
I expect a total of 0 tournaments to not have shitshows because no tournament server. A cross faction one? Doubly so, it's doing pretty ok if the alternative is not existing.
---
Would it just be better for me to take the boat there and then meet him in darkshore? or to progress together should i just do my nelf? i want to do both characters but i want one of them to progress pretty much even to him.
---
Nickmage
---
I can't really tell what your question is. But there are differences, especially in being able to get your level 10 class quest.
---
This happened to my druid also. I was like WTF have they done...then I cancelled my subscription.
---
&lt; Never guilty of ganking unless you attacked me first.
---
Maybe somethings shouldn't be on the batch window. and also make the window a bit smaller.
---
I didn't know I had to indicate everything I knew about Classic in all my posts on here, that's my B. I'll start linking you all the blue posts in DMs so you'll know that I know.
---
Faithful recreations. There’s an excellent countdown to classic episode about the issue. Good points there in favor of spell batching.
---
Not at all.  For the Horde all day every day.
---
Though I am considering a PvP realm.  I’ve always played on PvE because I didn’t like being fucked with while leveling.  But I think it’s time I stop being a little bitch and play with the big boys.
---
You need to remember that this is just beta and all the work you put will be gone anyway. Save your energy for the real deal
---
&gt;now we don't have to hear about leeway on this sub anymore.
---
I doubt it, but it's a pleasant thought.
---
you can spam rank 1 lightning bolt to fish for clearcast
---
If i have to get a class quest could i do that quest anywhere or is it usually in a designated area that i do it? 
---
back in classic i only did hunter and that was to get the pet.
---
Alright, yeah definitely. I just remember vanilla pretty well. Would rather have vanilla with better graphics and getting past some of these things that I feel are bugs.
---
You silly Gnome, you have to write upside for them to be able to read it.
---
I found a picture of you
---
https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/13171237?wid=520&amp;hei=520&amp;fmt=pjpeg
---
What downtime should there be? It's not the arena tournament where teams are choosing comps or maps to strategize a counter or rotate players. It's literally lining up two people who are already standing out in the crowd and not waiting on CDs.
---
It's a 3 minute fight followed by 15 minutes of commentary talking about... stuff. 
---
I get why it's taking so long right now because now they're using their Warlocks to mitigate griefing but you can tell Esfand is frustrated when he has to interject and say they've been ready.
---
I'm not so sure about that. I remember well the "I'm too far away" message too but on the other hand if you look at actual videos from Vanilla the leeway is giant :
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucuwa\_S1MrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucuwa_S1MrQ) : at 0:46 UD rogue gouges from hunter's shooting distance.
---
I think loss of players in classic will be more the result of under-development by blizzard, and internal sabotage from envious employees/scared board memebers, rather than fault with the game itself.  
---
Blizzard likes classic, if it's in the context of "People who don't normally play wow are now subbed to play wow".   
---
But, if wow classic is successful, and blizzard's metrics/stats reveal that they are losing money (due to whales who would normally throw hundred dollar bills at blizzard now playing classic, which has no $mtx shop/token), then I can totally see blizzard sidelining it's development in order to ensure a short lifespan.
---
The quest chain is different for each faction - do yourself a favor and google how to get attuned for both MC and Onyxia so you dont have to suffer like I did haha
---
not on paper, that's for sure.
---
The point is it’s 2019 and we don’t have the latency issues we once had.  I never had that significant of an issue kiting mobs on my mage.
---
Play whatever you think you'll enjoy playing with him most, and play the other at your leisure.  It's just up to you for whatever seems fun.
---
It's only that way when he's moving though. A bit later when he's actually aoe farming, it works just the same and he's only hit when he moves in to frost nova all of them, just like the video from vanilla.
---
I’ve been alliance for as long as I’ve played, but my close friend wants for us to raid as horde. I’ll probably end up as horse but I feel bad about it.
---
Not in the beta so I can’t test it myself, but is the idea here that if I strafe while chasing someone as a melee toon,  I’ll hit them from further away? 
---
I suppose this could be somewhat problematic if you’re trying to outrun someone without using some sort of slow/stun, but for the most part I don’t really see this a game breaking issue... sure it may not be ideal in 2019 but mages can still nova/blink out of leeway range, druids can root/travel form, locks/priests can fear and run, etc... just seems like you won’t be able to solely turn and flee without maybe taking an extra hit to the back (again, not ideal, but certainly not the end of the world). 
---
Personally, while I don’t like this mechanic, I don’t think it’s as big an issue as people are trying to make it out to be.
---
I don't think any game ever has had 50% of the playerbase reach max level. I bet on average about 1% of WoW players reach max level. Clearly pulled that number out of my ass and didn't even bother polishing it before presenting it here but I'd be interested to see the actual numbers
---
You typically pick the first class quest up in your actual starting zone.
---
Alright thank you!!
---
I read this as "girl" addon. thought we sunk to a new low
---
Alright thank you.
---
At 35 second mark he isn't aoe farming, so it's kind of irrelevant to the question and functionality of aoe farming.
---
Ok edgelord
---
You won’t believe this: Lady Prestor is Onyxia!!
---
This sub asked for this
---
Patience... Discipline...
---
Right, but it’s going to be the same thing when he is farming.  He used a single mob to show it more clearly.  Not sure how that’s lost on you.
---
Except that you're altering the experience for people who didn't have this mythical 500 ping that everyone seems to think was the norm in 2005 (it wasn't).  
---
If you remove it you alter the experience for some, if you leave it, you alter the experience for others. If you want #nochanges then you leave it in.
---
Got it! I will research
---
The point is it's accurate to the way Vanilla was.  I still don't see anything wrong with that video.  It looks normal.  Shit would hit you from far away as you ran from it all the time.  That's how it worked.  You'd hear the thunk of their final hit and they'd already be turned and running back to their spawn point.  That's just how it is, and that's not wrong or broken.  That's the game.
---
Feral's are different because they are viable, they are definitely not a meme spec.
---
a guilds discord here https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq
---
+ the reddit one on the side bar
---
then healthcare
---
The elements of the game is what's fun.
---
What's not fun is what you are seeing on the screen doesn't make visual sense. Standing next to enemies but the game says you are too far away to hit them, standing far away and being able to someone running away like that tauren video.
---
&gt; and, no, i didn't suggest that at all?
---
Okay, then we agree that the realm populations didn't really change during the removal of the text designation for PVP and RP-PVP.
---
And since we still know what realms *were* RP-PVP, we know roughly how many people that chose RP-PVP still play.
---
&gt; it's likely that most people who rolled on an rp server at any point in the last year would been drawn to one of the realms that used to be plain rp, even if they may have rolled on an rp-pvp server in the past, because you have the same access to pvp but without playing on a super low pop server.
---
I'll grant you this, but would argue that the subscriber drop-off over the current lifetime of BFA suggests that the number of people influencing RP vs RP-PVP realm metrics is bordering on insignificant.
---
Bruh what is wrong with you lmao
---
Don't know shit, don't talk. :) https://youtu.be/zZjiybntLic
---
How about RP-PVP servers now?
---
Aye, a Gigabyte/Mega/Kilo are 1000s to keep inline with scientific convention whereas the typical computer convention of 1024 are Gibi/Mebi/Kibi
---
/r/agedlikemilk/
---
Ha you even deleted all your posts. What a sook.
---
Uh you dont realize how different wars were in early patches. No shield slam period, no bloodthirst either. 
---
That's why the world first nef kill tank was MS. There was no other option for decent threat.
---
&gt;GB always means gigabyte, otherwise it would say GiB
---
If you're using Mac or Linux. But Windows still says GB when it means GiB. https://youtu.be/zZjiybntLic
---
Your question basically boils down to this: "Can I go to another starting zone and level"  
---
The answer is **yes.**  
---
There are a couple minor quests in each starting zone / following zone that are race specific, but they're so tiny you won't even notice them.  
---
*There are some questions you might ask yourself though:*  
---
**Do I want to spend as much time playing with my friend as possible, and thus join him ASAP?**  
---
**Do I want to maximize my Night Elf reputation, and thus avoid missing any NE quests?**  
---
**Do I want to be a bit more powerful before going to the NE zones since I will not have access to a warlock trainer?**  
---
Depending on your answer to each of these questions, different strategies can be formed.
---
I'll check it out, because I like that show, but I would prefer an improved classic and not a "these bugs are there so let's add them back" I mean why start at 1.12 if getting bugs out was a bad thing?
---
Damn I forgot how crippling patches were
---
Could be--I'm just starting 8.2. Without spoiling anything is there something besides her just being "grr the Horde are jerks?"
---
How is this lost on you.  It wasn’t as crystal clear as it is now because there was much more delay due to latency.  That range is obnoxious like I said.  I didn’t say it wasn’t blizzlike.  Whatever it will get tuned and then we won’t have this obnoxious problem.
---
r/agedlikemilk/
---
How do ya feel about your previous logic now?
---
Yes, it's now "hmm, maybe we fucked up by going all 'grr the Horde are jerks' all the time"
---
Ty!
---
Paying a $15 sub to reserve names. Yikes
---
Thanks for this.
---
Awesome thx!
---
Yes, that's the reason.  
---
Here is what I would do if I were in your position:  
---
Immediately upon entering the world, go to your warlock trainer and pick up the quest to start your Imp, which is available at level 1.  
---
Do the imp quest. It will be slightly more difficult at level 1 but it's not impossible (i've done it on the beta at level 1) by the time you get it done, you'll have the 10 copper necessary to buy Immolate which is available at level 1. Grab that and go meet up with your friend.  
---
You can do the entire starting zone with your friend without training, he'll just have to carry you a bit.
---
It's red from the blood of our enemies
---
Maybe against hunters. Not exactly sure why you would just give a rogue an opener on a hunter tho.
---
That's why they said "larger gap".
---
Level to 5 in Dun Morough. Grab mining and go grab some ore and smelt it. Sell on AH. Go to gunsmith in Ironforge and grab the lvl 9 gun. If you grind some more ore you can buy the lvl 16 gun as well.
---
Head to Teldrassil and level up. You should be good until level 20.
---
Got them longhorn arms ofc!
---
Your loss then. I guess you knew you were spouting bullshit when you said "The problems that exist with layering are bugs because they allow unintended things to happen." Instead of backing it up, you just turned into a troll.
---
You can heal fine up to 60, maybe 55 as shadow. Wand spec from disc is always good but likely less needed in a group.
---
To be perfectly honest holy has some good damage, holy fire is actually the best damage for mana ratio priest has, so if you are 5 Manning and dungeoning a lot maybe just go holy?
---
One thing I would say is go arms on your warrior, fury warrior is very like a rogue, yeah it doesn't have stealth but I think it's more fun than rogue for pve damage. If you like the dual wield playstyle of fury maybe a rogue wouldn't hurt but it could be good to try other styles of play out. Mage or warlock maybe? Possibly hunter?
---
My picks for new to wow are warlock (room for high skill but the floor is lower,great solo and a free mount) and hunter, insane solo.
---
Thank you very much. I will keep that plan for when classic drops. For the trainer, are all the class specific quests for learning new summons?
---
Shams don't get plate. You cannot tank as you get close to 60.
---
Warriors require less gear and time to tank than druids or paladins due to their innate better skills.
---
Roll a warrior - there will be a ton, but not many prot wars. There is always a gap in tanks and people who play them.
---
Once you get windfury on your side you'll wonder why you ever rolled alliance
---
I mean, I guess come back when you have something.
---
Alliance doesn't have windfury though
---
Try playing a tank in vanilla. And then tell me it's an equal effort.

Greg?

i feel like you've completely moved away from your original point.
---
&gt;There are about 15,000 more active Oceania players than there are active RP-PVP players in the entire world.
---
&gt;But I haven't heard a good argument that any one region or one realm type would be more popular (by margin, not by raw numbers) in Classic than it is in Retail. 
---
classic and retail will draw different groups, and as such, information about past 30 day logins to retail provides us little meaningful information regarding the demand for different realm types in classic.

Who cares though? It's all just fun and games. Stop taking everything so seriously.
---
I love sarcasm. You know what he's saying is a lie because Alliance has paladins are are the true betas
---
Given the context of this thread is around launch, I think he made a pretty reasonable assumption that when you said "after launch" it meant very early on in phase 1 and he was just trying to be helpful.
---
You kid, but it was actually around 70% who quit before level 10.

absolutely ridiculous. Ignoring context is moronic
---
most people don’t have the reaction for that
---
Not being able to spend $15 but going on a subreddit about the game in question. Bigger yikes
---
What the fuck, I played since vanilla and never heard of such stupid etiquette. What do you think Flare/Detection etc are for?
---
Blizzard didn't have the technology to make one number equal another number? Wow, I'm sure happy about the fundamental axioms of mathematics being fucking invented 10 years ago.
---
It's a need to the deadzone if the targets are moving. If you stop moving, because you're snares, it doesn't do anything.
---
Hunters are fucked in Classic. Melee leeway means it's harder to kite. Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap sharing a DR completely neuters your ability to CC. Deadzone actually goes to 11 yrds instead of 8. And feign death doesn't reliably drop combat in PvP, limiting the use of traps and shadowmeld. Add on the fact that we're using the 1.12 pet system, so the cool pets like Lupos and Blind Hunter are garbage now.
---
Really sucks cuz I was gonna main a Hunter. But with all the issues we've seen in the beta I'm seriously inclined to go Rogue. I mean, I might as well since Rogues are a ranged class now apparently, with leeway being as overtuned as it is.
---
I'm not 100% on all the details, but from what I understand:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
When you toggle War Mode on, you are moved to a shard where all the players have it on as well. You have to go back to Stormwind/Orgrimmar to turn War mode off, so it's not like "oh nvm off" on a whim.
---
In the talents tab, there is a dedicated pvp talent tree where you can choose a whole set of special bonuses that only work when you have War Mode on. You also get a 10?-15? % xp buff. From what I hear, that's why most people have it on while leveling, as you are still unlikely to run into people looking for wpvp in lvl 1-100 zones.
---
Not with that attitude!
---
Prot warrior. People saying DPS specs but I figure you are a tank at core.
---
If you need your 2h fix you can tank while levelling as an arm's war, and at max just go PvP sometime as arms.
---
Remember all of this in WotLK, the skill gap for this was just way higher.
---
Divinity 2 original sin
---
Gonna go back to Hunter, what spec was the most viable? BM?
---
Melee leeway isn't a change, it's in vanilla.
---
That would be a different category. Think of it like diablo 2. Each class gets their own set of categories since each class has distinct advantages and disadvantages. There's also a category for 8 player coop.
---
What is good about double blinds besides lols?

You must not be very tired if you keep responding. Funny how you run away from your own opinion when someone calls you out of it.
---
Ya, I've honestly never been a no changes person do to server size problems and internets advments.
---
It’s exactly the same situation, but the technology allows them to be more efficient. You don’t need 100 servers if in 2 months you only will need 25. 
---
I got the original outrage it was abusable and gamebreaking. The ICD introduced due to PvP or node collection fixes the only concerns I had. 
---
Honestly, what can you possibly complain about it?
---
the ultimate jebait would be to have no cap but only 48h duration of the test
---
So by your logic you should not be able to kill hunter/warlock pets?
---
That just sounds insanely inconvenient.
---
Well, ironically looping us back to the original class in question, a hunter is actually a pretty good choice for someone with no idea what they're doing in a raid!  Ranged to stay safe from most melee oriented pitfalls (cleaves, tailswipes), pet to do some damage even while you're cluelessly running around not shooting, feign death when bad things run at you...
---
Kil'jaeden didn't actually disguise himself as a Revered spirit.
---
He just showed up, appearing as he normally did, and claimed to be a Revered spirit. They just took him at his word even though he was telling them to do terrible things. 
---
The only time he disguised himself is when he pretended to be what's his name's dead wife.
---
But all of them had every opportunity to check for themselves up until the demon summoning started.
---
They're either evil, or complete morons. You pick.

I find him to have a lot more social recognition than the others, which translates into very entertaining content.

On my high pop server kelthuzad we had to take turns between guilds on attempts on vael or it would lag and all the guilds would wipe

---
Attempting to simulate ping in and of itself is a change. I never experienced 14 yard melees in classic, but I also had nice internet, so the only time I was spiked was from server lag. I feel like this implementation for the sake of supposed "authenticity" has created more problems than it is worth.
---
"Kaimeneeeee"

I agree, ignoring context is important.

This is a Classic WoW sub.

You’re posting about things that happened post Classic, thus they are out of context.

Those are the stats *before* BFA launched.

Germany EU (total): 192,669
---
Oceania EU (total): 37,291

France EU (total): 37,108
---
English EU RP-PVP: 24,977
---
Italian EU (total): 14,592

Spanish EU (total): 10,726

This suggests that an EU Englsih RP-PVP realm is right around the cut-off for getting a realm.
---
I'm going to go back into the archive even more and see what else I can find.
---
yes!!!
---
For a lot of people returning to vanilla/classic, we have far less time than we previously did. I don't have time to spend an extra hour or two in a raid because people want to go sub-par specs. I'll be going protection, which isn't going to get me epic 2hers and it's not going to help me make money.
---
I do it because that's my role. If you roll a hybrid, you're a healer.
---
Rogues are expected to be combat, if they're not combat then they're simply not useful.
---
Melee range is not a place you want to be as a hunter. Melee classes can and will intentionally try to stay at the 7yd range when in pursuit so you are in range deadzone. Taurens will be able to hit you from ~10yd away.
---
Sure you can hit them as well but unless you're chasing a druid in wsg and are spamming wingclip then the situations where a hunter in benefited in any way is very limited
---
My pleasure - just happy to hear its of use!
---
*dog eat dog

Yes it is, show no mercy in this world.  Camping is annoying but let it serve as a break time.
---
Also pally heals &gt;&gt;&gt; shammy.
---
Whose the dude casting with asmon?
---
Of course not, but everyone is saying specifically "rip hunters" rather than "rip ranged". Which led me to believe there's something specifically bad about hunters.
---
It's their own fault for being weak
---
I have to pay $15 for myself, $15 for my wife and $15 for my wife's boyfriend 😫
---
Just look at his responses, he's just trolling me after realizing his correction didn't correct anything. I'm supposedly "salty" because he made an incorrect assumption. Lmao.
---
They're overreacting.  No one that played a hunter in Vanilla considered this an issue.  It went like this:  "Oh, I have a deadzone.  Ok."  Then you learned to try to stay far away from people, and to use your abilities to get away.  Sometimes I even died in PVP.  IKR?
---
Race has literally nothing to do with anything in this reference image.
---
It's okay buddy, we all make incorrect assumptions sometimes.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/
---
Yeah, what's his name was an idiot who couldn't stop thinking with his dick (or whatever orcs have instead) and doomed his entire race and several others. Its tragic .
---
Or rather, it would've been all what's his name's fault (he's permanently what's his name to me now) if not for the events of WoD. Now we know the orcs are nasty enough to do the same shit without any demonic promoting. Awful writing
---
How much good will that do when you get 1 shotted with windfury?
---
Holy crap, you actually properly responded for the first time in awhile.
---
Anyway, good luck with the trolling, I'm going home now. (just keep in mind that you are hilariously unconvincing)
---
I think you’re wrong here and it’s pretty sinmple. Yes, a layer will have 500 per starting zone csp or whatever still. However, it’s capped. If it was one big server it would be way worse. To say layering does nothing for the initial rush is ridiculous and Blizz hating.
---
Hey there,
---
Druids are great for raids. I mained a resto druid in vanilla and in BC, with about 5000 hours played.
---
As a resto druid, your role is support in raids. You are one of the best support classes - but you are not a "Healer" role. Don't try to sell yourself or play as a pure healer and compete on meters with old/priests. 
---
You heal, for sure. That will be your primary duty, but you'll be expected and able to do much more.
---
Big crit on the tank? No one can respond better or more quickly than you can with a NS healing touch.
---
Tank/Healer/Biggest DPS dies. Battle res them back (can even NS it to make it instant).
---
Main priest running low on mana? Innervate them.
---
Need to top off a few dps but a key healer can't spend the cast time? Toss rejuvs on them while moving around.
---
Tanks taking huge damage? You have some of the highest throughput in the game with regrowth spam (awful efficiency, but you CAN do it if you choose), since it's a fast cast, decent initial heal, and 50% crit chance).
---
If you're a resto druid, know how to play and where you fit in the raid, you'll get invited to every raid on the server. Druids lose potency when there are 4+ on the raid due to HOTs not stacking, but there are typically so few resto druids that you won't have that be a problem.
---
Hope this helps!
---
My post today *before* they announced it:
---
&gt; [Oceania, you can breathe a sigh of relief. If France is getting at least one realm in WoW Classic, it's almost certain you are too.](https://redd.it/c8m8e3)
---
My post right after they announced it:
---
&gt; [I've never been so glad to be so wrong and I don't even play in Oceania. Happy for you guys!](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c8pwfh/oceanic_wow_classic_realms/esompmh/)
---
Better luck next time kid.
---
So you're saying we won't get RP-PVP realms unless we complain more than Germany and France did? I better get on it then!
---
I'm happy for you, sounds like a great gig indeed.
---
before that you'd only hear music in warez installers and keygens haha
---
You're salty because your attitude is nothing but salt. Look at YOUR responses dude
---
I don't understand this post at all.  You say this pserver has Stormwind (or goldshire) look or feel larger?  Compared to retail Stormwind?  View distance is higher?  I'm confused af.
---
You cant dismiss what someone says by calling it a "non descriptive buzzword" and then get pissy how they respond
---
That's such a ridiculous, reductionist take on 10 years of Jaina being fucked over by the Horde.
---
From a mechanical perspective I already love tauren warriors because of thier increased health and war stomp. Also I can't imagine PvP tryhards picking tauren
---
Can anyone read that low Res text?
---
Well you certainly did, I'm not even the only person telling you this
---
Everything that goes to host something in Australia puts it in Sydney, that's where there be big server machines for all.
---
... the guy literally ran through an ability... what are you talking about, it isn't about pace of combat its about basic fundamentals of the game working correctly.
---
and why is that a bad thing? no spellbatching means you need to have actual skill and reaction
---
That's not how I read it. You took it badly and so then he starting winding you up.
---
&gt;  claims **everyone** back than had shitty internet 
---
Lies and misrepresents my post.
---
&gt; Insults peoples IQ 
---
I didn't, it was an open ended idea with 2 outcomes, but I see you gravitated towards one side.
---
&gt; we're talking 2004 
---
that is 15 years ago, that is a long time especially considering the playerbase back then was so young and maybe didn't have access to a high end PC
---
&gt; people want the game to be "faster" 
---
I want it to feel like it did in vanilla, where I could land on the ground as my mage, hear the fall damage voice sound, hit blink, and not take damage. This clips I vaguely remember show people bubbling .2 or .3 seconds before hitting the ground and still getting hit. I just watched a stream last night and a hunter wasn't able to kite around his trap because melee was able to get so close they could actually get swings in. It doesn't feel like vanilla, I could give a shit about the actual tolerances, the code underneath the hood isn't the same as it was, this was part of the code. You should either admit you want it to be different and slower, or admit it needs to be changed, unless you honestly think that it feels the exact same as it was 15 years ago.
---
&gt; Internet speeds did a lot, but many people had decent pings back than.  
---
So the chair is both blue, and not blue simultaneously?
---
&gt; but hardly that much that such a balance mechanic should be forfeited. 
---
We agree here that changing the delay from say .3 seconds to .12 seconds isn't forfeiting the tactic, and so we agree in the end.
---
Perfect. What race?
---
"What was I wrong about?"
---
*Links comment with nothing wrong*
---

---
*Random YouTube Futurama clip*
---
Such salt, much angry
---
But still not influenced by fel in their blood. I just take issue with people acting as if Thrall and Cairnes Horde is the original horde. The horde prior to that were "evil" by our standarss. Just because blizzard wants to retcon that with this lame horde "honor" Doesn't make it true.
---
Using your example. Okay here's the thing, as a hunter the number 1 place you want to be is at ranged and not melee range.
---
So yes as a hunter you can melee the enemy a bit more in your dead zone but so can they and if you want to leave the dead zone then you have to travel further. "Before" you would be out of there melee at 6 yards, that has now been moved to 9 instead.
---
Also the leeway is based on hitboxes. So if you are fighting a tauren there leeway is 10-11 melee range, while yours is max 8. Ie they can hit you while you cannot melee or shot them (In that sweet spot).
---
We had a conversation here, so I replied to you just like I said. I'm glad you've gone around and ate shit everywhere else you posted shit, though.
---
/laugh while I bubble hearth away
---
I never said it’s a bad thing.
---
And that would be a direct balance change (making it harder), so definitely not #NoChanges.
---
Sick burn
---
It didn’t exist in Vanilla and we don’t want it to exist now.
---
&gt; I remember countless occasions where I stood right behind someone, trying to melee attack but it told me that I’m “too far away”
---
&gt; stood right behind someone
---
&gt; stood
---
No, it doesn’t lol. Dude, I can read.
---
lol
---
If you don't get it by now you never will. Continue thinking you're infallible though it makes you easier to laugh at
---
Aye. I understand now. What confused me was people specifically saying "hunters" and not "ranged. This sucks for all ranged.
---
beta move
---
He's practically begging me to admit he's right, are you his alt or something? Dafuq. What am I wound up about?

If you actually watch his video, it has nothing to do with latency, but I'm not sure whether he plays from.  It's absurdly ridiculous.

Did you check if he was getting damage without you hurting him?  
---
There is this trinket which damages you. He might've equipped it couple times to get the lowend damage (100/second) and just owned before I died before the trinket killed you.
---
If you're a serious PvPer... yeah you would.
---
Hunters are more prone to complaining. Just like every weapon is a hunter weapon, every ranged issue is a hunter issue.

That's beside the point

It's not trolling if I'm right

What a tantrum...

My master plan is to log in and reserve my three best friend's character names, keep them hidden for years and watch the anger grow.
---
Or simply sell them off to them for gold and drops in-game lol.
---
Correct.
---
It might be the root cause of your salty attitude
---
&gt;.&lt; the anticipation has taken me to far back.
---
If the dranei looked like the broken...... veeeery few people wouldve played them. Look at female dwarfs! Imagine..... female broken!
---
Youre 100% right and im with you, but i get why they did what they did. I just wish they could really solidify the story, got everyone excited about it, so people would want to follow the lore (moreso than how things turned out). 
---
But hey, thats what happens when you juggle your world, your storytelling, the fans, the shareholders, the tech, etc.
---
I was alliance for all of classic, was planning on going horde but want to play pally soooo
---
I had an argument with him elsewhere, where I said I will reply to his ramblings when they announced a server. So I replied to him just now and he hit me back in like 5 seconds with some snarky-ass reply of links to his comments 3 hours ago and told me "better luck next time, kid". Sore loser.
---
Glad we can agree I was right
---
There's already several changes in the game.
---
Having something in that addresses the state of tech issuss 15 years ago isn't right. They need to cut it right down along with spell batching.
---
That's like treating diplomats from a new country like madmen cos it didn't exist 15 year ago or something, updates like that just make sense.
---
Basically, if its for beneficial reasons outside of "game content" I think it's fine to change. Obviously leeway was only made to facilitate melee being usable in bad net, not designed as some kind of feature to the classes.
---
It is as if Blizzard wants Classic to fail. I understand them, imagine having more people playing classic than their latest products, imagine the message that would send to CEO's and shareholders, their leading dev positions will be at stake.
---
Now imagine when pservers can deliver a closer authentic vanilla experience, with no  leeway or spell batching issues and a multi billion dollar company can't.
---
The weapons
---
"Why do you choose to click Iceblock instead of simply keybinding it?"
---
Beautiful.
---
Yes it does suck for all ranged.
---
Can we get a list going of servers streamers shall play on?
---
Law school taught me to argue the case regardless of whether you want to believe it or not. There was definitely room for argument before today's announcements were made.
---
And see what happened? The moment Blizzard reversed their position on France and Germany, I looked at the numbers and said there has to Oceania realms now.
---
And I was right. You were too, I just didn't want to let opinions dictate my argument like you did.
---
This is why I'm just sitting on my gold on retail rather than buying tokens for game time.  I can just pay for my sub like we all used to, but if I can somehow "legitimately" trade my retail gold for Classic gold, I'd have to actually think about doing it if the conversion wasn't too ludicrous.
---
Honestly, if you like the playstyle just roll with druid. There's always gonna be benefits and drawbacks:
---
Rogues lack healing/utility/support;
---
Warlock wear cloth, need shards, and lack mobility (the only real con imo, warlock are outstanding in general);
---
both classes will suffer from gear competing and so on;
---
the important thing is whether you enjoy the core of it, the rest is lyrics.
---
People want classic with zero bugs? No one cares what they think.
---
Lmao. Looks like I'm dealing with "that" kind of person.
---
Sure, what you're saying makes total sense.
---
Yeah im Greg Street 
---
how did you know?

Only assholes who make dumbass blanket statements and get hella aggro about world buffs.

WF &gt; pally buffs
---
Yiesh. Man I'm not *that* far behind. It was "Jaina's the voice of reason," then Garrosh nuked the shit out of her, so okay that's actually a valid excuse for being mad. But since then it's just her being mad at the entire Horde (plus the Kirin Tor just because she's got a bug up her butt) even though literally all of Azeroth got together to bring Hellscream to justice. Hence why I was wondering if there was *finally* any justifiable excuse for how she's been acting.
---
Make a friend who can throw one up on the AH for you? Lol
---
WASH YER BACK
---
Yep, this is why we're keeping it in despite it being "objectively bad game design" as a philosophy is terrible.
---
Could be any of them. Depends on how I feel that day.
---
Hope you prove me wrong my friend. Take care.
---
It seemed like a pointless argument and I'm bored at work so I just thought I'd interject. 
---
carry on
---
Why would you be for it , you can't play the game because the UI system and backend macro frameworks are like mop era!
---
Really though if your area flooded would you insist on using a bike not a boat because it wasn't flooded yesterday?

It's entirely a thing made to compensate for bad tech back then, not actually designed to be a game feature.

Easily one of my top 5 best gaming experiences. Not to take anything away from WoW, but I can't help but wonder what would've happened if WoW didn't come along and changed the scene and more MMOs took inspiration from the things SWG did so so well.
---
And there are still places/people that will have bad internet connections/computers. The point of classic is for it to be like vanilla. Back then people also had good pings and internet connections. There’s plenty of things that have changed over the past 14 years. Don’t be cherry picking what you want fixed cause you think it’ll make a better experience.
---
FUCKING LOL

Go away.

Nah I stopped replying to him, I'm bored too

If you get impatient with quest givers monologging at you before you can accept a quest, turn on Instant Quest Text.

The future is now old man. But no seriously, most people online nowadays that your talking to on Reddit are not old enough to remember what your talking about. Like the guy before you was saying, many have never heard of everquest (or at the time didn't) and wow was their first mmo and first sub-based game. That's how it was for me.
---
But yeah, super new concept at the time for both games.
---
Honestly that makes it all the funnier to me.  You're a grown ass adult and you're that stunted?  Makes me feel pretty good about my life that despite my flaws, I'm not *that* fucked up.

what kind of guild you looking for?
---
You're just bad at math if you think the numbers check out with that one

Just throwing one more example.

Awesome, sounds like such a fun class to play. Thank you for the info!
---
Reminds of an anime where a gate opens up in modern Tokyo, and a bunch of medieval soldiers and fantasy creatures pour out and massacre civilians. After repelling them, the Japanese forces enter the portal and absolutely wreck their armies with modern weaponry (artillery vs. tight formations, guns vs. shields, aircrafts vs. dragons, etc...).
---
Sadly the story wasn’t that good past this point, but I found the premise pretty interesting and it was basically what would happen in your scenario.
---
Claiming a game isn't intended for something is different than a technology designed for a purpose.
---
There is no time gate on someone enjoying a game, otherwise don't watch any sports...insane argument.
---
OMG SPOLARS
---
Blizzard started getting into this thing were they wanted to make the horde and alliance morally equivalent, while at the same time retconning things in way that the hordes actions were totally indefensible. 
---
It became the stupid mess that current Warcraft Canon is. Plus all the writers using Canon as a weapon trying to push their vision of things. 
---
At the current juncture, it's impossible to view the orcs as good guys if you take everything into account. The only thing they have in their court is blizzard basically saying they're not bad. 
---
I miss back when you could actually make a legitimate argument that the orcs were victims. They used to be decent folk.
---
This is too relatable.
---

I read that as Chris Rock. And thought it weird that you called him Christian

Is $15 2 weeks earlier that big of a deal?  We're all gonna be paying it anyway come the 26/27th.

When is this duel tournament supposed to happen anyways? They've been talking about hosting one for over a week now.
---
Those parts deal with the Draenei genocide, yes. The parts about "it has always been so with my kind" and "centuries of violence and warfare" that I cited are hardly Kil'jaeden's fault, though.
---
Who's we? It's fine if you don't care, thanks for commenting.

WF is better at the start but Kings outscales it later on iirc

If you visit the Classic WoW Discord we will be sorting stuff like that out closer to the time! :).

Imo having the last “OG” paladin (considering Turalyon was believed dead/MIA) be the one ending Arthas was the most fitting way. I would’ve liked to see Jaina or Sylv (respectively) help out in the fight though.

Hoping for at least a few days of open beta to set up my macros and addons.
---
Would be pretty unfair to give people access to actually play the beta and give these people the opportunity to set themselves for the release while people without beta access would have to decide if they want to start playing without properly set up addons and macros or if they want to waste time at the beginning instead of leveling.

Could I get a link on how to do this! Been very interested in running my own server to goof around in
---
Welcome to World of Warcraft. 
---
Are you on a pvp server? No holds barred baby
---
Sounds like a good idea. I probably had 40 characters spread out across multiple servers that never made it above 25. I have 2 that made it to 40. Only 1 with a mount. I have to control the altitis.
---
I want it to exist now because I don’t want 10k server queues

Okay, I went all the way back to when they first started splitting EU servers up by language, about a month before the pre-WotLK patch hit:
---
 https://web.archive.org/web/20080910213558/http://www.warcraftrealms.com:80/eu_realmstats.php
---
On the realms that are missing one faction's data, I went back until I could find a solid census grab for that server (no more than a couple months), and then applied that known faction balance ratio to estimate the missing data.
---
Here's what I found:
---
Across all Spanish realms, the region's active playerbase was roughly 2.37% of the total EU playerbase.
---
Across all French realms, the region's active playerbase was roughly 10.19% of the total EU playerbase.
---
Across all RP-PVP realms, the continent's active playerbase was roughly 4.78% of the total EU playerbase.
---
German RP-PVP players made up 2.36% of the total EU playerbase.
---
English RP-PVP players made up 1.63% of the total EU playerbase.
---
French RP-PVP players made up 0.79% of the total EU playerbase.
---
So no single language's RP-PVP community reached the margin of the Spanish playerbase, which isn't getting a single designated realm in Classic.
---
The total RP-PVP community was roughly double the Spanish playerbase, but only about half the French playerbase.
---
yesssss!
---
Probably because he doesn’t pretend to be someone he’s not. He’s literally just a regular guy.

Need to be defensive for ganks in the first few months.
---
spell coefficient is calculated from base cast time, it has nothing to do with what level the spell is. Though by coincidence, the most efficient ranks are around lvl 20 because that's where the casts get their full cast time.
---
And yes, almost every damaging spell changes casting time between the early ranks.
---
R1 frostbolt: 1.5 seconds https://classicdb.ch/?spell=116
---
R2: frostbolt: 1.8 seconds https://classicdb.ch/?spell=205
---
R3: frostolt: 2.2 seconds https://classicdb.ch/?spell=837
---
R4 frostbolt 2.6 seconds https://classicdb.ch/?spell=7322
---
R5 frostbolt: 3 seconds https://classicdb.ch/?spell=8406 and so is the rest of the ranks.
---
That's why you use R1 frostbolt to slow players quickly...
---
And same goes for shaman's lightning bolt:
---
R1 light bolt: https://classicdb.ch/?spell=403 1.5
---
R2: https://classicdb.ch/?spell=529 2second
---
R3: https://classicdb.ch/?spell=548 2.5
---
And finally R3 at its full 3 seconds cast time https://classicdb.ch/?spell=915

He doesn’t shit on his community, or act like he’s better than anyone.

Guess so.

Exactly. People who don't actually know anything about the lore like to parrot "but muh camp taurajo" without actually knowing any of the specifics of the events that took place there.
---
Min-maxing dps is not about killing bosses most of the time. It's about the competition. It's about going the extra mile to beat the other guy. And it's not antagonistic. Some people just get their fun in the game by trying to be the best at it.
---
I assume they will purge low level characters of inactive players some time after launch, as they are anticipating plenty of "tourists"
---
Join the oce classic wow discord and find a guild :) there's a bunch of guilds looking and everyone is really friendly

Yes you can. And I did. All the way through spider wing naxx. But still probably the worst class race combo.

Sounds like a pretty weak excuse tbh. Does he just plan on not streaming? Because his mongoloids will find him, and fast. Nothing better to do while the tendies are ik the oven.
---
yeah. It was the result of really poor planning, but it was by no means deliberate
---
From what I read this morning, yes.
---
That was my problem as well, starting over like 20 times. This time I'm going to be focused. Planning on playing wow as my main mmo, really the only game I play. Hope to see you out there. I'd give you my name but it's too funny to share.

Your 1-10 time seems way off to me but the rest are spot on.  All classes can hit it ~2 hours.  You doing a bunch of initial setup/macro/profession work?

It’s hard to explain. Someone else kind of described it well by saying remember how your house seemed bigger when you were younger - only I don’t think it was my mind playing tricks on me. It was like the landscape looked like a much bigger place even though everything was “where it was supposed to be.”

Hopefully it stays. No reason to make reporting ToS breakers harder.

Asmongold doing live atm

...the Burning Legion would have gone to Draenor anyway because thats where the Draenei were hiding, so I'm not sure what you're point is.

Warts and all
---
Asmongold is hood for real.  You can't teach that.
---
If that's what gets them off, they have bigger problems going on in life. So no worries :D
---
Well, I know Warlocks are less played than most other classes and not many go to raids, I think. Either way you can go wrong with either class, both are fun.
---
 I seem to recall the ffxi sales system being fairly bad as well.
---
Yea this is a good idea. I’ll probably do the same.
---
30%-45%.
---
Lotta people will be lost between 19-39. That lack of fast travel really gets to some gamers. Thats fine. If they make it to their first mount IMO they're hooked.
---
stream man bad
---
It would end up in a stalemate if the hunter doesn't give up the opening since both players can just end up doing nothing.

There is a penalty to applied spellpower on al spells sub level 20

It was an example. If you want to make a list, go ahead.

That example alone is enough to show it's a shit show...

Probably in the neighborhood of 75-85%. That's just how game releases work these days; people get bored easily and the casual crowd doesn't really get invested.

Talisman of Binding Shard dropped in 1.3, it was only dropped one time, and was hot fixed the same day to not drop anymore.

So by yours, Hunters and Warlocks shouldn't have pets?

You're too low IQ to understand what's going on.

I can't help you understand it. Sorry.

I guess I’ll go back to a pserver or play Stardew Valley.

It had an enjoyable leveling grind and the server I was on at least had a pretty awesome community. Overall I miss the game :P

Oh hey I think you dropped this:  /s

Yeah I’m all for authenticity but I want to play with a modern monitor, resolution, frame rate, and server speed. I *hate* the idea of having it feel super laggy so we can reproduce a couple buggy 15 year old interaction.

The REAL one with proper setup will be in 2 days by another streamer.

It's reasons like this it should be removed. If you don't like someone there's the ignore button, accessed just as easily. The only thing a right click report button does well is fight gold sellers. If you can't bother to type up a proper report to report someone you probably weren't that bothered by it anyway.
---
Again, I think you've misunderstood the argument. Time vs ability to complete the raids. I'm not saying it's as faster to bring an enhance shaman. I'm saying it's still very doable and that bringing one or two hybrid dps will not add hours to a raid time unless the raid is shit anyway. Play whatever you want man. Idgaf.
---
The Gnomeregan quests to get the teleporter and then the one that grants those nice leather pants.
---
didnt asmongold make a video talking about this and how easy it was to get suspended by abusing it,  regardless of the intent.
---
I'm inclined to believe that they would simply open the store if that were the case. They may start small, not even mounts. There was some kind of initial investment in Bliz making Classic available again. They won't simply shutter it if it leads to a player drain from retail.
---
Going to break it to you softly.  Fixes like what you ask for aren't exactly clean.  It's not like they can change one value and it works.  In all likelyhood this requires an extensive refactor of the spell system that wasn't done until 2.0 or later.
---
Same here--he's been getting my twitch prime subscription these past couple of months haha

Got a Holy Pally friend leveling with me. How good are hunters with them at max level?

Damn you weren't wrong. That rabbit hole took me to MGTOW for the first time. What a messed up mind set they all have.

Might as well ask this; what about requesting invites for group
---
Why don´t they preposition the duellants all across azeroth and then switch to them as duell starts? This is so ineffiecient. They port like 20 players and beat around the bush forever.
---
Because it'll be easily exploited.
---
The community should regulate itself, as it should in any good MMORPG.
---
It works in BFA because everyone is faceless and everyone shares everything, barely anyone abuses it. That's not going to be the same in Classic.

I'm not misunderstanding at all, I simply don't think your argument is valid.

You could do a raid with everyone being a stupid spec, but it's a waste of everyone's time.

My guess is that MC will use 1.4 loot tables at launch since it doesn't really make sense to use the earlier one.

That's a small sample size.  I know you arent the only ones, but even so there is no perfect system.  It may be painful to reroll but consider entire communities being completely fragmented by not being able to communicate in their native tongue save for say, 5 people.
