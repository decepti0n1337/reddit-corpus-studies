RP-PVP was my shit. I started on a PVE, then realized I found PVP a bit more engaging, and then wanted do more WPVP stuff which led me to RP-PVP because of all the guild rivalries.

Literally the "I'm so ugly" compliment-fishing from facebook
---
I'm glad that people are changing their minds, and embracing classic. Why even be mad?
---
Source?
---
Because she's an influencer. Blizzard wanna make Classic WoW an every man's game. Only giving ex. private server streamers access doesn't target a wider audience.
---
You guys realise this is a joke right? How old are you all
---
They give naysayers access because their respective communities listen to them. If the naysayer content creators changes their mind about the game, so does their community.
---
Maybe it would be more fair if someone else got it, but quite frankly nearly no one cares except the people who keep making threads like these. Very few things was ever fair, and Blizzard being fair here doesn't make sense from a business perspective.
---
**TL;DR** Get over it.
---
It was in the original “set your calendar” blue post that announced the release date.
---
same with the defias they did nothing wrong
---
How much time is this wasting? Like 5 seconds? Pathetic
---
Except for his hundreds of hours of video evidence and the dozens of times he has speed leveled to 60. 
---
He is likely one of the most knowledgeable outside of the actual people he developed the game all those years ago.
---
Did you get it now, or still didnt get one?
---
That is TBC armor.
---
This subreddit needs to stop being so damn butthurt holy. If she enjoys it and changes her mind fine. If she doesn't who cares. Quit sperging about every person who got in or who didn't.
---
plader accounts?

Legit never heard that word before. What is it?
---
thanks friend :)
---
Swifty played vanilla and he reported “not being able to equip gear in combat”as a bug. 
---
Half these people complaining about authenticity and veteran-ness are old and senile now, just have forgotten or played too much private server.
---
The focus is more on the sword, not the armor. But, you're not wrong.
---
Tauren is a strictly suboptimal hunter race. It’s too bad cuz Tauren Hunters are awesome

You don't need to rush through in anything. In fact you probably shouldn't. Explore the game at your own pace.
---
The people who are rushing through and trying to be the biggest dick virtual elf have played the shit out of this game for years. They can't get the same sort of experience that you'll be able to, so feel fortunate in that.
---
Quel'Serrar, but, close enough. One of my most prized possessions in this game.
---
Ive had my account since 2005 and I didnt receive a beta invite. I really really want to play. Hopefully I get an invite soon. 
---
Only good thing is Wednesday and Thursday is stress test so we can all log on.

Because this kind of cropped image isn't ridiculously easy to fake?
---
He's four levels higher and he never played vanilla...he is downplaying the level advantage but four levels is fucking massive in vanilla. 
---
Think a lot of people are desperate for this game to be harder than it really is. I've seen a lot of nonsense about CC always being required and it being impossible to kill multiple elites. It's just not true.
---
*Big Bang Theory Laugh Track*

BAZINGA
---
Yes there is lol
---
I don't know everyone im pretty bad with names. most of the people I named either stream or make youtube videos. Obviously there are some really good players out there that don't and it's not that I favor streamers, they are just more known and easier to see how good they are.

&gt;  Almost impossible not to find some one who could do almost exactly what you do with minimal practice.
---
This has never been true. Not in vanilla, not in BfA, nor any time in between save for some edge cases in PvE like shadowbolt rota or hunter spin (mwheel) to win.
---
I'm curious what makes you think tab targetting somehow removes every other skill reliant element in the entire game though.
---
If your tanks were iffy already, I guarantee they will be even less inclined to stick around if you’re giving thunderfury to a rogue over them. As soon as they get a better offer, they’re outa there.
---
Well they make a SHITLOAD of money, so if it is so easy to do better, why dont you?
---
I'm not a fanboy at all. I watch on occasion, I respect the fact that they are making a living doing something they love, and I certainly don't stoop low enough in life to shit on strangers on the internet who make videos. It's crazy.
---
Private servers can't run Vanilla 'easily' lol. Private servers (MangOS and such) are products of years of work trying to figure out what the old WoW client is listening for, how it communicates with the server, etc. The only reason that it's so easy to run is that they released their emulator publicly as open source, and people have continued that work.
---
Blizzard could do that easily, they have the actual server code, but it wouldn't work with the modern architecture. So either they have to take the old stuff and make it work with the new stuff, or take the new stuff gut it and make it work like Vanilla.
---
Either way, its 13 years of work they need to redo/undo in a couple years.
---
You’re missing a couple
---
1. I want to play Boomkin. Blizzard should rebalance the classes / do you think blizzard with balance the classes?
---
2. I GOT IN TO THE BETA / how do I get in to the beta
---
Sure there's video that helps prove things, but he's still as susceptible to faulty memory as any of us.
---
The private servers watched the fucking videos you ass hat
---
HOLY SHIT. I got to mid 40s playing private servers and did not know exactly how much I had left to go. I had so much fun pvping during the low levels that it took me days to get to the 40s. I can’t imagine how long it will take me to hit 60.
---
Hey, you.  You're finally awake...
---
What does that have to do with the past?
---
Do me a favor and jump off of a bridge.
---
Bruh same here. 
---
So disappointing.
---
Closest thing you can try atm is download BFA since its free and try to see how it runs since classic uses the same engine . There is also a stress test next week and depending how they do it you might have the chance to try classic yourself
---
I'm getting chills again, write their names down again.
---
I was there! Only on the server Spinebreaker!
---
How do you get so mad over someone playing a videogame poorly lmfao. You realize when everyone *was* playing vanilla the majority of the playerbase was god awful, chill the fuck out i promise you it's not that bad.
---
Yeah, it was a real shame not to see him in the initial wave but atleast they got him in relatively quickly afterwards.
---
In order to avoid deleting his actual main character he kept it on a level 1 so he can sell the name to someone else. Just a guess.
---
Was that even a bug? I've always just assumed it was intended. I've never played hunter in vanilla/pservers, did it not kill you *every* time?
---
I really dislike Panser, her anti wow classic stuff is so fucking sad, but that reply and your whole sperging is just dumb, seriously.
---
No official source besides Blizzard saying is they want "dedicated players" in the small scale beta. So far the only non-streamers to get invited so far have all reported that they had an account from 04-06.
---
It makes sense they want bug reporting from people who played during that time period, since this is a recreation project.
---
In his most recently, and last, class interview on Countdown to Classic, Kevin spoke about rogues and the philosophy behind their design. 
---
I don't want to put words in his mouth and if you haven't you should check it out. But if I may summarize, what I got regarding why they had combo points drop when you swapped target was that they didn't like the gameplay and design of building up combo points on one target then using those combo points on the next target. They also didn't want to create a sense of rush, where you felt you had to constantly go from target to target to take advantage of any leftover combo points before they went away.
---
Literally who?
---
I've seen more people complaining about toxic behaviour than actual toxic behaviour
---
Bro what are you even talking about? Streamers deleting shit and acting all tough for views. Of course we are going to shit on them. Everyone on here is an older breed of gamer, it’s not about age but mentality. We are competitive but fair
---
Thanks for this. I'm surprised so many people have been freaking out about the dungeon streams, everything I've seen so far looks tuned properly for an organized group. Let's wait until we see some pug runs with people who are not on voice chat, new to their class, first time running the dungeon, etc. Your group level makes a huge difference too (why does everyone always want to run deadmines at 17? that's probably why you remember having a bad time...)
---
A group of skilled players (and sorry, people love to call these streamers baddies but realistically they are playing way better than your average joe pug player) with good gear, good comp, and lots of experience should absolutely breeze through these dungeons.
---
Might be a stuoid question but what is BFA?
---
How is it not a bug? And if it's not a bug, what is it?

Battle for Azeroth expansion
---
Wow it just fits the 12 char limit. I'm totally stealing this for my gnome warrior. Cheers!
---
Stay mad
---
Classic is being run on a BFA client, not a Vanilla client.
---
There are so many things that are altered as a result; you can't just look at the raw data and trust it to be 100% accurate - otherwise, they wouldn't need a beta period.
---
Sureness 100
---
Yeah, WoW is best enjoyed while not knowing shit and playing with someone who also doesn't know shit
---
Nah, gnome can choose a pink skullet with a pedo stache. That it is the best look without a doubt.
---
Yea, drop a mind blast to open, follow with a SW:P, then a mindflay, and wand, and your wand would take you the rest of the way. With spirit tap, you'd be back up to near full mana by the time you were pulling another mob.
---
Yep, not enough time to fix it so Blizzard will tell us it’s working as intended. Sincerely hoping they haven’t given up on faithfully recreating this game but I really doubt it.
---
Are you jealous or something?
---
Oh yeah the guy that just had 100k viewers and over 3000 subs in an hour is going to fail. You wish your just jealous you can’t play wow for a living.
---
No it's 92
---
+1337 RP-PvP is a must for launch
---
Do you want people who are currently against Classic to forever dislike, or do you want them to change their minds and actually give it a chance?
---
If the latter... then why make such a comment after someone does just that.
---
I dont watch streamers so I have no idea what his gear looks like but is he and his group just in the best of the best gear for his level? Could that be it? I'd imagine a streamer has pretty much every slot as a high tier item for his level.
---
Upvote to see where this goes
---
I don't know, but I assume so
---
There's no information from Blizzard to suggest the beta is going to remain up until launch.
---
I didnt make a full post. It was just some comments buried in another one, likely immediately following blizzcon last year where they talked about how they were porting classic in a panel. I'll look for it but nothing I said was all that original and can be found in quite a few other ones from around that time also. The very basic premise is that scaling for over a million people and hosting old software on new hardware, operating systems, and frameworks is far far harder than many people think it is.
---
Why would I be?
---
Battle for Azeroth - actually I didnt say that correctly - you have free access up to level 20 or w/e in the current retail WoW and you can use that to check how it will run (BFA is the current expansion and doesnt have anything to do with this, wanted to say retail wow instead of bfa, my bad)
---
    User was banned for this post.
---
No idea tbh. I only followed him during his Vanilla/TBC playing days and stopped following his endeavors when he started playing online poker. After doing some reading it seems as though he's losing his marbles. Kinda sad tbh..
---
TAKE ME HOME
---
dont read guides
---
dont rush
---
just play
---
Are you 12?
---
So you'd give it to a hunter or a paladin over your 2nd tank?
---
Its funny how poo poo butt hurt so called vanilla players get when you dont submit to their memories. Keep chasing that dragon
---
If there is even an issue, of course.
---
Paladin DI shennanigans, wall jumping, and old school AV are what I wanted most out of classic. I'll take 1/3 I guess, wven if I'm not playing a Paladin again.
---
And this is why a game from 2004 needs a beta (if anyone was wondering). Its going to help a lot for this kinda stuff that is only really noticed in mass testing.
---
i still dont have one, my account is from 2007 so itll probably be later in the beta when i get in, if i do at all
---
why do we bother saying they when everyone is clearly talking about Asmongold..
---
here is the thing BfA is a better made game it has intent solid game design and reasoned logic over how thing work and are done that takes into consideration the player base and what it dose.
---
classic has non of that it is a mixture of cobbled together systems and classes from wanting to make a better everquest using WC3 as the basis for that work. it gives classic this peak and valley in terms of challange that is always high but it is easier and harder at diffrent point for diffrent classes this means working together with people is greatly beneficial while not being mandtory so you make have thing be a cake for you right now but 5 levels latter you need help to keep your speed up so you group up all the time. the very very slow pace of classic gives you time to talk to people there will be minutes of down time and suddenly you will become friends.
---
I remember on the Blackrock server in IF some naked Tauren used to run around inside with general chat weebs screaming ‘leave him leave him’
---
Started during the ToT patch for Mists back in 2013.
---
I'm checking my launcher and emails so often but nothing shows up. 
---
I cant stand it. 
---
All these people enjoying classic and I cant get in on it. Its killing me. 
---
I just wanna play.
---
And those reports will be discarded as soon as anyone looks at them. The reality of bug reports is that a good majority of them are borderline or completely worthless unless they are coming from actual QA or at least someone with a brain.
---
The benefit of having a large streamer play the game is that they effectively have thousands of people watching that PoV. So if a bug does happen it's almost guaranteed to be noticed.
---
Obviously advertising is their main goal with getting people like Shroud etc in but it's not like it really matters anyway. They have plenty of people invited that *are* digging into the mechanics and bug testing too. 
---
I think people tend to be like "I wonder who's in the beta" and they go to twitch and see a bunch of streamers in the beta... Do you see the problem here? People are basing their perception of who's in the beta by looking at a streaming site which *obviously* is populated by people streaming.
---
“Took all night to download” - ‘04 internet confirmed
---
no need to rush, leveling is as valid experience as end game is. take your time and dont stress too much
---
The beta is far far far far closer to vanilla than it is to fucking BFA lol. If something is even wrong, it's incredibly minor. 
---
This community is unhinged.
---
Nope. Group bonus was always triggered, regardless of size.
---
well TBC will be coming at some point, so title still isnt wrong :P
---
If you can't trust your MT with thunderfury then your guild is shit and at that point I guess you can do whatever because it wont last long.
---
Memes aside that’s actually a pretty slick looking tabard.
---
You could play vanilla on a office potato pc. Only later in bc you needed to upgrade your ram but that was all. I still remember the first weeks of bc where it took 2 minutes to load into Shattrath. Doubled my ram  and it was only a 10sec loading screen. It wasn't that bad in classic even in a 40 man raid.
---
Why dont you go and play BFA? This supposedly "gatekeeping" is why classic is a thing, without that it wouldn't happen
---
Naxx pally the best healer in the game imo
---
Starting area is like that though
---
Get a fucking grip lmao. Have you actually played beta?
---
Hard to blame him. A man's gotta eat. I just wish he'd admit he was wrong humbly and I'd back him once again.
---
Exactly. Have him to speed runs and you’ll know pretty quickly if it’s faster or slower.
---
Glad to see she admitting she's a "pathetic loser virgin with rose-tinted goggles stuck in the past"
---
&gt; other thread about him
---
could you link it please?
---
White knights, assemble!
---
I don't know you but I love you
---
Post removed as a low-effort shit post / gate-keeping.
---
I saw him do it. https://clips.twitch.tv/ZealousStupidChimpanzeeLitFam
---
This post was positive and mostly upvoted until that stream. I'm not assuming anything.
---
Even with that 20% slow difference, he is still charging at a significantly higher speed. Your point is noted though
---
I know from watching videos about classic that the 1.12 patch the drums of war was when weapon attack speed was normalized perhaps this is a side effect of normalizing mob damage?
---
Really pushing the limits with those specs I see
---
I remember that. It's not something hard to remember.
---
Over another warrior? No. Allowed to roll for it? Yes.
---
But I would also require anyone that wanted to be in the running for extra TF's have the required 10 Enchanted Elementium Bars (obtained through through their own gold) before rolling.
---
Omar comin' yo!
---
Quin is an incel
---
That's just how vanilla was. That's why more quests were added in later patches ie. Thorium Point.   
---
Btw, poster above is right. They had XP values off in the sense that quests were giving too much XP. It's been fixed now though.
---
Is it really gatekeeping to not want someone who insulted everyone who wants to play classic to have a key?
---
The itemization sucked too. Who wants to be a fucking Paladin wearing cloth? Your class fantasy is a holy warrior...cloth is not that. Stats sometimes made no sense, at all. That was on raid items not just leveling stuff.
---
lol. holy fuck that’s a bad post.
---
It'll run it fine. I'd say get some more ram if you can, easy upgrade that shouldn't cost too much
---
This is correct. Basically it allows you to completely avoid leveling on green chance things. This is H U G E in engineering, it basically halves the mats required for 1-300.
---
&gt; Asmongoloid literally begs for prime subs on his stream, cringe as fuck.
---
Imagine getting your panties in a bunch because your brain can't parse sarcasm.
---
Chat reminded him it was only trinkets and weapons
---
he acknowledged it.
---
Done.
---
This is a non issue and shouldn't be taken out of context.
---
Oh, I'm not saying private servers are terrible, and they certainly didn't completely make up their values. However, they are inaccurate enough that using them as a reference point for... well, let's be honest, pretty much anything related to the game mechanics just isn't good.
---
Dude this guy is the man, thanks for the rec!
---
I don't completely disagree. I think had they invited a larger group at the beginning there would be less complaints. Just the first few days seeming like nothing but streamers and "influencers" is going to make people annoyed.
---
&gt; My point is that after the main tank, bindings should go to any class equally.
---
&gt; Over another warrior? No.
---
It's almost like those things are mutually exclusive.
---
lmao you got reported but every single word of your post is the actual fucking truth. hope this sub burns in hell
---
Yeah he went totally off the deep end lmao. Turns out the weird egomaniacal 'act' wasn't really an act unfortunately.
---
In the past, he was basically a cult leader lol
---
The secondary warrior and the rogues, hunter, and paladins would have an equal chance.
---
"Over" suggests a preference.
---
No point trying to rush in classic. It wasnt designed to be a rush to endgame like it is now. 
---
Just enjoy the ride.
---
Roll female Night Elf for maximum thirst
---
DEUS LUX, BROTHER.
---
So there I was. A noob-ass level teen-something dwarf hunter. 
---
I'm just leveling in Elwynn as any lost scrub would, maybe I was running from Westfall to Stormwind for some reason or another because I had no idea what I was doing. (This was the same 13-year-old kid who removed "attack" from his actionbar so he went into his inventory and just dragged the musket over to the actionbar and couldn't figure out how to fight anything so I just deleted this dwarf and started over.) 
---
Virokai. Level 27 human mage. I will never forget him. Because he posted in General "RAID TO ATTACK THE HORDE! JOIN UP NOW!" or something or other and he was all the way level 27, he must know what he's doing. So I joined up. There were about 30 of us amassed in Goldshire. Not a single level 60 to be seen. I think the highest was some 40's. Most of us below 20. 
---
We ran south through Westfall until you have to turn through Duskwood. So far so good. Adrenaline pumping. 30 level 15's scampering through a bunch of farms. But then we turned into Duskwood. Everything got dark. Music turned spooky. It was an omen of what was about to come, and we should have turned back right there. 
---
But we were young, dumb, and full of auto-run. A few guys got attacked by spiders or passing worgs but were fine otherwise.
---
Then it happened. We turned south into Stranglethorn Vale. It was mesmerizing. Thick, dense jungle and there were ?? tigers and gorillas far off the path. 
---
But anyone who knows STV knows the even "the path" isn't safe and we were then attacked by beasts one-shotting all of us. It was a massacre. So me, being the high-IQ player I am, realized *beasts can't swim* and won't chase you into rivers. 
---
"INTO THE WATER!" I shouted, eerily reminiscent of the "DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS" scene from Jurassic Park: The Lost World. 
---
But instead of salvation from the horde of beasts of the jungle, we were then attacked by piranha and crocolisks. We were torn to shreds in the water, and if WoW had blood effects in 2006, the entire river would have turned red with the blood of the innocent noobs. 
---
So now we're all ghosts, confused and scared. But again, high-IQ here, I remembered you could run as a ghost and spirit res in Booty Bay (I believe you could actually just get on the ship as a ghost and res for free on the loading screen but I didn't know that at the time). 
---
There were only a few of us left by now. Not even 20. Virokai was still there, that son of a bitch. We get off the boat into Ratchet, and march on to Crossroads. 
---
It was... a bloodbath. We were torn to shreds by random level 30's, guards, even Mankirk took a swing or two. The raid dispersed, now 20-something lowbies running around in all directions in the Barrens, and flagged for PVP. We were hunted like animals. 
---
I made my way back to Ratchet, wandered around for a bit, before hearthing back to the safety of the Eastern Kingdoms. 
---
That was my #1 "vanilla WoW" memory. And it has haunted my nightmares for coming up on 13 years now.
---
Fuck you Virokai and "The Legion" isn't even a good guild name you dumbshit.
---
He is. It’s not a bug.
---
Yes its basicly Mconnel that wanted the mount that dropped on retail but one of the raid members needed on it hence turning him mad.  And doing the imfamous REEEEEEEEE
---
google is evil
---
Because it lowers the required mechanical ceiling/
---
I am not physically capable of playing RTS at a high level anymore, and I was never good enough with my mouse to play at a high level.

I've never even been competent in shooters in anything but consoles. And that's only with a controller in my hand again my mouse work is poor. 
---
Tab targeting MMO with a long global literally anyone could play well with practice. Physically
---
I'm a rebel to the core.
---
Also in the ~5 years I spent playing WoW I had like 200 days /played on my Rogue and very few on anything else, so it's almost all brand new to me anyway.
---
i think a lot of it is people remember the game being awful and hard and how things just got better and better the thing is that hard and awful is what made classic so good.
---
a lot of the making thing easier and working better is only good short term in the long terms these changes has really hurt WoW.
---
when the LFG was made in WotLK people praised it since now they could just get here emblems with randos cross server rather than asking in trade or city chat for trivial content. however long term is greatly hurt the WoW community as it pushed the boat out futher and made people talk less.
---
People like you are pretencious as fuck, if they submit a bug that's not a bug who cares? It gets ruled out, "PeOpLe wHo rePorT thInGs LiKE thIs aRe stUpID" You actually sound like you have trouble making friends irl.
---
Even if it's *not* gate-keeping, it's a low-effort post. There's no discussion or serious question encouraged by the OP, it's just a witch-hunt with lulz in the title.
---
Go white knight for asmon on twitch and gift him your paycheck in subs. Sad you're just a tool.
---
While that’s true I am super jealous, my comment was sarcastic. I’m all for streamers of all kinds doing this. it’s good for hype, good for finding bugs on a massive scale, and good for the game :)
---
Oh no Blizzard’s credibility is damaged!? But I wanted to believe Blizzard is perfect and can do no wrong!
---
They also _match_ their lore better. Paladins bubbles _look_ like holy light. Shamans heal using _water_ like they’re supposed to. Its not just more polygons.
---
Isn’t 92 halfway to 99 though
---
I wonder where Joe is now these days. Or the ring guys....
---
Damage is correct.
---
Imagine for a moment if all forms of social media and streaming platforms were banned. All these man-children would have to get 9-5 jobs like the rest of us. It's honestly embarrassing.
---
a 10 year old account isnt even that old that means you're al iteral wrath baby lmao.
---
It's mostly because you don't really see the rest of the people. The streamers are the only public facing participants anyone can see, there's been a bunch of posts from people in this sub saying they got in and this sub is a relative drop in the bucket all things considered. Obviously I'm also just speculating but it stands to reason that plenty of non-streamers got in too.
---
It is frustrating though for sure. I can definitely see where the complaints are coming from.
---
For me it is.
---
Then you are in for a rude awakening.
---
"Hi there...do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Omar Gonzalez?"

Like everyone else was saying, discovering stuff is half of the fun. Just run around and figure it out! Exploring is part of the excitement.
---
I don't buy that for a second. He didn't even say that until he saw someone rationalize what he mean in this thread.
---
You will be incredibly choppy on 4 gigs of ram.  On low settings you'll run it, with 8 gigs I think you'd run it smoothly.
---
You’re not helping. So do that.
---
Here is what I plan on doing personally. This might not be the fastest or the best way for some people but I like doing it this way.
---
  
---
I'll make my Main and sit him in rested asap. Then I make alts, twinks I may want, bank alts. Level all of them to level 10 with the professions I want trained. I will have all profs spread throughout them all. I'm a nerd.  
---
To me this is the only way I will play my toons again. Once I hit 60 I dread starting at lvl 1.  
---
Once I get all of them to lvl 10 they all sit rested next to a mailbox and bank. Then I start leveling my main. I keep playing my main till I want a break, want to play another class, see other starting zones, or farm for the precious gold. 
---
I know I will hit max level way later than everyone but to me that doesnt matter and I will have my whole classic account set up for anything I need.
---
I will only level 2 maybe 3 max toons to 60 eventually and have the rest as twinks or farmers. I know this will take alot of time, but it is classic. I am going to enjoy every second regardless of how long it takes.
---
Wowhead bought Thotbot and has a Thotbot theme on their classic site. They even imported the old comments.
---
It at least made me check his shop to see if it was true.
---
It was.
---
Streamers and their followers are cancer. They are already pumping this sub full of le epic twitch clips and white knight at the first chance to defend their favorite e-celeb from criticism. It's all very cringe and is killing the sprit of vanilla.
---
Delusional
---
Not exactly the highest dps in the game, not by a long shot. But it does help to make feral druids more viable.
---
I feel like i would remember the drama this would have caused. I'm going to need to write a macro for the beginning of a dungeon to try to minimise drama. Watch that shit turn into a meme real quick.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"when you group with Lordfarkass these are the loot rules for drama minimisation...."
---
I didn't (started playing in BC tho) I didn't think to loot and sell trash. I just left it because why would I pick up junk

It is a laptop i would habe upgraded if it was a pc. I moved out to college and had to buy the cheapest shit i could really quickly
---
reread the original post in this chain and you tell me what it implies
---
Why imagine that? They are entertainers like musicians and actors, there job is to entertain people, if they can make a living at it then good for them. Id honestly call it impressive not embarrassing that they are able to do what they love and call it their career.
---
No, in the past he was a gamer/entertainer, lmao... And I know there's a high probability that you're an iGEN kid that's obviously pushing a certain agenda. I'll just leave it at that.
---
Then stuff like this happens  [https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyBetterPistachioPicoMause](https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyBetterPistachioPicoMause) wasting their time
---
Try a private server to see if you like it.
---
even on private servers experienced warriors still go arms from the start just because it's so much better in dungeons and pvp when you know what you are doing. /sit was a noob trap, and now that it isn't anymore you still go arms.
---
oh look my new look screen till summer
---
People just don’t trust blizzard.
---
It’s hard to tell around here.
---
Classic WoW is best enjoyed through your own play style brun.  You want to run around and grab all the FP’s first to maximize your leveling speed later?  Go on with your bad self!  You want to grind mobs and never even do a quest?  More scrub loot for you!  You want to stumble around aimlessly for hours on end with no purpose in mind?  Not all who wander are lost!
---
At the end of the day have fun, as soon as you ding 16 print out your character and rub it in your parents face.
---
If you bought less LSD you might have a better computer
---
Images you can hear
---
Theres definitely a lot of anger around here
---
it's a joke. Been here six years.
---
People would be more appreciative if they didn’t constantly act so entitled.
---
You are a strange fellow
---
I do, the mobs deal the same damage when compared with old footage.
---
Been playing with the same friends I played with in vanilla, the game has only made it easier for us to stick together over the years while still being able to have full time jobs and other commitments.
---
that's the joke
---
one of the streamers got salty that verdan kicked his ass, so he filed a false bug report
---
[This](https://clips.twitch.tv/RacyWonderfulWhalePanicBasket)
---
less than 10 bow skill consistently hitting a mob that is 9 lvls higher for full damage.  Also I'm fairly positive that mobs that were 4? 5+ lvls higher had a skull icon and did increased damage and took much less damage (and were also harder to hit/notmiss).  Very positive that a group of 4 shouldn't be able to do this.
---
Irrefutable harsh truths hurt, right? Imagine being so dumbfounded one resorts to ad-hominems because they've got nothing credible to ad to the discussion. You're definitely going places in life, kiddo.
---
Poor Joe
---
In over his head??
---
This is a game, you fucking dweeb Lolol
---
And when you're choosing to to give it to, you're displaying a preference.
---
Pretty slow honestly mate.
---
I got downvoted and told to go play BFA just because I said I thought it would be cool to be the first (and only or 1 of like 20) people in a layer so I could do solo quests with no competition but still /who search the server to find people for dungeons.
---
Apparently that "isn't the authentic Vanilla experience" and I should just go play BFA. Lmao what a fucking joke. I played Vanilla the DAY IT LAUNCHED (which meant hours of fishing in Mulgore because of the launch lag). Don't tell me about an authentic vanilla experience bitch
---
[removed]
---
Any time something becomes popular, it turns into a turd. Wow being a prime example. Stopping these people, especially new ones is somehow gatekeeping. Reddit has fucked up so many things and the gatekeeping subreddit as well
---
You are so incredibly jealous.  Stop being so envious of others and focus on improving your own situation.
---
Shut up you stupid bitch
---
Why this far out from release though?
---
Night elf priest. Going shadow. Remaking my original character :)
---
&gt; JESUS, I PREFER TO LOSE KARMA THEN TO SEE THIS SHIT GOES LIVE.
---
So you dont really want vanilla but overtuned private server difficulty?
---
Just watch some old footage of the dungeons, its the same as the beta.
---
Are you kidding?! My first Gold Award! Thank you all so much. I wish you the best adventure in and out of the game.
---
...What?
---
Perplexity already did a bit of testing with tauren hunter when he was checking out tauren melee range. You could probs find what you're looking for in some of his clips/vods.
---
#You’ll wish you hadn’t looked 50 when you turn 30 bud.
---
I played vanilla and private servers and honestly remember things hitting a lot harder than they appear to be - even when I look at the vanilla videos it looks lower than I think it should be.
---
I remember that you simply couldn't fight 3 elite mobs like the ogres at the same time if they were in your level range, maybe when you got really nice gear it was doable but otherwise you would die.
---
Maybe I am confusing the instance elite mobs with the outdoor ones, i don't know tbh.
---
See this point: they have a working 1.12.1 original Vanilla client running internally to reference.
---
Also: they are taking source code from the old version and melding it into the new version, combat formulas, etc.
---
Additionally: the database values are unmodified from 1.12.1.
---
This isn't about me. Thanks.
---
Thanks for stalking my posts really good way to spend your time 😀
---
No testing required, hardiness is the most broken racial the game has ever seen.
---
I’ll look for that
---
For rogue I'd recommend guzu for more relax funny gameplay: https://www.twitch.tv/guzu
---
And Perplexity whos the best vanilla pvp rogue in the world and has a soothing british accent https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya
---
Well, Joana's twitch stream has him getting hit by a level 8 harpy at level 9 for 7-8 damage.  The same harpy then hits the same player for 5 damage, on a hunter.
---
This value aligns with a glancing blow, but since there is no visible combat log up (loltesting), we can only guess the cause.
---
You're going to be fine. Someone posted the other day their specs getting 40ish fps and theirs was quite a bit worse than yours.
---
I think 10+ levels higher before skull icon is shown
---
/u/gullu2002 made my comment bigger just in case you couldn’t read what I said the first time. 🤣👌
---
Damage is correct, Joana confirmed that its not too low.
---
So you're telling me, the same people that made Vanilla,TBC,Wrath all had something to do with the horrific following expansions?
---
And my place of work is the Burning Steppes when I was a miner
---
There should be a hardcore mode similar to ironman modes in OSRS. I think that would add a whole new layer of content for the game and inspire new communities to form and play for a long time.
---
I believe it will be. I remember specifically a moment on Esfand's stream when he pulled two blackrock orcs in Redridge, and he kept running while only hitting one. After the normal leash radius, one of the orcs ran back, which would imply that the other one kept following because Esfand kept hitting it.
---
I farted in 2004 but haven’t played since 2014 not sure it’s worth it. Also I don’t have BfA or even wod. I guess that would make me ineligible?
---
Took me a solid 2 minutes of thinking and I got downvoted. Maybe we should add those people to
---
&gt;Hilarious when the beta is shown to have different values than 2006
---
This isnt the case though, the beta matches with old footage.
---
What kind of diagram is this? I like it but I don't know what it's called.
---
If this is a drinking game, I'm going to be fucking dead before the night is even over.
---
This community is uniquely mentally unhinged. It is by a distance the worst community I've seen in gaming.
---
yeap, being sane and honest actually triggers that. [you should try it sometimes](https://imgur.com/a/ToaCsQD)
---
Yeah back in the day the flag dropping from vanish kinda worked to their advantage actually, because the flag took a half second or so to show up after being dropped so the rogue would just insta pick up the flag after dropping it from vanish (before it shows up for everyone else, just by spam clicking where it was dropped) and it kind of looked like the rogue blinked ahead with the flag when they reappeared. It was pretty awesome to see when it worked out. It was pretty common back then anyway.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq3m4j/why_are_they_letting_people_like_this_in_a_beta/
---
Eh, marginally I'd imagine. People love orc pet damage &amp; troll berserking, and war stomp is situationally useful for getting out of melee range, but it's not going to be a massive difference
---
Back on for round 2!
---
This video makes me want to play beta so fucking bad. He just gushes about the game for 12 minutes.
---
6 int will increase damage.  It gives you more chances to crit which will give you more crit and will be more damage.  I don't know what you're arguing, but you are wrong.
---
Wait you mean a guy that was Grand Marshall in 2006 might be able to destroy a dungeon that's older than a decade when he's like 3 levels higher than the mobs?
---
Anyone have a clip of this?
---
was in vanilla
---
If you were to ask me which WoW-era I associate "dungeon crowd-control" with the most it wouldn't be Vanilla, but TBC. In Vanilla the primary concern was tank threat, barring a few dangerous/annoying exceptions, but in TBC you had tank threat _and_ dangerous mobs as a rule rather than exception.
---
I tanked most 5-man content on a Warrior alt in Vanilla and I don't recall ever feeling as if I needed to use target marks, but less than a week into TBC tanking and I had 4 marks on hotkeys. Anecdotal, I know, but it's the experience I remember.
---
To the niggers I belong
---
No it wasn't. https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok?t=147
---
If you banned quest helper everyone would just alt tab to an online database anyway.
---
Holy pallies are also really amazing and make alliance raising much much much easier than horde, so that faction will be better geared as well.
---
If they wanted a beta to be 100% used for testing/breaking the game, they would have made everyone invited sign an NDA or ban streaming of the game while its in testing.
---
Several games and companies have done this.
---
These were available but they weren't used as often.    Thottbot was king! 
---
That being said addons are voluntary and a lot of people dont use them.  I dont know where you got this idea but I dont think it will be used like crazy on classic release if someone makes a good one.  If someone's ignoring you it's probably because they're a dick.
---
&gt;games dont have "objective good and bad points" necessarily though,
---
I disagree but it doesn't mean you can't like/enjoy bad aspects.
---
Probably SM/Ruin Warlock. Easily flexible to casual farming, casual pvp, and raiding.
---
They're both easy to level, druids are a lot more important in pvp since they can run flags and hots are nice so you don't get counterspelled. Tbh if you want the easy life go druid. Most guilds only take 2 which means less competition for gear. They're the least popular class so don't worry about not being one of those 2 druids. On the other end, guilds usually take 4 and sometimes 5 paladins and they are a very popular class so there's tons of competition for raid spots and gear.
---
WHAT THE FUCK JOANA IS BACK?!
---
AQ gates opening.. I was 58 and almost ready to experience endgame
---
Quests I believe
---
You are in for a rude awakening.
---
Regen rate confirmed to be the same as Joanas leveling videos from vanilla.
---
Joana himself confirming that damage is correct.
---
Mobs in videos of dungeon runs during vanilla deal the same damage as in the beta.
---
&gt;  I'm 95% certain, and it's not just by a little bit either, this version is completely nerfed.
---
Sadly, its just your memory tricking you.
---
If you want it to be harder you have to play private servers.
---
If you want vanilla, this is how it will be, its easy but the game overall is still more enjoyable than retail.
---
Well, Joana's twitch stream has him getting hit by a level 8 harpy at level 9 for 7-8 damage. The same harpy then hits the same player for 5 damage, on a hunter.
---
Windfury on corpsemaker. I was a noob ass shaman and I was wrecking mobs and alliance until level 40. Had no idea what I was doing.
---
No guides either, discovered the combo by pure luck
---
As the exact same type of person, I'd say the same about you.
---
Now it is.
---
I really hope things will look better for you soon. Don't give up just yet, things will become better if you work on keeping yourself in a good mental state. Also, it's not wrong to get help if you are in need of it. You are not alone in feeling as you do.
---
Best of luck friend.
---
Ok I reread your comment I can tell it’s sarcasm now. My bad I’ve just seen so many people hating on all these streamers lately.
---
lol
---
lol. Well done.
---
Hit formula for ranged weapon is generally more generous than for melees since there's no glancing/dodge/parry. Only hit or miss. That being said, the formula on the beta is clearly broken if someone with 10 bow skill isn't missing mobs much higher level than them.
---
Mobs need to be 10+ levels higher and aggressive (yellow mobs still show level even if 10+) to have a skull instead of a level, except for bosses.
---
Yes this works, they didnt fix ghosts going through doors until much later.
---
Lol don't flatter yourself please. The projections aren't a good look either, friend.
---
LOL
---
The mage and Hunter in his group were 30. That makes a huge difference.
---
Regen rates are the same as videos from that time, you are just misremembering.
---
If you are watching warrior level remember that they get a whole lot of regen from spirit.
---
Child. Just because you don't hold the keys to the gate doesn't mean your not.
---
Thank you. This sub loves telling people how they should feel about content. They can fuck right off back to their pservers.
---
I always call out to people to roll on boes. Remember guys don't be an asshole. Some people will be scared to speak up against a big streamer taking advantage of them.
---
For many of the quests they have no idea, that's how they were off in the first place...
---
Nah it used to be that way. Usually when I pugged we /roll 'ed for chests since they can have a boe worth a pretty penny.
---
The server won't be dead. The markets will be active. Very hard to farm recipes will be more readily available. Finding groups will be easier. I could go on but anyone with half a brain could figure this out
---
Hate to be that guy but it's neutral, not natural. Just want to avoid confusion.
---
This is the best answer. The original content should be as easy as it was. If we wanna have new content in 2yrs I'd be psyched to play that but you don't need to buff old content, especially not leveling dungeons which are horrible xp/hr as is.
---
Oh you...
---
It being a beta is not a free pass to take advantage of other people.
---
It has not been mentioned yet, but I think it is worth noting that Asmond and 50 others below level 30 went through Deadwind pass and killed Sky Shadows (lvl 55 mob) and Unliving resident (59-60). I feel like that would NOT have been possible. I did not check the damage output but it was kinda sketchy to me.  
---
Hope someone will look through the VOD.
---
everyone hide, the reddit psych ward has arrived
---
I think it was great.  I think YOU'RE great.  Keep hitting that button.
---
Oh I thought they were all the same level haha, yea that defs would explain why they were able to get through so easily.
---
I find it funny that asmon is constantly shitting on people who say they miss the challenge of classic wow cuz it was actually "so easy and you guys are just dumb" and uses this as an example when he's running a level 25 dungeon with level 30s...
---
lol I got downvoted in that thread for saying the same thing.
---
even after posting videos that showed the numbers weren't off.
---
smh
---
Thanks for your feedback.
---
thanks
---
No worries I get it, I should’ve thrown the /s in there :) cheers mate
---
This is posted fairly often. We usually limit it to one repost per 30 days or so, but since the sub has grown by about 10,000 subscribers since last time it was posted a week or so ago, I think it's fair to let this one stick around.
---
For sure. This subreddit has gotten almost 30k subscribers in just a month, and 15k in the last week. Most threads here now are absolute war zones.
---
They are also the slowest leveling hunter race. Taming  that damn swoop takes forever.
---
Uhhh I believe that clearcast is bugged on that server. He essentially has it up the whooooole time. I don’t think this is viable on a non buggy server....
---
I'm a reddit armchair doctor
---
Yes I am excited about classic, but it is a stretch to call him a Lord and Savior considering he is not saving you from anything.
---
Honestly it seems legit to me. I remember that I once kited a Devilsaur to Crossroads on Hunter alt that was like level 34 or something. Ranged attacks don't really give a fuck about hit chances.
---
This is not vanilla.
---
Dude why are you comparing to Retail? Retail could very well not be running Vanilla values... 4head
---
No. Dungeons in almost all situations are not worth doing while leveling. You need 3 to 5 quests to make it even worth it on top of getting the group together and travelling.
---
That being said, if you love a few particular dungeons than just fuckin go for it. I'll probably do a Dead Mines run, a run of each Scarlet Monastery dungeon, and a run through of Zul'farrak. I'll try to have at least one or two quests for each of em, but to me those are the dungeons I love the most so I'll hit 'em up while leveling.
---
chain dungeons is really really bad exp.
---
go get a crt monitor and a shitty hp tower pc with windows xp on it. good to go :)
---
Jeez I remember having to give people shit for ninjaing chests on a private server recently. Make sure you guys call this shit out when someone does it. It usually happens with friends. If they want to continue taking loot without rolling /leave the group and blacklist.
---
the zone/area text popup in the middle of the screen when changing areas (or entering caves/camps) should reflect the territory you're in.
---
instead of always being white (as it currently is), it should be Green (your faction controls it), Yellow (Contested area), or Red (enemy faction controls it).
---
This is after some rerecording as well. I've got to do something about my audio setup.
---
Watching some old vanilla videos made me realize that not only did the reduced draw distance and fog make the world feel bigger, the 4:3 monitors helped a lot.
---
One could say all these things about Morrowind too
---
Most things can be accomplished by someone with a stopwatch timing between uses of an ability. Nefarian and his class calls every 45s or whatever it is “be ready class call coming” doesn’t break anything at all. 
---
The addons in wrath (Cata?) that painted on the ground exactly where to go and stand were too much but all dbm is, is a prepopulated timer, idk why people are so opposed to it, it definitely existed most of Vanilla.
---
This graph also doesn’t take into account levels different classes acquire blink/sprint/travel form or when you gain access (and money) for a mount) when it comes to speed. People arguing over exp values and how it calculates with better quests aren’t talking about how fast you can get around. Aspect of the cheater my friends.
---
&gt;"using thottbot removes the need to communicate, and ask for help during quests. People simply follow the instructions on a page, no need for thinking, no need for communication, no need for help of any kind."     
---
      
---
hm maybe we should get rid of thottbot too, I applied the same logic though questing addons and thottbot don't remove the need to team up for quests.
---
I enjoyed it.
---
/roll isn't really a preference.
---
We got an experimental version of Azeroth Auto Pilot-like working, a lot of bugs but works.
---
click one.
---
I wish people could take off their streamer goggles and look at this rationally. Player did X, X is not okay. This is not an attack on your streamers. It's calling out uncool behavior that shouldn't happen in live either.
---
This was part of the game. This also works  in reverse. Los on gnomes behind small hills is interrupted
---
Efficient questing and killing mobs while strafing (for melee classes) are both ways to speed up leveling. Dungeons are only meant to be run once as quest runs.
---
I can confirm Karazhan has both the bottom and top instance portals behind doors/gates, just waiting for some classic+ (not talking TBC) goodness to be added.
---
Nope. Just vanilla classes. Adding goblins was an April fools joke at the time. lol and 2 players could control a 2 headed ogre.
---
THAT IS NOT HOW THAT WORKS. LOL. 
---
Why do so many of you just believe so much bullshit?
---
This is the first I've heard of that, do you have a link?
---
Interesting. Does it actually work or are you just trying it? Reminds me of a friend who played dps prot pally.
---
...Did you watch Esfand's perspective?
---
examples?
---
I love how once beta was announced, and the community started to split, the fanboys stopped having a good time.
---
Dungeons are only worth it from a XP/h perspective if you have all the quests for the dungeon, doing it more than once is a waste of time if you're looking to level quickly. 
---
Even that is a stretch, efficient questing mixed with grinding will most likely still win out. Joana (the world record holder for fastest to 60 in Vanilla) does 0 dungeon runs on his route to 60.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about efficiency though, play the game in your own pace, if you feel like doing a dungeon, do a dungeon. If you feel like questing, quest. If you feel like PvP, queue up for a BG or go to a contested zone for some wPvP. If you feel like running across the continent to explore the world, explore the world.
---
The only reason someone would want to rush to 60 in Vanilla is if playing games that way is how they enjoy them, always looking for faster personal records to 60, faster first server raid clears, faster boss kills and so on. Rushing to 60 kills the game if you're not that type of player in my opinion.
---
It is, regen rates confirmed the same from old footage, same with damage in dungones, it matches.
---
Joana who made the vanilla 1-60 speedrun has also confirmed that the mob damage is correct.
---
If you dont like it this way then youll have to go to private servers for overtuned content, because this is what the difficulty of vanilla was.
---
That's the first I've heard of this, do you have a link?
---
Not even that, just a regular above-waist ok sign.
---
Too many scrubs who didn’t want classic. Too many streamers against classic now riding the wave.
---
Fuck the scrubs and grief them endlessly
---
He did better than probably 99% of people doing their first playthrough and people who probably used guides
---
I mean they didn't remove the super known go under SW either
---
Literally almost anything with 8Gb RAM.  
---
An i3/i5 with an older generation Nvidia or ATI graphics card would probably be just fine, and wouldnt cost near 2k, maybe not even close to 1k  
---
The most expensive thing would be a Windows installation, unless you're planning on pirating one.
---
It's not that. I'm quite sure he is actually experiencing some form of brain deterioration. There is no way a person who could be so focused and attentive before could be so slow in the head now. Everything he says and does on his stream further exemplifies this. He just isn't all there any more.
---
I have a theory that the AQ launch servers had a slightly different patch order.  I seem to remember playing a paladin character on one, before the paladin talents hit.
---
the worst part is the people gatekeeping everything and making fun of people for not remembering EXACTLY how it was back then. i really despise reading those kind of comments
---
We would already know what number values we should use if blizzard kept a database of in game values. 
---
Any theories to why they don't have one
---
Technically, for the Common Era system, the first decade is 1-9. So decades are either 9 or 10 years on length.
---
I remember wall jumping in with a couple friends, we couldn’t figure it out until some guy showed up and jumped right past us all the way through. Loved all the mystery’s of Vanilla and rumors of what could come.
---
Feral is absolutely viable. I'd even go far enough to say, that it's optimal. you will be above the rogues' DMG and even provide +3% crit and that is insane for Warriors. I'm not sure if in the beginning of Molten Core, without world buffs, u might even out DPS Warriors.
---
For Rotation, gear and consumables take a look at Shedothedruid on YouTube. He proves the strength of Feral. Also u have to remember,that u can talk as Feral.
---
Not only is Druid absolutely underrated but also this whole "If u were to roll a Druid u would go resto" mentality has to stop at last. It's not the case anymore, people have to get over it. Feral, both tank and DPS is even better in what they're doing as resto in what it's doing. 
---
There is one downside though, Feral DPS will be though to play on Horde side due to Lower mana pool, Lower mana reg and windfury totem being bad for Feral.
---
pretty loose with the definitions there, streamer cuck.
---
You are forgetting time spent on preparing for the raids themselves. Farming mats for consumables, enchants, resistance gear and running the occasional older raid to gear up new people required a lot more time than the 6h/week.
---
Holy shit, I didn't think about this! Most of the huge streamers are NA and I'm not! Brightened my night.
---
If you're going for speed stay away from dungeons. If you're going for pleasure then dungeons are where it's at.
---
There’s a big smiley face under Kara. Not sure if it’s there now but I have a screenshot of me stood in it on my old pc.
---
underrated post
---
The thing is it's an mmorpg - pve isn't hard. Even the hardest content again is just a gear check.
---
I used to top my guild dps almost every boss in tbc, I had multiple top 100s in world of logs. I quit and came back in cata which was what, 3 years later, made a new rogue because someone had stolen my old account, and again was instantly getting top 100s on world of logs. 
---
Basically - people haven't got much better at playing the game, you are going to have casuals who aren't so good and high end raiders who are.  My experience comes from comparing classic and tbc players to cata players, so maybe I am wrong about this, but I never noticed a significant increase or any increase in skill across 4 years of wow.

So I just looked through, vanilla, tbc and wotlk bosses were staying alive for months at a time. New content is being cleared the same week it releases - it hasn't got harder it's gotten much, much easier.
---
The average wow player might be better at raiding now than they were back in the day, but the better players are going to be extremely similar skill wise. Trying to state that players have gotten so much better than they can finish harder bosses in 10% of the time is just not going to work, even if players had gotten significantly better, which they probably haven't, it wouldn't be enough to improve that much. People get better at things in increments, not multitudes in the space of a couple of years.
---
This is called publicity. Can you bring in 100k viewers?
---
Armor bruh
---
Not shit parts, but I am sceptical, the RTX 2080 Ti and i9-9900k already amount to around $2100 if you go by Swedish pricing. What are the profiting off? Or they're just not bothering with huge profit margins.
---
I shared this in another thread, but I found this list last night compiled from a few different places:

I'm curious, what's the goal of doing pickpocket runs?
---
 Edit - new reddit through me off looks like i didn't reply to u/ idk. Copy paste
---
I  am not physically capable of playing RTS at a high level anymore, and I  was never good enough with my mouse to play at a high level. I can't do  300 actions a minute while flipping PoVs and using my mouse  efficiently. I'm not physically capable of doing it at a world class  level no matter how hard I practice
---
I've  never even been competent in shooters in anything but consoles. And  that's only with a controller in my hand again my mouse work is poor.  And my console play is not that great either, requires extreme finite  motor skills to aim well with a joystick and I don't have that. You've  gotta have a real feel with your thumb
---
Tab targeting MMO with a long global literally anyone could play well with practice/keyboard knowledge. Physically
---
I remember my friend way back then showing me how to get in, we spent a good hour jumping around exploring the mystical world.
---
People wonder why reddit gets memed on by other sites
---
It's up to you if you want to rush. Streamers are doing it because they want to get to lvl 30 and probably do Wpvp. You can take your time leveling up or you can rush. Either way make sure you have a good time doing whatever you do. That said Joana's Guide is one of the best guides for leveling. Other than that search youtube there are a ton of videos out there.
---
The only they don't specify what Power Supply manufacturer, just the type and wattage. I've had many Corsair PSU's crap out on me. And no it was not thanks to blocking of airflow och dust. Just died.  
---
So I would recommend anything Corsair EXCEPT PSU's.
---
aka not free
---
- Hypothetically: Yes
---
- Based on vanilla-sourced math: also yes
---
- Pserver testing: also also yes
---
It's consume-heavy, but a lot of it is cheap (dragon chili and shadow oil) we'll have to see once more people are in later stages of Beta (blizz plz) - but as a math-oriented player, it can do some wicked good DPS at every stage.
---
There's no armour on the feet.
---
Ah. Sorry. /s doesn't translate well. I watched that stream, and laughed my ass off at it.
---
Frankly, streamers make me chuckle. They're bug reporting shit like Verdan, and starter gear not having AC, and the beta patch NOT letting you swap armor in combat. It makes me giggle so hard seeing these things being contested when they're accurate.
---
I have an '05 account, that re-subbed ( 6 months ) a few days ago.

---
Well esfand was on his way to coaching a college football team. So yeah it sounds like you're pretty bitter and envious. Don't be such a negative nancy
---
Who hurt you?
---
When I first played Vanilla and did my first escort quest, I let the NPC die.
---
I freaked out! I thought he was gone for good and I had ruined the quest for everyone! 
---
So I went and submitted a ticket and the GM was very nice about it... still feel like an idiot 10+ years later lol
---
Well after Naxx rolls out I would like to see a classic+ style approach to this version of the game. Personally I’d like to see more ten man dungeons put into the game. It’s a shame UBRS will be the only one.
---
It might be cool if they eventually added "side-grade dungeons/raids" content like this in these un-used places.  
---
  Stuff that doesn't replace old content, just adds new bosses/unique gear that acts as side-grade gear to compliment whatever build you want to work towards.
---
why not both?
---
I was thinking the exact same thing
---
Soon..
---
Your logic is flawed.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=488/zenns-bidding

That's the quest, where do you find the Nightsaber Fangs, Strigid Owl Feathers, or Webwood Spider?
---
Doesn't say. Quest Helpers do.
---
the hardest thing to do in sports is to hit a baseball, something that succeeding 30% of the time makes you a pretty good player.

Also nothing is more exciting in sports than watching a perfect game being pitched.
---
I'm gonna put my nutsack on your world of warcraft classic!
---
See you at the crossroads
---
Apparently this occurs only on pvp server. However on the beta, the popup on the pvp server is always white. I hope it will get fix!
---
Why not stop speculating about far-off scenarios when the actual game itself hasn't released?
---
it made you sick? oh my god get a fucking grip
---
I started WoW in 2007 and been playing for a lot of years. You can't be entitled to beta access. TONS of people want to play, you are I are just one of many. There is nothing that I have done that I can say that gives me the right to play. It is a privilege to have beta access. I could never get beta and have to wait 3 months to play the real game. It's just how life goes sometimes. You either get it or ya don't. Simple. It's just the reality of it. if you don't get access... then look forward to playing the full game! The wait will be worth it.
---
I want a continuance of classic.  Even going down the same storyline but keeping the mechanics like Classic and the difficulty levels like Classic would make me very happy.
---
Honestly I think it’s healthy for people to express their anger as they realize that aspects of classic wow will not be what they hope. Of course Blizzard can not please everyone, so it’s going to happen and people just want their anger to be heard. In the long run people will calm down and, I believe, the community will be much better once the game launches. With every wave of news there will be people voicing their displeasure. I don’t think it’s a sign of the future WoW community. I think it’s just people working through their frustrations.
---
Had to, in all seriousness probably combat. I want nothing more than to twink out with dual barbs in the 10-19 bracket
---
AHH OHH
---
"my story about how I got pegged by another player in 2005"
---
what?
---
Obviously you're not that type of person because if you were you'd know how wrong you are. Rogues were THE best potential class in PvP to the point where a good enough one could topple any class. Now that being said there were a ton of bad ones in Vanilla so you can't just say Hunters beat them because you beat some bad ones back in the day. If you don't believe me please there are lots and lots of videos online covering this feel free to look and if you still don't believe it after that than frankly I just don't know what to tell you.
---
Go sober up.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=932/twisted-hatred
---
There's another one where the enemy location is 100% wrong.
---
It's the current fashionable karma whore post to create.
---
Weakauras will Work aswell (first Version already working in Beta) so you wont even need dbm for that.
---
Just get all those Dungeon and raid WAs shared at once and youre good to Go for years :/
---
I'd be grouping up just as often either way. I never grouped because I couldn't find the quest, I grouped because I couldn't finish it alone. One player character on their own is too weak to handle some quests even if the quest is not an elite quest and the quest recommends the level you're at. Some spots just have mob packed too dense, making it a slog to do solo, so you end up grouping with other people in the area working on the same quest.
---
The choice became outlevel the quest and come back later, or group up.
---
Can someone with beta access please test something for me? In vanilla (and parts of TBC if memory serves correctly), you used to be able to sap opposite faction players in Booty Bay, Gadgetzan, etc. without aggroing the guards. I don't remember if this requires improved sap or not. But you DEFINITELY used to be able to do this. Around Wrath/cata they changed it. But I can't find the exact patch notes.
---
Jesus Christ can someone in beta make a male gnome Mage with a huge pink aggro and santa beard and take this screenshot for me please!!!
---
I need a new wallpaper toll August 27th.

gold, potions and poison/vanish/whatever rogues use items.

---
The best I can see is them releasing TBC in 2 years at patch 2.4.3 and WoTLK in 4 years at patch 3.3.5 with a lot of improvements from later expansions thrown in, but I don't see it going further than that.
---
I seriously doubt WoW Classic is ever going to get any creative design effort thrown at it.
---
But I also don't think WoW Classic is going to maintain more than 100K concurrent players after a year.
---
It said no poop socks.
---
Us-arthas was fking insane back then with some very powerfull guild like aurora strife. Sadly the queue time were so long
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
uhh his account is 10+ years old bud
---
See, this ist one of the core philosophical discussions in this sub. Many want no-changes, even If they are enhancing the Classic experience... But im ok with Just  doing how it used to be.
---
Bro this post needs a TL;DR.
---
I mean like you still need to communicate on elite quests and in dungeons. Most people back in the day would just thottbot the quest if they didnt know where it was.
---
Only true way to see the difference is clips from 'back then' with the same character level, race, ARMOR, etc and see the difference between the two.
---
Whether its 'the same' or 'different', this is the only true way to know.
---
I think once people can finally blow their load on this game they will calm down. Everyone is so pent up and ready to burst.... to play this game. 
---
But yeah I think things will be better once people can stop coveting it from a distance. No matter people's best intentions jealousy and bitterness at a distance is a real thing and a lot of people succumb to it.
---
Personally.. after all the phases are complete.. I’d like to just reset and go again.. classic wow as long ass “seasons”
---
Please
---
It does say. You click the item link the quest tells you to collect, it takes you to a page where it says which mobs drops that item. You then click on the mobs to see where those mobs spawn.
---
As for your second example, the enemy location is not wrong. It shows where the mob is in a cave, but Wowhead doesn't have maps of inside the cave, so it gives the location of the mob on the map layer above it. The first comment on that page states where the entrance to the cave you need is, and where in the cave the mob you need is. The coordinates for the mob is correct, but it's beneath the ground.
---
Just wanted to share this screenshot from (if I remember correctly) the AQ40 patch -- I was testing out the AQ20 shield I had just picked up. Hopefully, Classic will be as memorable as Vanilla was.
---
Mining was in razor hill. I think skinning your bet was Orgrimmar
---
What a shitty Argument. The problem is not the type of gear, it's the stats that the gear at the end of vanilla has, making Shaman not being able to tank raids. The right gear is missing, but that's it.
---
It's like Feral tank that wear leather but are still very strong and in some specific scenarios even better than Warriors. But for more info look out for "Skarm Tank" on YouTube, he knows it best.
---
yeah, i really like the feeling of entering that first contested area. or when you have to pass through enemy-controlled territory and the scary red font pops up.
---
seeing the neutral white really takes away from the world on pvp servers.
---
So the rogues always got the locked ones? or was he obliged to open them for the roll winner?
---
I'd be happy with seasonal fresh servers, Vanilla+ or TBC.   
---
I just don't really want to go to WotLK and onward.
---
Don't bother trying to change your entire diet if you want 1 wipe shits, just take a spoonful of fiber (Metamucil) every other day or so.
---
^(I want to to play a bug-less WOTLK, can we please have a bug-less WOTLK and then do whatever please uwu)
---
? am I missing something? say for fangs needed, https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3409/nightsaber-fang -&gt; https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2042/nightsaber -&gt; found where mobs are. Repeat for the other 2.      
---
If we're going to pretend people can't click items and see where they drop, I don't think they'd understand peoples instructions either
---
lvl 44 or so is about halfway
---
You would actually let rng decide who gets such an important item, potentially landing on someone for whom it's completely useless?
---
Because BFA is garbage lmao. I also don't have to agree with some shitbag to like classic.
---
Since they announced classic, I always thought it would be cool for them to release follow up sequels, but have it to where players could choose to move on or not. Like keep their characters in classic, but copy them to the new game if they want to play that one too.
---
There's absolutely nothing stopping you from killing any level mob as any level player aside from ludicrous miss chances. If you have 1000 level 1 players you could do it just fine too. Even a 59 level difference does not make it flat out impossible to damage enemies, and with such numbers you can just GY run them down if absolutely necessary.
---
There's also the fact that ranged weapons are much less affected by level scaling, as they have better hit chances and no glancing blows. You'd be surprised how strong an army of low level hunters in particular is.
---
Yeah, sure they did. That's why they got so much wrong. Do you really think working on code is just trivial to do by watching 2006 videos? With no specifics on armor etc? God this is the stupidest fucking comment I've read all week
---
I think you're mixing up the absolute percentage points as the absolute arithmetic difference compared to a person moving 100%, and the relative speed difference between the two. A person moving at 70% speed is 40% faster than a person moving 50% speed.
---
It also doesn't seem like Asmongold's run animation is being slowed down, which also probably lends to the feeling that it's faster than it should be.
---
99% we're going to WOTLK.
---
I don't think people will ever want cata servers, but the demand for tbc and wotlk will be higher than demand for original classic content I'm almost certain.
---
don't remember doing that quest in vanilla, and don't have beta access so I can't personally say if its right/wrong. But what's wrong about it if multiple people put the same coords for the location of the cave he's in?
---
Could u not pls
---
Sorry about that, added one.
---
Totally agree with you!
---
That's awesome. I love that weird builds like this worked. Good luck!
---
ohhhhhhh I was looking at the quest reward boots
---
He was hesitant about playing an old style MMO now that he's a grown up.
---
But then he tried a private server and watched some beta steams and is excited now.
---
&gt; However, at what point is redesigning an existing expansion such a big undertaking that they consider just releasing small, incremental new content?
---
Almost immediately, and that is why i believe that they wont release expansions. At least not mandatory ones. Instead i think they will release raids tuned to lvl 60 and arena to Classic.
---
You will have lvl 60 tbc/woltk/cata raids and lvl 60 arena at some point in Classic i believe.
---
If i got to dream tho... they would turn it into a "alternate universe" that branches off after Naxx. Where they do original content with Classic in mind.
---
Primarily against other Gnolls.
---
dw man hes just hyper salty he didn't get a beta invite
---
I learned a lot
---
If you go through his Twitter he is a climate change skeptic, private health corporation bootlicker, posts weird shit about mexican vs black baby mortality rates and obviously watches Ben Shapiro “owning” feminists compilations.
---
Cancelled
---
no u
---
damage is low
---
But... I chose Horde...
---
I got in on day 2. I'm not a streamer, big personality, or otherwise notable. Hang in there. Blizzard typically pulls from multiple pools of players for their beta data.
---
Bookmarked it, was just thinking about setting up a timer for it myself yesterday. Now I won't have to! Don't really have any feedback besides that I like it.
---
Thanks!
---
How is this proof, you didn't even login yet???
---
There are tons of quests that aren't easily solo-able so people will still be grouping for those.
---
I think all addons should stay except the ones that were virtually botting doing your rotation for you.
---
Hi, /u/moltenw
---
I saw a comment a day or 2 ago, someone mentioned he said in stream he would start pvp and if it was unbearable he’d reroll to pve.
---
my man thats the patched i quit mop and didnt come back till legion argus .
---
The Nost devs literally discussed openly how many of the values were educated guesses at best, complete spitballs at worst.
---
That's some next level autism right there man... i love it!
---
oof... just because vanilla raiding has tank &amp; spank encounters doesn't mean the raiding, or the encounters, are "objectively bad". what makes raiding "good" or "enjoyable" is a lot more than the complexity of the boss mechanics. simple and complex are not objectively good or bad. i would like to hear examples of "better boss design" at the time though. 
---
&gt; criterias can be established for an objective quality
---
precisely. and this isn't true objectivity in a vacuum, because the criteria themselves are subjective. like i said,
---
&gt; [games] have design goals (aka criteria), and their mechanics can objectively meet those goals. ... but those goals and whether people think the mechanics are good or not are totally subjective.
---
Your spirit animal is anon... theres a good chance you'll be haunting people forever.
---
You should listen to the developer interviews on the podcast Countdown to Classic. It's not a fluke this game is so good, it was made by talented individuals with a real passion for what they were doing
---
So can we use this data to interpret which classes are most sought after for a raid?  Or is this more the result of class composition in general
---
Been saying this since beta was launched my guy , ppl needa chill
---
If they've bought all the Elementium Bars, then yes.
---
I'm not too concerned about that right now, haven't given it enough thought to answer it. I'm still stuck thinking about getting Classic in 3 months.
---
Way back in 2004 I had a 2001 slim dell tower that tried its very hardest, but couldn't keep up in Ironforge. I fell down to the bottom so many times.
---
Yeah, I really only want to play a RP server. I just want people to have real names and not type twitch emotes in chat
---
Gotta get them giblets!
---
They've said they want to factor account age into who gets selected for beta access. My understanding is that they want a fairly even spectrum between vanilla veterans, completely new players, and people somewhere in between, so they can make sure the gameplay experience is good across the board.
---
Glad to people like him are in the beta now.
---
I don't understand the second part of your question, but yes theres only 1-2 hunters high level whereas thered +/-6 mages and priests etc.
---
I don’t understand all this whiteknighting for streamers. 
---
Some streamers like the APES boys, Kargoz who streams on YT of all places, the pserver lads like Payo and Milksteaklol, among others, those boys are all great. 
---
Shit I even like Staysafe to a point cause I know he’s played pservers and I’ve played w him in the past and I’m slightly biased. But the Classiccast people are leeches, especially Tipsout —who is the epitome of a fraud-, people like Towelliee, and TradeChat, who shat on Classic for years. 
---
Nah, man, I’m gonna keep on hating. Because those people have no place in the beta. Asmongold is a turd but at least he drives viewership? Sadly, cause he’s a mongoloid.
---
The game, and also the fun, start at level 1
---
No joke, I'll have to give that a listen. The classic deep dive last blizzcon was super interesting.
---
Yeah, you are wrong
---
Depending on the dungeon you might not even get kicked for ninja looting. Getting to the dwarven council in BRD and taking something from the chest for example.
---
Same thing is happening to me this evening, but it seems to come and go.
---
Verify its not a shadowban using incognito mode.
---
damn. they already killed Wow Classic
---
I don't want 60 raid gear to become obsolete again &amp; flying mounts to be reintroduced.
---
I just want Classic. I don't want TBC. I don't know if that's the minority opinion or not.
---
I hope they frame this up in his office at Blizzard.
---
there's a lot more variation in types of mobs in classic WoW then just melee/caster though.
---
you have to consider mob type (beast/undead/dragonkin/etc)
---
environment(indoor/outdoor)
---
mob density(most AoE is garbage, doesn't exist at all, or has a skill floor that needs to be reached \[mage AoE farming is something you need to be skilled at to pull off effectively\])
---
these are just a few examples, but all of them will directly impact a given class's ability to tackle any zone in the game; some spells only work on mobs of a specific type, some spells only work outdoors, and some classes can't handle pulling more than one or two mobs at a time and surviving. 
---
the combat in classic is notably slower, but it weirdly allows for more stipulation on how details like those mentioned actually impact how you play your character and varies the combat in a way that will keep it more fresh throughout the experience than what your post would suggest
---
an example of this at work is, a Paladin actually gets more out of zones with large groups of undead due to getting access to things like Fear Undead and Exorcism. 
---
A warrior won't feel that difference (outside of Intimidating Shout not working on undead), but will be notably more powerful when acquiring a good weapon (there are a lot of items that break the general powercurve in Classic, an example for Warriors is the Whirlwind Weapon questline, which is able to be completed at level 30 with assistance \[I was able to complete it on my warrior at level 30 with a 50+ friend helping me back in the day\] but grants an item that is comparable to level 40+ weapons and drastically makes those 10 levels a lot easier to tackle). 
---
An example for outdoors vs. indoors are abilities like Entangling Roots are only usable outdoors and can greatly impact a Druid's ability to pull multiple mobs and having a mechanism to CC to victory or otherwise escape.
---
What pets you have as a hunter can majorly change your gameplay- not even necessarily tiger vs. raptor, certain subsets of the same type of beast had straight up better damage than others of their creature type. (EG. some raptors were better than other raptors)
---
The mobs casting or meleeing only tell part of the story, classic had a lot more going on in how you engage in the game that is immediately noticeable and notable.
---
Its worth noting that this video was pre-1.9 paladin talents.
---
if you look at his time on zenjin islands(i believ that is the right name)   you can clearly see the values are wrong.. not sure if he forgot about that already or if hes taking about some mobs specifically
---
I'm at work on my phone so can't link but there's a thread on this forum even from yday or 2 days ago that links to a blue post titled something like "things that aren't bugs" and features that as an example.
---
It could also be that the Cataclysm elite revamp is messing up stuff.
---
From what I can remember, alot of elites in dungeons and in the outdoors were made into non-elites and nerfed, alot.
---
Speculations from my side, but perhaps Blizz should take a look there.
---
That's a perfectly valid opinion, and I think there's also an okay chance for blizz to keep classic servers as is whenever they do whatever it is they decide to do after.
---
But I was just saying in my opinions I think people will want TBC.
---
https://www.isclassicoutyet.com/
---
 Looking to perform well in wPVP and BGs.
---
Please consider the following...
---
Experience: Never played Classic, but I was a decent PVPer when I played retail (2300+). Skill cap doesn't intimidate me.
---
Time: My time will be limited, so I'll have to play semi-casually. I won't be able to grind the highest ranks, so I imagine I would have to supplement my gear by raiding to be any good? That's fine, but raiding is not my priority. 
---
Class:
---
*  I really like stealth, and I'm considering rogue and druid for that alone.
---
*  I've never done much healing, but I'm open to suggestions. It would help if they can do a bit of damage.
---
*  I loved hunters when I was playing, but I see people saying their DPS is so bad that I wouldn't be included in raids. Consequently, my gear might suck. I don't know if that's an issue. 
---
   * Also, I'm sad I won't have stealth on my hunter anymore :(
---
* Casters are on the table, but I would like a fair amount of mobility or kite potential.
---
   *  like frost mage? what else? 
---
* Paladins and warriors are off the table. I just don't like them.
---
Race: I don't care about the lore/fantasy or which faction I am playing. Please suggest the race with the best PvP synergy for the class.
---
Professions: Please suggest the best professions, for leveling and then for 60 PvP. I'm sure endgame will be Engineerig/???.
---
TLDR: Which race/class(spec)/professions will be good for PvP and are not *too* gear dependent?
---
You spelled rouge wrong
---
The 4chan experience.
---
Stop trying to make it more complicated than it is.
---
They obviously invited some streamers to promote the game and get it out to the people, so they can see it and get hyped. That doesn't mean they can't provide actual decent feedback.
---
There's also why people like Perplexity, Monkeynews, Joana and many other players considered 'good' or knowledgeable at the game, got invited. Because they're better at testing the game, than giving the game exposure.
---
All in all, the beta is not only there for the elite people reporting bugs which only the 1% would notice. Otherwise people like Quin69, Tipsout and many other people wouldn't be in the beta.
---
&gt; As for your second example, the enemy location is not wrong. It shows where the mob is in a cave, but Wowhead doesn't have maps of inside the cave, so it gives the location of the mob on the map layer above it.
---
That's wrong. The enemy is not at that location.
---
When spells such as Find Minerals are activated they show as 'buffs' and not as an icon on the minimap, inconsistent with Vanilla WoW.
---
Surprised no one has linked this interview of his:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzsZvWb5_gQ
---
Did anyone have nature resistance? The Cyclonian mob attacks (and all elementals, except earth) do damage in their school of magic, Wind Elementals do nature.
---
&gt;But fuck me
---
Ok.
---
[https://imgur.com/jBaXRtw](https://imgur.com/jBaXRtw)
---
In bear form you can pop mana and health potions and healthstones
---
There are two big things that I like questhelpers for, but neither of them affect my need/desire to communicate with other players.
---
It helps me to path my quests and avoid too many trips back &amp; forth.
---
It helps show me where to find more quests to pick-up since there's so many I always forget a few or forget the level to start them and make unnecessary trips to the quest giver.
---
I still play with others frequently since being grouped makes completing almost any given quest much easier.

Something I'm curious about... So I have two wow accounts on my battle.net account. One is my "new" and active account since 2007, but the other account that was created in early 2005 is my inactive account. I'm curious how their selection system will count me.
---
Did people not understand this?
---
I'm legit interested. Do you get triggered/annoyed reading the stupid shit people write for 'clout' or being funny, in The Barrens chat? It's not like it's targeted specifically at you, so I just fail to see how it annoys you.
---
Not hating, just trying to understand.

The video is from 2007 if you click on it. He means retail back in the day.
---
Hail ! King in the blizzard!!
---
I would pay quite a lot of money to test drive the 2020 version of Tesla Roadster.
---
I have never played WOW in my life, but as an avid Old School Runescape player, I am definitely going to be hopping onto WOW classic.
---
Awesome, thanks :)
---
You're retarded lol
---
Its a trap. Get an axe!
---
The quest is fricking huge. I did it in wrath, and even at 80, it took forever.
---
George foreman or bust
---
&gt; Butt fuck me.
---
FTFY
---
realizing that if you drink enough, the level on mobs will appear lower than it actually is &lt;.&lt;  
---
I plan to do what I used to do back in the day and make bags for new characters. I played MUDs back in the day before WoW, and some of the "help out the new kid" things stuck with me.
---
Just because you're green of envy, that these streamers get invited to closed betas, money and fame doesn't make the marketing tactic bad.
---
It's an extremely good tactic. They save TONS of money, I'm guessing millions for Classic, because of these streamers. Which they instead can invest in the actual development.
---
How is that bad in any way except for that you feel left out because you can't be successful as a content creator or streamer?
---
Ok...
---
I'm not gonna argue about a mobs spawn location, in any case the first comment on the page holds your hand until you're on top of the mob.
---
I'm starting to think you're trolling.
---
I think you auto get all expansions before the most recent one.  I resubbed and can level characters to 110, even though the last expansion I bought was wotlk.
---
Nice pictures!
---
World First Scarab Lord wasn't really a thing. Whichever guild had the most populated server at AQ launch got the mount first, with a linear order of realms based on population after that.
---
Did he get the world first C'Thun kill? Yes.
---
Thank you Omar
---
I'm not in the beta but what i've seen from some clips is that some special enemies seem to be undertuned. Not in general tho.
---
If we want to keep the new garbage addon and macro system. we also get to deal with the consequences.. so either we keep the game broken like this, or we block all modern macro tricks and addon advantages and go back to the old system.
---
I bet you smile whenever someone skips the line in queues.
---
I think you underestimate the number of old players that want to play an old game they miss.
---
Because dad just completed his lvl 60 Paladin mount quest line, and he can do whatever he damn well wishes.
---
Non-classic armor, non-classic zone... you could've just said "ayy lmao quel'serrar" and had the same effect?
---
It's good to be the king.

You can for free. Join a Tesla club, they have test drives on tracks usually.

Man when you’re like mid-high 20s and you get those Triprunner Dungarees, life is so good.

Asmond took SB off his bars and called it useless all day.
---
Cant see why not? It's like a thousand times better than the best pcs from 15 years ago.
---
This is great. Won't need to make an addon to move them now lol
---
Ok great but I only speak English
---
1. Re-create WoTLK's BlackList app.
---
2. Add filter list sharing between friends, guilds, and even whole realms.
---
3. Add an is-streamer filter.
---
4. Watch these people becomes ghosts that no one sees in chat and no one groups with.
---
Same for me. If they announce that RPPVP servers will be added later, I might just reluctantly wait, because I don't want to invest time into a character just to start over again.
---
Shave that shit on your chin.  Try a fucking t-shirt the next time you make a video too.
---
I went to the cinema, movie was just about to start. However, it was full and a long line for this anticipated movie.
---
Was i mad? No, the first people who waited longer than anyone else got their seat and sadly the rest had to wait/go home... meanwhile some asshat that hate the movie and shits on the actor was allowed  to skip the line.
---
I love dwarf error speech, but all the others get muted
---
It's a pretty basic case of basic if not bad design, almost everybody agrees on it, it doesn't necessarily mean the experience is bad or overral raid is bad but bosses are definetely on the weak side.
---
 Crendor is doing it right then.

I got in wave 2. Not a streamer, just a really old account
---
Rename it Classic if you'd like people to use it in Classic. :)
---
Old netcode is scary. There's a reason people recommend not playing Diablo 1 on the internet when it released on gog. Technology has changed. New vulnerabilities are found in software on a daily basis. For example, Most likely whatever ssl library the server/client uses for it's authentication in 2004 has a million holes in it.
---
Software is made up of a bunch of other peoples libraries mashed together and bugs and vulnerabilities are constantly being found in code you didn't write. That's why updating your computer is so important.
---
Ranged attacks cannot be dodged in WoW.
---
Is everyone taking into account that its patch 1.12 as well, and not every video comparison is probably even done in the same patch?
---
Because I've never played private servers but the numbers don't seem all that off to me. But again how am I supposed to remember 15 years later lol
---
You are completely wrong and really need to look into the requirements.
---
One of the requirements is for a quest item that you get from BWL that only ONE person can loot... I am sure you can do the math.
---
Haha fuck off. I am thrilled asmon got in instead of you. Thousands of people are getting a taste of beta instead of just you and your selfish needs. Also, testing glitches and shit is pretty legit AND what they did there creates insane hype because it was awesome.
---
Cool thanks that’s what i was asking.  I’ve been torn between leveling a hunter or mage...i think a mage will give me a better shot at finding raids.
---
Raided with a rogue that used TF for a long ass time, (he joined us after his guild broke up). Never had threat issues with him, and he was an asset to the guild the whole way.
---
Rouge is a color/makeup, Rogue is a scoundrel.
---
Easy there, Satan.
---
You can make your character 15 days before the game comes out?
---
I've seen this video before like a week ago
---
What, you don't like office gifs?
---
This UI is horrendous, I love it
---
what exactly is the problem with this clip? lol
---
Ok fine. Ive added a subscription. i have no intention of playing retail. i hope they didn't just steal my money.
---
Thanks! Looks like I'll edit my route a bit.
---
?
---
Modern client.
---
Fitness wise, I am doing this already, not just for the game but I have used gaming time to get in really good shape. Doing push ups and such during travel breaks , eating clean meals. 
---
Don't need insta pot, meal prep  prior to the launch and you'll be straight.  I figured it I am going to just sit around gaming pretty heavy at the start, I might as well get some bonus out of it.
---
Last time I dropped 32 pounds and got bac "near" my Marines shape, 100% but close, that was at an expansion release. My girl wants to play so I solved that part.
---
They're here now. Reddit is just being funky/laggy.
---
But still, it doesn't nearly require anything remotely close to retail in terms of specs.
---
Probably less then 1%
---
Yup, need a subscription though.
---
Male gnome /train is the main reason I don't play any other race.
---
That + noggenfoggers making me a literal pixel on a PvP server is the dream.
---
I'm a little curious why the original video is posted in 2013?
---
BC was the pinnacle of WoW in design and obviously had far more players than vanilla, I definitely think people will want it. I certainly do. It has remnants of vanilla design philosophy but also is just generally far better to play with vastly superior raiding and more viable specs.
---
what are you talking about ?  This meme is not hating on BFA at all
---
Love how you ended this, thanks for sharing and fuck you Virokai!
---
This is my favorite so far.
---
Uhm it is absolutely a test to check authenticity and bugs is just a minor part of it. Vanilla players should get prio
---
Make direct eye contact with them and start masturbating.
---
Was also wanting to ask about this. Seems like no more invites have gone out since its weekend?
---
Yeah, I'm kinda leaning that way too.  I remember a buddy rolling a priest alt about a year after launch and telling me his renew ticks were enough to keep a competent warrior tank in greens near full health like 90% of the time through 20s dungeons, and I definitely remember having a shaman tank in WC groups a couple times.  And I remember thinking I was having a hard time killing mobs with my rogue in my teens, until I realised I was still using level 3 or so weapons and the game suddenly got easier with the level 15 or so white daggers I found at a vendor.
---
I think people were a lot worse back then.  Most of us didn't have a clue what we were doing early on and that made the game feel a lot harder.
---
No need to be a dick. I misunderstood why you were talking about the armor cap
---
lol Swifty and this guy, these people are just good for promotion and nothing else. These guys are anyways gonna leave the game one the hype is down and go play something else.
---
The question is, could you during 1.12 ?
---
Yeah :). If the site helped  you please give it an upvote- it seems like a lot of people dont know character creation date opens earlier.
---
Male undead with gimp mask for Horde players  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
---
This is a really brave post on this subreddit, I'm glad you felt safe enough to admit it.
---
I used to run tours to old IF and IF airport for 1 gold. One time I got 3 people together, and pretended like I was a tour bus guide. Probably 10 years old at the time.
---
Yes.
---
The unevenness on the bottom row with no seemingly logical reasoning triggers me lol
---
I don't doubt that Classic will have a huge launch, but there's no question the population is going to tank, just like retail does every modern expansion. There's way too much AAA competition these days.
---
&gt; It’s seems that either they’ve fked their reference client somehow or they just are incompetent at testing.
---
I think these are the only conclusions we can reasonably draw at this point. I've always been suspicious of whether or not Blizzard had actually 'backed up' much vanilla data and this suspicion was further cemented when the demo had so many obvious inconsistencies especially when it came to regen values.
---
and that threat reducing buff/seal/whatever! Don't forget about that!
---
"Nobody but me played vanilla, but even if they did, they weren't old enough to remember." Blizz should have picked you up to design the game, for sure.
---
lol wtf
---
There are a lot of reasons the beta differs from all the pserver's. Blizz has the original damage, resist, armor, scaling, and other formulas that pservers can't access. 
---
Pservers head to guess some formulas and variables based on surviving videos and internet archives. This doesn't always account for player gear and stars, resists, buffs, etc. Also a lot of things including tuning changed over the course of vanilla.  Things referenced for pservers may not always be from 1.12, but from previous patches where that thing worked differently. 
---
Pservers did an admirable job.  They created a pretty authentic experience. But we can't rely on them to determine if classic is correct, as pservers aren't, either. 
---
Somebody has all of the 1.12 source, and it isn't any pserver, for what it's worth.
---
LOL that's ridiculous
---
Yeah it's pretty gross how this sub reacts to everything. Especially given that Quinn is already pretty trolly.
---
You got banned for that!? I’ve been lucky all these years.
---
"whatever, im worthless" - Zuggzychan
---
missed your videos my man
---
Will it just let you login into the character creation screen but no further?
---
Ghost Wolf was what made me choose a shammy originally in vanilla and it's a pretty damn tempting reason to do it again.
---
I agree I have seen the spam ThIs SuB iS sO tOxIc NoW! posts all day but yet to see one.
---
I thought those tigers were off when I saw them, just like most other things around those levels. Why, and better yet even HOW is this possible if they have the authentic 1.12.1 database? I'm starting to wonder if they use a TBC, or WOTLK database that had all this stuff nerfed because didn't they nerf vanilla content both when TBC came out, and again in WOTLK?
---
This really depends on what level you go into the dungeons. If the mobs are within 2 levels of your tank it's generally pretty easy even more so if hes higher then the mobs. If you try those same mobs with a tank whos 3 or 4 levels under the mobs it became a very different battle.  
---
I'm not saying that everything is correct in the beta, but what I'm talking about made a HUGE difference in vanilla wow for damage taken.
---
Here's my own anecdotal experience without having played on a private server:
---
\-I remember having to eat after every mob as a warrior while leveling pre-20(I gave up on my warrior lol), fighting more than one at a time meant death. 
---
\-I remember in dungeons CC's being absolutely necessary. Even with CC it was dicey in some area's. Remember the big trash pull at the top of the stairs right before The Beast? 
---
\-I remember on my main(Rogue) basically not having Bandage off cooldown.
---
\-I remember 'waiting' for regen'd health simply took too long.
---
This is from the Alexstrasza server where people were mostly dungeon geared, but no Horde guild had killed Vael.
---
Trying to decide between prot war or holy Paladin or holy priest... main goal is just 5 man dungeons
---
I actually got a beta invite yesterday I cannot believe it. Of course I’m out of town until tomorrow but cannot wait. I don’t think I got a BfA alpha but I always wasn’t checking.
---
When you put it this way, the 1-30 beta is only 25% of the game
---
/drool
---
Oh look another undead male rogue/mage....
---
It's a shame.  I lurk here more than anything. People get so worked up over shit. I'm 39, I played WoW at launch. I'm stoked to play, and I'm stoked for others to play. 
---
It's a shame people are so panicked that their experience might be somehow "tainted" because they see something posted online and suddenly that is reality for them. I'm just looking forward to Vanilla WoW with my buddies.
---
I am warning you! If you touch my World of Warcraft Classic, I will stab you in the neck, with a knife!
---
Oh go cry about it mate. Keep the politics off of this subreddit.
---
My first go through, I used carbonite. I still chatted and asked things because, honestly, the game confused the hell out of me. I'd never played anything like it and got lost SO easy. This time around, I'll be either addonless or close to it (if bejeweled comes back, they might as well just preinstall it for me), but I'll get to answer those questions and not get overwhelmed by alsp not understanding a lot of other core gameplay mechanics etc. That said, I really don't want many add-ons at all in the game.
---
Nope, it was not by 1.12
---
I better get a Beta invite in return for it lol!
---
Good stuff!
---
not only the raidgroup was cursed I guess....
---
You will find both types of players. Some people will laugh at you for not playing the game the way they do, while some people won't care as long as they have a good time while playing with you.
---
If you should keep looking at youtube videos is probably up to how you like to play your games. Do you like finding things out on your own, or do you prefer knowing what the best strategy for everything is before you ever encounter it in-game? If I was a fresh player I would avoid too much min-max info before I played, since I enjoy discovering the mechanics of new games on my own and rather look things up if I cant figure it out.
---
Stop looking. As a semi-casual player from ‘05-‘09 and then on and off since, my favorite memories come from the blind exploration and experimentation. I’m rolling a different class than I did before and the temptation to read everything until I can’t no more (Hi, OTR) is wild, but I’m forcing myself to save it until I can enjoy it. I believe that reading stuff and watching streams/videos will make me feel pressure that will kill the game for me.

---
My hunch is Blizzard probably reaches out to you on Twitter or something if they are interested, but I don't think tweeting them does any good either.
---
 I imagine the PR email probably just gets shoved in some spam folder that never gets read or replied to.
---
I would hope they just make classic, tbc, and wotlk servers.  People can just go to whichever xpac they enjoyed the most.
---
Some things in private servers do way too much damage and use their abilites more often then vanilla. For example in BRD i found on nost that the dwarves from the bridge did WAY too much damage compared to what they did in vanilla. While the fireguard destroyers which were insanely hard pulls (basically had to spam heal to kill 2 at once) were complete jokes.  
---
But yeah most things in classic didn't need cc esp leveling dungeons. UBRS pulls it was pretty needed but other then that as long as your warrior was good at tab sundering and realized that he doesn't need to tank every single mob in the pull ( focus a caster first and interrupt it) it was pretty easy to do w/o cc.
---
I played wow for over 5 years back in 2006 and I was so hyped to see this hidden content Ive never seen before. The game was full of secrets back then :)
---
Of course, the other reason world first levellers don't do dungeons would be that it would be impossible to find tanks and healers of equivalent level...
---
I have 50+ on my rogue in retail, arena1-2-3 macros take a lot of keybinds.   But I also had 5 full keybinded bars on TBC (can’t remember vanilla that clearly) which is 60 keybinds.
---
I honestly don't remember damage numbers at all for anything since it was so long ago. I do remember that my first WC run we made it to Verdan and he hit like a truck. We wiped and then had trouble getting back to the dungeon. I wish we would stop comparing pservers to the beta. It might be going a bit far to just say trust Blizz and let them do what they're doing.
---
Blizzard is being silly picking and choosing what is vanilla and what isn't and now they bring retail philosophy into Classic. I wanted vanilla, we all did and we're getting something that truly looks like it but is far from it. Some will say we're grasping at straws but a mount is so important it can't be allowed in till like phase 3? Ok.
---
It won't be the exact same since many of the players will know a lot more and be better than they were back in the day, but it still will be fun and I think there will be more new players than we'd assume
---
except clips of the present vs past prove there is a difference. Could just be related to mobs early on, or maybe there's some inconsistent bug happening in the background that's causing it
---
Well, I never said anything myself, but if you stream you are opening yourself up for criticism, it comes with the territory and the trade off is possible income.  So if you do something stupid, anyone from everyone has the right to blast ya
---
They fixed them on a case by case basis, but Kazzak was definitely chained before 1.12.
---
Teach me how to be okay with being a casual player.  I'm really struggling.  I find myself mostly frustrated and not really able to engage in at least somewhat challenging content as a casual player.  
---
I'm working 60hours each week and have a 7 month old.  The hours are 5am to 3pm Mon thru Sat and then the wife wants my time on Sunday.  I'm running on fumes here and classic wow has always been kind of a beacon to look forward to.  But now that it's almost here I find I'll slowly level to 60 to probably not make raids because finding a guild that raids sat/sun is almost impossible.  Normal people want their weekends free for irl fun.  
---
As someone who's done vanilla to death on Pservers the raids are really the thing I enjoy most and now they seem so far away .  I'm not sure how to find joy in an mmo now with so little time to invest.  Back before life got hard I was an 8-12 hour per day eq / wow player but Egh ....now, casual scum.
---
Quests give more xp, but less percentage of a level than earlier levels.
---
Also don't forget a lot of Vanilla world zones had quests added in TBC, there are significantly less quests in classic than many people may actually realize.
---
The private server community is known for generally being quite unfriendly. This sub right now gets alot of shit for "hating".
---
You're not gonna get the same nostalgia experience that other people will get, however you will get an experience that most people would pay alot of money for, which is to experience Classic going in blind.
---
Enjoy it, make friends and have fun!
---
I'm actually a bit sad now. :(
---
For those who don't know, Kevin Jordan was one of the original game developers of WoW.
---
And a minor
---
Personally, I'm going in blind as a bat for Classic. I won't be using any guides or build paths. As long as I'm having fun doing what I'm doing, I'll continue to learn the game at my own pace and learn from other players by asking questions. However, I may use a guide for a specific quest if I've been at it for a couple hours and can't seem to find a place or NPC. My advice, play how you want to play and have fun with it. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of the community will be willing to work with you. There will probably be a small percentage of impatient assholes but hey, that's the internet for ya!
---
I played from early 2005 until 2016. Not too long before the announcement I tried out a preserver to see if it could scratch that vanilla itch or if it really was just rose colored glasses.
---
All the old feels came back. It really was like I remembered. I leveled 2 hordies to 30ish by the time classic was announced. 
---
It really is that good. The way you are affected by these details watching them is legit! You'll have fun.
---
This needs a lot more up votes
---
I played pre-release on hacked clients and mid-way through BC before I had to quit due to it affecting my life.  
---
I always thought it would be really cool to see these "secret" places used as "hidden" dungeons with unique sidegrade items.
---
The vocal minority
---
Kazzak was but not normal mobs and Teremus.

Okay stop now, you're being pathetic and it's making me sad.

&gt;Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.
---
Apparently they think it's fine, when literally anyone that has played vanilla knows casts fail if you're not facing the 180 deg arc towards the target.
---
Ion Hazzikostas: "... an engineer named Omar Gonzalez, who is on the Classic team, tried the method of taking the modern client, the modern server and teaching it to interpret the old 1.12 classic data. He kind of locked himself away for a few weeks, and came out with something that was a prototype--it was very rough, contained tons of bugs, the world wasn't fully rendered, but it was the original classic world, pre-Cataclysm.
---
when u have a bad day but u give a streamer some money from dads wallet and they say ur name
---
That's basically where we are at. It's been shown the majority of people playing on private servers are below the age of 21, meaning they weren't playing Classic when it was current. They simply have no framework to base anything on, and because Nost was so huge everyone just silently agreed that Nost's core was near close to authentic as you can get.
---
So not any mobs that could destroy a city and require a GM to fix. NBD.
---
Maybe at least for the main just go totally add-on free, then for alts go nuts :p
---
Depends if their goal is server first 60 or worlds fastest 60, worlds fastest 60 doesn't require a fresh server while server first does. I'm not sure if Joana's record was set on a fresh server or not, but I know he did enjoy rolling on fresh servers whenever they were available to go for server first. Speed runs is his thing so he did both, but what he did on older servers might have just been practice for fresh servers.
---
On spot!
---
Level 60 and raids aren't in beta?
---
Hand crafted gear instead of ilvl generated garbage. This is harder to do with the amount or specs that need specific secondary stats but not impossible .  running a dungeon / raid for a specific item felt really good.  Now it's about 75 percent generated and if it doesn't titanforge you don't even look at the thing.  Then there was the azerite trait debacle that caused even well statted good ilvl gear to be downgrades. Bfa gearing was madness.
---
Despite making up only 13% of the Kingdom's Somewhat Intelligent population, Gnolls are responsible for over 50% of violent attacks.

Do you know how it works on release, will you start over or continue on 30 levels ahead? My guess is you'll have to restart but I'm not sure.
---
Master race
---
It was his one shot macro. 
---
Braindead or not, somehow, he was one of the first to show off the Warrior macros.
---
Thats mainly the larger streamers, Joana is actively reporting bugs.
---
I think it’s very important to discuss these things. In the future we ARE going to run out of content. There’s no debating it.  I’ve actually been thinking about about the future of Classic, and personally I would like either two things.
---
People have been talking about seasons, which I’d totally be down for.  After a set amount of time, everything resets and starts from the beginning again.  I feel like that’s a good way to combat the content drought while still keeping things the same.
---
The second thing that I personally would think is the best is taking the Old School Runescape route.  I would absolutely love if they developed new content while still keeping things feeling like classic.  Now I know this is controversial, and I’m always up to discuss things, but I am not too fond of the story in BC.  Don’t get me started on retail’s story.  I would love it if they actually developed a proper story with BC and reset everything from the start.  That’s just my opinion though.
---
The blizzard beta announcement literally specifics you have to be subbed to get in.
---
public company\*
---
Don’t care. Still rolling one.
---
Thinking that'll be my plan too after this, just going through it as it comes.
---
Threat issue for Rogue? You know they have Vanish, right?
---
So the name creation 3 days early thing. Think I can snag asmongolds name on whatever server he says he’s going on and get all the goat lewtz?
---
I honestly thought this was a picture of my hunter dead zone, game hadn’t even started and I’m getting nightmares haha
---
WoW nerds can be extremely toxic, as you can see on this subreddit. But, also, the fact is millions of people play the game but only 100k have been here to make the community seem trashy. And as for pservers, yeah, a lot of "pro players" of a 15 year old game haunt those places and let out their life frustrations ingame.
---
As for Classic, only a fraction of the players that are invested enough to be talking about the game months before release reach that level of annoyance. Its the internet and angry people are always louder then those who are chill, for obvious reasons. You'll meet more chill ppl ingame i'm sure.
---
So don't let it bum you out. The levelling experience is great. Last time i got a character to level 60 (on a pserver), i had my loot stolen once. 
---
Besides that, some cases where people would wait to tag a quest mob or a chest that was amongst other mobs. And of course, World PvP. But i've done my share of that aswell.
---
Not really, you want to be in melee range more than any other class in PvP as warrior
---
I hate that UI so much. Take my upvote.
---
I work 50 hours with a 1 1/2 year old and another on the way. I maybe have like 2 hours to game a day (if my wife is okay).
---
I’m just creating a guild with a couple of other buddies that have careers, kids, wives, homes, etc. and we’re creating a guild to be a casual/moderate raiding guild that will raid on Friday’s or Saturdays.
---
I’m sure there will be TONS of casual-moderate raiding guilds this time around on any server that you roll.
---
Also, have you thought about talking to your wife? Make sure to give her a heads up that this is a hobby that you’d love to enjoy spending time playing. My wife was pretty understanding and is going to be pretty backed off until I hit 60 with my main. Once hitting 60 my time requirements are a lot less intensive.

The harpy was an extra addition edit mate.  The original post is about the tigers, 1-3 damage vs 5-7.  It's more than a 200% difference, mate.    Why would you cherry pick my post just to try to make that point?
---
Hogger, I’m just a new wow player in 2005 at a young age, go easy on me. So pumped to play a challenging wow leveling experience. Tried bfa again today, logged off after 10 minutes.
---
companies make decisions based on what improves their revenue, big woop
---
this is awesome, thanks!
---
Perplexity posted this bug a couple days ago
---
I didn’t even watch it but this shit made me laugh
---
Yea but how old is your WoW account?
---
He can tank 5 five FIVE gorillas!
---
I check here for news daily and that's it. There's literally nothing for us to talk about anymore besides how were not playing the beta.
---
Only reason I'm still on this sub is so I can see when beta waves go out. It's easier than just twitter searching "Classic WoW Beta" there will be a post here that moves up to the top fast when a new wave goes out, so I know when to check my launcher.
---
so he can beg for subs and donations to be in his guild like he did with bdo???? heheh
---
can confirm tweeting doesnt do anything. Tried the #betaforboosh movement with no prevail.
---
Awww that sucks. :(
---
Tony Stark is alive!
---
Technically inaccurate. WoW launches at 12 Midnight CEST (UTC +2), so your count will be 2 hours slow.
---
Damn, why isn't joana working in academia? He can arrive at absolute truth based on intuition? That's insane!
---
Playing blind will not be frowned upon, if you are on reddit and watch videos/twitch you‘re likely beyond the average experience by now!
---
So, keep enjoying it, personally sucking up all the Info there is has been very enjoyable for me but you do you! The first content tier will be really forgiving anyway, take your time. :)
---
On Retail my aussie friend complains about how dark it gets in Boralus, and how she has no option to turn it off. That made me finally realize why they made nights so bright. I love seeing it dark when I wake up early, but I imagine that gets old when you ONLY play then
---
Watched it live! I think that summary is correct.
---
It doesnt annoy me, I dont reslly pay any attention to it.  but I can fully understand how it can annoy others.
---
As long as we get Classic Wow I’ll be happy
---
Decursive absolutely worked in 1.12. [Here's the repo](https://github.com/Zerf/Decursive).
---
Stands to reason most people on this sub are somewhat diehard Classic fans, which is kind of a niche passion. Niche groups tend to be more toxic, due to feeling marginalized, or whatever reason. And when the topic is a nerdy video game, well, that's when the magic really happens.
---
[Here ya go!](https://youtu.be/tFjaLhsZ3KI)
---
I love this lol
---
[Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k5K4a-teWo) he was referencing when watching this, happens towards the end.  Also worth a watch!
---
I love being nostalgic about ye olden times. I have fond memories of every expansion. But if I actually sit down and THINK BACK, I unearth all of the bad. I assume I'm not the only one who does that
---
So? It won't work in Classic 1.13
---
Do you truly think that they took away a normal person’s beta invite to give it to a streamer? No. It’s just extra publicity, which is good for the game.
---
How do you figure? In Classic even 40 people can be enough of an influence - because they can form a raiding guild; and raiding guilds forming/splitting can absolutely change the community of a server. It can motivate or unmotivate people to play, it can change the sale of consumables and thus the economy. At least that was my experience in Vanilla/TBC.
---
really poor audio
---
Thank you omar 🙏
---
Everywhere you go you will find unpleasant people.  
---
My plan is to find a grown up guild and ignore chats that ain't guild chat if my fear of a generally unpleasant and unmanaged player base becomes true. If blizzard has CMs making sure toxic behaviours are punished, then there is nothing to worry about because immature players will have a leash holding them back from being pricks.
---
But that one dollar now may not get you fired by the shareholders/parent company at the next meeting.
---
Right now I'm running these, with some minor errors that can be ignored:
---
Chatter
---
BugSack/BugGrabber
---
ItemPriceTooltip
---
SellJunk
---
bdCore/bdTooltips
---
Most are for retail, though I think ItemPriceTooltip is old as hell. Works great so far.
---
Van cleef also did nothing wrong
---
Another thread where people don't know how stocks works. Sony, EA, Nvidia, etc are going to bankrupt soon if everyone follows your logic. lmao
---
Kazzak was, yeah.  But no other mob was at the time.  You could still kite the felguards from the area, teremus and other mobs.
---
Teremus and the Blasted Lands Felguards still worked in 1.12
---
Premades use a combination of mages and druids to run flags.
---
Unless they cut their own legs off like with mangler / selo, tlps usually have a healthy pop thru pop and waddle along through oow.  DoN is an incredibly shit xpac and most guilds don't make it.  TSS is a high note but then there are just so many garbage xpacs until seeds / Thule which are actually really good but tlps never make it to them.  Has a lot of similarities to wow xpacs with high notes and oceans of shit.
---
it's almost as if there's loads of factors that can play into how raw data values are interpreted when moving heaps of data from a decade old client to a more modern one.....
---
crazy thought really
---
Oh please, there is nothing wrong with doing something for the money, the way you do it and to which limits is what matters (not breaking laws or abusing caveats for shitty conditions like epic games lately for example)
---
I hope they decide to release it early. It would make a big difference to kids summers to be able to play for a whole 2 months before school. Wow doesnt need to worry too much about the success or failure of this game because its a classic release its sure to have a strong playerbase of old school fans
---
Have you participated in any prior betas?
---
Do you have any other resolutions if this image% I'm trying to do some very complicated calculations with it.
---
I'll post the proof
---
I've been listlessly drifting from game to game with old standbys like Overwatch filling the gaps between.
---
Subnautica, Kingdom Hearts 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, been digging Mordhau recently.
---
Sure, cause I imagine everyone is just tweeting at BlizzardCS demanding to be put into beta.
---
Plus, I imagine you have to be big enough, and even then, they would probably just literally DM you on twitter since that's a big way game devs contact and seek out people to test their games and such. "Hey, interested in WoW Classic Beta? If so, what's your battlenet email and we'll flag you?"
---
I highly doubt there is anyone directly that can be tweeted to that will assist you. I've seen even some big streamers that still aren't in just going "How do I get in the beta."
---
All of this already exists in many addons. For hunters there was Ammo-matique.
---
Mostly I just play with myself.
---
I think all of us understand what you’re saying and while most of us probably do wish we had that “one guy” or girl who’s actually a content king and super knowledgeable, we don’t expect the whole platform to be like that. I see through a lot of the bs most of these streamers spew but sometimes it’s just simply more fun to not take it super seriously. It’s like watching stupid reality television that’s based on something you actually enjoy, Warcraft etc.
---
Ok. How do I get that?
---
Eh, I’ll probably still minmax things but I’ll also play stuff I just enjoy playing.
---
"No changes"
---
Hey bro, I saw ur obs + xbox in game chat post a while ago.
---
I've the same problem. Did u fix it? Thanks for help!
---
Haha! Made me chuckle.
---
I just play league and CS, everything is shitty right now compared to a game released in 2004
---
I resubbed (hadn’t been subbed since the month bfa released) and got invited the next day. I have had the account and played since vanilla release
---
Hopefully new content
---
What if I'm so post modern I started in the actual vanilla beta?
---
First of all that's outside BFD not 2 elites inside SFK. Second of all he uses retal and a potion and still almost dies. This isn't under tuned or insane. Levels make a tremendous difference and he's 4 ahead of one and 5 ahead of another.
---
I love his Tony Stark beard. So based.
---
You mean one of the features in [Ammo-matique](https://www.wowace.com/projects/ammo-matique)?
---
helpful guide, thanks. Still debating if I should grind this.
---
Glad to hear a cata boy being let in. My hopes have dwindled seeing everybody who get in saying they've played since 04 or 05. My whole family is signed up, so I hope at least one of us get in! Our earliest account is only early 07
---
Or just use another monitor.
---
Because of the wait, it instantly made the games I play boring  now. I play World of Warships/wot for 7 years, rocket league I just started it's pretty fun, but aggro to learn. CoH already bored of it, even though i love the game. Since they gave us everything there is no real progression.
---
It's 15 year old raids with very simple mechanics, they would have to change a lot for it not to be facerolled. Also there are private only server stuff that makes some stuff easier like world buff stacking etc.
---
Why cant we swap gear in combat tho? /s
---
Exactly how I feel.
---
Why are we acting like this was about going into PRODUCTION?
---
He was talking about spinning up legacy code as if it was inherently impossible and dangerous.
---
I literally said they were great.
---
Classic is using 1.12.2, there was no 1.13. And the client is using the modern 8.0 API, in which Decursive also works.
---
Suuuuure. Except, you know, no one is gatekeeping anything at all. You just flat out don't understand the phrase.
---
fkn noob
---
Exploration into unreleased content was one of my fav things in classic
---
What is wrong with this clip? The item is supposed to 5 armor and 25/25 durability?
---
these 3 months are gonna be worse than the wait for release announcement, but can't wait for the great times to be had again!
---
Nova Launcher

Learn what kind of RAM stick your laptop takes and search for it by generic classification instead of your computer model specifically.
---
I did this and found my RAM upgrade on ebay for 1/3 the price of the ones listed under my laptop model.
---
I have a nice desktop now but I still want the laptop to run Classic for LAN fun and if a friend comes over who doesn't have one. 
---
My laptop has similar specs to you (intel graphics......) and doesn't run retail super smooth by any means but upgrading to 10gb of RAM made it playable.
---
I know your account name and from the pixels I was also able to decrypt your password. All your epics are belong to me now.
---
This guy seems to know what’s going on?
---
Playing Persona 5 for the first time and overwatch in between.
---
Finally a real topic on this sub
---
Man, I really hope that StrangleThorn is just a giant thunderdome like it was in the good old days
---
how dare he not have a perfect memory of all game mechanics 14 years ago
---
I checked earlier today and I was in. I didn't have an invite when people started to stream it, but this is the first time I've checked since then.
---
* When did you opt in? The day before the beta was released
---
* Are you a content creator? No.
---
* How long has your sub been active? Since at least 2015
---
* Are/were you actively playing BFA? Yes (but very casually)
---
* Location(EU/US/etc) US-West
---
* When was your account created? 2004
---
* Did you play vanilla? Yes, day one and played the beta before that.
---
&gt; Tips is an idiot
---
He certainly is an idiot and a fraud. 
---
It's a shame that guy is leading the charge for us in this endeavor.  In another clip I just watched, he made a bug report for a missing "sack of supplies," one of like 50 that probably spawn, because he swore there was one on a pservers... thanks tips!
---
=(
---
This seems like a change I might want
---
This is a really good question. Contact CS and ask them. This situation is very specific.
---
Ok mrs ancap
---
Eh, I think the context was this sub hates on streamers but loves Joana, so him reporting a bug reported by streamers whom this sub seems to hate means that the sub is blind to the streamers they hate doing right and focusing on Joana doing right.
---
I don't really care, but the big streamer hate is kinda tiring.
---
No changes!
---
He is mentioning having to sell his gaming house, did he split up with his wife recently or something.
---
That’s a female though.
---
if you build it they will come
---
Yes... you do all of that BEFORE you bang the gong. You need to do all that to get the scepter. Once you have the scepter you just need to bang the gong within a few hours after the first bang to get the mount.
---
My guilds main tank at the beginning of Wrath was still playing on a Windows 98. The games settings could go so unbelievably low.
---
I genuinely don't think streamers will get scarab lord. Typically the types of people who fawn over streamers aren't what you would call elite players. The best players in the best guilds will be getting the mount... I doubt the likes of asmon will actually get a guild good enough to clear bwl.
---
Not sure your experience with vanilla, but I would get your quests for each dungeon (I believe most have at least a few or more) and run each dungeon once to complete them. Then go explore the world through questing. It’s the best way for xp/hr and to really immerse yourself. 
---
It is also going to take quite a while to get to 60 so do your best to enjoy it and make memories.
---
How is persona 5? Not really into that style but hear it’s good.
---
I feel the same way. Maybe it’s because pre 60 is much more straightforward. You don’t have to look up some pre-bis list or have to have raised a ton to even compete with a lot of people. I always found endgame content really overwhelming and had no idea how to go about it.
---
I should add before I get down voted to oblivion. I really like asmon and other streamers... I find the memeing mostly entertaining :)
---
Oh right, in the physical sense sure, it's much more lenient than some other genres in terms of input precision/speed. There's still a *lot* going on at any given moment though, on the mental level tab target MMOs tend to skew on the more intensive side since they typically have deeper pool of spells etc to pull from. For example BDO has much more intensive input requirements, but there's a bit less volume of things to keep track of at any given moment. 
---
Getting to the point where you can just intrinsically understand and account for spell CDs and tells for shifts in pacing takes a *long* time. It's not something you can just do without a shit ton of practice and experience, that's where the real gap is and it's definitely not something everyone is capable of.
---
Just quit playing league because of how toxic it is, looking for something else now but just working on wow playlists and getting hyped. Might be a new switch game but who knows :(
---
When did we start talking TBC? Also yes I think TBC was awesome minus flying
---
&gt; disengage for its intended purpose 
---
what does disengage have to do with dead zone?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6BYzLIqKB8
---
Thank you so much, i didnt know i could cjange ram on laptop
---
I mean it literally has to be in the game, doesn't it? One of the main hunter quests in the game relies heavily on the mechanic.
---
Unless there is some code in the newer engine (that they started with when importing the old data) that adjusts output off of the database that they haven't found yet.
---
Dad is hella crunchy lookin lmao
---
That would be amazing.
---
If I had a chance to play my favorite video game for a living I would do it in a heartbeat.
---
And the "rest of us" don't all work 9-5s. Some of us do shift work labor and work much shittier hours like 4am-noon or worse, since you wanna act so high and mighty.
---
Lol where has this been shown?
---
Going to have to post as a separate comment since reddit is scuffed and not showing new posts/replies for some reason but your original reply did go through. Reddit's just having an aneurysm I guess.
---
For a long time now I have been in a zombie like state of mind when it comes to games. Nothing satisfies the crave. Everything is bland and tasteless. I get no thrill or motivation to play anything.
---
This is exactly what I want. Horizontal content that's preserves the core gameplay
---
OSRS without updates has/had a much smaller timeframe (except for the people going for highscore ranks)
---
While I have no doubt that classic will also die out, it will take until the end of naxx for that to happen, which is at least 2 years down the line. OSRS was less than a year. 
---
People will get bored of the game because it gets stale without any updates. They have 3 choices, and I'm positive they'll do one or two of these 3;
---
* Fresh servers after Naxx (with the original server still playable for those that obviously want to keep playing their characters)
---
* TBC servers (with or without the ability to copy your character over)
---
* Post Naxx progression (hopefully bi-lateral and not upgrades - to reduce power creep)
---
I personally think the first 2 are highly likely to happen, while the 3rd one would be the most exciting for me personally (being an osrs player myself). Regardless of which option they choose, I believe they will always have the original classic with people's original characters even long after people have cleared naxx.
---
Private server Vanilla and messing around on Thai Air.
---
They may be later but atm the level cap is 30. They want to focus testing in certain areas instead of everybody leveling to 60 for the next month
---
You had a widescreen monitor in 2005? Are you Bill Gates?
---
that water elemental was auto'ing for 30 damage
---
that is not right, at all. It's not even an auto reduced by armor because it's frost damage. Paladin doesn't have frost protection aura up, that shit is broke as fuck.
---
yeah no one needs the negativity man I was just trying to spread the positivity thats going on his channel right now
---
This is freaking sweet
---
My girlfriend never played Vanilla. I got her to hear me out and watch some videos of old school WoW and got her actually super interested. She got on Reddit, started following this sub, and came away that anyone who played Vanilla were a bunch of pretentious asshats. I simply replied,” Pretty Much.”
---
he said he couldnt afford it anymore
---
Easy enough
---
You're playing with maybe 1/50th the actual population of a live server*.  Quest mobs and profession nodes won't be as available at you're seeing them now.  
---
* Don't check that math but you get my point.
---
Hi, /u/dazedpenguin1111
---
league atm just not caring and losing rank :D as i wont play another game once classics out for quite some time :D
---
&gt; plan to get 60 within the first week
---
wouldn't happen even if you were the best leveler in the world on a completely empty server
---
Appear offline does not make you disappear from the guild roster in retail btw. Friend of mine is in offline mode a lot and I see em log in and show up in the guild roster while being offline in battle.net.
---
As for the rest, I'm not in beta :(
---
Afaik it starts off pretty slow and is utilised for buffs, auras, etc. at first but then once your stats and tier gear starts increasing it becomes fairly competitive in terms of HPS.  
---
Also, don't quote me on it but I'm pretty sure there's no OOC resing in dungeons/raids in classic.
---
The neck beards here are absolutely ridiculous. The presumption they have that it will be the norm to have played 5000+ hours on private server and everyone else doesn’t deserve the game is ridiculous. The cries and declarations are so cringey, especially the vitriol slung about streamers. If this sub’s community was an actual significant part of the classic experience it will be on life support HOTS status in 2 weeks.
---
Popular private servers actually buff the droprate of items, particularly early on.
---
No, he sold it because he couldn't afford it anymore and make a profit. He had an expense of $4k/mo that included a 1k electrical bill, $600 cleaning service, and a mortgage, etc. Therefore he moved into his mom's house that is paid off, since she moved out to a closer location at her job and now he's working on Gaming House 4.0 downsized to max 2 Hall of famers. He mentioned the decline of viewers on Twitch.tv on the World of Warcraft section was a part of lower income.
---
Been playing a lot of Rocket League lately.
---
They mention it [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) at the end of the article.
---
My GF and I are good either way with our rigs (especially with Classic using the old art assets and stuff), but I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for testing this out though, this is good info.
---
Oof, that's definitely not right. Have a video by chance?
---
yeah these kind of "lol this is wrong" posts should just be removed if they have no info at all
---
Other felt fake to me but this one seem legit.
---
Private servers are not accurate to vanilla wow.
---
a couple years ago I remember on the WoW general forums somebody asked who Kungen was
---
I explain that Kungen was the guild leader and main tank of Nihilum which secured World first C'thun, Kel'thuzad almost all TBC world firsts and WoTLK world firsts.  linked his armory to show he had Scarab Lord title etc.. etc..
---
Modern WoW player on general forums response?  
---
"lol he only has 17k achievement points.  hes not good"  
---
Now is Kungen the best player ever?  no, not at all.   but to say  hes no't good just based off achievement points shows how little brain modern WoW forum goers are.
---
Go to Bbaron on youtube and hes playing the beta, he tested it in dm and it worked
---
Private servers
---
I am newer around here , but  I feel that the toxic comes from people just ready to play bringing out the sourness if you will lol. Some are just toxic, but I love this sub too.
---
Wish I could say I'd be one. But my homies we're going alliance and I wanna play with them, and since one is going pally I can't do that. So I'm running priest. But shammies def have my respect tho
---
Both games require time investment to hit cruise control. Once you hit cruise control the time needed to farm stuff is actually pretty comparable between. The time needed to hit cruise control though is much greater in vanilla
---
Maybe they patched it then. It was like that for awhile in BfA.
---
I am a priest extensively, but anyone who says paladins aren't great healers is insane! Paladins are the best PvP healers defensively due to all their utility and they never oom. They are wonderful in PvE for these exact same reasons. Especially once you reach a nice spell crit threshold, you quite literally will have too much mana to know what to do with. Because of this, it would not be fair to do as much raw healing as a priest for example, but where I can only throw out a few greater, flash, and regular heals, you can spam flash of light repeatedly for an entire fight and theoretically not ever have to even look at your mana bar
---
It's sad you have misplaced hate towards people who don't deserve it, and hate towards others in general
---
saw a group on stream kite the elite rare dragon in Hillsbrad to tarren mill on the beta
---
Shroud has been playing shaman on his stream
---
Shroud dude! he's maining Shaman for beta and launch, his guild is giving him Sulfuras for it too.
---
LH
---
Live will have layer to reduce the amount of players in a world.
---
Also I could observe the respawn rates to be very rapid inside the jasperlode mine.
---
With the optimizations to models in WoD, terrain in Legion, particles constantly throughout the years. I really wish someone from the beta gave numbers, but it SHOULD run like a gosh dang NASA computer, those optimizations were INSANE when they released
---
&gt;Also, don't quote me on it but I'm pretty sure there's no OOC resing in dungeons/raids in classic.
---
Is it because it was removed after a certain patch and we'll be playing on a patch beyond that? That makes sense. We're playing 1.12 right?
---
I def remember OOC ressing in MC, but I'd totally believe they removed it in a later patch, etc. 
---
&gt;Afaik it starts off pretty slow and is utilised for buffs, auras, etc. at first but then once your stats and tier gear starts increasing it becomes fairly competitive in terms of HPS.
---
Yeah, this is more along the lines of what I remember.
---
I’ve been playing private servers to get a dell for the game. I’m pumped for release
---
Also human reputation is great, but spirit is not really an important factor for holy paladins. Stoneform is so valubale. Blind, wyvern sting, viper sting etc.
---
If you see a Troll Priest yelling, "Someone call for de' doctor?!", you'll know who I am in game :D
---
kinda curious if everyones leveling slower on beta compared to private server, how come mobs are easier to kill AND tank?       
---
Doesn't make much sense does it?       
---
But also private servers I feel like just throw early bags at you compared to actual vanilla.         
---
Also be prepared to get shit on waiting for respawns once theres a ton of people trying to get a named mob without dynamic respawns :D
---
Paladin is considered the strongest healer in game. Very strong in PvP as well.
---
During vanilla all the paladins would wear full plate. Full plate had awful itemization for the most part. Probably why he thinks they were bad healers.
---
Warrior is the best class in the game, hands down.
---
layering would only do so much though, you're still going to compete against a high number of people with old respawns. that is until we know the specific numbers on layering / caps etc
---
I honestly think you'll run it fine. I've yet to see any beta info on how well the client runs, sadly I forgot to check that out during the Demo. But considering 15 years of optimizations without the 15 years of increased graphics (remember you can disable the new graphics) it SHOULD run a-okay. 4 gigs of ram is plenty despite what others are saying, I only chug that much ram in Retail WoW with max graphics in a world pvp raid in the open world, Classic wont be nearly as PC intensive
---
Reminds of watching [Faxmonkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frS6BjaiD8) around CoT.
---
Vocal minority always has something to cry about
---
Gotcha, so for PvP dwarf is probably better? Unless perception is really good?
---
It was fixed at some point during vanilla.
---
b-b-but... I saw an Alexensual tweet about this  saying it was ridiculous!
---
www.wowclassic.com also has the countdown
---
...... what? Most people didn’t watch MTV? Literally everyone I knew when we were between the ages of 14-19 ish? Watched MTV.  What were you watching on TV? Sure there were some other good stations but MTV was lit back in the day. And imagine calling someone out over a name on their alt account who even cares what my name is smh 🤦‍♂️
---
Shroud levels a shaman :)
---
Dwarf definitely better. Perception is fantastic, but unless you're dueling, if you know there's a rogue near you, it's probably because that rogue has already opened on you
---
Still.. human looks iconic
---
Thankk you, i have tried current wow and it runs fine on low settings, plus i will upgrade my ram as it was suggested. Wow, i didnt know about disabling new graphics, really gave me more hope
---
Respawn rates and quest item drop rates. Most pservers have systems in to make those part more bearable.
---
Well they never naturally OOM anyway, gonna be some nice viper sting magnets in pvp.
---
I have over 100 binds on my vanilla acct.
---
Vanilla is not like the others, you have access to all items at all times. 
---
Because of the global it's very easy to manage...Just put things off the global on strong binds
---
PrIVeT SerVerS AreN’t AccURAtE!!
---
Ok, that's very comforting. Thank you for the information. 
---
So paladin is much more spammy? Whereas on priest, it's more calculated?
---
Is crit hard to come by? I know a lot of the traditional plate gear probably doesn't have much, but I remember using a lot of cloth as a paladin anyways, right?
---
When Mexico sends their people, they're sending their GOATs. They're sending 40 levels of no-mount leveling, they're sending 40 man raids, they're sending vibrant server communities.
---
"nitpick on details and criticize what we see as poor design decisions or cash grabs" sounds nice but dude the reality is that some people not getting in beta and/or against layering be cursing you, your entire family, and even themselves in their rage, and that is far from simple "critisizing". Why would you try to defend people like that.
---
There are like 300-500 players online on beta. Classic will have thousands per server.
---
even on a private server (which obviously isn't accurate) this was true as well, and i don't really think any of the big codebases had problems with higher mob damage, so it's really weird
---
Wow Project Ascension / Paladin :)
---
Why are you commenting about how they made the game if you haven't even watched/read anything from the devs themselves?
---
Only for the first few weeks and it only layers after the server is at capacity.  You're playing on a server that is no where near capacity.  That mine has always spawned quickly. I can't tell you how many deaths I had there in vanilla.
---
Yeah part of me was thinking the same thing. A lot of the 'paladin' plate geared seemed to be designed in like a 'jack of all trades' manner, even though you could only really raid as holy.
---
Yeah you just need a metric fuck ton of intellect,  but if you heal, it will come
---
Yeah, instead of it "sharding" 10 yards around you, it "layers" you out 250 yards.
---
Yeah, I know. It's probably a similar situation for priests where it's like you wanna go human for the look, but dwarf has fear ward right? Not to mention stoneform as well.
---
Is the reputation thing really that huge? That's one specific thing I really don't remember well.
---
I thought rogues only lost combo points from a target if they started to build combo points on another target. Kick and blind don't add combo points so its working as intended.
---
There is an odd amount of 'Anti-Hype' surrounding WoW classic.  Lots of people will go in with massive low expectations of a broken game Blizzard spent 15 years fixing.
---
And they find... a competent RPG with a strong set of addictive and fun mechanics.  It became a cultural phenomenon for a reason, because at its heart it was a solid adventure.
---
I guess the "/s" wasn't enough
---
I never farm reps enough so I can't speak to that like others can. I do fine as undead though, so there's some anecdotal
---
aka this sub
---
I miss Season 3 of League. Easily my favorite time to play, but it's gone downhill ever since. Maybe it was burnout, maybe it was the drastic changes for better or for worse.
---
Oo, that's right... I'm forgetting spell crit came from int. Gosh, it's been so long, haha! Thanks for all your help and info!
---
Uncouth rock barbarians.
---
                               - love the Paladins
---
It's not useless, thanks :\^)
---
Brackets will most likely be handled the same way they are on private servers. Bracket leaders will set the caps high enough that they are unreasonable to reach without a premade and anybody that breaks brackets will be blacklisted from any legitimate premades and potentially have further implications in the server community.

No problem enjoy the power of the light
---
This makes me happy
---
This is the only correct answer.  Or have a warlock hellfire themselves to death.
---
Have.  She wants to play with me but doesn't much care for the friends I play with.  I'm playing with her mostly but told her if I can I will be raiding with them and she's welcome to join.  She's new to the game and I'm happy to help but she gets frustrated easily and does not like being rushed so we're often duoing.
---
Love you too bro &lt;3
---
I just dont get why u kids cant say anything not dumb?
---
It's been shown.
---
They would never do that!  
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Definitely getting my first BoE Epic world drop while solo leveling in Western Plaguelands - Wall of the Dead. Not knowing the true value of the shield I proceeded to sell on AH for a REGRETTABLY low price.
---
In the beginning was Classic,
---
And the Classic was with Omar,
---
And the Classic was Omar.
---
Most of them since Mists
---
That's okay! I have full confidence you will come to love the light some day soon!
---
Doesn't like you can download that anywhere yet though
---
bc that would increase their operating costs..
---
Proof that he’s in the beta and his account creation date plz.
---
Give this a try:
---
[Classic WoW Professions Guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview)
---
I appreciate you appreciating it! Long have I had this idea and no one is taken advantage of it! (I only play horde)
---
I doubt they will ever be in beta. If blizz was to release content all the way to 60, people wouldn't be speed leveling, they would be racing for MC clear or Ony kill. It would be really counterproductive for the beta process.
---
The company has more than doubled in value in fewer than five years. Regardless, basing whether a company "listens" on their stock price is extremely reductionist.
---
I guess it’s just a difference in taste ultimately. If you liked it you have mostly positive memories and the opposite is also true.
---
Just as an anecdote, pretty much everyone I've met on private servers are around that age or younger. I tried to talk about whether they're excited about Classic and about plans for the release and the most common response was they're not going to play because it costs money. A few people even tried to beg me to pay for their subscription.
---
I was disappointed to not find people like myself on there, but this is all an anecdote so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Well it has
---
Exactly how I am. So have you just decided to not play anything? Do you plan on playing classic?
---
Believe me, we did.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I have a 14 year old account, I got in 😁
---
No, the highest player levels was around 100,000, which happened last fall, I quit playing in the winter. I met a few people who had never played before, but were all low level and I would normally add them, they rarely lasted a week. Osrs content is focused on more end game and to experience the majority of new content you need to be a decently high level. Anyone who stayed had played before.
---
So why dont people believe me?
---
If the warrior out of combat regen is really accurate as blizzard said it is, and it stays in, warrior leveling should be significantly more manageable. Monkeynews was regenning 3-4% hp per tick last night.
---
shouldn't upvote this because there is in fact a problem and the other thread proves it. There is some sort of bug and Blizzard needs to know about it and not have the actually useful thread get lost in the shuffle to this.
---
You are in for a treat. What faction you plan on rolling?
---
It was a joke about how stupid it was that people got upset. Hence the "/s" at the end
---
Your feelings are irrelevant. What matters whenever you try to kill something is their defense and armour and your weapon skill etc. If the mob is 60 and you 30, you will damage it but have very low chance to hit it.
---
If you hit for 100 against same level mob, you might hit the higher level mob for 70 due to armour. Just never going to hit it
---
The other thread does not prove it and in fact many of the videos have been debunked.
---
Accurate or not private servers are already pretty easy
---
OSRS and OW.
---
The whole world first thing is a joke, they're well aware vanilla wow was a thing. This sub has been shitting on streamers like asmongold since beta began, they're there to promote the game... That's literally their job. Blizz didn't give asmongold a beta key for him to start doing free QA, they gave him one so the wow classic beta would be the most streamed thing on twitch the day it released.
---
&gt; It blows my mind that in vanilla crafting is really useful through every level. 
---
ITYM in vanilla crafting is a huge gold sink and waste of time with a very few notable exceptions here are there, and in almost every case you are categorically better off letting some other sucker level the crafting skill and just paying them for their work.
---
Crafting was significantly improved in TBC with more worthwhile recipes and special bonuses that you could only get from having the skill yourself.
---
Starting on patch 1.12 itemization will make warlocks outpace mages a lot sooner. I wouldn’t be surprised if they are the better caster throughout the entire game (other than the obvious mage carrying the ignite).
---
"When you decide to snort the Flash Powder"
---
Now that's some high quality h20.
---
When I rolled Warlock I enjoyed enchanting/tailoring. With my main I had rare enchants.
---
Don't really like Quin
---
Can’t sheep mobs tagged by other players on the beta.
---
This is my biggest issue wanting to play a warlock. I dont like humans or orcs.
---
I do not know about streamers but I know I will be playing shaman at launch. Still deciding on race. Leaning troll or tauren I think
---
The money issue came up in that demo, too, but a lot of it was that once capped at 19, you are given extra money instead of xp as it was "cap". I'm not sure if you're 30 or not, but that's going to be a factor right now. The damage issue...well, it's 4 days in to a 3 month beta. I'm not sure what to say other than keep reporting it until we get another "working as intended" blue post.
---
I was vanilla holy pally clearing AQ40... I was the MT spammer.. generally in raids for pally it was all about Flash heal spamming tanks.. along with your auras and buffing. The MP5 stat greater helped paladin healing iirc ..
---
Haha that assumes it won't be an AV meta
---
Same
---
I feel like there were some very strange reps that got removed super early on in WoW but I can't remember specifics
---
Agreed, it was the timing that was funny.
---
I feel like if Blizzard felt having you in the beta was beneficial to their brand/product, you'd already have a relationship with them and you'd already be in the beta and already be churning out content around it.
---
Lmao people downvoting must not know swifty, he's being so effin wholesome about it. Thanks for the post.
---
viper sting on a paladin is next to useless, 1 cleanse and it's gone. And it costs very little mana to cleanse.
---
Hi, /u/pvcdude
---
Sorry, this isn't Classic related and is basically just an ad, so the post has been removed.
---
Millionaire? He lives month to month with twitch subs and patron money, he gets free healthcare because he's considered a poor person.
---
Source: he talked about this today, around the time when he did Echeyakee if you wanna check the VOD
---
For real?
---
He’s doing a grand Marshall grind again... we will just see if he gets it.
---
Quinn has more play time on WoW than anyone on this sub. I guarantee it. He has never seen cosmetic feet besides the troll shoes they added to the legion event. It is very natural to report this as a bug.
---
Eeemmmm nope. Next stupid idea.
---
 So,  what's wrong with Asmon. I've only really seen him appear on a couple of streams unrelated to gaming and he seems pretty reasonable.
---
Osrs. Enough said
---
How many "levels" would it be if you took total xps from 1-60 and divided it by the amount of xps required from lvl 20-21?
---
Was at 75k before beta dropped.... 90k+ now
---
I am Alliance till the day I die. I plan on rolling a gnome warlock SM-ruin build. My friends and I are playing together I'm so keen just to feel like the south park series.
---
Filthy casuals if you're cooking your own meals for this. What was the point of working a job and saving money for the last 13 years if not to hire a chef for all meal prep?
---
I'm not that experienced on paladins but I have alot of vanilla experience. And one thing I can say is 100% go dwarf if you plan to PvP. Stoneforming out of blind is just too good. As far as spec goes you use the exact same spec for PVE as you do for PvP if you're healing. 31/20/0
---
As soon as the marketers take over the companies decisions it all goes to shit. When they start focusing on the money-making part of the game like “skins” or “mounts” and drop the focus on what makes the games fun to play it all goes in one direction -&gt; a money-milking shit game that is only still relevant because of streamers. And if someone speaks up and says “this game was better before” it’s only nostalgia...  I’m really happy that Blizzard listened to the community regardless of how they realized their wrongdoings, and I hope that other gaming companies will realize that keeping a game fun to play will generate ca$h as good as a micro transaction money milking game does
---
That is not intuitive. It says "armor" yet has no stats. He does not know that the exact item he is spawned with has 0 stats. He reported it. It seems odd. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the report. This sub is hilariously terrible.
---
cdew!
---
If the problem is actually the attack speed normalization thing that people are suspecting, it makes sense why certain mobs wouldn't be affected and some would randomly do a lot more/less damage.
---
but in specifics to the dungeons asmon and other people are doing, yeah they look mostly correct
---
I believe ZG and BRS itemisation helped holy pally
---
this was literally the only change i was hoping would happen, especially since its based on the BFA client. having the game run even smoother would be nice
---
He’s playing dumb... he’s being satirical. it’s kind of obvious. Listen to his tone.
---
Hi, /u/CATS_ARE_FABULOUS
---
Yes you do that all BEFORE you bang the gong. Do you really think people are going to wait 40 weeks if not longer?
---
You get a quest item from BWL that only 1 person can loot... 1 single person... Do you really think people are going to wait 40 weeks before ringing that thing? That's not including the 10+ people if not more depending how competitive it is that they funnel ALL of the rep items to AGAIN 1 single person...
---
I think you need to do your research more, as you aren't fully understanding the requirements lmao.
---
Awesome, lots to watch. Cheers!
---
Oh wow you can actually stoneform *out* of blind? Holy shit
---
You can solo devilsaurs with root and dots as resto with insect swarm. Maybe not with fresh 60 gear but it's not really that hard just need to not run out of Mana. If you have skinning and the competition isn't super harsh that is.
---
Exactly, I was just talking in reference to the top poster who was saying people should stop calling out those yelling about differences when the evidence shows that there are in fact no differences in the numbers.
---
I’m waiting on Sean Hannity to get waterboarded to prove that it isn’t a form of torture 😒
---
https://youtu.be/p-YSlARDNxs
---
That helps!
---
That's looks like a good option!
---
I made bank running scholomance and selling trash loot
---
I agree. You are getting downvoted but you are not wrong. My brother has never played wow or kept up on any news. He went into this sub and just laughed his ass off at all the petty shit people complained about. 
---
To the sliding bar being added for character select. To the dumb shit like making it easier to manage your bugs. As if they are core components to classic.
---
Its just sad. Now its the people calling it out that are the problem lmao. 
---
Unsubbing. Vanilla wow is a good game and the classic reboot will be too.
---
I was 12 when I played vanilla as well, got it for Christmas in 2005. I only got to level 52 or 53 and I have so many fond memories of classic. I can barely remember anything from levelling in any of the recent expansions, but I still remember begging my parents to let me play wow in the morning if I woke up extra early before school just to farm whelps in Redridge. Meeting people in the world, adding them to your friends list, creating friendships.
---
I feel like this opinion is going to be shared by a ton of people on this sub, in videos, on streams, etc. Just look at Venruki's video, you can tell that's genuine enjoyment of the things we all enjoyed from back then.
---
Times are different, we're all 10+ years older than we were back then, and the internet has come a long way, but I think that spark is still going to be there. It might not be as strong as the first time you walked into Ironforge or Stormwind or Orgrimmar, but I'm sure the feeling will be there.
---
I can't wait to see you all in Azeroth too.
---
I played Vanilla until BWL, and then quit.  I came back during BT in TBC, and have kept playing till the 2nd tier of MoP, when I finally quit for good.
---
So many years.  Its hard to really put into perspective how much time I've put into this game, and how long it has been since I've quit playing this game.  
---
Starting from my college years, playing way past midnight every night in Vanilla not caring about school the next day, to rushing home after work, to start my second job, raiding in WoW during my mid 20s, and to finally quit after burning out in my early 30s.
---
And now I'm looking forward to doing it all over again in WoW Classic.
---
Such a large portion of my life playing this game.
---
What about the sexual needs part?
---
i think this is from my favourite lifestyle and wellness website
---
I'm assuming farming devilsaurs is a no go because devilsaur mafia. For the time that it's relevant, competition is always harsh.
---
&gt;  everyone knows and love his incredible warrior tricks vids. 
---
yeah, no.
---
Honestly who cares? Having that will mean little now, and if you really want one, roll a private server. It's not even that cool of a mount.
---
I think its more that quin is submitting bugs but he doesn't even know what would be a bug. He'd be better off learning the game instead of wasting his and the developers time.
---
Why is nobody posting actual screenshots with damage taken being visible? 
---
If blizzard needs a few, i can always send some. Just pm
---
He certainly has the time to do it and the following to get them there. I would be surprised if he didn't get there
---
Your friend is a pleb disregard everything he says...
---
Paladin is by far the best support in the game, at the cost of offensive options
---
Dwarf &gt; Human. Human is terrible, many ways to increase stealth detection
---
This is not "vanilla" it's 1.12. And on 1.12 paladins are god tier support.
---
So did the other CSR post that this one directly contradicts.
---
This is making me wanna level a Dwarf Warrior or Hunter right here
---
Great question! I haven't read anything on the number of servers at launch, but I'm honestly considering joining a RP server, just to avoid playing on a streamer server. It all depends on the number at launch for me.
---
If you can't handle the gatekeeping here, you won't survive in WoW Classic.
---
i love when neckbeards pretend their drama is worth being called a narrative
---
Akama launched Nov 2005.  He was server first 60.
---
I’m curious what those numbers are on each of your spells on your action bar?
---
What about the action bars? Do we have the new condensed ones available?
---
Keep in mind that esfrand and asmongold are essentially twinking
---
yet it doesn't stop kids from making assumtions of how WoW is "supposed" to be
---
&gt;will you be able to play the rest of the beta 
---
usually yes.
---
Tips is a veteran warrior dude, best NA warrior. ASK ANYONE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME /s
---
Bye then
---
Hi, /u/Philss2016
---
Same. These rocket pass achievement blocks per week are bullshit, though. Ugh. I just wanna be able to grind. Not be forced to log in on a schedule. Weeklies?! JEEZ WHAT IS THIS, WOW?!
---
I think it was fixed the same time they prevented players from running into a raid when a boss encounter is in progress. When a boss is engaged everyone gets pulled to in combat.
---
Are glancing blows a thing at that level?
---
The original comment was about spinning up an minimal to unaltered client and server to beta testers. Just because it isn't production isn't going to save you from lawsuits. Or protect your network from a breach.
---
Yes with enough time they could update the old client. But it would be a long time before the public would be aloud to touch it.
---
1200 health can take 40 hits at 30 damage.
---
4 of those mobs and you survive 10 attacks.
---
With an attack speed of 1,5 i takes
---
Sorry if my explanation is crap. 
---
To put leveling to 60 in perspective, imagine leveling from 20-21 172 times. Of course this doesnt take into account increased xp values and quests etc.
---
I think it’s damage. There’s an add on called Dr. Damage that used to put damage numbers on the button
---
49 is half of 60, got it.
---
My dream is to be a shaman with sulfuras but dont have the guild to back me up lol.
---
I played Vanilla. Private servers are generally easier than Vanilla.

He always seems to be

You shouldn't care, the best revenge is a life well lived.
---
because Private server bitches want to believe they played the hardest version of the game. which is 100% untrue
---
Depends how server pops shake out. I'm not certain that every server every layer will have a devilsaur mafia controlling ungoro. On my real vanilla server I was able to casually farm them in like aq40 time on the server without being ganked very much.
---
sorry, just because you say everybody agrees with you and it's "undeniable" doesn't suddenly mean objectivity means what you want it to mean. you can't sit there and say "simple mechanics are objectively bad design" in a vacuum. if you have nothing substantive to add i think we're done.
---
Your friend is braindead. Paladins are amazing healers. They're imo 100% of the reason why Alliance has an easier time raiding
---
Yeah it was an old addon that told me how much damage each spell did.. I was pretty noob but at least wanted to do as much damage as possible haha. 
---
IIRC it updated if you had a proc or buff, so if I saw bigger numbers I casted that.
---
I sometimes wonder if toxicity was just as much apart of vanilla wow but we forgot about the bad parts. Remember that toxic gaming culture was alive and well back then, in fact, without political correctness being enforced, we saw even more heinous stuff in our games back then. I played a lot of dota, starcraft, cs, WoW and I remember the homosexual slur f word was thrown around like candy. And the n word was a bit more extreme but still pretty common. I feel like who ever was in charge of policing these things back then didn't care as much. People freely called each other slurs and worse and most people wouldn't even consider the possibility of reporting anything.
---
The only hope we have is if classic has a lot of older players returning to set a more mature culture on the servers. Hopefully, former edgy teens like me have been nourished by life experiences to grow out of that mentality.
---
Thank you so much my man! Really excited to play wow again! I'm rebuying a computer and everything
---
Wall jumping literally everywhere.  
---
Hyjal was the best experience wall jumping though. It was so cool to access a secret dev spot, and seeing the "In construction" sign post was hilarious.  
---
There was a big ass tree with a pit of water underneath it. I was undead so I could breath under water for longer and I tried to see if anything was at the bottom, but I don't think anything was.   
---
 
---
Also there was like a entrance to a raid, it looked just like the Onyxia's Lair entrance but it was closed off. There was even a swirly portal but I don't think it worked.  
---
Other cool places were under Stormwind, under Feralas, in the flight path routes between Desolace and Feralas (Which is how you get under Feralas) and behind SM, which brings you to Quel'Thalas. (You currently can't access that area even to this day in retail, there are invisible walls there now) Although if you're a rogue you can grapple past the invisible walls and the area is still the same as it was in classic. There are a few night elf structures and it's mostly empty land.
---
Anytime! I felt the need to get up and speak out you know? 👍
---
Potato potaaaato
---
Starting on patch 1.12 itemization is going to make locks significantly stronger early on.
---
Lmao a 30a bis.
---
I think he ment shit as in morally/ethically not practically. From a business stand point in this day in age of gaming they are creating a new meta.
---
Think about it pay for a CHANCE for an Early Access game LOL.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Blind is a poison, so yeah you can get out of it. In pvp you can blessing of sacrifice someone to make you practically immune to poly, sap, blind, etc. and you can bubble out of them if needed too. Stoneform is amazing, but as someone who played a human paladin in vanilla I never felt like I was missing out
---
Every streamer has confirmed that leveling is longer and harder...
---
Thanks, like dwarf it is then!
---
Oh yeah it's one of the few things you can upgrade.
---
I've also been searching for it for years. I have the BradyGames Strategy Guide, Second edition and there is an advertisement to purchase the map directly for them. I'm sad every time I see it that I never went and bought it at the time 13-14 years ago! I check eBay every once in a while, and haven't found anything close to as nice.
---
Did you censor "classicfags"?
---
Streamers on the beta are playing with a much lower population and in groups. Streamers getting free runs and getting better gear is certainly helping their leveling experience. My personal experience playing on "undisclosed private server" saw a much higher value of drop on private servers than I've seen on classic so I don't really know what you're talking about having more money by comparison.
---
LOl hadnt noticed I have my "YOYO" macro.. it was tocast fear...  cancel fear, cast searing pain ( to get aggro) then fear again... that way I could basically CC a mob in dicey situations
---
One boss fight isn’t the reason. You can do Raz with 2 priests if you so desire. Priests are simply the best scaling healer in the game.
---
TIL blizz doesnt have the data they claimed to have
---
i loved this can you make an edit with him cradling the wow logo or even a gnome
---
First character I made was a hunter (shocking, I know) because the person who got me into the game played a hunter and clearly wanted me to love it as much as he did. 
---
He spends a lot of time trying to teach me basic hunter stuff. 
---
We're getting me an escort from Wetlands to IF (only one E-machine and a handful of fps so he couldn't help), one of his guildies is leveling a female NE rogue alt in Wetlands so she comes to help out.
---
Immediately I'm like "Woooah she looks awesome, I wanna dual wield! Maybe I'll play that instead!"
---
Hunter guy is like "Don't worry you can dual wield at 20 too!"
---
"What about that cool mask though?"
---
"Oh, that's a rogue-only thing, but it doesn't have stats or give you any advantage or anyth-"
---
And so was born my NElf rogue, first toon I leveled to cap.   Didn't know or care about how good they were in PvP/PvE, didn't know anything about their playstyle.  Just knew I wanted to play a badass looking elf girl, so I did.  And it was amazing.
---
That doesn't mean we have to like that. A rich person/company is more likely to get legislation in their favor, but it doesn't mean we have to accept that as a society. Just because it's the way things are doesn't mean we have no choice but to accept it.
---
What? no
---
MMO's problems have always been the plebs
---
WoW was ruined when they looked at how many players saw Nax. As soon as Activision bought them that was never gonna happen again
---
Anything else like player negativity is just an after effect. 
---
WoW was ruined by detailed metrics and not wanting to waste resources on content no one ever saw.
---
I'm so excited for world pvp. Holy shit.
---
Nah, I entirely disagree. The vast majority of people are completely unable to manage that many different timings and maintain any kind of cohesive rotation/offensive/healing output, let alone handle another player pressuring them or any complex mechanics.
---
Take for example FFXIV, most people in that game can barely even output 40-50% of a class's max potential. That game has around 40 spells *including* oGCD skills. Not to mention that basically nobody outside of the top 90th percentile is lining up their shit with other raiders in any meaningful fashion. Classic has, as you say, shit loads of different stuff going on.  Far more than FFXIV has on any class.
---
We called Dragonmaw lagonmaw. It was constantly barely able to keep up and on the verge of crashing. Fucking embarrassing
---
fully agree with the ex edgy teen mentality lmao. Theres still a pocket of them who never grew up, but I think most people did.

Is there anyway they can remove the red trail  that a charge leaves behind?
---
&gt;probably a couple hundred short.
---
Lol more like 1k short. You have goldsinks until you reach 60, remember your abilities cost to train
---
Anyone who played a caster in vanilla wow knows that the 5 yard thing is real, probably due to how hitboxes worked. I was a mage player and that thing is still in my reflex. People who play on private servers have big mouths on this thread, and you should seriously stop giving advice if you are one. You have to understand that you are doing more harm than good
---
There's a lot of things you can and cant do in retail that were different in vanilla tho, so that's not really a reliable source to go by.
---
I hear ya man! Started back in Dec 04, and have an active sub, I dont feel like playing BFA knowing classic is within reach.
---
I still remember farming mobs in Winterspring, to close out my first character. Definityl became tedious, but I still felt more accomplishment of hitting that mark than I do now.

Private servers generally end up that way, as was vanilla. Now days? I'm not so sure that will be true. I *hope* the general attitude people expect to happen will happen just because it's such a well known thing.
---
I'm so fucking cynical and jaded after all these years of MMOs though that I personally think it will be way more toxic than it ever was back in the day or on any pserver.
---
I'd LOVE to be wrong though, and I know there will be some awesome people out there.
---
Pservers have to do better than give me a shitty dell, if they want me back.
---
You'll be able to save your name and group up with friends on servers 15 days before. Limit of 3 Names.
---
There is a post on here with overwhelming evidence that mob damage is very low. If I remember I'll link when I get to work.
---
It's a skill called delayed gratification. A thing that a majority of people struggle with.
---
If people are negative with no constructive criticism down vote them and ignore them and stop making post like this that give them any attention post like these just give them the attention and impact they want and will continue to do so you. You and everyone else who complains about them don't help.
---
If they're pretending to be an authority on something that changes things.
---
does earthbind kiting work properly on classic? otherwise, leveling a shaman is awful.
---
Unless theres a shitload of people on tge pve server then its under 1000 invited. I played like 10 hours today its pretty dead
---
Honestly just questing in STV in general. I'm really excited to experience that again, the constant fear of being ganked, the cat and mouse games being played with other players, thunder dome at the arena.
---
True, but you save a lot by learning only what you absolutely need. Fuck the rest. Why would I learn Wrath ranks or Starfire when I’m levelling as feral?
---
Also, selling absolutely everything that’s not trash on the AH will help a lot.
---
I practiced this on a private server and ended up with about 700g at 60. I expect it will be a bit lower in WoW Classic, but not the amount you’re talking.
---
17 was generally the cut off due to aggro radius on the Van Cleef boat.  If you had a 16 or below in your party it was very easy to pull the mobs on the top of the stairs which would cause a wipe.
---
Yeah as we get closer to the release we will go from being nostalgia-heavy to actual content filled sub, and seeing glimpses of the transition of the type of posts are making me excited for the sun and the game.
---
I'm pretty sure you can play this ancient game with integrated graphics
---
This is what I think. Esfand said they have a working version of Vanilla in it's original state at Blizzard and that's what they're designing it around. It's very possible that it was just different in this patch.
---
That’s super cool! Lol who’s cares if it’s noobish if it works, it works :)
---
I'm inebriated and this is a quality meme.
---
People are find with newcomers. Just don't ask stuff that's "heresy" to the Classic crowd... like "hey, how do I open the dungeon finder" unless you want to be flogged.
---
Will be rolling tauren shaman! I main shaman in live and my first ever vanilla character was a shaman. Can't wait to get back into the vanilla playstyle.
---
No one wants your hot take. Just like you don't want mine.
---
A butthurt zoomer complaining about toxicity? Fucking LOL.  Go check out more popular gaming subreddits if you actually want to see what real toxicity is. Is this your first day on the internet?
---
Plenty of people were dicks in classic. Ninja looting, guild drama/whoring, mankrik jokes/barren chat, and so forth..
---
Honestly I'd say the playerbase is now more mature, just far less engaged.
---
My favourite Kevin Jordan moment was when he talked about channeling spells are not very interactive. Then he proceeded to design 90% of classic PVE classes to be auto attack Andy and one button spam Jessie.
---
We never said we wanted it to "do well", we wanted it to be fucking authentic. Just fuck off back to retail please and let us have a true remake of vanilla.
---
Swifty is nowhere near as good anymore as people think.
---
Getting to 29 on a private server with missing as much of the content as I can to not ruin it. Then I’m pvping and practicing keybinds etc to be ready by launch.
---
The amount of people able to do that at a level indistinguishable from each other is very high relative to just about every other major game type I can imagine. It requires no talent only practice (talent will make you learn it faster, everyone can learn timings and get a feel for the game)
---
Fighting games? Require  inhuman reaction time to be elite
---
Shooters? inhuman mouse skills or if u play console with a joystick, which really is even more impressive. Young mans game console shooting
---
RTS? Have to have godlike mousework AND be able to reorient yourself 20 times a minute while you fly aroudn the map
---
MOBAs closer, but still massive gaps there. Can distinguish urself with reaction time. 
---
MMO players require none of that touch, if anything it hurts you. I have seen so many good shooter players who waste movement/time on dicking around with pretty smooth movement instead of the herky jerky that's optimum for a tab tareting m
---
I could go be a pro mmo pvper today if I spent the next 3 years practicing. There is just nothing impressive going on there. I don't need talent just practice.
---
Game with spell batching takes no reaction time..lol
---
Absolutely NO ONE is bitching about new players. What the fuck are you and OP talking about? Quit lying out of your asses in a vain attempt to support your bullshit opinion
---
If the website you write for is worth anything, you will get contacted, so I would not really have high hopes if I were you.
---
Did you save Clique before it was removed?
---
It's not even close. In retail there are 3 essential categories of consumables for raiding, pots,flasks,food. Maybe health pots as well if your raid doesn't have a warlock and/or tomes for respec. In vanilla you needed flasks, multiple elixirs, pots, bandages, oils/stones, food, felwood stuff, runes.
---
In retail multiple people can gather from the same node, the flasks don't require any sort of "Black Lotus" and you pots/flasks have a chance of multiple copies on creation. Also you can gather herbs while mounted with specific mounts and the herbalism enchantments almost making the gathering "cast" instant. In vanilla for just one flask you had to compete with other players and bots for every single node and black loti.
---
For enchanting, in retail, you only need mats from DEing items for enchants and you can break down mats. In vanilla in addition to that you needed stuff like crusader orbs, pearls, essences which required a fair amaount of farming.
---
I would say pservers seem easier. I noticed I leveled unnaturally fast on one of the big popular ones. Someone said the quest reward xp was higher but idk if that's true.
---
I do know that mob AI was low IQ so manipulating them and the environment was easy. Certain exploits were possible like /sit to get enrage.
---
god bless
---
anything more than 35 fps would ruin my nostalgia, im using a script for 100 ms latency aswell. NOCHANGES
---
The exp from 58-60 is the same as 1~24 😂
---
As a kid, i discovered that druids have more than wrath rank 1 at level 10 or so, and i died like once or twice at most. People who think that vanilla was hard are in full denial mode. It was HARDER not HARD.
---
So much this. OP really shows his age by being such a weak-willed and easily offended person. No wonder people don't take people his age seriously.
---
I gotcha, good to know!
---
Only 4 of us chose gnomeregan :(
---
this fat nerd says "like" too many times.
---
im getting ptsd just looking at this
---
You can also use mouse overs to spend combo points on a target you didn’t generate them on. I’m going to be playing rogue, so I have a vested interest in their power level, but this will need to be fixed.
---
Damn Holy Paladin ninja'd the epic sword from Eranikus back when I was leveling in retail on my Warrior...
---
I mean, I wasn’t trying to imply it should be right this second. I guess I meant it would be nice to see some confirmation in the future which I’m sure they will do.
---
Well I've been having fun on the beta guess I'm just an asshole
---
ofc, who else would get the legendary for his class \~\~
---
This thread is really needed. I've been watching in horror at the damage mobs are doing. No, I don't remember wrong. Druid killing a single mob required healing, mages using manashield, warriors died to 2 mobs.
---
You people have really shit memories. This thread is pure retardation from top to bottom
---
Im kinda confused... I've been seeing a lot of posts about how regen is slower, and the average mob damage is higher in the beta. 
---
Before the beta I was hearing a lot of conversation about how private server mobs are more difficult and spam their abilities, unlike the original vanilla experience.
---
So I am wondering the truth, do classes feel more balanced? are mobs easier? What the frik is up?
---
&gt; In pvp you can blessing of sacrifice someone to make you practically immune to poly, sap, blind, etc. and you can bubble out of them if needed too.
---
Yeah, I remember being able to do that.
---
mounts
---
Hence it being beta, report this in hopes they fix it.
---
i don't remember vanilla that well, but, i just used herbalism to sell off much-wanted herbs and made potions to sell. flasks were always in demand, as well as fire/frost resistance potions. cloth drops will definitely be needed at the beginning of the expansion as well, so, that's a viable alternative. iirc, runecloth was like 1-2g per stack and fluctuated wildly. 
---
tbh, i only managed to get my epic mount due to a Krol Blade drop.
---
Dis Omar.
---
But is all seriousness, he is a developer who worked on Vanilla WoW. He is also credited, per an interview with Ion Hazzikostas, for being the one who got Classic to even work. Ion said he "locked himself in his house for a couple of weeks until he got it to function with the modern infrastructure."
---
I’ve been playing Warcraft III campaign to get hyped and relive the pre-WoW story.
---
Daaayum. Praise him.
---
You people are fucking stupid
---
I'm going to play, I wasn't super hyped for it but after watching streams and videos and shit I completely forgot just how much fun it was. 
---
It's going to be fun playing a MMORPG again, and not just auto group, rush through dungeon/raid, leave
---
THIS is why we have a beta for all the people complaining they should just of released it and hotfix along the way lol
---
Priests were pretty strong later in Vanilla, but early on holy was pretty mediocre honestly.
---
Strong guilds were clearing MC with 25-30 people, and heavily theorycrafting to incorporate specs like shadow priests, fury warriors, etc. I remember outdpsing and outhealing most of a raid as shadow and still having people complain that I was taking a spot. Mediocre guilds in early wow were dominated by teenagers who wanted cool weapons, not raid clears.
---
For casters in particular, with some exceptions - if you pursued tier sets you were wasting your time as they were garbage. It took quite a while for people to realize stacking +damage and not mp5 or spirit was the way to go.
---
doubt every server would be able to reliably control each layer for them tbh
---
One shotting a mage for the first time with mortal strike
---
naw, it's just that private servers weren't accurate. while leveling videos aren't as plentiful from Vanilla due to the fact that Youtube was in its infancy as well as recording software, it's... kind of hard to tell, but, as far as i can tell, Classic is pretty much spot-on as far as accuracy goes for the Vanilla experience.
---
This reminds me of the scene in the original opening credits of the dwarf trudging thru the snow with his bear, and at that moment, I knew I was a hunter.
---
I played a dwarf hunter in vanilla, I will do so again as my first character in classic.
---
You couldn't just auto attack and win, there were boss mechanics and that's what caused people to wipe. If it were truly that easy, there would have been world firsts as soon as X amount of guilds zoned into the Onyxia and MC for the first time.
---
Wow adapts its respawning to zone population. Existed in vanilla to todays expansion
---
it won't.
---
Me and my friend are going to duo shamans at launch. Plan is to both go resto for pve and ele in pvp after that :)
---
yes pls
---
I think a lot you have to take with a grain of salt, because many aren't actually in beta and are just guessing based off of streamers and what they say. Some mobs in private servers don't EVER cast the abilities they have (compared to vanilla) as well.      
---
I think it's going to be a matter of waiting for everyone to actually figure it out
---
Teaching the client to read the data seems like the worst possible way to go about doing this. Converting the data seems a whole lot more maintainable to me. I know I don't see the whole picture but Omar's method just seems like it's inviting a QA nightmare rather than doing it the correct way.
---
Can't wait, looking forward to seeing so many people in Azeroth! Here's to many great levels and new experiences
---
Yeah I'm sure a level 34 was able to kite a devilsaur through red level zones. gr8 b8 on that ranged hit chance remark. You made me log in and type this so gj.
---
Once the game actually starts. None of this will matter. Just leveling and doing what you want in the game
---
Would you prefer they charge you $15 and you don’t get retail? My opinion is that $15 for 2 games is a pretty good deal.
---
None of this matters. 80-90% of this sub will quit classic by level 30.
---
Auction House.
---
You dont have to own the current expansion. Just have an active sub,
---
So for $15 you are getting at a minimum
---
Access up to level 100
---
and Classic
---
Damn good deal if you ask me
---
Tbh it's just a token so like.. Who cares. Not like anyone needs the gold anyway.
---
I will find you! :D
---
This. You don’t even have to buy any version of the game. You can go from starter account (free) to subscription and that’s it, you’re in on release date. Hell, you could literally never play retail and then you’d be paying the same subscription fee you used to pay for the game you used to play. I think the model’s perfect the way it is.
---
If people are hating you from your own enjoyment of things you have a wholly different problem brush.
---
Hogger killed too many friends on 100 lvl 1 gnome raids. We must avenge them
---
Thats just weird. If ure worrying about retail getting classics success, dont. im sure they figure it out which game every subscriber mainly plays :P
---
i really enjoy it, the mash up of different things to do is nice. its only 20 bucks, so you can't go wrong.
---
what's the diff? 15 is 15 if it comes with retail or not. It will cost you 15 to play classic, that's it.
---
It’s actually level 110!
---
Terrible arena players don’t deserve BiS PvP weapons
---
Making two separate subscriptions would ensure a fractured playerbase and worse performance on classic. With a shared sub players can freely jump between classic and modern wow. It's a model that benefits literally everyone with no downsides.
---
Elune adoré
---
big bois
---
Lmao
---
Paying attention to quests I’ve done 10 times doesn’t make me have any more fun.
---
I've played since beta, think there is a lot of us we just don't stream
---
Been playing Teldrassil and Darkshore for the past three days and IT’S FANTASTIC! I forgot how much better classic was than current. You guys will all be so happy.  I’m never going back to current. Seriously. Better game all around.  :)
---
You don’t have to buy BfA to get access to classic. Just sub. If you want pretend its for classic and bfa doesn’t exist. That’s my plan anyways.
---
&gt; I'll see you all on the 27th of August. 
---
the game comes out on Aug 26th 6pm EST, just an fyi.
---
And there isn’t even a upfront cost like buying a new expansion or the base game. IMO it’s a good deal.
---
Point. Proven. Thanks mate.
---
You might want to close to me at this point
---
wat
---
People need to realize that once Classic comes out, it will be a 15$ subscription to 'World of Warcraft', not 'Retail' or 'Classic' but the entire game instead. There will be people who play BfA or Classic, but both groups will be supporting WoW instead of one or the other. You're not subscribing to Battle for Azeroth to play Classic, you're subbing to WoW.
---
Damn, it seems like 10 years ago I was following his guide. That's amazing.
---
I was leaning really heavy towards shaman. I played shaman in Vanilla and I liked the jack of all trades play style.
---
Then this morning my husband pointed out how much easier and how much ganking we could avoid if we both played stealth classes.
---
So now I'm leaning towards druid but from what I understand about vanilla druids is you're only useful if you're healing : / Which I don't mind but it's a little off putting.
---
Just started listening to that podcast. About 3 episodes in and I enjoy it so far.
---
\#ChangesArentNecessarilyBad
---
I'm looking forward to this sub moving on from the streamer salt and into Omar memes.
---
10/10 #inomarwetrust
---
You don't have to own retail WoW, you only need an active subscription. I personally don't see a problem with a monthly sub fee, WoW has always had a monthly fee and I don't think anyone thought they would launch classic for free.
---
I will gladly pay the monthly fee to enjoy a good classic experience again, as long as they keep it pure obviously.
---
Well asmon was taking lvl 55 mobs today as a lvl 28
---
Guy is a straight up retard
---
K.
---
You need to pay $15 to play wow.
---
I intend to play wow in August
---
So I will pay $15.
---
Imagine not playing Risk of Rain 2
---
I put my details on the form in the sticky months ago, and forgot about it until now. It's great to see so many guilds I recognise from before (and better than that, a few people too!)
---
Final Fantasy 14 and Rocket League. Thiught about getting  back into OSRS maybe....
---
After hearing the release I've kinda lost interest for now, just gonna wait it out.
---
Also I bought a guitar the other day which has helped ease the pain of waiting lol
---
Warrior is horrible for 98% of the game
---
for sure, cheap ass entertainment !
---
Here's some reference from original open beta if you want to test: https://imgur.com/a/RR5r6xd
---
Losing half of health pool to single bear in bear mode; two manning green elite when void walker about to die.
---
Spreadsheets to optimize my gameplay once it DOES come out.
---
Has anyone thought about fact checking this or are we just going to take some random guy's word for it?
---
TBH, I was very surprised Classic wasn’t a separate sub.
---
Oldschool runescape and CSGO are pretty much the only games I play now
---
New things bring hype for a bit.
---
It’s not authentic. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Crendor's stream is really laid-back and not toxic.
---
yeah yeah, hogger, sure but...
---
VANCLEEF DID NOTHING WRONG
---
BIG STORMWIND MEDIA FILLING YOU WITH LIES.
---
\#PAY VANCLEEF.
---
Well..most of us cant play so watching its the best we can do😅
---
My phone background for the next few months in preparation for Classic.
---
Been an enh shammy since TBC, but I actually want to raid in vanilla so that's out the window
---
Yeah, i dont get that statement. Sure, release will be even a bit more, but tbh its already at a very hyped state. Dont expect WoW to be #1 for several weeks after release though..
---
Joana video was private server though
---
same, I wouldn't mind paying if I had to, but I make good money, so it's easier. NOT saying it's a good idea to charge of course lolol
---
People said it looked ready to go at demos at E3 and such a year before original release. Of course it looks that way when you have had limited time to experience a percentage of the content.
---
Or how much ganking u can do lol, nothing better than 2 coordinated ganks to insta kill someone
---
Right.
---
did you even read the post? its not the ancient game anymore. But yes you can play it with integrated graphics, i am atm doing that. But its horrible. 30-40fps but with incredible screen tearing.
---
Saving this comment for reference 6 months from now
---
&gt;People flaming streamers for no reason at all. A post ‘exposing’ a streamer for ninja looting? Yes it’s frowned upon and it’d be bad server rep but fuck me - you’re acting like he shouldn’t be in beta solely cos he ninja looted. It happens. Why is everyone so salty over this and nitpicking anything streamers do?
---
Hold on, ninja looting an item isn't "no reason at all". For streamers bad server rep is effectively bad overall rep as they have a lot more exposure.
---
While I don't think his beta should be removed over it, ninja looting is a real dick move.
---
you need to be subbed is a requirment
---
U w0t m8?
---
Hi, /u/fartfacepooper
---
They are still getting tons of views I mean look when soda is on he will have 60k viewers while stay safe and tips have around 1-2k
---
i think you mean adonis
---
Screw you. Hogger world 1st. They better have an achievement for that!
---
What? Those streamers that said classic would be a massive failure? Towellie, for one, routinely shat on everything classic and only hopped on the hype train when he saw the numbers. I can't believe people can legitimately watch that hypocrite, he's a complete sellout and is about as normie as they come.
---
Classic happened because of Nostalrius. End of story.
---
That's why they are all speed leveling. You can't still get ganked but it will be a lot harder with spwrgs following you and you are already a level 60
---
I’m not sure how this would be a goof though tbh.  I’m not saying it couldn’t have happened but they have a stand-alone 1.12 reference to go off of so how can they possibly mess these values up
---
The thing you're completely failing to mention is that the playing field is level. You're exaggerating how easy it is to learn, if it was so easy everyone would be able to walk into PvP and not be trash, most people are trash despite having played a lot. 
---
There's still a huge gap between a mediocre player and a good player, further still for exceptional players. If what you are saying was strictly true, then skill would never transfer between MMOs since you need to re-learn everything. But it does transfer between MMOs, just like learning to aim transfers between shooters.
---
Guilds got up to some weird crap early on in vanilla. There was a guild on my server that gave their first TF to a hunter. That might have been before they knew what the bindings were for, but anyway...
---
That same hunter went on to tank Neffarian just for funsies, so I guess it wasn't a complete waste...
---
Idk Wow subs in general seem much more toxic than the average sub
---
If the dozens of straw polls that have been on this reddit are reflective of the actual Classic demographics, Shaman will definitely be one of, if not the most played class on the Horde side -- so I think they're getting plenty of love lol.
---
I was subbed in 2004 and I play on private servers.
---
Damn internet makes people so soft
---
And reddit is a damn echochamber
---
Hope you have a lot of free time!
---
Hey this probably a dumb question but I never played on an rp realm, is out of character talk banned in general channels? Like is it free from people arguing irl politics and memeing?
---
With our luck they will all choose different servers and be unavoidable 😑
---
I've slowly been cutting down my hours. After I had my first son I limited gaming to about 4 hours a night, if I slept 1 less hour. That dropped to 3 afterwards, then 2. Now some nights I don't even play any games because I'd rather sleep than play. Pretty sad considering gaming is my absolute favorite thing to do
---
Drop your pants?
---
No changes.
---
We want our pc's to be utilized terribly
---
To me, the pillar that supersedes all others is that of the struggle/reward balance that Vanilla found.
---
* Leveling was slow and took a lot of time, but it made each level up feel like important progress.  
---
* Gear was slow to acquire (40 man raids, 2-3 items per boss), but that made getting a piece all the more meaningful.  
---
* PvP ranks were rare at the highest levels, but that made seeing a High Warlord/Grand Marshall in your BG something to remember.
---
Things like that left room for certain achievements to feel special.  Things are more meaningful when everyone can't have them.  That's not really casual-friendly, but it's true.  WoW was already super accessible to casual players for its time, but by having exclusive things like the Black Qiraji mount available to an exceptional few number of players, they managed to make the game fun for both the casual player and the hardcore dedicated folks.
---
the drain soul talent doesnt work like it did on private servers so sadly its useless now and you wont need this macro
---
I've been watching in horror at the damage mobs are doing. No, I don't remember it wrong. Druid killing a single mob required healing, mages had to use manashield, warriors died to 2 mobs.
---
Archimonde, I’ve come to bargain.
---
You are right about the return of DnD-like mechanics being brought back. People forget WoW was based on EverQuest and Ultima Online and the like and those were all heavily inspired by pen and paper RPGs. 
---
I am glad they'll be bringing back the more complicated me mechanics. Do I take the increase in hit chance or the increase in damage? 
---
Do I take the Agility or the Stamina bonus? 
---
I really didn't like things being watered down and I am curious to say where things go from here.
---
I thought you couldn't use special characters until Wrath? I'm pretty sure that was the case in NA anyways.
---
Mortal Kombat 11 atm but im trash
---
&gt; ...then you’d be paying the same subscription fee you used to pay for the game you used to play
---
Less, by the time you factor in inflation.  By all rights they could be charging ~$20/month in 2019.
---
I bet you’d be in the beta giving 100% correct feedback. And only submitting reports. Not playing for fun because you would be a good little tester. Fuck these streamers playing for fun. I wouldn’t have fun at all because I would actually be testing the game by finding the real bugs.
---
How is it unfair? Venruki is a Vengeful Gladiator. A multi-rank1 player. If people like that don't deserve viewers, who does?
---
...It's reddit.
---
What more do you expect?
---
Some of these would fit into retail well, and some of them would not, imo.
---
For instance, I think if blizz removed cosmetic options from retail it'd be a big mistake. But having a harder leveling experience where things weren't so simple, that would be a massive improvement.
---
The lack of cosmetic options is one of the things that made vanilla what it was, but imo it wasn't one of the things that made vanilla *good*, which is an important distinction.
---
Wot ? Are you one of the whackos that consider leveling 98% of the game ?
---
Because thats the only time warriors are actually bad
---
My man!
---
TO THE PLACE
---
Looking on all polls. Shaman will the most played Horde Class at 16%.
---
I think you are ment to read a topic before responding.
---
Lol
---
Too many days
---
Username checks out.
---
Warriors aren’t even good at 60. It takes so long for them to come online
---
Understandable, I just little interest in doing so due to the fact that I won't touch retail
---
This is legit.
---
A potato computer of today was impossible tech of the future in 2004. I'm fairly certain multithreading on the classic client would be overkill. But maybe they'll implement it. Who knows.
---
More like it's only *because* of the beta.
---
Why specifically rp-pvp? You can't accomplish the same things on a pvp server or just kinda deal with a normal RP server? Not trying to nitpick, actually curious
---
I don'r see how that applies to Venruki.
---
I think he was joking but I still appreciate your post.
---
Just got invite on Friday. I subbed the day of the announcement, opted in the day of the announcement, and have actively participated in the original WoW and the MoP beta. My sub has been generally inactive for some time, not a content creator
---
I'd recommend just watching some youtube content.
---
Also watch someone level 1-10 on the beta, that will give you a decent idea of how things work.
---
no it's not. damage is accurate.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5rxj/can_someone_explain_this_discrepancy_in_mob/eo29ftv/
---
Watch a few YouTube vids about it. Look up asmongold or nixxiom, there’s a lot more youtubers to watch and they’re pretty educational videos. Look up tutorials that’s pretty much what we do. There’s a whole hour long video of what class you should choose for your play style in classic. Just know it’ll take some time to reach 60 but don’t feel rushed it’s not like retail it’s more sandbox feeling. You can get stuff done on your own time and still feel like you accomplished a lot. Very casual friendly. Good luck
---
Theres always crafting and gathering like every other class can do. Druids can actually do some AoE farming. I believe it goes something like moonfire spam &gt; HoTs &gt; Barkskin &gt; Hurricane &gt; Bear Swipe until dead. Or something like that.
---
Its not very good AoE farming but it can be done.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8o8b5r/warlock_delete_souls_shard_macro/
---
1.) Don't get discouraged at the slow process to max level, Classic WoW is all about the journey to 60 not just level 60 content. 
---
2.) Make sure to make friends along the way to group with so you can invite them to more things later on down the road. Don't be afraid to ask for help from others when trying to accomplish difficult tasks.
---
3.) Play with each class a little bit before diving right in. Find out which class you enjoy the most because that's the one you're going to be spending the majority of your time on so you want to be in love with their playstyle and fantasy.
---
4.) Have fun, and just get immersed into everything, read quest texts as they'll give you a more refined reason for everything you're doing, it will explain the story to you along the way and you can get immersed in the world. 
---
As for lore videos there are plenty of those on YouTube. If you ever want to look up the story of something in WoW just go on YouTube and look up "Lore of (insert whatever you wanna know here)" and you'll find dozens of videos.
---
Oh I'm fully aware. That's why I made the comment sound like that lol.
---
It's funny how every single class appears to be OP/shit based entirely upon who you ask. 
---
Wonder why that is?
---
Half the population leaving after release would be a success compared to WoD and BFA.
---
Just for clarification, my account is a day 1 vanilla account, but I played on a friend's account during the closed beta for vanilla as only one of our group of 5 friends got in. So we can disregard that as a possible reason for the invite.
---
Even better.
---
In my opinion, ever demanding raid environments lead retail to get to its current state.  
---
Let me elaborate: raids getting harder and harder, players are getting more competitive, balancing getting more important, which in turn lead to the "streamlining" of classes and roles. this wasnt the case when you could happily bring 5 moonkins to your MC raid cause it didnt prevent the kill. in this regard, one can see the competitive scene as the bane of WoW development.  
---
Imo its impossible to revert this on live servers.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who's bothered by it. Like what is he doing, watching netflix instead of numlock running?
---
no, the damage is accurate.
---
I don't think that's true that holy priests we're mediocre. Also, if you remember correctly the player base was just mediocre in general. Tbh there wasnt a huge differential between shadow/holy/disc. Since you put talents in any tree you wanted to, it gave more viability to the class as a whole and not restricting them with "spec". So I'm not surprised that you did quite a lot of healing and out healed healers in the raid. Don't get me wrong there's definitely a preferred even strong build for raiding, but it was definitely more forgiving than we see in WoW now, so you are correct.
---
Theyre the only viable tank through vanille, top dps in molten core and close to the top after that lol
---
damage is more or less correct.
---
The OG build is actually worthless outside of what they did with it. Years upon years of client exploits, data exploits, injections, everything. If they were to release the "OG build" There would be thousands upon thousands of threads of stolen info, hackers running wild, the game probably crashing endlessly all the way to the servers being bruteforced offline. Would be literal suicide for a company to release something that runs off 15 year old code.
---
This is the kind of posts I like reading &lt;3. Hope you get a beta invite lol if not, see you in the realm of Azeroth!
---
Warriors/ rogues are top dps. Personally I love rogues. I’m going to be a rogue. What exactly do you want to do in classic? Raid? Pvp? Both?
---
Just remember to right click the torch once inside lol
---
Oh how I would love to see that, too.
---
Yeah as it turns out people prefer having to make meaningful choices for their character in their mmoRPG. People say wow went wrong when LFD was introduced, which is kind of true. But I think WoW truly went down the wrong path with Cata when they removed a lot of the stats that made gearing interesting and stuff that enforced meaningful decisions. Like the removal of hit rating and defense rating.
---
Cata pruned a lot of stats that were a big part of the rpg mechanics. I think if the only bad thing that they introduced was LFD and not removal of rpg mechanics, the game would be in a much better place right now.
---
It won't be the same, for many reasons:
---
- There's far too much information for it to be. You can completely min max your experience, which Vanilla wasn't about at all.
---
- Static changes. If there are seriously No changes, people are just going to play what's OP. When people play a class they love that is subpar, they have hope with each patch it will get buffed. Knowing your class or favorite spec will be bad INDEFINITELY completely changes things.
---
- The community (imo) is much different. In vanilla everything was more social, and seemed much friendlier. It's been a while since WoW actually felt like a social world without people micro managing everything you do and telling you how to play.
---
- I think there will be a LOT less exceptions made for under performing specs. Over the years the gear requirements and performance requirements for raiding has shot up, to a point where a lot of people require the same GS that drops, and won't take anyone that's even 1% lower. Enh shams, feral druids, ret pallies, boomkins, etc, can all rethink their classes if they want to raid.
---
Most of the active 2004 are in from my understanding and reading the i got in posts on reddit. 
---
10+ years is nothing.
---
Yw.
---
yep game is way too easy right now (especially dungeons)
---
How is it different?
---
/r/wow is basically Tumblr. Welcome to a real subreddit where regular WoW players say what they want.
---
wow smh. trying really hard not to say the Gamer Word.
---
Let’s start chanting boys! “Invite, invite, INVITE lets go baby!!!!!” 🙏🍾
---
No the hell we don't want the original client. I would like to actually play the game. You mention later that there's no reason to fix what isn't broken, but that just makes you look stupid. It -is- broken. If they released that it would take less than an hour before some dude in Russia is holding the entire server hostage every 5 minutes for money. 15 years of bug fixes and plugging exploit holes should never be taken back. The game would catch quite literally on fire.
---
Man, I can't wait when he and other developers teams up to create "The Classics"
---
&gt; Venruki is a very genuine guy 
---
Partway through his rant he said that "when he gets a piece of gear with 5 intellect and 3 stamina, he can feel his spells hitting harder.. he can feel the damage."  
---
How? Int gives 1/40 of 1% of spell crit. 5 intellect is, what, 1/8 of 1% -- 0.125% -- spell crit? And he FEELS his spells dealing more damage?  
---
He later says that he can remember the whole map. He remembers "the area where there were pumpkins, and he had to run past that to go kill some.. I don't know, human guys."  
---
He couldn't remember killing the **Scarlet fucking Crusade**, literally the overarching questline of Tirisfal. And he says this in the same breath as praising the game for making him read all the quests again. Literally he said that next sentence.  
---
This seems like bullshit shilling. As an avid supporter of classic, I'm glad he's shilling it. As someone who hates hypocritical bullshit, I won't call him a "very genuine guy."
---
They don’t become top DPS till you approach AQ40 and are the 1a to Rogues 1b. They are of course great DPS before that, but they are not “the best.” They are “the best” tanks by virtue of being the only tanks that Blizzard had the foresight to make viable. They are completely gimped in solo PvP until you get a dedicated pocket healer.
---
They can **eventually** become the best class, but that’s at the mega game after hundreds and hundreds of hours
---
Yeah idk what you're smoking. Warriors are hands down the best class at 60 overall. THE only true tank, the highest DPS.
---
You should have seen the ones I found in the belly of one of the trout I kept this afternoon.
---
My brother and I were looking at them, and then a minute later I realized one of the damn things was still alive and moving lol
---
Thats not really a good comparison. Like you’re comparing legal changes that effect you and others to just not getting to play a game early while someone else does. Keep in mind fyi, this used to be a job, and your salty you can’t do it for free.
---
Fresh 60 warriors are absolutely not the best DPS
---
https://m.imgur.com/d7sfrpD?r
---
What are *you* talking about? Every video or reference I've seen posted in this thread above your comment shows the damage values being higher in vanilla.
---
The kill has to be from the drain soul itself
---
I was harassed and told to kill myself because I prefer the new forsaken models, and especially the new floppy tongue physics. In a thread with people discussing the possibility of a toggle for the old modes. :/

He is a criminal scum. So hell yeah rush and kill that bastard gnoll, i hated them since WC3 . FUAAAAARK!!!
---
Um no, not fresh 60. Who judges a class at fresh 60?
---
what do you want to do? that's the real quesiton.
---
if you want to raid, you're gonna need to go warrior/rogue or heal on a druid, unless you're playing with a casual guild that doesn't care about classes. feral druids are a complete joke until you can get your hands on a feral AP weapon, which isn't until AQ or the green dragons. balance is just extremely underwhelming until basically the last tiers of raiding.
---
if you want to PVP, any of the classes are fine.
---
I don’t think people could pull 6-8 elites and be fine, Zero deaths, have mana left over, while the priest and mage are both tanking elites. You could chalk it up to “well people are just better now”, but the tank of that run I watched, asmongold, was playing like shit lol.
---
Thank you for comments.
---
I just don't see how you can charge full subscription price for what is a 'remastered' version of an old game. SC and WC remastered are not sold at full price. I think this has the potential to put people who are not die hard fans off playing, which is a shame.
---
I will be the first to admit a lack of knowledge on server costing etc, but I would imagine this game will not cost as much to run/maintain, especially when compared to retail? They are also not needing to design new content as it has all been done before? I may be ignorant on this so please enlighten me.
---
Only the account with an active subscription will be eligible.
---
That would be incredible, but I don't see how after designing raids for the new expansion, that they could possibly go back to some of the bone headed mechanics (if you even want to call them that) that they had back in the day and inevitably built on top of them. But boy that would be sweet.
---
Maybe the bot should detect if I’m joking about suicide or saying someone said to kms or actually saying something worrying.
---
Druids are mostly garbage unless you want to heal, fury warrior is the best dps in the game, and protection warrior is the best tank. Arms warrior is pretty bad, so I wouldn't expect to play that.
---
Rogue is really good, less damage than a fury warrior but more utility.
---
I think it’s that there’s a lot of mobs missing abilities on private servers. But the ones they do have, they are programmed to use basically on cooldown, which isn’t how blizzard did it. I believe Kevin Jordan went in-depth on this in a podcast.
---
Whats gatekeeping???
---
The die hard private server community is the most awkward neckbeard driven community there is. It makes OSRS's look stable. Give it a week or 2 after launch and the subreddit will balance out mentally. Not everyone here is an insane 35+ year old dying to prove how good they are at a 15 year old game. Some of us just want to go back to our favorite game. Back home. Give it time, we'll balance out.
---
I have. They use terms like Tourists, Retail Babbies and shit like that. Doesn’t mater if they were like me and played in Vanilla. Like anything new and your subhuman trash to them.
---
Nope. If u don't give a fck about all hate and toxicity the game will be amazin. Actually there is a lot of utility and helps from community on reddit.
---
You do, reread your comment. I’m not saying Warriors aren’t *eventually* the best DPS, I’m saying for the vast, immense majority of the game they are not the best at anything except tanking. They need gear, and they don’t hard scale into Gods until AQ40. **Warriors suck for the vast majority of the game**
---
then stay on your private server. Classic is not the gamer for you
---
True
---
&gt;That wouldn't happen, there was much more involved with getting the mount/title than the mat turn-ins including a long quest chain that included raid bosses afair plus some so they couldn't sneak it in like that
---
&gt;&gt; To get a qiraji tank you can use OUTSIDE of AQ? I do not remember this.
---
You need the **[Scepter of the Shifting Sands](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21175/the-scepter-of-the-shifting-sands#comments)** to even bang on the gong, which requires, arguably, one of the most epic quest chains of the entire game—it's kinda hard to forget.
---
Dude has no Vanilla history.  Pretty sure he said his highest level Warrior was 34?
---
&gt; It might be a bug or it might be something that changed between 1.9.2 and 1.12
---
I have a feeling it might be this, which would be incredibly disappointing since Blizz is going with 1.12 data.
---
If they nerfed the game between those patches, we are going to get the nerfed version, not the proper version.
---
God I miss hellfire
---
I literally see it happen here. Anyone who likes anything from retail or is new and doesn’t immediately praise everything about retail even its flaws is downvoted and attacked. Or have you not noticed that anyone new or anyone on retail is a “Tourist” or “Retail baby” regardless of how long they played or what their opinion is of current and past wow.
---
Yikes

ALLIANCE SCUM LUL TOWER DEFENSE ALLY LUL BAITING GUARDS LUL 20 MAN RAID Vs 1 COW LUL RAT SQUAD LUL

WoW is not a hard game
---
Nice, looks like it might be working then, because I see there's some phasing issues from zone to zone. Soda was getting chased by a panther earlier and once they got into Duskwood it just disappeared completely
---
And then it was the case of that clip with the barrens / durotar crocodile
---
You just oaiee for a chance to play the beta? Why not just play on one of the well established pservers :)?
---
Why?
---
But he has played vanilla. L m a o
---
I'm not gonna go back into the vods or anything, but in the first day I heard Esfandtv and Sodapoppin mention the strafe bugs and reported it. I'm not gonna say they said it in the first 5 minutes of testing, but everyone seemed to be aware of it pretty quickly that I saw.
---
Good. Running the game on 60 FPS today = LFR and free epics tomorrow. Just look at how color blind mode and raid frames caused layering, and we no longer have to get disconnected and wait in queues. Say no to changes.
---
/r/choosingbeggars leaking hard. Have you tried contacting customer support to pay for your subs using social media exposures?
---
i thought he was holding a gun to his head in the thumbnail picture lol
---
I hope Blizzard does the same thing and makes new 60 content. That'd be dope.
---
They went with the name "classic" over vanilla for a reason.
---
Imo, quest structures in Retail could improve a log. The actual substance of the quests are more diverse, and usually you're doing fun things, but they're inconsistent. boring, and easy. In Vanilla, questing and questlines are more sparse, and more "bare" with content, but they feel more meaningful because they actually progress naturally, over long periods of time, and eventually require long-term planning with major payoffs. Leveling in retail has more fun features, but ends up just feeling like a super-easy series of quests to delay the level cap content
---
The thing is though, you're actually running the modern game, just with classic values plugged into it. That's why the new graphics are a thing along with new animations and stuff.
---
So it requires more power by default than true vanilla did back in the day. That being said though, you can basically run the game on a potato anyway and lower FPS isn't *too* big of a deal. I mean, plenty of people back then played with sub 30 FPS, in a lot of cases sub 20.
---
Alliance can only attack when outnumbered.
---
Considering Joana's video was from 1.9.2, is it possible that Blizzard nerfed the entire game between that patch and 1.12? If so, well that's disappointing, because then we're getting the worst version of vanilla.
---
Level 19 with 523 HP.
---
No Demo Shout, no Thunder Clap.  Far away from healer.
---
Guzu knows what's up.
---
The pet frames aren't showing under party members with the default party frames.
---
People have lost their minds. Meanwhile blizz is laughing all the way to the bank.
---
Cdew and shroud are both playing shamans. Still on the fence between shaman/priest.
---
I'd wager a lot of the dislike it isn't down to being salty over not getting beta access, it's a generational thing where many people (myself included) just don't care about streamers and are irritated by how people fawn over their rehashed content. I'm 40 and look down on 'influencers' because it's low-effort entertainment and I lump them in with reality TV stars as surplus population who don't provide anything of benefit. I find the concept of watching other people playing a video game retarded. I'm sure some the majority of streamers are nice people but they're not my friends and they don't have any skills I wish to learn from or emulate and they're doing something I could be doing myself - why would I watch them?
---
Does classic beta support DirectX 12? IIRC the multithreaded optimization was only supported using DX12 since it was tied to the renderer. So you won't see any improvements if you're not using DX12.
---
I don't think you'll see much of a improvement anyways. Most of WoW's core logic is still tied to a single thread.
---
Untrue statement.
---
Hearthstone
---
And instead of just ignoring whining, you decided to make...a post whining about the whining.
---
Good job.
---
I may be wrong but I believe when the actual launch happens last I heard he isn't going to play a pvp realm, so that's one way to avoid his audience.
---
Blizzard should just make everything a little harder than private servers. Problem solved
---
To be fair, comments have been bordering pretty close to that on this sub lately rofl. Envy is a hell of a drug.
---
This is what people tend to forget: This subreddit is not the entire "vanilla community". The same goes for any subreddit. Or forum. Or discord. Or....you get the idea
---
So, exactly how it works in private? Cuz the point of the /petfollow is for the pet stop attacking so that you do get the drain soul kill.
---
yikers
---
^^^^^plsnobantwitch
---
That's also fairly boring to watch though.
---
Who cares
---
For me it's remembering the exact damage values of enemies in shadowfang keep for 15 years so I can call the beta broken on reddit
---
Pretty sure it's because they're using the 7.3.5 client. I think.
---
How come no "Tipsout sucks!" or " I deserve to be in the beta because x" squares? I think this is last week's bingo card.
---
Preach has a video on his channel of him tanking RFC on his warrior, I assume he'll throw the rest up as TDPs as well.
---
I played with integrated graphics (early 2008 white macbook) back in retail TBC and it was awful. I'd get 20-25fps out in the world, and &lt;10fps in cities.
---
Dude, this sub has been toxic since its inception. Don't lie to yourself.
---
not even mad, just banta m8
---
&gt;  half the time clothies are tanking mobs.
---
As a mage in vanilla/BC: if I tanked any in-dungeon elite trash mob for more than a single hit, I died. If they crit on that single hit, I died.
---
Top notch meme, much kek
---
Not exactly what I mean.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I imagine while they can obviously get exact values like armor, and anything else that may affect damage, there is then some calculation it does with all those values that is essentially a black box.  So you know some of the data and you know the output (x character took 7 damage) but you have to try to piece together the calculation that happened to get to that result.
---
&gt; How much of classic did Asmon really actually play?
---
He has said that he started playing 3 months before TBC, I believe
---
i'm definitely getting my hopes up. why? because a large reason why i feel the social scene in classic was so great is because it was an entirely new experience for everyone. obviously mmo's weren't something new, but wow was the first mmo to really commercialize the genre and bring it to a mainstream audience. and i think that's going to happen again. because we're currently in a funk where all of the mainstream genres have been milked, and it's been long enough since mmorpg's were relevant (2010-2012?) that i think we're ready for 'new' ground. 
---
so you got all the vets who want to relive classic, all those who want to see what they missed out on.. and there's also an entirely new generation of gamers who could very well be interested if the hype is there. and there definitely is. the planets seem to be aligning here, and i haven't even touched the pvp aspect yet. which is kind of surprising people aren't talking about pvp considering how popular it was back in the day (as well as how huge esports currently is). 
---
it's just a matter of will it be the same? probably not.  but since you already know you enjoy the idea of classic (playing on private), just imagine if none of those elitists existed and everyone was on the same learning page. that is what classic could be. and probably will be. because it's not going to be vets who are playing it. they will make up a very small fraction if this is a success. and that is where the 'spark' lies when people talk about the glory days. whether it's minecraft, dayz, halo, pokemon, etc. that's my opinion anyway.
---
??
---
You realize a decent portion of people stop playing before those things were even out let alone stopped playing before all the inflation?
---
Why do you even come here then m8? I don't delude my self about shit but if you aren't enjoying it I don't see a reason to even be commenting.
---
rough life, I'm in the same boat my dude
---
Ty. that countdown widget was what i needed
---
Oh the memories...
---
All wrong
---
That does not seem to be like a possible explanation.  We have other beta player footage (tips) showing the tigers hitting them for the correct amount (5-7).  So it doesn't seem to be related to version unless the two beta players right now are playing different versions of the game on the same server (basically impossible).
---
PvP but i hear that you need to do raids to get gears for pvp
---
Yeah dude. Real names are POG
---
You're right.  I realize my intuition must be wrong.  I think the hard hitting dungeon trash is more of a thing in 50+ dungeons, which is what is skewing everyone's perception.
---
I also wonder this.
---
Originally they said they had the source for 1.12 in their repository but no longer have the database, which was important for the state of game play so it wasnt possible to do a vanilla remake.
---
Then out of the blue they just casually mentioned they found "development database" (one of the early original blue posts?) At the time I was thinking there may be the possibility the database is not 100%, otherwise why mention it as development. Probably the closest thing they/we have but may already have had some changes/modifications made to it while developing the game back then (into TBC?)? A possibility but cant know for sure.
---
ya, I don't think it'd be able to sustain #1 unless there are popular streamers going through special content or such. plus there aren't bg's
---
oh I know I leveled a priest in vanilla, but you spend 95% of your time wanding :p
---
Having been out of touch with WoW for a number of years now, I was real surprised to hear a dude in that clip lol
---
It's all because of efficiencyscape, it's the same situation with osrs. People don't want to play for fun for fear of being left behind by others. It then instills an elitist mentality which everyone has to prove that they're better than the other through any sort of means. It's a community that you're gonna have to learn to live with. Osrs has been fighting it since the game started to no avail. It'll more than likely become the norm in this game as well.
---
Any chance I can get this without the text? I like the picture and what it would represent. Data is beautiful, thanks OP
---
Ughhhh cant waiiiittt!
---
LET ME INNN
---
Bottom left is bae &lt;3
---
I mean that's why they call it a majority and not everyone, because a minority of people exist. 
---
Still pretty sure he's guessing simply due to the immaturity that fosters on private servers but I'm 27 and love that vibe because that's how I was in 2004.
---
Come check out the stream broski it's a blast
---
It's a fucking beta. Sit down.
---
So the discrepancy is between the players in the game? Certainly that has to be explainable.
---
But even still, what's up with the dungeons? In Asmon's stream, they were breezing through Stockades pulling 5-6 elite at a time without any CC, bad tanking, and barely any healing. Blizz can argue that we're all just misremembering the game, but not to that extent.
---
US servers can't get here soon enough
---
Man. The forums even during BC were a drama filled shit-show half of the time. This is nothing new.
---
We did it boys, we are ahead of "Just Chatting."
---
It was true until about a year ago, vanilla CMangos used post XP squish quest rewards so servers like Ely wound up with every quest beyond level 30 giving 30% or more extra XP.
---
Most popular servers fixed it when it became really well known and people started using caches pages from thottbot, etc to prove they were wrong.
---
Go skinning/herb and vendor your leathers as you level, you end up with a decent chunk when you optimize your skills to only what you need as you level up. At 60 I always found farming water elementals in either Felwood or EPL to be pretty decent especially if you save them for Hide of the Wild patch (BiS cloak for a LONG time for almost every healing class). If elementals are too busy I'd run around herbing and killing the odd satyr for Fel Cloth in Felwood or carrion grubs in EPL for their acid (also for hide of wild). Overall pretty decent money, but nothing crazy. Once Dire Maul opens you can 2-3 man DM:east jump runs with an enchanter friend and miner for best results. Druid doesn't really have a niche farming method like some of the other classes.
---
To be fair, Themechanic is insanely bad. He was whining the other day that his scatter shot "missed" when he used it on a target with dots.
---
He also needed coaching to understand why scatter shot --&gt; fd --&gt; trap was good.
---
a tourist is someone who is going to jump into classic and then leave shortly after. 
---
a retail baby is someone who defends BfA, when retial wow is objectively terrible and is known to be bad due to CONSISTENTLY FALLING SUBSCRIBER COUNT. 
---
there isnt a single thing retail wow has done thats an improvement upon the game other than graphical fidelity. so anyone who defends retail deserves to get shit on.
---
Ding!
---
that and the other factors that people always discount, such as us being much younger, worse at WoW, with worse computers, internet, the whole nine yards, which makes a huge difference. i remember raiding BWL at 5-10 FPS, in fact.
---
The hyperbole on thia sub is like nothing I've ever seen. Every small issue IN A BETA is apparently the end of Classic and Blizzard are just lying.
---
I've killed hogger 15+ times today. The drop rate on the gnoll quest armbands in his area is hilariously low
---
Same. I played for the last half of vanilla, but only made it to lvl 12 on my main and lvl 8 on my alt. I mainly derped around exploring and dying a fuck ton.
---
I hit 60 half way through BC and hit 70 a couple weeks later.
---
&gt; It's been shown the majority of people playing on private servers are below the age of 21
---
this reeks of bullshit bro lol, I did a few runs on diff servers and rarely encountered children
---
hes not wrong
---
cdew
---
A friend gave me a trial and we rolled nightelves together. He was trying to show me how to play when I ran through a tree and landed in water and got stuck. In between screams of 'oh shit you can drown' and trying to reorient my camera to try and figure out which way was up, I drowned. Neither of us could stop laughing for the longest time.
---
Did they ever finish the quest line from this place? I kept that item in my bank forever.
---
And naturally this thread just turns into another salt fest.
---
I swear this subreddit needs like 7 million Xanax to just calm down.
---
BRUH, The massive fights between SS and TM, when contribution points were a thing...the best times in wow
---
Man, I got so desperate I resubbed to bfa, unlucked the new allied races, dicked around on hearthstone, then went back to binging streams and scanning forums.
---
THE THIRST IS FUCKING REAL!!
---
Themechanic and Skorch both are terrible tho, they legitimately are bad players fundamentally and mechanically. No idea what a Bobka is or who the fook he is, but he's right in this scenario.
---
still dont understand why people watch him. He's a noob at every game he plays too
---
This needs to be posted to the official forums.
---
after long enough the night elves become sexy enough to get the job done
---
all the classes are fine in PVP. a well-geared warrior is basically a fucking god in PVP.
---
you don't necessarily need to do raids to get PVP gear, but, it was much more accessibly then trying for the Marshal/Field Marshal gear, which was an incredible grind.
---
There's only so much damage mitigation that goes on at level 8, and none of it appears to be sufficient to explain the difference.
---
I feel like the equipment is even bigger. Mice with 12 hotkeys? Internet connections that dont shit out mid Rag pull? 60 fps in raids stable? These things much more than skill will let the average player crush classic wow.
---
You realise wrong then.
---
Ya missed the OP point, Classic uses modern APL which means old macros people used in Vanilla and private servers wont work unless they get tweaked for the APL it uses
---
Omg It took me since  you posted this 3h to realize  that  drink ON YOUR toon and not IRL. I completely  forgot about drunk  toons haha
---
Brotha get tired running 20-30 minutes to that destination
---
"big claims" as if it fucking matters who discovered it first.
---
Do you have anything to say on the subject u/NanoNostalrius I remember you said you did some scripting for nost. Does current damage in dungeons looks normal to you?
---
well when they announced it they mentioned "vanilla" so that reason was probably marketability and general understanding
---
bruh, you are vastly over exaggerating and its not like you have to do all that stuff on the same day. No ones gonna argue that retail isnt a instagratification loot slot machine but  your acting like in comparison vanilla was a full time job. I went to highschool,, played sports, worked at mcdonalds and still managed to raid in classic.  If you build a good social group you can count on, its very easy to be efficient with your time.
---
I know how you feel, but there's 0 chance anything about this date is going to be changed. There is a reason why blizzard waited so long before an announcement date. It's because they want to stick with it and know it's reasonable.
---
Sounds like something a cata baby would say. I played in the beta back in 2001
---
Well, you opt in for beta with your battle.net account. So my account meets both criteria.
---
Looting Perdition's Blade. It was our first Rag kill, and we had been busting ass to far fire resist gear, nets for the Sons, fire protection pots, everything. I went from using Barman's Shanker straight up to Perdition's. Absolutely amazing.
---
Post this on blizzards support / beta forums.
---
&gt;ass mon gold and staybugged
---
Try again.
---
You just proved OP and my point. 
---
You downvoted a dissenting opinion and literally described what the insults mean. You didn’t even address the fact that the terms are literally used as insults against people wanting to play who may have more experience with the original Vanilla than you. 
---
“there isnt a single thing retail wow has done thats an improvement upon the game other than graphical fidelity. so anyone who defends retail deserves to get shit on.”
---
You mean aside from the extremely blatant things that get praised even in BFA? Like this comment proves my point, you know Jack shit about BFA and are gatekeeping and hating for hating sake. 
---
Oh and BTW Raiding, M+ and individual stories like Runnas the Shamed, and Rastakhans Resurection and Assault on Zuldazar are regarded greatly. Hell we had a meme not to long ago about Rastakhan quickly becoming the most liked character only to die. He was even cry dabbing in it.
---
I agree, I would find it cool and refreshing to have harder bosses or new mechanics added to existing dungeon bosses or raid bosses. It will still be the same social game we love, just a bit harder and not like a stampede trough content like private servers are now
---
I'm in the same boat
---
Heh, Illidown...
---
Compared to retail bosses it is that easy though. Vanilla raiding was hard for a whole other reason.
---
Brain deadly
---
The tables have turned.
---
I think them being out for 15 years has trivialized them by now. People will still wipe on them don't worry.
---
This sounds like a fun topic, so I'd love to help if you'd be willing to play along and answer some questions.  I'd like to get a feel for a few things.
---
First off, what sort of fantasies do you enjoy in terms of, well, character archetypes for fantasy settings?  Do you like the idea of getting up close and personal and hitting people, or would you prefer to work from the backlines with spells and arrows and whatnot?  If you would choose to be a wizard, would you want to be a whimsical, predominantly benevolent one that turns people into sheep, or would you prefer to be a big bad and summon demons while burning your enemies to cinders?  Gimme an idea of what kind of fantasy combat style and overall lifestyle would do it for you the most.  For context, if it would help you toy with the question, [these are the available classes.](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Class)
---
Second, do you tend to play any other games outside of WoW?  If so, what do you tend to gain gratification from?  Actively helping others?  Making something of yourself?  Perfecting a craft, like sewing magical robes, enchanting items, or brewing potions?  Exploring the world purely for the sake of it?  Delving into the questing experience to get a feel for the world and its story?  What sort of thing like that would you enjoy the most?
---
The last thing I'll ask for now is what kind of fiction and literary themes you tend to enjoy.  I would use that knowledge to determine what kind of lore to show you to get you more interested in the game.  Like, if you're in love with zombie apocalypse stuff like my sister is, then boy oh boy does Warcraft have content to give you for lore reading and questing zones.  If you would like to go back to the roots of all this, perhaps you might want to know how the orcs came to the world of Azeroth to start their endless warring with the humans and their allies.  Or, for all I'd know you'd like to focus on some comedic elements, in which case I could point you to certain sources, and the contrary can be said as well of horror-themed questlines I could tell you to look out for when you get into beta/ when Classic launches.
---
No on private servers if your dot killsgets the kill doesn't matter as long as you're draining you get a shard. Staysafe has treated this extensively.
---
1-9? What about the 12 months that lead to the "1"? You mean 0-9?
---
I think they do, this is a matter of the stat squishes having some lingering impact on modern clients vs the 1.12 data they layered over it.
---
I literally had people telling me to KMS a few weeks ago and people harassing me because I like the new forsaken models and tongue physics, especially the physics.
---
Chicken Breast + Olive Oil + Bruschetta Seasoning, in the oven at 350 for 30 min, will be good flavorful moist chicken. Its my favorite to make for lunch.
---
You are the man, thank you!
---
Just play a nelf priest, once you get to Black Mageweave you wont need porn.
---
They're pissed off because while streamers get payed thousands of dollars a day to play their favourite game they're stuck slaving away begging for a half day off. Pathetic if you ask me.
---
I did it.. Did you? And if so.. did you get in?
---
It’s actually a quite steady exp increase. Compared to something like olschool runescape where level 94 on a skill is literally halfway to the maximum level of 99, the frustration of it has become a parody so much so that the community has created the meme of “94 is half of 99”.
---
Hes holding a vial in his hand, probably just drank a swiftness pot?
---
So now it is a useless talent pretty much...
---
Looks like he drank a potion... he was carrying one or what looked like  a potion.
---
I sure hope he does. I miss old swifty. Lol. Was pretty sad seeing him lose popularity over time. He was like the benchmark and I even used to watch a ton on his IRL channel now he has a lotta subs but doesn’t get as much views. But I know he focuses more on twitch now.
---
You might have to create an NA account but yes it is entirely possible.
---
As long as i can play before i have to start uni  next semester... -.-
---
Well, I'm gonna play on a pve server, but I would want to dabble a bit in bgs
---
Ah I see that’s good news, I’ll contact Blizzard support and ask exactly how to do this.
---
As long as the area you're travelling to has your classes trainer there's no real reason you couldn't. But if you're a Tauren druid and you go to the undead zone you're going to have to travel back to Mulgore to train skills.

Has this guy an email or a webpage where i can thank him. ;) This Dude is an absolutely hero in my eyes !
---
I found that massaging my own prostate feels adventurous enough to make up for a non-existent sex partner OR someone who is disgusted by your addiction to WoW. Amazing orgasms
---
You mean 60, right?
---
swiftness pot
---
It would be a walk in the park either way, these aren't hard bosses. No matter how much you want to believe they are.  
---
That being said, there are still going to be guilds that struggle on them, but the # of debuffs allowed isn't really going to change whether a guild can kill it or not.  
---
   
---
I'm 100% for buffing raids and making them realistically challenging because without any challenge it's going to feel like you're just hitting a target dummy that has a 1% chance of dropping gear for you.
---
I'm paying for beta... while me and my wife wait for a chance we're seeing how terrible retail is. It's making us want classic to come that much sooner. It's pretty entertaining to watch her point out how frustrating and easy it is as we level.
---
SUB - try retail WoW, and let that show you how much we need classic wow because what is there right now isn't that good. Just don't bet on getting the inv.
---
I love these Omar memes. They're so wholesome
---
Omar, The Man, The Brain and The absolutely hero !! 
---
I will thank him so much times, every mob i killed, every quest i turn in, every login i will do ! Thank you so much Omar !!
---
no. on private any dmg from the warlock procs it
---
Hes a firestarter, twisted firestarter.
---
I used the word ability in an effort to encompass all the improvements in players today. You are very right that equipment is a huge factor in this discussion.
---
more or less yeah its not great. voidwalker aggro is also way way way worse on the beta than on private servers so you either need to go demo much earlier or use the imp
---
thats eu
---
Imagine being an adult and being this mad over a video game
---
when classic came out, i learned frenchin school. 
---
i thought it would be really smart to have the name end with the feminine ending „ée“, since its a female char.
---
Pretty much these dudes will bail as soon as the hype dies down they don't enjoy this but there's thousands of dollars at stake for them in donations.
---
Everyone think they will get sulfuras and do sick 1shot montage videos so a lot of people will roll enhance.
---
Having some kind of "hc" mode of vanilla raids would be really fucking cool.
---
Redoing MC/BWL/ZG/AQ/Naxx with modern boss design in mind. I was talking to a friend yesterday about how the 3 drakes could probably be one big boss fight - as an example.
---
This is my favorite kinda shit in mmos. Just rolling up on another gang and letting stuff play out real-time. The social aspects in classic we're and still are top notch!
---
I've been through 3 WoW forum revamps and 2 subreddits. Buddy it isn't the sub. It's gamers and internet culture in general. We're little shits.
---
Well not only did Blizz seem to prioritize streamers for beta access, there is a shitload of bugs in the game and to top it off it doesn't release for another 3 months. For a game already made, being ported to just a newer version of the engine and it for some reason takes blizzard 2 &amp; a half years to accomplish this task.
---
It's pretty understandable that one or more of these things would annoy players. That's not to say there isn't also a lot of constructive criticism and people putting in effort to try and point things out for the better of the game, because there is a lot of this.
---
Oh man this would be broken and is definitely not right but I almost secretly hope it slides through to live. If my bear can somehow change in and out of leather armor and swap his staff for a hammer, he should be able to crush that damn potion in his mouth.
---
Those thumbnails have been proven effective for like 10 years now. If you could do one small insignificant change at your job to make x% more money you would to.
---
There's some information missing in there, here i fixed it for you  [https://i.imgur.com/XWqNKMn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XWqNKMn.jpg)
---
BGs are still a lot of fun. You can get really good gear from the honor system.
---
Flaming streamers for no reason at all?
---
Them lying about having played vanilla when they didn't, lying to their viewers, FOR MONEY, and pretending to be authority figures when they clearly are not is NOTHING AT ALL?
---
Lmao, you're a fucking baby, grow up
---
The content that only a few see is what drives the masses behind it IMO.
---
RP with the ganking!
---
was it not him abusing glitches in burning crusade?
---
+1
---
That's false, one you have shit on farm you don't need any consumable for raiding, consumables, especially mass consumables is for pushing progress when you're gear is sub par or if you're doing speed runs, once your raid has started to geared and is just farming current content consumables or not needed nor is the upkeep to constantly farm them.
---
This shit is gold! I’m poor so I don’t have gold for you but man you deserve some gold!
---
The only time I remember forum not being a shit show was pre-vanilla beta. The moment it became open to general public? Quickly turned into the drama shitshow we know today.
---
Not sure about the druid, but farming crusader orbs just below Hearthglen at WPL will be my choice again.
---
are you that naive that you think every single bug report is going to be detailed and legitimate?
---
It will change the meta that's for sure!
---
But I agree with above, MC and BWL aren't really that challenging as raids
---
I do believe however that what will make them feel easier is 1.12.1 itemisation of dungeon gear and early T1. The itemisation is alot better in this patch than 1.1-1.5 and will definitely contribute to the first raid tier feeling easier.
---
AQ and Naxx however will still be alot hard in comparison.
---
Because he wants to RP AND have open world PvP? Seems pretty obvious to me.
---
I'm so glad I won't have to deal with kids at the launch. Will make it far more enjoyable for me as I work the weekends so I won't see them then either :D
---
You’re taking the news about your friend surprisingly well.
---
are you using command lines to use it? I think on the PTR originally you had to use command lines before it was added into the UI to enable it properly
---
I always took all my undead characters to mulgor because i hated the undead zone and i wanted to be close to the barrens.
---
Yep. mods better get their shit together because the elitism is going to come in fast and hard and I won't be sticking around.
---
The only time there wasn't a queue
---
also this https://i.redd.it/7ny7nki0l0z21.png
---
You almost got me change my mind! Planning to play a dwarf, but god I love those little bastards
---
RFC actually was that easy though
---
You’re taking the news that your friend is a pleb surprisingly well.
---
If you don’t care about leveling hella slow because your with the Zerg, not really as long as your class trainer exists there.
---
Have fun being in the Zerg though
---
You’re taking the news that your friend is a insane surprisingly well.
---
Hell yeah brother!
---
Those trails were in WoW back then, but they were for player characters only, glitchy, and probably varied considerably based on your graphics card and maybe other hardware; same for Slice and Dice's yellow trail.  Now that computer hardware is, of course, incomparably superior to back then, trails are practically always going to properly show.
---
That said, at about WoD's time, they did seem to update the trails with a very similar, fuller/thicker effect that never glitched, so if it's *that* kind of trail, then yeah, that's inconsistent but also hard to tell for sure.
---
From what i can tell its not just what its called in the api.
---
In fact this entire thread is about a gameplay difference that is a result of no "real focus frames".
---
Improved graphics, bigger exes in the background, discord and google chrome would like a word.
---
dual spec was just another convenience feature that cheapened talent choice. unpopular opinion but artifact weapons forcing people to actually pick a spec was a good thing.
---
there goes my ryzen down the tubes then.
---
I HIGHLY prefer private server life to retail life, and even I would be upset if someone was talking about retail numbers while referencing private server numbers. Is it really that big of a problem?
---
And if ignoring evidence that disproves him like the Druid buff to give more armor
---
oh, there's a period before release that we get to make our characters?
---
Videos are hard man, because showing them end game is such a hard pill because the truth is it will be months of long sessions before they get there haha.
---
But any kenion PvP video. Eviscerape from memory.
---
Any grand marshal warrior video. Maydie was most famous.
---
She has Mark of the Wild buff in the 2nd video and not the first
---
I used to take my Dwarf and Gnome characters to Elwynn Forest to start training. Come to think of it, I don't think I ever used Deeprun Tram during that process. What a moron I was.
---
Did you take into account the MotW buff giving her armor?
---
Classic WoW, meet Outrage Culture. Do you miss 2004 yet?
---
BfA and a insta 60 p server... I actually like bfa, I stopped mid wod and I’m not disappointed. They did take out some of my favorite spells, but I like my demon hunter whom I am maining now.
---
I sold Blackstone rings/other mara princess loot. Nor as efficient as hunters and rogues but doable.
---
Please tell me then how to level a shaman faster/easier than with earthbind kiting? I'm waiting...
---
Does anyone know if the max allowed in vanilla was 16 or did it end up going even higher?
---
Good find, and too bad. Here’s to hoping it’s upgradeable in the future without to much of an issue
---
Not to mention that thousands of people watch the streamers and they can notice something people who have beta don´t.
---
I'm 21 and I remeber playing vanilla. 
---
I died a lot 
---
I didn't get past like 20. But I remeber it. 
---
People who leveled and played in BC still count I'd say. The game didnt change that massive until about wrath/cata
---
If they named a server after him i would play on it.
---
I did this on private realms to get night elf mount by 40-45 on gnomes. Sucks there's no Mage trainer there for classic launch :( 
---
There is also a few different ways that servers handle the level 1 mission from Dun Morough to Teldrassil too. 
---
In some versions of vanilla you could ghost run to any other GY and ress. So dying in sun Morough and ghost running safely to wetlands then reading right by menethil was easy and quick (ghosts run faster) plus obviously not dying half a dozen times.
---
Some other versions you could actually take the boat to night elf zone as a ghost. And it would ress you when you came out of the loading screen.
---
Someone with beta access test this subtly please!!!
---
If they played MMOs before you'll have a chance with videos (try the Leeroy Jenkins video).
---
If they havent played MMOs, its a tough sell
---
The one where he takes less also has a motw buff
---
well obviously if you enjoy retail you'd feel threatened by the possibility that a large amount of players are gonna go off to play this other thing.
---
... and they should be. I think there is a large possibility that retail craters when classic launches.
---
16 was the max in vanilla. it used to be 8.
---
Why plural?
---
They're great healers at all phases of the game but I would say they are strongest during naxx and going into bwl. There were a few priests contemplating quitting the game cuz the paladins would just snipe them in heals and they felt useless. They got over it once they started to get bwl gear though since that's a huge power spike for them. Paladins are ok healers in pvp, they're good against melee but the lack of hots and instant heals makes them the least mobile of them since they have to stand there casting a heal, that also makes them susceptible to counterspells and curse of tounges wrecks them. They are still great to have in each bg for different reasons. In wsg they provide blessing of freedom for flag carriers and can BoP your squishy clothies from the melee so they can wreck face without worrying about those pesky wars and rouge's. AV is more of a pve game so all your pve strengths shine there. If you're geared you can also tank the generals and such. AB is probably where they shine least since they aren't that great at defending points on their own and there tend to be quite a bit of shaman's in AB since it's arguably their best BG. Shaman's counter you hard, but you still bring the same utility as always. For both AB and WSG you'll want to find the best warrior in there and just use blessing of freedom on cool down for him. He will wreck face.
---
Different gear, she doesnt have the same armor value
---
I jumped and only went up 1m. Reporting in case jump height is supposed to be any measurement other than exactly 1m.
---
Yeah..reporting shit because it MIGHT be a bug is silly af.
---
Yeah it was that easy I did SFK with 3 people all the time
---
There are things that would dissuade some people from doing so, such as not having a class trainer in that area if that zone's races can't be that class. Also if the zone is hard to reach.  
---
But with that said, I think it's perfectly valid to suffer those consequences for the first zones if that is what you really want to do. You can survive for quite a long time with level 1 spells before you have to go back and train anyway.  
---
Also if you're trying to increase your reputation with that particular faction, I think it's very worth while.
---
That’s my guess. Probably BWL onwards instead of Naxx. Warlocks are mainly held back by lack of hit on early game gear, but with updated stats on items and new item drops in 1.12 there will be a lot more gear worth hit on it.
---
Its legit. I stayed up all night running tests.
---
It wasnt 8 it was 3. The most he pulled were the horses.
---
This guy's not gonna make it in vanilla lmao.
---
Vanilla isn't cry baby friendly
---
100% restart!
---
It's crazy cause i played a lock and we cleared everything except aq40 and naxx and i dont even remember my guild caring about the debuff stuff.  Damn were we that bad or maybe i just dont remember.
---
Wait till you get setup for a UBRS run from Org.
---
Leveling up in Thousand Needles, the alliance raid (Both level 60, a priest and I think a warrior) and kill all the quest givers. The priest mind controls me and makes me run off a cliff.  
---
I run back up and then try to hide, they find me again and mind control me again. The priest is legit talking to me (I can't remember when they removed this function, but this was legit the only way to talk cross faction that I can remember besides some broken /me emotes). I think I was able to talk back to him but this was so long ago. Eventually they stopped killing me once some high level horde came (who also got MC'd off the cliff) who were able to provide a distraction for me to go elsewhere. Priest was pretty chill when talking to me, even apologizing.
---
You used to simply purchase the version of WoW on the US battlenet store, that gives you a NA copy but i made an NA account about 2 years ago so still worth checking.
---
You can have both on the same battlenet too, but they need seperate subs and your mounts and shit don't transfer (though irrelevant for classic outside of collectors edition rewards).
---
You know you're in the right place if it's priced in dollars.
---
I genuinely feel for Blizzard sometimes. They literally cannot win whatever they decide to do, so many threads about what will they do after Classic etc etc and people already looking for answers from them about this.
---
Hang on a second! The game hasn’t even released yet and people are already looking at getting future expansions already, like come on give them a break..
---
Yes it will be something that they will need to tackle but that won’t be anytime soon I would presume, just sit back, wait and enjoy Classic when it releases and give them a break!
---
Good point. I hope that does not happen. That would be lame! I do not plan on doing that myself. I hope I get the time off approved!
---
Heh.
---
They were way lower than him
---
Was bored, not getting into the beta yet so decided to write this Refresher guide for new/returning players coming back to Twink in classic!
---
Does it offend you?
---
I thought this was /r/wowcirclejerk for a sec.
---
Lets not lose sight of the fact that many of the changes added in TBC and onwards were made in a different decade, with lower expectations, and for a different audience that lacked the hindsight we have. 
---
I’m going through old Developer Q&amp;As and one of the community questions was: “Will the two priest healing specs be equal and not one required for raiding and the other *almost ignored?*”
---
This is someone who is clearly playing a different MMO at this point.
---
But believe it or not, but there were players in Vanilla who complained about certain talent trees being “useless” and they’re the kind of player who defines gameplay satisfaction in terms of a perfectly fair boardgame instead of the imperfect, charmingly wonky design of Classic.
---
The impression I get from Kevin Jordan and John Staats on Classicast interviews is that they defined gameplay satisfaction in terms of *feel* over functionality. It takes the discipline, vision, stubbornness to return to that prototypal design *vibe* that leads to organic and flavorful experiences.
---
&gt; “... our philosophy was always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the paladin tank a certain way make the warrior tank a certain way and to a lesser extent make the void walker tank a certain way, just have him feel differently, have the function differently so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.”
---
This type of philosophy kind of prioritizes *feeling* over *functionality.* It means that yeah, one of those tanks is numerically always going to be *the better tank.* But it's going to feel different than the other ones and that’s a *good thing.*
---
For example, a lot of folks think class-specific buffs and abilities are bad design because they exacerbate class imbalance. Remember the huge uproar over Surrender to Madness—one of the most fun, spec-defining, flavorful talents ever added? The Legion community did not deserve the awesomeness of Surrender to Madness. That Shadow Priest “balance” controversy is when I realized most current WoW players simply have no *taste.*
---
So how do you go back when everytime you try you get pushback? It involves nerves of steel and a willingness to look really, really dumb. Would players really allow the game to regress to Vanilla design?
---
* Imagine if Death Knights had been released, but two of the specs were half-baked, kind of experimental, and eventually unviable (Elemental + Enhancement Shaman)—yet filled with great RP and flavor? 
---
* Imagine if they returned to the system where quest writers worked *after* the world had already been built and populated by a different team?
---
* Imagine they didn't cut so much WoD content for time, but instead, like the half-finished areas of Classic, they kept all that useless stuff in for exploration / lore reasons?
---
* Imagine doubling down on loose, frustrating itemization instead of pursuing the impossible task of perfect spec balance (a situation that the community has been complicit in.)
---
A much deeper problem is the rarely challenged idea that an expansion is a flawed paradigm for an MMO to begin with.
---
You're adding experience levels to a world that was never intended to support them. You're adding game-changing content to a holistic, self-contained world that was never designed with that content in mind—but I'll stop there. That's a whole separate problem.
---
Jesus Omar memes are rising in stock value, I'm investing in this.
---
It is elite mob damage in dungeons that is in question, not the mob damage of the outdoors mobs.
---
Its based on his videos and his own words.
---
People called it VC because the main appeal of going there was for the Alliance quest rewarding really good blues that called for you to kill Van Cleef. People would then look for a group for VC, because they are looking to do the quest more so than the dungeon. 
---
It stuck around as the name for the dungeon because it's easier to say VC for dead mines and DM for dire maul, that way there's misinterpreting what people meant when they said DM.
---
Asmon got hit for 258 on the same attack
---
it does prove it though. There is videos of both normal damage and abnormal damage happening with those tigers in the classic beta to the same person. What more proof do you need that there is obviously a bug happening somewhere, even if it's super inconsistent?
---
No they would transfer....Just because it's easier doesn't mean it woudln't transfer.
---
FF14, WoW, and SWTOR my three are all almost exactly the same
---
If people took MMO's seriously the way they do DOTA or Starcraft 2 there would be legions of people who were playing at near skill ceiling.
---
No this is only justifying them as bad and vanilla as too easy
---
This. People forget a subreddit with 100k subs, a lot less who actually post, is not the entire community by a long shot.
---
What do you think the issue is?
---
Is the big thread at the top there's a lot of video evidence that the SFK mobs were doing accurate damage. The only mob I've seen not do accurate damage so far is the Joana tiger.
---
That’s just horrible. Some people take any opportunity to feel elitist because that’s all they can cling on to.
---
Also if you want to play for fun and join my guild, hit me up near launch :)
---
It's just that he knows how to itemize and tank and you didn't
---
That's what you should do I guess - just run dungeons, get gather pre-raid bis, grind in between and don't worry about the level too much, basically play as if you were a 60 and you will ding.
---
This is of course unless you have a way to get into MC without having pre-raid bis (a guild who want to carry you), in which case the sooner the better.
---
Classic wow is the reason wow was so successful. Sure people like saying wrath or bc was better, but vanilla and the content in vanilla is what got everyone hooked.
---
I just spent the night running around doing quests in loch modan. And it had a hard time logging out. Meanwhile on bfa it just feels like chores
---
What would indicate that there would be an AV meta? And I highly doubt a solo Druid can grind the nonstop 8 min WSG and 6 minute AB wins a good premade will consistently. Smaller servers will just make it easier for a premade to monopolize the brackets since, again, solo players shouldn’t be able to keep up with consistent fast wins on the current BG weekend. Too much variance in teams on either side, and from my own private server experience there are entirely too many people willing to turtle with 10 people just to stall a loss to spite the other team.
---
This is going to be the best! And the nicest thing is how everyone starts from the scratch. So excited.
---
You know, I've been trying to remember the name of an orc warrior on Illidan from Vanilla.  I can't for the life of me remember it, but if I saw it I would.  Were you level 60?
---
Good, no changes!
---
Ive had a classic account have PVP rank and all to prove, i have 5 wow accounts, a friend who works at blizzard, and i have been raiding in BFA mythic current content ( Been subbed sense vanilla ) with a off time here or there in WoD and mid BFA. Still no invite as far as i am concerned its just random. Good luck to anyone godspeed. I know i am counting down the days on a calendar myself. I just wanna be 14 again like a kid at a candy store playing old classic like i did on my old night elf hunter. I miss old wow and have for some time now.
---
The comments revealed that their attack speed is different, but the overall damage output is the same.
---
You literally get a swiftness potion from a quest in the crossroads, come on buddy.
---
Incorrect.
---
If you're talking about that Asmongold clip where Nefaru is only hitting him for 55-65 damage instead of hundreds, [that has already been debunked.](https://i.imgur.com/Hoks0hh.png)
---
why is this important? Do you think these people are paying for the subscription to search for bugs? Or would they rather just play the game?
---
If anything I have learned the past weekend, it's that this sub hates streamers who "just play" the game, but if the average joe very obviously is trying to do that, it's fine.
---
Many people in this sub are mentally handicapped and don't need classic wow to be challenged..
---
Kind of off topic, but I find it funny you put a picture that has mobs from TBC in a vanilla mob damage discussion.
---
Classic will do well weather or not people gatekeep.
---
Dynamic respawns werent in vanilla
---
It's really good. The host is amazing. Really a top tier podcast, especially for one that is hours long per episode
---
Now even the starter gear has armour. Not very much bit it had armour
---
Theres also more mobs and more mobile mobs patting around making beta pretty dangerous in some areas
---
He's straight up holding the potion still.
---
Personally as a Shaman im toying with the idea of running to the zepplin &gt; UC FP &gt; Sepulcher FP &gt; Tarren Mill FP &gt; Hearthstone back to Durotar &gt; take the little path to Ratchet FP &gt; Crossroads FP &gt; Camp T FP &gt; and start leveling in the Tauren zone. 
---
I get setup for most of my water totem quest, maybe get 2 or 3 levels and all of my FPs. Plus I hate durotar leveling, especially because 2 races funnel into it where as Tauren is pretty simple.
---
It doesn't need it. I've seen one streamer with the fps counter and his fps was way above 200 at all times. 
---
Also you're doing scuffed cpu testing @1440p. Even retail wow before the cpu improvement patch didn't do much when playing @1440p(&amp; above). Anything above 1080p gives more work for the gpu.
---
Yeah I understand that, I'm asking why he wouldn't play if there weren't rp-pvp servers. Like why not just play with an RP guild on a pvp server (especially since if there are no rp-pvp servers, there will definitely be a solid amount of people trying to take part in rppvp and they would likely all be on pvp servers.)
---
Shooting down 3 people before sending the pet in? Definitely classic lol.
---
Yeah, people are saying the numbers will be huge for launch etc. I don’t buy it. Don’t get me wrong, I love the game, but why would you want to watch someone stream the leveling process if you’re interested in the game, you’d rather play it yourself, right? 
---
But it’s for sure a great indicator of the interest and hype surrounding it. 
---
I’m sure world firsts and stuff will get high numbers tho.
---
it is 10+
---
The debuff was bummed to 16 in 1.7. so September 05. Wow only had 4 million players at that time, and a much smaller fraction of those were raiding. So the majority of even vanilla players never experienced it
---
Actually the thread shows the dmg being the same
---
Trying to find a dog...
---
There is some controversy on what the honor values should be in AV.
---
AB won't be out til people are done ranking that won't matter.
---
WSG if your team is bad could easily get beat by one guy....Teams have schedules they can't just rank 24/7. If you push them as a solo player to start playing on their own breaking up their schedule you're already winning. Way harder to maintain brackets that way you've gone FFA hahaha
---
Just need to put those hours in, people will start caving too if you're really good. Especially helmet, people love laying down for a helmet. Disgusting hippy horde
---
Well he was right to report the bug as the pants had amour but the boots did not.
---
Amagaaaad someone used swiftness potion!!!
---
Anyone with a low end pc can run this game very well even with the improved "classic engine". With a dedicated gpu/cpu that is, &amp; it doesn't even have to be an expensive one.
---
Except it's not a bug, that is how it was in vanilla, it is working as intended.
---
Everything else was disgusting too, not this
---
This is the huge nerd in me, but what’s the actual mathematical formula to calculate this, and does that formula hold true for expacs as well? I’ve actually always wanted to know.
---
I still have my unarmored ivory raptor to this day &lt;3  well... to the last day i subbed.. which was about mid legion.
---
Anecdotally, almost everyone non-streamer in the beta is from 2004 with a few 2005s; source - barrens chat in the beta

*wake me up when August almost ends*...

You know this is reddit, being toxic is what reddit is all about.
---
Can you use a Battle.net Store Gift Card to purchase Wow time? 
---
I looked on the Blizzard site but did not see an answer.
---
I don't know what DAE stands for but streamers who pretend like they're Vanilla veterans while actually knowing squat and being a noob but at the same time being so prideful about having access to the beta before everyone else is definitely = BAD.
---
You are just as bad now by the way. Way to go son.

Watch that.
---
The damage in SFK was normal - what you are remembering and comparing it to is 15 years in time between people being low level for the 1st and probably having no idea what to do and people who have played the game for 15 years and know it like the back of Thier hand.
---
If anything , it's the cast frequency of abilities that is wrong, not the damage values in dungeons.
---
It's pretty good for a vanilla UI to be fair.
---

I kind of want to roll a class with ress now just for that.

That's how I felt when I started playing Vanilla again on Nostalrius. The whole having to get around on foot made the world seem so much larger and it was definitely more dangerous
---
Hi, /u/jstock23
---
They have a golden opportunity with Classic to reboot with these design philosophies.  If Classic is a success I will be curious to see what *they* conclude is the reason for its success.
---
I think it would take an entirely different design culture than what Blizzard currently has to create new content around these ideals.
---
This is what makes me hate being an apple user. After my iPhone X goes to shit, I’m switching to android and never looking back.
---
It is a bug because those boots don’t even have a durability.
---
I'm in beta and am planning on testing that in a few levels. I'll post back if no on else has.
---
Fear ward is for priests. I'd just go human for the diplo bonus.
---
False, he was actually smart player back in the day
---
He was never skilled but his smart game made him famous 
---
Watch Swifty warrior tricks he was coming up with things no one ever tried before
---
What a name lmao
---
You're just trying to steal world first!
---
Leveling a shaman without earthbind kiting is not awful.
---
This is what we need more of.
---
"terrorists are representative of the entire muslim community because the only muslims I'm seeing are the ones flying planes into skyscrapers."
---
Okay dude. Maybe get out more.
---
who is omar
---
Obviously not.
---
This was said purely because ppl in this thread kept saying you could never swap items during combat.
---
Even Swifty said he was thinking you could do it at the start of vanilla - and he wasn't wrong, he remembered it good.
---
On a side note, WoW Classic will be different vs how it was for the people that played during vanilla - because the game changed a lot with every .1 patch during vanilla, they kept adding major game features with every .1 patch, also changing how classes worked. Majority of vanilla players leveled to 60 long before 1.12, with WoW Classic they will level with the 1.12 rules and client features, which is a completely different experience than what it was when they've done it.
---
Yeah but should they be trivialized even more? I can't see why if blizzard was able to re-implement the debuff limit to 16 they couldn't make it 8 for phase 1/2.
---
I googled Omar Gonzalez and all I got is a soccer player :( 
---
Thank you for this.
---
I didnt hear. What happened with ign?
---
The problem is what do you do about the expansion problem?
---
How do you add an expansion to an MMO? Like I said at the end: You're adding experience levels to a world that was never intended to support them. You're adding game-changing content to a holistic, self-contained world that was never designed with that content in mind!
---
*Of course* WoW would start feeling increasingly disconnected and broken and detached from its initial experience.
---
That’s a million dollar question: How do you expand an MMO in a way that doesn't follow the traditional “expansion pack” paradigm? Ion knows what I'm talking about. Remember his off-hand comment where he questioned the need to add experience levels? He wondered out loud what an expansion would feel like if they never added extra levels.
---
It’d be hugely controversial, but that's the kind of out-of-the-box thinking we need because the traditional expansion paradigm simply doesn’t work for an MMO. TBC and WotLK only served to further disconnect the world.
---
Perhaps we need a new way of adding content to an MMO that doesn't involve the expansion pack paradigm.
---
That’s Moses bruh
---
Got a video link and timestamp? I've tried looking it up but I'm not seeing anything.
---
I have a friend over at Blizzard and while they didn't tell me specifically(probably not allowed) they basically told me they aren't working much this weekend and implied a wave wouldn't be going out til next week.
---
Delete this blasphemy
---
Hero!
---
that's a bad example when i'm able to see all of the "muslims" to begin with in a contained environment.
---
If I can see the whole community I can make the claim.
---
Wow, that would be huge. Would that fix the whole charge and end up like 5 yards behind the target? I used to always "love" that. Not only could you not get a hamstring off, you actually had enough distance to pull off an intercrpt, lol
---
Well, you can always play retail during =)
---
Each WoW account, even under the same bnet account, requires its own subscription. So unless you’re paying for two WoW subs then only your active account will be considered for the Classic Beta.
---
/s?
---
The purpose of Reddit is to share meaningful content on a relevant sub, not regurgitate the same bullshit over and over and over just to hear yourself talk.
---
uhhhh
---
Blessing of sacrifice, bubble, blessing of protection, freedom?
---
They are by far the best healer
---
Large scale pvp they're by far best healer because of blessing of protection on mage is ridiculously hard to counter past a few mages even by a 40 man. 
---
WSG they are the best 
---
AB they are not as good because they're basically useless next to other other classes when trying to kill something quickly. Their biggest flaw. But it won't matter because it gets released very late no one will play it. 
---
AV is pretty close. But i'd give that one to paladins because of raid wide buffs. Massive increase to ur disorganized raid. Chain heal also pretty good in that mess tho
---
And 5 man pvp they're the best because they're hardest to CC. If you're only bringing one support you want paladin. Anything else is gonna get CC locked so fast. 
---
Paladins are by far the best healers 40 in vanilla because they're the most mana effecient. And that's what vanilla raiding is all about. Being as mana effecient as possible and keeping it moving. 
---
Priests do not stack well beyond spamming fear ward in 40 mans. And easily CC'd
---
Shaman stack better but don't have raid wide buffs, again easily CC'd
---
Druid don't stack well either, hots don't stack. And again easily CC'd
---
Biggest problem for healers in vanilla PvP? Getting CC'd
---
It is definitely Dr. Damage. I used it all the time back in the day. Really helped me to overthink my spell usage while leveling!
---
Arugal teleports. Saw it happen when soda was running the instance.
---
I cant tell if you are trolling
---
That's the voice of experience. Gonna' do Nelf warrior this time tho, so I can make use of all the bikini plate.
---
I only dropped by every now and then, but this sub seemed super chill, people reminiscing about classic, people asking questions and a generally welcoming experience. After these last couple days, I don't want to visit this sub anymore. The amount of toxicity and stream hate/jealously right now is pretty ridiculous.
---
True, but we already know that.
---
Post thid in the beta bug megathread so the devs see it
---
Bruh I feel so dumb... Omar still Jesus though
---
Idk who this is, but I'm glad he got on the beta instead of you.
---
Sunken Temple was one of my favourite dungeons, I may be in the minority but I think it was the first epic/long dungeon I experienced
---
You seem salty some people can stream for a living.
---
I often roll undead, and I'd typically level until silverpine (there's a big jump in quest levels there) and swap to the crossroads, then back once those quests became green.
---
Basically I'd do all the green quests (because they're almost grey and therefore valueless) and swap zones once I was out of green quests. Typically I'd not run out of green quests until the mid 40s

The mage is supposed to reset his/her animation to the default Stand, or Stop position, but instead it's just doing an awkward pose. I like the old vanilla animation for Ice Block, and would like to see it restored to its former glory.
---
Just mocking some of the idiots on this subreddit. Any time you mention privet servers they come back with “privet servers aren’t accurate” like it invalidates anything that happened there.
---
It doesn't fucking matter, just enjoy the raid. The content is all easy regardless.
---
Pretty sure they'll leave that in, as removing it only opens things up to abuse.
---
Hi, /u/Akumapro
---
Yep. Almost every class got a rework in each .x patch. Some of those reworks took garbage tier specs to actually being playable. A warlock who played before patch 1.6 (BWL/Lock rework patch) who comes back to classic will be playing a very different class to what they had 15 years ago.
---
Hi, /u/OBSinFeZa
---
Lol is it possible the devs got troll racial backwards and made them receive less damage from beasts rather than do more dmg?
---
tbh, it's very easy to play classic and watch a stream at the same time, the pace is slow.
---
Not to mention asmondgold pulling rares in duskwood that have 10+ levels on him. Not to mention the 3 trash packs he pulled on top of it. Stitches hitting him for 200 damage when he's 27, vs a 34 elite...
---
Does it matter that the level 6 tigers are doing half the supposed damage? No not really.
---
It is important for Blizzard to look into? Oh abso-fucking-lutely! We have no idea if it's a harmless bug affecting only those tigers or if it is some underlying problem that might potentially affect many NPCs in the game world including world bosses or raids.
---
Praise our Lord and Savior
---
Preach did a great job except he still hasn’t equipped a god damn ranged weapon and continue to face pull badly rather than actually range pull
---
Idk if its even solely damage, though damage would probably be the most impactful element. But IDK, maybe resistences, mana regen, or melee accuracy being off, or maybe all 3. Or also, 0. When Blizz breathes a word about these figures, and says theyre 100% accurate, of course I'll believe them, they have a working, albeit buggy, reference client.
---
But its still a beta, the possibility that a core game mechanic needs a little bit of work over the next few months before release, isn't impossible. But i'm also aware that it's almost cognitive dissonance in a way. I remember earlier dungeons being much less... trivial? The mobs are green for much of the dungeon, but even in BC, you just couldn't pull like that, on rapid fire mass chain pulls without the healer OOMing. By BC, many people, myself included, played with more care for mechanics than this group did the whole run, and have more struggle still. There isnt MUCH to do that right in these old dungeons, its not like maximizing your dps rotation is very hard in Vanilla... at lvl 25...but the biggest, most impactful thing you could do, that that group never did, was utilize sheep, shackle, fears, target kill orders...
---
So I still think the possibility that \*something\* is impacting the game is there, whether or not it is damage. Im just waiting out for a blue post or some solid information. Ive played a private server, and i KNOW theyre harder, but disregarding that, even Classic/TBC era totally felt like it had more restriction on how consistently careless and ballsy you could be.
---
This was Blizzard's biggest argument for going with the 1.12 game version for Classic, so that "all the classes were redone at that moment" (ie: chosing say 1.8 meant some of the classes wouldn't have their revamp done). Biggest drawback (or side effect) of going with 1.12 meant that the game itself will have so many game features that didn't existed back when most of the vanilla players were leveling.
---
So the issue is related to the auto attack animation being enabled vs not being enabled. You can see the same thing when jumping and attacking vs jumping and not attacking. Watch their hips. I talked to Omar about it after BlizzCon demo and showed him and Brian in person in Irvine last week. They're at least aware of it at this point, but not sure if there's any sort of fix or whatever on the horizon
---
if you play on a notebook check if te right graphics controller is selected for wow classic. maybe it tries to start with the onboard chip instead of your nvidia card for example
---
At first I didn’t remember but then it all came flooding back
---
Foxhole. 
---
There's lots of socializing, communication, and teamwork. Going up to a random person and asking if you want to team up happens all the time.
---
That’s a bit misleading without more context though. The post mentions the mob in question is an outlier, for some reason other mobs seem to be doing the right amount of damage.
---
I really don't think it can be stated enough: ***DO NOT ROLL ON A SERVER WITH A BIG STREAMER. YOU WILL REGRET IT UNLESS YOU ARE IN THEIR INNER CIRCLE.***
---
play on a pserver.  1.12 is not optimized at all in certain areas.  gtx 1080 still gets brought to its knees in spots @ 1440p
---
lmfao noted
---
I really wish they did make the Emerald Dream. Maybe content after Naxx?
---
I don’t know what about what I said was misleading.
---
I never claimed all mobs were bugged.  I said it was happening in seemingly random situations.  
---
And then I provided the link for context.
---
But okay, I guess.
---
Nothing is worse than wowservers you shill

They have a working reference client, quit your bullshit

Why do we need a mega thread on Reddit we have all these awesome beta testers...

Interesting how the first half of the interview is really generic canned answers, until he remembered encountering the remnants of his first career steps - then it got much more genuine and interesting.

This really activates my almonds.

Just hop in your chest freezer and home and we will wake you up on August 26th.
---
nice find, report it ingame and post a comment into the megathread here
---
I see Sony guy on every classic stream.
---
I have tried talking to the various twitch streamers about this issue (among others) and they tell me I'm wrong or they have no idea how it should be so they won't report it.
---
I started basically on wrath(played on my brothers account in tbc), and boy I can't tell you how fucking hyped I am for classic. It's been so long since I've loved wow and I can't wait to return to the game feeling like an actual RPG with unique classes.
---
I would love to join your guild.
---
The only reason /focus was added by Blizzard is because there was no consensus for what to call it between all the addon developers using something focus-esque in Vanilla. They didn't add any API calls that other addons weren't already emulating. The goal was consensus so addons would more easily work together.
---
There will be an AceClassic library (maybe called something else) that adds /focus functionality to any addon that imports it and it will have the exact same API features as the current Blizzard /focus.
---
I've got a 1060 and never once had a performance impact on private servers. It's mostly CPU dependent anyway. Fortunately, most people that have "potatoes" likely have dual core i5s. Which means they will have a higher clock rate as they'll be pushing a clock rate over 4. And will likely run the game better than someone on a 2.8 clock quad core.
---
To be honest, I preferred 25 man raiding to 40 man. My guild was fairly organized back in the day and it was still a bitch to get 40 people together who were properly potted, buffed and ready to go when the raid was supposed to start. I'm positive we weren't the only ones that would start pulling trash and/or the first couple of bosses waiting for everyone to be ready. Thank God we had a great core
---
Dont even get me started on the nightmare that was/will be raid attrition. Lose your primary OT or a healer or 3 and now you have to get them caught up. I will say I lived in WoW up to early WotLK so I actually didn't mind the extra raiding. Can't say my guild felt the same way though, lol
---
Thanks  for the Post, hopefully i find somebody
---
STFU with ur bitching wodtard
---
No need to get defensive. I should’ve said potentially misleading in retrospect though, since this thread emphasizes all mob damage in general according to what Joanna is saying.
---
I’m looking for videos of the beautifull world.
---
r/classicwow - “tips is a tool and we hate streamer fanboys!”
---
Also r/classicwow  - “get Joana an invite, best classic streamer! /love Joana”
---
10/10 I remember drawing maps like these when I was a kid... wanted to make my own video game.
---
Not being defensive friend, just questioning your comment and gave my reasoning as to why I was questioning it. 
---
The title of the thread linked would imply all mob dmg, but reading the post would show otherwise.
---
Those would be run on separate threads anyway in the given scenario. So should be minimal impact.
---
&gt;You have one pair of green pants and you think you are a god.
---
But... Hogger's quest is the one that gives you your first green pants.
---
But my vanilla friends became my business partners and spouse. 
---
But no worries, time to make new ones!!!!!1!
---
Farming Tyr's Hand isn't half bad. Should be fairly easy as a druid. Good loot table and the mobs drop alot of cash and cloth.
---
1. WoW Classic servers are using the 1.12.2 game data.
---
2. There was no patch 1.13.
---
3. The WoW Classic client is running the 7.3.5 API.
---
4. Decursive is a fully-supported and popular addon today
---
Which part do you need to be schooled on?
---
Wha? How would the Leroy Jenkins video convince someone to play wow??
---
Whats vc
---
Yeah I agree on that, I appreciate you added the link to the post, but I figured most people would just upvote then carry on, so because of that I thought it was worth it to add just a bit more context :P
---
The programmer that was promised
---
Turns out vanilla is easy if you're not 10 years old :)
---
I think it worked all the way until they just opened the door permanently afaik.
---
And this is the reason why you bind your hearthstone to kargath. 
---
Only for one cockwomble to not be bound there and make the rest of the raid have to wait at the door of the instance because they are a tank or healer
---
I wanted to thank you for sharing this post because you just put all the things I've been feeling about the Classic release into words and it was an excellent read.  I'm so excited as well, maybe I will meet you in Azeroth come August!
---
And that's one of the issues.  They continue to focus on the end game while trying to get more players into it faster with the leveling revamp that just made it faster, or giving level boosts with a new expansion purchase.  It's not really acknowledging the issues with leveling, and it's ignoring what made WoW so popular in the first place.
---
Unless you got an email already. Look your WOW tab in the battle net launcher, above the play button you can chose what client to launch.

Hasn’t he only slept 2 hours in the last week?
---
Anything from the old Outland?  I visited it in a private server back in 2005 or so but I can never find anything about it anymore.
---
Thanks for this! Hope to run into genuinely excited and kind people like you come launch (: cheers.
---
I played on an RP server in Vanilla and it was actually a really great experience. We did a lot of world PvP even as a PvE server and we had a lot of guilds progressing pretty equally through end-game content. I have really high hopes it'll be like that in Classic too.
---
ACKCHYUALLY
---
guy has like 5k+ hours of wow played, he dedicates to the games he plays and no-lifes them on stream, just like tons of players will off stream.  
---
Also wtf, like every blue post we got was good news (except maybe progressive itemisation)
---
Touche Sir
---
I hope kiting is in too and I dont even play a hunter. I always thought it was cool to land in SW and chat was exploding, lol
---
So interestingly they enforced or maybe still enforce "real" names on RP servers. You cant be xxtaintxx. People dont talk in character in global channels like General. But you might see some in character style guild advertisements, * you pass by a pamphlet for this guild* type thing. RP flagging is almost entirely done through addons that list your full RP name, titles, backstory, moods, if you do adult rp or not, etc. Then people engage in /say or in whispers
---
If we had any influence on how well the game is doing, we wouldn't need classic in the first place.
---
With my Boston accent: Omaaaaah!
---
:D
---
Salt is inevitable
---
How fucking cool it would have been to have an entire continent of Ulduar that is larger than Kalimdor.
---
I can dispel some disappointment, during my time on Nost most people I met were adults, and everyone but one (of the ones that answered) in my raid guild said they would pay for retail vanilla servers.
---
WHERE I BELONG
---
Its gonna be a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people, but modern wow relies more on nostalgia  than classic ever will. Classic wow is the greatest game of all time and it was only live for 2 years. There is no doubt in my mind that classic will have a bigger playerbase than bfa.
---
I'm curious how many people are even going to do ALL of Sunken Temple and not skip the bottom part of it that existed.

Hogger isn't a being, it's a rank! Those Gnolls get promoted to Hogger if they survive long enough. The biggest and meanest Gnoll becomes the next Hogger. There must always be a Hogger... Without their master's command, the reckless gnolls become an greater threat to this world. Control must be maintained.
---
Oh no a guy was making a joke, because its his job to entertain his viewers, its a part of his persona.   
---
And if he wasn't joking, It doesn't matter, OH NO A GUY DOESN'T KNOW THAT 15 YEARS AGO STARTING GEAR DIDN'T HAVE ANY STATS AND WAS ONLY THERE FOR XMOG, CRUCIFY HIM, NO PLAYERS THAT DIDN'T PLAY PSERVERS AND DIDN'T DREAM ABOUT CLASSIC FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS  CAN PLAY BETA!!!!!!
---
I mean it's still a 15 year old game.  
---
  If we're going for toaster pc and if your pc can't run it now, 15 years later, you're way past the toaster spectrum.
---
i7 5930k @ 4.4
---
the game dips well into the 40s in several locations in each zone.  Its not optimized.  how you can blindly defend that is pretty fucking stupid.
---
Try to entice new players to come with the same levelling speed as vanilla and 120 levels to go, I don't know if anyone can do that properly even the blizzard that made vanilla
---
Well, there are still *some* hard encounters in MC, where 8 extra debuff slots could actually make a difference. Mostly Rag. But if you do start it with 8, you essentially have a pre-nerf and post-nerf version of Naxx in Classics lifetime. So youd have all this cock-waving and bragging about "oh, but you didnt clear it... *pre-nerf*".
---
Great work! One small thing, would it be possible to have the legend (references) shown all the time?
---
And you decided to whine about it. Seems paradoxical. Btw, I don't agree with  you. People are very passionate about classic and anxious to get it right. Most people seem to have fun with it. 95% enjoyment 5% critique seems fair to me. Critique helps improvement.
---
I remember using torturing poker with +5 damage enchant and doing 1,200 crits but it was probably TBC. Nice post
---
By the end of vanilla there were enough quests to not do an absurd amount of grinding.

There’s more but I want to listen to them so I’m a little distracted from listing them!
---
Same, why would I waste my time on a character that gets deleted soon? Wow is a longterm investment, it makes no sense to me to play a beta unless for the sake of bug testing (obviously the actual purpose of a beta).
---
i like the part where the one pixel did the thing to the other pixel
---
Ah yes the classic overreaction, I didn’t say he can’t play beta or anything negative about him, all I said is that his vanilla knowledge was lacking. Calm down friend
---
Calm down kiddo. I wasn't defending anything. I'm on an i5 disk core 3.8 and have never seen anything below 100fps on private servers. I'm thinking you've likely got other factors impacting your performance.
---
Figure out if you wana be a dps... ranged or melee, or a healer, to narrow it down. I wouldn't reccomend a tank. Also, contrary to other peoples view - re roll around level 10 if you don't like your original choice. Then when you find a playstyle you enjoy keep going. Watch class videos on YouTube too.
---
"No one ever tried before" 😂
---
Like his famous Oneshot macro, with all those spells everyone would have used anyways.
---
But we were not talking about a situation in a vacuum and even objectivity as a context in which it is defined.
---
Thats really the only way I would be happy/excited about new content, using old assets, and maybe actually revamping and finishing them, and making content out of those old maps. 
---
I just really... really hate the modern designs/layouts of raids. I know a lot of people *love* Legion and WoD and MoP. But they would really have to dial back the flashiness/zaniness that comes with alot of the modern games raids/fights. Its like comparing Tier 37 with Tier 2. One just has a timeless look that fits in well with the world, and one feels flashy and weird and very non fantasy.
---
For what it’s worth I haven’t seen a single person comment they got in with an account 2008 and on
---
60 ÷ 2 = 48 
---
Level 48 halfway there I've wanted this info for so long haha
---
Fixed the link
---
Haha right there with you. I wanted to be a level designer so bad. The John Staats interviews were fucking music to my ears.
---
Check out /r/wowservers I made an account recently on a BC server to satisfy the itch and I got all my info from there
---
this is so true
---
If there are no RP-PvP servers, the RPers that are interested in PvP will tend to be fairly evenly spread across all PvP realms. You'd be hard pressed to find a sizable RP guild unless you're lucky, or unless you reroll on the de-facto PvP server the community decided was for RP once the playerbase settles down a bit, weeks after launch. The point of the RP tag on servers is to tell the RPers where to go to find other RPers. Regardless of how many servers we end up with there should absolutely be at least one RP-PvP at launch.
---
Great work! Blizzard is known to read the subreddit so hopefully this gets their attention
---
was a mistake, forgot disengage didn't jump you back in vanilla it just dropped your threat levels
---
Agreed along with power curve, 40 man raids, no titanforge, no flying mount.
---
While he may or may not be correct, keep in mind the time span since we've played back then is just as long for us as it is for him. I don't trust the 'feeling' of anyone, even if it were a Blizzard dev. Evidence not hunches please.
---
Yeah absolutely an issue that would arise. 
---
Wouldn't be hard for blizz to just label a couple as rppvp, and that's not reason to be upset for anyone  but who knows what they will do.
---
Maybe a subreddit for rppvp will arise and they'll pick a main server, humans can be adaptable
---
Everyone will ruin barren's chat - it is the great equaliser.
---
Not every single person in a guild is going to want the mount.
---
But more importantly, the post these people were replying to said that BWL needs to be cleared AFTER banging the gong, which is wrong, and what they were correcting.
---
My water is fully nitrated.
---
Interesting. Good news for me, I guess
---
I must confess that i am not that optimistic although my situation is difficulter than yours because my son will be around 4 month when classic releases. I ‘d love to play wow. Has always ben dreaming about enjoying the journey for another time and immerse myself. But i think i will not enjoy it the way i want to. Best of luck !
---
Well if they haven't ever seen WoW before, raids or pvp will just be a bunch of numbers on the screen.
---
Leeroy shows planning, a cool dungeon, sexy dragons and man-dragons, group effort and shit going wrong.
---
Shut up stupid
---
hunters feign death + shadowmeld is perfect for little emergencies
---
It’s still probably canned responses, I suspect. I bet that PR briefing told them not to say anything negative on Classic, including “my code was bad back then because I was fresh out of college and still learning”. Ion was being cautious about criticising Classic too, especially since what the community did to J. Allen Barack (“you think you do, but you don’t”).
---
In any case, the internet can be rough and every gaming subreddit is full of angry, anonymous people who could turn very aggressive, very easily. So I understand why their interview answers won’t be 100% honest sometimes. 
---
With that in mind, I’m thrilled for Classic and super happy they made it happen. I hope the online dissing would be minimal or disregarded this time.
---
If you've played Warcraft 3 after WoW, you've likely noticed that the southern part of Kalimdor is never mentioned or shown at all. That makes a lot more sense if you take those old maps with a tiny Kalimdor into consideration. All the omitted parts simply didn't exist when the story was written.
---
Someone please tell me holidays and shit will still be a thing. Lmao.
---
Somebody post it
---
“Just using this to put on a show for their viewers”
---
Well, the viewers pay for the streamer salary and therefore determine what the streamer does. Don’t you do what your boss tells you at work? Viewers are a Streamer’s boss.
---
No ironforge? Good thing that didn't make it in
---
This is wholesome
---
Yeah my little one will 2 by the time it launches man. Luckily I've found a guild with raid times she'll already be in bed!
---
several of my friends children play their wow accounts now lol
---
quite a few of them either already had kids back then or soon after lol
---
Not quite but you better have that young girl rolling a char as soon as she can sit upright. Pokemon taught me to read 20 years ago and I have the fondest memories of it. Vanilla WoW helped my vocabulary at 10 with words like ‘corrupted’ and ‘epaulets’. So it might have some unseen benefits!
---
Herb/Mining nodes should not indicate if they are above or below your character.
---
This was the highlight of the night for sure!
---
Look at this pleb, Myself as a vanilla veteran (10 stars) am ashamed that they let ppl that didn't play vanilla in the game. A streamer doesn't know a totally useless fact about the game, or he does and hes just joking for the sake of his job, because its a part of his streamer persona to be a sperg, lets crucify him and all the other streamers. 
---
Everyone when talking about why vanilla was so great will say that it has a sense of community, but reading the comments,  vanilla elitists clearly don't want  any players in their game, just because they haven't played pserver/dreamt about vanilla for the past 10+ years. Some ppl like to go into a game w/o any knowlege, and ppl clearly are hungry for a mmorpg.
---
They're gonna be trivial no matter what, and 16 debuffs don't even matter that much in the beginning. By the time you have enough items to really make use of it (e.g. Nightfall, Thunderfury, Annihilator), you'd already be freefarming MC/Ony anyway. Of all the things that'll affect raid difficulty in tier 1, this is honestly one of the less important ones. Without those special items, the extra debuff slots mostly just let you put more dots on the boss which isn't something that affects difficulty that much.
---
Bliz: it cannot be done
---
Omar: A man got to have a code
---
Bliz: what code
---
Omar: Its all in the game yo.
---
Bliz: what are you going to do? Spend two weeks in your basement working passionately? 
---
Omar: Oh indeed.
---
Isn't it weird how these people whose income relies on liking and playing a game suddenly like this hugely popular version of game that's about to come out?
---
I met my kid's mom in Vanilla.
---
She stalked me during TBC.
---
We made our son right after the release of Wrath.
---
I quit during MoP to raise him alone.
---
He's 9, almost 10, now. He's going to be playing Classic with me in a couple months.
---
No regrets.
---
If "top streamers" can fuck up a Wailing Caverns run, I gurantee there will be a fuckton of people failing at MC/ Ony.
---
I would honestly just wait and experience Classic official for your first time playing so you can harness the excitement and energy for that. I would recommend watching MadSeasonShow on YouTube if you wanna research more into Race and Class picking as he has guides for all that.
---
I met my kid's mom in Vanilla.

OH MY GOD

This guy has a macro when he LANDS off of a fuckin' flight, like a gryphon, he says "Hello everyone, I am here." and then he greets everyone warmly.
---
on the beta you barely need to drink lmao
---
Relax homie its just a meme
---
I just re-read it that Joana was receiving greatly reduced damage compared to Tipsout. Was I mistaken?
---
Unfortunately I started in WoD. The closest I had to this moment was everyone in Khadgars room in Dalaran before you could talk to him to teleport the broken isles. BFA is so boring I played that on launch minute too, and I don't even remember what happned at all.
---
I mean if that got introduced in 8.1 then it's obviously not there because it's a legion client
---
No it was not. Joana is the original record holder for 1-60. In the real game.
---
Yup he deleted it because what he said was bannable by twitch
---
Oh Boy, right in the feels. I don't know if that were interviews with John Staats, but there is one scene that got stuck in my head and got me into game development:
---
When they talk about hidden away quests and show that one inside the bridge between the swampland and arathi Highland.
---
The best one.
---
IMHO automating group finding was the worst decision ever made. It killed all conversions on the game. We’re all nerds already, we need situations in MMORPGs that force us to talk to each other and make friends. 
---
I don’t want to just press a button and get teamed up with people I’ll never see again. I want to earn the status and reputation of being worthy of a group invite, by people I know, trust and like and do shit like this.
---
Really?
---
What a beautiful boy.
---
I feel thorn apart ... 
---
On one side I wanted people to feel cringe after reading my posts ... my hobby is writing fantasy stories (dark, epic, cringe ones also :P ) so getting such comments and down votes kinda proves that I did good job ... :P 
---
But on the other hand I never wanted to hurt anyone feelings so ... you can all rest peacefully ... I'm a normal guy :) 
---
Also I wrote that in first place I don't care if I end up on same server that any streamer ... from my perspective they can do their thing as long as they do it normally ... they can even benefit wPvP as they might create more events ... I just wanted to point out that if they go the wrong way, we have great way how to deal with the bad situation. 
---
An example of things going bad would be situation when streamer declares himself (or herself) as server "god" and force his (her) will to others ... however part of myself kinda wishes for such scenario ... I would love to show others that even such ... "god" ... can bleed ... 
---
&lt;yes, it was RPG talking ... :P &gt;
---
Warlock for sure! You can solo almost anything, if you die you have soulstone, your pet defends you while you are not around, you can fear dot and afk mobs, there is just so many benefits for us dads
---
Someone doesn’t understand what confirming a source means.
---
Think he was just saying it wouldn't be fun
---
God that’s frustrating
---
It is to be expected considering classic is based on an older Legion build, not the latest BFA build.
---
Exactly. Like why even say something about classic not being fun or good when you haven't played in 15 years. There's so many people like this then they try and have fun. Like no shit we told you.
---
Why do you feel the need to defend a huge chunk of people you don't know and don't care about you, and don't care that some people decide to not watch them? Someone said they don't like them on the internet. Holy fuck stop the presses.
---
They are opening themselves up to be judged by people, and people who enjoy their style watch them, people who don't say 'this guy sucks' and move on.
---
Also depends heavily on rested status.
---
The CM post came after stating something else.
---
I’m technically Jewish and I didn’t notice that either, thought it was Jesus too.
---
Yea he was an engineer that helped form the meta that exists in vanilla today
---
Just the one face lol
---
If you expect all the people who you'll meet with to behave nicely, you in for a bad time.
---
My advice is to go in as blind as possible and enjoy the discovery and gameplay. Also, find those who'll be fine with that playstyle, whether they are new to the game or veterans and ignore those who'd put you down.
---
If you want to, you can find guilds right now or wait until you start playing. Although quite a few (the majority now) will be for veterans, there will be plenty for a player like yourself.
---
I don't know if I would say a "solid amount" but i'm sure they will exist. That said, I think there will still be a huge amount less RPers on the PvP servers, even if they exist. On RP servers you can just stroll down to goldshire or the park (ally side) and find tons of random RP happening in the wild you can take part of if you want to. I don't think you will find stuff like that on a PvP server.
---
r/wooosh
---
I admire this guy. He has experienced several organizational changes at Blizzard, stuck around when subscriber numbers dwindled, not to mention recent lay-offs and still passionate about the game he has been working on for the last 15 years. Without guys like him sticking around, Blizzard would not be the company and game developer that I've come to love over the last two decades. 
---
Build the man a statue, give him a well deserved fat raise and continue to take great care of him. We need heroes like this!
---
This matches my experiences on pservers though. I'm currently levelling a shadow priest and have healed each instance with people barely ever dropping below 85%. Yesterday we lost our warrior so we 4man pet-tanked RFD without anything close to a wipe (I was highest level at 40). My spec is 0/0/30.
---
I agree that this is not a good atmosphere, but unfortunately is hardly limited to this subreddit. The cloak of anonymity sometimes reveals the worst in people. I don’t think there is an easy solution. This will also happen when the game goes live - people will criticize you for every small mistake or complain about your class choice. Most people don’t realize that making mistakes is a learning opportunity, and they could achieve so much with a small hint on how to improve rather than a big rant about how much you suck...
---
So put the work in to make it so it's not 120 levels and make leveling fun again.

Did Youtube JPEGify older videos to the point of unwatchable? I don't recall videos looking like utter shit back then.
---
Don't kink shame
---
As someone who's going to play a Paladin as well, seeing that there is a trainer in theramore feels great. Now I don't have to go all the way back to eastern kingdoms whilst leveling in tanaris. Big ty.
---
I'm still in doubt between undead and gnome for my warlock main. It depends mostly on where most of my friends will join, if horde or alliance.
---
Getting from 0-1 is the hardest
---
&gt;Ion was being cautious about criticising Classic too,
---
Ion didn't criticise classic though, he likes it.
---
There's so much choice in talent trees
---
I had a bit of a nerdgasm when I did that quest on a private server. I was like... holy shit, this exists?
---
Great defender tbh remember him playing
---
The average player in ANY GAME is trash. However, plenty of gamers from Vanilla were the exact opposite of trash. I was 32 when I started Vanilla, coming from other MMO's before that. I was a gamer since I was like 10. Vanilla was not hard for the average player, not because the average player was trash, but because the average player was new to gaming in general.
---
Vanilla was actually hard because mobs were actually hitting hard and dungeons were actually hard...for the average player. 
---
The problem with mob damage in Vanilla is NOT the damage they applied on the tank. That was never a problem. The problem was when tank lost aggro on a mob (and that happened A LOT in Vanilla) and hit a non-tank player. THAT mob damage was hard. This is what most people remeber...trash mobs hitting on a cloth healer or caster.
---
Asmongold runs are IRRELEVANT for this topic. ALl of those guys played on private servers, they are way above the average gamer in terms of skill and knowledge. They communicated using voice...not typing in chat. And they overleveled the dungeons.
---
One more thing, that adds to the irrelevance of Asmongold runs : SFK, BFD and WC are clearly NOT the Vanilla dungeons that offer an image on Vanilla dungeon difficulty.
---
Because vanilla was 15 years ago?
---
That rule only applies to cool things. Not trash
---
Join a guild.
---
always hate it when i run in to distract and save somebody's life and instead of running they think they can commit and just die along with you lol...
---
Have Blizzard confirmed it?
---
Ok now make one that doubles as a Simon says toy from the 80s
---
did the original post title link work for you?
---
Clothing items don't have durability attached to them.
---
Don't sub now for the beta.
---
I just watch streamers for now, and I'll sub when classic hits the road. No need to pay blizzard just for the chance to play a beta!
---
Same lol
---
Pic pls
---
Do you have proof of pets showing in default party frames in vanilla?
---
Proof that they did NOT show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZhazlsP2k
---
Easily hold top for a while.
---
I'm pretty sure they did think about that and came to the conclusion of today but then again we can't all snap our fingers and have everything be the way want.
---
Only boring people pick human
---
At least then you can move, arcane missiles isn't very much fun.
---
It's actually true.
---
One person, many accounts
---
Started in the WoW beta, the end of beta event was insanely fun. Wish they did more dynamic events even today.

---
Pretty funny that you call the original animation smooth and the new one "too fast leg movement" when very clearly the original animation is sliding over the floor like on ice and the new animation perfectly matches the foot movement with the actual speed.
---
That being said, I much prefer the original animation. That new animation looks unnatural, even if "physically correct" instead of sliding. You'd need to actually run for that speed, but that would look silly while stealthing. +1 for the old one as basically everywhere.
---
It wasnt bad when it was just the couple of same realms. IE same ones in BGs and could add them and trade etc. It was lost then yes but executed after with the everyone everywhere
---
Gnome war is underrated
---
Their main problem is getting kited and the racial helps
---
Also as cannon fodder front line it helpd much to have a small model tho pink hair will attract attention
---
I mean in something like AV or big middle WSG fight I much rather be smol
---
You are correct
---
https://youtu.be/HUPexEfCG7g?t=127 - no trails

Mythic raider btw, nice post history
---
If your PC in 2019 can't run a game from 2004, you don't deserve to play it.
---
I feel like I will end up with both a dorf priest and a gnome rogue
---
I'd love to see evidence that trails looked like that in vanilla.
---
Here is one that the red trail did not exist in vanilla: https://youtu.be/HUPexEfCG7g?t=127
---
The release date being so late, made everyone really angry.
---
Shoutout to the RIdPEF, lots of great memories there with everyone and lots of essplorations!
---
There's tons of non-streamers, it's just that many streamers were intentionally given an invite, supposedly to drum up hype
---
lol Nope! This is just how the guy recorded it.
---
...but it's accurate. i'm not sure what these screenshots are trying to show, though. 
---
first one: the druid has almost a full rage bar. that means they were essentially afk auto-attacking. that's why he's so low health, not because the mobs are hard. Maul is 15 rage, maybe more (or less) from the beta. he's also not using Demoralizing Roar.
---
second one: again, the druid is just afk auto-attacking. there's no reason he should have full energy in cat form.
---
third one: he died because he pulled multiple mobs. that sounds about right.
---
fourth one:  it's hard to tell what happened here, other then the voidwalker almost dying, but, based on his health, he pretty much started healing it right when it was gonna die. it looks about right to me.
---
I have ptsd but I actually consider this to be my favorite dungeon. I used to always get lost and just roam around and explore once my group finished the dungeon.
---
gotcha, my b, didnt realize that. thank you :)
---
&gt;Pretty funny that you call the original animation smooth and the new one "too fast leg movement" when very clearly the original animation is sliding over the floor like on ice and the new animation perfectly matches the foot movement with the actual speed.
---
i didn't make the video, though I tend to agree with the notes.
---
&gt;That being said, I much prefer the original animation.
---
i think it looks **much** more rogue-like. stealth shouldn't look fast!
---
This is what emerald dream realm was like until they ruined Wpvp in legion/warmode.
---
I could do with like a 5-10% increase in difficulty, but rather a faithful recreation.
---
Please don't base your bugs on "seems"...
---
Please show appropriate evidence from the beta vs vanilla. Joana has hundreds of hours of footage available as a reference for example.
---
There are quests for the bottom part so I'd imagine most people will want to do it.
---
This guy gets it
---
Tho its gonna be real sad if ur healer needs to click on u in the open
---
Implying u even have a healer
---
Im the exact opposite. These streamers will facilitate large scale community events (like the Soda vs. Asmon Gurubashi Arena fight two days ago, or the Kara Crypt Exploration event of Esfand and Asmond earlier).
---
It's been very interesting seeing the contrast, back in 2004 wow was considered the baby MMO, now people seem to think it's this crazy hardcore experience...truly a top 10 anime plot twist.
---
Should of played the comma trick and said you meant "Jesus, Omar memes are riskng in stock value
---
Thank you Omar Gonzalez. History might one day conclude that you played a keypart in ressurecting the MMORPG genre. When the industry realized that WoW Vanilla's game design had something the customers wanted, which the modern games didn't, it spurred the industry into a new golden age of MMORPGs.   
---
Thank you.
---
I am naive enough to think that they shouldn't be blatant stupidity to the brink of trolling
---
&gt; Does classic beta support DirectX 12?
---
Not as far as I can see:
---
    &gt; gxApi 
---
    CVar "gxApi" is "D3D11"
---
      default value "auto"
---
    graphics api
---
    &gt; gxApi D3D12
---
    unsupported api, must be one of 'D3D11'
---
That’s a weird way to spell troll
---
Shamans will be really popular, dont worry! Top 3 for horde. Repping here too
---
Underappreciated comment.
---
Training or kiting?
---
I think the OP is referring to training, just engaging something and pulling it way out of it's spawn area.
---
Kiting is keeping something slowed or otherwise getting away from it while dealing damage safely... But not necessarily moving the mob very far from where it spawns.
---
At least that's my understanding.
---
you got my back &lt;3
---
Proof?
---
I agree, but this is not footage from vanilla.

This is vanilla and just as sexy:

---
I want this post to be 100 days old :(
---
Accidentally ninja looting a chest and thus getting harassed and kicked from my group at 12 years old. Good times.
---
There was already a thread on Tigers doing half of their supposed damage, and I don't even have the fucking beta, so its not that easy to simulate for me.
---
Not going to sit through hours of twitch vods and old youtube videos to try to interperate if the damage values are correct, if I had the beta (which I am not getting because I am not subbing for BFA) I could simulate it.
---
And its Blizzard's job at the end of the day, and if they could bother with updating their confirmed and "not a bug list" we would avoid these situations. Its on them at the end of the day
---
Yeah, but don’t mention it. Because anytime you mention the health and  mama regen rates retards come out of the wood work saying 
---
“THaT’s BecAUsE prIVeT SerVErS AreN’t ACcUrATe!!”
---
Maybe some people don't feel the need to play completely "optimally"? There's no reason to force everyone to play optimally (giving them quest tracker) when everyone who cares about playing that way downloads the addon anyway.
---
Just don't bunch us all together. I find this sub pretty loving tbh, and not super toxic. Sorry if you feel otherwise. People will be awesome and cool in Vanilla, don't worry. Consider going on a RP realm though.
---
This case has been solved, Watson. Let's go home.
---
In the same boat as you, hardly motivated to play anything at all. If I were to recommend something though, it would be Civ 5. While it doesn’t satisfy my craving for Classic it atleast makes the hours go by at a decent pace.
---
Omar GOATzalez!
---
Funny thing is they could roll elemental and make sick videos with fairly ordinary gear.
---
So if someone is uninformed they don't deserve viewers?

Not defending Tips or anyone, but there are tons of streamers that are shit at games and people watch them for their personality.
---
Twitch is live, unlike youtube vids.  When you stream for 8 hours a day, you resort to stretch techniques to keep a conversation going.
---
Devil's advocate, maybe you just see it a certain way because you don't think they should make money from it.  I think you are wrong.
---
To push crit of the table you need 100% avoidance+block with shield block and i doubt he have that at this level
---
Let say you have 10% avoidance and 5% block at this level.
---
If you don't have shield block on :
---
10% to avoid 5% to block 85% to get a normal hit 5% to get crit
---
With shield block :
---
10% to avoid 80% to block 5% to get a normal hit 5% to get crit
---
Yeah i have read about it, people complaining about other people saying that.
---
Then don't report bugs based on what you remember.
---
This is not a bug....
---
Iceblock is a spell with a casting animation.  
---
Depending on what part of the batch you are in when you cast it determines what part of that animation you are frozen with.

You have to be such an actual spergy retard to be mad about this shit, get some self awareness you actual loser.
---
The 'Squire's Pants' item has armor (which I assume is part of the default character gear), so why not the boots?
---
A ret player smacking you with a SoC proc and a judgement isn't going to do as little damage as you think bruh
---
Damn how many people going to get reported for using a potion man....
---
1st: still shows mob damage
---
2nd: probably testing damage
---
3rd: is afk death, found to show actual numbers
---
4th: elites killed high armor with ease
---
40 man raids are a different beast for performance, especially cpu
---
Seem about right for me, some class can solo an elite without difficulty. Would be a different matter if the one soloing the elite was a warrior.
---
I'm not mad here oh and you called me a sperg Tell me how Old are you
---
Played on my moms coworkers account (we were staying with them at the time) and he started a human paladin. I remember how incredibly difficult questing in the wetlands was, I died so much. Eventually he refilled to a horde character because he had friends that played horde, can’t remember race but it was a warrior. One of his friends ran me through wc and I was just in awe at this level 56 with a mount. He was a god to me.
---
Yeah sure, I'll figure out the semantics asap.
---
&gt; less than 10 bow skill consistently hitting a mob that is 9 lvls higher for full damage.
---
yes which is why hunter is best solo class and can kill anything if kited long enough, Welcome to vanilla.
---
RIP reckadins
---
Or maybe Blizzard should get their thumb out of their ass and let people actually use the reference client so they actually beta test for real?
---
Strawpolls should honestly be ignored. They're so statistically flawed. The closest thing to the truth that you're likely to find is actual server statistics, even if they're from private servers. Shaman has always been one of the least played classes and I don't see much reason for that to change, especially since Classic launch is probably the worst time for the class (no pre-nerf WF, no sitting to proc Eye of the Storm, no easy spell power mail items from patch 1.10).
---
I'm actually hoping to never run into anyone from this sub once the game releases. I used to frequent r/fatpeoplehate and it was no where near as abusive as most of these people, I almost feel the need to shower after I come here.
---
My son will be around 11 months old. Cant wait to introduce him to gaming :)

Not really, since the rate at which you gain XP also goes up as you level.
---
Gnoll lives matter
---
This looks interesting for the upcoming classic start. I've thought about using Joanas guide but I guess that this time many more people will use his guides. This looks like a wonderfull alternative to split from other people. I guess we will have at least 3 types of player which use Joanas guide, then this or just randomly run arround and make there own route.
---
But I have 2 questions:
---
\- Am I supposed to grind the mobs on my way through the next quest? In Joanas guide he recommend to kill every reachable mob on the way.
---
\- How long (/played) would it take (approximately) to go from 1-60 with this guide?
---
You miiight be remembering it that way cos there's some non-elite mobs in there.  I'm not sure on the ghosts but I'm pretty sure there's quite a few wolves that aren't elite
---
i hope i don't have to wait too long to relive AV
---
It's not real fast but it's not too bad. Level as enhancement and wear some spirit gear, you'll be able to grind non-stop and level as fast as any other class that grinds one mob at a time. Shamans also get ghost wolf at 20 which is a pretty big deal in terms of overall leveling speed since a significant part of leveling is in the time to get from A to B.
---
Because you said "discrepancy in mob damage between vanilla and classic beta" and not tigers in durotar, you are the one cherry picking.
---
All mobs are not doing 200% difference...
---
&gt;classicwow 
---
&gt;Let's nitpick that something from a very recent version of the software isn't present in the classic client
---
Also what's 2019 to do with any of it
---
Nice. I had an old account aswell, but during tbc I basically shared it with another person, and gradually lost it and I dont think I have any way of contacting him anymore. Do you think its possible to get this account back?
---
I think it's because every class has things that they can/do excel at but not everyone is interested in what a particular class may excel at so to them it may be shit but to another it'll be great.
---
Funny how that was the way it was taken looking at the downvotes, but no. Not at all.
---
That was a lot of time wasted that could have been spent on better things, but I got some good friends out of it in the end, so it was worth it.
---
That doesnt matter. You can have 200 players on screen and the FPS will still be good in this client.
---
&gt; People have lost their minds.
---
If you gifted yourself a six month sub during the blizzard sale through paypal, it was less than $10 per month.  You can earn that in an hour working for minimum wage in a lot of places.  An hour of work each month to have a chance to play the beta, and if you don't get in, you can still mess around in retail for fun while you wait for classic.  You think you'd have to lose your mind to think that's an ok deal?
---
&gt;Meanwhile blizz is laughing all the way to the bank.

"Company sells product, earns money."

---
Nice pet control xD
---
The modern macro system allows for crazy fast shifts in and out of form with a potion in between. Saw it on stormx's stream. It is fast enough to do between a boss weapon swing
---
Here is a sequence where the warrior changes stance a few times:
---
https://youtu.be/cJVYvcCEbmA?t=298
---
It seems that the stance change invoke a 0.5s CD on other stances not your other spells.
---
Depending on the streamers I think they'd probably beat out asmon realistically speaking. Like staysafe if asmon doesn't join them, or soda. Or if there are any actual good try hard guilds
---
His initials aren’t OG for nothing
---
because the game was better and not every class was the same bullshit mashed together with different names.
---
I'll be sure to do it again this time around too
---
nice bop dude! was so fun to watch.
---
Always nice to see a successful single dad story
---
A fucked up part of me would fucking LOVE to see karma happen to asmon for all the ninja shit he does / did do. In terms of a top tier private guild being on the server and yoinking the gong hit before he is able to get it. Especially if it's during a stream
---
It's not, it's crit that are based on the defense of the victim.
---
Damn why isn’t everyone fading away?
---
You know that if you have a sub you actually can play their game right?
---
Started with hunters kiting dragons while dps killed the rest, then we figured it was easier to just kill everything.
---
streaming has little to do with being a good player, much more with social entertainment skills.  many streamers are quite mediocre gamers
---
How though? There's a limited number of things you can give out that can get fragments. I guess if you have tons of people waiting for someone to tag, and then helping kill. But you would also be dealing with trolls on both factions at the same time
---
Rofl that was a great insult though
---
Exactly my point. There are no “world firsts” in classic. They were all done 13+ years ago. So trying to do everything first and as fast a possible is pointless because it’s a meaningless achievement.
---
It also doesnt have any of the other features from legion like LFR!
---
Also the sprint animation was originally just normal running but sped up to ridiculous levels with the newer one having a much larger gait. Cant remember what patch it was introduced but I wonder what’s in Classic?
---
Whatever dude. Don't get your knickers all wound up over other people having their own thoughts on stuff.
---
None, to be honest with you.
---
I only got to play on a cousins account during vanilla for a very short period of time. (I’m talking like, level 40-45 ish, if that) 
---
About two weeks after PC launched is when I was able to pickup the game and play myself at home, at the end of BC, I had 2 of each class (minimum) at max level, and in some cases double if they were something I enjoyed at the time (Priest, Druid, Mage)
---
I have always enjoyed more of a support or healing role to help party’s out, instead of being the dps, or “leading” the dungeon as a tank, so usually hybrids / healers are my most kept up... or were anyway. I haven’t played “Seriously” for a few years now.
---
But sadly I didn’t get to experience vanilla all that much, BC was “close” I suppose, and being my “favorite” expansion, I’m hoping Vanilla is the next best thing (or even better)
---
I don‘t. I never liked that dungeon. But I will run it ofc for loot
---
Yeah. Wow1 etc are accounts made in ~2010 or later
---
I think you will still see the "oh, but you didnt clear it... pre-nerf". All of the encounters including Naxx content will be post-nerfed so I think it will still be the bitter feeling of defeating content that is well passed its prime. And to try and hype up classic as once having been hard people will say "oh, but you didnt... "  to try and justify to newer people why its being so easy. We are already seeing this with the beta, people saying mobs are doing too little damage etc. to try and justify why people arent dying.
---
To be fair I think its justified. :P Classes are so much more efficient and bosses have been nerfed so its just not the same dynamic to what classic was when it first was released.
---
They've been friends for years, I'm pretty sure how you're seen in a game is not a reason to break a friendship over lol.  
---
Esfand surely knows better than you if he likes how Asmon is or not..
---
they could, but it doesn't affect 99% of their classic playerbase (this includes casual raiders) only the 1% hardcore players care about it being too easy. they rather spend development time on stuff that affects all players
---
The current classic patch is 1.13 it's running the 8.x client as a foundation with its associated API. Decursive does not work in BfA since addons can't cast spells for you.
---
How you can know so little about these things amazes me.
---
&gt; Did he really think he could switch other gear aswell? 
---
you've been having that wavy red line pop up every time you write "aswell" without figuring out it's not a word, and you're surprised he doesn't remember a mechanic from 14 years ago?
---
How much of a fanboy do you have to be to think that Multithreading is Nitpicking, totally deluded.
---
Learn to have some common sense, as I in no way meant I was bigger than him.
---
And I could tell you how much better off I am for that very reason, but that would be stopping to such a level.
---
And mine has made me a lot of real life friends who’ve stuck around. :)
---
testing and advertising are not mutually exclusive — both functions can be achieved in parallel (even if not always by the same persons)
---
Yeah Swifty is senile, just as he was. I’d go as far as crediting him with showcasing a lot of stuff, but he in no way ‘invented’ it, people were salty even back then. He also swore to fury as a pvp spec, didn’t age well.
---
Um actually I was 13
---
If so, that's be good to hear
---
you got a clip?
---
Earlier version did have a constantly visible legend, but user feedback indicates that people get the gist very quickly and only need a refresher every now and then. I figured that having a keybind to open and close the legend (Q &amp; Esc) does this decently well.
---
Mate Joana was famous for his speed leveling guide. I searched for ages during Vanilla for a copy of it (it cost money) and made a troll hunter purely to try it out back in the day.
---
Maybe its because of the engine and can't be changed?
---
That said, ive never liked the "skating" animation. It looks even more silly when sprinting in stealth.
---
Try the PvP server.

That Makura also looks like it hits for nothing, if my memory serves those hit like trucks but it's been 15 years so that might not be reliable.

PoV of Jesse Cox lvl 6 shaman vs Makura lvl 6 same damage numbers 2-4 per swing

---
I got beta invites for tbc and wrath by doing this, contacted them through some sort of press/publicists email. No idea if they still do it like that, but worth a shot.
---
Okay calling me a fanboy and deluded is your only argument. No point in talking to you.
---
Sure, but that's only still one half of the social aspect when it comes to MMOs. I had friends in my guild, but I also knew people from other guilds that I met by grouping up with people for dungeons or other content. I made friends with random people in Orgrimmar because I would just see them stand at their spot every day. These days even if I interact there is a chance I'll likely not even see them again unless I go through a bunch of menus and party up. Just stumbling across the same people is rare now, it makes the world feel empty.
---
So yeah, you can still join a guild and have social interactions within the game, but you'd still be missing out on the other ways to interact that we've lost over the years to automated group finders and sharding. Some of the best friends I made in WoW are through world interactions rather than guilds.
---
Questhelper rocks, don’t tell people how to play the game goober.
---
Esfand literally dropped Asmond for like 4 hours today after a big argument. They're not real "friends", they're streamer buddies. 
---
This would not be anywhere close to the first time weve seen streamer "friends" part ways.
---
In fact, I dont think Esfand has partied with Asmond since the Kara run. 
---
Not saying that this is "the end", but they clearly have personality differences.
---
Wtf this retard isn’t meal prepping for a month in advance and Saving server downtime as a window to meal prep more?
---
that seems really weird to me I don't quite know what's going on but that mage has half or even three quarters of his gear entirely broken and he's getting hit the same damage for that warrior with full mail on
---
They mean people criticizing their favorite streamer.
---
This. It gives the individual player something to aspire to.
---
Getting Felstriker was a insane moment. The intense feeling of see it dropping and getting it... man, i was so hyped, ganz describe :D
---
your auction of rabbit's foot has expired
---
I love how some nerd keeps downvoting every comment that mentions Monkeynews, Tipsout fiending reddit today
---
Not that you're not wrong, but most of the relevant content is now pretty much non-automated again. You can't queue for raids per the LFR (LFR is retard mode that gives gear worse than daily quest gear) and you have to physically move to the dungeon entrance and apply to groups. The only difference is, that the /2 or /LFG spam is now in a UI where you can just apply to the groups. The higher the dungeon difficulty the more people talk to each other, which is why a lot of people (me included) have made tons of friends ingame since the mythic+ system got implemented with Legion.
---
No incentives required for world PvP, it's just done for the fun of it. Classic is the real BfA.
---
My guild is lot of old faces I haven't talked to in 15 years that I got server firsts with back in the day and I can not wait to play with them again. Even if a fraction of them even hit 60 it's going to be a blast
---
When hasn't it been shit?
---
PvP servers are so toxic and full of edgy kids. 99% of encounters are literally a  tier 3 geared level 60 corpse camping you. I'm 45 years old I don't have time for it, that's why I play PvE  😎
---
I don't know that counts for me if you ask me. Vanilla wasn't just about level 60, in fact this whole conversation about vanilla being a different game is almost all about how much of the game was below level 60
---
Streamer use to have very high end setup.
---
Thought it was RDJ for a moment
---
unless it got thanos'd, i think i still have at least one of the quest dealies on live. probably got thanos'd though
---
&gt;The damage is WAY, WAY too low for elite mobs
---
It's not. These numbers have been compared with old videos and apart from the one level 6 tiger that seems to have issues, all numbers from the dungeons are correct. Either you're remembering values from way before 1.12, or you have some rose colored hardcore classes. It's just how it is.
---
Im on it. Theres like 10 ppl per zone
---
tfw we might actually get kobold lair after classic is done
---
NPCs don't do Glancing blows. Hunters can't block, and if it's not a crit/crush, then it's just a regular hit.
---
I kinda think some people will start bitching about spawn rates / crowded servers / not being able to get any tags honestly
---
No it's not, please stop with this nonsense. The game is two years old and has minimum system specs to match, check bfa.
---
Should probably put in the OP that damage was fine at  
---

---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/426133361?t=01h42m06s
---
Hi, /u/Kitterino
---
Maybe it's due to asmongold doing it over leveled where as people in vanilla generally did it as soon as they could.
---
Not sure you can use TBC videos for world  zones, as a lot of them recieved reworks in TBC, where a lot of the elites were turned into normal mobs, and some more quests were added etc.
---
Iirc he always did it at a certain hp value, so while he might still do it some runs, he should do it all runs no? Not that i saw a run where he didn’t, but if it did happen then it should be a bug
---
Itemization and gear are minor nerfs compared to updated talents and actual nerfs to the fights.  In sum all the changes does trivialize the content, but some guilds will still struggle. I do wish that they would tune the encounters though, to keep the vanilla feeling more true.
---
Until AQ theres little reason for horde to be bound in Org. UBRS/MC/BWL/ZG/Naxx on one side. AQ/Ony/World Bosses on the other.
---
I'm playing the beta right now, can you tell me where to go to see these performance drops? Or did you mean only pservers suck?
---
Yeah, that's what I am hoping for, lol
---
Yeah, I know... but vanilla footage is shockingly rare. More than happy to trim the list down to only &lt;=2006 if need be.
---
He means DM. Apparently alliance calls it VC because diremaul is also DM. Nevermind that they are 50 lvls apart
---
ive literally done nothing with my life since vanilla lol
---
They haven't, but it's cool to shit on Blizzard.
---
Doing something as fast as possible is an achievement, and a popular thing though. Though I mean in the case of how quickly you can race through the raid compared to other current guilds, and that type of thing instead of going for "first"
---
Realm: Omar;  Population: Full ...and probably gonna be hidden after 20 minutes.
---
When he was doing Verog I checked the unedited videoes and they did the correct damage. Raptors too
---
This actually might be the reason. Generally people used to do instances at the lowest possible level to get gear to help you level faster.
---
Nice diagram!! Thanks!
---
No, the original comment was about upgrading the old client instead of altering the new client.
---
--- 
---
Anyway.
---
You do not need to explain this principle to me, I am fully aware of the dangers of old code. I would have to be an absolute retard not to.
---
No seriously, that's not hyperbole. I would have to be an actual retard to not get that. You literally just went ahead with the premise that this SE was so fucking dumb he doesn't get something so fundamentally basic and repeated in articles pretty much every week.
---
Really dude, do you get how absolutely messed up your posts are? The level of arrogance you're displaying here... it's beyond words.

Grow up, my dude.

Wow exploration videos. I think [Dopefish](https://youtu.be/UWMz7-7SGlo) is the best one tho.
---
Haha all those sad streams think there almost there when they hit 30.
---
Not necessarily, you need to drink a bit depending on how you're playing
---
Thanks for testing this. I tried to ask a few streamers about this but none of them were sure.
---
Absolutely yes
---
If you can play live you should definitely be able to play beta, what graphics settings on live?
---
This could very well be.
---
But it's also that people during vanilla were shit. It sounds like an easy to say all-beating argument, but it's really the case for many players. Over the years people have learned what could be dangerous and how defensive abilities are necessary. Especially healers tend to get a way better grasp of situations with some training, as it's hard to judge monster damage without experience.
---
Many people have argued that classic might be kinda easy for people having played retail (even if retail leveling was dumbed down) for 15 years or private servers with apparently higher damage values and it just might be the case.
---
All that being said, just from my personal experience I'd assume that later dungeons will pose a more serious threat, even to experienced players, but this could also just be my memory.
---
Hi, /u/Impishdecay

As for tuning, I guess we won't know if they are tuned correctly or not other than blizzards word. I hope they over tune early content to compensate for the knowledge of players.
---
Yeah I guess you could say I’m a grown up. I’m married, have a house, pay taxes, run my own business and still chose to use the word “AIDS” to describe things that are daunting.
---
Not everyone here is “toxic”. Don’t lump me into that group. 
---
You don’t know me!
---
Yeah, at launch of classic there'll be groups of tier 3 geared 60s camping you.
---
Aye the entitlement has gone to the heads of many said to say.
---
I didn't say you were crit immune with shield block up.
---
The game starts at 60 btw
---
The miners are none elites that die easily. I basically used them for rage generation

[There was no patch 1.13](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x).

[Wow Classic is using 1.12](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic).
---
[The client is a fork of 7.3.5](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=763). It's definitely not 8.0 because we know there's no multi-threading.

[Decursive is still a popular addon today](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/decursive). You're talking about one feature of an earlier version that was disabled.

So everything I've said is true and you're an idiot.
---
ok, thats cool
---
&gt;  It took a lot of time to get to level 34 in the original game. Like weeks to months
---
what? it took 10 days /played to hit 60 even if you dicked around all the time. Someone who only played to level 34 hardly played during Vanilla. Not to the extend where they'd have a proper memory of what it was like 15 years ago.
---
Really interesting comparing this to Runescape

---
That isn't time invested but you're only halfway to 99 at 92. So classic is pretty basic compared to it
---
That baby is we. The second of a thousand generation long line of ret pallys. For as father lay his hands on ours. We shall lay our hands on yours.
---
Stealth and Sprint animations are very different based on movement speed.
---
I played a human rogue and high level sprint animation looks nothing like low level sprint. When you get the last rank of sprint the animation changes to a more slow-looking flying-like walk where your character leans more forwards and cruises through everything super smoothly.
---
A good starting point would be to compare same ranks of the spell in the old and new client. Comparing level 60 with low level makes no sense. The max level rogue in your video probably has the Sprint ability maxed out and Stealth too.

alliance always outnumbering horde just like in 2004
---
Yeah, been hearing that often - a few people told me that Mythic+ is the only communicative gameplay these days. I tried the Mythic+ system, and did not like it, for a few reasons:
---
1. The only real reward is same gear with higher ilevel (and thus higher stats). Gear goes old fast. What's best in slot today, becomes vendor fodder in a couple of months, when the next patch comes out. It's less appealing for me.
---
2. It's timed so you can't talk to people. No time for that. No need to talk either, there's no strategizing like we had in vanilla: "rogue go sap moon, mage please sheep star" etc. Again, it feels like a mechanism that discourages communication.
---
3. Recruitment for Mythic+ is cross-server, and thus is often filtered based on ilevel, or achievement or raider.io - it's all the same, alternatives to personal familiarity. Before cross-servers were a thing, servers felt like that bar in the show Cheers - everybody knew your name. People weren't to be grouped with and forget  second after. You'd bump into them again in dungeons, on trade chat or the auction house.

dude, I had 10mbit university internet back in 1997.   (this was exceptional at that point, but by 2005 loads more people and institutions had proper broadband internet.  not everybody lives in Hillbilly Gulch, USA
---
What's interesting about these planning stages and only hinted at here is that they had planned for some raid instances to be for levelling. So, say, Molten Core would be the 60-65 levelling raid.

tell you what, I'll call up my uncle John Blizzard and make sure this happens

Honestly this is really important. I spent my life maxing viewing distance until I installed mirrowind with a buttload of mods for the 10ty time and saw pretty much the whole world. Made it feel small. Lowered the distance and everything got sooooo much better. Since then, I don't max it on wow either.

---
Are the 2 mutual exclusive?
---
I'm sure those will exist too, but you might want to choose one of the lower pop realms then!
---
i joined one yesterday and it was just swarming with hundreds of players in the starting zone, making questing so hard and shitty i gave up at lvl 5.
---
it was fucking awful.
---
[It's still the best WoW video of all time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfr3602ANI)
---
This of course ignores that you get more exp per mob kill and more exp from quests at higher levels.
---
I'm imagening they'd split layer 3 into two at that point, so suddenly you see half the amount of people you usually do.
---
Fuck layering.
---
It was worth £10 a month back then, and it's still worth that to me. As a bonus I also get this other game with it, but I'm probably not going to play that. 
---
As for 'buy the game', I already did. I don't need BfA to play Classic, unless I've misunderstood.
---
Hearth to kargath!
---
Could you give us some information in your methodology?
---
From what I've understood. MC and maybe BWL to some degree could be possible but there just isn't any tanking druid gear to be had past lvl 60 blues. Also threat generation is a problem so to be able to tank MC and BWL you're gonna have to put in a lot of extra work and farm Manual Crowd Pummelers from Gnomeregan for the 3 charge attack speed use effect.
---
Not entirely sure about that statement, with Ion using the word "teaching" I feel it's more likely that he developed a machine learning network interpreting the old data, something that Ion points out that they had. Of course working on the game for that long is a great thing and him coming up with this way pretty much makes him this community's Jesus. But other than that this feels like kind of a bold statement from you.
---
Aye there’s a reason the lfg in vanilla never took off. Wasn’t till wrath it really started being a thing. Unpopular opinion, but as much as I enjoyed myself in tbc and wrath, I hope we don’t go there. Rather go the original route with emerald dream etc and keep a design philosophy that maintains what vanilla is. I know a lot of ppl who didn’t join till tbc+ don’t follow me on that, but as good as those expansions still were, they present to many problems like splitting the community and adding elements that destroy the core of the mmo rpg.
---
Thanks, with the slightest of tweaks I can use the list for my shadow priest.
---
Which obviously isn't allowed!
---
Nah they won't lol. People aren't that much better if at all.
---
I posted about this before, I used to get worldoflogs top 100s on my rogue in tbc, I quit and came back in cata and again was getting top 100 worldoflogs scores even though my guild sucked. 
---
People have not gotten that much better, wow is too easy to have a high skill cap. People probably got a lot better at pvp, but not pve. 
---
I think the reason the dungeons are looking easy when asomodan is doing them is the level he is doing them at. People didn't go into an instance 3-4 levels above the mobs, they went in as soon as it was possible to do it, which would generally be 2-3 levels below the mobs.
---
If you only do instances when you over lvl them they will be easy, but not many people did that as you wanted the gear asap.
---
My guild is allowing me to play HotW spec. So I'll be off tank when it's needed and healing the rest. It also makes finding groups in 5 man super easy because how flexible the build is.
---
That paladin is lvl 32!
---
&gt;I made friends with random people in Orgrimmar because I would just see them stand at their spot every day.
---
Yup. Regular interaction is a strong factor. 
---
We can see that in RL interactions too: we make friends with people we work with or classmates, but not with strangers on the bus, or at the supermarket; because we don't bump into them regularly.
---
 It takes time and mental investment to get to know others, and people are naturally less willing to do it if you're unlikely to meet again.
---
Even guilded players aren't encouraged to play with their guild mates. There are easier alternatives for casuals these days.
---
Hi, /u/Tenoke
---
If you prefer PvE servers then that's your thing but don't act like you're superior for being a bitch.
---
If you played Legion with that FPS, you should be fine out in the open world and in dungeons. Raids and BGs might be a different story or might not be.
---
If a layer is only 2k (can you give me the source?) I'm really upset. 2k players worldwide is nothing.
---
I'm used to norrthdale at this point with minimum 6k online and 10k players. That is an mmo.

---
This post is retarded.  In today's gaming world, video game betas are for one thing and one thing only, advertising.  He got into the beta test because he gets a fuck ton of viewers and thus more people looking at the game
---
I'm able to make an EU trial account on my Battle.net. so you might be able to use the same account you have for EU just add a NA classic account.
---
So I agree he should have compared same ranks, but ultimately the rank and Camouflage have nothing to do with the discrepancy here.
---
In the old version of stealth, the animation *never* changed speed from rank to rank. Your character moved its' feet at the exact same rate, but you covered more distance per step. When you sprint, your feet *still move at the same rate*. 
---
Take a look in both videos -- when sprint is active, the animation is exactly the same. Therefore, rank and Camouflage are not the cause of this issue. Blizzard has intentionally changed the animation at some point (past 1.12.1), and to stay true to Classic it should be reverted.
---
I am the same as you, I toyed with the idea of playing on a Pvp realm but you’ve just summed it up for me in a nutshell, thanks!
---
Here are the requirements for retail WoW:
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/76459
---
The requirements for classic will be broadly similar but it will require much less disk space (the beta is only 9GB). 
---
I think you’ll be fine.
---
There are still people out there who joined a guild and don't have to skip the "guild exploration" aspect.
---
You can still look for other guilds after launch, even when you joined another one already.
---
&gt; Of course this doesnt take into account increased xp values and quests etc.
---
why is no one doing this anyways?
---
Turns out when you show people how misserable things are, like Missing a lot, no mount for the majority of stv, that cave on teldrassil as a hunter, .... they appreciate the stuff you give them so much more. It makes the little things so rewarding. You see that pattern all around classic if you look for it.
---
I don't even realize what the bug is supposed to be after watching this.
---
This was the golden age of youtube
---
Lol these are epic, Blizzard should hire you!

Tales of the Past IV
---
Blazer! Love that shit but I’m not talented enough to make that
---
Just tried this out to lvl 10 and wow it's so damn useful. After my first attempt on the beta on my own this just cut my lvl time in half.
---
One wipe charlie!
---
People who hate Vanilla get beta, meanwhile Joana basically had to beg to get one.
---
I know a good player , he played just like me vanilla in 2004, Both left out on the beta, and of course this kind of streamers gets Beta invites. It's just wrong. And no i dont hate streamers.
---
That's true, but it would still be a shame if new players interested in classic come here to check out some discussion and get turned off and lose interest by this community.
---
the fuck is an instant pot?
---
Whelp there goes that idea
---
In Wotlk I ended up using some of the leather rogue gear for my tank set. Is that not possible/plausible in classic? Not enough Stam on rogue items?
---

i wish omar would see these memes about him

People were banned for this in vanilla

Agree! Strong, simple and entertaining class. Which you can actually see in an new upload from this guy [https://youtu.be/ibji5JrmGIQ](https://youtu.be/ibji5JrmGIQ)

This is nothing compared to what is to come. This isn't new to WoW. Welcome to the internet, son.

Good job my man ! ... you are a hero !

---
Druid can tank everything, including naxx. Check out Skarm Tank on YouTube. 
---
This is what he says about druid as raid tank:
---
- Very good threat if you use a pummeler stack on pull.
---
- Good blue tank gear, so excellent for dungeons and  MC.
---
- There is a lack of mitigation gear for druid tank in the earlier tiers, while warrior tier 1 and 2 is great for tanking. The result is that druid simply struggle a little in late BWL and early AQ40. 
---
- R13 PvP gear is on par with or better than AQ40 gear for tanking, so you can technically start filling gaps of gear in MC/BWL by ranking.
---
- There is great druid tanking gear in AQ40, but it's almost to late as you need a couple of these pieces to clear it.
---
- Once geared in R13/AQ40 gear druid threat and mitigation is excellent for naxx progression and there are more upgrades to be had from naxx. 
---
-Druid can not make it's taunt unresistable, hence not useful on 4 horsemen in naxx.
---
LOL ... I had exactly the same idea :)
---
This,Spot on.
---
that's not BS at all rogues had a shit time with multiple mobs when leveling until later levels.
---
Guild bank was in vanilla. As far as I remember, and I could be wrong, it was like a bank with multiple tabs you could assign different guild rolls ability to access
---
Haha, well. I have a feeling he was more just trying to bullshit me into playing a DPS class because he's worried I'll find healing boring because he's mostly played with me as DPS. 
---
But I've healed for a while before.
---
My daughter will be 2,5 y.o.

---
Not guides
---
Has front shredding/ front stabbing been 100% tested and proved to not be working in the beta? 
---
I know one of the devs said it wouldn't work but has anyone got video of it?
---
How long does it take for warlock infernals to despawn?
---
Guild bank would be a good change imo
---
No, they are trash in vanilla.
---
Are the tigers only doing lower damage to hunters? could anybody else test this with a hunter?
---
Theory: They either normalised the damage done by these creatures to hunters in order to let them tame these easier for the lvl 10 quest, or they normalised beast damage for hunters before taming (to have correct numbers for pets after taming).
---
Just a theory though
---
If you haven't played vanilla or on private servers you won't understand. You're not used to seeing the same people leveling beside you for a month, it segments you in the world and you feel at home. You get to know these people and it's great. Then, you read the news about the layer merger. Now there's literally 2 thousand new players on your faction and they will drown out your friends.
---
Theyre not a good memory you think about when you read a name, they're just a random.
---
Yes you can start playing with him too, but you suddenly lose alot of what you've gained
---
It might have something to do with their personalities.
---
over 500,000 iterations done
---
Crap I hope I get one next week. I don´t have a sub I just buy gametime and now its still active. Thank you OP.
---
They just got 5-6 people to help them with the grinding. Throw enough bodies at high level mobs and they'll still die.
---
I agree that the gear becomes boring, that's one of the big negative points I have with the game. I absolutely despise titanforging and random sockets and random tertiary stats. I can completely understand that.
---
&gt; It's timed, so you can't stop to talk to people. No time for that. No need to talk either, there's no strategizing like we had in vanilla: "rogue - go sap moon, mage - please sheep star" etc. Again, it feels like a mechanism that discourages communication.
---
It actually encourages communication, if you play the more difficult keys (higher than +12 I'd say) but not in the traditional sense of writing in chat but joining voice comms like discord to talk with the group mates. Sadly, just as it always be, the majority of people prefer not to use voice comms. Ironically, there is a weird limbo where the +5 to +9 keys are ridiculously toxic compared to +2 to +4 keys and +10 keys, while the +11 and +12 keys are toxic again. Most of the keys at +13 or higher are rather chill when the key gets depleted. There are even M+ communities ingame and on several discords, with which you can group up with.
---
I can understand not liking being on a timer, I didn't like it at first myself either and it took me some weeks to understand that the timers aren't that tight (at least the one to clear the dungeon in time) if you get used to the dungeon and have a group with a half functioning brain.
---
&gt; everybody knew your name. People weren't to be grouped with and forget 1 second after. You'd bump into them again in dungeons, on trade chat or the auction house.
---
Again, that depends on the difficulty of the content you are doing. I've met several people in different M+ runs in Legion a few days apart and only then added them to the Bnet list because of the fact and because it was fun playing with them. Of course it is not the same but it's not like the times after the RDF tool got implemented and before the M+ system became a thing, where the chances of meeting someone in a dungeon on the next day were barely non-existent.
---
Watcher (Ion) mentioned in interviews regarding Classic that they will probably take lessens they learn from recreating Vanilla with Classic to the Retail version. I hope they can take the best of both worlds and make it a better game than it currently is, because if Legion would've had some of Classics/TBCs aspects while retaining the best of its features it would have probably been the best expac of all time.
---
I was in my 30’s for vanilla and you teens were toxic assholes to us older players. And you made fun of us all the time, confusing kindness for weakness. Have fun dealing with the new teens as you grow some more.  ;)
---
And that’s a weird way to spell dwarf
---
you are kidding yourself if you think its a "good deal" to spend money for a slim chance at a beta "lottery". Blizz should encourage people to find issues in their product, instead they lock it behind a paywall. Seems like a a lot of blizzard fans are literately willing to eat out of their hands lul.
---
Oh sure, i was talking about SFK though xD
---
I think the miners are the only non elites in DM aren't they
---
Rofl big dick energy
---
There will never be more than 50 players in ungoro anyway ;)
---
Do druids have a ressurection spell? 
---
I know they have rebirth/battle res. 
---
I think I recall that being a reason for them not getting picked for 5 mans as healer, unless you had a different class that could res.
---
There won't be any guild bank. So it's not gonna happen.
---
The f*** children always ahead. Crying.
---
O
---
I'll have a 3 month old by then (it's any time now). It's really hard to set expectations as I still have no clue how is gonna be having a kid. 
---
I'm gonna play a druid this time and just enjoy the leveling experience. Usually I rush to start raiding, so my new circumstances are gonna force me into offering the game in a different way. 
---
I can't wait to be a dad, and having classic as my "me time" as you put it, is the best kind of me time I can imagine, despite not playing it anywhere near the extend I had hoped to, when I learned it was coming.
---
Caffeine is easy to quit though? Coming from a guy who drank energy drinks every day + 1L of cola if not more.
---
Quitting smoking? Now that's HARD.
---
Evocating :DDD love it!
---
LET ME IN!!!!
---
but level 2 boots have stats in bfa....
---
In a jpg someone posted yesterday.
---
You ain't soloing any elite at that level with a druid, unless you chain root him and kill him with moonfire DoTs. Which hr couldn't do as Entangling Roots aren't usable in dungeons (outside of ZF).
---
Asmongold got hit for \~30 damage by elites with a 2 second swing in BFD on a roughly 1k1 health pool unbuffed, that means the elites would have to be pouding him for over a minute to kill him. With Armstring and badages this seems soloable without too much effort even for warriors.
---
Ok, I've been thinking for a bit now, and I've realised something, the only times these tigers have done correct damage when when the player isn't in a group, the times they've done reduced damage is when the player is in a two man group.
---
@YorkeZimmer
---
Okay. Want to elaborate?
---
God is it august 27th already? :D CANT WAIIIIT
---
Won’t really. 
---
Your top dps are still mages warriors rogues and hunters all of whole put out good dotless damage preraid
---
Several replies and none realize it's satirical.
---
That's an interesting observation, but the person I asked quoted only the bullet part rather than dodging. It sounded like they were suggesting arrows would have been the only possibility.
---
Can't be sure without an actual response from them.
---
It wasn't in vanilla. They came in patch 2.3 during TBC.
---
It would support one-man guilds just for the sake of storage space. So no, absolutely not a good idea imo.
---
One of the key 'deep' things I'd say that Classic devs did that modern devs don't do is they balance and control the game from a much further back position.
---
What I mean by that is if they determine a need for X in the game.. Modern WoW Devs implement X.
---
But what Vanilla WoW Devs do is try to figure out what to implement so that it changes the game in such a way that X occurs.
---
eg:
---
1) Players complain for more world PVP. 
---
New WoW Devs:-&gt; We will implement a world PVP zone, where there will be world pvp objectives, and a world pvp currency that can be grinded to get world pvp gear.
---
Old WoW Devs: -&gt; Lets put popular 40 man raid in heavily contested zone.
---
Are you able to link their streams? or is that against the rules?
---
I’m a first time dad of a 1 month old so I know exactly how you feel. I’m also planning on going Paladin because a cleric seems totally compatible with casual pacing. It’s going to take a long time to get to 60 but I’ll savour every precious moment on the journey.
---
Hadn’t thought of bubble hearth bug out, awesome point!
---
Same. I think there were like 6 or 7 of these threads in the last 24h and it just starts to strike me as Karmafarm at this point.  
---
There's pretty much no toxicity in any of the other threads but apparently everyone is gatekeeping and flaming each other.
---
Matlab knows what's good
---
A lot probably comes down to name recognition, but there's no doubt that Joanas guides cater to a very different demographic. I don’t think you need a paragraph to break down a quest objective and some people want to read the quest text themselves to which there’s plenty of time to do while travelling from point A to point B. There’s a ton of good resources out there, and it doesn’t make sense to do all the heavy lifting yourself. Database sites are good for looking stuff up on, but what makes them great are the insightful comments left by users. Instead of attempting to reinvent the wheel, just consult resources that have already figured out the puzzle. Whatever type of guide you like, competition is good.
---
I added the experience/level bar specifically so you could keep track of where you are compared to me. If you’re behind, you might want to squeeze some more value out of your travel times IF you’re playing a class that can move and deal damage simultaneously. If you’ve accumulated a decent amount of rested you might as well focus on getting to your destination asap.
---
Classic is a very different beast compared to private servers since quest hubs won’t be released over time and it has phasing. Giving an accurate time estimation is very difficult, but roughly 4-6 days played should be a decent representation of a competent player.
---
Thank you for making this post more noticable!
---
A few meme specs in the raid group is fine. A consistent feral druid is more desirable than a chad warrior who only shows up half the time.
---
Stoney Stark
---
Yup, definitely seems that way.
---
Anyone care to explain what's going on here?
---
&gt;amage output so much lower. L
---
I might be miss remembering but didn't you want him to cast shadow bolts back in the day because his melee hit for absurd damage?
---
Nope, they only have the battle res.
---
For those with Beta.
---
Can you please confirm if you see the Beta listed here:
---
https://account.blizzard.com/games
---
The assumption is it'll show up like a PTR account does.
---
Thanks! I'd rather just refresh that page 100000x a day instead of reloading the battle.net application :)
---
They only have a 30 minute cooldown resurrection, it can be used in and out of combat of course.
---
It's best to level to around 10 iirc then you can go to Westfall.
---
Really? According to some realmstats its 1600 people.

Written interview from wowhead iirc
---
It worked with severe lag, as far as I know no one has tried lag switching it, but it seems to be too impractical to be beneficial.
---
Short answer; regular front stabbing doesn’t work in the beta
---
What is a "published website"? Or rather, what is an unpublished website?
---
Yes you can but you have to travel there
---
Guildbank was the name of an alt :D
---
Sadly yes lol
---
I'm not sure.. most often that kind of thing is frowned upon. I've added the names which are the twitch handles.. so it should be easy to deduce.
---
&gt; Today, this sub seems like it become complete cancer to me  
---
You can't really blame this sub very much over this. What you're experiencing is a phenomenon where people congregate in large numbers and get very bored. What results is people having nothing better to do than flame each other and cause unnecessary attrition.  
---
It's all boredom. Don't worry about it. When Classic comes we won't be so bored. There will still be *some* people being annoying, but for the most part we're all going to have something to do. And you will have other people to do things with and you'll forget you ever dealt with trolls on the internet.

I made script in Matlab that generated random number from 1 to 7 500,000 times and this is the result.

---
Fuck em
---
I see.
---
I am in the same boat. I am just going to not raid and go for the tier 0.5 set. With the limited time I have that is going to take like 1.5+ years or something... I might do the occasional raid if the stars align but I am simply assuming that I won't be raiding this time around.
---
Good to hear that it's working out over there. I'll try to divide quest hubs into sectors so it's easier to confirm that you've picked up everything relevant.
---
It's the weekend. Probably more on Monday.

Maybe a mod will see and can clarify
---
Hi, /u/borgiedude
---
My second is more difficult than the first.
---
Ah, makes sense now!
---
those slowed charges look super cool, they been gone for a long time.
---
I thought so, which is why I asked if you still have it, because I don't think any of us should go through potentially weeks or motnhs of posts by you to find it.
---
If you don't have it at the ready anymore that's fine.
---
It’s what the cool kids say to prove they played classic even though Dire Mail wasn’t out on release lol
---
Scheduling “me time” and balancing that with mommy’s ditto can take some getting used to. But it’s so important. Best of luck!
---
That is my plan, 2.5 year old and a 7 month old, sometimes you just had to emergency afk.
---
But it’s not always like that. And there are times when you fight back and win. Then there are times you get lucky escapes or backup appears from nowhere. 
---
These are the fun times you’re bashing just because you couldn’t enjoy getting smacked on a little.

Ego much ?

---
If I had to give some feed back I'd say perhaps if someone was to mouse over a quest on the right side of the ui, a circle/area show up in the map where you can expect to find those mobs exactly?
---
I kind of expected to get invited today because its my birthday today. But no...
---
Wait, that went a bit fast for me. What was that rotation?
---
From what I've seen real quick the client currently seems to be based on somewhere between 8.0 and 8.1. No longer 7.3.5 like the demo was but not 8.1 either.
---
I believe your demon never changes nanes.
---
Hi, /u/zehuntar21
---
Ahh super, many thanks!
---
damn they took forever to kill him. clueless players.
---
Which guests?
---
I'm in the beta and mine says world of Warcraft legion public test realm (wow1). I assume that's beta because I didn't play during legion.
---
That's actually really cute and funny.
---
Idk why, I know that the whole invite this is completely random but this comment actually made me sad :(.
---
I’m curious who you could mean. Occasionally there are some controversial opinions and things but nothing seemed that glaring.
---
Yeah pretty much agree. There were only a few specs during certain patches that had a high skill cap in PvE and it was usually the Feral Druid and Affliction Warlock abusing snapshotting, but they removed it long ago already.
---
The level at which you enter the instance is pretty important thats true. Fighting a mob like Van cleef when you're 3-4lvls lower than him can result in crushing blows, and on top of that you already suffer from lower base stats and probably worse armor values, too.
---
It's hard to tell really. I'd still want Blizz to look into this to confirm the numbers are actually correct.
---
Oh man I think you're fixen to make allot of people think they are in Beta.
---
99% sure at some point you created a PTR account. :) 
---
So on that page you only see your "Battle For Azeroth" subrscription and this legion test realm?
---
https://youtu.be/CycINc0wFM4
---
Do people just not go look on YouTube anymore? It literally takes me a simple search to find it.
---
22 stress test so wait for a lot of invites ^^
---
It did, when you used that script. It was possible in vanilla, cant remember when they removed the possibility to use that script though.
---
11/27/2004
---
As per my accounts first game card purchase
---
Happy birthday!
---
Is there any info on when the level cap will be raised in the Beta?
---
Bro.......I here for you.
---
SoupaSoka did some testing with the demo client, and it had better performance than the 1.12 client. So if your PC can run private servers, it can run Classic even better.
---
Increased knowledge of the game, more availbility of any information concerning it, *better FPS and latency* all make players more prepared for PvE encounters, even if their reaction time/situational intelligence might be the same than in original Vanilla. Also on PServers, nobody wanted to wipe in dungeons, so people always ran them at relatively high levels comparatively and often refused lower level players, so it will most probably be the same on Classic.
---
 *It will be* easier.
---
You can but it would be pretty much pointless because there are no hunter trainers in Elwynn Forest and you'd have to travel back to Dolanaar to do your tame beast quest.
---

---
Stop this. No they are not. Are they better than warriors? No but they aren’t trash.
---
Makes sense. He even has a daughter now.
---
They probably haven't been made yet.
---
Only nobody cared about it, and it made you sound like a whiny bitch. There are a plethora of trivial differences between classic and actual vanilla. If you are incapable of knowing which matter and which don't, please leave the reporting to knowledgeable people.
---
Druids are amazing tanks, please ignore the idiots who continue to parrot that they're shit. You can tank almost every fight as a Druid, there are just a few where a warrior is preferred for various reasons.
---
Please check out "Skarm" on YouTube who has cleared Naxx with both warrior and druid. He has amazing guides and info for you.
---
Those are the only wow accounts listed for me on that page. I may have been in a beta a decade ago but for sure not in legion.
---
I have spinned the classpicking wheel and it landed right between Hunter and Warlock!
---
as a note this is not my video or my upload but seems to be the only one that still remains of the kill.
---
i did Sunk Temple alot back then, i never had a group that did the lower part.
---
Ok mate.
---
Do you need an active subscription to get into beta?
---
Damn. Here I was thinking I’d make it.
---
Pretty sure since the client is 1.12.1 this script if it did exist, idk wont be in the game and you will have to just reroll until you are content/love ur pet name.
---
Sorry Billy.
---
\*Me, playing a Gnome\*

Other Gnome: My, you're a tall one

---
Alliance has healers that actually heal, while the Horde shaman is at the front, accomplishing nothing in his attempt at absolutely not supporting. Just how I remember it.
---
Well thank you anyway:D That atleast confirms there isn't line on that page saying Classic Beta :)
---
Unfortunatey for me, my page looks like that. But when I launch the 'PTR: World of Warcraft' from my launcher, it is not classic :(
---
Okay... but... really, why does a 2004 game need Multi threading?
---
Shouldn't it run on a literal phone by now?
---
That's a bigger undertaking than it might seem at first glance but definitively something I eventually want to have. Critical updates take priority but expect it be in before the game actually launches.
---
Yeah I believe in retail I always ran WC at 16-18, it's sure that on PServers where all the groups are requiring 19+/20+ players it's easier. They're outleveling the thing, in the sense that the last bosses and final trash in dungeons should be brown/red as it was a method for Blizzard to increase the difficulty and was intended that way.
---
Lol i see people spam #NoChanges everywhere and now people realise that the game back in the day was ez as fuck it's just that we as players were super fucking bad now we start to see some change proposition pop it cracks me up hahahaha.
---
Yes and to also go into your account and opt in for it as well.
---
Yeah thats what im dreading. Cant run around with an imp named Rupnik or some shit like that.
---
Sorry! I didn't even have a region account drop down on my launcher before I was invited to beta. And I didn't need to reload it, I got a message bar that said update required and it started a 4gig download.
---
Haven't seen any yet, but I imagine it very likely they will raise cap or perhaps do some kind of premade thing.
---
Well, since you’re set on Orc I’d suggest rolling a warlock. Usually needed in raids/dungeons, great farming possibilities, smooth leveling experience and pretty easy to learn. 
---
Rogue could be an option aswell, though rogues probably will be more overpopulated (also harder leveling). Warriors are more tricky, both in terms of leveling and raiding. Shamans usually end up healing in raids, so unless you want to spend a lot of gold respeccing for farming purposes, I wouldn’t go shammy either. 
---
But that’s just my advice:) have fun and try out classes/watch some introductions.
---
only 2 hunters
---
Also it takes a reagent each cast...
---
Ayy shit! The feels
---
Maybe tomorrow, but 22th day is stress testing so should be more invites.
---
It's also our job to make it easier for them to make that list. People like you and OP are the reason why wow turned to shit after wotlk. In fact judging by the arguments you make, I'm pretty sure, you were in diapers back in '05, so let the experts do the reporting while you settle down and suck on your thumb kiddo.
---
The market for Classic WoW youtube is super saturated right now. Have fun trying to think up something that hasn't already been done to death by now.
---
Elder Scrolls Online, fun game.
---
So excited for classic cant wait for this type of stuff!
---
Yo, Wii bowling is hype though.
---
Would you mind sharing sources on where you got all this information and images? Super cool stuff.
---
Mine is 4
---
I'm definitely going to teach her fishing :D On a PVE server though, I'm affraid defending herself would still be difficult ;)
---
Snore
---
I assume that the characters made and levelled in the beta do not carry across to the finalised game?
---
I didn't know people even reported in WoW
---
Demon names are generated from your character name.
---
I remember I had a warlock called Hazrath in TBC that resulted in my voidie being called Ormrath. Which, I thought was pretty cool.
---
r/yourewhatswrongwithgamingcommunities
---
Interesting, thanks! 
---
Will continue restarting the bnet client :)
---
Nope, it's beta . Nothing will carry across.
---
Just be glad it wasnt Yapniz like mine.Rupnik is kinda cute. Y is the letter i dread for my demons.
---
&gt; Classic is the real BfA.
---
Great quote
---
I wanna die.
---
You could apply the same to fortnite and lol that are available.  
---
I don’t think wow will hold high number for long, but first few weeks it’s going to be there
---
Guess: you are not in either?
---
Some people are unable understand that they either fucked something up on their end or that there might be an issue with one of their components.
---
Instead they just delude themselves into thinking that everyone else is wrong and this is a wide spread issue, likely because they’ve invested so much into their build that they can’t accept there’s an issue with it.
---
I ran the game fine on private servers with max settings in every zone, including Ironforge on the day that Nost was going to shut down and thousands of people were spamming AoE. If my 7 year old build with a GTX 770, i5-4570, and 8GB’s of RAM never dipped below 80 fps, then the issue is on his end.
---
Hi, /u/Parzeival
---
I'm fine with that. But then, are they fine with account sharing ? If not, we need a solution
---
It doesn't have 'value' outside of being a collector's item...the seal has extra 'value' because it's more rare, didn't come from just creating a character, and comes from a place many people have fond memories of... and while they *are* worth that much, it is incredibly hard to sell them because they are such rare and 'valuable' items.
---
I've been trying to sell Recipe: Dirge's Kickin' Chimaeric Chops for the better part of 3 years now. Only offer that came close to being worth it was 2.5 million gold, but I would have had to transfer to their realm, sell it, then transfer back... I'm going to be sitting on this thing until I die.
---
Triggered.
---
110% blizzlike Shadowfang Keep mate.
---
Ahh Kungen. i Played on his server back in TBC, and a big crowd would allways form around him when ever he was around in Orgrimmar.
---
Imagine watching an entire baseball game.
---
Imagine watching a TV show.
---
Imagine listening to music.
---
Imagine existing lol
---
WoW lifestyle min-maxing.
---
They used a few of the old assets from the vanilla emerald dream in The Emerald Nightmare, the first raid of legion.
---
I played vanilla and tbh I can‘t remember shit. It‘s 14 years ago! I was...13 or 14. I still remember the music, the feeling and stuff but I will play as wrong as everybody else who is new to the game. And you know: I can‘t wait for it!
---
To the best of our knowledge there was never a cap beyond 10. This is what it was from the start of Legion when the system was introduced and has been ever since.
---
I'd suggest whoever said the cap was higher was misinformed.
---
They've already got testers who can perform perfectly.  The players who make mistakes may uncover unintended situations or results.
---
This is just very uninteresting
---
I think the only class a Tauren can be that wont have to go back to at least Org to train skills is a Warrior as I believe there is no trainer in UC for Shamans, Hunters or Druids.
---
Nononono don't make me wonder again what class i want to main. I keep switching it like every other day and its terrible.
---
Ok so i might be new here, can someone give me a rundown.  Why is he so popular now?  I keep seeing him in memes.
---
**~~tenants~~** **tenets** \- darn autocorrect
---
&gt; This isn't a crushing issue, but is extremely disappointing in terms of performance for low-end systems
---
I mean, not to be a snob or anything, but: this game is close to 15 years old. Older if you account for the development time. If your PC - for whatever reason - cannot handle this game, then that's simply up to you. By no way to we NEED the multi-core improvements of the modern client to handle classic. By no fucking way.
---
He's the guy who basically locked himself away for a whole week cutting and splicing code from the old engine and the new one to make Classic WoW even possible. Without him this literally wouldn't be happening, also he's extremely passionate about Classic in general.
---
10/10 what a legend.
---
Screw cooking. Just order pizza delivery. Use the Overwolf browser so you don't even have to leave the game. Pro tip right there.
---
Woah actual video evidence.  Clearly my recollection is wrong or i'm remembering much later patches (I played vanilla -&gt; cata).
---
There's a moment where the warrior dances to zerker and intercepts, but the delay is due to intercept not quite being off cd (half a second left or so).  Intercept is keybound to 1.
---
Mine was Zorpit, I liked it
---
Shouldn't be, but many would think so.
---
The epic 1hander with no stats on it you mean?
---
Lol yup I’ll be playin Holy Paly too.
---
Being fairly new to wow warlock and hunter would be your best bet as they offer the friendliest leveling system but plenty of depth at end game.
---
However if you want to always be useful no matter what then shaman is a great choice, just not as great farmers/levellers as the beforementioned
---
What are all the dungeon keys you can get (with phase 6 out)? I seem to recall that there were 5-6 of them.
---
Is he playing melee as hunter?
---
Hunter never was a melee class. Not even vanilla.
---
someone posted another image and it was causing confusion because most people were interpreting it as you weren't eligible
---
Sup yall its me its your boi Asmongold, do what I want bitch
---
I usually did full clears. It's not that bad when you know how to do it.
---
Who needs stacks when it has a proc
---
Ashkandi drop.
---
And then you‘ll go back to hating it again, get a patient group with you, good luck :)
---
Priest smite build!
---
keep in mind that each TYPE of mob is effectively an entry in a table in blizzards DB... think excel, and the damage values will be PRE-ANY-DR, so with 30% armor, you could expect 9-14 to be 6-10 range (not sure if blizzard floors or ceilings their values, so 6-10 is standard rounding...assuming floor 6-9, assuming ceiling 7-10).
---
Just keep this in mind when looking at damage numbers
---
Not about being controversial, more believing they’re always right, and don’t need to listen to anyone else because they are guests on the show and everyone else isn’t. I’ve never seen such a small amount of prestige go to people’s heads like this. Then of course, people suck up to all them for a chance to get on the show, only to mostly get totally ignored. 
---
Same carries over to the recent organisation of the countdown to classic guild.
---
Going on the discord has really harmed my ability to enjoy the show. Very cliquey.
---
Sourpatch has a terrible life and hates people having fun 🤡
---
I’d rather not say publically but I’ll PM you my worst offender
---
I never played Classic and I can tell you this looks incredible. I started in TBC and from what I've seen of Classic so far, TBC and Classic play somewhat similarly (at least in PvE.) Though, I was 6 years old and my memory is very hazy of it all so I could be wrong.
---
yes, it's by playtime
---
I think people are underestimating the mob xp from dungeons with how weak elite mobs in dungeons are compared to pservers. With a good group you can definetly get good xp/hour imo, even more efficient if competition for mobs is high. We might even see groups with mages-warlocks aoe farming certain dungeons
---
So you're telling me you're a prot pally? Nice...
---
Wasn’t it because he was still looking for a range weapon?
---
Do we know if non subscribers are going to be able to play? WoW lost me mid to late Cata and I don't want to pay the full subscription price to be able to play 15 year old version of the game. 
---
If not then ah well I guess I'll survive the biggest time sink ever passing me by haha
---
"i wont take handouts until i get epic mount on release" yea we'll see about that buddy
---
     /cast Bear Form

Damn I hope I'm not a bitch like you when I hit 45
---
p.s. to everyone here, Soccer donated $30 to this stream while I was watching and we talked about classic wow with a few other people watching. He’s just trying to promote a good channel and he even watched/helped Stump’s gf level for a bit. You are a good dude Soccer, keep it up
---
nope, would like to be but if i don't get in its not an issue as its only 2-3 months until its live anyway
---
You can watch someone pop off and do some amazing thing at just about any time on a fortnite/LoL stream.
---
Watching the leveling process, especially at the beginning, there is not going to be anything interesting happening unless maybe you're watching for world first or something. Even then, the first day or two isn't going to be anything spectacular.
---
Mage
---
I guess this sort of explains why some zones like Silithus and Azshara were unfinished in Vanilla. They were meant for the 65-70 level which never made it past pre-alpha.
---
One will be 2 and 9 months, the other will be 9 months. Both girls.
---
But I started in TBC so if I understand this subreddit correctly, I'm an irrelevant piece of garbage ;)
---
See you in azeroth.... At 4 am.
---
correct
---
didn't notice lol, i'm one of the 8 mages in the fight
---
fack fack fack i need a key!!
---
I'm pretty sure they were, actually.
---
If it wasn't for the cash shop they definitely would have upped the sub price by now
---
[Maybe in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqazmg/classic_beta_addons_that_are_working/)
---
only saw it on asmons stream live. didnt realise soda was on the other side. well cut video summary. god this game. it feels like i was asleep gaming-wise for a decade and just woke up. that joy only watching. 
---
cant wait for release.
---
Right there with you brother. Just put the kids to sleep, wife on de-aggro and I am now gonna enjoy 2 hours of epic gaming 😎👌
---
On a more careful watch of the first part of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKCUxRCILks) seems you are right. The animation stays exactly the same, it's easier to spot when you try ignoring what's going around and focusing on the feet. 
---
That's funny because based on my memory I was almost 99% sure that max level spring (without stealth) has a completely different animation and that was affecting stealth animation too. That's obviously me miss-remembering. While under stealth the animation indeed is always the same. 
---
I thing you might be onto something here, please make sure to put this on the megathread for more visibility!
---
Overwatch mostly
---
I don't understand the hate. It's a really good dungeon.
---
The quality is very low, but there is definitely some kind of trail behind that warrior there.
---
They're not OK with account sharing. People have shared an account but I have node if they will be detected.
---
Bug/test request: Do Scrolls of Protection benefit from the Druid bear armor multiplier?
---
Where are you people getting this? Westfall is like 'Nam with how often people die to mobs there.
---
i am watching nba but i would never watch a player when he is practising for 6 hours lmao. i am watching tournament.
---
i like twitch but only using for blizzcon,gdq,e3, sc2 tournaments etc... and sometimes for beta games.
---
Get lost with your envious toxicity. You are as insecure as a teen
---
Prepare what?
---
I've just been getting overtime at work and hitting the gym almost daily for now, trying to get my real life in order before classic drops.
---
Do you mean the beta or the actual game? Come to think about it you'll need to be subscribed to get into the beta and also to play the actual game upon release. You won't need the latest expansion pack though, which is nice.
---
Most of the dungeons were fairly easy in Vanilla, the big issue comes with having to keep threat on multiple mobs and runners/pats.
---
PPS: all cloth bolt lvls (from linen to runecloth bolts) can be fished from the floating wreckages "fish skools"
---
I'd say keep writing and building your audience and you'll be a shoe-in for the next beta! Good luck!!!
---
lost to a mount farmer
---
He's right. Asmongold said multiple times he wouldn't accept anything from his viewers until he had at least his epic mount.
---
POINTER! HE'S STARTING IT AGAIN!
---
Because they didn’t add armor to it, why does it need armor? Every starting zone gives you boots with no stats, that’s why I always take them off and run around barefoot until I get a pair that have stats.
---
Have they confirmed if it's an open beta that closes again after the 22nd or just a much bigger wave of invites that you get to keep access after the test?
---
Why is solo farming DM profitable?
---
Is it just vendoring the gear that drops from the tribute?
---
I watched a guide on how to do it as a hunter, which I played back in vanilla and want to play again. But I never knew that solo tribute runs were a thing.
---
OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS SUB WITH TOXIC COMMENTS LIKE YOURS!!
---
:''''''(((
---
Then how to deals with Guild bank ? Here is the answer i'm looking for them
---
It's part of the subscription.
---
Yeah, I am on a fucking RP Realm, so not worth, I have to transfer, pretty sure. But I prob. sell both Items (Since I dont have the Full set and can still buy it from Darkmoon) 
---
And just buy the BFA Addon off it.
---
Get ready for years of this stuff. Players and the resources are sooo much better now. People are gonna just load up on consumables and have all their stats and rotations theory crafted down to be perfect.
---
Add it all together and the content will probably feel a lot easier than what we remember.
---
Where did Skorch appear from? The camera turns away and when it turns back he's just in the middle of them... Did he use an invisibility pot?
---
They might have a freeze on merging in upstream changes until release. Polish up what they have to make sure they meet that deadline without risking new bugs from introducing new features.
---
I started with a Guild in 2005 and stuck with them through thick and thin in Vanilla.
---
And I'm doing so again. I don't understand what I'm missing. I'm not missing anything, except building a community from day 1.
---
Just stop with your assumptions this being about gear. Please.
---
You are projecting your way, which seems to be the correct way to experience vanilla apparently on to everyone.
---
Sorry, but starting with a Guild or without a Guild. Who cares? Do what you want.
---
i'd say it takes longer  
---
it depends on how good you are at each of those levels, but it took joana 5h40m (a somewhat normal time) for 59-60 but was already 25% into 14 in his first 5h40m
---
We're talking about a 15 year old game. 
---
It ran just fine on a pentium 4 and a FX 5200 back in the day so what's the outcry about.
---
As long as your PC was bought in the last decade+ you're gonna be just fine.
---
Mage is the most useful pure dps spec imo because you have the best dungeon CC and you have water. Hunter is easy to level and also strong in dungeons especially while leveling because of pet. That's a good all around caster and an all around physical damage. If you want the utility of healing, druid is a very strong choice however if you don't really want the option of feral tanking/dps later then I would say priest is even better as shadow is amazing in pvp and holy is amazing in pve. I know this is 3 answers but hopefully it gives you some more direction.
---
In-depth discussions about classes in high end raiding/pvp from people with actual KNOWLEDGE.

All this crap about "OMG WHAT CLASS TO PICK", "TOP-5 PROFESSIONS" etc are all shit.

---
Thank you for your quick reply.
---
Round about 4-6 days /played sounds very good (even if it were a bit more) and I make sure that I have a focus on the level bar. I look forward to leveling with your tool because it illustrates in clear manner then Joanas guide and is pretty intuitively to use.
---
I will definitely use your tool for the upcoming release then. and recommend it to my friends.
---
Thank you for your hard work. I will keep you updated after classic release how my leveling experience was with this awesome tool =)
---
But what is your resolution? For an old engine like 1.12 that will make a big difference.
---
WoW has been, is and will always be a CPU heavy game.
---
That’s a beta you guys need to chill
---
You can literally see a trail in the video you linked if you look closely, its just incredibly low res

AFAIK, you should on have one account. Not shared. They do the work. What people do to break the rules is at their risk. 
---
There is/was not provision for Guild Banks in classic.
---
Never had your phone in your hand, drinking, eating, scratching your...? It's a life saver really.
---
Hey folks!
---
This is the intro to the latest episode in my Classic WoW dungeon series. Check out the full episode here!
---
As we all know, Asmongold is the pinnacle of honesty. No dirty lies would ever come out of those graceful lips. Asmongold is the very shining star that is common decency which we can call learn from.
---
Did you plot this with m script or use something else more convinient
---
I am 100% but a few people in my team are saying G.F is giving them grief I wondered if it was a common problem. :D
---
If by "viable" you mean can compete with regular questing/grinding for high XP/hour rates, then no. If by "viable" you mean you can get to 60 that way, then yes.
---
The most efficient levelers will probably stay out of dungeons until level 60. Personally I like to do each (or at least most) dungeon once and completing all quests there. Maaaybe if I'm melee and really need a new weapon I'll go a couple more times just to get it, as I'm so reliant on having a good one.
---
Is yours not?
---
Druid would be the obvious pick here if you're trying to be good at everything.
---
Fast and enjoyable leveling experience?  Check
---
Great wpvp class?  Check
---
Can fill any position in dungeons and multiple in raids?  Check
---
WSG and AB flag spinning all star?  Check
---
Since you seem open to playing half the class pool still, maybe give Druid a second look.
---
Keep it coming, we need to find all of our old friends!
---
I thought I was going to be a shaman but tbh I can’t stand the totem play. 
---
So I’m leaning priest or warrior or mage ...
---
You will fight with rogues and warriors for some items. Sometimes it will go in your favour if you show your guild that you are a good and trustworthy raider.
---
To succesfully play specs like Feral Tank you need to be flexible. Try to pick up pieces for a healing set for fights where that might be needed, also being able to have a decent feral cat set would be really nice.
---
As Nornamor said, Skarm has alot of good videos of Feral tanks up on Youtube. Go check em out.
---
I played on Nostalrius until lvl 53 and pretty much everyone I encountered were adults, mostly late 20s+. I know this because we actually voice chatted and they'd talk about their memories from vanilla and know a shit ton of details about it
---
I used to use the campfire ramp trick to get into harder places, but im going to assume that trick is going to be looonggggggggg gone.
---
Yikes, its definitely lack of memory and you really dont watch his streams that often then
---
Was already posted here a while ago, mate.
---
Good call man. Ferals are really good early on in the game and even better than Warriors for the initial 5-mans/UBRS.
---
I never even made it to 60 during Vanilla's lifetime (only made it to 60 after BC hit), despite playing since not too long after the game launched. 
---
Severe altoholic and chronic respeccer that couldn't stick to one way of playing, although healing was always my favorite. I don't expect this to change. Leveling has always been my favorite part of the game until they messed up the reward structure of it.
---
Oh hey, it's another one of these.
---
You know what? I am watching Tipsoutbaby SM Graveyard right now and the Elites are doing like 50-60 damage. If i look at classic DB [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4293](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4293) they should be doing like 250-300 damage which makes more sense in my head.
---
Interesting observation I made based on your comment now is it COULD be that the damage is divided per group members: 250/5 - 300/5 = 50-60 dmg 
---
I am wondering if this is what is happening. They did a pull of 6-7 elites cause of his idiot battleshout that feared the mobs, they should have been dead within like 20sec from such a pull.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k5K4a-teWo) was already in the first page for the past 24 hours already and dropped to second page literally minutes ago
---
I'm not saying I'm surprised.
---
Oh my god this is really awesome. Seeing so much old guild names on that pages makes me really nostalgic. Especially since I was playing on a german server. Sad to say, that I don't have any time to play classic because of adult life.
---
Imagine giving a fuck what people enjoy
---
What about classic (dark) nights? Do we have a dev answer to that? Is it coming?
---
&gt;  between those two time stamps Joana was affected by the stone skin totem which reduces damage taken by 4, so the most likely cause IMO is that the buff part got stuck on somehow.
---
Shit, that sounds like it might just be it.
---
Chill with the hate old man
---
From my experience trying to convince people to play games with you rarely is succesful. Show them some footage and tell them how excited you are and that they should try it out if they want a nice adventure. Don't go beyond that. If they wanna play they play.
---
If not, then there are literally thousands of potential new people for you to meet and make connections with. Vanilla WoW is excellent for building communities.
---
You can't just go around renaming your friends!
---
But yeah, macro system is different so scripts like that probably won't work?
---
and how is that directly related to the streamer? You do realize a server can be populous without a streamer and his retards going around?
---
Because that's where you'll find what the majority of players think.
---
Reddit is an incredibly small percentage.
---
I mean DPS in general are never guaranteed a raid spot unless you're like a mage or the token warlock. But with 40 men it's not going to be hard to really get into a raid especially when 95% of the raiding is more than likely going to come through guilds with set up teams anyways.
---
It does seem too easy
---
Pretty uncanny too that it beat warrior and mage even though they had more than one dog in the fight.
---
Hi, is it very bad to want to do all the quests in the game, complete all the zones? Will I be set back too much?
---
And died
---
&gt;Increased knowledge of the game, more availbility of any information concerning it, better FPS and latency
---
I see this stated a lot, it's like people think we didn't have broadband or the internet in general when vanilla was around. There was tonnes of information online when vanilla was live, the vanilla client, like most blizzard titles, was engineered to run very well even on bad rigs, and internet speeds were already fairly decent. Maybe some people had trouble with latency or fps, but you generally wouldn't find those people in the better raiding guilds as they wouldn't be putting up numbers good enough to justify a spot. 
---
Before nax was out Youtube was up and running and you would see people posting boss videos on youtube. So on the information front, we had it, we had boss videos, we had all the information we needed to prep for a boss before we did it. People in vanilla weren't blindly going in to fights unprepared except maybe the top guilds in the world, who were doing the research for the other 99%.
---
There is a difference between bandwidth and latency, sure bandwidths have gone up massively, latency has not changed dramatically in the last 15 years. Broadband was widespread at the time vanilla wow was live. Maybe in the USA it's a different case due to the infrastructure, but for asian and european countries we were playing with decent ping in vanilla. 
---
Will vanilla be easier this time around - for experienced players yes because they have already played wow before or because they have done those instances before. Will it be easier for people who are perhaps new to WoW entirely? Not at all.
---
ok
---
Mine is watching asmon’s streams with me so I guess not :P
---
i mean keep in mind that they are like bis geared for lvl 30 lol, most people when it actually releases wont have that good gear when they'll be running sm graveyard.
---
its been a while since i have killed hoggrr but as i recall it the tents arouns the gnolls and hogger are made out of human skin.
---
Jesus that rogue got fuckn snapped
---
Could just be this is outside the instance imo. Not in the beta but I speed run this part in the same manner even on pservers. 
---
The real threat from SMs mobs come in the form of monks which hit like an absolute freight train early on, and myrmidons which you really want to focus fire due to that enrage mechanic. Everything else probably could be chain pulled.
---
Random greens dropping from enemies should not have "&lt;Random Enchantment&gt;"  on them. Iirc, thats only from crafting.
---
from what ive seen this is literally how it was in vanilla. But with how much better we have gotten at the game it just becomes such a joke. Wish they would make it harder instead of sticking to nochanges... seems like most of the community disagrees though :(
---
so toxic xd
---
Seeing as I’m female I will not be having any issues on the 26th with gf aggro. I may have kid aggro however.
---
Nude lvl 10 Gnome test
---
from what ive seen its like this in all dungeons.
---
I still remember it if it was yesterdays, and not like 12-13-14 years ago:
---
On weekly reset (wednesday), in like 90% of the times (or maybe 100%?) at least 1-2 of the emeral drakes would reset on our servers. That was a known fact to the big 2-3 alliance and 2-3 horde guilds. 
---
For some reason, those 5-6 guilds managed to have almost an entire raid each (at least 30) people online by 11am. - I can only speak for myself: I skiped school more then once. 
---
At the beginning, it was one big ganking feast. 
---
At some point the guild leaders (cross faction) agreed on taking turns and not fucking each others turns up.
---
That was a thing for a couple of weeks, until the look table got less interessting for the guilds. 
---
Good times.
---
Took 100+ peoples time for at least 2-3 hours, to get like 3 items :D
---
The boat you'd take docks in Menethil Harbor.  You will then have to run through Wetlands, avoiding the level 22 crocolisks, Loch Modan, and finally Dun Morough.   It'll be a long corpse run at level 1.
---
&gt; be warned though its terribly boring after awhile
---
So is constantly waiting on respawn of devilsaurs that can be stealed and give roughly the same amount of G, no?
---
How many h/pala's were generally given a raid spot? And what was the must have build? I have played around with the talent calculator but it was so long ago that i used those talent trees (i started late TBC and quit h/pala at WoD) i have forgotten what some things do lol
---
I wouldn’t worry that much about it. End game content should still be somewhat hard
---
It's really unclear what's going on tbh, I've changed my mind, and I think it might be something to do with him being grouped up in the second time stamp.
---
I used this - [http://sankeymatic.com/build/](http://sankeymatic.com/build/)
---
I'd say 4-6, to answer your first question
---
gear doenst make that much of a difference when elite dmg is pretty much 0
---
I was actually surprised that the class thas has only one entry won
---
Any chance you could manually send me the links?
---
He was grouped when he fought the surf crawler too, and it was just a few minutes before he fought the tiger with the low damage. Could it have been just that one tiger? What if there's some mechanic in vanilla that nobody remembers/noticed that some mobs just randomly spawn with lower stats?
---
I guess we'll just have to wait until Blizzard responds to it. Or they could give us all beta and we could go test it out ourselves :\^).
---
No. You normally do like 80% of them anyway :)
---
We had the same system on Argent Dawn EU but then our main competitor guild decided to jump us during a 2% try. So instead of serverfirst we wiped miserably. After that there was basically a civil war for a week, the news spread in the community and everyone wanted to exact revenge - thats wow how it should be!
---
Hi, bro! I don't have tabs, i made this music hearing the original version and doing on the guitar. It's a "trial and error".
---
He could do it in Kharanos.
---
I hope Omar is enjoying these memes as much as I am
---
lmao the song in the second video.. that's what I'd listen to if I ever got high on bathsalts and decided to eat my friend's face
---
Yes, vendorin or disenchanting. Just check the vendor prices, it's **a lot** of money, and you get it in like 8-15 minutes I think.
---
I never killed this fucker, we had a 1% try but never did manage to kill him. Part of the reason Im going classic is to down him once and for all
---
What's a ''girlfriend''?
---
I should be able to grind in vanilla for my sub, cause iv barely ever played retail, and i dont wanna play retail :)
---
That second sentence reads like a quote from a history book. I love it.
---
One of the reasons why he is perfect candidate for testing... Can't believe they didn't chose I'm in a first place.
---
Who? Sodapoppin showed it 5 mins into beta access
---
Can I interest ya in a pint?
---
Scholo, UBRS, DM... SM. Gnomer back door lol.
---
you're just spouting shit to seem smart, motw is never more than a 3-5% armor increase on any of the buff levels.
---
25 armor is less than ANY upgrade you will ever get 1-10, armor rating wise.
---
People interpret things they read on the internet the worst possible way and then react to it and possibly get offended. Sad really.
---
A guild officer creates an alt to act as the guild bank.  Players mail stuff to this officer and the officer mails/distributes stuff to guildies per guild-created rules.  Inventories may be listed on guild websites (probably discord nowadays).
---
I noticed that Asmon changed a bag, without removing it's content. I think you had to remove all inventory first in vanilla? or is this just a p-server thing?
---
You guys should put it in the sidebar as a 'resource' or something, i've seen tons of people not having any idea this exists.
---
There is no way they were ever doing 250-300 damage with auto hits. Scryers might do that much damage if they get their cast off but not with auto hits.
---
He will. I'm sure that he is lurking here. 
---
At least after the post yesterday. The dev team is following this sub.
---
Solo farming Dire Maul? That's an endgame dungeon. The Tribute requires crafted items to complete. Are you sure you don't mean Dead Mines?
---
Solution is to not die, but ye it's druid healers' drawback.
---
He was the true and only king of Lordaeron.  
---
What started as a stupid idea with a friend in 2007 (not in classic, sorry) ended up in one of my fondest memory of this game :
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sl\_IX6mpNI&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sl_IX6mpNI&amp;)
---
Man this is wholesome. Great to see that actually playing the game reminds people of why we fell in love with wow. Looking forward to August!
---
Invites start in like 1 or 2 Hours, finger crossed. But the Starting Zones are full, so they prob. invited a lot yesterday.  
---
Just got my Classic Account back, so finger crossed :P
---
The problem is "no changes" is not true, having only molten core out as a raid with 1.12 talents/itemization IS a change and makes the game easier. Changing the actual numbers to compensate for that would make it more "authentic" IMO.
---
Dad reporting in. My son is 12 months now and I just turned 28. So yeah I became a dad between vanilla and classic xD
---
I think it doesn't despawn at all but becomes hostile after 5 minutes and must be enslaved.
---
Yeah the damage on Verdan the everliving is definitely correct, big dick tank got hit for 170 (had better gear, more HP, more armor)   
---
Tips got hit for just 200 which isnt much more (has half his HP broken armor and lower lvl thus lower defense)  
---
Gets crushed/crit for 400 , is accurate
---
A welcome change if you ask me :D
---
What I liked so much was that there is the natural progression. When I started  in 2005 or so there was a lot of end game content available and with that a looot of guilds at different stages. Only the very hardcore players were done with all the fights and waiting for the next bit of content. Nowadays almost everyone is waiting for something new to do.. Blizzard gave themselves such a big workload just by making all their previous work irrelevant!
---
I really can't see a single upside to layering.
---
Like, what about a temporary spawn-rate scaling solution like the most popular private server has?
---
Any idea which pieces I would want to disenchant? Or how much more it would give? I wasn't planning on having disenchanting on my hunter.
---
Those mobs are hitting way too low.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4283](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4283)   
---
Check the Scarlett Sentry, IMO that is not unrealistic. Tipsout has like 1500 HP and the mob hits for around 300 damage. Thats like 20% of his health, does not seem wrong to me.  
---
However in their current run the damage of Sentry is around 60, which again is 300/5.  
---
Also checked out Frostadamus who got hit full cloth gear with a 60 critt from a Deviate Dreadfang ([https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5056](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5056)) that is noted to be 150 damage. 150/5 = 30 \* 2 = 60 critt  
---
I am feeling more and more certain about this the more stream dungeon runs I check.
---
It made you feel like a pro when you were the only one who knew how to navigate the place and how to actually clear it properly.
---
I looked in Beastiary, and Surf crawlers should hit quite a bit harder than the tigers, so the damage may be nerfed for them two, it's just harder to tell since they're meant to hit harder anyway.
---
It's sad that it's taken as "community". If this minority doesn't like something and throws a fit, then "Blizzard/Activision" is the literal devil and doesn't listen to the community.
---
That's what I'm afraid actually, that they will start to "listen to community" and implement every feature the forum demands.
---
"Media" only help this as they don't have anything real to report so the interpret heavily upvoted posts as "community backslash".
---
Its ok if you skilled you will get a job
---
Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Ironforge, Blackrock Mountain, Stranglethorn Vale to mention a few.
---
Smart moves if she games often you will get less grief. Does she player healer? :D
---
Because you get higher framerates that way. Jesus fuck what a dumb question.
---
Lol this is sm graveyard? A level 29 instance? That one was always easy.
---
Lol this is amazing
---
Our Lord and saviour. Turns legion into vanilla. Now give me back swirly ball and i'll be his follower.
---
First of all, how do you know Classicdb is correct?
---
Second of all, how can you say 250-300 damage is realistic at level 30 when that is what the elites hit for in Stratholme at 60 on OVERTUNED private servers?
---
There's no hate, I don't care enough about them to hate them. I care about them as much as they care about one of their viewers.
---
&gt; I should be able to grind in vanilla for my sub, cause iv barely ever played retail, and i dont wanna play retail :)
---
1. That's not really a question.
---
2. You can always just pay the subscribtion fee if you don't want to play retail in order to get WoW Tokens.
---
Sehr gut!
---
I started about 3-4 months before Wotlk, Classic is the closest I can get to late BC without going to a private server, which I don't want to do.
---
There are no new character animations in Classic. The only graphics that are modern are slightly improved textures, more ground clutter + grass movement, dynamic shadows and actual water physics.
---
lmao wait for the blue post
---
I'll upvote any thread that says Tips is an idiot. That guy really shouldn't have an audience.
---
they're overgeared, what do you expect
---
I love the names! In Vanilla folk had great names
---
i mean the boss hit Moo for around 90 damage on average each hit, that mage is taking 120s 115s and 1 time he got hit for 90, doesnt seem wrong at all :P
---
Right... but then in the harpy clip he's not grouped, and those seem to be dealing less damage too.
---
if I get time off I'll just start early in the morning
---
Played alliance from release till wrath so thisll be my first time experiencing pretty cata horde. Anything interesting I should know? I know org is different. I know running vc is basically impossible, same thing with gnomer.
---
to be fair the size of Kalimdor looks like Tanaris
---
Is there a way to install WoW Classic on my SSD without installing the entire 60gig BFA client? My SSD is only 128gig.
---
I mean, he was a pretty smart player up until like wrath id say. Not skilled, but he did come up with a lot of interesting gadgets, techniques and macros.
---
Didn't ulda have a back door key too or am I remembering  incorrectly
---
Is beta open so anybody can play it? And will beta reset once it is released?
---
Not too dry
---
That's what I really value about people. When they realise they've been wrong and they're not afraid or ashamed to admit it. I know so many stubborn people who do no matter what to prove their thing.
---
yikes
---
Only once they're dead on the ground i front of you. For the Horde.
---
I got my girlfriend into WoW in late legion, but we kinda stagnated in BFA like most other people. She still hasn't really ever got into endgame because she was always more interested in messing around, doing professions and trying to give random strangers in Zul'dazar the food she had cooked. She was always sad that a lot of the time she couldn't trade because of realm sharding, or people were just apathetic and antisocial to her good gestures. I can't wait to play classic with her. She's gonna be the best cooking mama to all the levelling adventurers.
---
Some of us don’t like the undercity, I get it’s circular design is efficient but as an orc, orgrimmar just feels like home.
---
I almost made it Diablo Immortal but even I can't bring myself to do it
---
In 1.1 you could swap gear in combat..
---
Nope. She share interests of gaming albeit different games so she understands the hype.
---
She'll support me with my interest like I support her with hers
---
Does the classic beta client they're running now support 21:9 resolutions such as 2560x1080?
---
streamers getting invites cause they are streamers. most if them never played vanilla, tbc, wotlk or even cata. probably not even having a active subscription when they got invited.
---
BRD has a key too.
---
Name gave me cancer but that's amazing. 15 years is such a long time, hope you have fun!
---
What I would like to find is a list of non-retail streamers, ie. those that were private server players
---
Lie to me... :p
---
Fuckin love that one!
---
I agree.  I never watched a twitch stream before classic beta and I probably won't watch after I get to play the game myself.
---
look for "omar gonzalez blizzard"
---
I'd honestly say that the community had a part in killing conversation with the group finder. There are several other MMOs with group finders for dungeons, and I regularly have talkative groups.
---
Undead rogues are by definition called undead rouges
---
I've seen this happen a few times myself. Every time the response goes like this
---
Silence 
---
Acts cool/plays it off "Yea my dude I know"
---
Leaves shortly after
---
Stops talking to that person.
---
rogue is great in classic and alot of fun between lvl 35-50 in stv. u will enjoy it
---
I loved this and i've been using it for a while as well. I like that it's easy to look and remember where things are.
---
One thing i would love to see is have a different menu for Rares and Chests with their locations.
---
Maybe i'm a little tired of questing and want to explore the map to find rares and chests.
---
I feel like having their location on map as a toggle or something would be great.
---
No you don't need to subscribe. I personally know people who were invited without an active subscription. It might help you idk.
---
Cool. You do you, man.
---
Yes and no.
---
These dungeons were easy, but once you passed thirty that's when shit really got crazy.
---
Like remember the monks in SM?   
---
How about the polymorphing mages?   
---
We don't get to see the hard stuff in the current beta because the sub-30 dungeons were really never all that hard.   
---
They were hard in the sense that like you said, people were entirely new to these things when they entered and did a lot of stupid shit.
---
ItS sO toXIC
---
How do people without beta keys even find bugs? Oh yeah, because of the streaming beta testers. A miracle.
---
Nothing for retail except you wanna waste time helping a streamer who backpaddles
---
Yea, why is it always human paladins?
---
Invite only. You need to have an active sub right now to be considered.
---
Beta will reset and everyone playing now will have to start over. Betas are for testing purposes only and not a head start.
---
The beta is currently closed and you can only get in when blizzard marks your (active) account to allow access. You can check whether you’re in or not by checking the drop down menu titled Region/Account right above the play/install button on your WoW tab in the blizzard launcher.
---
When I'm raiding they are lowest, when I'm out questing they are medium. In Legion I could run the game really well even on higher graphics as long as there weren't many people around me, that's why I got low fps in raids
---
Agree, its similar to the new mail system. Doesnt matter really :)
---
Nice meme
---
Here's old comment from  [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4275/archmage-arugal#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4275/archmage-arugal#comments) 
---
"Arugal's main damage comes from his spells, if he runs out of mana he is pretty weak."
---
From what I’ve heard, you don’t need to have BFA installed to play classic. Also, it sounds like classic is about 7gigs right now.
---
Satisfactory Early Access
---
A 1,5 years old when it's released. The bad part however is that when I heard about classic they said summer release. I am a teacher and my summer break ends 7th of August. I have been on parental leave since December so my hopes were to be able play at least all of July when the little one was sleeping/doing other child stuff. Instead I get release on a school night in one of the toughest part of my work year with slim chances of getting time off.
---
Fair enough, under the assumption that the values of ClassicDB are correct then this theory seems fitting. I don't know his armor status no, but if you assume the values I mentioned, I think we can both agree that he should not be able to have enough armor to reduce the damage to 60 from 300.  
---
My values may not be correct, but I don't remember playing Vanilla and casually being able to take down elite mobs, quite the opposite, I remember being forced to run the fuck away as fast as I could if I got elite mob aggro.
---
Nope, I have a reasonable girlfriend. 
---
To be serious for a bit, I genuinely do not understand guys (or girls) who are with someone who doesn't approve of their hobbies. Who do they think they are to judge and condemn someone's hobbies as waste or how they spend their free time? Baffling. I've been with several girls over the years who had this attitude about how I spent my free time and the only way to deal with it is to dump them. It's simply a huge red flag and 
---
deal breaker to me.
---
keep em coming guys, hopefully omar sees and knows he's appreciated!
---
Enhance sucks in 1.12 :(
---
I had this happen to my Troll priest back in vanilla, I got NE skin and my Horde tabard turned into alliance, it made my skin crawl.
---
I believe there’s talents that speed up stealth movement.  Might be some of the discrepancy gore seeing
---
Yea, I've disproved the group theory.
---
After seeing the interview and them saying they have the original architecture and old client to compare with , it's pretty safe to say they will get the values right , there's no point in QQ\`ing anymore :). Even tho....after 2 full years on private servers back in my mind I always compare it.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0XSL4uBipw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0XSL4uBipw)   
---
u dont have to run in wetlands
---
They said just a bigger wave of invites I believe.
---
He hasn’t even trained the skill yet as far as I know.
---
The Barrens is an incredible zone. Huge, immersive, and such a great place to meet fellow levelers. 
---
WC is good fun, as is the instance in Org.
---
Undercity is confusing but a really cool place, full of flavour.
---
&gt; With all software, you always rely on the customer testing it, as they might use it in ways you never even considered while developing it.
---
Yes... as in playing the game as they normally would without trying to force bugs. The entire point of a beta like this is to have a larger playerbase than your QA team to simulate the live game. More people playing the game in various ways = More chance of finding random bugs.
---
It's sunday. I doubt they are inviting anyone today.
---
The Battle.net launcher automatically tries to install the entire 60gig wow client every time I launch it.
---
Yes, it's a p-server thing.
---
Blizz will probably address it this week. Wouldn't be surprised if they're as intended, these are noob leveling dungeons m8.

There'll be a lot more Rogues than Hunters imo.
---
It will take you a long time and may be annoying at times but if it's important to you then definitely go for it. It is doable (lots of people got the Loremaster achievement before Cata).
---
2 weeks holliday and the whole Guild is fucked
---
I know, and it was quite obvious he meant if you are unsubbed ^^ people just cause drama out of nothing.
---
You don't seem to be acknowledging anything else that I linked or wrote. Stratholme elites doing 250-300 damage at LEVEL 60 pretty much instantly kills the idea that SM GY mobs should be doing the same damage. On top of that you have overtuned private servers where SM GY mobs aren't even close to 250-300 damage, but rather down at around 110-120. The idea that SM GY mobs should be doing 250-300 damage is just objectively false. If they did, it'd be impossible to heal since they hit very fast and even one mob would cause a wipe a lot of the time, which is definitely not how vanilla was.
---
It's still very worthwhile without enchanting. I'm planning on doing it without as it's more important to me to have engineering plus a gathering profession.
---
Asmongold started playing in July 2006 and it took him 20 days /played to reach level 60. 
---
So you can imagine that he didn't do much if anything at all at endgame in Vanilla.
---
Why cant there be an option where i can pay with classic gold for game time or sub?
---
I know how to play my class but I dont remember any dungeons/bosses/raids etc anymore.
---
I want to keep it that way however for that fresh noob experience rather than learning it all and effectively "spoiling" it for myself.
---
Am I gonna have a bad time because everybody already has played through it 50 times and I suck at raiding?
---
Okay there is obviously something wrong with you. Good bye.
---
&gt; tell me why I should choose one over the other?  
---
Nah. You can choose.
---
Heh just took a look at Esfands lib run. Definitely hit less hard hard than K3 mobs for sure. Best I’ve managed to do is for comparative values is a BC video from 08, but classic values seem accurate to the 08 version. Wouldn’t object to a retune in that case.
---
Not true at all. Hunter and Rogue are about equally populated on every server. The difference is that raids will take 8-9 rogues but only 2-3 hunters.
---
That would have been so sweet, sorry it didn’t work out!
---
Rogues are a dime a dozen (like Warriors and Mages). Go Hunter.
---
TRUE I AM TOXIC
---
I just watched a video on it and I feel like part of the reason you didn't hear much about it is because it is so niche. So you gotta have all these craftable items and the dps to make it worth it. By the point you get the gear to make that run efficient, which you could be doing something else like running dungeons for more gear, you're already pretty late into the game. The invisibility potions and keys/charges aren't going to be cheap. And any mistakes are going to set you back as well. 
---
There's so much to do in this game that hyper focusing on one thing when you've got other options available is a huge setback. You could be farming reputation, getting attunements, and doing dungeons legitimately for gear. That's probably why most people weren't doing this.
---
You might get lucky, my second was a girl, my son was happy to just sit and play, she wants constant attention. But both do sleep from 7pm to 7am to gaming time should remain ok.
---
+1 regarding the onboarding experience. When I load it up, I got that same feeling you get when a restaurant brings out all your orders at once and you’re just, like, “oh my god where do I start”. 
---
Apart from that, looks great!
---
Well in Murica you don't actually get to take your vacation, so the guild is safe.
---
Yeah Ive been here since day 1 and its always been a chill subreddit. Theres lots of negativity towards streamers but nothing that goes too far or into the realm of toxic imo. I think most people are just nervous about how streamers could possibly damage the classic experience which is so important to all of us
---
&gt; there's no strategizing like we had in vanilla:
---
Strange because its infinitely harder
---
Well, it’s a level 30 quest...
---
If you pick dwarf hunter, you are picking the hardest class to master with the wrong race to pvp and pve efficiently.
---
Human rogue is the safest choice for both aspect in the game.
---
Jesus christ this is so true.
---
There's no way they'll release it early. If anything, there's a bigger risk/chance they'll release it later, due to not getting it done in time. I don't think I've ever seen a big release suddenly get released way before the 'official' release date. It's usually the other way around.
---
Hi all! I'll be rolling a Dwarf Priest when Classic launches. I know Westfall like the back of my hand, but Loch Modan not so much and Darkshore honestly not at all. How much fun are those 3 areas compared to each other? Cause I've been thinking of trying out Darkshore. Westfall is also considered quite difficult right? Any tips would be welcome!
---
I think we'd all be surprised how a single post or a video that gets just a little recognition could affect newcomers
---
personally i concerned with how threat works, asmongold seem to be holding threat too easily on multiple mobs, even like 6 mobs, just hitting them once with white attacks. personally i dont remeber it being the case and mobs should reagro on a healer when he heals even once.
---
As for Verdan he always hit like a truck even in wotlk. Especially if you are underlevel. Why would ppl trust a guy's "expert" opinion that get lost in the same very instance, seems like a credible source, right? rhetoric question ofc.
---
Each server having an identity of its own.  As well as top guilds / players could build rep. It was all very unique
---
Oh.
---
This is useful information, I have no real concept of raid compositions for Classic. Is there a particular reason guilds tend to take two to three times more rogues than hunters? Is it purely down to DPS output?
---
I mean the actual game, and that's fair, but with that info I'll not be playing it
---
Hi, /u/cubemackie
---
&gt;Omar Gonzalez
---
thank you.

---
Yes, yes it would've been. However on the brightside I am currently in more contact with my old friends than before so massively beating away any parental loneliness!
---
I've been reading that the popularity of rogues was forecast to be higher than hunters but didn't know if that would effect the likelihood of being invited to raids etc.
---
I also remember it being harder then what I see on stream and I doubt I’ve been poisoned by the retail experience since I stopped playing many years ago. 
---
I remember how important it was to have CC in every group and how attractive mages was for this reason l. From what I see now it doesn’t seem like anyone care about CC. They just pull. 
---
Obviously it might be the case that early dungeons like WC are easier than I remember because they are targeting new players. But SFK and SM are already considered quite far into the game.
---
It's not about 'remembering' exact mob damage values from 15 years ago and you know that. There's literally videos showing different values and the same values. You're making it sound like it's baseless assumptions when it really isn't. There's direct evidence of values being different and the same, people 'just' have to figure out which one is the right one.
---
Rogues are going to be everywhere and I think I read somewhere that hunters don't do anything that another class can't do better.
---
I'd go rogue for the ganks.
---
As a Rogue main since Vanilla I'll be going Rogue again. I would have gone Mage or Priest if mana wasn't such an annoyance, especially in BGs where you ress, buff up, then have to drink again before you can even jump back into combat.
---
Warrior was on the table but I cba with the fact I'll never be able to kill a Mage. Not being able to kill a class because of hard counters instead of being able to overcome it with skill is not an option for me. Maybe as an alt.
---
Someone explain pls why all reddit is going crazy about him?
---
We're trying to play vanilla wow, not vanilla wow + changes according to some person on reddit.
---
I leveled a combat rogue back in the day to level 40-something. I was like 13 then though, and could barely speak English - so is combat actually the spec to go with or is assassination/subtlety better? And more importantly, which of the specs is the most fun and engaging to play?
---
Thanks for the advice, out of interest why are Nelf hunters much more efficient than Dwarf hunters for PvE?
---
I personally found Darkshore to be SUUUUPER boring. I always left that zone and went to Loch Modan or Westfall. Honestly the biggest factor was the smoother transition between zones after that. You can jump straight into Wetlands and then Theramore, meanwhile Ironforge is right there. Getting into and around Darnassus felt like a pain in the ass.
---
IIRC you could do that as long as the new bag was larger than the old one.
---
Holy awesome! Thx 4 reply💋
---
Nice find, I didn't expect that.
---
I see some drama in the guild chat :P
---
Find out in game, it's an adventure.
---
The clip really doesn't explain anything.
---
We deserve what's coming to us for being such assholes in our teens haha
---
Just so you know, they can categorize reports. That way, they can easily filter out false reports. 
---
Sure, they probably still go trough them, but they can push them away until later.
---
Got WA working, and made a druid bar.
---
It's not a new animation. It's the same animation but played back at the correct speed. The vanilla engine clearly lacked the ability to speed up animations based on your movement speed, while the modern engine has this capability.
---
Og vanilla players have just waited a hell of a long time for this so you cant really blame them for wanting it to be as authentic as possible imo.
---
You're saying because of people? Because i've been to the major cities (ally side) and no drops.
---
Pretty sure this is the private server numbers.
---
Thanks for the feedback, I'm deliberating the potential that there will be too many rogues around thus making it difficult to get a raid spot vs. the seemingly more limited spaces hunters have in raid overall.
---
No I just thought it'd be nice to make the charge more like how it looked in vanilla.
---
Looks like Druid gear
---
**Short answer:** 
---
Because it wasn't in Vanilla WoW.
---
**Long answer:** 
---
The way the WoW Token system works could potentially have quite the negative impact on the in-game economy in Classic.      
---
To be able to buy a WoW Token with gold in the first place, someone else has to first buy a Token for real money that can then be sold of in-game for gold.  
---
You'd end up with a situation where people would be able to use their real life money to gain gold in-game. Gold is relatively hard to come by in Classic and individuals with loads of gold could easily corner whole markets on the auction house.
---
Classic isn’t like WotLK where all classes can fill all roles viably.  Some guilds will bring one Druid off tank, and bringing one can have some merit, but they’re objectively a worse choice than a Warrior tank.  
---
Most guilds will run with all warriors for their tanks.
---
Hunters have no dps issue in MC and BWL, they are as good as some classes like mages and warlocks. So guild could take more at start. The idea where you need 2 hunters in 40 man raids comes from the fact that in Naxx (and AQ in some extent) their dps was 50% lower at an equal level of skill because hunter dps doesnt scale well with gear and worldbuffs.
---
Keep in mind that most (like 95%) hunters were shit in vanilla, the dps difference between a good hunter and a crappy can be from 3 to 5 times more dps done.
---
So it's up to you, if you intend to play till AQ to make yourself a spot for the time where hunters slots will be reduced to 2 and prove you deserve a spot.
---
But should there not be armor on those?
---
Love how you get downvoted for saying the truth. What happened to this subreddit man
---
Maybe my memory is wrong but I don't remember the red trail behind a charge in vanilla. It seems a bit out of place in the classic setting. Does anyone know when this trail was added to WoW?
---
Classic is gonna be one big Boomer fest. Nice.
---
Crendor tried this yesterday and it didnt work because regen is too high. He'd be full hp before reaching the top again.
---
Generally speaking, &lt;APES&gt; steamers on twitch are private server veterans. The most famous is probably Monkeynews, who is moo_uk on twitch and plays a warrior. He is a very strong PVP player.
---
Here are a couple of things that may help iron out the question of whether dungeon elite mob damage:
---
First, in retail vanilla, not private servers, I used to tank these earlier dungeons on my warlock using searing pain and I never had any problems. Granted, I would have my void walker hold onto a couple of mobs, but I would have 2-3 mobs on myself at all times and I survived just fine in cloth.
---
Second, the beta only goes to level 30. That means all dungeons are being run with tanks in mail gear, so mitigation is going to be substantially lower than later when plate becomes available (along with better access to mitigation skills). Mob damage should be tuned to accommodate that. With that in mind, these early leveling dungeons are not a strong indicator of elite mob damage tuning as a whole.
---
As a side note, Verdan's obscene damage is exactly how I remember it. A rude awakening for a young me to be sure.
---
There's a megathread for a reason.
---
How do you know private servers are overtuned?
---
Factoring in physical mitigation from armor, as well as blocks, dodges, and parries, those values sound relatively correct. 250-300*0.6 (assuming around 40% physical mitigation) is 150-180 damage. Thats only about 600 damage every 4-5 seconds which isn't even half Tips health and that assumes every hit lands.
---
Perplexity already reported this bug first day.
---
Nope
---
If you're referring to the Charge in combat macro, that was actually made by a friend of his. Said friend got really mad when Swifty showed it off in Incredible Warrior Tricks because Blizzard swiftly patched it.
---
There is evidence that this is how it was back in the day and that Pserver content is way overtuned. 
---
I'm still conflicted though. I knew that Pservers beefed up their mobs, but the difference between Pserver and Classic Beta is colossal. Surely real Vanilla wasn't this damn easy?.. I mean watching Asmongold facetank 5-6 elites like it's nothing makes me cringe. On Pservers that's a certain death sentence and in Vanilla you couldn't do that either.
---
yeah. its about the lowering number of raid-willing people by the end of classic. 
---
when they announced tbc, it had a huge impact on many guild, dividing them in „i want to keep progress raiding right before tbc comes out“ vs „why keep progress raiding? tbc greens will be equal to clsssic endgame items“.
---
that screen is actually a short time before we merged two guilds (like a couple weeks/months before tbc releae.!) in order to keep naxx progression up. 
---
just went through my 10k vanilla screens yesterday and found a few regarding that guild merge.
---
So you want them to make dungeons harder than they were in vanilla because they look too easy when fully geared in blues?
---
All these people falling for the bait... good post
---
It's greatly exaggerated. If you're committed (farming pre-raid consumables consistently) and are skilled, you'll get priority over a rogue who's half-assing it (for lack of a better word). People need to remember that filling 40 mans wasn't exactly easy as well.
---
they did not show in raids but they should do in normal 5man content
---
Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely going one of the two as hunter and rogue are the two classes I enjoy most from a class fantasy point of view. The reason I'm struggling to decide so much is the fact that I never tried any of these classes until WotLK where by then they'd obviously changed vastly so I have no personal basis to make my decision from.
---
"I had 20 people helping me get WW Axe, world first!"
---
I’ve never seen this or heard of it. My first character was a warlock back in 2006 and I hated her imps name Quznam. 
---
He is still called Quznam.
---
Cos I haven't seen this like 15 times in the last 2 days already.
---
Should I ever get beta, I'm going to dust off my old Dell 4:3 screen laptop and get back to you in that.
---
Noted, thanks!
---
Zoomer's hate it
---
\+9 base agility. It's 18 rap at level 60 and 0.17 critical strike. Dwarf bonus to gun is irrevelant because hit chance isn't a issue for hunters and best ranged weapons are Xbow
---
HAXXX
---
\*crack\*
---
can't wait to spend a few days chain running SM armory and cathedral for all that red mail instead of hitting 60
---
\*sip\*
---
They're low level dungeons for and most people running them are really well geared for their level. What do you expect?
---
Nobbel87 has a lot of wow lore videos. I think he is the first one that comes up in youtuve if you type wow lore there anyway.
---
Very original thanks for posting!!!!
---
I'm planning on playing tauren. Will I level up in barrens?
---
Know the feeling. Currently playing Overwatch myself and even then it's like 'Gief BETA' Been looking into the shitfest of retail since I activated my sub for the chance in the BETA and doing the odd daily, just to make my account active in case it helps my chances.
---
perplexity really is doing gods work
---
PRAISE
---
Its tough because before the game comes out everyone is talking about how "they're going to play this class and this spec because its what was best in Naxx etc." But from what I've read in Vanilla a small percentage of the population cleared Naxx so why will it be much different this time. 
---
I'm not going have 18hrs a day to dedicate towards the game but I'll be playing it with all the free time I have so I can imagine I'll be able to keep up with the pack in terms of progression.
---
Oh look. Another one of these threads.
---
druid has only one as well but even Kevin Jordan admitted that math doesn't like druids.
---
Will there be in game battle.net chat features or will that be relegated to the launcher?
---
I dont remember being able to equip gear in combat in vanilla either
---
but you make it out like this secret thing..."the consumables", just what are they anyways? It seems super sketch that there's anything that would force a purge from a shaman anyways.
---
You're damn right, they don't make games like vanilla wow anymore
---
"sip"
---
This entertained me for around 10 consecutive watches. I can't wait for August!
---
Thank you for your constructive feedback.
---
This looks like normal mobs outside the dungeon in fairness? But damage still looks ways off too.
---
If this is true I suspect people will just be fighting mob higher than their level.
---
Not even socks. They cage my feet.
---
You can (and should!) run Gnomeregan on Horde side. When you pick up the quest in the engineering shop in Orgrimmar, there is a second quest that becomes available to speak to Chief Engineer Scooty in Booty Bay. When you speak to him, he will give you a Goblin Transponder which will allow you to use the teleporter next to him to instantly teleport to Gnomeregan.
---
On a pvp server I ambushed and killed a druid same level as me (20 or so) in one hit. I sat there numbly saying "uhhhhhhhh guys did anyone see that". 
---
They didn't. Female NE outside camp mojache I think it's called.
---
Yes they are utter garbage compared to warriors, just like prot paladins. And theres nothing you can do to change that.
---
what do you mean normal mobs they are elites.
---
b.net friend list is there
---
Oh wow, I was unaware the base agility scaled. I guess that does make quite a bit of difference, If I decide I wanna take the route of min-maxing everything I may look into playing a Nelf just not overly keen on the models. Thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
how long will beta last?
---
Hardcore vanilla but with a touch of the Wilderness in RuneScape. If you die, you drop all your gear and have to restart from the beginning but we'll let you keep a few pieces and your levels.
---
This on a NA or EU server?
---
Haha this made my day, thx op.
---
&gt; Streamers are pretty stupid people.
---
&gt; should of
---
No dude
---
I would like an Omar Gonzalez in-game pet. Imagine having a tiny Omar Gonzalez following you through Azeroth.
---
have you seen people do other dungeons on beta, its just as easy even if people have started to farm bis gear at lvl 30
---
Was 21 when vanilla was released and I nolifed it. Now I'm married, have two children, and a somewhat successful career. And I can't freaken wait to do it all over again in August.
---
My daughter will be coming 9 around release she's an absolute angel. My son on the other hand  will be coming 3 and we have nicknamed him the destroyer. Good times ahead.
---
Oof
---
Lame, can beat a bit of world boss PvP.
---
eu terrordar. 
---
it was released august 2005 if i remember correctly.
---
Awesome thanks.
---
Rogues and Warriors are top tier dps throughout all of Vanilla. 
---
The problem with Rogue and Warrior is that they're very difficult to gear up because there's so many of them.  As a hunter if you do manage to find a core raid spot then you'll be super geared because there's no competition for loot.
---
So what's the code like to make the RNG? I'm curious cus I wanna do the same.
---
I do indeed enjoy watching Nixxiom. I miss Ryan though
---
Magic Arena
---
Hydrohomie on the left reppin the lvl 55 water
---
What? If the mob is close you can’t shoot so you have to melee
---
I'm not sure if it's just because of the low population on the alpha, but there's an insane amount of chests everywhere. Rares often have a large patrol cycle but private servers tend to not bother scripting them since they get nuked down almost instantly after spawning. I'm not sure where to get a reliable source for either of these.
---
Staff of Celebras allows you to open a portal to the waterfall.
---
I figured they found a solution to that after the many betas they initiated.
---
I simply wanted to add some sensation and salz to the streamers for having all the beta keys and none of the gamer‘s mojo.
---
Tips should be out forever
---
The tauren in the top screenshot is absolutely and undeniably wearing [Vengeful Gladiator's Silk Amice](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/66265-vengeful-gladiators-silk-amice.jpg). Mage gear.
---
What are you talking about? Stoneform is THE best pvp racial in vanilla
---
I don’t think you can say anything like that while looking at a 160p image
---
So exactly the same.
---
I have been feeling this way for 4 months already, the time passes. Just hold on! Before we know it, it's 27th of August!
---
woah, you're talking about the guy who discovered the game breaking exploit "gloving hands trick". You better show some respect
---
When you look at the story, it seems like they recognized market potential but couldn't justify an investment because they couldn't be certain reconstructing the old world would be efficient enough.
---
Queue Omar and a small team figuring out a way.
---
Blizzard sees it's doable and decide to invest as the investment is now much safer.
---
What they do now depends primarily on the development team building the game.
---
I've also been reading John Staats WoW Diary. He points out pretty early that any public speculation of why a company does what it does is based on only public information. Thus, though logical conclusions are drawn, the public is always missing tons of info and are usually wrong.
---
So... Who knows?
---
&gt;I think it doesn't despawn at all
---
Thats what I want to hear
---
&gt;but becomes hostile after 5 minutes and can be enslaved.
---
I am pretty sure it should spawn hostile as well, but cant remember for sure
---
I know right? Watching this guy play Hunter and to think he's the most watched hunter rn makes me cringe.
---
"Tips is an Idiot" 
---
Have my upvote Sir.
---
Awesome! So much memories 😁👌
---
Yeah thats what im guessing too, unfortunately.
---
A "gamer" gets to play after work/school. A streamer gets to play during work. Which usually leads to more game time. 
---
Gamers, my self included, would not go trough so much content so quickly. 
---
It's also great advertisement.
---
Imagine if they keep layering for longer then launch and people just hop to another layer to avoid it
---
I am glad the majority of people said my friends need to man up. I was hoping for something similar and I am going to show these results to my friends as evidence that its reasonable to have a bit of time for yourself :D 
---
Cheers guys
---
The red trail has always been around
---
I, for one, began watching Jesse and Totalbiscuit (RIP) during Cata beta. Pretty sure I watched every single one of their videos at that time. I also remember watching Yoggscast when ICC came out.
---
Nice, another player from Terrordar :) Which guild where you in? I joined Seelensturm at the end of vanilla with my rogue (Palle) and raided with them for burning crusade.
---
I can, because I see it, it's crystal clear to me.
---
Will I be broke as a level 60 raiding prot warrior? Do I really need a farming alt?
---
You’re watching people that have played wow for years. I don’t know about you but I was able to do these dungeons when I was a retarded 11 year old. What did you expect?
---
Yes, a **3 mins** CD only usefull to beat rogues who are already an easy fight for a competent hunter versus a **10 seconds** shadowmeld CD which help you have the initiative and can interrupt cast. Yeah sure sure.
---
I suppose standing out as a good hunter is a lot easier than say warrior or rogue then due to the fewer numbers.
---
Yes, sprint with the +70% speed boost completely changed the animation outside of stealth. I'm 100% certain on that.
---
Omar, lead me to the blessed land.
---
Yep! Mulgore links to the Barrens from the opposite side to Durotar.
---
&gt; I’m poor so I don’t have gold
---
Going for that Classic authenticity IRL I see
---
undead female rogue („roguée“).
---
tempt fate, merged into unified right before tbc. 
---
:)
---
Makes sense if he is BFA player, in BFA instead of defense you have a defensive stance of the pet behavior that requires you to get attacked for pat to automatically engage the target.
---
Lol yes, YES!
---
xD
---
Why dont you give retail wow a go first.
---
Ok and how do we know this? Is there a video or sth?
---
Because they all officially state they make it harder, and on top of that they all guess the numbers to begin with.
---
Strat has one aswell 😊
---
Streamers should just get their own names realms so they can leave us alone
---
I mean asmongold literally never uses shield block either.
---
Lmao these streamers.
---
I wasn't broke with my Tier 3 armored warrior and I didn't get a farming alt. However the raid gold certainly did not pay the bill, so doing something that paid between raids was necessary.
---
It makes sense that they would attempt to stay nearly up-to-date with the current client.
---
That's what's fun about it. Just gridning over and over again so you can be OP for those few beautiful levels.
---
Why don’t you level a character and learn how to play it.
---
I feel you, I'm in the same boat. I look at it from the bright side tho, now that I can't enjoy games I can get some exercises done and care for my body, before all I do is carry my body from workdesk to gamingdesk again.
---
I've seen a lot of people preach about Stoneform in Vanilla but because I'm not much into PvP this has never swayed my opinion either way. Does Shadowmeld drop aggro out of interest because I feel that would be quite useful in PvE content if it did.
---
You are not alone my friend. I think many people have been going through a cycle something like:
---
\- Play private / retail / other game
---
\- Get bored because it holds no draw because classic is coming out
---
\- Check reddit classic board for more news
---
\- Check [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) to see if by the grace of the gods you have been given a key
---
\- Speak to your squad you plan to play classic with and organise whats going on for the 27th
---
\- Check reddit classic board again for more news
---
\- Watch streamers stream the beta well feeling a bit sad
---
\- Decide to start the list over again by playing private / retail / other game.
---
Rinse repeat
---
I suspect it will be this way for a few people until a bigger roll out of the beta keys happen and until the game is released proper. We just have to stay positive!
---
&lt;APES&gt; also had slave GM's on private servers spawn world bosses for them and the majority brought gold and used fish bots so ye, veterans
---
I'm sure you're right, bud. I was basing my comment off of a Nixxiom video where he goes back to BfA and runs through a few dungeons. Pretty much what I said in my comment is what happened to him when he tried to talk during a random dungeon run.
---
One of my noob moments back in November 06 (started playing in early October 06) when my friend helped me do the felhunter quest. I was a human warlock and I had to go through the barrens. My friend being a level 46ish gnome mage and having been around kalimdor a bit more told me we would have to force our way through the barrens/ashenvale border gate. So there we are, 2 complete noobs not knowing of the ratchet/booty bay boat route, fighting for our lives against orc guards. Man, if any high level horde players saw us that day I sure hope they laughed.

To my knowledge, nobody in the Beta actually attempted to figure this out yet as it would require random world drop blues to properly test it.
---
If you have a source from the Beta, and not just a link stating intentions that would be great.
---
Thats not uldaman
---
The difference is incredibly small. Play what you want.
---
I never played retail vanilla and have only played it on private servers. Thought dungeon balancing would be  closer to how it is on private servers. I dont care about nostaligia and #nochanges I just want a good game. Its a 15 year old game that is pretty much min maxed we also have 1.12 talents and itemization so all content is even easier. Dungeons and other group content is just way more enjoyable when you actually need to use cc, communicate, manage aggro compared to the faceroll pve that we will get in classic.
---
ur not gonna learn anything with insta 60
---
This brings back so many memories.
---
Combat is the easier spec to level with because of the amount of swords you can find and you don't have to worry about needing to be behind an enemy for backstab. Combat is also the go to spec for raiding (people can tell you for how long because I'm not 100% sure)
---
I personally loved CB/Prep dagger build at 60 but I also loved to PVP so it was an  okay raid spec but super fun for pvp.
---
&gt; Its tough because before the game comes out everyone is talking about how "they're going to play this class and this spec because its what was best in Naxx etc.
---
This is the wrong mentality to have honestly. In terms of specs I can see that being true but with regards to classes? The raid comp still needs to be balanced and hunters offer a lot of utility (this importance cannot be overlooked). DPS matters, sure. The beauty of classic is that classes have certain niches that have to be utilized in a raid environment.
---
Guilds will typically take 6-7 rogues and 2-3 hunters on average. With the former you'll also have more competition for gear (just something to keep in mind). 
---
&gt; But from what I've read in Vanilla a small percentage of the population cleared Naxx so why will it be much different this time. 
---
With the amount of resources available today I can't see this being the case again. You also have to factor in Vanilla will be a stand-alone product with no future patches/expansions. There will be no rush to clear Naxx before it becomes irrelevant in that case.
---
That was my first epic drop as well. Iirc I got somewhere around 45g for it.
---
If you thought mana downtime was bad, just wait till you see the CD downtime rogues have. Rogues are actually quite useless in BGs. There's a reason why premades take only 1 rogue to defend the flag.
---
Yeah oh I remember the good old days, my first character back in 05 was a NE Hunter I mained until 110. So stoked for classic
---
No in PvE it could allow you to skip mobs and patrols to solo a dungeon (like Dire Maul North or BlackRock depths) and wait for the feign death CD.
---
Not only that one, I mean obviously I can't be sure who made them originally or if he took the ideas from someone, but if so he analysed someone's play and put it into his own arsenal...I'd call that playing smart.
---
That being said I havnt seen him do anything remotely impressive in years
---
U get 1 large briliant shard per blue DE. So say the item vendors for 2g but the shards are worth 4g each on the ah, then u’d most likely DE the item.
---
yeah im actually doing the same kinda. trying to do more rl stuff
---
Yeah it wasn't even that bad trying to find people, I would /who the zone of the instance and if I had no luck I would /who the level bracket of the dungeon. It never took hours and hours
---
Nah, I wouldn't worry about it at all. There are going to be a LOT of people who are either in the same boat as you or completely new. 
---
Many people are going to be surprised with not being able to zerg dungeons and whatnot. Just have fun with it man.
---
I know, as I said above I've been rogue since Vanilla. Cooldowns are huge and that's why prep is so powerful.
---
I'm guilty of it too. Unfortunately the way the current post LFD game is designed no longer necessitates social interaction in the way pre LFD did and subsequently disincentivises positive social interaction in the way it used to.
---
this is exactly what ive been doing for so long mate
---
Immediately thought of this video. Really interesting
---
has there been another one? if yes i missed them.
---
What's the CB/Prep dagger build? 31 points in combat and halfway into one of the other talent trees I presume?
---
As a 34 year old boomer who is literally drinking a Monster Zero Ultra as I type this, all I have to say is:
---
Nice.
---
Don't worry you will have time to figure it all out by the time you get to lvl 60 :)
---
It's at least 200h hours of game time to get there so enjoy the journey 👌
---
Since you have access to lvl 60 right now I think you should focus of finding the right class for your, but looks like Paladin or Druid will do.
---
And yes Paladin is lock alliance and Shaman is lock hord.
---
I remember when a friend of mine who played a nelf priest told me that priests could mindcontrol. I honestly started leveling a priest alt purely for that.
---
This is just so damn cool! Thanks for the share! 
---
I would really like to explore the undermine.....
---
It was in vanilla
---
Nice.  I've got the second edition. The rear pages have a useful glossary of all rare spawns in each zone with their approximate spawn timer.
---
Try removing it from auto download in the battle.net settings

---
At the very least you could grind gold for wow tokens to pay your sub in advance for classic release since you have a retail sub active just sitting there. That's what I'm doing with it anyway lol
---
Then play on the private servers, not on classic. Also this is fucking SM Cemetery, this dungeon ALWAYS was piss easy.
---
As a raiding prot warrior you usually get supported by your guild.
---
He also say "I dont remember" multiple times throughout the video. Not sure what you are trying to prove here?
---
Do you have actual data from the Beta where someone confirmed it either proccing or not proccing effects? I have been trying to confirm how SoR works for the past few days, but it has been exceedingly difficult due to how you need to get a weapon with a on hit proc to actually check it. Those are not easy to obtain.
---
If I am wrong I am wrong. Thats how it is right? But you coming into this thread after 3 frigging months, offering absolutely no evidence, just to tell me I was wrong based on some vague twitch clip? I dont know man. Doesnt seem healthy to be this obsessed if you know what I mean.
---
This diagram need to be normalized by the amount of xp you get from quests and monsters of relevant levels.
---
The simple fact that I managed to complete the dungeons at all back then, when I was basically the WoW equivalent of a baby learning to crawl, makes me realize how incredibly easy the content must have been. Even back then wipes would only really happen by pulling too much.
---
That's because right after Naxx (6 months iirc) TBC came out and 3 months after Naxx they were already introducing TBC.
---
It wasn't around in vanilla and TBC (when I played) at least not the way it is now.
---
Me on my way to 7/11 to buy a Monster Zero Ultra [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjrCRyZVTE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjrCRyZVTE8)
---
Didn't the hunter dps also take a dive due to the fact that hunter pets back then took more damage then they do in retail, and thus died a lot quicker?
---
Hi, /u/profHam
---
that aoe fear won them
---
Does not work on Beta.
---
do you want it to be piss easy and why?

How dare you misspell terrodar! :)

---
People still like they guy who corrects grammar, right?
---
Shaman was my main in Wrath, going priest to start Vanilla, but excited to play a Shammy as well
---
Hi, /u/LFMFAILS
---
I really thought about this...
---
Who?
---
Nobody knows but the [announcement](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) mentions that a stress test will be held on the July, 18th. So at least until then.
---
I'm honestly surprised by your answer, I don't think you represent the average WoW player if you had such a smooth experience.
---
&gt; I see this stated a lot, it's like people think we didn't have broadband or the internet 
---
Many people-like me- had trash internet back then, that's definitely true.
---
&gt; There was tonnes of information online when vanilla was live 
---
Not even a fraction of what exists know though. I didn't know about keybinds' existence -again, like great many players- until TBC, because all the vids I watched were at most in 240p and you couldn't even guess that these keybinds existed.
---
&gt; internet speeds were already fairly decent 
---
I was downloading stuff at a speed of 110 kbps, that I can remember, and I definitely knew people who had it worst than me, it was far from uncommon.
---
&gt;   latency has not changed dramatically in the last 15 years 
---
Well, it was very common outside of the US to have trash latency as many Europeans/Asians/Oceanians (?) played on servers far away from home, as Blizz did not host anything locally.
---
&gt;  Before nax was out Youtube was up and running and you would see people posting boss videos on youtube 
---
Aren't you mixing up time periods ? Youtube wasn't even a thing back in Vanilla times, it was Google Videos/WCM. Also top guilds didn't share their secret research about Boss Mechanics with everybody either as you seem to claim.
---
i know, thats why I said it only confused me.
---
Okay, I told it not to auto update and uninstalled what was already there. It looks like it's working. Thanks!
---
I'm pretty sure it is not an alliance thing. I think most American calls Deadmines for VC, whereas DM is EU. I had never heard anyone call Deadmines for VC before I played on private servers. I'm from EU and I play alliance
---
arent retail and vanilla completly different in most cases, wouldnt it be better to play on vanilla private server?
---
Not when they correct grammar that was fine in the first place.
---
i will on LH, but cant you answer these questions? will also help me pick a class.
---
I feel bad for y'all. The wifey~ and kids will be joining me in my le epic adventure through azeroth, it's going to be a grand ol time of epic gaming hours 👌👌
---
According to every pool I've seen, there will be WAY more rogues. Hunter is almost always the second last played class (druid is least).
---
`LF1M PRIEST UBRS CAN SUMMON`
---
 this hit me so perfectly
---
Then ask Ion Hazzikostas, Travis Day and a bunch of former EJ members...
---
Do Paladins and Druids have the buff skills, I thought i should be going for a Priest.
---
thats not how you spell it :D
---

---
about your lock: i think i saw your name going through my screenshots yesterday.
---
Is Reddit the place to report bugs now ?
---
That footage is from an event where they played the beta before it was released. Maybe that explains it
---
Delete the BFA client and select your SSD while installing Classic. I think you can also select a default installation location in the settings.
---
1. Yes pally is alliance and shaman is horde. I dont think you can group together even on pve server.
---
2. Not sure look up BiS (best in slot) videos
---
3.yes you can play support, pally and druid are good for that.
---
4.solo is faster and a mix of both. Want to level the quickest? Kill everything along the way to your quest.
---
5. I dont remember. 
---
6. You can reset talents but its expensive. Going up to 20 or 30g I think if you do it to often. Best  to look up talent calculators online so you can make the build you want before hand
---
Enjoy playing!
---
There was a very subtle trail but nothing like how it is now, you can go back to classic movies to see the difference.
---
Alliance and horde are enemies so they cant play with eachother. You need to make sure you and your friends are on the same server and faction. 
---
It sounds that you wanna play either shaman (horde) or paladin(alliance)
---
Best way of levling is just doing quest. Group with ppl makes it more fun and easier. Do dungeons when you get quests to them.
---
You can reset your talents, it costs gold. 
---
You seem very worried about min maxing. Relax and enjoy the ride. I promise that you wont paint yourself into a corner. I was completly clueless and didnt google anything back in vanilla.
---
But https://classic.wowhead.com/ has some good info and guides for you.
---
Did not in vanilla.
---
But is it a bug? Or it works as intended?
---
No self respecting boomer would have that on their phone.
---
The point here is you dont know. Hey, we dont really know either but our position is at least supposed by circumstancial evidence like patch notes etc.
---
Unless you have actual evidence from the Beta itself, coming into this thread after 3 months just to repeat the same things you already said last time isnt contributing, and is instead making you look rather stubbord and childish.
---
God, it's going to be great to have a Boomers Only official WoW server.
---
They show in party not raids
---
UC is literally a goddamn circle I dunno how people get confused in there. It's split into 4 quarters with most trade stuff within the center ring, It's like the easiest place to navigate. Thunder Bluff however is the superior capital, super chill and when they added in the AH there it was basically right next to the bank.
---
Depends on how good your raid is. Less wipes is less gold loss. Dungeon running definitely always gave me net gold. And the fact that you can basically instantly get a dungeon going, and pretty much carry a dungeon with good tanking skills, gave good opportunities for gold gain.
---
The results are the same if you generate it once instead of 500000. They're *random*.
---
*Millenials
---
I think you are misreading.  
---
I fully acknowledge that you say stratholme elites do 250-300dmg, this is why I had to state that I am assuming the classicdb values are correct.  
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10413](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10413) Stratholme mob listed for 900dmg
---
This may not be the case. I have no clue, I don't remember values from 2004-2005 when I was levelling my characters but I remember that elites were tough shit, and it seems weird that in the classic beta they are just plowing through multiple elites like no problem.
---
Yes
---
I think it was discussion. They don't have access to the same reporting system I imagine?
---
Thank you!
---
Don't know but I expect until release to keep reporting and fixing bugs.
---
Since you are back here after 3 months I assume you have concrete evidence from the actual Beta to support your position?
---
Sorry. But you wrong. If you can count the quantity it's "fewer" ... If you cannot, it's "less."
---
The more you know!!
---
(This obviously very prescriptivist language and formal usage... But I'll be damned if I make a grammar joke then get called out for it with wrong information lol)

[Minor] Jumping underwater
---
Currently you just swim up if you hit spacebar, but you're supposed to be jumping when you hit spacebar underwater.
---
Proof - https://youtu.be/OKdWeGeYS0k?t=294
---
Video from 2006 where it shows the Night Elf jumping while underwater
---
Can't wait to hate this place again !
---
Any Shaman streamers?
---
Have Blizzard given official PC spec requirements yet?
---
Looks how it was to me, I think the videos are just too low res to see it properly.  Maybe it is a a bit brighter?
---
Which is a weird way to spell murloc.
---
The last expansion I bought was Cata. If I resub to thag and do not own BFA will I be able to play classic?
---
With some practice and competent healer/dispeller and buffer, you can make your pet survive most fight. I only recall having issue with Ragnaros and Vaelastraz, other bosses have aoe which can be timed.
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Boomer? Weren't most millennials?
---
34 years old [makes you a millenial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#Date_and_age_range_definitions).
---
The beautiful part is that the items you get actually lasts for a longer while. It doesn't get replaced the next level, it can last you an additional 5 - 6 levels, and some items even last you to max level.
---
Some lower level items are even BiS at level 60.
---
Watching that paladin play was painful
---
225 should require lvl. 35, and i assume this is implemented on the beta as well.
---
I think you are the cancer
---
I HAVE been waiting for this moment since TBC.
---
Not sure people we're expecting it since Classic is based on a 7.x client and not 8.1. Sucks but can't complain too much.
---
You see almost a thing red flag behind the current charge. You could hardly see anything in old movies. If you find something that looks similar to the beta animation from 15 years ago I'd love to see it.
---
Nice
---
Ganking as an undead rogue such a challenge /s.

What next? Your going to gloat about getting kills as an ud Frost mage

Streamers!? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Where have they stated that they make it harder?
---
Not a bad idea, just takes so long on EU.
---
We don’t deserve him
---
His grammar is actually fine.
---
Indeed, as should 150-225 to be lvl 20, but in retail it didnt. Thats why i ask :)
---
I only really drink the original Monster, the green one. I did like an orange one at some point, called "Khaos" but that one seems gone around my area.
---
What is it with Zero Ultra you like? I haven't tasted it yet, but everyone seems to love that one a whole lot more.
---
Do you mean a guild from your own faction wiped you? So there was a civil war in your own faction?
---
Or just an opponent faction?
---
you don't need anything for classic, just wow sub without any wow expansion
---
Does boomer have an alternate classic wow meaning? Because 34 is nowhere near a boomer in a demographic sense. Boomers are in their 60s and 70s now.
---
It could be something to do over time, no hurry. :)
---
When that information starts to become better.
---
I'm gonna play on a RP PVE Server, and the population tends to be smaller, so the chances of finding chests and rares is higher. :D
---
Whoever is ahead and reaches maps first are going to have a party with all the chests and rare spawns.
---
You dont have any ammo for wands, how can you benefit from quivers/ammo pouches +%attackspeed?
---
Thats the way i saw it in vanilla and how i look at it now. I dont know if it ever worked
---
Orc Shaman is the right choice.
---
I can’t help but think of the future when/if classic is a success and they setup an alternate timeline. Man, that would be something
---
You hit the nail on the head: WoW became Diablo skinned as Warcraft.
---
judging by how beta looks group content in classic will be extremely easy. Elites barely do any damage at all sadly.
---
Jewel of the Nile.
---
did you have a bad day? what happened?
---
Tbh the more strange thing about that clip is how he's holding agro. Like, he gets a sunder in eventually but he never hits the mob while getting a bunch of healing (from people I'm guessing don't have threat reduce talents) yet it's sticking to him fine. Literally the only thing he did for the first 15 seconds that could potentially generate threat was a Battle Rage.
---
A „gamer“ is somebody playing videogames.
---
Then how can you expect SM GY mobs to do 250-300 damage? You say that makes sense, but it absolutely does not.
---
Vanilla was tough, in large part due to people being absolute garbage at the game, but SM GY mobs were never doing 250-300 damage, it just simply is not the case.
---
Due to how computers now a day are built, they are really good at doing multithreaded work, games that is very heavy on a single thread will perform very badly.
---
Just look at OSRS, it looks like any computer in the world can use it, but in reality, a lot of people actually has a problem running it.
---
Unplayable lag and suicide for melee
---
&gt;I'm looking for a good PvP class with fun gameplay that is fairly hard to play. 
---
durid if u  want it hard
---
Something something #NoChanges. 
---
Something something Slippery Slope.
---
Something something Authentic Experience. 
---
It's about what you'll get out of that debate. People have tried to discuss all sorts of changes, tweaks and retuning for content, classes and more ever since Classic was first announced to become a thing. 
---
It never ended well. The one time the blues tried to spark up discussion, they had to lock the thread later because things got out of hand. 
---
Regardless, they got the message: #NoChanges. And thus, Classic is made for this crowd now, all the way to the most minute of details. Love it, hate it, it is what it is.
---
that is the meme lad
---
As a twinked tank, it looks alright.
---
33.3% chance of accuracy. Repeating, of course.
---
That’s a good point. It’s been over a decade. Pretty insane
---
Now THIS brings me back.
---
Haha pretty accurate list dude. 
---
I can confirm that's how it is for me daily 👍
---
What happened to
---
&gt;omg private servers are just estimate, classic will be way harder
---
I love how everyone just assumed that because private servers are inaccurate, that classic will somehow be harder in every aspect.
---
Not talking about the baby boomers. Google Boomer meme.
---
ok?
---
Kind of off topic, but you seem like someone that has to do presentations often. How did you do this if you don’t mind me asking. I want to incorporate it into my job.
---
I can't wait
---
0 calories is a godsend when it comes to soft/energy drinks
---
I also dont want to spam trade chat for hours.
---
Yeah, but It ain't ganna kill an ele shaman with mail and a shield. And its a significantly lesser threat to me than if you were to be the unstoppable healbot you could be if these ret paladins rolled holy.
---
I’m playing a different xpac on a private server. Does enough to scratch the itch.
---
You have a lot of questions that will get answered by just playing. You also have 3 months to slowly learn these things, you dont need to know these things now, especially since the answers are a little nuanced. 
---
1. Yes. Also cant play with eachother in raids.
---
2. Too nuanced, just read around. You can look into BiS lists to get an idea of what is generally considered important stats. These lists are subjective and have plenty of alternate gear choices. BiS are also specialization dependent. For example, google "holy paladin phase 1 bis".
---
3. Shaman or pally are both big supporters. Look into totems for shaman and blessings (I think, Im always horde) for paladins to get an idea.
---
4. All classes have specs that are more suited for leveling. Your character will play differently at 60 vs 1-59 because of the talents you choose for end game vs leveling. 
---
5. Situational and nuanced. High dodge against an arms warrior in pvp would be bad. 
---
6. Youll fuckup, its an in game gold cost to reset talent points. It's not the end of the world if your "misuse" a point while leveling. The gold cost goes up every time you respec, capping at i think 50G, which depending on the person is nothing to sneeze at. **Don't bother reseting talent points until 60, in my opinion.**
---
level 32 elite doing 250-300 dmg if a level 58 elite does 900dmg?  
---
How does that NOT make sense to you? seems like a reasonable scaling.
---
yes
---
there are lots of bad hunters out there
---
Someone clearly doesn't know the [Boomer](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer) Meme
---
And it was awesome. Being able to talk shit to a character you see often in the other faction was amazing. Community is what I’m looking for in classic wow
---
It’s for sure the same trail, you just can’t see it properly in the old videos because they’re low quality and zoomed out.
---
Just a pserver thing
---
&gt; dwarf 
---
&gt; wrong race to pvp
---
how dare you
---
I missed it, what did tips do?
---
If it would be normal than level 55 mob would hit level 55 warrior for 30?
---
I watched some dungeon runs and pulling 6 elites casually every time without anybody dying was not possible.
---
Somebody should create level 13-14 warrior try to solo RFC mobs. I am pretty sure it was impossible to kill that stone elemental because I tried to solo RFC back then.
---
It’s pretty good for druids. But if you aren’t in a ‘hardcore’ guild. You are gonna find it very hard to get into naxx and get splinters.
---
Yep. They are meant to 1-hit crit you, 2/3 shot you dead on white damage.
---
So my theory that 1-60 is 100% of the required exp to make it endgame wasn't so bat shit crazy. Take that theory crafters.
---
but we get 1.12 talents and itemization and we have an insane amount of information compared to retail vanilla so by buffing elite mobs we would probably get closer to an "Authentic Experience"
---
Druids and rogues are a lot of fun. Druids level a lot faster. Rogues are better dps in the end.
---
What a dumb reply. Expand on your nope or stay quiet.
---
you can absolutely ignore that difference
---
Yes! I'm in the gym 5-6 days a week for at least an hour and a half, starting a weight cut and getting my finances in order. I want to be fit(ter), economically stable and ready for a fight come August 27th so I don't have to do this shit in the fall.
---
&gt; I'm afraid that me playing classic again will kill the nostalgia i have.
---
Exactly this, I'm on the same boat.
---
I am super excited for Classic but I'm afraid this will happen and also it won't be that great with my very limited schedule and all the people min-maxing.
---
Hope we're wrong.
---
initial aggro + he loses aggro after 10 seconds after getting a bunch of heals and has to taunt. He has a lot of healers there so as long as one doesnt overdo it it's fine
---
I really hope they don’t implement LFG. Community is what people loved about classic wow. I would love to see that in the game.
---
It's a [Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer)
---
If you are in a hardcore guild, is the best person of your class and play 60 hours a week and somehow convince 39 other people you should get it...
---
Even then you might not get it.
---
Is this some meme format I don't understand?
---
one thing u may care for is that hunters can pvp pretty well with the pve spec
---
rogues not as well
---
At launch it was called Terrodar and then got renamed later. No idea how they managed to miss a typo in a realm name.
---
Well, you seem to be more out of touch with the point being made here.
---
Content creators are content creators. They are entertaining and get accross the excitement about minor/major features.
---
However, people like joana, madseason, monkeynews etc etc, bring much more knowledge about some details to the table. 
---
TL:DR if you want to promote your stuff you chose an entertainer, if you want to find flaws you chose min maxers. Both have their place in this.
---
He would have used the rand function inside Matlab, the link above isn't to the software that he used to generate the figures, it's simply the software he used to map the graph.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BObxNsbRWsc
---
Here is a video of Joana lvling up in actual Vanilla. At 1h 52 min you he is fighting a lvl 30 elite mob. Hitting his pet for about 100.
---
In the Beta SM:GY video we can see the lvl 30 elite mobs hitting Tipsout for about 50 dmg.
---
Hmm not evidence but something could be off in the beta.
---
We want these screenshots of yours!!
---
How about in classic everyone has the option lets say for example can go to any banker and be able to give x amount of gold for playtime and or sub, this x amount of gold could maybe rise and fall dependant on how much gold is circulating within each realm or region.... Or make it to where in classic if i buy game time, the game time dosnt keep ticking when i log off :)
---
Lol nope.
---
My joke was bad. But the grammar is correct.
---
Damn, that sounds pretty useful!
---
Ebbnflow druid content creator has beta access, you can ask him
---
Can we put the game in 144 and 240hz ? 
---
And do you know if hunter’s deadzone is the same as on private servers ?
---
I see, thank you.
---
Klathnak was my big blue friend ❤
---
I hope I get him back when I roll a new lock on classic with the same name.
---
lol wtf. thats why i fucked up the name like 10years ago. i remember being in multiple arguments about the servers name and i felt like always being right, but still losing the argument. 
---
i guess now i know why.
---
Thank you Omar.
---
This is the hardest part to communicate to people. Just importing all the database tables with all the numbers from the 1.12 version will not guarantee the game behaves the same way.
---
The code that interpret the data is a lot more similar to Legion/BfA than it is to Vanilla wow, meaning its likely to be differences in the expected result.
---
They made it easy for streamers to hype the game up, no one wants to see streamers die, it's bad for advertising...
---
I don't think you understand how important gear is. Having BiS gear at low level is insane. There's a reason why people avoid battlegrounds because of twinks. You literally have zero chance.
---
"Oops I'm retarded better delete my account" - that guy
---
Hope something is off in the beta but tbh I think its accurate
---
* Finish work at 2pm launch day.
---
* Sleep until launch time.
---
* Game into morning.
---
* Go to work. Finish at 2pm.
---
* Play until 8pm then go to bed.
---
My battle-plan is ready. Is yours?
---
na
---
I was watching the streams of Asmongold and Sodapoppin and my biggest reaction was "Wow, those mobs are not tuned as vanilla was" then I came here and saw your posts. I rarely see streamers missing weapon hits. Both white/yellows. Mobs rarely resist spells(from what I've seen) and mobs do far less damage. I hope the tune them up and make people miss spells/hits.
---
Yea... He's pretty bad
---
Fine, what your asking for is just like when you couldn’t get into a Wotlk raid because you couldn’t link said achievement. 
---
Now for me I cleared half of naxx in vanilla, so my account would be fine. But you would end up with elitists only wanting people who had played classic in their guilds leaving a majority of players with a bad taste in their mouths. 
---
Also it would expose all the lies people have been telling over the course of their WoW history about how they once killed said boss. Now sure we can go on Warcraft realms and look up said person IF they claimed their characters back then but I have feeling they won’t actually have them. Hell look at these streamers who were dire hard classic fans and loved it and clearly they never even played it and if they did they sure as shit didn’t play enough to know the game well.
---
raids need lots of dimes
---
which ones? due to the massive amount, you have to be more precise. 
---
at least 50% are really boring to everyone but me.
---
IIRC this was basically the build I used back then:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fueboxzZGcZVMecc0o
---
Those questions are much more rediculous than his
---
No thunderfury ? Meh
---
so do we need active sub even for stress test?
---
And instead of playing on servers with salve GMs they went for playing classic, so, what's wrong?
---
Idk, I remember it being pretty easy with a group back then too. Sure we died a bit from not know how things work, but with the knowledge players have now of classes/skills Itd only make sense that things are a bit easier.
---
they dont have bis gear. Twinks have enchants
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OPT96AX6Rs
---
I think this would be a cool feature. They track all this data on every character made anyway, so being able to pull up facts would be fun to go through.
---
Can't look into his mind, but maybe he realises how lucky he is with the position he has. From the ClassiCast interviews with Mark Kern, Blizzard seemed and still seems like a great environment to work in compared to most other gaming studios. He could retire or work somewhere else, but if your work is fun, then you wouldn't have to do the former, and the latter is risky if there's the chance you land on a new ship with a bad crew.
---
No carbs.  Us boomers gotta think about our health.
---
But Stratholme elites AREN'T doing 900 damage, they're doing 250-300. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZZgVSOwBwc&amp;t=613s
---
Zoomer get out.
---
Sounds toxic and anti-gamer af
---
i can see why some people might find this info interesting and want access to it, but personally i don't think i would use/look at it much (if at all). not a bad idea though, if a lot of people wanna know this type of info.
---
Are you reading what I am saying?
---
ASSUMING ClassicDB values.
---
Good job investigating. Something felt off about warrior charge as I was watching beta streams and I couldn’t put a finger on it. 
---
I hope someone reported it thru proper beta channel
---
Lol I spent many a day in here soloing this place to farming gold for my mount. This is classic how it was
---
The code is really simple [https://pastebin.com/8imhzUL5](https://pastebin.com/8imhzUL5)
---
output is in out matrix that I copied to excel to match with names
---
what i saw dropping during my classic life:
---
1x thunderfury
---
1x sulfuros eye
---
1x ashbringer (during tbd tbh)
---
owing an atiesh (got that during tbc) and one val‘anyr which i farmed myself with pug raids. 
---
legendaries really are rare.
---
My boyfriend and I met on WoW. Two kids here and I'm pregnant with the third, due on Halloween. Hyped up and ready to play some but I know we won't be able to dedicate any serious time to the game for quite some time. However, it's great knowing that it'll still be there when we are ready so our excitement hasn't gone away at all.
---
&gt;Not even a fraction of what exists know though. I didn't know about keybinds' existence -again, like great many players- until TBC, because all the vids I watched were at most in 240p and you couldn't even guess that these keybinds existed.
---
I don't know what you mean by this.
---
&gt; Aren't you mixing up time periods ? Youtube wasn't even a thing back in Vanilla times, it was Google Videos/WCM. Also top guilds didn't share their secret research about Boss Mechanics with everybody either as you seem to claim.
---
No, youtube was launched 6 months after vanilla wow. It was absolutely a thing in vanilla times. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube
---
It gained popularity instantly, within a year of Vanilla wow's release youtube was already getting 8 million visitors daily. We had raid videos etc up on youtube since i remember, but I only started when Nax was being released. 
---
This idea that vanilla players were just blindly going in to boss fights or had no information is unfounded yet repeated constantly. We had youtube and we had wealth's of information - it doesn't matter if you have 10 sites or 100 sites telling you exactly the same thing, the point is it's easily accessible and correct. We had thottbot for quest information, we had addins for questing, threat, dps etc etc, and we had information + videos on boss mechanics and damage. 
---
No, top guilds didn't when they were trying to down the boss, but for 99.9% of the raiding population, that didn't matter as you weren't competing with DAT or Nihilium, by the time your guild got to the boss, there were guides and videos for you to look up. 
---
&gt;Well, it was very common outside of the US to have trash latency as many Europeans/Asians/Oceanians (?) played on servers far away from home, as Blizz did not host anything locally.
---
&gt;I was downloading stuff at a speed of 110 kbps, that I can remember, and I definitely knew people who had it worst than me, it was far from uncommon.
---
Maybe you were, most good players weren't. You aren't going to be able to stay alive, generate threat, heal quickly enough or do competetive dps if you had 200 ms latency. Most good raiders would have had decent connections. And again, download speed does not equal latency, the two things are distinct.
---
It was actually my first character ever
---
Does it need it?
---
And it's better this way, it was sarcasm :p
---
The Dwarven zones are really fun. I certainly enjoyed running around in the mountains more than farmland. Ironforge also just feels more convenient than Stormwind.
---
Good times, my guild wasn't very adept at raiding so a lot more time was spent outside the instances killing people trying to summon their friends until their entire raid group came out for revenge and it was just a slaughter. 
---
Hoping for very even servers population wise.
---
How can you be sure sm mobs never did 250-300 damage? Do you have any proof of that? You might be wrong as well as all private servers advocates. It is a beta in the end of it all so we can expect bugs.
---
They're 30 yr old boomers.
---
Yeah, kinda, but I wanted to know what it would look like after more number of iterations
---
Well they did have to mess up a lot of stuff to get Vanilla into the BFA frame not really that hard to imagine some major bugs going unnoticed. 
---
Who the hell knows anymore though. Been playing pservers for over twice as long as Vanilla was out :S
---
Yeah,  was the same faction - we already had a huge rivalry with them and the server knew we we’re competing for server firsts, so when they fucked us on the encounter the whole conflict inflamed and the Alliance was divided in 2 camps for quite some time
---
I was thinking of rolling pally but checking the talent tree they didn't have crusader strike yet. I have great memories from vanilla but damn Everytime I look into a class a couple skills that made wow more fun for me didn't become real until BC. Another is rogue and missing mutilate and cloak of shadows skills that didn't become real until BC
---
Paladin does what you want it to. But you have to learn how to play.
---
He won a cloak that Sodapoppin needed in WC and deleted it.
---
Initial aggro doesn't matter at all unless you actually generate threat though. In any normal scenario if you pull a group and the healer heals before anyone touches the mobs they're gonna go straight for the healer.
---
(Also, he doesn't taunt, he lands a sunder. Which is why he's holding threat even after the nova goes away.)
---
oh ok then, I guess I will have to find some alternatives..
---
Fully agree. I feel like people are just imagining things.
---
LFD and flying removes this fun.
---
Holy shit and once was enough for me haha
---
One of that rogue fella will do!! Love that kind of shit! World is such a big place. What are the odds...
---
It was! Especially for an RP server haha
---
Not sending the pet in while being the most followed hunter streamer player, classic is gona be doomed by braindead millenial kids following those braindead streamers who are trash
---
Additionally, if you resub you can play up to Legion
---
Wow, I actually never knew that. I barely got to the 20s on a Horde character.
---
&gt; I'm seeing so many comments "This is not right as I played on X private server and it wasn't like this" 
---
Alright, link me atleast two comments of that kind please because I haven't seen any of those and Ive been here for a year or so now.
---
No because it's closer to what you feel is more authentic, not what it was. It won't be piss easy and still require work  after all they've only tested up to level 30 dungeons, we'll see about the others but that's how it mostly was.
---
If you don't like the experience as close as it was to the past, go to a private server that does things differently.
---
But how do they calculate that? The price of tokens is determined by the market, i.e it rises when there's more people buying than selling, and falls when more people are selling than buying.
---
Then you also can't compare BfA gold with Vanilla gold to try set it based off the BfA one because the economy in BfA is based around the fact that an absolute ton of us have millions in gold which inflates the market for tokens despite income being really low this xpac.
---
Yes and what do you mean on private servers? Deadzone on vanilla was 5yds
---
Perhaps, but if anyone finds it intimidating at end game youd be able to hit cap on retail by the time classic is out and be much more familiar with rotations.
---
I thought there was a hunter trainer in the Dwarven Distrct?
---
What a fucking legend. Everybody  mentioning "just" his world firsts, but I think the most impressive thing is that he pretty much invented those tactics himself so the guild could even get all those world firsts (at least he did in vanilla, not sure about TBC). And you need to understand, there was no all these sites with guides etc, and most importantly there was no PTR where the guilds could practice bosses before the patch even goes live.
---
Yeah I selected them for emphasis but it is still comparable. Atiesh is so hard to obtain that getting it, even with the full backing of a naxx-clearing guild (that one probably built and leads themselves), is pretty unlikely.
---
Yes..? And you said those damage values make sense. So again, how can you possibly think 250-300 damage is reasonable when you have 1.5k hp if Strat elites do 250-300 damage?
---
What is a Stress Test? Will anyone be able to log in? Like a PTR?
---
this post is at like 3500 karma
---
200FPS is max capped, or uncapped if you wish (you will go to 800 with a 1080ti and youll hear the coil whine).
---

both are not wow streamers, unlikely theyll invest much time into the game if at all.

You fuck off. Scum like you are the reason why retail wow turned to shit. You whine that the game's too difficult, that mobs shouldn't hit as hard as they do and blizzard listens.
---
also nothing stops me from putting on my SM gear just when afking in the city
---
It's an interesting idea.  Just wish somebody with beta could test.
---
I appreciate the brainstorming at least.  Just need someone with beta to actually look into it.
---
When I open my friends list on beta, this is what it looks like:
---
I do have people online I could talk to, but they are unlisted.
---
https://i.imgur.com/s0FbYfk.png
---
Alrite I've flicked through a few pvp videos that I have from back then, in some of them the red streak is pretty visible, in others there's nothing at all. I think it might be a graphical settings thing? 
---
Maybe the new charge is so bright because everyone is playing on higher graphics settings than vanilla had?
---
If overtuned private servers don't have elites doing 250-300 damage, the beta doesn't have elites doing 250-300 damage AND we have MAX level content where elites *actually* do 250-300 damage it is reasonable to assume SM elites never did that much damage as it would result in an extraordinary amount of wipes and would be INSANELY difficult to heal at level 30.
---
Its world of warcraft. It's what you do. Realm reputation is a huge part of vanilla. Doesnt really exist in retail anymore for a number of different reasons, but it's actually refreshing in a lot of ways. Feels more like a world.
---
You need to be the best Atiesh-user of your guild. The best performance, attendance, loyalty.
---
In my private server guild, we had 4 candidates (2 priests and 2 druids but it's simply cuz we didn't have veryvery good mages and warlocks, except one who wanted to stick with 1h+oh), and the officers were voting for them.
---
How exactly did another guild from your faction wipe you tho?
---
Source? The mobs do the exact same damage as vanilla from what I can tell and video comparison that I've seen.
---
Ion Hozzikostas: One of them, an engineer named Omar Gonzalez, who is on the Classic team, tried the method of taking the modern client, the modern server and teaching it to interpret the old 1.12 classic data. He kind of locked himself away for a few weeks, and came out with something that was a prototype--it was very rough, contained tons of bugs, the world wasn't fully rendered, but it was the original classic world, pre-Cataclysm. It had the original skills and talents, and we knew there's was a ton of work to do, but we felt like we realized for the first time, "we can do this." 
---
Two things
---
It was changed in 1.1.
---
The game was patched to 1.1 2 weeks before the actual game released.
---
Dude what the hell.
---
Are you retarded? You have your point of measurement as 250-300 stratholme, mine is 900 stratholme
---
I am saying assuming the fucking DB values then the scaling makes sense. Are you illiterate? Do you not understand assumptions l.
---
Jesus fucking christ man. Try to wrap your head around my reasoning instead of applying your own truth in my THEORETICAL values.
---
D'oh! Yes, there is!
---
If current wow does, then classic will.
---
I can only talk about myself, but this current beta client supports 4k. Not 21:9 because I don't have 21:9 but if it supports high resolutions it means it's using the modern version of wow as it's foundation.
---
This and the Venruki video are giving me the warm and fuzzies
---
It was pretty fun to watch. I had both streams open
---
I can’t believe sodas team fucked that up. They had the position advantage of setting up right away. The horde rogues blew a load when they saw azmo, charged without backup and all died
---
Father laying his hands on babies? And laying his hands on 'ours'? No father, you may not!
---
"this" discrepancy.  As in I'm about to refer to a specific situation.  At no point did my english suggest all mobs did 200% less damage.
---
No problem man! This is a really fun build and uses cooldowns like mad. Have fun burnin people down!
---
I don't see any of this happening. Blizzard can also make it a private option - only you can see it.
---
When I installed the beta it was less than 10gb.
---
You're not gonna like pvp servers
---
What picture are you referring to exactly?
---
Id wager that there will probably me some people that will try to race him to it just to make him salty.
---
They had a ”sister guild” on the horde side, so it started by them killing the MT then AoEing the entire raid, while the alliance guild pulled the boss away from us and eventually killed it while we were spiritwalking - all in front of a huge audience too
---
As the post explains if you read it, yes.
---
Refresh my memory here please:  1. Do bgs have reinforcements yet?  2. Does AV have those awesome mines and the troll in the middle?
---
Imagine actually doing this, fucking lol
---
Hi, /u/tommydsw
---
I was thinking of this earlier today, let me go test it! I forget if imps are unlocked at lvl 1 or a quest but.. ill go see cause I remember doing this!
---
Maybe it's just because I was young when I played and I didn't spend enough time there so it was so unfamiliar.
---
Fairly certain Cdew is playing a shaman
---
Can you link me a single video where the red trail is like what it's like in Beta?
---
Mine is going to play, so if she doesn't have to work that week she'll be up with me until late hours in the morning
---
How do we trick google into showing pictures of our Omar instead?
---
Awwww the bot tried
---
There will be a lot of this too, especially since there won't be BG's for a bit. It should make the world pretty entertaining in general.
---
32.33% chance, repeating of course*
---
Doesnt mean it wont be extremely easy.
---
Sure, can you link me a single video from back then where the trail is anything like the current beta?
---
Not just blind but devouring plague aswell. Also warrior bleeds which is perfect  for bandaging instant after trap. And a good rogue with skull that gets the jump on you is definitely not an "easy fight" . Dwarf is hands down best for 1v1. Nelf for BGs.
---
bonus:
---
1% wipe: https://imgur.com/a/ZKbyViw
---
It's where they want to "stress" certain servers with an overload of characters. It helps them gauge stability and make sure their hardware won't crash out when everyone logs in at release. They will probably send out enough beta keys to fulfill their test parameters and limit the play to a certain area or level range.
---
Can we sticky this or make it the GOD DAMN BANNER?
---
Technically Boomers are anyone born between 1944 and 1964 so some of us are in our 50's.

That was good money in China back then.

At launch you could use pretty much anything (at least on EU), even capslock. Until a few years ago, there were still ppl around with legacy names like CharnameQT and stuff like that.

---
16 days ago, 10 days ago, 5 months ago... it's not really that common.
---
Vanilla raiding was highly expensive. Between repairs, mats, and consumables you could spend a couple hundred gold a raid night.
---
&gt; They say they don't want handouts but you know for a fact they will leech their community dry of gold and items.
---
This is exactly the kind of toxicity and blind hate OP is complaining about.
---
Are you asking if I can link a 1080p 60fps video from 2005?
---
Are you retarded? Are you illiterate? Do you have alzheimers? You said SM GY mobs doing 250-300 damage MAKES SENSE to you, stop quoting the Classicdb numbers, I'm asking you how you can think 250-300 damage is reasonable at level 30 if Strat elites do 250-300 damage (if you actually think Strat elites should do 900 damage per hit you're insane). You personally think SM GY mobs SHOULD do 250-300 damage. This is what you said.
---
Well now I feel like a 30 year old boomer. Meme culture is evolving too fast. Getting too old for this shit.
---
thanks I never watch streamers but classic beta got me like....
---
Also in beta, can confirm. Mine says legion as well. (Mine is Wow5, skipped wow4 for some reason).
---
Yup I've also noticed how easy it is to hold aggro in the beta. It will be interesting to see how this will carry over to raiding.
---
You're telling me 40m raids required lots of players? I had no idea. ^(It's tongue in cheek so please don't take it seriously.)
---
The only benefit in being a dime class is if somebody quits then they can easily be replaced. The fact of the matter is, all classes are valued highly because of their unique skill-sets. Homogenization and lack of class identity is what killed this game. That's one of the main reasons people love Vanilla.
---
The only things you need to farm, you can't farm with an alt.

---
Don't listen to that guy he has no idea what hes talking about. If you're into 1v1 more than BGs go dwarf. It removes rogue poisons (including blind) druid bleeds, warrior bleeds and undead priests devouring plague. Its also decent for when youre leveling and get hit by a 20 minute disease from a mob

MOSUS!

I was 10 when Vanilla wow came out. I did not have an active subscription and first time I played wow was vanilla private server in 2006 where I only hit lvl 60 and did some dungeons. Then I played private servers TBC. I was able to play offi on Wotlk as I was able to get some money working. I wasn´t some entitled shithead kid that just cried to mom that I wanted the game and she paid for it. 
---
I was never a hardcore PvE player. I was PvPer since Wotlk and most of my EQ was from PvP. I was running PvE just for some trinkets and it was pretty doable with a casual guild. 
---
Now I have to manage my own business, spend time with my GF and go to the gym almost every day. I am sorry that by your definition I am not a hardcore fucking nerd that doesn´t understand the time investment for an orange item and that´s why I used a forum to ask some people that might give me an actual answer.
---
Rogue is a better DPS. Rogue has stealth. Rogue has a lot of escapes. Rogue has more reasonable chances for TF.
---
Hunter is easier to gear. Hunter has pets. Hunter is a stronger ganker. Hunter can make *tons* of gold in DMN. Hunter is easier/faster to level. Hunter has a more diverse gameplay in raids.
---
Sodapoppin and Tipsout wiped like 3-4 Times plus they had to run in multiple times as they had no rezz. 
---
They are Pros and still wipe, so your thesis is wrong
---
How will a division between EU &amp; NA work? Will it be completely different servers with inability to play with each other or some kind of a merger? Was any information released on this yet?
---
Unless you had two other allied raids (one horde, one alliance) slaughtering everything in sight, there was no other way. Even one taunt on the boss from a dude of your own faction could cause you to wipe.
---
Well I was granted access to Beta and thought I'd be playing that, but my wife didn't get access this time around (she did for the last two expansions) so now she's using my account.  Guess I'll go back to NWN1.
---
Looks normal. Mobs don't suddenly multiply damage because you're lower level. Static hit/crush/crit based on armor no matter the level.
---
Omar is Jesus AND Moses! He has saved our souls and led us to the promised land.
---
depending on the dragon, there were some seriously nasty on death effects, so you could wipe your own faction just by running in and dying all over them.
---
alliance winning open world PVP? this is NOT classic.
---
Yeah, I think I remember doing dungeons and having to wait to equip items because I wasn't high enough level yet to wear them.
---
I mained NE hunter in Vanilla.

Never stepped foot in Naxx
---
Leveling: 
---
Learn to kill multiple mobs at once and you'll be the fastest leveler on the server.
---
Here is how:
---
Send pet to mob A with growl turned off and the damage attack on auto. Before he gets there, start auto shot. 
---
As soon as autoshot goes off, serpent sting mob A and switch targets to mob B. 
---
If mob A switches agro to you, use growl.
---
For mob B, auto, serpent, auto and then raptor strike. 
---
As soon as raptor strike hits, autoshot mob A.
---
Then melee mob B. Repeat until one is almost dead, then pull Mob C with pet.
---
Always be looking to readjust positioning between autoshots so that you are in range of pulling the next mobs.
---
The goal is to always be able to melee one mob while autoshotting another.
---
In PVP, you are awesome without engineering, consumes (free action, Major healing) or Tidal Charm.
---
Once you have all three, you are unbeatable 1v1 and you will win most 2v1 fights and some 3v1 fights where you get the drop on them.
---
In a good premade, if you are the only hunter:
---
AB you will guard Stables shadowmelded with a pet. This can be very fun.
---
If they send 1 person to cap, you will murder them guaranteed.
---
Gets fun against other premades who send two people to cap. If you have tidal and engineering and consumes, you should beat most 2 person comps.
---
1v3 it is possible to win but often you just call out for a helper and spin the flag.
---
If you have two hunters, you switch off going to LM.
---
Typically LM is a mage heavy fight and hunters are a mages worst nightmare.
---
Focus on using viper sting on healers and peeling enemy melee dps with scatter and traps.
---
Once you own LM, you guard it while your team mates fight elsewhere ad you eagle eye to call out horde movement.
---
In PvE, you are dps. In MC and Ony, you may top meters but once people are geared, you can't compete anymore. 
---
Make sure to have autoshot timer so you don't clip.
---
You can bind royal seal or blackhands breadth to feign death so that after you use a cooldown trinket you can switch mid combat. 
---
Lastly, you can solo DM tribute for 90-150g per hour. By far the best gold farming efficiency in the game. Make a habit of doing 3 hours a week and you can fund unlimited alts and twinks.
---
Very interesting to get some insight from an actual farmer. Thank you for posting this.
---
most true thing i've seen in a long time
---
&gt; No, youtube was launched 6 months after vanilla wow. It was absolutely a thing in vanilla times 
---
I know well it existed, but there wasn't much WoW content there, that's what I meant by "It wasn't a thing". Google Videos and WCM were way richer in terms of content.
---
&gt;  We had raid videos etc up on youtube since i remember 
---
Sorry but I'm 99% sure you're wrong, I don't remember any raid video posted on YouTube in Vanilla. I just checked NihiliumTV vids and their first raids uploaded on YouTube were in BC. I'm still opened to information, if you find 13+ years old serious raiding videos posted on YT, maybe I'll agree with you. But pretty much everything I've ever tumbled on from Vanilla times on YouTube are reuploads from WCM.
---
&gt; Maybe you were, most good players weren't   
---
&gt;Most good raiders would have had decent connections. 
---
What's your point though ? We're not talking about big competitive raiders, but average players, this whole thread is about dungeons.
---
&gt; but people in western/central europe would have decent connections 
---
We had absolute trash connections in Central Europe, and back in 2004 a good chunk of the population there didn't even have internet at home.
---
Love that uniform. Looks like he's about to go play a darts match.
---
Should maybe not compare an elite/raid quest do a simple delivery quest. [This is another low level quest that gives way more XP than what you showed](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=47).
---
ok so that´s a no-go for me then. What other alternatives are there that are easier to obtain and give +healing and +ap in cat?
---
I am going off what the other guy said in that they all have a ton of blues. If that is the case then SM:GY is stupidly easy. I remember running it back in the day and finishing it without a complete group.
---
If its like retail, which its always been this way and we shouldn't expect it to be different, there will be different regions and different accounts/servers/characters in each region.
---
Server drama was definitely a thing back in the day. You didn’t have the phasing garbage so while leveling and at endgame you always ran into the same players.
---
no reinforcements for AV
---
Do you have to physically run to all of the dungeons?
---
I'd like to see them as well.
---
Can you dump them in a imgur album or something like that? Might take some time to upload, but no need to sort them for something specific.
---
Viewership is way higher for beta than it will be once the actual game is released.  Many people are watching because they can’t play themselves.
---
Did you actually watch the video? He obviously has no hate at all for vanilla.
---
Same. My wife and I played in vanilla through wrath, but my oldest kid was 7 when we stopped. She had a level 20 something Hunter at the time. She's super stoked to play again, and the others are interested to see what the fuss is about.
---
Kiss my sternum!
---
druids can entangling roots and mf solo anything in open world.
---
No need to blow a gasket about it. This wasn't a rude response.
---
My first character was a nelf, so I naturally ended up in Darkshore, it's a *really* good leveling zone when you know the quests, must better than Westfall imo, Loch Modan I've never done more than a handful of quests so can't speak for that.
---
Of course the downside is having to travel all the way through wetlands to get there.
---
This sub is sooooo toxic. Let’s make the game better by sucking each other’s dicks between world boss attempts.
---
And they will be back in Classic!
---
very truthy
---
Did you play wotlk? It already happened
---
I’m a total noob to WoW and I’m interested in cla
---
Having been in the Beta for a few days now and having died multiple times in Deadmines, shit can get out of hand pretty quick if you pull extra mobs. We had a level 24 tank and if he pulled two-three packs, it was really sketchy, but honestly that’s not why I’m commenting.
---
If you’re so focused on low level dungeons and wondering why they’re so easy... It’s because they’re low level dungeons, in the first WoW game ever made, dude... No one has seen higher level dungeons yet. No one has tested dungeons like Zul Farrak, Dire Maul (won’t see until live phase two), Stratholme, BRD, UBRS... 
---
On top of all this, I think if this is your takeaway from watching the content, then Classic might not be for you. The mechanics ARE easier, but the commitment to getting to that end game content takes longer, and the requirement to become a part of a larger community to get to end game content is so rewarding. If you want to sit in orgrimmar and queue dungeons and BGs to level 120 without ever typing a word to anyone, this game is NOT for you. You have to communicate with people, reach out for help, help others, starting REALLY early (read: Hogger).
---
People are having fun because we’re a community again (finally!), not because it’s super hard (even though there are some quests that will make you pull your hair out). 
---
I hope once you play the game and experience that, you’ll understand why everyone’s having so much fun. If you don’t enjoy it, that’s okay too! We all have to respect that different people want different things out of games. We’re all just here to have fun, man.
---
I dont think healing does enough threat in beta, even in dungeons he easily holds aggro on like 6 mobs, even with like white attacks.
---
I don't remeber it being the case, and its not like he does something amazing in tanking, that ppl didnt do back in the day. tab sunder and cleaving.
---
and he easily does these big aoe tanking pulls. when healer not holding healing at all so a tank  would get enough threat first. 
---
Imo there is definitely something wrong about it in beta with threat generation. it looked like bfa tanking.
---
Meh I'll just watch YouTube then
---
This is actually a nice fun fact. This is one of those things why vanilla was hard, people just didnt know things, haha. Even "experts" missed out on things.
---
He got good instant karma because soda didn‘t heal him and he died. Took him like 30 mins until he was at the last boss again. That felt really good
---
Yeah, but if you're tanking 6 mobs it's just a bad usage of rage, since you will only block an attack from one of them. Since you are so rage starved early on you should only use shield block either to get a revenge proc if you don't have one already or on certain hard hitting mobs. At least your sunder armor should make the mobs die faster.
---
Why would streamers get pre-access?  Is this something Blizzard is setting up or is this just a bunch of internet noise makers planning to screw things up for those looking to relive classic?
---
Idk, maybe because he’s a warrior in all plate and Joana’s tank was a pet? Idk, man...
---
Retail babies that played any expansion since wrath should honestly fuck off, the game will be better off that way.
---
That is how world bosses used to work. We would have scouts at each zone trying to spot which world boss spawned and then they would contact the GM and he would send a message on AIM that it spawned.  Everyone in the guild would run to their computers, log in and race to down it first. Sometimes it would end up being a huge PvP battle against the Horde instead and the longer the PvP battle lasted, the higher chance for other guilds to show up.
---
A minor miner. Good ol child labor.
---
Druids, mages, rogues, hunters are all good in PvP *and*  hard to master. Do you plan to raid?
---
&gt; Do bgs have reinforcements yet?
---
No.
---
&gt; Does AV have those awesome mines and the troll in the middle?
---
If Blizzard sticks with the decision to use the 1.12. version of AV, then:  No.
---
He bloodrages, that generate threat
---
Just tested, /script PetAbandon(); unsummons current pet but when resummoned the pet name is the same as before =(  
---
Unable to change warlock pet names.
---
No, I'm asking to link videos of any quality showing what you're saying existed.

---
Im in the beta right now ( cant beleive i got invited ) and even tough ive leveled 2x60 on private server this is 1000000 time beter , community is exetremely nice and the game run alot beter than any private server ive tried . 
---
I always tough classic wow would be good but thats an understatement . When you think about it , its basicaly as if WoW is going to be released again because most ppl who played it are most likely in the range of 27-35 years old atm and theres a tons of ppl who dont understand how immersive and good WoW classic is , even today .
---
Everyone will struggle, it will be pure cancer to do any quests until like lv 25
---
This is amazing! 
---
I met a chinese couple who raided high end content. They had their own Chinese takeaway company they ran when AFK.
---
The lady spoke broken English and I loved the small amount of conversation we had back in vanilla.
---
calling tips a pro XD
---
warlocks can summon with the help of 2 other people, but otherwise yes.
---
the thing is, its 3910 screenshots (2,97gb) vanilla only. (including tbc, woltk and cata its even close to 10k screenshots) and there are a lot of sensitive ones, regarding personal information, login information to forums and stuff. 
---
id have to manually go through all of them and either censor it or copy the non-sensitive ones to a different folder. 
---
thats maybe 1-3h of work that i’m really not interested in doing. atm at least. 
---
maybe one day. 
---
but as i said: most aren’t that interesting. 
---
i posted like 10 interesting ones in this sub (just check my user’s posted posts).
---
Thank god my wife will play classic from midnight on with me and she didn‘t even play it back then.
---
Thought so too. Then I saw how swifty seemingly doesnt remember a single thing from classic. Guess people are capable of many things I couldnt think of.
---
It depends on the macros, for example the old fd+trap macro will not work, however you can make another one that does exactly the same.
---
mail, no shield. The pet probably has more armor!
---
There are 1000 players in the guild Make Azeroth Great Again alone bud. Way more than that playing.
---
They can't stack
---
What a fucking hogger
---
Two words: Barrens Chat.
---
Ok thanks
---
He pulled 5-6 mobs in DM the other night and died multiple times.
---
Indeed. Not to mention people that have been/are playing different classes then they did 15 years ago. Your memories of getting torn to shreds by mob x at level 25 as a balance druid is not going to be the same as facing mob x as a fury warrior.
---
No, told her of my passion for it and that it‘s coming on 27th of August, so she respects that. 
---
If she wouldn‘t, why should i respect her 15 hours of Netflix every week
---
Unless you have a Warlock in your group that is willing to summon you, yes.
---
Holy hell dude. It's a game. Calm down. Maybe he just got excited in the moment and forgot? Honestly bro, its people like you that are going to be the ones ruining Classic. How do you expect every new player, or returning player who hasn't played in 10+ years to be an expert? Are you going to be the guy who harasses people who aren't playing optimally in your super serious WC run?
---
Bestiary shows these hitting 94-127 so with his armor this seems right.
---
I only played retail for a few months in TBC so wasn't sure how that's being resolved. Thanks for clarifying, makes sense!
---
I just remembered why its a whole lot better to play a horde rogue instead of alliance
---
summit1g is rolling a shaman as well
---
1; Yes paladins are faction locked alliance and shaman to horde, there's no cross faction content unless you count hunting them down in world PvP playing together.  
---
2; Every class prioritizes differently, late game warlocks want spellpower but mages want Int as an example. There's no "main stat outweighs secondary in all cases" for vanilla, you'll stack certain stats based around what class and role you want to play and you'll just need to research it after making a decision.  
---
3; Shamans, Paladins, Priest and Druids all have buffs and heal, they're set stats that can't be increased however. They're also basic AF like + Armor and Resists, +Attack Power, +Random Chance to hit multiple times rather than once, etc.  
---
4;  Fastest method is to follow a guide, but for the first time i wouldn't recommend it. Vanilla leveling is fun, and encourages exploring and reading quest text which involves you in the story whereas guides are just "go x do y" for 60 levels. Outside of that you simply quest and kill everything on your way between them, but keep moving in the direction you need to be going.  
---
5; Again, you can't simply stack a single stat on every class and specc and expect to be anything but trash. Each class and even specc scales better off some than others, due to things like talents for certain speccs being 5% crit or w/e. You'd look for what is called a Stat Priority, and Stat Weighting to make your decisions with gear.     
---
6;  Trainers reset talents for a fee, starts in the low silver scales into the high gold, like 50 or so. Goes down by one point in the scale every few weeks if you don't reset. Your leveling specc and end game specc always differ, same goes for PvP specs meaning you'll change talents anywhere from a few times per character to multiple times a week on a single character the entire expansion.
---
Honestly part of the fun of the talent system for me is trying to judge what's good and not looking at what's best IMO, so if you play that way expect to sink a bit of gold into respecs trying things out rather than googling "Frost mage leveling specc" and copying it point for point as you level.
---
Ye, looking closer at the clip he loses agro to the paladin that buffs him then rages and regains agro. Can't say I remember the threat values from Vanilla, but I would assume the amount of threat Battle Rage generates isn't exactly very substantial. I guess it could stand up to level 30 heal values though.
---
Bring back dopefish an the nogg-aholic crew.
---
I think you should read my other comments.
---
How exactly did I blow a gasket?
---
Yeah we had 4-5 Thunderfurys in our guild and 0 Sulfurons. Loot was never fair in classic.
---
What voice chat setups do you use or prefer for 5-man pugs, guilds, etc? Is voice-activated chat reliable instead of "push-to-talk"?
---
I know that full well, hence the quotation. But this shows how well the mediocre playerbase will fare if they can't get their shit together in a level 20 dungeon.
---
Hahaha this was so true! I wondered what a footballer had to do with classic wow. Thought he invested in it or something 😂
---
Not possible in 1.12
---
The hard truth? Probably never in the active Classic expansion. Maybe in TBC
---
Did locks have that many bugs? I dont recall anything too crazy except the one where they sucked
---
I got this info from customer support, its not open stress test and they are sending more invites. Not sure is this normal invite or only lasts 2 days  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpsqge/cs\_manager\_answers\_about\_the\_beta\_access/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpsqge/cs_manager_answers_about_the_beta_access/)
---
that soulshard addon! hope it gets remade
---
No, unfortunately. Dungeons yes, raids no.
---
I bought ESO to atleast try something new. Right now I feel extremely bored and no other game seems to be fun at this moment. Watching Soda play on my second screen. I want to hop in and progress my character. Farm mats and sell them, do proffessions and deliver service to people. Travel and planing meetings with guildies and friend, communicate how you will encounter something. So many things that is simple not present in nowadays games. Its all ment to do it either solo or get helped by the systeem which is no fun. I cant wait for Classic to come out and let me work towards that first epic mount.
---
Yeah They are integrating a lot of social features from Bnet which I think is great. More chat with people on different servers
---
Just keep proving my point.
---
/r/wow is
---
We used to use battle shout spam to hold agro on p1 neffy.
---
Its not possible to change the layer, thats the whole point of it
---
Is there AoE looting in classic beta?
---
Why do you need +AP in cat on a same weapon as a resto druid..?
---
I think some AQ weapons give both.
---
Do any of you guys know a website that’ll have all the hunter macros and guides etc it would be so helpful
---
Bloodrage generated 5 threat per rage if no modifiers are in use, making it 50 initial and 50 over time. Heals generate threat equal to half the amount you healed, once again no modifiers involved.
---
His HP went up by 40. Kinda confused as to what the problem is here.
---
Idk who's more of a Dunce, Swifty or Towelliee. Both are equally intolerable.
---
true. 
---
the equitable distribution (googled that english word. not sure if correct) sucked. a lot of guilds with a lot of item x but zero item y. 
---
i guess we weren’t the only ones trying to influenve the loot-drop-table by changing the inviting raidlead every week, so that when the “this instance is now saved to you” moment when killing the first boss came, it was always someone else who had raidlead. 
---
might have been bullshit, but we started that and some point and never stoped doing it.
---
1. Sadly it's not.
---
2. Waaay below the other melee
---
3. I don't think finding groups will be hard but if a mage or rogue/war wrote the same grp they would take them instead the majority of times.
---
4. I don't rly now except everyone say they are terrible.
---
I logged in to my account for the first time since Wrath, and I'm having a lot of trouble navigating the website.  Where do I go to see my old characters?  Is the only way by resubbing and logging in to the game?
---
Damn I feel a bit enlightened, I should look into it.
---
Lvl 30 elites doing 16 damage?
---
It can't be wrong, all the retail ex-anti vanilla guys keep saying that the beta is flawless and perfectly imitates the 1.12.1 reference client that nobody has seen.
---
Pretty sure it's NA. The reason why all those private servers are in EU is so that Blizzard can't sue them. There was a region poll a while back and NA was #1 with EU on #2.
---
For me it is the opposite. I want to play many games before I sink  my teeth in classic.
---
You'll probably have more wakeful hours in your life if you sleep at 8 hours per night because you'll live significantly longer
---
Yes you can run lv 1 to human area and lv there, you can do it for all races
---
Thanks for the offer but I’ve been trying to get my Retail guild and friends to roll with me in classic and I’m gonna try and speed through to 60 on a Warlock so I can try and snag cheap Shadow gear and get pre bis and raid. And maybe get gold for a Rogue or Hunter alt.
---
I suggest you have fun and try not to rush through the content the first time you're leveling. There are going to be people who are in the same boat as you, either new or returning after a very long break, so you don't need to be all-knowing when you start out. You'll find out a lot about the game through leveling and talking with others.
---
Don't worry too much about your build while leveling. Respeccing doesn't cost a lot the first times you do it, only if you do it several times. As for skills, only buy the ones you use while leveling or you'll run out of gold.
---
The support roles are druid, shaman, and paladin. All of them play pretty differently so try each one of them out on a pserver if you have the time. I suggest you stick with them at least up to 20 or so since they won't have many of their skills before then.
---
Close but no cigar xD
---
If I recall mobs don't do more damage to lower levels, they just do Thier own damage but each hut is crushing. Do you have any proof that higher level mobs have increased damage against lower leveled character or are you just making things up? 
---
Also ranged attacks hit way more often, it's one reason why hunter are so op at farming and kiting because they can't have glancing blows.
---
I watched some strat videos on private servers and mobs actually does less than 300 dmg noncrit. But how can we trust numbers from private servers assuming classicdb wrong at the same time. Both unofficial sources.
---
I'm almost sure you use 2h cuz Windfury is weapon dmg based. You can sometimes get into raids as Nightfall swinger (but an undergeared warrior with prot talents would do a better job).

All very renowned and very knowledgeable pserv players. Probably more, sorry I don't keep track of everybody that gets into the beta.

There's a teleporter to Gnomer in Booty Bay that horde can use.
---
It's a beautiful weekend, the sun is out, and you're already this mad. Why don't you fuck off with your negativity? Honestly. I feel sorry for you.
---
Bottom half is easy and pretty fast if you know the route and the order of statues.
---
i think blizz just realized that people want Vanilla just as much as people dont want bfa
---
"Shithead entitled kid", "hardcore fucking nerd".
---
You can log in without resubbing and view characters
---
Fuck yes I know I will! Love re-watching old movies, re-reading old books, and re-experiencing things from the past. I *love* nostalgia. Bring it on...
---
I don't play retail so I don't exactly know but it just seems like memes and pics and stuff, wowservers is the very definition of toxic
---
"world first strafe bug you saw it here first folks". Like who actually gives a fuck. The more people that report it the better right?
---
what does BiS mean?
---
They make way more now.
---
Why are you treating Asmongold like he's your close friend or something? Is there a particular reason that you think he doesn't deserve any form of criticism?
---
voice activated is absolute garbage and I hate that it's become a trend with fps games.  I don't want to hear you loudly breathing in the mic at 3 am.
---
Can't wait for Classic to fight the poverty worldwide again!
---
Whoa,someone hadn't had sex in a while, aren't we?
---
That wasn't charge, it was intercept, it's a different spell.
---
Already aknowledged in the blue post.
---
It sounds like you're making things up on the fly
---
Obviously this is coming from a private server, but I see more hunters running around in tier gear than anyone else. Maybe it's just a case of that's what I notice because that's what I play, or that tier gear is not suitable for some specs of other classes, etc.
---
At any rate, I have not had trouble finding raids, even for pugs through BWL/AQ20. The guild I'm in will run six hunters in some raids if that's how many sign up because you simply don't *need* to minmax a perfect group comp in the majority of them.
---
If you put in the time to get decent preraid gear, show up with your consumes, ready to work, you should do just fine.
---
The "must" have talents are divine int, spiritual focus, healing power, illumination, divine favor, holy power, and holy shock.  The excess points in holy often go into consecration, imp lay on hands, unyielding faith, and lasting judgment, but I wouldn't describe any of those as must have.  
---
The remaining 20 points do not have to be any particular place, but between your compliment of paladins you want at least one to have imp wisdom, imp might, imp devo, kings, and ideally but not required to have one go get blessing of sanctuary and give up holy shock for it.  That way your raid is covered with the improved form of each blessing.
---
ah but the only computer i have at the moment can't run wow.  is there no way to have a look online?
---
eu and na will not play together unless you go out of your way to do it specifically.
---
The beta seems easy as fuck

You probably replied to the wrong person.

Here are two videos showing damage amounts from mobs in deadwind pass. Couldn't find a video of a plate wearer tanking them nor do I have the time to make a comparison but feel free to compare yourself.
---
Combat rogue is the go-to spec for leveling, after that there are various assasination pvp specs, but most famous for pvp would be sub.
---
I myself played rogue and I go full combat except for Master of Deception and Camouflage in sub, I go for these first, because back in Vanilla the stealth was really slow and easily detectable, with those talents on I can fully rely on stealth and I get a lot of extra money by pickpocketing enemies that would otherwise detect me.
---
I meant it more as: I'm not going to just discard this viewpoint because blizzard says it matches their internal server.  But I have discarded the viewpoint.
---
&gt; The harpy was an extra addition edit mate. The original post is about the tigers, 1-3 damage vs 5-7. It's more than a 200% difference, mate. Why would you cherry pick my post just to try to make that point?
---
and I pointed out 50% of your post, well well. Call it what you want.
---
Best in Slot.

I want someone to make a lvl 9 Human Paladin, make sure to match the armor value, and compare the damage that Hogger does in this video to Classic.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DymPtTBzB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DymPtTBzB4) (June 2006)
---
In the video, Hogger is dealing 17-25 damage per hit, with quite a fast attack speed.
---
&gt;VAST majority of Classic players are either private server vets or Vanilla and WoW vets, it will be easier because communication today is basically a given.
---
But that just means the average player is better then the average player back in 2004. Not to mention all the resources that have become commonplace nowadays that just tell people the best way to play.
---
Yeah people will still die in dungeons sometimes but it will be a lot easier because the average player in the game is much more competent then they use to be.
---
just choose shadowmoon...that server was garbage back in the day
---
I agree 💯. I made so many friends in vanilla that I still talk to to this day. In fact I met my wife in vanilla! Can't wait!
---
I think Darkshore offers the most quests out of the 3, it really has A LOT of quests, but it's also a huge zone and you'll find yourself running up and down along the beach a lot.
---
For me as spriest it didn't look like this. But if you look under the lava it would. :D fear +mc was the only way I made it to UBRS alive lol
---
This is actually very true and I wish we could see 30-60 now because I don’t think people will keep playing the beta for another couple weeks if they can only hit level 30
---
I was pretty sure that I was replying to the first guy, so it must be a bug. Whatevs though.
---
I don't think he misspelled that because those are radically different words. How would he have accidentally spelled something entirely different?
---
Does that really matter though? I'd rather have swimming upwards
---
You should really consider imp expose armor, especially if you're horde
---
Once again, vanilla wow was never hard, just harder
---
Hi, /u/restivoiii
---
I miss energy drink all night sessions. Now that much caffeine sends my blood pressure through the roof. &gt;_&lt; Aging sucks.8
---
Where are people finding guilds for classic?
---
idek how much threat if it’s enough but i think sunder generated a lot more in vanilla too
---
That... was my point. Good job reading there.
---
I was older than you are now when WoW started so parts of that made me chuckle.
---
Roll a hunter. There will be too many rogues about.
---
Finally a shaman streamer, had a tough time finding one.
---
&gt; Sorry but I'm 99% sure you're wrong, I don't remember any raid video posted on YouTube in Vanilla. I just checked NihiliumTV vids and their first raids uploaded on YouTube were in BC. I'm still opened to information, if you find 13+ years old serious raiding videos posted on YT, maybe I'll agree with you. But pretty much everything I've ever tumbled on from Vanilla times on YouTube are reuploads from WCM.
---
I remember this specifically as my first mc clear was uploaded on to youtube. 100%
---
if memory serves me right, its the dmg thats most important but you wanna see if you can get a slower MH weapon because alot of abilities are instant, whereas a quick offhand lets you get more autoattacks in.
---
World Pvp was ruined long before that. Flying was the beginning of the end for world pvp.
---
How dare you introduce context into my circle jerk!
---
Probably something to do with the fact that it doesn't matter who reported it first. People need to stop with the dick waving contest.
---
In most cases the MT is the GL (or vice versa)  for the exact reason you'd never ever want to lose your MT
---
&gt; That wasn't charge, it was intercept, it's a different spell.
---
First of all, he doesn't have any rage so he literally can't use intercept because it cost 10 rage.  
---
Second of all if you open your eyes you can see him use charge on his button 1.
---
Gimmicky talent and gear builds are always fun
---
I thought that was some inside thing. In the SM video from the beta they were needing on things and deleting them too.
---
Weird flex
---
We had superstitions too. We go something like 2x Hunter T2 Shoulders but almost every other week a double Paladin drop. Other guild had it reversed so we tried to switch people around.
---
But i must stand corrected. We had 3 Thunderfurys and i think 2 people with a binding.

Lfg thread that gets posted here weekly

So much fun. 😊 Good times ahead my dudes. 😍👍🏻

All hail Puppy McDog
---
You know who you are, all the naysayers who shit on classic. You’ll be saying the same as this guy after release, enjoy :)
---
Nah man. There was even a comic about our guild and this rivalry on blizz EU called ”Chronicles of the Flaming Ruby”, was pretty popular at the time
---
What does that mean bro?
---
my days off = tues, wed+ paid time off for a few days = Fun time in classic launch
---
Couldn't you just eat a deviate delight if its for the worse?
---
Great point here - I remember running Deadmines as a 14 NE hunter with half my armor broken and my pet hating me because I had no money to feed it. Became well acquainted with that graveyard run all those years ago...
---
Not a bad idea, I just don't know what you'd take away other than the 1 from remorseless attacks I suppose
---
Ion said no LFG :)
---
The only solution is to group with people you trust, unfortunately. 
---
It's a people issue. The only way to really get rid of it is to take all loot agency away from the players, so kinda what retail did - forced personal loot.
---
Seeing the old outfits again stirs up so much nostalgia in me and I LOVE it lol.
---
What class will be the most efficient to be a tank with a decent dps?
---
Please no hate. Thanks. 
---
Going through my screenshots and sharing whatever I find that I already forgot about. 
---
Not trying to brag (over freaking WoW 13 years ago :D).
---
One is, but he's not online. So it doesn't show that he's offline either.
---
Unfortunately, 1.12 is the worst patch for windfudry/nightfall. It no longer procs on the extra attacks.
---
I dunno, I'm watching Soda solo elites in Gnomeregan right now, face tanking in cat form ...
---
you think you do ...but you dont
---
Also, duel wield was not available to shamans until BC.
---
Hey. Stop bragging!
---
I’ve been agonising over whether to roll Tauren or Orc warrior for pvp. I love Tauren but I decided that the stun resist was too good to pass up. The recent confirmation of increased Tauren melee range has got me confused again. Is it now basically a choice of whether I want an advantage over rogues or mages/hunters/warlocks?
---
solo is soloing elites in Gnomeregan, cat form / casting wrath
---
The worst ones are always "why do you want to join &lt;guild&gt;? and "what can you offer &lt;guild&gt;?"
---
So stupid and you can't really give a non-suckup answer if you want to join. "I want to join because you fit whatever criteria I set" is really all they need to know.
---
[deleted]
---
Also they basically buffed up like hell on consumables, at least for SFK.
---
My search was very narrow. It's every few days, just different phrasing. Take my word for it.
---
Yeah that doesn't look overly complex. 
---
I'm a huge noob when it comes to using code like you did (I started learning Python a few weeks ago). So how do you get sankeymatic to read that code?
---
Can't believe I've never seen this! Genius.
---
Oh man, that sucks. Thanks for testing it out though.
---
Seeing guzu listed with those other guys is a travesty. Those dudes are legit, guzu not so much, but he is a pserver streamer.
---
They are testing naxx already?
---
Posting a picture of Omar and upvote it with thousands of upvotes generally works.
---
Armor an important stat for all in vlassic
---
Why do you need 2 other people?
---
I dont know. i dont really see toxicity so (i mean the term it self is allready aids for me) so i probably ignore the shittalking / Flamming and Trolling (what people like to call Toxic today... because its sounds more dramatic and evil). I just remember the /r/wow was allways extremly Blizzard Fanboish and hated on Private servers and older versions of WoW i after that experiance i just disliked to go there.
---
Alltough /r/wowservers became worse since the Vanilla WoW Private server community joined in. Those people are to political about Private servers with their drama and switch the server every 3 Months for a F R E S H experiance that was annoying for usre :D
---
Boomer facebook post feelsweirdman
---
Wtf?
---
You can go into MC even before level 60
---
But being a streamer matters
---
This makes me nostalgic for &lt;Rang Rang Liao&gt;, the Chinese guild on my old realm.
---
You want the weapon with the most dmg in your MH because most of your instant abilities deal weapon dmg, like sinister strike for example. There are exceptions to this, but very few
---
People who played WoW were always millenials you single digit IQ dumbass.
---
Lol Herod's shoulder will take you all the way to 60 fam
---
No, this is a non-classic feature that isn't true to classic.
---
Why are people in this sub so utteraly obsessed with what other people think? We are finally getting classic and it seems like Blizzard is doing their very best to deliver a great and authentic experience. Just enjoy it ffs. All this negativity and toxicity in here is fucking disgusting
---
Actual geoscientist here with classic beta. Sorry can't help with the Cartman freeze, godspeed.
---
I don't trust this clown
---
This was a awsome part of vanilla, not only raids but everything. Trying, dying, calculating and documenting, sharing tips and tricks. I remember even checking stuff up in a physical book.
---
Be the Master Looter
---
Wait are you saying the red streak didn't exist at all?
---
mh high top end damage
---
like if its 132-345 and another 142-321 you wanna use the first one
---
offhand high dps typically the faster ones
---
Gives me a warm feeling in my chest. :)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids
---
&gt;But I definitely think we need more evidence than just speculation
---
what evidence do you want? do you want me to go turn on my 1.12 client and compare? do you want me to wade through hours of grainy 4:3 144p videos and hopefully maybe find possibly similar circumstances and try to draw conclusions from that? does my memory from 15 years ago suffice?
---
what is it with people who act like speculation on the internet hurts people?
---
Am I the only one who thought this? It was very apparent that for the normal plebians like us that it would entirely random.
---
Yes, but I assume they will need more players than that for the stress tests they have announced.
---
This is fucking gold
---
He shouldn't be judged by the colour of his fur.
---
Thats because the majority of people telling you this are 18-24 year old kids who never played it and are over thinking it.
---
They don't enjoy anything other than cash shop p2w mobile games buncha losers who cant work for anything
---
needless to say i give no fucks for them and will be divorcing my wife and buying a house out in the country where i will not leave for 5 years
---
How are they supposed to ninja loot if you already ninja looted?
---
Always be the one to ninja loot.
---
I dont think that guy ever played wow ever hah.
---
The lich king wins in this future and defeats the heroes
---
If you sold it to someone else why are you trying to retrieve it? 
---
I had my account in BETA and still play now. Same character as the first day of wow and didnt receive one.
---
One of many reasons I loved vanilla was learning the dungeons, they were such mazes like this one.
---
I do think it's funny that the guy whining and behaving like a child is calling other people children.  Suck on your thumb?  Like you literally actually wrote that as an insult? 
---
How will I ever recover from such a verbal beating!
---
You really need to reevaluate your life,  or if you're going to continue to try to win disagreements online with insults at least get good at it.
---
The dungeon finder wasnt very comprehensive in TBC and still forced you to actually talk to each other.
---
I'm talking about his past comments.
---
I was under the impression there were some replaced/missing animations, my bad. It's not a big deal to me personally but can you turn those modern features off?
---
After seeing the meme, I’m definitely a 31 year old Boomer.
---
Yeah how about no
---
I remember someone telling me everything releases on Tuesdays because of a Satanic cult. 
---
But then a Google search indicates that that's just the way a lot of fiscal stuff is set up. Kind of like how (technically) the U.S. military's year ends around October.
---
Not sure how this is toxic but go off
---
He died 0 times in DM.
---
Yes (unless a warlock summons you)
---
I didn't remember how it worked back then, and assumed the characters was transferred to a different blizzard account. I only cared about the blizzard account, not the characters in it.
---
I would assume same system requirements as Legion as that's what everything is built off of.
---
Fair, but as a dude who played since release, do we not remember all the asspain on the forums about those groups begging Blizzard to not have the class reality of say, being an Enhancement Shaman.
---
Yeah!  I’m thrall!  Lava and stormstrikes hell yeah!
---
Only to then essentially, be mandated to trade that in for healing tide totem and a skirt.
---
It was the same with Paladins, the same with Druids.  Generally one lucky priest would get to roll as shadow, but not really.
---
All I’m advocating for is player choice.  I don’t even want the stat lines or bonuses to be above their current configurations, make them as laughable as the current T1 set bonuses currently are.  But, give it that hairs breadth nudge so that if a paladin does want to roll prot or ret in a raid, it’s semi grokable rather than laughable.
---
soda also used a lot of his mana on damage instead of healing, sad how easy group content in classic will be
---
First respecc is 1g, then 5g, then 10g. Forgot the coming steps but it caps out at 50g/respecc
---
Yeah since wotlk world pvp is meh, but war mode was really the nail in the coffin.
---
Not like the one in beta. Like I've said, it was much more subtle and harder to notice.
---
twitch + reddit + work is how im surviving not having the beta ...at work on reddit right now lol &gt;.&gt;
---
Enhance shamans are pretty bad pve dps for raids since they have such slow attack speed and will run oom quick. There was no shaman duel wielding in vanilla so you will be using a 2 hander. All that being said, raid groups typically bring 1 enhance shaman for improved totems and to hold night fall axe for the debuff. A lot of people will try to be that 1 shaman in the raid group so it's pretty hard to get that slot. For dungeons you shouldn't have a problem being enhance dps.
---
Nelf rogue &gt; ud rogue
---
The white and orange zero ultras are my favorite. They’re delicious. Zero sugar or carbs. I pretend like this equates to them being healthier to drink. But I’m sure there’s plenty of other shit inside of it that’s terrible for you.
---
The consensus I've gotten was no. They are relatively bad compared to other dps, and you can probably get dungeons invites, but that's about it.
---
We can't trust either, but we can at least be sure that mobs on private servers didn't do less than 3x the damage of the supposed 900.
---
Not like the one in Beta. I've watch a lot of videos, can't find a single one like what we have now.
---
That does make sense I suppose. I would like to see more hardware testing being done though rather than just the actual bug testing we have atm. I don't know if blizzard factors in or even tracks hardware info for the purposes of selecting test candidates but I would assume they have access to that information.
---
“You think you do, but you don’t”
---
That did sort of hurt me inside a little bit lol.
---
thats how the spell works
---
I want to PvP as HotW.
---
Happened quite a bit on my old vanilla server. Alliance out geared the horde generally.
---
[that wasn't that hard](https://youtu.be/1qHsxM4lz2E)
---
And don't give me that "but that's a private server" it's vanilla client with vanilla gfx settings
---
You don’t have to buy retail to play Classic.  The sub is $15 and you get both.  Would you rather pay $15 and only get Classic?  Why be mad that you get retail for the same price even if you don’t plan to play it?
---
The thing is a lot of guilds don't want to spend time and energy gearing up players that are just going to up and leave once something better comes along. So if you're worried I'd try and find a guild early on (before you even hit 60) where you can slowly develop a rapport with the higher ups in the guild. Once they knew they can trust you, I doubt you'll run into any problems with raiding and gear.
---
Ninja looting in dungeons is different though, but since players won't be able to trade loot it shouldn't be as abuseable. Of course, players can always just go into business for themselves, happened all the time in Vanilla.
---
I don't disagree. Guzu is basically where I draw the line between legit good players and clueless streamers using beta to sell out. He has a good leveling route nonetheless. :)
---
Can’t wait to sit at the top of the Orgrimmar bank.
---
I was talking about myself specifically, no one else. I should have made that more clear, I did word it pretty poorly.
---
 No, but engineering can be quite good for a lot of classes to cover their weaknesses.  In this case, there are goblin jumper cables, a out-of-combat trinket that gives a 50% chance to rez on a 30min CD.
---
I've found that murder does not substantially reduce your time to kill players in pvp.
---
Warrior make for the best tanks in vanilla, while offering better dps offspec than an offspec ret paladin or feral/oomkin druid, they are however the hardest class to level without a healer pal to xp with you.
---
Yeah he was full dmg on Ironspine with tips 2h tanking. And they didn't use CC or rarely had manabreaks between packs. I guess we all forgot how easy dungeons was back in the day, and how CC weren't needed at all, and that 2H tanking was a faceroll.
---
Naxx is actually what I'm most excited about. Last time, it was released too close to TBC so my guild only cleared 1 or 2 bosses before we all stopped caring about progression raiding. There should be enough time to experience most of it in Classic.
---
Watch Esfand’s VOD from two nights ago. When Asmon wasn’t streaming. I was literally in the group dude. Haha
---
1. Not really.
---
2. fighting with melee hunters
---
3. Yeah easy enough, totems are nice, but being willing to heal will open more doors than insisting you only dps.
---
4. 1hd (Flametongue) + Shield unless you're on Nightfall duty. If on Nightfall duty then you use NF with Windfury. (shamans can't dual-wield in vanilla). 
---
If you have a fairly fast 2hder (sub 3.20), feel free to use that instead of 1hd+shield, but you still use Flametongue (only use WF on bosses actually immune to fire), you're actually lowering your dps to do otherwise as WF is worse than FT overtime. 
---
As for gearing try to build a relatively balanced set between physical and magical damage (fire specifically if you have to choose). 
---
If you go for a 2hder you can focus a little bit more towards physical, if you go one-hander go more towards spell damage, since the coefficient of FT is the same regardless of weapon speed, the faster your weapon the more spell damage you want, a slower weapon just raises the base damage of the spell, not the bonus damage.
---
Are you trying to find proof for its existence or do you need footage for a video? Just look at BWL vods from back in the day, the buff has the same icon as the fire ward for mages.
---
IIRC, doesn’t this role often just go to the lowest HPS resto Sham, and then they just heal in melee range and apply the debut every so often?
---
I’m going to cast Arcane Brilliance one extra time every raid... for Omar.
---
All I can say is, elites does *feel* underwhelming, but I got no clue tbh. Damage from non-elites seems normal though.
---
Never knew this was possible.  Thought the crusader orbs only dropped in Strath Live.  Very cool info!
---
A lot of them have BiS gear at level 30. And he was clearly getting his for 50-100 melee attacks
---
I'm playing Diablo 3 new season with like zero hype, I feel like a bot playing automatically.
---
It's a lot easier now that you can have both a AU and NA profile under the same bnet account. 
---
I played on an Oceanic server from the EU for years. At least for me the lag wasn't bad in combat and mostly showed itself with stuff like loading the game/changing zones, and opening the mailbox. I didn't even realize there was a lag until i tried out EU servers later on.
---
You can still play a trial account on a US server so try it out and see what the lag is like.
---
The warlock targets a grouped player and uses his Ritual of Summoning (level 20) and makes a portal appear, 2 other players from the same group must then click on said portal for the ritual to work, and for the targetted player to receive a prompt to accept the summon, and to be teleported on the warlock's position.
---
Are we watching the same video? Where is the huge red trail on the charges?
---
oh man that piratespeak addon which ppl used to have haha
---
The most lucrative answer for Blizzard.
---
No they aren’t. Stop saying that bullshit. Look at the videos above. The damage is what it should be.
---
Interesting, that's good to know. Thank you, I'll have to test around with stuff later on this year.
---
Hi, /u/Classic9345

On the 15th I cancelled my sub, i got beta access on the 17th.
---
In no way do I think that is a coincidence, Activision are evil geniuses
---
DUN MUROGH YEAH
---
I massacred a level 50 mage on my 30 something rogue in the gurubashi arena in front of his alleged girlfriend's character. Dude was straight up trash, and when he whispered me, I reported him and he got banned for a few days.
---
KAZ MODAN YEAH
---
**sips monster zero** image macros, now those were some good memes
---
Zoomer.
---
SNOWY ROADSSS
---
LAME
---
Multiple guilds fought for 36 hours on my server to get the first kill.
---
It was a blood bath.
---
And it was amazing.
---
Progress is all that matters. Granted you could halfass it with consumables until Twin Emperors but after that they are a must. Also this is from my experience from more than a decade ago, people may have found ways to be more efficient in loot/enchants/consumables distribution among guild members which I may not be aware of because I didn't play on any vanilla private servers.
---
Hahaha that'd be a hell of a cooincidence my warrior was named Orcken, and yeah I was 60
---
Mainly played my mage Infallible on Dragonmaw though
---
You always want the highest hitting weapon in your mainhand, typically the highest hitting weapon is the slowest, but if you have a really good fast weapon and a bad slow weapon, then you put the fast in mainhand.
---
interesting. we’ve heard so much conflicting information this week, so this was kinda cool to see. maybe there is hope after all.
---
I noticed on stream that walking through 'ground folaige' ground clutter causes it to move (sway) and react as you pass. Im pretty sure this was NOT a vanilla feature but something implemented in WoD. Is that right or wrong"?
---
I never seen a more streamer hating sub than this one, it got to a point it's weird.
---
absolutely. commented about this in another post:
---
yeah. its about the lowering number of raid-willing people by the end of classic. when they announced tbc, it had a huge impact on many guild, dividing them in „i want to keep progress raiding right before tbc comes out“ vs „why keep progress raiding? tbc greens will be equal to clsssic endgame items“.
---
that screen is actually a short time before we merged two guilds (like a couple weeks/months before tbc releae.!) in order to keep naxx progression up. just went through my 10k vanilla screens yesterday and found a few regarding that guild merge.
---
One of my best friends in WotLK was a Chinese gold farmer who also sold a lot of stuff on the AH. He didn't speak English and I didn't speak Mandarin. We found each other in Trade Chat because I was the only Tailor who understood that he was looking for a Tailor. We met in the Undercity, I made his Spellthread, we /waved, and then we went our separate ways. After that, I received the same message whenever I logged in: "u make [Brilliant Spellthread] i pay". We eventually figured out how to communicate—he learned a little English, I learned a little Google Translate—and started talking about the game, his job as a gold farmer, etc. He didn't make a lot of money, but he made more than people who had worse jobs. And he really enjoyed the game. We even raided together a few times.
---
that also sounds very nice :D
---
Try playing Warcraft 3 and watching a classic stream one the side, that’s helping me. I think it’s helping..... right? 😩
---
Wow Vanilla/TBC and Diablo 2 were the most fun I've ever had on video games. I think you're pretty spot on as well.
---
Here's his full run. First time DM at level 18 with 0 deaths.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwK3AW-oKac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwK3AW-oKac)
---
Ah okay. I personally am not into Jesse Cox due to the controversy he stirred up at Coxcon over something he himself also did. Used to love his podcast too.
---
Certainly sounds strange, I only recall wiping to any elites my level and 100% having to group up to kill them or outlevel.
---
Bugs like these makes me realize how many thousands of little bugs there must be
---
you realize this is still beta right?
---
:) nice read. thanks for sharing.
---
Does it contain artificial sweeteners?
---
Does being a Tauren hunter effectively decrease the dead zone hunters have? e.g. since there hitboxes are bigger you can melee further away, but still auto shot at 8+ yards?
---
pretty sure you cant duel in main cities
---
MLS / wow crossover! My two main squeezes
---
I always like quin playing Diablo 3, seeing him bash classic with misinformation like "wtf pally can't use swords" made me mad.
---
It kinda looks like bfa.
---
In classic it will be streamers taking turns with their entourage.
---
Has got to go.
---
Remember on your first charge at Onyxia, we must all shout “FOR OMAR” in Discord. Not for the Horde, not For the Alliance, but for the man who brought us to the Holy Land!!!!!!
---
like I said I think the numbers are accurate but I hope im wrong
---
It's using the BFA 8.1 engine right now.
---
nightsong is the song from sylvanis in undercity you do a quest and bring her a necklace and her and some banshee's sing the song
---
At least it isn't Bioware.
---
nah, no one wants a shaman doing it period
---
I remember there being some pretty badass ele shamans in pvp back then but not many.
---
The thing is that it’s missing the best part of Diablo though, the game changing sets and legendaries. It gives it a lot of replayability because you can basically buff up any spell you want to make a build around it with certain gear.
---
Engineering made that BG so unpredictable.
---
An electric pressure cooker.
---
No rogue? List busted.
---
What people also aren't realizing is WoW players are much, much better now. In Vanilla people weren't even close to being as mechanically skilled as they are now.
---
You are bitter, and you are of the age where this bitterness is sad. 
---
Get a hobby. Go outside. Get to a place in your life where twitch streamers don't make you so upset.
---
Agree, a big pack of elites like that (even with sword and shield) should result in atleast one guy dieing in the group. I thought it was widely accepted before classic that elites in vanilla was deadly.
---
Imagine not having adhd
---
I think it’ll all be tuned, there’s zero chance Blizzard will keep certain things the way they are if players aren’t feeling good about it. they care a lot about classic, and I know they’ll at least try to make it better if it needs any fixing. I hope so, anyway.
---
LOL epic mount on release he wont get the epic mount for months lol
---
They use sucralose.
---
That's working as it was, I solo'd many parts of Gnomer as a warrior of appropriate dungeon level, when I needed a few more fallout samples or other quest drops after a group falls apart. I had no problem with the toxic elementals or leper gnomes, it was those damned alarm-o-bots that made it difficult.
---
Properly geared and knowing how to play you can solo elites dude. Just not groups, or bosses.
---
Omar needs that Jaina template yo
---
Verigans Fist . . . now that was a hammer *sips*
---
"boomer" as a meme, is anyone around age 30, right now.
---
Combat Swords is optimal for levelling especially as a human (+sword skill) as you gain access to blade flurry, adrenaline rush, +hit and sword spec, and don't have to rely on backstab to deal good dps, especially considering you normally can't land more than an ambush on a mob when levelling alone.
---
It is also the best pve raiding spec (competing with Combat Daggers at a few phases but otherwise superior depending on what gear you get.)
---
(also it's hella fun to just pop cooldowns and hit two targets with insane attack speed and double energy regen)
---
This was kind of my fear!
---
He just a jelly
---
not strange you were probably a shit player back then, I soloed elites plenty of times in classic
---
It was. 
---
Tbh it was fun for the whole server because if you didn’t have a 40 man raiding guild you could still feel part of a the server-wide event because you could just go screw around and kill the guilds trying to kill the dragon!
---
Then it just came out to be full on pvp hahaha
---
&gt; Druid can not make it's taunt unresistable, hence not useful on 4 horsemen in naxx.
---
Neither can Warrior. They do have an easier time getting it to 1% chance to miss, Druid can get it down to 2% chance to miss with just two items one of which is a weapon so you can swap it out for your tank weapon after the taunt.
---
cutting unions
---
Staysafe is saying they are way harder.. hmm
---
You know the entire beta is using graphical settings that didn't exist in 2005 right? It's the same basic effect, just a little brighter and redder, presumably because of the updated lighting etc.  I can link you a billion videos of the effect, but it's never going to look identical to how it does in the beta, because it'll be at a lower res, at a worse frame rate, and filmed in worse graphics settings. Of course it wasn't 'like the one in the beta', the game didn't even run in 16:9 back then dude.
---
Just out of curiosity, what class did you play in vanilla?
---
He hasn't played since 2011, but I still check the Armory to see if he's back. Maybe he'll play Classic. I hope so. He was one of the nicest players I met.
---
Didn't even know they required quests. Pretty cool.
---
Vanillafriends.com
---
Gnomeregan elites are, what, level 25, and Soda is at level 30. It's working as intended.
---
Yep I agree. Armor, defensive stance, shield, mark of the wild buff.. lots of things at play here.
---
OMFG I REMEMBER THE NAME  Ajaxx  FUUUUUUUQ small world, also great advice!
---
This is just wrong tbh. While I’m sure some of the invites are random, it’s obvious that the vast majority of invites are going to  early vanilla accounts.
---
ITT: People who hate private server players.
---
I know this isn't classic related, but when I played private servers last, I made friends with a Chinese player. We both partied together after being ganked in Redrige. We ended up grinding together and questing around Westfall. He out levelled me a bit as he seemed to always be online, but still stopped questing when I came online to help me catch up to him. I logged out one night and said I'd be on tomorrow; I did not log in again. I still feel really bad to this day that I didn't tell him that I was finished testing out my paladin, and I was just going to wait for classic. I was really thankful to play with him briefly &amp; hope he doesn't feel bad that I didn't  log in again.
---
Leveling 1 toon to 60 is a huge undertaking leveling 2 together is going to be a huge headache...people didnt start multiboxing untill BC if i remember correctly....
---
Shroud and cdew have been playing shaman.
---
More than 6 grams of salt a day is bad for you. I would also reduce the intake of bitter foods, it might be toxic in high doses.
---
I forgot about this! This should be reimplemented if it's not the case!
---
I wanna be like him one day
---
Of everything here this one bothers me the most. PLEASE Blizz!
---
One of my other favorite places was picking off people running to ZG.
---
Soda played bad but at least he didn't blame the game and start reporting nonexistent bugs
---
if anyone needs a copy of this i can get you an online copy ...also alot of info is from the vanilla alpha so its changed or inacurrate but alot of it is still good info
---
I tried the white one its redicilously sweet. Even compared to other Energy drinks. I had a hard time finishing it but all Monster gross me out. I just keep trying them because i try to understand how its so popular.
---
Only part of this place that could get annoying for me was that summoned quest boss. Sometimes it'd wipe the group so much that it'd fall apart. (red gear, time etc.) Some incredible gear from it though. If I find out we're killing that thing on a full clear we're doing the basement first, then the rest, then that damn snake... As a tank, that is my right.
---
Fantastic. 
---
Currently inputting my own leveling notes (talent point spending, including quest chains that upgrade my wands (alot from professions but some from quest lines.)
---
Anyway can we get a type= comment? Something where we can put notes in like above? Atm I'm Just inputting them into the various quest lists. 
---
Many thanks,

Soon as I'm in that pesky beta I'll be power testing on live.
---
&gt;You know the entire beta is using graphical settings that didn't exist in 2005 right?
---
Yes, which is why I asked if it was possible to remove something that is really noticeably different from Classic to recreate how the spell looked back then.
---
That was before you spent countless messages trying to tell me it doesn't look different.
---
At least we both can finally agree that it does.
---
I played every class except Shaman in Vanilla (which is why I'm going to play it in Classic). My mains were hunter/druid.
---
Mob damage does not get higher just because you are low level. They get increased chance for crit/crushing, but not increased damage.
---
I spent way more time in SM than I should have.  I can still hear "Burn in Righteous Fire!" in my head like it was yesterday.
---
Never got the change to attempt C'thun.. We started on Naxx before clearing AQ (think the last boss I killed there was Twin Emps), and then I quit shortly after starting Naxx (two bosses in I believe)
---
Baron is also on the beta, he streams on YouTube. He tanks AQ40 and Naxx as a bear he has some experience I would think.
---
Nowhere near BiS haha
---
Ah i found you. The dude that always whines about his factions healers. Just how i remember it!
---
No talbar mantle, no fishing hat/engineer goggles, no shadowfang, no assassin's blade, not BiS ;)
---
yes so buff elites to compensate!!!
---
Wailing Caverns also seemed very easy for you guys
---
I bet if you posted that you’d get some karma :p
---
Hopefully not. I'd hope Blizzard will just rangeban chinese IPs and VPNs from US servers.
---
By release I meant non-beta, to avoid confusion
---
Der gute Desco xD
---
We kinda don't need this change.   
---
If what you want is a customized version of vanilla then hey, that's cool, you do you.  
---
So long as you're honest and don't try to make what WE (the classic community) fought for, the agenda WE have been pushing, the game WE have been longing for, into something else.  
---
You're free to advocate for what you want, that's cool. But we're not in the same boat, so get your own.
---
It's called AQ and ZG.
---
No, the dead zone is the same size, it’s just in a different position due to the hit box
---
idk I personally thought wotlk was good and the beginning of cata was good, but I can see how it lost some of it's leveling elements
---
Generally yes, but if you read his post there used to be a specific place in IF where you would be able to start a duel. Does anyone know when this was removed/fixed?
---
I hope they left/added it in, obviously it wasn't intended to work like that but seeing as they recreated bugs on quest givers I'm hopeful. If not it certainly won't be the end of the world.
---
Shroud was playing shaman last night. Plans to play resto and eventually switch to enhance.
---
Exactly, and we should be happy about that.
---
In my circle of friends there are probably somewhere between 5 and 10 people planning on playing Classic WoW. I'm the only one who ever browses this sub.
---
I'm not a Diablo player but this bothers me a great deal about retail WoW. I miss doing a raid tier and knowing there's a 6/8/10 piece set that is made for my class that I want to collect. Every piece might not be "BiS" but it's still a target to complete. I hate the WF/TF system and how there's no way to "complete" a set in each raid tier.  Spending months in BWL or Karazhan or even ICC was all worth it because you had a template of what "complete" looks like for that tier. 
---
Oh and actually knowing the names of items, not just weapons or trinkets, but gear too. I could ramble a dozen or more sets or individual pieces of loot from Vanilla, TBC, even Wrath. But from Legion or BFA? no chance.
---
I usually did it quite a bit back then myself. I thought I recall no one ever really doing it because the boss(es?) down there never dropped any good loot. So most people either just cleared the hallways up top and then the middle area, or they'd skip the hallway bosses and just jump down to the middle area after clearing some trash and I think one boss.
---
Never said you had to do them on the same day. I pointed out that the "6hours/week" statement should come with an asterisk next to it. Especially when doing progress past Huhuran.
---
You're right, it will be toggle able
---
Is this a Karol blade in main hand? And a brutality in off hand?
---
is there any proof of this that you're aware of?
---
Jesus fucking christ, FUCKING STOP WITH "IT'S JUST BETA". Did BFA teach people nothing?!
---
I adopt the herbal medicine is my new name for herbing.
---
Same as back then. Claw of the black drake + zg blade OH
---
I don't know if there is anything in your account that lists your characters but you can search here https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/search?q=name
---
yeah, the difference here is that the Classic team genuinely cares about making this a good game.
---
You might be right. Could also be that the few beta invites so far have been less random than the (thousands?) invites they will send out for stress tests.
---
Can’t get those sweet wind fury procs if he is standing at the back healing dudes.
---
ninja looting was never as bad as people made it out to be, it happened every once in a while but not a lot, the bad thing is every 16 year old kid is gonna try and be edgy and ninja loot everything.  it’ll die down after about 6 months though
---
they'll have the same amount of subs
---
Remember having time to summon him?
---
Hey. I was in Insight on AD EU, how about you?
---
the AQ sets, both of them, were for hybrids.
---
Do not play with those people. Play with trustworthy people with set rules.
---
and then you have no quests to complete afterwards and have to grind.
---
I mean it's faster yes, but man this sounds boring.
---
i admire this
---
That obvious indeed, stitches is definitely not natural by any means. Guy is so clearly on roids.
---
It's easier in the sense that you at least know what you're doing this time around but God no it's not easier overall, all the time it takes to do anything magically grows exponentially with each child.
---
Don't be ridicilous. Even the community has known the damage mitigation formulas since 2005. They'll be one of the first things Blizzard would have fixed.
---
There has been exactly one case of mobs having incorrect damage demonstrated, and that's the one from Joana's stream. The mobs in that clip don't consistently do low damage either: the same mobs deal correct damage to Joana earlier in the VOD, and they dealt correct damage to TipsOut in a separate video. Clearly whatever is going wrong there is not a systematic problem.
---
Every single other comparison, like the one in this thread, has shown that the damage values are precisely correct.
---
yeah thats actually a good suggestion
---
viskag. 
---
onyxia drop.
---
I think the community in Classic will be better than what I hear the community in retail is like (having never played retail since Vanilla). Things like sharding and the dungeon/raid finder mean that your reputation on a server doesn't mean much. Since these things likely won't be in Classic, your server reputation will actually mean something. If you're friendly and helpful that will go a long way towards being able to play with good guilds/raids. If you're a dick all the time people will start to recognise you, and people will be reluctant to playing with you.
---
That's why we still see a generally better community on psevers (although IMO the communities there are far from perfect).
---
also its not really my main focus of the thread to get new games to play. its just a sidenote
---
Oh true! I forgot about this one
---
But there is a comment from 2005 describing one of sm bosses 37 lvl.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6487/arcanist-doan#comments:id=2905085
---
There was stated spell damage from 100-200 and up to 900.
---
And another comment from 2006 mentioning 500 damage on 60 warrior from 34 boss in sm.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4543/bloodmage-thalnos#comments:id=2901562
---
Unfortunately I do not have access to the vods so I cannot compare to beta.
---
I will try to look more into this tomorrow.
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
&gt; Here: 2 second youtube search. Uploaded in 2006 
---
Indeed, you're right, there seems to be some content of the very tail end of Vanilla, but as I said, it's far from common and there definitely isn't much serious guilds content, more like little compilations from random people. How comes the Troll in the first vid wears boots btw ? :o
---
&gt; Again loads of stuff has been taken down, people aren't going to keep channels open with videos of computer games they played in their teens/early 20s 
---
Well, if that was the case, there wouldn't be so much BC content. I just remember YouTube really became massive somewhere around 2008 during LK, before that, if you wanted WoW content, it was really WCM or sometimes Google Videos.
---
&gt; Edit: do you not remember the grim videos? 
---
I do remember Grim videos, watched them on WCM along with Vurtne's vids. I watched Voidim/Hycer vids on Google Videos etc, I remember specifically looking for Vanilla videos in BC on YouTube and finding very little content, outside of giant vids like Pat's one. 
---
It's true that a lot of stuff from random people has been deleted/reuploaded, but Guild channels should have left a footprint in Vanilla on YouTube like they have done in BC. And I don't see that being the case tbh. I have this whole argument because I firmly remember how little content there was on YT at this time.
---
Yeah sure it doesnt matter - just look at all the people randomly invite on reddit - All of them have account from 2004 to 2006 and are from NA. It might not matter is later stages but it sure as hell matters now. Also im not sure if GMs the most accurate info themselves and often say things that are not 100% correct
---
What happens if it all gets reset??
---
Back in Vanilla, we actually had a chinese gold farmer in our guild, and he would find time to raid MC with us. He didn't speak much english, but everyone cheered him on when he got gear and he was always excited and happy to be a part of the guild experience. He would randomly give our guild mats for things we needed crafted for the guild free of charge, or random BoE epics he would find on farm runs for his actual job. Good times.
---
If it hurts to read what you type I can't imagine how much it hurts to be you.
---
Couple private servers had Chinese gold farmer issues they ended up banning China and not allowing ppl to connect through VPN unless they were specifically allowed (proven non Chinese).
---
Should be more crits and crushing blows I assume. Otherwise it could be okay.
---
This 100% I made the same comment under a youtube video yesterday. Sure you can't keep up with the pace of those without jobs etc but it's a none progressive server. sooner or later you'll be at the same point they are. It will take you longer but you'll get there eventually if you want it.
---
They'll always find a way... always.
---
That's not how machine learning works...
---
Summoning bad streamer followers, keep them comming, you all missed the point
---
Haha it's over several A3 pages. I'd be a small effort. Maybe later
---
Good on you for showing some humanity to these dudes. I had some similar interactions during retail myself.
---
they sort of do. Your armor has a par-value to determine how effective it is. (and it's MUCH higher in vanilla that TBC and beyond due to armor progression being normalized a bit so clothies wouldn't be as squishy compared to plate users).
---
75% reduction vs 20 is not 75% reduction vs 55. It's closer to 10%, if that much.
---
Does your book not include the info?
---
I would be in favor of that actually
---
Shit man, knew a lot of people in Insight 
---
I was in The Flaming Ruby, Arantir NE Fury warrior
---
You?
---
True... very true, but they will also be able to monitor time played in each.
---
oh man, this post is bringing back some memories on the timing of those last 6 months of vanilla. My guild had about 50 active raiders willing to push progression and once TBC was announced, that number dropped to maybe 20. Our schedule turned into just running BWL/AQ40 farm content since we fought so hard to clear it. We never considered merging with anyone (I think our server didn't have the population for this).    
---
And good on you for having your old ss's. I lost the harddrive where I had mine years ago.
---
Imagine if you could get both
---
Players* They run off the same subs.
---
If that happens, maybe we'll get BC/WOTLK servers next?
---
Blizz CS has also said being invited requires a subscription but I've had friends invited who did not have a current sub.
---
I don't think the CS really knows how this is working.
---
I stick with coffee, water, coke zero or an occasional coffee energy drink.
---
Deadzone for tauren hunter is the same size. Just about 2 yards further away from the center of your character than for other races, which can make it slightly more difficult to get out of melee range.
---
I'd love to see a vanilla video where its really there
---
Who are you yelling at.
---
That is why it is so frustrating to see many claiming that classic is the same game as bfa. All they share is the name, while the latter is absolutely more similar to diablo then even remotely like vanilla wow.
---
I wish had had so many old screens. Only a handful of my screens survived until today.
---
But not as edgy :(
---
Thank you. i smiled the whole time. Now to watch more :)
---
All classes are unique and have their own style. There is no real balancing.
---
I'd love to see evidence
---
Not enough corpses!
---
I don't think it's going to happen but for the sake of the argument the answer would be quite obvious, right? It would mean blizzard lost their ways and became somewhat pig-headed/arrogant with their approach over the years. 
---
WoW stopped being a true RPG when they introduced LFG/LFR.
---
Yes. My son is 13 and daughter turns 9 tomorrow :) It’s been a while.
---
\#Nochanges
---
This is so true. The anger and bitterness so many grown up people seem to feel because of a video game is startling, really. I enjoy playing it too, but some people are really getting ridiculous about it.
---
Nope I just grew up with the internet during a time where people didn’t get butthurt and whine at the first sign of adversity or being criticized for how they play.
---
I would assume it's Asia.  If we're strictly talking about the West, then NA.
---
I remember that name. I was Lovasik, Human Priest. I guess you remember people like Ath, Valon, Tobes? If you're looking for an alliance server for classic let me know, I've been playing with the same bunch of people since ED through Nost and some other servers.
---
I don't enjoy anything Jesse Cox has ever done but he has all the WoW cred he needs.
---
I'm gonna miss all of my broken OP vanilla macros.
---
So it's better we just sit quietly and hope there are no bugs then?  Okay.  If morons are going to misinterpret hard facts and video evidence, that's on them.  Chances are they were going to make the same dumbass claims about their intuition whether they have a post to incorrectly refer to as support for their beliefs or not.
---
So how good are you, exactly?
---
You’re already wrong, you said there wasn’t a red trail in Vanilla and there clearly was one. As for whether it was always as well defined as in the video, you have no proof that it’s a bug, what’s there to disprove?
---
Unfortunately I was a dumbass kid and botted way back and lost my account. Would have loved to have my OG characters
---
Boomer or weird, you are either a slowly sickened human being, or someone that is aware of his health. If not for his own well being, then at least for his WoW characters well being.  
---
I've been in both positions. Heavily overweight, and good shape.
---
What are the system requirements for wow classic?
---
If the active player base is using their sub to play Classic over Retail WoW even at peak points like new patches for BFA then it will likely lead to some sort of design philosophy change in development for retail. Little things like more complicated talents coming back would be the most obvious thing to me but it'd be really hard to implement anything that doesn't threaten the retail games separate and different player base.
---
It's using a legion build iirc
---
I can't wait for the axe that Herod drops. Whirlwind or something like that. I used it on my Hunter back when I didn't understand how the stats worked lol. Used a lot of the mail too.
---
Being from such a country, I doubt he's alive. Check bestgore or theync and see if you see him anywhere on those sites.
---
Interesting
---
Very nice! I could never farm that shit up so well. lol.
---
the world dragons were so fun
---
there were no AU servers during vanilla we played on US 
---
it was cool after raid as a lock i would summon like half the raid to the world dragons and we would do all 3 sometimes (i dont think we did the 4th because it was a pain in the ass)
---
so for example we would do bwl or whatever raid then i  (with other locks) would summon our entire raid to each dragon
---
im pretty sure we were trying to keep their spawns on our time zone and deny the NA players
---
I really cant wait to play classic on a good ping
---
Do a comp sci degree. Code some projects for yourself. Give it 5-10 years. You'll be there. :)
---
Except classic will eventually run out of content.
---
You don’t drink em for the taste
---
Hi I have a pretty good machine (  Lenovo ThinkPad T480 Intel® Core™ i7-8550U 16 GB , 512 GB SSD) except for the graphics card  (Intel® UHD  Graphics 620).
---
Can I have some decent graphic details on it or should I start shopping for an external GPU unit ?
---
 If opponent jumps when you cast this it makes them immune to frost nova and they don’t get rooted. Evidence: [https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/CaringAthleticJamStoneLightning](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/CaringAthleticJamStoneLightning)  
---
not a bug im pretty sure
---
Current MMOs blow and classic and osrs will show what the people want. We don’t want stupidly easy raid finder bullshit. We want a true mmo rpg experience.
---
this is great
---
3 months of Keto to drop almost 30 pounds so I can gain most of it back in my no-life Adventures!
---
I couldn't agree more. I did not intend to imply that Blizzard was not a great place to work. Businesses need to adapt and change, especially in an environment as innovative as the gaming industry, sometimes that leads to tough decisions. This does not mean that all employees always accept the changes, agree to them and adapt to the new situation. This guy and likely a few more of his fellow team members are not only riding the wave, they are sticking their neck out and make the best of it. Admirable.
---
Ever think maybe they meant it in a sarcastic way....?
---
Hi, /u/Floppy_Trombone
---
“Dear blizzard.  Is there a quest where the objective is to sleep with my mother?”
---
This.
---
If you want to be a tank you have to be a warrior.
---
So what you're telling us is that you've had a good look at the majority of the 100k+ viewers on Asmongolds stream that is clearly invested in classic in one way or another and that majority happens to display the way you describe?
---
The "special" type is for plain text comments when you want to point something out in particular and show up as the color blue. [Here's an example](https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing/blob/master/public/routes/alliance/shared.json#L79).
---
yeah you can, if you look at this matchup [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7haCbEi5K9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7haCbEi5K9A) you can clearly see how punishing it was for the paladin to not be able to stoneform out of the blind, he had to waste his bubble instead. That 1 racial could have turned that whole fight around.
---
the little payo
---
Same only played pservers till lvl 20 cuz I always wanted to run the og content.  OSRS is dope still.
---
Yup looks like free kill for a BiS Hunter or rogue lol
---
You just grew up to accept to be buttfucked by people rigging the game and seeing the others seeking to change as whining.
---
You're just lying to yourself about the shitty position you're in.
---
yeah I downloaded the hivemind bro
---
The 2H axe he dropped was such a beast
---
Redeliciously sweet indeed.
---
Were you on Daggerspine back in the day?
---
Great, thanks.  I'll move it to the 'not sure' list.
---
This is amazing
---
You monster
---
You are wrong lol if this is how it was in retail vanilla they ain't changing shit
---
Blizzard outright said account playtime and age of accounts was in their consideration when giving beta access.
---
You turn "Ground clutter" to 1, and its just like vanilla. 
---
Source: Im playing beta
---
No. Then it wouldn't be the classic we're aiming for.
---
yesterday at my friends he asked me why I am going to play to 60 again when I already did that 10 times...  
---
I told him well time for the eleventh time ;)
---
I don't. I want the core gameplay and content the same, but id like some changes. Better variety of specs (buffs), buffing the mobs, regular patch updates as if it were REAL vanilla and not some static private server, etc.
---
that was my point. people are saying it doesn’t feel like retail vanilla, and I said they’ll tune it to feel more like the original product.
---
Hillary Clinton? You play wow?
---
Ever heard of mordhau ? This game is amazing imo, although it has a huge learning curve. 
---
Here's the official trailer, where you can see most of the mecanics.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFpoDlH6Sxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFpoDlH6Sxs)
---
Haha damn
---
no yellow text on black border no upvote
---
Oh, Karol and his blades :)
---
Enh. Shamans for example, are still viable in PvP and grinding. Just not that much in raids (Except for some parts of AQ40). That's the charm about classic.
---
If you can wait until release most guilds will be recruiting through ingame chat channels.
---
He's not saying the age doesn't matter. 
---
CSR: "all you need for a chance of beta is a subscription"
---
OP: "I thought only old accounts got selected"
---
CSR: "that's not the case"
---
We already knew that having a vanilla account isn't *required* for beta. All the CSR is saying is that it's not necessary and that people without old accounts have received beta invites.
---
Legend
---
*Boomers*
---
What he said yesterday on stream was that he is trying out being on PvP server in the beta and then when it’s time to roll on classic release he will look back at his experiences and decide whether to roll PvE or PvP.
---
Ewww ony sword was better than claw if memory serves. Swords were the best mh you could get in any tier until naxx
---
try a private server until 20 and see how you feel.
---
I hope hes enjoying the memes 😁
---
in dungeons i think a factor to why he was holding agro against multiple mobs was because of the paladin aura. (my guess). since each mobs gets damaged when hitting him doesn't that add threat to him?
---
With my wife and her boyfriend.
---
it dont really matter only notice if you pvp good players that can sit in the deadzone
---
Uh what?
---
Is there a reason why Blizz is limiting the mounts (armored) other than "we want to"?
---
Yeah but if this were BfA then half the people disappear into another shard
---
I also did the same but no beta (2006 player)  😞 i guess you must be US, EU players seem to have less chance of beta.
---
Every hit should have been a crush or crit though.
---
Even when he's crit, it's for 133 and 134 dmg.  That can't be the proper modifier when he's taking regular hits for just slightly less damage.
---
At this point, I trust private servers to have it more correct than the Beta.
---
Calling Tips an idiot makes you seem toxic as hell. The dudes done way more for the classic WOW community then you could hope to achieve. Classic gatekeepers already have bad reps for being toxic and seeing forum comments like yours on furthers people's points. Chill out with the negativity.
---
Hi Dustin. I'm not trained at all in software studf but I'm really curious about what the nitty gritty behind this was. Promise I'm not looking to argue. If you could explain ot like I'm five I'd really appreciate it!
---
The lack of healers*
---
Rogues are the Eddie of Tekken.
---
I was feeling the same way, until I picked up wc3! The wc3 full campaign is the perfect game to play pre classic. It sets up the lore, the zones, the faction leaders, and to an extent the game play of classic. The founding of durotar campaign even plays a bit like classic wow, and I think was a test by Blizzard to see how a warcraft role playing game might work.
---
They haven't said so
---
she's a real stinker :P
---
Did a rogue bad touch you.   Remember it's not your fault.
---
There is a LFG discord here https://discord.gg/qWmfSQ7
---
I remember paying bc and wotlk on a much worse Intel integrated chip, I reckon it'll run fine, just won't be amazing might be like all low couple mediums for 40-60 frames
---
Yeah the gear makes such a huge difference at these levels, especially for tanking. They ran deadmines in full greens when most new characters would still be wearing a bunch of whites or even some greys.
---
I'm waiting to see the streams of "normal" people running the dungeons who haven't played in 15 years and are wearing typical crappy gearsets. People watch these streamers and think it represents a typical run, but I think it's likely to be a lot different for your average pug group.
---
You can test this now, download WoW and login. (Free to play for all, up to level 20.) Classic runs on the modern client with many of the advanced graphics set low by default. Players can turn up the graphics on Classic if they want. Many aren't to capture the old feel.
---
Diablo 2 hardcore! You die it's over, makes you care a bit. But then if you die and don't feel like starting over you're back to square one... All the more reason to stay alive!
---
MMOs are almost universally CPU dependent.
---
Not saying that the CSR has correct information here, but I did say it seemed like having an old account was a parameter for being selected, which he or she assures me is not the case. So you are simplifying the conversation quite a bit here.
---
server imbalance??? in WoW? no way
---
I love Loch Modan, but you won't be able to only level there. You run out of quests ~lvl 14, and you need to go to another zone.
---
Not sure about darkshore but Westfall is always worth it for the defias quests
---
I've been out of country for 10 days so haven't been paying attention, is it RNG to get into the Beta or can I hop on and play at any time?
---
Don't worry in a bit more than 3 months he'll run it daily for his DalRend swords \^\^
---
Well it looks like soda is going horde. hopefully blizzard does something to keep realms somewhat balanced
---
Yes it’s the best time.
---
This post just reminded how much time this game took to literally do anything
---
Yeah. But ehy do you think the sub is the same?so they can brag about how many players are playing WoW without having to mention classic to make it seem like retail is really great now and you should check it out.
---
This is true. TBC dungeon finder was good in my opinion.
---
Remove this post, you're not allowed to name private servers on this sub reddit. I will pm you a couple servers instead
---
It should be all Crushes and Crits at that level!
---
Yep, I remember one server doing that during a time when it was the most popular server. China responded by relentlessly DDoSing the server until chinese IPs were unbanned again. :/
---
wouldn’t even think of that being a thing. haha
---
most people did other stuff. nobody I had ever had any contact with at any point in the life of the early game had ever been involved with anyone who would actually go for a record leveling time like that. your extremist position is unrealistic.
---
Me too please
---
Sounds ridiculous. IF you have kids, then it's understandable to not play during the day. You both have kids, it's not fair (although my wife would watch them and tell me to play), but when the kids are in bed around 8ish, I do whatever the hell I want. I can't imagine being with someone telling me when to go to bed, I'd actually lose my damn mind
---
I much prefer push to talk and have always used it. Voice activated has gotten a lot better over the past few years but requires the user to tune it properly. I agree it is inferior to push to talk. One nice thing in discord is the server admins can set a channel to be push to talk only.
---
I think that's the plan. Soda as horde and Asmon as ally (+several more streamers on both sides), their realm will be que hell so to the non-streamers wanting to play there.. good luck.
---
But if it does well we have TBC and WOTLK servers to look forward too
---
They won't. There literally shouldn't be any question on this at this point.
---
We got moped by Alliance on our Vanilla server. The horde side could barely piece together a raid for MC, while Alliance was clearing BWL daily.
---
actually not that big of a deal, when having absolutely no life. 
---
also, lot of items were in low lvl dungeons that you could solo (as a overgeared rogue).
---
Right. Take care. Bro.
---
I will burn a whole city down just for 10 copper
---
Probably the last post I'm making cause I think I've figured it out, I watched crendors stream, he was a hunter playing with a shaman, the shaman put Stoneskin totem down, and after that the damage he was receiving went down permanently. So it looks like stoneskin or maybe all totem may be bugged in this manner.
---
"Jumping underwater swims up instead of jumping" - I could be wrong but that sounds correct to me. You would only jump when at the water line, if that's what you mean(?)
---
You sure nobody *accidentally* maybe tossed a DOT or two on a healer while you were watching?
---
tbh the most important feedback is from endgame 
---
its important but i dont really give a shit if a level 7 mob does slightly too little damage
---
i highly doubt any raid or even level 60 actual propper testing will happen
---
most reference video is also obviously from level 60 
---
while i think instant 60 beta classic and vanilla servers would be huge for the quality feedback and bug reports its just not going to happen
---
more than anything the beta is about content creators advertising the game \ gauging interest and server core tech testing like server stability etc
---
no shadowmoon on release lol and then azgalor (ass's galor) lol
---
N0rthd@le - L!ghts H0pe
---
Shit wrong person I responded to, sorry.
---
Still you're wrong about it's not a question about "muh feelz" as you so delicantly put it but more a question of mentality and the mentality you have is toxic whatever way you justify it.
---
&gt;New players should be well aware and simply be humble and ask questions. It's not like we won't help people. Just don't be an idiot and jump around pulling all the mobs in dungeons because you're a spaz.
---
It's exactly what happenned during retail wotlk with the introduction of LFG, before you were in your own select community only grouping really with people you knew, then you got exposed to the rest of the community and found it was shit but you didn't have the patience to teach them and just raged about them (or they were dicks and refused to learn that happenned aswell).
---
Toxicity was a thing back then, is a thing in private servers and will be a thing in classic. You're just less exposed to it because you filter out the toxic elements yourself but it's still there.
---
holy shit dude just wait 3 months its not that long
---
Tbh the last boss was higher level than the rest specifically to cause artifical difficulty in dungeons - his level didn't dictate the level range for players. I remember most WC runs I did on retail were with parties lvl 16-18, SFK was like 20-22 and BFD around 23. Nowadays PServers pops are gigantic so there's never a shortage of players at a good level for all dungeons, and group leaders just select people outleveling the whole place to make the runs smoother. I was on a low pop server and we did with what we had in terms of level. I'm kinda surprised by these vids with people outleveling the thing completely.
---
thanks. dude.
---
Congrats, I guess?
---
you just pointed out one of the most important ingredients of classic wow. thanks for flaming.
---
No
---
What about wall jumping/climbing?
---
You have to:
---
1) Opt in for classic wow beta on your account settings, and
---
2) Have an active subscription.
---
After that, you just need to hope you get picked. They'll be doing a few rounds of "stress tests" as well which will allow many more people to join in order to run their servers through the paces.
---
Good luck!
---
people took this shit very serious, since their raidleads told them to behave. it could have consequences regrading your raid slot. 
---
-dkp aient fun ;-)
---
I’m from Argent Dawn EU! Was it The Flaming Ruby?
---
I'm in the beta and I see more sophisticated play.   I dont find the mobs to be harder than I remember.  I can certainly say that I am geared more intelligently on my warrior than my first year in vanilla WoW, and I feel like my gameplay is considerably improved.
---
Phantom Blade for rogues anyone....
---
you obviously didnt read the entire dialogue. 
---
at the end im trying to get stuff from him :DD
---
This. MoP emerald dream was intense
---
No one gives a fuck.
---
:48, 1:21, 1:46. All seem to vary in intensity depending on camera angle.
---
Is Mara Princess runs gonna be available for hunters in Classic or was that a private server only thing?
---
cringe
---
As someone who wants to raid and pvp with a rogue. Was it worth the leveling grind in the end? Did you have issues gearing up? Thanks and cheers
---
  https://www.vanillafriends.com/index.php
---
try to explain this situation to like, lets say your grandpa.
---
Yo, that's the point of this whole website!
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
24k people registered and counting, plus it's filterable by realm and faction for you.
---
Discord is a blessing to WoW classic, I’m on the same boat as you, I like to game hard and meet a group of likeminded players on my server. Alot of the guilds forming now arent really gonna even be as good as they claim
---
yeah, which i have been utilising for "spend 1 point in x talent" if its like 19.98.
---
problem is when i wanna input more extensive notes it kinda bloats the last objective.
---

---
Herod with both is easily Naxx-level. So good luck.
---
It has become a trend because encoders and software have become infinitely better at detecting when the person is actually speaking.
---
I used to be the biggest advocate of PTT but with recent improvements i've swapped to voice activated.
---
I believe in vanilla, you would jump up in the water, even below the water line.
---
And it isnt going to stop until release so stop being a smart arse
---
Ofc
---
Why is this man getting downvoted so hard? Streams are the best Classic content right now.
---
click bating. didn’t come up with a better title :D
---
That's really interesting.  Do you have a link/timestamp by any chance?
---
It's kind of absurd that nobody on the beta is checking it out and it's up to random viewers to piece it together.
---
So yes, that's where you lose me fam.
---
you should have asked... does the account have beta access?
---
I knew it! TFR! Is Khristina and Caliana still around? I remember helping Khristina with the Atiesh quest in strath. I’m still friends with Chevron, he was their warrior tank then. We talk like every day, and play retail sometimes.
---
Hey, are these guys coming back for Classic?
---
Awesome, I'll check this out thanks.
---
Where is that bottle from? It brings me some memories.
---
@Blizz gief me beta plx I'll stream whole day
---
scnr
---
My guild had a Chinese farmer that we brought in raids too! IIRC he wasn't very good, we just thought it was funny
---
Anyone have a link to sodapoppin view from this?
---
Yeah you still had to talk to people and find out what spec they were. Sometimes you would see a group that needed 1 person and you weren't sure what role they needed so you had to talk to them. I cant even count how many times I would do this, find out the group was full, and then 5 minutes later get a PM telling me they had room for 1 more and get an invite.
---
hey buddy, did u get an answer? i want to make a tauren shaman, and duno if i should go with mining eng or herb alch
---
It's like some ppl never knew about ElitistJerks.
---
Will be playing, am not an expert in the slightest. If anything, not knowing alot just adds to the magic. There’s plenty of people who would give their left arm for a first time experience of Classic WoW in this sub, figuratively speaking of course. Will you be the most effective player? No. Will you have a blast? Most likely yes!
---
Hi, /u/Windrider63
---
This. So heres my story to why im avsolutely excited to play classic and will play for months to come ones it releases. 
---
TLDR: Nostalgia is bringing me back, RPG is going to keep me playing for a long time. 
---
I cant say I've been playing retail WoW, as i quit WoW back in 2009 due to college and other life responsibilities. But some RL friends of mine still play and told me about classic and how they wanted to get the group back together. As I didn't even have a personal computer (i usually just use my work laptop for personal stuff, not video games though) i was reluctant to get back into it. But ultimately the nostalgia really grabbed me. To be able to even see my old main that had over 1.5 years of gameplay time (full tier 2 and some 2.5)  on would mean a lot to me. Unfortunately my account was "compromosed" and sold and permanently banned. After much talk with blizzard they said they couldn't do anything, very unfortunate. I was ready to throw in the hat and say guess its probably good i don't get back into WoW. But my RL friends said they've been playing on a private server, so if i wanted to play, they'd start new characters with me and i could get a feel for if i want to start a new subscription come August. After much thinking and some solid convincing to my wife, i forked out $1200 and got a very very solid gaming laptop (to play a game from 2004, i know it was over kill but i don't tend to go cheap on purchases). 
---
Let me tell you, I've been playing daily and loving it. There is just so many layers of RPG  and the fact that everything seems to have a good deal of work needed and a fair reward is a breath of fresh air from the games that come out that are either pay more money to get gear or here's the gear easily obtained for that instant gratification. It made me realize I was always chasing another WoW with my PS4 game purchases (aside from FPS games) and never found one as involved or work/reward balance as good as classic. Ive  played destiny, fully maxed light and gear within 2 months, in WoW ill be lucky to hit 60 by that time, let a lone be raid ready. This is the hobby I need in my life for after work. 
---
After talking to my friend about the retail version, and I just finished a character in Diablo 3 previous season, i couldn't help but notice the similarities. WoW is supposed to he heavy RPG and Diablo is more your instant gratification rpg. I really didnt like that they sounded the same. WoW needs that annoying 20 min run to a dungeon because you dont have the flight paths yet, it completely makes you feel immersed in the world. WoW needs that super high grinding material that takes hours to get enough mats for a recipe that is an upgrade or you can sell on the AH for a lot of gold, to be more immersed into the world. I honestly am glad i haven't tarnished my memory with the retail version by coming back sooner.  Im sure there is great QoL improvements but one of the biggest things about classic that I liked was work needed for reward. When i had full Tier 1, i felt like someone in the game, standing in IF, I'd get so many inspections or just random what spec are you using or where did you get x item. Really felt a part of the world and many Pugs i joined, people would say, oh shit its Edgar (character name not real name). That pride for all the work i put in, makes it all worth it. Really hard to find games like that anymore. 
---
Sorry for the rant. Just excited to be back. Way more than i thought I would be.
---
LMAO good call. i was thinking Maraudon.
---
I don't know how all of those things scale so I can't really comment but its interesting points to bring up. I hope someone who knows the math behind that chimes in.
---
Same could be said about this guy posting the video on the sub.
---
No agm. Wasnt there a theowing dagger that gave +3agil?
---
I know me and my friends should be doing quests to level faster but...  
---
I do expect it to become a year-long dungeon leveling as we did before.
---
Oh you couldn’t move frames in vanilla? I can’t remember
---
One more very good example why avoid streamer realms.
---
Ravaged, BIS for hunter aoe tho
---
Yep!
---
But I'm a zoomer
---
Just a reminder man, Joana's record is 4 days, 20 hours. 
---
So please leave me the fuck alone with claiming 10 days played to hit 60 is some sort of extremist record leveling time.
---
Sounds like the [Member Berries](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1685/2975/products/Member_Berries.jpg?v=1507648582) are out in full swing.
---
It's the conjure water icon for mages lol
---
I still have Felstriker in my bank, just because of how amazing it was compared to most dagger offhands.
---
A bug is a bug, just reporting it for consistency sake
---
leveling grins in the end:
---
worked well. i think i remember spending the last 1-2 levels in winter springs and dungeons already to get to 60. and as a rogue, that’s definitely easier as with lets say a healer. also, thats only temporarily if you want to raid. 
---
issues gearing up:
---
no, since i had no life whatsoever and played like 100% from my free time (i was in school). during vacations i had like 16-18h/day. 
---
if you invest that amount of time, you get your gear. 
---
fast forward, i got a job, a woman and a child now. this time ill casual the shit out of it. no where ill see an epic item in 2019. 
---
leveling rogue was and is awesome. 
---
stealth itself during open pvp is such a fun skill.
---
Yeah man, TFR is still around in retail, raided with Calliana a few months ago - some will be coming back for classic for sure. I remember Chevron!
---
This is fascinating, thank you for sharing this history
---
You need to understand most people in this sub did not play classic past level 30, thats why everyone’s favorite zone is barrens and favorite dungeon is WC. 
---
Just wait for it and let classic play out itself, raiders will be crying for a rebalance of class roles in no time.
---
Haha, good one. I'm glad I didn't, because if the answer was 'yes', I'm not sure if I would've been able to not take it back :D
---
This is me, 100%
---
warrior got hit for 120+ and 133+ on the third and forth hits he took. a few seconds after that he took a 140. we can assume a range at least of 90 - 140.
---
the mage, who had half his armor broken and the unbroken half was cloth to begin with, took damage inside that same range, 99-115.
---
the warrior might have had about 25% more damage reduction from armor value compared to the mage, so I suppose it could still be right since we didn't see enough hits on the mage to establish some kind of proper data. it just looks odd at first.
---
this is not bis. i didnt come up with a better title.
---
This is where you’re going to see a divide. Purists want all the original interactions seen in classic, whether it was just a limitation of the times or not. Other people don’t care if small ‘improvements’ are made. It will probably end up somewhere in the middle at launch.
---
And yet still you'll have players keep their mic gain up to 11 and ruin it for everyone else by sneezing/burping/heavy breathing. We always, always have to keep 40 man raids in PTT otherwise there's too much bullshit noise
---
Throwing dagger question?
---
This is the best time to get into wow
---
It will be the best game you’ve ever played. I envy your innocencd
---
think many wonder this
---
I’m up for it. 28 year old boomer here. Any starting tips from being extremely out of shape?
---
Ohh, for real? xd I didn't even remember
---
Drinkin a Monster Zero Ultra as I read this, I identify so hard with this thread.
---
I’ve always thought that chasing absolute balance in an MMORPG is a bit of a fool’s errand. All you really end up doing is making all the classes reskins of each other.
---
A lot of people on this sub are convinced streamers are going to negatively impact the game by having a stranglehold on any server they roll on.
---
That's actually pretty cool! :]
---
I know they plan to invite a bunch of people for the stress test
---
the way they worded it in one of the updates i dont think the stress test will be open to anyone (which i think is stupid) but if they want to do a stress test and its not open to everyone they sort of have to send out a lot of invites
---
so id expect at least a few thousand invites to be sent out just before the stress test essentially because its a stress test
---
question is how many people do they want on the servers for the stress test
---
I tanked in Vanilla.  I personally, did not go into an early level dungeon until I was high enough level to not be crushed by any boss.  I had no qualms with DPS being lower and healer being even lower than them.
---
Tanking when you are just low enough to enter the dungeon makes it harder to keep threat (more misses/dodge/parries on your attacks) and strains your healer more.
---
HUNTER WEAPON
---
its the best mmorpg ever created and its 1 of the only mmorpgs where you don't have p2w or cash shops
---
I have an i5 with a 1070ti, playing at 1440p@144fps on the 1.12  client is horrible, huge fps drops, freezes when I open the video options. Maybe my client is especially fucked but I can't wait to have the retail client!
---
And look at retail now. Everyone has combo points and 10 spells. Even though they regularly use 4 of them.
---
I certainly hope so! I think the tighter communities could definitely foster a more respectful attitude from most people though for sure.
---
I say all streamers should play on the same server, that way people know which is "the streams server" so they can avoid.
---
Our guild discord only allows PTT, if that makes you feel better. I used to use an old usb piano pedal to PTT with my foot.
---
Yes! Ravager looked so cool too.
---
auch das internet ist erschreckend klein ^^
---
If you can use it, need it. Am I right?
---
China isn't that gruesome. To be real though, the government won't let him play those long hours anymore
---
I’ll let you know August 17.... due date a week before release. :(
---
Same here, and nostalgia wise I still play Path of Diablo ( mod with a few spell changes and quality of life additions ) from time to time. And it still has the same feel when finding those big uniques. 
---
So I agree with OP and think that I will have another great experience playing classic outside of nostalgic reasons.
---
DX11 only could be for the test period to avoid problems with multiple configurations on various players. Would be odd if assets just couldn't be made compatible with DX12.
---
Sure, swords were the way to go. The day i got dal'rend set complete was one most memorable moments in vanilla for me, but fist weapons allways had more style and imo the 5% extra crit (~33% at the time)  were more worth then 5% on extra swing, especially against warriors. Just the opinion of an old troll combat rogue.
---
when expansions release and cap is raised they don't reset. but I hope they do to get as much "testing" as possible.
---
I don’t remember needing a lot things like CC until ZF, i recall everything lower than that it being a nice to have/just being careful
---
Specifically he did class/character/spell design I believe. There were other develops but they focused on items, or questing, or world design.
---
Make sure to make your wife's boyfriend some breakfast, that guy had a though night plowing your sweetheart wile you were doing deadmines
---
No way things are accurate in current beta. The first thing warrior does after charging should be battle shout, the buffing effect is the best threat/rage. Right now battle shout does nothing for threat.
---
Cool, thanks for the info.
---
hmmm yes to easy i agree fix blizz pls
---
0/10
---
In the case of ravager which has literally zero stats I'm inclined to disagree, but the hunter meme is too good to pass up.
---
I know what you mean and I feel the same but the old client runs way better on old hardware than modern one tho - I can run modern games @ultra settings but the 1.12 client is very unstable to me, I get drops and freezes. The fps can jump from 200 to 20 and stay that way for a couple of seconds for no apparent reason.
---
HOGGER MUST DIE
---
I come down to Goldshire from Darnassus just to do this.
---
I'm just a random guy that replied to you over what I saw in the first day of beta testing. This has nothing to do with dick waving. I just think it's a little ridiculous how streamers get so much hate on the subreddit when most of them are reporting bugs as they see it or chat sees it while playing the game normally. 
---
I want into the beta as much as anyone else, but the amount of salt being thrown at people that got into the beta just because they have a large WoW following is pretty childish. Clearly it's backhanded remarks like "And this is why you invite THESE people into the beta" imply others that have gotten into the beta aren't looking for discrepancies as they play as well.
---
Joana is a speedrunning 1-60 expert from Vanilla, that's great, of course he belongs in the Beta, but perhaps PvP isn't his forte, whereas others thrive in PvP and remember exactly how abilities worked back in the day. 
---
All i'm saying is everyone has their place in the beta that have received their beta invites, and soon.. most people will probably have a chance during one of the stress tests to try things out too and hopefully some of the rage boners will die down a bit when that happens.
---
I destinctly remember being able to swim up in vanilla, and being miffed that this was bugged on pirate servers.
---
Memory being imperfect and all, I am still fairly sure this is a pirate server bug and not #nochanges
---
I am in.
---
Just the sort of person we don’t need.
---
Calm down.
---
The majority of "RPG" mechanics in WOW were terrible.
---
Weapon skill in particular was awful because all it meant was finding a fast, low DPS weapon and going AFK hitting things for hours. When we talk of the fantasy of mastering a weapon this is not what is imagined. Instead this could of been a quest to master the sword by seeking out a blademaster in Un'Goro crater or something who will teach us how to excel with the sword.
---
Ammo was just DPS upgrade rather than meaningful differences in arrows. You carried trash arrows and boss arrows. This is an area where rogue poisons were significantly more fleshed out.
---
Class trainers were vendors for skills.
---
There was no race quests. What is it like to be a Darkspear troll? What they do they value? What is their place in the Horde and what is their views on other factions within the Horde?
---
At the core WOW has much more in common with Diablo than roleplaying games. WOW is primarily about perpetual power progression. RPG games were based around choice and how your choices impact the world. They have themes, explore ideology and your party members change over time. WOW is kill the dragon for loot and come back next week to kill the dragon for loot again.
---
The key difference is the history of mechanics. RPG mechanics were primarily born out of abstracting world properties and interactions into a system that generates an outcome. The roleplaying part is you playing the character and deciding what they'd attempt to do given the situation. The mechanical system then generates an outcome. The important distinction is the black box outcome generator is not roleplaying. The roleplaying was the player deciding that the character would attempt to lock pick the door.
---
If they were to add more mechanics like weapon skill back into WOW I hope they take the approach that it has to be done with great developer effort and not lazy systems like vanilla weapon skills. Reagants for your spells shouldn't be something you buy by the hundred from a vendor on raid night.
---
I think I’m going to restart fallout 4.
---
Give myself unlimited ammo and just spray and pray through the campaign for a while.
---
Not saying you shouldn’t have fun. 
---
Just be sure to report actual bugs/glitches along the way
---
It seems like the boomer/zoomer meme has reached the mainstream and now the term is being overused.
---
This just in, the meme is dead. Normies killed it. RIP
---
Will I get an email saying I have beta access? Or is it just an exercise of checking my launcher periodically?
---
I tried the wow retail trial. After an hour and only "go fetch X crap" or "go kill X crap" I uninstalled it. Was classic better when it comes to quests ?
---
One of my two bests friends was a Chinese gold farmer. He was American though, we lived outside of Pittsburgh. He paid for my epic flying mount in BC for me and I had to slave away to pay him back. Good times. Asians know how to make the paper.
---
Actually you being pathetic is a you problem. Lol
---
This is like the 10th time this video has been posted this weekend.
---
You guys are hating on streamers so bad it's beyond Toxic. Classic gatekeepers get such a bad toxic rep and here you are living up to it. Some of the streamers have done more for making classic WOW happen then all of you combine. You cry and bitch and complain about streamer servers then just shut up and go your own way. Hell, half of you all probably never played vanilla and are private server players. You don't have to support these dudes but there is no sense having such a toxic attitude toward people who have done nothing but help the development of classic WOW and hype it up. Stop being so damn childish because when new players come here they see this stuff and automatically get driven away and guess what?! Classic NEEDS everyone to survive. Does not matter if you played vanilla or not the toxicity is so needed. Plus, to those stating streamer servers usually fail or die out with activity most streamers choose high pop to full pop servers. These servers are full of life. Anyone with a brain will choose active stable realms.
---
This all looks right. Private server was a similar experience. He’s being healed by the shaman and the druid. Sham offheals. Stoneskin totem, imp stam buff, the shield from cath is one of the first shields that really boosts your armor up to be a considerable damage reduction boost. This is very doable by any group with voice comms. Its a lot more difficult when you’re in a pug over in-game text chat. Teamwork and communication makes a huge difference in vanilla
---
Should be more than good enough. Acer Nitro 5 is one of the best budget laptops out there.
---
Christ the AQ event would be an exact replica of the original. With the server exploding the entire time.
---
To be fair the dungeons get harder with level increases. I rarely/never had a deadmines group fail except for when people left/quit.
---
BRD emperor run on the other hand, I think only about 1 in 5 of my pug groups finished (they usually fell apart on torch room).
---
It's been dead for at least half a year.
---
uhh wut
---
Yes, definitely!
---
So he practically didn't?
---
Can you check to see if you have beta access on the mobile battle.net app?
---
If I could tell you three sentences before I die:  
---
1. Drink at least 4 liters (1 gallon) of water daily.
---
2. Never mix carbs and fats. 
---
3. You have 168 hours a week, of which you should spent at least 3 hours to stay fit. (You will enjoy the rest 165 a lot more)
---
Mmm, tasty maths. Thanks!
---
I just saw Goldfinger the other weekend at Back to the Beach. Can confirm the majority of us were 30 old dudes dressed like early 2000 high school. It was a glorious weekend.
---
Yeah, it wouldn't be smart from an engineering perspective if they fall behind too much. Missing out on an increasing amount of stuff and retail wouldn't be able to benefit from Classic improvements either.
---
Or, big streamers give the game more publicity? They clearly stated they wanted to keep the beta small to a very dedicated group of people.
---
Carebear triggered
---
Blizzard would ***NEVER*** share that information if it turned out Classic was more popular than BfA.
---
Okay, thank you :) Yeah  i wasn't sure how the Ryzen 5 2500u compared to like an i5 or and i7, something which was recommended apparently by the WoW team a part of the recommended specs for playing BfA
---
Gnome rogue better than both those
---
I know life can treat you like shit and you venting your negative emotions through reddit wont help you. 
---
I hope it gets better for you soon, or that you get a beta invite asap. At least you have launch to look forward to!
---
I did a bit of digging and found the mention of this in the beta patch notes 0.10 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_0.10](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_0.10)
---
"You can now use jump in water to swim upwards." - Jumping would always swim upwards rather than jump underwater, at least from 0.10 onwards.
---
but it is an extreme by definition. the majority got nowhere close. that was a superstar time. you would be a server celebrity with a time like that.
---
Ah I see your concern. I've through about linking to images or videos in some of my comments too but never bothered to implement a way to do it. I'll figure out how to add it and PM you + mention it in the manifesto.
---
I’ve played games with several communities and private servers. I know what toxicity feels like, and I know what high standards look like.
---
Unfortunately it seems the younger generation conflate the two. And maybe this toxicity is moreso on Reddit than in-game (which is ironic since Reddit is a platform predominantly for younger generations).
---
I’ve played classic and private classic servers for several games like EverQuest and DAoC. Those communities are some of the best, but certainly have people with high standards. They are always willing to help out and answer questions though.
---
The most toxic communities I have experienced are in MOBA games like HoN and LoL. People just freak out constantly all the time of you aren’t standing in the exact spot or going to the point.
---
In WoW Classic Beta it has been nothing like that. Yes in raiding and high level of play it might be more strict but basic grinding and instances are not.
---
My theory? These aren’t just random people you won’t see again. They’re people you will likely level with and group up another day. Because there is no dungeon finder and random instances. If you’re an ass, people won’t want to group with you and you won’t have tens of servers worth of people to join with.
---
Dungeon finder and random instances is one of many things that killed the WoW community and I’m glad it’s gone.
---
You're acting like its totally new though, when it's literally the same effect just a little brighter. It's not new or anything.
---
Dude you just opened the gate forever
---
I made it to exactly level 12 during vanilla too before BC
---
What’s a good class/role that you could “make a name for yourself “ on your sever with? 
---
I’m thinking a tank would be the obvious answer but from what I’ve read the time sink on a warrior to do that is insane.
---
My GM said the same
---
Seriously going to write that down and follow it. Lol, I’m seriously going to get my shit down and classic wow is my motivation.
---
I'm actually looking forward to patch 8.2. Mechagon looks good and while I haven't seen much of nazjatar what I have seen looks really good.
---
You know how in retail wow you kill a mob and it gives you a quest item? In vanilla you'll kill 10 mobs for one quest item. One mob at a time.
---
Woah, you are right, it really is there!
---
I used to know their locations and farm them for honour on rotation when the battlegrounds were empty for the night. Good times.
---
I remember farming razorfen kraul but I can't for the life of me remember what the item actually was. Anyone care to refresh my memory?
---
Any Streamer/Youtuber playing a shaman on beta?
---
same
---
Huh, the more you know.  I knew you could always right click to face upwards and swim, but I could've sworn jumping in water didn't just make you paddle upwards.
---
I’ve heard* an email comes but it can be 24+ hours after you have access. 
---
*heard from others here so take it with a grain of salt as it is the internet
---
&gt;but I've had friends invited who did not have a current sub
---
I've heard these rumors but I don't really believe them. Either way, it looks like you need an *ACTIVE* retail subscription (I.e. gametime) in order to even enter the Classic client, so ultimately you need to pay to test it right now.
---
I might activate 1 token later on if they extend it to 60, but so far I haven't had any beta invites neither on my 2008 account nor my 2006 one.
---
I was gunna make a comment asking this same thing though.... How hard is it to have a macro that sends pet on auto shoot? Or just remember to press the button, or literally click the send pet button....
---
Absolute legend. Thank you. This is exactly what I needed. 
---
Time is valuable now with 2 little terrors. 
---
Thanks for your hard work.
---
Who is lying to their viewers? Most of the big streamers personally meet with the classic WOW dev team for Q&amp;A's and to get updates and provide recommendations. What did you do? Oh, you sit on reddit shit talking people being a classic gate keepers. GTFO here kid.
---
Shroud has been playing shaman
---
Keep the buzzwords coming, zoomer boy.
---
I think a lot of it is bias because of where we are. I’d say MOST people on this subreddit have accounts from vanilla/early vanilla. Therefore all the people you see getting beta happen to have accounts from early vanilla. 
---
I have seen plenty of reports from people who started in legion or bfa getting into beta.
---
Jesse Cox is playing Enh I think.
---
Lol I’m 6 foot 4 and 220 and I’m fat as fuck

That's the part where he puts the totem down for the first time. He killed some crabs on the beach before this point, and then killed some more crabs quite a bit later and the damage was different.
---
Since you don't want the responsibility of tanking in raids (which at some point will happen), your safe option is maining a rogue.
---
There’s an interview where they state they did not want to force people to rush to 60 to get them before whatever wave removes them kicks in.  They wanted people to be able to play at their pace and not miss out on it.
---
Aw you guys should have given him some fiery cores and lava cores to help him out
---
Upvote for the feels and the bad drawing. I hope the in-game community has a little less salt than this sub has this past week.
---
Asking the questions that really matter. I haven't seen anyone try out wall climbing/jumping yet.

I remember getting a few of those back in the day. Wonder if I'll see them again in classic.

I'm unreasonably excited to make resistance gear sets
---
not a boomer ...was 14 in vanilla wow...but yeah im excited, also you wife has a boyfriend ? oiyfum
---
Can someone explain what’s the deal with Omar posts lately?
---
TBH this is more like a grandpas anecdote, chinese gold farmers dont actually play the game legitemately anymore. They are all bots now, speedhacking with modded world z axis via warehouses filled with servers and only a couple of people managing them.
---
Omar is everywhere
---
Software engineer here: if you think you've "banned VPNs" you're absolutely wrong unless maybe Google tried it. There are lists of known VPN ranges, but they're not even remotely close to comprehensive.

wow excited to see you in the game fellow boomer!

buzzword is a buzzword get an identity
---
The hell is a boomer? That fancy two for a boom kin?
---
Vanilla is litteraly step one its the first game its the beginning the start the fucking MAGA dude play it and love it
---
thanks for the review/lecture. don't know why you replied to me
---
Please don't ruin the in-game economy the way you did the real one.
---
Dropped on our first kill. Went to rank 14 orc warrior in guild and then we did bgs after raid.
---
Not specifically to classic that I am aware of. However the general consensus is that it’s running current client so current specs should apply.
---
Fuck, i hated dkp.
---
wonderful
---
I think they know this.
---
gloves. also bracers were there i think. 
---
trinkets maraudon. 
---
is that possible?
---
Really really!
---
I fucking love the Temple!
---
I am in school for it. And this is the level of dedication I want to have.
---
Thanks for the link.
---
You are aware I am talking about /played, right? Not literally leveling from 1 to 60 on May 19th through May 29th?
---
lol this is great
---
its okay I only plan on selling some copper and skins :)
---
Dont you mean run in a loop from bank roof to the buildings next to the AH and back to bank roof again?
---
Probably not like that but yeah, there probably will be chinese selling gold in classic.
---
I started playing WoW in 2006 on a private bulgarian realm. I was sucked right in. I bought WoW+TBC in April 2008 and raided a bit till WotLK and then quit. In 2016 I started playing on Nostalrius as a druid and I loved it.
---
Just take it slow. Classic is here to stay. Try whatever you like, read stuff, learn. I know both factions and I'll roll druid again :)
---
NO CHANGES! It’s slippery slopes. Play retail if you want changes like that...
---
You wouldn’t believe some of these tier five memes these days, kid. 
---
(I literally had to ask the same question a minute ago.)
---
Same. I playing hard-core to have an adrenaline shot from time to time and a good reason to leave if I die.
---
Any class, it's more about how you interact with people.
---
XD
---
because they increase ranged atk speed, it says nothing about being bows or guns. OP is asking if wands are affected since they are a ranged (physical) atk
---
Which may work fine against private servers, but I very much doubt that a company with the resources of Blizzard does not have the ability to mitigate DoS-attacks. Worst case, they can just cooperate with local ISPs and request them to blackhole any and all traffic from China.
---
Fuck the Chinese. I'm sure there's plenty of players from China who mean no harm, but every MMO they infest, they bring the bots, farmers and gold sellers. Let them stew on their own localized realms.
---
Rogues do much more dps than hunters, but in raid u still need 1/2 hunters due to tranq shot. 
---
But if all u want is top dps go fury warrior or mage.
---
In early raids at least in fresh pservers in raids they take more hunters cause they can make even more dps than a mage, with MC gear. The problem with hunters is that they dont scale well with gear compared to other classes, but they are a fun class, the best for solo play, strong pvp and still needed for raids
---
Lfg ruined the game. It wasn’t a knife to the heart, but a slow cancer that ate away from the essence of WoW. The new gearing system is assuredly awful as well. Played through legion without having a clue what the name of my weapon was. Yet even now, 15 years later I remember my warrior’s weapon progression and gear. 
---
We are going home.
---
Things like this are why the world is beautiful. It's been 8 years, sure, but he's probably off on his own adventure and so are all of us, and we'll all be back.
---
Fair enough, thanks!
---
I've taken the liberty of doing it:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqhqc1/rare\_mobs\_list\_timers\_and\_locations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqhqc1/rare_mobs_list_timers_and_locations/)   
---
mechagon sounds like a transformers movie from 2006
---
Hey don't rule out a random world drop epic that you can't equip !
---
Funny. I haven't seen it.
---
On our server dragons were brutal. 
---
My fondest memory is when we were late to show up to the Hinterlands to get the dragon. Right as the guild who got there first was about to pull after getting buffed, one of our paladins ran past them on his mount pulled the dragon and bubbles, giving enough time for one of our warriors and another healer to show up. They 3 manned it long enough for the raid to show and we snagged the kill. That was a hot topic on the server forums for a few days.
---
same name on twitch?
---
Farm MCP’s
---
By retail do you mean live or back in vanilla? Pretty sure the level requirements were a thing.
---
lol, those folks dont play games to have fun - they do it because its a way of making money.
---
If you're incredibly lucky you might score a raid spot as nightfall bot, but it's not something you should plan for tbh.
---
yep
---
most people did other things. speed running to 60 wasn't the normal thing people did. normal people played for weeks or more just to get to 40.
---
Ha, nice one!
---

If we're being pedantic they're pseudo-random
---
bfa is beta
---
I love reading these and it makes me a little sad. I spent my wow days on Oceanic servers as I was living in Australia at the time. Now I'm back in Sweden so all those potential old friends are going to be playing on a different region.
---
There was some (likely a private server thing) exploit I remember from YouTube with Hunters using that axe. I dont remember the details but it was pretty effective.
---
Shame, it's good stuff.
---
Strongest point of druid is to outlast anyone in 1v1. And feral isn't the spec you should use to do that, you wont have enought mana.
---
People who played will be both knowledgeable and discovering it again. It has been more than 13 years, I think the game changed a lot since (I quit during burning crusade) so even those who played for a long time will be in a bit of unfamiliar territory again.    
---
Besides the long grind to get gear, wow was/is rather a casual MMORPG in the sense that getting to max level is just the beginning of your adventures when getting to max level was nearly impossible in many MMORPG existing previously or around the time of wow release.  With the exception of a few legendaries and top pvp equipment, if is reasonable to get any item as well which is also quite the departure from other games.   
---
It has a bit of a build aspect but it is also very mild and forgiving compared to games where your talent points are hard set and you could get screwed if not going as optimal as possible.   
---
It is a fun time sink for some good party time with a bit of a challenge but nothing insurmountable.
---
you can do it in classic but not till it comes out
---
no, they were serious
---
Your welcome to scroll through it the sub and look for yourself.
---
Let my people play!
---
Bruh, don't talk shit about my Jncos and Airwalks.
---
Ever think of WHY that is? The biggest indicator of crime is poverty. Many gnolls have parents and grandparents directly effected by Stormwind’s cruel Jim Gnoll laws. Preventing many gnoll families from earning wealth. 
---
Also, a gnoll commits the exact same crime with the exact same history as a human, and they’re given harsher punishments than compared to humans. 
---
We’re getting better over time, but our system has directly hurt Gnoll society
---
Keep the old screenshots coming. I'm loving these.
---
Its a Video of Joana lvling in Vanilla at 1h 53min you see him fighting an elite mob. White hit his pet for about 100.
---
In Classic beta SM:GY run i saw elite mobs hitting Tipsout (warrior)for about 50 and Sodapopin(druid) for 70. Tips was using his WW axe, no shield and soda was in caster form.
---
Not saying it is proof or anything but give it some time might be a blue post saying something in the next weeks. 
---
Not hard to imagine that something got screwed up when they mushed Vanilla into the BFA frame.
---
The weakest point of the setup is the CPU. WoW is notorious for not using multiple cores efficiently and does an awful lot of it's processing on a single core. This means that a 2GHz per core limit is going to be an issue. It should still be possible to tweak the graphics options to get decent frames up to 1440p, but that is genuinely best case.
---
There is an option to run classic as it was in 2004 so yes u can most likely run it
---
Granted [this](https://youtu.be/TypwFz9CakA?t=65) is during 1.9.4 but you can see the gnome jumping underwater.
---
First Rag kill, I was jumping in my seat, teamspeak going crazy. It was real magic, this huge boss that didn't even fit on my screen downed for the very first time. Words can not describe the intense joy I felt.
---
The blizzcon demo used the 7.3.5 client but it’s since been updated to the BFA client
---
The beta uses the modern FOV (field of view) calculation. In Vanilla the game calculated FOV differently (FOV was also narrower).
---
The best solution would be a FOV slider in the options.
---
Remember them uselessly idling/bugging out in mid?
---
Considering it was Ion Hazzikostas himself who did the math.
---
It's unlikely to be included again, only for some ptr joke at best.
---
Lmao you shit on people who have no home for owning a cellphone. Meanwhile you can't even make your mind up about wether you want to play a magician or a warlock in WoW. 
---
Fucking retard

Watch pvp videos of either class and choose based on what seems most fun to you
---
check my recent posts. posted a couple throughout the last 3hours.
---
Is that your excuse why to be a dick?
---
if you post a region poll on NA primetime then NA will obviously seem bigger, same thing other way around
---
No, we won't. Bosses are their 1.12 versions, like Blizzard has stated with everything else "mechanical". The progression is artificially limited by phases; the mechanics are taken from 1.12 (including itemization, Alterac Valley, and yes, boss mechanics).
---
Someone was rocking a buttondown T with the 90 as playmat that every one of your friends had.. I had to walk up and high five him. Such a nostalgically magical weekend. The lineup was insane:
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/SCx5v8F
---
Imo, having closed beta without NDA this early is a mistake.
---
Not shady at all. If I were Blizzard, why not reward dedicated fans?
---
Actually, you CAN stack them, but they need to be on  2 different weapons. So what you do is equip your main hand, use Windfury Enhancement, then remove the weapon and equip your off hand, then use Robiter Enhancement, then equip both weapons.
---
However, you CAN NOT have more than one weapon enhancement on the SAME weapon, i.e. Rockbiter + Windfury on the same main hand.
---
Ofc they will do a hard reset for the 27th of august, its a beta. Beta characters never stay. But IF they raise the max lvl for the beta sure its a good idea
---
Cool.
---
Re: the mining node thing, I realise I completely mis-read how it was written, and it has nothing to do with level restrictions. (doh)  
---
The only thing I found in the patch notes that may be relevant there was that mining nodes would show as grayed out (but still appear on the minimap) if below ground. So, that edit should definitely be ignored :)
---
Soda/Tips going horde, Esfand/Asmon/Staysafe alliance, i'm expecting a huge alliance population, unless some other big guild join horde
---
They are all this easy. Some pulls in ST are hard, and Eranikus which is 55. BRD is easy.
---
The sub got infected, and apparently isnt being moderated or curated even in the slightest. Most of us read the first omar post and appreciated it and learned from it. Recently tho, all I see here is memes and other lazy and troglodytic non-discussion exercises in groupthink
---
lol ion is the reason it got nerfed ...realy doubt he will let it go in pre nerf
---
Yea it was just friends messing with eachother in game that progress is going get wiped anyways. Context is everything.
---
The armory is still active??
---
......./s?
---
Found the Bfa player lol
---
Hmmmm when did I say any of that? That seems like you’re assuming a lot there. Maybe projecting a bit? I dislike retail wow like everyone else here. I’ve played vanilla pservers since WotLK ended. Just because I understand how this industry works and know that I’m not special doesn’t mean I’m encouraging a specific attitude. I don’t get butthurt over not getting invited to the beta over streamers. Which it seems you are. So who’s the snowflake here. Guess what my man you’re not special. No one gives a fuck about you. So stop your bitching and wait for the game to release like me and everyone else here.
---
never said anything about the actual release... of course it's reset then.
---
we were talking about level cap raise during the beta like you mentioned ;)
---
Nice what year did this guide come out, just asking because certain guides came out durring alpha and in house beta and have changed info
---
What book is this from? I just bought the 2nd edition strategy guide, and dungeon companion.
---
If this is in the atlas 2nd edition that will be here next Thursday :)
---

I wish everyone knew how good things used to be.

AROUSES
---
NO! This is vanilla and I will not let you cata babies destroy it for me.
---
You think they used to be good, but they really weren't - Blizzard
---
I assume you haven't done SM Library in Classic. The 900 dmg aoe spell takes him 10 seconds to cast and you're supposed to exit the room to avoid it, that is literally the mechanics of the fight, avoid it or risk dying.
---
The Thalnos kill seems to be saying that he did 500 dmg to the Warrior in total, not in one spell.
---
Nice progress man!
---
They will be similar to retail wow.
---
You seem more like a rogue player.
---
druid is not the worst class at all its fine play what u want feral is faster leveling anyways ...not sure where u got your info ( druid = fast solo leveling ) same with hunter and warlock druid pvp is ok feral is not the best but if you get the jump on someone you can win. its no rogue but it works
---
This is quite insightful. I can't WAIT for the dozen or so """"""""""""""""""""Official Content Creators®""""""""""""""""""  to make endless videos about it.
---
at this point i dont even want classic. i just wanna go back to a time before """""""content creation""""""" became a full-time job for mongoloids who cant hack it at a real job and treat it like its a honorable profession
---
No one knows. Nor have I heard any times when invites tend to go out 'each day'.
---
:X
---
so how can you say that needing more than twice the record time to hit 60 is some sort of extreme? 
---
*more than twice*. That means I spent more than half of my played time doing things other than leveling. How is this speed running?
---
warrior easy to master rogue easy to play hard to master
---
yup, same here :( looks so stupid
---
We tend to avoid advertising websites that sell merch.
---
They very clearly stated that nothing will be changed number wise.
---
Doesn't matter how it "feels". They have the original 1.12 server/client running to test. They'll check the reports and if something is wrong with the calculations they'll (hopefully) fix it. But if not it'll remain as is.
---
I think you're so right. It's about the items!
---
This is one reason I still play a classic EQ server. So many of those items I have permanently lodged in my brain by name, stats, mob that drops, their PH, etc.
---
Classic games were so good at presenting the carrot and making it taste so sweet when you finally get it.
---
&gt;  they’ll tune it to feel more like the original product. 
---
no, they said that they wont do that. they will air it as vanilla-like as possible. they dont want to implement changes even if they would (according to them) enhance the 'vanilla experience'.
---
I guarantee you omar already knows he is appreciated and doesnt care if you press a button on reddit.
---
that’s... what I said.
---
What Americans think Canadians say "Omar eh"
---
Maybe it's because the posters in this sub are mainly NA players with old accounts.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Cough asmongold
---
It was the best entry point for newcomers back then and it will be again. Sure you'll have people who have some experience on you but plenty won't or think they remember more than they do, or you'll meet people like me who are playing a totally different class this time around and have to learn everything all over again. Come join us and have a good time!
---
It's slower and tuned in a way that you can't pull 10 mobs mindlessly, but this idea that instances like fuckin SFK are crucibles that can only be cleared with masterful execution and aggressive CC is nonsense. I used to three man some of this shit around this patch leveling up with a couple of friends. 
---
I don't understand why people are invested in the idea of it being oppressively hard. It never was.
---
Ascension wow private server. Check it out
---
Speaking as a top Druid Healer from vanilla-wraith here’s my 2 cents.  In vanilla druids are viable for a few things, but not the best at any of those things. For example- Druids in vanilla are good at healing, leveling, and capture the flag.  
---
If you love Druid and are passionate about it, you’ll have fun even thought you’re not #1. .  If you are a min maxing elitist, then pick the best classes for those tasks. Priest for healing, hunter for leveling, or mage for capture the flag. 
---
Enjoy and hope to see you in there!
---
I hope Omar becomes rich and famous... or whatever his dreams are
---
Don't forget to sign up for Beta access in your account.  You need to check both Warcraft and Classic WoW selected under Beta options.
---
that sounds like a bad idea, but alright.
---
Ehm, what?
---
"If people are saying it doesn’t feel like retail vanilla, they’ll tune it to feel more like the original product."
---
Completely unfair the Alliance has an immortal leader.
---
They are probably afraid that it won't be "mathmetically impossible" like Ion claimed. From the looks of it, cthun was bugged, meaning there was a high chance that pure RNG would just wipe you(tentacles spawning in walls). But it's possible, there was a post saying that they might do a blood of hakkar event again, so cthun prenerf for a week or something doesn't seem that unlikely.
---
This is actually the reason you can transmog T3 onto other classes on live wow. Since you had to be a warrior to accept the Dreadnaught armor quests, they did not class restric the pieces themselves.
---
the closing sentence for both of our comments was basically the same. you just repeated what I said.
---
Have you cleared any instances yet? I've also leveled several 60s on a pserver, but never had the chance to play the real deal.  I'm super stoked about finally getting to try it
---
Yeah Themechanic messaged me yesterday and said he doesn't even care, it's not even a thing. We were even running around doing stuff. OP is just trying to hatemonger against streamers for something that has absolutely nothing to do with him.
---
Pretty sure it ranks as the absolute lowest dps spec, even below boomkin. Especially after bwl. You run out of mana very fast, and it’s boring. Pvp is fun as shit though. Get in a guild as a healer, let them know you’ll pay for handof rag, pvp in your off time and always show the guild, and everybody will just throw you hand of rag. Go pvp and wf clothies
---
If you don't want to tank in raids then you can't go warrior, it's that simple.
---
Boredom and laziness. Like obviously there are countless other people who this would not have happened without, and while the story is cool, a guy as awesome and selfless as Omar seems to be is probably just sickened by the sycophants on this sub and the lack or recognition or desire to investigate the contributions of his peers. Its lazy kiss-assing and it contributes nothing. The original post detailing his contribution was all we needed.
---
I'm sorry you're upset about not being in the beta but you're full of shit lol. It's not just streamers that are in. You're not s hero.
---
This is funny as f, but i fail to see how this resembles the title.
---
Hopefully they'll implement the option to enable Dx12 later on. I would love to play Classic with the improved graphics, as well as multithreading for better performance. 
---
The people crying for "no changes" can still play with his option disabled and do their own thing.
---
But I would love if Blizzard did something with this.
---
It's because huge portions of this community are absolutely frothing at the mouth for opportunities to bitch and moan about how 'Bli$$ard' ruined their perfect baby. Tigers in the beta are sometimes doing 2 less damage? Fucking ruined. Two months of same-realm layering to make the game playable? Absolute trash.
---
Forget the fact that the people working on this project are largely those who played (and often **made**) the original game. No, it's just Bobby Kotick in a trenchcoat nefariously trying to smuggle in transmog and LFR without anyone realizing. For reasons unspecified, the devs apparently want nothing more than to ruin people's memories.
---
You weren't very clear then, because what you wrote and what I quoted says that they'll base their decisions on what people "feel" like. :)
---
Vanilla/Classic was made with casual players in mind. The leveling process is quite a bit more challenging than it is in retail WoW, but other than that it's really not as hardcore as some people say.
---
If I leveled as retri paladin, can I still heal dungeons effectively without respecing? At which point is it no longer possible to heal dungeons effectively without holy?
---
Pretty good I'd say
---
well, yeah. that is pretty important, is it not?
---
Goddam this sub likes to down vote.  In most other subs I swear I only see down votes for some truly stupid or offensive shit. Over here, if you say anything remotely out of the sub meta you're down voted.  Heck sometimes it's positive stuff about classic and I'm still down voted.  
---
I swear in an earlier comment thread someone said "ya I like watching streamers" -10 votes. I commented "ya I like Esfand he's a positive guy" +10 votes.
---
Like wtf /r classic it's the same comment. People are just so quick to see things negatively.
---
while I love vanilla the people downvoting you clearly havent gone for +15 mythics. It is harder than any vanilla content.
---
Level requirements were 100% a thing in vanilla. It's the reason every twink went gnome, the +15 engineering allowed them to get things no other race could in the level bracket.
---
Ret aura and thorns both gen threat for person being hit.
---
i was told it was an automated system that does it once a week...so your guess is as good as mine
---
I had two Dawn's Edge and a Dwarven Hand Cannon.  Give me 8 seconds to channel my aimed shot and I'll one-shot that enemy priest.
---
yes, i agree. i would like to see some changes aswell, like nerfing broken gold-farms, maybe buffing super underperforming speccs a tiny bit (i.e. moonkin etc), making the game overall harder because we, as a player base, got a lot better. did you know that  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11815/hand-of-justice](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11815/hand-of-justice) is actually nerfed by around 45% on private servers and still, by far, the best pre-raid trinket available?  
---
classic is gonna be a very low-demanding grindfest and a lot of people will be disappointed by their expectations :/
---
Virgin Anduin vs chad Thrall
---
Yep, just need an intellect set of gear. I wouldn’t take it past Sunken Temple without a heal specc, personally
---
&gt;The horde side could barely piece together a raid for MC, while Alliance was clearing BWL daily.
---
38 man premade Alterac Valley wins in 8 minutes or less. Guaranteed or it's free. Cho'gall and Mug'thol servers was horde controlled. I would sit up on the floating island to Kaelthas and use discombobulation ray on alliance flying up to the zone in. would turn them into gnomes and dismount them.
---
Also helps that in terms of making raids easier, paladins were way more useful than shamans. totally worth it though to listen to how hard all the alliance guilds used to cry about huhu and visc
---
You probably won’t enjoy Classic then. The gameplay was a lot more fun though so there’s that.
---
That's nice handy tool thanks for sharing!
---
But what I'm saying is that Blizzard will not take into account how people "feel". Even if it "feels" undertuned they'll just say that that's how it was Vanilla and that'll be the end of it. They'll not tune the numbers the slightest.
---
server imbalance comes hand in hand with wow certain racials are better for raiding / pvp so there will be an imbalance no matter what happens
---
It's a warrior lv 30 quest, don't worry every warrior gets it
---
Of course, most of the quests in many games is just like that. "Go fetch x crap" or "go kill x crap". But the fun thing about the Classic quests is all the lore involved. There are so many small stories that you go through if you read the description of the quest instead of only the objective.
---
I Can't wait!!
---
I’m all for no-changes. I don’t think anything drastic is necessary, I was moreso talking about the gameplay numbers and stuff. If they’re incorrect, they should absolutely be fixed. other than that, they shouldn’t do anything that would be noticeably different.

20 Talents,  
---
50+ Items,  
---
Lots of enemies to battle,  
---
Lots of areas to explore,  
---
And a fully developed storyline!
---
Over 1 hour of gameplay, this is a full RPG developed on Flash.
---
How big a poster did you print? 24 x 36?
---
My server had a mod called BabbleFish that made us able to talk to each other, eventually blizzard broke it but it was a lot of fun to sit in BrM chatting with horde friends I had made during PvP and ganking people.
---
and you don’t see a problem with that? if they’re wrong, you don’t want them to make them right? I don’t understand.
---
He's talking about a different off-stream run
---
#nochanges
---
I'm a purist so -  ***"Absolutely nothing, no changes, period"***
---
&gt;Let’s make the game better by sucking each other’s dicks
---
Can't speak for the game but it would certainly make my life better.
---
You can heal as ret up to sunken temple easily, and further if you keep a healing set with more int.
---
My originally vanilla character was a night elf rogue named “stealthyone” 
---
I still cringe thinking about it lol
---
lol iconic moment relived haha
---
The only time people have ever really talked to me in retail was to tell me I was a shitty healer lol
---
Farming linen on new classic realm might be hell
---
I’m interested to try and get my account back as well. Did you contact them via FB?
---
that's huge news
---
It could be worse - By 1.12, Feral wasn't quite as terrible anymore, thanks to being buffed like every other patch.
---
But it's still not a good spec. And in PvP, you're twice gimped, because you can't use your engineering arsenal as freely as all the other classes IIRC.
---
I wouldn't bother and roll something more favored.
---
This thread has 3640 upvotes and 580 comments, and all of it could probably be clarified if a single person with beta did some direct testing.  I'm bitter for pointing that out?  I didn't say anything about streamers or about being a hero.  You either can't read or you genuinely get off on attacking people for no reason.
---
Right in the feels bro. I've played with some NA friends for a time. Community was really cool. Peak hours were a disaster though gotta be up around 3.a.m to get any group play going haha.
---
@SoupaSoka
---
Thanks for the informations, I would like to know if you could please, measure the minimum and maximum RAM usage over time with both minimum and maximum settings (let's say between the start and the end of a big session of questing), it should be higher than in vanilla but still not very high.
---
Maybe thats why he misses classic...
---
Indeed, remember all those guys!
---
There will be some old AD people playing classic but I’ll be rolling horde this time around - but would be cool to gather as many old AD people as possible on the same server anyways, the question is how to coordinate that. I can talk to TFR and the old HFC crew
---
No problem. My friends and I actually found a couple of old guild mates through it. Spread the word!
---
But dad, I wanna raid with you! I can tank, I've mained DH for 2 weeks!!
---
/s
---
In all seriousness, where you come from and what you've done before does not matter at all. The only thing that matters is how they behave, and the way you express yourself with that comment is the kind of way I think we will be better off without.
---
&gt; . Resto is the worst PvP healer by far, suffering from a lack of both support and a proper flash heal type spell. 
---
\*mows lawn\*
---
Who remembers the greatest meme generation? Philosoraptor, Good Guy Greg, Scumbag Steve, etc. 
---
Those were the days.
---
There are literally dozens of us!
---
Blizzard has buckled under the might of intentional DDoS attacks multiple times already... I have no reason to doubt it could happen again.
---
Most definitely :)
---
Retail was wierd..you hit the correct level instantly que for appropriate level raid, do shit damage because your gear sucks, didnt have a good roll on a peice of loot but that's ok here's a epic item as a gift at the end....it put me off so much, I cant wait to get that first epic in vanilla and feel like I earned it
---
I woke up to an email. Arrived at midnight EST, and last time i checked was 5PM EST. So if we assume they sent it at  5:30 PM EST, it could have been delayed by 7 hours (the email). But that's unlikely. 
---
Hope that helps.
---
Sounds nice, i would actually enjoy that a lot. Are u aware of a similiar addon already existing (dont know if updated but i used it years ago). I think it was a combination of LootAppraiser + Pricing Modules from TSM/Auctioneer? I farmed Transmog items and it would actually show its value like an achievement with session/goldperhour-breakdowns etc
---
Feral druids are by no means the worst spec/class in PvP. However, they can be challenging to master and it is not neccesarily a class that everyone will find fun. As a feral druid you will not stay in cat form at all times. In combat you must expect to shapeshift between cat/bear/healer frequently and in group PvP function as a support role by off-healing, CC etc. inbetween DPSing. Feral druids will also be in demand for group PvP as a WSG flag carrier. In solo PvP you can beat most classes, but it is more about outlasting your opponent with heals. The reason why feral druids are seen as weak is because they are a hybrid class aka jack of all trades. The cat form lacks many skills the rogue class has, and similarly with the bear/warrior.
---
I played a feral druid in vanilla and will play one in Classic as well.
---
Ah makes sence all I know is that's what they said they were doing
---
I’m fairly certain that if you actually farm MCPs for every raid, show up for almost every raid from MC/Ony to Naxx, have a good personality and have a joke like “I’m just here for atiesh in 2 years”....the guild will give it to you
---
I wonder if Defensive stance on Beta just makes you immune to crushing blows by default or something , cuz it does work like that for Tank Specs in Retail (Atleast it used to) when they removed Defense rating.
---
The main thing about it was the reset macro, and that doesn't work anymore.
---
The goal of Classic is to be as close to Vanilla as possible. *Not* give Vanilla veterans a nice challenge. If the numbers are as in Vanilla and the calculations are correct, that's how it should be, regardless of how easy or hard people find the game.
---
Has there been any information released about the number of servers that will be available? 
---
How are people planning to choose their server?
---
I used the live chat customer support [https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/316/979/channels](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/316/979/channels) Just got here by selecting forgot my password and email etc.
---
Pretty much this. Though the past week I've been putting mindless hours of fun into Torchlight II because I enjoy the dungeon crawling.
---
ah, alright. I agree. my bad.
---
I forgot all about this classic
---
Yeah, I’d rather give it to a mage or lock though, let them really shine with it.
---
idk suddenly the name of the sub changed to /r/gatekeeping and /r/imverysmart
---
My favorite part is how two more giant men seem to appear out of nowhere and they are so confident that the first guy can take that kid that they just kind of mosey over like they were aggrod but the kid was one shot.
---
Favorite thing is that there are multiple levels in there.  Lowbies helping where they can.
---
I don't remember any class being able to take an equal level elite toe to toe, at any level
---
button mashing like retail
---
Awesome. What level?

People say old school runescape is the same thing, people play it for nostalgia, meanwhile the games been out 6 years and is actually growing in player base. People underestimate how good we found games back then when it was real challenges. Not today’s grade challenges if i die during this it’s too hard, people want to be handed things.
---
A big thing I’ve noticed in osrs vs back then and now is efficiency. There is a massive emphasis on efficiency and I truly wonder if that’ll be same for classic. I understand it completely the target audience is no longer in grade school with nothing to do but go to school and game, we’re all much older with more responsibilities. I think it will be interesting see if there’s a shift in the community
---
Quest cap is 20 anyways so its going to give you what, a 1 level headstart?
---
I got a beta key and holy shit, that game sucks. I'd rather play retail lol
---
LFR Rocks, don't tell people how to play the game goober.
---
LOOOL Go back to BFA, they have a great quest helper there.
---
Thanks man, great explanation. I am looking forward to playing some classic. I hope it has a good run.
---
"I'll rip the secrets from your flesh!"
---
Yep, the game as a whole felt more connected when items pre lvl 60 were still very good at 60, and the fact that a lvl 49 could still kill a lvl 60 if they were super good geared and they were the favored class.
---
The problem later on was a max lvl would just oneshot anybody they fought even only a couple levels below them. The endgame/max lvl and the rest of the game became heavily disconnected.
---
Well this was lovely. Cheers for sharing.
---
Yea that's true, I just think that it would be awesome to potentially have a boss that takes forever to kill again. Nothing creates that classic mystique more then knowing that the ultimate bad guy is still out their alive and your servers top guilds are out there every night battling it out trying to take it down. Makes the world feel bigger and more alive than having him killed a couple hours into the raids release.
---
That’s where you are wrong, and we will be having the same discussion
---
Immortal kid vs green jesus
---
How do you know that no one on the beta is actually testing? I see this sentiment an awful lot on this forum, and it's always coming from people who seem extremely bitter.
---
You have no idea what's going on beyond what people are streaming. There is massive amounts of data being collected because of everyone in beta, even if they're just playing the game.
---
Yeah, i use those as well :)       
---
It was what sparked the idea to begin with, i wanted the gold/hour from loot appraiser but only the gold/hour and nothing else to begin with.       
---
Then it just snowballed.
---
You're gonna hate classic
---
Can I ask how? (Yes I'm being super lazy and could Google it).
---
Is he just a damn good engineer or did he use some black magic level shit?
---
Oh man, how delusional are you? Blizzard really hurt you, huh?
---
&gt;I can still hear "Burn in Righteous Fire!"
---
I havenn't heard that since pre cataclysm but it just popped up in my head like some repressed memory.
---
I vividly remember spending all my gold on Phantom Blade and Helm of Fire for my UD Rogue circa 2004. Nothing like securing a kill with a random Fireball as a Rogue 😂
---
If any of your RL buddies is going to play a healer then you will have a lot of fun as a warrior in PvP. However, if you expect to frequently play solo as well then rogue will be a better choice. Solo PvP as a warrior can be frustrating.
---
That sounds unhealthy
---
Idk if this is relevant but I was at a diner when I was 16 at like 2:30am with friends being stupid. Planning on messing with our waitress or anyone we encountered lol. Any who we noticed our busboy seemed really unhappy and he could barely speak English. He seemed really happy every time we came in to eat/talk to him though so eventually we started asking a lot of questions about him and his life. We found out he was living in a 1 bedroom apartment 4 miles up the road and he didn’t have a car. He worked 16hrs a day 6 days a week and only made 3.50/hr. I asked him if he got tipped off by the servers because I’ve heard that’s common? The answer was no. My little 4’11 friend worked harder than anyone I met in my life, walked 4 miles to work everyday on 3 hours of sleep to work 100+ hours a week. He trusted us enough to tell us he came here on a boat from Guatemala when he was 15 with his brother and has never been home since. Turns out he wasn’t as unhappy as we thought and he has a boyfriend he hangs with on Saturdays. I see him from time to time and he always has the biggest smile on his face.
---
No, but they’d act on it. If the data showed that Classic was where the money was, that’s where the investment would go.
---
Streamers willing to test viewer request bugs by class* although that’s still barely coherent, even without the 3rd grade capitalization and punctuation mistakes. Posts like this are making me dread all of the kiddos who will be there on launch, I mean I know we all were kids once but let’s be honest, we didn’t suck as much as kids do now and we certainly weren’t subject to twitch chat-induced brain atrophy like this poor guy
---
Programming is an amazing skill to have! :) Just a heads up; The API documentation is really scarce and all over the place. It looks like classic uses the same (mostly) API as retail - so you should lookup the docs for retail WoW. If you have any questions; let me know. Love to help people out (if i'm able to). Anyway - Good luck with the addon ;)
---
Do I smell Deeprun Rat Kabobs?
---
No matter what happens in your life you will find a way to be unhappy
---
In before Cataclysm legacy servers 🤮
---
Ow, I remember Wipe Club! That was the top guild on alliance side right?
---
Wasn't in the guild though, I played in the Twin Emperors.
---
You could swim up by using RMB and paning. But you could also jump. I remember it pretty well since I liked to swim in every water source I found. 9 year old me was easily amused.
---
How could you say something so controversial and yet so brave?
---
While I am beyond stoked for classic, and while I’ve been critical of the choices that led us to current retail, *not all changes were bad, and there were some gems in there*.
---
The hybrid classes being shoved into healing roles is the easiest to display case, but it wasn’t fun as a warlock being told that I had to be SM/Ruin in order to raid.
---
The mechanic that allowed tiered sets to be an upgrade to *your playstyle* was fucking excellent.  There was still optimal builds and paths, but an affliction lock wasn’t going to get scoffed at after a few set bonuses.
---
Classic is a chance to start fresh, keep the gems that were good choices and fuck the mistakes away.  Hopefully the community sees that.
---
I will be curious to know what documentation you are going through exactly and which software you will use to write your addon. Do you just do it in notebook/++ or you use something more tuned for Lua .  
---
So your addon will have a start button then keep track of the item you mine/fish/loot and calculate total value based on npc/live action house as well as an estimated gold/hour?
---
This is literally what they've said they are doing.

I mean, he's not wrong.
---
Are you for real? Mages never needed mana shield. I mained one from the original beta until half way into BC and mana shield was probably my most under-utilized ability in PvE.
---
He has been with them since they were working on classic. I have no idea about his general software engineering skills.
---
It's not for the taste, it's to rot away from the inside
---
Okay so it follows the same logic as marking a quest as an elite quest, ie with an array.
---
"special": ["cool comment", ["respec to shadowform dude", "https://www.wowhead.com/"]],
---
Hunters from other guilds would use Distracting Shot to pull aggro off of your tank. Dragon turns towards/chases the hunter and uses breath and tail AoE's on the dps/healers.
---
This makes me so excited.
---
I didn't. I am going herb alchemy mainly because I've never done alchemy before and after having played a priest being able to make your own mana potions is really nice. If I was going to do pvp I'd probably do engineering.
---
It's a very versatile class when used effectively. One of my best friends was feral druid in Vanilla and made rank 13. A lot of flag duty in WSG and watching the farm in AB. Missed out on a lot of honor kills but he still rocked it. Takes a lot of time but good druids are hard to kill.
---
The mods are all in the beta, leaving us on r/classicwow to fend for ourselves.
---
the pc and the monitor lol man i miss 2004-2006
---
I was a Warlock so we have to bust our butt getting the summons off, trying to get everyone ready.
---
Average wages in China more than quadrupled since Vanilla and the standard of living is now higher than in some European countries. 
---
If you were to setup a human gold sweatshop, it would be more likely to be in Ukraine or Bulgaria. But still that wouldn't be as efficient to just mass-bot your way to riches. You don't even need that impressive rigs to run 10+ instances of WoW. Just let the bots farm until they're detected, alter the software once banned, rinse repeat.
---
Keep on talking about 'Chinese' farmers, but most of them will actually just be botfarms in Kentucky.
---
Noone ever needs a farming alt. The amount of time one would have to spend farming on a mage or hunter in order to earn back the time it took to level it up is so high that it's almost impossible to come out ahead, so unless you already wanted to level an alt of that class anyway, it's pointless. Stuff like mining or grinding shitty mobs with a bad farming spec still brings in a baseline minimum of something like 20g/hour, so if it takes you maybe 150 hours to level an alt to 60, you'd have to farm 3k gold with it before you start to turn an actual profit on the time investment.
---
If a certain trend from private servers continues in Classic, prot warriors should have an easy time making money. Due to the severe shortage of tanks for dungeons, many players will agree to run a dungeon where the tank reserves all loot except things that are need rolls for others. It's kind of a greedy thing to do, but it's very profitable and probably more fun than endlessly farming the same shit for hours on end. Last time I played on a private server, it wasn't even considered particularly shady to do this, people can just choose not to join.
---
Where there is a strong NA bias on the internet as whole I havent seen a single person invited that is not from NA and all the people that have been invite - all the threads ive seen on reddit/discord/friends being invited are with old accounts that are from vanilla. Ofc I might be wrong since the info pool is small but so far 100% of the time is Vanilla NA accounts that get the invite
---
ok, if they arent the worst, who's worse than druid? (noone)
---
Why would it turn out anyone? If someone is making a big deal about it and it annoys you, just don't play with them...
---
What is a button down... T shirt?
---
yes druids are probably the worst class overall (if you want a realt talk opinion and not some wishful idealization some ppl have), feral cat pvp isnt a thing at all.
---
you just dont do enough damage, you dont have stun lock combo (maim isnt in the game), your stealth is trash and you move very slow in it, you dont have berserk or any cd to boost your damage, you dont have tigers fury to restor your energy, you are squishy as fuck in catform.
---
basically no one plays it. also feral it doesnt scale well with gear at all. so its not liek you can compesate the weakenes sof the design by getting a ton of highend gear. it still will suck about the same. 
---
PVP wise druids are good in 1v1 with a proper build and gear, cos you just run around self healing kiting, and slowly cheap awwy the opponent, basically outsurviving it. but you pretty much dont use cat form. 
---
Second thing, they are the best flagcarrier in wsg, and thats the role they excel at. cos they are super mobile. 
---
Third, wpvp you are good at surivivng again cos of insane mobility, but not at killing ppl really.
---
p.s. don't listen to idealistic ppl saying druids arent that bad, they are that bad, trust me.
---
I really miss the entire set up of them.. our guild only got one full set that they gave to me (was the MT) and I don't think I'll ever forget it.. scared my parents by yelling when my second binding dropped and then our entire guild spent the next couple weeks helping me farm out/find xmutes to complete it. When I turned it in there was over 100 people gathered to watch and ended up dueling at least 20 people with it.. I really wish I still had my screenshots and videos of it
---
Your videos deserve much more attention.
---
Ahh, didn't know if was say 10 warriors etc and wouldn't have to offtank
---
Of course. I was just referring to the post in that we would never be told if one was more successful, so speculating about something we'll never be able to confirm or deny is a waste of time.
---
That's what happened when blizzard started with "bring the player, not the class".
---
Although cataclysm probably had the best class balance of any expansion, it was still not perfect because at that point a lot of buffs were shared among classes.
---
I must apologize for Wimp Lo. He's an idiot. We have purposely trained him wrong.. as a joke.
---
From what I've seen from streams seems like Classic is easy mode.
---
Ye. I edited it to say T-shirt instead of T jus 4 u bby
---
Don’t have that, but I remember being ecstatic about getting the “Batman Shanker” back in the days. :)
---
It's more profitable for blizzard to just let them farm the gold, and make RCR &amp; Autosquelch do the heavy lifting of dealing with the gold spam.  
---
If they actually stopped, or greatly mitigated, the chinese gold farmers, they'd lose out on all the money they're going to make from gold spammers only being able to advertise once before getting autosquelched.
---
Well with world bosses the mechanics to wipe a group killing it were usually simple.  If people tried to help or interfere and died there was usually a debuff that hurt the people in the surrounding area or put you to sleep or reduced your ability to help in any way

---
I was blown away by the statue encounter for the first time
---
Ideally your MH should have slow speed for better damage ranges on SS/BS. Cruel Barb and Wingblade are decent early, then the SM quest reward sword then Trash Blade from Mara q is raid viable, though DR is better and Barman Shanker Backstab might be better than both depending on how damage is calculated
---
I remember a time or two, taking turns, but I was a warlock so had to bust out the summons and healthstones.. the memories..
---
I’m pregnant (due in October) so I might be able to squeeze some time in before....

There should definitely be a guild for us super casuals!

Take it easy little buddy
---
Will people in the beta get to keep their leveled character at launch?
---
In fact this is exactly what it is. You never hear about 95% of beta test because they are been done behind closed door, by specialised QA teams, often externally to have a fresh look. This is what you do when you want serious bug report.
---
When you want bug report + hype machine, you do a close beta with invite and no NDA.
---
You can brag if you want to lol. That wasn't easy to achieve back then!
---
&gt; Will people in the beta get to keep their leveled character at launch?
---
The dude is very appreciated because he sort of singlehandedly made a client (albeit buggy) work with patch 1.12 with Blizzard’s modern tools.
---
And reddit being reddit, it will be over glorified into godhood.
---
Say that to private servers.
---
Thanks for posting this. Really love the hype around this game - and yeah the drama is natural :D
---
Just get into boosting raids or smth. 2-3 tokens in one night of spaning CoS.
---
TL;DW This is a 41 minute powerpoint presentation.
---
Not sure why this is a video and not a podcast.
---
no that is clips I took from their twitch streams during this closed beta.
---
But this isn't a private server...
---
Resto druid is fine
---
Other then tranq shot hunter dps is kinda meh in raids it seems, is it viable for dungeons/10 mand because you can use SS and other debuffs too? Or is it still mediocre
---
/shoo
---
Awesome map! Thanks for the link
---
Does Lupos do shadow damage in the classic beta?
---
In terms of progress we were ranked 3rd on the nefarion kill. The top guild was a French one if I recall correctly. I recall a member, a paladin named Raphael wearing bis and showing off his judgment set. 
---
Wipe club migrated from horde in a different realm. Can't recall which though. 
---
But yeah they stayed competitive for long after I quit playing back then.
---
Yes, heal aggro gets split equally amongst all mobs and you're at range.  So if you have ret aura + thorns that is like 25 damage per hit reflected, 25 threat per mob. 
---
If you get healed for 150 and there are 6 mobs in range, the you'll only get threat on each mob of 12.5 as heals generate half the threat of damage.  So with a larger AOE pull the healer can actually stay quite low on threat tables considering how it is split out.  
---
Demo Shout, Battle shout, bloodrage can also generate AOE threat very well. 
---
Single target focus would be tough though!
---
If I were playing casually, I'd go with Mage or Hunter.  Mage for casual raiding, Hunter for casual leveling/farming.
---
No that's why many people wouldn't want to do the beta grind anyway, days and days of time played just for your character to be wiped and you start all over on 8.27
---
Its not even diablo. Its Diablo 3. The worst iteration.
---
Speaking of Diablo, unfortunately with how amazing POE has carried the torch, if Blizzard does remaster D2, it won't retain its playerbase for long. There are plenty of fan-modded D2 out there that has so many QOL improvements and balance changes over the years that I hope Blizzard actually adopts those instead of doing just a HD remaster.
---
That's true. D2 had such interesting stats. D3 was ruined the moment main stats such as str, int and agility were what really mattered the most outside the crit and critical hit damage.
---
It was always pointless, because devs surely beat those boss before they were even release.
---
he does use taunt 13 seconds into the clip

Many of the players were young when it was out they are going to be far from experts just because of how much time has passed and their age. Plus, from what we've seen in beta, private servers were fairly different then what beta is so far. I was playing Vanilla on dialup part of the time on a computer with below minimum system requirements to play. I imagine I ought to be much better this time around. Welcome abroad. It's a great game to meet and help others. The community is the best part, despite some of the randos on here being overly negative/toxic.
---
There was a chines golf farmer named Ek in my guild back in vanilla, a human priest. I remember that ni hao quirky bastard so well. He was notorious in our guild as being "that farmer from China" but his random smiley faces and occasional herb donations to my alchemist Paladin made him a joy.
---
Lmao idk why this made me chuckle.
---
I assure you Warlock will not be overplayed in raids. If you want an easy casual class that you can get into raids with, go with Mage. Frost Mages literally just spam Frostbolt over and over, they're reasonably easy to pre-raid BiS gear with some Tailoring, there are always a lot of spots for Mages, and their upkeep is very cheap with conjured food, low repairs, etc.
---
I personally loved cata. It’s the best time I had in the game second to Vanilla.
---
Shut up lmao
---
add enchanting and you're set.
---
Deleted for prosperity's sake. Didn't mean to derail this harmless thread with a grammar joke! Carry on.
---
Been playing druid for 2 years on priv servers and im probably maining one in classic. With that said, if you're on here asking if you should roll a druid or not, the answer is most likely no. And judging by your description you should probably go rogue
---
Thanks
---
Both, the emails can be delayed. Likely to show up on launcher first.
---
Wait until you find out the defias brotherhood's origins..
---
I'm constantly rotating through /r/classicwow, Morhau, /r/classicwow, maybe retail (probably not), back to Mordhau (with /r/classicwow open on another monitor).
---
Borderlands 2 replay is in there somewhere too.
---
Funny seeing so many people know so little about this game and how threat work.
---
Just watching Asmon is enough. All he has to do is use Battle Shout for infinite start-up threat against mobs he can't hit.
---
&gt; Because you get higher framerates that way.
---
Literally every machine made in the last 10 years should run Vanilla at whatever your Monitor can take, multi threading or not.
---
People say that private servers got it wrong and vanilla was easier, but I think the real point is that private servers are *already too easy*. PUGs regularly clear every raid save for AQ40 and Naxx
---
Can you /lol while swimming in the water?
---
Carebears.
---
I used it until around level 25ish. There's so much hidden stuff that I accepted I would never find so I turned it on.
---
I dunno, I'm in the beta and almost everyone I've talked to has an early vanilla account. There are players from other expansions too but they are in the minority for sure.
---
I just think a t-shirt is a completely different thing than a button down
---
Things like this will never happen without streamers and that's the exact reason why I'm rolling on a streamer server.
---
I really hope he browses this sub lmao
---
Yeah, majority of us are with ya 
---
Blizz wants me to pay them $15 for a beta raffle ticket, no thanks.
---
I think he’s using modern graphics
---
He’s not using a shield tho?
---
27th for europe
---
At least your from the US, more chance of getting in compared to EU ( Sad face)
---
I really hate these annoying carebear posts, shut the fuck up already.
---
Not a perfect analogy by far, but I think defeating raidbosses/gaining pvp ranks could be comparable to "clearing levels" in her head.
---
And gathering gear is just a means to get there.
---
I would have or play Warcraft 3 (or play it with her).  That will be more accessible for her from a typical "beat the game" kind of video game, and perhaps she'll see along the way how games can develop characters and stories instead of just points.
---
After you finish WC3, explain to her that WoW takes place 4 years after the events of that game, and that conflicts are happening again -- heck, maybe even just watch [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0) with her..  This time, instead of a player controlling hundreds of units, she has the opportunity to *be a character* within that world.  There are tons of smaller adventures to be had on a solo or small group basis, and the "big picture" is still at play, too.  Instead of playing through a set story, this time she gets to decide her own.
---
I actually just downloaded and started on Elysian Netherguard. Are these private servers actually Poppin? Would be nice to be a semi classic experience before it actually comes out. So far it seems awesome.
---
What is Blizzard's policy on reserved runs in classic? If I see another sellables res run ever again I'm gonna flip.
---
Private servers bad
---
Love it!
---
What about the people like me who were invited in the first wave and don't stream?
---
All of this is true aside from make plans with the squad ): I have nobody to play with, all of my buddies quit like 7-8 years ago and would probably laugh if I asked them to play lmao. Hoping to make buddies at launch sometime.
---
1. Does Classic need a different client to be played?
---
2. Which graphical aspect is definitely better?
---
Stop it with the unoriginal meme spamming
---
I don't understand why people hate this place, I love it, Back in vanilla and on private servers. With a good guide you can get it done ( Upper and lower ) in under an hour and a half.  And if you do it at 50 with all the quests ( not including class quest ) the full run + quests is a whole level, which is insane.
---
Plus you can get a couple of BiS pre raid items in there such as Gloves of Healing/Shadow/Frost damage ( even fire for PvP ) and the Draketalon rings ( Which people forget aren't Unique ).
---
Okay I took out the T in front of T-shirt. Now it just says button down shirt.
---
What is your reasoning?
---
Ty
---
:( I think at least a good portion of that age group can appreciate classic wows design philosophy, I'm 21 and I didn't give wow a shot til wrath and didn't even have a sub til mop but I grew up with 2006-2011 era runescape and can appreciate a slower but more rewarding mmo. I was completely sold on classic after giving a private server a shot for about 30 levels.
---
\&gt;no addons
---
\&gt;no map
---
\&gt;no macros
---
yeah I don't think everything on this list applies to classic
---
Did anduin become immortal?
---
How far down the shitter has the lore become.
---
I was a shaman and reached lvl 15 before i found out how to get my totem.
---
That came with Legion IIRC.
---
Hunter DPS is actually pretty good in MC and BWL, atleast on par with Warlocks and Mages (single target) and has a very high skill ceiling due to auto attack clipping and pet management. During leveling and in 60 dungeons Hunters are very good DPS because your pet is just that strong. I wouldnt worry about getting invited to groups/raids when you put the time in to become decent at your class.
---
Currently reading Programming in Lua first edition until i get my hands on the fourth edition, and several tutorials/how-to's to check for differences.         
---
Reading about the API on wowwiki.fandom.com since it seemed up to date because of bfa additions.
---
Using Zerobrane Studio(reccomended on Lua's site) to play around and try out things for now, was planning to hop over to notebook++ later on since it seems more suitable to me personally.
---
The addon would in essence be a session-based statistics collector that resets automatically when you log out or close the game.
---
Once you press the 'Start' button, it would start timers and start updating based on events in the inventory mostly.      
---
The gold/hour that i **want** would be based on whichever value is highest: Vendor price, tsm MinBuyout or tsm MinBuyout for whatever the likely material you get for disenchanting the item is.
---
The reason they won't give people the old client is the same reason why Classic is based on the new client. There are way too many security flaws and would not support the current infrastructure. From the realm servers to the content distribution servers, everything would have to be rebuilt. Down porting the new client to Classic was the lesser of two evils. 
---
There's much less (almost zero) risk to altering game files rather than trying to recreate 13 years of Server Infrastructure, including but not limited to bot detection, Battle.net integration, &amp; security vulnerabilities.
---
I would much rather have an ability do 2 more damage than it did in Vanilla than have my credit card information stolen.
---
Never used any and won't in the future.     
---
I leveled three characters to 60 back in the day and four on private servers over the years. 
---
Most quests I know and those that I don't remember I usually figure out myself or look up on sites like wowhead.
---
I actually just bought one again too, I couldn't find my old one to save my life and figured I should buy it now before the price rises too high. It's already gone up $15 on Amazon lol
---
in the context of VIDEO GAME BUGS bozo
---
They suck even with bis gear. If you’re enhancement in my raid I’d ask you to heal
---
You can’t kill children was his point
---
The game truly starts at lvl 1, as opposed to retail where 1-120 is a glorified demo.
---
No better time to start than with classic.
---
When is the last time something  this happened in retail wow?
---
Why ??
---
It came out in 2006, I remember using it and it was pretty accurate.
---
It's the atlas :)
---
if not the worst, one of the worst at least, who's worse? prot warrior is quite useless aswell. 
---
any other specs are better (which is like 20-30). so not sure what did you mean "by no means the worst". who's worse than them? i couldnt find an example.
---
I raided during vanilla. I don’t remember anything about as being casual. If you missed a scheduled raid or left early or came unprepared you lost your spot. Especially true for “easy classes” since there was always someone waiting to grab your spot.
---
People say blizzard has a 100% genuine oldschool 1.12 vanilla server up and running to compare with. is this really true? link to source?
---
warlocks will never be overplayed, plus it's pretty easy to swap in/out if you can't make every raid
---
spriest is trash shaman dps is trash ret pally is trash ( unless your esfand) .... compared to these druid is good :)
---
Oh that's right :)
---
I just knew they made Turalyon immortal so I thought maybe that happened to Anduin too.
---
Best in my peen
---
Wait that's not right
---
How do you figure?
---
I just wish they announced when a new wave went out..
---
Hey, thanks, that's real nice of you.
---
Currently reading through the API on wowwiki.fandom.com since it seemed to be the most up to date and easily available.
---
ok cool there was one that came out in 2003-2004 thats way off on alot so was just checking
---
I remember downloading nihilium fighting magtheridon in tbc. Was a long video file download which I left on all night
---
This, the classic is here to stay is the best thing about all of this. It's by Blizzard and the community loves it, so it's not going anywhere 🙏 gives us the time and freedom to enjoy it and do whatever we want, nostalgia for days.
---
Kinda blows me away how vanilla wow, touted then as *very much* the easy every-man's MMO, has this reputation for being brutally hard now. Everything's got to be perfect or the entire house of cards will fall. Miss that CC? It's a wipe. I've been playing the beta and even I don't feel like there's a real difference in play between my mage back in vanilla and now. Vanilla wow was more difficult than modern wow, but that's not a hard metric to beat. The systems were more immature and so were we. Sure my memories of difficulty are influenced by nearly 15 years of the passage of time (as is everyone else's), but I do not remember it being as brutal as everyone is reaching for and seemingly demanding to see now. 
---
Flat out, if someone has played on private servers then their opinions of classic numbers are very suspect from the outset. The things we think we remember are very often not how things happened, especially as time goes on. We're all susceptible to this. It's very easy for people to mix up details from long periods of time and conflate them with more older memories. 
---
Wow wasn't hard. You could survive packs without full CC especially in the earlier dungeons even if it was a bit hectic at times. Vanilla wow is the epitome of "in my day you had to go to school up hill in the snow both ways". Except now someone pulled out an old video camera of grandpa walking to school one day and you see him coasting along a flat road on skateboard with barely more than sprinkles coming down from the sky.
---
N O
---
Late to the party but, here are my thoughts.
---
They might be lower than the collective "we" remember but, I think they are probably close to what they were for later patches.  I didn't roll an alt until late vanilla, I do recall cc being more of a necessity due to the lack of skill, gear, levels, and/or markers.  It was much easier to get inexperienced players to focus kill mobs if they only had one target.  I do remember in mid 40s dungeons cc was required even with my friends, as we were all in dps leveling specs with terrible healing/tanking gear.  Healers were at a premium and were always under leveled for those dungeons.
---
TL;DR - Player skill and over all knowledge of the game are far greater combined with late vanilla gear tweaks and dungeon nerfs are probably the difference.
---
My daughter will be almost 2 when classics out. I expect itll take me awhile to hit 60, and in case of a poo emergency, I'll just feign death and hope lol.
---
I normally sleep around 2 am, so that gives me from roughly 10pm to play. Nights I work, I'll be getting 2 hours of play in.
---
The craziest thing about it is no one is 100% scientifically sure when shit is actually broken or not. This is an obvious bug, but there are tons of other things that there is just absolutely no definitive way to check because we simply don't have all the information we need to make it a fair test.
---
What I know as a beta player: it feels like vanilla. I don't know if the bears I'm killing in Duskwood did 3 more damage when I did this 15 years ago, but I do know if I try to pull 2 of them and they're higher level than me I will probably die. That seems about right.
---
Like in any form entertainment, the point is to enjoy yourself. There are many different reasons to enjoy yourself in WoW. Walking in a huge fantasy world. Taking part in the clash of power between the different races. Acquiring better looking/stronger gear. Acquiring and showing off your collection of exotic mounts. Taking part in epic battles against bosses or players. Going on an impossible adventure with your friends. Grieving other players by camping their corpses. As long as it pumps endorphine through your veins you don't need one definite goal to justify your playing.
---
Unfortunately not, Lupos was changed in 1.7 I think, not sure exactly which patch but it was before 1.12 which is what classic is based on.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Why ? As a Ud is if faster than barrens at 10
---
Waves are daily and stress test dates are already set in stone (you can expect lots of invites during this period).
---
i dont play to use any addons except swing timer im going to be leveling a ret pally and having the swing timer is going to help a bit but other then that nope no addons at all till i hit 60 and start raiding at that time i will download the addons i need but nothing more
---
It's a game. 
---
"why?". ^(to have a good time you potato. that simple.)
---
I actually just downloaded Elysian private server Netherguard PVP and it's awesome. Starting zones are full of people too, seems alot of people are doing this who didn't get Beta. It'll do the job until I can get Beta or August. Highly recommend.
---
I'll probably use an addon for bags, and that's about it.  Maybe Damage/Threat meters later on.
---
*native American cries
---
I'm really hoping I'll have the will power to not use add ons. I never used any at all in Vanilla, and it was a more immersive experience for it. I'm hoping I'll be able to resist the urge to rush to cap with shortcuts.
---
When were the last few attempts made to DDoS Blizzard and they buckled?
---
I mean the reason it’s not on auto shoot macro is in dungeons you will often pull a mob with your body to pull it back but if you send a pet in it will pull more mobs because it goes to the target not where you tank is also in world pvp druids will just hibernate and entangling roots your pet if you send it in too early
---
You are cold blooded! QQ
---
Running dungeon's is bad idea,
---
 fastest way would be skinning, mining or herbs.
---
Alchemy was popular too for transmutes,
---
 same with blacksmithing for enchanting rods
---
Enchanting is bad to make money.
---
There may be under 10 people worldwide who achieve this in classic
---
Im going to have wowhead  archives up, that will be my leveling addon lol
---
Well obviously, he had to Photoshop it so he could blur out his login details.
---
It‘s actually one of the best race/class choices you can make. You can raid as ele/heal and you will have a safe raidspot. Easy to gear and when you approach endgame ele is just too fkn strong in PvP. Orc racial is self-explanatory. Also premades will love you. 10/10 my choice as well
---
Let's be honest, using a swing timer add-on is on the same level as using an enemy cast bar add-on. 
---
Not saying I won't use one or the other, just saying you might not be as pure as you think.
---
Thought id settled on my class and now it's in the air again! Although thought I may have read somewhere about the totem macro not being a thing any more? I could be wrong though. How annoying is having to keep stocked up on ammo?
---
Rogues do actual DPS in raids
---
It was actually better for AoE than Volley if I remember right. You jump in and start using melee abilities to get it to proc.
---
They talked about it [during the Blizzcon Panel last year](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=520) when they spoke about why they'll use the modern client instead of the old one.
---
I tried to answer your post on three different ways and I still dont know how to explain it.
---
World of Warcraft is just like life - you can fuck around doing nothing, you can become biggest villain on your realm, you can become a pious Paladin fighting evil beings in the very core of Azeroth, you can have tons of fun without ever stepping into a raid. You can collect stuff, pick herbs, take a stroll through a forest. It's a journey and you just have to feel it, every quest you do is a part of this fantasy world. There is a reason why this game has sucked so many people in - because it is like our life, but much more fair. Games (especially MMOs) are way more fairer than life - it's just your skill, your dedication, your goals. Part of me has always loved fantasy genre so maybe that's it :)
---
there's most definitely different macros for leveling and dungeons. But in chaotic wpvp like that, you are definitely just sending the pet...
---
Hunter does 240 + 50 DPS when Rogue does 400
---
At least I'm self-aware!
---
Well I’m glad he does physical damage.  I’ve lived through the torment of leveling as a warrior on a pserver where Lupos did do shadow damage and Lupos was on a 10 min respawn so every hunter on the server had him. World pvp was busted af.
---
I'd hope so
---
For my first 60 I'm not going to use Quest Helper. For alts, probably.
---
I'm a zoomer and i believe classic is superior in literally every way. Maybe not mechanically but thats about it
---
Story of my life. I'm trying to break the spell. I'm trying to tell myself to just be patient. IM TRYING
---
Hunters aren’t good early where did you get this information? If anything hunter is better late
---
No addons, I’m going in raw
---
Is sucralose just as bad as sugar?
---
Hunters kite
---
The problem with this philosophy is that the pre-60 leveling content is the majority of the game. It is much more important that this is tested than raid content that will be experienced by far less people.
---
The pet will die even if you micro it really well
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one feeling like this.
---
i don't really care about stress testing, i want to play this beta for months, and level at least 4 char to 30
---
I'm guessing metric.
---
Oh baby, I've got blessing of protection
---
3 times over here. Both my boys are looking forward to seeing what dad is so excited about.
---
&gt;Mine is 4
---
An acceptable age for a PvE server.   But when she turns 5, you better be bumping her up to a PvP server!  ./s
---
Have anyone confirmed if rogue poison proccs get damage from +nature damage gear ?
---
&gt; So trying to do everything first and as fast a possible is pointless because it’s a meaningless achievement.
---
Most raiding guilds in any expansion are not going for world firsts...
---
You want to do it faster because, why would you want it to take longer? It's a game, the goal is to kill the bosses, why take longer than you have to?
---
I don't know what happened man, I went from 'Eh I'll play it when it releases' and not really caring all that much to an insane amount of hype.  My body is ready.
---
Im good, thanks
---
Where is the source that it is exactly like vanilla
---
They are yeah, good place to practice.
---
Yep. I’ve been jumping between a bunch of different games all week. Tales of Vesperia, Cookie Clicker, Zoombinis, Unreal Tournament 2001, League of Legends, Eggs, Inc...
---
Man I really have been playing a little of everything
---
I'll mess with UI add-ons (buttons, name plates, bags). That's probably it.
---
US here yea, account was created back at launch so that is probably the driving factor but I cant help but think the cancellation triggered it
---
How many simple question Sundays are left before classic hits? I can’t be bothered to work it out myself
---
Warlock is pretty common for the pet and soulstones most locks dont make it to max level tho ( private server)  on retail i feel like it will be the same...now for casual player that wants to raid i would go either resto druid or even a hunter for the enraged purge additionally i would like to say every class is good for casual raiding just pick the right role i would also say that tanking and healing are fairly demanding especially if you have loot cancel or DKP in classic ( my guild will ) this is going to require you to be at every boss kill to get good gear ( as a healer or tank) so i would recommend a dps class instead, But this is a game and you are free to do what you want this is just my 2 cents
---
Cu German ^ ^
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm under no misconceptions about the video game industry and would never work in it. But godDAMN if this is not a cool project! It's like digital archaeology.
---
Could you imagine running into code that you wrote almost 15 years ago fresh out of college? Even now there's times when I look at month old code and think "I'm such a dumbass".
---
Source? This comment seems like you pulled it straight from the depths of your asshole
---
Of course he is duh argent Dawn is a RP PvE server so no one would have been flagged.
---
I don’t believe it
---
I love stuff like this
---
I have no idea, I havent played retail in along while. I was just saying that because Thrall has been killed and I dont think you can kill kids in the game.

Alright sick the world is a better place now
---
As a player who has been playing on and off since vanilla and is still subbed, your experience resonates with me a lot.  I like wow in BFA because I enjoy the mechanical depth of the classes (not as good as it used to be, but it's still better than any other mmo I can find) and the boss mechanics.  The loot, accessibility, anonymity, and grinds of modern wow are all garbage and after trying out a private server for a short while, I was amazed by how much fun I was having just auto-attacking things.  It's given me hope that Classic will be a huge success, that blizz will reintegrate many of the core systems into modern wow, and we'll get the best of both worlds back, but that may be just a pipe dream.

I think there have been 3 waves so far plus the initial one. At first it was mostly streamer then they sent waves on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday around 6pm PST. There must be up to 2000 people on the beta ATM if you consider there are about 300 people in asmongold guild so I would imagine 500 on the server alliance side, I think he is on the pvp server which must be more populated than the PvE server.   
---
It is mostly or almost exclusively people with a NA account, whether they had an account dating back from the early days of wow or not , whether they remained subbed active or not depends a lot, maybe because they get people with different pov.   
---
The hope is for another wave on Monday, tonight is unlikely.
---
The misspellings and all caps add so much to this image.

Probably 14.

Oh man, memories.

Nice upvoted i was under the impression that people were imagining things good post.

You have brought balance to the force, Kanye.

it's not just about the killing in pvp

It was a massive poll that garnered many answers over the course of a week or so.

Yep, not gunna worry about professions really but just get the quest down so when launch day comes I know where everything is.

After that long of a break, your account may have been archived. This happened to me when I came back during WoD. I had to contact customer service to get my characters back.

---
Are those the pants?
---
I plan on using one. The problem with not using one is that everyone else will be using on. We’re seeing this on pvt servers right now. People with the addon will be looking for a group for a quest, and they will link the quest. You normally couldn’t link the quest in vanilla, you need the addon for that. If you don’t have it, you won’t know what quest they’re talking about.
---
I feel like because everyone else will use it, you’d handicap yourself by not using it as well.
---
It is
---
Someone’s mad, lol! Never played an expansion with LFR goober, gonna enjoy that questhelper tho ;)
---
Na I'm using quest helper + extended questlog + a leveling guide. I've done 1 to 60 far too many times on private servers and I just don't care about immersion anymore. All I care about is speed. I gotta hit 60 in sub 5 days at least.
---
No information yet but name reservation will open up on aug 13th so we should get a server list before then at least. 
---
I'm picking RP-pvp if it exists. Otherwise I'm just gonna pick a random PvP and cross my fingers.
---
You can’t dual wield as a shaman.
---
Yes, it is. It was confirmed.

ok thank

From his twitter, someone asked;

&gt; Hey man, hope you're doing well. Will you be playing classic?

and he answered;

&gt; That's the plan! Actually preparing for it all as we speak! :)

Kungen is obsessed with US politics these days. I'm not sure if he still cares for WoW anymore.
---
Or are you handicapping yourself by using one and not getting a more enjoyable experience. I get it, some people want to rush to 60. And I'm not saying I want to go slow, I love endgame, but I also want to get the most out of my leveling experience.
---
My server had some Chinese farmers, the only one I remember is a Night Elf rogue named Lovekiss.  This guy would farm Blackrock Stronghold over and over and I remember him using two Hanzo Swords.  Eventually, he joined a raiding guild and got a Brutality blade.  He was so happy.

He kept farming Blackrock Stronghold

Thank you! As i understand it, they found 1.12 backend database data (of dmg values, spawnrates etc) and art assets. (but the client?). I'm trying to figure out if they really have it all. If so, the beta is simply for people to point out X is wrong, and blizz goes and check with old version? Thats all the beta is then. (Blizzard has no use of old youtube footage at all, they just check the old backup). The task blizzard has is stitching all the pieces together with the new stack
---
This made my day, ty!
---
Don't admit to this here, people get super pissy. I did something similar with an account that was sold then suspended sitting dormant for 12years. According to the moral police here that makes me the literal worst person on earth.
---
Main benefit being a stable server population, which outweighs any negative. Grow up.
---
The good old days when Sylvanas was still a night elf. 
---
...
---
A trauma she never recovered from, judging by the whole Teldrassil thing.
---
It's VERY obvious that elite mob damage in dungeons is too low, maybe even compared to the way I remember it in TBC and Wrath.  No, it doesn't have anything to do with the fact that players are better today than they were back then, which IS A FACT, but is still absolutely irrelevant and doesn't change the fact that people are tanking 4-5 mobs of their level or even a level or two above them WITHOUT a shield, and they barely need healing. Watch Soda's and Tipsout's run of Gnomeregan and SM GY,  Tips was wearing a 2H weapon most of the time and they were pulling packs of 4-5 mobs that are lvl30-32, and BARELY needed healing, Soda was literally  looting and alt-tabbing out of the game looking at loot tables during fights, and just occasionally throwing a heal or two on people. Not once did he have to cast 2 or 3 big heals one after another even during these bigger pulls with no CC. That was not the case in Vanilla. I know that for sure because I played a warrior in Vanilla, leveled a warrior three times actually, twice to mid 30 level and once to lvl60 which was my main later on, and I always tanked in dungeons, always had decent gear, etc. but damage received was much higher.   Tanking even 2 elites of the same level without a shield would mean a healer would have to pretty much spam heals, doing that with 4-5 mobs would be impossible. 
---
Not to mention that these elites sometimes hit warlocks, priests or mages, and barely do any damage at all. It seems that a lvl30 warlock can take 5-6 hits from a lvl30 elite before being killed. That's not how it was in Vanilla, absolutely without any doubt. You'd get killed with 2, maybe 3 hits at most, which is why we all had threat meters even in 5 mans, since pulling aggro would pretty much mean you're dead as a cloth dps class unless the tank would manage to regain aggro in time. 
---
Now to the biggest point I want to make. Even if we're all delusional and remember Vanilla as being harder than it actually was, and Classic beta is PERFECTLY reproducing how Vanilla was, I think we can all agree that the current state of Classic is STILL TOO EASY when it comes to elite mobs. They just don't really feel like elites and for that reason the dungeons feel as easy as they do, everyone playing the game pretty much universally agrees with that, big streamers mentioned several times during their runs that the elites feel far too easy to handle. I mean, it's almost like killing Mongrels in Redridge Mountains is more challenging than clearing out DM or Stockades.
---
Fair enough. Nothing wrong with that.
---
I mean, yes they did, but not according to this list?
---
You can't send by mail but you can trade someone else the food and then have them trade you back.
---
Hopefully all this bs gets fixed or this game is screwed.
---
There's a stress test scheduled for Wednesday, so I'd expect more invites to go out then?
---
I dont know where you got your source, but these words are very refreshing to see..
---
who is going to run SM cath over and over for the tabard....( i think it was cath it was in) i know im going to get it and rep it forever lol
---
It works in very specific algorithms though. I've seen countless successful attempts at promoting mass-upvoting for a specific picture to be on top of Google, which seemingly had worked, but which wasn't the case when you Googled in Europe and other specifics instances.
---
I'm og and I can guarantee people are just as fucking clueless as I am about accuracy.
---
I know myself. I know most of the quest objective locations from memory, but for those I don’t, I’ll just look it up on WoWhead. I won’t spend 30-45 min looking for one quest. If I’m gonna look it up, might as well make it easier and use the addon.
---
You'd really think someone like that wouldn't have the grammar of a 5 Year old.
---
Same. I’ll be your buddy :)
---
I have no doubt about that. Just wanted to point out that without a dedicated gpu it won't be smooth:)
---
Isn't every hit a crush or a crit?
---
That sounds awful haha, my first time leveling was on a PVE realm so I never had that problem!
---
Afaik the only unique pets in by 1.12 were brokentooth (1.0 attack speed), Snarler who has 100 of each spell resist and (sort of) son of hakkar. Son of hakkar was just a wind serpent but taming one was the only way to learn lighting breath rank 6.
---
There was also some janky stuff with King bangalash and him retaining cobra reflexes after he was tamed but it would disappear if you respected him. I can't remember when that was changed/fixed.
---
Narr they won’t even try because there’ll always be people ready to spoil the fight. Streamer will have a very boring time attempting playing classic.
---
But by being entertaining(to some) did he not earn his place? Get outta here with that.
---
You need some balance but not cookie cutter stuff. TBC and wotlk were pinnacles of balance. Each tank and healer had a purpose. Most dps were viable or had buffs that we're needed. 
---
I miss those days. Classic is not for me simply because my favorite classes can't raid.
---
Classic is more slow paced strategic thought on your actions. 
---
Modern is fast paced instant reward style gameplay. 
---
Classic is new player and casual friendly and more community driven. People won’t kick you for making a few mistakes because it takes a long time to form a group and travel to the dungeon. 
---
Modern is casual friendly but noobs get blasted with “get gud, raider io sucks, do you even rotation bro?” And then vote kick you before you have a chance to learn anything.
---
Ion said that nobody was sure if the old assets could be used on the modern engine which was necessary to use 15 years of security, bug, and stability fixes (basically to run old wow on their modern infrastructure). 
---
Omar locked himself away for a few weeks and was able to make the new wow engine understand the old assets (buggy and unstable, but running none the less). At that point, the team realized it was possible to create classic wow using mostly the modern engine and tools with some work to fix the bugs and problems.
---
Hoggers lore litteraly makes him a monster lol
---
I'm chill
---
Nice. Now Amazon shipping needs to hurry the hell up lol.
---
That's a good point for swapping in and out. Healers and tanks were more gear critical for raids
---
Google is your friend. There was one last year, several pretty back to back around the launch of legion. There are a number of others too. Blizzard is a big target, it's not exactly hard to expect this to happen.
---
You have picked one of the worst roles you can pick if you really want to experience everything.
---
Tanks are in super high demand early, but once dungeon content is done for tanks obviously tend to not want to do it much. That means you end up having a lot of guilds with multiple tanks suddenly find themselves only needing two or three.
---
This doesn't mean it's not possible just be aware that it's one of the most difficult roles to fill because the supply and demand goes up and down like a yoyo depending on progress.
---
As for "what is horde like" well... It's exactly the same as alliance except substitute Paladins for Shamans. That might seem like a sarcastic answer but honestly that's all it is. We all have good players and bad, toxic players and lovely people. Etc etc.
---
Alliance have a much easier time with threat in PvE because of paladins and they also have a much easier time healing in PvP because of paladins. Its not enough to mean alliance always wins or horde always loses but its a difference you should be aware of.
---
I doubt they'll do it. But if they did I still think C'thun would go down very quickly. You'd have to do a few attempts till you got good RNG where tentacles didn't spawn in unreachable places. It's not a big deal, pre-nerf C'thun would still die within 2 hours of AQ opening.
---
I get what you are saying, but using an add-on to circumvent looking something up is one of the reasons Blizzard has implemented all of the features that people hate.
---
They added Dungeon Finder so people didn't have to look for a group, for example.
---
&gt; people linking basic greens to anyone who wants it and fellow guild members chomping at the bit to take them.
---
Man, it seems so tiny in comparison to epic raid progression and such, but this is the kind of interaction and new friendship I can't wait to build.  Helping people out just for the sake of being helpful.  Giving 5g to a friend to respec and asking nothing in return because you know if the tables were turned, they'd have your back, too.
---
What a nice strawman. It's more like that classic actually wasn't that good bro. People who said mythic and do harder content never really wanted classic. It's fun, but there's no challenge in endgame, especially since the mechanics are way more simplistic. TBC and wotlk were huge for a reason and had way more subs for a reason.
---
Vanilla WoW was designed for newcomers and casuals of the MMO genre. If you've played some MMOs before you'll have no issue getting into Classic.
---
Off topic, we need to come with a name for the original retail vanilla wow to differenciate from Classic (the one in beta right now) and Vanilla (the private server version).
---
I agree with you by the way, I'm a nobody but 15 years ago my priest could easily handle one same-level elite, my warrior could handle two, my hunter would cruise through three on autopilot.
---
I remember chinese farmers were chaining pulls in Hearthglen or Tyr's Hand, and those places were filled with elites.
---
Precisely. They knew it would be impossible to recreate the game 100% with so much being lost and changed over the years. You also want people to be able to play and not have the servers crash or colorblind people getting screwed etc.

---
It doesn't matter if the old client is full of bugs and exploits. It's not like they are going to sell it to their customers. Even if somebody cheats their way to millions of gold it doesn't matter since everything is temporary.
---
"Dude its part of the experience, not being able to play"
---
It's actually not in place on the beta but it will be on the actual launch.
---
They have the client for 1.12. that's pretty trivial. For example all the private servers that have been around for years use the same 1.12 client.
---
What the private servers don't have though is all the databases. Blizz said they found that data and are using it with the 1.12 client for cross reference. So yes they can play the game exactly as it was back then according to themselves.
---
I just want to sheep someone into Old Ironforge
---
At this point I'm convinced Herod's shoulder is a myth, and it never really existed.
---
No worries, half the fun is finding new people to group with :). I always roll a priest as my main so I will be looking to run with groups constantly. (And find a mage buddy because of the free foods haha)
---
&gt; but the client?
---
The client is easy enough to come by. After all it was required for every private server. The only thing that was missing all these years was the backend stuff.
---
&gt; If so, the beta is simply for people to point out X is wrong, and blizz goes and check with old version?
---
Pretty much.     
---
The old footage is still useful though, since the community can evaluate which reports are likely to be true or are false due to people misremembering or private server information. Ultimately it helps us disprove false reports which hopefully leads to more correct reports on the beta.
---
Aww. You think ganking as (UD) rogue is autistic. How autistic of you. GL on the PvE servers ;)
---
Tips was tanking groups of 4-5 lvl30-31 mobs in SM WITHOUT A SHIELD, he was wearing the whirlwind axe pretty much the whole time, while Soda was fucking around with loot and barely had to heal at all.  He is not THAT geared. Even in literally BIS gear for lvl30, he's still get destroyed by 5 mobs with no shield at the same time back in vanilla.
---
Then petition Blizz to ban these addons. I don’t like questhelper and dungeon finder either, but I’m not gonna kneecap myself compared to the majority of players.
---
We always had PvE servers too?
---
Your Ryzen cpu is still gonna chug more than enough FPS for classic WoW.
---
Shaman can earthbind kite and searing totem while shocking and using 5 sec rule to regen mana. Hunters be hunting. I can see druids doing it as well with a smart tactic due to their versatility.
---
Huh?
---
I've avoided retail for a while, so maybe I'm out of the loop. But are you saying there aren't PvE servers on retail anymore?
---
Yeah I was wondering why so many people wanted in. That was the only reason I could think they would
---
Asmongold is rolling on a pve server and Soda on pvp.
---
Blizz won't manage that. It's up to the community. If you don't like it you can start your own run.
---
Dps &gt; stats.
---
On hit &gt; stats.
---
Big swords &gt; small swords
---
What about the security flaws? What about the old engine not running on modern hardware? How about they don't owe it to anyone to do it?
---
The interesting thing is themechanic has been owning on the server he got the past few guru trinkets and he wasn’t a streamer before the server he just got happened to get invited and started streaming because he wanted to show his brother him playing. Also he doesn’t get any help from being a streamer because only 100 people watch him so people don’t have beta. The only people that play with him are because he got the second lvl 30 and has been a really active and well known player on the server (also all these people are really good most geared 30s on the server). This could be a reality in classic as well where certain players just known for being good group with other really good players and match up fairly well to streamer followers.
---
My friend has been playing WoW for 2 months and got in while I've had an account since the end of vanilla and did not get in.
---
Ugh. And apparently complaining of streamsnipers anytime world PvP affects their progress...
---
...reasons I don’t follow streams
---
DAE energy drinks and bacon are healthier than whole grains and fruit?!?
---
Be happy about it! Imagine burning out on a buggy beta with 10% of the actual active playerbase.
---
The sword is poop though, higher damage range on the axe is better for Overpower.
---
The stress tests are open to anyone with a wow sub
---
That account might have enough gold on it for a years worth of tokens, get it my dude
---
Human or gnome mage? Does it truly matter?
---
Right? This beta seems waaaaaaay off regarding elite mobs in instances
---
Not only like everyone else says is iuy difficult to be in a position where you will never tank in a raid but even the DPS is hard. Warrior is consistently the most played class. You will almost always be competing for a spot more than you do for lots of other classes, including rogue.
---
As for which is harder to master, in PvE both rogue and warrior are incredibly straight forward. In PvP both rogue and warrior are difficult to play well. Rogues have more "oh shit" buttons in PvP though so if you're looking for a slightly easier time while skill still matters, rogue is the way.
---
Because we're all super special, unique youtube stars now. Didn't get the memo?
---
Wow, realized i was full-cheesing once that clip ended.
---
:(
---
you are seem knowledgeable. /s
---
I have done RFC , completed all quest from TB irg and UC without any issue
---
I'm not against using the add-ons whatsoever. I have no problem with people using them. I'm just stating why I won't be.
---
And don't worry, Blizzard will block any attempt at a group finder add-on (though they won't be able to stop Discord)
---
There was no wave yesterday and likely won't be one today either. Monday is the soonest a new wave will likely come.
---
In all Blizzard games, they typically don't do invites over the weekend, just the weekdays.
---
Additionally, the stress test is different than the closed beta. A stress test invite likely means you lose your access after the stress test if it's based like all the other games, that isnt a true closed beta invite.
---
You might very well be right. I do not know a whole lot about this kind of stuff in overall.
---
Most XP in vanilla comes from mobs. Quests give very little XP. You're just gonna end up grinding mobs because you ran out of quests.
---
I think he's referring to the fact all of the private Vanilla servers were PvP.
---
Ok, but what´s your point besides a cheap karma-grab?
---
That is really nice to hear :)
---
It gets resisted.
---
Ahh, I did wonder, but even then I'm sure there have been a few with PvE servers.
---
The run itself should be perfectly doable, but you can't get back out again so you'll need to take your gear off and suicide. That means running back in from the graveyard which isn't *that* close, and of course having to keep a bunch of extra bag space for your gear. As a hunter who already sacrifices one bag slot for a quiver, it would leave you with so little space that you'd have to go back to a merchant every five runs or something. Sounds like it just wouldn't be worth it.
---
Sylvanas was never a night elf tho?
---
Classic is superior as an MMORPG, not as an action game. It doesn't have wheels either so it's an inferior wagon.
---
You lost your argument now you grasp at straws. Nice changing goal posts, just because you try to sound smart doesn't mean you are lmao
---
If this is vanilla pre-AS-normalization I will be soooo happy.
---
Gnome is the best race for PvP and PvE mage and warlock.
---
\+5% int alone is worth more than perception and the human spirit combined. Escape artist is just icing on the cake. I might feel diff for PvP if humans had every man for himself like they do now but for classic, go gnome or go home.
---
Imagine gatekeeping a 15 year old game that people are playing for the love and fun of it. Grow up dude, no need to be so tryhard, they're just having fun. Eat a dick.
---
I can’t wait to lick those sweat tears of yours
---
Your autism is showing
---
ok brackie
---
It took me a couple of days in the beta to get it ready with the api but here it is.
---
i'm not sure how it works in WoW, but at least in OSRS there are a lot of people from countries like Venezuela where literally just grinding normal endgame content for money and selling the gold is livable wages or better (Venezuelans who can farm Vorky/Zul'rah, two slightly harder bosses, are literally making more than doctors there), and a lot of them were originally people that played the game for fun and picked it up "full time" because they figured out they can make cash off of it.
---
Basically I wonder how many people are in similar situations in WoW, and how many of them work in the idealized vision of like, 20 guys in a room on shitty PC's being forced to grind gold
---
People literally invented some pserver snobs so they can justify their anger at pserver players for some reason. It’s strange. Most of the toxic shit I’ve seen is “hah pserver tards” type of stuff or of course “stream man bad” 
---
It’s whatever tho they’ll shape up once they join our guilds / raids and see maybe playing this game over and over again for the past few years actually will help, even if we have to adjust a little bit for stuff like deep breath.
---
Can someone pls eli5 all this Omar stuff on the front page?
---
Thx in advance.
---
"Bring the player not the class" is the worst design decision they've ever made. And it's counterproductive to boot: If no classes have unique utilities, there is no reason not to bring 50 of the thing that does 0.1% more damage.
---
They can simply share access to that server they are already using for reference without battle.net launcher. Like private servers do.
---
There was no year 0. [Here is the Wikipedia entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0s) on the first decade of 1-9. And year the preceding 1 CE (or 1 AD) would be 1 BCE (or 1 BC).
---
fuck pvp, but im glad other people are enjoying it.
---
Didn't vanilla release In November 2004?
---
This is very well done, bravo.
---
(It's a joke based on her using a regular night elf model in Vanilla)
---
What makes you think that people who tune private server damage know that they're making them harder than the official game if they DON'T HAVE THE DATA FROM THE OFFICIAL GAME that they can compare their own tuning to? Not even blizzard has it, if they had, there would be no problems now. It's entirely possible that even those private servers that claim to be overtuned are still in fact undertuned. 
---
And by the way, mobs in Strat doing 250-300 damage per hit seems very low.  That would mean a mediocre gear warrior at lvl55-60 with lets say 2500-3000hp would be able to take 10 or more hits from a mob there without dying. I ask you then, why did we all wipe so many times in Strat whenever we wouldn't use CCperfectly  and whenever the healers would stop doing their job just for a couple of seconds? Yes players weren't as good back then, but we weren't complete idiots either, I don't buy that argument at all because I know very well how I played back then.  We're talking about tanks being able to handle 4-5 elite mobs of their level hitting them on classic beta, while NOT WEARING SHIELDS at all, and still they barely need healing.  One heal per pull + hot. That's not realistic.  Healers would pretty much be OOM after every one or two pulls in SM, even when using CC, which the streams of classic aren't using at all.
---
Ohh yes of course! Very interesting. And also interesting that they thought it would be more cost efficient to rewrite everything to work with the new systems compared to just fire up and scale the old servers. They must anticipate a huge number of players. Otherwise why not just start the old systems and live with the sloppy maintenance and old ticket / customer support
---
Huh, you're right. I made my shaman alt shortly before TBC launched and I guess I didn't ever notice it was introduced in TBC.
---
Keep in mind we're also watching streamers and enthusiasts, not pugs.
---
Yeah, most of those are fine but these are stupid. Addons, maps, and macros were a thing in Vanilla.
---
I agree with this honestly.
---
Give Chinese their own region of servers and disallow them from playing on EU/NA/OCE servers.

Her old model was.

play whatever you want. If you're not playing proficiently by the time you hit 60 idk what to tell you.
---
Every server on retail is the same - a Normal server. PvP and PvE servers do not exist anymore. You have the option to toggle PvP (It has a different name I believe) and in contested zones you only see people with that toggle on, meaning that you can play PvP while leveling one day and then toggle it off the next day.
---
This works differently for roleplay servers.
---
Still, this post is mentioning the scarcity of PvE private realms that have been popular over the years. The newer ones have mostly been PvP.
---
And there’s probably people who loved WoD. Does that mean they should make a WoD server? Fuck no.
---
Ye
---
Good job porting this. But I doubt it will be useful since the vast majority of us play classic to ESCAPE from brainless pugging and LFG.
---
People downtoked you when you just taught me something. Thanks my dude.
---
This happened with kelthuzad a lot lol. He spams aoe deathcoils at everyone nearby so other guilds would suicide to heal him

Haha, that’s why I included my last reply that I did not want to go forward with the retrieval.

true, shiet my bad.

I actually really love Sunken Temple, I love the aesthetics and how big it of a dungeon it was, I'm actually looking forward to running it again.

Cool cool. Kinda funny were sitting here like detectives digging up 10 year old shitty footage on youtube while the pristine version is hidden away at blizzard
---
Sorry I  found them browing through wikis and old blogs/forums, they are very hard to source.
---
i mean if you go on twitch the top 50 wow streamers are american or european so no it’s not s racial thing
---
I noticed the same thing in Dun Morogh. The trolls aggro range was very small.
---
The problem with changes though is where we draw the line. Make it harder som people say, more mailboxes some people say and more and more changes occur and we have an entirely different game on our hands.
---
I watched streamers for like 16 hours yesterday, and I never watched them before the beta dropped.
---
This game is already ruining my life and I havent even played it yet.
---
&gt;Every server on retail is the same - a Normal server. PvP and PvE servers do not exist anymore. You have the option to toggle PvP (It has a different name I believe) and in contested zones you only see people with that toggle on, meaning that you can play PvP while leveling one day and then toggle it off the next day.
---
Jesus, I knew a lot of bad things about retail, but I didn't know this. That's abominable to *force* players not to be able to roll on auto-flagged servers. I still remember trying to PvP on a PvE server long ago (friends wanted me to make a character on said PvE server), and it was terrible. To know that that's the only option now is just unnerving.
---
Every class has a learning curve for PvP. Which is because you are playing against other humans. PvE is all scripted. Once you learn that formula it’s easy mode.
---
Same for me. Been playing beta every day. I can tell Im not gonna play anything else until launch.
---
Wasn't the beta released in america only as a stress test or something for now?
---
they have a lot of buttons, and are a little harder to play in pvp than hunters. In terms of ability to solo things I'd vote hunter
---
I had them, didnt use them for about 9 years and tossed them somewhere goodwill maybe lol. I did the big regret when they announced classic.
---
Is there a list of potential quality of life improvements to Classic currently? Stuff that has no impact on gameplay like a larger trade skill window or being able to loot one mob for all loot dropped in the area (which I guess is debatable).
---
My thoughts are we want vanilla WoW, not vanilla WoW changed to fit your needs as a PvE player.
---
"Private servers did it". They also didn't give a shit about security. 
---
If you don't know anything about Modern Net Sec then you wouldn't understand why they wouldn't do it.
---
No the damage is wrong, it shouldn’t be dealing at least 60% crushing blows but this isn’t happening and the dudes are actually damaging the mob which is wrong because they should miss 90%+ of the time.
---
18
---
I dont think I've seen EU guys streaming beta tbh. Not sure tho
---
Literally my week described. Rip
---
hunter is much harder than warlock
---
The point is that guy is the most followed hunter player.... a hunter who doesnt even send the pet is the most followed, its fortnite all over again
---
I ain't gona lose sleep for taking an account back from a Chinese gold farmer who is no longer in business that was never sold on and had been sitting suspended for the past 12 years.

Acording to the amount of shit I got yesterday I should kill myself for how immoral I was.
---
People need to chill.
---
Do they send you an email if they give you a beta?
---
There's loads of them.
---
Calm down bot.
---
MrGM is EU.
---
Gnome def better but if you want to play a human play a human. Difference isnt big enough that its going to deny you spots in raids
---
If I could downvote you more than once I would.
---
Stealing aggro from range also required you to pass 130% of the threat of a melee. Stealing aggro from melee required only 110%.
---
As a rogue that wants to level with mining and engineering, how much will I be spending, on average, for swifthistle to make tea?

Bunch of different content creators have gone over them in their beta videos. Idk if theres a comprehensive list that anyone has made yet though
---
It's funny?

delete this.

Good at being pathetic? Finally we agree on something. Lol
---
Having played both to 70 in tbc I can say this; warlock is harder on a entry level.
---
Hunter has a higher skillcieling.
---
Did everyone here forget that when you subscribe, you actually get to play retail?  Where do you think all these "recovered my old account, look at my main from vanilla" posts are coming from?

You're kidding yourself if you think $10 to $15 a month is a lot of money to everyone.  If you get more than a few hours of enjoyment out of it, it *is* a good deal.
---
Is that Joe?
---
Deviate Delights have been known to fix problems for Tauren tanks, Gnome tanks, and Boomkins. But they're sometimes seen as a "hardcore" thing to do, because the low-effort method is always going to avoid them.
---
They prefer pvp/competitive games. Video games are like a sport in Korea when it comes to past times. WoW hasnt had that scene since wotlk and wont because it js too many of a grind to get to the point to even do that stuff in the game itself.
---
i would suggest we mass report this project
---
The salt from people not in the beta is pretty fucking big (I'm not either)
---
I think the problem with the old client is that it is hopelessly outdated in terms of bnet integration, support functions, server scaling (layering) and probably alot of other things. 
---
For blizz it's super important that things go smoothly. Any hiccups and they loose lots of cred and money. So the only way for classic to be made was if they found a way to recreate it in a modern client. Thankfully our lord and saviour Omar had a divine revelation one day and figured out how to do it.
---
This is the highest effort troll I have ever seen in my entire life.  Well played OP.
---
Reasoning for what? I don't wanna watch these normies who are just jumping on the next popular thing, and have low knowledge of the game. Image Fortnite streamers
---
Great work, lets hope this takes off.
---
Here's the thing about Druid. If all you care about is Kitty form, you should just roll Rogue as they're better kittys.
---
You have to care about everything a Druid can do, versatility is their power, especially in PvP.
---
Dr. Pepper zero is real good, very small difference from the original.
---
SL Warlock for group PvP?
---
&gt; instant pot
---
Had to look up what that was. Turns out its a pressure cooker. Well shit then, I don't have one of those. I guess I'll just roll paladin and use my slowcooker... :D
---
If you find bfa funny, mmkay :) knock yourself out. Just sounds like a lot of people are throwing their money at the chance of a beta when they can play the complete game on one of the pservers running right now.
---
I'm just glad they have it because getting it "right" would be a nightmare otherwise.
---
omg holy shit I'm dying how did I miss this meme, please is there any more?
---
The Tauren's increased melee range (as I said in the OP) doesn't have a massive impact on PvP because enemies can use targeted abilities against you at increased ranges as well. In PvP, it's mostly the "closeness" factor as well as the AoE that really changes between races.
---
Nah same here. I wanna read those quest texts thoroughly this time. I have time. No rush.
---
I'm interested in developing addons for Classic once it releases. Where do you get access to the API?
---
Delete this

Unfortunately everyone watches a 10 minute montage, and rolls enhancement thinking they can be Unbreakable. Not realizing how awful enhancement actually is.

PSA: If you want to help horde win PvP, spec elemental instead.

You know some people enjoy this
---
Ah, I look like a boomer I guess, but my tastes aren’t boomerish, yet...
---
Downvoted :\]
---
NDA? dud, the game is like 15 years old lul
---
Yes, but it can be delayed by 24 hours. The best way to check is refreshing your launcher and looking for the dropdown.
---
yeah the damage per hit is correct i don't see any crushing blows however and pretty much everything should be a crushing blow due to the level diffrance.
---
Shamans and warriors would like you have a word with you.
---
Depends on the starting zone. The Undead starting zone Tirisfal Glades has tons of humanoids that have linen. Other starter zones might have to mix in leather working in place of tailoring to produce the greens needed.
---
You will have beta for a full day before getting an email. At least that was my experience.
---
What's funny is they had a similar concept in WOTLK with the nerubian underworld, and it ended being scraped too.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teSSu9aHSXc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teSSu9aHSXc) 
---
I guess underworlds are just too much work
---
Best in Slut
---
We must be about the same age except I was playing on dial up..
---
Counter-bait or not getting the meme?
---
tbc !== vanilla
---
There are countless reports that the email comes roughly 6 hours after your bnet client gets access to beta. So logically refreshing the client is the way find out if you got in quickest.
---
Healthiest? No, but that hasn’t stopped me from opening and closing it a hundred times...
---
It's not just that, I've noticed it for a while now. People don't realize this, but a big reason why this sub is mostly memes is because discussion threads are shut down 90% of the time. I had a thread about xrealm bgs. All I wanted was to start a conversation about it. Instead I literally got people telling me to not even discuss it because Blizzard will just decide so there's no point.
---
What class would Midnight Haze go to? Seems to me like the stats are a little broad. Doesn't appear to be a clear choice for Priest, a clear choice for Rogue, etc.
---
But I'm a noob so I've got to ask
---
Sometimes it's about the journey, not there destination.
---
I have yet to see anyone from EU get invited that is not on a F&amp;F list or content creator. 99.9% of people who claimed they've gotten invited on this sub are people whos account were created in 2004 which means they're from NA.
---
you are laughing at your own jokes?
---
with how well the things like classic nes snes etc have been doing sales wise I don't get why people think older/classic/retro games wont do well. I don't imagine or claim to have numbers but I would be willing to bet some people are coming back just hoping to get into the beta test. Paying for time which they weren't just for that hope.
---
China has definetly evolved, but some of it still hasn't. My uncle did a trip around China 6 years ago and he as some photos of kids coming back from factory work around age 8-12. Child/"slave" labour is still definitly a thing in china unfortunatly. But if china won't gold farm it won't be EEU, it would definitly be in africa. Even the chinese have gotten too expensive for themselves, we use china for cheap labour and china uses africa for cheap labour now.
---
1. Swiftthistle was about 8-10g/stack on Nostalrius, but I've seen it as low as 5-6g/stack on other servers. I forget how expensive it was in vanilla. I can count on one hand the amount of times I used thistle tea while leveling though.
---
2. 5-6 days /played is incredibly efficient. If you are not rushing, and you haven't leveled a rogue in classic before, I'd expect to be closer to 8-10 days played. Especially if you are leveling mining and engineering.
---
There are PvE servers but they’re always way less popular than pvp. I’m guessing it’ll be the same on retail.
---
I stand corrected. But the server is located in NA right?
---
No doubt.
---
Yes. As the beta servers always are.
---
what does it mean though
---
I know, my point there was that using shields early on is only like...+10-12% damage reduction, IIRC the armor boost from the one in cath is ~15% and is one of the first shields thats game changing for DR as a warrior tank. 
---
10-12% damage reduction isn’t as valuable in the early game, so it makes sense that he’s doing just fine tanking in defensive stance with a 2h
---
Can we say for certain that to even be picked for Classic Beta you need to have an active subscription? I know it's needed to play...
---
They obviously have some metric to go off of, they're not completely flyballing it. Every new server keeps making it harder, but I'm supposed to go off of the assumption that after all these years they've STILL not surpassed Blizzard vanilla numbers? Nah. And wtf is this claim that Blizzard does not have the numbers? You don't know if there are "problems". If you're referring to the Durotar tiger scenario, Joana was being hit correctly at one point and incorrectly at another, which suggests it's not the damage tables that are the issue, but something else, like for example someone suggested Joana might have been affected by Stoneclaw totem even though it was no longer there. But everyone is remembering different numbers and difficulty level, which is interesting since we all played the same game. So who's delusional and who isn't?
---
It absolutely does not seem very low. If you're in prot gear and defensive stance you're not supposed to be 3 shot by an elite mob outside of a raid, that is not how vanilla worked AT ALL. I don't remember wiping as much as you seem to be suggesting people did. Some dungeons were harder than others but it certainly wasn't so hard that a tank couldn't take more than 1 mob at a time without the healer literally spam healing.
---
Please do link where someone is tanking 4-5 elite mobs with practically no heals. I watched almost all of the Soda SM GY runs and he was healing a lot. I do not remember at all that a healer would be oom after a pull even with CC. If that is the case then the healer was really fucking bad at controlling his mana. Classic was never that hard and never will be.
---
Lol...
---
Yeah for sure, I completely agree! Planning on rolling mage myself actually so I’m sure I’ll meet plenty of people the same way 😂 cheers
---
Always thought this was a private server bug. Can people in beta please report this?
---
Sounds to me like Doomguard is super helpful on reducing a boss' damage to tanks.
---
Well, hang me or throw me to the wolves or burn me at the stakes. At least I didn't give you a pserver example. But hey, here's a vanilla example: having played a warlock to 47 and a hunter to 16 I can say this; warlocks are harder on a entry level. Hunters have a higher skillcieling.
---
Es geht ums Prinzip!

hes gonna play on a pve server guys ahahahahahaha

I'll add this to my to-do list. Might be a couple weeks but I will put a bit post here with as much info as I can gather.
---
Your request is small enough I might get it done sooner. I'll message you with the next post I make whenever I get the data.
---
Probably the best spec for a fresh 60, if it's not the best, it's absolutely viable.

My first character in vanilla was a lock. I asked my friend what the least played class was and picked what i was told it was because i wanted to be useful.
---
It was my first mmo and I managed. The pets help a lot though even if the soul shards are annoying.
---
I dont need it, i dont need it, idontneedittt....

I hope you are not this anti-social irl.

If you’re looking to heal in raids as a druid, how fucked are you?
---
Hes also a wow pro and knows what hes doing lol
---
I mean I am agreeing with you.
---
I could be wrong but wouldn't it go to your email to let you know you got it?
---
Are there any NA vendors that have CE available and not price gouged?
---
&gt;TBC
---
Yeah, as I typed 5-6 I realized it was a pretty lofty goal. Guess I'll see how I feel about leveling engineering once the grind starts. Thanks for the input!
---
Thanks, any screenshots of how it looks the game, I went through the files quickly but I did not quite saw how the interface might look like.
---
Priests go tailoring for Truefaith Vestments, but those are Priest only, so there's not a lot of benefit to Paladins. Many Priests will drop tailoring after crafting TV, as well.
---
Thank you my friend! I knew the stress tests, you did say waves daily, and thanks for reminding me about mmochampion
---
A sub will sork for both versions so you can try both.
---
The good old time when the Alliance was actually an alliance.
---
It is known.
---
From what I've been seeing it's just been showing up on launchers, then they get the e-mail way later.
---
This has not to do with jumping but with how movement works. The way described is wrong. Basically if you don't change directions or movement keys, the client only sends movement packets every 0.5, so in this clip the server still thought the guy was out-of-range.  
---
You should add these:  
---
\- Pets summoned start with full health, they should start with low health first then after a bit adjust to their owner stats then heal back up.  
---
\- Pets in PvP combat should not give their owner combat when they're attacking / being attacked.   
---
\- Blink mechanics are not vanilla-like, on vanilla you could jump off a platform and blink back even if you had no path, on beta you can't
---
Which will finance hus Epic Mount :)
---
Immersion. Fun. Whys there got to be a why anyway
---
Thank you for the positive post about the Beta. I’m in as well and having an absolute blast. I feel as though this subreddit is nitpicking Vanilla and judging it for what it was never meant to be.
---
If you like live more, then play live :) That’s my only response to the Beta haters.
---
thats quest item hes picking up, i doubt none of the races have animation for that
---
Any streamer/youtuber playing Priest in the beta?
---
I do remember in vanilla i was let in places just because i was a warlock. I also would volunteer to do curse of elements or shadows instead of being assigned to it. That said I also during trash instead of fighting would be making and handing out health stones and only using life drain on the trash as they came close to death.
---
I did notice the higher level I got the fewer warlocks I noticed around my areas/level/etc but thats just from me. I think my guild had 3 warlocks we raided with and the other two hated having do to a damage increasing curse.
---
Glad to know others are in the same boat lmao

To be honest, it’s a bit shitty of you to try to take back an account you SOLD back in 2005 that’s currently active by another player. Regardless of the beta access or not.

Wasn’t talking about the expansion release more so the next level cap increase
---
In all seriousness, I wouldn't mind if Anduin and Sylvanas get visual upgrades. Sylvanas being a Night Elf was hella awkward and Anduin being in peasant clothes was also weird. They could have at least given him something to differentiate from the kids skipping around Stormwind.
---
Crushes do 150% dmg, physical crits from mobs should be 200% (magic is 150%).  That 55 mob is doing 134 dmg crits.  Half that is 67 dmg on a regular hit.  Against a guy who has maybe 2k armor at that level.  Seems pretty low.
---
Was she high elf or what? I mean in wc3, don't remember exactly.

Its pretty funny.

The free-karma-train has already left dude with these pics
---
Indeed, and I don't know why. Instead of bitching they should do their absolute best to communicate what they feel is a bug instead of acting like 5 year olds that didn't get what they wanted at the toy store. I don't understand how people can go so unbelievably insane over minute issues like these. A beta is there to test and fix potential issues, but I knew this would happen, people consider betas finished games nowadays and completely forget what they're actually there for.
---
I choose to trust Ion and Omar when they say things are going to be a certain way. I'm at a loss how anyone can work off of the assumption that they're just lying. If things do not turn out as the developers are saying they should absolutely be held accountable, but until then we need to take them at their word.
---
Public betas havent been used for proper bug testing in a long time. Theyre just promotion tools today.

Welfare really came mainstream during IOQ tho. Literally only H MGT  was needed to shit on 90% of the game.

To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.

Congrats :) though I do hate all these posts, because it gives me hope as well xD the only beta I’ve ever been a part of was for MoP, and I literally paid to get in. Plus I got into a later wave anyway iirc.

but can’t tell who got it.

I think a person named Roguée just posted the other day about logging into his 60 rogue recently. Is that the same one?

Weren't the rare mobs in vanilla kind of lame as far as loot goes?  I only remember getting greens from them - or were some of them more worthwhile?

Tank for sure.

[Are we going to have features like walljumping and exploring out of bounds in Classic?  BB: Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure we're not gonna have walljumping, and the reason for that is because we have some modern movement enforcement and exploit detection code that prevents things like walljumping.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=288412/blizzcon-2018-wow-classic-interview-with-brian-birmingham-and-john-hight)
---
I've never played seriously on a PvE server, but after some consideration, I fully intended on playing on one in Classic, but my group of friends all want to play on a PvP server. So I guess I'm gonna have to slum it with them and slog through STV... again.
---
Definitely a caster class; the one handed weapons with spell damage on it have their DPS capped at around 41,5 DPS. Just look up a different dagger from that range (Kingsfall for example), you'll notice the difference!
---
yeah. thats me. posted about 10 pics today. all classic related. had some time to look into my screenshots from 2005/2006

I'm 21. My earliest experience with MMOs was really old RPGs like diablo and diablo 2 and old MMOs like Everquest and Everquest 2. I didn't get into wow until cata and once nostalrius launched I played that to see how it compared to the other old MMOs I'd played. 
---
I've always had a preference for old school MMOs over modern ones.
---
This is more something you would do on Kazzak
---
Did my dad ever get those smokes in 1998?
---
Exact same thing happened to my guild. I know people like TBC,  but it destroyed my server’s community. Makes me sad.

Turalyon isn’t immortal, is he? He’s super old from light magic or something but he can still be killed.

(Played Legion but my memory could be spotty)
---
Go mage it’s brain dead raiding. Hunters have harder rotation
---
oh god are you stupid
---
Yup, having a warlock alt on the spot was a thing :)
---
I think knowledge and gear are the biggest factors. The last time I leveled up in vanilla, there was 4 of us (shaman tank, druid healer, warrior and warlock dps). We exclusively grinded dungeons on our way up, and had BiS for every level through the dungeon drops and crafting with the occasional AH purchase (our druid was loaded because he cornered the frost oil market and got us all mounts etc). we literally cleared all dungeons way under the appropriate level without any issues what so ever. We took princess 10 levels below her level (she is much higher than the lowest wing in maraudon). yes, we couldn't actually see her level, she she was too high, most of our hits glanced, and our druid ran around crafting healing pots because he was out of mana, but still. it was perfectly doable without any wipes.
---
Care to elaborate? :)
---
22 here. My WoW account was created in the latter end of 2006, so while there is an element of nostalgia for me (and I don't think nostalgia's a bad thing), I barely played any of the game, probably getting to only around level 18. Just like you it wasn't until I tried Nostalrius out of curiosity's sake that I fell in love with vanilla.
---
I have some regrets that I was too young to enjoy vanilla fully when it was out, and the memories people share here of raids and world pvp. But I'm so glad I'm getting the opportunity to play vanilla as an adult.
---
no steamers on me server plz
---
they will change the classic felt and make me wonder if there are a crowd of people who are about to report me for playing the game in a way they don’t like
---
I didn't enjoy it much the first time, but I want to play it because it comes from an era where MMOs were a lot better. The main things I hated about classic WoW (loot train, amusement park style gameplay, not being able to choose your skills as you level) are precisely the things that blizz laser focused on and amplified to make the shitty game we have today. 
---
Blizz also managed to effectively removed the things I enjoyed in classic WoW. World PvP, tough leveling experiences, talent trees, and classes being unique and useful. I loved being a mage in classic WoW because I always was THE guy people went to for portals, food, and CC in dungeons. In bfa the mage is just like any other ranged class, its fucking pointless. It is like they took all of the RP out of the game.
---
It wont be pre-AS normalization because its based on 1.12. Normalization was done in 1.8
---
Worth some experiments I always felt. IIRC cripple was a 45% attack speed slow which is a ton.
---
Admittedly the _uptime_ of cripple isn't great. Off memory it's cooldown was longer then duration. That's also not counting enslave breaks and losing Doomguard entirely toward the end of the fight.
---
Still, Classic WoW really taxed healer mana supplies. I recall fights being lost because of all healers being OOM. Lowering incoming early in a pure tank/healer gear check boss fight may allow squeeking through.
---
Or maybe Blizzard's accidentally changing it because very few people knew anything about it in the first place? I'm encouraging a "try for fun" approach for good reasons.
---
Yes you need one to be even considered. A CM confirmed it yesterday.
---
Fairly sure he's only doing that to test out actually getting hit to check damage numbers and stuff.
---
or or, maybe he ran out of arrows so had to melee it up - who knows??
---
So if we are friends and want to play together but are not on the same layer we can’t play in any way at all? That sucks
---
Best in Stuff.
---
Even BFA hardly uses 2 Cores.  
---
WOW perfomance is just bad on live and classic.  
---
Its just really nice that Classic is so easy on PC´s anyway
---
But... do you really want to be in a raid with 10 Warriors?
---
Definitely not a mistake, it generates hella hype.
---
Leme put it this way: the reason I play Hearthstone is because of nostalgia for vanilla WoW lol. And why do I have nostalgia? Because it was good.
---
They seem to come out between 6pm and 8pm EDT on weekdays
---
That lv 40 wolf helm for druids.
---
 😂  😂  😂  😂  😂  😂  😂  😂
---
This made my day.
---
tbh it doesn't seem that farfetched to me. every hit is a crush or a crit from what I can see on the frames, and while i'm not sure how much armor he has, it being reduced by that much and then multiplied by crit/crush values, it doesn't look that off. I'll wait for someone with proper knowledge on the factors before I'll say I'm certain though.
---
How did you guys get back together? Did some of you keep contact or was there some organised get-back-together search?
---
Could also make for some great guild vs guild wars
---
Okay, enjoy your 0 chance getting the item. Same thing will go down everywhere but with a fair chance.
---
Natural alignment crystal and Zandalari hero charm. Then GG  Chain lighting and frostshock!
---
Hearing the music on those beta streams again convinced me. This is what I want. Any other game I have right now pales.
---
if we are lucky when they send out a bunch of invites for stress test they will open it up a lot more 
---
it appears the stress test will be invite only not 100% open so they sort of have to send out a bunch of invites this week
---
No it's all 1.12
---
Even on private servers they didn't do that, what would be the point?
---
Autistic prat.
---
As a Rogue main in Vanilla, and a Warrior Pserver player, I'd say its the opposite.
---
&gt; and the game run alot beter
---
First comment I've read about this and it makes me excited. The original Vanilla (and especially TBC) clients are optimized so badly for todays hardware. You could run TBC on a 9900k with a 2080 TI and you're still getting 50 FPS in Netherstorm.
---
I played alliance first, rolled horde on k3 all the way to 60. While it was cool to experience the horde side and their arguably better questing logic zone to zone...I missed IF and SW so much. Especially IF. Just an awesome city. 
---
Also, now that you’ve leveled a paladin, you’ll get to see why other classes are so much better at leveling ;) warrior is my favorite class, and they can be a real grind at Fresh, but the payoff is huge esp. if they are your first character and you’re a desperately needed tank for level 60 5-mans.
---
that’s actually a big thing to point out. exactly what you said. 
---
our guild also survived, thanks to a merge. but our servers community completely died thanks to the announcement. several guilds disappeared. 
---
our server literally went from a viral server, to one of those destination servers overpopulated ones can transfer to for free. 
---
the timing of this announcement was something very crucial. 
---
imho: they simply should have announced it as late as possible. like 1 week before would have been ok. everything more then that already had people thinking and acting differently.
---
It's fun, and a decent way to decide what class I want to main on release. The fact that it stops at 30 also helps (unless they up the cap), since most of the game will still be fresh when release hits.
---
anthema?

He was playing Shaman last time I checked, but I'll try again.
---
TY I will look for him.
---
I mean it goes even further than that.  There are some lower level Dungeon items that not only trump lvl 60 Dungeon items but there are some items that you can't even replace in the first two raids, and then there is the Hand of Justice from BRD that people still used even during Vanilla Naxx for how overpowered the level 56 Trinket was.

This sounds amazing man, super jealous tho😁.  Enjoy the rest of your weekend🤙.

Well rip beta then. Good to know at least will save me from checking.
---
I haven't played since Legion but apparently he's been lightforged but  some naruu like Xera died so maybe he's not anymore.
---
I'm 19 and my first experience was playing early wotlk on my dad's pc. I had grown up loving to draw mythical creatures and playing with Lego so my mind was blown when I could run across an entire world filled with stuff I had only imagined.
---
Being able to go back to classic without any private server nonsense makes me pretty delighted, and actually being able to properly play the game without getting stuck in the middle of deeprun tram because I was pretty clueless at a young age lol.
---
We have websites such as [stormwind.org](https://stormwind.org) where people could talk about realm business, pvp and bragging rights. If you played at a high level a lot of people from both faction knew who you were and each time you logged in you'd have people messaging you for advice and such.
---
I think you are misunderstanding how the system works.
---
It's basically like each server is two servers (a pvp server and a pve server) combined. And when you are in Stormwind as an alliance player or in Orgrimmar as a horde player, you can switch between PvE and PvP.
---
So in your example, your friends and you could have played together in the PvE mode (with Warmode disabled) and when ever you were doing stuff on your own you could have switched to the PvP mode (with Warmode enabled) and it would have been as if you were on a PvP realm.
---
Ok? Why is that?
---
I started playing WoW at the end of TBC. I played on Skywall. Kara was the big raid at the time if I recall correctly. Dabbled in Anvilmar with my Dad for some time and played on Baelgun when Cata released (new server, new Azeroth hype).
---
Got two kids now. My oldest daughter will be 4 come release and my youngest daughter will be 1 and a half. Oldest one might enjoy watching Daddy play. Younger one enjoys climbing the stairs too much...
---
Every new zone is populated. Group up and do the stuff together.
---
Read the other comments Mr. Moral Police. I was not planning to take it from an active player. I was hoping that the characters he bought were transferred to his own account.
---
IIRC scorpid sting is pretty bad, if thats what you mean by SS.  
---
Good hunters in groups are very welcome.  Their CC is harder to use then a mage but can be just as good if you are expert at trapping.  Also their CC works on everything in the game.  DM West pylons for example are some of the hardest pulls in any dungeon.  The mobs need to be CCd or you will be overwhelmed with average gear.  Only warlocks and hunters can CC those pulls.  
---
Also the meme is that hunters roll on every weapon, but one thing going for hunter is there is very little mail competition.  People often form groups to avoid gear overlap.  If I am a priest starting a dungeon and there is some spell power gear I really want, I will invite a hunter over a mage just so I get that cloth drop.
---
you can watch the recorded videos he started with priest but haven’t followed afterward
---
hanzo swords. they were all geared full BoE ^^
---
I honestly thought people would get the joke @\_@ it wasnt all that high effort tho :P
---
pretty sure it worked like that well into WotLK, you don't have to be a vanilla veteran to know the mechanic.
---
The one you could get from the emerald dragon. With the ananas on the top. Kept it until TBC
---
US beta in vanilla. Had full tier 2 armor from bwl and mc. Rerolled eu when it launched.
---
My nephews 16 &amp; 18 yrs old are playing vanilla on pservers and can't wait for classic, they love it.
---
&gt; Actually selecting priests based on race for instance, jesus christ how utterly lame.
---
this was actually extremely common even in casual guilds. 2 equally skilled and geared priests but one has fear ward? taking fear ward 100% of the time
---
Both are the two easiest classes to level, so it's kinda unnecessary to compare them leveling-wise. At 60 it's a different story, Hunter is more difficult and warlocks are taken more often in later raids.
---
ah yeah. the taxi drivers.
---
I'd send it in to interrupt with Charge and pull it back, see if I can fish some frost novas or pull someone in when he runs back.  Not sure if dude missed an opportunity to squash a heal.  But keeping it back is a good move, nice to see he has it on passive mode as well.
---
&gt; Does Classic need a different client to be played?
---
Yes. The world, abilities and dungeons have long been changed. 
---
&gt;Which graphical aspect is definitely better?
---
I'm not sure what you mean. The graphics are going to be the same as in the 2004 release. People argue that the older graphics had more charm to them. You can swap models but that is modifying game files and is a bannable offense.
---
I dont know what that means...
---
There will be addons that emulate it, so let's hope Blizzard can easily remove their functionality from the API.
---
yes and yes
---
The two worst points of LFG are:
---
1. Instant teleportation to the dungeon.
---
2. You group up with people from other servers.
---
Addons can't replicate that.
---
Didnt you read the description ? i solved that problem.
---
that sounds like an amazing experience. losing those screenshots/videos must really hurt.
---
You're basing it off tbc, level 47, and a level 16. I think that's self explanatory...
---
I’m not being moral police, I just read the stuff your main post had, which made it sound like you were going to take back something that you sold. Also, since when does stating that something is shitty make someone “LOL MORAL POLICE?” You sold the product, it’s someone else’s now. If you need to reason out how it’s okay because of whatever reason, that’s on you. Doesn’t make it not shitty tho.
---
I'd rather see Bolvar tbh...
---
have fun leveling your paladin mate
---
That's my plan. As far as I can tell you'll be able to make up to 3 characters (or somehow reserve the names without actually designing your toons?) starting Aug 13 if you have an active sub.
---
I'll be reactivating my sub that week and establishing names I'd like on every realm, and spending the next couple weeks on the beach. When I get back on the 23rd I expect my friends will either know where they're playing or be undecided still and I'll be the leader of the herd.
---
It can be done still. IIRC one of the GoT subs got the showrunners to appear under "bad writers" a few weeks ago. I think you just need a really specific/obscure tag for it.
---
Which Omar Gonzalez would be lol
---
Or asking the mages for water or food lol
---
hmm okay
---
You fuck at sunny?
---
Except it's not Vanilla, it's 8.x.x. WoW. There's been numerous changes to engine and how the game works over the years. Performance is not tied to the texture resolution which is basically the only thing that's from 2004.
---
I mean I still wanna play it but I don't think I'd grind the class I'm gunna play in classic, would make it a bit stale but what do I know
---
They should not, I believe.
---
I remember that. And I don't know how I should feel about it, given I never played on that server
---
i think the thing current WoW has lost is that WoW should be the server V the world. it breeds friendship with people since you are all in the same boat to beat the game. this is also what everquest and FF11 did back in the day.
---
it is partly why FF14 is considered the better current mmo today since while it dose have LFR and LFG stuff world content is still locked to the server you see the same people in the plaza playing music and talking etc. and it dose infact have harder world content and it makes world quest/rift etc. a logical gather and grouping point so you might find sombody to befriend.
---
current WoW has non of that it was all sacked for the person that can only play at most an hour a day. sometimes bad game design gives you good results. just like how blizzard hates the badge system of TBC and WotLK it was a bad system that got good results.
---
Do server firsts get recorded somewhere? I see people mention these things all the time, including first to 60. If it’s not recorded, can’t it just be made up or story be twisted over time?
---
I remember being that shaman.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCEEEEE
---
Comparing both forums, excluding any streamers/influencers etc
---
I see. Well, to my (apparent) limited knowledge, there is so much more that you can do with the hunter kit at 60, but hunters also have less to keep in mind at earlier levels. This is the best reasoning I can give. Have fun ripping me to shreds and have a great day :)
---

Asmon a pussy
---
Perfect, also good point on gear overlap too. I love the class fantasy of both hunter and pally and am leaning forward hunter as I already did pally previously
---
its possible they open up this or some of the stress tests to the general public (no sub) to gauge interest for server capacity 
---
but so far all we know is it will have the same requirements of the beta to get into the stress test
---
my assumption is they will just send out a few thousand invites this week before the next test 
---
though the stress test is only for a couple days so im not sure if there will be a second type of time limited beta invite or they will just open it up, its not very well worded 
---
if they do send a bunch more invites for it , that should be Monday or Tuesday because the test is Wednesday
---
I doubt there'll be much serious ganking going on - people will be concentrating on levelling more than trying to kill two people, one of which being either tricky to kill (&lt;40) or a nightmare to kill (40+).
---
Nope. To our knowledge, there won't be any balance changes.
---
That's awesome. I'm sure that was a great feeling
---
No harm in at least forcing blizz to recheck all the numbers though right.
---
ah that one. 
---
yeah it’s amazing. i can still name swords and shit, because those were the relevant items for my class. 
---
staffs pretty much don’t exist in my head. besides anthema, benediction, staff of dominance, atiesh. i think thats about it. 
---
swords daggers i could name like maybe 15-20-30?
---
I made a level 24 troll rogue before deleting him and making an undead rogue lol
---
im still playing the same warlock from vanilla and pally from TBC.
---
Loads of testing, answering almost every question. One can almost play the game through him. He's great!
---
Your aunt is probably a manipulative thot, lol
---
Don't let all the harsh comments get to you. Anyhow, if you don't want to play the role that tier sets put you in, feel free to make your own "set". Iirc tier sets aren't always BiS.
---
That's... like, slightly better? And it would only shard you with other flagged people, I guess?
---
Still stupid that you can choose to simply ignore combat whenever it's convenient for you. But World PvP has been dead for so long in retail that I guess it's a moot point shoving another nail in its coffin.
---
True, very true. The more i think about it the more painful it gets. Perhaps the old code is written for old server hardware, hard to get / impossible. The client might become obsolete with new operative systems etc. Hiring different customer staff to support retail / classic and teaching different tools... Glad its finally all coming together nicely :)
---
Thanks, missed that interview! I was day dreaming about my vanilla times and suddenly thought about it.
---
I never have and never will. I remember how frustrating those "turn right at this one boulder in the barrens" quests could be, but half the adventure was the trouble you'd get into looking for the right place. If I really get lost I'll ask for help or look it up the way I did it in the old days.
---
i played vanilla when i was 15. looking forward to a chance at it now that i'm not terrible, which didn't happen until midway thru bc.
---
There are no tailoring patterns that are "good" for holy paladin.  
---
At level cap, you will want to target gear with +healing on it.  In tailoring there is practically none, outside of truefaith which as others have said is locked to priest.  
---
You can still go tailoring.  You can make some money selling shirts, mooncloth timer, bags, and if you pair with enchanting there are certain recipes that are cheap to craft items that can be DEd economically for mats.  
---
There are 2 good crafted items from leatherworking for paladin, and 2 good items from blacksmithing.  But all 4 of these items are boe so you don't need to craft them youself, and all 4 of them are very rare patterns, getting them can be a matter of luck or a lot of gold spent.

thousands play EQ P99, a game version that even predates the 1.12 WoW version by another 6 years. 
---
Some just don't understand that there are players who don't enjoy having three carrots thrown at them every hour and that the journey is the goal.
---
If you wan't to play druid, just do it.
---
Problem is:
---
\- gear for him -&gt; you fight with rogues over leather stuff (agility, but better than nothing), and with warriors to get decent 2h mace (strength stats);
---
\- no one believes in feral dps, even if you can stay at almost middle of raid dps;
---
\- you have to be in like top 3% of feral druids on server to be taken seriously;
---
\- PVP gear is average for him, you need high end PVE stuff;
---
Anyway I'll start again with druid main, this class never made me bored ;-) Played mostly as resto, had some funny PVP moments with all specs. For world fights even if you can't kill someone, you probably won't die either.
---
You’re both right now stfu
---
Lolol I watched this Live on sodapopins side.  That was epic
---
i guess before since we always had to kill them.
---
21. I started playing Maple Story instead because my parents giving their credit card information and paying for an online game and a subscription just wasnt going to happen lol
---
That's a nice salty rant you got there, clearly you really needed to get that out of your system. Literally zero relevance to the discussion going on here though, but I hope you at least feel better.
---
Asmongold is going PvE and I'm pretty sure Soda is going PvP.
---
i got the date if that helps.
---
Now they’re a DND party comprised of the leaders
---
Builds community having to ask for help.
---
Nothing much changed then
---
They will be staying on 1.12 for the unforeseen future.
---
The only patches I could see would be any game-breakers or exploits which were not obviously present during Vanilla.
---
5g is a hella lot of money in vanilla.
---
Come on people now, smile on your brother. Everybody get together try to love one another right now. ☮️
---
Something doesn't smell right.
---
I find it very weird that the human kingdom, ruled by a regent on behalf of a boy king. Is able to maintain itself as the leading faction in the Alliance. I always considered Magni Bronzebeard to be the de facto leader of the Alliance during the time of Bolvar Fordragon's regency. He is King of the Dwarves, and the Gnomes live in his city due to his generosity. The Night Elves have been secluded from the outside world for 10 000 years. Their primary reason for being in the Alliance is deterrence against the Horde, can't imagine they care much who leads the Dwarves, Gnomes and Humans.
---
The Horde should be much more centralized, with a much more powerful and respected leader. Thrall won the favor of the Orcish Horde, the Darkspear Trolls and the Mulgore Tauren through personal merit. The leaders of these two factions respect and honor Thrall personally. The Forsaken respect Thrall personally a bit less of course, but the Forsaken are hardly powerful enough on their own to defy the will of the other three factions supporting Thrall's rule.
---
Not everyone on the planet is american. Shocking, I know.
---
&gt;  Damn were we that bad
---
Bingo. Almost everyone was bad in vanilla, we just didn't know it.
---
Go back and watch any PvE videos from back then. "Top tier" players clicking abilities and keyboard turning, rogues on patchwerk not doing their literal 3 button rotation correctly. It's embarrassing.
---
Well, I want to take my time on leveling. I want to read all quests, I want to level my professions, I want to experience every zone, and sure I want to see all the content, and clear all the raids. Since I'll be playing something like 6-12h/day, I imagine I will ding 60 way before casuals, even "going slow" on leveling. Thats why I think I will have to be in a hardcore guild.
---
Started WOTLK when I was 12, been playing since. Looking forward to classic.
---
Hey I mean I know people don't like cata, but at least it was wod...
---
Cata had some of the best 5 man content in the history of wow if nothing else.
---
People will just need to adjust, and by level 60 they will have.
---
*rude*
---
Tipsout? Never heard of her
---
Thanks a lot for this very detailed Insight!

What are the meme specs to avoid?
---
What are the god specs everyone wants?

You mean Bolvar
---
That AOE hammer of justic
---
Ok
---
Of course it is, its where lots of us started. And dont be nervous about not knowing everything about the game, there will be millions of other players just like you :)
---
I haven’t played WoW for a few expansions now. What is a reserved run and a sellable res run?
---
Where does it show on the launcher?
---
You are EU or NA ?
---
Dude... This!
---
Just get off the PC dude. Go for walks, bicycle, read book s (wow books for example) just do anything other than sit infront of a pc. Classic will come sooner than you know
---
Low effort salty boi
---
That's not Magni.
---
It also ruined most of the vanilla zones
---
I sold the characters. And back then the practical way of doing so was to give them your login. Since it’s been possible to transfer characters to a different account later on, I assumed that the buyer probably would have done so to make sure that he never could lose access to them. And if my old account was inactive and empty I would not feel very bad by claiming it back. 
---
This post was about information on whether or not it helps to have an old account or not, and it’s so typical that people here have to call you out for selling your account or take it back.
---
I'm F5'in this subreddit every 10 mins, and I've yet to see any downvoted discussions today. Sorting on new btw.
---
That's not including all the 'ThiS Is WhY lAyerInG = SharDiNG' That's not discussion, that's just bullshitting.
---
That said, if discussions are being downvoted it means that they aren't interesting / not relevant. I mean, there's almost 100k ppl in this sub, with 5k active at all time. If something interesting came up, it will be upvoted.
---
fuking  
---
zoomers
---
By toe to toe I mean not kiting.
---
It's been posted that Classic WoW runs better than Vanilla.
---
I don't have access but afaik There's a drop down right above the "Play" button, the same one used to swap to PTR within the launcher.
---
Should say "WoW: Classic Beta" or something? I've heard??
---
Ah, I see. I guess I misunderstood the intent then, no worries.
---
You’ll just have to buy the World of Warcraft Atlas and use the grid system to find her. AS IS TRADITION.
---
I'm hoping that the success of Classic will convince people to check out other classic styled MMOs being developed atm like Pantheon and Camelot Unchained.
---
And then I'm hoping that those games don't suck.
---
It’s true! Some fresh looking pants and  a coat even, but perhaps his parents wanted him to have a normal kid upbringing and fashion of kids his age, so he’d feel connected to his people when it was time to lead them.
---
No, the guy above you is wrong. You just get an invite from someone on a different layer.
---
Ah, you know the struggle well my brother
---
I'm not salty about anything. I'm playing beta happily. 
---
I just think it's utterly ridiculous you people don't understand that streamers aren't the only people playing the game.
---
This makes me wonder how damage numbers can possibly be wrong. The only possibility i can imagine is if BFA data &amp; numbers is the base and 1.12 is stitched on top. So if some data is missing bfa numbers is used instead. But that would be pretty stupid. Easier to detect a bug if a mob deals null/0 damage instead of bfa numbers. This can't be the case... or can it
---
That all of this gear was available for the new honor currency in the TB pre patch, you could gather the most the gear in a day. The bags are a massive give away.
---
The title Vs rep honestly more the you look the more 'off' everything seems
---
Happy cake  day!!!!
---
Yes, you only see other people who are in the same mode. I think it actually revived world PvP a little for two reasons:
---
1) There are some bonus rewards when completing world quests and bonus XP while you have warmode enabled (PvP)
---
2) It means that you mostly meet people who are actually interested in some World PvP when you have warmode enabled yourself.
---
I personally simply leave warmode enabled at all times and it just feels like I am on a regular PvP server.
---
fuck it, they've got me. spent about 3 minutes ingame before alt-f4ig the hell out of the game
---
If its anything like OSRS it will be hordes of Venezuelans
---
&gt; Funny seeing so many people know so little about this game and how threat work.
---
Uh huh.
---
&gt; All he has to do is use Battle Shout for infinite start-up threat against mobs he can't hit.
---
Not how real vanilla worked, this is a private server meme only.
---
You mean classic players would try out new " old school MMOs"? Because the genre "classic MMO" is quite outdated.
---
You’re right, I edited it. Thanks
---
When they built WoW, they were inspired by the most successful western MMORPG on the market, which was EverQuest.
---
And believe me, every single thing on your list right there that you consider bad from vanilla WoW is straight from EQ.
---
Melee skills? Exactly how it worked in EQ. Every level your cap raised by 5, and if you never used 2-handed warhammers, getting your first 2-handed warhammer at level 55 meant you now had to train in the exact method you just described, because actual edge content for you was impossible. 
---
Ammo, the same thing. You bought super cheap arrows from vendors and used expensive, crafted ones in rare situations. 
---
This is a "class trainer" teaching you spells in EQ
---
https://wiki.project1999.com/Krako_Stonesplitter
---
You didn't mention lock picking, but EQ had the same thing. You found a door in a newbie dungeon, and you picked that a thousand times until your lock picking skill was maxed again.
---
I'm pretty sure in the months and years after WoW was released, the developers looked at all these things once more and said to themselves "Why did we copy this again? This is no good" and replaced/removed the mechanics.
---
Unironically Subtlety. I did Combat swords on vanilla a million years ago and it was effective but pretty boring. I want to creep around and do thief shit instead of being a halfassed fury warrior in leather. Waiting to see how the macro situation shakes out but I'm confident a simple weapon swap macro would let me use the entire toolkit fluidly.
---
Not sure what pserver you've previously played on, but how would you compare the dungeon difficulty? Seems like a hot topic for many pserver players
---
SALT DETECTED
---
Do you realize if the game has bugs they'll discover them with while getting their "BiS level 30 gear"? SMH.
---
Not a thing in 1.12 real vanilla
---
Do you mean "i doubt any of the races have animation for that"?
---
I leveled a priest to 60 first, and then leveled a paladin for fun.  Since I usually built my own groups, I just didn't ever invite dps warriors because they stole my defensive plate, offensive chain from hunters, and pretty much any piece of gear they could use they claimed a need for it.    
---
Their excuse: "Sometimes I need to tank!".  My excuse: "There are like 20 mages/rogues/hunters/warlocks lfg right now that I can take instead of a dps warrior."
---
You can actually get to old outlands from deadmines of all places. I Don't recall specificlally where you need to go but iirc its at the start and involves some weird shit like a pipe or something.    Its pretty neat
---
They are right, people just think they remember the game better than they really do..
---
Lots of people will stop playing the game when they realize it isn't this utopia they remember it to be
---
They've already moved the goalpost from "no sharding" to "first few weeks" to possibly all of phase 1 which has no set upper limit. A blizzard dev even talked about it as being in "the first few **months**". 
---
People don't care because they believe what they want to believe, not the reality of it. Doesn't help that there's a ton of false info about how it'll work flying around.
---
How does the launcher icon look when you get accepted into beta? (Can someone provide a pic?)
---
Hi, /u/nvrrddt
---
That OG music gets me every time I hear it. I swear it's magic or something.
---
Income the salty retail downvotes.
---
The succubus demons in winterspring cast shadowbolt, the warlock shadowbolt debuff works on theirs as well
---
As I've said in countless threads. High view streamers aren't invited for testing bugs. They're invited to hype the game up.
---
?? They DO, very clearly
---
I've been wondering this as well, I keep checking if I've gotten in (I haven't) and while I'd love to get in, I don't mind sitting out as much as I wonder if there's even a point in checking.
---
Why does he reminds me of Richard Hammond so much?
---
Well, its mostly a thing with age anyways.
---
Just last night I played CS:GO against someone with an assassin style profile picture and  "Nightfighter" as name.
---
&gt; You have no idea if that was sarcastic or not
---
Why are you speaking for them?  The sarcasm was fucking dripping from the original comment.  Here's what you should have said:
---
&gt; I have no idea how to recognise obvious sarcasm
---
I'll elaborate for him. This subreddit is full of mouth breathing neckbeards who have no clue how to have a discussion without putting someone down. It's almost like all these people spent 90% of their day indoors with no face to face human interaction or something.
---
afaik every stress test will bring +10 increased level cap with the third stress test bringing cap to 60. i think i've read it in some official place, but dunno where exactly. if anyone could back me up on this.
---
&gt; I'm sure there's plenty of players from China who mean no harm
---
Theres legitimately millions of WoW players from China who just play normally like everyone else. Though many people from the west don't realize it China is a huge gaming hot spot.  Things have greatly changed since 2004 to now (I mean, they have a WoW theme park for crying out loud\) as well and they've seen huge economic growth. Meaning more legitimate jobs so gold farming isn't as big (as in the amount of people actually doing it) as it use to be. Now its done all by bots, not a massive army of people farming gold 24/7. They're (today's gold farmers) really no different than multiboxers, which a lot of who aren't even Chinese. 
---
TLDR: China has changed a lot since 2004

There are some that have mob exclusive blues. For example, I know vultros in West fall drops a weapon called talon of vultros which was a 2.00 speed blue dagger for like lvl 20ish BoE. There’s another blue axe I think called manslayer that’s the same deal but higher level. 
---
Also rare mobs in instances drop good loot. Briarwood reed is preraid bis off a rare in ubrs.
---
I see now that you need to be subbed to even get considered, which explains why my random checking is fruitless. But anyways is there any idea on how often people are being added? Is it often enough that its worthwhile to sub for the chance, or should I just wait for release?
---
Hi, /u/Ultima1221
---
Yeah this could be it honestly.  There seems to be a big lack of crushing blows.
---
I mean I was watching tipsout 2hand tank whole packs of level 33/34 elite mobs and he wasn't taking much damage.  In real vanilla they would be crushing him to fuck and he would be doing barely any damage back.
---
Blizzard mage is pretty easy imo
---
We are talking about day 1, which had only streamers and blizzard employees. At least read what you're replying to before jumping into the middle of a conversation, otherwise you'll end up embarrassing yourself like this.
---
Wat.
---
The only things blizz will get involved with are blatant ninja looting and scamming.
---
"give me your mats and 100g, I'll make this Hide of the Wild for you"
---
Then they just log off - GM's will probably get involved. Blatant Ninja looting as well, but if you're up front that you're reserving the bindings in MC, you'll likely be fine as long as it's announced.
---
Hahahaha
---
Well yeah many classes aren’t meant to go toe to toe even with regular mobs.
---
I didn't even read the server name, damn. Thanks for bringing that up
---
I can hear that one in my head, too. *Thanks for that......*

Look, I'm not trying to bust anyones balls or anything, this is my aunts toon that she left off into the first few quests of bc. You can buy the gear from a vendor currently in retail with honor BUT you can only buy it if you actually had the gear previously.
---
If there is anything in specific you would want me to link for proof, please let me know  :)
---
when the game is out for a while the masses will beg for some sort of changes to a class 
---
like its likely people decide something is more op than it should be 
---
i obviously dont want changes but i wold not be surprised if they bend to the demand to change a couple things
---
you can earn solid money with fishing if you have the patience to that
---
This is incorrect, your armour at level 35 might give you 40% reduction to damage from another level 35, but it descales the higher level the target damaging you is, so even less reduction than that.  Plus with this kind of level range he should be being crushed and crit all the time.
---
Truth.
---
Shield Block is used for raid bosses and you have to have the 1 pt. in Shield Specialization to get the extra block before it is worth using.
---
Demo Shout will be a far greater damage reduction, and will generate AoE threat on each use for every mob that it affects.  
---
Casting Battle Shout will generate threat on every mob who has aggro on yourself and anyone else you buff.  The more group members you buff, the more threat is applied to each mob.
---
Both cost as much Rage as Shield Block.
---
Can I ask you what you mean by more you can do with the hunter kit?
---
NA I just have eu friends. Cheers is a word I’ve inherited from them I guess lol. Wbu?
---
You just get into the habbit of restocking in the cities. Filled quiver and good to go.
---
Biggest question is if players invited to the stress test will continue to be able to play the beta thereafter
---
Being lightforged is permanent so he's still full of glow, and I'm pretty sure he can die but he won't die from old age
---
Is it not possible on this sub for people to disagree with people or correct them without being a condescending jerk?
---
I want to try that out if this disc/shadow spec doesn't work. Do you have the talent trees already made?
---
oohhhhhhh nononononono omg that's fucking awesome, I gotta show this to someone.
---
Oh man I totally forgot about trading low level greens in guild chat. I want this SO BAD
---
Lightforged doesnt make one immortal. There is a whole playable race called Lightforged draenei, they or just even holier than normal draenei/blessed by the light. Useful when fighting the burning legion for sure but not that special otherwise.
---
Wait 8.2 is coming in 3 months? /s
---
I've sent 12+ hours a day on this sub since beta released and I've never seen it. I don't believe you.
---
Theyre not going to change it.
---
Because I want every class to be used I should go play a game I don't like, makes sense
---
Every day we stray further from Uther's light
---
Seriously, if you want “balance”, there’s retail. Classic is a museum piece, if you don’t like how it is, don’t play it.
---
Why is Engineering a required profession if you want to focus on PvP? I understand it has useful craftables, I’m just looking for the specifics that I need to focus on and have/use.
---
Oh great now my pants are off for nothing now
---
I'm 23, started playing right after TBC. Never played vanilla, I'm stoked :)
---
I did
---
I wish I could play in a perpetual state of wotlk.
---
Iirc, the hunter has more cc capabilities, such as slows, different tracking spells, their pets are generally stronger then the warlocks demons, and they have access to feign death to instantly lose threat, whereas warlocks have to keep an eye on their threat and adjust their damage accordingly.
---
No and they have shared subs so people are going to dip in and out. The retail and classic version of the game are really different.
---
Ive found my tribe, and its glorious
---
We want classic 
---
We get classic
---
Classic releases in 100 days
---
Ppl already want something different than classic
---
I will be. I hardly play anymore these days, anyways. No real interest in playing bfa content, but I'll be getting back into it for classic.
---
If you were low level, you pretty much had to have a Priest in group to shackle the Lupine Horrors in order to avoid wiping.  Those two pulls with two Horrors on the staircase would wreck.
---
I played on nost and lighthope and its very similar i didnt notice much of a difference .
---
I pserver example would be more accurate than a TBC example. TBC at different talents, spells, rotations, etc. Pservers have their flaws, but the rotations, skillsets and talents of each class are the same as in Vanilla.
---
Day 1, Wednesday the 15th, was absolutely not just streamers and Blizzard employees, as evidenced by the fact that I was playing. I'm not sure how you'd even know that non-streamers weren't playing. There's no reputable source corroborating what you're saying. I was leveling up the same time that the streamers were starting. 
---
If you want to see the email from Wednesday I can show you that, or [I can show you a clip where I ran into Slootbag unbeknownst to me.](https://clips.twitch.tv/AssiduousSmallScorpionCoolCat) 
---
That's me in chat. If you'd like me to take a screenshot of character select to prove it, I can do that as well.
---
Oh trust me i know we we're bad.  Somehow still made good progress..  Thats actually my biggest worry with vanilla, we are so much better now and have so much more information i'm not sure how much fun its going to be.  I cant wait to level, but i think end game might not be nearly as satisfying.
---
Go play retail, its called classic for a reason
---
Haha!
---
Someone calculated it in another thread, the halfway point is lvl 44 and when you ding 51 you still have a third of your levelling to do (most depressing thought ever ;-).
---
The mic kills me evrytyme
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20180624103732/http://grobbuluschant.ytmnd.com/
---
it seems ytmnd shut down completely a few days ago but the internet archive people did a full snapshot last year
---
I'll believe Classic is going to last when I see lots of talk about how much people love it without referencing retail, which many of us also have enjoyed &amp; still enjoy. 
---
Around mid-Wrath or so, the game made it possible to play in many ways. In-game storytelling was greatly expanded. The experience of scrabbling for any little quality of life improvement and trying to get around, hallmark experiences in Classic &amp; TBC, became less of a focus as long-time accounts accrued wealth &amp; comforts. 
---
That's it. Some players vastly prefer being excited to get a couple of bag slots &amp; a small upgrade, the feeling of carving out a tiny foothold in an unforgiving world. Some love their hundreds of mounts, ability to solo old content, doing keys rather than huge raids or massively time-consuming dungeons, etc. Some players enjoy both. Both are Warcraft, always have been.
---
You're prob going to get downvoted here for asking that bc people are stupid and I'm probably going to get downvoted for breaking it that plenty of people people will still play retail and some will play classic until they realize how classic actually was
---
George needs to write his own damn books so we can get a real ending already
---
Many people will probably play both as they're on the same subscription. Classic just demands so much more time than BfA that it might tip the scale in favor of Classic for most people.
---
The difference is pserver accounts are limitless and free; Classic accounts will cost (at minimum) $15. Blizz doesn't have to IP ban as much as a pserver, because auto-squelch/bans will cost farmers hard cash every time.
---
That's OK. I have been mostly unemployed since the end of 2016. :(
---
Aaaaaalso don't forget about the fact that taking a break and coming back like you never left will be A-OK.
---
You make a fair point. I just used the tbc reference as the only classes I've played on pservers are rogue and Paladin.
---
He literally is. I actually liked his YouTube videos but this beta has shown who he really is. 
---
I know that sounds dramatic, but the dude talks constant shit and then whines and makes up excuses when he loses. I honestly don't understand what's entertaining about his stream.
---
Immortal in WoW generally refers to a being being ageless, like the Night Elves pre Hyjal. Upon death they don't die, but then into wisps which are part of the cycle. Or something.
---
Yeah. A 30/0/21 Ele shaman who plays his role right can be a power multiplier. Just got to know when to nuke, when to heal, purge and which totems to pop at what time.
---
Useless until you port over itemlevel viewer also.
---
Actual wow? Vanilla is actual wow for a lot of us :)
---
If you have a level 60, buying food/water for lower level characters isn't a big deal and even if, hypothetically, you could mail conjured items, buying it would be so much easier.
---
At 60 most the time where you'll need water in a quantity that warrents relogging to conjure it, you'll be grouping with people who you could trade it to and they'll trade it back to you on your other character.
---
Now, with that said, I would NOT suggest leveling a mage for the sole purpose of farming, the oppurtunity cost is huge, if you want to play a mage, go ahead, but don't do it just for farming, food/water and/or portals.
---
We're not in 1930s midwest AMerica
---
They can fuckin google it
---
Can somebody tell me about off tanking in vanilla and fury off tanking?
---
This will likely not be well understood here but its like this.....
---
Current WoW is like flying a Jet in Battlefield. You hop in, it automatically starts, your radar automatically works, your targets automatically lock, your gear automatically raises up. All you have to do is move yous stick to point in a direction you want to go. 
---
Classic WoW be like.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMZ_qVf-1OU
---
The game, classic, is SO MUCH MORE tactile than current.
---
24 and I started playing with my dad right on the tail end of vanilla. I remember him and I were rushing like mad to hit 58 before the portal opened. We ended up getting in 5-6 hours after launch or servers became stable.
---
its already part of this addon
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk
---
Yeah servers that crash every 5 minutes is apart of that museum piece too. Can't wait for that!!
---
It makes even less sense to play Classic if that's what you want.
---
Define balance first.
---
I'm about a decade older than you. :/
---
Grenades are the biggest thing. They are castable while moving and incapacitate targets in the thrown area. There are other useful items like rocket boots, rocket helm, spell reflector trinkets, net trinket, but you need engineering to use grenades, and you need grenades to PvP at a high level
---
Standard 20 AD shepherd starter pack equipment.
---
Yeah, but I'd definitely prefer Classic without any addons.
---
It's not fun knowing the people you're going against have tools that literally play the game for them and that you're at a disadvantage if you dont use them.
---
Anyone know of a streamer whos in the classic beta right now and is speed-leveling a rogue solo ?
---
I know ppl want old graphic but still have the option to put higher graphic settings  and it look beautiful its definetly much beter optimisation than vanilla and pserver
---
Your living in the best timeline because you havent had to experience the many years of heartache with current wow
---
Many people quit ages ago.
---
Butts in stuff
---
100% wrong.
---
You're right actually, I started in November but took months to get late 40s..  So yeah, probably circa 2005.
---
I've kept in contact with a couple people, who have kept in contact with a few people etc
---
There's one dude that sent me an email 14 years ago, I logged into my old account and shot him an email and luckily he still used it!
---
I'm delighted that I don't understand this. I still have some sanity left.
---
No I'm laughing at how pathetic you are. It's pretty hilarious.
---
Sad upvote.
---
You THINK you want current WoW devs meddling with Classic, but you DONT.
---
But note, on very old or underpowered computers, the old vanilla client will run better than the Classic client.  
---
People keep making the mistake in thinking that in terms of minimum requirements, Classic has lower requirements than the old vanilla client.  This is not true at all. The vanilla client is very light and can run well on most old machines. The Classic client has higher requirements and will not run on many machines that the vanilla client will.  
---
The difference is that if you are on higher graphics settings, the modern classic client may run better on some machines.  
---
But if you have a old, weak PC the vanilla client may run better. At low settings it is very undemanding of CPU and GPU.
---
Jfc dude you could have sent a letter.
---
So you have never been mistaken about anything ever?
---
You’re probably right, have a wonderful day :)
---
No video, eh?
---
Hi, /u/50cslol
---
Kid is jacked
---
Wasn't trying to be rude btw, was just curious if you got to that point before 2005 lol
---
Huh, so Blozzard fans do have phones.
---
Yeah, fuck playing for the content, raiding and pvp. If not all the classes are being utilized it doesn't make sense for me to play.
---
34 year old boomer?  I'm a 38 year old mellenial, or does boomer mean something else in this context?
---
pretty much yeah.
---
There's a drop down menu in the launcher when you have WoW selected under REGION / ACCOUNT. Beta access will appear there, above PTR access.
---
Lmao pve servers
---
In the battle.net client under wow if your *Region / Account* selection has an option that says *Classic Beta* or something like that you've been invited, if no you haven't.
---
Everyone claiming to have gotten one on reddit so far has been from NA. Also few of my guildies got invite but all of them were NA as well.
---
&gt;I'm not sure how you'd even know that non-streamers weren't playing
---
Because I was on F&amp;F (not alpha) list and not even we got in until day 2? If you got in that early, someone got you in that early, whether you are aware of it or not.
---
Regardlesss, this is a stupid as hell conversation to have because it is _entirely_ missing the point. It doesn't matter who reports the damn bugs. Talking shit just because someone else reported a bug first is incredibly silly.
---
I'm actually in the mindset there should be some hotfixes, everyone goes on about stuff being exactly how it used to be, well it wasn't perfect and I dont see the harm in tweaking a few numbers to make things more balanced and more fun for other classes, I would like to be a prot paladin and be completely viable but I wouldn't be. a few number tweaks could change things.   
---
the feeling of classic wasnt just how the classes were to the EXACT point, its about the feeling of progression and the way the game felt, changing some numbers would not do that if anything enhance that.
---
Who said I want the current devs? I hate bfa, in fact I haven't played since Cata lol
---
Warlocks have more and better CCs 3 fears, banish, seduction, curse of tongues/exhaustion, and devour magic/spell steal. Locks aren’t using their pets for the dmg, they’re for the above utility’s and more. The things that actually make hunters good you missed, tranq shot, and the mana sting shot (locks have drain mana too tho)
---
Hunters don’t really need to manage their threat, they’re not doing enough dps to pull at the high end.
---
He probably doesnt have fuck you money but hes probably doing pretty well for himself being a developer for Bliz for 16 years.
---
Check your drop down menu in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) desktop app.
---
If you see "Classic WoW Beta", you're in. If you don't see it, you're eligible for posting salty threads on this sub.

Whats your favorite McDonald's™ item? For me, it's the McChicken®. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken® sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige. One time I asked for McChicken® sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly McDonald's™ worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". Now the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's™ restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs. I even dip my fries in McChicken® sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.

Crowd pummeled is still better for ferals, as sad as it does sound.

There was so much in vanilla they didn't add till way later that would have been great in vanilla.  Caverns of time, Uldum, grim batol, whatever that gate was in Winterspring, the entirety of Azshara....
---
I would love to see them fill out the classic world without invalidating all the old content personally.
---
Nope, no changes
---
on the right
---
https://i.imgur.com/hXRQdeH.png
---
will say wow classic beta
---
Oh, I can *guarantee* you it's not for nothing...
---
Apparently the books are already written but grrm signed an agreement with d&amp;d not to release until after the show.  This was stated in an interview with Ian McElhinney (barristan selmy)
---
I don't care about karma points at all.
---
Clearly a hunter wep.
---
More stam ia always solid.
---
More mana for more dps
---
85 towards arcane shot etc 85 towards mend pet. 
---
And they'll get a 2nd one. Kind of bonkers for hunter.
---
Omar is all over classicwow today what happened? did he died?
---
Given that Boomer and Zoomer are states of being and belief, you're not a zoomer friend :) welcome to *sip* the club
---
God this is so accurate.
---
Maybe but it's kind of irrelevant since they both share the same subscription
---
The harm is that its already balanced. No spec is great at everything and no spec is useless
---
Who? And who? Who are either of those people?
---
I was banned several times during classic. 
---
One time it was due to a fishing bot as well. 
---
All temp bans thou. 
---
God I was wild.
---
So don't.
---
Group content in vanilla was easy, and will be easy.
---
I see. Well it's been some 12 years so I guess I forgot a hell of a lot. Ty man.
---
&gt;  was just saying that because Thrall has been killed
---
What?
---
He’s been very self aware about that aspect of himself and I would say it’s part of the character.
---
He said it to the effect of “anytime I beat a game or a person, it’s because they’re too easy or too shitty. If a game or person beats me, it’s because they’re broken or cheating.”
---
He turns up the egotistical wow neck beard stereotype to 11, but you’ll notice he’s nothing like that on anyone else’s stream, podcast, or irl stuff.
---
Psyllium is the best !
---
did omar say this?
---
the one in /g?
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure in the months and years after WoW was released, the developers looked at all these things once more and said to themselves "Why did we copy this again? This is no good" and replaced/removed the mechanics.
---
Pretty much all artistic endeavors are iterative. They see something someone else has done and think they can do it better so they make some changes. It's like evolution where A and Z are drastically different but when you see the inbetween letters it makes sense how A got to Z.
---
So some systems are analysed and improved on while others get little attention and are copied without much analysis.
---
That just isn't true. every class had a purpose, not every spec. especially for pve.
---
There was many phases of closed beta and an open beta around march 2004.  I remember watching pvp videos of indalamar from nurfed before I got access to the game myself which was well before release.  I only ever leveled a human rogue in beta and only to level 40.  Made the swap to horde for retail release and went orc warrior.  Good times.  Loved vanilla.
---
Yeah see this is what I meant. No mage trainer in the night elf area, so if you ran over there for mount rep, then you'd need to go all the way back often. At least you could use flight paths on the way back, that helps.
---
I love how the autismo private server rogues that gank lowbies are revealing themselves in this thread.
---
Pally esp ret no one will want you lol
---
Hype wont last for 3 months. It should have been 1 month.
---
Good find. Side note holy JESUS the hunter here is so bad. I am 100% sure this is how I played at 12 years old too lol.
---
Damage, agro, threat all seem screwed. Maybe this game is just way easier than private servers.  
---
I'll let Blizz figure it out.
---
Same here. I started off thinking that classic will be cool for those who enjoy more old-school mmo experiences.
---
Now I'm planning on playing it with some IRL friends and maybe even make my own guild and tank raids as a Warrior, maybe have a pvp alt while at it
---
Future guild name ?
---
A NPC maybe.
---
ah - wasn't aware.  thanks!! =)
---
It’s easier to progress in WoW than it is to develop myself socially and professionally.
---
Whoops...
---
I literally know no one at Blizzard...I've played on and off since the original beta so maybe there's some sort of condition that got me in. Never spoken to a person from Blizz, rarely even posted on any subreddits about this shit until the last few weeks. 
---
I agree with your second paragraph, which is why I responded to your post in the first place. Maybe I misinterpreted what you were saying but it seemed to me that you're supporting this bullshit I keep reading about no one testing the game. 
---
There are a ton of paranoid delusional people on this sub who seem to think the game will be ruined if they don't get invited to beta, and your post to me seemed like someone contributing to this idiot narrative that no one is actually testing the game.
---
Here’s an anecdote: 
---
I was very big into the raiding scene in wod/legion/early bfa getting a number of cutting edge achievements across 5-6 guilds and pretty
---
much every person I’ve talked to about classic since it’s announcement is planning on quitting retail and making classic their main game.
---
You ever type anything that isn't sarcastic?
---
It's one of his famous quotes
---
Imagine not understanding sarcasm
---
He's not a pussy for playing on pve servers. He showed who he really is after his DS3 stream/variety streams in general, unable to take criticism and can't follow basic gameplay instructions. Basically the target audience of LFR even though he clowns on them relentlessly.
---
I think there are more wievers that wanna gank Asmon rather than playing with him.
---
Buy Mordhau on steam it's great.
---
https://www.iswowclassicout.com is good too, it has timer till char creation
---
562 days since Blizzcon 2017, over 1100 days since Nostalrius was closed. 100 days is nothing, it's like running final meters on a marathon with your opponents miles behind you. It just feels soo good, sweet god, we're going HOME
---
IF THEY CHANGE CLASSIC IT IS NO LONGER CLASSIC.
---
Do you people not have phones?!
---
what? rets are great in duels and small scale pvp
---
Classic WoW had a lot of using lower rank abilities. Especially for healers where the the lower healing output was matched by lower mana cost.
---
then name a spec that is useless
---
Teh pact is sealed
---
Yeah
---
Ye i dont have that menu on my wow game for some reason.
---
It makes people here ever madder after they try to talk down to you, and they realize they can't disagree with you. It's great, win win.
---
I guess so yeah. It basically enables you to use other modules than retail wow. I have PTR, my other account and my main account there.
---
This is pretty much it I think. You can measure Asmond’s /played in YEARS, and he has never really quit the game since 2006.
---
If you’re a returning player from 5-10 years ago, you’re not going to be so mistake free in your play.
---
Also i feel like if you don’t have an account that was started around 04/05 right now chances might be pretty slim. Everyone i’ve talked to with it has their account sub date around then.
---
Yet your the one who thinks/assumes the original commenter thinks that went with an unlimited amount of time it's literally impossible to update the old client.
---
It's even more obvious that old programs can be updated.
---
no invite then i guess
---
Omar Gonzalez (on the bottom) was responsible for getting Classic WoW to work on modern code. 
---
Omar Gonzalez (on the top) is an MLS player and that's the meme.
---
nothing interesting. 
---
was asking for someone to post/link dreamfoil, so i could link it to the farmer. 
---
also, i was excited to share who i was talking to and what i was talking about. 
---
not really a conversation of interest.
---
Olympic event, not sure what year, was BG related.
---
 paladins but not holy, holy is the only viable spec for pve end game really. You can play ret but they do not offer enough, I literally remember being turned down from 5 man dungeon runs as a ret paladin back in classic. I don't csre what you say no class should be that bad it gets turned down
---
It's only there if you have two or more accounts to choose from. So in your case, since you only have one regular WoW account it won't show up until you get access to the beta or until you add some other account or the 8.2 PTR.
---
This is a beta test. Chill out...
---
In classic you get pulled into combat by your pet. Just look at the run from joana pretty much anywhere like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW9wP0J--BM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PL49Ga_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n&amp;t=134). Any time the pet auto attacks it puts the master into combat.
---
It's probably in Onyxia's interest to keep humans as leaders of the Alliance and she probably made sure that Dwarves wouldn't rise as leader and Night Elves were always a bit far from Alliance. Plus don't forget that Magni has issues regards to her daughter kidnapped by Taurissan and overall civil war between Dark iron dwarves and bronzebeards/shamble connections to the wildhammer.
---
Neither Him or Esfand knew battle shout caused threat when he was doing deadmines. Unreal
---
You don't happen to have any guildies who work for an unnamed gaming company? ;)
---
And yeah no, not what I was trying to say. Quite the opposite. There are some streamers out there who are indeed reporting bugs, but it is one hell of a stretch to say that every one of them reported this bug the first 5 mins into the game, which is literally what the guy originally claimed.
---
I was under the impression summoning stones were a thing, did I hallucinate that? 
---
That was like 12 years ago though, the details got a little fuzzy
---
Because engineering, coupled with other "gadgets", allow you to play your class to it's maximum potential. 
---
Most engineering items have their purpose in PvP, but the main ones you'll see people utilize are:
---
Iron Grenade, Goblin Rocket Helmet, Gnomish/Goblin Rocket Boots, Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector, Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector, ...
---
You get the idea.
---
been waiting 20 years for classic to come back so i can play my ret pally and duel people at the gates for orgrimmar, this is gonna be LIT! 😋
---
No you didn't
---
It also took me around the same time. I was barely a teen when I started vanilla in early 05. I understand lol
---
Yea, that's pve \^\^, if you check any PvP instances, thats not the case. I can share evidence too if you'd like.
---
Funny how you expect this post to be victim of the bad salty retail player, as if they were the ones waiting for classic 
---
This hate between versions of this game is beyond me tbh...
---
thanks for the reply
---
i'm considering a tauren shaman or a mage. probably gona play on pvp server and focus on healing (later i might choose to go elemental if i get tired of healing in pvp).
---
My goal is to raid and do bgs (mostle dungeon and raids), but i'm concerned that ill not be able to make money as a shaman healer. I was considering going herb + alch, but than id be lacking eng for pvp.
---
Thats why i was considering leveling a mage, so it could make money or farm for herbs/ores.
---
I never played classic, only retail. Id apreciate ur opinion on this
---
I see. Well like i said i could be wrong &gt;&lt; While i am anxious for vanilla at the same time I am not going to over look at "did i get it?" possibilities. just peek from time to time.
---
Sorry to break it to you, at 34 your a millennial.
---
Cant wait to be that rogue
---
Mine's from '04, day 1 of WoW. 
---
... I'm not old :'(
---
It's due to the fact that in the lore, humans outnumber all the other alliance races combined AND have an interest in ruling. Night elves are too disassociated due to their colossal age, and there are too few gnomes and dwarves.
---
Every shit poster always references Unbreakable as a negative.  
---
Enhance is good,  if you play a hybrid style. 
---
Watch Stormx on YouTube and you'll see enhancement is still viable
---
Wow was the first mmo I had ever played and boy I was hilariously bad. Couple that with debilitating lag to where chat messages didn’t show up and NPC’s didn’t properly load it took me longer than most to catch on to this game.
---
My first character ever was a  Tauren Druid because it was the only class not played in my group of 10+ friends in the game. I didn’t realize ‘teleport Moonglade’ was a spell and tried to walk all the way there from Mulgore.  It also took me until running SM to understand I could do more damage in bear or cat form than I can hitting with my staff. 
---
The day WSG released, a friend described how to enter in Northern Barrens. I had never seen a dungeon entrance before so I misunderstood and spent an hour or so jumping through a hole in one of the broken fences. 
---
The good ol days are officially back!
---
okay thanks!
---
&gt; paladins but not holy, holy is the only viable spec for pve end game really
---
heres your problem. you want BFA balance where everyone can raid at a good level with any spec, just wont happen because its not balanced.
---
prot pallies are AMAZING at aoe farming and farming dungeons and ret is incredible at small scale pvp fights and duels.
---
balancing the game around raids that last like 3 hours a week isnt a balanced game when it breaks the other aspects. sorry.
---
When people realize that the dps checks can only be overcome with gear because the classes require no skill to play, I think people are going to get discouraged really quickly.
---
Well, that's something sorta positive in that it has a good end result.
---
Streamers are mostly out of NA, so they haven't invited that many EU players.
---
Its just the drop down box where server is as far as I know, on mine I can see the PTR client for BFA as well as my normal account.
---
It's an interesting qeustion for sure. And I actually have no idea how the market will react to the market that will open up via 'addons like raider.io, gearscore etc. We'll see when it launches I guess.
---
My guess is that there will be as many addons if not more for classic than there is for retail.
---
There are still a LOT of poor people in China, while the state is better off now, the population outside and partly inside the cities is still poor
---
What about savix
---
I know, right?  Reading the other comments is just *sooooo* hard.
---
Small online stores sometimes have it. I'm in Czech Rep and 2 stores still have some available. Try amazon too.
---
Brainlet.
---
Please explain
---
Whatever is left of it after the SW:TOR disaster.
---
^(P.S. still to this day I'm asking myself why I ever bought the collector's edition for that game. 'WoW-killer' my d.)
---
Only if you're a weirdo.
---
It's splenda.
---
I'm sorry for you mate.
---
No, I don't.   
---
There is nothing wrong with wanting a class to be viable for 90% of the game, like dungeons? I'm not talking about fundementally changing the class and making ret have really engaging rotations, i'm talking numbers. rets pve numbers were shocking. and prot doesnt have a taunt. its a tank?
---
Yep the damage being correct is bs and the game is screwed 100%. It’s insane what this sub has become
---
Me too, in small pieces. Also, never exceeding Naxxs loot. But still, I don’t really want them developing an Uldum or grim batol instance from the ground up in 2020. I can’t believe that the design would fit with Vanilla.
---
I remember that when u use just the spacebar u jump upwards, if u use spacebar + w or right mouse buttong u swim
---
My server only ran AV once a week.  Wednesday nights (i think).  It was probably the most impressed I’d ever been by a game.  40 vs 40 with a large battle following the route...mini skirmishes on side paths.  Activating NPCs and watching them fight.  I’d be up until 2am playing.  It was awesome.
---
Why do you expect a a level 28 hunter pet (cat) to take similar damage to a level 30 warrior (with armor buffs) from two completely different mobs?
---
I'd like to see it. The only thing I've seen passed around was a clip from tbc in arenas.
---
so should they buff fury warriors aoe then so they can farm the same as a mage/pally?
---
Nooo he’s the king of stormwind
---
No. His vanilla pvp videos were godlike then and they’re godlike now.
---
Yeah its called the competitors tabard, not sure either tbh.
---
Being aware of being an asshole does not make you a good asshole.
---
Roll PvE?
---
People sacrificed community for convenience and the game suffered for it.
---
I'm looking forward to being social again, making new friends and enemies.
---
Got it, you're a baby boomer at heart, must be with that attitude.  It was a question, not an insult you rude toxic person.
---
I have a feeling a lot of people on this sub had quit retail a while ago so it isn't much for them to solely focus on classic. 
---
That being said, I DO think there will be a large portion of players who will play both
---
59g...behold vanilla!
---
This is one of the fights I am most looking forward to.
---
I deserve a beta invite. I've been playing since it came out, and even before it came out I had been playing Warcraft II, III, TFT, and Diablo 1 and 2, and Starcraft. but I made a new WoW account around 2008-2009 because I think my old one got hacked or something, I don't remember. But now they wont know I've been playing since the game came out, which if they did I would've gotten invited by now. And it fucking sucks. Imagine how many people they invited who don't even care and might not even ever download the beta, and people who don't care about helping and will just fuck around and do nothing helpful whatsoever.
---
the grass is always greener on the other side
---
With a body like that, your character should consider becoming a model (watch out cindy crawford)
---
I don't think the decision was guided by traditional hype generation strategy. Everyone I talked to in general in the starting areas played a lot during classic on the account that received the invite, maybe saw one person mention being under 30. Most of us are not going to tear up social media, they just wanted to start with a big wave of people who were there at the beginning back in the day.
---
It was sold out the first day. Your only chance is local retailers
---
A lot of these are from the WoW Diary by John Staats, which came out in the last couple of months for Kickstarter backers, and should be available on Amazon soon-ish
---
https://www.amazon.com/WoW-Diary-Journal-Computer-Development/dp/B07LB927QF
---
It's a really amazing compendium on the development of WoW from '99-'04, and reads very easily. I'd highly recommend it.
---
Scuffed wow
---
How about dont be a dumbass and drink with your back to a wall if you suspect a rogue is in the area?
---
This is what we enjoy about vanilla wow.
---
Sacrifice your first born.
---
Email will be in within 7-10 business days after blood accumulation reaches 3 pints.
---
Same. There were games around August / September I wanted to get day 1, not anymore with Classic launching late August. Just trying to enjoy FFXIV and Mordhau until launch.
---
Mach bitte weiter mit deinen Screenshots, pure Nostalgie!
---
Yeah, today it's very abstract. The differences are the so-called "fantasy rpg elements".
---
Some can argue that the best part about WoW was the dungeons, and that's what modern WoW provides and provides well. Just happens to be that my favorite part is questing and PvP.
---
Thanks! I wanted to watch priest gameplay because I will probably main one and I have no idea how they work :)
---
They're all over private servers atm so yes, you'll be getting those whispers a lot.
---
Given how much you have been downvoted maybe you could see how what you said holds no ground. But feel free to believe you had an argument in the first place. Calling you out with you replying I lost an argument is all anyone needs to know. Good day
---
This Time i get Thunderfury!!!!!!!!
---
boar charge is not an interrupt in classic, it's just a root.
---
I would say the key to winning bg's consistently is to group up for them.
---
Make friends with healers,druids, hunters, etc. and queue together.
---
Most BG's are just a tossup where most players are just playing team death match without too much focus on objectives.
---
I would advise not to pick a faction based on this. You can do just as good in pvp on Alliance as you can on Horde if you're committed.
---
&gt; There is nothing wrong with wanting a class to be viable for 90% of the game
---
every class is viable in raids. the ONLY class you could argue needs a buff that isnt complete nonsense is resto druids but theyre still required in a raid(and your heavily compensated for playing one with tons of gear).
---
&gt;and prot doesnt have a taunt. its a tank?
---
if they buff warriors ability to farm it'd make sense, but thats how we got BFA. im really glad youre not balancing the game or getting what you want
---
yeah im pretty sure it only happened once
---
And GRRM denied it pretty much instantly.
---
Rogues wouldn’t care about Intellect.
---
never a better time that when a new server starts up.
---
his version of "balance" is everyone can do everything. literally retail LOL
---
I don't get why people want to play beta so much.  You'll just have to start over soon, I'd rather keep the game fresh for the real launch instead of risking burnout.  Not to mention beta has bugs, will probably have lots of stability issues during stress tests etc.
---
We literally have no idea.
---
I quit "WoW" in Cata because I missed playing WoW in 2005.
---
I'm German...
---
Why would you not take back your old account?
---
Looks like you illegally sold it and now trying to be the bigger person by not taking it back....
---
 Congrats! Be sure to send me some game footage!
---
You never said Cheers?
---
for pvp a bit but its a curve and progresses as you go not a brick wall where your complete shit for pve its super easy
---
Bc the only time a rogue gets behind you is when you're drinking. They def never camp your body, wait for you to fight, camp the roads..
---
Did you talk to the farmer after this or was it your only interaction?
---
No not really.
---
I check email on the phone like twice a day, there are days where I dont get to the computer but if i got that email id have to make a way to get to it haha. 
---
Yes this is beta, well spotted. It is also a tool for Blizz to gather feedback about the current state.
---
&gt;just to make my account active in case it helps my chances.  
---
I believe they confirmed that having an active sub is currently mandatory for beta access.  So yes, it is increasing your chances infinitely.
---
Any place I can find attacking and casting animations for races? Not sure whether to make my shaman troll male or female
---
Are rogues hard to play?
---
I played a Dwarf Hunter to about 63 during Wrath and a Destro Troll Warlock to 105 in Legion.
---
Been interested in Rogues/Warriors because honestly they look cool, I've always been easily swayed by glowy enchants on huge ass swords.
---
Balance druid
---
Hi, /u/Locolex1
---
Wow that would be a big oversight if true. Crushing blows were the primary reason to use shield block on cooldown as warrior.
---
[https://youtu.be/ACM3yXuz0Hw?t=17](https://youtu.be/ACM3yXuz0Hw?t=17)  [https://youtu.be/B8grtYurXAI?t=79](https://youtu.be/B8grtYurXAI?t=79)    
---
Then I have 30 other clips post-vanilla. But its very easy to catch if you just look through videos
---
It doesn't force a purge. You bait purge with them and heal when they are on global. 
---
Nature swiftness isn't on the global either. Big secret? There's an entire list of consumables that act this way.
---
Like, not at all? Why the fuck do people spread these lies? Druids are awesome healers, slightly worse than priests and equally good as shamans. I've mained Druid @ Nost and will play as Druid in Classic.
---
For the rest of wow, but mop was probably the best time for world pvp on emerald dream.
---
Alrighty, figured as much. Thanks so much for taking the time to respond. :)
---
I agree with most of this. There are certain lines I don't.  
---
addons: fuck that, blizzard's UI is ugly and doesn't scale well at higher resolutions, looked fine on 2005 CRT monitors. also the textures are fuckugly.  
---
maps: i'm sure he provided more detail about this with his voice so i'll let it pass. if i had the vod/clip i'd probably be persuaded by whatever argument he made.  
---
transmogs: even if clientside players will get around this, within the limitations of gameplay and current content a transmog system won't be an issue because players will still have to earn their appearances. *a player who transmogrified all of their gear into felheart will have to have participated in every raid required to get that set.* modern transmog is offensive because acquiring the appearances of old gear which was previously earned through teamwork is now easily soloable by anyone with a warrior at level cap.  
---
macros: good fucking luck forcing the ten years of gaming peripherals market development to be unused by players. realistically if blizzard didn't supply classic players with their own macro system the players would instead go to their razer/logitechG/corsair/autohotkey/etc software to create macros instead.
---
Thats the reason I never touched private servers. I don‘t want my character to be gone from one day to another
---
Well, TBC and Wrath had arguably better balancing in terms of character and character design.
---
you can honestly think what you want about my opinion, I'll play it regardless and probably enjoy myself. I just know playing a ret paladin whilst leveling and towards max level wasn't great. literally laughed at if I wanted to DPS a 5 man group.
---
There is alot more to classic than a few number tweaks im sorry. People do not like classic for its class design. they like it for a hell of a lot more.  
---
Old school runescape is Basically classic runescape but guess what, they take new ideas and apply it and guess what the game is probably the second most popular MMO out there.
---
Lol I was just making a joke.
---
They have a raid of like 30, eventually misses and small hits add up
---
This is just one of these baffling classic hater comments. Like Im playing on private server none stop for the last 2 years. Also no there wont be much differences between pservers and classic just minor bug fixes and number changes mostly. Im already playing this game I just want a decent server that is there to stay and I wanna start anew.
---
Its more that in Classic more is expected of you. You need to make your own groups, manage your mana, use different ranks of spells, etc. Theres another layer of work to achieve the goal and you don't get to skip that layer to go right to achieving the goal.
---
I'll be referencing this later, thanks for the post!
---
Did you ever play without LFG in the game? Putting in warlock is nothing like teleportation to the dungeon.
---
Oh wait, of course you didn't. Otherwise you wouldn't even try to make addon like this.
---
Joana's world record is 4 days and 20 hours /played back in 2006 on real Blizzard servers.
---
If you play 16.5h every day and be as fast as him you'll be 60 in a week.
---
Where can I read about the difference between layering and sharding according to blizzard? 
---
I agree it's concerning.
---
Best answer so far! Thanks bud!
---
"Actual wow" is so successful that Blizzard don't even report sub numbers anymore. It wasn't a great look to report your sub numbers shrinking relentlessly.
---
If you want classic without changes why don't you play a private server?
---
Can someone explain the Omar memes? Why is everyone suddenly praising him? Did something happen recently?
---
People who say Druids suck in PvP don't know what they're saying. Druid has the highest skill ceiling in entire game. Just take a look at this guy, he nukes mage and warrior. SOLO.
---
https://youtu.be/XQwH0atQZ0Q
---
Well I think Omar just sold me on a McChicken. Damn that Omar guy is good.
---
Can you be more specific? The off tank's job is to tank until their mark is dead, and if someone pulls an add, the off tank picks it up. If you're off tank you're expected to have the +defense gear required even if Fury spec. Anything else you need to know?
---
I guess im a normie.
---
modern WoW has way too many shortcuts. You can if you want pretty much do all your leveling in the dungeons and never see the world. Exploration ,discovery,immersive environment all took a back seat to the frantic levelers who want nothing more than to get to the end so they can bitch about the grind to get their item level the highest. A virtual e-peen measuring stick.
---
Is Trade chat going to be cross layer? If not, this is moot. Since there's no way to advertise your layer. If you leave it you need someone else to be there to invite you back, basically having a network of players to invite you back and forth between layers, I mean, it's not a big deal, not for me atleast.
---
Trust blizz when they say it's only on at start, and start complaining if they ACTUALLY fuck up the points you psoted. Crying for something that MIGHT happen is kinda eh..
---
Classic IS balanced, if you look at it from a PVP/5mans/40mans/leveling perspective. You can’t look at a specs performance in raising and say they’re useless. Vanilla is primarily about the 1-59 journey, not min/maxing at 60. But If that’s what you are solely into, then pick a class/spec that allows that. 
---
Take hunters... yes, their damage sucks late game, but they’re the easiest class to level and have great utility in PVP. If they “balanced” them to do better damage, everybody would play one, and it would be the new flavor of the month. 
---
Meanwhile, Warriors are OP with good gear, and can do two roles. But they’re the most painful to level, which puts many people off from playing one. Boomkins have bres, innervate, stealth, heals and high armor, but if they need X% more mana regen, they’d be infinite ammo tanks of obliteration. 
---
Could there be the smallest tweeks? Yes, and I wouldn’t necessarily rage. But you have to look at the game from an all inclusive perspective, not just how you parse in endgame raids.
---
Literally the only difference is layering isn’t cross realm while sharding is
---
&gt; There is a difference of the beta version having mark of the wild, which gives 25 armour. Is that enough to make up the difference? It's not enough to explain the difference
---
On one hand, I agree layering is awful. On the other hand, lead designer's promise should mean something. They can't just expect to break it with no consequences. So I'm cautiously opimistic it will indeed be temporary.
---
Waiting 3 hours to complete one quest? Just don't go to another layer.
---
Why don't you just go play on a private server then lmao
---
If we resub now and register for the beta do we still have a chance? Or is it only prior subs?
---
The video was demonstrating the crit potential against a sitting target. If they decide to camp then you call in help. There are always plenty of people around that want to fight.
---
I'll do it later tonight if I get a chance.
---
In my experience this has always been a non issue.  
---
My private server characters lasted 5 and 4 years (last one still going on)    I don't even play a character that long, after a year or 2 the natural life span of a lvl 60 has been reached, whether you play pve or pvp.  I do appreciate it that I can still log in and say hello to old friends, but I wouldn't shed any tears if I had to retire them.  Especially if you have established other ways of communication with your friend lists.
---
The only reason for me to return to such a character for real would be the launch of TBC on the same server, I would really like that.
---
pvp druids play balance all the time? thats stormx's main spec for premades
---
i think classic just has this perfect balance of you can do this on your own but it is faster and beneficial to join up with random people. and due to the slower nature of the game you get time to chat with them and maybe make some friends.
---
it was by no means intentional of blizzard it just worked out to be perfect. i really hope blizzard takes a long hard look at this for the future of modern WoW inorder to get people back to talking to eachother.
---
is it confirmed that the level cap will be raised? i see no gain from initially capping it if blizzard has the intent of letting us test higher level content aswell
---
this was the only time.
---
Same here. You gotta trust people sometimes.
---
Classic killed gaming for me as soon as it was announced
---
Like Tipsout would have a clue...
---
Is it feasible for someone with not much classic experience, but who plans on playing hardcore at launch, to get the Black Qiraji Battle Tank mount? I don’t really understand how to get it.
---
We need a guild based on our lord and savior Omar
---
It was noted recently that Omar single-handedly created a rough client that proved to Blizzard management that it was possible to have Classic run on modern server infrastructure
---
Well, even if you main shaman and "lock" a profession to engineering (as you should), you still have a second profession to make money, not to mention fishing (which I've heard is good, but never done myself).
---
Even then consider how much you'd actually have to farm for the mage to pay back itself.
---
If you're decently fast (which you wont be on your first couple characters) you're leveling it in 6ish days playtime, that's 144 hours you could have spent on farming with the shammy, even if we assume a measly 10g/hour for the shaman that's 1440g you've "lost" leveling the mage, and then it needs an epic mount on top putting you at 2240g, but as you'd probably make some money while leveling the mage, lets just assume 240g to make the numbers "rounder", so all in all you've lost 2000g on making a mage.
---
Now, if we assume the mage can make 50g per hour, we're looking you're looking at an addtional 50 hours to the mage's playtime before the investment is paid back (calculating in the money the shaman would've made while you're grinding).
---
So 194 hours our about 8 days of playtime for the mage to pay back itself, and that's of course ignoring the fact that you can't just farm on your mage, you *need* to farm on your shaman as well as certain consumables are bop. It's also being very generous with the 1-60 time, assuming you have the money ready to buy an epic mount and very conservative with the shamans potential earnings.
---
Or give Warriors a heal spec to be fair to both sides .
---
I'm usually playing Alliance. Believe me, we never have heals, never have team play, always 3 players AFK leeching, 6 braindead farm mid. I wish I was Horde so people actually care about winning a BG...
---
das wars leider scho mn für heute. kann da frühestens kommendes wochenende nochmal drüber schauen. 
---
macht vermutlich mehr sinn einmal alle fotos (kmapp 4000 aus classic, knapp 10k overall wow) zu sichten und hochzuladen. aber das kostet auch zeit, da einiges enthalten ist was ich nicht ins internet hochladen will.
---
&gt;Trust blizz when they say it's only on at start
---
I wouldn't.
---
Diablo 3 season 17!!
---
It looked like it was every day during the week and nobody's been added this weekend. I'm hoping a bunch of people are added for the stress tests.
---
Kill yourself.
---
Look at how layering actually works then try again buddy.
---
*sips*
---
Deadmines, now THAT was a dungeon.
---
I will donate $100 to charity if I see a single person trying to sell a layer invite. This is ridiculous. 
---
It’s going to be a minor annoyance that you don’t even notice 99% of the time.
---
This is precisely the correct time to give feedback on glaring issues. If not beta - when?
---
Yes. 90% of vanilla pservers were PvP, and the few that were PvE, were always super underpopulated.
---
It's easy enough for Blizz to break addons if they want to. We just have to wait and see what the masses want.
---
Ret and prot are viable in dungeons. Just not raids, mostly. Even then I’ve seen some badass ret and prot pallies in ZG.
---
I don't think that's correct, there is a good amount of discussion threads that are upvoted. You can't just blame the community in general for posts being downvoted.
---
If a person creates a successful post is because they are competent writers and know how to start a healthy discussion, which will attract the attention of the minority that want to engage in an intelligent, rational argument.
---
Even if the majority of the community is toxic, discussion posts that deserve to be upvoted will be upvoted, and if someone's post fails is just because they aren't capable of attracting the healthy discussion-prone minority.
---
You're getting better every drawing!
---
The literal literal god of classic wow
---
now thats the spirit!
---
tbh i was thinking this in the kara video on youtube 
---
he cant hit the mobs much at all because they are all skulls and has many healers healing their ass off 
---
one healer pulls agro multiple times but id say the majority of the time or a good 50% of the time he was able to hold agro.
---
i could be off there may have been mechanics at low level to help tanks keep threat.
---
tbh during the kara video i was thinking wouldnt a holy paladin be the best tank for skull mobs just let them pull because you cant miss with healing threat 
---
a bunch of hunters and holy paladin tanks seems like a good comp for skull mob tanking
---
Actually, IIRC throughout all of retail, a majority of the population was PvE servers.
---
Then you have some serious trust issues, and you should probably get that checked.
---
I wouldn't bother with thistle tea while levelling.  Depending on how much extra time it takes to craft, it probably won't even speed things up much.  Its probably gonna be too expensive anyway.
---
You can't play tauren mage
---
&gt;  People do not like classic for its class design
---
couldnt be more wrong.
---
&gt;literally laughed at if I wanted to DPS a 5 man group.
---
thats part of the game. people dont want arms warriors in raids, no one wants locks over mages in 5mans its just the way it is. if you choose to play less effective specs by your own free will then you have to put in more effort to do it.
---
as a paladin you have both the choices to tank or heal and get 5man groups very easily whereas a warlock just has to either make the group or find people who cant find a mage.
---
I feel like there's no way you could put a -45% attack speed debuff on raid bosses and nobody knew about it or used it. Considering some of the truly far-fetched tricks people have discovered on private servers, there'd have to be some reason noone's using what would be the strongest debuff in the game by orders of magnitude.
---
streamers tend to avoid pvp servers so roll on a pvp server
---
i played both in vanilla and pserver, agree to disagree ? lol
---
Core i5 9600 / Nvidia 2060 / 16 GB RAM / &gt;= 256GB SSD
---
It will cost you a bit more than a grand.
---
Add another grand for a gigantic 4K ultra wide screen.
---
You can get something more expensive but it won't run WOW better.
---
Every raid needs a couple druids. They have sleep, an insane instant tank heal, and good heal over time. They are a different type of healer than the other classes.
---
Try not to argue yourself down next time.
---
I do like the idea of world PvP, but sadly 99% of world PvP is just ganking. Nobody ever attacks you unless you're at a disadvantage, whether through a large difference in level, or you're fighting a mob, or whatever.
---
I just want to collect my 10 bear asses in peace.
---
The problem is people will outlevel the items, unless it's cloth or a resource.
---
Damn, nice! How much did it cost? Could you show us the index?
---
We did that too, and there STILL were startup guilds looking for players. And since the pants drop off Rag, you’re sure to see Molten Core runs.
---
You see, here is the problem with people asking for changes, be it balance or content.
---
You guys are asking for class balances that are serving YOUR play style, how you remember playing the game, your end game. Whether its pvp, pve, raiding, RPing, doesn't matter. 
---
The REALITY is that every spec for every class served a purpose, but it may not have served you.
---
5
---
Thank you ? lol
---
No. You can get good gear from PvP. The set bonuses are actually rather impressive.
---
You only need rank 6-7 (?) To get some decent gear, which is easily obtained.
---
Worth noting you can only enable/disable warmode in SW and Org I believe - so you cant just flip the switch when losing.
---
If your guild decides to let you be the one to get it and you bang the gong in the ten hour window, yes.
---
Some people say even he doesn't know what he meant when he wrote this.
---
Fair enough, to each their own. It's not like any class in wow is spectacularly difficult -- even to "master".
---
Was the population in favor of the Horde? If so it might explain your experience.
---
Please see edits? I appreciate my comment may seem short sighted, but I believe my point is based on the most reasonable scenario.
---
Buy Mordhau on steam, it's just great.
---
You can't switch trinkets
---
i would agree for raiding but i beleive he was talking about everything in general but if its just raiding i do agree on shaman heals and spriest for mana battery but i dont remember if they had that ability in vanilla...lol been a min
---
and buff shield wall to be bubble instead
---
Do we need it? Maybe not. 
---
Do we deserve it? Abso-fuckin-lutely.
---
You have a lot of time on your hands sir.
---
If they just forgot to add in Argent Tournament, I wouldn't mind either.
---
Addons don't and can't play the game for you though, the only thing they can do is make the information the game already provides in a much more efficient way, depending on how you set them up.
---
They do have regional servers over there, IIRC. Korea/Taiwan servers.
---
I have, for years. Now Blizz making Classic without changes, gonna be fun.
---
Raiding gear will always be the superior gear. You can only get so far with dungeon gear. While you might not get *steamrolled*, you will definitely have a tough time against those who do have really good raiding gear.
---
My recommendation with that is to perhaps choose to support and heal others more rather than going solo 1vs1 majority of the time.
---
Good points. I'm hoping the new client will be better at utilizing new hardware and pushing high framerates. I can't even imagine how sick it would be to have over 120 FPS standing on top of the Org bank
---
Truth
---
6% upvoted. /thread
---
The paladin was lvl 32 and the mobs were grey
---
Would you rather have your server for 6 months in and pay for a transfer?
---
Layering is a good solution for long-term server health. Blizzard knows exactly what going to happen. A shit ton of people will make characters. A small percentage will continue playing. This is the necessary evil necessary to prevent blizzard creating way too many servers in launch.
---
I've played on and off every expansion 
---
I can name maybe two zones from each expansion at most after WOTLK. I don't remember any quests except for the wine making one. I legitimately enjoyed two zones (Dread Wastes and Suramar) since cata.
---
I don't remember half my character names. I don't remember the names of their important talents because it doesn't even matter, and I don't remember any of the guilds, people I played with, even the raids I barely recall.
---
And yet I remember all this in detail from playing vanilla to wotlk 10+ years ago. When WoW was an RPG I made meaningful choices that I remember. For my 10th birthday my dad used some of his epic mount fund to buy my rogue Gut Ripper, right when I could use it. I farmed gnomer for hours for Toxic Revenger because I thought it would make my character stupid powerful (spoiler alert: it's 30 seconds of being unable to gouge or blind in aoe for like 1 DPS increase, nope)
---
Good I miss old wow. Sorry for text wall reckoning bomb
---
I wish they at least gave the kid is own unique art.
---
I used to do that with 3 people to farm sfk
---
Also... I thought lupos was confirmed doing physical damage in the beta.
---
It just comes down to the humans being the most powerful and influential (and numerous) race of the alliance, and probably of all of Azeroth.
---
Cool, and guess what you can still have that feeling of everything having a purpose WITH some balancing changes. classes can still be the BEST at something, I have no problem with it. I dont want paladins to pop off the same damage as everyone else. I want there to be a difference but that doesnt mean numbers cant be tweaked. I'm sorry you guys are literally in the past. some things are better off slightly changed.  
---
I'm not even asking for new content, I'm not asking for new rotations I'm not asking for anything gamebreaking, a slight increase to numbers or a decrease to whatever will not change the game and make it BFA. i'm sorry.
---
Is there a bustling wotlk pserver?
---
I'd love to get a quick nostalgia kick.
---
Fuck, I'd be willing to pay double the current sub fee if they had wotlk.
---
I wasn't there and I dont know the exact things needed to be done. But from what I got, building some1 up to redeem it, requires ALOT of time and support from guildies. Also, once turned in by one person, there seems to be a 10hr window where others can turn it in. (Shared resources and time consuming, again, not many other people will be able to finish it in time) There seems to be the consensus that in most cases the GL or MT (very often the same person) from whatever guild is fastest will get the first, and then others may. Although the whole thing may also be shared by a collective of guilds, leaving a few GL/MTs with the mount.
---
I don't know, decursive, healbot etc are pretty autonomous.
---
Also add ons are a bit more advanced now compared to 2006.
---
*crack*
---
*siiiiiiiip*
---
I'll be sitting at the AH in Darn, flipping mats for moola.
---
You think that you want balance but you don't. #Nochanges
---
Rather than crying that your class/spec is underpowered, make sure to play the one that is OP. Unlike back in the day, it's pretty well known, which spec is strong and which spec is a meme. If you pick a meme spec, then you just have to live with your choice, rather than complaining about it being not optimal.
---
CR, MotW, ability to tank everything (MT raids too even though this role often suits warriors better), very strong in 1v1, good flag carrier, hybrid specs allowing to perform few roles, TP to Moonglade... No, druid is a very good class.
---
The appeal of making the game like Diablo 3 is that players will replay the same content for hundreds and hundreds of hours.
---
The goal of a lot of game developers right now is to make one multiplayer map that people will replay infinitely.
---
I’m 13 years older now.. I’m also happy to remember the characters the way I left them and not seeing them destroyed with a new look or whatever he has done to them. All I want is to play the beta lol..
---
Not as fast in Vanilla.  Especially casual players.
---
i was talking about the pservers.
---
I'll take it!
---
Wow, so these are the infamous vanilla graphics everybody wants? So beautiful!
---
He's literally playing a character... lmao
---
Just FYI: The [unedited version](https://youtu.be/5_ZPdLEprMg?list=PL49Ga_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n&amp;t=9465) is a lot easier to see behaviors in.
---
Spamming court of stars? Explain please
---
Lol dude, you are aware there are PvE realms right?
---
And there are factors for that that was explained.
---
This is a copy&amp;paste from like three days ago, same exact wording. Can you go away, please?
---
Were you subbed already?
---
Does anyone know of a streamer attempting feral tanking in the beta?  I plan on a gatherer feral druid for an alt and wanted to see how tough it will be to tank early dungeons.
---
Still not addressing the fact you sold your account and now that you want to play it again, you’ll need to jump through some hoops.
---
If a hacker legitimately stole your account, why wouldn’t you take it back?
---
Probably because it was the Star Wars IP and ot was BioWare.
---
It should have been the golden combo. That was what I at the time thought.
---
These guys will get their dumbing down of the game just u wait.
---
Dunno, Grob was an easy boss.
---
He’s trolling, why are you so mad?!
---
Not when I played, PvP servers had massive queues and were the “preferred” way to play. Even now private servers mimic this, PvE servers have a fraction of the population that PvP one’s do.
---
How do end game raids work? Like a lot of people talk about competing with other guilds. Once a guild does a raid, is it wiped for everyone on the server, or only those people?
---
The ones that move names/health bars are but it's not that bad tbh, you can easily see which one is needing a heal or whatever so all it does is move the frame you're going to click. And they are you're right but again those still aren't going to play for you, it's more information efficiency.
---
Hey thanks for the advice! I will probably do that or charge to tank 5 man's for people. Gotta pay that repair bill lol
---
What bear mount is that from vanilla?
---
Wrong, it does.

---
&gt; To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test.
---
They will indeed happen without streamers. Happened all the time back in the day. That being said I’ve been playing with Asmondgold/Esfand and guild and it’s been really enjoyable. Everyone sharing loot, helping each other, random raids and exploring hidden stuff. I’m not a big fan of streamers but I also don’t blindly hate them like most in this sub.
---
Depends on what level the items are. If you're listing a bunch of like level 5-15 greens, then yeah people will outlevel before the auction closes.
---
Addons like gearscore, an automated lfg/lfr tool, [r](https://r.io)aider i.o etc will ruin the game. It won't feel authentic at all.
---
Blizzard has to take actions to prevent that cancer from spreading. A zero tolerance policy NEEDS to be put in place and any attempt to work around blizzards code must be dealt with accordingly. The addon(s) need to be rendered useless. If it were up to me though, I'd also shadow ban the author.
---
Essential addons that were around like nameplates, raid frames etc are completely fine.
---
at what resolution?  at what graphic setting? 
---
some people cant accept they know what they are talking about and exclude important facts to fit their narrative.
---
Great work, proud of you 👍
---
How do you know if you get a beta key
---
No i i have not been subed since early legion ( only played 1 week in legion ) . But i subed the day they acounced release date and also update my profile . But my account is nov 2004 old and ive played in the open . According to most ppl in beta ppl that got invited are either  streamer/influencer or 2004 account
---
Nihilo (I will double check name) is leveling feral. He has ran a couple of dungeons.
---
Scary accurate
---
I’ve been pretty honest about the fact that I sold them I think?
---
If it was a hacker it would be another story.
---
I personally think it will happen. But I think it'll happen steathily. And with launch.
---
How do you know if you get a beta access key?
---
Im sorry, theyre not changing it. Its 100% not going to happen. 1.12 is what theyre giving us, they even warned us that we might not like it, but thats what were getting.
---
the biggest addon that i think goes against the idea of classic is an gearscore addon
---
i really dont want to see groups and guilds recruiting people by some arbitary number
---
GS requirements in modern wow are fucking stupid, plenty of shit players have good gear.
---
but the biggest impact it has is on people who start late.
---
so say 8 months after classic launches some kid wants to try classic and needs MC gear but all the guilds and raids require BWL+ gearscore to get into the content
---
this has been an issue in retail wow ever since people started using GS as the measuring ruler for player skill
---
I started vanilla rather late after AQ was out and was able to get into a good guild in blues and greens and recieve gear from all raids.
---
if i was required to be in full epics to get into a good guild i would not have continued playing and i ended up a core raider in that guild
---
Cataclysm Garrosh was my favorite Warchief. Definitely was more in line with the whole "Warchief of the Horde" type of deal. I was never really fond of Thrall. Unfortunately Blizzard is known to make horrendous lore decisions and turned both Garrosh and Sylvanas into warmongering retards out of the blue.
---
Only for the people taking part in the raid. Competing versus other guilds is mostly about who makes it first/faster
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHA
---
That is pretty damn unlikely lol
---
never seen under a certain framerate without posting resolution or graphic settings.  ya, that's an acceptable argument to dispute my point.
---
how do u refresh the client?
---
Most of the PvP servers were dead though. There were just a very small number of active ones, hence the big queues.
---
So what content do you do everyday for years if you dont mind me asking
---
Back in 2004 I was 20 and I got a chance to play the WoW beta. I created a human warlock and got to around level 28 I think. One day during the beta Lakeshire got attacked and I was still very low level. I ran over to Lakeshire from Elvyn Forrest, and as you may know there's a small hill on the road right before Lakeshire. That's when I first saw the horde ingame. A tauren shaman named Duke standing on the same hill and his troll rogue buddy sitting casually beside him with his elbows resting on his knees. They were blocking the road for alliance players. There were rumors that they were around level 50...their level was skull to me. As I was standing there with probably 15-20 other players not daring to get closer the troll rogue vanished. He was gone! ...it was a blood bath and soooo badass. After that I decided I want to play horde when the real game comes out.
---
Fast forward to 2005 (europe release), I created an undead warlock which was my main for a long time...but I think by the time BWL hit live, I started to level my troll rogue just because I remembered that troll rogue from the beta. I wanted to be as badass as him. I never had a premade and grinded BGs like a maniac for 8 weeks straight until I reached rank 10 and completed my set. It was one of the best gaming experiences I ever had in my life and I'm so looking forward to return to make new memories!
---
On pve every dps is very simple. pvp is another story...
---
When the phase hits, a BWL quest becomes available, the quest item can only be looted by 1 person per raid. After doing that, you need to grind Brood of Nozdormu rep, several thousand mobs of grinding, in man hours, id say its in like the 300 hour area. Not something really feasible by yourself. Then you have to travel the world killing world bosses, which take a raid, as well as a few more MC/BWL quests.
---
So you sold your account now you need to deal with those consequences unless you are willing to forcefully retrieve it. 
---
If you aren’t going to retrieve it, pretend like it is impossible to get back and move on.
---
You are obviously conflicted on what to do, or else you wouldn’t have made this thread.
---
If it were me, I’d retrieve it and let the other guy kick rocks.
---
Classic dungeons are not as hard as people remembered, shock.
---
I never enjoyed playing rogue so thats why
---
It's wrong is what I mean
---
I didn't play mop personally. I skipped that one. For my money nothing in world pvp has held a candle to vanilla though. Definitely partly because of how new it was to me, but I hate what flying did to world pvp personally.
---
any private server
---
Unless he was trolling, Soda said in his stream this morning that he's thinking about going PvE at release.
---
Where do you draw the line between 'essential' addons and non essential?
---
From what i understand, warrior is the superior tank in all matters, except pvp flag carry. While druid tanking seems to be very viable up until preraid (no personal experience, just information i gathered), warrior pulls ahead even harder after that. MT also always warriors afaik
---
It would be like trying to recover a dead language.
---
Most of the PvE servers were dead though. There were just a very small number of active ones, hence the big queues.
---
Alright man I apologize then, I think we're probably on the same side on this crap. Way too many people freaking out over nothing. 
---
My retail guild is basically the leftovers of the same guild I raided with in vanilla. There are a handful of people we've picked up along the way but no one works for Blizz haha. 
---
Only two of us are in beta so I would think they would have hooked more up if that was the case :P
---
I can't speak to the difficulty of hunter. From what I've read, people seem to say it's really easy to get into, but difficult to master. You'll need to learn to properly kite and in raids you have more utility than you would believe, with tranq shot, freezing traps, etc. I can speak to lock as it was my main in vanilla (had 5-6 bosses down in naxx by the time BC hit)
---
Lock leveling is easy, albeit not as easy as hunter. I definitely think they are more difficult to play and master in pvp and pve however. You have a number of great specs to learn and master. 
---
For PVP, you have a ton of utility and damage. You have fantastic cc abilities in fear and seduction, you can dispell with your felhunter, you can create shields for yourself with your voidwalker. There is a very high skill cap in managing your pets. A felhunter can insta win a fight vs a caster, and a void sac can save you against melee. 
---
As for PVE, don't let people tell you that all you'll be doing is spamming Shadowbolt, or that you'll never be dotting because of limited debuff slots. This is not the case in reality. Not every fight is a Patchwerk style dps race, where all melee and ranged dps just stand there and pop off. There will be fights where you are forced to move around, where melee aren't as effective, where there will be multiple mobs/adds, etc. Maximizing your dot effectiveness will still play a role. 
---
There's something really special about knowing that you aren't limited by your health and mana pools like other classes are, especially in raids. You can lifetop to regain mana, and then drain life to get your health back. This creates a fun scenerio whereby your only real limiting factor is the threat you generate. The interesting part about threat is that bigger hits and crits generate far more threat than dot ticks (and drain life) so managing it as a lock is very unique and provides a lot of potential to min/max.
---
What are some confirmed game changes from the beta because of the newer engine? Like camera angle further, stealth animation updated?
---
Please be more specific
---
Hmm... My account is from dec 2004. I wonder if I subbed would I get beta access.
---
Anything ever?
---
Of course
---
Do I get it diametrically opposed to reality? Rarely lol
---
He wasn't just a little off
---
I am saving the output to the matrix, copy it to excel, match it with names and used guide on sankeymatic for importing from excel. It's pretty straightforward
---
Really? Kinda whack
---
Ppl who subed definetly have higher chance i beleive , did you update you beta profile?
---
As long as you are subbed at the time a possible future wave of beta access goes out, you'll be able to be ones of the lucky ones.
---
BAN THIS SHIT POST
---
Decursive was indeed ez mode when MC/Onyxia  was the only tier, but seeing as WoW Classic is based on 1.12, it’d already been “fixed” by API changes by then. Ditto for complex conditional
---
macros at this point.
---
And boy oh boy did people bitch when those changes were made.
---
I would love alternative timeline. Think a timeline where we didn't manage to stop Kel'Thuzad for example. Or a timeline where the dragons abandoned us.
---
yes, because i would run a gtx 1080 without a proper chipset.
---
No the bear is from WoTLK, the toon was logged into a few times after classic to equip mounts or pets and some events I think. Whenever I logged in she was in hellfire peninsula at the stronghold doing the first bc quests.
---
The only dungeons I remember having problems back while leveling in 2004 was Zul Farrak pyramid event. Groups had horrible dps/healing/tank half the time too.
---
Pog
---
this post isnt joke guys
---
Did you clear naxx as a healer druid?
---
On the launcher above the PLAY button there was is a dropdown where you can select between WoW and WoW Classic, I noticed it and was able to make a character a few hours before I received the actual email
---
I mean, collectively they have like a million fucking viewers. It's not like they can all fit on one server.
---
No?? why in the actual fuck would they do that.
---
I remember loving Halo 3 and playing some counter strike. Not to mention growin g up with Goldeneye and all that. 
---
I got Borderlands 2 and played iwth some friends and felt like I was just catching up following them the whole time without knowing what I was doing. I got a new gun every quest and couldn't keep track and it didn't seem worth it to pay attention because I'd replace it in a minute anyway. 
---
That was the first time I felt old playing video games and now I just sorta stay away from Shooters. They're too fast paced and I can't focus my attention on anything long enough to feel confident in what I'm doing. 
---
Very excited to slowly pick flowers in WoW for 10 hours to level herbalism lmao
---
I really hope Omar browses this subreddit, I'd love it if he noticed how much we appreciate him (and everyone else working to make classic a reality of course)
---
Do you think Omar knows about these memes ?
---
real world work friends got me to play vanilla
---
they were super salty when i joined a raiding guild and got a bunch of epics from mc
---
different people lioe different things i dont think they ever raided much and they loved the game
---
That's cool, I'll play it. Just stating my opinion and what I think, there's a flipside to both, there isn't a right answer in my opinion. I was just stating my personal preference.
---
Why does the classic beta run an "event" like that better than retail? I attacked boralus in BfA and defended the great seal and both times it laaged like hell, you could maybe cast 2 spells in 10 seconds because of the lag.
---
How are they limiting them? Didnt catch this news.
---
Thank god I'm not alone. I'm losing it over here...
---
Server reputation is important (meaning don’t be an asshole) but I think you are thinking of faction reputation - throughout WoW there are different factions that your character earns reputation with by doing quests for them. This rep opens up new opportunities in the game.
---
It's also possible that everyone they invite specifically for the stress test loses their access after the stress test.
---
Trivial addons etc. Addons that change how your UI looks (with the exception of threat meters and damage meters).
---
Exactly! A problem people saying is gonna happen is that classic is gonna go stale and people quit and classic is left to die but if you take what makes classic feel good and learn from the mistakes of the other expansion and make new lore it could be amazing.
---
From what Ive gathered, beta invites have been sent out to people this past Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at around 6pm PST. They said theyll be doing a stress test this Wednesday-Thursday, so the hope is that they send out a bunch more invites early this week.
---
I have never played WoW, as I understand I would need a subscription to play classic. Is there going to be a separate subscription just for classic? I am not interested in current wow at all.
---
Well that’s a change then because there is videos of people doing it in actual vanilla on YouTube
---
I posted this only because the GM had information on whether or not it mattered how old your account was in order to be selected for the beta. If that information is correct or not is up for discussion.
---
My **assumption** has always been it has a 5% base crit like everything else in the game, but I must admit I've never attempted to confirm it.
---
Right click in the system tray and exit and then re open it. Or log out and log back in.
---
Amen mate... Let’s hope layering lasts 1-2 weeks *tops* and we can get the launch non-Vanilla shenanigans out of the way fast.
---
lol that sounds like tabloid news, do verify please.
---
Less than jake?
---
Are you saying though that i wouldn't be able to get 60fps out of it?
---
Hot yourself, tank and damage in bear form, when low health bash (it it miss try to root instead (easy if nature grasp talent)  and heal yourself again and bear form again
---
shockadin is pretty dang tanky, you will outsustain anyone
---
heres a video from drakova on it if you want to see how it plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A63bszU6V6I
---
yeah its physical because its patch 1.12
---
Ah man. Killed me with the autistic screeching bit.
---
Warlock pets are situational. 
---
Succy is a CC pet with Charm.
---
Felhunter is your spelllock pet
---
Blueberry is the tank 
---
Imp is DPS and STA boost
---
You’ll need to learn when to use one and summon another. Of course I do believe 1.12 was when pets went “dizzy” when summoning another so if you had CC on that would fall off if you summoned the felhunter.
---
I'm thinking of the first thing you mentioned: Server reputation. I don't want to be known as a guy who is an asshole as you said it. I want to be known as a good guy and not as a bad guy. :D
---
They probably wouldn’t, this is just for fun.
---
For my curiosity what reasoning would you not like that to happen?
---
It turns out that movement speed did *not* affect the animation, see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqdwe6/rogue_stealth_walking_animation/eo3tr4z/).
---
Protection Warrior (Fury with AQ+ gear), Holy Paladin, Markmanship Hunter, Resto Shaman, Combat rogue, Resto Druid, Frost Mage (Fire AQ+), Holy Priest are the raiding specs. Destro Warlock (spam Shadowbolt build), just 1 for the utility.
---
Anything else considered "not valid". There are examples of players who devoted so much to make other spec viable and had some success (like Retri Pala) but not the average Joe.
---
Once PvP rankings are introduced in Phase 2, I’m wondering how those PvP gear rewards compared to BiS PvE gear?
---
If you reach a rank and you’re not yet level 60, do you still get that high level gear, or do you get something else?
---
Because it doesn’t, only demo shout in the actual game
---
A lot of pvp.
---
Thing is, youre asking for changes to classic. You're essentially a cancer on the idea of legacy servers. If you dont want to play classic then please dont, but dont spread your ideas for changes when the entire idea is meant as a time capsule. If its not the same, then its not classic. The backlash would be huge.
---
i really love healing in av but id prob suggest shaman if you like it 
---
fights take forever with paladins 
---
they play pretty different which do you enjoy most
---
Cu chinese ^ ^
---
If we judge by what the masses gonna want, especially in the first few months, we will be playing BFA before November.
---
Hey, not to sound like a dick or anything,  but what is the point of twinking?
---
The most common explanation is that it's mostly popular with bad players who want to take advantage of people who don't understand how to play the game, and I can't seem to come to any other conclusion myself at least when it comes to BGs. Again,  not trying to shit on you guys,  i'm genuinely curious.
---
Yeah but you need at least 95% avoidance+block to begin to push crit out which is likely not the case at low level.
---
stop sucking assmongolds dick, its really sad
---
thanks again for ur reply, i understand. so even in the worst cenario, it would take 200h minimum for an alt to pay it self if i want it just for the money.
---
Now i just need to find out how a healer shaman with eng can make money, and decide what ill main
---
tx =)
---
This. As a warrior we n Vanilla, I always took the tank slot for instances but I had no idea what tanking even was until Armory. Armory! One of my group members raged at me but also taught me the beauty of sunder armor. Changed my life. I love tanking and I’m rolling warrior again. Can’t wait.
---
Not really, no.  The AQ war effort requires an entire guild of man hours to complete and that's only enough resources for one.  There's a 10 hour window where anyone can get it with the resources, but they are such a big number, it usually means that one person from the 2nd guild or the 3rd guild racing will have enough.  I participated in two war efforts in the original and on both servers only 1 person was able to get a mount.  As mentioned, if you are serious about it, your best chance to to lead a server first raiding guild of about 100 people.  and then convince them you are the one to get the mount.
---
Post your requirements in the looking for guild thread or search the guilds there. I have seen more then a few that have the same needs as you.
---
Good job. My comment was before Blizzard made the announcement and decided to milk the Classic community with something unprecedented.
---
Lol, you wanted proof that it was never intended that SoR be the proccing Seal over SotC and there you have it. I discovered Kevin Jordan, the guy responsible for designing them, was streaming, and I asked him.
---
Haha. This is so satisfying.
---
&gt; What should I do to avoid having bad reputation on the server I'm playing on?
---
Just being a ninja, really. I guess not being rude is a plus, but people don't care a whole lot if you just do a good job with your class.
---
&gt; What race would probably be the "best" for tanking? The best class is Warrior and I'm curios if Tauren is a good choice or should I go something else? (I really want to play a Tauren but I'm still interested in your opinions)
---
Sadly, Shaman is the best class, but if you prefer Warrior, any race is fine, really. Tauren is good for Horde, and Night Elf for Alliance because of that dodge. Dwarf Stoneform is nice too.
---
&gt; What is the most needed profession later on in the game so I can help everyone out with their needs?
---
Alchemy/Herbalism and Enchanting.
---
&gt; Are there guides out there how to play the Warrior correctly? Also asking because of Talents and stuff.
---
Probably, but I don't know.
---
&gt; Adding this to my question before: Is there a way to reroll talents or spec so that I have faster/easier leveling with an aggressive spec but can reroll to a tank later on?
---
Yes, you can pay gold to reset your talents, but the gold cost increases each time you wish to reset. The first time is cheap, and then it just becomes more and more expensive.
---
&gt; What is the best gear for a tanking Warrior and how do I obtain it?
---
Raiding, raiding, raiding, raiding. Which is *very* time consuming. Luckily, you tend to have dibs on gear that drops as a Main Tank warrior, Off Tanks tend to get good stuff too, but it's still very time consuming to be a part of a 40 man raid.
---
I really really hope not. It will mess up the community feeling of classic.
---
What's so bad about rerolling on a new server though? People did it all the time.
---
But then there’s the whole weird “Tyrande isn’t the leader” but so it nulls it out.
---
layering is going to take care of the dead server issue so you dont really need to worry about rolling on a server and having it die after launch. and i think theyre only going to do transfers from high pop servers to low pop servers and possibly with a cooldown. dont quote me on that but im pretty sure thats how theyre going to handle transfers, similar to how it was back then
---
Can I switch sides?
---
I think the problem was, like you said, invalidating gear and progress that took years to achieve, effectively resetting the playground. I think they should have left the cap at 60 and introduced expansions as new raid and dungeon content, no new levels gain. Find a way to incentivize players to run old raids and require their completion to progress to new content. Easier said than done, I guess.
---
Bless Omar Godzalez
---
just to put into perspective how old the stuff would be windows didn't have a dedicated server operating system until 2003.
---
This is a rather silly comment. At the time, many MMOs were like this. EQ and EQ2. RO. AO. City of Heroes.
---
My last account activation was December 2018, I decided to try wow out for a month.
---
Big mistake. Retail still sucks. ITS EVEN WORSE
---
Here is a gem from WotLK days, [the Yogscast "how-to" Flame Leviathan guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3lOr2AI5v4) 
---
You can see Simon and Lewis in their early days before they had any inkling they'd be millionaires in a few years.
---
One subscription for both games.
---
I’m very limited on time, but they had transfers in vanilla. I remember doing one.
---
Alliance can kill Thrall in game..
---
yeah im not sure it would make more sense if they just let anyone with a sub and opt in for 2 
---
but its worded like they are just selecting people
---
Are you certain it was the case in 1.12 though ? In BC prepatch it looked like on beta : [https://youtu.be/6BP90t0ehfk?t=16](https://youtu.be/6BP90t0ehfk?t=16)
---
(This is either 1.12 or BC prepatch, but definitely not BC from the looks of his XP bar, capped at his level).
---
Chances are this is what is was looking in 1.12 too.
---
No problem, no offence towards you of course.. ;-)
---
Unfortunately i havent subbed since release of BFA. 
---
I know a friend who never cancelled his sub and never got a beta invite, his account is active since TBC...
---
Nobody wants this. #nochanges
---
Like countless other people have already said, Battle Shout does not generate threat in actual vanilla, that was a private server thing only.
---
Cool, that works. Thanks!
---
scaling in vanilla wow xd.
---
i dont think the mistrust from modern blizzard applies to the classic team. imo theyve gone above and beyond trying to replicate vanilla as closely as possible and seem extremely trustworthy. and its very clear theyre all very passionate about vanilla themselves, especially since several of them were on the original vanilla dev team
---
And they got you. They got you to waste your money on a small sliver of a chance to get into a short beta. Youre not a streamer so youll never get beta access. You now wasted 15, go play BfA or something. And they'll get you again when you have to reactivate before the 13ths name reservation. Blizz milking us and the game isn't even out yet.
---
I’m in the UK and had my account since the last beta before the initial WoW release here. 
---
Was kinda hoping to get in on this beta, but nothing yet. 
---
Looks like waiting until August is the way forward hah!
---
Damn what's up your ass. Not once did myself or the OP once say anything about mmo market only. Mobas are the most streamed game in the asian pacific region and that's exactly what im talking about in my post. Damn dude, you have some IRL issues that you need taken care of...
---
Max graphic settings can be run on a Casio. As far as resolution, if they're playing on a "potato" it would be implied that they are running 1080p. Most gamers never go above 1080p anyway as it's unnecessary and degrades performance. So I think that pretty much establishes why you performance is taking a hit. Play at 1080p an profit.
---
If they are frequently posted on official Blizzard forums, eventually he will. Blizzard staff does read those, and eventually someone will show him these memes.
---
I'm replaying the old star wars game, jedi knight. Only thing that can remotely keep me lol - with wow streams in the bk.
---
Crucible of Storms is probably what he meant. Too bad "just get into boosting raids" is not that easy haha
---
What lower level items are BIS at 60?
---
I dont exactly remember how paly was at 1.12 but i do remember prott was amazing against melee. Atleast in world pvp. 
---
When hammer of wrath was added was the best patch for prottadins
---
Really, you think they are shitting themselves? rofl.
---
Paladin, druid, warlock, hunter, mage if kiting is possible. Maybe shaman too ?
---
The only viable build for paladin in pvp fights that last more than a minute is holy
---
If you like to heal and do damage go shaman
---
If you want the best all around support go Paladin. In both PvE and PvP Paladin is holistically the best healer by a large margin 
---
Hybrid builds are generally terrible. Which is why Paladin &gt; Shaman.  Shaman give up support options for the DPS they can deal. That's just how they ended up designing the game by 1.12
---
edit - Esfand and his shitter friends are terrible, ignore them. The only thing i would suggest you look to esfand for is learning how to duel as ret. Which is a useless skill cuz ret is terrible. 
---
Any idiot could pve perfectly as ret you don't need him for that. 
---
And shockadin does no damage always go with the higher int/stam values. Spell power = heal power from a weight perspective in holy paladin pvp. Although there will be times where the BiS pvp for the patch is covered in spell power (tier 2 BWL)
---
Plus the added bonus of tasting like unwashed ass
---
What I meant to say with that is, that your FPS dropping in certain areas is 99% of the time a dip caused by the CPU and not the GPU.
---
Vanilla was always a toxic place, in general Wows player base was like that too. I love Classic when I am pumped to see Classic coming back. And I hope that this actually helps Blizz make a few changes in the future to retail based on the feedback here too.
---
However, there are some select individuals who feel Classic Wow is the defining crux of their argument against retail wow and modern mmos. It's like they've become this very argument and if It fails, it's going to crumble their very argument.
---
That's why they're acting so aggressively against anyone who makes a suggestion that isn't *classic*, because this is their defining moment. It's their moment to shine and to show the world the truth finally. They don't want anyone ruining the very sanctity of *their* game.
---
These are the people who have demonized anyone who play modern mmos or wow after cata as being "babies." They're the enemy. They need to be on guard for the enemy coming back and putting in stupid, false, deceitful tickets to try and get blizz to dumb down the game again. Why do you think the streamer hate is There? Because they view these people as fake veterans who aren't even testing the game and keep making mistakes on what they think was true vanilla. Why do you think they hate pservers too and have that immense push back towards people who have played on it.
---
Classic is all they have left. There doesn't need to be discussion on how it needs to change. No. If it's not the same exactly as it was, then it's not classic. Even if that's the grasses models. It's not classic and it instantly invalidates the experience for them, because classic is all they have left.
---
Vanilla was an incredibly toxic place. We all were toxic one way or another. Most people grew out of it, but as you can see, many didn't.
---
Yeah I look forward to playing both. Raids in classic are way too easy / focused on logistic difficulty for me to find them enjoyable so I'll scratch that itch on retail.
---
Don't forget that won't work on classic, rep values are much lower.
---
The offtank will hold aggro on any trash that wanders into a boss fight or, in some cases, the main bosses minions, adds.  The reason it was done in fury sometimes is b/c until the adds show up, you are just dps and fury spec was the dps spec back then (it also helped you keep enough rage to snap aggro quickly).  Most of your rage came from getting hit, so you wouldn't have much rage as you dps'd.
---
Hey you say that now but when WOD is 15 years old..
---
"enhance is good"
---
BGs will just be premades wrecking non-premades and Q dodging other premades
---
&gt; Just look at Venruki's video
---
Could you be so kind and link it :) Pretty please :)
---
It's old glory bro. I'm a fat fuck now :(
---
I'm doing the same.. Also because kodo rep.
---
I am bias sure but that’s mostly due to when I had the bulk of my friends playing, therefore the most fun.
---
Is warrior Regen really that bugged?
---
I will agree with that.
---
Why you spy my life ?
---
No that indeed makes no sense. Whats going is they have all the data from back than, but since the old client wouldnt live up to nowadays standard (in many ways) they had to find a way to make the newer client work with the old data, and strip any features off the newer client that werent there in classic. thats where bugs can be born. The various data didnt change, it's how the code may interpret or combine several data wrong, in a way which it didnt do in classic.
---
The beta isnt about checking wrong data (or wrong numbers per se), rather if all the newer code is representing it accordingly. That way will we may still see seemingly wrong numbers, that were processed in a wrong way. Those are the bugs that aim to be found here.
---
Those numbers do not add up at all, the video is also misleading and speeds up at many points, lmao. And the mobs he kills fast in the beginning are green to him so of course it'd be quick. 
---
Compare a warrior questing to Asmon questing and there's a clear difference.
---
Or a keeper, if you also get a girlfriend.
---
oh :( I'm in the same club!
---
Is the Alliance a South Park reference ?
---
Okay this is a fun discussion because at this point it’s all it is.
---
The big issue is you have to be able to make this content with little resources (unless Blizzard completely backs this project) and that’s using TBC (Retail already set this as point of alt timeline) and having to adjust that expansion to fit that timeline.
---
So as simple as it sounds it’s a lot harder than you think.
---
Now the better question is continuing content (TBC/Wrath) while removing features not wanted by players to keep core game challenging, fun and community driven. That’s the real topic of discussion.
---
I will only group with accounts from 2005 and older and at least 1500 classicraider.io score. The rest can pay me for carrying them.
---
(not serious, but need to train this behaviour, just in case ;-) )
---
Good man
---
Yeah, those existed. But they were few and far apart.
---
We'll see, maybe they will implement transfers. If they do I hope they put it on a longer CD.
---
I really appreciate the attention to detail.
---
everyone will be looking for tanks at first b/c leveling a tank spec is very, very slow.  Respec costs were not in the game at first, so you were stuck in your spec.  By patch 1.12, it was just really expensive and no one will have the gold for a bit since we'll all be saving for our mounts.
---
Missing recount and weak auras..yes weak auras is working..they confirmed it on Twitter.
---
This won't be allowed by blizzard but nice job I guess?
---
Then people would say they didn’t keep up with the times if they didn’t have LFG
---
You think you do but you don’t.
---
I just know everyones going to beg for this and then bail when they realize what it really is after a year or so. The 2004 concept of it isnt made for most of these people to enjoy in 2019 lol It's going to be towards private server population in about a year, hence why OSRS has to keep adding content, and why its the 2nd biggest mmo out right now. :)
---
there are like 3 viable pets at end game just look those up i forget there names .....wait let me rephrase not viable all are viable there are like 3 pets you will use at endgame :)
---
They sais they're considering server transfer with an ingame shop at somepoint. but it won't be until 6 months - 1 year after launch.
---
Awesome, that works for me! Thank you.
---
OK
---
I realize this, that's why I said gatherer alt.
---
"Progressive"? Who the fuck says it has to be progressive? I won't delete my post, delete your account.
---
Wait, how's that?
---
That's not how layering works...
---
No, Naxx wasnt available on Nost. But why wouldnt that be impossible? Every raid I was in had at least 2 druids, preferably 3-4.
---
Josheb is doing undead priest.
---
HAHAH DAE NOT LIKE TYHIS STREAMER EL OH L
---
This is amazing. I really have nothing else to say.
---
That's not what I asked about. Also, the crit chance of specific pets is not really available info either, which is why I made this thread.
---
What did the GM say?
---
Support WoW classic. Its success will almost certainly lead to TBC classic that solves a lot of people issues and provides them a home.
---
Sounds great! Thanks so much for responding. :)
---
wont work prices are pretty much set in stone...they have been roughly the same price for 15 years between vanilla 2004-2006 the biggest changing factor would be server population i dont think the plan you outlined above would make much of a difference not being a "gatekeeper" as ive seen other being called for similar opinions just giving out my opinion
---
I have decided on Female. But I am still trying to decide troll or tauren. I will not play orc due to casting and swing animations
---
2 druids compared to like 5-6 priests is still low though
---
Ion obsessively reads the wow Reddits apparently, so he could pass them along at least.
---
You could do this with the old macro system too, however you had to press the button twice. From TBC on, you only had to press the button once.
---
It really depends on how this is implemented. If you have to press the button twice, then it's consistent with classic and not a bug.
---
Omar Gonthrallez
---
Yep. I worked at Microsoft at the time and would go on to help ship Windows Server 2003r2 or something, as well as Windows Vista. (I know, I know.) I'm well aware. 
---
But we at least had tape backups then, and several different forms of source control even if they weren't git. We had perforce (and Microsoft's version of it) as well as svn and a bunch of others I've forgotten about. :P
---
While higher rank gear is mostly exclusive to level 60, alot of the lower rank gear is also gated to lower levels.
---
early on raid for the wep's so u do big dmg once AV and everything comes out you wont have to worry about raiding much untill AQ40 drops if i remember right your going to want certian weps out of the raids to maximize damage but its not "needed"
---
Do no worry about it. Just pretend your Scottish. Aye?
---
Which ones are worth buying?  I found a second edition atlas already. 
---
I read the strategy guide is pretty useless unless your brand new to wow. 
---
How's the dungeon companion?
---
Generally both are equal in terms of usefulness. Hunters are less dmg but are needed for their utility and tranq shot. Warlocks is a dmg powerhouse like warriors once they get gear. They also have great utility, but a lot of that shit is relegated to the hunters.
---
Rotation wise, Hunter is much harder than Warlock at the higher ends. You're relegated to dpsing within all of your auto shots so you do not clip any of them. Clipping auto shots is a loss on dps.  However you don't do much dmg. You'll be out dpsed.
---
As a warlock However, your best spec is simply sac succ and spam shadow bolt. Your utility comes in the play too, but by getting out your pet you lose any benefit from the sac and so make your very spec pointless. But you do super damage later on.
---
You'll see 2/3 Hunters in a raid of 40, roughly. But you'll see double that easily.
---
Fucking everyone.
---
The highest video settings from the 2004 release are still quite beautiful.   The "animated" look of everything has stood up well over time.
---
If I recall correctly this was a change they made to the code at some point to prevent players from being stunned in mid air and floating after the effect expires. I remember around cata lots of bosses started getting knock up+stuns and they changed how the physics engine handles cc to prevent bug abuse.
---
Well, maybe in 1-1,5 months they increase the beta level cap, then there's a resurgence, and one more on release.
---
I dunno, I agree with you on 3 months being too long, but if there's something blizz is pretty good at it's marketing.
---
I don't care too much though, I kinda wish I got a beta invite myself (not really watching streamers) but I kinda don't want to burn out before the game is even out either. I played 1-60 fairly recently too so even if that experience wasn't 100% the same, it's close enough to make me wary of burnout.
---
¯//\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I think it was a rogue in 8-12 days played
---
CRZ was a response to a very real problem, which is that adding expansions to an MMO in the way they've done is flawed and unsustainable.
---
You simply can't keep diluting the population like that. The initial world was not designed with expansions in mind.
---
There needs to be a totally new paradigm for adding content to an MMO that does not include diluting the population over larger land masses and longer leveling periods.
---
https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo
---
Thanks alot for your answer! Could you maybe elaborate on what "Ninja" means? Also why is Shaman the best tank?
---
That's not true, they do, that's why +5 Gun/Bow skill racials are a big deal for PvE, because they grant +3% hit for a 3 level higher opponent (boss standard level is 63 in raids), even though they have close to no effect on same level mobs.
---
&gt; Racial bonuses provided +Weapon Skill, and thus turned out to be pretty valuable for improving your +hit capability. For Humans, Dwarves, Orcs and Trolls their racial bonuses increased their Weapon Skill at Level 60 from 300 to 305. With a 305 Weapon Skill, your base miss rate against a Level 63 mob (or skull boss) was only 6% instead of 9%.

I never bid on items unless if they are super cheap. Waiting for the auction to end and having to rebid on others is fucking annoying, so I just annoy those auctions unless as I said they are super cheap.
---
We won't be in 12 weeks! :)
---
As a fellow healer main. /Hug I know your pain. They'll never say thank you but they'll open their mouth to bitch at the simplest thing that they could have prolly avoided themselves.
---
Wait are you saying you got in without having an active retail sub?
---
Nice mage Icon :)
---
Care to explain how?
---
guilds sell runs with reserved items that you pay for with gold.  or they reserve them for themselves and just let you go on the raid for leftovers.
---
8.2 is the ptr... Public test realm. It's not a closed beta.
---
You're fine.
---
“GIVE ME 25 SILVER!”
---
“Im not leaving this tower, until every one of these goblin cakes is in my mouth!”
---
Also, if you would, could you recommend a CPU? Thank you
---
Everyone can play 8.2 PTR...
---
Same. I started playing modern WoW last summer and someone randomly gave me 20,000 gold on my first day playing. It was cool at first but it kinda ruined it for me.
---
A warrior went absolutely berserk on me here a while back for saying I, as a shaman running SM Armory, would roll need on that shoulder.
---
Apparently, because I would not be able to equip it before 40, it was not a "need" item for me, and I was a ninja. 
---
Never mind the fact it stays BiS for fucking ever.    
---
Never mind that warriors get better plate shoulders right after.   
---
No sir, that shoulder was clearly warrior loot only and I am pretty much the worst person in history.
---
Ironically, I grabbed both the Ravager and Herod's Shoulders on my first character way back when. An enhancement shaman.   
---
This time I'll be going with Elemental though. Probably. Maybe.
---
Yeah I can tell just by reading the subreddit since Classic was announced. It’s now clear than ever. They’re worried Classic will overtake retail in popularity, and they probably should be. The negativity about Classic is hilarious coming from the same people who’ve invested their entire lives into WoW, so much so that they can’t quit even if retail was the worst game on the market.
---
Yeah that's not true dude
---
We had a dude like that in vanilla, cannot for the life of me remember his name.  On laughing skull, which was PvP, a couple guildies saved this farmer from a gank.  From then on whenever he was getting ganked he would whisper someone in the guild, and we would go and kill/corpse camp anyone who fucked with him.  He would give potions and scrolls and stuff to the folks that showed up.  Also whenever he got a nice world drop, he would message us first and generally take a little less than AH. Was a good arrangement and gave us something to do on non raid days.
---
Imagine being so little brained you can't understand he puts on a character to entertain a stream.
---
She was in warcraft 3.
---
I thought it sounded pretty familiar, thanks.
---
Agree with what you say about the game turning into a loot fest and the social aspect, but I really do not run into many people saying shit about classic tbh. I genuinely don't understand it. This sub constantly bangs on how retail players want clasic to fail and whatever, but from my own experience 99% of responses towards classic from retail players are either positive or that they don't care. I guess if you actively look for theses sort of people for validation that you can hate on retail even more or if you act like a dick towards retail players you will get hostile responses, but why would anyone do it?
---
&gt; Game is so easy now.
---
Retail WoW, for years, offers far more difficult contant than anything classic had to offer
---
Oh, gawd, I had forgotten about Brokentooth.  I spent DAYS trying to get him.  The memories!
---
Modern wow is nostalgia. It gets a sub bump when an expansion comes out. Then it drops when they realize its nostalgia for how was, then leave.
---
Anyone can get into the 8.2 PTR. It does not affect Classic beta (or any other closed betas).
---
I think I'd rather just see an interview. Reddit would ask him a bunch of dumb pseudo technical questions
---
Is "The Rake" in it ? The tiger from Mulgore added in 1.11 ? Can't seem to find it
---
Yes, id agree with that
---
Feral tanking is very viable for everything besides 40 man raids and even then there are some encounters where bears have an edge over warriors due to their larger healthpool and the abiliy to simply shift out of cc. For 5/10 mans they are preferred over warriors because they bring motw and battle rez. They are also very straightforward to play.
---
You record it yourself, and you have the World first until someone happens to have an earlier recording.
---
any dps is viable for the dungeons.  Don't underestimate Tranq Shot, though.  Also, Hunters were the best pullers in raids.  So there is always a spot for them.
---
That just means there’s gonna be one huge fucking queue lol.
---
Whoah there, I’m 24 and played classic wow... I’m looking forward to it
---
morals aside posting anywhere that you broke Terms of Service is probably a bad idea
---
the specific info in your question im not sure about but here is a link to basically everything we know about hunter pets  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-hunter-pets](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-hunter-pets)
---
This is completely false as every server has a different pricing structure.
---
Shockadin. Requires a lot of gear.
---
Maybe a mount?
---
Oof. Ya I know it gives threat on lightbringer
---
I played the demo and felt exactly the same.i was lpcked1 to the barrens, and could have lived there forever. When we hit the last few minutes, everyone said goodbye abd that they couldn't estoy to see us all again at release. We'd built a community in that time. This is truly what it's about.
---
As a 24 year old 30 year old boomer, I take offense to that!
---
We're talking specifically about a paladin here. That means he's either ret, holy or prot by definition, yes?
---
So if he's holy, it's bad because it has no stats.
---
If he's holy it has no stats that fits with healing so he shouldn't be rolling on it.
---
If he's ret he needs a twohander so he shouldn't be rolling on it.
---
If he's prot, well he shouldn't be prot, so he shouldn't be rolling on it.
---
So yeah.
---
Thanks! I'm super hyped!
---
I think he might mean that because of layering they won’t need to launch with too many servers.
---
Soo?
---
These keep getting better and soon it will just be an image of the log-in screen and we won't know how to react
---
"Esfand and his shitter friends are terrible" lmao
---
Druids going Feral at 60 got Wolfshead Helm (lvl 40 items) as BiS, as well as Manual Crowd Pummeler (lvl 24) from Gnomeregan as BiS.
---
Heart of Noxxion (lvl 46) is BiS Nature Resistance trinket for and up to Ahn'Qiraj.
---
The list goes on, etc.
---
I wish you a pleasant evening and have fun Roguée.
---
How does rerolling on a different server mess with the community any less than server transfering?
---
This is amazing, thank you &lt;3
---
I didn’t even consider that EU maybe isn’t even being included in the first waves.. Those people who gave gotten in touch with helpful GMs should probably touch them up some more to get an answer..
---
No invite here either, EU, account has been active since vanilla launchday.
---
Exactly. The things you listed may be seen as negative to some, but there's very little hand holding in the game and everyone becomes a better player as a result and makes the game way more rewarding.
---
based off of supply and demand which changes based off population.....
---
If so that would only generate a visual, clientside bug. The numbers are always calculated on the backend to prevent cheating. All the client does is display art and information from the backend. I'm still confused how the damage numbers can be wrong (unless only visual)
---
I was expecting a video of you holding the A key lol
---
Now the real question is... What is McChicken sauce?
---
I'd say it's a combination of LFG and CRZ.
---
LFG, by itself, isn't a terrible idea.
---
The problem is it was combined with other servers.
---
If it pulled people from your server, you'd still have a sense of community, because there would be a lot of familiar faces and you'd interact with them more because you know they're around.
---
But with LFG pulling from other servers, you have absolutely no reason to give a shit. Add that to CRZ infesting every other major part of the game, and the community dies off.
---
First or secind edition?
---
this is basically what i was looking for, so does the build the dude linked below cover holy pally well? or would u move some stuff around 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVtuMgotVG0cZVb

Yeah it has to do with the Fiscal Year calendar I believe. Everything’s about money.

I just cant imagine french people getting in :(
---
27th of August seems just so far away!
---
No, not at all.   
---
In PvP they have a lot of versatility. They are difficult to play but if you are a master of the class you're among the best pvp classes.   
---
In PvE, bears are not viable end game tanks, and oomkins are MAYBE one per raid, but healers will always have a spot.
---
&gt; I will make 2 characters, 1 for leveling, the other I will run all the way at lv 1 to the major city, he will be the main Auction House guy.
---
Level it to 5 and get enchanting so you can disenchant all the shit greens you find.
---
Swiftthistle comes from "tier2" herb nodes. Just level a druid to 21 (for 30% speed talent) and farm them yourself. Westfall, lakeshire, Dun Morogh are good places (since it drops from Mageroyal and briarthorn). No need to pick herbalism on main just for swiftthistle...
---
But quivers dont work if you use ammo that isnt in that pouch.
---
Whelp, this has reignited the PVP vs PVE server debate in my head
---
Thank God for Sekiro or I'd be right there with you friend
---
Yeah, this.  It was an extremely short window.  They were basically just placeholders for a couple of weeks until the art was finished.
---
Can enhancement shaman tank?
---
As far as I know, all you need is an active 15$ sub to play Classic.  You don't need to buy BFA, and nowadays there is no Battle Chest or buying old expansions.  When you sub for 15$, I believe you get everything up through Legion, but to access BFA, you have to buy BFA.  To access Classic, you just need the 15$ sub.
---
If you're not planning on playing bfa, all you need is a free account and the sub.
---
According to WoWHead it was Xenif, a troll rogue. Hit 60 on December 3, so 10 days but I’m not sure what it was in game time.
---
Lmao I think back and I was like 13 when I first started playing and I was really bad at the game.
---
What's really funny is I don't remember having such a difficult time leveling a warrior. But here I am getting my ass kicked if I pull more than one mob at a time.
---
There's an EU beta?
---
That was a really really bizarre comparison.
---
Everyday
---
and based of the average player on the server.
---
a server filled with "tryhard" pvp'ers will have much higher prices on anything related to grenades.
---
Yes I did lol
---
nope, the subscription alone gets you everything up to BFA, and includes WoW Classic, no additional purchases required
---
Does exp come faster later on though?
---
I only remember that the first Horde character on Arthas to hit 60 was an orc hunter named Goo. I’m sure his strategy was to just do what hunters do. 
---
I think it took much more than a week though.
---
Honestly, I can't wait to start merchanting items again.
---
It will honestly feel like my time doing material routes aren't wasted as my copper/bronze monoply will have a reason to exist.
---
Anything post Cata ruined professions by streamlining the whole process into braindead easy collection.
---
Anyway, Come down to BigAxe's bronze imporium, we sell bronze and bronze items at you convience. Worry no longer about your jewelcrafting needs, because we sell copper too!
---
Not effectively. They don’t get any armor bonuses and they use mail.
---
Well first off, actually the current retail 19 twink champions is a group combined of several R1 Players, point of twinking is for purpose of fun balanced PvP it doesn't hurt to have another character that is a twink to play some BG's once in a while. In current retail too you only get qued vs players with XP Off so you only get paired vs other twinks. 
---
Now sure this won't be the case in classic but there will be multiple guilds im sure and a big twink scene that the battlegrounds after first two months should be balanced battlegrounds with majority of twinks.
---
plus who doesn't love a game of capture the flag
---
Nothing, all she'll have to do is set up a subscription.
---
Yeah I think I was sort of brainwashed by the narrative that the talent trees gave you an illusion of choice. But you can do a good amount with them. They are really fun to progress through while you're leveling.
---
I hope these streamers overtly pick one server so I can avoid it. Everyone's talking about client side changes but I am fearful of how cancerous streamers and more importantly the followers are going to be.
---
This is amazing. And sad too....I heard so many stories how people exploit young kids in China working them for little to no money, working them hard because "Hey you're just playing the game, it's fun isn't it? You also get paid, so it's all good, right?"  
---
There's a sci-fi book called "For The Win" by Cory Doctorow. You can read the electronic format for free from Cory Doctorow's official site. Your story reminded me of the guy who was chatting with a Chinese gold farmer, but he actually got in on the operation, helping the farmers out and being good buddies with them, which was a cool little thing. You might enjoy that book....
---
Oh different part of the thread, I see.
---
I also payed for the Blizzcon ticket, and I never bought one before and I will pay for the name reservation.
---
People payed Blizzard over all these years to arrive at the state the game is currently at. I show interest and pay if Blizzard gives me the game I want. I voted with my wallet back then, when I canceled my subscription and I'm voting now and reactivated my subscription get classic WoW back.
---
You must obtain a certain player level to train the next rank:
---
Apprentice - Level 5 for Production/Fishing and no req for Gathering
---
Journeyman - Level 10 for Production/Fishing and no req for Gathering
---
Expert - Level 20 for Production, Level 10 for Gathering and Fishing
---
Artisan - Level 35 for Production, Level 25 for Gathering, Level 10 for Fishing
---
Gearscore that works off ilvl wouldn't really work like other expansions. There is a good chance you will still have blue items in aq40, like the healing robes from Baron etc. Remember, transmog isn't a thing so one quick visual look at somebody and you will know what they have going on.
---
Well yes now I realize only speaking about the client wasnt a really good example. As you said, theres also lots of serverside coding, which probably also had to be teached to interact with the old data. Just slapping the old serversided code on newer hardware wouldn't have been enough
---
Not really related to classic wow but does anyone else think if I made and undead rouge and called it Unclebenjen it would be a good plan?
---
Best time. It’s where we all started
---
I used a token myself (had enough gold on my inactive account) to try and get in and I am sending you best wishes to get into the beta as well!
---
There simply isn't a tank that can dps.  Roles were much, much more specialized back then.  Even the lowest dps spec would still do more dps than any tank.
---
Haha this is too damm accurate for me at the moment. The waiting is already killing me
---
Fishing, herbing, mining, selling your "services", crafting, auctioning are all things you can do to make money regardless of spec.
---
I mean there were definitely busy PvE servers. Stormrage had queues a lot, for example. I do remember see a poll though somewhere and people preferred PvP to PvE like 5:1. That was true for RP servers too if RPPvP was an option.
---
thanks for the tipp. 
---
but i have to be honest: if i had free time, id play wow classic :P
---
jk. ill check that book out. bookmarked
---
I have faith
---
Hi, /u/benvies
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
That’s how I took it and hope that is indeed the case!
---
The game starts when you click "play"
---
It is possible to take the content of the expansions and not bring over the “quality of life” changes that went with it.
---
Lol that is a ridiculous example and you know it
---
My body is ready
---
i literally said nothing about how layering works, how did this response come to your head?
---
Could have just timed his energy regain and do ambush into backstab
---
Streamers can’t test games though.
---
In terms of druid you have so many choices of specs that are viable for so many things it's great. And within those specs there are slight variations you can tailor to your liking.
---
i dont even own this expansion and i have access to the ptr
---
auto loot
---
AFAIK the atlas was out when the game came out, so wouldn't have 1.11 stuff.
---
Should we tell him, guys?
---
Others have answered correctly but here it's also straight from Blizzard:
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
See: "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?"
---
My guild never stepped foot in Naxx.  I think we only got till like half-way into AQ40 when TBC launched.  Will be looking forward to finishing AQ40 and doing Naxx 40.
---
I started in mid bc, but didn't get my pvp mage up and running into the end. I was fortunate to see a group do this one time. Seething got summoned, things went nuts, it was amazing. I'm so sad over what AV is today.
---
I didn't get hardcore into raiding until the end of Vanilla, so TBC was my prime time as far as raiding was concerned, and I really hated that attitude when 3.0 was announced (but before it was released), because everyone knew that every boss in Sunwell was going to lose 30% of their HP, and all the classes were getting some overtuned (for level 70) skills, thus making the raids easier.
---
We were stuck on M'uru, and killed him a week before the 3.0 announcement, and it *instantly* killed about 3/4 of my guilds active raiders will to bother trying to down KJ before the patch.  I wanted to double down and try even harder, because why bother being in a progression guild if you aren't going to attempt to get that last boss before it got nerfed?
---
I really hope that they don't decide to add post Naxx content that invalidates Naxx in Classic.  Go ahead and add new content, but make it sidegrade/same ilvl gear as Naxx.  I don't want people to just give up on trying to progress in Naxx just because they know in 3 months there will be easier/similar difficulty content rewarding better gear.

Dabei wären doch gerade die Screens interessant! Nackedei Fotos von dir und der heißen Trolldame im Gasthaus? :p
---
because transferring your characters will just suddenly add another character to one server while removing them from the other. if you level a new character youre not just suddenly spawning a new, assumingly max level character on a random server, and youre still on your old server as well
---
What's a 30 yo Boomer asked the boomer
---
No problem Vonkilington. I wish you a pleasant evening and have fun.
---
nah, let him dream.
---
You have to remember that the horde is pretty new at this point - they are just establishing political systems, money systems, and everything else. The Alliance races have a long history of strong kingdoms with presumably lots of resources. They have strong military and political systems and governance.
---
Maybe it was patched later but my vanilla guild 100% had our warriors stand in a line and battleshout then cancelaura it off to tank nef adds in phase 1. Never played a private server.
---
We had one in our guild too. He was never late and never missed raid days
---
Shroud has been playing Horde. He could bring balance to the Force.
---
Eher so Dinge wie Zugangsdaten (zu Foren, Accounts, ...). Ich hab meist die Dinge administiert, die es zu administrieren galt. 
---
Und ja, sicherlich auch das ein oder andere nackte Trollmädchen ;-)
---
Esfand
---
When was it patched out?
---
Sharding is so shit I don't even know where to begin.
---
Get off my head.
---
I haven't experienced this problem. Even with full DoTs on my target I am still able to reliably get a Soul Shard every time. Maybe the players reporting this issue were not pulling back their pet first?
---
Blizzard already stated they'll change classic api to prevent lfr addons and others that break the classic spirit from existing
---
warrior tank is always going to get you in a group and a raid if you're good. Rogues are going to be growing from trees and you're going to be in competition from druids, hunters, shamans and pretty much every other dps that can wear leather. If you can do the tedious levelling to about 40 with a warrior I'm sure you won't regret it.
---
He lacks information PepeLaugh
---
Yes C2C, this is what I'm looking to know. Maybe I should ask on the WoW sub instead.
---
The only real thing players in current say about Classic is “that’s cool, I’ll probably play it for a bit. But I’m committed to playing current, so I’ll just tinker in classic at most.”  That’s about it. No shit talking classic or those that want it.
---
As for content difficulty, classic offers a more challenging leveling experience and a longer journey to getting to end game for sure. But complexity isn’t remotely on the level of raiding and pvp available on retail. Not a knock on Classic (I loved vanilla and plan to play it extensively), it’s just true.
---
Haha, Shaman is not a tank at all. Was just being silly with "Shaman is the best class!" Shaman is mainly a healer class, with great support. If you are a Warrior, you will *love* a Shaman support buddy, because of a spell they have called Windfury Totem.
---
Otherwise, Warrior is the best tank, yes.
---
Ninja also means that you grab item drops from bosses (when in a group with others) for yourself when the item is not really good for your class. You basically press 'Need' on an item which is not for you, and then you leave the group and the instance, that's a Ninja.
---
It's pretty clear he and McConnel play characters on their stream. Asmongold has said people tune into Overwatch for the drama, and he's not wrong.
---
They know a little spice and drama is going to bring a crowd, so why not?
---
Oh thank god
---
It truly is a point we have to make sure we let blizzard know, once it’s time. 
---
Guess in a year or two.
---
You can switch to a different guild to change layers. That's at least one way of doing it.
---
Im rolling paladin healer
---
Yes, and if you are on a pvp server, it's wise to all move as one unit or you'll spend another hour trying to get from the flightpath to the dungeon.  And god have mercy on your soul if if it Thorium Point.
---
Request stop at next flight point
---
Intended
---
Thanks, everyone was so helpful!
---
Saw on a stream that a tick from a DoT broke cannibalize.  Has that always been the case?  Can't recall.
---
no you only haved one wow account
---
Didn't even see the pup at first. Made it even better. Omar is the new lord of our reddit. All roads lead to Omar.
---
Druids are pretty good off tanks as well.
---
Wasn't disagreeing with the strategy, just that the guy above is butthurt about an actor.
---
Dog she doesn't want you to fucking unravel her brain just give some tips then stop.
---
love u omar bb
---
Just wanted to come and say hi from the opposing faction. So hi :) Lentus&lt;Banished&gt;
---
Gorgonnash, EU. I always tried to avoid you :)
---
One of my best friends in WoW was a gold farmer from Korea, nicest kid ever dude. We both like 10 at the time, as this was 2005, but he spoke english and we'd whisper each other all the time, and sometimes in between his farming runs we'd run dungeon content together. He even raided with me once, super nice guy. We spoke on and off until a couple years ago, he kinda disappeared and I think about him all the time.
---
In 5 mans while leveling if you have the right group you can. At 55+ not really. 
---
But if you are trying to tank a dungeon you basically just need to play it smart and the group can't go on auto pilot. Enhancement has no agroo skills as far as I remember so you either need to do 2 CC's per pull or use an offtank like a Voidwalker, Hunter Pet, or physical dps class (like another enhancement shaman lol). 
---
I never played one but I remember doing dungeons with them but only as a last resort when we just couldn't find someone who wanted to tank and we were confident in our group so the enhancement shaman agreed to tank. If you WANT to tank, I don't think enhancement shaman is the class at all to take.
---
If only you were as good of a YouTuber as this guy. This guy suffers for his art.
---
&gt; BG or arena related.
---
And to be more specific - he was only smart with pocket healer on his back and gear advantage.
---
Some people need to replicate this and check the combat log and see what went wrong exactly.

Pretty sure inanimate objects that function for turning in quests shouldn't be shown on the minimap. Only NPCs with the yellow **?** sign above the head should be shown as a dot on the minimap.

On the video, Asmongold is on *Lifting the Curse* quest. He is looting the *Intrepid Strongbox Key* and a yellow dot shows on the minimap.
---
But isnt the drop down where classic is?

Also, you understand the a single private server shutdown resulted in a 250,000 signature petition and set this whole thing in motion, do you not? So yes, private server population would be amazing.

Thanks alot for the clarification. Also got me good with the Shaman haha :D
---
Alchemy/Herbalism/Enchanting. Why are these professions the best to take for the game later on? Enchanting probably for some good end gear and the other ones for potions and stuff? I'm more of a noob if you can't tell. \^^
---
There are world bosses though, that only spawn once every few days and can only be tagged by one group/raid.  There will only be one of these raid bosses per server and are extremely sought after. This is where you hear talk about competing guilds, whether it is two raids on opposite factions, or multiple raids on the same faction
---
tihihihi :F
---
Thank you
---
I guess they batch the emails, so time between being granted access and getting the email might vary
---
Going by your description from what you want from your class, it's priest or paladin. So look into them and see which one you like the most.
---
this is true
---
Supposed to do 15 months but I guess that works
---
Whining about a streamer is really sad...and this has nothing to do with him it's about damage numbers and it just happens that he fought mobs that seem to have wrong numbers and we have it on video.
---
All three of those things are so classic
---
link us the Grand Marshall title =)
---
I am EU :( Sad because you sound like the kind of person I would love to play wow classic with.
---
Good luck in Azeroth !
---
What are you pointing out? That quests give more xp at higher level? You also need hundreds more to level....
---
I didn't even notice it at first and I'm now I'm the guy holding back tears in the lunch room
---
I don't really see how it would be a good idea (for Blizzard) or how beta testers would be granted access to it.
---
The client is internal and doesn't work on battle.net or on their infrastructure. There's a chance it isn't even on a server network, but rather the client, data and assets are locally stored.
---
So possibly the only option would be to send the client and all assets to the beta testers. Poof, they've given the original 1.12 wow to public and they practically don't own it anymore. Anyone who acquires these can now setup a 100% accurate 1.12 pserver. 
---
In the case data and assets are on a blizz server and they manage to circumvent their infrastructure problems, they still have vulnerabilities that could possibly open floodgates for malicious attacks on their network.
---
There's been a lot of meta shift pertaining to warrior dps. Some of it will be reverted due to world buff cooldown changes but honestly warrior dps will have a core spot in raids.
---
Classic WoW is like a blowjob.  They never go out of style and your first time is always memorable.
---
I honestly doubt it since there’s an initial paywall unlike OSRS where F2P is an option.
---
The 15th Anniversary Edition is likely the closest we'll get to an actual Collector's Edition, as there isn't a product to sell. You need to own World of Warcraft, which is already released, and buy game time. That's all.
---
I was 10 when i started playing in 2006
---
But wait, where are the totally necessary world buffs!?
---
erstaunlich viele brudis hier. wir gehen heim.
---
I’m rolling hunter, and I will tell you I’m rolling hardcore on all that sweet sweet agility gear (also in classic hunters only use leather till 40)
---
Best thing I've seen all week.
---
Just play some cool indie games to tide you over. Celeste, Hollow Knight, The Messenger, Cuphead, Spelunky, Stardew Valley, Forager. Get out of your comfort zone for a bit.
---
You gotta get your unarmed up
---
You can't use Roots nor Nature Grasp indoors though, including in dungeons. And surviving through an elite in Bear Form at that level seems wrong tbh. When you have some decent Feral talent points maybe. Then again maybe I'm wrong because of the PServers I've got used to in the last years. I sure as hell had to finish the giant tidewalkers desolace elite with roots + Moonfire dots last time I soloed one for quests, because I was getting crushed in Bear form wayyy too fast.
---
Wasn’t auto loot in vanilla?
---
Im subbed on my 2005/2006 account but i have an account under same battleid that is from 2004. Does it matter with beta waves? Or shall i sub on my 04 acc to
---
Guild/name plz?! :)
---
I’d say now it’s the best time to either to some productive stuff, like online courses and shit on Udemy that’ll help you IRL, or catch up with TV shows like on Netflix in the meantime.
---
Because once August 27 hits real life is over boys.
---
Once one accepts that they have no chance at being a Scarab Lord they'll be okay with rolling on a streamer server. It's the actual realm balance that will have an impact on the other 98% of players be it through the auction house, progression or world events.
---
I'd love to roll on a high profile streaming realm but not if it's significantly tilted one way or the other since that could have a tangible impact on me, the average player.
---
Were the AH not connected in vanilla?
---
Pet as well I think it’s called the spirit of competition.
---
What’s the best human leveling zone progression?
---
TYRANDE HAS NO IDEA HOW TO LEAD OUR PEOPLE
---
Everything considered an exploit will probably not be in. But 'bugs' Might.
---
Is this from beta ? Cuz tailoring was the only exeption in this back in 2005. Thats why im asking, if the recreated it 100% ir the fixed it, where tailoring now DOES have the lvl requirements for 150+ and 225+. It didnt back in 2005, thats why i asked.
---
Are you serious?
---
you get a soul shard regardless of who kills it, we're talking about the improved drain soul talent that gives mana back
---
if they had to they could leave in the option to switch between new and old npc and player models
---
Oh ya i’m not old either don’t worry we’re still spring chickens lol! I hope you land an invite to it soon.
---
They'd probably tell ya to come here since there hasn't been a need for a macro like this in a long while. But before or shortly after release a set of macros should he floating around along with a new classic version of the Narcosis addon.
---
Another possible place to check is the Warlock Discord they may have setup classic channels already
---
That petition went viral like crazy. The playerbase wasn't 250k, I had never even heard of it yet I saw the petition everywhere. If you look at the current classic pserver playerbase its about 10k on at once and thats bc of the countdown to Classic.
---
Raids have off tanks for most encounters and trash pulls correct? If a feral Druid isn't often the #1 option for the main tank is there usually a spot as an offtank that raids like to use a druid for or would they simply prefer every tank and off tank to be a warrior in most cases? 
---
I'm just wondering because a lot of times the tanking conversation seems to focus around main tanking raids but versatility seems to be important too with 40 players so it would make sense to me that raids would still like a druid tank for their versatility maybe
---
Never noticed how massive the kids feet are.
---
Layering is not going to 'take care' of the issue of a dead server, because that's not how layering works. There are tons of pictures out there which actually shows how layering works.
---
Alternatively, you can get the audiobook and listen to it while playing. That's what I did for a long time playing WoW and farming stuff. Just listening to audiobooks. :3

I'm 21, and I started playing the game in 2004 (first grade) with a little help from my Dad. I didnt end up getting to max level until BC or anything, but i look forward to playing the game I loved again!
---
as you can see from the 2min remaining on the 120min flask, it took us more then 1 try that evening. 
---
if we had any world buffs, i guess they were gone after wipe #1.
---
side note: we were not smart enough to actually understand the amazing ways world buffs could be used. i checked out a private classic server last summer and boy was i wrong, thinking i knew everything. regarding worldbuffs i learned a lot. (mindcontrol ubrs for fire resistent buff, not turning in onyxia head until raid needed the buff, feralas, ...)
---
you think this is silly but im printing this out and hanging on my monitor till release
---
This was so funny man I’m cracking up!
---
I feel like the god damn men stuck on titanic, " streamers and media first" , "hey you fuck off the boat make room for streamers and media"
---
So beta shows up as '' World of Warcraft®: Legion (WoW1)
---
Public Test Realm
---
Active
---
Account Status'' on your video :S ?
---
I agree with almost everything - cross realm BG's were a great improvement. On my server waiting time for AV was sometimes over 4h in the morning, players leaved dungeons to participate in epic fights. Sometimes it ended immidiately when one side was lacking players. It was funny to sleep for few hours, go back from work and see same battleground going on for over 24h. Longest AV I've ever participated lasted over 60h and joined it 3 or 4 times.
---
After connecting realms in groups it became much better and we still had our fun. When you wanted to PVP, you could just wait reasonable time for invite and enjoy battle ;-)
---
Community is still created by players, I wish you'll be able to find great people in game and enjoy your time once again.
---
And memes.
---
2016. Estimated 1.3 million people playing WoW private servers.
---
You might be right, but I’m pretty sure I can live with this :)
---
No one ever AOE grinded from 20-60. There were pockets of AOE grinding spots that were more efficient (and many times, more fun than the quests at that level, let's not pretend all vanilla zones are amazing) and you'd grind a couple levels, then go back to questing.
---
Would be so dope if his colleagues pranked him with this picture.
---
The link for this is giving a 404...is this still available somewhere?
---
I've had more fun playing on classic and TBC private servers the past few years than any of the last 5 retail expansions.
---
And I gave them all fair chances. What you say is true, theres just too much taken away from the current game.
---
\#NoOneCares
---
Sorry I didn’t realize it was separate just thought you were messing with me lmao (:
---
Did you not see the comment posted three hours before yours where this was asked and answered?
---
What’s the process when you join a raiding guild in vanilla? Is it strict times you gotta show up? Or just be around to catch some of them?
---
60k people watching 1 streamer play a level 30 toon in beta. Its going to be a juggernaut my friend.
---
Hey that was my post! :D Do you actually *use* the Google bar?
---
You say that as a joke but we're all level 0 until August 27
---
&gt;They will, because it's 1.12 talent. Back then the warrior talent tree didn't allow them to dps competitively. The only ok spec was with MS but it would take debuff slots.
---
Buffs actually apply slight threat. It’s not a crazy amount, but a mage casting intellect can pull aggro if no one else has touched a mob.
---

Optimum PvP as solo paladin (you can change it up if you have two+ pala, only one needs kings/improved concentration, other can get imp might and go more aggressive)  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgotVMtMzh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgotVMtMzh)
---
Optimum PvE only build [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx) (this is what you would use if you raided only, allows you to slot into any 40 man for let's say world bosses and give out all buffs but sanctuary)
---
My actual build for most of the expansion is the PvP build. But I lose the 1 point in reduced hammer of justice in the prot tree. And add one point in seal of light
---
One point in seal of light is not optimum for PvP. But indispensible in PvE, especially 5 mans. If you really have to seal of light you can in a 40 man raid too much easier, should generally leave that to some one with the full talent
---
With that one point difference my build becomes viable for PvE as long as one of the other Paladins has imp might.
---
Some guilds take sanctuary as well, there you would just basically drop holy shock and take sanctuary..Too lazy to put that one on the calculator. Good luck

Wait what?

Wow those words are so sophisticated! Surely if you're this much of a genius you can do better than "troglodytic"? Or you could explain how in the hell you chose that term which strikes me as obviously inaccurate?
---
Took me 8 days in 2005 as wl
---
"godlike"
---
remember that on launch there were none of the updated quest hubs that exist in 1.12 so you had to grind out many levels inbetween quests. 10 days /played is probably reasonable
---
Yep, [https://www.wowhead.com/quest=2842/chief-engineer-scooty](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=2842/chief-engineer-scooty)

How can I check that my laptop could be expected to handle running classic without being able to play the beta? 
---
I can run the current game on low graphics but i’ve only tested this as far as level 10 with barely any other player interaction (as you’d expect). I can play vanilla private servers no worries.
---
To be fair, even though I was always pro-vanilla wow and shit on the last 2 retail expansions, private server players made it REALLY easy to make retail players hate the game. This reddit,  hell even some of the posts in this thread are hyper-aggressive. Gate-keeping classic will just scare many people off. I know a lot of people who refuse to watch rick and morty, or listen to twenty one pilots, sole-y because their fanbase is trash and don't want to be associated with it. If private server players continue this aggro gate-keeping, it'll be the same.
---
Hi, /u/Scbking
---
I liked DKP. There were barely any druids in our raid core so we were all sitting on a mountain of it. Competition for loot was pretty low between us so we could spend it on stupid shit like fist weapons or rogue daggers (if nobody wanted them) 
---
Except for our Druid officer. Our Druid officer was an asshole and used to spend DKP on any and every item, even if it wasn’t really an upgrade so they never had any to use. When I smashed their bid for our first Stormrage helm they flipped shit and quit the guild. 
---
DKP was fun
---
Ya Im sorry but there arent no 1.3 million people actively playing. Maybe over the decade and what not but if you look at the classic servers there a dozen or so and the top all have a few thousand people playing at peak times.

Yes, it's from the beta. And we're not playing 2004 or 2005 WoW, we're playing late 2006 WoW.

If he is in def stance it would be modified above the base 25 by the stance alone aswell.

Posts like this make me feel good about myself. Thank you.

Did you just puts Tips and StaySafe in the same bracket as Soda/Asmon? ROFL. Their streams will be dead by time of release.
---
is that also for free on the site you mentioned?
---
I raided mythic Nighthold in Legion and still hate on retail. I actually enjoyed raids they had a lot of mechanics what I think the biggest downfall in Legion was the literal endless grind of Artifact Power and Warforging. People could get a bis trinket from raid finder and have it WF to higher ilvl than mythic. It felt like I was being forced to clear every difficulty every week just in the hopes of getting a WF/TF item.
---
My friend used to have his kid who was 6 grind honor when at work. Pretty much watched him grow up through the game.
---
Now they'll both be back to grinding honor in Classic. Full circle.
---
In retail, anyone can buy the gear now. No requirements anymore.
---
true
---
Do certain races jump higher than others? I was messing around with an undead male and female when I noticed the male could get to certain ledges the female couldn't. What's the verdict?
---
Sweet. WoW classic cap was 2.5k, so it will be perfect.
---
omfg.  that's so good.
---
because he made a big point out of it?
---
&gt; No need to talk either, there's no strategizing like we had in vanilla: "rogue - go sap moon, mage - please sheep star" etc. Again, it feels like a mechanism that discourages communication.
---
Thats simply not true.  You have to communicate that before the run even starts, because, as you said, you don't have time to do it mid run.  That doesn't mean you completely don't strategize because you aren't doing it on the fly, it just got pushed to a different timing.
---
Everything else you said I totally agree with.
---
Thanks for the inspiration! 😄
---
I usually use a Duckduckgo bar, but I've been having some problems with that, which is why I moved to Google for the time being.
---
How do you want results? I'm like half way to level 6 but had to take a break to feed my child.
---
Yes, day/night is active, and weather is definitely enabled.  I haven't seen weather in winter zones, but I have seen impressive rainfalls in the Wetlands and Dustwallow Marsh.
---
1. It's not outdated at all. It's not really comparable to anything
---
2. Nothing, it's free with retail if you have a sub
---
3. The community (on private servers) have been amazing according to me. I've had some amazing times with PS communities
---
4. Yes. Just play the Warcraft 3 Remaster that will be released later this year for lore if you want to.
---
We had some close attempts on sapphiron, and eventually wanted to get a world buff attempt in. Someone told blood legion and they camped waiting for us in epl at north tower buff and killed us all. We ended up killing sapph next attempt with no world buffs.
---
Good call.  Never thought about actually being recruited rather than trying to find one.
---
Ahh McChicken sauce aka mayo.
---
But the layering alone has a cap of 3k ugh #nochanges
---
He will most likely get access the beta is not over yet, but i agree he should of got access in the first wave
---
No the combat will feel very familiar for anyone who is used to tab targeting combat it’s not clunky. 
---
It will only cost 15$ USD subscription, no base game needed. 
---
Who knows. I bet it will not be super elitist. The target demographic is probably more casual (older people with jobs and families). 
---
Yes, nostalgia isn’t driving me to play this game. It’s the RPG elements, the grind, character identity, lack of easy mode stuff such as LFG, better community, server identity, etc.
---
Venezuela is the new China of gold farming, I'd imagine the Venezuelans who get on the WoW Classic train early will be living an alright life (better than a dentist based on my math).
---
you can ambush people with their back to the walls.
---
Back during Vanilla I played on a friend's account occasionally as I didn't get my own until TBC. He ended up befriending a Chinese gold farmer in Arathi, AoE grinding the farms. They would both just do that grind until they were high enough level to leave Arathi. 
---
I was able to play with him a few times too, I was surprised to find out that we were taking turns pulling mobs so we could both level up, which was essentially slowing him down. Eventually he got ahead of us and we didn't see him around much.
---
Fast forward a month or so and my friend's mage is level 50 and I decide to do some WSG and get a whisper from that game Chinese gold farmer, saying he and his buddies  (co workers I guess) were going to run Stratholme and that they had an empty slot. None of em spoke proper English, but it was nice to see they were willing to carry us through Stratholme for essentially nothing in return. Even made me two bags after the run. My friend went on a couple more runs with them.
---
He ended up disappearing a month or two later, we just chalked it down to the account being banned.
---
Asking the real questions
---
One of my friends in EU got an invite today, he's not a streamer, but he's been playing non-stop since 2004, I suppose game time is a big factor
---
WoW is not outdated. Vanilla is similar to current rpgs. 
---
15 a month.
---
Player base is definitely friendly. The game does a good job guiding you as well.
---
You’re not going to find a better mmorpg.. I’ve tried for years. Nothing compares, everything falls short.
---
Both classes have high skill ceilings, but are easy to get the basics of. There's many little things that locks can do to make them really efficient. But Hunter is overall easier to get a handle on. Also, as lock if your on alliance you have to deal with will of the forsaken which can be a pain if you don't have engineering.
---
to be honest I do not remember. It wasnt on private servers for sure... you had to shift+right click for auto loot. I dont know if vanilla had auto loot though, but considering there was an addon for rogue to help him with pickpocket (because of the absence of auto loot) I guess its true.
---
Bag space does! The real struggle.

no, they weren't
---
makes sense, thank you
---
Yes, you gain more experience from quests, combat and exploration, which people always ignore when making these "how much exp does it take..." charts. 
---
Why aren't you this aggressive towards those posters?
---
Maybe you should, so you can stream snipe and kill them
---
And Nostalrius had 800,000 players, with 150,000 active at the time of shutdown lul.
---
Dann kommst du um das komplette Sichten wohl nicht drum herum. Zugangsdaten bleiben natürlich bei dir, aber die doch so heiklen anderen Fotos möchte ich sehen! 😂
---
The best part is Venruki was a top tier player in Vanilla, as well as TBC. Most of the people gate-keeping this aggressively almost certainly played less WoW and were nowhere near as good as venruki back then. And venruki does it while being one of the most genuine and kind streamers on twitch.
---
But hey, these dudes hit level 60 on nostalrius like twice. They know everything, fuck these streamers!
---
Actually pretty decently drawn 👍
---
yea thats really good to be honest, even if I belong to the crowd of "no changes" :)
---
Of course it will wipe
---
No head start. Everyone will start fresh on the release of Classic.
---
Yes. It'll wipe.
---
The 15 year anniversary CE is close enough for me.     
---
Even though it isn’t purely dedicated to Classic, I think it’s the closest we’ll ever get (besides the original one ofc). 
---
When they officially announced Classic WoW at Blizzcon 2017 I promised myself that I’d buy anything that even remotely resembles a Classic WoW collector’s edition if they ever chose to release one. 
---
Vanilla WoW has a special place in my heart and getting a collector’s edition for that kind of game is something I personally won’t regret, so I ordered the 15th anniversary CE moments after it was announced.
---
I usually don't care much for figurines/statues in collector's editions but that Ragnaros looks pretty sweet. 
---
In my opinion, in-game rewards for Classic – especially mounts – would somewhat tarnish the experience, so I’m quite happy that the ones in the CE are for retail only.     
---
The only way I’d be okay with this kind of reward in Classic would be if you’d have to pay 1000g in-game to receive them.
---
Depending on the motives on the art prints, I might frame them in combination with my original game disks.
---
Don’t really care much for the mouse-pad but the 30 days of game-time are a welcome addition.
---
As for stuff that would've been a nice addition:
---
* a behind-the-scenes documentary
---
* a CD with the sountrack
---
* an artbook
---
Characters in beta wont transfer to real realms
---
I was also a kid back then. I played on my dad's account.
---
Yes, it will be wiped.
---
they could give sylvanas this [high elf student model](https://ironyca.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/high-elf-student1.jpg?w=547). not the best option overall but probably the best for vanilla
---
Another common PvP 60 spec is going Destro/affliction. You get nightfall in the affliction tree so that you can throw up corruption on a bunch of targets and get instacast shadow bolts. But then you go the rest in the destruction to get conflag on the bottom another insta cast that hits hard. 
---
SL is good for PvP because it keeps you alive which is important, but this build is good for pvp because you do a shit ton of damage really fast which is also important.
---
i think some guilds had heaps of players and multiple raids
---
the guild i was in was a strict time and not too many extra players because people who dont get to raid become salty pretty fast
---
pugs were also pretty common and should be even more common in classic
---
weekend run guilds were common and may suit you
---
because its 40 people being on time or early was pretty important 5-10 late people make the entire raid late and many of the raids take considerable time.
---
Vanilla WoW is the best mmorpg i have ever played.
---
I played back then and stopped half way through the first expansion.
---
I stepped into a vanilla private server a while ago and i played it for over a year, until blizzard announced classic.
---
I don't know what it is, but this game has something no other game can offer me. 
---
Rumors say nostalgia is a dirty liar, so in this case it can't be nostalgia that makes it so great for me.
---
Sent you a DM.
---
He's a professional speedrunner who wrote the speedrunning guide back in Vanilla.
---
He finished off enemies in melee because it's quicker to loot.
---
Retail 10 million active. You can populate one server with 150k active bc thats not all on at once thats people who log in at least once a month
---
Layers for the sake of "work" though is not the important characteristic, becuase if we just put gates in front of things that does not make them fun automatically. It's that the gates are well related to the fantasy of the game and the player's type. If you have to act out the actions of a role, then you get a sense of immersion.
---
Just found this and already reconnected with an old guildy
---
Dun Morogh/Loch Modan/Wetlands are super fun.
---
&gt; On live servers I have done this frequently 
---
Why would you think you couldn't?  Also this gets asked 10x a day.
---
damage is fine. threat might be working off more modern calculations since we're using the 8.0.1 engine, such as retribution aura/thorns giving threat to Asmongold instead of the caster.
---
Can't post this too much tbh. UPBOAT!
---
She was a high elf in wc3. The high elves fought with the alliance, and their home was silcermoon city. Sylvanas died fighting Arthas, and then he resurrected her as a banshee
---
come back it plays like wow, its free as long as you have a sub to BFA, classic or vanilla wow is all about community yeah there are toxic people but the majority of people are just like you trying to group up and have fun,yes i think you getting into the game would be great we need more players for sure i think you will enjoy it without any bias i would say the biggest reason to play classic is just to see what all the hype is about are you not curious to see what we have been asking for for the last 10-15 years ? huge raids community the feeling of accomplishment when u finish something difficult the list is endless the biggest reason i wanted to classic is im more of a hardcore player not saying classic is hardcore it just has more elements of hardcore-esk things about it
---
Mayonnaise.
---
Hyperbole friend.
---
And that is where you are wrong ya sillyhead.
---
You're the one that should stop this nonsense.  
---
  It's already been said multiple times SINCE THE DEMO that the beta runs on low end systems just like vanilla did, if not better due to various improvements.    
---
  It doesn't has none of the textures, modern particles, anti aliasing, the bulk of legion/bfa content, the long view distance, etc.  
---
  Why the hell would it run like bfa?   
---
  Just because it's using the game as a base doesn't means it's the exact same game, inform yourself.
---
So we can expect „dark“ nights like back in the vanilla build.
---
Spotted the person who never actually played vanilla or tbc and just played private servers. Venruki was one of the best players in the world during vanilla-wotlk.
---
Alchemy makes potions and elixirs with buffs that everyone needs. Many people will go with it too, and it's also a gold maker. You need Herbalism to pick herbs to be able to make flasks and elixirs, so that takes up the 2 slots you have for main professions. You only have 2 slots for main professions (Secondary professions like First Aid, Cooking and Fishing—you can get all.)
---
Enchanting is a bit different since you automatically get *Disenchanting* with getting Enchanting. Enchanting basically lets you 'magically' put extra stats on equipment, like "+100 extra health points on chest items."
---
To be able to do that, you need to use Disenchanting to gest dust, and you basically get dust by disechanting equipment of different levels.
---
You cannot have Alchemy, Herbalism AND Enchanting together.
---
You can have Alchemy and Enchanting, but that makes you miss out on Herbalism which is needed for Alchemy.
---
So people who go with Enchanting just tend to go with some gather profession, like Herbalism, Mining and Skinning.
---
I just search in Chrome or squeeze my phone and have Google Assistant search so I've never liked a home screen search bar. Actually that's the main reason I switched to Nova Launcher back in the day - I couldn't remove the Google search bar with Google launcher.

---
RemindMe! 15 months "this guy said it will be dead"
---
It hasn't completely killed gaming for me personally, it has however completely killed off retail WoW for me. I was able to slog along during BFA just doing mount runs and farming gold, however now that beta is out, every time I log in I just wish it was classic.
---
I've just been keeping myself busy with my backlog of single player games right now. Finishing up Red Dead Redemption 2, and got God of War to play. No idea what I'm gonna do after that though... hopefully I'll have the beta by then!
---
The power of hate/frustration :D
---
Not really a quest but im excited for the new Barrens chat back in the day on my server it was litterally full of chuck norris jokes and laugh's ...since we are older now i feel like its going to be all trump like private servers but im still excited for that lol...also the npc im most happy to see again is thrall in all his vanilla glory
---
You can equip, just can’t transmog
---
Then you obviously don’t have access to the beta...
---
Skipping bfd seems very efficient , you don’t bother running all the way to Zoram strand. World PvP there will be miserable and the gys aren’t generous in ashenvale
---
Just taunting the dragons could really fuck things up, especially if any of them manage to breathe on the raid because their breath applies a 30 second debuff that adds a 10 second cooldown to all abilities (it also stacks). Then Emeriss causes players to drop mushrooms that deal AoE damage on death, Lethon hits one side of him with several shadowbolt volleys, Ysondre has a chaining lightning attack that does more damage with each target.
---
It seems like when a player gets effected by stone skin totem, even when the buff is gone, you still retain the damage reduction it gives.
---
Obviously the damage reduction should go after losing the buff.
---
Evidence: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425373790?t=01h32m24s
---
Time stamp is just the first application of stoneskin, you have to go backwards/forwards in the video to compare damage, but before Crendor was effected by the stoneskin totem for the first time, the crabs he was killing earlier did regular damage, but after he had been effected by it and lost the buff he was taking way less damage from the exact same crabs. The same thing happened to Joana, tigers hit like him 5-7, he got effected by stoneskin, then the tigers hit 2-4.
---
oh i like this pls share how you set it up is it an app or just a stock app like clock ?
---
Since I want to go Horde, how do I deal with the inevitable withdrawals from no longer being able to be a paladin?

Yeah but that's not the authentic vanilla experience so you should just play bfa instead (/s)

just give me a wow box with the original art maybe in black and white to buy for like 20-30 bucks and i would be happy maybe throw in a game guide for good measure and a figure of Cthun because why not

I’m glad for this as well. That being said I’ll level an alt or two on a PVP server, but I’m so glad I’ll have the ability to quest without some ?? Rogue spending his spare time ganking me.
---
I'm of two minds about this, personally.
---
On the one hand, yes, the WoW Hunter forum could be truly nasty, back in the day.  But on the other, I've seen the single-minded obsession with "inclusion" also wreck a lot of things recently.  There's a difference between genuinely psychopathic elitism, and people becoming so sensitive than in the end you can hardly say anything at all, without someone crying about having their feelings hurt.
---
It's funny.  I was a member of probably the second generation with autism, who went through the education system in my country.  I know what psychological abuse feels like, to the point where at the end of high school, I was in a psychiatric inpatient unit for two months.  Yet when I look at the way the world is now, I can honestly say that I would prefer things the way they were back then.  If I could send intersectional feminism and the political correctness movement back where they came from, I would do it in a heartbeat.
---
The world was a much more sane, coherent place before said movements existed.  People had a much clearer and stronger sense of right and wrong.  We didn't have the epidemics of depression and anxiety that we do now.  People actually had a spine.
---
23, didn't play until Burning Crusade launched but I am so hyped for classic. I quit after Cata,  resubbed for a month then quit with each new expansion except BFA which I never gave a chance.
---
Warsong Gulch didn't have a timer until wotlk right?
---
It's like half the people in this subreddit didn't actually play vanilla/tbc/wotlk and just pretended to because they played on a private server or two. Anyone who doesn't actually know who venruki is proving that someone like him should be in the beta and they shouldn't.
---
Tips has been playing with Soda. I think that's what's going to keep him afloat.
---
We always thought it was the main alliance guild that told them, both alliance guilds and a horde one were at 13/15, and blood legion had just went 15/15 the week before.
---
A ragnaros Statue would be epic.
---
lol is he butt hurt over that ?
---
This is categorically wrong. It's like half you people have blinders and forgot about xfire, or the HUGE pvp videos made back then (some by venruki, btw).
---
Stop gate-keeping, private server baby.

You're*

I played vanilla through wrath on PvP servers, but I'm definitely going PvE for classic. I like the idea of PvP, but the actual experience is not fun. No one will actually attack another player unless they're 99% sure they're going to win, basically only if they grossly outlevel, outnumber, or outgear the other player. Every PvP encounter I had was either me destroying the other player(s) or the other player(s) destroying me. I can't recall a single time it was actually enjoyable.

not dark dark like alpha but "darker"

THIS DOESN'T FIT INTO THE NARRATIVE

SHUT IT DOWN

How does fishing work in classic, if i'm low fishing trying to catch in a high level area do i just get nothing?
---
or do i just have a lower likelihood of getting that areas fish?
---
DUDE! I did the same thing! Turns out the character I talked to had like 2-3 people playing it in shifts. I was friends with 2 of them and one of them more so. The one I was friends with more so ended up coming to us on a DM run and gave me a 20-30g bag that dropped (big deal at the time that was a lot of gold). We ran into him in Org and gave him a full farmer set (farmer's overalls, farmer's hat, pitchfork, plain white t, maybe some blue pants?) it was hilarious.
---
Check rules, friendo.
---
Yep, there is quite a lot of encounters with a lot of adds where a feral druid can switch to tanking gear (stamina and armor are the most important stats) and take on the adds. If you arent required to tank you stay in cat and pull decent DPS and provide 3% crit aura to your group. Prepare for jealousy of rogues and warriors though when you take 'their' gear as a 'meme' spec. :D

So I've never played WoW simply because my PC was garbage and by the time I upgraded the core version of WoW was unappealing to me. When does classic WoW release and does everyone start from the lowest level day one?
---
layering solves this problem. by forcing everyone into a smaller list of initial servers and layering them with full-server population caps per layer, you can be sure that every server which fills at least 1 layer will have a healthy population. tourists are expected to leave from every layer, and when the layers merge the server's population will be brought back to healthy.
---
I don´t go to parties. But the guilds I have been with seemed to be ok with my presence, if that helps.
---
Same. I met my friend after running Blasted Lands over and over for Gromsblood. I started noticing the same dude every time then one time I saw him almost get fucked up by the random dragon/drake that patrols that zone so I saved him and we started chatting.
---
There was no magic in community. Building the community was work. But the thing is it did not feel like work back in the day because we had not done it as much. There were things about cross-realm play in random dungeon finder that did alter how the community interacted, but it's impossible to separate that from our own burnout dictating that we just not try as hard to maintain our individual server community.

I am the father of a beautiful 18 month old daughter. I started wow April 1st 2005 and am so very excited to play classic. Alas, responsibilities are responsibilities. And I will mainly be playing between the hours of 9pm and 1am depending on her bedtime. I will make it to 60 though!! Just need to decide on a class first.. lol
---
Hi, /u/Rgsolver
---
Report back to me here with the findings
---
August 26th (6pm est) is the official release. everyone starts at level 1.
---
Why on earth are you guys so stressed out. I get that you want to get into the beta and that you want people to test shit but it hasnt even been a week. Relax and the most testing will probably be during stresstests. A shit ton of people will do better than a few streamers using their entire days testing... please relax
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Add-ons are advanced but stuff like original decursive (spam key to decurse everyone) doesn't work anymore. Stuff that plays the game for you is stuff that blizz has taken a stand against.
---
I also feel like decursive as it used to be wouldn't be as useful today anyway, when players are less crap... Seriously, how hard is it to press decurse on people who have a curse?
---
There will be undercutting and it will be rampant. Also people will undercut by wild amounts and frustrate other people and it will be hilarious.
---
&gt;The core World of Warcraft philosophy is still in the game between Cata+ and Classic.
---
fuuuck dude
---
You're in the wrong place.
---
As if we haven't been playing it already for years on private servers too
---
Youd never know with all these "world firsts" that the streamers are going for...
---
I was feeling the same way for awhile (still kind of am), but found out something beneficial I could be doing to prepare myself for classic. I’ve just been gold farming every couple of days / reposting auctions on retail. It’s like kind of fun cause it’s still wow, but the more money I make, the more tokens I can buy, and the longer I can get free game time for classic wow. Even just like spending an hour afking posting auctions or farming a dungeon (afk = alt tabbing every couple of mins) is benefiting by getting me game time with little work. And honestly it’s still kinda fun
---
you can't really make a gearscore addon for classic, the item system is too diverse. lvl 35 items can be BiS until BWL in some cases
---
It's not a question of if you have to, it's a question of deciding when you get there if you want to. That's not something anyone here can tell you.
---
Hahah OP wondering why everyone is so mad
---
I was iffy on this topic but i now think there is definitely something wrong with Elite mob damage.
---
I just watched Asmon pull 8-10 same level elite mobs in Dun Modr and he barely needed any heals.. that should be a wipe easily.
---
Is it possible elites are doing the damage of normal mobs?
---
Huh? Maybe philosophy was the wrong word. But I was on about the vibe of the game in terms of exploration, discovering zones and secrets, progressing in leveling, grinding, horde vs alliance etc.
---
I'm in FF list, no beta so far :(
---
That's not true, theres always lots of dps warriors too
---
That’s kind of like saying once there is a very fast world record time set for the 100m dash, nobody should strive to beat that. I just don’t get people who share your mindset.
---
yes afaik
---
The druid idea is great. Might even just level one to 35 so I can max out alchemy. Thanks 😀
---
Why is Tipsout a "face" for Vanilla? Dude dosen't even know which zeppelin goes where.
---
No, honestly, no addons and macros would be fantastic, instead having the devs optimize the UI and making things customizable. Make it even for everyone.
---
Oof, over a hundred episodes. Can you recommend any standout episodes to listen to? I don't have time to start listening to  them all :(
---
Or maybe Blizzard remembers people voicing the same complaints I am right now back in the day and realizes that the vanilla experience isn't complete without people bitching about Anduin and Sylvanas's placeholders ...
---
That intro
---
I agree. Layering is the exact thing that solves this. Now... After 5 years they have to come up with something else. But layering is pretty smart
---
you should be fine, if you can handle both bfa and private servers it's safe to assume you can handle classic.
---
Lmao thanks, man. I love your content, btw! You’re good at what you do.
---
Nope. No, no, no, no. No. NO.
---
Filthy Horde don’t deserve him as warchief. You can have your false Jesus - Thrall - leave Omar alone!
---
For the Alliance!
---
I am pretty bifactional and I can confirm it's always "the other side" that appears to be better. 
---
That being said though, in my 13 some years on this game, I can say with some confidence that the Horde are /generally/ better at PVP. But YMMV.
---
Exactly. I would trust Omar and the dev's team ability to use the reference server to get the values right. People trust their memory way too much, luckily the devs don't need to rely on memory because they have the actual data.
---
vanilla is really hard btw
---
I mean, he gets alot of views both on youtube and twitch. I agree he is not a good face, but a face none the less. Its a market drive by the customer, aka us, the viewers.
---
Don't worry, I know what you mean ... the true spirit of WoW as MMORPG :) 
---
... am I right ? :P
---
Title says elites 10 levels above him, text says same level (or +1)
---
k
---
Literally legions lore was thousands of times better than classic. People are seeing classic thru nostalgia goggles and forgetting what a buggy grindfest it was. It wasn't fun they are just remembering their childhoods.
---
We're going home.
---
I think it was more opaque/see-through in vanilla.. But that's going by my 16 year old memory lol
---
In the early times yea, but at certain levels players can farm certain mobs for really good vendor stuff. And if you're a rogue there are some dungeons you can run and just pickpocket making a good bit of gold per hour along with lockboxes. :)
---
You may miss out on your class quest at level 10. For instance, if you roll a druid, you won't get the quest that teaches you bear form.
---
Think some context is needed here, did he solo pull all these or was he still getting healed by a raid?
---
Ya, exactly. I understand the comparison between current WoW and ARPG and how it's lost elements of MMORPG which Classsic will restore.
---
Hi, /u/TROPiCALRUBi
---
&gt;even if you can stay at almost middle of raid dps
---
Middle of raid dps for a melee that needs the same gear as the rogues/wars is bad though, that's the point. There's extra risk to being melee and cats aren't worth it.
---
then he cries about being frost nova'd, seriously all he does is cry, cries on bfa now crying on vanilla, i just cant watch him anymore, idk how he has so many viewers.
---
&gt; When I smashed their bid for our first Stormrage helm they flipped shit and quit the guild.
---
LOL that's awesome.
---
I was a mage, so gear competition was a bit more fierce.
---
If you aren't on a PVP server, make a paladin alt. Or you could make it on another server.
---
i'm not sure what fantasy land you live in where you think anything you mentioned below wasn't systematically gutted throughout expansions
---
Yes, just so people can ask about the damage values(because you know they will) and finally put this issue to rest. Your memory is not more valid than the actual data from 2004.
---
I can provide my take on what they might do from an engineering perspective:  
---
I assume a realm is either A) a server with an entire WoW Application Suite running, probably its own VPS or something, or B) An instance of the entire WoW App running on a server with several instances/images sharing the resources.
---
So for A, which I think is most likely, more servers = higher costs, since every Realm needs its own server.  
---
That in mind, I believe they will have a team monitoring realm health (in whatever way they see fit).  
---
Say a realm becomes 'sick', they will try to mitigate sickness by perhaps putting it top of server list for new players etc.  
---
Say a realm does not 'recover' and 'dies', then they will likely due to A) look to reduce costs, and migrate (combine the two realms into one server, lowering costs) this Realm with another 'dead' realm, say server X has 80/20 faction split and server Y has 20/80 faction split, then those two are compatible.  
---
Now assume that there were no 'compatible' servers to migrate with, they may let people know of the death of the realm, offering them a selected list of realms (most likely sick realms) to freely migrate their character to, in an attempt to save those realms.
---
for B) It will be sort of the same process but migrating image DBs (internal realm migrations) and probably fewer server migrations.   
---
I can't say this is what they will do, but I think it is a very likely plan of action.
---
It'd be kinda cool if they ran it like Jagex runs Old School Runescape and add it's own unique content and whatnot
---
I know there was a video of him swapping trinkets in combat, but yeah he might be misremembering
---
With no proof? Don't bother posting.
---
Spent 4-5 hours leveling with a guy from France today. We went from Westfall to Redridge back to Westfall and ended it doing early Loch Modan quests. Easily the best time I have had gaming since I quit during BC. Vanilla somehow is better than I remembered it.
---
He had 4 people in his group and where 3 of them could heal him.
---
Lots of heals, and popped a health pot too.
---
Nothing wrong with the gameplay on it, it was a good save
---
im bouta shoop da whoop yo ass
---
10 is the amount of elites.
---
You don't, see this link: https://i.redd.it/7ny7nki0l0z21.png
---
Yes. You need an active sub.
---
It's also possible these players have better than average gear for their level since they are farming BiS at 30.
---
even in wotlk doing these quest was harder.
---
you were quite right and I enjoyed your post.
---
I feel like in Legion all the lore from the quests around is about the same enemy/force that must be stopped, but in Vanilla it was much more small stories that didn't involve the endgame bosses everywhere
---
Yeah, damage in beta seems completely nerfed from old vanilla. elite Dark iron dwarves were hitting them for 30 to 50 being a few levels higher than them. I remember hit for major damage at the same level back in the day, and def couldnt pull more than 2 or 3 for a few of us

You'll have to try it to know
---
Just like it was on retail classic. That's what you get with spellbatching and it's perfectly fine if you are #nochange.
---
It won't break the game but be a nice niche mechanic if you know what you'r doing.
---
I really hope they don't artificially patch it out.
---
i got this from forums somewhere 
---
[https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/)
---
Now this is what i like to see! Streamers actually testing niche shit!
---
Yeah I figured. Looked like OP was just edging for some of that "ThE bEtA iS nOt VaNiLla" bandwagon karma.
---
I had a conversation very similar to this one back then too.  We spent all afternoon chatting but the only thing I remember is that I just couldn't understand why he'd work so many hours for such little money.  At some point he said, "Americans are strange.  You complain about playing a video game all day."  That stuck with me.
---
Hand of Justice out of BRD is exceptionally strong for melee classes.
---
I'm not sure if things proccing off themselves was still a thing that existed in 1.12, but if it is, then it scales even better with things like Thrash Blade, Viskag, etc. It was a really, *really* ridiculous trinket.
---
l2read
---
During vanilla wow, no one played it before trying it and they loved it enough for there to still be a demand for it 15 years later.
---
That literally says the opposite. You need to be subbed to get into the beta.
---
Two 7 year old videos from IGN, so probably not recorded on private servers.

QQ on Firetree?
---
Literally vanilla and I remember this. "Go get me 10 boar meat because I'm hungry" I'll give you 10 silver. Pretty much sums up most of the questing in vanilla
---
I recently started to play on a p-server just to see how it would feel to play classic. I played vanilla but not until the end, but played soooo many hours of tbc! The reward of hitting that even number level, getting to learn more powerful spells is so awesome! And the old talent tree!! Can't wait for classic!
---
I think you've misinterpreted the post. I acknowledge they're fundamentally the same but their executions are different. I look forward to experiencing how they used to be as that will be new to me.
---
Will you enjoy it? Well, that's up to you.
---
Are you invited for fun? Abso-goddamn-lutely.
---
Right, and I'm sure Esfand/Asmongold have people mailing them gold like mad. On the other hand, I watched Nixxiom *attempt* SFK when his group was all level 16... it didnt go well lol.
---
are you crazy? 
---
its related to world of warcraft Classic. Its beta asmongold is streaming it.
---
why are people watching streamers ?  go do something with your life.  even PLAYING a video game is more productive than watching somebody else play
---
Did this the first time around. In August, I'll be on pve since my playtime restricted by my kiddo, job and wife. Which is fine, but I cant lose out on playtime to 10 min corpse runs only to respawn back into unnecessary pvp.
---
I will miss mindcontrolling people into the lava flows tho.
---
Sorry that was overly inflated. I'll give you 10 copper.
---
With such approach you are going to have a blast playing classic :) ... 
---
I remember playing since classic and every new expansion was downgrade in ... ( don't laugh you sneaky jokers:P ) ... downgrade in true spirit of WoW MMORPG ... I stopped playing in Panda ...
---
I can't wait for classic :)
---
&gt;This time I'll be going with Elemental though. Probably. Maybe.
---
Okay but consider this: 1-shotting fools in WSG because they underestimated your burst potential
---
This is a game that quickly got alot of people addicted. Sure you will be fine like we all were 14 years ago!!
---
If u like rpgs, ud love it. For me its the perfect rpg. The world is massive, mysterious. Caves, dungeons with bosses and loot. And u share real bonds to real Ppl in it
---
We used to have a Chinese gold farmer in our guild back in Burning Crusade. The guy gave me a Precisely Calibrated Boomstick that he found, which was a very high attack speed epic world drop gun. I miss that man.
---

---
This is my favorite I've listened to so far. It's with Kevin Jordan, of Staff of Jordan fame. He played a big role in class design, talent trees, spells, and may be the sole reason why WoW launched with pvp. 
---
There are podcasts with experts from most (all?) classes that are worth listening to for the class you plan on playing. Lots of good shit in there covering so many topics, you can scroll through and find a topic that interests you.
---
This is why a single penny being unaccounted for when doing accounting is such a big concern, if one penny is missing you don't know if the numbers might be way worse and you just don't realize it.
---
Even if the penny *isn't* missing, it's worth looking into if you think it might look a bit suspicious. Worst case scenario you realize that you didn't need to be worried and now you don't have to stress about it.
---
&gt; Never played an expansion with LFR goober
---
The guy who can't quest without an arrow is telling me he doesn't play with LFR. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL Nobody believes you.
---
Yes. You need to be subbed.
---
I agree, and I need to pick a server faaaaar away from that house fire lol
---
Everyone who loved it when it was new were noobs.
---
I believe you're right, but where is this actually mentioned?
---
In my opinion Classic is for people who don't mind investing a lot of time in the game and like old school mmos. You might enjoy classic even more if you've never played wow before because there's a huge world for you to explore.
---
I probably did exist, but not as red and flashy as it is in the beta right now.
---
They said you must be subbed for a chance.
---
They also had skorch for some runs and he was beta first level 30
---
The fuck are you on about?
---
As far as I understand, Layering works on an instance of the entire application, by copying the entire DB into a new layer for overpopulation to hinder tagging issues for mobs and respawns.  
---
Depending on how their setup is running, layering may only apply to that instance of the application, which could very well be per realm. Even if a server hosts multiple instances of the application (multiple realms), they will not share the same DB, because that would be bad utilization of resources to copy multiple realm instances into each layer (because realm A never interacts with realm B, so realm A does not need the data of realm B).  
---
Layering is as I see it implemented as means to assure a quality experience on overpopulated realms, OP is concerned about dying realms.
---
Literal god
---
Disabling WM works in any rested area, still only enabled in org/sw tho.
---
Yeah. I'm definitely not as hardcore as others and I'm not going to lie about being a vanilla player. I look forward to experiencing the game that I love to play but in a different way that feels entirely fresh. Whether it'll feel an improvement or not or maybe an entirely new game (which I either enjoy or dislike) is the best part because I get to decide that myself. Looking forward to it.
---
Hope you enjoy your time back in the game.
---
i didnt race to 60 i went at a casual pace 3-5 hours a day in middle school ( after homework of course) like i actually did it thoe) and it took me about a month solid IRL to hit 60 minus afk time
---
Fill up a glass pan with chicken 
---
add flour 
---
add chicken bouillon 
---
(you don't need normal salt just add it so it's seasoned)
---
Oven on 375 to 425 to 35minutes to an hour
---
depending on size
---
 if your not sure how to figure out the temp  put it on 400 for an hour but add a cup of water
---
Extremely edible simple chicken

It won’t let you cast your line if your fishing skill is too low. Even if it will there could be a chance the fish escape. This guide is worth a read: https://legacy-wow.com/fishing-guide-getting-started/
---
For hand of rag, you will need a combination of gold/materials but you also need to be given the eye by your guild. If this is your goal you’ll need to make it clear to your guild and work hard. It’s not used in pve but will be a reward to a loyal raider.
---
The Classic team are pretty determined to stay true to how vanilla was. The only noticeable differences would be graphics settings, and BattleNet connection. I'd be fairly certain if mass-looting wasn't in vanilla, then it won't be in Classic. If they allow addons, then window sizes could probably be altered. But I doubt an addon would be able to mass loot, because of range checks.
---
I don’t get it what is everyone “sipping for” I’m missing the drink even in the picture!? And what’s a “boomer”
---
My bad, been through three different conflicting responses from GMs in the past two days.
---
Mine was stolen and banned back in 2010 and I got in.
---
I started playing in Wrath (I’m 22) but I’m so hyped to experience classic without the nostalgia to see how good it actually is. I’ve been watching streamers and videos and man it still reminds me of my first days playing wow in 2009.
---

2nd time? I think this will be my 8th

---
Cuz I'm addicted junky 
---
Not the best answer for gfs but at least true
---
In a raid? Not really. Sword rogues have a bit of nuance to them that other classes might not have. People will tell you to keep slice and dice up all the time and use 5pt evis when you can, and thats basic enough, but a lot of encounters have target switches (you lose combo points when you switch targets) or times when you aren't dpsing (baron geddon, firemaw, etc) so it can be a bit of a challenge making sure as little energy and SnD time is wasted. Additionally, you'll want to pool your energy and dump it when you get double crusader procs, and you'll want to time your SS usage for right after your main hand auto attack goes off to maximize the effect of sword spec, hand of justice, and windfury totem.
---
Dagger rogues are a bit simpler because they almost never get to use eviscerate outside of adrenaline rush/thistle tea usage.
---
There are some key differences in a beta versus live. The current cap is level 30 so nobody is in any rush and it's all going to be wiped in a few months. So people are much more willing to mess around because it's not live.
---
I tried fishing in Redridge from skill 1 on Beta. No fish would ever hook. I went back to Elwynn Forest and skilled up to 50, then came back. I would finally get the animation but it would almost always result in the fish getting away, and you don't get skill ups in that scenario. So I think you'll need to level up fishing in the lower level areas before progressing in the higher level zones.
---
We did too.  To this day, I can still hear the guy saying, "Coco eat bomb!" after he died to a certain fire elemental...
---
Gorilla Robot in Un Goro  
---
Endless long quest chains in Duskwood  
---
Lore quests about the wars in East / West Plaguelands   
---
I am sorry I can't  remember names
---
there will be MC and Onyxia pugs that you can join. These are not difficult raids and you can at least earn epic equip here. Later on, there will be ZG pugs that you can join. I know its a raiding, but what im saying is, you dont really need a guild and do constant raiding, but you can join a raid, whenever you feel like it and eventually get some equip.
---
OP has to show how he rolls, bro.
---
I really enjoyed the Hakkar quest line, it leads up to all sorts of events and then you get to eventually face him in ZG. I really loved going into ST and Hinterlands knowing i was going to encounter more that quest line. And when you finally got the climatic fight in ZG i was for real blown away with how a story can start so small develop before my eyes. It felt like playing wc3 and 'I' was the hero destined to defeat this enemy.
---
I feel like initial body agro is way off. I can get right up next to things before they finally see me
---
Lets be real thoe ....this guy looks hella tired lol. and i appreciate all he has done for the dream
---
dkpminus.com be freeeeee my friend
---
thanks for the guide, i'll give it a good look.
---
i'm already in a guild from P servers and we're sticking together for classic. They know i want it but i want to be a step ahead by getting the crafting materials as fast as i can, if i already have the hammer of sulfuras when an eye drops nobody will argue with me getting it.
---
The problem is, we both work, so will be way behind the curve. So were worried in a month after release when plenty of people are level 60, we'll be easy and prime targets.
---
I notice I got ganked a lot less as a gnome female compared to male dwarf........
---
Can someone explain who is the leader of the Alliance in vanilla? I keep hearing mixed answers.
---
I'm gonna sound edgy but I'm starting to really hate these types of questions. Is it that hard to just have a think about it?
---
I'll give an example:
---
You've gotten used to eating Vanilla Icecream but with lots of additions such as chocolate flakes, strawberry syrup, coconut cubes and maybe even some fondue inside because why the fuck not. You like it, it's icecream after all.
---
Then you suddenly have a chance to taste just a pure vanilla icecream; no additions, no fancy fondues and flakes. Just plain, original, vanilla icecream.
---
Will you enjoy it? Most probably yes, because it's the base of what you're used to eating. But you *might* find it a bit bland in some places. Yet, things can be good just they way they are, without any additions and fancy things.
---
So, in general, if you like MMOs, RPGs and most importantly, an *actual sense of a community and belonging*, then yes, you most definitely will like Classic.
---
Yeah.  I have seen so many cases where people prove the damage is the same, but what I'm seeing on the streams just doesn't make sense to my eyes.  If he can tank 8-10 elites and barely lose health, how many non elites could he tank?
---
Might i suggest something? Go to a discord for classic guilds. They are already forming. Join one and chat away, make friends any time you want. Worse case nothing, best case you have a guild for release already. Worked for me :) I even get to play SP (1 per raid, casual guild, perfect fit from the sounds)
---
HoJ, RECKONING BOMB, walk away as the rogue dies fromm holy explosions.
---
Of course, but if you simply do not want to tank in raids, then you have no place as a dps warrior. EVERY warrior will have to tank at some point, that's just how raiding is.
---
My memory is foggy, too. No stress, you'll remember them soon!
---
simply amazing
---
Speak quickly young one, I have urgent matters to attend.
---
I remember reading that fanfic about the faction leaders all gathering a party to do dungeons and failing hard. I miss it. It had five chapters, each corresponding to one "gripe". Never completed. Wonder what happened to him/her?
---
1. Razorfen Kraul, where Shandris and Tyrande get into an argument over whose gear belongs to whom.
---
2. Scholomance, where Bolvar insists on everyone running it over and over again for his "ret gear".
---
3. Un'Goro, where a bunch of players get into a fight with Shandris, Bolvar and a guy who never PvPed over Devilsaur spawns.
---
4. Onyxia, where Sylvanas keeps dying, tail whacked and the "Raid Leader" (Some guy) keeps getting calls to kick her out and bring someone in who knows to handle the whelps and stop DPS.
---
5. The Auction House, where Sylvanas's fellow Forsaken low-ball her for mats she needs for potions.
---
I had exactly opposite experience. I came to Wow from another MMO, so concept of builds, keybinds and minmaxing wasn't new to me. My first character was a tauren shaman on a medium-pop RP realm (huge mistake) and I was amazed at how bad ppl were there. We had only 1 guild trying AQ40 and Naxx so I never progressed past BWL. Razorgore was a big roadblock, ppl just couldn't deal with the adds. Come TBC I rerolled draenei shaman on a big Pvp realm and was invited to one of the top guilds with whom I progressed all the way to Illidan server first kill. Funny thing - ppl were still bad even in that guild, for example we consistently wiped 2-3 times on Archimonde and Illidan even while farming. Or ppl wiping raid on Gorefiend cause they couldn't grasp ghost mechanics
---
No, you had to hold shift to auto-loot a mob
---
&gt;People like to get items right away, so will most likely prefer "buy now"
---
I want an item now, not maybe an item in 12 hours.
---
this spirit of vanilla wow is not dead it is right here
---
Yay dude. I just responded to a thread about Dead servers where someone was claiming Layering will solve that. I think a lot of people have a hard time grasping layering, sharding and phasing from the technical point of view..
---
&gt;the same horde pvp guild causing havoc.
---
LOL our servers horde PVP guild was actually named 'HAVOC' 
---
The Maelstrom,  EU
---
i have a gold farming friend in BFA. He's from Venezuela and the gold in wow is worth more then bolivares...
---
(I didn't find a good screenshotr from classic :( )[https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bqhha2/i_prefer_the_real_horde_vs_alliance_conflict_only/]
---
Could I give a leg instead? Without my left arm I won’t be very effective... :p
---
Also I won’t need both legs once classic drops! As there will be nothing outside that I’ll want to do!
---
I start school on day 6 of Classic.
---
Legit classic WoW is 12GB lol; easily an overnight/8-hour download on low-speed DSL
---
&gt;Layering is as I see it implemented as means to assure a quality experience on overpopulated realms, OP is concerned about dying realms.
---
it addresses both. let's say every server has two layers -- this is functionally equivalent to having twice as many servers, where you have pairs of servers that are linked to eachother (in the sense that you can invite someone to a party from your linked server but dont normally see them otherwise), and will be at some point merged with eachother.
---
ie, layering == having more servers that are scheduled to be merged.
---
Have you heard about the Chinese goldfarmer?
---
He made them an offer they couldnt onderstand.
---
What kind of ego does it take for you to assume that you know better than someone who is actually playing the game, detailing their actual, real-world experiences?

Most game studios use version control software, like Perforce or Git, (probably Perforce in their case), which means they will have copies of old game files. If their IT team is doing their job, then these copies are backed up all the way to when the game first was created. The main hurdles would include compatibility with modern backend systems. Reading old database tables is possible, but those tables in modern use might be set up entirely different. So moving the information in the fields of the table would take effort.
---
So basically yes, they can literally get the exact damage / stat numbers used back then, with a some effort.
---
It's absolutely true that classic is easier than mythic raids. There is no question about it. But people are able to clear all current content without barely engaging their mind.
---
For many people, the few ilevels of gain over LFR and the gear resets every single patch, mean that the game lacks any real lasting relevancy.
---
You seen this sub since the beta release? lol
---
May you use the term root instead of jailbreak
---
You could see it as a big demo perhaps? Try out different classes / races by doing 1 - 10 runs?
---
One thing that wasn't mentioned, and what I think the primary goal of an off tank was during vanilla, is to be second on the aggro list on any raid boss. This is extremely important because in the event that the MT dies, you don't want 3 DPS higher than the OT on the aggro list as they will likely die, and die fast.
---
Hahah, go read some quests texts you nerd, no one gives a shit about your sad little ass :) 
---
Gonna love me dat arrow, auto accept and auto loot whoop whoop
---
so much agree
---
And on the 15th year, he rose again.
---
Can someone explain me what sit to crit means
---
For a second I thought this was r/TheWire.
---
Esfand popped a swiftness potion and didn't tell Asmongold. I swear, Esfand between this and the duel on the boat, Esfand is becoming a top tier troll.
---
that is an odd solution if you dont mind me saying so. They wouldn't do that, need to create hype for their product. Imo classic epics should have stats compareable with tbc max lvl blues. That would have been incentive enough for many. I dont see any other options, if any1 does do share.
---
The main reason I would run BFD is to get the Grave Stone Scepter quest reward wand. If questing becomes to congested with players I would prefer BRD for this specific wand over pure mob grinding. The wand is really that good and it will make mana management much easier.
---
Just like to point out this is the same thing is saying don't watch movies, TV, documentaries, basically any form of media and go do something else. You must realize how stupid this comment is.
---
Staysafe won't play on a server with asmon and soda
---
Spotted the guy who never played vanilla.
---
i feel you i bought the divisions 2 the day before classic release and beta were announced lol...cant find the drive to play it keep looking at old Vanilla wow forums refreshing on stuff...feelsbadman i want the beta too
---
There will be, but were kind of getting ahead of ourselves when theres no server names out. How could anybody compile a list like that, right now?
---
I'm looking to reliving the dream of being a Paladin. I ended up being a healer and looking to do that again. What advice would you give someone in terms of specing for leveling / dungeons?
---
I heard a streamer mention 50 servers but I don’t think that is very accurate
---
Digged out my old wow account, the feel...
---
Here's a few pics of my night elve : https://imgur.com/a/rUYT9Yi?
---
Not a single epic except for my mount :)
---
Can't wait to create his son and explore Azeroth once again in order to finally equip the bloodfang set.
---
Cheers everyone, can't wait to be back.
---
Everybody was a noob back in 2004, and the game became massively successful. Absolutely, give it a shot!
---
The numbers are set tho lmao
---
Sodapoppins came to a pserver I was on. He made q times go from bad to impossible and then got one of my guildies banned for mc griefing him into the lava repetitively. I hope blizzard gms don’t bow to streamers when they get griefed by others.
---
Appreciate you tagging on to this (: if you don’t mind could you point me in the right direction? I don’t really see any subs on classic about discord’s or anything, how did you find yours?
---
I'm a 30 year oldboy and this is the first i have seen this stuff.  Laughing so hard i'm crying, thanks for the link and the new world of 30 year old boomers.
---
Isnt that why they are in beta though, because stuff isnt finalized and they need to tweak it?
---
lmao.
---
I think its important that you distinguish servers and realms.  
---
Server can host one or more realms.  
---
Layers create copies of ONE realm, but they are still on the same realm.  
---
Realms do have knowledge about other realms (this is explicitly stated during their dev talk).  
---
Layering is a counter-measure for crowdedness due to high population.  
---
   \- Additionally it is a measure they assume to only need at launch and 3-4 weeks after.  
---
   \- The goal is to have each realm as ONE layer.  
---
So if a realm dies, that means that the layers have been merged (which they will be no matter what).  
---
Thus, if a realm starts to show unhealthy signs of population (not due to overpopulation) then layering will definitely not mitigate this issue.
---
I made a python script that checks the store every 30s and sends an email to me (and a few friends that wanted it as well).
---
 I have no more need for it since I was able to prepurchase it via an online store here in Sweden.  
---
I can post the script here if anyone is interested :)
---
it's actually great idea haha
---
I was joking.
---
I totally get what you mean. Personally, i hope they dont go too far with the Classic+ content thing. And if they do, I hope they reuse old assets and spruce them up. I don't want modern raid aesthetics and design plopped onto old Azeroth.
---
But for me, Classic/TBC/Wrath were the golden days. Cata was the first time I unsubbed, after dragon soul's putrid existence.
---
There's a reason the game was so massively popular when it came out.  You can see that if you play classic.
---
Ohhh. Hell yeah. 
---
Burst potential of Elemental is fairly good as well, though.
---
It came on 4 discs. Considering how discs weren't even a gig....no.
---
How much time/effort/skill is needed to reach rank 13 in classic?
---
i'm interested in the armour but i don't care for  rank 14 for the weapons, how many weeks at X amount of hours per day will i need?
---
and is the really a skill check, or jut more of a no life check?
---
thanks.
---
u/Haptiix might have a guide for that.
---
Whenever you sit down and get hit the mobs will crit you. So a fury warrior for example would abuse this to activate the enrage talent since it activated when enemies land a crit on you. This was something people did on private server but it doesn't work in classic so people thought it was a bug.
---
Correction: I just tested it out in the Beta and determined that Rogues can train One Handed Swords for 10 silver at level 1, whereas it was previously thought you’d have to wait until level 10. So now you know you can drop that leveling dagger earlier than expected and switch to a sword. I assume the same applies to maces.
---
Of course! Hopefully you are EU. If not you'll have to find the NA version, im sure some1 in chat could help you with that - else try a google for classic wow discord NA. Here: https://discord.gg/MKx4RC
---
Go to the recruitment section. If you are new to discord feel free to ask any questions. Good luck!
---
Yeah, I could see the looting mechanic being as it was during classic where you had to loot each individual corpse. I do remember there being a mod to make the trade skill window act like it does currently, but I wasn't sure if Blizzard has basically confirmed any "x feature that we introduced in later patches will be in Classic as it really doesn't impact the actual classic sorta gameplay."
---
&gt;Are you supposed to be able to use bleeds on elementals?
---
Nononono, I'm sure all elementals are immune to all bleeds, hope someone without mobile data limit googles the proof
---
What is the point of these posts?
---
as far as i can tell, it's pretty accurate if you're at level, looking at old videos.
---
Who cares what people from customer service say, it's literally in the announcement page for the beta.
---
Precisely. Still, step 1. I might be fine with the TBC version, but not the design philosophy. If the design philosophy could stay, perhaps it could work. I would rather not risk it all together tho. Let players sort out players imo.
---
I'm pretty sure they were connected. It's better that way I think...there is a challenge, then there is a pain in the ass.
---
Wait what, heal aggro gets split among all the mobs?
---
I was fairly certain that it doesnt matter if i pull 20 mobs or 1?
---
Do warlocks/Pallys still have to get their riding training to summon their mount
---
did any streamers commit to getting r14?
---
Not new to disc just new to finding ones I’m not already in, thanks so much. Have a good day (:
---
That background is really good. Nice job!
---
This video got me to level engineering
---
I hope your child is late, and ends up being born ON classic release date, just so it has a special meaning for the date.
---
Along the lines of OMG YOU WERE BORN ON CLASSIC RELEASE DATE?
---
Dad: Yes... she was born on launch day.... I couldn't play for 2 days...
---
Hehe.
---
Yeah, I tried Rogue on PS recently and was like wtf. I think maybe I bought greens on the AH a lot the first time round and maybe that made the difference?
---
Isn't the concept of Alliance leader something introduced in WotLK with the "High-King" title (Varian then)?
---
I always thought that the races were equal before that.
---
[Not officially, but there are archives.](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/)
---
i should have noted:
---
my opinion was only focused on the vitality of servers, communities and therefor the players experience. 
---
PR and money wise, it would have been a horrible idea. which also explains why they didn’t do it.
---
How long is the beta supposed to last? Tempted to resub just at a chance at the beta
---
T’as deux monture 60%?
---
I appreciate you saying that! You seem super nice. I DM’d you (:
---
Months of grinding many hours a day, everyday honestly.
---
I honestly don't see a problem with the different sets of difficulties. If someone wants it hard they get fucking hard and if someone doesn't have the skill, effort or time to put into then they can go in easy mode. The loot system is a different story though obviously.
---
In terms of difficulty and loot wotlk hit the sweet spot imo. 10 or 25 man. Normal and heroic. No titanforging or other nonsense. 
---
I recently quit WoW for the first time and will only return for classic and maybe the next expasion, because of that. Gear has never been replaced so fast as it is the case in BFA. Been farming gear for 4 months from the release of BFA until december. even if you played a lot you got maybe 1 upgrade per week and it was often just so minimal you literally didn't notice at all. Once the patch hit I had replaced literally every single item within a week.
---
Anyways, people saying retail is easy are just not telling the truth.
---
You really think its worth getting R14 in beta lol?
---
If you know what a trinity tab targeting MMO is....Sounds like you do
---
You'll be fine
---
Granted it sounds like you were into the space before WoW. So what is ubiquitous to many will probably be weird to you. You're from a different age
---
The main thing you'll be prepared for is the farming/prep to raid. Modern MMO's are much more lobby games. You can't just win with gold. Vanilla embraced the idea of just throwing gold at your enemy much more than just about any modern western theme park MMO. 
---
Granted they sell gold now so they can't justify those sort of design decisions at easily.
---
delet
---
Will the pet also lock itself away for a few weeks only to bring you an awesome item?
---
What do you think about going backwards in graphics and quality of life for the UI? I loved the game up to BC but admit the way it runs nowadays feels way better than before. LFR can burn though.
---
lvl48 boe gun. right? 
---
i had that too.
---
You're right; I don't know where I got 12GB from, just checked the archive I had on my NAS and it's about 4GB lol
---
Reminds me of when Oldschool Runescape was released and people slammed it to the ground saying it would die.
---
I don’t think it’s so much about controlling layers as much as there will be multiple layers all sharing the same auction house so prices will naturally be much lower than they have been on private servers.
---
the headstart is august 12th/13th (depending on which region).
---
it has nothing to do with beta, it's just the ability to make a characters and reserve names (limit 3 per.....account? I think...might've been realm.), but actually playing won't be available until 26th/27th (depending on region).
---
&gt; Is WoW outdated in terms of gameplay? By this, I mean is it comparable to other more recent RPG’s such as ESO (sorry I know that’s a sore spot for WoW’rs right now). Will it feel familiar or very foreign if I do pick up classic ? 
---
There are games to which, in some respects, classic WoW will feel extremely simplistic by comparison; and others where it will seem as deep as the Marianus Trench.  There are eight character classes, five different armour types, and eight different weapon classes.  Every one of said eight character classes has its' own spells and shot rotation, and several of them require vastly different modes of psychology to play well.
---
WoW's internal metronome is much slower than a lot of games, particularly first person shooters.  You don't necessarily need lightning fast reflexes, although that doesn't mean there isn't a required skillset.  It's just a different one.
---
To be good, you need to know everything for ***your*** class.  You need to know which physical weapon class(es) you should be using, which armour class, and which spells.  In the later expansions, you could get away with having alts, but in Classic, (and particularly if you want to play at raid level) you won't be able to.  During TBC I was practicing at least four hours out of every twenty four, (and frequently twice that) and if I missed a single day I would be able to tell, when I went in the day after.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_LZnRlxt4s
---
Find that one class.  The one class which speaks to you, whichever one it is.  The one class that will at times have you weeping tears of joy.  That one class which you will end up devoting all of your time to; to the point where everything else that used to exist in the background becomes completely meaningless.  The truest, most ecstatic, passionate love of your life.
---
My best friend in WoW was not your typical chinese gold farmer, but he could get gold as fast than anyone on the server, knew the entire games ins and outs and the lore, and was the funniest guy I've ever talked to. Here's hoping Goldspoon sees this and we can play classic together!
---
Oh, someone's got Quel'Serrar!
---
Having a mage hit a frost nova on a monster that is 27 levels above him sounds impossible.
---
Ehhh if I was streamer in beta I’d do what I want maybe I’d take a viewer request to test something every once in awhile
---
I'd be curious to see what they did in regards to much faster / better server architecture. The server CPU timing, clock, server blades talking to each other. It's bound to be a whole lot faster, and probably required a bunch of work. Maybe it can effect the math, maybe not. It would be cool to see a video about it.
---
Btw, you dont want to use milk for hot peppers, instead you use a strong acid like orange juice to cut the reactive capsaicin and it'll help a ton more. You'll still get the heat but it won't linger nearly as long. Done this with fresh habeneros and ghost chilis.
---
BAhahahahahah, so salty. ;)
---
Hi, /u/bmxrival
---
Level 9, same/similar gear, let Hogger hit you and post ss of combat log, I'm thinking.
---
Yo, I've always loved brill, so I took a pic from a decent spot, lightened up the place, darkened the area, and added some flair to it. Hype for classic, need something to do meanwhile :(
---
hmmm. 
---
im in the same (dad) boat. 
---
but id never ever not play on a pvp server. 
---
there is no unnecessary pvp :D
---
rather not progress but enjoy some good pvp. 
---
i remember not gaining any xp/ completing any quests for several hours, because there was heavy pvp. but that time was worth it.
---
How can you be so sure? The pure classes are SO much stronger than the hybrids in vanilla its crazy.
---
Tbf we don't know the chances of realms dying post-launch.  
---
I am pretty sure they are having a population cap on each realm, just like back in the days. It may be larger than back in the day due to better technology, but then I would argue that layering is not the reason, rather the increase in realm population is the reason.
---
Layering is meant to mitigate potential tag-wars over loot and mobs for quests, not really as a tool to keep the realm healthy per say.
---
Even if you get it for cheaper?
---
Are you sure you are not talking about demo shout?
---
And you must have been one hell of a mega advanced guild if you knew of cancelaura and even incorporated it into your tactics in vanilla.
---
Aimed Shot cast time appears to be wrong. I don't know if it's the tooltip specifically, or the cast time on the ability.
---
The tooltip states that Aimed Shot takes 3 sec with 0% haste.
---
Aimed shot is actually taking 3.5 sec with 0% haste.
---
I'm assuming the "shot" cast time like when kiting with autoshot is being added onto the Aimed Shot cast time.
---
They said in the media day interviews Realm Transfers will be in the game but not likely until a certain time has passed, i believe 1 year+ is what Ion has stated, since it was in Vanilla as an in game option for a price back in the day.
---
Thottbot*
---
He is a pretty poor player, not top end by any means but also far better than most of playerbase.
---
What will the addon situation be like? I’m mainly concerned with the UI type addons such as Elv UI, but in general too.
---
But that's just a PvE server with extra steps. If you want to world PvP you flag yourself, when you don't, you don't.
---
Wow...
---
All druid spec (3), all shaman spec (another 3), 2 or pretty much 3 specs of pally, arcane mage, demonology lock and thats just the very top of my head.
---
Ditto.
---
Take my up vote.
---
Wut. The pvp system isnt even set up in beta.
---
TBH the vanilla feel is 100% there all the stuff that is still there from retail doesnt affect what vanilla is
---
not in 1.12
---
TBC did a ton to balance the horrible and weak hybrid classes, perfectly good expansion and best part of WoW by far.
---
Just mainly looking to not sink a bunch of time into a class/spec that I’m going to have to work hard to overcome player biases with my limited time I’ll have to play the game. I’ve played a lot of Priest and specifically shadow, but unsure the viability of spriest and the frustration I may run into maining one. I know priest in general is a highly sought after healer tho. But just wanted a general opinion really.
---
ahh, yeah, replace all "server" with "realm" in my post.
---
and you are right, layering will do nothing to stop realms that die over time -- it will only prevent a server from being abandoned by tourists immediately after launch.
---
For any given itemization level you want a flow MH because that would have the highest top end damage. That is what made the Batman’s Shanker (2.0 attack speed IIRC)  so damned good at level 50, ditto for the Kroll Blade (probably spelled wrong) at lvl 52.
---
Somewhere around 1.2 they normalized the AP part of the damage formula (I think at 2.4 for MH and 1.7 for daggers) which buffer faster weapons and nerfed slower ones a bit, but slow weapons still remained king.
---
For OH go for fastest possible.
---
I think there is a difference between hating people who are just new to the game and criticizing someone who is effectively wasting Blizzard’s development time with obviously untrue bug reports. If he thought the item looked strange, he could’ve googled or checked ClassicDB to get an answer in less than a minute. Instead he reports a “bug” which he has absolutely no reference to.
---
Oh, my god! I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought he looked a bit like Downey.
---
And I wouldn't really be too upset if they did classic content with tbc class design personally
---
My best friend in WoW was not your typical chinese gold farmer, but he was chinese...and boy could he farm gold. He'd get gold as fast as anyone on the server, knew the entire games ins and outs and the lore, and was the funniest guy I've ever talked to. He loved to level. I gave him my account info in case he ever wanted to play my account when I quit and I came back to 2 maxed out leveled characters that he said it was no big deal. Here's hoping Goldspoon sees this and we can play classic together!
---
15th Anniversary Edition? Is that new?
---
TBC would be amazing and solve all the tons of balance issues classic would have, issue is how long we have to wait until its turns to TBC
---
Hey man!  
---
I'll read through this small novel of yours during next week. I'm in the middle of an exam period and my focus is elsewhere atm.  
---
Thanks for all the input, it looks like good stuff from my first glance!
---
You don't see the problem with lots of difficulties when LFR being released is the biggest drop in subs?
---
thanks for sharing that insight. 
---
if i may ask: whats your profession/ what do you do/what are your daily tasks?
---
completely offtopic, just curious.
---
I know staysafe and tipsout want to go for rank 14. Not sure about anyone else. Asmon has stated he wont go for it.
---
3440x1440 21:9 aspect ratio by any cance?? I would loveeeee this
---
She was a Night Elf once before they moved to Eastern Kingdoms and made the Sunwell, which mutated High Elves.
---
I think the one true meme spec is moonkin. Shadow isn't as wanted as holy but I'm sure you could find a guild that would take you.
---
According to ClassicDB it deals 147-170 dmg. Add in some armor and some buffs from a raid, it doesn't seem that out of place.
---
i reacently remembered that wow is free up to lvl 20 so i am having my own classic beta by playing all the classes i want to see how their combat is in retail and maybe trim something down from 5 to maybe 3
---
Thats so stupid though and makes the game boring, so you want 99% of players just to play rogue? why not balance all the other specs and the hybrids too so an enhancement shaman is almost as decent as rogue or something. put way more variety into the game
---
Wholesome!
---
Not sure if this is a simple question, but do you think there is any point in playing classic if you only have like an hour a day to play?
---
I think LFG could work if they re-do Wrath, but it needs changes.
---
1. Only for levels 15-60, or 15-70, old content. Keep the current content in the RPG world, on your server.
---
2. Keep a small pool of servers for queues. 2-3 servers, not 50, where you will never meet somebody from your server.
---
3. Limit the crazy XP boost they give, so the best way to level isnt sitting in Stormwind from 15-60.
---
That's a great mindset to have and it sounds like you're going to have a blast with classic, friend. One question though - Alliance or Horde? I promise it wont change my sentiments towards you ;)
---
You're welcome. If you are confused about how layering works, I would refer to my reply above this (I think it's pretty concise).  
---
I study computer science and work as a part-time software developer :)
---
Nope the white one is 100% and the blue one 60% why ?
---
Fishing in an area above your skill level lowers your chance to succeed significantly. You can still put your bobber in the water and wait the full channel but you'll almost always get a failure notification afterwards.  Buying lures of various strength can help you reach the minimum requirements to fish in an area until you don't need them anymore to almost always succeed at a fishing attempt. 
---
The mining question is up to you. It's not necessarily required but it does make you more independent. The bigger time sink is getting all of the Sulfuron Ingots from a boss in MC.
---
Nowhere is safe
---
this was fun back in the day especially when you would get those whispers from people flaming at your for camping them all night haha fun times
---
I wasn't shitting on Blizzard, I was asking a question.  Some issues they already responded to. If you think everyone is shitting on Blizzard, maybe it is because you misihterpret everyones comments. That animosity to Blizzard came from you, NOT me.  You added it where it previously did not exist.
---

I'm sorry if it still doesn't work but there are 90-100 viewers 24/7. Sorry to say it but, it must be something locally on your computer/phone... Have you tried opening the sheet on an alternative computer?

Was talking about normal, hc and mythic difficulties
---
I was a QA Tester at BioWare before and you almost never include an expectation in your bug reports. It's not your job to write out expectations as you're not a designer. You're a tester. What you expect isn't important, you simply find what's wrong and explain/show why it's wrong.
---
Havnt seen much of the beta but I'm sure you are right, it did exist though
---
Barman
---
Depends on what ur other choices are but usually i'd say yes, because of the social aspect in the game.
---
Can someone just real quick fill me in, whats up with all memes with him? Totally out of the loop
---
We won the dragon wars on Emerald Dream.  Wiped the horde guild, pulled and killed the dragon.  This happened multiple times.  Their entire guild server transferred to get away from us.
---
In the long run it was a bad thing, because rivalries are good and fun, and there was no one that stood up to take their place.
---
pve servers never went away
---
That's what everyone thought. Star Wars?! Must be good! Combined with BioWare, the 'RPG-king' (I mean making an MMORPG is just upscaling an RPG, right?)?! A slam dunk!!
---
No, a Star Wars MMO will never work. My gut feeling back then told me that it wouldn't work. But my hopeful self convinced me otherwise. Also there was this podcast, don't recall the name, that frequently posted updates on SW:TOR development. One thing one shouldn't do is listen to the opinion of Star Wars fans, that basically wanted an MMO version of their beloved KOTOR, on if their MMO will be good.
---
I believe SW:TOR was released during Cataclysm, which was the time lots of WoW players had quit, myself included. So I don't blame anyone that wanted to believe SW:TOR being the WoW replacement. People believed so hard that anyone that voiced scepticism was ran into the ground (even some investor that apparently pulled out before the launch of the game).
---
my daughter said im not allowed to say omar

I believe it's not....though I'm sure you can 'acquire' it for free in certain means....  
---
If you want to listen to the audiobook though, at least pay for the reader's work....or read it yourself &gt;.&lt;  
---
The site only gives PDF, HTML or ePub versions of the book....maybe you can copy it into a thingie, you know the computer generated voice thingies? like what google translate uses. That can read it up for you for free. :D
---
Sounds like someone hasn't seen the original Sylvanas model.

Oof, not sure how to do that. I've only got the screenshots of ingame for 2560x1440. :( Don't think it's possible, I'd have to go take new screenshots from the same position. (This was a combination of like 12 screenshots to catch it all like that)
---
Is Thunderfury BiS for Furry warriors?
---
yur not wrong, we are getting 2006 post-nerf dungeons at launch and for some reason everyone is cool with being able to face tank aoe-cleave every elite pack in every dungeon with greens and zero cc for epics like its bfa
---
Does moving so much while fighting do anything? It's so hard to watch
---
is ion in this group ? i cant remember if he was apart of the world first just know he did the math on the fight
---
May i suggest some youtube videos on the subject?  
---
I tend to now and again go back to preachers old vids and look through them since i really enjoy his back then look back on vanilla. I love story time videos on the subject and i could be worth giving it a try?

---
These are just some that comes to mind right now, would love to hear about more creators so i to got something to do in the wait for classic
---
wait you really think soul link locks need to be stronger? its hard to take this seriously if you think the best 1v1 class in the game needs a buff
---
I played Dalaran, PvE from early vanilla all the way through WoTLK and it was always high pop, and is full now. I think there was a hearty segment of the population on both PvP and PvE servers.
---
True, you can almost make a U.S minimum wage farming some MMOs these days. If you know what you're doing.
---
Ye, im pretty sure they are suppose to hit for atleast twice their current damage, which would be 80-90 a hit, currently asmongold is hitting for 120 white and the 30 elite hits him for 40-45.. seems pretty low.
---
Omar is going to be a hot name when the name reservation opens up on the 13th...
---
Love these, keep em coming
---
&gt; Getting your first couple greens is a big deal and feels rewarding
---
I'm just looking forward to playing a game where you can set gear goals and actually meet them without having to deal with titanforging BS.
---
It's not a troll, you can go to his VoD's and see.
---
Who tf is Omar?
---
Totally agree.
---
And let me know what server that is so I can avoid it.
---
Yeah I'm not saying you're wrong
---
Add-ons that were made for vanilla won't work in classic. It will be up to add-on authors to make equivalents for the modern version. 
---
Since you mentioned UI specifically, anyone who enjoys the popular add-on "Pfui" on P-servers should know the author has no intentions of porting it to classic at this time.
---
well you can always buy the sulfuron ingots, so you could argue gold farming could be the best option to cancel out that grind time.
---
Pretty good quality of life update that doesnt affect the game much, wouldnt change that imo
---
Oh good eye, didnt notice that at all! i also have not played wow retail since wrath lol
---
You'd be surprised. I can 100% confirm the cripple spell applied to raid bosses without an immune message and said raid bosses had cripple in their debuff bar. I am _pretty sure_ they where affected by the AS debuff but I am not _certain_. This is due to a lack of testing data.
---
Please realize, nobody wanted to use Infernal or Doomguard. There was a ton of pushback against their use. Infernal wasn't usable indoors. Doomguard was only accessed via ritual of doom or Curse of Doom. Curse wasn't a viable option in raid settings.
---
Know what people said about ritual of doom? "I don't want to take durability damage." I am 95%+ sure that it did _not_ do durability damage as a special exception.
---
There was a _ton_ of misinformation about Doomguard. I literally made my warlock alt because of it! I saw so much rumor mongering but no hard data. I had never seen a doomguard or a warlock that was willing to use it. That drove me to level my own and see it for myself!
---
Please realize that classic WoW was 2004-2007ish. Thus **it did not have Discord or Reddit**. Reddit was founded in 2005 and it took awhile to get popular. The initial community tools for sharing information were not the same as they are now. A lot of discussion occurred on the *battlenet forums*. I'll let you imagine how productive that was.
---
Furthermore, classic WoW was very dominated by Everquest veterans and certain mentalities around raiding/raiding guilds. Not just players but also Blizzard design philosophy. There is a ton of stuff that's just useless in classic WoW. Also a ton of examples of stuff along the lines of "Warrior tanks work well. We use warriors to tank. Sorry Druid, if want to tank, grind a warrior alt up. Otherwise put on the dress and spam heals."
---
Want to know what people are like? Current example: Yuumi in League of Legends. Just released new champ with about 30% win rate; which is atrocious. Yuumi got hotfixed and is in a better state. However, the community perception that she is bad is already fixed and thus many people dodge/whine instead of re-assessing. Her winrate is going to be artificially and *slightly* reduced *because* of that community perception. Players will tilt themselves because a yuumi is on their team and play worse. This is pattern video game communities show.
---
Doomguard was avoided because "Everyone knew Doomguard wasn't worth using". However, how many people actually *tested it*? Way way way way way less then you'd think. Nobody cared and they were completing content fine without the hassle.
---
Yes there are modern MMOs in development that have a design philosophy that is similar to MMOs from the 1999-2005 era. I mentioned two of them above: Pantheon (a spiritual successor to EverQuest), and Camelot Unchained (a spiritual successor to Dark Age of Camelot).
---
I think the excitement for these games is at least partially responsible for Classic WoW and Blizzard is going to have to consider if they're going to develop their spiritual successor to World of Warcraft.
---
Short answer, yes, you will definitely want raiding gear especially for casters, the MC loot doesn't have the best DPS stats but will increase your survivability and you can usually snag a Anathema after a couple of the main Holy Priests get their Benedictions.   
---
Rank 14 is a no lifer goal if you look at it, 3-4 months of continous daily grinding some suggest 16 hours a day and many complain this will only be done by shared accounts. This is a bit outdated way of thinking, in truth you will spend all of your time pvping to achieve this but it is doable but you really cannot afford to stray away from at least 6-8 hours of continuous pvp and creating premades to secure faster honor while completing BGs. It gets very political to my experience once you break rank 12. This however was back when smaller servers would only have 1 rank14 a week the larger population servers can have 3-4 if im not mistaken.  
---
As for getting steamrolled, SPriest with Warlords and an Anathema in WSG is one of the meanest classes to run into once they grab the Berserking buff. Prior to having the SP and stam to support this you wont be as squishy as other classes since you have Shadowform or SL/SL but you are a clothie and thus a target for a lot of people to zerg down.
---
I played during vanilla on my dads account, 21 now. My highest was a 40 hunter before Wotlk, then i had an 80 DK and Druid.
---
Legion DDOSing was horrible... I remember how many times Lizard Squad (Think that's what they're called?) took down blizz servers almost daily for a bit.
---
&gt; Is wow classic meant only for veterans
---
This is a weird statement. Why would classic be meant only for veterans?  
---
I think classic is meant for anyone that would like to play an actual MMOrpg.
---
Seems some invites went out, a few on my discord just got in.
---
I'm sorry for anyone who would rob themselves of the experience of a classic PVP server. It may be more frustrating at times, but it's also just insanely fun.
---
Well, what're you gonna do about it oldy? \*runs in circles around u/Animoose hanging over his walker\*
---
I'm 20, my first experience with WoW was in 2007 when i was like 8 years old, I'm pretty young but I definitely have crazy nostalgia for the old world, the tanaris speedway was my favorite place and they destroyed it :(
---
Naw Kevin Ly. He didn’t have a native first name either. I knew a Mark Wang who’s real name was Xa Lin Wang though. Kid was a total ass.
---
Kevin’s parents owned a Chinese restaurant though and were immigrants with broken English. Great people. They always had a chili tree in their kitchen and their house always smell foreign if that’s a thing.
---
This is actually a genuinely good drawing!
---
Gocha. How does the level 60 gear for PvP rewards compare to BiS PvE gear in terms of how good the items are?
---
Oh shit that's a good idea, I've never done the whole campaign
---
Yeah so far no one from the EU had a shot at it, just a big fu from blizzard.   At least the game releases worldwide and not 2 and a half month later.
---
Don’t think I’ve ever seen an undead warrior
---
If I want 400 herbs for alchemy, I don't want to gamble on getting 17 in 40 minutes. losing 40 in 4 hours, getting 9 in 6 hours, then losing out on 200 in 12 hours beause I was asleep and couldn't re-bid
---
I want to make a ton of potions now.
---
Sorry, what is SL? Interested noob here
---
I love the Donkey Kong Country music you use in your vids.  One of my favorite games of all time specifically because of the soundtrack.  [Stickerbush Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67nkzoJ_2M) remains my favorite game track of all time.
---
"The username is already taken"
---
i meant to ask for the final release
---
I have way too less insight to give you an accurate answer to this one I'm afraid.
---
Been thinking about some of the differences we'll see between the original and the rerelease - some in Blizzard's control, and some not. Thought it would be interesting to rank them &amp; share my personal list!
---
[Here you go.](https://gear.blizzard.com/eu/game/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-15th-anniversary-collector-s-edition-eu)
---
While I agree PvE is generally the more popular server type in almost all MMO's, and has been since I've paid attention to such things. 
---
If you want an immersive world not a lobby game playing on a PvE server sort of dulls the shine of classic.
---
It's much closer to a lobby game on a PvE server, and all the complaints people have about modern MMO's in general. World doesn't feel alive
---
While I'm not sure PvP will be the more popular server type. Certainly it's going to be a much more server type than it was.
---
But if you're one fo those guys who was just trying to level a few hours a week and getting crapped on by 60s in redridge I can understand why you're excited.  P servers were not kind to people with little time hahah
---
Upvote for “Tips is an idiot”. Well said.
---
When BG's get released you'll just hear a whining noise, that'll be the gimped warriors boohooing for heals. Then you'll encounter your first premade and they shitstomp you in the middle of the BG and then proceed to 3 cap you while GY camping.   
---
That's when you learn to start shouting for BG's and hopefully making a premade yourself so you can dictate roles, have a balanced core and lead them to hopeful victory.
---
Is there a guild recruitment sub? I'm interested in finding a new playgroup since mine is basically dead.
---
Wait... is that the Blizz employee Furor?
---
Ok well it may have been in the game very early on but it certainly wasn't a thing in 1.12.  Battleshout does 0 threat.
---
haha i remember Playing AV and going to bed and joining the same AV when i woke up
---
Haha, dutch too?
---
But is it a grinding check or a skill check though? i can handle a rough grind, but who knows if i'll be good enough for a high level skill check.
---
What do you do once you hit 60? I've never raided before, I really just enjoyed questing and world-pvp as a kid. I'm thinking of going warlock or hunter. Do I just look for a raiding guild once i'm 60 looking for my class and go from there? I would like to clear some end game content but I have no experience tbh.
---
I bet Monkeynews will get R14 before all other streamers.
---
I've played on PvP servers the past 4 years.
---
I fucking hate them.
---
Literally the only difference between PvP and PvE servers is ganking. How does not getting ganked make vanilla "a lobby game" ?
---
Shoo, lowbie ganking UD rogue.
---
i dont know about the world mobs but looks like were getting 2006 post-nerf dungeons at launch and for some reason everyone is cool with being able to face tank aoe-cleave every elite pack in every dungeon with greens and zero cc for epics like its bfa
---
he's actually like, really cute
---
And then you will burn out and won't enjoy the actual game, what a plan!
---
&gt;That was changed in TBC.
---
&gt;Patch 1.4.0 Combo points will no longer be removed if the target is deselected. They will only be removed if a different target is selected.
---
&gt;Patch 2.0.3 Combo points added to a target should not be reset until you add a combo point to a different target.
---
I think this will work fine if you're selling material stacks. For low level greens, you're better off disenchanting and then auctioning the stacks. 
---
If a buyer is going to need multiple stacks of something, or even if they're not in a rush to get the item, it is worth it for them to throw a bid or two on something cheaper. As the seller, you're pretty much always going to end up losing out on some money, but as you said, you'll be saving time as well. 
---
I'd start paying attention at later levels, though. You'll likely start taking a more noticeable hit on level 40+ stuff.
---
suppose it depends on what class you play and how much you think you can make in a certain amount of time. If you're to the point where you're willing to buy the Ingots, then you're probably going to be ok with buying all of the other, less rare, materials. 
---
I just never count on ingots being readily available since guilds usually have someone they want to give them to meaning the only other source would be from someone who got it in a PUG who doesn't want it for themselves.
---
I'm looking forward to it, too! We have 4 kids: 10, 7 (at the time of release), 3, and 2. My older two have always been curious about the game we play. And I think the pace of Classic might be great as a way to let them check out the game. I was still in high school when Vanilla released, so I guess I'll probably have the same amount of time to devote to it, mostly at the end of the day!
---
Going to enjoy the fuck out of it for the 4th time
---
The return of green jesus
---
Sadly that is the nature of it, Ontop of not many wish to play the devils advocate.  If something is already up or down voted, People’s opinions change, even if their original thought was different. (Not saying votes count, they really don’t. But it sways people - that’s just built into us)
---
I don’t blame people for it though, it’s possible to take it that way (though I feel the last two paragraphs kind of showed I didn’t, I legit meant I usually can’t tell a bug, it’s good I didn’t get in because of that!) 
---
This sub also has a lot of anger going on at the moment, so I understand people bandwagoning and jumping on people at the moment.  Hopefully it will cool down soon though.
---
I see the opposite to be honest.
---
Didn't they get rid of PVP servers on retail lol?
---
that makes sense, i intend to get the more common mats through grinding or just as the guild gets them during clears.  
---
i'll just save as much gold as i can and keep my eyes peeled on the AH. worst case scenario i just have to wait for all 8 to drop.
---
Back pedal more, bye.
---
Oh shit, my bad lol
---
Hey, thanks! I appreciate your efforts ^_^
---
Oh, good find. Okay, I never realized this. Thanks for posting this.
---
Yeah because pve servers are just not as fun as pvp.
---
Awesome ty!
---
i don't give a damn about the numbers being exact. I just want to get out in the world, meet people, join a guild, meet a girl, fly out to hook up with her in amsterdam, discover she has a boyfriend, beg her to leave him, get reported to the dutch police for stalking and be deported back to belarus just like it was in vanilla
---
BFA is Running on my 10 year old desktop just fine
---
What do you mean exactly? That some are getting invited without a sub?
---
No Just a wave prob. Hapoen
---
Yeah the issue with the OG vanilla client is that it was engineered for hardware projections that didn't pan out. In the mid 2000s Moore's law still hadn't reached its ceiling and everybody was expecting 6ghz processors to hit the market by late 2008.
---
Which never panned out because it turned out silicone chips couldn't be pushed to those clock frequencies without some pretty serious cooling. Like, liquid nitrogen serious.
---
Up until the very recent past video games were engineered around single CPU core computation. It's still not the standard today, more than a decade since the first consumer grade multi-core CPUs hit the market.
---
The vanilla client will run just fine on modern hardware - up until the point when you put some load on the CPU. Like when you're doing 40 man raiding. Or raid vs. raid PvP. Then it starts to chug hard.
---
Hey buddy, I think you're forgetting that wow is part of a company and it's one of their major products they've been relying on for years.  You may hate BFA and all the people who are still subscribed and playing BFA, but I can assure you Blizzard doesn't think that way.  Imagine you sign up to go on a brand new cruise ship.  The cruise ship company has a bunch of loyal customers who have been going on their cruises for years so they let them tour the new cruise ship the day before, however they decide to let new customers go on the tour for a small fee if they want to.  That's what this is like.  They're giving a little kick back to all the people who have stayed subbed to wow.  I haven't played wow since the middle of legion and I can totally understand why blizzard would do that. You may think classic is all that matters.  Blizzard still cares very much about the BFA players.
---
No, it was confirmed to be working as intended, but for some reason warriors have way higher HP regen out of combat than other classes, which was nerfed in TBC.
---
Its not bugged, its just really high
---
even that's a bit young you happy cockmongling negro you
---
Just do the dun morogh skip. There's an inlet behind the mountains you can die in. You spawn at the sprit healer outside iron forge and you just rez there :-)
---
I have to give credit to PPF(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCohllq0Pk5lQuuNANabHKcg). He has a bunch of old school mixes actually, and he's kind enough to allow me to use them. He actually has a cover of that song specifically. It's quite good!
---
I mean dueling events or 80v80 were really,really rare in Vanilla.
---
Your first tasks, in general are: epic mount gold, profession leveling, dungeon gear, pvp.
---
Ultimately, people find fun pvping, making gold, and killing bosses. There are more niche things like making endless alts, reputation grinding, rping...
---
But mostly you hit level spend 1-3 months getting your blue gear, mount and professions going, all while killing the opposite faction—cause it’s fun.
---
Then you’re killing dragons, but really you’re there to get the purples to make gold quicker, to kill opposite faction easier. 
---
At least that’s my vanilla, it’s a big competition over scarce world resources.
---
Thanks! I will take a look. You got me pretty excited.
---
So I'm torn between a Warrior and a Rogue for release. I want to mostly do dungeons and raids, with the option for outside solo-work and utility.  Rogues appeal to me for CC and overworld shenanigans, as well as reliable, safe DPS, and Warriors appeal to me because they are excellent damage and can tank the best.
---
Which class is more desirable? I know they're both going to be very overpopulated but I'd rather choose the lesser of two evils.
---
There's a death skip you can do (at least on private realms, not sure it was in retail) where you swim south from menethil and drown, when you release you'll be at a graveyard in Dun Morogh
---
Our lord and saviour
---
Quick Google check and this turns out to be fake
---
I wish I could move into Omar's house.
---
Just spec retri for leveling. Save some of the intellect/spirit gear you come across while questing. You can perfectly heal dungeons wearing that at the appropriate levels. Also save a 1-hand and shield, with an OK group that gives you a min to aggro, you might even be able to tank.
---
It is additive, but base stun resist may be 5%.
---
I believe it is additive... i.e., they resist a lot.
---
Its really weird how mentally dishonest people get about older games. I'm of the mindset that 'good games are simply good games' regardless of age. Sure the graphics might not age AS well as some (lots of N64 games) but even then, graphics are only the toppings of a good dish, not the dish itself.
---
Feelsbadman.
---
"additional" means additive. Base + 25%
---
Because ganking a 40 man raid with 15 guys and wiping their buffs is one of the most fulfiling things you can do in any MMO?
---
Fighting over tidal charm?
---
Devilsaur? Black lotus? World bosses? 
---
Like I said if you don't have time and are constantly behind the curve. Not liking a PvP server makes sense no matter how good you are....
---
But if you ahve the time PvP servers are BY FAR the superior way to play
---
The fact you think the only thing you can do is gank pretty much says it all...lol. I love PvP, it's BM to kill anyone below 60 unless you want that honor. Why would I? 
---
The beauty of Wpvp is it's a fairer fight. 10 on 10 my team is always going to win. 15 on 40 that is not a guarantee at all. Or 3 on 5
---
Honestly that's wholesome as fuck.
---
Swifty said he wanted to go for it.
---
Depends on what kind of fur.
---
Which it does precisely because it's engineered with multi-core CPUs in mind, which the 2006 client never was...
---
And by the looks of it, the Classic client does not have the multi-threading optimizations that the BfA client recently received, which there could be a thousand reasons why that is.
---
Cool! I was actually asking because I knew a Chinese girl from Pittsburgh who had a brother, so I thought, "could it be...?"
---
&gt; their house always smell foreign if that’s a thing
---
I know what you mean, but tbh I think everyone's house but mine smells foreign lol
---
I miss the days on Darkspear-US when people would come to kill Thrall and we would all pile in to wipe them. So many great defenses crying "Lok'tar Ogar!" "For the Horde!" and "For Thrall!". I hope these days come again.
---
Shoutout to any members of &lt;imba&gt; on Kor'gall EU! Hoping to see some of you again in Classic.
---
meh i think they should test without being asked thats why they are there
---
I agree, but will say it a bit differently.
---
Cat brings: + crit chance for other melee, really deserved innervate for priest, and sometimes usefull combat res. Ther aren't worthless, just easily replaced when pushing only for max dps. When you are familiar with tactics, trying just to mindlessly burn down each boss isn't only and best way to go.
---
You need focused raid containing good players to fit a feral player into their group. It's easier to get another rogue, or warrior instead of him. Most cat druids appeared during endgame content, when players trusted each other, and valuable AQ loot boosted ferals.
---

[Just a little bit longer, my friend...](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19394/drake-talon-pauldrons)
---
Vanilla wow is actually the only version of WoW that supports 50/50 server balance, as soon as we get into TBC we get faction servers (horde servers, more realistically) with 80/20 imbalance. 
---
no other version of the game works with 50/50 balance due to tiny miniscule continents, flying and fuck two faction capitals. And this is why every version of WoW besides vanilla WoW is absolute fucking garbage.
---
TBC is the beginning of the downfall
---
preaching to the choir~
---
Haha I could see that. Maybe I’m more use to my parents house. It’s either doesn’t smell at all or it smells like they just cleaned it or had some scent thing going. My house smells like an older house. Not damp or anything like that, but it has older wood floors and always has a smell when you first walk in for a minute or so then it goes away entirely.
---
Me too! I love giving in vanilla, thinga have so much value. I always farm alot of gold and seeing peoples reactions if I help them is honestly one of the best feelings. 
---
On the big pservers I used to give portals a few golds and some bags to newbies on their way to SW and damn if I didn’t make their day, and they made mine :)
---
Also, once I was so bored I bought a pendulum of doom and enchanted it with crusader then gave it to a random 39 warr, that boy was happy lemme tell you :D
---
You say that, but there's plenty of precendence with blizzard letting people keep progress after beta.
---
“Enjoying your stay in Stormwind?”
---
“Have you heard any news about my father?”
---
Just faceroll occasionally.
---
Allakhazam was my jam.
---
On private servers, they sure do! It's horrifying to think that is correct.
---
It's infectious. :)
---
Never really watched him before, but just found his vids on YT. Is he really clueless?
---
/u/mightyicefoe you a legend my friend, the attention to detail is amazing.
---
I only resubbed to retail to bide time until classic.
---
You're right, the wording really does make it sound like additive. Is there any other skill with the same working that for sure is additive as proof though?
---
You deserve more upvotes!!
---
What I don't get is the resentment people have for classic. I could always theorize though... looking at the official forums you see a LOT of resentment for something as simple as gear structure or a semblance of effort vs reward. Which is a weird thing to think about given the genre of game, especially when they consider all the changes taking away both the MMO and RPG part as 'improvements'. Its hard to take that all seriously, and maybe I shouldn't. But I haven't seen this kind of resentment about a retro release or a remake in a LONG time. Maybe it represents everything these people hated about WoW? Or represents the player they hate? At this point I'm only guessing, but their reaction in the future will definitely be interesting to keep up with.
---
fucking xfire man
---
True. I want to know more about his professional career before and during his years ago Blizzard. He's been there forever and that's quite rare in our industry (software engineering). 
---
I definitely have a handful of questions almost entirely unrelated to Classic.
---
The shaman jumping above (?) is what we can look forward to in classic. T2 gloves and a blue leather helm from Moam because it has good stats, and to top it off a robe. I mained a tauren shaman aswell and had more leather then mail, and it was awesome!
---
Is feral really the only VIABLE spec to lvl up a druid?
---
I had a crush on a female night elf rogue once. Turned out to be a chinese goldseller. I wonder if he could have made me happy
---
I started in '04 but admittedly have forgotten quite a bit. 
---
The Pserver crowd seems to be toxic and more likely to act as gatekeepers imo.
---
Thank fuck OCE servers won’t have any big streamers so we don’t have to worry about any of our servers ! And gonna be so good to play on 10 ms this time around rather then 250ms haha
---
Why are the names all messed up? Noticed this on my old toons as well
---
Doubt he's looking for roommates at this point in his life. You might have missed the boat on that one my friend :/
---
Addons won't dictate invites, the demand will at first be the right level or class. While leveling groups don't rely too heavily on CC especially early on. More so the group will be hoping to get less competition to the armor type, (nothing is worse than running WC with Druidx2 Roguex3) but we know that its unavoidable as well as selfish trying to isolate your class's armor for yourself but people still do it. Really though at the end of the day most dungeons will have a 1 clear limit unless you are trying to twink out, before turning in all the quests and moving on. Dungeons especially when you are gearing out pre raid BiS will mostly be done internally with a Guild only run. The Pug experience after reaching 60 will more or less be less punishing though than people imagine that play on live where they try to demand a specific GS or iLvl w/e. I think that from experience i would shout to guildies if they have friends that wanna come feel free to let me know prior to shouting and after trying to recruit i'm looking for the best class to fill a role. Some will link an epic or other item trying to display their gear but i find that kind of humble bragging and ignore them tbh.
---
So spam wing clip to proc the Ravager spin as often as possible? What levels does that work up to? Sorry for the quiz I'm just at work and curious
---
Oh I agree. I just wanted to mention one major reason as to why Blizzard isn't re-doing the visuals.
---
Gold farm on retail to get tokens and also have access to classic, maybe.
---
Imagine being this dense.
---
Am I the only one seeing a sexy lady?
---
this brings back memory's of doodling game maps in class back in the day trying to figure out good strats for raids lol ....would draw where to stack were to hold mobs and everything ...so much good stuff here
---
It is technically possible.
---
Caperfin wrote a very elaborate guide on it. You need to be dedicated though. This guide and playstyle is definitely not for casuals like me.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guide=7995/comprehensive-guide-to-shaman-tanking
---
I love classic but sometimes this community is the spergiest most unreast people ever when it comes to the game. 
---
Sigh... Oh well. There will be plenty of dope people for you to meet in game!
---
Seems like you don't remember Stavlan, Defias, or the myriad of other lengthy questlines you could do in Vanilla.
---
Amazing drawing 😍
---
Maybe, MAAAAYBE 22 may, stress test time = more Beta invites.
---
but is he looking for a son?
---
It's exactly the same as warrior and priest talents. It's additive. This is not confusing or guesswork. That's how it was in vanilla, how it is in beta, and how it'll be in Classic.
---
That's a damn good question for the AMA! Let's hope he sees this and all of your dreams come true.
---
was definately a thing in vanilla, maybe not in patch 1.12 but we killed nerfarion way before that.
---
And most classes had insane rewards for the class-quest.
---
your welcome :P Well, if you are going to level up to 35, might as well level a paladin or warlock to 40 that have free mount. Its 60% mount speed vs 40% travel form. And since in Vanilla gathering resources are not dense, and sometimes you travel a lot to find another herb, 60% mount will make a difference.
---
On the other hand Druid also have aquatic form which is very good to farm stranglekelp (these always sell good).
---
If you plan to play a druid. Go to IF/SW after you learn Teleport Moonglade and you can keep your hearthstone in the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Quick someone make a Bolvar Gonzalez
---
Back in high school I was only allowed to play an hour a day, still enjoyed the game. Can’t do endgame content tho
---
Why would staysafe go for 14? Given his stated goals for classic he would be better off staying at 13 and letting someone else in his guild get 14.
---
You could level as anything. Feral is just the quickest and easiest.
---
Nice vid as always. I'm def avoiding streamer's servers
---
ya, it just comes down to how you want to spend your time. General farming to pay a premium for the convenience of not having to level mining vs targeted material farming along with profession leveling to lower your personal costs. 
---
You could argue that the time spent leveling mining could be spent farming at lv60 in which case it's easier to compare the value you're getting from whichever choice you make. 
---
If you want to be a blacksmith, ya, go ahead and take mining. Otherwise I feel like you'd need a better reason than crafting dark iron bars and collecting arcane crystals to warrant the profession.
---
These icons for the classes and races crack me up.
---
Would also love to reconnect with some old friends who I've lost contact with over the years. Mind sharing that site you used?
---
It means the name is no longer available, when you login you will have to choose a new name.
---
The whole point of the work done to get the old game working in the new client is, I'd imagine, to allow for the classic client to be updated roughly in line with the main bfa client in terms of core functionality.
---
I'd be very suprised if classic doesn't get all of these improvements in time, and probably will just lag behind the bfa main client by a few months or less.
---
Best thing to do is probably to get ahead in school/work and fitness haha.
---
Personally, that is my plan. I have a big thing due in November/December and trying to get it as done as possible before launch.
---
In my off time I watch streams and dream about my character. Trying some stuff on pserver too.
---
i think they should add him as a Lore keeper or possibly to the lunar festival
---
Nice, defeating these raid bosses for the first (and sometimes second, third) times in vanilla was such a unique experience. While I don't think it will be the same experience, it should be pretty satisfying to revisit after all this time.
---
How does that interact with troll racials? They get 10% Regen and then 10% in combat?
---
So other than feral, everything else is slow and painfully hard? (compared to that spec)
---
Even mine? =[
---
(just kidding I don't plan on streaming)
---
my current plan is do use mining/herbalism for required mats/money, then drop herbalism for blacksmithing so i can make the hammer myself. (trust no one).
---
Opinion?
---
Balance can be done fine, you just need to constantly get water off mages or buy water. It's not as good but it's perfectly viable, it won't be dramatically slower.
---
Undead Warrior lets goooooooo
---
And of course, the pinnacle of PVP trinkets - Tidal Charm - drops from the Naga prince of the coast of Arathi Highlands.
---
Not expecting them to do the same dmg but the difference is big. It is not like there it is easy to find videos of lvl 30 content from back then. Btw the pet probably has more armor than the warrior and the last hit the panther does on a leather wearing hunter is for 138. Hoping to talk a streamer into doing the panther quest at some point. That would actually be worth alot. Are you not at all curious if Blizz got it right?
---
I mean... Get a trinket, iron grenades, tidal trinket, rogues are only faceroll vs noobs. Most arent hard to beat.
---
He is The Godfather of classic wow
---
Well if you're willing to tank warrior becomes the most desirable class in the game for dungeon 10 through to 60.    
---
It's pretty rare that anyone really is looking for a rogue in any group situation.
---
Please tell me this isn't going to be another "God Ash" scenario.
---
Considering he played the game for probably longer than you ever did, his opinion has more relevancy than yours ever will and that makes you mad doesn't it.
---
Rank 13/14 is just who can play the most.
---
they're going to keep the low poly?
---
I’m 20, I played WoW when my older brother who’s eight years older than me got it which was in vanilla. I remember loving it but also not knowing shit but that didn’t stop me from enjoying it. I never got to level 60 until wrath and I didn’t max out until cats but I’ve been playing since then. I’ve gone and done some classic servers because I wanted to re experience it. I’m in the same boat where I’m very excited to play my favorite game properly.
---
that’s a valid point I didn’t think of, pricing in a way that deters that type of behaviour.
---
Back when if you hit people with skills it actually did damage. None of this dampening shit where none of your skills put even a dent in their healthbar.
---
Goddamnit it's so good.
---
However pfui is made to be an "ElvUI for vanilla" and the author of ElvUI plans on releasing it for classic.
---
That's pretty cool. Do you need the 100% speed mount to get there?
---
I'm in and in EU??
---
BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE
---
I’ve never used one and never felt the need for one either. 
---
 Most quests tell you where to go or what to do even though some are a little vague. If you can’t find a spot on your map then you still have some exploring to do I guess.
---
Dude I'd totally play WoW with graphics like that.
---
People were doing it on private servers at 60. Yeah, I assume you run into a pack, hit Raptor Strike, then spam Wing Clip until it procs. 
---
I'm pretty sure it won't be viable on Classic; seems like a pserver meme build lol.
---
It won't overlap with some other games I want to play and leaves more of the summer for summer activities. Also if last year's endless heatwave is anything to go by it will be bit more tolerable temperatures by then.
---
That looks really nice actually wow
---
With Linux, WoW works good with DXVK but not really without. Your machine doesn't support Vulkan so it looks quite bad.
---
What games have Blizzard let you keep progression after beta is over?
---
Let alone, what World of Warcraft beta has ever let you keep progress after it's over?
---
ok, thank you.
---
www.vanillafriends.com
---
You need help.
---
Yeah?
---
I’m excited to play mainly because no games out will do class based holy trinity mmorpg like Classic. All games have shifted towards this weird all classes can do anything method. I can’t wait to place just a healer.
---
There's essentially no skill check.
---
My condolences on choosing a night elf. I’m sure you will make the right choice this time around. :)
---
Was a hunter ran that dungeon for a week straight without it dropping, the one time we bring my best friends brother, who I didn’t like, he rolls need and out rolls me.
---
&gt;it won't be dramatically slower
---
Besides a lot of downtime, its sounds actually cool! (also you have 2 armor types to choose from)
---
Do you not see the irony in this post?
---
I noticed something interesting in this video.
---
[https://youtu.be/ZvwYpFp1q38?t=30](https://youtu.be/ZvwYpFp1q38?t=30)
---
John Hight says "We're not done with WoW Classic. Ask me again in Summer 2019."
---
The interview is from 2018 Blizzcon.
---
People are going to take this seriously despite him saying an hour before that a majority of people on beta aren't streamers.
---
It does in the lore.
---
&gt;But the Lightforged are functionally immortal beings. They are no longer touched by age.
---
https://blizzardwatch.com/2018/02/23/know-lore-lightforged-draenei/
---
I seem to remember that the main stats of the Marshal/Warlord set are comparable to BWL level gear, but the items are lacking stats like hit rating, spirit, defense rating, resistance and other PvE focussed stats, which ultimately makes the gear inferior to high end PvE gear for raids.
---
The individual pieces are obviously perfect to fill a low level gear slot with during raids. I remember that I ran the best part of BWL having a few knight-captain gear pieces equipped on my Mage. Worked fine.
---
I like high density of grass, but I hate it's moving, and no way to disable it
---
This was actually pretty captivating. You are a great communicator.
---
Well, the better your premade, the faster it will be.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw
---
Watch this and you can calculate how long it will take you given a certain bracket.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/ATwC8PECwMQ](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/ATwC8PECwMQ)  this is what I need for leveling :P I go for remorseless attacks first, then Improved sinister, then Master of Deception and Camouflage, then Malice and continue to combat. I get riposte first, then precision.
---
I really miss precision early on, but I think other choices are better and more fun :P
---
You need to have an active sub to get selected for beta right?
---
[After seeing Tipsout play on the Beta I can't really believe it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjUACaUOxWE)
---
Started to notice this a few years back and it can’t be unseen. Talents, Grifts, bloodshards, ancient items... it’s almost if Diablo is the testing grounds for future WoW content.
---
Drawing?
---
Imagine believing that someone has a "little brain" because they think that someone playing a douchebag playing a video game is still probably just a douchebag. You're probably right, though. I'm sure the Venn diagram between people who enjoy watching a douchebag play a video game and people who aren't idiots is just a circle.
---
They didnt use version control in vanilla though, thats one of the big problems. They only have 1.12 data they found on an old backup. As you say, a lot of bugs is probably related to transpiling the old database data to the new database structure
---
Oh sweet
---
There will be many people like you playing it for the first time. If you’re into this sort of thing, there should be a ton of information available to help you get started, too. 
---
If you like mmos, I say try it out and see how you feel. You’ll only be out 15 bucks if you hate it.
---
Exactly this.
---
I won't spend the summer inside while it's as nice out
---
As a gnome you can fit inside chimneys of ruined houses, if you want to hide :)
---
Too many people post his stuff on here not realizing he’s being sarcastic
---
A lot of people are already wanting to avoid streamers and shit. Its great!
---
Blizz is supposedly looking at offering free xfers to allow people to get away from them.
---
Care to provide details on your account.    I am not making it up, if you browse twitch and look at all the people streaming classic, besides the very big streamers who were, for the most of them, in on wednesday or thursday, you will only see small NA streamers.   
---
I found an italian guy with a very small stream, I saw a few spanish speaking people but they might be NA, I might have seen a german one and that would be it, I see one in the few hundreds of viewers.   
---
If EU was getting as many invites as NA then you will see many more people in.    
---
So you are one the very few happy few. Did you get invited for many beta before?
---
Oh. Don't I look silly now :D
---
Was told I should look for a classic discord to join and now I’m super interested in meeting people to possibly play with when vanilla drops! Joined the EU discord I was linked and nobody in that discord was aware of an NA one. Can any of you smart people point me in the right direction? Maybe a guild recruitment thread or a discord for NA players. Much love
---
I don’t even have a toggle for ptr but I use to, anyone know why?
---
« Why you do on it on stream? ». Seriously. Remove the access to this dumbass. A beta is here to find bugs not to hide them. I’m glad you find it
---
I've never been in any *WoW* beta before this.
---
Not being cooked alive in my room while playing.
---
Something to remember is that these streamers are playing with thousands of hours of wow experience, they are following routes to optimise leveling, and have dozens of followers feeding them gold and items. Their experience is not going to be an average persons experience. 
---
He even has a paladin following him around everywhere making it 100times easier.
---
A new wow players experience trying to solo level a warrior is going to be extremely different.
---
I wonder if there’s a statistic showing how many people have been lifted out of poverty by the internet. A lot of times I see Americans my age talking about how the internet is so bad and ruining everyone’s life but I know that it’s helping the people that matter - the people that wouldn’t have had any other options. I just wonder how many.
---
Somewhat related, only 40% of people have access to the internet. I hope within my lifetime that number goes to 100.
---
I personally think her wrath of the lich king model would fit well enough. It’s not so detailed as to not fit in but it captures the way she looked in WC3 better.
---
No problem. Yeah, you can make the game exactly how it was in 2004. You can also customize your graphic settings and keep some modern features on but turn others off.
---
Entertainment is subjective. I find bug testing pretty entertaining, and they are still good entertainment.
---
This is not what I would call solid proof.
---
Absolutely not. When WoW first released 15 years ago, it was made for people who played WoW 15 years beforehand.  Sorry, veterans only.
---
I thought they fixed this? Maybe they just lessened the impact.
---
Anyway, in Legion there was a dungeon where a very popular skip (to the point where I would call it the normal route), involved crossing a small stream (? not sure if that's the right word for one that's artifical), if you didn't manage to jump over it as a female undead, you couldn't get up again.
---
I don't have the classic beta, but on classic beta streams you can see who chooses need and who chooses greed on items before the actual roll happens.
---
I don't think you could see that in vanilla. As far as I know you could only see what you chose.
---
Here's an example of someone only seeing what they chose on need/greed in vanilla.
---
https://youtu.be/_iZtw3WOw9I?t=588
---
24 hour day/night cycle is in the game, nights are pretty dark. Haven't seen rain yet
---
It is additive, I played two rogues in classic, both alliance. I spent my days avoiding orca like the plague until I got geared.
---
When did you first sub to wow, how long were you subbed? When did you resubed if you did? When did you get your invitation?
---
Will there be real ID in classic?
---
We know when this will be implemented? Or is it already?
---
made me laugh
---
It apparently requires a very high IQ to understand asmongold's sense of humor which is kind of sad.
---
Killing this back in vanilla was incredible. I think its going to be another great experience.
---
Selling "the pleb craves teh neckbeards power" narrative sounds good to an MMO player
---
Not to an executive who is managing a game dev's budget tho
---
So if you go inactive for a super long time, someone else can take your name? That sucks
---
I got Diablo 3 for free /w something. I had already finished the campaign before I discovered it wasn't a purely singleplayer game.
---
McConnell fucking spergs out everytime someone says "McCuck", its not a "character".
---
ReviewBrah is a character.
---
Asmon is just a douchr.
---
Lol!  Expect for the squad, I plan on playing solo for the most part like I did back then
---
They definitely know by now, every workplace has its share of people who keep abreast on what's the word online. This one is both too hard to miss and too good not to share with the guys
---
In terms of the first question, some of the gear is bis (or at least better than anything you had been able to get up until that point)
---
I'm pretty sure the gear you can get is based on highest achieved rank, not current rank.
---
Imagine being this big of a fanboy
---
Well yeah just like there's no proof you can get a mount at 40, or that a 1% crit talent gives you 1% crit, or blink moves you exactly 20 yards.    
---
People generally don't spend time testing stuff that they already know work.
---
I'm more interested in knowing how the hell you thought 'elf' was spelled as 'elve'
---
Hi, /u/ChristBKK
---
I think the current record for a speed run in vanilla is 4 days, 20 hours and 50ish minutes.
---
I think most folks will be in the 10-20 day range, there will probably be some people hitting it in about 5 days, and slow pokes like me in the 20-30 day range. (I was 36 days played over 6 months in vanilla to hit 60. Dinged 60 in strat. Incidentally I made sure to ding 80 in culling of strat lol)
---
It'll be interesting to see if anyone breaks that record or not.
---
Maybe it's not just about damage values, but hit points?  That possible?
---
How has he ever expressed self awareness? I throws a fit everytime anyone questions him.
---
You've never played WC3, clearly. She shows up early in the undead campaign as a High Elf.
---
Hey, so this might sound like a stupid question, and I promise you it is a stupid question, but it's going to sound like one too.
---
Is there really going to be a saturation of Warriors in vanilla? At 60?
---
I only ever got a Gnome Mage to level ~14ish during vanilla, then played a Blood Elf Paladin in BC. Never played on any private servers much so I didn't notice any class imbalances.
---
I really want to play a Dwarf Warrior (would love to tank), but I keep seeing things about how there are so many Fury/Arms Warriors in leveling + 60. How warriors are usually the first class to be excluded when a guild is recruiting. How the mobs in vanilla don't hit that hard and how it will be easier to level this time around (making leveling warriors easier I guess?)
---
Are there really going to be that many?
---
They definitely know by now, every workplace has its share of people who keep abreast of what's the word online. This one is both too hard to miss and too good not to share with the guys
---
36 year old vanilla vet here, checking in to say
---
I tell ya hwhat
---
interesting video, thank you.
---
i'll probably be looking at 3-4 months of heavy grinding for R13 then. a bit rough but i can manage it.
---
Thank you for your help.
---
https://discord.gg/auRTXD
---
Here you can find a bunch of guilds recruiting the recruitment channel
---
Those daggers look basic make them spicy
---
5-6 levels? Look at you Mr. Hotshot.
---
Fuck, most my replacements I crafted, and it's like 10-15 levels between replacements. 44 and still don't have a neck piece.
---
This is just not true. 
---
Late in vanilla (not private servers), battleshout did slightly more threat than a single sunder armor if applied to all 5 party members. Granted, this threat was split amongst all mobs, but unless you were pulling more than 5 or so mobs, it did more threat than demoralizing shout and nearly double that of bloodrage. In fact, when TBC came out, they nerfed how much threat battleshout did because they thought it was too much (check out 2.0 patch notes)
---
Is the True Faith Vestment going to be at phase 1? I've seen videos talking about the patterns and people saying it's going to be at launch and on a later phase. Do we actually know?
---
*siiiiiip* *Kickstart my heart starts to play* yeah its wow classic time
---
How do the dots work in Classic? I know they changed it so that you could pop CDs after dotting and still get the buff. Sorry my english is very basic :)
---
UD warriors are arguably the best warriors for pvp so if pvp is your end goal then your all set. Also UD warriors are pretty badass. As for pve dps orc is the best because of their racials but honestly looking cool and enjoying your class/race is more important then being 1% higher on dps meters
---
Nothing.
---
Like I said, getting to cruise control mode takes more effort in Vanilla and it gets harder to get there the later the content. You really think any decent guild is going to need consumables to clear MC and BWL once they're on farm during the first 2 phases?
---
I don't want her, you can have her, she's too fat for me.
---
Yeah I'd say that's quite likely.  A lot of these streamers don't seem like they really know what R14 grinding means.
---
It's free advertising, why wouldn't they do it? You know how expensive advertising is normally? Streamers do it for free and really really well.   
---
Of course they have priority.
---
Dude, you are amazing. These replies are really, really helpful. I think Herbalism and Alchemy could be a good option then because Tauren also has the Herbalism racial if I remember correctly.
---
The gold making is something nice but if it's helpful later on where people want to have these potions then I could see myself doing that. Though I have to admit enchanting seems to be a nice thing aswell.
---
I have some time to think but these responses are really nice of you.
---
No but there will be addons
---
Well, he didn’t make much but he sure as hell made a lot more money playing the game than I did.
---
I can't wait to go back to these places, like the Stonetalon lumber mill, or the Ironforge Airstrip
---
I probably will simply because my friends and I do not have the best attention spans.
---
I just bought a new gaming laptop so I for sure will be turning up the graphics to max!
---
That hunter with Untamed Blade...lol.
---
Only 1 hunter in the raid? Dang. I really hope it's not that hard for hunters in classic.
---
But if you think about it, doesn’t that confusion make the dungeon seem a bit more mysterious? A bit more adventurous? Don’t you think that’s the whole point of classic? Remember this before you install any addons that removes the sense of wonder that Azeroth offers.
---
&gt;I’m really enjoying the visual as well as the class fantasy behind UD and particularly warrior.
---
Play what you want to play, man. You're going to be looking at your guy a long time. If you like UD better than Orc you should be UD.
---
100% worth. You will not be able to clear any of the end-game raids (as they take longer than 1 hr) but, you can do almost anything else. Esp if you like to PVP. The hardest part will be having to stop playing after that hour...
---
Did you guys down KT numerous times?
---
10 servers all capped at 2.5-3k? Are you saying you think only 25-30k people will play Classic at launch?
---
This is *huge* for rogues.
---
    /cast Pick Pocket
---
    /cast Cheap Shot
---
macro (and similar for all openers), essentially makes you pickpocket every mob automatically.
---
You do? I've yet to see asmon miss as much as I did levling up
---
That was more of a generational thing. Sylvanas wasn't born yet when that occurred.
---
Brilliant
---
I had serious names all over the place. I think my mage was named "Altaris" or something like this. I'm still upholding the "no special characters" rule to this day.
---
I started on NA servers before EU launch.
---
This boss should still be pretty fun considering only a very small size of the wow population killed it.
---
I was an alliance warrior tank last I played in WotLK, this time I wanna go horde healer. What are my best options?
---
Just don’t spoil yourself by reading up too much on it. Go in without knowing a lot and that’ll give you the best WoW experience.
---
You will DPS slooooowly. ANd by slowly, I mean *fucking slow*.
---
I mean this is simply not true at all, and can be tested right now in Classic Beta.  Get a party member to facepull a mob, u cast battleshout and notice how you do not get agro.
---
Warrior:
---
* tanking is an option available to you. 5 mans will almost always be open to you since you can tank or dps
---
* raiding is similar, but you'll end up focusing on tanking or damage dealing
---
* there is no solo-work or utility. you will be tied to someone's hip to be useful, whether that be a healer or a support of some kind.
---
* Positive feedback loop: you use rage. better gear=more rage. more rage= more damage. You scale very well
---
Rogue:
---
* damage dealer only
---
* good world pvp class
---
* independent because of stealth's ability to take you places you couldn't otherwise go and the ability to pick encounters
---
* utility in the form of lockpicking. boxes and doors.
---
Both are gear dependent to a degree and generally slow levelers. 
---
I personally feel like rogue has a more fleshed out class fantasy in WoW than warrior does since you do more RPG oriented things like picking locks, picking pockets, and making poisons  while warriors are just straight wrecking balls that run in and smack things with big weapons. Both are fun, but in different ways.
---
are you implying that getting rank 14 implies any form of skill?
---
I rly hope he gets a promotion he deserves:)
---
I still watch your movie from time to time man, great to see the OG roguelock make a return.
---
You had spell detail turned down.
---
Considering Blizzard is running a reference 1.12 client... I’m going to go ahead and say yes. 
---
Why wouldn’t they be?
---
Thx for the answers guys! I’ll stick to Hunter and do the best I can.
---
Vanilla gave her a Nelf model because the high elf ones were really, really bad. Like jarringly, out of place bad. Like, it should have never made it to live bad.
---
Ud warriors are the best my bro, u get mad respect from me
---
The number one most important thing to realize that fucks over many is that if your playing a priest, shaman, paladin or druid then at lvl 60 there is a 99% chance that you will be forced to heal. All the hybrid classes do very poor dps compared to pure dps classes and pali/bear tanks can not main tank (they can usually off tank fine).
---
So your account is na. I did not mean people from EU could not play, I meant that people who only have an EU account have not really been picked for the beta yet.
---
They most certainly were not.
---
Even just my tiny late vanilla server, Venture Co, had multiple guilds organizing wpvp invasions on the daily.
---
Opening the gates requires a combined effort of one or more guilds, so if you can convince them to let you have it (you'll have a few months to prove your worth), then sure, I don't see why having no experience prior to the game launching would harm you chances too much.
---
No, It just takes a long time and I am beginning to doubt that he will invest the needed time into it.
---
In solchen Momenten wünsche ich, ich hätte meine ganzen Classic Screenshots noch. Classic Patch 1.7 bis Season 3 BC sind weg weil mein jüngeres Ich einfach keine Ahnung von Backups hatte. Wenn der PC mal spinnte wurde einfach ein neues System draufgespielt. :D
---
Hach ja, die Erinnerungen bleiben und in Classic werden neue Screenshots gemacht!
---
Dont read up on everything. What you dont have right now is the nostalgia all the other people are longing for
---
Yes it does. Because it mostly require an heavy time sink doesn't mean it doesn't also require skill
---
I don't think the Alliance had a single leader in classic. They were a true Alliance back then.
---
The kids are going to be on when they get home from school, which is often near when adults get home from work. Not going to matter much.
---
The first two are in at the launch and the 3 dragons come at a later phase
---
This was the standard strategy.  It wasn't until TBC that battleshout threat was nerfed.
---
It would be nice if wowhead brought thottbot back up for classic!
---
I think your point is very valid. I do however just wants to know where the hell I am inside a dungeon :D I was in WC the other day on a server and I couldnt find my way around lol.
---

From what I understood they free the name after a while, but I was able to retake the exact same name.

I like how this drawing simultaneously looks scuffed and amazing.
---
So you enjoy getting ganked all the time. Got it.
---
There still is alot of poor chinese people that work for little to no money, this is part of the reason we still use china to manufacture goods instead of another country.
---
Time. Source of all the toxicity + all of the enjoyment.

Your videos make me so happy, I hope you enjoy making them as much as i do watching them.
---
unfortunately yes.

Fat/semi-fat ladies are perfectly fine. Men are simlly imprisoned by stereotypes.

Nice. But knowing Blizzard they will ruin it. They always ruin good addons and game features.

it's not exact, but, here's Asmongold and Esfand's videos of Hogger:

---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425251836?t=06h19m57s (Esfand)
---
Asmongold is around the armor value of the person in the video. he doesn't get hit as much, but he's generally getting hit for 20+. he immediately got crit on the first hit for 55.
---
Esfand is getting hit for an average of mid-20s.
---
what, no. it was a joke
---
some specs are just bad. Actually having room for 40 players in a raid but the spec versatility is really boring, how melee dps is 70% fury warrs and ranged dps is 70% fire mages
---
I logged back into retail today for the first time in a while and immediately noticed that a lot of the hunter abilities have animations and sounds *extremely* similar to the Demon Hunter abilities. I don't know if that's a change that occurred at the start of BFA or sooner than that, but I don't remember it being that way and I did play up to 120 through the first patch of BFA.
---
Either way, I was amazed at how obvious the similarity was to me today when I logged in. Not to mention mobs go down about as easily and quickly as they do in Diablo, except you're fighting them one or two at a time instead of in hordes.
---
I was a level 26 Paladin when my classmates found out I play WoW. These guys begged me to respecc to Holy to be their healbot (they assumed I specced Ret). That day I found out you have an actual skill tree where you have to put points in, man I love young and clueless me.
---
If people decide to kill themselves by playing a game, no amount of convenience will help them.

On-topic.

The people that acted as "Guild bank" get banned, quit, whatever = bad times. Didn't have a problem with anything else.
---
vurtne 60-66 pvp is tbc patch 2.x something
---
I think he’s suggesting since damage seems a bit off is it possible mana and health are as well (presumably to maybe explain how damage is off if health and mana were scaled down).. this is just what I’m gathering not 100% if that’s what he meant
---
How so?
---
As a raid healing shaman is it worth my time to get the Dungeon T2 set before starting MC/Ony or should i just hop in with whatever i've got on hand? I know MC isn't exactly hard but i also don't want to be useless to my boys.
---
Thanks.
---
Tirion Fordring  quest line in EP.
---
Someone needs to bring it up in the next interview
---
So it's just world PvP?
---
sounds like a fine plan. I'd recommend holding on to ore you find early or buy a bunch when the market is flooded to lessen the sting of leveling BS once you've left the lower level zones.
---
People view classic as a change in direction for retail, which has been asked for for ages. It's not so much vanilla itself, but rebuking the status quo.
---
Oh I also played on Gorgonnash back then!
---
shame it's not called adultvanillafriendfinder
---
My birthday is 8/26, the release date for my zone! So excited.

That’s the difference. Now this guy probably is a millionaire and owns half the houses in your neighborhood.
---
Make sure to list your Info on vanillafriends.com
---
I like it, but for classic I'm going to need some more action bars.
---
I do, actually! Thanks for watching them =]
---
Dont over hype yourself
---
&gt;In the first few days of beta i’ve grouped with more random people in the open world than I have in months in live. 
---
So many people think it's just that "times changed" and people just don't play together the same way anymore.
---
No, its based on the game design.  People are grouping because it's beneficial to do so.  It's hard to solo, and when you're both soloing and fighting over the same enemies it's less efficient for both of you.
---
In live WoW it doesn't really matter when everything does in one second and they all respawn so fast that you can both do it without really interfering with each other.
---
The orc stun resist racial is gamebreaking for PvP
---
That's the plan as it stands, Herb to hopelessly try to offset the costs of this grind and mining to both level BS and for the bars i need for the hammer in the long  run.  
---
Once i have Darkiron smithing and the ability to make the hammer i'd be a pretty capable smith though, so maybe that'll help offset some costs in the long run as well.
---
Loot 1 Copper - Check
---
Chuck Norris Joke - Check
---
Increase weapon skill - Check
---
Yes, this is vanilla
---
Is there an add on that just adds more action bars to ur UI? Instead of replacing the whole thing
---
People keep saying that UD warrior is the best, but it would say that it depends heavily on so many factors. What spec are you running? Both Arms and Fury have their strengths in pvp, and if you go fury you will not only have Berserker Rage and Recklessness, but also Death Wish to stop fear effects. Will of the Forsaken is hardly worth it at that point, and even without Death Wish, you will only have much trouble against warlocks. 
---
On the other hand you have Orc, which has that sweet stun resist. 25% of it, even. If you really feel like trolling, you can even go for 15% additional stun resist and reach 40%, although that might not be worth the points. The point is, though, that you will have a much easier time against rogues and paladins.
---
When it comes to pvp, people tend to stick to the mindset that fear ward or fear removal is the be all, end all, but they often forget that one of the most common CC mechanics in pve is actually short-duration stuns like shield bash, which can especially make a pull difficult if you start off getting stunned for 2 seconds while the mobs run straight for your healer. Now sure you won't resist every single stun, but you will get caught in those annoying situations less often.
---
Finally you have the +5 axe skill which can be really nice for pve. +5 skill is noticable, and might even push axes ahead of swords that, on their own, have better stats than whatever axes you can get in the same bracket.
---
I'd take an orc any day if you're a warrior, but suit yourself.
---
I got into raiding about 18 months into vanilla. Our guild was always recruiting solid tanks, as you have bosses that need multiple tanks, and tanks were the first to get recruited away.
---
Bartender did back then yes
---
I tried really hard to like retail. I did. I bought bfa and tried to have an open mind but it’s just boring. The leveling process and dungeons are just so easy and with everything scaling, it just feels pointless to become more powerful and get better gear.  Mythics shouldn’t be the only difficult thing in wow. Pvp is the absolute worst now too and I won’t get into that. But in the end I couldn’t even bring myself to play for long enough to get to max and I’m not very busy lol.
---
&gt; Good Guy Greg, Scumbag Steve
---
Damn it has been a long while since I've seen or heard from those memes.
---
not hard, just slow. minkelz is right, its just really mana dependent. you have to drink between almost every pull with balance. but its really safe leveling and youre hard to gank in world pvp so thats nice. also balance is badass
---
I feel personally attacked
---
lol tipsout is technically correct she is inside the red circle lol you know i never played ESO before but ive been thinking about making lore video's for it you guys think ill be as successful as tipsout ? lol ( im not serious )
---
Well, an alternative to getting a map add on would be to simply learn the layout of the dungeons. WC always confused me for the longest time but when I finally just started paying attention to the landmarks I was able to find my way around. Same goes for most other dungeons and raids.
---
But to each their own. If you prefer a map, I’m sure you can find several add ons for it.
---
Argent Dawn, Horde side here. What a joy to read. That did not happen on our side iirc, probably because we were much smaller in population. I was never big on raiding in vanilla, but I remember a few things. Like world pvp for us was always a thing to do at night, to even the odds a bit, while our auctioneers got slayed in broad daylight. Do you have more good Alliance stories to share?
---
&gt; d
---
cute
---
I mean he was only the top na warrior during vanills
---
I really have a hard time believing that resisting stuns 6 times as often is worse than having a second way to break fear.
---
The whole damage is calculated when you start the dot, so yeah hitting a trinket after you already have a dot up won't do anything. Typically it doesn't matter a whole lot in vanilla because there's no way to refresh any dots anyway, so it's not like you can mega amp a dot and then keep it going for the entire fight.
---
Don't like them? Don't join them, make your own group.
---
It's that simple.
---
Wrathbabies and furries gigatriggered
---
Well, it doesn't really matter since there's no way to pinpoint your location in a dungeon in game, especially not in dungeons with multiple levels like Wailing Caverns.
---
You can try to reference your minimap position against dungeon maps in an addon like Atlas, but unless you already know the dungeon there is still a high possibility in some dungeons you will not be able to discern where to go based on that alone, since the dungeon maps are just a full size graphic of the map that is displayed in the minimap.
---
I'm not saying addons can't be helpful, But they aren't a complete solution. You need to learn and explore the dungeons and get to know your way around them.
---
Gracias.
---
This is creative and all but please do not put a 30 second intro before a youtube video. It only holds it's charm once.
---
I was planning on going paladin. Is it really that bad?
---
My bet would be on Instant Pyro Mage.
---
Wow I didn't realize this subreddit was so blue-pilled.
---
Quest cap, you can only have 20 active quests at a time
---
Yes there will be a lot of warriors. They are much easier to level on Classic than they were on PSers as well with buffed regen so there's really not much reason to not roll a warrior now.
---
No, my account that was invited is my EU account.  They do not share the same battle.net
---
The closest comparison is T2 level gear, but PVP gear back then focused more on stamina, so you would have higher HP, lower damage output overrall.  Although, once Naxx gear came out, someone fully geared in T3 items (was incredibly uncommon in pvp to run across) felt impossible to take down if they were decent.
---
I’m waiting on which RP server claims that name...
---
More time for stress testing and working out bugs. School kids will be limited to playing after school instead of all day so everyone can lvl at a similar pace. Enjoy your summer.
---
Last I played was WotLK and I was a casual alliance warrior tank, mostly focusing on raids and 5 mans. This time I wanna go horde healer, what are my best options for raiding?
---
Link?
---
Anyone else /kneel before them?
---
I agree with you, I meant generally most people aren't going to find that to be entertaining.
---
First time experience when you are a noob in the huge world is the best feeling of the game. I wish I could go back and have the noob feeling again
---
Oh right, that’s one of the ones I tried lol. Didn’t know you could keep the original and add just actions bars though
---
I enjoy the freedom and fun that pvp servers have, I do not enjoy the artificial restrictions pve servers have.  If I have to be ganked a few times when leveling up by some micropenis loser then that's a price I'm willing to pay.  
---
Oh and evidently, most people agree with me and my point of view as seen by the complete lack of appetite for pve servers in the classic pserver community.
---
its common knowledge that people got legion alpha for having cutting edge from HFC. [here's a link i guess \(not very good proof, but the first thing that showed up\).](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20418542842)  All i'm saying is that calling people 'no kill scrubs' when you're not clearing the content is stupid.
---
Until the subs are dropping, the profits are dropping and no one knows why. Wall St is quite notorious for driving companies to push quarterly profits over long time viability.
---
Horde here. Is that Varian? I remember reading about him in a Warcraft novel.
---
Isn't arms the hands down best PvP while fury is the top pve spec?
---
He is talking about Private servers
---
Uhm the dungeon maps in retail wow is exactly what I would want.
---
I thought you could kill npcs regardless of server type, like they're always flagged
---
It's great people were given the option to mix and match.  I don't like the new water but everything else is nice.  So i can just turn down water, fantastic.
---
I’ve got my graphics turned all the way up. Looks fantastic.
---
keep downvoting it, you cringe depots. let's see how low it can go. you will kill this game.
---
You can do it with every class, it's all about playing well.
---
Yeah i get that. I dont like bfa either, and thats fine. Im probably gonna pinball between retail and classic when something new drops and fall back on the solid grund that is classic wow.
---
Ya ret paladins are notoriously bad (in raids) and probably the biggest meme class in vanilla. Really good in pvp. A raid group miiiight bring 1 ret Pali for buffs and such but if you want to play pve dps Pali is not the move... By far
---
I hope u enjoy recasting 5 minute buffs/healing and using auto attack to level

You don't get into a good premade if you are dogshit.

Don't pressure the man, wait for the release and then ask for an ama. He's currently acting as the right hand of God and you shouldn't interrupt that.

Do weapons and trinkets, with a chance of hit dmg effect, get plus damage from any stats?

cannibalism is also great for PvP and so is shadow resistance.
---
I wouldnt say they are better than Orks though
---
Yeah man just keep posting this picture everyday i'm sure it will blow up eventually!
---
You have 2 battlenet account linked to 2 different addresses and you got the invite for the EU one? Ok but then again, could you clarify the time you were subbed, when you resub and when you got invited.
---
Again good luck finding metrics to support that thesis
---
That's the problem, the metrics
---
Didn't think about having secondary weapons! Thanks!
---
I'm new here, who is he?
---
I just hate the orc model it shits me. Same reason I can’t do trolls or Tauren, feels so second rate.
---
The undead model looks phenomenal on the beta (so does night elf as an aside).
---
The glowing eyes, the posture, the battle shout animation.... fuck I get shivers. 
---
Doot doot.
---
There isn't really a definitive answer to that, but generally speaking, yes. Arms or 2H slam has its strengths early on in pve, especially when you're horde and have WF-totem, and it shouldn't take long to find videos of warriors slicing people to pieces in battlegrounds using fury. In premades I would guess that arms is better because you have to fight a coordinated team with healers, and having the -50% healing debuff can help pressure a lot more than straight up damage, but fury is not the meme pvp spec it was in tbc.
---
Isn't "gaming laptop" an oxymoron?
---
I will never understand the different language thing. I am not a native english speaker and I would rather not play the game at all, than having it be translated to my own language. It seems like the most cringy thing in the world
---
damage is more or less accurate with a few discrepancies (such as the frontpage post about that random tiger hitting Joana for 1-2, but other peopel for 5-6). there's very few vanilla references videos, but the ones that have been sourced show that damage values are around the same level.
---
https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=87
---
this is a random Warrior with 1127 health at 24 with MoTW, which gives 4 Stamina.
---
https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=239
---
here's Asmongold at level 25 with 1144 with Fortitude, which is 20 Stamina. so, it seems pretty accurate.
---
Nights are as dark as they were in Vanilla, which is to say, not very dark at all.
---
Dude I know. Internal struggle.
---
&gt;He’s been very self aware about that aspect of himself and I would say it’s part of the character.
---
As far as it matters to me, I'm not convinced that this is a meaningful distinction. 
---
If he's a dick in WoW, and the only time I would ever interact with him is when he's on WoW, then what else matters? I'm staying way the hell away from any servers with asshole streamers. I just hope none of them generate on the server I eventually call home.
---
is there any talk about raid frames? they are the bfa ones

Stop posting my diary man

I usually have some addon, not exactly an arrow pointing me where to go but more like [pfquest](https://shagu.org/pfQuest/). That said, I will definitely try it raw on some alt, after all that’s how i started playing back in the day and would be interesting to try it again.
---
literally a joke, but apparently everyone on this subreddit is an 85 IQ retail player.
---
Love the vids, you are the first youtuber I've actually gotten into. I love how deep you go and the information you present. I also enjoy the mono tone voice to be honest. Fits the type of videos you provide (non bias, knowledge gathering content). You find things to make content out of that are really interesting instead of taking 1 blue post and making an hour long video on it. Very unique!!

What were the nerfs in 2006?  Do you happen to have patch notes?

---
Step 1: Accept that you have very little chance to get into beta.  Step 2: pserver until classic, good practice ;)
---
I posted this yesterday, and it was taken down. Why so salty? O.o
---
We missed out on killing KT despite being top 25 through most of Naxx, warriors quitting and bad management from the class leader meant we never got to finish Naxx 40, this is my goal in classic :)
---
Hunters are arguably the best class at getting to 60 and the worst class to be once you're 60 (if you care about raiding). Their DPS is fine in the early raids but scales poorly, so they only get like 1-3 raid spots in most 40 man compositions. You bring hunters to pull things, tranq shot when needed, and occasionally kite some stuff. They are not nearly as in demand as warriors, rogues, mages, and warlocks when it comes to DPS slots. Combine this with the volume of hunters there will be among the early level 60 population, and you really need to be exceptional to make yourself stand out from the pack if you want one of the limited raid spots available.
---
That said, if you want to kill casters in PvP, then Viper Sting is gonna be your jam. That shit is OP.
---
Cant wait to get in a life ruining game, as it was like intended, from the start !

Horde and ally AH were each their own, and there was a third neutral AH in major goblin spots for cross faction selling/trading. I used to list things there on occasion to transfer items between my characters on different factions, but on it's own the neutral AH was never that popular due to higher fees.

Do you remember how many realms there were?

I was subbed from Aug to Jan for BFA and from March to now.

---
Any Mac users tried the Beta? I’m curious to see what the performance is like on less-powered machines (MacBook Pro, Air etc.). 
---
I have access to a variety of Apple laptops (as well as iMacs) at work. So will probably be installing and playing Classic on a portable Mac as I mostly work from home/on the move. 
---
I know Macs aren’t really gaming machines but surely modern integrated GPUs can run WoW on at least average settings?
---
Maybe its because its not funny but you sperging out in this thread is.
---
Man, if you love the model, go for it. Personally I'm always one to pick hunter in vanilla, and I could never pick a nelf even though they're better in pve than dwarves. You just can't mess with that big-ass beard and that bulky posture, so I totally get where you're coming from. I doubt you'll regret picking UD, especially if you're into their model. It would be a different story if you told me you really wanted to play a troll warrior *shudder*

Possible, but I also anyone who would see this and downvote, let alone the 90% of the people who did, is a fucking moron.

I wonder how many people know that LFG actually existef in Vanilla. You would talk to an inkeeper or click the meetimg stone and you would be added to a queue and then into a group if you were in the correct level range.

No one ever used it though.

Yeah WoW gold and runescape gold are unironically more stable as a form of currency than venezuela's own fiat

Thanks, then maybe there is more hope than I thought. It just seems na are getting more invites but maybe they just stream more.
---
Sorta? As I understand it, now there are no PvP servers but you can flag for PvP (or unflag) in a capital city and that gives you an xp bonus and puts you on shards with other players flagged for PvP.

Seems like a good system on paper, I don't know how it works in practice.

I was on the server that had the enh shaman hand of rag guy. I remember our server queues suddenly exploding with lowbies chasing a dream. I was only alliance but I had some horde friends who said they spammed chat and were basically super obnoxious for a month or so. Most of them gave up once they hit the pvp zones and got wrecked (our server was horribly overpopulated by alli).

I imagine sharing a server with streamers must be something like that. Except it's forever.

Sitting at a red light, I was thinking to myself, that classic beta is out, and I can't play it right now, Started my account back in Dec 2004, and have an active sub, but no invite yet!  I don't do private servers, I like the idea of playing on a Blizzard server.  A lot of people wont understand, but when the game first came out, I was blown away with everything WOW had to offer,  I love this game.

nah ty I'm good.

Ask for cheese and pickles next time.
---
Fuck Tips and his slack jaw.
---
Confirmed to stay BFA frames since Classic frames were super clunky and no one used them, everyone just used Grid instead.
---
Asmon makes some good commentary since he's play Wow for so long. But I worry his viewer base may not realize they shouldn't act like him. Because the character Asmongold is very toxic.
---
This was kinda moving, I liked the read, thanks for that. Farming often brings great encounters, always the chillest people. But to see someone get payed so little (for us in the West) to do that is always weird. Glad he enjoyed the game though, might have been a great opportunity in his eye.
---
Disagree. It was the most perfect game of all time imo. The best rpg ever. Does what makes rpgs great, does it perfect.
---
OSRS has killed modern Runescape IIRC, and OSRS is growing after 6 years. If classic kills retail then the execs will support it. At least until they get greedy again.
---
I’m fine, thanks.
---
I'm gonna try this build.
---
Doesn't matter how many fans you have when it's 10v10.
---
That’s pretty good.
---
You are not alone
---
Lol it looks real in the thumbnail
---
Last year they had a version of the mcchicken for $3 with drier chicken and some shitty thousand island type sauce.
---
I appreciate it! I'm excited that people seem to be enjoying Classic so much(what little they have access to, at least). Hopefully Blizzard will open up the gates soon, so more of us can get in and get some real stress testing in.
---
 I like looking at old screenshots. Interesting you were mounted up inside LH chapel (comment was deleted because a pserver uses that name).
---
People have an irrational hate of twitch streamers on this sub so prepare to get downvoted by autistic boomers
---
I played a night elf druid named Nightdruid, so I get it.
---
What’s the BiS quiver for this method?
---
I got banned from his channel because I posted one of his clips on here. Him or one of his mods went the extra mile to track my username down from the clip and ban me. That's screaming insecurity.
---
it would be a miracle if that happens
---
This is not designed as a test for an OSRS like product
---
This is a ploy to get us subbed and on retail
---
They're not looking to divide their player base and provide double the product lol
---
Awesome! Thanks so much for the assistance!
---
Damn that’s badass. Imagine getting demolished in wsg by an orc with a quiver. Absolute humiliation.
---
Apparently yes. The primary outcome being that Blizzard now knows there is a sizeable population of people who willingly throw money at anything they offer, no matter how predatory the practice.
---
It never ceases to amaze the ways in which gamers reward and therefore encourage this kind of nonsense. It is the main reason it will never end.
---
Silly tbh, they are part of the reason Classic is currently doing so well.
---
That kind of reaction is one of the things I'd bet people miss about 1st and 2nd generation MMOs.  If you decided to be a piece of shit you couldn't change your name, transfer servers, or queue up in an auto dungeon group finder until you got matched with people you'd never see again.  You would be held accountable to the community you played in.
---
NO ONE BETTER REPORT THIS AS A BUG! This needs to be in the game!
---
Day 621 in the Karma mines. The Gonzalez Vein remains rich.
---
Traitor!
---
Horrifying unless you're the orc! Zug Zug
---
Pass.
---
Haha, when I got back to wow in TBC I went horde, but I'm considering playing Alliance for nostalgia and since I don't really remember the quests since it's been so long.  
---
Might even do another night elve just to stay true to my kid's view.
---
No thanks. I’m having a nice day without streamers.
---
Priest
---
You understand these raids have loads of different streamers in them that you can watch, not just the 2 names I mentioned.
---
Omar do a reaction video to these memes pls
---
Same thing happened to me
---
early on in vanilla they each had their own. in 1.12 all the allies are connected, all the horde are connected, and then you have booty bay. I just like hanging out in darn. I think around the 2nd-4th expansion they connected the horde and allies AHs but I haven't played recently so I'm not sure.
---
you can use iWall
---
I don't have a link but, I can tell you 100% for certain storm strike will not proc WF. I don't know when the change was made I just know it happened before 1.12
---
I feel only certaint steamers must be avoided 
---
Such as asmongold
---
How much threat does polymorph generate?  Why didn't he take aggro with the autoattack?
---
No they are not. It would have exploded either way , they just swept in to collect the revenue. Except asmon I mean this is his life.
---
The only reason to get rank 14 as a caster is bragging rights basically. The r14 weapons aren't great for caster.
---
If SS said he wants r14, I'm assuming it's for bragging rights because the payoff just isn't there in terms of time investment and effort for caster.
---
alright boys, lets go back to the streamer hate, what class should I play threads, and don't let people tell you how to play the game....
---
D2 will only be released on phase 2, so no. Further, it mostly sucks for PvE.
---
Honestly I don't know that. I know for sure you can't proc it on SS or off it self. However you might be able to proc it on Hand of Justice. I don't know for that one.
---
&gt; Imo classic epics should have stats compareable with tbc max lvl blues.
---
Absolutely. The itemization bloat was the worst thing about TBC. Early vanilla raid gear should have lasted you to 70 heroics, and T3 should have been viable for walking straight into TBC raids. Introducing the repetitive grind that is daily quests also sucked, but other than that I think it was a damn good expansion. It's my second favorite after WotLK (raiding Ulduar as a Disc Priest was the best time I've had in all of WoW, the organic hard modes were an amazing implementation that I have no clue why they abandoned for simple normal/heroic toggling).
---
I'm sure people quiver at the prospect.
---
duly noted, thank you.
---
What are you talking about? Asmon had stated atleast 15 times over the last two days how much fucking fun he is having with classic. The stream hate on this subreddit is absurd
---
Yes, and that's *not* what you're going to get.
---
[This](http://www.vanillawowguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Minimap-Inside-Complete-Fixed2.jpg) is the map for Wailing Caverns you will see, and your character position won't be displayed on it. You'll have to look at your minimap, find the same spot on this map, then figure out what level you're on, then figure out which way what path leads with no indication of topography. It's not terribly confusing for most of this dungeon, *if you know the general layout and order in which to progress.* But good luck to you in Blackrock Depths or Dire Maul or Sunken Temple trying to stumble around blindly based on these maps alone.
---
We know you want retail dungeon maps, you've said it twice, but you're not getting them, so I'm telling you that you're going to need to just explore and learn the dungeons, at some point. Take all the help you can get, experienced group leaders, addons, videos, but when you get kicked because you can't find your way back to the entrance or find the group again after a death, you'll have only yourself to blame.
---
I honestly was thinking the same thing.
---
armory excludes chars that have not been online for a while
---
Ehh they need Classic more than Classic needs them.
---
You upset bro? I mean you know I’m right. We watched them play because we couldn’t log in, that’s pretty much it.
---
It could be off, but the deal with damage values is that we have no clue what they should be. 
---
Private server folks did their best to estimate the values but it turns out the line between regular mobs and elites is not binary. Within the elite classification there is still a ton of variation for things like armor, resists, and damage.
---
Here is a video that shows Dun Modr apparently from 2005:
---
https://youtu.be/f0-2vXLJZ_Y
---
I haven't watched it all but it seems like this group is not having a hard time at all with these elites.
---
Thanks fam
---
kinda off topic but im REALLY surprised how little you can remember about classic for a guy like him who played tf out of it
---
Time to enjoy this summer like it's our last.
---
For the Classic!
---
Imagine being this ignorant. Nostalrius was the reason classic came to fruition.
---
meh i liked them
---
Was there actually that much foliage in vanilla? I was watching some streamers and it seemed like more than I remembered, but it's also likely I just had everything turned down as well.
---
First point, taken.
---
But Koreans, or any Asian country has always been different compared to the EU and NA way of things with World of Warcraft. All from subscription model, store stuff, and whatnot.
---
honestly, try private servers if you want classic-like experience. There is huge surge of players give classic hype, feel free to pm me if you need help
---
I'd check Throttbot comments if I were you. If it was in game before 1.3, Classic'll have it on phase 1, otherwise they're most likely to gate it.
---
&gt; You upset bro?
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
Eh... Dwarven priest, your point is silly. Trivializes so many bosses.
---
Imo.. wait for classic. But hey, thats just me. If you ask the same question on the official forums you might up getting another answer.
---
Might as well try it
---
Already done, thanks
---
Heads up, this isn't a recent thing. I can personally attest for a year or so. Realistically there's no reason for this (largely one-sided) rivalry. They're different games
---
Both, classic is under the main games sub pricing (or less if you want exclusively classic) - if you enjoy MMO's and haven't been made bitter by years and years of playing WoW then both versions have their own merits, neither are going anywhere so you have enough time to dabble in both.
---
Ok a couple of questions
---
1. If I play on a PvP server, will I be able to roll characters on opposite factions?
---
2. How many characters can I roll in classic
---
3. Is the price for classic just the monthly subscription?
---
If only we could have the best of both worlds. But instead the "NoChAnGeS" crowd are going to make us be stuck with garbage like spell batching and debuff limits.
---
They had the unique opportunity to take classic and apply an extra coat of polish to it, and they're passing it up.
---
You can try it out. But it's not true to classic wow. The leveling is alright, it's a bit fast but meh.
---
Dude, dont worry about it.
---
Literally only one. 
---
I would svitch 20 trolls in my group to trade extra dps vs fear reduction on something very specific.
---
I don't mind Asmongold at all, I find him pretty entertaining. 
---
As a long time Horde player however, this was satisfying as fuck to watch.
---
Sonydigital said he would go for rank 14.
---
To be fair that isn't really a community. That sounds like any normal expansion launch where the *game is the best ever*. Now classic when its live can be different than that because if the people *stay* then we will have a community. The community will make or break this game but if it lasts, those are the best bros to be friends with.
---
Mother fucker. I was split on lock or shaman and even tho I'd go ele/resto at end game, I was still looking forward to levelling as Enh. 
---
Maybe my decision just got a lot easier
---
Everybody dies, servers shut down.
---
You know its weekend. They don´t do such things on weekends I think. Maybe tomorrow.
---
Beat me to it. Fear ward is saucey.
---
&gt;Blizz is supposedly looking at offering free xfers to allow people to get away from them.
---
I really enjoy listening to your soothing voice madseason and I genuinely like your videos. Hope you keep doing what you doing and enjoy it.
---
Do I only have a chance at a beta invite if I currently have an active subscription?
---
I feel like I lost some brain cells reading this.
---
It’s not the same. Makes the barrens feel like wheaty farmland rather than actually barren
---
Yea I know, the question boils down to should I start subbing to it now and experience current wow or just wait for what people have been calling "the shit" and save some money.
---
&gt; I would never roll lock or priest alliance side
---
Dwarf priest, come on now
---
If they remove it from the game, people will do it through websites.
---
The genie is out of the lamp. You can't put it back in. People aren't going to spam chats in game when people now have the ability to make it easier.
---
That's actually one of the savest mage aoe leveling spots but psssst don't tell them
---
Yeah, I have to agree.     
---
It'll be interesting to see if he'll follow through with his plan once he realizes/remembers how much effort it *actually* is.
---
I'm also really looking forward to see how the PvP heroes of old will adjust to the new PvP Meta.
---
I mean come down off that high horse buddy. You tell me you enjoy watching these guys pretend they ever knew anything about classic wow. It’s weird, why didn’t they just say they always wanted to play it or they played alittle so they are excited to try again. Instead they ran around claiming they knew everything then on stream clearly they didn’t.
---
&gt; they are part of the reason
---
Imagine not being able to read something properly.
---
Faction and class imbalance are now considered features of Vanilla, not bugs.
---
Feel free to give arguments.
---
1000% this
---
That’s exactly how vanilla was. Stop trying to change stuff that doesn’t need to be changed.
---
1. I've seen a thread just today, the answer is no.
---
2. Dunno but probably 10 per server.
---
3. Yes.
---
Except the server population is not really classic-like, the constant server crashes are though.
---
I'd rather watch watch vids from 2005 at 240p than give any of them another view count.
---
That was a good read, thanks for sharing!
---
Glad you see him around and that he’s doing better now a days
---
Exactly
---
Not even a good D&amp;D Party, either. We have a Cleric/Paladin cross class, that one guy who ALWAYS insists on being a werewolf, tragic backstory edge-girl wizard and someone who convinced the DM to be a medium-sized diamond golem.
---
I'm not a fan of either of the two, but none of the streamers eventually looted the chest. Doesn't that kind of defeat your point?
---
That's Anduin.
---
Are you seriously comparing retail and classic?
---
I hope you accidently join server which only contains only your faction. Remember to come complain to thread.
---
Some of these comments are unnecessery, I get what you’re saying. Thx for the heads up. :)
---
Wait, did I really say 2? I meant 5, with AQ, as back then.
---
Yes! This!
---
I just started reading the Chronicles too, currently on Volume 1
---
I will grant you that Warrior is the best and most consistent MT in raids, however raiding is not the only content. And even in raids, Druids are sometimes more optimal in a few specific encounters, e.g. Vael. They are also very good to have for OT, as they can tank very well in their DPS spec. OT Warriors either have to tank as Fury or DPS as Prot (or some hybrid spec), so they are going to be more suboptimal in either tanking or DPS. Druids are simply more flexible. You also want to mix in a Druid to not waste Feral gear and to be able to gear up the warriors faster.
---
When it comes to dungeons, Druids are perhaps better suited than Warriors, except when it comes to AOE packs. Paladins can get by, but they are certainly the weakest. Shamans I don't really consider viable from SM on.
---
wild, i didn't know that.  
---
Either way i'll just deal.
---
WoW retail is perfectly fine if you're experiencing it for the first time ever honestly and will tide you over nicely till classic unless you have other games holding your attention rn.
---
In one of the interviews I believe, cba looking for it right now.
---
Not sure why you're downvoted, your numbers are still off slightly but you're way closer than OP's numbers.
---
it may be even worse on classic when it releases, unless blizzard decides to do some heavy layering
---
Not really, my laptop is more powerful than most of my friends desktops, and I move around a lot so works for me
---
Are you seriously saying that alliance is better for raiding in vanilla?
---
People always minmax. You will have everyone roll horde for stupid racials. It will be 90% like in wowprogress. Nothing will change.
---
Your completely right. There hasn’t been a good MMO since Wotlk in my opinion. So many have tried but failed. 
---
I enjoyed a few but they never held a chance to what WoW once was.
---
In vanilla you could see what other party members chose to roll before the roll happens.
---
Because barrens will be super over populated with all taurens, orcs and trolls going there. Silverpine is a really good levelling zone, I'll probably go there at 12 as orc.
---
Buffs and offheals I think, in raids
---
I knew plenty of really good pvpers though, and I had a couple friends who'd tank dungeons. (though I had to rogue offtank on some pulls lol)
---
Then you'll be blasting mumble rap when you inevitably go back to bfa
---
I don't know about you man but its not getting ganked a few times on private servers. It's literally zones filled with skulls who gank constantly.
---
I think most people would agree that if you had a chance of fighting in a pvp battle then it wouldn't be bad but when all it is - is non stop ganking, it starts to suck.
---
I feel this on a spiritual level
---
I am this comment
---
I think yea, in most situations. The proc is just insane DPS. Maybe OP 2h is better on trash.
---
That reminds me, have they said anything about server sizes for Classic?
---
He literally said on his stream that he just wants to sit naked in IF and have people look at him
---
Sick MainTank healers, good buffbots. Decent tanks in 5mans (Strat and scholo specifially). Ret is good for pvp and nothing else.
---
They are cool, for sure, but the reason Omar gets the meme love is because he built the prototype that was the basis for giving Classic the green light.
---
To add insult to injury there isn't even a priest stream that I can watch on twitch. Every other class has someone streaming but no priests. Ok Blizzard I'll take the hit and start a twitch account and stream priest game play. Go ahead and send that invite...
---
Not everyone wants to camp a rare mob for weeks (against dozens of other people also camping it) to get tidal charm.
---
Well if you dont like it you can disable it ;)
---
lol okay fanboi. I too watch asmon, but only until he starts whining or being sarcastic.
---
i heard they are supposed to have between 2-3k players
---
1 Trivial tool vs 20x troll ability to down boss much faster. Yeah your pick.
---
We can't love on Omar for a couple of days? Chill.
---
horde has wotf and alliance has paladins. It evens out.
---
Exactly, from what I've seen from levelling two characters up to 20 it just seemed a bit tedius, never talked to anyone and the few I tried never responded, zones felt empty, I was pretty much half watching a movie half playing so I didn't feel like I needed to pay any real attention and that didn't leave me with a good impression thus why I'm asking here
---
He was the one who engineered a way to boot up the 1.12 in the modern client and it mostly worked and made the classic servers possible.
---
Not just Asmon and Tips - SO many more big wow names joining in.   
---
Venruki, Snutz, Stormx, Absterge, Monkeynews, Staysafe and many more!
---
Full on 40v40 action right now. 
---
Since I don't have the beta this is heroin for me.
---
I miss when people knew who we all were. Like it made us somehow important in the world.
---
Also meeting people IRL and having rivalry with the other faction players.
---
It absolutely doesn't require skill at all lol. Some of the shittiest players I've ever known got R12-14. One of the worst warriors I've ever played with was rank 14. He just had dedicated friends.
---
Perfect, thanks.
---
Blessings, Judgements, beefy off-healing &amp; near naxx era very efficient healing via crit gearing.
---
&gt; so will I be able to have fun as a tank and DPS as a paladin in vanilla? Or are they healers through and through?
---
you can tank normal dungeons, but you aren't gonna tank any raids. same with DPS, unless you have a super casual guild that doesn't care.
---
Paladins are one of the best healers in PvE just because of their mana sustain and probably the best PvP healer due to how tanky they are and how much utility they offer.
---
Lesson learned the hard way. I will bear this in mind for my next pepper challenge - thanks man. Hope you subscribed!
---
Only horde racials are good for pvp/pve.
---
What will happen is that you have many servers where you have 0 world pvp and wait ques 30 mins. Some horde servers can never enter av and that is fact.
---
Horde rogues are nerfed by humans. So there’s that
---
Meanwhile Varian is sitting on an island in Dustwallow Marsh being completely useless as the quest to find him and rescue him and restore him as a king leads to a dead end because it was never finished.
---
Yeah, hopefully if they do introduce TBC it won’t be until way after Naxx is announced.
---
I honestly hope they never go to TBC because that’s when I quit.....didn’t like it at all.
---
It's still going btw. Both sides are regrouping and have 2 raid groups.
---
I've had more than enough experience with PvP servers from 2015 to now.
---
Constantly being stressed and fearful of enemy gankers is not my idea of "insanely fun".
---
Ironforge always felt like the Alliance Capitol. In-Game because its more central location led to an increased population and lore-wise because, unlike Stormwind, Ironforge had never been razed to the ground. 
---
That and I was just kind of awe-struck first time I walked into the Great Forge. Darnassus and Stormwind just didn't do that to me.
---
For a lot of them, while they really played the game a lot, it was just that. Then you got other people, like Asmongold, who basically lived the game, getting to know every nook and cranny.
---
BFA are going to be cross realm...
---
&gt; Do I only have a chance at a beta invite if I currently have an active subscription?
---
If you also checked the Classic WoW checkbox on your battle.net beta profile, yes.
---
Rogue Rogue and Rogue. Mace build with mass of McGowan and the skull one you will wreck most ppl 1v1
---
it's bad, but not that bad lol
---
So you don't.
---
That and popularizing Skull of Impending Doom and those hand-glowy scroll glitches.
---
So I'm a fanboy for calling you out on writing shit that is objectively false ? And you cant possibly be watching asmon if you tune out when hes sarcastic, it's like 50% of the stream :D although I imagine you have a hard time picking up on sarcasm
---
Yet what i don't understand is why this reddit seems to have discovered this guy last week although he did this amazing panel at Blizzcon.
---
Did i miss anything major ? His interviews didn't add much out of what was said last year iirc.
---
What about the 500th thread asking about day and night?
---
Not just in this clip, but also in others I've seen aggro generation being totally broken.
---
It doesnt last long and you can counter that. Its so bad.'
---
How would you even use it example in wsg? Just use it everytime cd is up? You think rogue is always close to you?
---
Wotf is beyond broken.
---
&gt; It took work, a lot to get a character through 59 levels, let alone get them raid ready. In wow’s current state people level, and gear alts like it’s nothing.
---
That's because you've never actually played a sequel to WoW. You've been playing “expansion packs” that only add 5-10 extra levels on top of previous content.
---
With enough of these expansion packs stacking on top of each other you gate-keep/divide the population. So to put a band-aid on that you need to incorporate catch-up mechanics and tweaks to make it quicker to slog through 120 levels. The main game ends up in this weird limbo where it's both irrelevant and unskippable content.
---
To me this reflects a fundamental problem with the history of MMO design. Adding expansions to an MMO dilutes the player base across different end-game hubs and leveling zones. The original world ended up being self-contained and holistic. It was not designed to play well with increasingly stacked, mechanically disconnected “sequels.”
---
There needs to be a totally new paradigm for adding content to an MMO that isn't the traditional “expansion pack” model.
---
Can u add a blunt in there por favor?
---
it's because people spend too much time on reddit.
---
If I was you, I would play through Warcraft 3 Rain of Chaos and Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne instead. Get some real lore up in there. They're even remaking it, it's gonna release before 2020 if you're up for waiting for a bit.
---
But WC3 has aged quite well, I played it through last week and I loved every part of it.
---
I've set countdown widget on my wife's smartphone ... she has time to prepare :P
---
Snobs.
---
Idk I played a rogue all of vanilla and it def does effect you.
---
The first time yes.
---
Hours lost in bfd and wc lol.
---
Now that i know the way theres no point to a map.
---
For newbies though, they need to learn the hard way.
---
Howd this work out for you?
---
My view on the part about no talking during dungeon. When you type, you are mostly not playing, since in kind hard to type and click skill, since keybind don’t work while the text box is open. I prefer not loosing time and just do what I have to do.
---
Got eeem
---
Ahh the mayochup
---
I actually do have other games in mind, that's why I'm kinda confused  : P
---
Thinking about trying ESO.
---
If that is case then I have no problem.
---
But can you link me to confirm that?
---
You have no idea how important initial aggro is in Vanilla.
---
From my limited experience nearly everyone leveling has it on but doesn’t actually do any PvP. From 1 to 90 I only fought one guy. It’s very common to see other faction people with it on and you just pass each other. It’s basically only used for the exp boost. There’s also the occasional high level guy that flies around dropping in on low levels.
---
I literally watched a group of level 16's fight off a group of level 30's.
---
The game industry as a whole really does seem to be a big cash grab these days. Endless live services and microtransactions and game design that's more about keeping people hooked (and paying) than about making good and fun games. I mean, there's lots of good indie stuff (I still go back to play games like Limbo and FTL), but most of it's single-player and like, my GF and I like playing games together and we have such a hard time finding ones we actually like and care enough about to be invested in, so having a solid MMO, set in a world we both love, with strong community elements and enough good content to keep us busy and invested for ages... we've been waiting a long time for this.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little shit? I’ll have you know I gradually reach to the top guild on my server and in this game, been involved in numerous world first raids, and I have over 200 confirmed world first boss kills. I have played every class in the game and I’m the top dps, tank and healer in the guild.
---
You are nothing to me but just another casual scrub. I will wipe you the fuck out with skills the likes of which had never been seen before in World of Warcraft, mark my fucking words.
---
You think you can get away with saying that shit to me in the game? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting the best pvpers on my Battle.net friends list and your Battle Tag is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, scrub. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your characters and account.
---
You’re fucking dead kid. I can be on any server, anytime, and I can gank you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my PvE gear. Not only am I extensively trained in PvP and PvE, but I have played every class and I will use them to its full extent to wipe your miserable toons off the face of Azeroth and Draenor, you little shit.
---
If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would’ve held your little fingers. But you couldn’t, you didn’t and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn noob. I will unleash the fury of the cosmos all over you and you will drown in my crits. You’re fucking dead kiddo.
---
I'm sorry, which thread was that? You can't just reference something without giving basis for accusation.
---
Cant.
---
System will put your dot on the world map.
---
Go watch the dev interviews they or just search on Reddit. You make post complaining about something yet did 0 research.
---
Man was so badass his death got the very first WoW in game cinematic.
---
There was a recent interview with Ion where he stated that Omar locked himself away for a few weeks and emerged with a 1.12 prototype running on the modern client. His prototype basically gave the entire WoW Classic project the green light.

I think its the actual cast time is wrong then?

sounds like your guildie shouldn't of been an idiot

Mods: Previous post was broken, pic was bad, I've deleted and reuploaded this one.
---
ESO is a blast tbh and the game is very pick up and play friendly so you can drop it whenever you get bored or classic releases.
---
The less you know the funner learning it will be
---
So it's been a while (over a decade) since I was on the EJ forums but hit is incredibly important. It's a rogue's number one stat.  Grab precision without doubt. 
---
SnD is your number one source of DPS boostation on any fight over a certain length of time. Again the numbers elude me but if you won't kill the mob in a rotation and one or two sinister strikes it was generally considered better to use SnD.
---
Definitely take DW spec. 
---
You give up utility for dps if you take anything else first. With distract stealth is fine as it is. The other trees are for pvp.
---
This, and the debuff limit. Having static, "Nochange" is awful for actual progression if we know what sucks and what's OP indefinitely.
---
Alright, they did say it was done this way at Blizzcon but didn't told us who did it.
---
Ty !
---
How would I know. You vanilla fanboys cry about everything and now you are suddenly fine that there is crossrealm implemented but totally fine with broken racials.
---
I was set to agree with you but your post history is 100% negative, easy questions that have been answered 500 times in the past or complaining about other games.  You are a negativity spreader when it suits you.
---
Give me about an hour and I'll help you. Testing a route right now.
---
I agree. FF XIV has a great mechanic with the double xp up to 60, but you still had to do all the content, and invest into your toon.
---
I'm guessing it was the ''check out asmond get whirlwind while tipsout tries to stop him'' post.
---
This looks really good! Nice work!
---
LFG thread here, the wow classic discord, the classic guild finder discord, mmo champion, and wowhead are the main one's i've been posting on.
---
Already did actually, loved it too, I don't know why I just stumbled upon a few Warcraft lore videos about 4 months ago and that's when I started considering playing WoW and I tried W3 in the mean time, loved every minute of it.
---
I say go for it! You might regret it otherwise. I’ve been considering horde but I know I’m a Human paladin at heart. Some things never change.
---
When Destiny 2 launched with no social features to speak to anyone I realized we were doomed.
---
Lack of group loot...it is one of the best changes Blizzard made to the game since vanilla. I see no positive of keeping it as individual loot.
---
Arguably the lack of flight paths, but I will admit it does add the positive of increasing liveliness of the world with seeing more people traveling on roads. I know some people treat it in the same way as flying mounts, but I think flight paths don't destroy w-pvp and the little bit of extra presence in the world is hardly beneficial.
---
it's the only thing that warms my heart in these depressed days where most of us lost interest in our hobbies, because all we want to do is play the damn classic
---
Other pov??!!!!!
---
Gaming was better when the same moronic celebrity worship and mouth foaming defensiveness of your favourite players/teams that exists in sports fandoms wasn't a part of it
---
I forgot to touch on that, the social aspect. Server based communities made it easy to spot bad apples and weed them out.
---
Oh. Well, I don't think clips are interesting, so I probably just ignored it.
---
How would you know? You look up what you want to post before you post it because it’s probably been answered already. But instead of doing that you choose to be lazy. Its cross realm for bgs they made their mind up about and said that’s how it’s going to be.
---
Little one will be 6 just after classic release. Hoping I can get something for them to play on alongside me.
---
It was removed because of liability for payments. No sane company would pay to bring back a joke. 
---
It's sad but true.
---
No one who wasnt subbed during vanilla has gotten an invite. So if you are only subbing for a shot at beta, if you didnt play back in 2004-2006 you might as well save your money.
---
Yeah he’s a cool guy, his English has really come a long way in the last few years too. Cheers (:
---
Check the names broham, that wasn't me.
---
Wait until live. 
---
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
---
Alliance IS better for raiding in vanilla than horde, that isn't even up for debate :D
---
Hahahahaha this is fucking great. Thanks for making my day man :D
---
I think that is the case. I'm assuming the tooltip should be showing 3.5 sec cast time instead of 3 sec with 0% haste.
---
iirc, you had to actually press something on the roll window to get a drop down menu, and there check what ppl rolled.
---
Same. I play a game for like and hour/half an hour, get bored and frustrated and then go watch more classic streams...
---
Maybe don't make low-effort meaningless threads? You can try growing thicker skin, I heard that helps too.
---
Yea I'm seriously leaning towards that rn. The real issue to me is the subscription really, kind of unheard of paying 13 euros a month for a game in my country that's why I have so many mixed feelings about trying out a version everyone says is inferior while I myself have no real clue other than a small snippet from 2 characters up to level 20.
---
Pretty sure it's additive, orcs without the extra 15 didn't actually resist often as a rogue.
---
Wait wait wait..., a girl?
---
Being rich is more about ownership then work ethic
---
List me all alliance racials, other than dwarf priest.
---
It's not broken... CC generates a ton of threat, one white hit doesn't top a CC.  Silences and interrupts generate even more.
---
Honor Honorbuddy shutting down stopped a LOT of betting, though.
---
The day they shut down gold spiked like 300%.
---
These are great. Keep them coming!
---
Its RNG based on mob resist vs frost. That was a bird...which have the lowest resist on frost and highest on nature.
---
People need to understand that mobs in Vanilla had a high resists, a low resist and all the rest being normal resists.
---
Undead mobs for example, have high shadow resist and low fire resist, whit other resists being normal value. Human mobs have high fire resist, low shadow resists, all normal.
---
And so on.
---
Not impossible to froze a mob with low frost resist, even if 30 lvl higher. Especially if specced for 6% lower frost resistance to spells.
---
That’s awesome. I love hearing stories of stuff like that. What a legend.
---
This is wrong, you're 25% of the way 41% into lvl 38, 50% of the way 9% into lvl 48 and 75% of the way 73% into lvl 54. I used the same chart you did for the xp values needed for each level, you just did your math wrong.
---
80% of vanilla there wasnt crossrealm bgs so thats why I assumed.
---
But anyway doesnt matter now. I guess im fine with 20min horde que instead 60min.
---
Nobody wants to watch crappy streamers. A lot of them are hated on here. If you don’t want people’s opinions don’t post on the internet especially Reddit.
---
Damn. So basically it's impossible to figure it out?
---
No no no, ones time to discuss what Blizzard should do after Naxx.
---
And despite that still seems to not know what the fuck he's ever doing.
---
You don’t have to go to STV you know.  There’s many guides out there that specifically don’t go to STV until 36 or 38+ which vastly improves life expectancy.
---
No its stuff they added in later expension but you can disable and have the same vanilla graphic
---
This is how i remember the nights in vanilla.
---
You're definitely going to over-level, even with shared exp, but to answer your question, I don't think your missing any "zones" as far as key alliance questing hubs go.
---
Alright, I'll think about it a bit more, thanks for the help
---
I think Frostadamus is willing to test bugs.
---
if you wanna talk about a class thats actually op in pvp, then look at orc not undead. but alliance have just as many good racials as horde, shadowmeld and stoneform are very good, escape artist is just as good as wotf. and even human racial has its own uses if you were to scout out the enemy flagroom for rogues or to defend your own.
---
they shouldnt touch class balance one bit. the game is how it is and if you dont like it then dont play it, because when they start trying to change the game so that everyone will like it, then no one will like it. just look at current wow. just because a game isnt tailored to your specific needs doesnt mean they should change it. the game back then was made as an RPG and designed to be fun. when you ask for things to be balanced then classes become dull and boring because every class fills the same roles, again look at modern wow. just leave the game be and if you dont like it then play a game you do like, no need to ruin what other people enjoy because you dont like it.
---
I know right. Maybe WoW ruined every other MMO for me by being so good but I doubt it set the bar THAT high. It would seem logical for other MMO's copy the things that made WoW good but it has jut been going in a downward spiral.
---
Companies know literally everything about us these days yet they are still so blind to what we want. Or it is even worse and they know what we want, but refuse to give it to us because it's less profitable.
---
&gt; Thanks for coming to my TED talk. 
---
I lol'd. Totally agree on the basics of MMO's being ignored. I haven't "gamed" at all since Vanilla. A little League, FIFA, and some stuff on our Switch. All in for Classic though and we have a good group of friends who are joining.
---
#PALADINS
---
**This is the hero that we need.**
---
 I decided to try private server today and it has been the first time since few years when i talked to a random guy who was going to same direction as me and we started questing together for good hour or two.  
---
That's what makes vanilla wow great for me.
---
&gt;Unfortunately Blizzard is known to make horrendous lore decisions and turned both Garrosh and Sylvanas into warmongering retards out of the blue.
---
Both were unwilling leaders who had the mantel of Warchief forced upon them in times of crisis. Both did what, militarily, was right for the Horde by consolidating resources and stamping out enemy strongholds on their continent. 
---
That being said: yes. Both were asshats. Sylvannas more - so. She burnt Teldrassil because somebody said a mean thing. Garrosh didn't go off the rails (in terms of leading a people constantly at war) until the Old Gods got in his brain holes. Even the bombing of Theramore, while brutal, was a sound decision tactically.
---
Honestly, I just need to get into AV again man, that's all I need and I'll be happy (which unlocks at 51 anyway!)
---
That's not a solution and it's effectively what WoW does too. The *Stormblood* expansion famously introduced story-skipping and level-skipping items (kind of like Heirlooms and XP-pots.)
---
WoW also tweaked XP-requirements over the years to speed you through old zones. LFD was added to solve the real problem of never finding dungeon groups on your server because so few people were leveling through the same zones/expansion as you.
---
FF XIV is going down the same exact path as WoW, except people don't realize it because it hasn't stacked as many expansions on top of each other.
---
Even so I doubt we'll be seeing people casually walking around with 100,000 gold anytime soon in Vanilla.
---
Nowadays i'm considered poor for only having 100,000 gold in retail WoW
---
Liability for payments to who?
---
Argent Dawn is like the most famous EU RP server, It’s also the servers taliesen and evital play on.
---
Ok dude
---
Put another way, there's a strange sort of Happiness to be found when one has limitations imposed. Maybe it's a little Buddhist in nature, who knows.
---
That's why I added the "not the entirety of game development" line in my post. There really are some great indie studios out there with great titles. But the fact that the big guns out there aren't doing anything (or the bare minimum to hold our attention) saddens me :(.
---
uhh, alliance is better for PVE though on classic. You're comparing retail that has 0 threat mechanics as well as that people aren't going to switch races for any reason. The last "best" racials for pve were horde, and that's when everyone switched / started switching over if they were alliance since it mattered.
---
Right? Just try to translate Blind, swiftmend, shadow word:pain, or Nature's Swiftness etc to your native tongue...does it sound this cringe for people who speak English as a native language?
---
I can respect that. 'Fun stuff' can be subjective. I love raiding as much as the next person, but the beauty of Classic is, the raid content is never invalidated, which will give me time to enjoy the leveling a bit more.
---
Same, this is my memory if it!
---
I hope people are happy with horde having 30min ques for bg.
---
Also dont think vanilla is perfect. You can make slight tweaks to balance and make game better. You dont need to add lfr but you can give woth +1min duration.
---
Man I love the devilishi hihihihi, he's so pleased with himself
---
Good. Fuck Rat-man.
---
Part of it is also always that people don't want to acknowledge their burnout, so this really is Nostalgia tinted glasses. And that's absolutely fine.
---
Are you thinking about making other wallpapers? If so, I can make a wallpaper comp that changes in between a few pics via the wallpaper app on steam.
---
Cox and Crendor are both having fun.
---
Okay, dude.
---
They showed in party..not raids.
---
Sounds like a blast :). I hope I'll be seeing you in Azeroth.
---
actually no alliance is better for pve purely because of paladins. paladins lower your threat which allows you to do higher dps without pulling aggro. theres a cap on how much dps you can do so popping all your cd's and going nuts will lead to you potentially pulling aggro off the tank. the fact that you dont know simple things like this shows that you have no experience on the topic and shouldnt be talking about class balancing because you dont understand what changes even need to be made.
---
Coz then it's bfa not classic?
---
1. Precision helps greatly, regardless of what weapons you're using. With Dual Weird you're at a 24% base miss rate for your white hits and 8(9?)% for yellow hits. 5% makes a pretty big difference and you will notice it. 
---
2. I'd pretty much never use Slice and Dice while leveling, as you kill mobs too fast to have good uptime and have it be worth the energy. Most times you get the mob to around \~20-25% health and then eviscerate. I'd use Slice and Dice on any boss though, or while dungeoning if mobs are taking 20+ seconds to kill.
---
3. Dual Wield spec is worth it while leveling definitely. You can also take the reduced CD and it wouldn't change the talent path. What you could consider is also taking improved sprint which really only helps in PvP, so I'd take it if you plan on doing any sort of world PvP while leveling.
---
Completely skip Master of Deception, the talent is absolutely useless while leveling. Realistically you'll never really be stealthing while questing/leveling, as it's just too slow for a small return, especially while using swords (which 99% of rogues do while leveling). Camouflage is nice, but only really useful in PvP due to the same reason stated previously. I'll edit this with the 'meta' leveling spec that generally everyone goes.
---
Oh hell yea. Glad Blizzard gave add-on developers access because I can't imagine not having ElvUI. So clean.
---
Only a mage or lock would have got this. They were the only 2 spell casters. Their maybe one Spreist but that was still a rare thing.
---
How about having paladins? Salvation alone with fear ward is better than anything the horde gets for PvE.
---
Humans are the best PvE warriors/rogues as well due to +5 weapon skill on swords.
---
Were debating missing a few zones.  
---
Elwyn, Redridge and Duskwood are the 3 candidates, as we want our IF/Gnome rep and want to do all nelf zones cus they're prettyfull. But there such good zones we wont be happy about it
---
Private servers had a lot more forgiving Onyxia buffs etc than classic will have.
---
"People like interaction with other people? Who knew!?" - Blizzard probably somewhere around WoD.
---
Same.
---
dont think they said so directly, apart from people kinda assuming things based off wording. I might be wrong tho
---
Yes. I leveled a vanilla priest with an enhancement shaman tank most of the time to 60. Aside from dungeons with high nature resist enemies (mostly ST iirc) it isn't a problem in 5 man content.
---
thats the thing though. we dont want the game to be better, we just want it how it is. NOBODY is saying that vanilla is perfect because we KNOW it isnt. also the word youre looking for is "cooldown." duration would be making undead racial insanely op
---
Nope, there were more pvp servers at release, and more people on pvp servers.
---
* Are there plans to do balance patches at all? 
---
* I'm assuming the "hybrid tax" is still going to be a thing? (Ex: feral druid is for leveling, you go resto and innervate to get a raid spot)
---
Brian Birmingham is the most likable mofo at Blizz.
---
I am yeah. Next one will be Mulgore! :) I'll be adding them in the same gallery
---
For some reason I feel Shadw word: pain is especially cringe actually!
---
In one battlegroup? I think we had like 8 (Magtheridon-EU), but it depended on population and max was 16(?).
---
However I have no idea how many realms we had overall.
---
Probably the estate of Bob Marley.
---
&gt;I just don't get it... Reddit is begging for something new and amazing and this is what we get? A shitpost? SMH. So disappointing. This will be flavor of the second for awhile but until someone actually creates something new it's all just bs. Let shitposting die already....
---
Fixed for you.
---
Hi, /u/weirdalec222
---
Second
---
1 week after the GoT series finale:
---
GRRM:  "The show is the canon ending, I'm not finishing this."
---
Why are you even here? If you “don’t get it”, move along and go play whatever MMO you deem worthy of your time. Sorry but telling the classic community of your confusion will only hurt you.
---
And it's those little encounters like your story that you'll remember for a long time.
---
Oh yea they don't have raid wide buffs so you have to individually re cast them too
---
There's a rank 12 keyboard turning warrior on my private server. I've been able to solo him as a lock since I got 60 with lvl 40 greens.
---
It's 90% time, 10% skill.
---
Weird - this is exactly what most people say is great about pvp servers.
---
I mean look at STV - getting through it and out the other side is a huge levelling achievement on a populated pvp server.  On a pve server it’s literally meaningless as you were safe the entire time.  Achieving 60 on a pvp server feels vastly more rewarding than on a pve server precisely because you weren’t safe during that journey.
---
There’s a reason why back in the day they didn’t allow pve server chars to transfer to pvp servers but they did allow the other way around.
---
Don't like it don't play it. There is clearly a large population of players who will gladly play Classic.
---
That's retail, aiming for every spec to be viable, but at what cost?
---
Anduin is a literal kid in Classic though
---
Karma whore!..... I've left my upvote on the table, don't look at me on your way out you sexy sexy man.
---
The ugliest albino monkey kid ever, imo
---
I summoned him sometime during Legion with a group of pals it was absolutely glorious. We needed a few more people to perform the summoning ritual so we advertised in chat and pretty much the whole group ran to us to see Ivus march in his eternal glory.  
---
"NEED MORE FOR IVUS" 
---
Unfortunately, he wasn't tuned at all and got killed pretty quickly, but it was the best moment I've had in WoW in a long time.
---
I always thought it took me 14 days to reach 60 but man 22 days is hardcore lol.
---
I remember the first time I got into the Barrens, probably like 1 month or more into the game and I was like "there's sunlight in the game" !! I was so amazed.
---
Imagine feeling personally attacked on behalf of shit tier retail clickers who lie about playing vanilla for money
---
hahahahahah
---
Well by that measurement they got rid of PvE as well. 
---
It's an opt-in, "perma" flag system you now use (turn on and off in Stormwind/Orgrimmar) so all servers are instanced as either PvE or PvP.
---
no, stv arena but that's open for all.
---
this will be flavor of the month? considering people have been playing vanilla for almost 15 years, i think i have to disagree.
---
He's basically the main reason and developer for the Classic team to rework it into today's modern technology.
---
You don't have to be on here all day every day...
---
Yeah for sure, I myself am guilty of the nostalgia tinted glasses as well. But the fact that these basic dynamics of an MMO have apparently been missing since vanilla (arguably WotLK) is still at least concering. 
---
It's not necessarily Blizzard or WoW that has been going backwards, but an alternative MMO that is as good as vanilla hasn't been around either for all this time.
---
Green Jesus and BOY.
---
My guild two raiding hunters, for no other reason than all others quit.  But it is true, Hunters at 60 were awful, everyone hated you.
---
Great that there's no spell lag, since WoD for sure retail has struggled with large scale battles like this. Blizz attributed this to how modern spell architecture and the load that puts onto the servers.
---
just wait until classic, the leveling experience and game overall in BFA is very bad. classic will give you the experience that you want.
---
Things proccing off unintentional things was still an issue during the early stages of TBC.
---
That isn't to say that HoJ wasn't 'FIXED' in at that point but I know from personal experience that Seal of Command was still unintentionally proccing trinket and weapon procs for some time into TBC.
---
Awesome. Looking forward to it.
---
The guys who whisper you are generally real people though. I remember getting a QQ number from one of them.
---
From someone that is an absolute potato when it comes to mmorpg pvp (eso and retail), how should I prepare myself for classic pvp?
---
Where should I get information on how to setup my keyboard shortcuts or macros? Practicing movement/camera placing?
---
I want to play shaman, as it's the only class I find interesting, is there things I should keep in kind?
---
Thanks! Well I do enjoy stealth to be honest and plan on pick pocket a lot, not for damage boost or opener. I heard is a good extra money plus you get materials for poisons etc. I ll go for precision first then, and I ll think about what to do.
---
Shroud and TimTheTatMan are going horde as well when Classic releases.
---
Whole team deserves love. They're giving us something truely awesome.
---
You can have same fooliage in vanilla with -console command or edit of the config file. It is just easier now with User Frendly Interface botton.
---
nice b8 m8 i r8 8/8 an apprici8
---
R/whoosh
---
People really get defensive around the phrase Nostalgia tinted glasses. It's like when somebody accuses them of nostalgia, it's like they feel like they are being told their enjoyment is shallow and superficial and will quickly turn out to be fake.
---
When that's not necessarily the case at all. Nostalgia can provide endless fun and entertainment.
---
Atlas is a map addon thats been available since WoW Vanilla, give it a shot! It makes everything on the map easier to spot, like å satalite picture
---
Asmon was doing nothing meaningful during Vanilla. He said himself that he was on shit guilds getting nothing done until the end of BC when he joined a top guild.
---
Call me crazy but I am desperately longing for that first night where it’s raining and thunderstorms out IRL, have some snacks, a little high and playing this game, hopefully with a friend, and just seeing the world at night with the amazing music playing. Ugh can’t wait to play this!
---
I never really thought about it, but I'm very curious how access to information about  basically everything regarding Classic is so easily accessible now will affect the 'Classic-Feeling'. Very good video!
---
Your numbers on that post are wrong
---
What about Kazaak
---
Rule #4
---
It’ll be good of course, but I like to visit the zoo and not live in it.
---
Stop right there criminal scum
---
If you can't realize that is all an act for the stream then damn
---
Rip his gains
---
This is the first time you're realizing the gaming industry is a dump?
---
Ohh that option is nice to know too. I suppose that build is also better for leveling, maybe?
---
Mn had what like 2 or 3 R14 warriors at the same time?
---
To add onto that, wotf isn't that big of a pain for locks. I play Ally lock and barely notice it anymore. Sounds like op just needs to "git gud". Also, gnomes racials are literally the best combination of racials for PvP casters.
---
Abso-fucking-lutely.
---
In fact, all leveling guides strongly recommend getting Wand Spec + Spirit Tap as your first talents, alternating between the two.
---
Because of experiences I've had on fresh p-servers though, I recommend maxing out five points in Spirit Tap *before* starting the max out Wand Spec because it'll be damn near impossible to get wands that early on a fresh server.
---
ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, Alliance is infinitely better for raiding in vanilla. Thats just a simple fact. I can list reasons why if needed. The fact you alluded to UD being the most broken horde racial is telling. Orc is leagues better than undead in pvp. Troll racial is dogshit in vanilla.
---
If we are talking about pve racials are nuts.
---
Just jump into it when Classic releases :)
---
I remember that window. Was that available in vanilla already?
---
[Is this you?](https://i.imgur.com/qQ8sRtz.jpg)
---
I played in vanilla but lost the account to hackers a long time ago. GM helped me recover it and attach it to my current account about 6 months ago. So I have a vanilla account but it's not my main so idk if that would affect it.
---
This isn't vanilla. Arenas didn't exist until BC expansion
---
Stop posting Rat-man.
---
It's a little different than a group of 60s ganking solo level 15s
---
ah yes, good point
---
Yeah and on top of that you have to pick what spells you actually want to train, unless you want to be constantly broke. A nice little detail.
---
I, honestly, can't freaking wait. It seems like a blast and have been watching a lot of streamers play it.
---
I ran into the same problem a while ago. I think I fixed it by manually going into each realm until I found my old characters.
---
He didn’t break any rules. The gms of server started getting more money in donations due to having a popular streamer so they changed the rules just to keep sodapoppins happy. If you don’t like getting griefed in games I would stick to a pve server.
---
Bradley Nowell's estate. They aren't nearly as chill as Nowell was.
---
Yes, the coefficient depends on the specific item though IIRC. For example Shadowblade has a chance to proc a shadowbolt which gets stronger if you have +spelldamage.
---
Now that's a high quality video.
---
That's a setting. You had to check "Show detailed loot information" in your interface settings to see all rolls. If you had that checked, then you could see what other people roll before you decide to roll.
---
100% but he probably has the most hardcore / top tier guild that I'm assuming already has ranking planned out fully
---
By a cleaner look you mean a more modern looking?
---
The current gaming industry is incapable of creating good MMO.
---
As for why MMO's became terrible in last 10 years... it's pretty much all Wrath's fault, because every time developers tried to make new game, they copied Wrath formula because it was peak of subs... completely forgetting the reason why Wrath had all those subs in the first place.
---
With Classic, maybe we will see a renaissance for MMO genre... I'm still rather doubtful as gaming industry is at it's lowest I ever seen it right now... but maybe at least one good game comes out at some point... but if we take lunch of Classic as the sign of renaissance , the following it it will take at least 3 years for new solid MMO to come out.
---
But seriously, MMO genre has been in terrible state for many years, look at BFA... it's terrible, but there still not a single MMO better than it. And it's all Wrath's fault.
---
In modern wow it’s not really a problem because of shared tags. You can just poke a mob someone else is killing and get credit and loot from it.
---
A fun game called launching bnet to see if I got an invite.
---
I believe so. I might be wrong though. If it was, someone need to report it. I'll check when (if) I get into the beta.
---
Priest, Shamans and Druids are all fine, its down to your personal preference
---
Because you're obese.
---
Seriously. Sure, maybe this isn't the most productive beta testing. But he is getting Classic wow a LOT of publicity. He had &gt;100k concurrent viewers for his deadmines run. Yesterday, he went to the Karazhan crypt fighting level 50s with a ton of level 10-20s and had &gt;60k viewers.
---
Sorry, my point was not specifically regarding how long they played Vanilla (and how extrnsively) but rather the whole game since they started and until they stopped or even today.
---
While Asmongold may not have had actual raiding and similar experiences in Vanilla, he has been having them ever since TBC. He did basically all the content and essentially lived the game, doing PvE and PvP.
---
Swifty, as an example, only ever really played PvP AFAIK and didn't "live" the game.
---
An absolute madlad.

You can do both PvP and PvE with SM Ruin, optimally, they have a few different talents but if you want a spec you can do both in at 90% efficiency, I'd recommend it first (its okay at first and scales up with gear).
---
Nightfall/Conflagrate is also GREAT for pvp (with gear), it's very bursty and fun but you don't have a lot of defensive options so you just need to position yourself well and burst people down asap. Destro isn't good for PvE because the raid giving you a debuff slot for immolate is unlikely and fire damage is resisted by too many mobs in raids until you get to ZG and AQ.
---
Other good and much less gear dependant specs for PvP are SL nightfall and SL shadowburn builds. Different play styles depending on how you want to play. Good survivability and these are both less gear dependant that the other specs I've mentioned.
---
Some people argue DS ruin builds over SM ruin for PvE but I disagree. I think the damage difference is negligible if you're playing both optimally but SM makes you more attractive to a raid because you bring imps stamina buff to the tank group. SM is also better for 5-mans and MUCH better on solo play.
---
I''ll be playing SM Ruin because i love PvP and don't want to have to respect between raid nights!
---
You're a one-button heal spec. In dungeons you spam Flash Heal. Oh, and sometimes you Cleanse. 
---
That's why I'm rolling Paladin. Easiest spec in the game.
---
Arenas existed in the pre patch for BC. So Technically this was vanilla
---
" All female " gotta nut somehow while you grind..
---
It's 2 expacs worth of time, so really about 4ish years before you lose a name.
---
Lmaoooo
---
In my opinion, players like that have been coddled by modern MMOs a majority of their play time. They're used to these QoL features and don't understand why someone would play a version without them. I can see the argument when comparing classic with it's later installations, but that isn't the reason we want classic.
---
Us old players miss having a game, not a chore. Is old WoW grindy? Yes, but it's how we like it.
---
Gear mattered, professions mattered, talents mattered, first aid and cooking mattered, what classes you had and how you spec'd them mattered.
---
In MoP onward, they took this all away from us
---
 They stripped the game down from its core mechanics and replaced it with bogged down braindead and oversimplified versions of itself.
---
I'm happy that I get to play without NEEDING heirlooms to make the game even remotely enjoyable.
---
I get to play a game again.
---
&gt; From my limited experience nearly everyone leveling has it on but doesn’t actually do any PvP. From 1 to 90 I only fought one guy.
---
 Interesting!
---
I don't think we can blame the system if people don't want to fight. Nothing in vanilla PvP servers forces you to fight if you do not want to either.
---
At least I got chicken
---
Cant wait to go ally and kill chinglish all day tho
---
I love it. Feels like home man.
---
They say there is no such thing as a dumb question but
---
retail nerfed the ability to res at other GY than the one you spawn at after death.
---
I forget when. I've been meaning to test this out on the beta though
---
I think it's possible people break it later, but I'm doubting people do on launch?
---
Put on a dress and heal people. That's all you can do.
---
This is the most pathetic thing ever posted on reddit.
---
Pretty sure it’s ten percent luck, twenty percent skill, fifteen percent concentrated power of will. Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain and a hundred percent reason to remember the name..
---
People have been saying what you are saying for over a decade, now.  The rest of us are excited and looking forward to having fun, I'm sorry you insist on being bitter and sad little buddy!
---
Yeah whatever Im done with this thread.
---
We will see when horde will have 30 min ques who is right and who is wrong.
---
As always amazing video!  I’d say you pretty much hit the nails on the head with these but it actually got me thinking... what HASN’T changed?  How CAN we have that first time experience again even if we played back then?  For myself I was a rogue through all of Vanilla till Naxx and then my guild made me reroll priest... all of this on the horde side.  With that in mind I plan to go alliance for the slight differences in story and zones and switch up the classes and professions too.  It’s not much but it’s something.
---
I’m going to make my kids play classic to build character
---
Yeah, I don't see an extra button in the video I linked. but I know there was such a window at some point in time.
---
I play EverQuest on private servers. lol, casuals
---
I don't know what's going on in the Classic Beta, but in OG vanilla WoW, Battle Shout for AoE tanking was absolutely a thing.
---
We used Battle Shout for tanking Nefarian adds up until we stopped raiding ~1-2 months before TBC launched. The pre-TBC patch changed a ton of mechanics that affected raiding, including Battle Shout tanking. It was a common tactic before then.
---
You can still use stealth, but really you can get relatively close to the target, stealth, then distract + open on them and that'll be enough. I did that recently leveling up two rogues on other servers and it works fine. No need to waste 10 points that could be better spent elsewhere.
---
There is something called a pre raid best in slot (bis) list, which tells you what items are the best for your class you can get before 40 man raids. Most guilds might require you to have at least a good amount of these items before they take you in a raid. The D2 set is not on that list.
---
there's always hope. I'm pretty sure they will put out more waves before the launch, think legion and BFA had invites more or less up to launch, know it's not an expansion like they were but doesn't hurt to have more eyes looking for problems
---
It's sad that #1 your vanilla experience will not be the same as streamers is, it will be chaos with thousands of people trying to level. How many people even play the beta? like 500 on one server?
---
Actually it's a different thing entirely.  The old Outland was reaaaaaalllly far away in the ocean in either Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms.
---
It was patched out in 2.0.1, the pre-TBC patch.
---
Sorry to hear about your phone displaying the inferior faction's sigil :\ best luck getting a new one fam
---
This. When I heard that I was like wtf! Get him outa here. Idk who it is but he’s been commenting on esfand stream lately. So done with that guy
---
yeah i'm aware of the items, my guild isn't enforcing it as mandatory just suggested.
---
i'm mostly looking for something both stylish and functional.
---
Frost shock, self rez, Frost shock
---
I'm just not sure if this was implemented in vanilla or in TBC.
---
Nostalrius had a PvE server. I should know, I on was on it. It was on a different patch than the PvP server because the PvP server came out like 6 months before the PvE server
---
*somewhere around Wrath.
---
Thankfully not
---
This is gold
---
Idk if you’re being /s, but this is in-game art we are seeing.
---
r/BoneAppleTea
---
&gt; The vanilla client will run just fine on modern hardware - up until the point when you put some load on the CPU. Like when you're doing 40 man raiding. Or raid vs. raid PvP. Then it starts to chug hard.
---
My PC handled Vanilla raiding maxed out just fine.

I mean, it would be if it was serious...
---
Guess it depends on your RNG and efficiency of killing mobs for how much you'll overlevel, but don't let that stop you, if you can get enjoyment purely out of the aesthetics then don't skip any zones.
---
I sell gold for a living and I make like 750$ a day . It's insane what some people can make nowadays and how much people SPEND.

I made a strawpoll to see how far everyone got in vinalla wow before BC was released. I remember I leveled a tauren shaman to about level 15-16 (didnt do a single totem quest lul) then I made an undead rogue and got to level 42, then BC was released.

I don’t plan to get back into FF XIV, too much of an investment that I cannot afford now. I don’t plan on investing a lot into Classic, then again this’ll be my second go-round so I’ll have a much better idea of what I need to do to lessen the burden.

This subreddit is overmoderated

Crushing blows are also the main reason bear and paladin tanks had a rough time in vanilla. Without shield block, there was no way to become uncrushable.

Also interested in finding a guild before launch...any resources would be great.
---
I see.. dunno if private servers were correct, but I tried a rogue on private servers and the detection range of mobs was too high. Distract help, but if you go into an area with lot of mobs and just wanna pick pocket I still had trouble sometimes cause of distract CD.
---
I will probably get them after level 40 and adrenaline rush and will respec when 60 :P. If I remember correct, lockpicking last skills needed tyrs hand pick pocket. I will do this before respec.
---
Most likely yes. His imp was also out of it, but that’s karma for ganking I guess.
---
link?
---
Former Stormreaver/Korgath Alliance here. Anyone else out there?
---
I've been thinking about whether Classic will be their only attempt to bring back old content. Even though this is said as a "labor of love", I think it's important for Blizzard to see it as also profitable.
---
Looking at it from a monetary value, what are the ways they make money on Classic? Obviously people returning to WoW that had left. But what about people that never left? The monetary gain there would be only from giving them more to occupy their time, i.e. time is money (time = sub longevity).
---
But Classic will not have pet store, mount store. MMOs have barely raised their monthly sub cost for many years. These cosmetics are why the game isn't priced at 20 bucks a month now.
---
I guess one good thing about Classic is that once they get all the patches out, the dev team can just be a skeleton crew of server admins. So cost would be low. But there's still a cost for hardware and internet. I wonder how they will measure how many people came back only for Classic. I guess they could see which games they log in.
---
My gut tells me that they will eventually want progression servers to reach the era of their online store, so they could put progression specific goodies for sale on it. But I guess we will see, right now Classic is the only one.
---
I feel like Classic just by itself isn't going to be nearly as profitable as mobile, for example, and I want Classic to affect their decision making going forward. I want Blizzard to see a strong monetary future in re-releasing old content.
---
Oh my mistake. Yeah they are, and i vaguely recall some easy ghosts in SFK aye. Not sure tho.
---
bro you literally dont have any current vanilla knowledge. Which is fine, I can assure you It wont be doom and gloom like you think. TBC on the other hand is literally 75/25 in hordes favor. Alliance is really good. Factions are really balanced in 1.12. 
---
So relax:)
---
Thats the exact map I wanted. Guess theyve updated maps further from when I stopped on retail. I was under the impression that vanilla had no maps when entering the dungeons and pressing M would shold the zone the dungeon is located in. Wc showing barrens for an example.
---
On another note: You come off a little arrogant in the last piece of your message Im a little sad by that. So unnecessary.
---
Rat-man and whoever the fuck Sodapoppin is can both go fuck themselves.
---
Not sure what interview it was, think it was with Ian and a lady where he said that the layers would each contain aound the vanilla cap so 2-3ish as said before I guess
---
I put a link in the link section when I was making the post but I guess it didn't show up.   
---
Updated the post now should be there
---
My 2011 macbook pro could play WoW all the way to Legion and it ran decently. I even managed to do some raiding in WoD with it. I'm not able to run BfA because you need the latest update to the OS but that can only be downloaded on 2012+ macs I'm pretty sure. If you have anything thats 2015+ you should be able to run it fine.
---
It's a copypasta you idiot
---
This guy is from vanilla for sure. Now that is how you troll.
---
7 honor for a first kill of the day. Man you guys 20v1'd that poor sucker xD
---
Really enjoying all the beta streams from multiple streamers. This was insane. I was watching both streams and asmongold's group just got deleted. On top of that notice how there wasn't even that much lag. Can't wait to join myself.
---
Well it’s game design 101 that has been around since the beginning. Putting god mode on in a shooter makes the game fun for about 15seconds and then it becomes incredibly boring. We knew this in wolf3d and Warcraft 1 30 years ago. The point is getting the balance right between reward, difficulty and convenience. It’s not easy to get right. You could say it changed dramatically during WoWs first 5 years and depending which player or dev you ask you get completely different answers about which is the best.
---
China numba one!
---
Do you use bots? That's crazy either way but absolutely crazy if you make that by playing yourself
---
Oh aight, personally I think T1 is very stylish for shamans
---
horde got wiped the first 2 engagements before that though!
---
Its just a battle :\^)
---
Didn’t he say he was a Vanilla Virgin?
---
Sounds great! I appreciate any time you can spare :)
---
This is why I'm so excited to classic. Retail-skilled PvPers finally pushing vanilla to the limits.
---
fair enough
---
You ghosted him....
---
i like most of T1 but the helmet is a yikes from me, i hate it honestly.
---
but i guess i'll accept it if i have to.
---
Definitely split.
---
What boots are those? I recognize everything else but I can’t place the boots
---
Private server detection radius does seem absurdly high, but that should just be more of a reason not to go into those talents. By all means if you want to though go for it, but there are better options if you're worried about damage/leveling speed/etc.
---
has happened alr
---
I hope someone on Classic does a test of this, how much rep is being gained from quests, and how much rep is needed to buy another race's mount. Is it even possible at all on Classic? Can a gnome buy a saber mount from Darnassus?
---
Is WoW more GPU or CPU intensive?
---
No, I have a live sub and have done for three months, I just haven’t purchased the most recent expansion.
---
Wow! Thank you so much for such a detailed answer which also provides context regarding both the PvE and PvP scenes, I'll do some more reading but I'm pretty much in the same boat, I'd like to about respeccing as much as possible :P
---
it's really fun to watch, having 30 level limit forces players to focus on something else given there is no normal end game, and streamers are... well, good content creators.
---
A level 40 cap would be really interesting imo, I hope they incrementally bump it up each month so we can see these little dramas play out!
---
Lmfao
---
When I leveled a rogue in retail (wanna say it was tbc, but not 100% sure), I was able to still get a pick pocket + cheap shot off even if the mobs spotted me.
---
It’s cool to see but it’s pretty manufactured, it wouldn’t hold up to weeks of playing, there just enough to do. There’s no point trying to do harder dungeons because you can’t equip the drops and we quest/gurub fighting is really just because it makes for fun stream content - itll get old pretty quick when people realise the bigger Zerg always wins.
---
You literally dont know what you're talking about and here you are.
---
You won't get one, the amount of baseless rumours and hearsay that's going around Classic is truly awe-inspiring.
---
By the way, have you heard that they will allow the option to name-change?
---
Best healers in the game in most scenarios
---
Probably [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18714/ancient-sinew-wrapped-lamina) ;o
---
Oh please, if anyone argued for cross realm bgs, it was these two.
---
Sounds like you just used the 4 kwadrants of the useless pie chart I made before this one. That one shows the total XP in which case you're right about what you're saying. This chart is normalized for mob xp each lvl.
---
you and me both brother
---
meanwhile streamers are getting 5 subs a minute just hopping around on beta...
---
People are constantly hating on streamers and streamer servers but shit like this is pretty cool.  (Asmongold was in the other raid).
---
Ahh mb, reddit app loading 240 quality images it seems. Now i see!
---
Fuck streamers. They suck.
---
don't keyboard turn, in fact id reccommend rebinding A and D to strafe, make sure you're always facing your target. for shaman specifically you'll have a lot of different spells that will only be used situationally, and totems are your lifeblood of course. ele/resto is the prefered spec in PvP.
---
Yep. I love this kind of gameplay. Endgame instances became just so overwhelmingly OP that it kind of messed with the 1-60 experience.
---
Your comment reminded my of a complaint I once read on an old ArsTechnica WoW thread from TBC. It struck me as such an interesting perspective that I copied it. Let me go find it.
---
Here it is:
---
&gt; “IMO what killed Wow were the patches that added new 40 man dungeons, thus making gear the only way to progress in the game. BWL, AQ and Naxx are just some of the things I never visited as a long-time WoW player, because of my real life schedule and were added only cause the hardcore players whined and moaned about it.”
---
This is also why I strictly [twink low level PvE characters](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/ignorebrain) in retail.

Comment section as gold as always.
---
Agreed, i have literally never watched twitch before but now i can’t stop watching and once everyone has BiS there is a ton more content they could try and push.
---
Ideas include rare elites or even world bosses with 80-120 man groups or capital city raids, because everyone is low level and there is really no specific end game content to forces people to work together to create content.
---
It's not been said as such, but the goal of layering is to disappear. It won't happen if there are still 9000 people online all the time at the end of phase 1, so one of the solution would be free transfer. And that will most probably happen for streamer realms.
---
\&gt;Pretty sure it’s ten percent luck, twenty percent skill  
---
if you stopped there the joke would be cooler
---
what is the biggest (dis)advantage of playing both Horde and Alliance?
---
I heard if you hit 60 and don't like your class anymore you can just change it. Free of charge.
---
With 2 party members each person gains 60% exp
---
5 people its also closer to 25%
---
This is what I remember too. I dont remember lower level dungeons being that tough. If they were tough it was because your healer lied about their ability to heal the instance, or because people didnt know to get out of the room when the guy charges up his fire death spell
---
Wow, thank you so much! Was looking for an old character of mine earlier, but had no idea which realm i had him on!!
---
I played regularly up to early Cata and there were always considerably more PvE servers than PvP servers. Simple numbers folks. Considerably more PvE servers=considerably more players on PvE servers
---
I know that horde will have 30min ques. 
---
You will see.
---
Those were the exception to the normal. Where as in anything since wrath the zones are wrapped around the arching story. So everything ties into each other.  Where vanilla almost nothing ties into each other
---
Yes, in a general sense.  I wouldn't try playing the latest Battlefield or something on a laptop if I actually cared about maxing out graphics and having good framerates.
---
As far as running Classic?  Probably not.  Even with the modernization, if you have a halfway decent laptop with a dedicated GPU (like any good laptop these days will have), it isn't going to be an issue to run the game.

---
I'll test the skip today.
---
Nah, I prefer to gank the old-fashioned way. Using /tar macros and hunting them down by anticipating where they will try to rez and run to
---
In some areas, yes. I think it looks bad in places like Barrens.
---
Looks a rather cool in STV.
---
This right here, I had a human Warlock, and remember one time running down that long road in Duskwood, a naked UD rogue started chasing after me, he eventually killed me, but it scared the hell out of me..
---
imo that's probably a smart call for a popular streamer. Otherwise they risk a 24/7 gank squad from the opposite faction.
---
\&gt;when the unfinished ~15 year old version of the game is more "Battle for Azeroth" than retail
---
that must sting
---
new arathi warfront design looking good though
---
The destruction build is not good for leveling because it's not mana efficient at all, you'd have a lot of down time drinking. However if that's how you want to play that's not a big deal. Warlocks are very good at self sustaining themselves so no matter how you level it won't be too hard. I recommend experimenting and respecing and having fun. 
---
I think the standard best/easiest way is considered to go into demonology to get improved VW and then the rest into affliction. Once you get to like level 40-50 you can get soul link and level demonology/affliction until 60. However, that's just the community's consensus way because of efficiency. Like I said earlier, no matter what spec you are you'll be fine. Some just make you eat/drink more and some are better for dungeons and what not. Play around as you level, but I definitely think focusing on demonology fully isn't a good idea until you can get SL.
---
Do you mean while levelling or at 60? Feral is pretty good while levelling, but yeah once people start unlocking their specs it’s going to be hard lvl 45+ to gank warlocks/priests/shamans/pallys as a feral. Rogue is obviously the best choice if you just want to kill people and escape getting camped. Warlock/mage/hunter/priest are all fine if you don’t want to spend half your time in stealth but want to kill things.
---
replied to you on the post
---
These are so good LMFAO.
---
Good to know thanks
---
yea you know, I mostly play rogue because I like the stealth aspect. I like sneak around, getting past everyone, steal, etc. I like the theme and class fantasy. And I feel like a rogue without deception and camouflage is not "truly" a rogue. On the other hand I do not want to hinder myself and have hard time leveling, thats why I asked and it seems like I have no option.. either I will go for fun or efficiency.
---
My group asked me to report it ;)
---
It is definitely not mayo
---
You're not supposed to be worried about gankers, you're supposed to do the ganking.
---
I don't have beta access, but the itch was strong, so I hopped on a classic server. Now I know for a fact that all of the rose tinted goggles crap I've been dismissing for a decade was wrong. The feeling of adventure, the immersion, and the danger of the open world is every bit as good as I remember. I get why Blizz took WoW in the direction they did, but the the spirit of the game was lost when they made everything but top tier content convenient and easy.
---
I've demolished a few people already, have no fear.
---
what are you saying? you can’t overwrite dots and refresh their ticks?
---
You say that.. yet there are literally 15 omar threads on the front page.....
---
Tons of bots.
---
24 days as resto Druid that quit the game twice in frustration and then came back when I saw my friend doing mc. This was before Druid rework though so honestly feral wouldn’t have been much quicker.
---
But it's tomorrow now here.

Not diablo, diablo 3. D1 and 2 are sure as fuck very atmospheric games that feel like an rpg. and 3 was made by a different, revenue-oriented team. Actually people were saying diablo 3 looks like world of warcraft regarding atmosphere and gameplay when it was released. It’s come full circle I guess.
---
Quit your whining. Being a classic beta white knight isn’t going to get you invited. Enough already.
---
It took me 14 days on my first character, I think I was taking my time to level up profession though.
---
I hadn't entirely read what you posted and I thought you were going to roll a Paladin for your own poo emergencies.
---
I guess I'll have to try healing out for once in my life...
---
The idea of keeping a team alive while also being nearly undestroyable in PvP sounds good
---
I love this. Even though I prefer being alliance, this was still rather enjoyable. The fact that we can do this massive world pvp type things again is something I've definitely missed and now that we have people that can gather people up for these events, like streamers etc, we can just fight a lot and more coordinated. People may hate certain streamers, but as long as they can create events like this, I don't care.
---
Lucky enough my wife is playing Classic with me, even so she is trying to get me out of the house as much as possible before release. "I know you won't want to do anything for at least 9 months".. yep :)
---
you're living in cloud cuckoo land, try running the game on anything older than a 5yr old system, let alone a 15yr old system, then come back to reality and apologize. It will be a joke, just like you.
---
I’d be interested to know as well. I’ve got a MBP Mid 2014 with Retina display and intel iris. Is there any way for me to test if the game would run ok? Thanks
---
First exp nerf was during tbc, I think they did it again. Could be wrong.
---
Took me 12 days on my mage
---
Its not true right now, because blizzard fucked up battle shout threat.
---
alliance have worse racials for pvp
---
horde dont have blessing of salvation for pve, so they will struggle until their warriors get thunderfury to hold aggro
---
Yeah seriously, end game in World of Warcraft should just consists of raid after raid of the same difficulty tier and giving the same Tier gear Rewards.
---
Has Blizz announced server names?  Have streamers said where they plan on playing?  I want to stay as far away from their nonsense as possible.
---
The only disadvantage I can think of that really matters is that you can't share things between characters. Also can't be in the same guild and play with the same players you usually do. 
---
Even the sharing items thing has a way around it. You can put stuff up in the AH in tanaris because that's both factions. In order to exchange money though you need to be risky and put up like a shitty green with a really low buyout price than quick switch to your other character so they can go buyout the item at the super cheap price before anyone else. Then they can sell the item at a normal price and make a huge profit.
---
But how do I make friends as a new player.
---
You have seen the 15th anniversary collectors edition right?
---
Its like all the comments are from a non classic fanbase
---
It’s a slippery slope, you think you want that but you really don’t want to follow it.
---
Should've read "I never said BFA..."
---
More accurate to the source and for meme purposes could be an ambiguous panel until Thrall goes Classic kek.
---
10/10 willing to bet you’re the kind of dude who gets beat by purge spammers because you run out of mana yelling out “ THIS CLASS SUCKS “ while rank 1 BoM sits in your book unused.
---
Imagine not knowing how to disengage and drink or use mana pots. 
---
Your information is incredibly biased and your attitude is not any better, I’m willing to bet you think retribution can’t do damage with sub 10% mana pool too? 
---
I can understand offering advice on alternate builds like shockadin ( great and really fun spec) but going around and commenting on things you have no idea about and attaching preconceived ideas of what you think and not know about a spec/class performance leads to toxic meta culture.
---
Nonsense. There would be many groups of people with a different idea of what the "right mix" would be. I don't want it; I want classic, with all of its awesomeness as well as all of its warts. Some of those 'warts' are what make other aspects of the game great.
---
I figured as much I'm jk.
---
nah the balance is gonna remain the same, based on 1.12.
---
Have you been watching me?..
---
How many times do I have to spell it out for you? Modern hardware is different.
---
Made it to 60 during Nax content. Only ran UBRS once or twice as far as progression went. Was very confused what to do at 60 and with TBC around the corner I mostly just putzed around.
---
And 60% math degree
---
10 days I think
---
No, it's demonstrable that PvP servers have always had a signficantly higher population than PvE.
---
Asmon plans to play PvE, at least he was before the beta came out.
---
asmon bad LOL gotem
---
8 days played, took 2 weeks IRL, lucky me EU release started during winter holyday in my country. Was 1st hunter of my server to reach 60, 6th players of the server. I did no grinding, only quest.
---
I was LS horde and I remember heading to tyrs hand on my druid to farm the Gold farmers.  They either paid for backup or this was you guys b because for a long time there were several hunters there with them every day
---
About 12.5 days
---
Which is why i vouch for a 'no-stream' option when choosing realms, would be amazing.
---
Man, getting a Druid to 60 before the rework turned me off from them forever.
---
bfa is straight trash. as if more proof was needed
---
I hate how this guy exhales after every word he says.
---
If you know someone that can get me in, help a bro out.
---
I mean, you might be speaking sarcastically, but power-creep is a real thing. I don't have a perfect solution to it, but don't discount the idea of an MMO focusing on other avenues of content-creation.
---
I know making comparisons between MMOs can be really silly, so take this with a grain of salt, but EvE Online is a great example of an MMO where content is “released” that is all the “same difficulty tier” and gives the same rewards.
---
It all boils down to what an MMO developer wants to emphasize in their world. Is progression important? Is farming important? Is player-generated content creation important?
---
These are all valid solutions to the problem of creating a changing MMO.
---
I don't know what angle people are coming from when they say that Swifty doesn't remember much, but does one really need to PvE to "live" the game? I mostly PvP'd in vanilla, got R13, and then at the tail end joined a top guild and got a bit into Naxxramas. I really didn't ever do anything like "clearing" MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20 and even parts of AQ40 because the guild had all of those on farm when I joined, and I quit that guild after like 3 months as well. But I still remember every single boss vividly just because that time of my life meant a lot to me and my memory isn't crappy.
---
Probably Swifty's memory is just crappy.
---
don't compare GY to that elite.        https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425939728?t=09h51m10s for soda fighting that elite, though hes slightly lower level and in cat form for that attack he took ~99 damage. Doubt being 3 levels higher isnt going to make him take 50 less damage on the hit I'm pretty sure
---
People who play on private servers calling other people mentally ill. Classic indeed.
---
I think max graphics is what I will be going with but I will change some things like the lighting and especially the water. The new water looks a bit metallic.
---
Epic.
---
Sick
---
Force ALL the streamers onto a single realm and let then all be there with their army of neckbeards.
---
It's cause he's comparing a mob that normally has always hit super hard, compared to ones that don't hit as hard normally

---
250ms? Did you have some kind of secret direct fibre connection to the US?
---
I had Optus cable and averaged between 350 and 450ms.
---
So excited to make my mage 🧙🏼‍♂️
---
I turned it down almost immediately. The ground clutter makes it a lot harder to notice small quest objectives sitting down there.
---
every day refreshing battle net and seeing you are not in yet is a torture feelsbadman
---
&gt;I mean look at STV - getting through it and out the other side is a huge levelling achievement on a populated pvp server. On a pve server it’s literally meaningless
---
You are playing a videogame and all meaning is derived by the experience of the individual playing, and ultimately it's all meaningless.
---
I play videogames to entertain myself. Not to be entertainment for someone who enjoys wasting other peoples' time, especially when the gankee has no chance at fighting back against the ganker.
---
Getting ganked by lvl ?? isn't exciting for me. The result of the fight was determined before it started and anything I try to do is *meaningless*. 
---
This Normal vs. PvP-server debate comes down to personal preference, whatever floats your goat. If you enjoy it, I wish you the best, but your personal taste doesn't prove one server options superiority over another. To me pvp is about exciting as watching paint dry. At least the paint will dry regardless of whatever I do, and isn't such a tedious endevour. I have no interest in starting shit with the opposite faction and wish they'd do the same to me. I just want to collect my 10 bear-asses.
---
Troll starting area is the valley of trials.
---
Power creep is unavoidable. It's built into the game as the game has levels ascending and gear ascending with levels. And that's the thing about MMO's, each player gets to determine what is important to them. And many players get turned off by having so many different options at endgame in for example battle for Azeroth, so many different things could be important that they feel compelled to do everything and get burned out faster. Vanilla we know has much fewer options, you are limited, and some people find a paradoxical kind of happiness in that limit.
---
It looks crap but good at the same time xD

In the wow tab under 'REGION / ACCOUNT' There should be a drop down with BETA if you got access. You won't get a mail or anything like that. You might or might not have to restart the client.
---
The Horde doing Thrall's work.
---
 Very few people have beta access, no one knows what factors into getting into the beta, other than the fact that content creators and media are given special invites. Invites seem to go out in waves every few hours. The access will pop up in the little tab where you select your region. Use the sidebar.
---
I spiritually connect to this image.
---
Asmongold's PoV
---
Man, I'm progressing Jaina atm for my first ever Cutting Edge and I lost all kind of interest once beta was announced. I'm just hoping if I do manage to get CE then it can become somewhat of a leverage for a good Classic guild to pick me as a hunter for raids, or something.
---
Asked if there was a plan to do it once we actually can do such a thing.
---
Mmos are high investment and high operating cost experiences.  Mobile addiction machines cost little to make, have little overhead and have dumb fucks paying 50 bucks a month to increase the rate their farm produces potatoes.  If it wasn't for mtx I'm not even sure we'd have AAA games anymore.
---
true. Don't really mind the smaller streamers
---
&gt;gank person
---
&gt;now they spend their time actively hunting me down and ganking me back, thus wasting even more of my time
---
great plan
---
&gt; gold in wow is worth more then bolivares
---
There isn't a great deal left in the world that's worth less than Bolivars sadly. Their currency has collapsed massively.
---
Classic is far superior.
---
Wait.
---
The private server community is largely the reason why blizzard decided to do classic wow in the first place, you simpleton.
---
I hope we get some sort of list of these servers for those who want to avoid em.
---
Fear ward would like a word
---
He's referring to going straight from menethil south to the coast of Dun Morogh and then dieing at some specific spot I forget, thus sending you to a Dun Morogh graveyard, then you can just talk to the spirit healer.
---
I don't have beta so I can't test that :(
---
I mean, you’re dead wrong, but it’s cute that you think that.
---
20 something day I think? On a tauren warrior
---
No it wasn't. Parodies are considered free use.
---
My best guess is that it got removed because of the implied drug reference.
---
Sounds like you should invest in lottery tickets then!
---
Anyway, apologizing instead of escalating regardless makes you a much bigger person than pretty much everyone here on reddit, myself included, so props for that.
---
I didn't use your pie chart, I just looked at the xp needed for each level and combined xp for subsequent levels
---
Am 19, running a mage with my friend who is running a rogue and all we plan on doing is ganking people as soon as we hit cap :)
---
I may be getting my streamers mixed up but there was one bragging about being top na and then when they got in beta they were clueless
---
... none of them? Literally everything is online and can/will be updated organically as the meta changes
---
Later in WoW a common mechanic was one of your spells refreshed other spells, so casting mind flay refreshed sw:p. Because dot damage was calculated on application you waited till all your procs and trinkets and CDs lined up to cast the dot, and then you could keep that one dot rolling at high damage for the entire 5 minute fight by refreshing it with your normal rotation.  
---
The mechanic of calculating damage at cast is in vanilla, but there's no spells that refresh a dot, you have to cast it again, so it doesn't matter that much. You still want to cast dots after you trinket, but it only effects one cycle so it's not critical to dps.
---
a long cooldown that can be purged, meanwhile wotf cant be purged and can be used inside of fear/charm. also shamans have tremor totem.
---
Insane watching that live. PoV was awesome from the side on Payo as well. Multiple views!
---
Been reading up on em all, I'm thinking undead priest, because Undercity is badass.
---
Not familiar with the reference then.
---
I was never a member but I remember always seeing your guildies around! I was in Unknown on Kor'gall, sadly we never got to Kel'Thuzad but we didn't do too badly in Naxx.
---
that was the greatest charge
---
Hunter is will be more useful in all areas of the game. Enhancement is for leveling and that’s it. If you don’t plan on going elemental or Resto don’t bother going shaman.
---
So don't level a druid, I guess?
---
3 mo than till my boi Vol'Jin is alive and well.
---
Yep, it could happen ;) also I could be in the hospital still, who knows. At least the cafe has great food!
---
I (Azak) phased in weird in this clip. I didn’t join or leave a group. Any thoughts on what happened?
---
To think this guy was a classic naysayer, he's is one of many who are going to perform a full 180 on their doubts for classic.
---
Hahaha. I can totally imagine 10 year old you sitting down waiting and waiting for your pet! 
---
Your story reminds me of when I first came to Canada from Jamaica when I was 9 years old,  and all the kids in school were drinking water from the drinking fountains and I didn’t know how it worked so I bent over near the faucet area and waited... and waited and no water came lol.
---
Enhancement shaman is really bad at 60, idk what guild you're joining that even accepts one. Its terrible in PvP too (please dont link a windfury highlight video fro 2005). If you actually want to contribute to your team/raid go hunter. If you want to be a walking meme who sometimes happen to get a nice crit combo go enh shaman.
---
The sauce that comes on a mcchicken is mayonnaise.
---
Yeah I later levelled a warr in 8 days and it was so cruisy compared to that original druid. I also wasn't as terrible which helps.
---
Pays with obtains?
---
Adopts the flowers and plants
---
We converses?
---
post more screenshots pls
---
Thank you for your videos! You’re one of the very few people on YouTube whose new videos being released get me all excited.
---
Ahahahahahah okay man
---
Anyone got a TL;DR list of 10 differences for people who can't watch?
---
Not a fan of ableist stereotyping but yes, those rogues are the worst
---
I had just over 90k just before tbc..its possible, but very very unlikely even to have 10k just before tbc.
---
&gt;Because ganking a 40 man raid with 15 guys and wiping their buffs is one of the most fulfiling things you can do in any MMO?
---
For you. I have zero interest in the opposite faction, let alone their buffs. Griefing others doesn't bring me joy so why would I try to make their day worse? 
---
I have nothing to gain and my time to lose. And that time would be wasted irregardless of the fight's outcome. I simply don't give a fuck about them or their buffs. If you enjoy it, cool. I'm glad we'll be on different servers.
---
&gt; Power creep is unavoidable. It's built into the game as the game has levels ascending and gear ascending with levels. 
---
This depends. There are many ways to design an MMO. You don't necessarily need power creep to define an MMO. Progression might be a really popular way to make an MMO, but there are other MMO experiences that don't rely on it.
---
&gt; And that's the thing about MMO's, each player gets to determine what is important to them.
---
I agree. But we might be talking past each other here. Both things can be true: The developers of an MMO can prioritize a certain experience while at the same time the players might be asking for another experience.
---
&gt; Vanilla we know has much fewer options, you are limited, and some people find a paradoxical kind of happiness in that limit.
---
Right, but even that is subjective. The user from TBC that I quoted from, he felt that 2006 Vanilla ruined 2004 Vanilla. To him, endgame instances ruined the community that was created out in the world before the heavy emphasis on instanced content.
---
I didnt say anything about bfa, if they did what i suggested it would actually take gold out of the game and make gold more valuable in vanilla
---
So to sum up there are 3 possibilities for this talent
---
1. You get the drain soul mana proc irrespective of whether you or the void kills the target.
---
2. You get the drain soul proc mana only if you kill the target (pet needs to be put on passive).
---
3. You get the drain soul mana proc only if you kill the target with the drain soul spell tick (and not with a tick from corruption or agony).
---
I understand that Classic will contain the 3rd option. Am I correct? In such case, it may be better to abuse the mp5 rule instead of casting anything.
---
I really doubt they'd open beta without level cap, however idea of big stress tests seems possible
---
I can't fucking wait man. I literally dont know if I can survive 3 more months of waiting :*( plz blizzard give me beta.
---
For those wondering what this "easter egg" is... here is a summary.... During blizzcon 2018, they showed two gnome rogues. One was named July and the other Osconty. Osconty is a level 16 rogue according to the armory profile and there is a youtube video of Osconty killing Patchwerk in Vanilla on July 16. Put it all together and you have an "easter egg" for July 16. Links below

I did a funny dance and then a hand stand. Promptly received beta access, within minutes. This must be the way to go about it.
---
&gt;\#1-35in classic is the same as 1-120 in retail.
---
You can duel from lvl 1, don't even need to level.
---
How do you talk? I usually exhale while talking. Never heard of someone inhaling to talk.
---
Loving it! I have been watching both Asmongold and Venruki at the same time for a few hours now. Can't wait for Classic and proper open world pvp! Blizz let us in!
---
Nope.
---
why are you so negative?
---
i think he ment litteral Battle for azeroth as in World pvp
---
I had like 35 days played on my level 45 warrior lmao I was the fuckin worst

55% there's a 10% bonus, which is fairly new to theorycrafters.

---
But everyone told me modern wow servers cant handle 15 people fighting at once and it all lags like hell and then a GM restarts the server??
---
Ahh, my hometown.
---
I just wish we'd get a RPPvP server. I want PvP but I also don't want to deal with retards named 'Waifuhunter' or similar.
---
I think I was slow af, at 32
---
Well, one can hope :)
---
by the time you're 60 it's winter (at least where i am) and that's where the real fun starts in BG's.
---
Do you know about the macros? Will they be current style?
---
Be happy you got into the beta
---
* Autistic Screeching *
---
or if they opened up WSG for "testing"
---
Forgot to laugh
---
So do you have to sign up for current WoW before your able to play Classic?
---
ASMONDGOLD GET HIM
---
I played a private wotlk server for like 8 years! Are you telling me there are worlds you can't get ganked? 😮
---
no streaming in the rules/ToS is incredibly stupid. what if a guild wants to stream their raiding progression? oh, too bad, you can't.
---
what's with all the streamer hate? every server is going to have streamers of different populations on it. just avoid the server with asmongold/sodapoppin.
---
Doesnt have to be without level cap.
---
You actually do get a mail letting you know you're in the beta. I wouldn't have noticed otherwise.
---
Yea doin a whole lot of good dropping combat...lol
---
And you don't rank 1 bless you rank 1 seal
---
No crossrealm failed also (BG’s) and they implemented that waaaay late and fucked it up
---
You sould see the APES movie, thats pushing vanilla to the limit, verry good video.
---
It’s on Monkeynews YouTube channel
---
Have some raiding ones and stuff (terrible Molten Core runs mostly lol) but here is one from my PVP guild. We ran it so much that we started making friends with alliance and fishing with them sometimes in BG. https://imgur.com/OyI8R0V
---
Modern? Most modern UI mods like ElvUI are just streamlined of what Bartender and the like had in vanilla.
---
God damn it this looks so good
---
Day 1 player.. did PvP grind to r12 and raided until cthun kill in aq40.. burnt out of wow at that point so no naxx40..
---
if you're talking about physical guides... none of them. they're based off the original patch and they've been heavily outclassed.
---
oh helllll no lmfao, I dont see anyone getting 100k gold atleast for a good 10+ months and thats only ONLY if they are playing the ah 100% of the time on one account and then farming/skinning things at the same time on like a hunter for 18hours every day all day. otherwise no one will have that kinda gold for a long ass time unless too theres a streamer getting it funneled to him from thousands of viewers and players. Also in classic people are gonna spend their gold like its nothing because they think they'll get alot later. They'll see a nice tasty green for 2-5 gold at lvl 20 or so and thats all they got. BOOM BROKE ASF lol
---
Some BiS items are literally lvl 40 to 55 before being able to get better loot from raids.
---
That's the map the addon Atlas will provide, not the in game map.
---
And you come off as not fucking hearing a word we're saying lmao.
---
Cool thanks for reply. It seems Orc is still supreme haha
---
Good point that seems quite likely to really put batching and queueing through it's paces. Would definitely be fun seeing asmon premade vs soda premade at lvl 30 lol.
---
*barman*
---
Oh really? They said that they wouldn't send out mails.. Interesting. Thanks for reporting that.
---
Yeah, other MMO's can certainly try things but because of Wow's size and longevity it has sort of become a model in many ways. And it affects, based on when and for how long people play it, it affects those people's perceptions of other MMO's and other games in general.
---
no one cares 🙈

Hillsbrad, arathi, desolace, dustwallow(?) are all alternatives to stv.

and given that he's playing a human that's only 1-2 items with spirit on them.
---
I got to like level 56 and I remember being so happy to almost be max level but then TBC came and the level cap got raised.
---
It's a testament to how good classic wow is that people can find a lot of fun stuff to do at any basically any level.

Everything is a hunter weapon
---
no shit
---
Thankfully, been waiting so long!
---
Imagine this being your life
---
What? Every streamer right now is loving classic what’re you talking about?
---
I leveled a paladin and for whatever reason I remember pretty much auto attacking my way to 60. It was not super enjoyable but yet also was, lol

I'm embarrassed that I've now just found out where REEEE originated from!
---
Yeah well everyone knows Europe is made-up so I think we'll be good
---
Legend.
---
Even the speechless interactions, like everyone spreading their buffs on people who pass by, are greater moments than retail wow. You know getting that Intellect buff from a mage that gives you more intellect than all your items combined... it really changes the game at this time.. you run to do as many as you can before the buff ends!
---
You clearly dont listen to blizzards posts. They mentioned in the past that they have always had more pve than pvp players
---
EU are definitely getting shafted, but i can confirm a friend with EU account also got a beta invite.
---
This is actually a good idea, people that work all day and want to catch up with the latest classic action can get their fix watching your vids.
---
Go into each realm in-game? What did you do inside the realm to find your character? I think I will do this.
---
That's the Battle for Stromgarde we wanted. And instead we got this crappy Warfront...
---
hey guys thx for the insights but i think i phrased my question wrong. i meant to ask what is the (dis)advantage of having an alt on the opposite faction.
---
yeah there's really  no other way to put it. blizzard wrote (and is still writing) the book on MMO success on the level of WoW. And it took them more than ten years to finally decide to mine 'the last bastion of player-hungry content', the way private servers have been doing for the last ten years. Go back to the beginning and see how much more money they can make.
---
And I'm all for it. Other people can have their new fancy MMOs or they can not play any in protest of there being no 'new, revolutionary' MMO design...but I'm old and quite ready to settle in with something comfortably familiar.
---
These massive battles have been so entertaining today.
---
Sure, if you can stay focused to level at max efficiency for 16+ h sessions in a sleep deprived state, which seems highly unlikely since most people can't be focused for even a fraction of that time. Still impossible to do on release tho since servers will be filled with people.
---
I don't think updating spelleffects is a good idea. It then becomes kinda meh to spot buffs and debuffs, and easier to notice stuff. I'd rather it be a bit harder.
---
Proudmoore here. Don’t remember my guild name as I was a dumb 18 year old, but I remember a guildie named Squallstrife.
---
Sweet. I want one.
---
His feet are bigger than his head lmao.. Totally forgot this model of anduin
---
At least an open beta weekend (for subscribers probably) seems very likely. They need to crush the servers/layers/starting zones and get a feel for hype and player numbers for server numbers and that's the perfect way to do it.
---
Actually the lag is an interesting point.. back during large world PvP (especially when the honor system was released) the server lag was bad to the point of turning the game into a PowerPoint presentation.. (TM vs SS)
---
i believe it was actually one of the technical reasons BGs were released. If 2019 hardware and modern engine could handle large scale world PvP its one of the few classic changes I wouldn’t mind. That change being no BGs as it contributed to removing world PvP to an extent (by design) as it was much more efficient farming honor in BGs.
---
This is not an unpopular opinion. I have been preparing for server first 60 so I can destroy all enemies in STV. I have my level route planned and already plan on protecting the weak in STV. I will wage the war on south shore. World pvp is the purest most fun pvp experience.
---
Most people just transfer money and do the opposite, put up a crap green for 2,500 gold. In theory you could have been reported for doing that on a PvP server because back then you could not have both factions on a PvP server. People used to pay for two accounts to do that.
---
I always loved boosting in dungeons my guildies with my level 60.. I was happy see them getting their drops and feel excited!
---
My hope is that we see tons of wpvp like this in the official game.
---
If I am a player who hasn’t had a wow subscription in over 10 years. Buy a wow subscription, is there a chance to get a beta pass or are they simply done handing them out to players?
---
Are healers expected to DPS in dungeons? I’ve gotten used to doing so in the Mythic+ era, while I never really did anything but heal before. I’m not sure if that’s just because I was lazy/casual/bad, or whether the game was designed like that in prior iterations.
---
No changes
---
Spot on. Can't believe how accurate it is, I also play Dota auto chess to kill time and watch streams classic beta.
---
It was both.
---
This assumes the Amazon discount and stock is available a week from now.
---
It was the plague lands like 95% of the time now that I think about it. I was a lock though.  Perhaps we had a few run ins?
---
the alliance is exactly that, an alliance of independent rulers (king of sw, king of if, king of gnomer and the ne) united  against a common enemy whereas the horde has a common leader (warchief) the other races are united under.
---
I played wow for 8 years on a Mac. It’s not a difficult game to run. You’re good.
---
You will no doubt. Grouping with people is an easy way to make friends in game and classic is all about that.
---
You can't have both on one server.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipQBFDb_SFI
---
Didnt we see lot bigger battles in FBFA prepatch and first \~months into xpac?  
---
Because i remember random 15v15 battles going up to 30v30, when people still played it.
---
Is there a tier list for pvp classss in terms of best. Also tier list for best healer, dps, tank?
---
It's a very, very minor upgrade for a shadow priest dagger, mainly for PvP, that would replace Lok'amir il Romathis (that drops off of Nefarian in BWL).
---
Mages and warlocks at that point in Naxx would have the Blessed Qiraji Staff or Sharpened Silithid Femur from AQ40, or Staff of the Shadowflame from BWL.
---
I'm having the same experience but I'm using my lack of interest in other games to get my studying done for an accreditation test on Saturday. Hopefully I don't get a beta invite this week.
---
The little race icons are delightful
---
Whose is aggressive? Should you not point out that at level one you might need 1,000xp to level, and at level 59 its most likely millions?
---
Do you also get an email when invited to the beta, or does it solely show up in your launcher?

All I gotta say is PvE is dead in any private server community. Why wouldn’t that be the case now if those are the players who are moving to retail?
---
Classic does not hold your hand for leveling at all, so grabbing a leveling guide wouldn’t hurt. You’ll be running all over the place.
---
i do remember the battles you're talking about; they were ruined either by sharding or by servers going up in flames 100% of the time
---
changes. Yes I would be against it.
---
A pretty sad attempt to fish karma just because your last post got 300 points :/
---
Edgemasters Handguards are epic lvl 44 Mail gloves and they're basically BIS for Fury Warriors all vanilla. They go for 4-5k on the AH
---
If this would have happened in BFA the server would lag
---
Phase 1?
---
Last I recall the items were still in retail.. a vendor in area52 sells them for transmogginng purposes.. not sure if their stats got changed though over the many years. But you should be able to find them on wowhead etc
---
operator error.
---
.....not for like, the last 13 years?
---
There was massive wPvP battles in BFA, yes.
---
These anti BFA circle jerk memes are about to get me to unsub. Classic will not sustain, because it didn't the first time. 
---
I'm interested but if this is the kinda shit that gets posted, why even be here?
---
Can you imagine downloading 12 gigs with dialup? Good lord.
---
Bonus, you get Devouring Plague as their racial priest spell
---
Link doesn't work
---
oh do they change that throughout vanilla??
---
This is embarrassing tbh. I'm just glad the Classic team is devoted to a true experience, even if the *some* of the playerbase may not be.
---
Best WoW videos out there. Thanks for making them for us.
---
He's older than most and it's been 13 years...
---
Can someone please try to convince me to use Add-Ons?
---
I hear a lot of the goods of the inconveniences or the "hard" aspects of Vanilla, yet using Add-Ons to help or change the way the game was meant to be played sounds hypocritical. 
---
I'm not an expert on this as I've never used Add-Ons myself, so hopefully I could get a different opinion on this.
---
As far as I know you still have a chance to get a beta key if you have:
---
1. An active subscription to World of Warcraft
---
2. Checked both World of Warcraft (retail+Classic) checkboxes on your [battle.net beta profile](https://eu.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html).
---
They indent to keep the closed beta relatively small, so chances of actually getting access are rather small. 
---
Many people will tell you that it's not worth the gamble if you have no interest in retail at all, and they are not wrong - I subscribed just for the chance of getting a beta key anyways 😛
---
So glad to see the server isn’t shitting itself.
---
The Arathi pvp i'm watching on Asmongold's stream is running well, but there are times of lag with all the people there.
---
Ooh right, I misread that. I did the GY hop waaay back in early 2005.
---
I'll have to try it out in the beta, I did want a nelf in elwynn at as low a level as possible to maximize rep. And I wanted to send a human to teldrassil. Did a lot of wall climbing on a pserver to test it but I think that technique won't work in classic.
---
Then you should've seen sodapoppins wailing caverns run, it was way more chaotic and was a true depiction of how vanilla dungs is going to be. 
---
Also the dungeons aren't tuned correctly, so they will change it, which is exactly why there is a beta. Come on, use your brain, ofcourse the beta isn't going to be what classic will be, that's just common sense
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?itemsets
---
Just look for any itemset that has either "Warlords" or "Field Marshal" in it.
---
There are many brands with models available housing the latest top end cards, cpus, ram, etc that can easily put out 4k in current gen AAA titles at max settings, what are you talking about?
---
Since this is using the newer engine, how are macros handled in Classic compared to Vanilla? Are there good examples of macros that worked in vanilla that don't in Classic?
---
I just tried to go into the realm, and if it gave me the character creation screen, I just backed out and tried another realm.
---
As I told the other guy in that post. I don't care about karma at all.
---
I've been watching Asmon and Venruki's stream for an hour. Highly entertaining back and forth battle going on!
---
OH my GOD. I missed this so much. I can't wait to return to Azeroth
---
Did they stopped sending invitations ??
---
Best time, bro
---
I love venruki but I mean... the dude hit like 2 people with the first cone and 3 with the second and then two AE's.  I wouldn't consider this too insane.
---
Nhr
---
I always try to explain to people that if they have the space for it in their house it's much better to buy a desktop pc + ultrabook, you can get that with about the same price.
---
Nowadays there are options because more and more laptops have thunderbolt3 slot so it's becoming a reality to just game on that and buy an external GPU. GPU has always been the bottleneck on laptops, not the CPU.
---
Because last time I was positive we got WoD.....
---
About 2 days late Zack Zwiezen.
---
Damn. The problem is I don't have my old login info. My account now is not the same as before.
---
This is exactly me too!  Played some league but it's just not the same.
---
Theres no expectation since there isnt a timer to beat (with the exception of the 45 minute baron run).  Probably q case by case basis.  If your tank is good / well geared and you can get away with itx it defintely doesn't hurt (plus just standing around if they aren't getting hit hard can be boring lol). But if you don't have the mana to burn on dpsing nobody should question the healer onlu healing.
---
This. There was a private server that did this and it was so much fun. Each week the level cap got raised 10 levels. This resulted in new BiS gear, new builds, new classes that were dominant, new meta. The low level content that you normally rush through or completely skip was now super important and rewarded you with BiS gear. I discovered quest chains that i never knew was in the game before and getting blue gear from dungeons felt as good as getting epics from raids. The 20,30,40 bracket was so much fun because the gear was quite easily obtainable allowing everyone to join in on the fun.
---
BFA servers would have crashed immediately
---
He said on an RP-PVP server. He’s not saying every server. How is it fair to allow people that have a massive base of followers to strong arm and entire server? Back on the day you didn’t have someone with a sperg army. Multiple servers should have no streaming rules. It is a huge change to classic and most people should be no changes. If you have alexensual and his whole grief guild on your server you will have a great time seeing that I’m right. Streamers bring manpower that didn’t exist in vanilla wow. They can play, but you should have an option to avoid them. Streamers are change to a game we demanded had no changes. Those who are ok with it can play with them, but there should be an option for those who care.
---
Just the launcher
---
Shit is entertaining as fuck
---
The foliage physics are an unwelcomes change. Not too thrilled about that tbh.
---
Most people see it show up in the launcher and then get an email the next day.
---
Battle for Azeroth has no real battles.  Not like these...

---
doesn't seem to be lacking to me
---
You can in retail, but you never could in Vanilla. They mentioned it in a blue post.
---
Hunters aren't too dps, they should be below all mages, rogues, warriors and locks. 
---
Hunters will only be good on the first clears in mc, after that every class will have good gear and hitters will start to lack behind
---
36 days /played, rolled end of december 2004, hit 60 in like...june I think.
---
My biggest memories of it was a trash pull in strat, and like a week later friends in a raiding guild I'd been a part of leveling up (then left on good terms when I realized that that life wasn't for me and an RP guild was more my speed at the time) invited me to a kazzak kill.
---
rolled a 37 on doomhide gauntlets and won them
---
Nope. If heals aren't needed, healers should be not casting at all in order to activate the 5 single mana regen tool.
---
We had boss mods in Vanilla.
---
But not J. Allen Brack.
---
he's a tool.
---
I found out via email but gmail filtered it to promotions
---
I feel like Blizzard should force all the major streamers onto the same server.
---
Some languages and cultures talk while inhaling. At least a word or two.
---
you can hide it if you'd like
---
What is “phase 1”, “phase 2” etc?
---
To be fair, there are more MMOs like that than not, so...
---
For someone who started playing WoW with WoD and Legion and is pretty casual, how tedious will micromanaging a hunter pet/ammo be in Classic?
---
It cant handle 40vs40 without lagging exactly like retail lol.
---
This is what happens when Retail players migrate to classic beta
---
Kala is streaming priest.
---
every class is good in their own specific way
---
warrior is the best (only) tank really, aside from feral offtanks.
---
best healers are also different for different situtations, palis have good single target, shamans have good aoe, priests are good all rounders.
---
warriors/rogues/mages are the top dps but you need to have other classes for other mechanics too, so yeah, tier lists are kinda irrelevant.
---
I didn't own a phone so I couldn't watch Blizzcon, this year I won't be able to attend.
---
Well, the reason for private servers being able to contain more players than retail is uptime of the server, which was very low in pservers compared to 1 standard week on retail. Also spells are very heavy to handle on retail, its not big issue on Classic/Vanilla, so there is hope for that.
---

---
They’ll also all burn up pretty quick. Laptops just don’t have the cooling required to run a really high end, graphics intensive game day in and day out. I know this, unfortunately, from experience. Now I buy desktops.
---
And on that token, if someone in the beta hits a mob before me and it turns to grey, I have 0 interest in helping them.
---
I don't know the jumps in wsg were legitimate exploits as long as you knew how to do them. It would also not be nochange if they do change it.
---
I would check out kargoz’s discord. Many people there are interested in duo leveling and have already researched optimal paths that might help you.
---
Me too. I really want to raid and I’m able to put in 20 hours a week however my days off will consistently be Monday and Sunday. :/ Hopefully I can find people in identical situations as me for raiding.
---
Horde players are basically mobs that are in the game only to entertain the Alliance heroes and to advance the plot.
---
Very good point.
---
Do Paladino's have to wear cloth to heal well?
---
We all know that the United States is one big reality show made for our entertainment, not a country
---
&gt; or are you just making things up?
---
slow down there, I understand my post comes off as passing misinformation but we all want classic to be authentic as possible.  :)
---
&gt; Do you have any proof that higher level mobs have increased damage against lower leveled character
---
ya, you actually provided the proof
---
&gt; they just do their own damage but each hit is crushing
---
I did a quick googl and found this 
---
"A crushing blow is an attack made by an mob or NPC that is 150% of the damage caused by a normal successful attack. "  The wowwiki included it happens with mobs +4 levels above the player so I would count that as "increased damage".  Many others did point out about ranged attacks not having glancing blows as well.
---
With the corrections with other people in the comments I didn't feel the need to comment any further.
---
&gt; last post made 6 hrs ago, did fairly well. 
---
&gt; literally just copied same format for new post but added two new faces and catering to Horde circlejerk with title.
---
 No offense but if this ain’t sniffing for karma then I don’t know what is. It’s like you reposted your own post lol.
---
Holy shit are you me? I finish a match and boot my bnet launcher to see if I get in every single time. I feel like an addict in need of a fix...
---
Itemization.info "high warlord" "grand marshal"

Darrowshire, with the little girl’s ghost? One of the plaguelands
---
Its kind of hard to define and very subjective, but I would say I mean... tidier and tucked out the way... less intrusive... hard to notice unless you actually look at it... Take away the bar art and let me move and rearrange the bars as I want and thats a big way there. I know. Not really a definitive description but about as good as I can do 5 minutes before bedtime. :)
---
34 days played for my OG NE Rogue. I spent a ton of time at 29, 39, and 49 doing wsg and exploring the world while ganking. It was incredibly fun but it made me not want to level an alt due to it taking so long. Besides thinking a hunter and war at 29, I stuck with my rogue until the BC pre-patch came out.
---
10.
---
No one bids except on very rare items like BoE epics. Use the buyout system or it'll just come back to you in the mail.
---
I think we're gonna see more world PvP than in vanilla because this time around it's a primary factor that's drawing people to classic. I can't wait for the PTSD
---
They've already stated that they won't allow exploits to be in the game. And that was an exploit for sure. But we'll see I guess.
---
If you do level a Rogue, pickpocket everything right off the bat. The amount of silver you get early on from that is rediculous.
---
This looks like an absolutely amazing tool, I'll be creating a character on Northdale soon to test this out
---
And this is why they are only inviting a few players.
---
Hail the true King , Azmongold!
---
its been about 60v60ish
---
Something like this open world PVP happening in Arathi right now wouldn't happen on this scale without streamers in this day and age. Playing on a streamers realm has massive advantages if you enjoy world pvp honestly.
---
Careful, Gnomes can hide in that grass pretty well.
---
I see your point, thanks for taking the time to say why.
---
*runs back to guards any time a fight happens*
---
ok ty
---
doesnt matter if what they report is intended or not, blizzard has a working 1.12 client from 2006 to check with to see if its actually a bug or not, so if its meant to be that way then it wont be changed regardless.
---
Get a cooling pad and don't literally try to use it on your lap
---
I just bought a gaming laptop for the same reasons you described, and heat is not an issue. CPU undervolt, cooling pad, external keyboard and it gets better temps than my desktop, maxing out at high 60's in benchmarks on both the cpu and gpu.
---
AND it's a model that has a reputation for runnign hot, the Predator Helios series.
---
It all fits nicely in its backpack and isn't a pain to lug around like a comparable Mini-ITX would be.
---
I mean it's your setup run it however the hell you want, but when you're saying it's not reasonably possible to have a laptop that crushes modern games at high resolutions, that's just blatantly false.
---
This sounds like it's coming from somewhere? Care to share?
---
Not exactly Vanilla, but TBC beta with Vanilla model.
---
I think people get defensive because it's used in a negative setting and ultimately the reason why so many players want Classic. As if everyone is going to quit once the nostalgia is over, and realize it's a shit game.
---
I don't doubt that a lot of players want Classic for nostalgic reasons, but for many of us vanilla offered a game experience that no other game after it has been able to provide.
---
There have been a number of discussions and memes about "the next big mmo" and "the wow killer" for over 10 years without any game even coming close to it. Just an endless torrent of hype and letdowns.
---
\*Waits for allies to start farming on high level mobs to ambush them\*
---
Am American, can confirm
---
bis is robes for a large portion of the game
---
We have to get the Quin gank squad.
---
Itemization was also pants-on-head retarded.
---
Afaik they're written in the same way as in BFA.
---
They change
---
So some have multiple stats throughout the versions
---
And they're not all released at the same time
---
You should be able to find values...Whether or not that lines up with the phase of classic you're looking for is another question
---
Ugh. I mained warrior back in vanilla. I'm gonna miss that axe and sweet shoulder piece. I'll be running library for that sweet staff though.
---
ohhhhhh
---
You gotta give him some slack, I know a lot about classic cuz i stopped playing after Ulduar, and I have no idea what kind of changes happened after that, while Swifty never stopped playing i think. So its hard to remember how classic exactly was when so much happend since.
---
It’s not an act, people need to stop using this as an excuse.
---
Expecting “in-game” screenshots as proof! ;-) Awesome stuff!
---
Still less bad the private server players...
---
if u like hunters pets are a labor of love, u have to tame different pets of different levels to learn new pet abilities. ammo is not that hard just stock up every time ur in town.
---
Time to open a ticket then lol.
---
How do you tell when your account was created?

At leas this guy has balls to  take it to the chin. Humans are allowed to be wrong, you know. In fact we are very good at it. Being able to admit your mistakes and do the right thing in the end is where it is.

Server instanced? Personally instanced.
---
Hi, /u/UbiGeofram
---
And where is the little ofc?
---
\- Phase lengths?
---
\- Realm sizes?
---
\- Sharding length clarification?
---
\- Has any change been made towards gold farming in dungeons? (Maraudon, Dire maul, BRD)
---
\- When is the loot table updated (Diana's pearl necklace etc)?
---
even though the game is balanced around patch 1.12, the content will be released in phases, whereas in 1.12 (the final patch of vanila) all of the content was already out.
---
https://i.imgur.com/6c6cSPz.jpg
---
I believe there was an interview. Id have to dig to find it because it was video. Not really interested. But of course...nothing is confirmed till its out. Lol.
---
But it would make sense. With layering expected to stop at the end of phase1 
---
Could be dead or way over populated or unbalanced pvp servers (which they could potentially only do it for pvp for just after phase one and then youd have to pay). 
---
Unfortunately its all “supposedly” and rumors till it happens.
---
I’m having the exact same experience in beta. Can’t wait for live now!
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/DeliciousClearDumplingsPeoplesChampv
---
If it were on bfa servers the servers would be super laggy and the raids would be split into separate shards...
---
Can't wait. There are some flaws I don't prefer and don't agree with, but overall it's going to be so much better than WoW has been in a LONG time.
---
If by gold you mean cancer, then yes.
---
ahaha yea man they also have flying cars and eat bitcoin for breakfast
---
IMO don't use them until you really feel something you're missing out on. It will put you at a disadvantage compared to those that burn through, but the game doesn't have to be a race. Just enjoy it.
---
I made it because someone asked for it.
---
that's the whole point of the fight LUL, so they cant get the elementals
---
I guess lol
---
This is really well done!

At least this is what it was like for the OCE servers, we had twice as many PvP server as PvE and the Pve servers only ever managed low-medium pop while every Pvp server was full.
---
Np
---
This looks like an awesome tool, I'll be testing it out on private shortly, thank you!
---
I think the point of the whole thing is them having fun, and exactly this is happening :P
---
he already did. others have quoted him saying he was wrong
---
&gt; &gt;when the unfinished ~15 year old version of the game is more "Battle for Azeroth" than retail
---
Retail frequently has 100+ world pvp battles.
---
You just need to know where to look.

It won’t happen. Blizzard won’t tell people they can’t stream on certain servers. They want more exposure not less.
---
I never said otherwise.
---
That's nice. Still going to avoid what server they'll be playing on.
---
It's still evident on live.  People downvoting me are just childish
---
Pretty cool idea. Already see a few people I recognize on my old servers.
---
Amazing. Not any lag at all. Beautiful!
---
In p-servers you could mess with the console command and turn up the foliage. However, the foliage view distance is low and not as high as the one in the current beta. If I recall you could also turn up some other settings too but they aren't nearly as good as the settings in the beta.
---
Definitely better. 3v3 of perfectly matched players is boring. 3v3 of 3 random ally and 3 random horde in the same zone is sick.
---
J. Allen took balls on the chin?
---
wasnt that for paladins and shamans

And if you're playing the opposite faction to say asmongold and his little posse rocks up to a zone and just smashes you because they have 90 people literally following them everywhere, and getting corpse camped while he levels the area with essentially bodyguards is not going to be fun for anyone. Let alone if your the same faction and can't get a quest done because the gang is just tagging and killing everything in site.
---
I get that the streamers can bring a new sense of community and everything, I don't want them to not be able to do their thing. Just have a streamer dedicated server that won't cripple normal people who don't watch them, or don't want to compete with sweaty fan boys. If Blizz only release say 6 or 7 servers and the streamers are on all of them, it won't be a good time for normal people. That didn't exist in vanilla, occasionally in higher level areas BRM UGC there would be guild wide PVP last for hours. But not just a roaming band of people following one guy.

I’ll take it a step further and say I’d prefer no BGs at all.. I made this post in another thread about the large world PvP on beta server in arathi highlands, for context.
---
&gt; Actually the lag is an interesting point.. back during large world PvP (especially when the honor system was released) the server lag was bad to the point of turning the game into a PowerPoint presentation.. (TM vs SS)
---
Asmon talks about loving it but never seems as into it. he just shits on BFA and does his usual shtick whereas Esfand is just smiling and happy in his game
---
Yes I am aware that finding the name of the NPC vendor would be the solution to finding the items, but not a single web page about High Warlord or the other high ranks has links to or any mentions of said vendors. Which is why I was unable to find the info since I don't remember the NPC names after like 15 years.
---
Both are equally stupid groups of players
---
lol you wanna PvE 13 year old content that bad?
---
Just stay on retail you're making my point...
---
I mean if they were gonna rework the raids or something, blizzard does that well. But PvE doesn't age well. It's literally just a race so you can end the raid faster hahaha
---
Addons will ruin the classic experience, but people will use them anyway so they can get an advantage. They'll rush to the end like this and then complain there's nothing to do. See retail WoW for an example of this.

There is an annoying and all too prevalent on the internet air of superiority in saying, I know what you will and will not like better than you do.
---
I hope I can catch all these fights on youtube later.
---
it is still going Lulw
---
Ooh I think I can handle that. Cool, thanks!
---
Def great stuff. I’m a grown ass man and still constantly mix this stuff in on Spotify.
---
[He actually made a video talking about this](https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo)
---
Yeah true Quinn forgot about him haha. But he won’t be any good anyways :p
---
Hey, that looks sick but can anyone explain to me how could he literally walk into 20 enemies and freecast AoE's being a mage? (I've never played WoW, I'm super hyped by the Classic release and trying to learn what class I will play by lurking the beta testers)
---
Here's a video of Venruki talking about his initial beta experience https://youtu.be/-k5K4a-teWo
---
Fair. It's essentially a server-wide layer.
---
Just need the subscription, no other purchases necessary
---
Thanks man!
---
[Seems familiar](https://i.imgur.com/QRkavaf_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
Nah not that I remember but it was 250-300 max for me as I recall. Wasn’t a big deal playing holy paladin though just pre cast everything
---
&gt; So if your modern PC can run private servers, it can run Classic even better.
---
There are absolutely a ton of PCs that can run the vanilla client and will not be able to run Classic WoW.   
---
It's when you look at the low end PCs, and those that run the vanilla client on low graphics settings and resolution, that there will be many people who can play the vanilla client on a private server and cannot run the Classic client.  In other words the *minimum* requirements are higher for Classic than the vanilla client.     
---
That doesn't mean a more powerful PC can't get better performance out of the Classic client.  But people are spreading the false information that if you can play the vanilla client, you will be able to play Classic WoW. It's not true.
---
You could have both on pve servers.
---
Works for everyone else
---
Just gonna throw this out there but if someone made a t-shirt that said South shore and had a graphic of that pauldron on it I'd totally buy it
---
That’s cool at. I didn’t even know that was a thing. So glad I never reached 60 during vanilla. Classic is going to be a whole new yet nostalgic experience. Props to you mate, don’t feel bad about sharing content!
---
That's why i said "modern PC". It's hard to find a new computer that can't pass the minimum requirements. You'd have to use Raspberry Pi or something.
---
Dude what are you talking about there is world pvp happening all the time in BFA to the point that it's obnoxious.
---
Lol yeah fun to run around in the zerg but he would have done double the damage by just casting blizzard at 30yards.
---
We're going to have a lot of mods that are more sophisticated than they were in vanilla.
---
That's blizzlike and it's the point of what they were testing
---
I agree that there needs to be some balancing and updates. You can't just have the classes go unchanged indefinitely. There will be everyone playing the OP specs, and no one playing the other specs. It also takes away from any of the hope that your class will be buffed, because you KNOW it won't.
---
It isn't "changing" classic to want updates and patches. That's wanting classic to actually be taken care of, and not set and forget. Classic was awesome, but if they truly just leave it as is for good, it won't be so awesome. 
---
Originally people didn't know what was going to be OP. They'd level their class, and if they liked it, stuck with it in hopes of getting buffed. This time around, everyone knows what we are getting into. EXACTLY what we're getting. They can min max everything, and nothing will change. That's boring as fuck, and I don't really want to see a thousand warriors and rogues
---
for new players i can't recommend going the optimal speed leveling specc that you will probably find online, it's more fun to try stuff on your own. The only thing I would always specc is improved sinister strike, everything else doesn't matter. 
---
full combat makes leveling faster, but sub for example gives you the full character immersion, makes you better in open world pvp if u play on a pvp server (or makes you better at avoiding it) and was generally more fun to me when I did it.
---
You should, because chances are they will stick around and help you kill it. This line of not my problem has been one of the downfalls of current WoW.
---
Make sure to report all the bugs that aren’t really bugs
---
'cuz it's incredibly stupid, period, whether it's a PVE, PVP, RP or RP-PVP server.
---
i have no idea who alexensual is, but, i know who Asmongold/Sodapoppin are, both who pull 60k+ viewers. i can't imagine that he's any worse then the types of people those two can pull in. adding a specific rule to a specific server that has to be enforced is stupid. there's no way to enforce this unless Blizzard has someone policing twitch and whatever other streaming platforms 24/7, which we already know they won't do this. Blizzard barely policies the regular RP servers for infractions.
---
Tonight was literally 80v80 or more in Arathi.
---
Group pvp shaman with no chain heal or chain lightning. Sad times.
---
Oh you mean those muck dwellers living in Dirt hovels in the desert? Yeah with their pig farms and being overrun by quillboars and Centaurs they are a SUPER big threat to the might of the civilized Allaince
---
Got various classes to 60. First as was a hunter, then holy priest, holy pali and 2 rogues.  Did mc, bwl, zg, aq 20 w the priest and zg w the pali.  Dps were all for farming mats.
---
Man this is so fun.
---
More recent Macs with integrated graphics can play vanilla and TBC clients quite easily with good FPS. It may require lower resolution and graphics settings though.    I have no problem playing older WoW clients on MacBook Air and Macbooks.
---
i'm guessing the rest were off screen? there's like 20 people in this image
---
That rogue DPS is odd, I thought fury warriors / warlocks were king of DPS in these late raids?
---
Not tedious at all, it juts becomes part of your routine.
---
Sell greys, repair gear, but arrows.
---
I understand everyone's hate for streamers. I get it. But what you just described at the end. A roaming band of people following one guy? 
---
Isn't that a Guild?
---
^ This is your brain on soy
---
I know, I was just pointing out there's no way of pricing it. BfA is priced via supply and demand, the only supply comes from BfA as being able to buy gold on classic isn't something most people want.
---
They'd need a way of tying it to a gold value that's the equivalent of 15 dollars but in classic gold has no non RWT value in the real world.
---
I was most active in WotLK. I actually PVPed for once and did every heroic and raid. (Barely touched raids before that.) I say this because it was utterly heart breaking when Cataclysm came out, and everything I had was now worthless.
---
That's what I'm looking forward to the most - not feeling like I have to race to the finish line in order to get the most use out of my gear.
---
That being said, I can totally understand people saying that things will get stale. Not everybody progresses as slowly as me, or has as many alts. Since Classic isn't out yet and we don't have any concrete numbers as to how many will stick with it, it's tough to say if making different types of servers would be a good idea or not. Some people will get angry if the community gets slashed to move to different servers, and some people will get angry if everyone quits because they're bored.
---
Damned if I know the right solution!
---
It really depends how modern the integrated graphics is.   Intel Iris and above should have no problems on lower settings.
---
1-120 is about 75 hours played  with heirlooms. 1-60 is about 240 and lvl 46 is about the 1/2 way point of 120 hours played
---
While I like and enjoy doing arena myself, I am 100% with you on this. These things are what makes an MMORPG in my opinion and I feel like arena (along with other things) took a lot of that away.
---
Beautiful. If this happened in Vanilla you’d have 5 FPS and the server would crash. This gets me so pumped!
---
Situational.
---
hmm I wonder why blizzard is giving beta access to streamers.........
---
There's been about 3 points where everything froze up for a few seconds but it's mostly been smooth.
---
Also, the server won’t be crashing and lagging.
---
&gt; heres no expectation since there isnt a timer to beat
---
This is like saying there's no expecation for a rogue to use his abilities since there's no timer to hit.
---
&gt;  I’m not sure if that’s just because I was lazy/casual/bad
---
I looked up just "grand marshal" and went to the vendor after clicking one of the items. Figured it was easier than just linking the search that had some irrelevant items things otherwise but yeah I can understand the issue
---
9k but there are no heirlooms in Vanilla
---
I love being smug as much as the next guy but we really still don’t know if this stability will last in live builds. There were lag spikes during this and you have to considered there were only about 500 people total on their server. I truly hope we can get quality world pvp like this though it is one of the main things that made this game so special.
---
Kevin Jordan (one of the original 3 game designers) has been discussing a lot of the design principles that Vanilla was made with in his streams. Really interesting to listen to.
---
Did you alt tab at all? People were saying thats what creates the face swapping bug I think (idk how that makes sense but it's what i've seen).
---
&gt; Force ALL the streamers onto a single realm and let then all be there with their army of neckbeards.
---
this won't happen and you already know it won't. why would Blizzard do this? what if the PVP server is decided to be the "streamer server", but the streamer doesn't want to play on a PVP server?
---
Soy intake doesn’t affect your testosterone levels. 
---
But you’re too dull to realize that. The correct term is beta, which is what you are.
---
GG
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking.  Don't get me wrong this is a cool video and I love this kinda shit.  But this title is nothing less than click bait.
---
30 seconds is a long cooldown to you?
---
Go figure, Esfand is extroverted and Asmon is introverted.
---
&gt;shouldn't of been an idiot
---
Ironic.
---
Baul Plart Mall Slot
---
CPU by far.
---
I think I know you. Was this on Draka?
---
I think you are right for new computers.  
---
Most MacBooks and MAcBook Airs out there, however, will probably run the old clients better than Classic WoW.  The Classic WoW will be more demanding and have higher minimum requirements.
---
It's hardly surprising that people who want to play an old version of wow arent too impressed with the current version. This wouldnt be happening if everyone liked "current expansion".
---
For years people who play retail have been telling us that classic will never happen or other nonsense like people only play private servers because they cant afford retail. The animosity is definitely not one sided.
---
This is our time.
---
Upper STV vs Lower STV
---
if you can link me a video or something where people in bfa successfully pulled off multi-raid against multi-raid world pvp like tonight on classic without sharding ruining it or the server crashing (like it did, twice, for asmongold's two attempts) then i'll concede
---
This guy is honestly a great GREAT troll. Yesterday he made Asmongold create a whole tabard, hype it up and all as a good crest for the guild, to then proceed to sellout on his merch that had the same symbol on it. God tier.
---
I never said there were I was simply comparing the leveling time of classic to retail and how the time it takes a max a fresh character in retail you would barely be 35 in classic.
---
Thanks, just bought 10
---
I played the tail end of classic and I didn't use addons until I started raiding in BC.  I'll probably download a damage meter though because I like competing in damage and seeing where I stand among my peers.
---
I don't like arenas. This began the push to ground classes not based on merit but based on arena composition.
---
"Ability X becomes too powerful when you pair it with classes B and C, therefore, nerf class A".
---
No thanks.
---
:')
---
I mean these guys are streamers and play a fuck load of WoW / video games. They’re mechanically skilled and know their classes. Should be harder for casuals.
---
It’s 100% fact. every time you reply to somebody you seem like you’re bullshittinf just that little bit more. Theres no way you could out dps frost mages in MC as fire, let aline with blue gear, if any of you were competent raiders. The guys teling you bosses FOR A FACT have fire resist in MC and some are immune and you’re still trying to dispute him to keep up with your bullshit.
---
Had gotten to C’thun once (wipe) and killed a couple Naxxramas bosses.
---
they should streamers are hyping up the game. giving it to streamer is better than giving to shitters who cry and wine about it and would not benefit the game
---
Until I watched this video I hadn't even *considered* the streamer effect. I've always felt a resentment towards streamer fans (not the streamers themselves) and I don't think it'll help if I end up seeing one on my server...
---
Awesome, great video.
---
Trade chat is going to be cancer regardless of twitch streamers.
---
They follow naming conventions and are easy to look up if you know what to search for.
---
Warrior: plate  
---
Paladin: lamellar  
---
Hunter: chain  
---
Shaman: mail  
---
Rogue: leather  
---
Druid: dragonhide  
---
Mage: silk  
---
Priest: satin  
---
Warlock: dreadweave
---
Rank 7: Knight-Lieutenant / Blood Guard  
---
Rank 8: Knight-Captain / Legionnaire  
---
Rank 10: Lieutenant-Commander / Champion  
---
Rank 12: Marshal / General  
---
Rank 13: Field Marshal / Warlord  
---
Rank 14: Grand Marshal / High Warlord
---
Then you can just go to a database like [classicdb](http://classicdb.ch) (though it seems to be down just now) and search for, say, "champion's dragonhide" and you'll find the rank 10 items for druid. You can also just search for 's dragonhide to see all items that follow this naming scheme, meaning all the ranked sets for the class.
---
Apparently it would be different because the Classic beta is exceeding the hype and making people (and Blizzard execs) change their minds about about how they are going to play their cards.
---
"The r14 weapons arent great for casters". The r14 caster sword is equivalent to femur in AQ40 lmao what are you on
---
Horde were always strongest, taurens can obviously benchpress more then a gnome or mere human..
---
I would say they lacked much military strength. Vanilla orcs were fighting for their survival in the harsh lands of Durotar, facing threats from quilboar, Theramore and struggling to harvest lumber in Ashenvale.
---
Youre talking about retail Dalaran, arent you?
---
OPs reply specifically says vanilla **P**servers.
---
Or make a prot pally set... Just an idea.
---
This was his good karma, because before this clip he got popped by Themechanic for a 500 aimed shot, plus auto lol.
---
I dont get why some people are against graphical OPTIONS. Let people scale up and have better graphics if they want.
---
3 minute you mean
---
Arena (AKA deathmatch) 
---
Is the ultimate pleb game type, not unpopular to those of us with taste. 
---
In no other genre but fighting games can I think of the objective being solely to kill your opponent. Removes so much depth from teh game.
---
Objectives really help you break away from the very simple fights you can flow chart out in your mind. Makes the RNG unbearable too. Way easier to take when it's objective PvP
---
Asmongold has been gradually getting more and more sour. I don't know why really.
---
Sorry I'm not fully up to date! What has he done?
---
That's precisely the reason blizzard needs to approach this seriously. Imagine having something like WeakAuras in classic. People want to play a classic version of the game that's unmolested. Addons like that shouldn't become the meta.
---
Bolvar &gt; Anduin
---
This will be the WPVP that BFA was supposed to have but failed to get with all the rewards, while Classic will have this constantly with little to no rewards.
---
Wowhead has comments dating back to 1.2.
---
Blizzard has always pulled numbers out of their ass. It's best not to think logically when it comes to WoW's lore. 
---
I think lorewise SW alone has more population than the entire Horde put together. I mean the orcs escaped on a single fleet. The Trolls were a bunch of refugees fleeing from murlocs and the Tauren were only a couple of tribes. The most populous race were the Forsaken and they pretty much had their own goals and plans.
---
To be honest, I do not hate on the streamer themselves.  Some are good, some are asses, just like any regular player.  The problem is their massive fanbase.  Streamers bring out the best and more importantly, the worse in their fans.
---
I believe that playing on a server with a streamer and their fans comes with more CONS then PROS when I am not part of that community/fanbase.  
---
And that is likely going make my own experience of the game less enjoyable, and that is something I wish to avoid.  
---
I hope as we get close to launch, someone will create a list of which servers have streamers, and which ones do not.
---

No, I mean 30

I might check this out, thanks!

This is from when all thought Warcraft 4 would happen. How naive we were.

The only kind of pages google search finds for me are like these

https://www.wowhead.com/title=14/grand-marshal#reward-from-achievement
---
https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=433/grand-marshal
---
Just completely empty pages with nothing else than the title Grand Marshal or High Warlord mentioned lol, nothing about the items or vendors related to them.
---
I hope the website gets managed better once Classic launches.

Best guess common sense answers
---
1.  Depends on phase. Second phase (DM/world bosses will be 2 months max). AQ5 -&gt; Nax6 will be at least 3-4 months. All of them will be between 2-4 I'd imagine.  
---
2. Vanilla after layering gone is the aim. 3-5k concurrent max.
---
3. 3-4 weeks max after launch.
---
4. Unlikely. Point of Classic isn't to pick and chose how things work, it's to recreate vanilla
---
5. Obviously don't know yet but you can get a very good idea. Diana's is 1.10 so it's after AQ and before Naxx, so probably AQ patch.

Why is he always picking his nose?
---
Private servers can handle pretty massive battles these days with little to no lag. the thing people were worried about with classic is that it’ll lag like retail does, since in retail you can’t even have a proper 40v40 battle without the server having a meltdown

No its crossroad and it always looked like that

He ran in pretty fast using a swiftness pot, the other group wasn't focused on him, and by the time the realized what was happening he was able to get his spells off and ice block.

Lol fucking retail players downvoting me. YUM

god damn that just felt wholesome.

welcome back classic
---
Having watched a bit of that stream I recognized Ioi from his dungeon groups too.
---
You need a good premade team, I guess if your friends are good you can get carried but not many people want to carry bad players
---
Also if you're bad it will take even more time than if you were good
---
Same. I was never into Twitch, but since the beta came out, I’ve been glued to my monitor, watching these guys having a blast and praying for my beta key.
---
They weren't linked till 1.9, and Ironforge was the only city with an AH until a certain patch that I do not remember/can't find a reference for.
---
ty
---
Nah man. Gonna do just like I did back in the day. If I get stuck, I'll search it up on wowhead. What was the other site back in the day? Thottbot?
---
to be fair he's on benefits so he gets to play it 24/7
---
Why is everyone so green? Sorry never made it to Nax :(
---
Most annoying thing is getting new pet skill ranks while levelling. That can add 15-20 mins every 5 levels or so of screwing around no other class has to do. Food/training/arrows is all very easy.  
---
Losing a bag slot is way more annoying than having to buy arrows, but at least hunters have very straight gearing, not carrying multiple sets like druids/warriors so it's ok.
---
my integrated graphics on my 8700k is not a pleasant experience. But that integrated gpu is not really made to be used. im sure laptop integrated gpus are way better.
---
Played a mage and cleared mc/bwl/AQ40. Wiping for months on Twins in AQ40 was a highlight. Dipped my feet into naxx, but my guild only got 5-6 bosses down before TBC came out.
---
Quite. I was on MMO-Champion for years before Reddit and I can safely say that the anti-Classic crowd “started it” looooong ago.
---
We’ve earned our spite/schadenfreude.
---
no, that's right. the video posted above, the rogue, in leather, is getting hit for high-50s, low 60s, and then you add in Devotion Aura/Mail Armor/Shield, the damage is fine.
---
truly it is a mystery
---
like level 20 i started right at the release of TBC on a friends account. Then he bought me an account and a pc. Then for most of TBC i played a hunter and did pvp. Then started tanking near the end, did really well and then switched to alliance to play with a friends dad and leveled a Dranei Shaman and did just the smallest amount of raiding before giving up. 
---
In the middle of Wrath, I also (along with my brother and a friend) we started a 3 man paladin group with the soul mission of 3 manning everything in the entire game along with being on a pvp server. We wrecked every dungeon until we gave up in the middle of TBC dungeons, we still were destroying everything but everyone but me quit playing. We all specced for survivability along with our main role. So i was Ret and my friend was tank and my bro was heals. 
---
The reason i mention that story is, because at some point in Classic i would like to do something similar with some people. Start 3 characters and see how far we can get. with out a full group.
---
Right before the biggest all-star PVP battle in WoW history.
---
There is zero reason to do it. I don't even know why they added in the new water and foliage. It adds nothing and is not necessary. The project is meant to bring back the 2004-06 game as faithful as possible, and this is not in line with that goal.
---
i havnt played since 2007. can u sen link to your launcher plz.
---
that looks lit.
---
&gt; The Horde doing Thrall's work.
---
Nah, At this point Thrall was more on the way for peace, and would rather there be peace, Or have you completely forgotten Warcraft 3 Era?
---
No one targeted him quick enough. He kind of just surprised them by running in like that, because most mages wouldn't even attempt that.
---
”he learned a little English, I learned a little google translate” 😂😂
---
Is it good to start with holy tree as a pally? I mean getting consecration + improved bow and then go ret?
---
Phase Lengths: Blizzard has stated that they will not be revealing phase lengths in advance. We probably won't know when a phase will be released until some time after the prior phase has been released.
---
Realm Sizes: It's been mentioned in interviews that they currently plan to have each layer have around 3000 player cap. Once layers are merged I expect the total server cap to be at least 4000 to 6000 unless they're going to split servers or make tons of players transfer servers but they haven't talked about that.
---
Layering Length: Ion has consistently been saying layering will only be around for weeks, but in interviews others have frequently said months. It has been promised that layering will be removed before phase 2 is released, but we don't know how long that will take.
---
Dungeon Gold Farming: No comment has been made by Blizzard.
---
Loot Table Update Timing: Loot tables will be updated when phase 5 is released.
---
Depends what class you are and if mana is a problem. Priest can wand, pally can judge something useful on a target. It's not going to make a huge difference but yeah playing optimally you should just be following the group around on full mana for entire pulls.
---
Nothing to really concede, I mean I've been on massive world pvp battles and yes it was really laggy, maybe I misunderstood you but I thought you were trying to imply to world pvp doesn't happen on retail, which it totally does. (Maybe not multi-raids but 40v40, 30v30 etc).
---
Fury warrior wasnt as known then as now. And possibly they just had a ton of rogues since earlier tiers. My guess anyway.
---
WeakAuras already works on the Classic beta. If you dont want to use them, don't use them, but just because you want to live in a time capsule doesn't mean others have to.
---
Yea. WoWhead purchased the Thottbot domain and it will redirect you to Classic.Wowhead.
---
It also has 200% of your daily B-vitamins per 16 oz can!
---
The warfronts are just not good. I can’t explain why; but it’s too easy and repetitive. For some reason, Warsong Gulch is still relevant and I enjoy it (even though I’m not that much of a PVPer). WSG only had a graphic update a month ago. It survived the test of time over 15 years. Timeless game design is just that, always good. 
---
I think people only do warfronts to gear alts these days.
---
Yeah, the ones in Macs recently are really good.
---
Not really. Some classes are better at certain things. There's too many categories for there to be a "best pvp class": 1v1s, group pvp, large-scale wpvp, battlegrounds, premades have specific meta, etc.
---
On PvE you can.
---
nah it definitely does, bfa world pvp was the best content in the expack, i just meant these world war scenarios where you can almost have half the realm going up in arms
---
i'm guessing the world pvp aspect of bfa is about to die as well, now that flying is around the corner
---
And you wanna pvp 15 year old content so bad? 
---
Retail doesn't interest me. I don't see your point.
---
I don't think pve-content has aged any worse than the pvp-content. Look at how much fun people are having levelling in the beta. And why would I race? I'm just having fun playing the game. If anything it's the pvp that has aged poorly. Look at the honor system; it's nothing but a mindless grind. 
---
If you think all WoW has to offer is a race to max lvl and rushing end-game content, maybe you should stick to retail.
---
For you the most fun part is that. I'm glad I'm not you. I did play on a p-server and I had more fun than I ever did on retail, despite not raiding beyond a couple of MC/ZG PuGs.
---
Not everyone shares your preferences. I'm happy Classic WoW can be enjoyed for so many different reasons. You do your thing and I'll do mine. Neither is an inherently superior pastime.
---
He did his 180, and he did it well. Doesn't deserve any hate imo, glad he's having more fun than he expected, he's having a blast rn
---
Level capped betas are always super fun. They tricked me into buying both Warhammer Online and Age of Conan. The level 20 metagame was a blast. The full game, not so much.
---
Just avoid server with asmon, soda.
---
its not phasing, if you look closely hes in ghost wolf running up to him and you can see his name before the nameplate appears, nameplates have a really short range in which they pop up in vanilla
---
No they won't.
---
Besides that i dont understand how when u buy play time it has to keep ticking when u log off, like most people are not casual players, most are hardcore nerds, if they made game time stop when logged off blizzard wouldnt be losing that much money... kinda sad its forcing people on game time to feel like they always have to be on to get the most out the the time payed for...
---
The difference between having shamys and pally is far bigger than any effect racials have. Racials really only make a big difference in duels. In group pvp the effect of windfury/purge/BoF/DS is way bigger.
---
An AMAr
---
Watching people play it only makes it worse for me so I try not to.
---
Are you watching 5 streams ? Haha nice setup
---
I mean - did you see him flip out about not getting the sentry cloak?
---
So I can save this for the release of classic and use as game time?
---
Hey, that's cool with me and all I'll need. I remember using I think it was deadly boss mods at end game as a requirement for a guild I joined, but that's the only major one I can think of off the top of my head.
---
Oh, and that all in one bag mod. I remember having a ton of shit for raids on my Druid.
---
Side question, will Paladins and Druids need to bless/gift of the wild each group individually or will it be raid wide? My memory is really fuzzy, but I remember us having one Druid per group in the raid for it and Paladins having to buff each individual member, I think.
---
Rathma is a sick name
---
HoJ is maybe the most prominent example.
---
Havent you heard this sub hates streamers they are the devil incarnate and ruin the game

---
I know you want to get karma OP but there's no need to overhype it as 'INSANE', come on...
---
Hopefully this is an effective summary:
---
1. Add-Ons will be better and more plentiful this time around.
---
2. Fighting against streamers and their fans. Will have to compete for quest items, the server queue, etc...
---
3. Various unintentional bugs and glitches from original release have been fixed. This also includes stability for the server and for most players' internet.
---
4. The community will be different. There will be a greater sense of community vs retail BfA, which itself isn't different from original Vanilla - but people that played back then have grown, new players will start, etc... Also since a lot of veterans will return, the global knowledge set has grown.
---
5. Details - 1.12 AV, 1.12 Class Balance, No Full Itemization, Pseudo Loot Trading, Blizard App Support, Limited Layering
---
6. Phase Schedule - Classic will start with 1.12 hotfix / features, but the dungeon, raid, and item content will be phased differently.
---
7. Stagnation - No plans to move on to BC or other content past the currently planned phased.
---
8. Knowledge and Access to information - Players' personal knowledge from veterans, as well as tools like youtube, wowhead, etc... Every nook and cranny has been explored and documented.
---
9. Skill - Fits in with the previous one, but there are people that are hardcore veterans. We'll see week 1 raid clears from top guilds. 
---
10. First Time Experience - Most players' won't have to discover everything from scratch. It won't be a new experience for many people.
---
**TL;DR of the TL;DW** it's a different year. Times have changed. Technology is better. There is nothing new to learn.
---
Not unique. It's sometimes the timing and even if i am wrong, i felt the timing was right :)

Whats your setup btw? Looks nice
---
True, they were engaged already and he flanked nicely during that disorder
---
Tribe
---
Sure, if both were the same level. The problem is that it's always a level 60 going after a, like, level 35. You can't beat that as a level 35.
---
Isnt that also the case because in the past half of the poeple sisnt even know when selecting a realm? Combined with the fact that people didnt want to create a character on a new server, they had to look for a solution on their current realm by forming these groups? Nowadays everyone know what the realms mean so I guess it is gonna be different this time around.
---
Gotta respect the guy for admitting he was wrong, most people just double down.
---
Everyone who played vanilla was a wow newcomer
---
If this shows up, I would be interested in reading.  I'll do some digging as well.
---
Hi, /u/RyusekiV3
---
If you are planning on playing Alliance private message me
---
Just do world pvp...
---
Ya I think you are right.
---
there is such a thing as a dumb question.   
---
&gt;person:how much is this BMW?  
---
BMW salesperson: $69999  
---
person:do blinkers come with it for that price? Or are those extra?  
---
&gt;.....  
---
being that mmo's live and die on their economy because Auction House. There is no way they would left 100's of thousands of accounts remain on a live server with a 3 month head start. it's just silly to assume otherwise. As little as know about hearthstone. there is no economy based auction house. which would be the one thing that makes keeping beta progression not a precedent in the world of MMO's.
---
the mentality when they transitioned into another private server and exploited bugs which they knew about but decided to hide (beta tested btw) instead of report so they could use them to full advantage, get with it you halfwit
---
downvoted.
---
Not a huge fan of streamers myself but---why not? Cause they're not playing with the mentality of tracking every bug down? Hate to break it to you but most of beta testing in a real professional setting (did this for years) is just playing the game and seeing what breaks. The ridiculous coverage these people get puts tens--hundreds of thousands of eyes on what they're doing. Not only is it literally free advertising and hype, but it's doing a half decent job when issues do crop up and everyone and their dog starts whining about the big and how the streamer isn't putting on his detective hat and solving it. Blizz sees it one way or another.
---
So here’s something that no one is saying.  Yes skilled hunters have a role in 40 man raids...but most raiding guilds already have enough hunters before they even hit 60.  
---
It is not common to level your toon and just happen to make friends with a group that just happens to later be a regular 40 man raiding guild.  When i played Vanilla my server only had a handful of guilds that routinely took down Rag and Onyxia.  These guilds all had more than enough hunters and rogues.  
---
And especially if you don’t level quickly then by the time you’re 60 the good guilds are already more than filled with Hunters and Rogues.
---
Now others may have had different experiences on other servers...but i had the exact same experience on 2 different servers first time with Nelf Hunter...second time with Troll Rogue.  Both cases it took me months to get into a good guild (after joining 2-3 mid tier guilds that attempted MC but wiped or couldn’t routinely get 40 players).  When i did join the better guilds i was a back up and it took forever to get t2 gear.
---
Damn, that Frost Nova caught like 12 people! Also that Ice Block was insanely clutch! I can't wait to see what top tier modern PvPers like Venruki could do once the game launches and we get Battle Grounds. Pserver veterans might have some competition! :D
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who feels this way. Haven’t been subbed since cata released, couldn’t be more excited for classic. If they could eventually patch up to wrath but keep some things the same that the community seems to be really invested in, I think that’d be perfect.
---
Run into a pack and use raptor strike and then spam wing clip until it procs the spin. 
---
Who knows if it functions like that in classic, but that's actually a thing on private servers.
---
You're missing the fucking point entirely but whatever fits that narrative of yours, bud.
---
KEK
---
Rogues, Rogue's Everywhere.
---
Yeah hopefully this world being just the 2 continent's and none of the other world changing things make it run better then retail.
---
Probably like a year. I'm 30 now, but back then I was still in high school with dial up internet in a small ass town. Mom really limited my time to maybe if I was lucky a few hours a day and was constantly having me get off the line.
---
Then, of course, I got in trouble and lost my computer for over a year. Teenage me had an addiction and would constantly argue with mom for more time to the point of getting cut off, but eh.
---
It was probably a good idea to cut me off to be honest. I had no self control back then.
---
The females are fun.  They do a flip when they Sunder Armor.
---
For him to be the one to announce classic more or less redeemed himself in my eyes. Most people cant admit they are wrong to anyone let alone a rabid fan base that is the warcraft fan base.
---
Yes, heal aggro is evenly distributed into all mobs that are in combat with you.  It follows the rules of whether or not you're in melee range as well.
---
Nice :)

Look at his profile.  This is the third one he's done so far.  I had to go upvote all of them.  I ignored the first one, thought the second was clever, now I'm just impressed.
---
Gonna need a lot more to go on than some random insult, bub.
---
Now you're going for personal insults.   
---
  And again, DIFFERENT GAMES.  
---
  BFA is NOT classic, you're, for whatever forsaken reasoning, thinking that classic is gonna use bfa modern textures, extremely higher polygon count, new particles, longer view distance, etc.   
---
  The games are nowhere near the same graphical demand, you don't just magically have to render things that aren't and won't ever be used and are not even in the client.
---
