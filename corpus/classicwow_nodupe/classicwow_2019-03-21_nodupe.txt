Rogues are genuinely pretty fun to play. I had no trouble getting into groups on whatever server it was I was playing.

The only thing I hated about being a rogue though was other rogues.

Seriously, I hate rogues.

How about starting without, see how/if that works, and potentially add em if needed?

The trick with the Desolace centaurs was to grind Gelkis rep by killing Magram (and doing Gelkis quests) then grind Magram rep by killing the undead in the canyon just south of Magram territory.
---
Unfortunately prot warrior is by far the worst PvP spec in vanilla WoW and you'd be almost useless in BGs apart from tanking the AV bosses. Flag carrying is best left to more mobile classes like druid and mage.
---
You make a compelling argument there my friend. Touche. 
---
The only version I know is the one being used on private servers which seems to be a weird amalgamation of the 1.5 and 1.12 version. The most fun I've had is me as a feral tank sneaking into a tower with a resto druid and 3 rogues to capture a tower.    
---
Another time I aggressively tried to steer the match and we actually won. Didn't help that I constantly lost raid lead whenever someone joined, might just be a quirk of the private servers though. 
---
I guess my point is that these events are far and between and the endless turtle camping gets boring real fast. 
---
You’re not alone. /r/childfree forever.
---
I agree with thise. Those changes seemed like a good idea at the time. Thanks to hindsight we can have a legitimate and reasonable discussion as to why they may have actually been bad in the long run. Changes to PvP and battlegrounds (especially AV) made it more fun for some people, but detracted from the experience for others.
---
It's too much of a simplification to state "those changes happened for a reason."

Alright I can't say I appreciate the chiding of the OP but this comment seriously made me laugh out loud.  Well done my friend

I'm making a guild come Classic and I'm adamant about not labeling it on the scale at all.  The terms "casual" "hardcore" and especially "semi-hardcore" are so completely subjective that they're basically useless IMO.  
---
I will be stating the goals, plans, and expectations for the guild as well as the atmosphere it's going for, and people can slap on their own label.  I don't care if you think it's a casual guild or a hardcore guild, if you're working toward the same goals on the same schedule and trying to create the same atmosphere, then you're in the right place.
---
dwarf is absolutely fine
---
That's a private server with over 10k concurrent players.
---
Very possible!
---
I don't have a guide to link you to but will offer my 2 cents from my experience leveling and tanking 5 mans up to 60 (I hope you're a warrior).  I'm too lazy to read what others have said so this might not be anything new.
---
**Leveling:**
---
I would recommend tanking as much as possible in the early levels because you might get overwhelmed doing it at 40-60. Players are generally more understanding and willing to help you in the 10-30 range as they are just glad they could get a tank and chances are they will make mistakes too. 
---
A tip I would give is to level up as arms from the get go if you want to tank while leveling. Some people go 2H fury until level 40 but I think arms has a clear advantage for tanking without suffering from a leveling perspective. With improved charge and a few points in stance mastery, you can open a fight by charging in and instantly casting thunderclap (for aoe pulls) or sunder armor (boss fights). Thunderclap isn't an amazing threat ability but it does help you from getting slammed at the start of a big aoe pull. I would never use it except for when you first charge in. You can then switch to defensive stance and have enough rage to use your next ability. 
---
**Do not put any points into the defensive tree: you do not need them for tanking pre-60.**
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**Tanking:**
---
1. **Battle shout, battle shout, battle shout**! This skill gives you threat on all mobs within range for how many party members are affected (5 in a dungeon). It also gives threat even if your allies already have the buff on them **meaning it is spamable**. This is one of your go to spells for maintaining threat on 3-4+ targets especially at the start of a fight so mobs don't instantly agro your healer after their first cast on you. It is also great for holding those pesky non-elite mobs that are present in some dungeons that aren't worth a sunder alone. Demoralizing shout does generate threat and is very useful for mitigating damage, but it gives a fixed amount of threat that is split between targets.
---
2. **Revenge**. This skill is your best threat/rage ability. That doesn't mean that it generates **the most** threat but it is your most efficient ability. You will not be getting a ton of rage in the early dungeons meaning you shield be using this whenever it is available. 
---
3. **Bloodrage**. If you use the charge build that I recommend above for initiating, sometimes it is worth saving bloodrage when you actually need it. For line of sight pulls where you can't charge, you really need bloodrage to be able to maintain threat in the first 10 seconds. If you know a los pull is coming soon, save your bloodrage. 
---
4. **Marking.** No you do not have to be an expert tactician. However, you should always at least mark your main target. If you go into your keybinds you can bind the different markers to a button press. I usually use my 2 mouse buttons for skull and x. It is very easy to get support from your group when a dps is being careless with their targeting and dies with markers are up.
---
As with anything else in game: the more you practice, the better you become. I would try tanking a dungeon after familiarizing yourself with it as dps for the first time (which it sounds like you already have done). Also make sure not to be under leveled as a tank. If mobs are orange/red, your life is going to be hell with all of the times you miss your abilities. 
---
tanks are in lower demand for 40 mans
---
In my small guild we had a guy who would make techno (happy hardcore) mixes and sometimes he would come into Vent and do it live. I mostly remember running Maraudon and him coming in and making it a party. Some of the best times. 
---
Your name is awesome. Go pats
---
Grognak, that’s NOT what I meant by Orcish ammunition!
---
(((Bravadorado))): Look at this guy's post history. That makes any point he makes irrelevant.
---
If you want to pug bgs its doesnt matter. In wsg/ab you will be farmed by premades anyway and in AV tanks are needed.
---
Yes people were so upset when they could suddenly actually get marks in AV because people started queueing again, or games actually ended in under 12 hours. The fact that battlemasters existed meant way more people queue'd for bgs and could be done before/after raids or waiting for auctions/professions cooldowns/honor updates was just disastrous.  
---
  
---
The idea that change always = bad (or similarly reward = bad...) is just so short sighted. Yes many changes to WoW have been poorly thought out and damaged the game experience over the last 14 years. That doesn't mean just because we're nostalgic for 1 shot reckoning Kazzak or double damage bloodthirst doesn't mean we should put them into Classic. 
---
Yeah this is my only worry about classic. Server faction balance and population are gonna make it or break it for me.
---
There ia totally a chance of blizzard handpicking features to be removed for upcoming expansions like wotlk and cata. They know wjat audience they qre trying to attract with this project and if their audience clearly doesnt like lfr, i could definitly see them remove it. They want to make money off of a different audience than retail so they should be willing to cater to those.
---
“Camp” yeah okay. 
---
Way to miss the clear distinction by grouping everyone as “no changes”. People crying about changes that occurred during vanilla are just retards. People crying for changes that never even occurred regardless of patch are just retards who never played vanilla.
---
There’s a difference. Try again

Detheroc Server - Addon at the time took screenshots of new crits before I even knew wow had a screenshot function.
---
This is right next to the Zoram Strand! I’d recognize that ruin anywhere... haha
---
Ive narrowed it down to Warrior, Priest or Shaman. I like to play healers or tanks. I was arms dps in legion and that was kind of fun. But classic doesnt have the leap and charge.
---
Honestly I always really wanted to goof around with a shadow priest or feral druid, but chances are I'd always be fighting to justify taking gear or even getting a raid spot without just being told to shut up and heal.
---
Which leaves me looking at the pure classes.  I'm really torn between warlock and rogue, with my issue with rogue being that I know they are going to be overpopulated because they are so hilariously fun in wpvp and pvp in general.  At the end of the day this leaves me taking the path of least resistance and likely just rolling warlock :P.
---
Relatively fun and not too hard to get groups with as well as being generally potent in pvp.

In vanilla you needed every button on the bars at all time. Improves dps

---
classic does have charge, you just have to be out of combat and in battle stance. Also Warriors have Intercept in Berserker Stance, but it requires rage to use.
---
You just gave an idea for daily videos to Tips. 13 minutes explaining a screenshot daily, baby.
---
[removed]
---
I think you should play what you'd like to play at 60, and what class you enjoy the mechanics of the most. If you're gonna be duo leveling with a Priest then that will negate most of the Warrior's sustain issues, you'll be able to chain pull as long as the Priest has mana to heal you.
---
No doubt with appropriate gear across your raid, ie geared competent healers to compensate. Just trying to be clear to the thread creator that as MT you’ll be basically full prot for quite a while in progression if not always. 👍. 
---
Pretty fun to heal as Priest, they have lots of utility like Dispel, mana burn, Fear. I'd say Priest on Horde is more integral than Priest on Alliance due to Paladins being more durable PvP Healers.

I would disagree as someone who literally watched their server die over the years. Cross-realm stuff really saved my ability to play. Yes the community aspect was lost and that does suck but being able to actually take part in the content is worth more. Battlegrounds were seeing massive queue times because it was inconvenient to go to the portals to queue if that wasn't the only thing you wanted to do for the day. AV and AB weren't bad for the horde because they had close flight-paths but they were on the wrong continent. WSG was on the right continent but had no close flight-path. 
---
The problem isn't with the change itself. It is Blizzard doesn't know when to stop the changes and always swings too far. 
---
One thing that people need to do is attend DPS school. Aggro management in Vanilla is as much about the dps being good at threat management as the tank is good at tanking.
---
If possible play with friends that understand aggro management
---
There was a long period of time(longer than 1.12's deployment) during the pre BC patches where the honor system was overhauled. It still felt like classic, and you probably earned a higher title during that time. The highest rank you had in 1.12 classic was Sargent, and in 2.0x you got up to knight or whatever, but you still filed it under classic.
---
I kind of liked it. Mained a resto druid, basically had to relearn how to heal because WotLK trained me to spam heals every GCD.
---
You have to turn in lockboxes, right? I can't imagine doing this as a non rogue.
---
Not to mention the shitty defense his base has. The holes in the palisade are big enough to move through for pete’s sake! And all the towers at the back of the base! No wonder the orcs lost the second war.
---
As someone who killed 40k-ish pirates to get exalted and maintain honored with Bloodsail Bucaneers. I can tell you there is in fact a way to get exalted with the goblins.
---
Horde pvpers would probably be all at WSG while Alliance would be at AB or AV to queue (Didn't play Alliance so not 100% which is more convenient). It would make any Alliance running from Ashenvale to Ratchet corpse-camped.
---
I had that 15 years ago with three kids, fast forward 15 now and im divorced lol no hassle there when playing Classic :). Can do what the hell i want. 
---
Seems very reasonable. I think we will.
---
It's possible for opinions to be more nuanced than that, you know.
---
That's not as straightforward of a question as you might think.  In modern WoW, your damage is your threat.  In Vanilla, it's about half of your threat, the other half coming from added threat on abilities like Shield Slam, Revenge or Sunder Armor.  So max threat depends a lot on your gear, because the added threat of abilities is static, but your damage isn't.  The general consensus is that the Impale build is the best TPS after late T2 (i.e. you've been farming BWL for a while and have most of the gear you want out of there).  But even there, there's a lot of different theorycrafting out there.  You're also balancing your threat with mitigation.  You can't be too squishy, so you're not taking advantage of some of the best damage gear because it's leather.  And of course, the gearing of your healers matters too.  The better geared they are, the more you can sacrifice armor/health/mitigation/avoidance for higher threat.  A group of blue geared healers isn't going to like you much if you're rocking full TPS gear, a group of BWL geared healers isn't going to care much.

Right, I got that. My question was what are the merits and disadvantages of Battlemasters.

Anyone remember getting on top of sw gates by wall jumping? Or jumping on the torch to get under sw?
---
One of my favorite quest chains, but extremely hard to find people to complete it. Most of the groups I started with usually fell apart when you had to get to Badlands because it was such a long way away and most people didn't have the flightpath. I remember having to backtrack a few times to help groups that were two or three steps behind me in the hopes that they'd actually completed it.
---
Exactly. So the question is, where do we draw those lines? I think it's fair enough to say we should include Battlemasters, but what I'm wondering is, why do we draw the line between battlemasters and LFR/LFD? 
---
yep. From TBC though.

PVP rewards put people in PVP who have no business there.  They aren't there because they enjoy PVP, they're there for the reward of being there.  People who wanted to PVP before they were rewarded for it loved long ass AV.  Do you know why?  Because we liked the PVP.  We didn't need it to end in a hurry, because we were just going right back into the queue anyway.  The people who just wanted it to end as fast as possible so they got their carrot, ruined AV.

I agree with the sentiment not all change is bad. That being said. What you said about people being happy they can finnally get Av badges. No one actually likes 1.12 Av. They like the fact that patch made its rewards more accessible. That way you can farm exhulted in 1-2 Av week ends and never play it again.
---
In my estimation the 1.12 version of AV. Was a stop gap to allow people to get the rewards easily while they worked on actually fixing AV.  I don't think it's a good idea to essentially dump a stop gap to solve a flawed product. The 1.15 version may be deeply flawed but, it has at least some people who actually like it. 
---
Which is why in my opinion though I know this is heresy. Is that the bg should be in its 1.15 version and it's rewards should be plugged into something else. Rather then just having this dumb miserable piniatta I just have to hack at for two week ends to get rewards. 
---
I imagine the only content that could come to Classic besides TBC/Wrath would be entirely new Classic-only content that could include stuff like gear sets allowing for hybrids to shine a bit more.
---
Of course that depends on if Classic is suddenly far more successful than retail and if it's feasible to add more content outside of already existing expansions to Classic.
---
They can still wall jump up the left side of their graveyard

It's a badge of honor though. I did it ASAP at level 20 and I remember looking down at all the other shamans (especially resto shamans) in my dungeon groups who didn't have their water totems yet until the late 20s.

---
Having these instances in the world didn't encourage world pvp. IIRC once the queue popped, you had to physically zone into the instance within about 1 min or you'd get dropped. No one strayed too far from the instance portals. 
---
The very first character I played was a troll rogue, which I leveled all the way to 60. My main was a NE hunter, which had mostly a mix of AQ40 and Naxx gear.
---
This time around I will go Horde for sure and will either play a Tauren Warrior or an Undead Mage. Most likely I will level both, but it's more of a question which one I will roll first.
---
I know how tough it is to level a Warrior on a fresh server as a first character, but I am leaning towards it.
---
/s
---
It's fine just make sure  you bring a priest
---
Yes
---
I don't remember the exact price, but the Thorium ammo was not too expensive. The price does add up over time though. Theoretically you could go with another profession and make more money, but there was one other upside to engineering that I forgot to mention. Hunters have terrible AoE damage (Multishot only hits 3 targets and Volley is garbage), but Goblin Sapper Charges are very powerful and require engineering to use. Not to mention all the other fun toys it gives you access to (Field Repair Bot, Parachutes, Water Breathing, Rocket Boots, Jumper Cables, and much more). If making gold is your goal, then stay away from Engineering. You will be much better off going with another profession. Herb + Alch are my go to.
---
It's hard to say, I'm concerned about overhyping it because of my own love for Classic. All I can say is that while I was nostalgic for the good old days, it wasn't until I actually played on Nostalrius for my feelings on vanilla to turn from "I miss old Thousand Needles..." to "Okay, this version of WoW is a much better experience than current WoW".
---
Because of the shared subscription, I think most current WoW subscribers will try out Classic even if they're not as excited for it as the already existing Classic community. For some they'll be put off, but I also hope that there'll be other players like me who will try it out for the nostalgia, and stay because they feel like Classic is genuinely better than BFA.
---
They've been used on Shazzrah in MC to zerg him. Loatheb in Naxx. Only 2 times I've seen them used on a raid. Im sure there is use in solo play as well but not a deal breaker.
---
How can you even win the game without detect elementals?
---
It was tough for me I started in wrath. Never knew about interrupts or cc's as mdps. Then come cata heroics a complete paradigm shift in difficulty was not easy. I tried my hand at tanking on a prot pally. I remember grim batol being the bane of pugs. I did level a disc priest at the time and enjoyed healing was one of the top specs of the time. I recently started tanking on a warrior with much better success than on my pally.
---
I remember. I remember being an alliance player in front of og, spamming /followme and being killed a dozen times before they stopped and just followed. On top they danced and had fun. There was a rogue in that horde group, named donfernando, who remembered me after that fun climbing session.
---
Donfernando was an undead rogue. Well known for his PvP skills and openpvp actions. One day I was flying to searing gorge. While landing I already saw dozens of skeletons on the ground and I knew what was going to happen. Well, I landed, two red nameplates popped up, and a warrior was hitting me hard until he wasn't anymore. Both red nameplates were just standing there, stepping back and I read an emote in the chat. It was donfernando greeting me. He remembered. 
---
God I love these memories and miss these days. Donfernando, if you read this, this is albanius, EU zuluhed. I remember. Thanks for sparing my life.
---
So, you make an interesting point. I feel that they made a lot of changes because they wanted to make Raiding more accessible. Because let's be honest they put a lot of development work in to Raids, yet only a small percent of the population was actually Raiding. 
---
But in order to make raiding accessible, they had to make leveling irrelevant. Now that ruined the game for a large section of their population. They took the adventure away from the RPGers and tried to force them to become loot-chasing Raiders. I mean if you want to be a loot-chasing Raider, that's how you like to play the game. Some people just want to level and adventure. They literally destroyed one part of the game to force people into another part of the game that they just weren't interested in. 
---
And in doing so......they also ruined Raiding because they had to make it less challenging! 
---
It's kind of like dominos. Blizz set one thing in motion and it ruined a whole bunch of stuff down the line.
---
lol!
---
Maybe the mods can implement sharding or phasing on this subreddit so all the posts go somewhere else and I can't see them.
---
I think that sub is kinda depressing actually. I get people not wanting kids, but some people there don't even seem to understand the basic concept of loving someone you created more than anything in the world.
---
Having kids is like my biggest dream, or at least a very important milestone I want to reach some day, so maybe I'm biased.
---
Not sure how Joana's guide will turn out but you don't need to train every time something's available.  It can be both a time and money sink that's unneeded.  I'd research and plan exactly what skills/upgrades you absolutely need even all the way to 60.
---
Further to the other reply. That's also the dps's fault. You should tell them not to attack until you've got a sunder on the target. 
---
So pull, battleshout, sunder skull, then tab sunder/battleshout spam.
---
If the dps wait for the sunder to appear on skull before attacking you'll have no issues holding agro. 
---
&gt; an amazing wife, two beautiful kids
---
It’s ok you can say the truth, she’s probably not here
---
Not anxious on picking nightelf hunter for first 60, anxious about how many Zoomers or chinese farmers will be doing the same thing, I want to pick the deadest realm possible because server transfers will still be a thing, and im going to transfer over with shit tons of gold twinking my way to 60 with a warrior pally or rogue ganking everybody with fiery weapons from lvl 20 onwards
---
Definitely, early Cata heroics required a lot out of the entire group. Unfortunately this often resulted in players blaming healers. At some point I gave up entirely on PuGs because many players were just unteachable. It's unfortunate that Blizz tried far too late to reverse course on 5-man difficulty.
---
So many memories ! 
---
I am so ready for classic wow too..
---
Do you think being a gnome overall was better at 60 though with escape artist in pvp?
---
I'm really having a hard time between a fury warrior and a rogue. 
---
Sure I love playing rogues, but having the ability to always find and make dungeon groups is too appealing and I like to tank. I could be really happy just tanking dungeons all the way to 60.
---
What do you guys think, I've heard fury is really good late into vanilla and overall a little stronger than rogues
---
15 years ago we didn't even think about it. Everyone i knew thought 8/8 ( or close to ) dungeon set meant you're ready to raid. 
---
We did have a clothadin maximizing his +heal /mp5 and folks used to complain/ make fun about it. Looking back he was way ahead of his time. 
---
Our server was PvP and I can see the mentality of having each class use their proper armor class to increase survival during world PvP and BG situations.
---
Fast foward to a few years ago when I heard about Nost-  "BiS" was a new concept to me which made sense. I made a resto druid and got my pre-raid bis but I still took Full T1 because of the stats ( stam / int) so I could PvP which made a huge difference since I wasn't getting 1 shot in BG's.
---
In the future BiS will be common knowledge ( if not already).
---
Pally and druid pvp was like that.
---
As a hunter, you dont even attack their health. Use mana drain sting to OOM them and that's pretty much your only hope considering their transform spells break all snares.
---
I’m late but figured I’d add some pleb stuff. I used to think when you logged out, your character just sat there until you got back on. So I would make sure he was in a funny spot or something on logout for others to laugh.
---
My cousin and I were rogues and would sneak around Dolanaar Inn waiting for other people to stop by the inn keep or trainer, we’d sneak up on the counter or around the person, /dance and then unstealth. That shit cracked us up imagining what the other person was thinking. In reality I’m sure they saw us sneaking around. 
---
I vote no because I'm against guild banks in general. I believe everyone should own their loot and decide what becomes of it. leaving it up to some central bag begs for corruption even if it is logged. If you have something a guild member might want, advertise it. If you want something a guid member might have, ask around. 
---
Sure, some guilds will make alt banks... some guilds won't. At least it will not be a fundamental functionality of the game. 
---
I'm a fan of running raids with group loot on for trash, only using ML for bosses and the SK loots system. 
---
I'm coming back for Classic WoW primarily to play 2H Windfury Shaman.
---
Ever since they removed that, WoW was never the same for me.
---
I've worn that robe a hundred times at least...
---
Same hair and same skin tone too. I had a rogue though.
---
Aha, alliance to the core here

No. As an Australian player I could never get a screenshot of green lat.
---
I can't speak for private server, but it was my experience during Vanilla back then
---
There's likely a few bears and some Paladins in there.
---
For solo pvp definitely. There were plenty of times I won fights against mages that I would have instantly lost as any other race. Since it's a 0.5 second cast you can precast it as soon as you see the frost nova animation to break it before their gcd is up or time it with a druid casting roots.  
---
Sekiro comes out in 2 days, I can't wait for Samurai Dark souls 
---
Always logged out in a bed.
---
For the first 6 months people were definitely generally more concerned with how they looked than how good the gear was. Tier 1/2 shoulders were Uber status symbols. By the time naxx came out people generally knew about rotations and stat weightings though. People were watching pve dps videos and reading elitist jerks. Warriors were often in devilsaur and pallys in robes etc.
---
Actually centaur rep stops 1 point before exalted
---
I have this exact screenshot, except I'm a cow in it :D
---
Alliance - [Twilight Falls](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=1199) dungeon quest for BFD.  The reward is shit, there are only like 25 mobs that drop the quest item.  Everyone in the group has the quest because some dipshit shared it and you all end up with like 4-7 of the quest items.  Really, we're only here for the wand.
---
Horde -[Verog the Dervish](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=851), not so much because the quest is annoying but because it requires you to kill a lot of mobs in the area to spawn him, then run over to tag him.  Except there's always some vulture who's just sitting there, not in your party who tags him.  Jokes on them, you gain more xp trying to get him to spawn than the actual quest reward.  I skip this and go farm kodos and thunderlizards.
---
It was subtle, but listen for Kevin Jordan refuting one of the callers who stated frost is mandatory for Molten Core.  It's good to hear a dev go against an established myth.
---
You can be a pain in the ass, especially for other melee classes, but you can be a pain in the ass as an arms warrior and you can actually kill things too.
---
Respeccing is expensive and a massive pain, so if you want to go in with your 8/11/31 or 17/0/34 (or whatever other tank combo you try) you just have to know your role. 
---
You can flag carry in WSG and be pretty good, as long as you bring some FAPs or swiftness pots. You can even be flag defense and use the stuns and silences you have and hope that you are annoying enough for the dumdums to focus on you and not on the flag. 
---
In AB you can be pretty good at defending a node if you call early inc, and with shield spikes and the Force Reactive Disk you can make rogues cry.
---
In AV, you could always be useful with all the NPCs - with the current nerfed one, have to wait and see.
---
Now if you and another tank from your guild, or another MT from a friendly guild, can go in together, you can be a massive pain and can really have some fun. 
---
But still, you won't be doing much damage, its not abysmal but it's nothing to write home about. And if you went in as Arms, with the raid gear you will no doubt be getting, you could be a real force and see some of the BIG YELLOW NUMBERS!!!
---
What you have to be is expert at stance-dancing - which tanks (and really all warriors) should be anyway. In vanilla I never had the inclination to respec multiple times each week so I pvped with 34 points in prot for a long time. Some of the best times were in this spec, but when I did respec to Arms for a longer period, the experience is very different and you do feel a bit of a goob for having been in there as prot.
---
So in essence, it can be a lot of fun, you just have to realise that you could be doing a LOT more. People will give you shit, but you have to have a pretty thick skin to be a tank anyway, so I say "Fuck em".
---
I'm looking forward to seeing all of the work you all have put into the guide and thank you very much for letting me know when it's up! 
---
I'm Zamn#9289 on discord if you want to shoot me a message there. 
---
Basilisks were the worst of the bunch, but not really if you kept track of the timers.  If you're doing them for buffs, just buy the quest items off the ah, typically that's what people are farming them for.
---
Not mobile enough to make a good flag carrier
---
This is one of those quests you convert gold into xp and buy the pages off the neutral ah.
---
That's true enough, I don't really think these fights exist pre-C'thun though?
---
If the plan is to primarily deal with premade pvp is gnome still value? I'm in a situation where I want to do everything in vanilla and I'll have a paladin friend play with me at the start but im not sure if hes going to be around by the time bgs are in and I'm also tanking for my friend group and maybe even tanking raids so I'm kinda stuck between gnome and human for all aspects of the game
---
yeah ofc. Frostbolt rank 3 is at level 14, for example, which is right in the middle of Darkshore leveling range. So probably worth the trip to train it
---
You know the red ones inside the crypt have a 10% drop chance.
---
30 minutes to get ready in the morning? Between chores and shower it takes me 45 minutes on a record day. Also,do your kids also not wake up before the buttcrack of dawn? Staying up until midnight sounds exhausting if you have to be up at 7am ...
---
Heh just put them up for adoption
---
Why would you need add-ons for a druid?
---
Pretty sure there’s a stat for Azregos or one of the World bosses where you tank with a VW because he’s immune to knockback. 
---
Dwarf warrior is an optimal PvP premade along with gnome. There is differences between raid optimal and class. For instance, dwarf rogue or gnome are legit as well.
---
However, for priests, no doubt dwarf are needed. Fearward is just too good for premades.
---
 For warriors, orcs on horde side orc because of the stun resist. 
---
I’ve been developing my own step-by-step quest completionist guide for Alliance Rogues, which is currently complete through level 24.
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
If you're gonna be in premades gnome really isn't that special. You'll have dispells for roots and even blessing of freedom so escape artist starts to lose it's value. You'll get more value out of humans sword/mace racial for tanking and dps. At that point gnome would be purely cosmetic. 
---
For me one of the biggest things that made me regret being gnome was that humans were given priority on sword/maces since they get more value out of it so that sucked having to wait for every human to gear up. That could just be a private server thing/semi hardcore guild thing though. 
---
I think we will see exploit-fixing patches. Like nerfing/fixing over-the-top gold farms or game-breaking bugs. 
---
We will not see balance patches. 
---
So I believe in nochanges.
---
**BUT**
---
He posts updates on twitter sometimes. The guide is apparently more or less done, just waiting for Classic beta to release it.
---
Those were the best days of pvp, everyone in t0 and greens and one baller with helm of might. So hyped! 
---
That's exactly what I'm thinking too and while as a Tank i might be able to res things especially having a 5 man group, I feel like seeing the top warriors on pvp servers being human also makes it more of it just being a premade gearing progress more than racials. One thing that does kinda suck is not being able to get the rams and mechostriders as a human but thats more cosmetic. I'm honestly going back and forward with it haha
---
&gt; A quest in Shimmering Flats
---
It's the Scorpid Venom one. The thing about these quests though is you're still leveling, so the xp from grinding on everything there is nice, even when you're out of scorpids in your area grind on something else.  A skinner's paradise, enter shimmering flats at like 32, leave at 35, just make sure you have the best bags you can afford at that point.  This is also when greys start to vendor for 10s.
---
For pvp, will we be required to stand in the pvp room waiting, or can we que while exploring?
---
Chores? In the morning? I wake up, shower, and take a quick breakfast (cereal), and leave. Honestly 30 minutes is me rounding UP.
---
As for the kids--no, we're lucky to have good sleepers. They are usually getting up around 7 AM though, and their mom is helping them.
---
And I'm sorry but getting 7 hours of sleep sounds exhausting to you? That's a bit extreme. It's completely fine for many people, myself included. I'll occasionally stay up til 1 or 1:30 on some nights (raids, or just fun sessions with friends) with minimal consequence.
---
Waiting room
---
We need more memes like this. 
---
You absolutely could in WotLk. Not sure in classic. You get to revered with Bloodsail from killing Goblins, from Revered to exalted from killing Jazzrik in Badlands. After you reach exalted with bloodsail you do the repeatable quest in Dire Maul which raises goblin rep without lowering bloodsail. It's quite a grind. 
---
Can we get a Starbucks in Goldshire then?
---
Can't do it. I don't want to see how low WoW has sunk.
---
And that's the thing. If they quit shitting on their own lore, redesigned classes to be less casual, and dumped the cash shop, I'd absolutely resub. The only reason we're paying Classic is because Blizz has screwed up Retail so badly and we won't their SJW designers touch Classic. 
---
Ya and I think you get 1 rep a kill. 
---
&gt; There's a difference between expansions every 2-3 years and a silver gold edition of a game that's prioritizing on giving you extra benefits the more money you spend. Like, why do I even need to point this out? LOL.
---
Also... thats literally the same as buying a deluxe version of BFA or any xpac lmfao. welcome to the retail gaming industry you fucking mongoloid
---
well hopefully I can tank some 5 mans and dps in raids with my warrior to get some better gear
---
Definitely. I got my pre bis fury gear really quick just from tanking my own groups as fury with a sword and board with ease.  And yeah you can really only get to about rank 9, maybe 10 solo. After that a premade is pretty much required to get the honor for epic pvp gear ranks. You can get Rams as human. A lot of people get the AV ram since it's pretty easy to get and doesn't require the rep. Mechos are dwarf and gnome only though. 
---
Actually, the more I think about it, originally you couldn't get higher than Honored with Bloodsail. The dead end was the quest to get the parrot pet.
---
It's been a long time and a lot of the rep grinds were changed to make previously-unattainable things attainable.
---
Took a SS of my tauren smoking the big pipe in TB when i was younger for some odd reason.
---
I have basically the exact same one 
---
Which is kinda odd considering pservers actually has been trying to recreate the 1.5 version lol
---
Hey, the viewport's not THAT small
---
Do your BiS lists include items for each release wave? I haven't even started mine yet, I'll probably stop being lazy about it closer to release. :)
---
a lot of us didn't assume that(that's why there was a blue post about it, because we have been asking). we've been posting about which version of AV for a long time. we knew there were a lot of changes in AV, and we knew 1.12 was not the ideal version of AV. 
---
blizz has agreed to some changes - as in earlier versions of things, it's not unreasonable to ask for the same thing in terms of AV
---
&gt; A small squad (5-10 people) is the counter to an all out rush by the other team, and WILL win you the game
---
It won't win you the game, but it will guarantee that it'll be a turtle vs turtle.
---
You mean 10min13s videos, just gotta hit that ad sweetspot.
---
#nochanges means nothing added to classic that wasn't in vanilla
---
old AV was in vanilla - it's not a change. it actually was in vanilla for a longer period of time than 1.12 AV
---
You should see a therapist.
---
Such was the custom in vanilla.
---
I remember avoiding guilds that required a screenshot of your UI when applying for raid guilds because I was embarrassed of my standard UI when I saw hardcore raiders had all sorts of crazy mods. I managed to down some bosses in naxx with my standard UI as a main tank and I was proud damnit 
---
This is such a hard choice on one hand being a gnome tank is going to get me my gear for pvp and allows me to raid easier to get more resources but on the other hand if that doesn't work out rip not having sword spec. Hopefully a beta comes out that shows the actual numbers behind it if they differ from pservers at all. 
---
phat loot
---
I played Enhance Shaman in WoD and while I like thought it was a fun playstyle, the no totems and dual wield thing never really meshed well for me. Excited to getting back to slapping dudes with a giant club.
---
How am I biased lol? Im only speaking for myself. I honestly think destiny, the division and everything else is that genre is pure trash.. not trying to hate but its soooo uninspired and just.. boring.  
---
Id like to imagine your reaction when I trashed God of War last year, another recent dull/bland AAA game. (Id give that a 4/10 since its actually close to average, but still lackluster)
---
Yes, absolutely..... After the Naxx patch. After that, they don't have to abide by the "no changes" rule they placed on themselves.
---
Now, what they do after Naxx will depend on how well classic wow has done. 
---
If it's equaled or even surpassed retail wow, I can see them dumping huge amounts of resources into it, basically to make patch 13.0
---
If it's simply profitable, I can see them making minor tweaks or adding a "mythic" type mode. Either way, expect BC and WotLK servers making a debut. 
---
If it's a general failure (from Activisions standpoint), then it will be heavily, heavily monetized. 
---
I worked hard at farming the gold for one of the unarmored ones. I was getting close to having enough and then they released the armored ones. Being a night elf and disliking the armored models for the big cats, I was quite disappointed. I doubt I will play this time around. I have even less time to farm now and still wouldn't have the chance to get one as even if they were in, I wouldn't be able to make it by the time they patched them away again if they did the same as they did the first time.
---
One thing that people keep forgetting, sure there are pre-raid bis lists but getting gear in vanilla/classic takes a shit ton more time then retail. If your dungeon pieces drop and you don’t have your BiS you take them. And 9 times out of 10 you will already be raiding before you can achieve anything close to BiS so that’s why a lot of people were in a mix of dungeon sets and items. A lot of the dungeon sets have bonuses that outweigh BiS until you get a decent amount anyway.
---
We weren’t as skilful and understanding in vanilla, but we weren’t as dumb as people think...(well some were :)
---
hell yeah d2 is where its at
---
Pff freaking like 4 months before BC. My mains were pathetic. I did however make a "twink" lvl 59 mage with BC gear that was pretty gnarly. 
---
My second chance is right around the corner though and I'm stoked.
---
Thanks for the advice. So is Druid not a good class for a newbie? I keep seeing how they’re not common and all they’re good for is healing. I’m not sure I’m comfortable healing to be honest but I did like the fact that druids has exclusive areas to hang out. The idea of that kinda sounded fun.
---
How?
---
Well... let's take a look at what the spells do:
---
Amplify: Increase both magic damage AND healing done to target player for 10 mins
---
 &gt; This is going to be useful any time a player is taking a lot of healing but not a lot of magic damage.
---
Dampen: Reduce both magic damage taken AND healing done to target player for 10 mins
---
 &gt; Useful any time the opposite is true and the target player would be taking a lot of magic damage while not having much healing done to them
---
The real problem is the wording of the spells, no one understands what they actually do at first.
---
I respect your opinion. But I wouldn't take anyone's advice about looter shooters that doesn't play them. By all means think what you want, it has no effect on me at all.
---
Ummmm..... If you're playing on a PVP server, you will learn very quickly to put up mana shield every time before you sit down to eat or drink.
---
Since when is it about how long something was in the game? They already said they felt 1.12 was the most complete version of vanilla.
---
Don't get me wrong, the older AV sounds like much more fun (I didn't do AV back then), but this just feels like moving the goal post.
---
Sure I’ll msg you on discord :)
---
So our bwl strat in retail vanilla was to gather up all the hunters/warlocks and their pets into one spot and spam battle shout on them so all the adds would run to that tank. That's literally all the add tank would do to hold aggro on all of them.
---
The pirates in the barrens give 5 of 3/4 reps and 2.5 of the 4th so grind the thousands to exalted for the 3 reps there and then grind the last one on the pirates in tanaris.
---
Crag Hack OP man. And of course, gotta get them youtube monies haha
---
He's not a video game judge so it's okay to be biased. KFC this is r/classicwow your not paying for professional reviews
---
Those are the best type of quests, grinds that pay out in the end
---
lol
---
I was basically pointing out that his opinion means absolutely nothing and has no bearing on anything.
---
I personally feel like there will be a lot more people on classic that aren't min/maxing then there are on private servers. The dps difference wasn't huge as a gnome compared to humans and even getting edgemasters could close that gap and we frequently had a gnome off tank at times. 
---
Fixed, along with some other set bonuses that were not updating correctly https://itemization.info/item/16897
---
I was big into reading elitist jerks forums for info. I was by no means perfect, but I did have my fair share of rants to guildies that an item isn't necessarily better just because it's purple.
---
Pretty close too how my schedule works. I play 9-1 and wake up at 8, get too work at 830. I hate mornings
---
Your dichotomy is false.
---
&gt; Since when is it about how long something was in the game? 
---
if it was a bandaid at the very end of the content, and for the rest of the time the game worked differently, I think it should be considered to be in classic. we only get one shot, let's get the BEST version.
---
I played in vanilla, I started at 1.5 and played every version of AV, the npc nerf was a huge change, and it was the beginning of the end. cross realm was also bad for AV and other bg's imo. yeah, it sped up some ques, but you lost that sense of community. cross realm is vanilla too, but again, it was a bandaid added at the end of vanilla, and imo it should be left out too
---
&gt; the older AV sounds like much more fun (I didn't do AV back then)
---
well I guess you'll never get the chance, but there's a reason that people always bring up the epic battles in AV that lasted for days - because it was really that cool. wouldn't you like to experience that? there's nothing else like it out there
---
Not 100% about Vanilla/Classic, but in WoTLK you could get to Revered with at least one of the Centaur clans.  You could farm kills to 1 point short of Revered, and then do one (or perhaps a few) quests that would get you into Revered.  As far as I know it was the same in Vanilla, but I never tried it personally so I can't confirm.
---
Just because those pieces aren't "bis" doesn't mean they aren't good to have.  Take for example me.. your friendly neighborhood priest.  well to farm DME im going to need 6K mana.. not all my bis pieces even have int.. so I will still need some of those pieces to farm gold to be able to afford consumables and such.
---
Very good explanation, I share the same thoughts.  
---
High Overlord Saurfang is the chuck norris of Vanilla.
---
He only chooses to not be Warchief.
---
We have a difference in perspective. 
---
I'm not trying to win you over to mine.  But I love those more tactical AV.  It is up to us (the playerbase) to play the game as it's meant to be played.  I'm fine with all-out "base rase" in AV once in awhile, but I'm ALL FOR trying to band together as a team and play a more tactical AV.  
---
Always upvote Mitch quotes.
---
I dont see it
---
Because they are going through alot of trouble just to recreate this game in a more modern architecture, to then start making changes to it, means that now we have Neu-Classic, and the old game is still not preserved, aka does not officially exist.
---
Meaning they are back where they started: Classic does not exist, again.
---
They never made changes to SC/BW when they remastered it, because they knew the audience for that game would have rioted if they even changed 1 single balance thing.
---
Did, and still do. Never stop being silly.
---
I wall climbed Org, got into the crypt near Karazhan, got under the Karazhan instance building with the huge smiley face pasted on the ground.
---
I think that's all I ever did, but for anybody interested in Vanilla wall walking, check out Nogg-Aholic, still my favourite WoW video of ALL time.
---
Honestly had me at the first half.
---
31, gf plays wow, neither of us want kids.  We work opposite shifts, 8 hours of interrupted wow every weekday. 
---
Wall walking was patched out of the game during vanilla, before 1.12.1 I'm pretty certain. However if you found another way to get into these areas I'm sure there will be.
---
I do not.
---
Title made me laugh and was hoping there was a comment about the title to make me laugh even more. Thanks!
---
Its pretty obvious for anyone who played, that 1.12 did some damage to the game. The ease in getting insanely overpowered PvP weapons, rendered much of the end game moot, why bother doing dungeons at 60 or doing the early raids, when the PvP stuff dwarfed it in quality?
---
Notice how familiar that design is? Its because its in BFA right now. Why do anything in BFA upon hitting max level, when you can get free 360 gear, rendered the quests that summarize each zone completely pointless.
---
The catch up mechanics in WoW, are Blizzard's way to try to inflate the number of people who did their newest raids. Naxx, and later Sunwell, were notoriously only experienced by very few people, due to the fact that raiders were a minority anyway, and as they began to dwindle due to fatigue, less and less of them were playing the game when the final raids came out.
---
Level 1-10 sword and shield levels just as fast as a 2h wep and has less down time for a war. 
---
https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-guides/137123-guide-what-you-need-know-protection-warriors.html
---
Horde only attunement. 
---
The entire horde ony attunement. 
---
I usually explain it to people like this. Today, Prot Warrior BiS focuses on mitigating damage by “pushing crushing blows and crits off the hit table”. That’s don’t by stacking defense until you have 440. It’s a very elegant way to make it so damage never spikes, and healing is easier. Warriors with BiS have roughly 4.5k hp. 
---
Back in vanilla, Prot warriors focused exclusively on hit points. Pre-raid tanks would walk into MC with 6k hp. It wasn’t until Vanilla was almost over that we (at least the warriors in my guild) started comparing armor (the damage mitigation listed in the character screen), block, dodge, and parry. We knew that armor had diminishing returns. That was about all we knew about damage mitigation in vanilla. However, I probably would have been smarter if I was more active on the Warrior forums. 
---
Much better to start with 1.12 and then go from there. I guarantee you once classic is old people will start taking about "changes"/additional content/etc, much like OSRS.
---
Have polls with 75% thresholds for changes, see if you can design an AV that actually promotes long matches and turtling, and have the players vote to go to it.
---
That way we start with the high reward/hour version that the min-maxers and efficiency players want. Then once they have their exalted and can play for fun it gets slowed down.
---
No changes 
---
As a rogue main in vanilla this is the part where you go get a sandwich
---
Not having auto attack on 1. SMH
---
1.12 AV was shit. Its after all the patches that fucked it. Blizz has a chance to make AV awesome again and they fucking kill it at birth...
---
Have to agree, LFR was the last straw for me. I think I quit right before firelands in Cata
---
I’d bank on it having similar requirements to retail WoW. You’ll likely need a newish computer to run classic at 60 FPS, even if not as graphically intense 
---
I was rarely lucky enough to find my missing pages on the AH.  I played on a low-pop server so that’s probably why.
---
One big problem for me was how from tbc and on the only thing that seemingly mattered was raid content. They just kept wiping out everything old for more new raids over and over again with no regard for the rest of the game or adding anything to it.
---
Vanilla was so much more than just raid content, it's a shame that raids become the sole focus of the game. After removing the social aspect of them with the 40-man raids you honestly might just spare the subscription fee and go the steam store and pick up any online game that involves pve and get a better experience. The MMO and RPG have been killed and replaced with a lobby for a very mediocre online action game.
---
My friend and I used to get in some heated (though tongue-in-cheek) beefs over the centaur reps, which are like the most inconsequential, pointless reps in game. I would just login, yell “GELKIS TILL I DIE, FUCK MAGRAM” in /g and we’d just set it off. Good times. Furthermore, I had to go Gelkis on all of my alts just to stay true to the set.
---
Fuck Magram don’t @ me
---
I don't want battlemasters, going to the portals to queue encourages world pvp and makes the world more alive.
---
You are going to need prot talents for quite a while - until the raid, or at least the healers and yourself, outgear the encounter. It's all quite hard to say as classic is not really going to be the same as vanilla, the 1.12 talents and extra debuff slots may be enough to allow undergeared groups to cheese encounters and not require tanking talents.
---
All I can say that is in vanilla if you tried to MT a raid as fury or arms your healers could not keep up and you would be squished flat... and wipe.
---
I'm gonna disagree. Look at Bless Online. The industry is hungry for a new MMO. And honestly WoW redelivering on old content is going to be the best MMO on the market. Who knows. There are definitely going to be those that burn out. But this game hooks get set deep once you get that first little milestone for your class. Bear form, charge, polymorph. You keep getting these iconic abilities and they're so good because you just spent 3 hours wacking fucking plainstriders with a stick and watching thorns do the majority of your damage. 
---
Look into M.2 SSD's. I went comically overboard with my PC as well, and I really like them.
---
ah man, good old burning legion. still have all my toons there but the server just hasn't been the same since BC. aenigma were THE guys to look up to; i remember getting to join them for a naxx pug like 2 weeks before BC's launch, think i still have the wand i won for my mage, used that thing til like kara.
---
It’s absolutely *possible*... if you mean *probable*, I’m not sure of the probability 
---
&gt;We weren’t as skilful and understanding in vanilla, but we weren’t as dumb as people think...(well some were :)
---
Yup. I think a lot of this comes from people who were literally 10 when Vanilla was out and didn't understand stats and played for the visuals.
---
Not everyone was a kid when wow came out. :) There might not have been a perfect simcraft for every spec but there absolutely was theorycrafting going on. Spreadsheets, coefficient research, damage formulas, etc.
---
Is that a Scarlet Kris in your hand or are you just happy to see me? ;)
---
You'd be surprised how well you can do with fire in both MC and BWL. The amount of resist and immune is exaggerated. 
---
/r classic wow doubles as an online dads' group
---
Just like Old School Runescape or any other classic relaunch of an MMO, no. Not without new content. 
---
AV was played by most people because it was the most likely place to avoid quick and early deaths due to being undergeared. If you couldn't keep up with the better geared players, you formed a group and hunted out other objectives. Even a fresh lvl 60 could que up in all 50's greens, and feel like he contributed something, unlike in WSG or AB, where they would be a severe handicap vs. anyone even in lvl 60 blues/greens.  
---
AV leveled the playing field, and melded PvE and PvP into one big battle. Each objective would be contested fiercly, and especially early on, the side-quests/turn-ins were crucial to success.  
---
Every class and most specs had something to offer, and often played critical roles in the progression of the fights.
---
I have been playing a private server and I got to see the amount of bullshit that is in WSG. Druids can wall climb to oblivion its really rage inducing. I hope blizzard addresses issues like that.
---
Unless the stats changed I think a Warlock would be fine with their quest staff (19 shadow power only).
---
Your false is dichotomous.
---
I remember going to the mess hall after a long battle at Alterac Valley and hoping that Sergent-chef Sqykq was on duty cooking the meals that day. Delicious poached swoop eggs and turtle meat soup. Perfect meal after a long day of Lok'tar Ogar and work work.
---
That really depends on which part of vanilla you're talking about and how hardcore of a guild you were in. By the time naxx rolled around everyone knew what stats were best EJ had theory crafted the shit out of the game and anyone who cared could read about how to min max their character.  
---
But most peoples first molten core raids? Lots of people wearing dungeon set not because they couldn't get the BiS but because they really thought that was great gear. Unless of course you were raiding BWL and MC when naxx was out that was a much different experience.
---
Good thing I dodged all those bullets. Cept the job. 
---
Some of the "BiS" items are overrated. +heal, for example, isn't very useful if you're always overhealing.
---
Sometimes int and stam are more important for survivability and also a sufficient mana pool.
---
As with anything, you should weight what your needs are as well as your future plans. Sometimes a BiS item isn't suitable until some other pieces have been upgraded first.
---
Don't make me get the blackjack from Foreman Thazz'ril and beat you with it you lazy peon! HOW DARE YOU ASK ME WHAT ME WANT? ME WANT LUMBER YOU LAZY PEON OR YOU NOT GET CACTUS APPLE. I KNOW YOU NOT THAT KIND OF ORC!
---
I had it turned on for server but channels were muted. That shit was obnoxious.
---
Lol I get mad when it’s just be and a buddy and he’s mouth breathing 
---
They've simplified the vast majority the current game to the point of being extremely boring and there is no real measure of failure or success within the game. The same gear is easily available to everyone, stats are mostly fixed and linear, and stat customization is almost non-existant. Talents are basically non-existant, and spells are determined by entirely your specialization rather than having a large pool of shared class abilities. Spells and abilities have been massively reduced to the point of being not even 1/2 of what was present in vanilla. Classes all have fewer unique traits and quirks due to balancing concerns. Mana and other resources have been practically eliminated in all cases, really only healers still have mana. Almost all dps classes all have some sort of pseudo 'combo-point' resource system with no real hard limit like going oom, resources for healers are the strictest but only really exist in pvp, even in mythic raids you almost never run oom. 
---
Stats like weapon speed exist in name only, their only purpose is to serve as flavor text. Professionals are similarly useless, and transparently serve as gold generation tools, some professions like archeology are entirely useless and should never have been added. There are less relevant potions and enchants now than in vanilla, and crafted gear is only useful for fresh 120 characters because even the best crafted gear can be easily replaced through easily attained repeatable daily quest reward gear. 
---
They aren't.  WoW was originally pimping the idea of player housing to better compete with Everquest 2, which had proper implementation of player housing: purchaseable properties, decoration, etc.  It's just one of those things (like Hero Classes) that faded away.  Possibly due to difficulty of implementation, possibly because it quickly became apparent than WoW had beat EQ2 and they could just ignore them.

So defense at 440 makes you critical strike immune not crushing blow immune. Shield block is what affects crushing blows because a blocked hit cannot be a crushing blow and why its so important to keep up. Tanks in the private server scene  focus on threat sets and wearing alot of DPS gear and in some fights dual wielding for threat and they just heal the crits and crushing blows. Some fights like broodlord they'll defense cap but for the most part is very very different from a vanilla experience.  
---
As far as vanilla went everyones experience varies we had a tauren tank who focused solely on getting the highest hp he could and a tank that refused to go below the defense cap to a determent in some cases.
---
Middle of TBC LOL
---
Played since mid vanilla.
---
you que in the room, you can explore while you wait, then you spawn back at the room after the BG
---
I don’t mind transmog, but it would need to be majorly limited. Really, I just want to be able to change the color of robe I’m wearing so my character doesn’t look ridiculous. But it’s definitely not fair if people can look like they are using epic gear when they aren’t. Basically just color switching, not anything epic.
---
Solid choice. When it comes to pure DPS I'm torn between the same for a main as well. Really want to try out hunter too though...
---
Yeah I'm just unsure in terms of tanking how big that sword spec really is as well, also from what I heard a lot of vanilla pve content wasn't hard so I don't really care for min maxing it that much, but I also heard a lot of pvp content required farming and gold so maybe the wep skill makes a difference long term over the time to kill mobs. 
---
One of my favorite things about vanilla/TBC was being able to climb up on things, and just do silly things :)
---
Yeah they do, that's what the mom bucket is for.
---
where is this place?
---
Vampiric embrace , my bad
---
I meant ill miss the leap because you can charge people from. 45m away
---
Agreed. You only needed the Last Stand and Defiance(?) talents in the prot tree if you weren't raiding AQ40/Naxx
---
You could get by A-OK by spending rest of the talents in Fury or Arms
---
Cause it won't feel like vanilla unless we have to go through the hassle of installing the game with the five CD discs provided by that sweet vanilla box (that if failed, you had to start all over again from disc 1) and activating my 14 day trial, not being able to trade anyone or go above level 20, then finally beg my parents to pay for a subscription when I was 12.  
---
That would truly be classic.
---
I dunno... I just did mage and warlock bis lists for the guild and every single piece of their T0 gear is garbage compared to other dungeon drops
---
That screen shot just gave me ptsd.
---
Yep. Kinda silly to base your spec around PvP events that rarely take place to begin with, and are usually over within a few minutes.
---
It's pointless to spec around a PvP scenario that might happen once every two weeks.
---
As much as I hate to admit it, and will be downvoted for saying so. If they brought back old classes, it'd be awful and people would quit due to difficulty. They will NEVER remove the cash shop, we know it makes them an incredibly sizable amount of the money they make from WoW. The lore, it's not as bad as everybody thinks, it's just way more complex than the game shows, you have to know a TON that most people don't know just to get what's happening. I'm not saying the story is perfect, the real travesty is just the perception they gave to the players.
---
I play Retail, every day. But I can't wait for Classic, I plan to take a break from Retail. They are DIFFERENT GAMES in my eyes. Retail is a collection game and Classic is an RPG. And I'll admit, I love collections. But I love RPGs more.
---
&gt;Everyone i knew thought 8/8 ( or close to ) dungeon set meant you're ready to raid.
---
That was not my experience at all.  The min reqs were resist, Stam for all, and +hit for dps.  I was in a guild that cleared BWL. 
---
I played Alliance on Dmaw back during Vanilla. I remember your guild. :)
---
The staff is called Benediction!
---
IMO you could spend a few hundred less than the build listed and still get 1080p 60fps for most games, even at high settings. Less if you are willing to buy used. I run a Ryzen 7 1700 ($150 vs $250) and GTX 970 (old but can be found for &lt;$150) with 8gb of ram and rarely have to turn anything down. I am confident it will run Classic maxed out at 1080p.
---
Plus healing was always useful so you could down rank heals.
---
This is for Australia though. 
---
For the Horde!
---
Yeh people would always ask about your dungeon set progression until about BWL days.
---
Near the end of bwl.
---
So as a rogue no one wanted t1 shoulders when in mc and early bwl, then we all learn about 25% hit, so suddenly t1 shoulders going for alot of DKP, as I think they where the only shoulders with hit until naxx or late aq 40 
---
Early on most people went for 8/8, even casters went for it who were better off buying green gear off the AH. But near the end of Vanilla people got smarter and learned how godawful D1 and T1 gear really was. 
---
You have to realize that vanilla players were 10 year old kids and stay at home dads. It took them a while to figure the game out. 
---
We're getting one of vanilla's maps, not retail's
---
Hey. Im looking for the same thing.
---
Counterpoint: most players on private servers are more hardcore and likely prone to minmax. They want their loot and to get on with it. 
---
BLOW IT OUR YOUR ASS
---
I think Classic is going to last longer than many people, even in the Classic community, think it's going to last. I, personally, think Classic will crest over peak performances of BFA upon release, and then steady out to maybe half of the retail population. Then, it'll be popular during patch downtimes, then not popular when the new patches come out.
---
There has not yet been an MMO quite as dominant as WoW, and that is going to matter. Classic WoW is basically another game, at least that's as far as our argument for wanting it goes, as if it weren't, Retail would be sufficient for us. That being said, this "new" WoW is going to take the market by storm and thrust Blizzard back into the $150+ million a month business they used to be.
---
Overall, I want to play Vanilla at the baseline. There will always be people on the official servers, and there will always be people who have the ability to play Classic, as long as Retail WoW lives. The fact that it is going to be huge is a big bonus.
---
People make these sweeping generalizations of the MMO audience as those who only want instant gratification and cheap rewards.
---
Maybe they're just like that because there's hardly another MMO that isn't instantly gratifying, and Classic WoW will be an eye-opener?
---
Server progression will be fine. Low population counts by our standards were totally par for the course when they were designing Vanilla. That's why, at my baseline, I don't really care if Classic is turbo huge or not. As long as as many people who have been playing pservers for so long and those who have wanted Classic for a long time get on and play, there will be plenty of people to progress with overall. Maybe some servers here or there must be merged, but other than that, it'll be what you'd expect Vanilla progression to be like. Slower than Retail.
---
I played on Burning Legion and remember how high in regard Ænigma &amp; Envy were. Awesome times.
---
And I don't think I had a single AV that didn't last at least 45 minutes, usually many hours, throughout the full last half of vanilla. And I was even on a very one-sided server &amp; battlegroup where the opposite faction always won.
---
After 12 years all we have to go on are contradictory anecdotes and memories. Neither of us can say for sure how this is going to pan out with a brand new, yet more experienced playerbase.
---
Surprise surprise, a coordinated group of 40 people were able to finish AV in 4mins. For the people who just want to enjoy the game and play, this is not much of an issue.  
---
Yup, it needs new shit - and this doesn't mean Burning Crusade.
---
You always keep up dampen magic in pvp. And in pve there’s fights where you give the tanks amplify magic. 
---
And yup mana shield is great in pvp when you’re low on HP but have plenty of mana. Mana shield is a last resort thing because it drains mana so quickly. 
---
For a time being, wouldn't a party allow you to get rep gains without suffering the rep loss, as long as you're just leeching kills?
---
What are garrisons then? Also, aren't DKs and DHs hero classes? (Actually I think I remember now, were hero classes supposed to be like an upgrade of your hero once you reach a certain point or something? Like Dwarf Warrior --&gt; Mountain King sort of thing?)
---
Thank you for posting this because it reminded me of when my guild was raiding BWL... we had a fury warrior who was saving pretty much all his DKP for one sword (I played a mage I have no idea what the weapon was).  It dropped and one of our tanks (I think like 2nd OT) out bid him.  Let's call the 2nd OT Taldor cuz that was his name and the fury warrior Hydra for the same reason.
---
The next raid Hydra is the last person to log into vent.  He must have changed his message that announces when he joins (where the robot voice says this text for all to hear) the channel to "Taldore's mom is my epic mount."  It was the funniest thing... I couldn't stop laughing lmao.
---
That’s funny, I was think I had played a paladin for years, I might want to try a warlock.
---
Hahaha, okay dude, you go solo _even one_ of the lieutenants in 1.11 without kiting them around as a hunter/mage.
---
Their post nerf stats are ~20-25k HP, melee for 500-700 damage, and always patrol with additional guards. Have fun killing one of those alone, let alone "a group" lmfao.
---
In defense of Tauren name puns, WC3 started the bad Tauren = Cow jokes. 
---
Will you slow down your group? Yes leveling as prot you really won't any damage from talents and tanking won't be neccesary.
---
Level as arms. Primarily while leveling you want to prioritize axes(and get axe spec), but before axe spec you pick whatever 2hand with high dps that's slow. 
---
as for stance well you will be stancedancing a bit, a sick rotation a lot of warriors use is at the end of a fight you save up rage in battle stance, you use sweeping strikes, then you go for next pull and use whirlwind in berserker, then go defensive stance and shieldblock. If you are pro you can even do this with a 2hander thne when you switch defense you put on the shield. 
---
You don’t have to go prot. You can main tank every encounter as deep arms or fury. 
---
Yeah I personally prefer it this way even though I have an IRL friend that will be pretty sad as he loved old AV; personally everytime I landed in a match that would last for hours or days I'd get tired of it, the first few times were interesting but then it was just too tiring for what I want to do in a game
---
Pretty sure we'll have the chance to buy them. 
---
Since the initial phase doesn't include 1.4. Unless everything is *already* on 1.12 and is just locked.
---
My server viewed the bogfest AVs as a bad thing generally, kinda surprised by the reaction around here
---
I never played warrior myself but I was told that with the right spec and ability sequence TC is effective at getting initial aggro. TC puts out similar threat as SA (excluding talents).
---
BS is good AoE threat but you only get threat per buffed player *on the threat table*, which isn't the case if you use it right away. I assume you know that but I wanted to mention it for completeness.
---
If you are lucky enough to have 2 good ranged DPS (at least one caster) you can AoE pull in instances for faster clearing. This is where you want to use every AoE possible, including TC which also greatly increases your survivability. This is at least how I've seen good warriors do it.
---
The tanks who *just* LoS pull and stay in def 24/7 are reliable but slow. I can definitely recommend that this is the style every warrior should master first. Faster styles require more fluent gameplay and a group with experienced and reactive players.
---
In any case: Managing threat is in the end a team effort. A tank shouldn't be investing in full on AoE threat when the team wants to LoS pull and follow a kill order and vice versa.
---
You sure you aren't trying to make some kind of fertilizer bomb with all the soil?
---
The idea of BIS wasn't really on my mind from 2004 until close to TBC when I started to use wowhead and switched mains. I never really lusted after gear too often, it was just a fun byproduct of experiencing raids. It was just fun to see the raids dungeons and see what a fully raid buffed character could do. I basically passed on everything unless no one else needed it - except when Talisman of Ephemeral Power dropped, when it dropped I wanted it as bad as every other caster. 
---
Was amusing, thinking back - one of the officers in our raid said to me "now remember, don't use that trinket in raids or you might pull threat" my how times have changed.
---
There were so many dungeon runs where I was only there for the fun of it, and would instantly hop into whatever dungeon was happening or join up a raid just to decurse on Luci even though I had no chance on loot. Don't get me wrong, I love upgrading gear, but back then I treated it more as the result of playing kind of like when you spend enough time in BGs to get the rep items. 
---
When TBC came out was when everyone became more aware of theorcrafting in the game, and way more likely to want to improve their play with the new tools since there were so many more websites and addons and such to help max dps or tank points. Even in vanilla there were times where I knew someone else had more raw +dmg but it didn't matter to me since dmg meters didn't factor into my gameplay in those days, I was just enjoying it.
---
I am almost certain every RP server has a Starbucks in Goldshire.
---
My guild got most of the way through AQ before naxx, they broke up and I quit. No one has any idea how to optimize stats... I think hit being good for DPS was the only thing I ever heard about gearing needs. Played a warrior and a mage actively raiding MC-AQ40 and no one understood shit compared to what's common knowledge now.
---
So I've been *definitely* committed to going shaman for Classic pretty much every since it was announced. But I'm having second thoughts now. 
---
I was looking at other people's vanilla screenshots and I got reminded of how much fun I had playing my hunter. PvP, dungeons, raids....I had a blast doing it all. But at the same time, I think it's best I try and do Classic different than I did vanilla. Switching to Horde, switching roles, etc.
---
...but I found myself torn, suddenly. I think I'll kinda miss the rush of trap management, kiting, managing the dead zone in pvp... farming dungeons solo, kiting mobs into capital cities, all the little things I used to do when no guildies were on.
---
I know in the long run I can do both, but I have to start with something. Shaman or hunter.
---
 
---
Do I change it up and go resto shaman and have a hunter alt? Or do I go back to hunter, knowing that I'll be even better now than I was then, knowing that I do enjoy the class, but at the cost of doing something new with what is already quite old?
---
I know as a Shaman people will just generally like me as a party member more. Disregard skill entirely and they're still totem dispensers. Hunter definitely isn't the best dps, but I was good at it then and know I'd be great at it now.
---
So any opinions? Best to change it up as much as possible, or go with something I already enjoyed a ton in the past?
---
True, everyone just basically assumed the dungeon gear was good. There wasn't nearly as many people hunting outside resources.
---
Karazhan was Vanilla
---
#PlainstrideLivesMatter
---
It’s also dependant on no one from the other team being in the room.  It’s not too hard to mess with the pull (like stunning tank early in pull, fears, little stuff like that).  Good times
---
Thanks for the response! So I would need 2 sets of weapons, a 2-hand axe for battle/berserker, and a 1 hand axe and shield for defensive?
---
haha i didnt know this what quests does he kill you in? 
---
*for the good of Mankrik
---
Fixed it for ya
---
Looks like Ashenvale to me
---
Belinda and Galvangar still exist, right?
---
But what if nostalgia = 0 or 2?
---
Compared to getting epic loot for standing in fire it is like tying a brick to a baby and throwing it in the deep end. 
---
Hoggers gonna fuck a lot of people up.
---
Yeah definitely
---
heyoooo
---
haha man I love this!  
---
Stuff that people do that just won't be done anymore, arcane shot, serpent sting on the boss etc. I see a druid moonfiring as he runs. Like min/max just won't allow for this on classic release, but so good to see.
---
Then getting hit by a bus after not putting on clean underwear.
---
Nice graphics for 2005, most screenshots I see from that year look pretty rough.
---
What sort of sick machine were you running? Got a GeForce 7800?
---
Night elf staring area is definitely my favorite. 
---
Best leveling for warriors is Arms with the slowest 2H you can get and hamstring kite stuff back and forth. It minimizes downtime while killing things at a good rate. Not as fast or efficient as other classes but it works very very well (I was quite skeptical until I tried the whole hamstring kite thing).
---
Since you are leveling with a Warlock then his VW will probably hold agro most of the time and in this case it doesn't really matter your spec. Generally arms is better though simply because offhand +hit chance is pretty high and you don't find any +hit gear while leveling.
---
ahh. disregard.
---
I'm just curious if you're excited for WoW so that you can mount up to vanndars room and kill him in 5 minutes like people have been doing on retail for over a decade.
---
Because the idea of 3 day AVs excites me. I can leave when I'm tired, and come bqck 10 hours later when I'm raring to go again.
---
can’t wait to eat this goof
---
I have to disagree with the boring part.  I think it's far from boring.  I participated in many TM/SS battles and they were always a thrill.  The more the merrier.
---
So basically you had more in common with the nochanges crowd than you though, but you got upset about a hashtag rather than figuring out what people were actually saying. 
---
I am the Gulbeleglim, the shwabble-dabble-wabble-gabble flibba blabba blab...
---
That's not what people was saying though, they specifically asked for an unchanged 1.12 version of the game. 
---
Cow wash station - no wax please. Fresh grass scent.
---
They're pretty similar really. Raiding wise mage will start out weaker, but by the end of bwl and into aq when mage can go fire I think they should be right up there on dps. In PvP mage is a bit more useful in group combat, rogue is very easy to kite and cc unfortunately although it's very satisfying in 1v1 to control the fights. I think rogue is a bit more 'fun' with stealth, blind , kidney shot, rotation etc, but in general less powerful than mage.
---
Not really.
---
This is very helpful. Thanks!
---
No way were they over quickly or decided in under a minute.  When I was participating in the TM/SS battles that was not my experience at all.  Players were running back to their corpses, eating/buffing up out of sight, and then they rejoining the fray.
---
Play WoW with wife after kids go to bed. Win-win.
---
Druid is fun, but yeah if you don't want to heal it's hard to recommend. You can sort of make feral work but you're still a bit of a RH stepchild, don't expect to be welcomed into any pugs as dps, and you'll have to prove yourself in a guild.
---
I don't really get your first Pro. Players need to be in capital cities to use the battlemasters. I mean after queueing they can go wherever they want but that happened before BMs too. In that aspect I see it pretty much as the same as no BMs except if you actually wanted to be in a city (which I do see as an advantage but I don't think that's what your first point says).
---
We should get buffs to those specs during TBC and wrath.
---
Seriously, not all specs are good for everything and that's the way it should be.
---
Ret/enhance: great for leveling. Prot: good for leveling, can tank most 5 mans fairly well. Elemental: the most popular pvp spec.
---
Mailing multiple items at once.
---
Mana shield is also used a lot in aoe grinding before 40, when they get ice barrier while collecting mobs.
---
I don't think sword spec matters as much for tanking as it does for fury. You might get a bit more threat but that won't matter too much since some people will say night elf makes the best tanks for alliance.  Especially if you don't play on min/maxing and going hardcore. 
---
The only decent feral set in the game really is the rank 12/13 pvp set (ie poop-socking pvp'er set). All the pve gear is basically really random rogue offset pieces + the feral specific ones (wolfheads/gnomer mace).
---
Both class are really fun. However soloing dungeon as a rogue will be pretty hard (very stuff and weapon dependent).   
---
As a frost mage you can do pretty much everything with way less stuff. It is the only class who can easily solo farm crocodiles in ZG for example.
---
I hear this question all the time and though I’m not a hardcore PVE guy it just seems like if you try hard enough, put in enough hard work and time for consumables and stuff why not? It’s hard to get 40 people together for a raid, it’s even harder to get 40 competent people who are skilled together. Would you rather have a Human Warrior who doesn’t really know his class doesn’t use consumables and shows up to 75% of raids? Or a Dwarf Warrior who understands his class goes all out on consumables and shows up for all raid. I’d go with the Dwarf.
---
Check the World of Roguecraft videos.   
---
It's pretty awesome to see how broken the game can be.
---
Ah, love the aesthetics of tanaris.
---
Yeah, but are they necessary to kill if your side has good enough gear?
---
They're different systems. If a LFG queue pops, you can accept the invite from anywhere in the world. You can do quests, or farm herbs, world PvP ect. With the old instanced system you're talking about, players still needed to zone in once the queue popped. This restricted them to hanging out by the portals. If they could accept the queue from anywhere in the world like LFG, then it would be no different then the Battlemaster system with the added bonus of going to Ashenvale to queue up. So basically it would make queuing for BG's more annoying with no additional benefits. I get where you're coming from, but the Battlemaster system is the way to go.
---
Wtffffff
---
lol this fuckin sub 
---
Ah that’s unfortunate. Well I could always roll a gnome. Though I can’t decide if I want to play a warrior, warlock, or mage as one. Rogues don’t really interest me though I guess you can blame bfa for that because I mained one and it didn’t catch my interest and DK wasn’t until Wrath I think. Which would be recommended?
---
Detect elementals: far right bar, 5th down, to the right of cooking fire, just below detect undead.
---
then just leave arrow key left and right bound...
---
Shoutout to Kargoz, dude is legit. Very passionate about the game and gives you insane detail into vanilla. Him and Frostdumas (sp?) are the only guys I can still watch to this day.
---
I don't think leveling as a Warrior is *hard*, but it is relatively slow compared to other classes. I don't think any of the classes are *hard* to level, though, so maybe I'm not the best person to chime in on this.
---
Sounds like you're the one who was confused. Pservers have progressive content. Players are aware of that since they often start off without conveniences like fishing schools. 1.12 client =/= 1.12 patch.
---
Not many people associate it, but 1.7 introduced bg holidays. This rewarded bonus honor for certain objectives.  I believe it had the effect of players, especially honor grinders, of being less patient of long drawn out games and siding with the zergers.
---
A little overblown yes but it is undoubtedly the slowest and most unreliable. This leads to players being greedy/impatient and dying more. 
---
A mark of a true good warrior is ability to level fast and safely.
---
If you want a tactical AV, play a pre-made. Trying to do speshul taktics in a pub is like pulling teeth.
---
You have 83 charges on your deadly poison.
---
Why are you using deadly poison? Why are you pushing useful debuffs off the boss?
---
Frostadamus is awesome as well. I was able to copy his ui onto a tbc server and loved playing with it. 
---
Honestly, it would be nice if they could make this a sort of alternate timeline. 
---
I.E. Deathwing is introduced as a world boss, and if he dies enough times Cataclysm never happens, or something.
---
Hunter bow quest and probably the priest staff quest. 
---
I forgot that a ton of people on reddit are autistic to a certain degree
---
You're insane 
---
I'm not sure what all the regions are but I think its something along the lines of US, EU, Latin America, Oceanic and SEA. That's 5. 
---
If each realm holds 5k players aprox, and there are 4 realms per regions that's a total of 100k(5x4x5k) players (I know you said likely more but if you double that, I still think you're off).
---
This (mine) is totally an uneducated opinion but I think you're off by a factor of 10. I'd be looking to millions of players in WoW Classic.
---
If you die over by the river separating barrens and durotar, but near orgrimmar, you don't go to the orgrimmar graveyard you go to the valley of trials. I was not pleased when I discovered this.
---
One of your warlocks thinks Primus sucks
---
I would say rogue is way worse. You take way more damage, do about the same. Sure you can escape easily and use stealth and cc, but ultimately the problem is that you have to eat all the fucking time, if you think warrior needs to eat then you have not played rogue.
---
overblown, they can kill fast and with little downtime but have fewer answers to emergencies.  they arent T1 levelers but arent bad either, they rely on gear more but truely you only need weapon updates more than the rest. World pvp is where they seemed all or nothing.
---
This, it’s all relative. As long as you have food/bandages warrior is fine, you just have to a bit more patient than adderall playstyle of hunter/warlock. At most it’s going to be something like 25% slower to level, it’s really not a huge deal.
---
Nice - that is my preferred variation of resto. I don't place a high value on natures focus though and instead go 3/3 imp rejuv and 1 point in imp regrowth. That's on the theory that I shouldn't be getting hit while I'm healing...
---
The crit build is also intriguing - I think I prefer the moonglow 25/0/27 build though - regrowth is hard to sustain
---
It wasn't just Private servers, Back in vanilla it was exactly the same Alliance can do the same by their graveyard however it was a bit trickier than Horde, I remember coming out of a raid back in the day and hearthing to IF and horde had wall climbed up the pillars to the bank and got on top of the repair house and summoned in a raid and was just ruining the Alliance i also remember being able to do the same on top of the IF bank also.
---
Though with that said i am pretty confident this will be fixed as they got rid of all the wall climbing in Cata or wrath it think and Classic will be using the current engine just back dated.
---
Troll shaman. Easy to get raid spots if you want to heal, which you can easily do as an ele hybrid. Also you can nuke dudes in PVP. I'm going troll shaman too but will be doing enhancement which is much less popular in raids. But I just love the troll 2h animations too much.
---
I LOVE Brill! I love the creepy little music that plays when you're in Brill. It's the number one reason why I want to roll an Undead.
---
I think its been crunched and fury is far and away better depending on how crit will work. This changes at 40 where arms catches up and maybe surpasses fury but fury has much better talents for grinding out mobs, healing and 25% dmg when crit as well as attack speed on crit. Howl is one of the few escape and catch mechanics also.
---
This guy knows how to dad!!!
---
Y-you don't understand! Private server heroes BTFO in Classic! P-private servers bad... :(
---
You can tank as any spec while leveling up. Just throw a shield on and you're good to go.
---
Imagine wanting to gear up a tauren druid more than picking out clothes for your children that look so good you would think they had an 8/8 bonus.
---
It's actually *over* yonder. 
---
At some point in Classic's life there won't be anything to gain from anything and players will just play for the fun of it.  For many that's AV, but it will be a lost cause if all it becomes is a zergfest.
---
[Yes.](https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v409/JakRathal/d6cf1bec.jpg)
---
Buying a lvl 100 character.
---
Ruins it for me.
---
Also heirloom gear.
---
Too many portals.
---
The reason why uber and food delivery apps peaked. People want as little social interaction as possible.
---
I’d agree rogue is definitely worse, at least until the 30s when you get kidney shot and poisons and some decent dps talents. They’re ok after that.
---
If you keep up on your engineering it's not bad at all.  Even on a PvP server.
---
If by classic servers you mean legacy servers of any old expansion. Then yes, sort of. If they continue releasing old expansions, especially with some sort of seasonal system to them. Then there's a possibility most of the playerbase would spend most of their time playing those instead of the retail expansions. But if they just release vanilla, no. I don't doubt that it will stay alive for pretty much ever. But it won't grab the attention of most players for very long. 
---
Don’t know much about the PvE side or Locks but I mained a Shaman from vanilla till cata. But I’ve recently leveled a NE Druid to 43 and a Troll Shaman to 41 just to gang in STV what I can tell you is as a Druid I HATE opening on Orcs with pounce, not to mention trying to bash them in bear form it’s fucked. And as a Troll Shaman I can’t tell you how many charges, bashes, cheap shots, HoJ’s that have landed on me, I seem to never resist/dodge them. If you even consider pvp as a Shaman I think Orc is the only viable option. Stun resist imo is the best pvp racial in the game. &gt; WoTF.
---
An alternate timeline deal would be neat.
---
Intim shout + run is a pretty reliable escape from any pve situation. There’s  also not many better feelings than sweeping strikes retaliation to wreck a group of unexpected adds (like roaming dog packs in desolace).
---
Vanilla runs stupidly well (like 250+ fps easy on max settings for i5-4670k @ 3.4ghz and a 980 Ti), but we don't know the impact the 7.3.5 client will have on that. Hopefully optimisations will make it better but it could make it worse. 
---
going into melee against a rouge or warrior is stupid, why do that when druid is best kitter in the game
---
Runescape "peaked" in the old days though. WoW didn't peak during vanilla. 
---
I think that’s the first changed I’ve wanted besides server pop. But if it doesn’t happen I’m completely fine with that too. :)
---
I like how you still use Rhok'delar in AQ40. This for sure is Vanilla.
---
1. Flying Mounts - Trivialized the scale of the world and killed the old style of world PvP.
---
2. Homogenized classes - Made classes less unique. Every class had a self sustain, mobility, ways to break out of everything, etc...
---
3. LFG - Again trivialized the scale of the world. People spending more time in the major cities.
---
Misc others - Getting max level doesn’t feel like as much of an accomplishment. Getting epic gear doesn’t feel like as much of an accomplishment. Faster paced gameplay compared to the slower more methodical style of Vanilla. Professions feel more useless. A lot of the content in live is frustrating and you end up feeling like some of the other players you get grouped with are the enemy and not the content.
---
I just discovered this show on Monday and I am already a huge fan and the episode with Kevin talking warrior was awesome. All I felt was missing and really wished someone would have asked him is if they even considered Titans grip for warriors in classic. I was surprised it never got mentioned. Gonna go listen to the mage episode now 
---
Coming from console’s my whole life though, I used to mash CSS and CoD4 on PC then made the switch. Controller does come more naturally!
---
If you can keep your weapon and gear up to date then it’s a breeze really because of how immensily warriors scale with gear. 
---
On a full PvP server, the bird quest in shimmering flats. There are like 7 spawn points for the birds. And you need 10 items or something from them. Granted the drop rate is pretty decent, but you have to pretty much camp an individual spawn fighting against other players for the tag, both your own and the other faction. It's also part of a relatively long quest chain, don't remember if the reward is any good, but still, kind of sucks to just leave it. 
---
Hope you get fired.
---
So glad to hear you found the show and that you’re enjoying it! I’d love to ask Kevin more but I don’t want to push my luck with his time haha Thanks again! 
---
You are forgetting the idiots that managed to pull half the base, and then repeatedly pull those quest givers with a gazillion hp / quick respawn.
---
But with only leveling gear you miss with your offhand a LOT. Just something to keep in mind.
---
The lack of keybinds and actually watching you just click stuff on your action bar just makes me so happy. I smiled the entire time I watched this 
---
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. Great and useful advice!
---
I don't get it though..
---
&gt; I do not like all of the WotLK changes, but I want them anyway, because that is what it is, and I'm not going to presume to be the arbiter of changes.
---
Why don't you want the things that you actually prefer? This just makes me feel like #nochanges is just a brainless chant just for the sake of it. 
---
I understand if this was real talk and blizz was going to release wotlk and you want to stick to #nochanges. But I see this post more like you are the arbiter of changes, the "classic wotlk" devs come and tell you: We're going to tailor the game to your liking what do you want? And you'll just tell them to keep it the same even though you don't like all of it just because "it is what it is"?
---
Make one a pocket healer lol
---
Headless Horseman event was in TBC, not Vanilla.
---
The eastern nipple of Tanaris. You run from camp to camp killing the pirates. It's like 5 rep per kill. It suuucks.
---
This is why I don't trust them to make new vanilla-esque content for Classic like so many here seem to want.
---
Rags would be the only one really in MC. BWL got a bit tougher. Nef for sure, but there are a number of checks along the way that can be squeaked past with consumes.
---
Raids are pretty much designed to be hard until you get some of the gear from that raid. So until you're downing bosses, you may need consumes.
---
In AQ40, there are a number of fights pre-cthun that definitely require consumes. I forget the name (huhuran?) who dumps massive nature damage and until you have the resist gear (and even when you do), you'll need a lot of protection pots.
---
It's important to remember that the game is designed around a 1% shift in stats making a huge difference in outcome. And pots give you that shift.
---
fury warrior is godly in 1.12 but needs lot of gear , the ability to make/find dungeon easy is a plus over rogue.  
---
i was playing holy paladin in vanilla , i want to make a warrior too for the same reason but i'm not sure if i'll have the time for it , it needs a lot of farming , i think i'll be going back to that paladin love ;o with an Alt mage
---
You can't get Syndicate exalted. It stops at either at or 1 rep before friendly.
---
What about both? Re release the set but with some new features as well such as pets, and behind the scenes of rebooting classic etc.
---
People who own the original collectors addition get to ‘upgrade’ for free, maybe some sort of exclusive item too? 
---
People who don’t own the original set can purchase the new one. 
---
I remember one list that ranked a +28 healing wand as best until naxx... but there was a +15 healing wand with something like +10 stam and int. Which to me, was far superior.
---
Who names their character "Yes"!?
---
Are you sure? According to http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/thread-4725.html from 2006, 1.10 updated it from green, changed the name and the stats.
---
&gt;Skull of Gyth -- Renamed Gyth's Skull of &lt;random resistance&gt;
---
&gt;Before: Green 685 Armor / 15 STA
---
&gt;After: Blue 509 Armor / 20 STA / +9 Defense / +15 resistance of whatever type you get
---
I wasn't playing a warrior during vanilla, I don't have a clear memory of it. But every pserver I've played on has had the updated version from the start, which while not a huge deal in terms of power is still incorrect.
---
I think he means low DPS.
---
My routine is not too far off yours, and 7 hours of sleep is a luxury, normally I just play/watch TV extra and get 6-6.5 hours
---
i want long ass battles because there's nothing like that anymore. i remember as a kid my first time summoning the giant ass elemental and i just stopped playing to watch what it would do
---
By the time you finish that quest, you just ask yourself "Maybe I should just commit and grind 24/7"  
---
Terrible advice from private server kids in this thread. Raid costs are quite low, and can easily be kept as such. No, you aren't required to flask for a boss to speed run. That wasn't the norm in vanilla. No you don't need to world buff for every raid. 
---
The cost of individual materials is yet to be seen, as new min maxing will likely make things like runes go up in price. However dire maul herb farming will likely be in effect. We also need to see realm size vs. Pop vs spawn rates for lotus.  
---
Now, sure I'm a progression fight you might want to flask, but if a few casters not flasking is the reason you're failing get a new guild. Even end game naxx a single flask should last you 4h loatheb sapph kt .
---
Prot pala (i see them similar) was the first character I top-lvled, I just loved that ability to constantly receive less damage and generally run with shield and feel myself an armoured turtle, also I got notorious as the tanking guy and was regularly invited to dungeons :)
---
You won't be slowing your pack too much if you tend to lvl in group, but solo is definitely slower.
---
I'm guessing this would be worth doing a lot more on the alliance side as everybody wants to ride around on a tiger.
---
Healers can make gold. Did you watch that derp hamsterwheel or something?
---
I was rogue. We ended up getting boosted by two Naxx geared DPSers. 
---
You may be underestimating how expensive those guild bank slots are with vanilla income.
---
&gt;The lore, it's not as bad as everybody thinks,
---
EXTREMELY HARD DISAGREE
---
I have been a massive lore nerd since 2008. BFA is the first time I have genuinely ***abhorred*** Blizzard's writing.
---
My personal experience was quite fun. I was a end game resto Druid and while I my set up was mostly tier gear. Once we had bwl on farm and most of aq40 I started experimenting with mp5 build. I got every leather/cloth end game MP5 gear including the world boss drop staff. It was an insanely fun build. However it did rub one of my guild leaders the wrong way because I dropped off the top of the healing list when using it, but after explaining I never went oom and how my intervate was always used on our other healers they gave in and saw the validity of my support build
---
It wasn’t the best build for every fight so I would switch sets but it was really fun and viable as a support healer in long fights.
---
Not sure if anyone ever played mp5 resto druid In vanilla but I would love to hear about it.
---
Really need to consider raiding. Sure in a purely min max lineup a power infusion priest can replace a shadow but having one isn't the end of the world. As stated anthema is too strong to pass up. 
---
prepare to be downvoted by people who think prot is the only way to tank.  
---
Yeah but your kids don't have horns though...
---
Doing yourself a disservice only for the fact that without experiencing it yourself you will not be able to truly understand why these things are in such a poor state. 
---
The cash shop is relatively inoffensive beyond being completely distasteful with some recent additions. 
---
I mained a warrior from late vanilla through wotlk. I thought 40 was a big QoL boost as the talent trees come online and your kit starts to flesh out. There's a reason that the population of warriors is so high, each spec is different enough for variety and they're all good!  That being said I'm rolling shaman this time around. 
---
Honestly 1 of 3 things will happen.  
---
1. vanilla dies  
---
2. vanilla succeeds and after things finally get stale way down the road they decide to progress to BC (which i would personally love. i dont think anyone really hated bc as for the most part it kept true to what vanilla wow was)  
---
3. vanilla succeeds but no one wants it to follow the classic wow path into new expansions. but how does that keep people playing for years? it could take an OSRS route, which i think would be cool. new content gets polled before implented into the game, the game never goes past lvl60 but instead adds new content for players/guilds to do past naxx and stuff. because the reality is if vanilla succeeds and the community refuses to let vanilla turn into BC servers. there has to be SOMETHING past vanilla once everyone who sticks around has done everything.
---
People have talked a lot about it. Basically what we know (for now) is:
---
* 1) There will be a gates opening event.
---
* 2) It will give the rewards, just like it did back in the day. (It's doubtful that the rewards will extend to a player's retail account - given what we heard at blizcon.)
---
What we *don't* know:
---
* 1) If bliz will alter the turnins in any way.
---
* 2) If bliz will alter the quest and quest turnin timeframe in any way.
---
This. The second-in-line piece for most pre-raid BIS is still not dungeon set, it's just another piece of obscure gear.  
---
There's a lot of cases where wearing a green is still better than wearing the dungeon set.  
---
2% hit leather shoulders from BRD quest for example.  
---
the biggest fail in my opinion were
---
the talent reworks and skilltree changes after wotlk / short before cata. i mained pala and the holy power mechanic just killed the class for me. everything felt clunky and bad. 
---
I have come from the future to warn you all that removing Thrall as Warchief can lead only to dark times. 
---
It's not hard. It's just warriors being crybabies about everything lol. They are sad because they can't solo everything without a pocket healer.
---
If someone tells you to shut up and heal, leave the group, raid or guild.
---
Live is short and shadow and feral are the most established speccs, from all the hybrid speccs. 
---
Personally I find the cat rotation too hard, but there is a fair amount of people wanting to feral tank. The tanking gear is very niche equipment, you should have no problem getting to a good spot early on. Off tank feral has a lot of advantages. 
---
I don't know about shadow, but I think their biggest advantage is, that they can specc a decent amount of spell hit in their shadow tree.
---
But of course you can go warlock or rogue.
---
Rogue was my main until wotlk, I have nothing but love for the class. 
---
it depends if you are a good player or not, u can be quite useful in ab defending flags, u can peel in wsg and tank in av.  ITs not as bad as people make it out to be but honestly I would just farm the 100g to respect every week if you want to do any serious ranking as people wont want to premade with a prot.
---
Probably not until I started playing on private servers. When I was playing in vanilla I just listened to my friends who told me to play dagger rogue, go elemental LW and all other kinds of awful advice.
---
uhh no arms&gt;fury
---
How would they add new raids without fucking up the power creep? 
---
I think it isn't possible to add viable raid content without adding something that has better gear than naxx, but then full geared 60s would kill 5 fresh 60s ez
---
It's not hard, it's just a bit slow and most people find the idea of auto attacking until level 40 a bit mind numbing.
---
On the private server I played, population approx 100-200 based in Aus, the rep farming to start the quest chain caused a lot of tanking and corpse camping. The alliance guy going for it had a bad rep with horde players, so when people were aware they were there farming it, we’d split and until we found them and then camp them until they logged for the day. 
---
In original vanilla I think most people didn’t know the requirements for the rep grind, nor what the reward was for doing it, so it may not have been too contested. Now that it is such easily obtainable public knowledge, I think the race to get the scepter first will be intense 
---
Yeah it's honestly not nearly as bad as people say. At least it wasn't way back when I did it. Though to be honest, I was young and lost track of time easily, so maybe that's why I feel like it wasn't too bad. I didn't get all the way to 60 because I was just trying him out, but at the very least I didn't find any major problems on my 1-30 journey in vanilla as warrior. 
---
Sweeping is good but intimidating shout has a cooldown of 2mins or more I think there are parts of the game where you will be using piercing howl often. Besides overpower gaining 50% crit /deepwounds impale/sweeping the tree has a lot of pvp utility or talents you actively want to avoid utilizing in pve (like stance dancing). The first 10 points are mostly a waste, then you get deepwounds and impale much later.
---
Fury is  5 good points, 5 wasted, 4 great talent point spots and 1 lesser, then you get enrage. This might be less effective than arms if you are using a swing timer and can't force enrage, but I doubt it.
---
... Fear Ward is by far the strongest priest racial
---
Cool story brosephina.
---
I don't know.. I mean WoW has changed into what it is today for a reason, and that was to adapt to what the market wanted.
---
Maybe it has gone full circle by now and ppl are back to wanting this true RPG experience, but i doubt it tbh. I'd really love that to happen though, because i really miss that type of game. 
---
It can also be very hard as a new player to get into a game that is so old, even if the game is incredible.
---
I like 2h Fury then switch to arms at 30, maybe even earlier, most say wait until 40 for Mortal Strike but Anger Management is really nice for leveling. I also like Arms more for tanking as you can switch stances and keep 25 rage.
---
More important than spec will be to keep a tanking set on hand while leveling. Even that won’t matter much until higher levels though. 
---
2handed fury, nobody should ever use melee dual wield for leveling unless forced to (rogues).
---
yeah it's definitely worse for some than others. priest is not great, but not terrible. priest t.5 is actually pretty decent -- better in some cases than t1, which ain't all that bad.
---
mage t.5 is shit tho
---
Oddly specific meme but alright
---
+heal also isnt really useful before a collective certain point, around 250. before that you can't really meaningfully downrank
---
To be fair besides theme styles i don't think it's gotten any better even with retail addons, i've seen some vomit worthy elvui configs.
---
do you have a source?
---
Oh yeah. I was addicted to wall climbing back in the day. I tried to to walljump every building in thunder bluff, i nearly did it
---
I made my brother farm herbs and ore along with forcing him to sit through LFR for purples. Am I Dad now?
---
Nobody really gears that way anymore though. It is all about maximising threat while  not gimping eHP  too hard now.
---
My experience as resto, you end up 90% of your time spamming healing touch 4 and 5.    I'd get bored and start sneaking in rank 2 regrowth here and there.  Unless you are the druid with the most +healing, then you can rejuvenation the tank too.
---
I'd also spec into insect swarm as sometimes they'd let me keep that up for the debuff, but not every fight.
---
Tbh the best was keeping an eye on the other healers, if they pull aggro, go bear and stun or taunt and bring it back to the tank.  And then more spamming.
---
&gt;I was in Broken later. We rolled as a unit everywhere we went. 
---
Usually with a some freestyle rap to guide us along the way. (I was also in Broken) =]
---
Timbermaw rep grind wasn’t too bad, I was getting eko and firewater at the same time. Turning in the beads, 5 at a time for about 4000 beads... hurt my wrist/hand. I later learned you could get an add on to auto turn in... fml
---
Perkele!
---
Wow I had never heard of this somehow.
---
That's amazing!
---
Another neat vid of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elEeEWR4bbw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elEeEWR4bbw)
---
I mean... You can already wipe the floor with people if you have naxx gear anyhow. Adding a T4+ at 60 won't really do anything to the power creep. Not any more so than a level 70 wipnig the floor with 5 60s.
---
Just gotta make it incremental.
---
You member when 4 digits was godlike? I member.
---
Yes.
---
It isn't superior because by the time you get down to your last 150 mana (that 10 int) you would have casted so many healing spells which would gain from that difference of 13. Ironically you would have to downrank to even be able to heal with just 150 mana. If you are in bad gear you might choose the int/stam/healing over pure healing but wands tend to have bad stats and worse spell power, so the green is BiS.
---
Yes. Because no one knew what they were doing in vanilla. It took years after the fact to perfect strategies. I did raid then. The core concepts have changed a LOT since then. A fresh server today can clear mc way faster than a three year old server then.
---
&gt;staying up until midnight sounds exhausting
---
Get a load of this normie 
---
&gt; Can you seriously not see how running into those types of people constantly might kick your enjoyment of the activity down a few notches?
---
No, because I'm not 14 anymore and I have more confidence in my ability to play and enjoy this game than what random strangers on the internet tell me. Maybe they have a point, maybe they don't. Instead of crying like a child that people are mean to you, it might be better to actually research and get an opinion whether a certain race/class combination:
---
* is a viable raiding spec (i.e. it can be done)
---
* has been/will be accepted in raiding groups by speaking to recruiting GMs (i.e. it can be allowed in a raiding group)
---
* there are videos of certain race/class combinations raiding up to Naxxramas on the internet (i.e. it has been attempted/done before)
---
Overall, those arguments are a far better counter to all the people who would tell you otherwise than jerking each other in threads like these that everyone who tells you that you can't raid as a *insert whatever here* is a min/maxing elitist asshole jerk who will hate playing this game because Vanilla is all about the journey and [insert 20 more minutes of regurgitated bullshit here]. 
---
Warrior being the most-gear dependant class in the game means it's leveling experience is the one that varies the most.
---
Having the best gear available won't you the fastest at leveling, but It will be a very enjoyable and fun experience nonetheless.
---
Although, it's unrealistic to expect up-to-date gear (weapon especially) throughout the entire leveling experience so when your gear starts to fall behind, the class's output suffers as well, and more so than any other class.
---
But on a PVE standpoint this is still fine. Just don't expect to beat other classes at solo leveling as it won't happen. 
---
Also not falling behind in levels plays a big part as well. Finding yourself in a situation where you gear is falling behind and you have to face mobs higher than you on top of that will surely make things a lot worse. This was / is? quite common in the private servers area as a lot of quests wouldnt work properly and this would lead to people struggling  to level outside of dungeons which would result in having to do higher level quests.
---
Where I can see the nightmares happening imo is when you add world pvp into the mix ; Stranglethorn being the first area that comes up to my mind.
---
If your gear is behind and you are already struggling with pve and people start jumping you, you will get irritated quite quickly as warriors have next to no answers to emergencies compared to other classes. And not being able to charge when already in combat means that we are put at a huge dissavantage when a range class starts picking on us. Mages and Warlocks initiating a fight with me while I was already busy fighting mobs did give me nightmares.
---
With all that said, Warrior's problem is mostly downtime due to health issues and inhability to get out of shitty situation. Add a healer into the mix and Warrior becomes quite possibly the strongest class as there is no doubt in my mind that it's the class that benefits the most from being supported.
---
Solo PVE ; Warrior is the hardest but it's not that bad unless your gear ALWAYS sucks (which means you're likely doing something wrong to begin with)
---
Solo PVE/PVP ; Expect to go through some shitty and frustrating moments.
---
Warrior + Healer = Everything changes for the best
---
Having a healer on you changes everything and this is also why I have more good memories than bad ones when it comes to leveling. So many times did I demolish people when they were trying to target me first yet the only thing they were really doing was giving me Enrage and more rage. Then I would pop Deathwish and the party would start for real. 
---
Well I did put a healthy dose of int into my gear while levelling my pally. I figured from the wow forums, class distribution and shitty ret performance that nearly everyone able to heal would probably be expected to. Entered MC for our first run with max int chain/plate. Got helm of the lifegiver for minimum DKP while the other pallies were still in shock about being expected to buff heal and dispell. 
---
If you have 8/8 dungeon set you are ready to raid, you aren’t pre raid BIS but you are acceptably ready for raiding.
---
When I started at like 15ish years old I just knew that spell power made my frostbolt number get bigger, I didn't care for hit chance or crit much I just wanted the biggest number. I would trade 20 int/stam for 3 spell power. Ironically that ended up making me hit pretty hard in my noobie guild, but by the time I joined naxx was about to be rolled out so spell power was an established stat.
---
Awww....
---
oh.
---
Too hard to solo at the level given, but droprate is abysmal and would take like 5 hours for a full party to get. You move really slowly cuz you're under water, and you can't eat or drink to regen between pulls...cuz you're underwater. And good luck with breathing unless you're sham, warlock, or undead. 
---
Hard pass on that one.
---
It’s not just ezmode like hunter and lock and it’s tough to solo two mobs at lower level without WW or Sweeping Strikes. But it def gets a lot better after that.
---
Actually I’m curious, there are some quests that are pretty rough solo as warrior, not necessarily elite quests either, just some places where you’re faced with groups of like 3 mobs, how did you handle those esp at lower levels?
---
Since wall climbing was confirmed to be not be in Classic I think, this won't be possible.
---
I wonder if the warrior in the group of the hunter has the green crappy Sunscale Helm ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=14849](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14849)) or the chadhelm of warriors never to be replaced ever in PvE and still very good for PvP Lionheart Helm ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=12640](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12640)).
---
guess my memory is off.
---
hopefully I get to experience it soon!
---
I have never played on a private server, but from videos I've seen and posts I've read, it seems that typically they do the entire event in 2-3 days, again, this is just what I hear.  
---
So I'm assuming most people leveling will be saving and stockpiling the known mats for turn in, as there is potential for profit and or rep.
---
Personally, I'd love for the quantity to be increased, or for the materials to be handed in be randomized.  But I doubt it will be different.  
---
Didn't cover your name up, I am stealing it on every single server. huehueeueuehuehuehehe +1 tho nice picture. I love the 6 slot bag struggle that was the 10-20's.

Aaah, rocking the BoE Krol Blade and Berserker Helm from scarlet monastery? :D
---
World of Warcraft peaked because of the success of vanilla. If BC or WOTLK came out first, it would have undoubtedly been less successful. 
---
There's a reason the most popular servers are vanilla servers - it's simply the best version of the game. No flying, no arena, the two best continents, faction differences, etc.
---
It's pronounced DM. Always fucking has been, always fucking will be. 
---
Bloody fucking hell!
---
Oooooooooooooooooooooh Orcs have laaaayers.
---
The only reps you cannot get to exalted are blood sail bucs stops 11999/12000 honored, deso centaurs which do the same as bucs, and syndicate, which I believe killing ravenholdt bois stops giving rep at neutral or some bs. I feel like there's something I'm missing, but I'be got the insane title so I trust myself.
---
You need 6-8 hours of sleep per night as an adult. 7 hours is perfect amount for most.
---
Exactly. So BiS lists need to be taken with a grain of salt, and while those pieces are usually worth collecting, depending on your overall gear they aren't always worth equipping.
---
Cai was decent so my money is on Lionheart but this pic was taken spring 2005 so it may have been too early for even decent players to have crafted LH.
---
Yeah, they even patched that specific pathway pretty quickly after this pic was taken Spring 2005).
---
Raiders have had 15 years to work on improving. Concepts like best in slot, pre-raid best in slot, full consumables, fully enchanted etc. are ubiquitous on private servers because they're ubiquitous on retail.
---
If you've raided at heroic or higher difficulty you're basically fully familiar with the demands asked of modern raiders. The big differnce is the time investment.
---
Many times I found myself below 100 health.
---
When you're dead you can't heal.
---
That additional +13 heal works out to an additional downranked heal once every 300 casts.
---
The additional stam and int outweighs the +heal.
---
Mine was my UD character in the coffins/graves in the starting zone lol. 
---
Yeah, it's in [every single person](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayifz3/how_many_would_be_interested_in_a_casual_memespec/) who says "I want to raid as a shadow priest/enhancement shaman/oomkin etc." and then fuck off when you explain to them that they should want to raid as a priest/shaman/druid first and then see what we can do about spec once we are actually there. I'm not against that thread (or the idea of them making their own guild) in principle but the amount of ["casuals good, anyone who doesn't accept 3 ret pallies bad"](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayifz3/how_many_would_be_interested_in_a_casual_memespec/ei12y6b/) comments is all over the place. 
---
Anyone who talks about "me (as a person), me (as a spec), me (as what I expect you to want from me)" instead of "here's how I can help you (as a raid leader), you (as a group), you (as a guild)" has the wrong attitude in place. Every single

Mana Shield is a top tier spell for mages, you will gladly trade mana for hp vs rogues/hunters/pally.
---
Dampen Magic works well vs the casters who can't dispel. So other mages, boomkin, locks without felpupper, possibly pally judgements.
---
The real shining start is that damp or amp rank 1 can be used to pad a more important stat against dispels.
---
In 1v1 situations vs priests/shamans you would try to get a poly early on in the fight, buff up ice barrier, then pad it with rank 1: mana shield - arcane armor - fire ward - slow fall - dampen - arcane int. The odds of them having to spend 2 globals to get ice barrier is decent. Maybe someone else can chime in because I honestly don't remember exactly how offensive/defensive dispels worked but I think it was fully random.
---
You can also do offensive padding with 3/5 or 4/5 winter's chill. 
---
Username checks out
---
No thanks, they'd have to pay me to play nu-WoW.
---
I'm trying to remember any particularly difficult parts of leveling.
---
I do remember the Murlocs in Elwynn giving me some trouble. But if you're patient, and avoid walking right into the middle of their villages, you can just peel them away with ranged weapons or taunt from the outskirts.
---
Underwater quests, like Deep Ocean Vast Sea in Darkshore, could be really dangerous since you can pull a bunch of murlocs you can't even see from inside the shipwreck. But I think that quest was rough for everybody.
---
I don't remember having a lot of trouble with Defias Pillagers in Westfall. I think I may have done both Darkshore and Loch Modan before Westfall, so I had outleveled them a fair bit.
---
I remember being very frustrated by the mechanical chicken escort quests, especially the one in Feralas. So many yetis and the chicken just wouldn't slow down. 
---
There were definitely some quests that were harder than others, but I never had a moment where I regretted choosing warrior or felt weaker compared to other classes. Maybe if I had paid closer attention to other players solo questing around me, I'd see some classes with less downtime or the ability to take on 3 mobs at once. But I didn't, so I never felt outclassed by anyone else. Except Paladins and Warlocks who got free mounts, lol.
---
Yep, but in a different game.

Sorry, I'm in Alliance. We don't use catapults here.

I remember around TBC when my friend did show software  called "WoW Screenshot Manager" Oh boy it was great to browse all those screenshots without need to find them first from WoW folder.
---
He loved it though, thought he was clearing the same raids I was (I was doing H25 and he did LFR though :P)
---
Thanks, some great arguments there:-)
---
That's my afk spot
---
Ok I am not saying that druids are better all-round tanks than warriors, although they have some advantages when it comes to threat. I am saying that the step down to paladin is laughable, and putting druids in a different tier than warriors gives the impression that the step warrior -&gt; druid and druid -&gt; paladin is about the same when it comes to tanking, which simply isn't the case. 
---
Jordan peterson isn't "alt-right" though, he is a liberal. (not to be mistaken with the left which is mostly the opposite of a liberal ideology) 
---
I cam here looking for references to that "meme". I'm glad I was not dissa- COME HERE YOU $$%&amp;ing \*&amp;\*\^. Watch the tail!
---
Regarding shamans, when they tank low level dungeons for you, you are not going to say they can't tank, right? No other class can do this.
---
You clearly don’t understand the psychology behind the success of wow. It wasn’t appealing to the casual player whatsoever, it was its ability to put a hardcore player in a position for casual players to envy them. Remember going through main city’s and expecting people and thinking to yourself “man, he looks so fucking cool I want to be able to swing dick like that”. That’s an extremely large part of classic wows success, the feeling of progression and status, the feeling of respect you’d get just standing at the bank and knowing you were an individual because you put that work in.  It’s an ever growing and satisfying feeling of actual progression, one which mirrors real life. But you go ahead and stick to your bias man, keep spreading  that negativity, clearly you’re an expert
---
Hahaha
---
After reading all of that and then seeing this comment was just pure gold. 
---
Personally, I am not that interested in AQ because I will most likely not be able to raid that instance.
---
You should make a paladin guide.
---
Roleplaying as a cannonball, good times my friend..
---
That logic is somewhat circular, but works in my favor. If you find yourself below 100, the people you heal can find themselves below 13 x number of heals x the number of priests with the 28 healing wand over the 10 stam wand. Unless you are overhealing people, 13 more healing is going to be better initially for helping people stay over 100hp. Every single heal is adding more and more hp that can tip the balance of someone's death. I can't think of a mechanic off the top of my head where a priest needs to be topped to off at 100% or dies such that having more healing before hand was worse. I think once you get Epics from MC the choice becomes more trivial, but I personally favor the 28 healing heavily.
---
Thank you ! 
---
Back when selling arena teams was a thing in TBC my 2's partner and I would raise a team over a few hours to sell for huge amounts of gold. People would pay incredible sums to buy a glad title. Even "duelist" titled people would try to interrupt me early, and IIRC they were in the top 2% of PVPers. Granted they probably didn't have much experience at fighting resto shamans, 70% of the top 100 2v2 teams had a druid healer in that era. Also, all the 2100 rated druid/warrior teams were probably actually relatively unskilled. But still.
---
&gt;	And I’m sorry but getting 7 hours of sleep sounds exhausting to you? That’s a bit extreme.
---
Everyone’s different. 7 hours one night, sure. But 7 hours max every night would exhaust me, too. 
---
late to this thread but an important note is you can get exalted with TB or Darnassus with just this repeatable quest where as the other race factions don't have a way to do that until cloth turn ins become available.
---
You too ! 
---
I stay up until half past eleven or midnight, and I'm up and running at 5.50, been going like this for the past 7 years (I'm 42).
---
The game is not that way anymore. In TBC people were still clickers and didn't understand kill potential, and you could get to 2100 just by interrupting and target macros. 
---
1.11 AV could last hooooursssss.
---
The ignore-each-other-and-run-past meta started only when reinforcements came about. Because of reinforcements, having a frontline that's constantly fighting is a coin flip, so people didn't do that. Because there wasn't a frontline to break, tree dude and ice dude were irrelevant. Because you are no longer defending, you do not get armor scraps and don't really return to base in order to turn them in, so that also became irrelevant.
---
It all began and ended with armor scraps. Like another guy said, 1.11 AV actually survived pretty much the same for the entirety of TBC except in that the npcs scaled rather badly. Other than that? Same shit. Armor scraps were turned in. Frontlines existed. Sky dudes were rescued, guarded, and sent out. Ice dude and tree dude were summoned.
---
I believe most games the Horde and Alliance TRIED to ignore each other, but all it takes is a group of people from the other side sneaking a graveyard, and suddenly the whole team respawns at base, and that's when the old meta of AV takes over again because there is no way to get past the opposing faction.
---
The resulting deadlock can last 30 minutes, an hour, or the better part of a day.
---
AQ20 can be pugged. And during the event, good gear can drop from Silithus mobs iirc.
---
A little slow, esp around the 40-46 mark as you transition out of WWA. Has aggravating levels where you're reliant on upgrades.
---
IMO you are the type of person who falls apart from the flock. You don't seem to mind a very long leveling journey at all.
---
Many or most people are very competitive, and their prime concern is not completionism, or achieving things for their own sake, but for what the endresult means in a social context. They see a sub-par grindfest and a barrier of entry in warriors, in some cases as a competitive advantage, while you seem to see the drawn-out experience as a journey and a feature.
---
In other words, you probably just love playing a warrior!
---
How does a private server with 8k pop handle 1000s of players in Silithus during the event?
---
If I'm dead, I don't heal.
---
If a DPS is dead, they don't DPS.
---
One matters far more than the other.
---
Couple that with how often you overheal due to crit heals, heals that coincide with someone else's heal (even with coordination addons, happens all the time), etc, the value of that +heal diminishes.
---
Fresh servers, and eventually TBC. New content would be freakish and probably fail, it would take exceptional circumstances to succeed at least, and while I would love to see that, it is probably unrealistic.
---
That will be my goal number one when Classic launches.
---
Warlock Tanks can get much higher stats than a Voidwalker and can in fact tank a few raid bosses. The furthest raid I have ever gone is AQ.
---
4:3 lyfe

I keep going back and forth on whether or not a guild will stockpile enough mats to open right away. When you actually look at the numbers required it's insane. Just looking at copper bars for one faction. 90,000 would require 21 characters with every bank slot and all 16 slot bags to hold. Guilds would need to be paying for extra accounts to have bank alts. Let's assume phase 5 comes out after 18 months. That's 4 people collecting two stacks each. every day. For 18 months. And that's just one item for one faction. You also need 400,000 runecloth both sides and a whole mess of other stuff. Realistically, you'd need multiple guilds from both factions working together from the start to make that happen. Not impossible, but it for sure won't be every server, if any. 
---
I think what's more likely to happen, is guilds stockpile what they can, and then sit on it. The longer the effort takes, the more people in those hard core guilds can get the mount, since the scepter quest is limited to one person per reset (if we get the original broodlord and draconic pages). Then if they are going for a world first and they see another server getting close, or they have the number of mounts they want, they finish it so they can open the instance first. 
---
As for auto-complete, I think even in vanilla blizzard implemented that for low population severs to finish the war effort automatically. I'd guess they'd do the same if it was needed. 
---

Is this from a ps?

It is a copypasta

That is too cute. 
---
I played on Frostmane. I don't really have much idea of what most of the server thought, I just know my coworkers, friends, and I all thought the hours-to-days long AVs were the bee's knees.
---
Yes. You can NOT kill Drek/Van if pretty much any tower is still alive. Maybe if you've got a really good tank, he could tank the extra general in the side with some massive heals.
---
I just remember the extra generals--what were they called again?--were nightmare on steroids. Talking 1.12 AV here of course. IIRC (the Horde ones anyway) would bladestorm and wipe every player within 5 feet of them. You'd need really well geared healers and tanks in order to tank both Drek'thar and one of the tower generals. I have never seen that happen.

SPREAD OUT DOT HER TO DEATH! word during Phase 2 Ony... remember our first Onyxia kill, I was playing my Dwarf Huntard back then, did a /point after the kill because we were filming and going to SW to turn in the head, after the kill vid came out every ally player that was into raiding used to /point my huntard. That was amazing! CLASSICHYPE
---
If you had 8/8 dungeon set and rest blue items, you were actually set to start raiding. MC can be done with half the raid in some greens.
---
Druid bar - allows you to see your mana whilst in forms. Shape shifting costs a good chunk of mana so without proper management it’s easy to get stuck in caster form mid-fight
---
I'm only basing it on what I've seen on the more popular pservers. The "dead" realms all had less than 3k players on at a time, while the more popular realms had 5-10k on. I think I can count on one hand how many were going at any given time, though.
---
So going by that, to assume that each region will have more than one server with ~5k on at a time seems like a stretch.
---
But I have hopes that Classic will surprise me and more games will take design elements away from it.
---
I think that core motivation of majority of gamers of successfull wow (classic, bk, wotlk) was based on reward value. It is a simple motivation formula, that a human or animal can perform different behaviour only focused on reward. And the more enjoyable a reward then a more hard or unpleasant can be behaviour.
---
So from my point of view, blizzard ruined a reward value. They did a big inflation of reward when started to add new shinny epics from everythere, new titles and mounts. Later they killed it with solo-doable content for all those rewards and added a donation rewards with a great look. In overall, they droped a reward value and people started to lose motivation to play. 
---
Because a gameplay is not what people want, they think they want it, but it works only for short period of time. And long term motivation built only on reward. And if we compare classic, bk, wotlk with all other addons we will see that an Epic from old times was 5-10 times more rare than now. And we were happy to obtain it. We were so happy that we were agree to gameplay, to ruined specs and some class balance, to unvaluable enemies who no one knew or a need to farm a daily quests or other things. 
---
It is all about reward and how rare it is. Now people have so many shinny things that even a newb who donated 50$ can have a great look on a shinny mount and in shinny armor. That killed a game.
---
And classic can restore it and bring back the value of our rewards.
---
I told my partner that the first couple of weeks**(If classic drops during my weeks off work, mid august-late august)** I wont be available to do things, I will probably sit by the computer the first week more than my fulltime job, and the 2nd-3rd week farming pre raid bis..  
---
Gotta love that she's starting her own business this summer aswell so she wont be home that much anyway LOL &lt;3
---
One reason I’ll never use Xpearl: pink shamans DansGame
---
This is projection 100%, you want them closed after 1 month so you can go back to 2005 and get one, then have them removed so you can be one of the unique snowflake accounts. The idea that people know better now and these mounts won't be as rare bothers you. They are going to be more common for that reason alone. Even if you put an incredibly short window like 1 month. As a side note to prove some of your projection, and #changes. The game released in November 2004, the armor patch was 1.4 April 2005. If that doesn't prove you're just trying to protect your own special snowflake status I don't know what will. 
---
More people know about them, more people will have these mounts so much that it might lose the prestige, get over it. Devilsaurs will be mafiad within 1 month, BiS lists will be talked about by the time you reach level 10 everyone will know about it or know someone who does. The trends of which dungeons are run the most will change. People will be reserving Arugals robe on level. They will not be 2005 wow players, just accept that.
---
lol  
---
This is the definition of playing smart right here
---
There's plenty of valid reasons to point out why SW would be empty - saying that the Horde population can go there is not.
---
Why can't we queue to bg from wherever?
---
This way you don't have the pain to go Ashenvale for Alliance, you don't roam low level zone with the bords of 60s making the zone unplayed for the intended lvl BUT you keep people out there and keep the world alive.
---
I only bg pvp at lvl 60 which means that after hitting 60 I never really saw Azeroth. I was in Orgimmar all day long jumping around. 
---
Priest
---
Been playing paladin healer for the last 12 years, but thinking about rolling priest this time around.  My main worry is: will I miss playing paladin?
---
it took 5 months in vanilla, can we get pandas to go with those changes? Or is the unarmored mounts a status symbol that needs to have the difficulty #changed like the easy raids? Seems awfully hypocritical to me that people want to make these mounts so exclusive when they know damn well they didn't have one at 60 and just want to zerg to 1k gold before a lockout.
---
You either did not play 1.12 AV or are being intentionally misleading.
---
Taking out the graveyard the opposing faction is relying on will most of the time cause half their raid to respawn in the starting location. The other half of the raid will die quickly after that.
---
Traditional AV begins after that. Never have I seen a graveyard recapped and the game resolved within less than 50 minutes. It would even last hours, and yes, the bosses would get summoned, wing commanders equipped, etc. It just wouldn't last *days*.
---
If anybody's curious, the reason why it's unlikely to get back to the top of the threat list is because ranged need to exceed 130% of the main target's current threat. So when the Voidwalker loses threat it's 30% lower than the highest target and doesn't have a taunt.
---
ahahahahah

they were in for 5 months dude. google patch 1.4, game was nov 2004, mount patch was april 2005. Seeing as how the crux of your argument was on him wanting to change the window of time we can expect you to support the 4 or 5 month window that is #nochanges? We all know 4 months means they will not have the status they had in vanilla, let's just be honest about that. People will want to jump on the unarmored bandwagon. People will also be able to buy and sell these mounts for thousands of gold if it is gated( i think they were tradeable like others?).
---
You are required to cap all bunkers/towers and kill galvangar/balinda... so much as one recapped tower and the game duplicates in length. A recapped graveyard and the game turns into 2 hours, add 2 hours every time a faction loses their progress due to a recapped gy.
---
People make it out like Warrior leveling is as difficult as child birth but it's not. They're about equal to Rogues, depending on gear they can beat Rogue leveling speed even.
---
You couldnt be more wrong. The Teal Kodo stands out immediately, and is the ONLY attractive color kodo, period.
---
Manashield: if you die before you were oom. You did something wrong.

I'd do this on my Warlock post tBC and it still tricked people haha.
---
Unironically back in vanilla/tbc when i was a little kid my dad taught me how to farm herbs and fish for him while he was at work, he let me stay home from school a few times because of the amount of gold i was making him.
---
Basically i was his little goldmaking minion and he paid me in "sick" days.
---
it was more like 4 or 4.5 months.
---
I think what you're defining as a QoL change aren't QoL at all, they're just updates to the game that made it worse over time. Flying at 70 wasn't QoL *at all*, it was *slow as hell* until you grinded enough gold for the epic version. But at the same time it meant you didn't need to travel via land eventually which lead to less world PVP etc. 
---
When we say "no changes" we mean "don't add or remove anything to *this version* of the game, within reason". That would be exactly the same for TBC, WotLK etc. 
---
Played NE Warrior. One of my Friends played NE Rogue and we started together.
---
In Looty Bay he leveled faster than me and we couldn't level together anymore, since then i realised how bad warrior was for grinding levels. Wanted to play Horde Shaman, but my friends decided to play alliance and we needed a tank back than.
---
Now it's kinda the same, we will play horde, but we need a tank. I will play Druide Bearform. And when I raid (raided all content in Vanilla, hence i am not sooo hyped to raid) i will play DPS/Healer, whatever i can go with.
---
yes
---
I use strafes on WASD and then hold RMB to turn while strafing. Always worked for me!
---
For me it has to be the portals.
---
I was too stupid to realize what flying mounts had done to wpvp. I thought easier heroics were just the result of me being better.
---
But even I thought that was bullshit when cataclysm came and we had a bunch of portals to all new zones in SW.
---
Just because people who were #nochanges disagreed with you doesn't mean everyone supports 1.12. That's a minority, and there's a big difference between a 1.12 client and the 1.12 patch. Do you have a link to your post?
---
What version brought cross realm?
---
I think it was at that point that people felt anonymous in bg's amd just acted like dicks
---
Well I leveled a Warrior and then a Rogue in vanilla and the Rogue was undoubtedly much easier and what I find interesting is most of these guides suggest that Rogue isn't even that good of a leveling class either, just a lot better than Warrior. Warrior was pretty tough though if only because you couldn't pull more than 1-2 mobs at a time. 
---
I'm so happy to not have any children, the time, the poo, the responsibility, how on earth could you dream for that, guess some people really are different.
---
That's a huge chunk of your life gone, classic wow will be my child.
---
^This. Defense gear is for a select few fights like Broodlord, Chromaggus and Nefarian.
---
The rest you should wear a mix of Max tank-point items. Basically Stamina, Armor and lots and lots and lots of threat stats.
---
My immediate experience was the exact opposite, I couldn't believe how much easier a rogue felt to level. Stealth is a HUGE advantage btw, you can easily bypass mobs that you don't need to kill and with cc it means you could pull 2-3 mobs at a time fairly safely from my memory. 
---
The difficulty and speed is objective. I didn't level a warrior (rogue) but I came over from maplestory and the leveling in wow felt super fast to me. Someone who was smart enough to go for green quest or was lucky with drops probably didn't find it as challenging either.
---
And you show that you have dedication. The dungeon set 2 was pretty iffy to get. Also you look cool
---
Wow.
---
Nah, I don't think my old 512 RAM computer can even run the Blizzard launcher.
---
This was a player made rarity not just a design choice by the devs, trying to engineer the game in a way that forces the same outcome but does so by taking away player choice just doesn't seem right. "Representation" is a bad buzzword, the mounts were so ugly the vast majority traded up, causing the rarity to turn them into a collectors item, we did that, not blizzard. We choae to view the rarity of that mount as a status symbol because it become a aort of grandfathered achievement, nobody else could have. If you want to take it away from people and make changes to the game because you don't want that cheapened just say so. Stop trying to justify it with a lame excuse like "having a white raptor doesn't represent this fantasy game well".
---
I used to have a large album of *stupid* pictures I'd be embarrassed to show now. I loved doing all sorts of silly things with my hunter. I'd feign death anywhere and everywhere I could, just so I could catch it when things would get confused and have me 'dead' on an invisible edge in midair, or *sideways*.
---
Makes me wish I hadn't deleted it, silly as I was as a noob it'd still make me smile.
---
I rolled warrior on a brand new server and was among the first to 60. Hadn't played any other class past 30 at that point. I didn't notice any issues and it certainly didn't feel hard. I do think it's massively exaggerated and it being a meme spreads easily. I mean obviously it's the slowest/worst but there's probably only 10-15% in it.
---
Wow never seen before! Rolling horde this time so for Thrall'!
---
We are back in that circle, I might start aaking you to put your money where your mouth is and name a boss where this matters. In the mean time, learn to downrank if you are overhealing enough to change stat weights. And topping people off doesn't mean the majority of the time most people aren't fluctuating somewhere under 100% depending on the fight.
---
Frankly, I’d love to just stay where it is and see how the meta develops around it. More raids would be nice but seems unlikely 
---
The shadowing tree canopy really makes the environment, really amplifies the immersion. I'm prolly biased, my first characters were undead and night elf so dark/shadowy zones really get me in the feels.

There should be multiple. I talked about it extensively all over the Internet for like 3 months until I got sick of people telling me to go play retail and just gave up.

You don't need wall waking for troll village (spot in winterspring where you can easily walk up a hill), hyjal (walk around the pillar and jump up the edge between pillar and wall) and og roof (west of og you can get up with some good placed jumps, not wall jumping). The same applies to old if, airport, Bengal cave, under dire maul, under stormwind, caverns of time, under stratholme, east of the wastelands, dead mines secret, west of gnomeregan, every area "only visible during flight path", out of razorfen, out of zg, out of zf, out of every battleground, and the list goes on... Wall walking / jumping was nice, but patching it wasn't the end to explorint

I love night elves starting zone too, the music and the environment is so beautiful it catches me everytime

You mean a separate spec for instanced pvp?

If that's what you mean, I'm not a fan of that tbh.

It would make it feel artificial to me. I get that rankers need to pve too, since raid gear is too good for pvp to pass, but I still don't like it. If I find a r14 dude in EPL after a BG, I want him to wreck the shit out of me, just like he did inside the last BG.
---
Either way at this point I'll take literally whatever blizzard throws at me.
---
Look, the mounts were simply placeholders for the real epic mounts. The only reason they were in the game was because the real models weren’t ready yet. Only the Undead epic mounts were ready at launch. Suddenly having all these extra mount models won’t feel vanilla.
---
Slow and hard are not the same thing. Leveling any class in vanilla was hard as you made it, you could out level zones, do green quests, and it was easy. However for speed and efficiency Warrior is at the bottom. If you never leveled another class in vanilla you may not have a comparison.
---
Holy shit, what a genius 
---
I'd say rogue is harder from 1-30 but then become easier.
---
I've been playing on a not so public server to figure out while I'll play in classic and the amount of dps warriors that won't tank is ridiculous. 
---
I can't find any screenshots from my vanilla days ;__; Either I didn't know how to do it or they're still in my oldest computer, somewhere. I'm really tempted to boot it up just to see.
---
Back in vanilla the protection warriors in our guild knew perfectly well that stacking defence to reduce crits and crushing blows, and improving mitigation generally, was far more important than extra stam. All more stam have you was a larger buffer to allow for healer errors / lag spikes.
---
But .. you’re wrong. A purge is infinitely better (bye bye pals buff, sac, freedom), your supsceptible to interrupts (only holy spells) with emergency defensives (meaning you’re already losing), WF is an amazing buff and tits in PvP with other totems (and sure they have 1 hp but how often do you see people going around killing them *distractions*). Pure healing output, sure I’ll give it to paladins. Rounded up shamans are better, maybe not infinitely .. but they’re better. This isn’t even mentioning dps output, ghost wolf etc. 
---
&gt; while the other pallies were still in shock about being expected to buff heal and dispell.
---
To go off of this, many of WoW's hardest leveling aspects are pushing the limits. Pulling multiples, farming while low, pulling large packs without CC's or adequate consumables.
---
For warriors, this is exacerbated. At the same time, warriors absolutely shred lower level mobs, so if you can consistently fight only your level and 1-2 lower, you'll reduce glancing blows and misses, and have much higher up/hr compared to leveling other classes where fighting =&lt; level 
---
Tell my kids that, I went 14 years with under 5hrs sleep a night.
---
Always. It's good to keep a 2h for dps / cleave / overpower when applicable, and a shield for those times you need to soak damage. This is true for pve and pvp alike. Fighting a rogue and using your shield at the start with shield block for.when they use their burst is very good, then swap 2h.
---
Also, lingo is sword and board! They even made it a namesake talent in wotlk
---
Sm axe reward is a decent upgrade if you’re alliance, I dunno what horde do.
---
The Office will definitely be rewatched yet again while I level.
---
TC requires Battle Stance, which loses you Defiance and Def stance threat modifier, it does roughly 150 damage to 4 targets which comes out to roughly 130~ threat with the 0.8x threat mod of battle stance, it needs you to nuke your rage pool by switching stance, spend the GCD and 20 rage for TC, and swap back once again nuking your rage pool, all for about 130 threat to each mob.
---
Meanwhile BS can be used in def stance, generates 40ish threat with a 1,35x multiplier coming out at roughly 55 threat per target buffed on all mobs in  combat with said players, 5 man group with a warlock pet and a hunter pet in it is 385 threat per battle shout, for a 10 rage cost, no stance dancing, no CD. It's wickedly good and rivals (or in this scenario with pets) edges out sunder armor for threat gain, granted everyone in the party is in combat and within 20 yards.
---
Thunder Clap is a great tool for a dungeon and more specifically a raid, but it should be DPS warriors using it, not tanks.
---
I prefer supplemental raids like ZG and even AQ 20 to some extent. If they made Kharazan something between aq40 and naxx, or hyjal a very hard but pug'able 10 man, that would be awesome. Pieces that compliment niche specs and also offer 1-2 pieces of high end, near bis for cookie cutters, that'd be great.
---
We need a video for this? 😂 
---
I doubt that's really a benefit that people value.  And Druids aren't true hybrids in this game because they can only seriously do one role each fight, but I do understand what you're saying in general.  That's something I'm really going to be on the lookout for raids doing or not.
---
For example, at Vaelastrasz and Ebonroc, of course I'd expect a Feral Druid to be doing Cat Form DPS.  At Chromaggus, I would instead expect them to heal just because of how important removing debuffs is.  I don't know if people will care to put this kind of thought into things, but I hope so.
---
Unless the pirate quest disappears after hitting revered it is possible to get exalted with bloodsail. You Jill Jazzrik in Badlands unroll Mac revered then you turn in the quest 
---
For fucks sake man, spend some gold on bags....
---
Start in bstance. Charge if you can, TC demo. Dstance rage yell and do what you said
---
Them being placeholders is the definition of not relevant. It was in the game for 4 or 5 months. What do we do about the exclusive items like the abomination boss that drops very good low level caster pants in SFK. Personally I agree with shortening the window for the unarmored mounts to protect their status, I am just annoyed that so many #nochanges are actually #Iwantthingstobeliketheyusedtobe which ian't going to happen no matter how much they micromanage. Hell they won't even buy the same greens as before knowing wirlwind is 3 levels away, and that's the small stuff. The number of people running engineering is going to go up at least 5 fold(probably %1500), quote this post. Engi was relatively rare in vanilla and I played on StormReaver, considered one of the most active pvp servers in the world. I think I saw less than 10 or 20 grenades being thrown during my entire gaming experience and I was on the edge of rank 10 or 11. I think I got mind control capped or goblin helmed so few times I didn't even know those items existed until a Vurtne video. I have seen more grenades in a single stream of a lvl 30 than my entire classic play time. Did swifty use any or get hit by any in his IWT video??
---
Grenades are going to be so common you can't have a friendly duel without them.
---
Disadvantages: All of them
---
Advantages: ???
---
It's built on the latest client.
---
We’re all different, some want children, some don’t. I agree the sub can be a bit harsh at times, however, when you have **absolutely** no desire to have children, a lot of the content there makes sense. It’s probably as hard for you to comprehend, as it is to me that people want children.
---
Or a shield. 
---
Well, I really, really wanted that Netherwhelp pet back then, considering how well it fit Blood Elves in my opinion, so it's more than a twinge for me, lol, but I still enjoyed TBC a lot, so it's all good in the end.
---
One of our resto druids did exactly this. He never ever ran OOM and was always the “quick switch” healer to our tanks if something went catastrophically wrong and we needed to wand/triage. 
---
Which means you're not LoS pulling, probably have mobs in an unfavorable position and still generated less threat than you'd do with just using BS, especially at pull where just a heal or two will have you lose aggro it's not worthwhile.
---
This looks like a gold sink possibility - 10 gold for 30 seconds of scratching. Good way to balance the economy! 
---
Eh, I entered MC and a freshly dinged 60 lock in int/spirit greens. :D

If you're rushing 60, you're not going to go in any instance so why do you want to spec prot ?
---
The instant gratification players will keep playing retail and it appears there‘s more of them and this game type is more popular nowadays. 
---
Classic will win. Win for all of us and many others. It will not overcome retail but I think it will be proudly co-existing. 
---
My guild opened the gates on Un'goro back then. Basically we could have opened it two weeks earlier than we did. We waited for another alliance guild who were also in the progress but not as fast as we were. We also waited for the weekend so that everyone could have his piece of fun with the opening event. Communication was the key word. Materials shouldn't be a problem. But I'm not sure if I'm willing to farm hours and hours for somebody else to get his mount again. Guess I wont be in one of the leading guilds this time.
---
They aren't. Shaman/paladin is at the top. 
---
If you aren't combining those two you need to divide the rest of them in two as well.  
---
Haha, I get that. Fortunetly my son was an amazing sleeper already as a baby, never had problems with sleep.

Bwl is probably where it started.

Hard? No. Time consuming? For sure. I leveled 1-60 as prot because to me it made most sense that a warrior used a shield. Meant it was very easy for me to get into dungeon groups though :)
---
I believe this to be a doctored screenshot : insane warrior damage and everybody is full health / mana in UBRS ?   
---
Didn't you see the Leroy video ? This is how we were rollin back then !
---
The only thing that would make me think it's legit, is that you're tanking in battle stance, like every true vanilla warrior should !
---
Actually, only when Classic was announced. And people started talking about BiSlists and how shitty Dungeon Sets where. I never played on a private server prior to the announcement of classic. And back in the Vanilla days this was not a thing for the vast majority of the players. You went to collect your Dungeon set, then you went into MC for T1. And then you went into BWL for T2 and so forth.
---
Fight the green level mobs and its easy enough
---
Just think, Grom wouldn't be dead if Thrall never asked him to chop magic trees!
---
Down with Thrall!
---
FWIW the only French private server I know off has about 400 lvl 60 connected since last month.
---
The only hype for classic I see is on English speaking medias, nothing in French.
---
I got friendly reputation with them and then I thought, fuck my ocd, not worth it. 
---
big agree
---
I just need one pve server with a solid population to raid and pvp with. 
---
That is pure win for me. 
---
Why can we just queue into dungeons from where ever? And raids? In fact why even have azeroth?
---
Hahah wtf!
---
That is the point. Just because those were in 1.12 does not automatically mean they should be in classic as well. maybe, maybe not.
---
Good need to make some Screenshots, so I know how they all have to look in classic. 
---
I'm not sure which hairstyle my undead had. 
---
Fuuuuuck no 
---
1. Get threat
---
2. Get healed
---
3. Profit!
---
Yeah at this point it seems that a 31 resto/rest in balance seems to be the way to go. Or maybe sacrifise switftmend for moonglow and nature's grace. 
---
Maximize burst healing and toss hots/dots when able. There is really no point in going feral.
---
He was truly ahead of his time.
---
Still concerned about my finale class choice right now.
---
I go back and forth. 
---
Not hit at first but ap/crit% vs. Agi. Just comparing numbers by equipping different pieces. How much ap per Agi and so on. 
---
Nah, mail them to your bank alt.
---
Not a chance in hell I’d be doing BGs if I have to run to the entrance
---
Or maybe he is not the tank?
---
If you don’t even know what it had why would you need it to be the same
---
panda stereotyping was pretty unoriginal.
---
Putting druids and warriors into the same Tier is laughable and makes it seem like they are equally good, which simply isn't the case.
---
this
---
Do you have also somekind of leveling talents?
---
Also, could you share your PVE and PVP builds, please?
---
Which professions are you starting with?
---
That is true. But it is still not optimal.
---
I'm gonna go for something not often mentioned and say the overabundance of catch up mechanics.
---
If you look at a fully progressed vanilla or TBC server you'll noticed that all raid content is still ran by guilds in various levels of progression, even when sunwell is out, some guilds are still in SSC etc..
---
Until you get to wotlk, when in any fully progressed server, the only raid that anyone runs is ICC because of those 3 dungeons that rain down free Ulduar quality gear for no effort.
---
In every expansion since then, every time a new raid comes out, all previous raids are immediately abandoned because catch up gear rains from the sky invalidating all previous content.
---
It basically makes the game so the only useful raid is the most recent one.
---
I'm debating on making my 10 year old farm herbs for me as a punishment lol
---
I'm beginning to wonder if YOU know what g-sync even does :p The important thing here is the refresh rate right? You don't need it to run WoW Classic at a high refresh rate without tearing. Posts clearly states OP doesn't intend to even play other games. It's just a fucking waste of power lol.
---
The ZG shoulders were almost as good as the T1 but I can't remember if they were an updated item or if they were added later.
---
There were also some budget options with more +hit than T1/ZG if you really needed it and didn't mind missing out on agi/stam like Truestrike shoulders and even the green quest reward Wyrmhide Spaulders. Both had +2% hit and truestrike also had some +ap on it but they lacked other stats entirely.
---
Other than that the only ones that come to mind are the pvp shoulders but I can't really remember when those were added.
---
If you're recommending a tn panel for the lower input delay, remember that we're talking about a game here that is going to be sporting at least 20ms of delay to begin with. The extra 2-3ms delay from an IPS would be completely lost in translation.
---
I play it on my old computer, which is below the minimum specs, but it works fine and fast enough, the only thing is that the NPC textures are very ugly
---
Are you under the assumption that Gsync monitors cost a lot?
---
Played first as a hunter in which case I think I went for mostly my dungeon set and I definitely did tier 1 gear which I guess worked out since it was acceptable/good for hunters "theory-wise".  Second character was a priest and I prioritized mp5 pretty hard and definitely also +healing although probably not as much as is "optimal".  For PvP I had a gear set that was basically as much armor and stamina/hp as I could find since survivability was #1.  My 3rd character near end of vanilla was a warrior (fresh server) and went to be MT.  I knew what the defense cap was and I did blacksmithing to make myself dark iron gear for FR.  Was able to keep aggro and let DPS go all out after a couple of seconds and not die easily so I am guessing I itemized well enough for MC/ony.
---
In later raiding with my priest(up to early naxx)I usually went with tier sets for example my priest I think I went full tier2 although that may not have been optimal (I think I liked one of the set bonuses).
---
There's always going to be a small bit of push back about not being a human, but it still wont sway me from being a gnome.  
---
My racial choice is the only thing I'm not min/maxing, and I'll never choose human no matter how many times I get denied to raids or guilds.  
---
There are pieces of gear out there that can help you bridge the gap between human and other races as well.  
---
Don't be a human if that's not what you want to be. You'll hit 60, raid, go through the content, and then always have the thought in the back of your mind that you wish you could be doing all of this on a dwarf.  
---
Dam I was feeling that music and then it cut off.. anyone know the song?
---
Great video btw :}
---
Last month or so I was leveling with some friends and took a screenshot with all of us in that same catapult, lol. I am always screenshoting everything. 
---
A bit is the biggest understatement of the century lol.
---
Two words describe my feelings : Preservation Project
---
Some people, I include myself, think WoW should be preserved for a historical reasons, changing that will just create a new demand for vanilla.
---
but... no changes :(
---
Looking for Semi-Hardcore or Hardcore guild.  
---
\[NA\] \[Horde\] \[Raiding\] \[Open to all days and all rimes for raid\]  
---
Will be playing an Undead Warlock  
---
Have been playing WoW on and off since BC with semi-hardcore experience  
---
Willing to put in the time and dedication to clear all content and be part of a great raid team
---
Will be leveling fast and would love to play along side people that want to start gearing as fast as possible
---
Quick learner with group mindset
---
Some personal goals for Classic:  
---
1. Achieving Scarab Lord  
---
2. Clearing all raids in a timely progression manner  
---
3. Being part of a great raid team and guild  
---
I do not play BfA anymore and am waiting for classic, I'm trying to find a guild ahead of time to lock in a spot so upon release I can focus on getting to end game.  
---
If you are interested in recruiting me or have any questions feel free to add me on discord Chicken#5694
---
Only on private servers
---
Nah he had them too late. They could’ve been playing with him! Plus you get the house to yourself at 40 once the kids are 18 and you and the wife can finally split
---
I'm not trying to be mean, but uh: &gt; taunt from the outskirts.
---
That was in 3.0 when all taunt abilities gained a 20y range up from melee and had cooldown reduced to 8 seconds from 10.  Perhaps you're mixing up some memories levelling Warrior in Wrath too?  It's also fair if you just made a slip of the tongue kind of mistake here.
---
But otherwise, yeah, it's really not that bad if you're careful.  It's just that so many people were bad back then in a game that you had to be careful in or die that it made Warrior look so much harder because it couldn't do much if the player wasn't careful.
---
I do recall that even in TBC, fighting 3 equal-level enemies at once was almost impossible as a Warrior, that's for sure.
---
Are you expecting the timeline to match up perfectly with vanilla's?
---
It's so marginal that you really shouldn't worry about it. You can clear Naxx as a human or dwarf.
---
If you love dwarves go priest for fear ward! 
---
Working graveyard, I get two/three nights a week of 8-12 hours of gaming, plus on my work days I get 2-3 hours before the wife wakes up and I go to bed
---
Optimal is absolutely not needed. We had half of our players playing PvP spec and the guild still down half of naxx until TBC was released.
---
The thing is, I bet the top guilds knew and did tests to determine the stat values to optimize. They just made sure not to share it anywhere since they wanted to stay on top. Not many people shared anything above the general common knowledge. People also didnt give a fuck, they just wanted to have fun in their 8/8 dungeon sets :D
---
That's not what he said though.
---
He said that it was their intention that all specs would be viable in molten core, and that they thought debuffs like curse of elements would make it so fire mages could still waddle through the fights with fire resistances. 
---
In the same vein he talks about them designing arcane with the intent that their DPS would be on par with fire/frost.
---
It doesn't take a math genius to figure out that arcane DPS isn't happening in vanilla.
---
And people are going frost in MC.
---
The first time I just didnt want to play anymore was the new talent system without a talent tree. It simply just broke it for me.
---
Who hurt you
---
/s? Who has a wife that plays wow?!
---
Remember also to stand behind mobs if the VW has aggro. They can't parry and block from behind ;)
---
Pretty much this, I remember doing every dungeon at least once. Sometimes several runs to get the gear I wanted. I know now that I was in no way an efficient leveler, but I had a blast doing it.
---
I'd love to level another warrior once classic hits, but I've learned that my experience will differ immensely from vanilla and I don't want to step on my fond memories. So I have decided to go a different route this time around.
---
Fury doesn't lock you into using dual wield :p
---
I didn't know shit until I played on a private server.
---
So, when they use the vanillas latest patch for talents, pll are ok. When they do that on AV, suddenly its not vanilla like. And making that choice (of not spending time on something thats already vanilla like AND ready), its the same as max level boost ?
---
Jeesus fucking christ. 
---
It's mostly that they have no heal and a very weak escape in hamstring, so they pretty much need to commit to every fight they start. If you know what you're doing  then they're not even the slowest class.
---
Also in wpvp you have to charge in to win any fight more or less so that puts you in a rough spot.
---
I swear I remember hearing even in TBC Arena locks would use random buffs like waterbreathing for the same reason.
---
I used to think that way. Then I had my first little accident :) I never asked for kids but my god if she isn’t the best thing that ever happened to me. I never thought I would say something like that I used to HATE kids! People could also say the time you spend on classic is a huge chunk of your life gone (not me personally). Plus I had her young and my wife can’t have anymore! So by the time I’m 40 I’ll have my cake and eat it too! (House to myself/full grown child to do my bidding)
---
Human fury warriors will be fighting rogues tooth and nail for swords and maces, leaving lots of daggers, axes, and fist weapons available for the non humans. That's a pretty huge plus.
---
He said that because people found ways to break shit with them, not because the spells themselves were particularly bad :p
---
I think they did a wave of anti-walljumping updates every expansion's introductory x.0 patch as well as during Classic itself, though never able to 100% remove it, I think, unless they put sheer, solid invisible walls everywhere like they started doing in Wrath and especially Cataclysm.
---
So by now, yeah, it'll be practically impossible to do a lot of walljumping, at least compared to Classic's time.
---
/r/childfree =&gt; profit 
---
But it feels good
---
you would say that, then again, you dont know me nor my partner so :)
---
Ofc, thats where i waited for buffs in org always. 
---
I don't remember anyone clicking during TBC, at least in the serious subset of players. Submitting a screenshot of UI was a standard procedure for joining guilds. Skill required to reach duelist/glad was heavily class dependent. In 2v2 I wouldn't be surprised if there was a ton of druids/warriors hitting 2100 with horrible skills but hunter/shaman/warlocks weren't hitting higher ratings easily. I remember when I was sitting 24XX in 2's and \~2350 in 3's and I was in the top 3 or 4 shamans in the entire battlegroup with maybe 50-60 druid+warrior teams in the same range.
---
No Logic indeed. If you were here since the beginning you'd know that these complaints are what got us to the god awful class design we now have in BFA.
---
Just be quiet, reroll a warrior or rogue or suck it up and be a godly buffer/support that can dps in casual content/pvp so classes can stay unique in a RPG.
---
Zoram gank squad
---
You are using a flawed logic; Leveling as a warrior in a vacuum is not hard but since there are other classes in the game you should compare the game play to them.  
---
Compared to other classes leveling a warrior is hard, just look at all the comments here. "Its easy just get loads of bandages/pots", "Its easy you just have to be patient and pull smart". If it was easy you would just attack mobs and use spell X when you pull too many and have no trouble killing mobs a few levels higher than you.   
---
TLDR; When you need to take extra steps in order to level at the same speed of other classes it makes the class harder, your subjective opinion makes no difference. View it as you are choosing a class and have 0 experience of the game.
---
I hope that they’re in. I’ve seen people here talk like it’ll be tough for anyone not playing hardcore to get them, but I just don’t understand that. 
---
I was straight awful when I played during launch. I was a clicking warrior that barely knew how to play. I somehow farmed the gold for one of the non armored mounts (the only kind at the time), but purchased an arcanite reaper instead.
---
If my completely noob warrior self could farm up enough gold to purchase one in time... trust me, you can too.
---
there was an option to show enemy buffs/debuffs.
---
correct me if i'm wrong.
---
In vanilla warlock tank is only ever used on Twin emps and exclusively because one of them does only magic damage.  
---
100% vanilla is a knowledge game there are things some guilds do on private servers that other guilds still don't know about. 
---
I'm still amazed how good looking the zones were, given the limitations of the game requirements. Something about the big, cartoony textures makes it just pop but at the same time, give an impression of a fantasy world. 
---
Id go fury 2h until like 40 when u can respec arms 
---
Season reset. The ability to save my character to a permanent realm.  
---
TBC is not really my thing. The things that made TBC bad (story, flying mounts, outlands world, the elven horde, Shattrath, paladins/shamans available for the other faction) far outweigh the good things (hard heroic dungeons, hybrids being more viable).  
---
hamstring and walk away isn't too hard x)
---
Did you read the OP at all?
---
That came later. In vanilla you needed a mage to cast Detect Magic in order to see an enemies buffs
---
When will the marriage be?
---
t0.5 was implemented after AQ release though.
---
I suppose we'll see if they do the same progressive itemization.
---
okay, my fault, thought it was a thing!
---
It's just a small bonus that gear can compensate. A good dwarf rogue will out DPS a mediocre human rogue.
---
Nostalgeek?
---
Not even there... at least not at the „blizzlike“ ones.
---
I did too until I revisited a private server. You feel almost blind not knowing what buffs an enemy have, its really strange haha
---
it is hard, but not slow, if you're any good at warrior you'll have no trouble, you can solo cyclonian with harvesters (engineering pet), pots and bandages, i'd recommend doing the dungeon quests, any kind of upgrade is really useful, and it means you won't run out of regular quests and have to resort to grinding mobs, crit (agility), stam and weapon damage are your best leveling stats go arms on pvp, fury on pve and always 2h
---
This doesn't matter what so ever. Over time, I'm quite sure vanilla WoW (or if TBC servers are released, them) will have a higher playerbase than retail. Because people tend to be nostalgic and like stuff they are used to.
---
But  who cares? We get classic, so I'm happy. Enough about that.
---
I'll just use it to go in and reactivate my toons. Since the revamp I haven't been able to post on the classic forum because I supposedly don't have any charactets over lvl 10 though the problem is they're over lvl 20. Customer service helpfully told me to reactivate my account.
---
I remember jumping under Orgrimmar from the Hunter area in Valley of Honor.
---
A patch 1.13 to nerf nax gear and later and a vanilla kharazan as planned before
---
Recently to be honest, I checked out the BIS list for rogues and mages and was surprised at how bad tier 0 was, I was grinding those dungeons for shadowcraft for weeks, least i'll know better this time.
---
Man I have the fucking same image. In fact with an orc with ponytail like yours xD
---
Years after people are done with the content yeah I expect changes
---
Warlock or mage for pvp and occasional pve?
---
Thinking everyone needed to do the same e
---
The guild name makes me wanna read berserk. 
---
Was human race a must have for melees?
---
warrior just kills the bypass mobs, that's exp rogue isn't getting while slowing crawling around in stealth
---
Its a waste of time to download
---
I will quit 2 mins after seeing how empty everything is
---
faster but harder than rogue
---
&gt;I think its been crunched and fury is far and away better depending on how crit will work.
---
Naah, but you can be sure that you wont be able to sit for procs in Classic. You wont have world buffs/consumables to give you extra crit. You wont have access to flurry until L35-40. Not a big issue if you plan on going Arms at L40 anyways. 
---
But OP is more focused in tanking and for that arms is far superior. Gotta love that anger management. Most of their levelup they will kill anything so fast, that anything is ok. Protections problem is that you literally dont gain anything good from it. Believe me, i have levelupped in prot. It makes your tanking abilities marginally better.
---
2manning quests and tanking in 5mans you benefit from increased dps more than lowering your incoming damage by 4%. 
---
And going ARMs first it saves you few golds on the L60 respec, what ever end up doing later (when you have that first 1g respect still available).
---
It's mandatory if you don't want to do shit dps on a load of the fights. Which is essentially the same thing.
---
it is not the slowest, hard maybe mistakes mean u die, but the speed is pretty good
---
What else are you going to watch after 5 minutes!?
---
Frostmourne opened after BWL launch but before AQ40 from memory. I played on Blackrock Alliance but I also raided US times but moved to Frostmourne on launch.
---
Auto attack on 1 -Check
---
speed it is above pal and rogue, warrior benefits from constantly fighting, you grind so many mobs along the way to places as it doesn't really slow you down as you're kiting to your next quest giver or whatever
---
That is so cheap for what it is....
---
But all of it is built on getting max number of crit hits for procs, increased attack speed uptime and you wont be getting that with a slow 2h. ARMs on the other hand makes your (rare) crits hit maximum numbers, give a nice bleed (counted from slow weapon damage). With kite you do \~same damage as just sitting there but take a LOT less damage yourself.
---
And you can kite to the next mob, saving time on the travel (huge timesave).
---
For sure. People try to optimise but a 40 man raid of dungeon set geared toons wouldn’t have much trouble in MC/Ony.
---
If I was pugging I wouldn't join a group with a warrior dps, especially if I'm horde. Doing so would halve my expected gear return.
---
"Muuuuuuum, bring the hotpockets"
---
Yeah that was exactly the train of thought for most players. You advance in tiers of raids and you get your next tier gear.
---
\&gt; Mentioned above, mining is not used, too much time wasted. Stones purchased at 1.5x vendor from /1 should be sustainable. 
---
I don't think this is realistic during a fresh server. The stones are really useful for leveling BS early.
---
I'm guessing it also depends on the success Classic will have. If all is done and people still like it, maybe even more then retail. Then Blizzard could look into WoW 2. They know then where they went wrong with Retail and how to fix that. Staying closer to Vanilla WoW for WoW 2.
---
Imo one of the biggest failures of Vanilla WoW meta is turning paladins into priests.
---
This is why the post nerf NPCs are a BAD idea. Thank you for linking it.
---
I share your thoughts on gear on general. Now I'm playing as a tank and my priorities moved a bit more to the gear scale, simply due to having shitty gear can ruin the whole party/raid experience.
---
lol for the life of me I can't remember the name of the Dota Paladin, the one with the slow aura and the heal that's also an AOE nuke, ffs.
---
Do you think the WoW pally should be closer to the Dota version?
---
Why do you need 6k mana to farm? I'm not that knowledgable in DM farming schemes.
---
&gt;  I will try to find a yt guide that lists the great upgrades u need leveling.
---
https://youtu.be/gtxX1WQILnM?t=1296
---
It's very useful, you can use it to heal you at the end of a fight while regenerating mana.
---
I personally used it a lot on my priest while healing dungeon, let's says the rogue take agro, tank taunt the mob and instead of casting a heal on the rogue you just bandage him, letting you out of the 5sec rule 
---
is being a human more important for rogue or for warrior? pve or pvp
---
Prediction: OP wont get past level 25. He will come to this subreddit after that and tell us how we (who play) are nerds without IRL, we are wasting our lives. Hes a CHAD and now goes get all that pussy.
---
I cleared through MC and BWL on a private server, lets call it Los Dalrius, in a try-hard guild and we didn't have to pot up for anything in MC and BWL.
---
If you're in Pre-BiS there is nothing hard about MC, if you're in MC gear there is nothing hard about BWL. It's execution and not stats that are the issue.
---
I remember doing Huhrahan on live, was in the meat wall, and as long as you have your nature res gear in order you really don't have to spam green goo.
---
Once again, I'm not saying you're wrong because pots will make these fights easier - but if everyone has a vague notion of what they're doing you can down these fights without spamming consumables.
---
Easily over ready I'd say.
---
&gt; The tanking gear is very niche equipment, you should have no problem getting to a good spot early on. Off tank feral has a lot of advantages. 
---
Aye, the only gear you share with other classes are rings and necks with warror tanks and a few pices with rogues.  
---
Feral rotation is a bit tricky in catform but with the right macros and some practise any one can do it.
---
[3:40 AV in 1.12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2yDzcer7Ig)  
---
The zerg will happen. Not because it always happened in Vanilla, but because it can be done. And with retail experience of AV, the players will do that.  
---
The only thing that can stopp the Zerg is the tougher NPC and the different goals that were there before 1.8.
---
I respecced into Disapointment Specc over this news.
---
Wait was this possible in Vanilla? I never managed to do so (on 1.12 private servers at least).
---
This.
---
As a druid, I can manage up to 5+ mobs at the same time. With warrior 2 mobs are getting really dangerous, 3 is almost a wipe.
---
In vanilla if you are not extra careful, chain-pulling 4-5 mobs is surprisingly easy. Mobs patrol, humanoids run away, aggroing others, you might walk to a point of interest pulling stuff from the sides, etc.
---
iF yOu AcTuAlLy PaId AtTeNtIoN
---
Holy nova didn’t scale to well with spell power and it took 5k mana worth of them to kill the lashers. Better go with 6k for a buffer for resists.
---
You could do it with less mana... but you needed to be spec’d disc for PI and Inner Focus. 
---
It’s not going to happen. You have to grind out AV for marks and as long as there is a reward the strategy will always be get it over as fast as possible
---
If that is the case, we, as a server community, decided thát is how we want our AV matches to be. Which I'm also fine with, but I don't think we should kid ourselves that Blizzard takes that choice away from us by implementing 1.12 AV.
---
Do what you want, the one thing you should do is stop being of those people filling this sub with this crap. 
---
Just wait or you'll ruin the new feel of the game for yourself.
---
Well I would say warrior just because combat rogue has expertise built into it and the subsequent jumps past 310 are worse.
---
The competence isnt truck driving its in emotional control. 1/1000 people are capable of staying calm and rational while bombs are blowing up around you and your getting lit up. The vast majority of people on this planet are not cut out to drive trucks through IED ridden roads in the middle of the deadliest civil war in decades. 
---
Most people panic when they get yelled at, imagine getting shot
---
Yea I agree with that. God damn time doesn't pass fast enough.
---
It just takes a little more care that's all :) Since were starting on fresh servers there will be a lot of people around to group up with and get those tough quests done!
---
praise the light 
---
Sorry, I should've released a screenshot instead right.
---
Maybe do some outdoor stuff before classic is released, before you become a classic hermit :P 
---
Play a version other than vanilla if you have to
---
Wait, it's worth waiting. You might even actually even feel it's boring to play on a COUGH because you know the character is void, he won't matter to you at all.
---
The 1-60 experience in TBC is almost identical to vanilla
---
I personally wouldn't recommend playing in a pserver simply because you can get burnt out from leveling and then you won't enjoy leveling when classic releases  
---
There's enough of that already but you're right, that should be a good warmup for the big day :p
---
Did you already decide which faction you want to play? When you have the time and urge right now play the other one. One of the main reasons why i love classic WoW so much is that alliance and horde both have their own flair. Yeah I'm acutally one of this guys who read the quest texts.
---
It literally gets asked every week
---
Yesterday I critted for 800 with my bear in ST, I thought I was somebody in that moment.
---
no, in February there were multiple 40 man raids from both factions farming rep.
---
Wrong
---
I thought TC has a multiplier of 1.75?
---
Wouldn't that be 150 (damage) * 1.75 (multiplier) * 0.8 (stance) = 210 Threat per target?
---
It is also not split (since it isn't a buff/heal) so you net almost double the threat than BS between 3-4 targets. You are going BS anyways but the group members need to have done damage/healed/buffed etc. to be on the threat table for BS to take full effect in terms of threat on an initial pull.
---
Switching stances shoudn't be a problem when used initially right? You can even maintain some of your rage by having points in tactical mastery. It would be foolish to spam it obviously.
---
Again, I personally saw good warriors use it on AoE pulls specifically with success. This is why I was scratching my head when I saw some people suggesting that it is a bad thing to do, so I read up on the numbers. Again, definitely nothing you spam but seems to be a good initial nuke to apply, even to get more out of your first BS.
---
76
---
I have leveled so many charachters on *you know what*. However, this time I will play a warrior which I've done in Wotlk but never in Vanilla or TBC. So I wanted to test it out a bit, playing **very* casual right now but to not get tierd of it I'm testing out the opposite faction and race from what I've decided for in classic, just to test the class out and get the feel for it a bit. 
---
I don't know if this is something you would be interested in doing but I thought I share what I'm doing if thats any help for you or anyone else. For whatever you decide for, have fun and see you in classic.
---
There's a reason the US army recommends an average of 8 hours of sleep. 6 hours is almost guaranteed to cause problem if you keep it up for years.
---
well that sucks
---
I like how funny gnome wars look especially with pink pony tails but they seem gimped without that broken race tho on the other hand cool armors are more easy to appreciate on a bigger size like humans
---
I feel like Warrior leveling isn't so bad actually. You pull one mob and hamstring kite it while you let your rage bar build up, then you pull two mobs and cleave them down. Rinse repeat like that until 60. If you have some spirit gear you regenerate a stupid amount of HP.
---
Or to the closed parts of Ironforge 
---
That's true, it doesn't have the same meaning. Classic Wow is not out yet and I already feel like a kid anxiously waiting for it to happen.
---
7 hours of sleep has been proven to have long-term health consequences in most people. It should be an average of 8 hours unless you're one of the ~4% of people genetically able to sleep much less and not suffer reduced cognitive function.
---
Even if you don't feel like you're thinking slower, it's almost certain you will be on 7 hours of sleep every night.
---
If you play on EU i will guarantee you a slot, however ive heard that spriest are kinda bad at the start because they take debuff slots, however if youre on EU pm me :) 
---
Yea that makes sense, man I really want to but I think I'll just fight a bit longer. It really excites me that I can play a "new" Wow that is not dumbed down for another audience.
---
Yea, I'll play a night elf hunter first because I prefer lvling on Alliance but it depends on the pvp.
---
I will also level slowly, I want to enjoy every second of it.
---
Wait. 
---
The community will be worth it.
---
The urge to jump in early is palpable even for veterans but from an old vanilla player...wait, it’ll be worth it mate. 
---
Armor doesnt have diminishing returns, it scales linearly with ehp
---
what class?
---
Waiting for Scarlet Monastery, don't know how many hours we would spend trying to jump onto the torches outside. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/EwZTuKY
---
Well done, haha.
---
I too avoided mods and addons until i felt like trying them in cata.
---
But I still removed the autoattack symbol as soon as i started my character
---
which races have bonuses for those other weapons?
---
Glad you liked it, I got a lot of shit for being a clicker when I first put this video out there....I don’t think I even knew what keybinds we’re back then tho haha
---
Gotta keep that nature resist up, it definitely wasn’t the best weapon I had but his eye beams hurt :(
---
I remember it being pretty tough going early on. The gnoll packs in Redridge were a particular bitch but once you got into the mid 20s and had a full set of greens etc it wasn't that bad. Once you're in the 40s and have the swords from SM and RFD then it's cake
---
Does he know Classic is coming back out?  He might hire you for real money this time.
---
I was a mage all through Vanilla.
---
Amplify is used only on fights without magic damage, and there are a few scattered. Learn which and use it for those but otherwise It didn't even make it to my bar.
---
Dampen was on my buff bar alongside Arcane Intellect. I had Dampen on 99% of the time, unless there was consistent physical damage. Which almost never happened, most aoe was spell. Yes it reduced healing but the reality was that it saved your life from magic damage, and as a mage you usually didn't receive much healer focus outside of a hot anyway. So if you got hit, just pull back and fix up like normal. Dampen saved my life a lot.
---
In pvp, Dampen was permanent. It's again way to useful, and you don't usually have a pocket healer lola@. Amplify in pvp is essentially sucide.
---
As for Mana shield, I'm one of the mages who was always arcane first and then followed with fire/frost. But even wihout the talents, mana shield is a god send if you weren't frost, which was most pve content ouside of MC and aoe farming. Once I could pick up fire again in BWL I didn't even bother to swap for farming, so i used mana shield a lot. Combined with Frost shield its overkill in pve, but really nice in pvp. Otherwise it's the single spell that saved my ass more than anything. So many mages I saw never used it. I had it active more than a priest with PWS.
---
I personally know what I'm going to be playing in Classic, so to quiet my hunger (until Sekiro is out tomorrow) I rolled a character that's the total opposite; opposite faction, ranged DPS which is the only thing I won't be doing on my Classic main. I also limited myself to 29 and then just stuck to BGs.
---
That way I'm still getting a feel for Vanilla without spoiling the class/zones I'll be playing soon, and nothing past a certain level. 
---
100% sure i did lots of those! 😋
---
I’ve seen a lot of posts complaining/advocating for min/max but I guess I still don’t understand it.  How will it change how the raids progress now?  And bro you gotta keep those DoTs up or you risk A 50 DKP MINUS!
---
I made that mistake. I started playing retail right after blizzcon and all of the announcements. It was a horrible decision. The new mythic+ system is great fun, but has made the community complete shit. 
---
Some classes are better for the affixes of the week giving them priority. The problem is that really only matters at the high end keys. So there are two problems here.
---
One, people at the low end hear their favorite streamer talk about what classes or gear scores are important at a +16 key and think it applies to their +5 key.
---
Two, some classes have trouble with each weak. Meaning that it’s completely possible your main will actually be worthless for a whole week for dungeons. 
---
A ton of groups try to only invite people of their armor type who are way over geared. That way, because of loot trading, they hope that they’ll get whatever items those people don’t need. If you’re a tank or healer you might not have much trouble with this, but DPS will almost never get an invite unless you’re one of the over geared. 
---
Professions have been made almost completely worthless. Enchanters only enchant rings and weapons, Arch still makes the flasks and potions, any of the armor crafters LW, BS, Tailor, had completely worthless armor that you could replace immediately, jewel crafting was almost completely worthless. 
---
Gear had a chance to drop at a higher item level than its base because of warforging. So you could get a piece of gear that was warforged and it would be 5 ilvl higher than what it was supposed to be because of a random chance for an upgrade. There was also titan forced which would be I believe 10-15 ilvl higher. One of the upgrades that could come with a warforge or titanforge was the chance for a gem socket. It wasn’t even guaranteed that it would get a socket. There was just a chance that maybe it would. So jewel crafters made no money because tons of people didn’t have a single socket but gems were extremely easy to make. 
---
Gnome warr is better than human for PvP though, escape artist is gr8
---
Silly alliance, username definitely checks out!
---
i really miss the old art style that wow had back in vanilla.
---
This literally whats happening: 
---
A) Vast majority of people will play the BG as efficiently as possible.
---
B) the remaining x% wants blizzard to FORCE the majority to play in same AV for 5-48h. Claiming its the "correct way".
---
I don't have kids (am 45) and my routine is the same as it was at 30:
---
0:30  - 8:30 sleep
---
8:30 - 8:45 shower/make breakfast (I eat at work)
---
8:45 - 9:00 commute
---
9:00 - 17:45 work
---
17:45 - 18:00 commute
---
18:00 - 19:00 cook/eat/watch news
---
19:00 - 0:30 Me-time (sport/WoW/tv/series/fora etc)
---
Well that’s one more time than my wife ever has! 
---
Orcs for axes, so none Alliance side, but as I said, having a greater range of weapons to pick from can make up for the lack of racial bonus. Obviously there's also edgemaster's at play too: if you can get that then you can be any race of fury warrior and go ham with axes that no one else needs which can be amazing.
---
I'm glad youre not playing Division 2, and while youre at it, dont play classic either please
---
And honestly, that’s probably the more fun way. Zeroing gets repetitive when the one thing you do is race to the end. As long as the community can Zerg they always will and as long as there is a reward that would always be the plan
---
Instantly no. But after a bit of time when current gamers see and experience why we play it, and old ones keep coming back, Id say it will. Especially because live wow is time gated. I reakon the majority will do live content in a week or so and then move back to vanilla every live patch.
---
Honestly, I want AV to be more of a longer game. But at the same time. AV back in the day had a lot of numbers that changed how mobs and other mechanics work. 
---
If those numbers are going to be current wow, then sure. Rush would be a thing. 
---
But it those numbers go back to the old days. Those archers are nasty. 
---
Strategy is also dictated by those numbers. You can get more efficient but you still can't ignore a mechanic that is just not possible to beat. 
---
I might be old and blind, but I cant find a readable format, only the raw data?
---
Good old nostralia. 
---
i started playing in legion and fell in love with Blood DK. im looking forward to classic but want to know if there's any tank/class with a similar playstyle. or will i have to adopt something else
---
posts in /r/thedivision
---
i wonder why u said this
---
WoW pally should be close to W3 pally, and it is while leveling:
---
High armor
---
Slow, hard hitting weapon
---
Heals and support spells/auras on the side
---
That is a retadin or a prot paladin. You are a melee class with some healing magic. Holy should focus a bit more on the assist but shouldn't be a cloth wearing healbot.
---
(I'm aware that WC3 meta also makes him a healbot in pro games, but it isn't one during the campaign and noobie gameplay)
---
TC should hold no innate threat modifier to it as far as I'm aware, where'd you find that?
---
And sure in theory it looks good, but TC is 20 rage which means you need to be in BS from previous fight with rage saved up, charge in or stand like a twit for a few seconds to get rage (or indeed spec at least 4/5 tac mastery, but I personally believe there are better a lot more useful pickups), then you switch stance probably again losing anywhere between 40-80 rage depending on tac mastery or not, just for TC.
---
 Outside of raid bosses you don't get melee'd too hard in classic generally, you'll be hit for like 1-200, what hurts are the instant cast fire blasts, blastwaves, and other spells that smack you for a couple of thousand, so again outside of a boss like Broodlord or Nefarian or Chrom or what-not the attack speed slow is really quite miniscule. I'm not saying using TC is going to make you the worst tank in the world, but in my mind the cons far outweigh the pro's regarding it, and in the only scenario where it's proper great (in raids) you have plenty of fury warriors who can do it for you.
---
This is awesome to me.
---
I'm not going to 'play' though.
---
One time when they did this, I used my second account to make a picture of all my characters stood together. I dressed them up in the sets/gear I wanted them in. It was the last screenshot. The final end to years of playing live wow.
---
I'm now going back with 4 friends this weekend who also quit long ago to do the same thing for them. Talks with these dudes usually end up being a huge vanilla tbc nostalgia trip too, so I'm excited for a few hours of reminiscing while making some cool pics for the walls of our home.
---
No lunch break?
---
Does it count toward working hour? 
---
Only working 7h per day?
---
&gt; I even went to Durotar and The Barrens to do the neutral goblin quests in those zones!
---
I see, you a person of culture as well :) I did Captain Grayson's quests in Westfall as a Horde and goblin quests in Durotar/The Barrens as an Alliance. Players from the opposite faction looked at me quite funny though xD
---
what if you tank tho
---
I wouldn't say they are "gimped" but yeah for pve expertise is a pretty big deal, but escape artist is a pretty big deal for pvp. I mean unless you are main tanking/dpsing in a hardcore guild its not gonna matter a ton.
---
But if you make an alternate timeline you will probably get to the point where people suddenly demand Classic 2. There would have to be a few servers that always stay on classic and new servers for the other stuff.
---
The hard factor is the fact that rage gen is mainly based off crits and getting hit and the fact of having good weapons. So if you do dungeons to replace your weapons its really not hard at all
---
Tradechat
---
I did and I have no patience. No good combo. That means I dont wanted to wait for full hp and pooled and gambled every fight. So I died much more, as I should.
---
If you have patience, I think warrior will be fine.
---
Yes, and he said "speedrun". Speedrun means no professions apart first aid, no dungeons : you don't have time for that. See Joana's videos : the guy barely take the time to regen, engaging 2 to 3 mobs at a time.
---
rogues do way more damage if they spec combat
---
Exactly. So the community wants to burst through it as efficient as possible, so that's what they do.
---
I think it's funny that people call the exact same behaviour 'an epic war' in the 1.7-and-lower AV while it is called 'turtling' in the 1.8-and-later AV. 
---
Literally unplayable if screenshots are not .tga files.
---
I mean I've seen certain videos of demon hunters doing some really interesting stuff so...
---
Take a cold shower and wait. The investment into a permanent character adds so much to the game.
---
Oh yes bud
---
My pserver GM is a gnome warrior and there’s no tank on the whole server I’d rather have in my group
---
If you want to play gnome, DO IT!
---
Funny enough, I probably learned more from playing WoW that I did in school.
---
Try reading it again. 
---
Man, I remember that quest.
---
It was 6 AM in the morning, stoned, first time in barrens/horde area. I was scared as fuck and the barrens music has this orc noise, that made me jump.
---
Finally i meet an undead mage. We stop. Look at eachother for a while. I turn my back to him, but still keep an eye on him. He starts channeling fireball. Unfortunately for him, I had duelled my mage friend a bit, and already knew the fear-dot-dot-dot routine of warlock pvp. Yeah, he was undead but he probably didnt remeber or even know will of the forsaken.
---
One of the best memories of vanilla :D
---
He said:
---
&gt;\[In\] most of the fights, there is no fire resistance on the bosses themselves.  There are a few and that makes it difficult but not impossible.
---
Which means that fire is better than frost for most of the fights for the same reason fire is better than frost in AQ and Naxx.  Fire is somewhat worse on the fights with resistance and obviously much worse on the fire immune boss.  I found that overall the difference between fire and frost numbers is not as clear-cut as many think.
---
Another guest on Josh's show a few months ago said the same thing based on their vanilla experience.
---
This couldn't be further from the truth 
---
Warrior is the most popular class. Tanks are the least common player. Do the maths.
---
Are you basing this on your own retail vanilla experience playing fire in MC?
---
These concerns mostly stem from retail players. Your mindset is different.
---
Since retail is completely devoid of any meaningful social structure or interaction, all you have is new content to want.
---
People with experience in Classic/vanilla know that the social structure is the backbone of the game. We can enjoy the game for years for that reason alone. 
---
You'll see when launch hits. You won't need new content, because that's not what Classic hooks you with.

---
&gt;The community will be worth it
---
You can find a great guild and ppl from private servers. Connect with them before classic is released. I would HIGHLY suggest playing right now.
---
ENB?
---
There were tons of NPCs, not just at towers but many patrols, guards and even a small war on the frozen lake. You just couldn't go through all of that on your own without aggroing the whole lot of them. Sometimes a group would reach a graveyard without having killed the NPCs in the way and it was impossible to reach that group without dying first. xD
---
I'm not sure now because it's been a while to say the least but I believe there were also mini bosses along the way. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe there were 2 stronger NPCs at the entrance of each towers.
---
Shadowy zones still get me, even IRL. After all those years.
---
with a blue girl.
---
I'd love too.
---
Armor DOES have diminishing returns, what the heck are you talking about?
---
Every point of armor provides less damage reduction than the previous one. Much less. 
---
The main reason not to play classic is to not get burned out. I would wait for that very reason. 
---
That can easily happen in a game like that. 
---
Took me a long time but I never thought it was "hard." Too like 10 days played when I rerolled though which I understand to be pretty bad.
---
Uhh, that's what this conversation was about...
---
A lot of people dont really ENJOY AV or BG's, they do it for the exalted rewards that are FAR better than anything else at that stage. You do zerging for 2-3 days and never set foot in the instance again (excluding ppl going for lotus/mining nodes).
---
It might be "fun" for a week, a month. But it will get old. 8 hours of mages aoeing in middle. One guy trying to sneak past getting ganked by 10 ppl.
---
You can get that outside the instance too.
---
That was Jazzrik and it was to get more bloodsail rep at the most terrifyingly slow pace. From vanilla through early Wrah you got 1 rep per kill (until wrath and he was removed right after), you got 1 rep per kill. Killing him on his 8 minute respawn would take 70 40-hour weeks or 2800 in game hours to finish.
---
&gt;I'll be in a better financial position anyway.
---
You start with 2000$ a month. You pay 700$ income tax. You end up with 1300$ for your own.
---
You quite job. You end up with 1000$ of unemployment that's not taxated.
---
You save 200$ on getting to work and back. You save 100$ on lunch. You save 200$ on electricity when cooking - you'll stick to snacks now. You save 200$ by quitting good quality food.
---
That gives the total balance of +400$, compared to previous month.
---
There are several factors that make leveling faster or slower. With "easy" vs "hard" people just mean speed and effort required to maintain a class relative speed.
---
1. Damage avoidance. Some classes have better tools than others to completely avoid getting hit. Sheep/Frostnova/Blizzard, Frost/Ice traps, Pets, Fears, Sap/Stealth etc. are some examples of abilities that help you to completely avoid taking damage at all and there are plenty more. Warriors basically only have Hamstring kiting for the most part.
---
2. Combat healing. Healing classes obviously heal themselves during, right before/after fights, so they decrease downtime/risk by optimizing health and mana management.
---
3. Traveling speed in and out of combat. Anything that increases traveling speed or combat movement speed is again great to avoid downtime either by cutting down travel time or by being more health efficient during combat.
---
4. Crisis management. Even the most experienced players get into situations where they need to give it their all to survive or even pull out of a fight. The more reliable your tools are to accomplish this the less corpse walks you are going to have. This also means you can take on harder encounters more conveniently.
---
5. Damage, AoE. The raw damage output of a class simply determines how fast mobs are killed. AoE is obviously a huge plus.
---
6. Mana dependancy. Some classes rely heavily on using mana to kill mobs. A good example of this are mages. Often people will tell you that they are top tier levelers but that is \*only\* true if they are using AoE as much as possible. Single target damage mages have long/frequent drinking downtimes and thus have a low to medium leveling speed.
---
7. Attendance/Effort. This is a weird one but most people aren't full-on tryharding when killing the one hundredth Mountain Lion in a row. Classes that need more concentration and mechanical effort will always be slower on average.
---
You can easily see that Warriors don't excell at most of these points. they are allright in some but compared to other classes? All the fast classes can tick at least 4/7 of those points as being top tier for them. For Warriors to be fast level you need at least tick nr. 7 and really put effort into kiting and rage efficiency.
---
Also many people will cite "gear dependency" but let me tell you that this is a heavily overblown issue when leveling for all classes. Yes your gear makes a difference, but going out of your way to upgrade your gear will slow you down, not speed you up in the long run. The rule of thumb is to do dungeons just as many times you need to complete your quests, which often give worthwhile rewards. So for almost all the leveling dungeons this means 1 clear at most. Also Warriors get their Whirlwind Weapon after lvl 30 (with help) which is a weapon that is amazing at that level and even serviceable into your early 50's. So for the most grindy chunk of your leveling you don't need to worry about a weapon upgrade at all.
---
&gt;I have come from the future to warn you all that removing Thrall as Warchief can lead only to good times.

FTFY

Besides any other uses, Dampen Magic is a good purge protection against Shamans
---
Don’t play if you have a family, you made a choice...  it’s honestly honestly super fucked up that you would consider even neglecting your wife and kids for even 1 min to play any video game after you’ve committed to marriage and kids. Let alone classic wow, a massive time sink. I have very deliberately kept my gf at bay for 10 years in lieu of playing games... she’s wants kids so bad lol NTY.
---
You’re obviously a god among men /bows 
---
I did.
---
Eating every pull.
---
I can guarantee you, even if you make it the HARDEST version possible, in classic ppl will rush past each other, killing every tower slowly. You wont see the idea you have in your head of the "epic battles", most AV's will be done efficiently, no matter how its setup.
---
And in the end, people just wont play it because its such cancer.
---
Yea, just like putting all premier league soccer teams in the same tier would be idiotic and laughable. Dude you are mixing up ranking and tier ranking, two different things. Are druids in the premier league? They can tank all the way through, that's pretty impressive and useful if you ask me. Out of that LEAGUE where paladins are stuck, and in the same league as warriors.
---
Levelling as much as possible through instances can be quick and lucrative.
---
And his alt No.
---
I would love to be wrong about this!   Like I said I really have no idea.
---
Also PvP/E experiences are different for rogues. Even if they're not themselves gankers, rogues still have a much better chance of avoiding being ganked.
---
I wouldn't trust those machines, it's probably powered by gnomes running in a hamster wheel!
---
It's the hardest class to level, but that doesn't mean it's hard, people just like to blow things out of proportion.
---
Horde or alliance Druid 😩😩
---
Is this real
---
bye bye. Nobody cares.
---
SM, RFD, Uldaman, ZF.
---
its build in SIMS
---
But 1.21 is pointless. I don't see why you'd want to recreate WOW vanilla only to deny one of the most important aspect of it and offer a retail experience instead.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2yDzcer7Ig) is what we'll get. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Why? Because some people can't deal with coding a few extra mobs? Because listening to people whining on forums hurts my fragile little heart? 
---
There is no valid reasoning behind this travesty. I'd personally prefer that they'd remove the BG all together, it's only going to poison PVP as a whole. If you can get away with a 4 minutes AV, that's all people who farm honor will ever do. It's toxic. And it's blows my mind that people can't foresee how awful this is going to be for everyone. There is nothing that can be said that can justify this and certainly not a whataboutism argument. 
---
While I don't agree forcing 2h+ AVs  is the right choice, I think they should still undo the NPC nerfs to make it harder to zerg the boss. At any rate, it wont be as bad as people like to make it sound.
---
signed 
---
You don't know history then, I was there when the gates of Strath opened and we had 15 in our group, and we would FIND 15 to go in and finish the dungeon.  This tells me that you really weren't a beta and/or a Vanilla player.
---
Rag's sons were decreased so that he could be killed, even after his initial nurf.
---
And you're speaking with your ass son -- as all of this is documented, even in video's.  But then, your "game" isn't WoW -- you're still trying to PWN and still failing.
---
I'm basing it on the FR of bosses in vanilla, yes. Doing a full MC run as fire will see you pretty useless on many of the bosses, due to their very high FR. Curse of Elements + Arcane Subtlety isn't remotely enough to offset it. Taking a fire mage to Rag is basically just saying you want to do the fight with less people.
---
thats harsh
---
I didnt find it hard but thats because I ran each dungeon a few times because I just really enjoy doing dungeons. Which led to me always being really well geared. So questing never felt too difficult. Also first aid helps a lot.
---
u described my life
---
What are you guys’ opinion on DM vs VC?
---
They can't take vanilla away once the implement it, or people will just want it back again. So vanilla servers are going to be here to stay.
---
TBC is almost inevitable if Classic takes off. Either totally fresh servers or a one-way transfer from a vanilla one.
---
Keep in mind it just absorbs physical damage, so that statement is not true Vs non-melee classes.
---
Horde
---
I did not even knew this. Thanks.
---
I am glad that they are adding fixed AV instead of shitshow, antifun and most important AV with purpose 
---
Fun fact, when Blizz was testing Naxx 4 Horseman fight, testers used voidwalkers to tank them, making the fight really easy, so they had to change it.
---
It was a developer that said it in Countdown to Classic.
---
I've leveled at least four holy priests in Vanilla, because I enjoyed healing in dungeons versus pulling mobs.  That's what my alt was for...
---
So go for it.  I've healed many a fury warrior in a dungeon (even at 60) and to be honest, it's nice to have someone who understands both protection and dps leading the group.
---
That's the thing about warriors -- especially when you level, is that your group will be expecting you to know how to pull the dungeon.
---
But by all means, go for it, we've all done a horrid pull at least once in our WoW lives, and it's definitely not going to be the last.
---
*Filthy casuals*
---
You sound like a nice guy!
---
Why is the large chunk of land in the foreground there? It's supposed to just be water until a good bit out from BB.
---
The general consensus is that mage and warlock are both extraordinary pvpers and pvers. Mage is probably on the easier side for pvp. 
---
Real talk, was threatened with a kick from my first guild for stacking spell power and ‘only caring about high numbers’ as a mage. Their argument was that I would run out of mana, even with mana pots, mage crystals, evoc and so on. 
---
I was also called a dumbass by a rogue for calling him out on using sinister strike with a dagger for a whole raid, telling me I didn’t know shit about his class. 
---
Vanilla sure was fun, I honestly hope we get a large influx of people who don’t know shit, and judging by this sub and my experience on private servers, we will
---
I think the best part about this screenshot is the dude tryna get earthroot in general chat... things like that are what im excited for in classic wow
---
&gt;  but it still wont sway me from being a gnome. 
---
I feel like making my first 3 classes all gnomes =))
---
A hunter can kill 3 mobs all 3 levels higher with relative ease. On warrior one mob the levels higher it's basically a death sentence.
---
Good point.
---
Unfortunately warrior is typically the desired tank, paladins just don’t cut it and are mana hungry, it’s totally doable just not practical. Paladin is probably closer to blood than warrior is. 
---
I was wondering if my char would survive cataclysm by staying on the arrow of the ship in Booty Bay. Probably was inspired by the cinematic with that huge tide hitting statue in Booty Bay. Sadly, I didn't save any screenshots... When I logged back on the day cata launched my character was dead. I think they did that to everyone no matter where they were so no one gets stuck due to zones revamp.
---
I learned to type fast and my english was years ahed of my classmates had. I remember I never had to study english because of wow. my bff was always helping me with my grammar : ) 
---
I think he/she tried to combine the island off the coast with the statue with the mainland
---
Thinking before or after June?
---
I’d agree with you that any class isn’t hard to level, but some are much slower than others. 
---
But god damn it, fuck the shaman totem quests.  I will definitely not be going down that road again. 
---
Sorry, I thought you were going to point out this mentality, as I requested:
---
&gt;"you either accept me in the raid group exactly the way I want to be accepted or you don't"
---
Not link to a bunch of threads of people who don't care about specs trying to form a casual guild.
---
You dont seem to have any kids obviously. How time consuming it is is one thing, but priorotizing yourself for a few minutes or hours a week is much better for your relationship to them than neglecting yourself some time off.
---
You might understand the need to chill out when you are a full time dad and husband :)
---
My wife is all for this.

Hi, /u/JHoneyBadgerS

Unfortunately your post has been removed because it was thought to be low effort.

If you feel this was an error or have any questions, please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fclassicwow). Thanks!
---
If you call TBC the future than yes. But during classic vanilla I dont think so.
---
I have a regular 8h job and a dog. And as i asked my boss for 3 weeks off he said, i better should take 4. just to be save.
---
No TBC please... let’s just stay in kalimdor &amp; eastern. 
---
Flying killed this game anyway. 
---
Pretty fucked up world when you save more money by not working. 
---
It's very sad to read a comment like that and be like "Actually I don't read that very often" although obviously as WoW is a game, everyone should see it that way.
---
That minmaxing mindset has completely poisoned some players. It's crazy.
---
I'm child-free. Best decision my and my girlfriend ever made.
---
I was more annoyed by searching for that roaming giant 
---
No no it’s not. It’s a lot slower in classic to run dungeons to level up to 60. You may want to do them once or quest but the dungeon grind is slower than questing in the world. 
---
Agree
---
Pornhub instead of Netflix. 
---
He doesn't seem too interested, i said "Hey you know they're releasing wow classic right?" and he just kinda brushed it off, maybe i could get him addicted again though who knows.
---
Dwarf warriors are viable in all aspects of the game. They are better in PvP. At various times in the server life you will not be competitive for absolute top dps because the weapon skill racial helps most on raid bosses. If you can live with that don’t sweat it. 
---
If my memory is correct, no you can’t. You will learn to read the animation on the opponent character.
---
For the specific case of free action potion, I don’t remember if it’s a magic effect. If not, your dispel will not have any effect anyway
---
Can’t wait to level to 300 fishing on the first week of AV weekend
---
"our goal isn't to speedrun to 60"
---
They only do this because the ranking system in vanilla is so absolutely aids.  If that were to be fixed, having old AV would actually just be a slug fest again.
---
Apologies, I didn't think you had difficulty mapping the logical conclusion that the reason people were trying to form a casual guild was because the "min/maxers" a.k.a. anyone who wasn't interested in a casual guild would not let them raid as their desired spec, which was also evident in many of the comments **in that exact thread**.
---
Like, for example, if you were to see 100 professional clowns deciding to form a basketball league exclusively for professional clowns, and then many of them would proceed to comment that they can't have fun because the regular people won't accept them in their basketball league dressed as professional clowns - I think it would be a logical thing to assume that:
---
* they expected to be accepted in the basketball league as professional clowns
---
* they care more about being professional clowns than they do about playing basketball 
---
If you are still struggling to understand this concept or think that this is not the correct logical conclusion, let me know. 
---
&gt; You clearly don’t understand the psychology behind the success of wow. It wasn’t appealing to the casual player whatsoever, it was its ability to put a hardcore player in a position for casual players to envy them. 
---
Man those guys keep surpassing each others. This sub is a true gold mine.
---
They can talent an aoe slow it’s really nice leveling. 
---
That's a playerbase thing though, AV:s were boss rushes on the last private servers I played on, not depending on the version they were using.
---
I’m talking about the beginning of vanilla. Tanks used to advertise in LFG chat how much hp they had. “Prot Warrior lfg scholo/Strat 6k hp”.
---
You can only show enemy debuffs. Buffs are not visible on enemy players or mobs, so you have to look at the character's animations to see what they're casting. I.e Free action potion looks like blessing of freedom animation. Same idea with castbars.
---
Don't worry though, there's 100% gonna be addons that parse the combat log and tracks this information for you.
---
Great video.
---
So much nostalgia. Your guild was definitely better than mine though. We had a good core, but were carrying too much derpers to kill C'thun or make it to the end of Naxx.
---
To avoid ActiBlizz fucking up a post-Naxx content, I will always want a static Classic server option.
---
But, tbh, I want post-Naxx content. Not TBC. Not Wrath.
---
A new path.
---
Problem is...can they (ActiBlizz) deliver it?
---
I have no idea.
---
Dang nice
---
Burning crusades when I finally got good. 
---
You can only see target buffs if a Mage casts the Detect Magic debuff on the target.
---
Being constantly overleveled makes questing much easier.  The ideal range is Quest level +5, where you still get full rewards but the targets are 5 levels lower than you.  Makes the xp from mobs a bit worse, but its hardly noticeable.  Most people don't plan their quest route, so eventually do all the quests available and leave themselves having to grind just to unlock the next level of available quests that are a few levels above them.  
---
&gt;&gt; Can you seriously not see how running into those types of people constantly might kick your enjoyment of the activity down a few notches?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;No, because I'm not 14 anymore and I have more confidence in my ability to play and enjoy this game than what random strangers on the internet tell me. Maybe they have a point, maybe they don't. Instead of crying like a child that people are mean to you, it might be better to actually research and get an opinion whether a certain race/class combination:
---
So in a game that had heavy emphasis on community, the attitude of the community has absolutely no impact on you? Yeah, sorry man, calling bullshit on that one.
---
&gt;* is a viable raiding spec (i.e. it can be done)
---
&gt;* has been/will be accepted in raiding groups by speaking to recruiting GMs (i.e. it can be allowed in a raiding group)
---
&gt;* there are videos of certain race/class combinations raiding up to Naxxramas on the internet (i.e. it has been attempted/done before)
---
&gt;Overall, those arguments are a far better counter to all the people who would tell you otherwise than jerking each other in threads like these that everyone who tells you that you can't raid as a *insert whatever here* is a min/maxing elitist asshole jerk who will hate playing this game because Vanilla is all about the journey and [insert 20 more minutes of regurgitated bullshit here]. 
---
Uh, no. These people are not entitled to a justification. That's the problem and it seems to have glossed over you entirely. If I'm playing a suboptimal build for fun and minding my own business, I owe absolutely no one else an explanation. You seem to be of the opinion that people minding their own business should have to defend their choices. 
---
Bro wtf did u just say 
---
&gt;most people didn't play older versions of AV, and therefore it's shit
---
huh?
---
I rolled a dwarf warrior in Classic... probably about 10 or 11 years old at the time.  Stupid ole me didn't realize there were different classes, so when I clicked "Create New Character" that was the class it defaulted to so I went with it.  
---
That being said, i thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't realize until I was higher level that it was any slower.  I will likely roll it again.  
---
Rageroot need earthroot
---
And why didn't any mod delete this?
---
1. Low-quality meme
---
2. Content not related to WOW Classic
---
Wall junking was possible because how graphics and geometry was processed back in the day 
---
Engine has been reworked so many times I reaaaaaaaaally doubt they even know how it was 
---
As others have pointed out, only way to visually see enemy buff icons is through Detect Magic. 
---
With that said you need to be able to identify the spell animation triggered from using these consumables if you wish to dispell them. Same obviously goes for priority spells you wish to get rid of asap. 
---
LIP/FAP/LAP all have unique animations. Best bet would just be to play the game, familiarize yourself/test it out and slowly let yourself learn. 
---
&gt; These people are literally looking to form a community in which no one cares about that. 
---
And that's fine, but if it's a community where half the premise (from the comments) is "anyone who's not accepting of us is a min/maxing 15 year old tryhard" or "I'd rather have fun than min/max" (implying people who don't play like them are not having fun) then it's a bullshit premise. 
---
The opposite is true as well - if you want to min/max and be a server first guild, that's fine, but if you're going to boast in threads how everyone else is a worthless noob and should probably quit the game in order to highlight anything about your guild or your stance on this game, then you're full of shit.
---
&gt; They are minding their own business and yet somehow, you find something wrong with that- perhaps because you have the elitist minmax mentality that people in this thread have a problem with. You absolutely cannot stand the idea of people willingly playing suboptimal specs and other people willingly going along for the ride.
---
They are receiving valuable advice which goes against their circle-jerking mindset of "yeah man, we'll all clear naxx with ret pallies and feral tanks" because it's an unrealistic expectation. 
---
I don't care what people think, but for their own sake and for the sake of potentially good and genuine people reading, it is important that these people understand why there are certain limitations as to what you can and cannot do in terms of raiding in order to not buy into false expectations.
---
Your exact words, painting non minmaxers are arrogant and selfish. Find an example of this. 
---
Either you will play on PVE serwer, or you will play on horde.
---
You're not my friend.
---
Thank you for sharing! Wow, this is VERY thorough for rogues! 
---
Hunters have made up 10-12% of the lvl 60 population on every single private server with that data available.
---
Get that bbq ready
---
I think people are underestimating it. Think of all the different types of people that could try it out, you have:
---
- People who played in vanilla and enjoy private servers (minority)
---
- People who didn't play in vanilla who envoy private servers (minority)
---
- People who played in vanilla but never tried or stuck with private servers due to personal opinions, not feeling real etc
---
- People who never played vanilla but aren't satisfied with instant gratification games, prefer old school MMOs (these are seeing a resurgence at the moment)
---
- People who never played vanilla but are getting sick and tired of modern WoW and want something more meaningful
---
- People with fear of missing out
---
And many more. I think we'll find that us in a constant state of hype for the game and playing on pservers will be the minority when the game gets rolling. 
---
Part of what made vanilla too difficult for some was a lack of knowledge, knowledge is easily available now and the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction you can have in the earlier version of the game can't be topped. Many will be converted.
---
&gt; So in a game that had heavy emphasis on community, the attitude of the community has absolutely no impact on you? Yeah, sorry man, calling bullshit on that one.
---
I'm leading one of the best WPvP guilds in the world as an Undead Warlock. The amount of shit and debate I've had over the fact that Orcs are objectively better for PvP has not convinced me to change my mind. You're just being ignorant and childish at this point. 
---
&gt; Uh, no. These people are not entitled to a justification. That's the problem and it seems to have glossed over you entirely. If I'm playing a suboptimal build for fun and minding my own business, I owe absolutely no one else an explanation. You seem to be of the opinion that people minding their own business should have to defend their choices.
---
And that's true for anything outside **group content**. You are going to have to owe explanations to other people if you start raiding. Explanations about your raiding schedule, your spec, your consumables, your assignments - these are all things which are going to be expected of you in a raid setting where 39 other people are going to be involved. 
---
But if no druid would have access to that, your player skill would shine through because you would keep track of your mana in your head. 
---
That addon wouldn't be a big loss.
---
&gt;&gt; These people are literally looking to form a community in which no one cares about that. 
---
&gt;And that's fine, but if it's a community where half the premise (from the comments) is "anyone who's not accepting of us is a min/maxing 15 year old tryhard" or "I'd rather have fun than min/max" (implying people who don't play like them are not having fun) then it's a bullshit premise. 
---
More like "I don't find min/maxing fun." You're really reaching here.
---
Meanwhile, in this thread, someone was *demanding* justification for how you could have fun in a suboptimal spec. I didn't see a non minmaxer doing that.
---
&gt;&gt; They are minding their own business and yet somehow, you find something wrong with that- perhaps because you have the elitist minmax mentality that people in this thread have a problem with. You absolutely cannot stand the idea of people willingly playing suboptimal specs and other people willingly going along for the ride.
---
&gt;They are receiving valuable advice which goes against their circle-jerking mindset of "yeah man, we'll all clear naxx with ret pallies and feral tanks" because it's an unrealistic expectation. 
---
Except, in that thread, they admit they don't expect to progress far. No one there held they expectation. They are receiving no new information, and often times the repeated information comes with a dose of condescension.
---
Zero, never heard of that NPC
---
There was at least 300 french player in french guilds on LH and more dispatched in english one so I would say all combined we should be able to fill one server
---
NE tank has the extra dodge which makes up for lack of ws. Dwarf tank can work too and thrives against certain bosses because of stoneform. Can't say I know how well gnome tank does.
---
As someone who is currently playing Vanilla wow private servers I can say leveling a warrior is absolute hell. I die while leveling a warrior far more than on any other class, insanely more. You have to run away from enemies every time you hit them once till your swing timer resets, not fun. Your damage is terrible while leveling in comparison with just about every other class and ret paladin leveling being better says something.Classic WoW in it's current state is not replicating Vanilla WoW and leveling a warrior on it is easy peasy compared to what it was actually like and on blizz like vanilla WoW servers.
---
Let’s call it “Screenshidded”.
---
Which aoe slow?
---
Seeing screenshots everyday makes it so hard to wait.
---
Iirc the +5 weapon skill racial is worth **3% hit** without any other weapon skill gear. You can read about how hit is calculated [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit) and about attack tables [here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table).
---
I don't know for Rogue, but for Warrior it's as much as an estimated **10% dps increase**. Usually, you'd wear [Edgemaster's Handguards](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14551) if you're not Human or Orc since Hit is so important to reach the Yellow Hit cap, and pretty hard to get.

To be fair though, the first 10 or so bosses of Naxx ranges from fairly easy to somewhat challenging. Only the last 4-5 of them are actually pretty hard.
---
Same with AQ40. Only really Twin emps, Ouro and Cthun is actually hard (by vanilla standards)

Would it be too much to have 2 versions you can queue for separately, standard for the lower health and fewer npc version, and "epic" for the longer version? Or would that split things up too much?
---
Minus because 16:9
---
This is a huge factor when it comes to leveling on PvP servers. Rogues 30-60 will stomp on most other classes if they have cooldowns ready.
---
Damn it, no HQ button

&gt;they're just below priest

What? Priest is one of the fastest leveling classes in the game. Right behind Hunter and Warlock.

Also the reward while leveling, remember getting that dungeon quest done and getting a sick blue item and maybe even getting one in the dungeon? Felt like you could kill anything with a new fancy item, especially weapons.
---
8% for specials against bosses really isnt hard to reach though
---
&gt;&gt; So in a game that had heavy emphasis on community, the attitude of the community has absolutely no impact on you? Yeah, sorry man, calling bullshit on that one.
---
&gt;I'm leading one of the best WPvP guilds in the world as an Undead Warlock. The amount of shit and debate I've had over the fact that Orcs are objectively better for PvP has not convinced me to change my mind. You're just being ignorant and childish at this point. 
---
Congratulations.
---
&gt;&gt; Uh, no. These people are not entitled to a justification. That's the problem and it seems to have glossed over you entirely. If I'm playing a suboptimal build for fun and minding my own business, I owe absolutely no one else an explanation. You seem to be of the opinion that people minding their own business should have to defend their choices.
---
&gt;And that's true for anything outside **group content**. 
---
Which is my point. This thread was to bring to light as to why minmaxing is hated so much. It's because a vocal minority *inside the community but outside group content* are incredibly aggressive and toxic. 
---
In every thread regarding this, there was overwhelming consensus that raid leaders are fully within their right to select specs and classes amount both minmaxers and nonminmaxers. 
---
It's already fixed, you couldn't do it in the demo. Curse of the modern client.
---
That's actually amazing, honestly.
---
Loch Modan, right? That place really doesn't get enough attention. If I'd start an alliace toon, regardless of race I'd definetly get there to level.
---
That is correct! You have met the qualifications.
---
What do you want to do end game? Sure you can use any spec, but shamans are most effective as healers and hunters are a lower tier dps. Regarding your philosophy, I'm more in the camp of wanting to relive my vanilla days but do it better. So I'll be going the same class/faction I did then. Also worth considering, hunters level fast. If you had the time to level both, that's not a bad combo.
---
I think most of us learned early, hey i cant pull a bunch of guys or i die. and I have no heal so we just naturally took it slow because no one was reallly worried about getting to 60 the fastest
---
Yeah, I have good hopes about the newcomers playerbase. After all, only those who enjoy the vanilla for what it is will join and remain, but I also feel they actually are more than we think! If Blizzard chose to open classic servers, its because they know they will get many players or, at least, enough.
---
People downvoting you for suggesting the class based around having stuns is hard before you are high enough level to get stuns.
---
Lmao.
---
Still one of my favorites
---
Depends on how the backend is.. 
---
Obviously they are running on the 7.5 engine, but useing what textures, geometry and animations they have from 1.12. To make these things "fit" into the 7.5 engine there will be adjustments... If smoothing out edges is part of these adjustments, then no. I hardly believe this is a "feature" they will put effort into conserving if it comes to that.
---
Both druids and priests can hold their own with r10 gear. Splash in some epics from exalted with the BG factions and you'll be just fine.  
---
I'd go priest if I were you.
---
You missed my point completely but I understand you have limited hours of sleep and unwinding because you choose poorly.
---
You can learn Piercing Howl from the Fury talent tree at level 20.
---
B) Ain't nobody got time for that.  The majority of people who are going to be playing this game are going to be the ones who played it 15 years ago.  We were much younger back then, with far less responsibilities, and a lot more time on our hands.  Between work and everything else I wouldn't even be able to play AV if it took 5-48h...
---
Your unclicked help topics gave me cancer. Good SS though, love me some Loch Modan!
---
They're both good, although a Mage can PvP/Raid in the same spec whereas a Warlock will have to respec based on their raid's needs.
---
Did not work on the legion client or 1.12.
---
Yes those are the correct primary concerns for TBC. Maybe a case for changes?
---
&gt;Have fun in your 45 min queue trying to get a 40v40 going without
---
... PVE players queue for the rep items. 
---
There, i fixed it to reflect classic wow if they go with 1.5 AV.
---
&gt;Back in vanilla, Prot warriors focused exclusively on hit points. Pre-raid tanks would walk into MC with 6k hp. It wasn’t until Vanilla was almost over that we (at least the warriors in my guild) started comparing armor (the damage mitigation listed in the character screen), block, dodge, and parry
---
This is not really true.
---
I played a Warrior tank myself, and the focus was very much on reaching critcap and being crush immune. There was a lot of theorycrafting available at the time for those who really wanted to know.
---
Piercing howl lvl 11 fury talent. 
---
The only character I levelled in vanilla was a warrior, but in the past few years I levelled a mage in the private servers and from memory I remember levelling the mage easier 
---
Hehe, all of my around 5 old screenshots I have has unclicked help topics. Life of a 12 year old. 
---
Loch Modan is correct! It's a really beautiful zone. 
---
I can image that some like-minded people who prefer a drawn-out AV will queue together and make like a living hell for the fast honor farmers. It will be hard to maintain interest in that style of play though, since the game won't reward it as much/ At the end of the day, players in an MMO are drawn to activities with the biggest incentive.
---
The OP post must resonate with a ton of folks given the passage of time. My buddies and I would all love to push to 60 and raid but in all likelihood it ain’t happenin’ with the different life stages, careers, etc. that being said I agree with the dude above - Druid and priest makes the most sense. Gl!
---
Absolutely will not be in Classic.  It would be a massive undertaking to put into the new client and Blizzard would have, without a doubt, proudly announced they're pouring hundreds of man hours into re-implementing wall jumping.
---
When I rolled hunter on vanilla after my priest, I read up on theorycrafting available and about how to aimed and multishots between autos, what pet to use, hit cap etc, how to talent (2/31/18 til hitcap).
---
Yeah, but raiders still pull away and become very bursty at this stage. More so than we plebs.
---
Yes, because the 1 minute of damage immunity would have been great....
---
If paladins heals were nerfed into the ground and their DPs increased, then fine, but you can't also have your 3 "oh shit! Full HP again" cake and eat it too.
---
People always played AV for rewards.
---
Some farmed rep tokens, some only to get their quest weapons, some people for the good questing XP. I am just glad I can max my rep early and be done.
---
Maybe try level each to 20-30 and see which one you like the most. It's about at that level you start to understand your role more clearly, and how the class plays out. Shamans are all about totems, and if you dislike having to place totems then you won't like them. Hunters are great if you're into complex damage rotations working around their autoshots.
---
That's encouraging, thanks. Am leaning towards priest, but the mobility and stealth of druids is so very tempting.
---
Just play nothing but AB and protect farm/stable and call for help. Easy.
---
&gt; But we just established that if all you care about is dps and have no interest in tanking, warrior is at least as good as rogue.
---
Everybody keeps saying that but I have a sneaking suspicion that this is only true on private servers. In true vanilla, DPS warriors were extremely rare in raids. Sure, players have gotten better and optimized gear but I feel like there was something in the game mechanics holding back warriors that got lost on private servers. 
---
Interesting that you mentioned things that aren't related to being fast besides Sprint, if you wanted to prove a point say Blade Flurry, Riposte and Adrenaline Rush
---
The real reason why Warrior is faster is because of how they kill mobs, you Charge 1 mob, stack up rage while kiting it, now Charge 2 mobs use Sweeping Strikes and rage dump with Cleave/Whirlwind etc, you've lost about 25% health killing these 3 mobs, you can go on to the next one, Charge one, stack up rage, your SS will be off cd by now Charge in and nuke 2, you do it 3 times, that's 9 mobs before you have to eat, rinse and repeat.
---
Another reason is that they aren't forced into going Dual Wield like Rogues are, which is bad without a lot of hit chance (you don't get hit gear while leveling), they also get to wear stronger armor which means when they do get smacked while kiting mobs they take much less damage, so less eating...
---
Also don't forget that you're engaging almost every mob with Charge, which covers 25yrds, and since you Charge thousands on times the distance really adds up (1000 mobs = 25000 yrds), much stronger than Rogue's Sprint every  3min (1.5min talented).
---
&gt; Except, in that thread, they admit they don't expect to progress far. No one there said otherwise. They are receiving no new information, and often times the repeated information comes with a dose of condescension.
---
No they are not? The [original comment goes something](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayifz3/how_many_would_be_interested_in_a_casual_memespec/ei12y6b/) like what you said, which is a fair comment. And then this exchange happens:
---
random#1: *you will get into naxx like this, don't worry.*
---
random#2: *No you won't, people will start to get burned out by 2 hour MC runs and get sick of other people not pulling their weight and they will leave for greener pastures.*
---
random#3: *It depends on if the people are fun to hang out with or not. If all your 'weight carrying' players leave it's often a problem of not having fun instead of not going fast.*
---
random#1: *you will get burned out way faster by spending 3-5 hours each week doing nothing, but preparations for your raids.you are cutting your raid time short by increasing the time spent on chores. there is no net gain in time investment. all you end up doing if taking time from the fun part, raiding, and putting it into the chores instead, farming and preparing.*
---
random#2: *Like I said people who do take the time to prep will eventually leave for better guilds and leave you with 40 people who are too lazy to raid prep. Good luck getting through Naxx with no consumes.*
---
What random#2 is saying **is true**. What everyone is saying is just hopeful idealistic bullshit. But regardless on where you stand on this argument, you've got to remark that this is not what they are arguing along the lines. 
---
&gt; sm/ruin
---
it's really not that good in PvP
---
Must be an alt.
---
The best tanking spec is fury. Just play fury.
---
That's why on p servers costumes / savory deviate delights are so popular because compared to 8/8 dungeon set - pre- bis makes you look like a walking oil stain. I pretty much saw 90% of new faces in MC / ZG with ninja/ pirate costume to hide their swag
---
!Remindme 2 months
---
If it is successful they release BC servers.
---
probably warrior or paladin
---
either way a lot of meleeing^^
---
I raided casually with various guilds on pservers in the last few years.  Many of our raiders were in the 25-35 years old bracket, and crying or laughing toddlers were not an uncommon sound on our discord channel.  in other words, people could combine parenting and gaming.
---
Casual guilds will understand you if you say that you have to take a break to put the kids in bed or when junior had an accident.   Just don't be the main tank or any other crucial role that requires 100% attendance and concentration.     
---
Max of 16 debuff slots on the boss. Min/max guilds will make sure that only the most efficient ones are up -- no rend, holy fire, moonfire etc.
---
Warrior was my first main in vanilla. I was a complete noob and did just fine. Also, once I had a bit of gear, when someone tried to gank me, I had a pretty good chance of killing them instead. 
---
REE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE
---
you usually level with most points spent in feral tree and some in restoration.
---
then you just mix it up between stuff for extra armor while tanking dungeons pre 60 or improved stealth/bash if pvp is your interest.
---
[like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AATE9zzdAA), rest of the points would be to your liking/playsystle
---
Tp  be fair? Our guild cleared 95%  of all raid content without being elitist jerks and played for fun.
---
That's proof if anything that optimization isn't THAT important. It's important if you really want to hardcore raid ofc.
---
What is a Sergeant-chef? In WoW context, I mean. In the Army, it's usually someone in charge of slinging slop in the mess hall.
---
I'm not saying 1:1 replication of paladin abilities. WTF would the ultimate  even be then? Mass raid resurrection? I mean keeping the theme of the class.
---
Paladins should be primarily a tank with a bit of support or bit higher dps if specced into that, never a fully fledged dps or a healer.
---
I really really wish this was true.  Especially as a paladin.  Those last 10 levels are brutal and dungeons are not faster by any means.  
---
if there are mobs stacked up just aggro one, they'll all come but only hit that one mob with shoot/throw and kite it back until the other mobs de-aggro then you can kill it, rinse and repeat.
---
Warrior can solo Elites early on, I've never had trouble soloing Blood Ripper (Stonetalon Mountains) Quest at level 26-28 with Retaliation + Fear Bandage
---
Man I forgot about them! Christmas will be quite well timed in classis at 5 and 17 months.
---
ROFL
---
It's quick if you're comparing it to leveling by meleeing boars with a priest, and lucrative if you're comparing it to making new characters and selling their starter gear.
---
&gt; Congratulations.
---
So you believe me when I say that watching R13/R14 Undead Warlocks and talking to good PvP-ers who've agreed that your skill, consumables and dedication weighs more than your race choice has convinced me not to care/listen to the "play Orc if you're serious about PvP" crowd? Because I wish people would do the same for PvE. Don't just rely on what people are saying on Reddit, find videos and guides and judge yourself whether it is possible and how likely it would be to achieve whatever dream you have.

&gt; This thread was to bring to light as to why minmaxing is hated so much.
---
&gt; In every thread regarding this, there was overwhelming consensus that raid leaders are fully within their right to select specs and classes among both minmaxers and nonminmaxers.

So explain to me exactly what it is they are hating if not the raid leaders' right to select specs and classes. What exactly is getting to them and how is it impacting their game play is not their ability to
---
It's not that hit is hard to get, it's that it limits your options. If you don't have to wear Edgemaster's you can get gloves like [Reiver Claws](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13162) or the [Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15063) for the set.
---
I had never played an MMORPG before WoW so I didnt have anything to compare it to. I simply thought it was this hard regardless what class you choose.
---
Man, was I wrong huh.
---
Mate you'll be ok to do aq20 zg MC only and probably bwl, don't worry, just play smart :)

Is this correct? Nobody knows for sure, but given that there is a huge community and open source code for the server, this is what our best guess is, based on digged up research from vanilla days.
---
As for impact on you, it depends on your current gear, as you can see most impact you get is going from 300 weapon skill to 305, but if you already have some weapon skill, like for example if you have Maladath going from 304 to 309 is not that great.
---
Glancing chance is 40% and damage done is from table up. Approximation is that white hits are about 50% of total damage (glancing happens on white hits). 
---
So very roughly going 300 to 305 will net you 6% more damage, and going 305 to 309 will net you 2,5 % more damage.
---
Piercing Howl
---
Piksaus is correct though. Armor does not have diminishing returns. Armor having diminishing returns is a myth based on the fact that each point of armor give you less damage mitigation in pure percentage points than the previous armor point, but the damage reduction doesnt. I will give you a simplified example of how armor works:
---
Say the boss hits you for 1000 damage with 0 armor. You have 5000 HP and will die in 5 hits.
---
Add 100 armor, and the damage reduced by armor is at 20%. It will now take you 6 hits to die. 1 more than before.
---
The boss hits you for 800 damage with 100 armor. You have 5000 HP and will die in 6 hits.
---
Add 100 more armor, and the damage reduced by armor is at 36%. It will now take you 7 hits to die. 1 more than before.
---
As you keep going up in armor, the time you survive vs getting hit by the boss has a linear relationship with the armor you add up until the point where you hit the armor cap.
---
This graph shows the true relationship between the amount of armor and the time to live.

For a more in depth explanation check out this link: [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor)
---
Rogue and Mage can kill other players naked so...
---
If we're talking alliance warriors or rogues, being human is a big boost obviously but you also have to consider the competition for swords is pretty insane among those two classes.
---
One argument in favor of other races is that they can bypass the huge competition for swords and take the "leftovers" axes and daggers, therefore getting earlier access to good weapons. Now keep in mind you'll have to compensate this race choice with Edgemasters or ACLG and those can be just as difficult to get as good swords.
---
If your flair indicates you're talking about ret pal, then it's another story... I guess you won't compete for weapons as much considering you'll want 2Handers. Some people will say min-maxing on a paladin is mandatory because your damage is very weak and you want to take any advantage you can get, others will say min-maxing on a paladin is pointless because any bonus you would get from the human racial will be negligible since your damage is so low anyway.
---
WoW-pro.com has a good guide from 30-60, and a few guides covering different parts of the 1-30 experience. They made some updates to the main guide in TBC, but 95% of it still applies. Not sure if Jame or anyone else is going to be around to update it, though.
---
I’d just take mining + herbalism while levelling and send all the ore to a bank alt until you are ready to take engineering.
---
Or I’d pick up herbalism after engineering is maxed because either way the herbs you pick to level herbalism aren’t going to be worth much at the start.
---
&gt;8 hours of mages aoeing in middle. One guy trying to sneak past getting ganked by 10 ppl
---
This, so much this. I don't understand the love affair people have with 1.5 AV - there was not much 'real' PVP in it at all. I used to love jumping in to break up levelling 51-60, but as soon as I'm exalted I'll stick to AB/WSG where individual skill actually makes a difference.
---
Its ok we dont really support this, its a minority. Check the "Likes" on classic content update and the AV update, then check out the EU en one, nobody likes it. Every thread about AV since Classic announcemnt was about wanting 1.5-1.7 AV. Now there is around 15 AV threads saying 1.12 is a bad decision.
---
You wont be able to turtle much, the trend of rushing will get popular and everyone will be against defending/turtling.
---
Good luck man, i give up on this shit. Not playing.
---
are you shoehorned into sl then? I doubt the other dsac/ruin works then
---
If PServers are anything to go by, then yes, guilds stockpile more than you can imagine.
---
To be fair, HP is probably more important than anything else for 5man. You are mostly dealing with large groups with multiple castermobs, and you need to HP to survive this.
---
The only people who want 1.12 AV are people who don't want to play AV. So they just want to get their marks and get it out of the way.
---
The vast majority of people who are looking forward to actually playing AV want the old AV.
---
So who should we listen to? The people who have no stake in AV being good other than quickly getting their marks, or the people who actually enjoy AV?
---
I get annoyed when people who don't care about AV being good because they don't like AV to begin with want to force everyone else to just rush 1.12 AV so they can get rep/marks.
---
Okay. I've trawled through your posts and it looks like this misconception about "no changes" goes way back, despite other people explaining it to you again and again. Your ideas included changes that were never a part of vanilla and people didn't like them. Enjoy your vitriol.
---
Demo was a fake version of the classic we will get, you can’t make this claim with certainty.
---
Do a los pull and try to find a group where the dps doesnt start before you even attack the mobs. Or a healer that doesnt put a hot on you (and pull aggro). Facing them head on is sometimes just much easier.
---
I agree that if your guild is struggling with downing the fire resistance bosses, frost is probably the better choice.  But even for the resist bosses without CoE and subtlety I found the difference between frost and fire isn't nearly what is claimed here.  Specifically, my fire dps was 75% compared to the bosses without resistance.  Factoring in the higher baseline fire damage puts it pretty close to frost.
---
And if we consider the speed run zergfest many claim MC will be, overall average dps is what matters.  In this case I would bet that fire beats frost due to all the non-resist bosses.
---
While I agree with what you started with there, what does this have to do minmaxing? I'm pretty sure quite a few minmaxers will lvl one of the best dps classes that is also the best tank. 
---
No offense but are u from the us? 
---
But pservers are illicit services hidden from the view, often with questionable monetisation, and they usually offer some outdated version of the 1.12 client
---
Classic will be in available in everyone's battle.net. Millions of players will be able to install it with just a single click. I'd be surprised if a million people even knew that private servers are a viable thing.
---
AV is fun if you're not there to:
---
a) Grind Exalted for the rewards
---
b) Grind Honor for ranking
---
You cannot solve this situation cleanly. Someone will be pissed off no matter what you do. Imo the current solution is half decent, though I wish at least Korrak made it in. Since I'm planning to rank in Classic I can't say longer AV games appeal to me *that* much.
---
&gt; If I learn the class well and keep a set of cloth int/spirit gear for healing, will healing as feral be an issue? 
---
druids have a versatile hotw spec that can be used to fill any role ( except caster dps) with just a gear swap so yeah its fine for 5mans up to ubrs
---
Right behind Hunter, Warlock, Druid and Mage... Priest, Shaman, Warrior, Rogue, Pala....
---
There are better ways to do this, but yes you could.  Herbs are worth more than ore so if you're not an instant gratification type person and don't mind taking a AH hit on every transaction then it works.  
---
You could make friends with PvPers with mining and engineering themselves, most of will also want potions.
---
Absolutely feasible, but not recommended.
---
Yes it's in the pacific ocean near the Philippines
---
Miss miss miss parry miss die
---
Oooo I'd forgotten about that! Long drawn out day-long AVs where lots of people just give up and fish. I remember fishing next to an enemy druid, every so often one of us would /sigh.
---
Fury dual wielding, pop deathwish at CD. Well, thats what our tanks do in (private servers).
---
Wait what?! There are no PvP pve in BFA what the fuck?
---
Man. You lucky SOB. My dad and I had a few shouting matches about games in general, let alone WoW.
---
It even has a docking platform on 'this' side of the image.
---
have you considered rogue?
---
Just stack stamina and always wear titans then?
---
You dont gear in anticipation that the raid is all composed of bad players who fail to keep themselves alive.
---
I think you show the problem really clearly; if you are in AV for alternate reasons than to actually enjoy the match you are not going to have a good time in an epic war. People see AV as a way to grind purples/ranks and that is what divides the community from the people that want to play AV for the epicness of war.
---
Stronger NPCs really does make a major difference.
---
Old AV = You could leave 10 players back and really slow down the enemy's progress most of the time.
---
1.12 AV = Unless you leave 20 back it's tough to slow them down. And if you do and they leave 10 back, they'll win. So it's smater to just race them.
---
Warrior is about 2x slower than leveling a hunter for me. I tend to pull two mobs at a time and constantly grind from quest to quest on hunter though. Warrior is a blast to level but its a whole nother ballgame.
---
Its basically THE premade pvp spec...
---
This^. 
---
Dungeons take 30 minutes alone, on average, just to get the group formed. Another 20m for the entire group to get to the instance. And usually at least 2 hours for a smooth group to run most dungeons. It’s like a 3-4 hour time commitment, and you will probably gain 1/2 - 3/4 of a level even with all of the dungeon quests. Usually takes 1-2 hours to level before lv50 by doing quests.

---
Took this picture of my own setup during the classic demo!
---
Question: did any classes benefit from their blue dungeon set (i.e. it was BIS or close to BIS)?
---
The rewards are very legitimate reasons to be in AV. The problem is that the fastest way to those rewards is diametrically opposed to playing AV in a fun and interesting way.
---
I've been relatively active on *those* kinds of servers (wink wink) in the last few years. Everyone hates AV. Everyone hates how the "best" way to play plays out. You can win a game in under 7 minutes if you know what you're doing. You can grind Neutral to Exalted in 2 days if you know what you're doing and you're gonna hate every minute of that.
---
But the problem is, it beats the "other" way to get the rewards, which is spending significantly more time in the place in "proper" games, and we're talking factor 10-20 more here.
---
My personal solution here would be to say fuck blizzlike and tweak the honor and rep rewards so that rushing games are worse honor/rep per hour. Ideally there should be a big boost for every objective you claim. This is not a perfect solution, because now you're gonna get games where people rush those objectives and then /afk out, but it will be a significantly smaller issue.
---
If they add long ass AV's and you have like 2-4k pop servers, ill bet you wont be playing AV either. Because people wont que for it if they know its just waste of time in regarding rep.
---
Or you will see SOOO much AFKers there.
---
I think you need to lay off that bong.
---
People don’t have anything worth discussing, that’s why every single opinion is blown up and the discussion that’s left is mostly hyperbolic opinions blown way out of proportion. 
---
Yes, warrior is the slowest class to level, and yes, it’s by far the most gear dependent and the power curve of a warrior is negative for most levels compared to other classes. For instance levels 22-29 and 49-59 (honorable mention is 30-40 if you can’t get ww axe or a decent drop). 
---
But yes you are totally right, nothing is ‘hard’ about leveling, but on a scale comparing all classes, warriors have a objectively tougher time than all other classes, paladins coming in a close second. 
---
Engineering is one of the cheapest professions to levelup with AH.

if your going to take someone’s content and post it, give credit. this was made by u/SimSativa
---
With the force limited view distance, performance requirements would be much less than legion with the view distance set to max.
---
&gt;Another reason is that they aren't forced into going Dual Wield like Rogues are, which is bad without a lot of hit chance
---
Rogues get 5% hit from talents really early. It also doesnt matter nearly as much as for a Warrior because their resource generation is not tied to landing melee attacks like how rage generation work. They also get Blade Flurry which works similar to sweeping strikes. I get that you may have some biases towards warrior as its probably your own class or something, but facts are facts. 
---
Warriors are the slowest class all things being equal and that wont change just because you want it to.
---
A hunter joined our raid group named Gronli on Azgalor-US during late MC progression and he maxed out spell damage for insane arcane shots.  He out dps'd a lot of our regulars and became a server meme.
---
Alright then, you can't wall jump in BFA so you won't be able to wall jump in Classic on the same client.
---
It’s objectively speaking by a good margin the slowest class to level by all serious accounts. 
---
"play AV the old way"? So you mean 25 people Farming NPC's for items to make money 10 people doing the quests at the mines/rounding up wolves and rams and 5 people PvPing? yeah, sure is fun.
---
Downvote me into oblivion but its the truth of old AV, and the truth always stings. If you want "old school AV" make a forum post and organise it with the server to delay games a long as possible, You're still going to be able to farm herbs and ore while doing hand ins while the people who are there for marks, zergs wont happen without premades so you're still going to have games that last 1-2 hours instead of 7-20 hours.
---
&gt; I've trawled through your posts
---
Sure you did buddy.
---
Limitations of the medium. 
---
You'll notice the statue isn't a massive goblin statue either.
---
try hamstringing 3 trolls and 2 troll shamans on the beach of STV, there are some thi gs you just can't hamstring. A troll gangbang is one of those things.
---
Depends if you prefer cows or front flipping whilst jumping 
---
I seem to remember having Mining + Herbalism was a bit tedious since you could only track one at a time.
---
It's easier once you know the node locations by heart though, I seem to remember getting there during the pre AQ event.
---
During leveling, I'm not sure you would stumble upon enough of the resource you are not tracking to reliably get the next level by the time you move to the next zone.
---
I think it's the German translation of master sergent
---
Not necessarily but that doesn't mean artificial time lockouts for rare items, not automatically. I think discussion on it is good.
---
&gt; I wasn't interested in ambushing people 
---
Thank you for being an Honorable warrior.
---
I believe this is not relatable because back then, we had no comparison. I'm not a native english speaker and back when I started playing WoW in vanilla, I only understood the simpliest words. I had no idea what they wanted me to do in the quests, so I ended up only doing the "Speak with..." ones and grinding the rest.
---
Did I think I was weak and the leveling was slow? Hell no, I had a blast and tons of fun. We just didnt know better back then. You should try leveling a warrior and a hunter both to 20-30 on a private server and you will understand why people say warrior is "hard". It's not really hard if you do it properly, it's just a lot harder and consuming than other easy to level classes.
---
What about big rewards for objectives, but you only get them when you are still in the BG when it finishes?   Or would that be unfair if games drags on for hours and people need to leave? 
---
So incorrect lmao
---
They are already known.
---
The build is on 7.3.5, which is the modern engine.
---
While that is a proper solution to this particular problem, we cannot open up the can of worms which is *changes*. So I think we should suck it up, accept the fact that we get 1.12 AV and if you want to enjoy 40 man wars you should make a premade and do so.
---
You can do 90% of Molten Core in Greens at level 58. 
---
I can hear it.
---
I'll be honest, most of the stuff you're describing will take way more time than raiding. Vanilla raiding is the really easy and least time consuming aspect of the game, especially for non-melee classes.
---
&gt;I've seen it commented that while levelling people may reject druid healers from groups because they're not as good as others and don't have a normal res. Having played on pservers, I just can't see this happening, but this won't be like vanilla. People will be more switched on during levelling in Classic, so that may happen. If I learn the class well and keep a set of cloth int/spirit gear for healing, will healing as feral be an issue? I'm assuming I'll have no problems here as a shadow priest.
---
It will not be an issue at all. Any spec of healer can heal while leveling. That being said, why would you want to heal as a druid while leveling when the class is the best five man tank there is and being a tank gets you groups much faster? 
---
Wall jumping was a bug in the old client. They won't recreate an old bug.
---
This thread: Pepega
---
Ofc you use the keyboard to move. How else can you click the abilities?! Stupid people using mouse to move and keyboard for spells... like there were any keys close enough to the arrow buttons...
---
Yea i mean i'll do that. We did that quite a bit on the private servers. Queue up 20 people, and just defend against the alliance premade who were farming honor. Forced them to leave and get deserter.
---
Alliance premades are gonna absolutely dominate AV like they did on the private servers.
---
We just want Korak, tbh. The tougher npcs wouldn't be a bad thing either (you can still win &lt;20mins with 1.5 AV, it just takes a little coordination).
---
IMO I think it's possible for a given period of time for say, a year because, I think the majority of players who have played retail and class/BC agree vanilla is better so will go for that option, and it's attracted a lot of hype. Then blizzard will just relaunch BC or go create a new expansion which will take over
---
Every click I see, I die a little IRL
---
But all you want is for AV to be as efficient as possible for rep and honor, right? Like i'm assuming you don't ever play AV to have fun?
---
Shamans heal people using bananabeams, hunters can't compete with bananabeams.
---
Sorry, I was 12 when vanilla was released. So I don't understand you who're 12 when Classic is released =(
---
Homie you can't use charge in combat. I don't even know where to start with the rest of this, what vanilla have you ever even played? Where the fuck would you even kiting and charging around mobs at as a warrior???
---
The time consuming part isn't the fucking walking around it's the caution you have to exercise. If you overpull as a warrior and don't have 30 min CD's up, you're dead 9/10 unless you get a decent intimidating shout off and book it.
---
Same
---
Educate yourself.
---
The way the client handles collision meshes has changed over the last decade and a half (duhh) to reduce the amount of effort a game engine expends rendering a scene whilst the player moves around and interacts with it; so collision reduction was necessary.
---
If you can give me a single good reason why Blizzard would spend hundreds/thousands of man hours making their client run more inefficiently, while simultaneously not mentioning a word about their massive project to their foaming at the mouth fans, then I concede.
---
https://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/blender/collision-models.php
---
lmao
---
So what happens if you leave back 30 people and send only 10 forth, stealth capping the objectives? The NPC's are nerfed so they should be able to 10-man it.
---
You get epic battles 30+NPCs vs 40'ish while you slowly cap their objectives and win? By the time they recognise they will mirror the strategy and ta-daaaa: We get epic AV's again. I see no losers in this scenario.
---
&gt;vanilla succeeds and after things finally get stale way down the road they decide to progress to BC (which i would personally love. i dont think anyone really hated bc as for the most part it kept true to what vanilla wow was)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;vanilla succeeds but no one wants it to follow the classic wow path into new expansions. but how does that keep people playing for years? it could take an OSRS route, which i think would be cool. new content gets polled before implented into the game, the game never goes past lvl60 but instead adds new content for players/guilds to do past naxx and stuff. because the reality is if vanilla succeeds and the community refuses to let vanilla turn into BC servers. there has to be SOMETHING past vanilla once everyone who sticks around has done everything.
---
I would like to see a mixture, Maybe go up to WotLK (as that was where about a decade of Warcraft story came to a head) and then just split off to new things.  Cata and everything that followed after was Blizz coming up with new story elements, so they should do that again, come up with new story, but stay true to the systems that classic is reintroducing. 
---
Hoping my buddies want to roll on a PvP server with me. Yes it's frustrating sometimes, but also so much more engaging and fun. To me anyway.
---
They, however, are not huge PvP fans. Although they might consider it for the simple fact that there is no flying.
---
I don't want to be stuck on a boring PvE server! Help!
---
You have to work with what is given to you! :D Sims limits you on lot sizes, this is the biggest one but still not enough for my buildings! :D you can't edit the surroundings, that's why it doesn't end with a huge sea. 
---
ur gay lol
---
and ur one of my partners
---
&gt; World of Warcraft peaked because of the success of vanilla. 
---
Except WoW's peak was toward the end of BC/start of Wrath, It peaked because of how good TBC was, and maintained that because Wrath was also good/Had the lich king
---
Likewise and we made it through AQ40. That's why I'm not overly concerned with mix-maxing. If people want to do it then they should but it's certainly not a requirement in my books.
---
Tirisfal Glades is my all time fav classic zone... especially playing late at night.. just the calm ambience with the music in the background... I can't wait to spend hours there in classic. 
---
u getting mad

---
Ninja looting was never a problem. Ninja looters were blacklisted and that was enough. The community always fixed ninja looting.
---
But ninja looting is also not an offense. You can loot whatever you want, whenever you want. Thing is, it will only work for a number of times, before your entire game play experience will be dead.
---
Idiots ninja looting some stuff in ZF or ST will exist. However, they won't be able to do the same later on...because nobody will take them in groups.
---
A Classic realm population is extremely small, and a ninja looter life is extremely short.
---
By all means, but that's a lot of extra conditions simply to justify using thunder clap.
---
And this isn't even taking into account that thunder clap goes by the spell hit table (afaik) so resists aren't at all uncommon as a tank.
---
weardo
---
I think creating a lock-out will work as an incentive for some players. If everyone has a special mount it's no longer special. Do you think the mount should be available all through classic? Maybe it shouldn't even be added?
---
The thing is, its not what i want.
---
Only thing i want is blizzard to release the game as fast as possible. You can make 7 month long AV's for all i care. But if they are 1.12 like, ill do at least rep grind on multiple chars, resulting in (even in rush style, BG weekend) for easily 100h+ spent in AV.
---
And when i play AV, i do play it. Not just afk in a corner.
---
We take a 30 minute lunch and it counts towards our 8 hours.
---
so incorrect lmao
---
No you couldn't lol, don't try downtalking a season just because you didn't achieve shit in it. 
---
all shoutcasters, hosts and players have unanimously said that TBC Arena competitions were the hardest in WoW's history. 
---
Perhaps so because I played alliance and only saw the other side of it, but they had zero problems killing the quest givers in all of my games lol
---
Stealing words ur so mad

This is the pure embodiment of all things good in vanilla.  PoM/Pyro mage with melee attack keybound to 1.

"True" wallclimbing got fixed in 2.4. Classic will be based on 7.3.5 ( end of legion ) client.
---
So no, walljumping will not be in classic.
---
BUT
---
In retail are are still able to get stuck against a wall after your first jump against it. You are unable to do a "far jump" ( W+spacebar ) after you're stuck. But you can still jump. ( spacebar than W )
---
Why does it look so different
---
still thinking about me baby?  lmao
---
Ahh it's not the same lol
---
ooops my bad, you were right.

I'm going to disappear now ;-)

The National Sleep Foundation has published studies and results indicating that adults are recommended to get 7-9 hours of sleep. They only begin to say 'not recommended' for 6 hours or less.
---
[source](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times)
---
Just like on Pservers, there will be the mark rushing, and occasionally there will be "da epic bridge battle". Savor the latter and just roll with it. Not every AV has to be 72 hours of no lifing.
---
Hunter T0 4piece combined with the right items can be quite good.
---
Wall jumping as people did against mountains will not be posible, maybe your first jump only. (Like I explained before)
---
Wall climbing vs the high pillar/walls in ironforge was fixed in Tbc. 
---
Hope this clears things up? If not could you fomulate your question diffrently?

Raiding and PVPing

I hope so, but playing for free on a PS doesn't mean you will pay for a Blizz server.

It's a colorised photo from 1932
---
I appreciate this thread and would love to see more discussion like this on this sub!  I'm planning on doing something similar to you, OP, but as a Warrior.  Leaning towards a 31/5/15 Arms/Prot spec that will let me PvP and tank dungeons at 60.

We should start our own guild and call it &lt;Filthy Casuals&gt;
---
1.11  and 1.12 vanilla Wow version of AV was a zergfest, nothing more. I quit AV when these versions were introduced.
---
You aren't gonna 10 man the bunkers and boss, especially in a pug  The bunkers will get backcapped.
---
Sorry brother it’s just not true. You’re either failing one of two scenarios. 
---
1. You significantly overestimate players know how to play current wow 
---
2. You significantly underestimate players didn’t know how to play vanilla. 
---
Could you get away with not minmaxing in vanilla up to naxx? Yeah. That doesn’t mean a huge portion of guilds didn’t know how to minmax. We had less resources but guilds were using elitistjerks just like they’re using YouTube videos now 
---
My comment may have been a little misleading - I meant it's not the same as in, it may be there now, but it's not the same as being able to wall jump to the top of Stormwind :d
---
Yep they sure will unless wall climbing is a thing (which i doubt it will be with the current engine) Horde need to be able to wall climb up the side near the stables to counter 5-10 alliance turtling on the bridge, otherwise 2 hunters, 2 mages and 1 pally can just hold for days with the archers on that bridge.
---
Be a hunter and become the meme.
---
Or become the shaman and be treated like a queen. 
---
I think this is accurate and goes pretty deep into the root causes of the changes in design philosophy that led to the feeling the game has now. It may be due to high level game players becoming game designers (Ion is a great example, but many WoW game designers have played the game as loot chasing raiders, especially those at high levels). 
---
Very accurate and thorough
---
Yeah, it's always being exaggerated
---
Ill do it (after a charge+ bloodrage) because you have the rage for it, changing stance without it would usually mean loosing rage anyways and its aoe. 
---
After a max range charge a battleshout wouldnt hit ANYONE in your party, so thats even LESS threat. Demo shout in battle stance, not that great either.
---
So from the options given its actually pretty good. You lower inc damage, have a aoe threat start on all (every mob will hit you first), giving you tools to continue in def stance.
---
Ele/resto shaman for PvP/raiding
---
or 
---
Hunter for PvP/raiding
---
I am mostly going to raid and get gear that way. BGs are probably my favorite non-raiding activity followed by WPVP. My friend is going druid so we should get easy 5 man groups together. I like to destroy people at range in PvP. Shaman will make me feel good as a team player. I wanna mess around tanking in 5 mans as well. I should be able to get some cool gear from raids that will make me crush in PvP. Hunter will be harder to get a raid spot if I go that route. Hunters are really fun in PvP though and it is what I played when I played retail classic wow. Either way I am probably going horde orc. Any really in depth analysis would be really helpful. I am not really looking forward to farming gold so whatever class is best at it would be an advantage. I assume hunter is a win there. I hope neither of these classes are that gold dependent anyways. 
---
There’s a “war mode” you can enable which allows you to engage in PvP combat in the world, and gives you an experience and resource gain bonus. 
---
Oh yeah, that reply totally makes sense in this thread. Having a lvl 58 or two with greens totally make Molten Core take less time to finish!
---
On the other hand if you offtank and switch into cat to do dps. Which is far better than a prot warrior in raids, you don't need this crazy rotation anyway.
---
I think bear offtank is just so good. 
---
I really don't think you can go by pservers. Those servers have the most dedicated players from around the world. Each of those guilds will likely be on a different server. 
---
legit. Just use time efficiently and get your Pre Bis and you won't have a problem until AQ 40 and i'm not even sure it will be a problem then. ZG pugs will be running all the time every day MC and ONY pugs will be everywhere. I'd go dwarf priest to maximize the fact that everyone will want you in a group for that fear ward even if your gear may be a little bit behind the curve. Have fun man don't sweat it
---
Rule #1 - only Classic WoW content here please!
---
Yes, the blue post right there
---
Skinning was probably one of the most under-utilized professions back in Vanilla, but also for good reason. It was only used for leatherworking which benefited rogues, druids, hunters, shamans. Those classes will often run skinning/leatherworking and be self-sufficient. I don't think leather did all too well in AH because skinners are able to skin the corpses of NPCs that other people are grinding who can't skin, or skin bodies in a dungeon. I don't think skinning would be the best choice here. I personally always liked Herbalism/Alchemy. Potions come useful in Leveling/PVPs/Raids, theres always money in herbalism and alchemy and they don't decline over time because raids required so many consumables. Nice thing about mining/engineering is that you get a lot of unique items from engineering that are helpful in leveling/pvp/raiding, and mining resources can sell well on AH for blacksmithing/engineering. Typically enchanting/tailoring are the typical professions for casters. Enchanting has a lot of value, but you really have to go after those unique patterns to set yourself apart on the server. Got crusader enchant? You will be hit up by every warrior and paladin on the server, etc. My gnome mage was a tailor and I did not see much value from it. Ill prob run alch/herb and engeering/mining for my NE Druid and Gnome Mage respectively.
---
You can always turtle and turn your normally quick AV into a 2-3hr game.
---
Sorry I did not mention that I was refering to Warlock. Thanks for your fast answer btw :)
---
Current retail AV commonly takes 1.5 hours because both teams choose to play defensively. Fastest for both teams would be to rush but no one does that anymore.
---
You can't take the boss with 10 pugs. 
---
It was not a "fake" version of classic, it was just very early stages of the classic we will get.
---
But Blizzard has already confirmed during Blizzcon that wall jumping will NOT be a thing in classic, it has something to do with their modern anti-cheat system being a part of the new engine.. hence can't be removed.
---
Well, this is before the Japanese invasion which knocked off the top of the bank and a few other things. Really the wing of death, also known by the Japanese Zero Plane changed a ton about the world as we know it. Happy we can go back to simpler times like these though. 
---
The feeling of love towards your own child really is remarkable. I was always give-or-take about having kids my whole life, but I knew since high school that my wife lives to have kids. She wanted them right after we graduated, but we ended up waiting until we were in our mid/late 20s to really try (which imo was a good decision). The instant he was born it washed over me, it's  like that feeling you get after a really good day with your SO, but constant and for no apparent reason. 
---
I agree, the shimmering flats; while visually boring and rather large (especially at that level where most people don't have a mount yet)  was so good at quest stacking.  
---
Mentality of players is caused by responding to incentives. AV has great gear if you make it to exalted. You can speed up getting to exalted by speeding up matches. You can speed up matches by zerging.
---
Reinforcements don’t cause zerging. Reinforcements prevent turtling for too long. A vast majority of AV games in retail do not end due to reinforcements running out. 
---
1.12 AV doesn’t *cause* zerging; it enables it. When it is enabled, players will do it. It’s the fastest way to get those sweet sweet purples. It won’t happen all of the time, of course, and maybe you’ll see periods of time where the meta changes back and forth. I would predict that once a good portion of min-maxers get their rep, they won’t step foot back in AV, which will increase the % of people who don’t zerg it. But even then, the battle simply won’t be epic on the same scale.
---
Warrior was my first character and I managed to make it to level 23 with only Rank 1 Heroic strike, I imagine if you know what you're doing it probably isn't that tough.

if you are interested in warlock leveling tips, maybe this helps.
---
[Warlock leveling guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyLGKxlSsns)
---
Kargoz has leveling guides for all classes and they are pretty good.
---
It's hard if you expect to be able to charge into everything and completely ignore what's happening around you. You can't really deal with multiple mobs until you get sweeping strikes.
---
At low levels I almost always pull everything with a bow because extra rage doesn't help if you pull too much and are going to die anyways.
---
It's also rough as a warrior cause if anyone gets the jump on you you're severely gimped in pvp while leveling, the exception is momentary power spikes like whirlwind axe and mortal strike, but even then, good luck dealing with a mage who decides to frostbolt you while you're in combat already, doesn't even matter if you have intercept.
---
I don't think leveling a warrior is hard, like you said, it's slower, but the people who say it's hard just aren't playing smart, then they'll throw in the glancing blow / miss / dodge / parry shit to make it seem like you're NEVER hitting anything ever and always get 5-6 attacks missed in a row, when in reality doesn't happen often and can be offset by hamstringing the mob and staying out of its attack range while your swing timer resets.
---
Rogue is not worse... leveling a rogue was shit ez, it all comes down to how you play the game really, impatient and just charging headless into battle = sure its hard for any melee except maybe Druid
---
I find Felwood is the worst zone to travel alone in on a PvP server.  If you think about it, you have a very narrow road that traverses the entire zone; there are really not many other alternatives.  Lots of hills/mountains that block would-be potential alternate routes in the zone.  It's extremely easy to get ganked.  Especially around that bridge in the middle the zone (the bridge near the laze with all the oozes).  That's like the easiest place to camp people for pvp kills.  Especially people not paying full attention and just /autorun through the zone.
---
agreed, I think warriors become really damn fun to level once you get whirlwind axe / sweeping strikes. From there you just gotta keep your weapon up to date with instance drops (which is slow and can suck sometimes) but you're gold.
---
quel sirar :D

The topmost comment in the latter is pretty telling, as is your reply. You seem determined to be upset and make wide generalizations about people regardless of how many times people try to clear things up for you. I'm not going to waste my time since so many have done it.
---
This might be the least good faith argument I've seen on this issue, well done.
---
U.K. Although it was probably because I wasn't interested in learning back then and the teachers wouldn't engage in my preferred learning methods. (I now have a degree and a good job).
---
You will be able to find other players with the same constraints as you. There will be plenty of raid pugging happening too especially later into the content. As another poster mentioned, R10 is fairly achievable especially if 90% of your in game time is BGs. Eventually you will get the exalted BG rewards which are quite good. Mages, priests, and druids can all do fine in blues. Those classes will also be easy to get 5 man group spots. 
---
It's just about incentives. If the goal is 20 min zergs, then leave it. If the goal is a 2 hour slugfest, then rejigger the incentives.
---
This might sound silly, but this simple screenshot just inflamed an immense desire to play classic in me. There are just so many good memories goofing around with friends in the early level alliance zones, when the journey just started and everyone is getting into their toons more and more... Man I can't wait!
---
Except you're using charge, which generally isn't very good.
---
I mean he directly cross posted it from the OP/maker so.... yeah. Feel like he's given due credit. 
---
Thanks for your answer. I though you would change any point of the current guides. 
---
Do you recommend also mining/skining for warlock? Then mining/eng for pvp?
---
alliance
---
don't know why you're downvoted, they are insanely OP and trivialize the 51-60 grind
---
**Hardcore Server** \-  No addons allowed while playing here.  :P
---
I actually agree with you. IBS and the other quest rewards were insanely powerful items gifted to lvl 51s that totally trivialize the grind to 60. 
---
The Burning Steppes really are majestic...
---
Whirlwind axe really kicks things up a notch.
---
Ofc you can and if theres enough of "people who like playing AV" im sure thats what will happen in certain games.
---
The mana drain dont work when they are in bear/cat and they can remove it.
---
There is no real need to change them. Classic is not a new and mysterious expansion.
---
people are already playing it for years and did optimize it.
---
if you want to make gold solely  while leveling then go two gathering professions. as you like.
---
for pvp eng is great with all those gadgets. if you have mining you can farm the mats yourself. if not, you have to buy it :) it's as simple as that.
---
It's a modern retail client, so many bugs &amp; exploits have been fixed.
---
Exactly this. I don't care about the rewards from AV. I have no issue leaving if I need to without getting a mark even if I've been fighting for hours because AVis just fun. You have wsg to farm out honour but no way to get the AV epics just fucking give them a box to open or shit. 
---
Cartographer saved ore / herb locations and TomTom was definitely a thing, there will be an addon similar to “routes” and plenty of routes already exist online for gathering.
---
The other trick is to macro both tracking abilities and constantly rotate between the two. 
---
I had Screenshots of my characters sitting in every lorry I could find (was a miner).
---
Does Alliance dominate the private servers these days? I'm surprised. I probably would have guessed Horde.
---
So raids take maybe 3-4 hunters, meaning less spots. Raids take 6-8 shamans, more raid spots. You'll have twice as hard of a time getting gear as a shaman than a hunter. I think playing with a druid will make it easier to get a raid spot as a hunter since druids are usually harder to come by at 60. The synergy of druid and hunter is really good. Go hunter. 
---
Exactly! everyone gets to enjoy and play what they want.  Currently, everyone is forced to do one thing... Which sucks.  And yes, FORCED.

Facts are facts it has nothing to do with bias, i play both rogue and warrior and any of the top players would have a mutual opinion with me on this
---
Paladin is the slowest class its not even close, and grinding effienctly speeds up leveling a lot 9 mobs every 2 min + eat to full, i dont think you comprehend how fast that is
---
Well shit. I liked this keyboard...
---
I didn't say anything about armor you replied to the wrong person you want 1 post up 
---
That would be Paladin, keep the downvotes coming drown in your ignorance not my problem. 
---
A distinct sound and ambience in Loch Modan, then I realized Elwynn and similar zones share the music and it was less epic :(

They have a pre-2.4.3 guide archived btw

This was the equivalent to Joanas back in the day btw
---
I'm really looking to do a bit of everything casually.  I don't need to be the very best or be decked out in sweet purps.  I just worry I'll get to 60 and have to go full resto to get a group for 5 mans.
---
Priests. No guild has enough priests, ever.
---
Yeah, even when I'm not on a tank I generally do the same. All jokes aside, they just don't bring anything to the table. No CC, buffs (tank probably has Shout...), off heals, off res, pets or summons. Always just going to be lowest priority. Think a lot of folks are in for a rough surprise.
---
25% slower does translates to like an extra 48-72 hours though.
---
Don't interrupt a troll gang bang, but really you can handle running from 5 mobs as long as hey don't have CC, 5 hamstrings and avoid getting dazed you'll definitely have the rage for it if you're getting smacked up
---
You don’t need to spec prot to actually tank though.
---
Dont think the amound of players will have an infuence in progression. 
---
I'm unaware of the exact cycle AV went trough. They specifically mention that player drops are gone. I don't see anything about flesh, hides, bloods etc. Were they still in in 1.12? 
---
You might want to not say 'have you ever even played' and then proceed to interpret everything i said completey wrong 
---
I don't think they would AFK out if there is a even bigger reward if they win the match.
---
So a nice reward if they get an objective and a much nicer additional reward if they win.  And a very small or no additional reward if they lose.
---
But like others mentioned, #changes kills that idea.  Maybe later on in a post #6 content release...(no bc)
---
Ah yes, that undead edge

I used to live there for a while. My childhood life wasn’t easy - I learnt to hate, to be angry. I got ganked so many times.  I learnt only how to survive day to day and moved out of Strangehorn at the level of 45. 
---
Then why does everyone fight in the middle of wsg?
---
Warrior was my first to 60 and I just didn't know any better. I was so blown away by the whole game that it could have taken twice as long and I probably would have still had a blast.
---
With that said, it's pretty rugged whenever you need to go at it solo. I can't honestly say I'd make it a second time around. 
---
My best advice to any newbies trying out Vanilla for the first time is to tank a LOT of dungeons. No, it's not the most efficient way to level in terms of XP/hour, but you'll have way, way, way more fun. Figuring out new dungeons with groups of pugs and getting to the point where you're just plowing through content like a group of ninjas is good times.
---
I leveled 1 warrior in vanilla, and 1 in TBC. I fully believe its the slowest class, but Priest felt worse to me just because of how repetitive it was. Dots, low damage abilities, wanding, next mob....at least with Warrior you can get big crits, overpower procs, other RNG to change things up. And getting new gear is way more impactful than on any other class. 
---
omg this is so amazing!! definitely gonna download it for my sims 
---
Ah cool. Thats awesome :)
---
I was about to tell you how you were wrong then I read your post. 10/10 clickbait bro.
---
Love your vids frost! 
---
Keep in mind that most players won't get fully purpled out.  I suspect that most people playing classic will be in the same boat as you.  I may end up with 2 or 3 epics eventually, but I will be content with blues.  There's going to be a lot of people just playing classic to level slowly, and build a character that will not have a gear reset every 6 months when the next tier of content is released.   I love the thought of not playing for 10 years, and coming back to a character that is still as powerful as when I left off.  
---
Exactly.  Defense means nothing against casters (right?).  Also didn't this change in BC?  I remember tanking as a horde paladin and once you got defense capped, your secondary goals (as a paladin tank) were improving your HP&gt;Spellpower&gt;Mp5 in that order.
---
First toon and main for all of vanilla through wrath was warrior. I didn't find it hard to level, but I certainly did resort to the "run through every mob and die on my objective, rez and get my objective before death running back out" several times. My second toon to level was a mage. I don't think I ever had to do that on the mage, granted, i knew more of what to do, but the mage was so much more powerful as they leveled than the warrior was. 
---
The delay was likely due to lag, the same type of lag that causes spells to hit you in ghost form that were in mid-air when you died.
---
It would be great if snowballs are still a thing in classic.
---
Still really bothers me. 
---
Druid killing power is mostly kiting and using dots. Feral can get kills yes, but the resto tree tends to be better for 1v1 or 1v2.
---
Solution is to increase the marks rewarded based on a pvp related metric.
---
I mean I'm going by experience. On a certain server that shall not be named they added an honor and rep bonus after 60 minutes.
---
Premades steamrolled all objectives, then camped the other team at the tunnel until the 60 minute mark and then won the game at exactly 60 minutes and a few seconds. Not sure this is the kind of game you're looking for.
---
Yes, very fortunate to have this setup. I am a firm believer that the morale boost you get from your employees by offering things like this more than makes up for the lost billable time.
---
A good rdrood is really hard to kill, while a priest with 2-3 people on him will die 
---
Of course you can't charge in combat when did i ever say you could, as for kiting you can kite in a small circle its not hard, you don't need a lot of space
---
You'll use at most 2 Hamstrings on the the first mob you're kiting, really you shouldn't need to as you can kite without Hamstring if the first wears off. That's 10 (20) rage you're using and what 5-8 auto swings? Including the few times the mob gets to hit you back you'll have over 50 rage. 
---
You're right about AM it is what makes this work so well, passive rage increase and you'll be able to hold your rage pool for longer as make your way towards the next mob, you should start kiting it the direction of the next mob once your target gets low so u can hold the majority of your rage.
---
Yes the difficulty in getting out of bad situations is what makes warrior hard to level usually a mistake means you die, however hamstringing mobs while kiting back can usually save you but its not fool proof
---
I remember running Scholo with some people who were focused on farming Gandling for the T0 headpiece because they wanted to app to a guild running MC.
---
A lot of Blue items just had stats on them when the game first came out. Not sure if that was by design, or whether they were saving the good stuff like +SP and +Hit for later.
---
Engineering is the cheapest profession in the whole game to level. So it is super easy. Especially with herb being one of the most profitable ones id suggest leveling an at to at least 35 for alch so you can do transmutes as well
---
Scare beast all the way.
---
But how does that let you have exalted with both Bloodsail and Goblins?
---
In AV they do the bridge is very hard to beat if you have a half decent premade. Horde have what 3 ways you can get in and around defenders, While getting past the 2 towers and that narrow corridor is brutal, Horde don't have a solid spot to defend from while being safe where as the attacking alliance can hide in the hut while AoEing down the horde defenders and picking of weaker defenders and not getting shot by Archers.
---
Alliance on the other hand ( with the changes to reduced NPC health ) can sit back in the open area near the start of the bridge and slow the attackers while the horde have to push through the defenders + archers not to mention being able to be MC'd off the bridge to your death with a single dot on you.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtJUfxjAYgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtJUfxjAYgM) Didn't think there would actually be a video of it, but that is the only safe way into the Alliance base where you don't get pillaged by archers however it is highly likely Horde will not be able to do this meaning they have to fight through the bridge and if the premade is actually using defenders and not zerging the boss.
---
I know we said #nochanges
---
Soul Harvester wins out via Rule of Cool.
---
I think there used to be an addon that would actually cycle thru the detects quite quickly, giving you a "sonar" type detect everything where blips would appear on your minimap
---
I don't know why people are whining about this version of AV. I remember even in BC and possibly WOTLK that people would zerg it. Kill Balina and then kill boss and it's over. Not everyone was like that of course but it was a standard method for a while. If you want to slow people down though, just stay on defense. It wasn't hard to have a turtle PvP fest battle, you just had to have a team willing to go against the rush meta, but actually executing that strategy wasn't hard if you have enough people on D.
---
That's not the point. There is, except the annoyance of having to spam a channel, little to no difference to a groupbrowser.
---
I never experienced original AV but even during BC I did encounter battles that lasted 2-3 hours. I still had fun. I do admit that the old one sounds better on paper.
---
Eww gross.
---
Sounds hot.
---
Weapon will be replaced if you plan on raiding. If you don't plan on replacing it, then by all means, take it. Min-Max'ers will want the trinket.
---
I considering Not taking the trinket, am I a baddie?
---
I remember wall jumping in Karazhan, so it was possible at least into BC.
---
Ofc. Let the employees work maybe a bit less but those hours are of quality instead of keep them almost captive.
---
The trinket is good because you can use it forever for a free soul shard.  Summon the VW, tell it to stay, run away, when it despawns you'll get a shard.  It's nice to supplement your stocks in later game.
---
If you don't play a fire mage for PvP :D
---
If NPCs can do it, so should we.

I'm expecting them to do nothing and slowly watch the people that resubbed to play classic stop playing as they begin to have nothing left to do in the game.  That sounds like something a company in this to make money would do to me.

Blizzard is known to change game design based on the desires of noisy forum posters, instead of objectively keeping the game where it's fun for everyone.
---
The nice thing about pservers is that they can recreate game features that were previously removed and give that experience to modern audiences. It's great that we are able to have these discussions with the benefit of more knowledge &amp; experience with the game.
---
I feel like a lot of pserver quest drops are very very generous, like they were maybe 10% drop chance on retail and up to 50-75% drop chance on pserver.
---
Vexing vane from ZF rly isnt that far behind, and Rod of the Ogre Magi either. Plus that quest is only available in a rather late patch in game. The trinket just makes more sense to take unless you dont wanna raid.
---
Trinket is definitely better in the long run. But man, I have a really hard time passing up Hit at that stage of the game...
---
I think you underestimate the sheer number of new players or people who started playing in much later xpacs, pserver players are mostly college aged
---
Yeah I was definitely aware spell power was the priority stat, even early on. Anyone in Vanilla who wasn't aware was definitely on the noobish end of the spectrum (which is totally fine, but not representative of the entire population). 
---
The game hadn't been theorycrafted 100% to death, and nobody was following precise BiS lists or looking for SP greens, but if a nice blue piece with spell power/crit dropped, people were ALL over that. 
---
Vanilla is responsible for 8 million subscribers. 
---
Burning Crusade is responsible for 3 million. 
---
Wrath is responsible for one million. Wrath completely stagnated the subscriber count until the very end, when Cataclysm was announced and boosted the numbers up a bit. In fact, Wrath of the Lich King was the only point before Cataclysm where the game LOST subscribers.
---
Vanilla was the most successful era of the game, undoubtedly.
---

I think the problem with that is that the bonus is added after 60min of play time.  After playing for 60 minutes you kind of already know which team is better or maybe you have bunch of whiners on your team and so there is a high probability people will give up and leave.
---
On the other hand, team morale will be high If people on both sides went after objectives as a team and get their bonus reward and then they can storm the boss and win or lose.
---
Hey I am all for Min/Maxing, I under stand it will get replaced, but how soon and with what. 
---
Where is the trinket used in a dire situation, as I think its for all pets, correct me if Im wrong 
---
EPGP or DKP, **but** with Loot Council / Class Lead oversight.
---
Certain items are too influential to be decided by whatever goof happens to have the most points that week.  Guild Leadership has a responsibility to make clear what those items are and who they are intended for, though.

I level dual weild and i know already people are going to flame me in this sub reddit so feel free to not it had happened before on many other posts. Cause WhY u No UsE 2HaNdEr or U nOt HaVe Enough HiT. But no one has hit while leveling right? So i rock an arms fury build with dual wells because missing with a generally 2.4 or fast weapon in way better than missing with that 3.6-3.8 speed. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxdZVxzuhxRVo is my build I use.
---
The reasons it is good are as followed. 
---
1. Your abilities are going to get dodged a lot so improved over power and tactical mastery are some of the best talents in the game. You start in the arms tree so that you get them early. 
---
2. Improved demoshout and blood craze because you are going to get crit a lot while leveling and having the slight hp regen is nice as well as having the attack power reduction on mobs.
---
3. Use rend on charge. So charge demo on your way in and rend. Most people will argue that the dmg to rage coefficient isn't worth it. Well while leveling it actually is the mobs (green and yellow leveled) will generally die in the time rend runs out. So it'll be actually worth it.
---
4. It makes tanking a lot easier in dungeons with these talents because you are already leveled up one handers. 
---
Tldr fuck the haters play dw fury leveling.
---
During retail Vanilla I was in one of the top two guilds on our server, and among the best/highest rank PvPers, and yet looking back I was an incredible noob. Such a noob it's unbelievable.
---
But the internet culture wasn't the same back then. Now it's completely standard to look things up, read guides, etc. Back then there were still paper magazine guides... I know there was thottbot which I used, but the mentality just wasn't the same.
---
People didn't expect to go on the internet and gain huge amounts of knowledge. It was a different time.
---
The problem with T0.5 is that it's not going to be available until a year after launch.
---
I with you, Like every warlock wants hit early on. Well Harvester is the solution until something significantly better comes forth. What Pre-Bis beats the hit%
---
I ran a dedicated small core raid with very frequent pug slots mostly for dps and based loot on Suicide Kings but using a point system mod (forget which) to track ranks based on points earned rather than just list position. Gave 5 points per wipe and 15 per kill to everyone, then when you Suicide it split all your points among everyone in the raid. Encouraged wise suicides and participating, punished list campers who don't show up. It was less complicated than it sounds, the mod did all the work.
---
Pugs loved it, raiders loved it. Freeloaders hated it. Winner imo.
---
The only time I really see this sort of inexplicable attitude is when people argue *"No changes, no sharding,* ***no matter what!*** *Let the servers launch with 12k populations!"*
---
Keep your feet on the Earthmother
---
weirdly, the same for me
---
I leveled 2 to 60 on retail (one horde one alliance) and I never thought it was that bad at all tbh. It's a bit slower compared to other classes but not enough to justify the 'warrior leveling is soooooo horrible' meme. I was playing on PVE servers though which means I wasn't getting steamrolled every 5 minutes, it's a lot more miserable on PVP when you're leveling.
---
I actually thought getting a rogue to 60 was a lot more annoying even though they are considered to be a much better leveling class.
---
The only group I can see going hunter is people who start with a warrior or something, but realise it's hard as fuck leveling. 
---
Reposting with a less misleading title...
---
Are the r/ColorizedHistory style titles getting a little weird for anyone else?
---
Not a lock player, but after looking at the rewards I can't imagine a Demo lock player ever passing that trinket up.  It's freaking amazing.
---
No, it's not possible to criticize Blizzard for implementing 1.12 variations of content when 1.12 is the patch they are going with. Christ, get over yourself already.
---
It's not shit because it wasn't played, it's shit because of herbing, mining, and fishing.
---
Dont know why, but this picture gave me a huge nostalgia trip
---
The only thing I really care about are being able to loot Severed Night Elf Heads ( and to a lesser extent Dwarf Spines) but also being able to defend in AV with my Ele Shaman and rack up hundreds of killing blows over several hours while players complain ...
---
&gt;"STOP DEFENDING WE NEED REP, *REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE^EEEEEEEEEEEEEE^EEEEEEEEE*"
---
Blizzard took one of those away, but I'll be damned if I can't force an AV game to last 9 hours.
---
As others have said, no, and even if you could, there's a reason Blizzard came out with "the Insane" title in WotLK. Absolutely miserable grind for the more obscure factions!
---
Idk why they can't just compromise, how difficult would it be to make 2 AVs, one where you can Q up for 3 day long slugfests and one where you can Q up for a 20 minute zergfest
---
Like... sorry guys, I know I'm level 45 and we're all poisoned in ZF, but no... I don't have poison cleansing totem yet....

???
---
Rogues are without a doubt the best W-PvP class and also one of the better PvP classes. Hunters are alright, but I never had a problem with them in vanilla. Same with Warriors that people for some reason think is good vs Rogues.
---
I don’t have numbers but it felt like the most played class was Mage on recent pserver
---
You don't seem to get the point of the post. I am pointing out that I don't have as much time as I wish I had. An opportunity like this, to play Vanilla once again,  I thought I never would get. So releasing it made me sad in a way I can't do anything about. And I have to prioitize my Night elf less than I did back then.
---
How is this choosing poorly? 
---
I think you're spot on. I'm one of those who will never step foot in AV after I get my rep. Once the bulk of raiders have their rep, you'll find AV packed with PvPers who will want to fight other players. Not gonna lie, my AV strat is rush to cap a graveyard (2 if I'm very lucky), then zerg the general. If I've stopped to engage in any PvP along the road, I've slowed myself down and done something wrong.
---
That quest  becomes available in phase5. I mean in phase1 you cannot even do the dreadsteed quest.
---
Attack bound to 1, it checks out sir.
---
Just posting to circle back on my frustration with this! After letting my PC download WoW overnight at 1MB speeds (although my 150/150 easily supports 18 MB/s) I realized that the free trial only offers the starter experience, as AllyourCRYPTOS pointed out. So I can't in fact see my old characters unless I pay for a sub - I can only log in and make brand new characters. This is disappointing. 
---
What was more disappointing was logging in to a new hunter to find a pre-tamed pet, no mana bar, and the ability to get to level 3 in about 2 minutes. 
---
True, but because it's in melee it only needs 110% of the mage's threat to regain it back.
---
You will probably be able to see buffs in Classic with addons. Pretty sure it's even possible in some cases on private servers, I'm 99% sure I've seen videos where players have the "flee" buff from Skull on their opponent's nameplates 
---
Another thing I'm excited about is range addon/weak aura, would be awesome if we have a weak aura to tell us in real time the distance between you and your target. 
---
What most people mean when they talk about how hard it is to level warrior is that it is hard in comparison to... Well, every other class. 
---
No other class is as gear dependent while leveling (Rogue and Paladin probably come close). Every other class either has built in sustain (Healers, Mage, Locks) or better tools than warrior to avoid damage or conveniently exit a bad situation (Rogue with Vanish, Sprint, Evasion; Hunter with pet tank, traps, long range + kiting; Paladin with Divine Shield; Mage with Blink, Polymorph, Ice Block). Meanwhile Warrior only has Intimidating Shout on a long cd, Hamstring which is bad for escaping more than 1-2 enemies, and Piercing Howl (which admittedly is actually pretty strong imo). And to top it off, they have 0 mobility outside of Charge and Intercept, both of which require a target.
---
It's not as bad as people make it sound of course, and if you have nothing to compare it to then you don't really notice it. After leveling several other classes, I can really feel how warrior is more difficult but it's really not *that* bad.
---

&gt; The main win-condition in AV currently is through reinforcements, making it a complete PVE zergfest. 
---
Very few AVs I'm in ever end with reinforcements reaching 0 through any means but defeating Vann/Drek. Reinforcement wins are often a result of actual PVP/defense happening + tower caps. We were already PVE zerg-rushing before reinforcements in AV meta. The reinforcements only served to bring a secondary win condition if things turned into a PvP turtle. Reinforcements did not create that zerg-rush meta, it only put a cap on how long a match could go if people went against that meta. 
---
I'll certainly be the player trying to instigate players to defend, kill enemies before they cap GYs, and force a big PvP battle. I can't tell that to the other 39 people in the BG to do the same with any authority though, and a lot of people are more into rewards than fun. You need a decent chunk of people to get on board with you, if you want to do any real damage to an enemy's offense and force them back into their own base. 
---
You can only switch weapons during combat - everything else requires you to be out of combat.
---
Also, every on-use trinket gets a 30 second cooldown when equipped. Trinkets with passive effects apply immediately.
---
Yeah, this is the REALISTIC number. Private servers population x 10.
---
Over 90% of the players that would love to play Vanilla refuse to play on private servers. For every single private server player there are 9 that will play Classic on Blizzard's servers.
---
Classic will see around 10 million players at launch.
---
It’s still a choice. You choose Alliance or Horde for your race, but the differences between the two are minimal.
---
No. And it wasn't possible in TBC either. If you get out of combat then you can swap trinkets and will be able to use them after a thirty second cooldown.
---
Haha, I'll ask my wife
---
I think a lot more people will play Classic than private servers. There is the monthly fee which will put some people off, but a lot more will come due to the "official" nature, lack of risk, and ease of access. It's like pirating vs. Steam.
---
Most of us couldn't play a 48hr AV back then either, but that wasn't the point. The point was that there were these epic battles raging that we could possibly return to. I can start an AV on a Monday evening, go to bed, go to work, then come back and possibly see the same one going. That still fits my adult life, and it's cool. 
---
You're talking to someone who healed all the way through Naxx and hit 5th overall server-wide for healing on patchwerx.
---
I know all about downranking.
---
I'd play it. 
---
But unfortunately Blizzard seems to like to remaster and rerelease stuff they have already made. Which is fine, I guess, since I love most if their older content. 
---
I would be fantastic to actually get a brand new never before seen 2019 game from them with all the bells and whistles. 
---
Well if they inserted a bunch of stuff to do to essentially lay siege to the other base, buff NPCs, summon raid bosses, does it feel like the intended strategy is to skip all that? 
---
BfA had WHAT? 10 million at launch? Dude...it was bellow 4 million. Clearly BELLOW WoD numbers (5.5 million). And since WoD more players quit than joined.
---
BfA launched with 4...maybe, MAYBE 5 million players.Easily half of them stopped. 
---
The MOST optimistic sub numbers for BfA are 2 million.
---
Just remember you can't use your mount on the docks even though it's outside....

---
abyssal shard
---
The point is that there's a balance to be struck. You need a certain amount of health. Most bosses after MC/BWL were designed to do raid-wide damage, even when everyone is doing their job perfectly.
---
&gt;will not want competition for gear.
---
From below level 50, sure.  Once you reach level 50+ gear stats to divide, and barring "generic" plate stat sticks such as "&lt;X&gt; Of the Bear"; gear is very clearly "tank" or "DPS" gear.  (i.e. tanks will be looking for defense/resist/stamina based gear; while dps will be looking for hit/crit/strength based gear)
---
The only reason a warrior would want another warrior not in the party is if they plan on rolling for off-spec items.  And if we are honest with ourselves that's selfish.
---
That being said, I don't disagree that many people will avoid "class duplication" in dungeons to prevent having more competition for gear.  The only classes that have to worry about pure duplication of gear competition between main specs are all "pure" role classes (mage, warlock, hunter, rogue)
---
No, unfortunately not

I feel like you are comparing a lot of things that aren't fair to compare.
---
&gt;Vanilla is responsible for 8 million subscribers. Burning Crusade is responsible for 3 million. Wrath is responsible for one million.
---
Vanilla was the most successful era of the game, undoubtedly. Rapid, massive growth, giant spikes in subscriber count. Burning Crusade slowed the growth considerably before Wrath stagnated it.
---
Of course vanilla had the largest amount of growth, it was a new game that just hit the market. you cant expect an expansion to pull in the same numbers as the game when it first hit the market.  WoW already had 8 million subs, TBC was not going to just make 8 million more people grow out of thin air.  The fact that it pulled in another 3 million is still amazing because that meant it kept the original 8 million in addition.  Wrath did stagnate yes, and loss players yes, but that's just what happens when a game is 6-8 years old like that.  Wrath did introduce a few systems people disliked,  but saying that wrath is the sole reason the game went into decline is just wrong.  Times change, the market changes, people move on from a game they have been playing for 5 or 6 years.  
---
You liked Vanilla, thats cool and fine, but a majority of people would agree that TBC was still the best simply due to taking Vanilla and improving on it.
---
&gt; I think the target population will be a subset of people who originally played in vanilla and BC, when the game was far less popular 
---
This is the most stupidest thing that could ever be said. WoW was most popular during Vanilla and TBC.
---
As for the "subset" of people...that "subset" is about 10 times bigger than current BfA. That "subset" was over 40 MILLION people.
---
Add in Wrath, and the "subset" is close to 80 MILLION people.
---
Today's VR sucks ass though, imagine spending 5+ hours in PvP while wearing a VR headset. No thanks, I like my brain as it is. We'll see if VR tech improves until then I guess.
---
If Blizzard actually develops "WoW2", then yeah it will 100% be multiplatform since everything is about profits these days. That's why I think the next MMORPG they create will fail, they will base parts of the game to guarantee a system where microtransactions can keep making solid profits throughout the years. World of Warcraft was created out of PURE passion, WoW2 would be created almost fully out of profitable reasons.
---
They were. By far. They are 20%+ of the level 60 population. 1 in 5 characters are mages on private servers.
---
From some reason thought it was available earlier 
---
Private server vanilla wow pop is mostly males aged 25-36
---
Warlock, but acquiring those tools is actually fairly challenging IIRC. Summon Infernals and Doomguards that are hostile to everyone, then don't use Bind Demon (or whatever the spell was called). I'm pretty sure that Ritual of Doom was a rare drop from the elite Doomguards in thr Blasted Lands, near where Lord Kazzak spawns.
---
I thought you were joking ...
---
My wife has always been an early bird, and goes to sleep with the sun. During the winter, there would be times its 530, pitch black, and she's zonked for the night. Now, she goes to bed when the kid does so any night is gaming time. Its the little lottery wins that matter. 
---
thought it was available earlier, saw a spreadsheet that it was available during phase 1
---
Is it possible to get r10 gear with 10-16 hours a week at most? (10 hours is most likely since I can only play on weekends.)
---
literally a repost from two weeks or something ???
---
Alright, sure. Let's talk about your argument then. Your claim was that game developers don't provide a service to society, and that due to that, they shouldn't receive compensation for their work. Can you provide any evidence to back up such a claim? And in the event that you actually can provide evidence, can you explain your reasoning for why that should exclude them from receiving compensation?
---
Thanks, good luck.
---
Why can you still earn XP at lvl 60?
---
1.12 was the patch after Naxx release, so how could you make a case that Crossrealm BGs or 1.12 AV have anything to do with Naxx? They’re unrelated content and content that came after.
---
ok, thanks. I was just misrememberig weapons!
---
I think a lot of Classic skeptics will get hooked against their expectations. We're not all just crazy, nostalgic masochists. There's some pretty deep psychological reasons why Vanilla WoW was so addictive that are no longer present in the retail game. 
---
People in the majority will always take the path of least resistance. If Blizzard added fast-traveling Skyrim style they'd all do that too. It doesn't make it good game design to allow it or make  it easy though. If the design of the BG is to have people to push through bases in some semblance of a sequential order, not just run past the first part to the end, then they need to create sufficient obstacles to just skipping past the first towers and back-capping them later. 
---
&gt; Certain items are too influential to be grabbed up by whatever goof happens to have the most points that week.
---
Completely agree with this statement.  I was in a Loot Council guild and I really liked it.  However they have a lot more room for abuse so you need to make sure your officers are honest and fair.  But I'm in the boat of all Thunderfurys should go to tanks to benefit the raid overall.
---
Why not just shower/do your chores the night before? I just have to wake up with enough time to get dressed and leave, and 99% of the time im out before 6
---
Should also add that between 1.12 and retail they downgraded mobs from elite to normal (a big deal in Vanilla)  reduced their health/damage even more and removed lieutenants from towers/bunkers.
---
The argument of convenience and time restraints are flawed as that is what lead to retail philosophy.
---
I can accept 1.12 based on them wanting not mess with the original code from 1.12.
---
The older AV will make it easier to turtle and stall games but players will still take the path of least resistance in the long run and that means a lot of games will be sub 30 minutes. 1.5 or 1.12.
---
If you know how to pull (and how to keep one mob following you while you reset the others if you multipull by mistake), you probably won't die a lot to mobs even as a warrior. Caves can be dangerous because of respawn. You still need to stop for regen more than other classes. Missing hits is a bigger problem for you than for any other class because you hit slowly, you need to hit to generate rage, and unlike rogues you don't have an easy +5% hit during leveling, unlike enh shamans or pallies you don't have spells or heals, unlike hunter you don't have a personal tank and reduced missed chance/glancing blows with range weapons. You also don't have any movement speed increase. And you will get farmed by most people with a brain unless you keep your weapon updated/take engi and potions/play aggressive cause you need to get the Charge off or you're done. 
---
With regards to 5-man dungeons specifically, Warriors that are tanking will want all gear that benefits either their tank set or their dps/pvp sets. Is it selfish? Maybe, but its possible they're focus is PvP or DPS but are forced into tanking 5-mans to get groups faster. The main point is that a Warrior who refuses to tank will have a tough time finding a group, just like a druid/shaman/priest/paladin who refuse to heal.
---
Demographics change.
---
Wall jumping was fixed in late vanilla.
---
And if you agree with blizzard than you're a retail scrub that wants to ruin classic.
---
It works both ways
---
I think my issue is still that there are these people who have this expectation of a fast match, so they hang around for a while bitching that we triggered a turtle match (as do people who enter the BG expecting their quick farm match). It's sort of like raiding MC with people who don't like raiding at all, and they just sit in chat bitching about the core aspects of raiding. "Ugh, I can't believe you're  making me actually participate in this boss fight!" It just dampens everyone else's enjoyment, and likely those guys are doing the bare minimum to get by instead of doing their best to contribute. 
---
Yeah, but classic will be release on an early patch right?
---
But I hear the main consensus is no as the client itself has been upgraded
---
someone make a better visualization of data please.
---
Heh, I never knew they had a use in raids. Maybe that is why they removed the knockdown effect at some point.
---
I love this kind of chaos.
---
Most people: "OMG it's killing everything. Stop it!"
---
Me: "Holy shit this is AWESOME!"
---
Most people: "No it's not."
---
The 7 words everyone knows that are true, even if some (BfA drones) still hope it's not going to be true.
---
But it will be true.
---
This quest opens up in 1.10 so it’s likely not available until far later.
---
This is why people recommend the trinket generally
---
Thanks for the input. What is the synergy between hunter and druid exactly?
---
Any healing class can kite a Diseased Bear from the Bulwark to Brill. I still have a screenshot somewhere. :)
---
Because nobody plays it.
---
The ripe age of level 45, ah. Good times. 
---
I think it will initially have a bigger player-base that retail wow in terms of concurrent users. I think Blizzard are seriously seriously underestimating how many (new) retail players that we're assuming will be brief tourists will get hooked. I have a friend who's never played classic (he's much younger than I am) who is trying a private server out of curiosity. He's already said he's abandoned retail now and is waiting for classic. 
---
Its a bit of a catch 22. If they release them and dont say what their removal plan is (if any) then people will undoubtedly rush them, possibly for no reason (in the event they dont remove). They will definitely be rushed if they say there is a set removal date.
---
Personally, I dont care what they do. The newer mounts move just as fast. I am not hardcore no changes either.
---
Depends how you level too.  If you do a pure leveling build for DPS its not bad at all. Level  with a hybrid prot build so you are acceptable in 40ish to 55 dungeons with a pug group is another ball of wax. Also depends on your leveling strategy. If you are trying to speed level without running instances then you will hit some hard bumps but if you run every instance like 3 or 4 times and then quest in areas where you are a level or two ahead of the mobs in the zone its much more manageable.  There are some gaps in the quests that need to be filled with grinding or running instances or you stall.
---
I think everyone could tell stories of how hard their first toon was to level in vanilla when they didn't know the game mechanics and pulling strategies.  
---
So the idea that in 1.12 you could zerg down the final boss in 4 minutes isn’t even true?
---
Aaaah that's the stuff 
---
Did you REALLY just put retail WoW and Fortnite in the same league???
---
Classic won't eclipse Fortnite, but retail WoW? It will, for sure.
---
I can’t wait for VR to die like 3D
---
Playing alliance, Im pretty stuck between warlock and warrior. I really enjoy solo world pvp and doing things like grinding questing gold making etc on my own. But I love tanking and I very much enjoy the warrior playstyle in pve. Im just concerned about how much a warrior can really do on his own/ If im going to be forced to play with people. Obviously leaning towards warrior, just dont know about the solo play aspect.
---
I'll take my Mind Control and a cliff over anything else.
---
Anything but loot council.
---
I’d rather /roll.
---
That's ok, as I was replying to a guy who mentioned that Classic would need new content to overtake retail. The main perk of Burning Crusade was the fact that almost all specs were viable (definitely moreso than vanilla), but this can be done through changes to vanilla itself. They could adopt a different version of the BC talents or make new ones in a similar style and accomplish the same thing. If Classic moves to TBC, it's the nail in the coffin for any future content to vanilla, which is a wasted opportunity - they aren't going to add content to vanilla with BC and Wrath servers out there.
---
Yeah but that takes time and effort ti get to.
---
What exactly does Korrak add to the game though? 
---
From recent experience on a pserver Loch Modan has a CRAZY spike in difficulty that kinda forces you to Westfall or Darkshore and then leaves you without much incentive to ever come back. I think it jumps from being a nice transition to 11-12 to suddenly all your quests are orange / red and level 17+. By the time I was appropriately levelled Loch Modan was so freaking far away it just wasn't worth it!
---
Mechanics are not hard, when you have a counter for everything.
---
Mechanics in Vanilla were HARD...because almost nobody had any counters except fucking moving.
---
Not competition, but higher possible max stats for already full dps classes like war/mage/rogue. If you added more gearing options for lets say enhancement shamans, warriors could possibly use it if it was better than their gearing options. 
---
That one is new to me, what lvl was the bear? Like 22?
---
A lot of those guides are based on private server behaviour that allows you to /sit to proc enrage. I still haven't found a definitive answer on what is better with actual vanilla like behaviour.
---
I'm planning to level arms though. Anger management helps going mob to mob, frequent overpower crits are fun and make you feel more punchy before you get your level 40 instant attack. Major downside IMO is choosing a weapon specialization and feeling pigeon holed into sticking with that type.
---
Modified SK for tier. DKP auctions for everything else. 
---
How our guild does it: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvxIyPAx-_yIjXuLEBGI5BxzxvefArzgfvGGRYRI96E). 
---
People are running out of old screenshots/private server imitation screenshots apparently :P
---
Goldshire LOL so unnecessary 
---
Priests and shamans can purge world buffs like DM:N buffs and Songflower Serenade
---
Loot council is the only thing worth considering if playing with a hardcore group of people that understand what it's all about. 
---
For ZG/AQ20/MC/BWL PUG runs I have a soft reserve +1 system.
---
It would be a neat idea, after naxx, to implement horizontal progression instead of vertical one. Create new raids with cool armor sets to collect with same or similar (ilevel) as naxx but with various different stats and set bonuses that could augment different specs. 
---
Not in vanilla hunter can't. Unless with relative ease you mean using all cd's and trap and face tanking 3rd mob. Which leaves you without any hp/mana and no hp for pet. Hunter strength is grinding mob after mob without downtime and getting out of tricky situations not multi pulling.
---
I agree with you. I said it in the main thread, but the reinforcements are what really FORCE it to be a zergfest. Reinforcements operate as a timer for Horde to win, I don't think I've ever seen Alliance lose on reinforcements unless something really wonky happens. 
---
Without reinforcements Horde can effectively mount a defense.
---
I believe this was fixed in a later patch so this wont be available in 1.12.  I don't know exactly which patch though I just remember reading that somewhere this was fixed.
---
Patch 1.12 was an early or late patch?
---
Nah I totally love it! I think its hilarious.
---
If you are 6k HP unbuffed, you are a pretty geared tank. Dont run 440 Defense in a 5 man. You will take no damage, get no rage, and have no threat. 
---
No way classic even comes close to retail. It will be successful, maybe even enough for them to do BC eventually, but it won't be 5 million + or anywhere close.
---
Long term, when they stop making new expansions, for sure. It will be the version people still go back to 20 years from now.
---
Do you know if they used blizzard rates? I played on lh with 5-8k on 24/7 and dynamic respawns enabled and the war effort still took something like 5 or 6 weeks. 
---
Thanks for confirming.  In the past I was not a fan of the class, but having top of the line DPS, easy gold, portals, water and food, mana gems, and not having to respec for PvP sound incredibly attractive now.  
---
Those bears are lvl 50+
---
So back in the day, the XP bar didn't disappear when you hit 60. You just couldn't gain any more XP but you still had the bar.
---
I remember ironically enough i hit 60 and had like.. i wanna say 150 XP into 60... then 2 weeks later one of my good friends in my guild hit 60 and had like 200 XP into 60.. and i remember it being funny since he was "technically" a higher level than me.  :)
---
Yeah it's an interesting point and at least my memory is that Alliance always used to leave some people on the natural chokepoints. 
---
Apex Legends crushed Fortnite.
---
&gt; You must live in a bubble to think that **anything** could surpass Fortnite in the next two years 
---
And it was just months...not 2 years.
---
1.12 was the last major patch before TBC pre patch.
---
It's not supposed to be "real PvP", it's supposed to be Horde Vs Alliance.
---
That's not true man...
---
Plenty of people take non-heal shamans into dungeons for their totems alone.  Not to mention they have OOC rez, self-rez (wipe prevention), etc.  Same thing goes for Druids.  I'll take a druid for their battle-rez and their buffs, regardless of spec.   Paladin, same boat as shamans.  There for auras/buffs.  If they're willing to heal that's fine, but they have tons of tools at their disposal that make encounters (especially in undead dungeons) way easier/less stressful.  
---
As for priest, it's a mixed bag but honestly when it comes down to it, there will be plenty of people who have no problem playing a heal spec or hybrid spec and healing.
---
**You're welcome to curate your own experience of course**, but if you think every single warrior in game is going to be willing (or even good) at tanking (as someone who played tanks in multiple MMO's it's not an easy job to do well) ; or if you think hybrid classes are all required to heal... You're in for a rude awakening.
---
Especially if you think the aforementioned statements are going to apply to 5-mans.  
---
Okay cool thank you
---
No, but the wow community circa December 2004 didn't know that
---
Blizzard hasn't suggested that Sunken Temple quests are unavaible at lunch
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **4th Cakeday** -Mekkie-! ^(hug)
---
It was pretty good, probably best for alliance, since you could focus on other stats as well (crit, other trinkets, etc.)
---
My understanding is fury tanking is really only for the most hardcore guilds. Fury threat scales better than protection threat (based mostly on fixed modifiers) but is worse in earlier content - along with having more damage taken. It also relies on allowing yourself to take crits.
---
If you're in naxx and your DPS are world buffed sure, but for most guilds prot is the way to go.
---
I think classic will win IF they create new content within the bounds of a classic framework. No flying mounts, raid finders, etc. I think they will need at some point to cater to an ever changing attention span that keeps getting shorter. I think they could create new content that doesn't require as much time but not hurt the game I really do.
---
This is the answer.
---
Alliance choke points (that fucking bridge) were very easy to defend. A single spriest could hold off like 10 people. 
---
Honestly i started in tbc and I never felt like AV lacked a pvp element. 
---
They honestly sound like retail players that were arguing that classic shouldn't exist
---
A few of my thoughts:
---
1. Raiding in classic wow is a gajillion times more laid back than Destiny. in Destiny you are one of six guys, every one of which needs to be shooting the whole time you are trying to progress. In Classic WoW raids, my recollection was at least 3 people were afk at any given time and that was just a fact of life. SO I wouldn't say raiding is strictly out for ya. Most guilds will have such a hard time even putting 40 together in the first place they'll take you even knowing you'll be afk 1/3 of the time.
---
2. Finding groups is actually probably easier as dps than it is as the other roles. Since hybrids can do just about anything adequately for the levelling dungeons (I just shaman tanked everything thru 35 with almost no hiccups ... and could effectively dps and whatever too). If you wanna play a warlock, play the warlock! I really doubt it will have any serious impact on your group-finding ability
---
I used to play Warrior back in the day. Solo PVP is pretty hard until you get some decent gear. Once you have some gear, if you manage to get the upper hand you can wreck people with a bit of practice. Sole PvE warrior is also very good. My main way of farming gold was to solo low level instances. Because you are a plate wearer, you can take the damage and with cleave, you can kill multiple opponents at once. So you can gather large groups and kill them all at once. Again, warrior is gear dependent, but its also a fantastic class.
---
People will take the path of least known resistance. The fact of the matter is that AV isn't done for the sake of experiencing the bomb ass BG past the first time in the 1.12 state. Asking people to change their mentality to make the BG work in everyone's favor is not the answer...so what is? LET'S GO DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.  
---
Previous AV's combined a number of key factors that made it desirable to play from all perspectives. It was an epic battle for the first timer, plenty of skirmishes for the pvper who wants to scrap, plenty of quests and turn-ins for those that wanted to rep grind or contribute to the win outside of combat, and it provided a great way to push rank through good honor gains that required doing the bg in full to optimize.   
---
From the intel I've gathered though, the honor gains of earlier versions seems to be to high, which pigeon holed rankers into only being able to do AV if they wanted to push rank effectively, which is a problem. I think a slight tune can bring it on par with other bg's so that rankers can instead do weekend event bg's or a bg that fits their premade group comp without fear of losing ground because AV is just too good.  
---
Simply put, the solution is not to make it easy so that everyone can access it, its to make the rewards valuable for everyone no matter what reward they're looking for, be it fun or the grind, but not make it so meta that it becomes a must play chore.
---
Was fine til the Trainwreck of the mythic heroic suggestions. No.
---
3-6 months are you crazy? 
---
2 years minimum.
---
you'll be fine as druid.. They can heal a 5 (or 10) man just fine.   and once ZG/AQ20 is out those are mostly pugged anyway and shouldn't take a ton of time if you have an evening here or there to commit you can still get some raid gear.  Plus once DM comes out a lot of gear in there are really nice, for healers and feral.
---
IF you want to ensure you get a spot in a group quickly, you could feral tank too a 5 man no problem.  And be quite good at it.  You don't have a res but it's not a problem if no one dies :)  and if you have a shadow priest or ret / prot pally (which can also tank in 5 mans) then they can always res too.
---
I'm saying that because the concept of "just love playing a class/playstyle" has absolutely no place in minmaxers mentality. They only discuss "what's better? / what's best dps for x / what's the most profitable profession?".
---
To the point where in a sub like this you barely see "I just love playing that class/spec, no matter how it is the best or not the best".
---
And to me this is a consequence not of minmaxer per se, but of the fact that minmaxer want it to be spread out and mainstream.
---
When I "minmaxed" the few things I wanted to here and there in Vanilla, and that I saw someone that did not do the same, I didn't felt the right to tell them what to do unless help I was asked in private or /g.
---
OP, if you go druid you can get a lot of your BIS tank pieces without raiding and build an overall quality set for that role. Tanks are (I imagine) still going to be the most in-demand role for dungeons, so if you're able to tank this would let you get going with your runs even faster... and If you went HOTW spec you could also heal dungeons, so it'd be a 2-for-1.   
---
Example druid tank gear with no raiding:
---
Head - Bone Ring Helm OR Rank 10 head   
---
Neck - Amulet of the Darkmoon OR Rank 4 Neck (OR If you ever did BWL you could get the quest neckpiece which is second best druid tank neck in the game)  
---
Shoulders - Ab Exalted Shoulders are BIS-forever feral tank shoulders and you can get these just by farming AB rep on your own time, no premade needed  
---
Cloak - Rank 3 cape (Sergeant's Cape)  
---
Chest - Rank 8 PVP chest or Warbear Harness (Crafted)   
---
Bracers - Rank 5 Bracers (Sergeant Major's) OR the WSG exalted ones  
---
Hands - If you ever did LBRS you could get the Slaghide Gauntlets of the \_\_\_\_  which are high-end for a feral tank  
---
Waist - Lava Belt and Molten Belt are crafted and 2nd and 3rd BIS-belts respectively, and there's also the belt you get for being honored with AV, or the Belt of Preserved Heads (quest reward for doing ZG I think)  
---
Legs - WSG Exalted Legs are BIS druid tank legs in the game  
---
Feet - Ab revered boots are high-end druid tank boots  
---
Weapon - BIS druid tank weapon is Warden Staff which is a BOE, OR Unyielding Maul from DM North is 2nd best I think  
---
Ring - Ring of Protection (Quest Reward) + Don Julio's Band (AV Exalted) + Myrmidon's Signet (BOE) ... etc. Lots of options here  
---
Trinkets - BIS-forever trinket would be mark of tyranny (quest reward) + smoking heart of the mountain (enchanting-craftable)   
---
The above just being examples of course  
---
Mirroring this statement. Fury warriors do great DPS in raids, but they are most useful if they are willing to tank when it's needed. And as a tank I'd really rather not take a DPS warrior into dungeons with me. No utility and competes for gear. Tanks are scarce enough I can afford to be choosy with who I bring.
---
You missed the point I’m trying to make. I never said any of those classes HAVE to heal I said if they refuse to heal they will have a harder time finding groups. A warrior who refuses to learn to tank will similarly have a tough time finding groups. DPS are a dime a dozen and since most people will be focused on pre-raid BiS lists, if a group already has a Warrior tank he will likely not want another warrior in his group. 
---
The engine is what allowed wall jumping, and they're recreating vanilla mechanics in the new engine. It would be like someone remaking starcraft 1 in starcraft 2, it would look and feel like sc1, but on the back end it's still sc2. Any glitches you would see would be the same in sc2, not sc1.
---
Yup, used on Ragnaros / Ouro to lessen the knockback distance as well. 
---
This might sound silly, but this simple screenshot just inflamed an immense boner in me.  There are just so many good memories goofing around with friends in my early ages, when the journey just started and everyone is getting their boners more and more... Man I can't wait
---
Keep in mind that end game, hunters start to fall off VERY hard, because pets don't scale with gear. So as content comes out, hunters become less effective in comparison to other classes. Shammy on the other hand does not have this problem.
---
I think people just have different definitions of what it means for a video game to be "hard"
---
* Some people might tell you leveling a Warrior in Vanilla WoW is hard.  
---
* Some might tell you that Dark Souls is hard.  
---
* Some might tell you that getting 5-stars on "Through the Fire and Flames" in Guitar Hero 3 is hard.
---
All of those people are right, in their own way.  I think it's just a fault of using words that aren't specific enough.  In my opinion:
---
* Leveling a Warrior in Vanilla isn't hard, it's *tedious* or *slow*.  
---
* Dark Souls isn't hard, once you learn the game, but it is always very *punishing* of your mistakes.  
---
* 5-Starring Through the Fire and Flames is mechanically difficult, so I'd probably agree that this one is hard.
---
Once upon a time... I spent a lot of time killing goblins for a hat.
---
The issues with adding content without doing things like raising the level cap,  is that you go from having vertical growth, to basically just horizontal growth,  and it becomes extremely punishing for anyone that joins in late as they now have to find groups willing to run molten core, while everyone is on Naxx.  I really would like to see them add TBC, and Wrath without negating the older stuff, because those 2 xpacs added so much in terms of class balance and class gameplay (titans grip for warriors,  living bombs for mages,  the better debuff system that made warlocks, Spriest, and sin rogues viable). And im not sure how they add things like that without increasing level caps
---
There were certainly some fights (ie rag) where some stam was useful (i cant remember but I seem to recall HP being like 3.5-4k  was ideal for MC with decent resists on some fights), but outside of that it was basically wasted.  
---
I think that the closet you would get in vanilla is Paladin tank, and they are probably the least effective tank. They can do it, its just not as easy for them. Otherwise the closest you will get might actually be bear tank.
---
Well that's a 40% difference in threat.
---
Target A (Voidwalker) starts at 100% threat against B (mob). C (ranged character) reaches 130% of A's threat on B. For A to regain threat on B, A needs to not only catch up to C who is 30% ahead on threat, but also needs 110% of C's threat to regain aggro.
---
That's not only a little bit of threat, it's a lot.
---
I know of a few, self included. I do know not everyone's so lucky to share gaming hobbies with their SO, though.
---
Hardcore when all the strategies are known for the past 13 years?
---
That became a lot more interesting, and the bear will just follow you the whole way?
---
If your faction reliably loses AV, it's actually optimal to reverse that when it comes to rep grinding. One quarter of the team secures any easy rep-granting objectives then ports back to base. Everyone soaks up one rep per kill running a meat grinder on the enemy team with no waiting around on a queue to pop. You can end up earning 5-10 rep per second that way when you include turnins (e.g. armor scraps).
---
I still have a lot of free time on my hands. Even more now I'd say because I don't have homework.
---
I am sure they will make fresh servers every year or two as long as their is a demand.
---
As far as difficulty scaling? No. Just release TBC.
---
yup.
---
OP probably played on a quiet pvp server or a pve server. My experience with a warrior pre-STV was "this is a little slower but still fun". My experience leveling a warrior during and post-STV was "I have never felt so vulnerable and at the mercy of others good will"

I can't find any information on a ps that completed it in 3 days. Lh took 5-6 weeks and that was probably the biggest server to do the event ever at blizzard rates. Nd took about a month and that was an accelerated timeline with auto complete since they're closing up shop this summer. 
---
I'm not saying it didn't happen, but my guess is if it did then they weren't using blizzard rates. 
---
Completely irrelevant.
---
oops, it seams to be spamming.
---
Seems well thought out
---
Is someone recor-BOOM!
---
No? Care to elaborate a little bit more? I didn’t mind heroic/mythic dungeons, but I might be a part of a small percentage of the community that liked progressing through them if that is the general consensus. 
---
Totally just looking for friendly discussions on these. 
---
Would you be open to level 60 versions of the lower level dungeons with gear associated with those levels?
---
The horde base chokepoint is brutal too -- a ramp with a narrow door in range of both towers. Ice Trap + Entrapment to root allies on the ramp, unleash hell on them from the safety of the towers and other safespots.
---
Hunter frost traps and mages with imp. Blizzard. Give the team an extra 30 seconds.
---
1.12 means patch 12 and for example 1.3 means patch 3.
---
There is a lot more back-capping than there used to be, but don't experience that many defensive matches in retail (although I has been a few weeks since I played).
---
Omg yes.
---
I always camp one of those towers with my warlock (grim reach for 20% range boost) and dot everyone in their raid.
---
This might sound silly, but this simple screenshot just inflamed an immense boner in me. There are just so many good memories goofing around with friends in my early ages, when the journey just started and everyone is getting their boners more and more... Man I can't wait
---
Honestly, I think you would probably enjoy Shammy more from what you are saying. Its a great class and the new experience will probably get you hooked.
---
This is so cool. I love how small the numbers were back then...2.6k at a  fresh level 60. You knew that if you hit for 1000 you were chunking someone. 
---
 Thanks for the answer. In my memory, the bar disappeared, but memories can fool you. :)
---
Hey, I'm looking for a guild with raid times like yours. What classes are you in need of? I'm considering Warrior,  Warlock, or Mage.
---
I mean, that was just a number for placeholder purposes. Obviously the seasons would need to be longer just because the grind to 60 can be time consuming - let alone getting geared. Sorry for the confusion.
---
If he wants to have the world record paladin /played to 60 then no, he's not gonna AFK craft.
---
For Alliance, Defense is always easy as the towers are harder to cap and the bridge is still a thing.
---
Horde only have two options of really defending, the narrow road in front of Ice Blood and The indoor area in between the two Frostwolf towers. If alliance get that far, its basically already over and people are just turtling for the sake of getting more kills. 
---
Unlike Balinda who's entrance is facing towards the alliance base, Galvanger's entrance is totally open and leads right into the field of strife, making it really hard for horde to reinforce and defend.
---
The only real advantage horde have is being able to setup by the narrow choke by Ice Blood before the alliance can get there. But if the Horde wants to try to zerg rush, they will lose to the alliance every time as its FAR easier and faster to get into and cap the relief hut compared to the sheer volume and crap around the aide station which is for some reason placed in DEAD center of the alliance base... nevermind the bridge. Back-dooring is slower, but marginally safer.
---
The alliance base is a nightmare to cap with or without back-dooring because the towers are in range to hit the cap, NPC's are constantly in range to attack the cap, and its literally in the dead center. Its far too easy to move 5 feet in any direction and aggro elite NPC's which respawn extremely fast. Conversely, its very easy to walk up to the horde relief hut which is for some reason out of the way and has not one, but TWO open areas with no guards or archers to attack that can be used to kite mobs.
---
If the horde fails to defend the Ice Blood choke, its over for them unless they full on turtle the pair of frost wolf towers. 
---
Alliance can very easily not care about defense, because even 5 players are really all you need in tandem with the NPC swarm and tower locations of the stormspike base to a nearly absurd degree -- with or without the extra NPC guards.
---
/rant over
---
3-6 months is way to low. Let's say you play 4 hours a day (which I already count as hardcore at least semicore). In time you will fix your leveling routes but depending on your class it will still take 6-7 days to hit 60. Let's say you have an average of six days playtime which is realy low in my eays spreeded on all classes. 24 hours x 6 days / 4 hours a day summs up to 36 days leveling. 
---
Next point are the raids and dungeons. It looks pretty nice like raids get done in under a hour on private servers. But most likely it will take way longer on clasic servers.  Tipsout made a pretty good video about the differences between ps and classic servers and why many people will have a hard awakening. 
---
Her have a watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYepdsfid4w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYepdsfid4w)
---
Season Servers sound like fun but every season would have to last at least one year, maybe more.
---
Why did they die instantly? (never fought C'thun xD)
---
At a certain point though, what rewards will we be chasing? This game will be out a long time, eventually we'll achieve what we set out to achieve. At that point the only thing to do will seek fun activities, and I think original AV was that (for me at least). 
---
Can't wait to play with all these different builds. Its going to be so nice to see people using more unique playstyles. It made for some great gaming moments.
---
I'll PM you :)
---
Sorry, as iterated above it was simply just a place holder for a suggestion. Apologies for the confusion.
---
As long as you constantly hit them directly without letting 10 full seconds pass, you can kite forever. Usually done with Arcane Shot(Rank 1). 
---
Some later patches implemented maximum kite range on bosses lkke Kazzak, to avoid him being kited to stormwind. 
---
If they don't bring back the stronger NPCs, then Korrak would be skipped just as quickly as the first 2 towers. Why fight over the mid GY when you can rush the last one and work your way back? Korrak will be ignored, just like that GY is ignored on retail \*without\* any trolls to stop them from capping it. 
---
If at least you had the decency to play Horde, but no, you had to go Alliance ;-)
---
I expect that so many months after naxx is released and the concurrent player count starts to really drop off, servers of the same type in the same battlegroup will be merged into the "perpetual" graveyard server, and fresh servers will launch.
---
If and when TBC is released I really doubt servers will transition to it. Either they'll let you copy/transfer your character, or maybe you will have to reroll.
---
I like the idea of Classic because it's *not* a treadmill.
---
WoW peaked in Wrath with less than 13 million subs. So where are you getting 40 and 80 million from?
---
That green beam you saw, is what shamans wished their chain lightning was every time it bounces it deals more and more damage and bounces indefinitely.
---
I just pvp'ed to rank12 with my enh shaman until around the aq opening. Then I joined a semi hardcore guild and raided as resto. I cant remember exactly what items I had before tbc launched, but I definitely knew about mp5 stacking, chainhealing, and downranking. I didn't know EJ but was active in the official shaman forum.
---
Because then you're not playing classic. Classic was about gear optimization not grinding heroic &gt; mythic ilvl. You'll be using level 50 blues in raiding AQ40 strictly because the gear is better than 60 epics in certain situations.
---
Yep, that is the issue. On retail we don't have to use all the things people feel ruined the game, but we do and it changed the atmosphere of the game. I don't have to use LFD, LFR, flying, catch-up mechanics etc... yet it makes it hard to participate in the game if I don't use some of these things since everyone else is playing in those spaces in that way. If we want to favor gameplay and fun over convenience, we have to limit people's access to convenience and focus on actually playing the game instead of skipping over parts of it. 
---
Totally understand that. Fair point.
---
I used to kite mobs from burning steppes to Goldshire in late TBC. So I assume it should work in Vanilla. 
---
And the writing was pretty great. 
---
It’s not a smart thing to do. If the enemy wipes at choke then they will also go defend and that’s how you get a 4 hour AV. People who defend at choke are douchebags and looked down upon everyone. 
---
Yeah so as a result you needed a certain amount of classes with dispel so they could click their decursive once it lights up... groan
---
Meanwhile in retail you've got to have high throughput with more complex rotations, little room for error in terms of positioning (and for instance dispelling often triggers an AoE effect requiring a certain position before dispels) and so forth.
---
In vanilla there weren't many fights requiring everyone pulling their weight until Naxx.
---
If you’re for min/maxing then the trinket is EZ choice. It has a unique effect that will be useful if the server goes into BC. The staff is not important.
---
All in on Shaman this time around. Had my years with my orc hunter, time for something new with my tauren shaman!
---
Yeah, you got me there. Can’t beat farming for those BiS pieces for certain bosses.
---
I'm going to wager 99% of people levelling warriors aren't going to be sweaty enough to kill 9 mobs every two minutes. 
---
Paladin tank does the most AE damage not the most threat. At least on Pservers the act of applying battleshout to 5 people over and over again is far stronger.
---
Priest mind control is such an annoyance that it’s a bannable on most private servers. 
---
My suggestion would be once aq40 has been cleared and naxx runs start that the classic team works on more content for classic. 
---
Nobody has mentioned either stealth class yet....You know what helps you grief people better than any other? STEALTH
---
yeah the damage is multiplied, so last guy hits get nuked for 150 million or something with a 3-5k HP pool :p 
---
You think they’ll have TBC specific servers where you can import your 60s to, or just require you to relevel on the server? 
---
Well we will see how hardcore the casuals guilds will get on classic :D 
---
But yes I was kinda joking around a bit, though even for more casual guilds it is common to go the next best thing is which is impale prot.
---
I am also curious 
---
Took 4-5 weeks the last two times the biggest vanilla pserver had the AQ war effort. It was 50% on the first day due to everyone turning in the easy mats like leather/runecloth/etc. Then it took forever to turn in the firebloom and low level bandages/food. This is on a pserver with 3x the population a regular server had back then, and f2p, which means mule accounts for bank space/stockpiling are a thing. The blizzlike war effort numbers were used. 
---
I’m pretty sure I have the progression sheet for the war effort that happened last year somewhere, will edit it in if I find it. 
---
I'm not talking about the difficulty of leveling a rogue, I'm talking about it taking a fuck ton of time.
---
But they take over twice as much damage in return.
---
Yeah, Defense is totally useless against spells and the like. Technically the "spell defense" is resistance, but I don't think people will advertise that stat lol.
---
Though to be honest that what makes a Paladin or Shaman in the group all the more helpful, as well as others like Druid and Priest: 60 resistance is massive in certain scenarios.
---
Not to mention the marketing behind classic.
---
Blizzard have the power to make pretty much every gamer on the Internet aware of classic release, if they so choose.
---
Private servers had pretty much zero marketing, and awareness about them was spread by word of mouth alone. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnnodvQgpI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRnnodvQgpI)  reinforcements caused it to be a zergfest huh?
---
You can tank dungons as any spec as a warrior. You don't even have to use a shield if you don't want. You can also use any weapons you want. So its whatever you feel would suit your style more.
---
You can pull multiple mobs as a warrior by evade kiting, sure you can skip mobs as a rogue but as for actually grinding mobs, warriors do it faster.
---
Lol who watches this shit
---
I don't think so. I'm not a fan of retail that much, but Classic WoW won't overtake it. Only in the beginning will numbers skew, but after 4 months, there will be drops.
---
Classic WoW will bring back players who want to rejoice in the MMO feeling of a game again - especially those who grew up with the game.
---
Many players who are newer, and tried private servers will also be interested in the game.
---
Retail WoW is a watered down version of an MMO, and feels more adventure. It's not a bad game, but the development of the game doesn't provide the "MMO feel" as what was released in the 2004-2009 era of MMO gaming.
---
Classic WoW will be healthy due to it's enjoyment from the playerbase, but it won't overtake Retail due to the patience and time required for the game.
---
- Leveling is much slower.
---
- Doing any sort of group questing takes longer.
---
- Dungeons require you to find groups, get everyone present, and then complete (this can take 2 hours)
---
- Raiding will still require some dedicated time.
---
- People always mention that the journey is leveling, but it's really not. Once you become level 60, that's when you'll be spending most of your time playing your class and doing all the end-game content (whether PvE or PvP)
---
The game will be great on it's own, and I'm looking forward to it. But the market for MMO's is no longer there, and since this is a niche market for gaming, it will only bring in the dedicated few.
---
Or just go into bc....
---
Prot Warriors can also purge buffs with SS
---
I am going to leave this sub lol. I get an actual feeling of dread when I think about how long we have to wait when I see any of these dang screenshots. 
---
Yup. On pservers if you turtle you guarentee everyone else to start doing the same and none gets rep/honor. Best tactic is just to improve your speed.
---
Also if that doesn't happen, then I like to say that the most autistic team wins, because it's just about whatever team gives up on defending and accepts the loss first.
---
Yes. Because clearly that doesn't mean work on tbc. However I don't want to have classic servers up for only a year.
---
I would call face tanking the third mob and playing with some 15-30 second cooldowns pretty damn easy lol.
---
I suggest editing the second paragraph out. 
---
It is not ridiculous. It is the whole point of the GY system there and why it is important which GYs you take.If you get knocked back to a different area, pitch in with the objectives there and stop trying to overreach.
---
This was def pushing me to shammy. Honestly, I don't really care what my dps is as long as it is good for my class.
---
Next level Vanilla brain in action.
---
Ooo I remember tha questline !   
---
Somehow this is the questline that marked me the most. It was so long, so difficult to gather people. That's what Vanilla XP was all about.
---
As long as you periodically damage it
---
Fml I’m jelly, although when I play I get alone time 
---
It's good to see all the noobs on this subreddit think all these point based systems are good. Loot council is by far the superior loot system, but it requires a lot of work to do it right. For the average guild a point based system with rules that doesn't allow hunters to get BoA/DFT (and similar stuff like that), is the best system. 
---
Asking the right questions here. I used to stealth to north dun badar bunker, burn the flag and then snowball the defending alliance players out the window down into the ravine.  
---
Snowball AV is best AV. 
---
What's AV? 
---
Like some has said, engineering is actually super cheap.
---
I do not recommend leveling mining just to store mats for engineering, mining takes a fuck ton of time to skill.
---
So yes, herb+engi is a really good pick infact. You get the engi bonuses for pvp and pve, and you have herbalism as a money maker. 
---
General theory is that they will keep classic servers up while letting you import your char into tbc. 
---
Don't let OP see this comment, he'll instantly downvote it like he did with my replies. He's a fierce one.
---
Just find 79 like minded people half of which you can't even contact every game it's so easy! I don't get the complaint I can't wait to get all the overly powerful AV epics a couple hours after I hit 60. 
---
I'm not sure it needs it but I'll /s to be safe. 
---
ah Arathi Highlands
---
I think at least part of it is just the sheer fact that the incentive is there. If you’re paying attention to incentives, you will take part in these things, have a bad time (which is bad), then you will have to force yourself to ignore incentives. Personally, ignoring incentives feels like I’m playing the game in a contrived manner. For example, if I have access to flying, but choose to walk everywhere instead, then I feel like I’ve just arbitrarily handicapped myself and I will constantly feel the pull of that flying capability
---
NE Hunter - Walk your pet near an Inn, put him on Stay, set to Aggressive, run off and Shadowmeld somewhere in LOS.
---
Sucks when you are forced to play rushed games because people want the rewards rather than the fun though and yes FORCED.
---
Warlock
---
Summon inferno, dismiss pet, spam banish (optional).
---
Have fun.
---
Link to website please
---
Maybe it is shift one or control one for 1-3 and he clicks 3-5! 
---
Instead after the first month or two of the game launching no one will play av because its a mad rush which no one wanting to play AV enjoys
---
You found a video of a pre-made 35 man AV who entered with the deliberate strategy of winning AV as fast as possible.. and thats your evidence that every game is a 4 minute zerg? Wut?
---
So now you care about points?
---
Also, wasnt me. My guess is that you came off like an abrasive and unpleasant person. 
---
from my pserver experience, it just takes a couple players to slow it down. To all the people thinking this will be the end of the world, just get like 10 likeminded people in an AV, start defending, this will lead to both rushes failing, and the grind commences.
---
You will be called names, yelled at, etc. but it is possible
---
This would probably work with Borelgore too, since I kited him to the gates of Ironforge back in the day.
---
&gt;a tough time finding a group, just like a druid/shaman/priest/paladin who refuse to heal.
---
Did you not say this? I never missed your point.  I declined to acknowledge it because in my experience it's not true.
---
My response was in regards to you thinking that *because of Warriors that don't tank will have a hard time finding groups, then so must the rest of hybrids who won't heal will also have a hard time finding groups*.  That's just not true.  I pointed out why.  Your experience with warriors may be more true based on your past groups, but hybrids bring more to the table than just "DPS" or "Tanking".  And **THAT** was the point I was trying to make that **YOU** missed.
---
Probably used to be a clicker lol
---
Tats my irl cakeday. So you get my upvote.
---
Fragmenting populations leaving some servers abandoned. Not a good idea really. 
---
lots of people were clickers before they learned how to bind
---
Hard pass fam.
---
Nice.
---
A shaman with a healing and dps set will be able to get into groups far easier than a shaman with just a dps set regardless of whatever utility his class has. That goes for all hybrid classes. That is simply undeniable. 
---
Undead is a really good choice for devouring as you pointed out and generally alliance go dwarf and horde go UD. I haven’t played private servers so can’t comment on talent choice
---
&gt; Dude you are mixing up ranking and tier ranking, two different things
---
Tier lists literally are a ranking. 
---
Warriors are so strong and complete, hence they are the only class that is able to tank ALL encounters, that they are clearly the best and in a tier on their own.
---
Sure the difference between Warriors and Druids is smaller than between Druids and Paladins, but still more than big enough to put Warrior in their own tier.
---
Should show S-1 for shift one
---
I think the term you're looking for is leashing. It's a case by case basis but I'd assume that the world bosses would all have a leash. 
---
I agree, I think if the staff was available at launch we'd be having a different discussion 
---
But you also said that reinforcements are what caused the zerg, that video is just to show that zergs were happening way before 2.0
---
They patched it later so it eventually did disappear but that early on it didn't. 
---
How the f? 
---
The op said it would eclipse both, I did not put them in the same league nor did I state they have the same player count. Did you even read the OP?
---
If you actually think classic will eclipse retail you are hopelessly optimistic. And it won't happen
---
I love how everyone was freakin out about their awesome new weapons
---
Priest mind control is the ultimate tool.. Only limited by your imagination really
---
I used to run premade AVs and we would always have about 1/4 of the raid hold the chokes and slow the enemy down. We used to have a really high win percentage so I guess it worked out in a well coordinated premade.
---
True though, I used to be a clicker, and I played on a laptop with one of those little rubber clits instead of using the track pad and didn't have a mouse when I first started lol.
---
Yup, the team with a few people on defence usually wins.
---
Ok. You don't need to be rewarded every time you turn the game on, we are not going for the live wow experience.
---
Don't have time? Don't play AV. Id play the shit out of old AV not the 1.12 one but I don't care about rushing the rewards, I know they will come in time. If I have to drop for whatever reasons I have to drop just like I did as a kid. No biggie.
---
Yeh I haven’t played private servers or vanilla pvp so im stuck! 
---
I see people posting about mana being an issue for shadow priests and that devouring plague is heavy on mana and can be dispelled, either wasting mana or inner focus. Leading me believe a troll would be more reliable. No idea what sort of damage the shadow protection does, or how well it procs blackout.
---
Although WOTF is OP as well, so I’m going round in circles
---
I don’t even have a pc that can run wow atm but here I am planning for release day 😂
---
I said reinforcements are what made the zerg mandatory which is a big difference.
---
I'm 100% positive there will be sub 15 minute AV's. Its possible and sometimes thats how it will be played. But AV is mandatory zerg with reinforcements. If horde try to mount a defense they'll almost always lose on reinforcements. Without reinforcements, horde will have the flexibility to actually defend and push instead of just trying to sneak by and winning the pve match.
---
Battle stance on the battle stance action bar. I want to cry, it's so beautiful.
---
When I used to do premade AVs, we would always have a stealth group rush those towers and eliminate the archers to ease that choke for when the main raid got there. Although not sure how this would work out without all the raid coordination, but thats another issue I suppose.
---
Hmm hard choices for sure. My personal mindset is that going into tbc and merging servers is a better idea then new content because it is not the same company making vanilla as it was back then. New content that is not received well could easily kill the game more then merging servers and moving to bc. 
---
Saw on another thread that back then it did not show it like that. No clue
---
The hit cap for one-handed/yellow attacks/bows is is 8.6%, rounded up to 9.
---
Not only is it loch modan, it's by the gate next to the asshole NPC who refuses to let you into searing gorge unless you get into searing gorge from Badlands, kill the elite Kodo in the area, and take the horn back to her. Then she refuses to believe that it belongs to that Kodo and requires you to verify it at the hall of explorers.
---
How do you avoid that beam?
---
Reminds me of that temple room where you grab the Golden Gun in Goldeneye 64
---
0
---
You might be right on this one
---
People are going to quit after a while anyway.  
---
Did you take that screenshot because of the 69 charges
---
&gt;Why? Because some people can't deal with coding a few extra mobs? Because listening to people whining on forums hurts my fragile little heart? 
---
lmao I stopped at this. If this is how you actually think then it's pointless to continue. 
---
You're whole post is just an emotional bias with nothing but assumptions for the whole player base.
---
These types of posts add nothing to the discussion.
---
Would be a terrible idea and I imagine the community would be against it 
---
Sure, doesn't mean you actively do your best to  kill it by fragmenting servers further.
---
Kukost.
---
Thats just the life cycle of an MMO though, something has to be fun for people to play just because. They're not going to do it because its there.
---
You have a split playerbase, just because you like AV and want AV doesn't mean everyone feels the same. of course its vise versa but the point still stands. 
---
No chance.
---
It's not hard or slow unless you are new to warrior. It levels pretty well and quickly to be honest. Especially after you pick up sweeping strikes. The two slowest leveling classes are paladin and rogue. With paladin in last place by a mile. It might be a little arguable but level ease goes in this order. Hunter, Druid, Mage, Warlock, Warrior, Priest, Shaman, Rogue, Paladin.
---
You also explained you want to play with tanking a bit. Shammys can actually tank all the way up to lv50 instances. 
---
Joe
---
When people give you well thought out replies for why they want classic wow you will pick up on a common theme and it is not that they miss the old grind or the quests, but rather they miss the shared adventure they had with friends and enemies. 
---
Guilds in WoW were kind of an online family and your raid group was you and your friends, out having a blast. The server was your neighborhood and the world was large but not to the point of anonymity. You put in effort and you got rewards. 
---
And every now and then someone would bring an AOE lifedraining dragon into Stormwind.
---
I remember one day when we had had Onyxia on farm for a long time and were still clearing her for gold, alts, and new members but with much smaller raid groups.While doing this we were having a lengthy discussion about how awesome it would be if your IRL job was to get a bunch of your friends together and go kill a dragon once a week. 
---
Another time we were swinging through MC and some pug kid had an open mic and was talking to someone on the phone about us... Saying how badass we were and how smooth it was going and how we all had our tier 2 shoulders. Normally we discouraged open mic but that time we let it slide. 
---
Yet another time in MC we had our paladin class channel and we had something like 12 paladins in the raid that night. MT had joined the channel while giving a description on vent of some mechanic we would be facing in late BWL but you could hear his voice trail off as he realized then announced on vent that all 12 of his paladins were having a serious discussion about Star Trek in the paladin channel while also rocking the charts in the raid. 
---
Virtually none of the memories people wax on for at any length will be about playstyle or graphics or loot... They will all be about the interactions we had with others in the game. The game fostered those interactions and created communities, and for those who experienced it there is no replacement for that.
---
I think a critical difference between WoW and Diablo 3 is that you don't need 40 people in Diablo to get things done.
---
Nice! What server? 
---
Dude, how many times are you gonna move the goalpost of your argument?  First you just generically said "X class not doing Y activity".  Now you're saying that &lt;X class&gt; with &lt;Y gear set&gt; will get into groups easier than &lt;X class&gt; without &lt;Y gear sets&gt;
---
*Well-no-fucking-duh.*  That's like saying protection tanks at 60 with Quel Serrar and Drillborer Disk are more likely to be picked up as a 5-man tank then the Fury Warrior with his off-tank gear.  
---
I'm done with this dumb argument.
---
&gt;"I know it wasn't in classic but do you think they'll add a Minecraft mode to classic?"
---
Why do people post such stupid questions. 
---
Free-for-all. Chaotic neutral.
---
Calm down, Satan. 
---
Would love them to add the eye of the storm bg though 
---
You're telling people it's fucked up to 'neglect' family to play video games but at the same time you've kept your GF at bay for 10 years? Talk about scummy. 
---
Also, it's not like you and your family literally spend 24/7 together, there is such a thing as downtime where kids are asleep and partner wants to do their own thing. 
---
They are good at showing up for the raid on time.
---
That is by no measure a guarantee. 
---
There is dual talents. You just pay 50g and then you can switch. 
---
I feel your pain brother. 
---
Zug-zug. 
---
Entangling roots keeps enemies at range. Lots of hots on mail is solid. A healer that can take a beating or stay stealth(really good synergy with nightelf shadow meld). 
---
I finished leveling a feral druid on a private server only a few weeks ago. I can say that healing a dungeon without any talent points in resto, but while wearing all healing gear (mostly int/spirit, some +hp, some +mps) is fine. Remember to keep water on you and you’ll do well enough as long as people don’t pull too much.
---
Leveling as feral is awesome. I did tons of damage, could self-heal almost indefinitely while fighting mobs my level, and had little trouble finding dungeon groups. Tanking in feral gear is also manageable, if you need to. You’re a little squishy, but hold aggro quite well.
---
WPvP is also quite enjoyable as feral, since you’re effectively playing a rogue without stuns or poisons, but you can heal yourself, root, and use ranged spells if needed.
---
10/10 would recommend. I’ll definitely be leveling a Druid in Classic, either as my first or second character.
---
The vanilla economy relies on the assumption that people can't respec at will to farm gold efficiently. Additionally, requiring raiders to respec for PVP helps mitigate the gear advantage they typically have over dedicated PVPers.
---
Thanks. As a Dwarf priest, how feasible is healing with shadow spec in 5-10 mans? Hell, if I go along to a chilled 40 man as one of 8 priests (for example) will anyone notice if I'm "healing" without holy/disc spec?
---
Blizzard designers are on record saying they were and are not happy with the hybrid tax being as severe as it was. I expect balance changes in hybrids shortly after MC is commonly ran. 
---
Also very true and in D3 you can hit max level and start farming gear in what... 30 minutes of power leveled? Looks like season server would definitely need to be a year+.
---
People try doing that with pugs all the time. 
---
You need to leave people there to hold it, otherwise they just get taken back
---
The worst part of grinding these guys is that their poison lasts like 2mins. I hated grinding this specific quest on my rogue 
---
Benediction needs to be up there :&gt;
---
Good to know. Do you mean with a hybrid spec and gear change?
---
After playing Vanilla from the beginning, I quit not too long after hitting 70 in TBC. I felt like the game really lost it's unique real-world Azeroth feel. Because of this, I sincerely hope Classic stays Vanilla, or else my days will be numbered :(
---
Devouring Plague and Shadow Guard/Hex of Weakness are both useful, but the choice between Undead and Troll boils down to how powerful Will of the Forsaken is compared to Berserking.
---
WotF is the reason why Undead is preferred in PvP.
---
Elitist jerks didn't really come into it's own until TBC. You are rewriting history. I am not saying no guilds understood itemization in classic. However you are talking about a class of player so removed from the average player. As to make talking about it a waste of time. 99.99% of guilds and players in classic wow. Had no idea how to gear properly.
---
Thats why its smart to let your enemy team hold the gy close to your base. That way they dont spawn near theirs.
---
Pretty common tactic in my experience. People always get shit for capping the mid graveyards late game
---
Simply because I enjoy healing (but prefer PVP dpsing). Would happily tank while levelling though, if need be. That's another reason to lean Druid; the potential just to roll whatever's needed whilst levelling.
---
Every thread like this is making me want to main Druid more and more
---
My guess is sooner than that. Remember that there was a board meeting at Blizzard where they talked about the long term viability of the product before TBC came out and specifically identified paladins as a risk as they were both iconic and core to the story but also extremely poorly implemented. 
---
Also keep in mind that there is a whole new generation of players on tap. They will not be happy with the hybrid tax being so extreme. 
---
I would love for them to add Pandaren Demon Hunters while we're at it.
---
This sounds like a nightmare imo, playing for hours only to have people log off and being unable to play with half them gone, how do you coordinate re-entry? Does everyone agree to be back in X hours? 
---
Im not shooting it down, it just doesn’t sound as appealing as people pipe it up to be.
---
&gt;druids have a versatile hotw spec that can be used to fill any role ( except caster dps) with just a gear swap so yeah its fine for 5mans up to ubrs
---
That's a spec I was interested in. What gear/set up would you use with HOTW spec to (try) kill stuff in PvP?
---
&gt; If you want to change one class then every class will have to be changed. 
---
This is not and has never been Blizzard's design approach. Classes were changed one or two per tuning pass, never all at once minus expansions. 
---
How do you do that!?
---
It is funny how many people are just clueless about this stuff. The fact that Vanilla lacked these features is what made Vanilla, Vanilla. Everyone was poor from training skills, buying mounts, respeccing. Nothing came free and that was the beauty of it all. You were either a “Have” or a “Have-not”. I hope they keep it exactly the same save for maybe a few updates to the code that runs in the background. But even then if it is a super smooth experience then is it really the Vanilla we remember or something else?
---
What he said
---
This is a great example of a company having the chance to repair what they did over expansions. I would rather see tbc and wrath released without some of the radical choices they made afterwards, like removing faction unique abilities. I would prefer they took their time and didn't rush.
---
Yeh that makes sense. Decisions decisions, I’ve always liked the underdog but don’t wanna regret not being undead AGAIN 
---
The only issue I see with that is if it stays vanilla, how long do people really stay invested?  As someone who enjoys the raiding aspect of WoW,  if its gonna stay vanilla forever, why would I keep playing after getting through Naxx once?
---
Decided to repost this from a month ago to farm that sweet nostalgia karma eh? Couldn't even be bother to change the title a little bit either huh?
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ao550g/an\_undead\_mage\_dings\_60\_on\_january\_22nd\_2005/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ao550g/an_undead_mage_dings_60_on_january_22nd_2005/)
---
Thanks for the input. How did you find 60 as a Druid? 
---
I do.  He's certainly contributing more to this sub than your useless comments.
---
Just downvote it and move on.  It's someone reposting because the previous one from a month ago got over 1k karma (most likely due to nostalgia).  Now it's just pathetic.  Downvote into oblivion I say good sir!
---
The server is already fragmented by that point.  Most people don’t want to play Vanilla forever.  They want to play their expansion of choice on a not-private server with a community of other people.  
---
While this is very much an effort to give people what they want, it’s being done in the interest of making money.  If it makes more money to launch a BC server and allow transfers, they will.  Probably for a transfer fee.
---
Bit they won't need to defend. They can just run to the boss and kill it. 
---
No extra classes or changes to spells/talents. 
---
But more BGs, arena, and maybe separate twink brackets wouldn’t be the end of the world. Although the twink brackets would cause uproar, I can’t see why anyone would be against extra bgs or arena.
---
Yeh I like pvp btw 
---
Wrong. I don’t really care too much about which one it is but extended day long AVs sound like hell and I do look very forward to PvPing.. best not to make assumptions or generalizations about a potential half a million people.
---
What's the secret to getting 21 in 53 minutes? I remember when I played Vanilla and it would take me a full 14 hour day of gaming to get from 1-11, and that's in the Nelf zone that I was really familiar with.
---
This is valid. Ret could get procs on the existing tree to encourage raids to bring and gear them... 
---
Vengeance allowing the next hit for everyone in your party to include a bit of holy damage based on the size of the crit which triggered Vengeance... This would push your raid to bring Ret, gear Ret and use Ret.
---
And that is with a single change to a single talent and nothing else. There are lots of options, this one just happens to be one I pushed for way back in the day.
---
Other hybrid specs could and should get similar late-tree buffs.
---
This is a new kind of evil
---
WotF is just too good. I was so glad when they finally gave it a proper nerf in WotLK, and I even played Undead at the time.
---
WotF is just too good and that's unfortunate because it makes people feel like they have no choice but to go Undead.
---
Why would anyone go against the rush meta willingly? Having any sort of real AV battle means we need a 40 premade. 
---
Sorry to say, but these posts grind my gears :). My sister complains about having 3 kids, wants everyone to help her out. Friends have no free time, always running around, so tired... ZERO sympathy over here :).
---
And [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cFj6T9lOtM)is the sound of PTSD.
---
It's so crisp
---
Just say you picked dwarf for pvp and if a guild declines you then you are better off without them. Honestly it's not big enough to make or break. The best PVE guild on a current pserver all picked gnome/dwarf for better pvp racials and they are still topping meters and clearing raids first.
---
You don't really avoid the beam, you just avoid it chaining too much 2 ppl MAX should ever be hit by it. spread out and it makes the pull "fun" to learn
---
Yes. And my point is you want to take half the population of an already halved population and give them the middle finger. "Well x already quit let's fuck y."
---
Can’t watch in US
---
That my man i'm afraid I can't answer. I hope you get a reply on it however. 
---
Anyone remember Barak Kodobanes head? Shortly after Obama became president it was removed due to the /2 comments lol.
---
0 it would be a disaster. It's a change no one wants and no one is asking for.
---
No, this is not a retail sentiment. 
---
We knew back in 2006 that the paladin class was flawed to its core.
---
Even though I consider myself to have been a fairly good player back then, I learned about hit rating cap very late. Like as late as end of TBC or so. I used to just go for gear that boosted my main attack power more and gave me more health.
---
It's kind of odd, because no where does the game explicitly state that the hit cap for melee attacks for example is 7% (or was it 8?). So I have no idea how people came up with the numbers we have today.
---
I'm pretty sure it does.
---
Also, transforms cost 30% of their total mana. So a combination of snares and drains force them to drop mana quickly.
---
The decay isn't that bad at the lower ranks, so it might be possible, however it will probably take you a while.
---
Could be. They were added in 1.10 and have the "op" itemization of 1.10 though, and all that 1.10 stuff was supposed to be in phase5. Does not change the issue that having these quests available in launch but for instance not dire maul makes no sense if you want vanilla wow and not some frankenstein mix.
---
Lol
---
I absolutely refuse to accept 3D when I was growing I was promised Jetson style hologram TV. NO SUBSTITUTIONS! I also hate VR. Just way to paranoid a person to close off all my external senses.
---
I could see it getting a Blackrock-style reskin to make it make more sense thematically.
---
No one is getting [Atiesh](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22589/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian) this year.
---
I literally cannot try out the alliance because of that fucking racial.
---
I always main lock.
---
My first 60 was a warrior, and I played I think as arms when I leveled and when I raided back then.  I remember getting [Earthshaker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17073/earthshaker) and thinking I was so bad ass.  But I was 14, utterly unversed in theorycraft, and that weapon is complete and utter stinking garbage lol.
---
In live using your ground mount was also always an option yet flying mounts are the sole thing pointed to for world PvP being dead. 
---
You could make your own dungeon group too. 
---
You wouldn't do either unless you are insane though. We will see the same with AV. Those of us who want the epic big battles won't be playing AV at all and those who want the rewards will be done in a day, 2 at most and AV will be barren shortly after. 
---
Idk how they plan on doing it in Classic, but it was definitely a late addition. Pretty sure the AQ patch.
---
Agreed. I don't understand why a person would spend hours every week playing with leaders they don't trust to parcel out loot wisely. Go find another guild where you trust the people you're with.
---
The main benefit of loot council is that leadership can reward players for more than just showing up for fights. They can incentivise the behavior they want to see, like: donations to the guild bank, rep grinding to make resist BOEs for the guild, and helping guildies outside of raids. It's a powerful tool for defining guild culture.
---
People really do want you to heal, as most raid gear is oriented towards Druid healing. Finding dps gear is rare, and you start falling behind the pack quickly. That said, bringing a brez, innervate, and emergency heals is very appreciated when the need arises.
---
As for anything outside of raiding, Druids excel at everything. Want to tank? No issues. Want to heal? You do well enough. Want to dps? Sure, you might not be top, but you’re in the middle of the pack.
---
Also, I should note that 2-man content is where Druids shine most, I think. Jack-of-all-trades with a little backup goes a long, long way.
---
Yeh as a dwarf shadow priest I was so damn jealous back in the day. I didn’t even realise stoneform removed devouring plague until way into level 70 pvp 😅
---
Didn’t help that on my server horde dominated BGs and it was a PVE server. 
---
Horde undead shadow priest on a pvp server this time I think! No effin about 
---
AV now is terrible. Anything is better.
---
So you’re suggestion is to let 1/4 of the population dictate what the other 3/4s does?  Good luck with that.
---
2 months to kill 1 boss wow
---
In a straight up 1v1 you will not be terrified of any class as a shadow priest. They will be terrified of you.
---
You've completely misread that. Don't assume people are quitting classic because they want tbc. They could quit simply because they were lied to about how classic was played or how blizzard would implement the game. Don't strawman in video game discussions dude.
---
To away please.
---
Oh you don't have time? That's funny Blizzard made a version of WoW just for people like you it's called Battle for Azeroth
---
The game just continued. People who get on late &amp; and early would enter and continue fighting. The BGs were numbered instances you could see in the UI. I'd queue up, and end up in the same one. 
---
It's not for everyone, but to me it was a cool and unique feature. It was the closest thing we had to a persistent world PvP zone, and it's still superior to the persistent world PvP zone we ended up getting, Ashran. And to clarify I mean persistent as in lasting all day, not being something you queue for every few hours and play for 30 minutes, like Wintergrasp and Tol Barad. 
---
After playing in a hardcore, but still casual friendly and very supportive guild on my current pserver, I'll never play with anything other than a loot council.
---
When it comes to progression, loot council decides, which often comes down to "who can roll on this item" and not "you get this item," unless it's the MT.
---
When we're running MC on farm just for Thunderfury, rolling is extremely lax. It is very much on a need basis, but the loot council / class officers decide who actually can need on something and who can not.
---
I haven't been in many other loot council guilds and played in a DKP guild in retail Vanilla, so I can't exactly say how it is for other guilds.
---
But in my guild it's sometimes that the council outright decides who gets something, but more often than not they decide who can roll for something.
---
Usually the first question asked after something drops is "who wants this?"
---
Surprisingly it's oftentimes self regulated. I joined this guild late in its life and there are a lot of members more senior for me. I've said "I need this" for some things which they needed to, but they said "ah you just take it" and passed on it since they're so geared and I (was) very behind in gearing. No loot council authority, we decided among ourselves, then master looter gave me the item.
---
Basically, I sincerely hope that I can find a guild like this in Classic, with loot council.
---
Wild West rolling on things, or people fighting against each other with bidding wars, doesn't sound like something I want to do ever again.
---
I upvoted it.
---
Very unlikely you can hit r10 with that little play time. You can probably get up to r8 or so but you’ll need to make a bit of a push on your last week or 2 for r10
---
I remember downloading a bunch and creating fake UIs for this very reason lol
---
I think there's at least some balance players can find between seeking incentives versus slowing down and enjoying the game. AV has room as a place that is not designed to be efficient, while other BGs can fill that role (WSG, AB). If you want to take a break from the grind of AB/WSG, you could do the more casual content. Just like when BGs came out we stopped doing WPvP for the honor grind and moved to BGs (the short time Honor existed before BGs). If someone did WPvP it was just to goof off, which I think is a healthy thing to do sometimes if you don't want to burn out. 
---
It would be cool to have a WOW2, not sure about VR with today’s tech though. That said, I’m fairly sure WOW Classic is just blizzard trying to sooth their fanbase and attempting to make money off an old project. They want the money that Psvrs could very likely be making off of their game.
---
Good times, bad times, you know we've had our share.
---
This is true, and there's a reason for it: people who aren't engaging socially with guildies seem more likely to jump ship, taking all the loot they've won with them. Or maybe they'll get bored and quit the game altogether. If someone isn't going to make friends with guildies, then they should demonstrate commitment in some other way. Ultimately it's like anything else in life. Clock-punchers don't get raises and wallflowers don't get dates.
---
Priest is probably your best bet, they are the most versatile healing class in Vanilla. They’re the only one that has both offensive and defensive dispels and their raw healing very strong. Priests are probably in the highest demand of any healer, in both PvE and PvP. You can never have too many.
---
You will also be surprised at how accessible the raids are in 2019. It’s not at all like it was in 2005 where only the most hardcore players set foot in 40 mana. There will be *boatloads* of guilds that raid &lt;8 hours a week and don’t require consumables or world buffs.
---
A premade of 10 with good gear, engi/consumes will easily be able to cause a turtle. 
---
They're the best class for several different jobs.  PvP support, tank healer in raids, probably even best tank choice for Strath Undead or Scholo.  Pretty sure they don't need fixed.
---
They do for like Tank gear. Tier 1 isn't good for PvE dps warriors.
---
Good point! Hopefully, if Classic is a big hit and offers solid continued revenue, they could diverge from TBC and instead create more/harder raids within Azeroth in place of all of the closed off zones. That way there could be a scale-up of gear (to a point), but at the cost of having unbelievably difficult and complex raiding scenarios so not many people get the top tier of gear. This is the feeling I got when WoW first came out - unless you were really invested (and not a clueless kid) there was no way you would ever get the end game raid gear, so when you saw people with it you were legitimately in awe. 
---
If you want to play warlock, then just play it. You will probably still be able to find a group, and being able to summon people would make it easier to get others to join. 
---
If you're not sure how much you'll be able to play I would strongly suggest you play what you want the most, not what is easier to find a group for.
---
It might even be better. If you suddenly need to go afk during a raid or group, it will be much more of a problem if you are healing or tanking, especially in 5 man. 
---
As others have said, there will be family friendly guilds that will understand if you need to afk or even leave during a raid. 
---
If I were you, I would go for the class I want to play, and make it work. You will meet people to play with no matter your choice. It might be easier to find a group as a healer or tank, but in the end it's about you enjoying your time playing. 
---
Good luck, and know it doesn't matter what class you play, everything is needed, and there is no reason why you can't play warlock, it's a very good class for levelling as well :)
---
Don't think so.
---
If every single player is on board and listening to a single person you can do this. This will never happen in a pug. 
---
I feel you, bro. Sucks when your sister gets to play more games while you babysit :( 
---
They removed totems from retail? Wtf
---
If the gear is well itemized for both tanking and DPS then yes tanks generally get priority. For example [Band of Accuria](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17063). Do tanks get priority over DPS warriors for typical DPS gear? No way.
---
As a feral druid you can tank 5 man dungeons/UBRS. You're probably the best tank for that. I did tank UBRS resto specced without a problem (with tank gear from dungeons). And, as a tank, it's easiest to quickly go afk if you have to because of family.
---
The not being able to ress is a bigger deal as druid. People are going to die, you can't heal stupid. People are going to die because you fuck up. People are going to die because the tank fucks up. People are going to die because of a pat. It takes time if the person has to walk back and that might not even be possible because of respawn. This will make you curse more than once that you picked druid. I've played druid in Vanilla and will not play druid again because of no ress. 5 man dungeons is my preferred content and missing a ress is just needlessly painful. (If you raid with a casual guild it's a plus because druids are the only healer that can go afk after a wipe :-)
---
My first char at 60 was a shadow priest. You can heal all dungeons, including UBRS, as shadow without problems. And if you ever switch to holy, healing as holy feels like cheating...
---
Are you talking about retail vanilla, or private server experiences? 
---
Because resistances are fucked on every private server I've played on. It's easily the most consistently inaccurate thing I've come across, tbh.
---
Really fascinating to see this time capsule. I remember our progression being pretty similar although I think all three loot dragons might have been killed in the same raid. 
---
It’s important to note the times as well. Every week people are getting better and better gear and experience, and it feels like as long as you can keep that momentum, you’ll eventually get there.
---
And you finally do and it feels so good.
---
The transmog shit and all the goofy mounts and races just bum me out
---
Tank self healing isn't really a thing the same way it is now. Warlock is in some ways similar to a DK, self healing and tanky when soloing, DoT. Paladins are more self reliant than a warrior, but much poorer at tanking and DPS.
---
Also because warriors rely on white damage to generate rage.
---
Elitistjerks was 100% around before AQ40 even dropped 
---
I feel like that is something they will custom change to prevent
---
&lt;Saurfang Super PAC&gt;
---
Why do you recommend engineering? 
---
Haven't we seen this exact picture/topic before?
---
Nope. Retail.
---
thats a real sad twitch plug
---
I wish i got prio on accuria on my tank,  im still salty
---
Sorry bud, them’s the breaks of classic. Increased convenience in WoW leads to decreased uniqueness or sense of community so Classic is all about not making those convenience improvements since the trade off ultimately isn’t worth it.
---
Dps warriors usually tank their own dungeons, so they can grab both gear.
---
For tank gear, almost certainly.  For DPS gear, well it depends on how much the tanking warrior is holding the group hostage as the tank.
---
i think i took that screenshot :D
---
There's no real reason not to(other than people trying to force hybrids even more into healing) but likely not at launch.  We'll see after a few months.
---
Blizzard thought otherwise at the time.
---
Hell this is super relevant right now...wait...was that the plan all along?
---
I think it will be an interesting test for the video game industry, to be overly dramatic. 
---
Classic is the biggest re-release/remastered game to ever be announced and the gameplay from classic is totally different from retail. The people who play classic and stick with it past the first few months will arguable not be people who want ‘quick av wins’. 
---
I could be completely wrong, and we all get over our Nastalgia in the first month and just want quick honor. But I really theorize that the allure of playing AV like it used to be played will override the desire to pve in retail. 
---
It was around. Being around and being popular use are not the same. I am not telling you that you knew nothing of itemization or that no one knew of itemization. What I am saying is that if you did. You were in rarer territory then you seem to realize. I don't doubt that you could have been an elite. I am saying though being an elite and submerging yourself in elites. May make you think the average player knows more then they do. 
---
I would totally be behind the idea of a set of servers that reset every couple years.  As long as it's clear upfront which ones they are.
---
There's certainly a sense of fun you get playing on a fresh server that you don't get on an established server.
---
Why ? U dont need that much +hit, it would be greedy takeing it over someone Who needs more than double your hit%
---
All I see is people grossly misrepresenting JP's views and claiming he has an alt-right and nazi following. He doesn't. He's espoused the dangers of totalitarianism on both sides plenty of times.
---
&gt; I will not be doing anything serious at 60, if I even get there.
---
Then 5-mans and UBRS will suit you fine in blues.
---
&gt; If I'm a priest, I'll likely stay shadow (because I want to retain the ability to kill things out in the world) and if I go druid I'll likely be a feral/hybrid build - something that has at least some ability to kill other players with a lot of shapeshifting. Will I still be able to heal dungeons in those specs at 60?
---
If you're good, 5-mans can be healed by a shadow priest. I didn't spec to holy on Nost until I had preBIS and my guild had killed Luci. It's pretty mana-intensive. UBRS is also doable but if a pull gets totally fucked, you're gonna go oom. Pots are your friend.
---
Just make sure you have shadowform off lol. Jokes aside I think youd be fine as long as ur not progressing. Also dont roll on holy gear unless its for off-spec unless you are actively maining holy. 
---
I also read you want to stay shadow at 60 so you can still kill things in the open world. Just sayin, I play holy priest on a Pserver now and can do more dmg holy speccd then some hunters in my guild. You can def kill things in the open world as holy/disc speccd.
---
This. OMFG this. 
---
I got an itch to play WoW again, but after some soul searching I resubbed to retail instead of waiting for Vanilla: there is no way in hell I have time for a proper BRD run. Screw that noise, I need convenience in my life.
---
&gt;I’m all for #nochanges, but
---
Lmao this should seriously be a meme at this point. No changes means no changes, and that’s that. 
---
I have an exercise bike in the same room I play WoW in. I intend to hop on every time I get on a flight path, am waiting for a dungeon group to arrive etc. 
---
In dungeons, you can make any role work. Same in PVP. For raiding vast majority will go resto. One or maybe two good feral offtanks are a good thing though. For leveling feral is really the only way to go.
---
It's much more of a utility class and less ideal at each individual role.
---
Also, no resurrect outside of the battle res with a cooldown. So if you heal dungeons you need to bring someone with a res.
---
Band is BiS for a long time for tanks. Tanks have far fewer options for hit%. And yes they do need hit and you want them to have it. Bad things happen when your tanks can wiff. 
---
If i can max threat, everyone starts earlier, which is a raid wide increase vs one rogue etc
---
Preach
---
Point is you can never be more then a casual now and classic isn’t a game for casuals. I hear they are making diablo on the phone, maybe start there.
---
I need to be able to snowball people who hop on gryphons causing them to teleport to their flight destination. Crazy time saver.
---
I feel like they intentionally gave Alliance an advantage in AV because horde attracts way more PvP focused players, and generally has way better racials.
---
Trying to play an early alliance warlock when half the horde are immune to your kit is ridiculous.
---
I think you’re looking through a very small window called retail. Classic is a frozen in time game where you literally could play for years to make it to the most difficult content. 
---
Don’t be fooled by the idea that after 4 months all of the content will be exhausted. Think of it as a marathon. My friends and I have plans to play classic for years to come. We aren’t planning on starting mc for at least a couple of months. We want to enjoy the game. And take our time because we all have so many responsibilities now. 
---
You are not alone, so you have to consider that you like me will have the opportunity to do the content in the long run - not the short run. 
---
Oh lol. Just checked that out. Apparently  it got  renamed from \[Barak's Head\] to \[Kodobane's Head\].  
---
No. The entire point is that classic is classic, not full of features that were in expansions.
---
&gt; This is the feeling I got when WoW first came out - unless you were really invested (and not a clueless kid) there was no way you would ever get the end game raid gear
---
Thats honestly how most people felt, but that was also because WoW was a new game and no one knew how it really worked.  Now that we have not only experience, but all the Resources of the internet, people will not be nearly as clueless. Not to mention that in all honesty, Raids of today are much much more difficult than anything vanilla had, People are just better today than they were 15 years ago.

Everyone wants retail in classic when they could just play retail.
---
It is OP for PvP. Grenades, the net trinket... etc... It can make up for having sub optimal gear.
---
prot warriors take precedence for tank gear, dps warriors take priority for dps gear. what are you asking?
---
Good points, going horde though.
---
It just didn't happen that way, you are fighting 1 or 2 mobs and your hamstring misses or you dumped rage by mistake(nobody is perfect esp not while leveling). You realize the low hp guy went to get his hippie friends, by the time you turn to run you get dazed the next 3 hits which is basically that troll's way of embracing you until the love shack arrives. 
---
Yeah, I crossposted it. You can see the OP.
---
Hopefully no chance. 
---
2 months of dealing with 39 neckbeards and cat moms that sometimes didn't show up. Even the pits of hell don't have such intricate tortures.
---
Wow literally word for word lol
---
If you want to get banned, sure.
---
Yea, I am guessing with T1 and other epics doing BRD, LBRS, and others won't be too bad. Especially with a good healer. I mostly just wanna mess around with that spec.
---
You might die waiting for a dungeon group to stop screwing around and actually come to the portal
---
I've started bulking. That way, once classic hits I can live off my fat stores to maximize leveling efficiency.
---
I completely agree! I’ve been taking the past few months to start preparing my body before I no longer want to give any time to exercise due to this game taking up my every free minute 
---
Yeah it's not exactly the easiest.
---
If anyone is below lvl 60, they will pull the ram rider captain (who is a bid dick elite with a fuck load of health and damage).
---
The rep quest turn in guys always get pulled when defending the flag cap, due to all the alliance ranged standing near them. They have a gazillion hp, and keep you in combat.
---
Plus the skip jump can be severely stalled by a few alliance mages and hunters. I've seen 2 that has held back 15 by harrassing. 
---
Alliance can easily stop the Zerg to either force a turtle or buy time for their own rush.
---
Sorry!
---
I leveled as arms in vanilla and leveling was probably the most fun thing I did outside of pvp. 
---
I viewed it not as a grind but as a challenge that needed to be overcome. So I always kept first aid leveling in tandem. I kept plenty of food. And I also kept an up to date good 2h as I leveled. 
---
I actually ended up grinding mobs for a ton of the time because playing as a warrior is sooooooo fun! 
---
I can’t wait to level as warrior. It’s gonna be a blast. 
---
If grinding mobs is your thing - satyrs are the best mobs in the game to grind. They usually have decent drops and are easy to tear through. They also drop cloth if I remember correctly, so you can keep a good flow of bandages. 
---
Nope, plenty of other raid bosses. Contrary to popular belief, you can manage to get quite far in raiding. However, its not for the faint of heart and demands you to put in the effort. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play. If you want to learn more about it, I am available to talk.
---
You mean a massive statue of Baron Revilgaz!
---
DKP is for people who want to snack good items to then leave for a good guild. Loot coucil all the way.
---
Finally a casual player that admits he can’t play wow properly cause he has made a choice. I wouldn’t play at all as any amount is taken away from time spent raising children. 18 year contract 24/7 my dude. Good luck. 
---
Defense in AV is interesting because the map isn't nearly as mirrored as WSG or AB and each faction has different advantages.  
---
Alliance have crap for forward defensive options but a stronger base defense.  
---
On the other hand Horde have much stronger forward defense options, the two foward towers are much closer and provide some over lapping fire.  And Galv is significantly tougher than Belinda which means horde can do some serious harassing there, also with better tower support.
---
That’s a good idea. I’ve been not eating the best since my GF got pregnant and had our Daughter 7 months ago. At least if you’re working out and taking care of yourself while you play Classic it won’t be as bad as being an unhealthy fatty.
---
Many classes recieved major and minor reworks, such as Druid, Paladin, Hunter and Priest in TBC.  I don't think that's grounds for taking those changes and forcing them to fit into Classic.
---
Those changes make sense in the TBC environment, not here.
---
That’s not a straw man, your being pedantic over why the first half quit.  
---
The game hasn't even released yet and you're saying they quit because of X. Dude. Stop.
---
Lots of great replies, thanks everyone. If this sub is any indication of what the classic community will be like it should be a good time.
---
About level 50ish (I started playing a month after launch, so people were already 60, raiding etc.), there was a great poster on the old WoW warlock forums who wrote a good post about why most raid gear is dumb, and you should look at this set instead and then went on to describe the "Stratholme Blues", and as spellhit wasn't a thing until ZG, it was stacking raw +dmg 
---
Diablo 3 seasons only worked as long as they did because they changed the classes every season which changed the meta and gave people a different experience each time, and class sets were super easy to obtain. As soon as they slowed down how many changes they made each season the meta stayed roughly the same and it became stale which led to large drops in players.
---
The draw to Classic, for most, is that it is going to be an unchanging vanilla experience. Seasons goes directly against that.
---
[I gotchu fam](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ihwsx/the_classic_wow_exercise_program/)
---
lmfao such a childish response.
---
That's interesting. Is that with awesome gear?
---
Yes they do. BoA is amazing for tanks and every good guild will have the MT get it first.
---
Offtanks practially doesn't exist though and they have no prio.
---
I think one of the main diffs is that Spriest goes OOM extremely fast compared to TBC. You will be great at 1v1s, but after one fight you are completely OOM. So battlegrounds can be frustrating when you spend half your time drinking. 
---
he's so edgy lol
---
Not really, I have a few epics from 1 MC run and 1 ZG run and thats it. Still have a few greens and no decent trinkets.
---
Aside Horde Racials for PvP, Alliance always seemed like "easy mode" in general.  Too many safety nets to fall back on.
---
The maintank gets everything he points at first. Everything.
---
That means BoA &amp; DFT and probably even first weapons like viskag/deathbringer.
---
Of course this will vary guild to guild, but imho: 
---
Tanks should take precedent on Tank gear (Tier1 &amp; 2 Set, Lifegiving Gem, Styleens'), typically with the MT being defaulted the gear, then OT1, OT2, so on, with DPS Warriors bringing up the rear.
---
DPS gear will be the contested items. As mentioned specifically, Band of Accuria, and i've seen Wristguards of True Flight, are beneficial on both sides of the coin. Increased TPS from a Tank allows for higher potential Raid DPS, faster Boss kills, less consumables required if the previous is true, ect.
---
In Vanilla WoW, I dont think there would have been much debate. Tanks get Tank Gear, and have access to DPS gear after the DPS are outfitted, and vice-versa for DPS receiving Tank gear.
---
For Classic WoW, with 13+ years of data, pservers that this has been tested on over and over, and a generally more knowledgeable player base, I think we'll see more Tanks receiving priority on key DPS pieces for the sake of TPS and overall efficiency. Again, this will be guild by guild, and a more semi-casual or non-progression based guild may follow a more Vanilla loot distribution system. 
---
For those in a progression driven or hard-core guild, my thoughts go out to all the DPS Warriors and Rogues that will be made salty by this.
---
The first meme I have seen in weeks that is a nice meme.
---
Going in and out of Shadowform will really hurt your Mana Pool during combat. Activating Shadowform used like 15% of your mana or something like that if I remember correctly.
---
And you can't cast healing spells in SF, you likely knew this already... You can certainly stay out of SF and heal but you obviously not having the majority of talent points in Holy or Disc will really hurt your output, and likely be noticed by other healers.
---
Shadow Priests brought a really good debuff that they added to enemies if I remember correctly. Reduced shadow resistance on the target with something I think, which really boosts Warlocks damage. So bringing even one Shadow Priest wasn't unheard of in Raids.
---
I say, play what you want and dig into the class. People will take you regardless I bet...
---
Lol banned for casting your spells.  I think not dude.
---
I'm mostly giving the nochange community their rightful paddling. Me personally I think making it exclusive will protect the memory of the mount, but it still will never be the same "club" of people because it is a new player base who value the mount before it become rare rather than after. It will be waved around as one of the unofficial "achievements" of classic wow. I think 1 month seems almost unfair and 3 months seems too long given how few people will trade them in. If I had my way maybe the first 75ish per faction could buy a singular mount per account. But that is just an arbitrary number off the top of my head.
---
Flying mounts in Azeroth*. Creating specific zones/continent catered to flying like BC it was cool and had its place. There was no way flying wasnt going to become a thing at some point, but in a controlled and separate environment it could have been a cool niche while other important resources and cities remained in azeroth. 
---
I think flying in azeroth was such a horrible decision just trivializing  the entirety of the game.
---
different kind of snowball. i think op is talking about the christmas event snowballs, which used to knock people down. av snowballs used to knock people back, which is what you're describing.
---
Someone through one at my guild leader main tank one time while pulling Mac causing us all to wipe and the raid get cancelled. Vent was soooo dead when he asked who TF through it.
---
We all were like hooooooooly sh!t
---
Bingo, the more threat a tank can generate faster, the more total dps the raid will be doing.  Compared to any other melee dps or hunter with the same ring -- the raid only sees a tiny improvement to dps.
---
Same reason why even tho a fury warrior or combat swords rogue could make really good use of the DPS provided by TF -- A warrior with TF generating that much more threat means everyone can nuke harder.  But more TF's the better.
---
how much stamina did the average priest need for P4tChWeRk?
---
#somechanges?
---
This is offensive to my proud and noble heritage.
---
Where do i sign up?
---
It is not. You were only able to engage the boss once all towers and Galvangar were down. 
---
How do you consider the TBC environment to be different?
---
That's not how vanilla works.
---
“Hey guys, Frost here.”
---
*Unzips*
---
My prediction - the 1.5 and 1.8 crew would moan about how they can't ever get a queue to pop because everyone's taking the easy way out with the 1.12 way
---
no... it’s about WASD...
---
If this is the actual release date or even close to I will come back and give you gold
---
The issue isn’t that it’s unchanging, it’s about congregating like minded people to play old content together in a massive experience.  It’s the type of coordinated experience you can only set up at the server level.  
---
Even if someone DID coordinate this sort of thing on retail, there is never a new server launch, and no rules in place to stop someone from leveling past 60 and then roflstomping the people actually trying because the nature of people is someone is going to be a griefing dick about things. 
---
The big draw right now is a fresh start, server stability relative to pservers, and restoration of content that has long since been pruned.  This concept of classic as some sacred cow is ridiculous because we’re not getting Vanilla back.  We’re getting an approximation that is already taking a different shape.  
---
The issue with this also is there is a fairly decent quest-deadzone in the quests available to players between lvl 50 to 52 and again at 58-60 where you have to actually grind mobs.  
---
The AV quests filled this gap nicely, and now theyre taking it away.
---
Another one I'm looking at is one of those desk extenders. You leave your monitor, mouse and keyboard on it and then extend it upwards so you can stand and play. Standing is 50 calories an hour, baby. 
---
It's considered griefing, and I'm fairly certain people did actually get banned for doing that.
---
Yes, for sure
---
Yeah, but vanilla lasted 2 years. And we started to discuss it in guild, but like I said, if I was more active on forums, I’d have known the meta. 
---
NPCs were massive harder meaning you would have to kill them incase say one snuck up on your group. Would take a few people to kill them etc along with things like a troll boss in the open world you could fight but of course being out in the open both teams that decided on it would wipe eachother over and over.
---
1.12.1 a single level 51 can solo a whole pack of flag guards no issues. 
---
Basically you could rush with a pug in 1.12.1 so everyone does and will.
---

As long as they (horde) remember what they do to redridge they'll pay for it in hillsbrad.

Im a bit late to the party but I dont see it mentioned and I feel strongly about it.
---
Fazing: Such a terrible terrible decision that had impacts similar to what sticking people in a Garrison did. You used to be outside of Org/IF and every single person you saw was a part of your servers community. You developed relationships and made a name for yourself and knew other people by how they acted in game. In particular if you were in the PvP scene there were always people dueling outside and you began to learn who was skilled on the server. Fast forward to fazing being introduced and now the sense of community is killed because random players from a variety of servers are popping up in front of Org/IF or anywhere in the world and you begin to feel disconnected to not only them, but to any player on the server because the community has been infiltrated and trivialized.
---
I hate so much that they allowed this to go through and tear down what was such a pillar of what made WoW great, the ability to make a name for yourself and have an identity within your server and community. This also pairs with some changes like removing arena teams and making arena rating personal, also allowing to do arena across server.
---
Blizz was so naive to not think of how important the sense of community was to the game.
---
Switch out porn with two babies and you have the exact outcome! 
---
Combat Rogues had some decent talents to reduce/remove damage. The Lightning Reflexes and Deflection talents come to mind, those are early talents too. Also if you parried when you were 5/5 Deflection and got the Riposte Talent you would disarm mobs for a while which reduced their damage for that duration. Combat also had a talent that reduced Evasion CD by quite a bit so you had that answer more frequently in sticky situations.
---
Scaling was much different.  Players had a lot more health, a Mage would have easily 12k and didn't really do much more damage.  Sunwell geared Mages crit for 3k with Frost Bolt on players while you can do that in Vanilla without Naxx gear.  
---
Resilience had a massive impact on PvP, Classes were given much more defensive cooldowns and talents, double deterrence and no dead zone for Hunters, pain suppression and many talents for priests, cloak of shadows and last stand for rogues etc.  This means you can give Paladins an even playing field with any spec. 
---
It would almost be easier to list the things that didn't change.
---
&gt; ...making me farm it for a week end. Why? 
---
No one's making you farm anything, bud.
---
Maybe it was a failed piece of content.  But it was certainly a neat experiment!  And, as epic as the stories are, you could make a similar argument that any BG which takes 48 hours to end is equally as much of a failed experiment.  If anything, the best way to "fix" AV might be to remove the rewards from it altogether... it's the *players* who turn it into a PvE zergfest.
---
At any rate, there is value in preserving it as it was, for better *and* for worse.
---
Because we have sharding and loot sharing. Two massive changes to the game already. Then the fact when people talk about old AV they are not talking about the 1.12.1 everyone working at Blizzard knows that. We have drastic changes where they don't need to happen and no patch reversal where it does need to happen. 
---
Am pserver player, am 23.
---
So, are people misremembering that 1.12 AV will be a problem? Seems like the games will take about 20 minutes each, which seems reasonable. 4 hour AVs are fundamentally broken imo, though I never personally experienced them.
---
Ya ik 
---
This isn't actually true, otherwise things like project 60 wouldn't exist. 
---
Planning on leveling a warrior, could you elaborate on the Engineering make it a bit easier?
---
Thanks! :)
---
&gt; I remember when I played Vanilla and it would take me a full 14 hour day of gaming to get from 1-11, and that's in the Nelf zone that I was really familiar with.
---
Jesus! My last test run 1-11 was 4:03 ---- 20-21 needs 23,200xp, and my last run I was averaging a little shy of 19,000xph from grinding and with 3-4 quests mixed into the grinding session, it took 53 minutes.
---
Don't forget his bank alt Maybe.
---
It only takes your 40 to turtle to turtle. You don't have to contact the opposite faction lol
---
You should simply look up the policy on griefing.  It's not a secret.
---
What crossbow is that?
---
They should just have both versions. Theres pros and cons to both, even though id say theyre both failed experiments.
---
AV will eventually be barren no matter what.
---
You need a healthy amount of players for days long AV to even be a thing because people NEED to be constantly filling the empty spots or the BG is over. Like WoW's popularity in the first place when AV came out it was it was like nothing else you've played, so of course people were going to spam AV and fill matches up constantly. Not to mention it was brand new in 1.5. 
---
I do not think that we're going to see the same amount of people per server queuing for AV like you did in the past because its already been done. It's no longer new. I'm willing to admit I'm wrong and I'm in the "I'll play whatever, but don't be mad cause this was obviously going to happen" camp but I really think people aren't realizing the amount of power a new feature has.
---
You're running the risk of it being too easy to zerg or requiring groups of people to constantly queue into something for it to be viable.
---
Oh look a  guy who gets his information from the Classicast guys while not telling you that is cross realm BG's. The other team didn't engage buddy.
---
Quite a bit of leveling in Classic is walking or waiting. The kill speed of warriors is probably closer to half of a hunters kill speed, but the hunter has to walk from A to B too. Sure he does both faster, but still.
---
CountdownToClassic.com
---
I don’t know about anyone else here but every day I get home at 6 after work and the gym then have dinner until around 7 so I have a two hour window to game from 7-9 before I have to go to sleep before I wake up early to grind it out at work. Oh and I have to work 5 hours over the weekend so it’s going to be doable but if that’s the schedule for a single 25 year old it’s going to be real rough for a married man.
---
I would consider it more to boil down to WotF vs shadowguard / hex, and the latter two are much more impactful. 
---
Av won't be on release
---
Not so much a "what should I play" question as this is a "how should I play it" sort of angle.  Apologies for the minutiae.
---
I'll be playing a Warrior, and I'm interested in primarily tanking 5 and 10 man dungeons.  *Maybe* casually pugging some easier raids as an offtank.  I'd also like to be able to PvP.  To that end, I've created this Arms/Prot hybrid spec that I think will do the trick:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSczf9AEATAD8ADA
---
Where I'm uncertain are in the exact allocation of some of my points.  Spitballing some ideas around:
---
* Would it be worthwhile to drop 5/5 Two-Handed Weapon Spec and instead finish out Deflection and Imp. HS?  
---
* What about Toughness, Imp. Shield Block, and Last Stand from Prot?  Considering dropping 1 point from Defiance to put in Imp. Shield Block at least.  If I dropped all of them to get Last Stand would my threat be too low?  
---
* I don't want to lose those 5 Fury points in Cruelty, but I can if there's more I need to get in Prot.  Thoughts here?  
---
* If I'm offtanking a pug raid, would a reallocation to pick up Imp. Thunder Clap be worthwhile to help support the MT by keeping that debuff up?
---
Specific questions, I know.  Thanks in advance for any input here!
---
"No one's making you farm anything, bud."
---
Have you seen the rewards? You don't "need" to farm it but, you would be a fool not to.
---
"Maybe it was a failed piece of content. But it was certainly a neat experiment!" 
---
I agree with this which is why I hate the fact they are using the 1.12 version. The 1.12 version was Blizzard accepting that their experiment failed. So they nerfed it into a pinata. That's my whole thing. At least some people like 1.15 the 1.12 defenders only seem to exist to the extent they don't want to do the 1.15 version. Which is not a good argument for completely gutting content. At least not in my mind. In 2005 I could have been okay with 1.12 AV because it's just  stop gap. In this snowglobe though. It's not a stop gap. It's a final piece of failed content.
---
No that's how it's always been but you are just looking to be angry because a hashtag rubbed you the wrong way I guess?
---
My lesser heal was landing for about 700
---
For patch, none. For almost every other boss (and trash) I needed a fair bit.
---
That's just not true. For a long time protection was really bad shield slam wasn't even implemented into the game until 1.6. Most people used 31/5/15 even as the main tank. Eventually prot got buffs and it was alot more common.   
---
That being said I tanked raid nights as fury when our MT or OT couldn't make it. The only difference was the dps had to hold off longer because I didn't have defiance or a thunderfury like they did.   
---
"Blue" gear drops all the way up to AQ20 minus ossirian and also all the way up to R10 and D2 sets.  So, youll be busy for a while.
---
1.12 you can easily kill van with all guards up. Every team will still kill Bel because that's what they do on retail bit we will very rarely see a tower capped by a large force. 
---
The vicious yet unending circle of gank 
---
I would prefer 1.5 AV as a non instanced zone that resets on a timer if one side wins, and 1.8 AV as the battleground.
---
Actually, I did more thinking in it. I don’t remember people coming into MC in a random assortment of mismatched blues. People were showing up mostly T0. Nowadays, that’s not the case. That gear is simply inferior to random blues that have +def, and people are increasingly prioritizing TPS. Maybe our servers were that different, but to say “theorycrafting was available as soon as beta ended” is plainly false. The developers themselves said that they themselves didn’t understand itemization, and that’s why many classes dub their T1 or T2 sets garbage. 
---
This, they may have a game or two okay, fun... but they will have dead queues 99% of the time
---
&gt; think 1 month seems almost unfair   
---
&gt; If I had my way maybe the first 75ish per faction could buy a singular mount per account.
---
I don't see how this would make it more fair. If anything it only makes it more exclusive as I'm expecting more than 75 people to ding 60 within a month. It would also be a lot harder for Blizzard to do this, than just removing it after x amount of time. 
---
The point of exclusive mounts is that not everyone is gonna be able to get it. If you want the mount you'll have to put in the work same as with everything. I think most people on here are working grownups or they're in college/uni. It's not supposed to be fair to everyone, it's supposed to be fair to the people willing to work for it. 
---
Really sick of the gatekeeping with regards to the "Right" way to play AV.  Some want to zerg, some don't.  
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there's a loud vocal crowd that tells anyone that likes to play tactical or "turtle" AV that they ruin it for everyone else.  
---
I wish the reward structure were different where the "optimal" way to gain rep is quick wins/losses.  As this encourages people to ignore the actual gameplay and just focus on rewards.  Personally I mean, who doesn't like epics, but more often than not I really enjoy AV where multiple relevant objectives are contested and the teams are trying to organize and win. 
---
Lol. You sound like your bad at playing hunter, stick to rogue m8.
---
You contradicted yourself here with your mage example.
---
So the rewards didn't come fast enough? We are trying to escape modern wow man...

---
Shouldn't be changed, but yeah it is dumb as shit it doesn't. Design oversight for sure. 
---
As long as your wand is decent you can kill mobs easily as a holy priest. Even while leveling as a shadow priest you're going to be using your wand 95% of the time to save mana. You basically cast your shield, DOT then wand the mob to death. It's not exciting but you can chain mobs one at a time indefinitely. You'll only have to stop and drink if you take on more than 2-3 mobs at a time.
---
I wanted to play shadow at level 60 too but ended up being stuck as a holy priest. The problem is getting good gear which you need as a shadow priest. In raids you're stuck with getting the healing gear unless all of your caster DPS have everything they need. The PVP gear is decent but even getting to rank 10 takes a lot of time so you'll pretty much have to stick to PVP for a few months.
---
&gt;It's boring and horrible and no one likes it.
---
Okay.. so don't play it?

Bankers are a lower level and can be killed with a banished infernal easier. 
---
Reading through the Doc now, very interesting, as someone who never got into end game raiding it's cool to see the mechanics of receiving loot laid out. So thanks for sharing, quick question though. 
---
In the beginning of page two an "SK List" is mentioned, what does SK stand for in this context? Thanks! 
---
I’ve read a lot about that. Guessing spirit tap is a must with high spirit gear for battlegrounds? Or is the trade off with Dps not worth it? 
---
Are there any tricks, like using downranked spells or consumables/buffs I might be forgetting about?
---
As for raiding I don’t really care about that. I’d love to do some raiding with a more casual guild but I’m not going to be online for long periods of time every single night.  (Won’t be online during the day due to work) 
---
I’d happily respec to heal raids if I they allowed me to roll for DPS gear instead of healing gear but that probably won’t happen unless they are desperate to gear up their healers maybe? 
---
Side note: what about professions? My plan was to take up tailoring (cloth is easy to get as drops right?) as I will be using some of the crafted gear endgame and leather working purely so I can skin enemies to sell at the AH. (Would mining/herbalism be better or is it more time consuming?) 
---
Another thing to think about is that if you are leveling with feral and healing instances as druid, your instance gearing wont really help your leveling, unless there's not a leather dps, there is but they don't need the item, or you are a dick and roll against them even as a healer.
---
Ok cool so AV is not worth the time just don't do it? Get loot elsewhere. 
---
I suggest you actually read what you just posted.
---
"Killing THE ENEMIES OF YOUR RACE AND/OR ALLIANCE (faction)"
---
Meaning you're free to kill players on the other team, not use exploits to kill your own faction in their capital cities...
---
He's completely misunderstanding what reinforcements are if he thinks that makes it a PVE zergfest.  If the win condition is reinforcements, that literally means "kill this many of the enemy to win", which has nothing at all to do with PVE.  
---
The only way you can claim it's PVE is by remembering that the mines grant you reinforcements.  That's the only PVE element of reinforcements as a win condition.
---
The "main win-condition" is and always has been to kill the enemy's boss.
---
Pre nerf npcs were harder to ignore, slowed down 'the two ships' and encouraged you to complete/fight over tasks. It doesn't fix it, but it makes it more likely -at least from my experience during retail vanilla AV
---
The best (worst) part, is that a non enslaved infernal kills questgiver civilians. So it's a way to clear those guys out so you don't get a DK.

I dare say C’Thun will be a pain in the arse this time around as well. Sure, ”everyone” knows the tactics now but that info was available back then too. Still tricky to just get all 40 in the room without insta death
---
The "newcomers" are definitely an unknown variable that will help determine the success of this project.  I keep asking why wouldn't the younger generation today find this game as interesting as we did?  I know that generations change, technology advances, etc etc, but I have a feeling that there will be a significant windfall of newbies to the game joining us.  I hope I'm right.    
---
Sauron’s mate? 
---
That is where the quest is. IIRC the doomguards in DM north drop it.
---
Why do you have to disagree with other people’s opinion and make me question everything lol 
---
God damn vanilla brain hardcore min/max raiders rulning my snowball fun! ;)
---
Can't identify the contradiction.
---
Maybe AV just isn’t your thing. I enjoy it. 
---
You think that comment I responded to was logical??
---
And how is buffing ret going to take away uniqueness? By actually making ret viable you’ll actually see more variety of classes, you make no sense you’re just like every other scared die hard classic fan 
---
Lies!  Shamans never wished for such a thing.  We already had every Alliance dickhole out there screaming for us to get nerfed, why would we want to exacerbate that problem???
---
Haha I've been debating shadow priest or druid HARD so... I love undead looks and animations but trolls make a bad ass shadow priest to the point it's almost uncontested for pvp really. Shadowguard proccing blackout is just nutty, and it has a 100% spell coef
---
Dont forget too the proc rate for D1's 6pc is lower than D2's 4pc.  
---
Also, as I have played on private servers.  Many rogues swear by 4xD2 + 5xT3 for optimal energy gains.
---
It just gives tons of utility to a class that normally has none.
---
Crowd control, mind control, nets, rocketboots, stun grenades, ability to rez people, battle pets, huge range spell etc.  
---
Obviously you'll be greatly increasing your leveling time by keeping your engi skill up so it's not worth it to everyone.   I personally prefer being tip-top badass at all levels on a warrior.  Instead of being someones free HK out in the world you can wander around with confidence that you can engage two people at once, or escape unmolested.
---
&gt;That definition doesn't include using exploits/oversights to kill your own faction
---
It literally does...
---
I don’t really understand most people’s complaint that it’s slower. I can actually do 1-12 with a Warrior faster than any other class because mobs literally can’t damage you quickly enough to kill you. After that, you bandage every 2 kills. The biggest things that slow it down is 1. You can’t win a PvP fight against an evenly leveled character until 40. Even then, many still beat you. 2. You don’t get a runspeed buff. Slowest class in the game movement speed wise. Warriors big flaw is that you have to grind mobs below your level, which eats into XP gains. 
---
Personally i hope they don't go crazy with fresh servers. A fresh server coming out even once a year could destroy the communities of other servers. After a few years, i would think like 3 or 4, would be ok to open up a new server, by that point people who want to progress a character all the way to nax has had the time to do so. Adding a server post bwl for example would lead to everyone below 60 jumping servers ( if player base behaves anything like they do on ps), causing guides building rosters for MC to collapse. Classic is not retail you have time to catch up, it's set in stone your not running a treadmill, enjoy your journey, go home again :). I hope people realise there's not a need for seasonal servers. 
---
1ms response time is only "necessary" for FPS games imo, and even then, a 7ms screen would be playable. For WoW it won't make a difference. Just curious, why does the screen need to be &lt;22 inches?
---
Your reading comprehension is shameful.
---
Lol for abusing unintended interactions. Yes. You can get banned. Same reason you can be banned for "using your movement" in wsg back when there were wall exploits. Just because it's possible to be done doesn't mean you aren't abusing something. Hotfixes take time to roll out and I believe infernal being banished was one of them. 
---
There’s a guy on pserver who speed runs 1-60 in less than 5 days on a Warrior. 
---
If you're interested in ever playing any other PC games, definitely get a 1ms monitor.  Slacking in this area probably wouldn't be a big deal for WoW though.  Can probably save some money here, but if you ever play more games later you might wish you'd gone with the 1ms, so I'd say better safe than sorry here.
---
I've gamed on a 60hz monitor, a 144hz, and currently a 240hz one.  The jump from 60 to 144 is quite nice.  144 to 240 is noticeable but not quite as big.  A lot of people will tell you that moving up to 144hz is this insane experience that will blow your mind.  In my experience though, it kind of worked backwards.  When I made the jump up to 144, it was nice, but not particularly amazing... until I tried to go *back* to 60hz and it felt like my eyes were being run over with a cheese-grater.  For WoW, 60hz is fine, 144hz would be better, but beware spoiling yourself!  240 is probably wholly unnecessary.
---
Keep in mind what ports your video card and prospective monitor has!  It would suck to get a monitor with HDMI and DisplayPorts if all your video card has is DVI and VGA, for example.
---
As a rogue I used to jump off the cliff of Lumber Mill during an intense battle and once in a while someone would chase me off and I’d shadowstep to another player back on solid ground.
---
I was thinking it looked like a good choice. Most people seem to argue that Undead are much better tho. Do you have pvp experience in vanilla wow as both btw? 
---
Druid is my second choice, thing stopping me is not being able too pew pew that well in PvP 
---
It's a good plan, would only work once or twice though. If the other team tracks down and kills the 10 then it's a bust, 10 not being enough to hold down any graveyards for themselves. Then turns into a 40 v 40 turtle, until someone says "Just let them win so we can get back to racing them."
---
Mostly though, the issue is if you want anything but a race it requires planning and agreement from the team. With tougher NPCs a small number of good players could have a big effect on the result. With 1.12 a small number of players doing anything but racing can change the result too, but the change would be to turn the match into a guaranteed loss.
---
Heart of the wild druid spec can do everything except maybe tank dungeons- but if you get enough tank gear you'd be in good shape. 
---
Great flag runner in WSG / hybrid healer in AB or AV.  AV can be fun to find some rogues or other druids and try to ninja some towers.  Pretty easy to kite the elite outside and root it while someone else kills the archers/caps the node. 
---

I never said people don't exist that favor the opposite.

Wait, this isn't FF14...

(Eye for an Eye is a healer buff in FF14)
---
I’m a very well-meaning priest. If I could res horde, I would. I just want to bring peace and healing into the world.
---
But if you’ve ganked me 3 times in a row, you **are** getting mind controlled in the worst possible way imaginable, because you’ve forfeited your right to neutral-faction friendliness. 
---
Trying to hoard all the hunter gear, I see
---
I enjoyed Priest. You have a bunch of CC options and are tankier than 6/8 other classes (assuming shadow spec). It was really fun. My least favorite class to level was Druid. 
---
I’m sure they’re going to launch classic BC servers at some point, and charge 40$ to transfer your classic character to them.  You could always level on the BC server for free, of course, but who wants to deal with that headache?  Otherwise, you’re looking at 2000$ for every 25 people rushing at open to get those server firsts, and a steady stream from there on out from people looking to level their characters “authentically”.  
---
Why would they slow it down after its been sped up?
---
&gt; The people who play classic and stick with it past the first few months will arguable not be people who want ‘quick av wins’.
---
If the private server community is any indication, they are definitely going to be mostly people who want quick wins for that sweet BiS loot. Then they never step into AV ever again.
---
Its really surprising people in this thread are.saying UD. it's kind of accepted troll is a superior shadow priest for pvp due to hex reducing healing done which is invaluable in pvp (only rogues warriors and hunters have this debuff) and the fact that shadowguard can proceed 3 stuns with 1 spell cast - not to mention it's 1:1 coef and the fact that zerking is actually good for emergency heals and faster mindflays. 
---
I have experience from classic back in the day, but trolls were a very rare choice for shadow priests.
---
Look at the abilities on your own, it's pretty obvious why trolls are so much better - WotF is great vs priests, warlocks, and warriors who can fear you. Shadow priests have very comfortable matchups versus all of these 
---
I’m at the gym reading this Reddit right now 😎
---
I recall seing some message from vanilla that said mana drain shouldn't work on druid in form (except travel form probably since the mana bar is still there in this form). 
---
Just saw a 2008 thread that said it worked that way by doing a really quick search so you would have to search for changes before wotlk on that to be sure.
---
Transform can cost way less if the druid have the talent.
---
If you bank rage when grinding, if you accidentally pull 2-3 mobs you can still usually take them. After level 40, warriors want to often fight 2 mobs at a time. 
---
If you have time to hit rank10 and get exalted with BG factions then you have time to raid...
---
I would like both very old class Balance and progressive itemization but it **lots** of work and we all know own Blizzard are the most workshy company on the planet. Reverting AV is also work granted but way less than everything else. Everyone lets some stuff slide like ninja loot tool and sharding but I don't think we should let AV go. 
---
why?
---
I agree 300% with this post. Everything the OP has said is 110% true. Hunter is a terrible class. Please don't roll a hunter so I have an easier time getting raid spots and gear.
---
seems like sarcasm to me trying to make a joke about no one else going hunter because its op
---
As response to all the people talking about Ravenholdt rep, you couldnt get rep for it from random Syndicate mobs. I remember on my Paladin, I had all the factions in my Rep tab, except Ravenholdt. It wasnt like on pservers where you can just click on a faction member and the rep would show up in your tab, you had to actually gain or lose some rep for it to show up. So I killed 1 Ravenholdt member to put me Unfriendly to get them on the list, I went to go kill some Syndicate mobs, but it didnt do anything. Maybe some of the unique named mobs give rep, but not just any Syndicate member.
---
&gt;Maybe our servers were that different, but to say “theorycrafting was available as soon as beta ended” is plainly false
---
But it's not though. Im sure plenty of guilds were clueless for a long time but that doesnt mean theorycrafting wasnt being done from the very beginning. Some guilds very much did understand how itemization affected raid performance, and would at least attempt to increase their raid DPS.
---
Example: This is one of the first Ragnaros kills in europe. Look closely and you can see that casters were clever enough to figure out that deviate fish gave Rapid cast, and they are exploiting this debuff to increase their damage.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCb8Lg6G59U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCb8Lg6G59U)
---
This suggests to me that some guilds were much were understanding the basic principles of itemization, if not really thoroughly and in depth. Even on my very first character a, mage which hit 60 some months after release I understood the importance of spelldamage over intellect, and I was already looking for spelldamage pieces before I even hit 60.
---
They could literally add them manually since it's not a massive system. 
---
You fundamentally misunderstand how to grind on a Warrior. 
---
It's also a ret pally talent.
---
Not 13?
---
Fun.
---
1.12 was not an experiment. It was an acceptance of failure. They just nerfed it into nothing. So people wouldn't complain while they worked on fixing it. That was a choice that made sense in 06 because  07 was going to come around. It makes no sense to drop a complete piece of failed content into a snow globe that will never change.
---
5 months ahead of you my dude. Get the habit as early as possible so I don't lose it come Classic release.
---
And it's a discord mod too LOL.
---
I'm curious, is this a legal contract and if so... how is that legal lol? Or just a personal one between you and close peers/family?
---
Fury warriors with good gear and consumables are some of the best grinders in the game, paired with a paladin i think its the best non-aoe grinding combo, and gives aoe a run for its money because theres no downtime and the single target dps is crazy. I made tons of gold and had lots of fun grinding the wetlands whelps with a fury warrior on my ret pally. 
---
Same. My daughter is the best thing to ever happen to me. People aren't lying when they say that everything changes, but it's different than that. My life isn't much different than it was, but now I've got this cool little buddy who loves bears and elephants and watching Star Trek. Some days are hard and some are easy but when I see her goofy little one-tooth smile everything is worth it. 
---
Real.  I never set foot in private server MC.
---
I did run into private server resistances with the dragonkin in Burning Steppes.  Can confirm they are wacked.
---
As Blizzard has shown they are willing to take a second look at their choices. I see no reason not to state my opinion. If the game drops and this is what they go with. That is exactly what me and every other player will do. Farm exulted and forget it exists. I am not throwing a tantrum here this is just a pretty serious mistake that makes no sense if you actually take the time to think about it.
---
I L L E G A L
---
The idea is that it should not be any data that wasn't in vanilla, that it should stick to the design philosophy and hold true to the old tenents. With no modern problem solving. 1.12 is certainly the cut off point because past that it wouldn't be Vanilla data but that's about it.
---
You won the thread as far I'm concerned.
---
Because I want them to look the same. That's all.
---
How can they complain if they are all too busy corpserunning?
---
&gt; Clock-punchers don't get raises

Thats because all the level 10's go there and start by picking up the trogg quests. Pull a camp of 4 troggs and die miserably over and over.
---
Better start with the rat cleanup quests and proceed from there.
---
Don't buy a monitor just for WoW, it should be good for other games as well, in other words get 144hz screen.
---
Also, what is your budget? 
---
What are the specs of your system, can it handle 2k+? 
---
Do you already have a monitor?
---
Do you want two same monitors? Or maybe get a nice primary screen and a  smaller secondary one?
---
You’re spreading a false narrative that you invented. Where do you see that 1.12 was admission of failure and nerfing it into oblivion? Where is your research?
---
If you actually played back then you would probably remember that 1.12 actually injected some life into this battleground. People hated it, no one queued. Premades avoided it as you couldn’t group without a special add on which was technically against TOS.
---
This and cross-realms were designed to get more of a pug culture in BGs, address faction imbalance (was 5:1 alliance on my server) and maybe get some of these less touched BGs going for people who wanted to do them.
---
I love AV, just not this version. Of every version of AV they have ever made. This is by a mile the worst one.
---
Do you think we'll be able to kite Kazzak or do you think they'll keep the range limit on him?
---
No need. The bug on private servers is that the infernals fire damage aura is still active while it's banished. Banish is supposed to effectively remove the mob from the board so to speak, so any aura or passive effect the banished mob possess should also be disabled during the duration of banish.
---
&gt; &gt;That definition doesn't include using exploits/oversights to kill your own faction
---
&gt; It literally does...
---
Good job moving up the goalposts.
---
WhO

People will have their unstoppable force on the first AV weekend, then it's back to WSG. Except on AB weekends. Just like 1.12 was.
---
If you spammed snowballs at someone while they were on the tram between stormwind and ironforge, they would all catch up as they were running for the portal and the person would be spam knocked-down.

I almost lost a girlfriend over this.

Worth it.
---
Cool story. It's too bad you won't be able to do this exploit in classic because - hey guess what - it was an abused bug. 
---
*Space bar* 
---
Super bannable - players banned in wsg for wall jumping 
---
Which pserver? And solo?
---
Do you really need proof? Blizzard has always had the stance that griefing is not allowed when there dont exist proper ways to deal with the griefing.
---
I personally got a warning once when me and a friend kited the immortal mobs from Blasted Lands into Stormwind, causing the NPC's and guards to be stuck in an eternal loop of dying, respawning, trying to fight the mobs, and dying again until a GM came and removed the mob.
---
This was fixed in vanilla.
---
If you can only rally 6 like minded people you just handed the enemy the game on a platter. Also, strong NPCs reigning 400 dmg arrows down on your enemies meant fighting on home turf actually made a difference, and so did keeping the towers.
---
The main win condition in current AV is to get 3-4 towers down and kill the general. I've done probably 40 AVs in the past couple of weeks (finally knocking out the rep), and less than 5 have come down to reinforcements
---
The only thing that's bannable about MC is MCing people off boats because it bugs the poor sod that got MCed and they need a GM to get them unstuck.
---
gross.
---
"You’re spreading a false narrative that you invented. Where do you see that 1.12 was admission of failure and nerfing it into oblivion? Where is your research?"
---
False narrative? Are you serious? It was known and accepted for a long time how broken AV was. This isn't some wierd conspiracy I am pushing. The 1.12 Version was a stop gap measure. You have to remember during actual retail. They had a plate of crap to get to a mile long. AV was a big deal but they had way bigger fish to fry at the time.
---
"If you actually played back then you would probably remember that 1.12 actually injected some life into this battleground. People hated it, no one queued. Premades avoided it as you couldn’t group without a special add on which was technically against TOS."
---
I agree with some of what you are saying here but you are ignoring my point. 1.15 was disliked because it was too long. At the time blizzard had a crazy amount of stuff to do so they had no time to tune it. So they just hit it with the nerf bat. Which did make people happy because it allowed them to farm exulted in a week end. That way they wouldn't have to deal with the shit fest that is AV. for a long period of time. All I am saying is that it makes no sense to drop an accepted piece of failed content into a snow globe because they didn't have the time to tune properly.
---
I'm at work.  If he wants to post something of value, such as proof then I'll see that later.
---
A game like WoW has you playing way too many hours to immerse yourself in VR. What we've learned from the VR games we have is that it works best in small doses, and doesn't translate well to traditionally designed games.
---
WoW 2? I sure hope it's in the works at some level - and that it resets a lot of negative stuff retail has accumulated over the years. 
---
I never got banned for wall jumping in WSG.
---
check the number of the subscribers of this sub and compare it to the ones from retail wow.
---
classic will be a hype wave that will die sooner or later. it depends on your luck if you roll on server that will go bust sooner or later.
---
Haaahaha! Awesome!
---
Bu..but what about Tranq Shot?
---
Never really was a pally player. 
---
Yep, I really do.
---
You can get elven tarnished ring from a tribute run with same stats as BoA minus the stam.
---
If Classic WoW is your sole consideration, there are almost no minimum specs at all for your monitor. 
---
TLDR: If Classic and work are your only considerations, you only need to worry about resolution. If you have a pretty nice gaming rig and dabble in shooters or Rocket League or anything, aim for 1ms and 144hz. If your computer can't break 60 FPS anyways, you won't get any benefit out of higher refresh rates.
---
If you have a computer that is going to be pushing &gt;60 FPS, you need a monitor with a faster refresh rate to enjoy it. But.. its classic wow. It might look a little bit better but 60HZ is going to be more than enough. Refresh rate and frame rate matter most in highly competitive games where milliseconds can make the difference like Overwatch, Rocket League or Counterstrike. For WoW, anything &gt;60hz is a luxury.
---
Same thing with response time. I'd say your just being cheap if you get something with over 4ms time because thats just a shitty piece of equipment in 2019.
---
Since your using it for work though, the one spec I would fuss about is resolution. 1440p gives you way, way more screen real estate than 1080p on any size. It seems like pure magic to me. But I prefer working from home on my single 27" 1440P to my 22"/27" 1080p set up in the office. Feels like I can see way more, way more clearly. But at the same time, 1080P is still a very high resolution and the vast majority of people out there are still operating at 1080p and are perfectly happy.
---
Personally if I were buying two monitors for work and play, I'd get a pair of the Dell Gaming 1440p 24" monitors with the 1ms and 144hz, at around $380 a pop. If you drop down to 60hz you can find 24" 1440p for $200-$250 depending on the brand. Personally, I've got about a $1500 gaming rig so its worth it to me to have monitors that actually put all those frames to work.
---
its ok I'll just farm spiders in duskwood instead ..
---
Generally a guilds MT is the beating heart of the guild. He will get preference for tanking if the gear overlaps. That being said the guild has one MT and the dude earned his shit lol.
---
Then you didn't do it with the flag and you didn't do it to the fullest extent or you didn't get reported by the 19 people you were griefing. They absolutely put out bans for that, if just temp
---
I really think you’re conflating nerfing with admission of failure, when it actually increased activity in the battleground.
---
So what is the measure of success here? Participation? That’s the only metric I think Blizzard could use.
---

I didn't PvP much, but enjoyed seeing the carnage of people flagging themselves and fighting each other on the PvE server.
---
Given how close I sit to my screens it’s impraxtical to have anything bigger. I don’t think I could reasonably sit within a foot and a half with anything bigger but I’m happy to get your input on that.
---
That's what you get for going to redridge and not Westfall smh

Can't be real, they have too many macros.  That stuff was wizardry back then.

I've leveled both, rogue took more time.

/thread.
---
Here come the downvotes!
---
Honestly I don't think they did. However it's really hard to look at Av and think that blizzard didn't rig it for allies because they never won in pvp lol.
---
Wait, you're not doing the CRT Compaq monitor? It's part of the experience dude.
---
I would enjoy just relaxing nearly that first dungeon, over there by the shoreline, south of twilight.. and just capture entire groups going into the dungeon.   
---
1. you get the slowest guy
---
2. the bravest comes back out of the dungeon and you get his ass
---
3. the rest come out (minus the one smart one that just wants to start the dungeon) and you get them too
---
4. the slowest guy is back and makes a run for it.... and you get him again
---
5. rinse and repeat until they get smart and either all go in or all come after you together (and then you vanish)

not everybody works 60 hours a week ......

The screens should likely be all purpose but I would be playing some shooty bang bangs as well. Same screens, no real budget although need to be able to justify to wife, stand alone monitors because I will link them into my work laptop or desktop. Have no idea whether TN/IPS/etc is best. The last time I had a dedicated computer screen was when I was playing WoW in 2006 so anything will be an upgrade.

Not vanilla though

---
ings more then you could know.
---
Some of the dps gear is BiS threat gen items for tanks, Band of Accuria being the prime example.

If your tanks can't generate enough threat, then it doesnt matter how geared your dps is.

I need proof.  Literally any.

One of the benefits of “video game monitors” is that they seem to have all of the various ports whereas others don’t, but that is something I’m alive to. Thanks so much for your input.
---
It’s 40 hours with 2-3 hours of total commute 5 times a week. 
---
Does it do anything to anyone else?
---
I do not think this is the case. It is true that most devs at the time were Alliance and that did cause a few problems. Almost all the devs were full pve care bears. They didn't take pvp seriously. you really think they woulda left the stun resist and WoTF is they were really trying to flip the script?
---
I believe that it's Orc Warriors that can do this, but you can get gear that looks very much like the soldiers around Northshire Abbey.  Then just go stand around and wait for a level 2 to right-click you.
---
 No it hasn’t. And 1.12 IS VANILLA. Hell I would say for most people it is the only vanilla they know either from retail or all the private servers.
---
#nochanges was basically a bunch of the community whining and actually saying #justlikemyfavoriteprivateserver
---
And then feeling like idiots when people and blizzard themselves pointed out the things on the private servers were wrong.
---
I’ve played wow since vanilla beta, with only a break during cata, and the amount of times I see this community think they know something about vanilla but are completely wrong astounds me.
---
There is a reason AV was changed. I remember old school OG AV and while it did have its perks, and I can see why some liked the vibe it gave, it sucked hard core and there were reasons it was changed, because at the time of it actually existing people hated it.
---
People despised how long it took, and there was constant raging and how bad people were and how people didn’t push etc.
---
Regardless even if we had old school AV back (which version since *real* vanilla is whatever this community wants to bitch about that day) people would still Zerg it because players are better now and they realize even with tough npcs you can Zerg it.
---
The version of Vanilla we are getting is 1.12. Deal with it. They have lost everything but the 1.12 database. 
---
Let me say this again, every. Single. Thing. Will. Be. 1.12. *because they don’t have the info of the stuff prior to that*.
---
One of my favorite things to do is use a stun or interrupt on a mage that's AoE kiting.
---
&gt;I would like both very old class Balance and progressive itemization but it lots of work and we all know own Blizzard are the most workshy company on the planet. Reverting AV is also work granted but way less than everything else. 
---
I'm not sure if I would call blizzard the most workshy company on the planet, that title would easily go to valve haha.
---
However the fact they cannot get AV 100% like it was in the past is a very good reason for them to NOT change it. We don't want blizzard to start guesstimating on things in an attempt to make it accurate. That's just going to end up being a Frankenstein of a game like pservers. We should be rallying for the most accurate version of the patch as possible, what people were rallying for years since the announcement. 
---
Maybe once the game is released they can look at bringing back AV but I think it muddies the water to complain about it now when this was obviously going to be the route they were taking and what this sub and so many others proclaimed to want.
---
They all are great and they all can be abused.  I've seen all of them used effectively and horribly.

We aren't all losers that watch Blizzard influencers all day on Twitch and only people with a IQ under 75 would ever do the rank 14 grind. Vanilla is the most casual WoW there was. Raid like 6 hours a week, farm gold for a couple hours OR group to farm it in instances for respec and do whatever the heck you wanted the rest of the rest of the week, which involved kicking the crap out of rank 14's who were bad at the game in between their queues...

If Classic is going to harm your life you need to reevaluate that life and if you should even play Classic. WoW isn't the problem. You are.

Wow, the one thing is was looking forward to in Classic wow..

Neither was I and I mained a 60 paladin in vanilla.

Well it depends on if devs choose to go with 1.8 snowballs or 1.12 snowballs. The latter are more similar to current retail snowballs. The former would go across kalimdor but would take forever, while the new ones are thrown much faster because refined mechanics allow players to optimize their snowball throwing strategy. Personally, I wouldn't even be interested in playing classic if they don't use 1.8 snowballs, even though the devs clearly stated that classic will be based on 1.12. I remember how much fun I used to have when I could throw one snowball for hours or even days because of how long it's animation lasted. Snowballs were such a central part of my classic experience as a level 58 balance-feral hybrid druid that if I don't get 1.8 snowballs I'm going to go on every forum I can find to remind people how upset I am.
---
You can even troll your own faction. Use the stealth sound around a mage sitting down to drink, in STV, on a PvP server. Its hilarious when you get a reaction out of them like a nova + blink.
---
I mean, black is classy, for someone who wants something more understated, but it doesnt stand out, true.

I think I might just be communicating what I am saying poorly. Blizzards execution of the 1.15 AV was considered a failure. At the time they felt they either didn't have the time to make it work. Or that the concept was so flawed as to be unworkable. When they changed it to it's 1.12 version. 
---
That was never meant to be a final version. It was meant to be a crossable bridge for players to use. While they worked on fixing it more in TBC. What I am advocating for is that they take the time to make the 1.15 concept work. Because it makes no sense to freeze a stop gap BG that was never meant to last into a snow globe. Do you get what I am saying?
---
I was starting to worry, it's been almost 15 min since last post whining about AV...
---
No they haven’t. NOTHING. Is earlier than version 1.12. They are simply time hating content. They aren’t changing how that content was in 1.12.
---
20 minutes minimum, yes, so long as all attempts at recapping towers etc have failed.
---
By having good servers instead of having modern wow shard everything and everywhere to save money

Love it, Brit calling ZG: "Zed-G"
---
My mom threw out the old desktop and CRT. I told her it was bullshit and told her I wanted pizza pops and chicken nuggies and she said if I didn’t quiet down she would take away my good boy points.
---
Did you play classic? I didn't play much *after* classic so my memories of what happened are pretty clear. There was a patch cycle where flag carriers were griefing, wall hopping / exploiting to spots not intended. Blizzard put a blue post saying it was reportable and bannable. That's all I got 
---
Thank you oh grand mage of knowledge.
---
Price isn’t really a concern. I think those two dell monitors would be good but you don’t find them too big side by side?
---
Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting
---
It was I. I was always the slowest and got ganked. 
---
No RP-PvP realms, at least at the start.
---
Yes you can, but then you were asking why the guides were suggesting engineering for paladins, and then I said it's because it's the BiS profession for vanilla
---
Well, by this point it's pretty obvious you don't want to have a conversation, so it'll be my last reply
---
I am thinking about going with the dark horse underdog: Shadow Priest. I really want to be that niche class that people underestimate! Should be a good time.
---
Dropping Vael bet your shaman was buzzing with the red dragonscale shield awesome looking and a real swag piece when back in Org 
---
I believe simply that most people will realise after playing both, which one is more fun. Hard to know how many people do enjoy retail at the moment since we don't have subscriber numbers.
---
But one thing for certain is, Classic will be a monolith for many months after its release. Hype surrounding it has existed for as long as WoW has existed, pservers have been reasonably popular and have had a lot of controversy surrounding them (i.e. lots of people have been made aware of them and of the desire to play vanilla), almost all of the big twitch streamers got their start playing wow and their followers will no doubt be playing as well.
---
Remember, it was the game that changed the face of the world back when it released. With its old demographic growing up, and a new younger demographic in the market, it can very well happen again. People have chomped at the bit for a good MMO for years and it's gonna happen at last.
---
You’re advocating for them to work on and develop something new that was never part of classic, while it could work and become something better and with the original intent in mind, it’s a change, and I would argue Blizzard is sticking more to their word by not trying to patch together something new.
---
Elwynn to Westfall to Redridge. You must have patience before venturing too far. 
---
You can PvP perfectly fine in a mix of t.05/rank10/trash raid pug items.
---
The best PvP videos back then were from people in blues, not purples. Usually the PvP videos of full epic geared people were only high crit hilights, not entertaining at all.
---
Just make sure to level engineering and get all the gadgets. For Druid PvP you can go hearth of the wild (1/29/21) or you can go tri-spec 11/11/29 or something along those lines. Check out this video https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
Priests, I have no idea, never played one.
---
Rogues can purge everything by killing their enemies.
---
Yes but this community is a community actively choosing the path of more resistance... in most everyday cases you are right, sure. But when you take a minority group of players actively choosing more resistance your argument is more flimsy.
---
Sounds like you just don't know how to play AV as horde.
---
Learn by doing and start off by tanking Deadmines and all the other dungeons on your way to 40. If you do this you'll become a competent tank without having to watch videos on it.
---
Y'all talking about this xerg fest shit like it matters which version of av you get. If any of you guys played on pservers your know that even with pre nerf av 75% of av ends in sub 20 mins. On av weekend games are only 7mins. On tbc servers, there are still hour long games and the only reason they don't go 5 is because reinforcements. Im telling you no matter what vanilla version of av they use your gonna have 5 min games and 5hr games. That said there's reasons I personally prefer pre nerf av but the zergfest argument just doesn't hold.
---
But, you are still gonna enter from elwynn ;)
---
Bro, isn't it a bit excessive to post one of these every day? Aren't you tired of hating on classiccast?

Gotcha, thanks for the detailed reply!

Thinking about playing either a Paladin or a Rogue. I plan on playing with my friends the entire time in which I would want to support and heal them. I also want to play a rogue because once medical school starts back up I want to be able to just hop back on and pvp whenever. It fits my playstyle much more as well. Paladin leveling seems as much more of a timesink, but I’m also worried about how overpopulated rogues are.
---
Dang that's a huge disappointment, I was planning on going RP-PVP :(
---
Getting ganked on pservers is getting old, maybe I will just embrace my inner carebear and go RP-PVE ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Well, that at least simplifies the choice betweeen RP and RP-PvP.
---
Ian looks like the job is starting to get to him...
---
I have kids and I can attest that this is definitely not the case.  
---
Sure, I can probably scrape together 12 hours per week, but no more than 2 hours consecutively (and that's if I'm very lucky).
---
You're basically on-call when you have kids.  Anything comes up and you have to afk immediately for between 2 minutes and 2 hours.
---
That obviously will not fly in any raid, nor will it be fun even if it did.
---
Why wouldnt they just start with them and if the server doesnt have enough have people transfer? Adding after launch isnt really feasible since I doubt many would restart just for server type.
---
I was still wall jumping up the west side of the sawmill by the Horde GY, and up the center structure on the roof, and on the east roundabout off the map, and jumping through the tunnel log gate before the game started.... all still in TBC.
---
I don't remember the Vanilla fixes or any bans.  And the TBC fixes didn't come with any bans, which makes me very skeptical.
---
It also makes me question WTF did they even fix in the vanilla WSG hotfix.
---
Honestly this is a pleasant surprise to me. I thought RP realms in general were going to be too niche to make for Classic. It's a shame RP-PvP realms aren't planned, but I still consider this great news.
---
You're either a troll or seriously misinformed. Based on the username probably a troll.
---
No RP-PvP at launch is a bummer, but I'm happy they at least confirmed RP servers will be supported. Even if it's just one in each major geographical region, it's one less thing we have to wonder about.
---
&gt;It's boring and horrible and no one likes it. 
---
Citation needed
---
Hamstring is definitely legit :)
---
Rogues have Crippling Poison however which I think is a good substitute for them as well... 70% slow for 12 seconds is quite awesome I'd say.
---
Yeah I'm pretty disappointed here. I was also planning RP-PVP... PVP it is then. 
---
I'm lucky. Even though I'm older, 29, I've got no kids, a girlfriend but she's also addicted to games and will probably play, and a job that lets me work 1 day with 2 off (varies). The only thing I'm pissed about is that I have to bid for my holidays before the new year and we didn't have a release date. I get a chance to re bid at the start of each month to take any vacancies but we still don't have a damn date.
---
*cultivating mass
---
Calling out industry shills on their BS isn't "hating". Them using their position, that was only given them due to being unethical is hating the rest of the player base. They care about their queue times and "easy content" and about the influencers content who made them relevant, who found out about WoW in a closed room before press and players. Asmongold will be playing on a PVE server with screwed population. Him ruining one server when he doesn't even care about classic or the people he hosts shouldn't ruin the rest of the game.
---
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MItG0lyMeg 
---
^ That is your "literal god". He is a sociopath who is breaking Twitch TOS by hosting for a cut of the take in something he is pretending to care about.
---
Yes because clearly the OP is alluding to such items 
---
Was on Earthen Ring back in Classic. I moved to Thorium Brotherhood after that, and was briefly on Whisperwind for a minute before moving back to TB in Wrath. 
---
Iirc there were two. One was on the side of the wall near the middle of the map, but the most popular one was in the back of the alliance zone flag room, on the highest level. I never did it, but yea, it wasn't on buildings, it was very much a wall jump exploit.
---
Transferring *to* older servers is almost certainly something they want to avoid at all costs.  Even on live after the communities had already been 'broken up' because of LFD, raid finder, etc there was a fair amount of backlash at having an influx of new names you didnt recognize on smaller realms when they did mergers.  It was nice to have more players, but having to have the politics, etc of two different servers (or 3, 4, etc) merge was pretty jarring.
---
Doing that in Classic will likely be much, much worse because the community is (from what ive read/heard a billion times on here) much, much more important, and you know many more of the people around.  
---
That all being said, despite having no desire to play RP-PVP its kind if disappointing for the people that do want to.
---
Arenas are a dirty word on this sub, since they held all the PVP gear &amp; became the center of PVP, which mandated classes being balanced with 2v2 in mind instead of the "there's a niche somewhere" vanilla set
---
You allies have such an easy time leveling jesus what a baby faction. 
---
Yea, real bummer. Was planning on it just for a less crowded population and a less meme community which isn't inherently bad, but I think also pulls a lot of toxicity with it
---
No changes!  There were no RP-PvP servers at launch!  There shouldn’t be any at launch here!  #nochanges
---
When I'm gaming I sit at a similar distance, using a 24 inch monitor. Just big enough to fill most of my field of view and see enemies clearly. I'd say start looking at 24+ inch ones as that's when good response times and refresh rates become available. 120/144hz is amazing even if you're not playing fast paced games, but it's not a necessity. What kind of specs does your PC have?
---
I see both sides and don't think new servers every year or 2 would be that bad. If someone wants to join for that fresh vanilla experience you won't really get it a year after servers are up. I would disable transfers to new servers for the first few months at least to prevent them from being flooded with leveled characters. Ultimately I don't know if it's a good idea, but I don't think it's awful. 
---
If you want to pvp, alliance for sure. Paladins counter Druids very hard, and NE has better racials imo. Being able to shadowmeld while drinking and out stealth rogues due to improved NE stealth really completes the Druid package.
---
What’s the 1.15 version? Or do you mean 1.5?
---
Damn! RP it is then... with permanent pvp-flag though.
---
Oh, ~~I'm ~~ it's definitely gonna get ugly
---
I'm a bit worried about what a brand new 2019 WoW would look like. "Oh sweet I killed the boss and got a Super mega loot cache(locked). BRB Swiping my CC for $5 to get my loot. "
---
Would be great (exercise) to make pedaling activate running
---
sure
---
SL warlock is the #1 dueling class in the entire game, and has no hard counters. Mages are excellent as well, but SL locks counter mages harder than any other matchup in the game.
---
Mage is better in BGs imo.
---
idk why to go redridge at all. elwynn - westfall - duskwood. grind some mobs and do few dungeons before going fully dusk. or could always swap to loch modan and wetlands
---
We are getting 1.12. (originally released aug 2006). First RP-PVP servers were Sept 2005 so #nochanges for 1.12 would include RP-PVP.
---
Thank god at least RP realms will exist but that sucks hard for those who like PvP
---
I was thinking on paper trolls seemed the better option for pvp. Troll it is then. 
---
I think... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Sounds like a you issue, specializing in priorities. 
---
Maybe that contributed to your divorce. 
---
Awwwyyyeeaaahhh
---
AQ40 was really really looooong too and punishment for wiping was severe.  
---
If it's truly going to be what it was like back then, I can just imagine all the hate it will get.
---
Fun times ahead!
---
So stick them in a content bucket.  #nochanges
---
I do remember them being a pain in the ass during tbc actually. I’m fine with just BGs then. 
---
I haven’t taken a single PTO this whole year and don’t plan to until release, I do get 4 weeks and 4 floating
---
Holidays a year though. 
---
If I wanted to take my PTO to sit on my porch and do nothing I should not be judged for it. 
---
You don't need to sweat to do this, just need to know its possible and anyway i was talking about warrior's potential leveling speed not the average
---
OP asked about griefing. No better way to grief than duel someone waiting for their raid and remove their buffs.
---
Most recruits in the army are late teens early twenties. 
---
So I built my rig in 2020 with two very, very low cost 22" asus basic monitors.
---
Bought a 24" ACER 1080p gaming monitor with 144hz and 1ms for Counterstrike. For CS, it was a life changing upgrade, but for almost anything else was pretty meh. So I was at 1 24" and 1 22" and it seemed huge, but I was VERY satisfied with the extra 2" of space
---
2 years ago I decided I needed a 1440p and bought the 27" Dell Gaming 1440p. Now I'm using 1 27" 1440p and 1 24" 1080p at home, and a 27" / 22" at the office.
---
Having all that screen real estate at home, I freaking despise my one 22" monitor at the office now. I think shopping for new monitors I wouldn't buy anything less than 24" again, even for a dual set up. It does take up a ton of space but my productivity is through the roof.
---
Best I ever had it set up was stacking them with a mount, with the 24" over the 27". Unfortunately my desk broke in the move and can no longer support the stacking set up without tilting over but if your concern is cluttering your desk with a shit ton of screen space, DEFINITELY get a mount and stack them.
---
So... don't let that infect classic and you go ahead and stay on retail...
---
Nobody is hanging around with buffs. They're either grabbing them then logging off to wait for raid or grabbing them right before raid. Nobody is going to chill with buffs ticking dueling while waiting for their raid.
---
But isn't a 40-vs--40 "turtle" the *exact* same thing as an epic raid-vs-raid that we want? I don't understand we call it turtle once it's in patch 1.12 and epic battle when it's &lt;1.8.
---
I feel you man. I’m tired of this wait we should have had a release date by now. 
---
Bruh I'm a horde player, I just have an iq higher than 15 and know where to level.
---
"I don't really understand most people's complaint that it's slower... Warriors big flaw is that you have to grind mobs below your level, which eats into XP gains."
---
If you have a deadline just take it late September. We at least know it'll be out by then.
---
I feel ya on the release date issue.  My company just instituted a policy where you must give 4 weeks notice if you want more than 2 days off.  
---
I think its probably too early to expect a release date if the plan is July target.  They dont want to he wrong and have to delay.
---
I'm hoping for 6 weeks minimum but more likely 2 months before release that we find out.
---
I am going to click the shit out of this game 🤘
---
&gt; I also want to play a rogue because once medical school starts back up I want to be able to just hop back on and pvp whenever. 
---
A good holy paladin is also a blast in PvP. The ammount of support you can provide your team will always keep you thinking about strategies. It's not nearly as boring as raid healing, because you have freedom, HoP, dispells, stun, seals etc.
---
He has YouTube videos. Let me check. 
---
Crippling posion kiting isn't a thing because you use 1handers..
---
The concept of hamstring kiting is that 2handers are very slow and you can kite the mob while waiting for your attack to get ready, this means the mob only attacks when you attack, which roughly halves your damage taken. 
---
&gt;and it's going to be a severe hassle illustrating to my boss why this will be so important
---
Probably because it's not important.
---
That's not for you, or him to decide.
---
LMAO
---
Again, why the answer to fix a non-issue is more changes ?
---
Yeah classiccast and tipsout are total shills I hear you on that but Why the hell would they give you the 1.8 AV if they are timegating content?
---
Yup. I do hope all of the classic-bitchers that are infecting retail go to Classic and leave us alone. General chat is a bit toxic on that matter.
---
Well that's upsetting. RP-PvP rules.
---
How jolly dare you consider taking time of for your own enjoyment. Ridiculous!
---
Why? I said the majority will take the path of least resistance. One community that does the opposite doesn't hurt my argument. I'm one of the people who often takes less convenient/efficient routes in games, my own existence doesn't change my own observation. 
---
We're rolling with LC for weapons and trinkets, and DKP for everything else. I want to be able to reward players who do well in raids and go above and beyond in terms of crafting and Gbank donations, but I don't want to take all control away from the raid. I've found that people generally have more patience for the raid slog when they can determine how and when they get a few choice items.
---
We'll see how it goes. Once a bit of trust has been built up and we know eachother a bit better, we might switch to full LC for T2.
---
&gt; I was a nub so I didn't use any addons, so I didn't have the faintest clue about swing timers and hamstring strafing or whatever that weird mechanic is. I just tried my best to pull carefully - usually using a ranged weapon instead of charge - and I leveled Alchemy, Cooking, and First Aid so I had lots of healing options available to me.
---
It sounds more like a case of ignorance being bliss to me. You didn't know how slow it was compared to other classes. You didn't know how small of a toolkit you had to had compared to other classes.
---
Wish we could just stick you in a bucket.
---
I really wanted to play on a RPPVP server. The wPvP battles and guild v guild roleplay battles is an experience unlike anything in WoW. This is disappointing. 
---
We need RP-PVP. 
---
The community will be great on it 
---
What significant consequence is there if you don't match your pto with classic wow launch?
---
I don't know why people think you should have some grand plan for every time you take some vacation. I loved the summer days where me and my friend would hang out and play wow side by side. What's so wrong with taking a little summer vacation doing what I love?
---
I agree. What you want to do with your time is yours alone.
---
Hahahah :D
---
Gotcha, so one handers are faster but don't hit as hard so the whole kiting to wait for auto attack makes no sense for a Rogue and you need to stay in melee range the whole fight in order to kill it within a realistic time frame. Which means you're getting hit more often...
---
Am I understanding that right??
---
Why wouldn't it be important? It's important to him and his enjoyment. He should be able to take his 2 weeks and do whatever the hell he wants. Importance has nothing to do with it if it's his time.
---
The launch is a once in a lifetime event. Classic WoW will never launch again. When I first played WoW at launch I was 11 and had dial-up. I want to do it right this time.
---
For what it's worth, I take 7 days off (not including weekends) for every expansion launch. My friend brings his PC over and crashes on the couch.
---
It is. This is a joke.
---
Massive bummer! Really the main attraction of Classic wow for me was RP-PvP... Played a bunch on private servers and RP was the only thing missing from that experience, but PvE is just not an option on any level.
---
Strange all around, I would've thought RP-PvP would be more popular than RP-PvE in the first place because normal PvP is about twice as popular as normal PvE? Can anyone clue me in here?
---
&gt;A lot of people dont really ENJOY AV or BG's, they do it for the exalted rewards that are FAR better than anything else at that stage.   
---
PvP content shouldn't be designed for people who don't enjoy PvP.
---
Good luck with your life goals. You seem to have your priorities set.
---
Transcript for those that can't watch:
---
&gt;QUESTION: Will there be dedicated servers for Roleplaying on Classic?
---
&gt;Other guy: Uhm, I don't remember actually... 'cause I, I don't remember what the, the rate at which these things happen. I remember that RP-PVP wasn't added until quite sometime after Classic's launch.
---
&gt;Ion: I think, yeah, I think our current plan is to have RP realms certainly in the larger regions, uhm, where we have a range of realm types. I don't think we're currently planning on any RP-PVP realms in particular, because that's maybe a bit too small of a niche... but, we'll see how Classic unfolds once it's out there and certainly if, you know, there's a large population and demand for that server, for that type of server, that could support it, we'd be open to adding it. But, I think at the start, we'll have RP as an available server type.
---
&gt;Other guy: OK, cool, so that'd make Normal, PVP, and RP.
---
&gt;Ion: Yes.
---
I'm happy.
---
Don't mind me asking.. New to wow.. What is RP? 
---
That's a total HUGE disappointment. I truly hope they'll reconsider. Suddenly I'm not so confident as before :/
---
yeah if you do that then warrior might take less damage. if you dont bother then it should be roughly equal until warrior is full plate.
---
Then I will wait until they implement it some months later. My progress dill be so slow it wont matter..  
---
How do you feel about it now? I can answer any priest questions you got.
---
&gt;Why wouldn't it be important? 
---
It's a video game.
---
https://americanaddictioncenters.org/video-gaming-addiction
---
I thought that was pretty obvious. The significant consequence is missing out on an experience he enjoys?
---
This is true, but will people really keep demanding classic after 5 years of classic?
---
'Role play' you god damn peasant
---
Doesn't affect me but I find the decision somewhat curious. Not surprised we're getting some controversial news re: AV and server types though. Good timing for Blizz after the home run that was the 6-phase announcement. 
---
I'll be holding my breath for the rest of the week...
---
And that is all that matters.
---
I would rather they release a RP-PVP realm then wait and split the RP servers later on should they make an RP-PVP.
---
The only advantage i see in the long run to RP servers is that they could be kept together no matter what happens in the future. So it would be worth rolling there for that reason.
---
Still the idea that at some vauge future there could be and RP-PVP server and the server your on loses 25-50% of its pop is kinda a turn off as well.
---
Tri guy! 
---
So you're saying it is as important as getting the day off for the super bowl?
---
Damn this sucks... I actually don't know what server to go on now... I'm forced to choose between RP and PVP...
---
You clearly haven't read John Staats' book, You should give it go.
---
Same here. Dang it!!! 
---
I’ve taken nothing out of context, I’ve read every single word of your post and understand your stance. They’re basing the game around 1.12 . They only changed rollouts and gear to mitigate items being too OP, or making complete raids completely obsolete. As someone who played since launch, I’m ecstatic I won’t be stuck in 24 hr+ long AV’s.  Only thing I’ll be bummed out with is if they removed the quests that helped with leveling in the 50’s. And if they are, oh well. 
---
Are you kidding? I played both sides and Horde has barrens for safety for a long ass time, the 1,000 needles completely owned, most of ashenvale since only elves hang out in that side...and THEN you have ALL THE INSTANCES IN YOUR ZONES:  RFC, WC, SFK, SM Lib, SM Cath, SM Arms, SM graves, RFK, RFD
---
Holy shit you’re nuts
---
It is very strange that time off to pursue other hobbies is not treated the same. No one questions by husbands desire to have time off to drive pointlessly round wobbly circles. You don’t even get quest rewards from that!
---
Enjoy your life doing the things that make you happy, you are doing it right.
---
Lore maybe is his name?
---
Cool, pretty much what I expected. I'm sure there will be enough interest in RPPvP for there to be at least one realm per region.
---
But Momma' always told me Santa was a Tauren!
---
Let them know you have an interest in it. Make a post on the forums and attract people who agree with you so they can see it. I'm sure they'll have RPPvP servers up eventually.
---
Well if you can organize enough RP-PvP guilds to play on a PvP server you can have your own little sub community there. I know I've played other games where a few RP guilds played on PvP servers and seemed totally normal to me in our encounters, so they got along well with everyone. Aside from maybe transmog matching or whatever, they kept the RP private.
---
1024 x 768...
---
Looking at it using a 2560 x 1440 27" monitor, the world of Warcraft does look kinda... tiny :)
---
&gt; Yet when young people spend most of their time playing video games at the expense of schoolwork, physical exercise, family events, or social activities, the benefits of gaming seem less certain. 
---
You did read the article you provided correct? Or did you just link it after a quick Google search? If you can ascertain that OP is playing video games at the expense of categories that would qualify his behavior as addictive then you're getting somewhere. Otherwise there are several benefits to gaming. So let's not derail this here.   
---
You're judging what's important to another individual based on your own set of priorities that may or may not match the individual being judged. That aint right.
---
Lol you only need a group of rogues to cause a turtle--you just take their graveyard while they're doing Drekthar/Vandar.
---
Thanks for the kind words. :) I don’t neglect my job or social life for games, but classic wow has been very important to me. Without getting too personal my mom has been extremely sick for more than a year and a half now. It’s been hard but Classic WoW has been a beacon I can look forward to. 
---
Prefectly okay with this. 
---
Main char on pvp for the game, and one char on an rp realm sctrictly for rp'ing. Afaik RP-PVE realms are/were the ones where actual roleplay took place.
---
True.  But vacations are there for a reason - to recharge.  I doubt that will happen grinding 18 hours a day.  You'll just be burned out at the end of it.  
---
Never played WoW before WoD and can't decide between Shaman, Priest, Warlock and Hunter. I read all the life at 60 threads for them and still can't decide! Priest is one of my favorites in live so I might default to that. I like healing.
---
&gt; I thought that was pretty obvious. The significant consequence is missing out on an experience he enjoys? 
---
Let me look at what I said again.... Nope, can't seem to find anything about a superb owl in there. Sorry, can't answer that for you. 
---
&gt;it *enables* it
---
This implies that people don't zerg in 1.5-1.11 AV. They do on pservers. The problem is meta shift.
---
I think if we surprise blizzard at launch with enough players and people stick around they will add them.  Just like vanilla launch, they opened them up eventually.
---
Also the only difference between a PVP and RP-PVP server is literally just the name tag (&amp; maybe some behind the scenes GM stuff).  Maybe when a server list is announced, if enough people want to, just claim a server as RP and recruit RP guilds to play on that server.  It's not ideal at launch but the community could make this happen.
---
From all my warfront experience on retail I'd say if it wasn't mandatory then yes.
---
I disagree. I personally love grinding and the leveling experience in WoW. It clears my mind and puts me in an awesome mood.
---
Wow, awesome job.
---
So they finally got see-through water in TS4, as an aside?
---
Wpvp was always fun on PvE because many people werent really geared or specced for it.  I played on Medivh. 
---
I think there are enough fast paced games out there. Can't we let wow AV be slow trench warfare and just accept it in all its tedium and glory?
---
Exactly the same. You cant PVP properly on a RP server and RP on a PVP server is difficult due to the difference in mentality.
---
RP-PVP servers have always been my go to servers, because they cover all content.
---
But what if you're undead and haven't got any eyes?
---
Why are you on this sub and commenting on things affecting classic then? Kinda curious how that's productive for anyone when you are admitting you have no intention of playing unless its more casual like retail. 
---
There are people who played 15 years ago and would still like the long grinds to return. If it's hard for everyone, it's hard hard for everyone you know? You shouldn't get something amazing in Vanilla for a few hour investment. Grinds are long and should be done over the course of months, at your own pace. That's how things actually feel like they matter.
---
Achievements like rare epic mounts and epic gear should be more merit and effort based because that's how it was in Vanilla. As opposed to the RNG, timegating fest that happens in retail. The big difference is a lot of people might not be able to play 4 days in a row and then have 6-10 hours on another day. Well, modern WoW tells you to go fuck yourself because you pretty much have an hour or 2 of things you can do each day and not a single thing more. The casualness is a double edged sword.
---
There are plenty of people interested in RP-PvP. I and many others will be truly disappointed if we don't get that option!
---
I think “pleb” is the more appropriate term, but I like the cut of your jib. 
---
&gt;me and all my friend 
---
I know that was just a typo but made me laugh really hard.  ;P
---
Anyway, I do hope they don't leave out an entire server type due to lack of feedback.  We definitely outnumber the RP-PvE folks.  At least I have a RP server to play on though.
---
Exactly. This is a major blow to anyone that likes the game to cover all content on one server.
---
They could make 1.5AV a once per week event
---
But united we stand, and divided we fall. Think of the consequences!
---
The super bowl is an entertainment experience just like a video game.  
---
It only airs live once just like classic wow only launches once.  
---
Watching a recording of it later is not the same, just like playing wow classic one week after launch is not the same.
---
It seems to me that getting time off for wow launch is no more important than getting time off for super bowl party.  
---
That is to say that neither is important.
---
Think about it like this if you miss launch you'll also miss the sharding :P
---
Indeed. That'll be the only other alternative.  :/
---
They can't kill the boss until all towers are down.
---
For the first 6 months of vanilla sure dps warriors weren't really a thing. They had no instant attack bloodthirst so fury wasn't really a thing (except the for farming easy mobs). Then BWL came out and warriors got their revamp and people were trying it out. Another 6 months in after AQ and ZG came out it was well known fury warrior was one of the top dps in the game, most guilds would have at least 2 or more.  
---
In a game that launches with 1.12 talents and what we know now about mechanics and items it's safe to say warrior will be a top dps from the first lvl 60 5 mans right through to Naxx.
---
This is a MAJOR disappointment to me. I always played RP-PVP because it covers all content of the game. 
---
Please reconsider Bliz. RP-PVP is a server type that I believe a large amount of people are interested in.
---
I assume the term "turtle" was invented because it was a choice made by one team. If both teams are trying to advance but can't, it's more of a stalemate.
---
Oh, I won’t be missing launch, no matter what. 🤠
---
Hahahha it was a fun typo :)
---
Way ahead of you mate. Down 40 pounds since September.
---
So you're big point here is that activities that bring enjoyment are not important, therefore such activities should not qualify (or be considered) for time off from work?
---
Yeah, I'm just starting to run into this problem as well. Running out of time to let my boss know when I want to have time off beyond "during the summer".
---
He has been using his yearly pto to play wow for at least 7 years.
---
&gt; irreplaceable
---
Say that again, sloooowly, and give it one more thought.
---
Yeah this should be an easy push back... Blizzard should just release official pollings tbh
---
Whst she said was HUNG like a tauren...
---
Yeah?  Well the bucket store called and they’re running out of you!
---
I don't see where I asked about that. I could care less about how long he's been playing. I made the point that you judging him for what he enjoys is wrong. Not sure where you're going with this bud.
---
Am I remembering the order a warrior gets his skills correctly, and OP simply has done nothing with his action bar since learning each skill and the skill icon automatically being placed there?
---
I’ve got lots of desk room so two 24’s should be fine. I’m going to measure everything out again tonight and go on accordingly. The big problem is that the smaller screens seemingly don’t have the quality id like so it might be better to make a sacrifice for screen real estate over performance.
---
Well. I made a little poll on the Classic EU Discord ([https://discord.gg/SdVt9zN](https://discord.gg/SdVt9zN)) and well......check the result so far: [https://imgur.com/bvfULNO](https://imgur.com/bvfULNO)
---
This post drips with more passion than most categories on pornhub
---
Alliance closer to BRM + Alliance shorter Ony attunement + Paladin Blessings + Alliance majority in Classic + Deeprun Tram + Nicer looking Stormwind City + Alliance's advantage in AV &gt; Horde theoretically slightly faster to 60
---
And a title + birb
---
Dont really know how RP works but.. shouldnt pvp be more canonical to roleplaying anyway?
---
I’ll probably be getting a new PC down the road (not that WoW will need it but that’s ok) so I’m trying to make sure the screens are future proof as well.
---
You’re fine with spell power which you want on shadow, but plus shadow damage won’t help. Generally you’re ok, but your heal/greater spells will take .5 sec longer to cast, less chance to crit, and without MP5 or spirit your mana gen not as good. Mostly this is OK if people play well, and don’t mind you drinking (more than usual).  Priests are damn good healers in general so learn your 5 sec rule, keep a set of shadow gear and healing gear (as necessary) and just be careful spending your mana. You’ll be ok.
---
This exchange is absolutely hilarious
---
Thanks for the recommendation I’ll look into it
---
Given the recent state of event, I don't think so.
---
wtf I only played vanilla on an rp-pvp server! There's no other realm types that comes close to it.
---
Vacations are there for doing whatever the fuck people like to do instead of work.
---
What? Vacations are for whatever you want them to be. If u/Blarghinston wants to use his vacation to grind classic, that's his prerogative. 
---
Rogue sap is hard to contest with. You can even have help and if they have improved sap they can still keep doing it. But Warlock has so many tools to mess with an entire area. I think you might even be able to enslave a raid mob and hearth somewhere with it.
---
No. Don’t do it. Unless there’s some crazy set bonus you want, I’d stick to dungeon blues. If you do rank 10, then might as well no life if to 11 for the 100g epic mount to save 900ish gold.
---
Source:  I’ve done rank 10 and 11 grind. It sucks
---
I get that it's a bummber to not have your type of server, but there is pretty much almost no demand for that. Just embrace the classic community building, go onto a pvp server and form a RP community / join a RP guild. Many people may or may not check out classic and being kinda stuck on a dead server after month sucks just a lot.
---
I feel like 69 was not a meme back in Vanilla days.
---
I completely agree, the problem is that a year and a half ago people got shouted down for suggesting anything other than 1.12 (probably because that's what people thought they were playing on pservers) and this seems to have influenced Blizzard heavily sadly. 
---
Damn. Motherfucking Loch Modan, I love it. Such a nice place to level. 
---
I don't think you'll regret it. It'll be mind-blowingly huge when you first set it up but after a few weeks, sacrificing any of it will feel terrible. Best of luck!!
---
Yeah, I think the community has a much different preference today than it had back in Vanilla. 
---
Complete with system of a down playing at &lt;128 kbps
---
This!!!! PvP grind is way worse than dungeons, UBRS, ZG, MC. And you can take days off. Do BGs for rep rewards, don’t do the ranking. The gears not worth it at r10 generally speaking.
---
Zapped by a big vagina.
---
&gt;I have a life. Most old WoW players did. It's why we don't watch Twitch and post on reddit all day, everyday repeating company influencers like a repeating parrot.
---
No, you just hang out posting the same complaints everyone and their mother already has. QQ.
---
Do what you gotta do, I get it. But imagine trying to grind EVERY DAY, every week for all of your ranks, no AFKing because you’ll have to run premade WSG for maximizing honor ...it sucks man.
---
I'm in the same situation, however Classic isn't going anywhere once it's released so I'm gonna go for a late summer vacation just to be sure I can play Classic during. 
---
Shaman! Pumped for that one 
---
Thanks for reminding, but I count cross posting as credit! 😍 Thank you for that!! 
---
It’s a fun one!
---
I've been super stoked to have a real RP-PVP experience again, this is pretty disappointing if it happens.
---
I never said that you cannot or should not take time off for entertainment. I said that it is not important. When something is not important it does not merit anxiety. OP is expressing anxiety about not being able to get time off for the wow launch. "Genuinely irritated" are the words he used.
---
Very similar to a junky getting anxiety about not being able to score another fix in time.
---
Tell me, what's the purpose in tower's, bunkers, armor turn ins, mines, etc when people run past all of them and zerg down drek/van? 
---
Agree with all of that, but the post says “leveling” which I strongly disagree with
---
I was wondering if it was the server I played on. US-Garithos.
---
I mean he said it was just "initially". So there's hope that one will launch eventually. Wasn't it the same with Vanilla? Just get into a server with your friends, start leveling and before you know it you can server transfer to that brand new rp-pvp server you guys want so much.
---
Level in Arms spec :)
---
I don't know your exact situation but if you can block off 8 hours of play time with minimal interruption then you can raid as opposed to pvping for 20 hours a week to hit rank 10. 
---
If you don't understand the value of that information then you won't understand anything else concerning this matter.
---
Rogue and hunters
---
She, and indeed that's what I did! Sadly you have to work your way around a square... GIVE ME THE "CREATE A WORLD" FUNCTION ALREADY!!! 😭
---
Sounds like you want another fail BFA release where everything is broken because its rushed. 
---
Its ready when its ready. You can wait.
---
Looking at it I can't help but having Banjo Kazooie's Treasure Trove Cove soundtrack in my head.
---
Bidding is horseshit and should be avoided fully, always. It just create's drama, if you want to use DKP just use some mix of Zero Sum and EPGP and skip the rest of the bullshit. Simple.
---
Your guys view of tier and non-tier gear is also super flawed and show's sort of a lack of experience with modern vanilla raiding at all to boot. Gear being "Tier Gear" and anyway separate is just silly, what classes want tier gear varies fucking WILDLY and there's no point attempting to treat tier guy as different than on-tier gear.
---
You'll just end up screwing over classes like rogue's who can say use a lot more of their tier 2 then a fury warrior but the non-tier peices are some of the biggest anyway, just let people pick what item they wan't and don't take on any extraneous rules regarding it's "place" or importance. 
---
And if you really want to do that, then use Zero-Sum and assign value based of the piece itself.
---
Offspec gear should always be roll and "old" tier's usually still contain plenty of BiS, this isn't retail.
---
Why do you even bother with such stupid comments?
---
For DPS gear you generally don't compete with tanks with a few exceptions. You are however competing with all the fury warriors, rogues and hunters.
---
If you want to get gear regularly play a tank, a druid or even a warlock. 
---
Thanks for your crosspost here! 💙
---
&gt; to recharge. I doubt that will happen grinding 18 hours a day. You'll just be burned out at the end of it.
---
Speak for yourself. I enjoy grinding hours on end. No responsibilities, no expectations, just a checklist consisting of two things:
---
☒ Kill thing
---
☐ Move to next thing
---
That's pretty damn relaxing.
---
I don’t understand how taking time off to play WoW is any different than taking time off to do anything else for enjoyment. Taking time off to vacation in Mexico should be looked at no different than taking time off to lay on my couch. Trolls will be trolls.
---

---
For that Ultra-Classic experience!
---
&gt; I don't know why people think you should have some grand plan for every time you take some vacation.
---
One reason I love my company. I took today off. "Hey boss, not coming in today, I'll put in the paperwork when I'm in tomorrow"
---
Yeah. Loot Council with class leaders you can trust is the best IMO.
---
The hardest part is getting respectable and knowledgable class leaders.
---
Hell no. MMORPGs aren't supposed to be seasonal games. The whole point is persistent worlds and permanence is the accomplishments of your character. 
---
This was in Vanilla? I need to research some strats to keep up in classic then, lol.
---
Bombshell tbh
---
Switch to at war with Booty Bay. Inflict your untamed wrath upon the filthy goblins for countless hours. Become the Goblin Slayer. I'm pretty sure there is no benefit to going above honored with Bloodsail.
---
Also, fair warning that your rep with all 4 Goblin towns (Everlook, Ratchet, Booty Bay, and Gadgetzan) will tank to 0/36000 Hated. Every goblin will instantly know in their heart that you are their natural predator. Their unconditional hatred for you will only be transcended by their crippling terror at the sound of your footsteps. The proud Goblin will vainly attempt to fight you and avenge their slaughtered kin, and you will laugh mercilessly as you send them to greet the fallen.
---
Or when you are done grinding Bloodsail rep, you could go slaughter the completely unrelated Southsea pirates in Tanaris or the Wastewanders for a few rep a piece until back at Honored.
---
... I guess... 
---
Wow, I don't know how you can read so much into words on a screen, but to compare his level of anxiety to that of a "junky" who's not able to score? Based on text on a screen?  
---
You're missing the big picture here fellow poster. The key is that what is important to you is not necessarily what is important to him. How it affects (or does not affect) him emotionally is besides the point if you can understand that much. People don't have to match their interests (or what they consider important) to your standards. It's a big key point to basically interacting with any other human being.
---
Before you start comparing him or anybody else to drug addicts, you might want to reel it back a notch, take a deep breath, and ask yourself if comparing your standards to another is a good thing to do.
---
I could do that too, but I think it wouldn’t fly as well for two weeks hahaha. IT companies. 
---
Yep it's long overdo.
---
Yes. My RP-PVP server had tons of people who didn't even *like* PVP but felt like it was a crucial aspect of the experience.
---
This is a terrible argument. AV turned into what it was because of changes they made alongside the incentives to get marks (and in vanilla rep rewards). According to you if Blizzard launched Classic with a cash shop that let you buy any epic for $2 a pop it wouldn't affect the raiding much because it's just the mentality and little to nothing to do with the carrot on a stick that mmorpg's revolve around.
---
AV is just really bad honor for one thing in the non-zerg fashion because if you're just killing the same players over and over they are worth less and less and eventually nothing. To get players to play it the old way they would have to do something like tweak those player honor %'s for AV and just make the captain's invulnerable for like 30 minutes and the generals for like 90 minutes and just make killing them worth much more honor and rep. 
---
I don't think they will do anything other than give us 1.12 AV because Blizzard seems to be impressively lazy with Classic and feels like most everyone who is interested in it will buy it regardless of what they do or don't do and don't want to do anything that's any extra effort on their part for reselling an old game.
---
It's been 30 minutes, are you still alive?
---
It's not just about trust. It's about them putting enough thought and effort into proper loot counseling for it to work properly.
---
No doubt we do.  I made a little poll on the Classic EU Discord ([https://discord.gg/SdVt9zN](https://discord.gg/SdVt9zN)) and well......check the result so far: [https://imgur.com/YGo8d2X](https://imgur.com/YGo8d2X)   
---
RP-PvP is at 2nd place.  
---
You were their number one seller!
---
Burned out of Classic maybe and then ready and perhaps even eager to get back into regular work.
---
The idea that there's any way to do a vacation 'wrong' or 'right' is ludicrous. It depends on the person.
---
+1 for rp-pvp server. Part of my hype has been to really get immersed in my character and the world while still having the threat and excitement of pvp. Dueling with ‘icemage69’ in pvp (and probably losing) really breaks the immersion!
---
Here I can do that too:  
---
If you don't understand how that piece of information is not valuable to YOU at all.... Like in any sense... Then you don't understand how wrong you are. 
---
I agree, but kiting basically makes warriors double as sustainable as rogue. 
---
For some people I think role-playing means ignoring the game's world and staying at level one in character in Goldshire the whole time.
---
But yeah I completely agree with you, PvE is immersion wrecking for me in normal realms.
---
Yeah because a close guesstimate and stopping zergs is worse than a completely broken BG that is played the complete opposite of it's original intention. They have the tools to implement a better solution than Nostalrius did over a weekend and the amount nerfed every patch on NPC's that now become a joke is also a known number.
---
They had a guy at the crossroads in the Blizzcon Classic demo with a quest that was never there. OMG HOW DID THEY DO IT without it being in 1.12? Give me a break. We now have amateurs in their spare time on backwards engineered spaghetti code making more historically accurate Classic's than a multibillion dollar company that has a subscription fee. What the f@#% am I paying for?
---
That's what people said about osrs and it quickly turned into runescape 2.9 because they allowed you to just vote for QoL and convenience non-stop. 
---
Summer doesn't officially start for another 3 months, how early do you expect a release date?
---
Yeah exactly. This technique makes warriors not nearly as bad as people make them out to be.
---
Why would this not work?
---
More time to enjoy leveling!
---
To cry like a 4 year old apparently.
---
Hey are you free at the weekend?
---
It seems like you're being sarcastic but yes. OP is seemingly thinking about items like Band of Accuria, which is an item with agility, stamina, and +%hit, which screams 'Rogue ring'.
---
Tanks get priority on it.
---
Ooooh I can't wait to Google this. My brother is going to be a shamwow and I intend to help him.
---
Good to know, will look out for those addons, ty
---
Good luck with dispellable enrage mechanics
---
I agree with you. It's interesting to see how much a person doesn't get basic human interaction. 
---
You like pickles, he hates pickles. Conclusion? He's clearly wrong for hating pickles. Let us correct him.
---
Wow, someone got triggered lol
---
Lore is his name. Honestly I loved his content before he was hired by Blizz. His weekly marmot was so great.
---
Hm. I read the whole post, but my brain could only interperet the word behooves after the first half.
---
Good info, ty
---
Awesome. Love the pod man keep it up!
---
I did too. Many did as well. We were those types that go to Italy, feeling all unique and clever coming up with the idea for our pics of using forced perspective to push against the Leaning Tower of Pisa, because no one has done that before. Then later you go online, finding out that everyone is doing that, making you feel insignificant.. rethinking your life. Seeing that "yes, my father was right: my Mom lied to me: I'm not special; I should just become an office-drone instead of having ambitions". Metaphorically speaking...
---
I suppose that premise is packaged with trust. I'm not nearly as worried about nepotism as I am about a class leader not taking their role seriously. Nepotism, greed etc is a symptom of a class leader not taking their role and responsibility seriously IMO. Incredibly rare for someone responsible enough to also be outright corrupt, at least in my experience.
---
This is original content. Pretty out there, but definitely original. Props 
---
Reckoning is still a good talent for a protadin.  **It's just not abusable**.  People need to stop associating over-abused bugs on pservers with viability in retail servers.
---
From two weeks ago?
---
So from what I remember there wasn't much RP'ng happening in  RP-PVP servers. It was basically just another PvP server with a smaller population. Am I wrong about this?
---
Yes, they will have a higher chance to hit. There is no glancing in pvp iirc ? Also weaponskill does matter iirc because you won't gain your full crit% if your weapon skill isn't maxed. 
---
First of all, thank you for negative karma, i wont return the favor. Second I was not trolling about the issue, I was talking about non sack potato that wow in one monitor and rest is pictures of naked wifu, I was talking if you actually are doing anything on those 2 monitors too. 
---
But its ok, thanks for negative carma thou!
---
I'm in IT. A day or two here and there is no problem. My 5-9 days for launch will likely need 2 weeks or so heads-up.
---
your mates got their truck license with that video
---
I don't have time to find all the resources for it right now, but there are archived blueposts from back then regarding the /sit technique to gain reckoning stacks, and how it won't work on every hit anymore.
---
/Sit will still guarantee a crit against you, but not every white critical that's forced will proc reckoning. 
---
I believe you can find this in the patch notes for 1.9-1.10 as well.
---
Sounds interesting. But I kinda feel like it is lowkey cheating, if you were able to track enemies' buffs considering that mages have a spell specifically to detect them.
---
Then again, I often feel like a lot of addons can give u a noteable edge over others.
---
I found it really bad in the mid teens through early 20's from using outdated weapons. After that it was not nearly as hard or long as people make it out to be. It's pretty much like leveling a rogue and I never hear people touting that as some big achievement. 
---
&gt;Nicer looking Stormwind City
---
This is the only compliment here I will accept. Thank you, Stormwind *is* much nicer than the desert orc barrack that is Orgrimmar. 
---
Any poll made here or on a classic discord isn't going to reflect the playerbase we'll have. There'll be a bigger influx of players who didn't play on pservers.
---
that's hilarious!
---
Kiting the world dragons to GS or tauren starting zone was always good 
---
Skills don't get automatically placed on your bar on Vanilla, do they? I'm sure battle stance doesn't cause it has it's own mini bar.
---
But, I haven’t got any eyes! Yohohoho
---
Since the topic came up...
---
I've been considering a new monitor setup.  What does everyone think about Curved-Screen monitors?
---
workers of the world unite!

---
RP-PVP was less popular back in Vanilla, (Although, I'd argue not having any at launch hampered their potential.) but I really don't think that's the case anymore, the community's changed. RP realms are apparently much friendlier and more mature, with so many classic players being 25+ I think RP realms will most likely be a lot more popular than they were, and with PvP being more popular overall I'd wager RP-PvP will outshine RP-PvE.
---
Tankspot really helped my elevate my performance in WotLK. 
---
Pservers using vanilla rates. I've been making changes constantly, and tested them out on a few recent crowded launches, so I'm pretty confident that I'll be able to sustain my expectations regardless of launch pop / congestion.
---
Eh, as a RP-PvP guy it makes me torn between rolling on a RP server, or a PvP server. :/
---
Isn't there a rule against these kinds of personal attacks?
---
Idiot
---
God you people are obnoxious. 
---
I know, but I just wanted to have an argument.
---
Yep, making the RP-PvP servers later only hurts the chances of an RP-PvP launching in a healthy state. It's easier to ask people to jump in at launch, but tougher to ask them to leave their current community and try to transition it over. 
---
&gt; Sure humans have the stealth detection increase ability
---
Humans have +5 weapon skill in swords. This is more important (min-maxing wise).
---
This might be true but for PVE humans still have the best racials otherwise by far. For PVP NE might be superior, nice catch
---
Yes but your point is mute. Unless you are talking just in general but then why are you in a specific subreddit saying this? Seems irrelevant
---
LOL sorry man, I could remember the bears level god I'm so stupid, I wish I could remember these details like you
---
P.s take your tiny dick elsewhere you embarrassment 
---
Lore - they came late in classic's launch.... 
---
Its a bloody server option, that should be there to cater to a small community within the community.
---
Why?
---
You need it though. Because we haz cooler characters.
---
No, humans will still easily get the opener in duels. Perception is far stronger than nelf stealth bonus.
---
I also prefer RP-PvP servers, but don't underestimate an RP server's capacity for PvP events. I know a pretty massive one happened, where people staged the siege of Theramore leading up to the release of MoP on an RP server (so right before the mana bomb dropped). You do still however lose some of the environment outside of those events. 
---
That's kind of where I'm at. If I have to choose between zerg and trench, give me trench. 
---
Blizz, if you ditch one type of server, ditch Rp. Most Rpers will want to play on RpPvP servers. 
---
But best, give us all 4 server types. 
---
This is the only relevant comment currently. It's a summer release, that's not "oh it's warm must be summer, release next month?!", it's a financial year summer just like every other expansion, which means anywhere up to September 30th (iirc) this year. 
---
What would possess someone to downvote a poll?
---
I'd do PvP if that was the dilemma. Because you can still get RP elements in normal PvP server, especially if you have some like minded buds. But you can't really get the PvP element on a normal server (RP-PvE).
---
The current thread on the official forums (People are pretty disappointed)
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/rp-pvp-servers-will-be-there-blizzard-poll/37583/32
---
Well, at least they are duplicating my WoW launch experience. When we didn't get RP-PvP servers, my RP community splintered. Most went to roll on an RP server, but a smaller group of us made our own "Unofficial RP-PvP Server." It worked well for a while, but we didn't have a big enough base to maintain it. Thankfully RP-PvP servers came out shortly after our community was on it's last legs. 
---
Is this all they covered?  At work, can't get to Twitch
---
WHY WONT ANYBODY HELP ME
---
Sure, but if a poll swings massively in one direction or another you can extrapolate that there's some validity to the general result. It's not like it tells you nothing.
---
&lt;GM&gt; ~~Claus~~ Greatfather Winter
---
A very small poll of the most 'hardcore' group (the people that have joined a discord, actually keep up with whats going on with it, etc when the game is still months away from being released) really isnt indicative of much, to be honest.
---
Your not wrong, but the problem with RP servers on their own is that PVP is not automatically activated. You can be out looking for combat the the enemy faction runs up to you and then just trolls you because you can't actually interact with them.
---
Where's your data?
---
Spirit tap is useless outside of levelling. You're far better off drinking at 60 than wearing crappy spirit gear and hoping you get killing blows.  
---
Any moderately keen pvper will have engineering in classic, it's easily the best pvp profession.
---
I think this is a valid view. I am just stating how I feel about it.
---
Terrible troll, be gone.
---
This kind of thing was so fun, I remember kiting an elite molten giant from the burning steppes to goldshire when I was level 25 or so on my hunter. He lasted about 15 before some level 60 came and squashed him. 
---
Because the general behavior of players is what influences how AVs play out most of the time? Sometimes you can force a game to turtle, but you need enough people who go against the rush meta to do so. So even if I go against the grain, I could potentially just get run-over while both sides continue to rush undisturbed. What the majority of gamers does is important if we're talking about how we'd like to play a 40v40 BG. 
---
It's gunna be July 16th, I'm calling it. 
---
People like you made the game fun. :D
---
Totally understand, just throwing it out as a consideration, given the news of no RP-PvP servers. 
---
The fact that you say you expect a Feral Druid to play in cat on Vael shows me that you have no idea. Ferals are the best tanks for Vael because they have the best threat. The gain that 1 cat will get from having infinite energy is next to nothing compared to the benefit of the entire raid being able to go all out DPS from the second that the boss is pulled.
---
Also, Ferals shouldn't ever really play as a primary healer. Raid leaders never need to *add* more healers. When you're building a raid, you start with a set amount of healers and then you remove them if you don't need that many. What Ferals can do is throw on healing gear and play as dedicated decursers. The extra mana pool they get from Heart of the Wild makes them better at this than actual healers.
---
This is also my take on things. From the people I know, people have grown to prefer RP-PVP servers.
---
Yea the q+a was mainly for retail questions
---
We've been waiting for this game for over 13 years. What do you expect?
---
Well this your called troll is a third to get thunderfury in the classic, but its ok for you to judge people. And i am a 20 year system administrator (i am 39 now) but you are so in the position to judge. What is your achievement in classic? What you excel at? Ok..
---
I know about that theory too, but I’m still too hesitant haha. 
---
I would rather them not give a date than feel pressured to release an incomplete game just to meet a timeline.  
---
Did that before, it worked for a while. It's just harder to maintain a healthy community when the only way to advertise that it even exists is on forums, instead of in the server select screen. But that's what I'm going to be wrestling with. Will my compromise to be roll RP and just turn my own flag on all the time? Or roll PvP and get significantly less RP interactions. 
---
Just check the census. Even if it's just barely 10% of the playerbase that's still sufficient to have one realm dedicated for RP-PvP on both regions. Besides, the RP-PvP is 3x as popular the RP-PvE realm type, so that should give Blizzard incentive to prioritise that at least.
---
dude where are your keybindings
---
That’s precisely why I’m willing to join RP-PVP. I know there are other players like who me who don’t want to do a ton of PVP, but playing through the game without “the fear” breaks the immersions in contested areas.
---
I really don’t want to push back on Blizzard for this one, though. I’d rather save the “sky is falling” attitude for loot trading or some other game-breaking decision.
---
RP-normal it is 😒
---
Seriously. People are being way too impatient and honestly just unrealistic. You might not get a release date until May or June.
---
What do you mean by 1.15?
---
It was 1.12 and TBC prepatch was 2.0.
---
It's like Hollywood : they don't want to take any risks of loosing money so they either release old content or something so conventional that it's just meh ...   
---
The funny thing is that if there are Alliance ganking in Hillsbrad, they're probably also doing quests.  If Horde are in Lakshire, they're just there to kill.
---
At that point I'd rather just role on a PvP server and still have wPvP part of my gameplay. I like RP and PvP, but I like PvP more. Really sad I have to chose between the two. 
---
Yea not sure why I kept adding the extra 1. I have had walking pneumonia all month though, so I'm blaming that lol.
---
Sounds good, good discussion. Curious to see how things develop later on.
---
People that joined a Discord are the people that most likely will keep playing Classic and not check it out for couple weeks. So I beg to disagree.  It is already indicative. 
---
Weak. RP-PvP for me please.
---
It won't be worth it for leveling it will be outgunned by full ret spec.
---
For simple aoe grinding like lashers it doesn't make much of a difference. 
---
You just won't be able to do shit like solo the 1st/2nd boss of dme or maraudon in a timely manner. 
---
You are spamming a sap macro and the NE racial means nothing. Even the human racial is kind of mediocre for 1 v 1 because you can vanish in stealth to get the opener. The Human racial is AWESOME for premade pvp though as it plays to the strength of your role. That role is finding and harassing the enemy druid flag carrier or taking nodes that often has a rogue defending them.
---
Dwarf for 1 v 1 wpvp (you can immune rogue blind and restealth/vanish on rogue, hunter, warrior bleeds and poisons), Human for premade pvp and pve, and the other choices are bad but gnome is slightly better than NE. Gnome is awesome on warrior though.
---
On Horde it's Orc for PVP (Rogue PvP trinket doesn't get out of stun) and PVE, Undead is "ok" in PVP but people roll locks and spriests more on Horde and most healers are paladins in pvp and Troll is even worse than Nightelf.
---
Dwarf and Orc are the best min max, but Human and Undead are usually played more because they are still "ok" and don't look silly. 
---
There are a lot bigger issues than catering to the 1% of the population who wants to sit around and RP all day

I’d For 144hz if possible, preferably 24 or 27 inch, even using the desktop it’s noticeable when you switch back to 60.
---
Pretty much the truth.
---
If it's a two hour ban, it might be worth it to do it once.
---
A friend of mine got a two hour ban for impersonating a GM, so that seems about right.
---
Pretty much yes. There was quite some RP going on in my realm. And even without the RP element the community was way better in general. 
---
June seems a little unrealistic since BFA was announced in April for an August release, by May is definitely possible.
---
Exactly. We aren't all gamer stereotypes anymore in 2019. This isn't a zero sum game.
---
Gotcha. I might roll on one when it comes out. 
---
That's exactly why I'd been debating between rolling on an RP or RP-PvP server at launch. Was too young during Vanilla to appreciate or have any real interest in RP servers, but working a full time office job &amp; having cleared Vanilla content a half dozen times at this point, I'm more looking for a community-centric server to enjoy Classic with. The added tension &amp; greater possibility for cross-faction RP events makes RP-PvP sound perfect. Curious how adding RP-PvP after launch will shake up the RP communities that start developing, barring Blizzard changing their decision before launch.
---
Names on pvp servers is a big immersion breaker and honestly rp'ing on such a server will be laughed at. Plus you're talking about organized RP with your friends, which means you'll never encounter any random RP out in the world which is kinda a big deal imo. As for picking an RP server, well expect little interest in PvP and a less open minded community. Most people won't be flagged and you always have to be careful not stepping over someone's toes on that type of server, it's not really a good place for pvp'ers.
---
Now if only there was a way to combine the best of both servers.. :thinking:
---
Takes time to get to 60 in vanilla. To restart a new character months later is a big NO.
---
Yeah but I want to be here for launch, it (probably) will never happen again !
---
Now this is wow, fuck it's like watching the first episode of rogue craft, life was so much simpler then.
---
Yeah I was bad with that stuff. Normally I would swap out spells in the main bar (like swap Fade and Dispel when I needed to) but never did anything else for that. Mouse clicking everything else like a newb.
---
NE druid is the ultimate AFK class. Stealth, shadowmeld, heals, roots, and bear form all help when life starts getting in the way.
---
Yeah, i've never understood why they did that... it was just horrible.
---
Oh I remember. I'll have my main in my server of choice. But I'd like to create one on an RP-PVP server. Or just a regular RP server and then transfer when the PVP one's come out.
---
Obviously, these surveys can be flawed, but these are the data we received from the latest Classic WoW census we sent out on this sub a few months ago. &gt;7% of respondents are hoping to play on an RP-PVP server, which is roughly 3-4 times more than plan to play on an RP (PvE) server.
---
If there's gonna be an RP server, there should absolutely be an RP-PvP server... even if they didn't exist in Vanilla, it's a change that I think is very reasonable to get behind, and there's data to back up it's interest.
---
What are talking about. Check the various polls online. RP-PvP is more asked for that PvE realms. 
---
It'll be interesting to see how it pans out, for sure. I just think it's a bit too optimistic to just assume out the gate that Classic is "the next wow killer" when so far we have little actual evidence to support that.
---
It will almost certainly be successful in its own right, it clearly caters to enough people around the world to maintain sustainable server populations. Add in the people who don't know about or aren't interested in pservers and I do expect that number to grow.
---
But how many servers does WoW have right now, and how many players are on during the day and prime time on each server, in just the Americas alone? I think it's premature to assume Classic will match that long-term. Retail WoW is an anomaly in the MMO market and I'm not entirely sure that even Blizzard can dethrone it that easily lol
---
Gnome isn't that bad as a rogue. Getting rooted is extremely annoying, and a 1min cd, it's pretty ballin'. It helps with your more annoying match-ups.
---
To allow you to regen mana. You can kite a Warrior or Rogue forever, but you will run out of mana doing so. Better to take them to half health, then get into Bear and finish them off so you can move on to the next kill with most of your mana.
---
Going to be downvoted for saying this, but the vast majority of people who want RP-PvP servers aren't even role-players.
---
The sudden popularity and demand for RP-PvP servers is born from the notion that Vanilla was or is more immersive than BfA, which to the layman must mean that Vanilla is the superior game for role-players, right? In reality, the modern game offers much more to facilitate what has always been an incredibly niche meta-game. It's actually going to be more difficult to RP on Classic servers than it is currently on BfA servers (people will do it anyway, but that doesn't mean it won't be more difficult), but people who are not and have never been role-players will tell you otherwise. No one even talks about the fact that RP-PvP doesn't just rely on but fundamentally requires cross-faction communication, which of course completely contradicts Classic "ideals" (but again, people who are not and have never been role-players will tell you otherwise).
---
In other words, people with no experience on RP-PvP servers have created and perpetuated fictional, fantastical expectations and ideas on what it's going to be like to play on a RP-PvP server, and they're now lamenting the death of their dreams when they were never a reality to begin with. If they had played on an RP-PvP server (or even just an RP server full stop) they would know already that these servers are no different from any other server, and simply serve as a place for role-players to congregate, with RP-PvP servers being historically the least-played server type by a fucking mile. So whatever wacky delusions you have about RP-PvP servers - forget them. The only thing you should expect is for your server to die 2 months post launch.
---
Diablo 2? Nice.
---
Well if this doesn't tickle your nuts I don't know what will. Mine have been tickled. Thank you.
---
I had a night elf rogue back in the day and the best thing about shadowmeld is the PvE aspect. It allows you to stealth around mobs and sap/pickpocket much easier without being detected. 
---
Agreed. 
---
End of August plz so I don’t waste the last summer I’ll spend outdoors.
---
Oh? Like, when stealth breaks you just pop shadowmeld?
---
I actually looked into these and its really disorienting. No matter how gentle the angle is, it always seems like it’s warped and the images are just weird. I considered getting two but I couldn’t stand just one.
---
Hey there, not sure if you are the content creator OP, if not maybe they will see this. After having watched the entire video, I'm pretty disappointed and feel pretty misled. I expected the majority of this video to be about "Inventory Dimensionality" [6:43]. I was hoping (based off seeing an hour long video length) that it would go into great detail with strategies and guidelines you can follow throughout the length of vanilla, dealing with managing bag space and inventory, comprehensively. I had assumed it would talk about managing multiple sets of gear, raid consumables, farming materials, and the like, going into optimal ways to help streamline these process and quickly swap around between raiding inventory (maybe you have a DPS set, Tank set, FR/NR Set, consumables, etc) and an Open world set (PvP gear, lots of free space for gathering herbs/ores, various trinkets/gadgets useful in the open world setting). I was hoping it would also help dive into useful ways to leverage multiple characters, ways to decide how to split what you send to which, including details on an AH character vs just extra mules, touching on breaking points for ROI on buying extra bank slots, upgrading bag spaces (12-&gt;14, 14-&gt;16 etc) versus just making another mule.  
---
Don't get me wrong, the video was fine and well made, but just not what I anticipated, basically just being a list of bags.. I wouldn't have bothered with the entire hour (or even any of it) had I had known.
---
Thank you.  I was very lost.
---
Started my cut this week after a long lean-bulking phase, by the time Classic comes out I'll be the most shredded I've ever been. Too bad nobody will see it because I'll sit infront of my computer all day long.
---
Thx
---
1.5k people based on the sample - maybe that would do it. 
---
The transfer be free of charge it wouldn't be that bad. But why the hassle? Just implement it from the start if you know a lot of people want it. 
---
Downvote into oblivion... If it didn’t exist in Classic WoW, it shouldn’t exist in Classic WoW Relaunch... Go play BFA if you want QOL changes!
---
Is that a garbage bag full of chimichangas?
---
Arms is the best leveling spec in most people's opinion plus you get improved charge and stance mastery for tanking while leveling. Win win if you ask me!
---
And it has nothing to do with PVP rogue v rogue matchup.
---
I think that's the problem. A lot is different to us than it is to Blizzard. Probably have to justify the cost in equipment and man-hours to get one running. Otherwise management just slaps it with a big "NO"
---
&gt;even if they didn't exist in Vanilla
---
&gt;RP-PvP, was finally introduced in Patch 1.8.
---
It was in by 1.12 so they should definitely add them based on this survey and the fact that we are getting all 1.12 everything. Not my cup of tea but it just makes sense to have them, even if only in the most populated reasons.
---
Master loot MS&gt;OS /Roll. All the way
---
Rogue stealth wait till enemy is engaged and half health. Ultimate grieving scenario. 
---
I’m fine socially engaging with Guilds and will always be happy to help groups (I’ll be healing) whenever I’m needed, just loggin in to chat shit in /guild, whatever. I just don’t like sitting in voice comms 24/7, I don’t even do it with my IRL friends when we’re playing games. Sometimes I like it having to sit with my headset on and just chill with some music doing dungeons or grinding.
---
Don’t even get me started on all the people who can’t figure out how to configure voice activation so being in discord means you hear constant background noise.
---
I voted for RP-PvzP because I remember from retail it being a bit contentious that RP-PvP basically was just a PvP realm that was very RP lite.
---
To that end I'd prefer RP-PvE where more RP actually happens, and a lot of players will still flag and PvP and organize PvP events.
---
Otherwise I would just play on a PvP realm. As far as I understand, RP-PvP is almost in name only and functionally is just a PvP server that a handful of people RP on.
---
Gnome is best for alliance. People are obsessed with rogue v. rogue for some reason. 
---
7/10 did not get the upwards beam
---
Will macros be able to switch your weapons between sets?  I did it in WOTLK, super convenient switching between 1H and 2H.
---
1.12 AV **is** No Changes you dolt.
---
I have 2 32" ones at work. Anything smaller sucks, and I can't stand that big for gaming at my desk.
---
Home gaming: 25"ish 21:9 is perfect.
---
I just do elwynn-westfall-loch-darkshore
---
Are you abhorring the story that is actually occuring, or what we are being SHOWN in game? Remember, Sylvanas started the war because she knew with Genn at Anduin's side the Alliance would eventually attack. Orgrimmar sucks basically, SoO proved it, Stormwind is just too defensible. So the Horde had to start the war on a really strong foot (the burning of Teldrassil). Which, the plan was to TAKE Teldrassil, after Malfurion "escaped" Sylvanas knew the city wasn't going to be able to be held and they can't exactly go "oopsie lets just pretend this didn't happen and go back to peace kthanks" so she went with the admittedly insane idea of just burning the whole entire tree full of people down. In game, its horribly shown. I was so mad when she burned the tree down, one of the first times i've legitimately been angry at the writing instead of just sad about what just happened. Now that the short stories have explained it better... i'm not HAPPY with it, but to me it makes enough sense with Sylvanas' character. I never said its GOOD, but its not AS BAD as everybody thinks.
---
I really, really, REALLY wish they did a time skip after Legion... all they woulda had to do was repeat the first lines of the Original Trailer (4 years have passed since the mortal races banded together to defeat the burning legion, blah blah the drums of war sound once again).
---
I'll admit, right now with the whole baine being a traitor thing and all the horde leaders being like "its almost rebellion time yo" i'm pretty upset that not a single NPC has mentioned Garrosh lately. They should be mentioning Garrosh and SoO around EVERY CORNER. I main a Nightborne, I literally have no idea why my people haven't shunned the Horde and went back to Suramar at this time, my whole race feels forgotten in the story.
---
Nah I mean when you are using stealth around mobs they can catch you especially if they are higher level. As a night elf you can get much closer to mobs without pulling or alerting them. It  also can be really useful late game if you decide to go pick pocket mobs in dungeons for gold. 
---
Indeed. 
---
I meant 1.5 av not 1.15
---
But how does Loot Council prevent people leaving afterwards? They both seem to have that flaw. 
---
At least with DKP loot is “earned” through participation. You put in X work, you get Y reward. If someone redeems their points on an item then leaves afterwards, it doesn’t erase their past contributions of raiding “for free”.  With Loot Council that could happen on the first boss. 
---
Pretty sure it's RNG only.
---
completely random.
---
I think RP-PVP realms are the best of both worlds. It's got the always-enabled PVP so you can just go balls out and wreck everyone you meet (or get wrecked by mains), but it also gives you that increased immersion of a roleplaying game once you enter bigger cities and towns. Coming across an impromptu scenario in the middle of Darrowshire, or waging a small-scale war in Arathi Highlands... Or just going down to the nearest inn for some classic banter (with a dash of ERP unfortunately).
---
It just adds to the game. I mean I'm not the type of person who would spend the majority of his time to think up of eloquent back stories and just loiter around Stormwind talking to others, but I do like to 'get in character' every once in awhile, whip out a few Clint Eastwood quotes and go on my merry way to melt unsuspecting prey.
---
Also want to throw my voice in saying I was planning on rolling on an RP-PvP server.
---
If I'm going to RP I want to be able experience the entire **world**, and that includes getting ganked, ganking, and forming large raids in world PvP.
---
I hope they at least make ***ONE*** RP-PvP server at launch.
---
When I played on Defias Brotherhood, there were hell a lot of RP. RP PvP are the true RP servers since being friendly between factions is just strange.
---
It's not RP lite, or PvP severs with a little RP. It's great to servers with an amazing community.
---
This was all downtime stuff, find out stupid shit to do.
---
I seem to remember the elites outside zulgurub had some potential too, don't think I kited them though. 
---
I'll certainly downvote your comment. No doubt about that. 
---
I was referring to the people characterizing the "no changes" crowd as crazies.
---
Not when you garuanteed the 80 players in the bg are players who actively go against the grain 
---
Well, calling a game a WoW killer is like calling a phone the iPhone killer, not going to happen.
---
There are a lot of people who love the way the churn works in retail WoW and they will stay with retail. But I still think that classic will do much better than the ~30k peak players you mentioned. I don't agree with "millions" either, but at least for the first year or two, I'd not be surprised to see concurrent player peaks in the range of hundreds of thousands.*
---
* Well, I mean the sum of the peaks of all the regions. EU won't peak at the same time as US or Asia, so the actual worldwide peak will be a lot lower
---
Bubble hearth was soooooo amazing. 
---
I've been playing a dwarf priest on a pserver for about a year now, in a similar situation to yours. 2 jobs and 2 kids at home, I play a couple nights a week once kids are in bed.
---
Shadow priest was really fun to level, and I stayed shadow spec until 60 because I ended up joining a casual raid guild as a healer. I've managed to get some tier 1/tier 2 gear even just as a casual. There will be a lot of raid pugs happening as the server matures.
---
That said, I think staying shadow is perfectly viable for someone who absolutely will not be raiding. Healing 5-10 mans should be manageable with some healing gear, and gold farming/pvp will be much easier for you. Dungeon set 1 isn't terrible for this type of play, and dungeon set 2 is certainly a worthwhile goal!
---
I'd put my vote on shadow priest that can also heal 5 mans :)
---
 I guess my wait for classic just got longer. I'm not making a character on a PvP realm just to re-roll if an RP-PVP server opens.
---
 I had so much fun on The Venture Co. 
---
The higher lvl of stealth makes little to no difference in pvp
---
Unless you're tanking raids you don't need to spec prot at all. Sunder armor and battle shout spam are all you need to hold aggro.
---
In raids you want 1 point in imp shield block to make it push a second crushing blow attack off the hit table - this is irrelevant in dungeons because enemies have to be 3 levels higher to crushing blow, and everything in dungeons is 62 or lower afaik.
---
Other than that a lot of tanks take the 15% threat talent because it generates more threat than any 5 points you'll spend elsewhere. And that's about it for mandatory prot talents. 
---
Early on the extra defence from anticipation might be useful in making up for bad gear and guaranteeing you never get crit. And I've read somewhere that the 10% extra armour talent isn't particularly great in increasing your survivability.
---
For leveling Arms is best from 40+ because mortal strike and sweeping strikes are hard to beat. For 10-39 some people go 2h fury because it's lower level talents are stronger. IIRC overpower is equivalent of 2.5% crit against same level mobs and with low crit chance impale and deep wounds aren't very good. Compared to Fury which has 5% crit outright from the start. Some people suggest going 5% crit from fury then putting points in to arms.
---
Honestly though, warriors are just objectively bad at low levels so it doesn't really matter what talents you take, it's going to be a bit of a grind. Run Deadmines or a similar low level instance ASAP to get a decent 2h weapon. Some of the drops there last until your late 20s/early 30s when you can start thinking about completing the whirlwind axe questchain.
---
You should start with hunter for nostalgia, strong during leveling, good gold farmer, does well with t1/t2, and then switch to shaman as they scale like crazy with t2.5? You could rush on your hunter, farm tons of gold, then take your time to level your shaman and when you reach 60 with it you’ll have gold for mount/prof.
---
Exactly what other graveyard is there for your team to cap between Stonehearth and SP GY? Those were the 2 that I used in my example.
---
Shadowmeld only gives a small passive increase to stealth. While Perception GREATLY increases stealth detection. +50 I believe.
---
My impression of warriors was: 1-25ish is kinda the pits, and you lose a lot of people here. 25-40 starts getting exciting as you get whirlwind, and MS/BS, at this point it isn't really much worse than leveling a rogue. 40-60 Smooth sailing, hard to challenge you in world pvp on an even footing, decent grinding. At 60 it definitely feels like the epics make the warrior, I was an alt, and never got geared, but being a warrior was never bad past 40 or so.
---
And even if that's Blizzards current plan, there's still a reason why they didn't announce that: if any unforeseen roadblocks appear, they are still able to push the date back without risking more angry mobs.
---
Still is; a played a little bfa and still bubble hearthed when I felt like it. Except now you have two hearthstones instead of one. I call that a buff. 
---
I'd imagine at least 5x as many people will play than those that filled in the survey months before actual launch on Reddit no less :)
---
I hope you find what you're looking for.
---
The Venture Co best server!
---
This might be stupid, but wtf is a RP-PVP server?
---
Coworkers and I started doing scheduled stair climbing in our office building twice a day. We go down and then back up. We work on the 14th floor.
---
&gt; As a night elf you can get much closer to mobs without pulling or alerting them
---
or just add some +stealth talents?
---
or items with enchants that boost it ( just during ie stealth farming)
---
Same to you fellow poster. And I hope you one day realize how wrong it is to judge others based on what they enjoy (within reason).
---
Shit, now I have to decide between if I want to get ganked by BigDTitMuncher, or get my RP on.

You might not like it, but this is what the ideal classic player looks like. 
---
"everyone who doesn't share my opinion is clearly just a SHILL YOU RETARDED RETARDS" Please don't give blizzard any money, you are the cancer no one wants in classic.
---
I'm eventually going to be Prot, but for the leveling experience I'm going to do Arms, with my brother as an Enhancement shaman.  It should be rockin'.
---
You are obviously very passionate, but unfortunately very misguided. I hope that when the time comes you are able to identify when your friends need help, even if they themselves are not able to see it.
---
Yeah it's odd they'd opt to only doing RP-PvE servers. If they were going to settle with one RP type, one would assume it would be RP-PvP, since more people seem to be interested in that, and RP-PvP servers offer more.
---
rogue v rogue its better to be human to get the opener
---
or dwarf to cleanse stuff
---
but how much do u care about rogue v rogue fights?
---
I'm not sure how representative the sample is of the population. But I'm willing to be charitable. 
---
It did exist in 1.12 though..
---
Here my memory of vanilla may be hazy, perhaps a pserver person can chime in. I thought they did, but I could be remembering a more modern iteration of WoW.
---
I think in addition to reasons already mentioned by others, Blizzard really felt like like they had to let ICC available to most people because of how important of a character Arthas/Lich King was. At the time he was one of if not the biggest/most popular lore character in Warcraft, and they wanted as many people as possible to experience finishing that story. 
---
You mean 4 aren’t exploits 
---
Don't confuse condescendance with an emotional bias. The title alone of the video I linked should be enough to understand the issue.
---
That model is also like 6 years old and there are much better ones available today
---
This, it's like saying everybody gets every piece of gear from a raid boss when they kill it because they are just there to get geared for pvp.
---
Would be blizzlike!
---
I'm pretty sure the studies done on this show it is basically as bad as sitting.
---
Do you know what an RP server is?  
---
Do you understand the different rulesets of Normal vs PvP server? (Auto flagging, etc)  
---
RP-PvP is an RP server using the PvP server ruleset instead of normal server ruleset like an RP server.
---
Humans have weapon skill, which boosts dps.  Stealth is not a combat ability.
---
I didn’t play vanilla so I don’t know for sure. You can use shadowmeld as a shitty 2nd vanish. And I think you could use it to drop stacks of a dot. Correct me if I’m wrong.
---
If you really want to be a healer and are trying to decide between Priest and Shaman I have a few questions and comparisons that may help you decide. 
---
    First how important is PVP to you? Raid healing spec for a priest has very little crossover into PVP utility. Shadow IS a beast in PVP if you can afford frequent respecs. In comparison to shaman, after a few weeks of progression raiding you can switch to 30/0/21 Elemental/Resto which is amazing in PvP and still has capabilities to raid heal. While not *optimal* for healing, it's not such a very big difference in healing output. 
---
My second question is how hardcore will you be playing? Playing a healer means that a lot of farming options are a lot slower. If you are going hardcore and have an alt to farm with and fund your main than that opens up a lot of doors for priest. If you are casual and staying single character than the aforementioned 30/0/21 shaman spec will give you a bit more solo farming capabilities than a priest would. 
---
Last is what KIND of healing would you want to do? Priest healing incredibly efficient and has so many ways to improve yourself to become a better healer: down ranking, pre-healing, and avoiding over-healing.  Shamans are not as efficient as healers but they fill a niches that priest cannot. Shaman raid healing is second to none and Shaman utility from totems and wipe prevention(self res) means that they will always be in demand for raids
---
If you’re stuck between two choices, flip a coin. Your reaction to the first flip can tell you a lot about your true feelings.  i.e. if the coin lands on troll and you say ”well, ok, best 2 out of 3” then you most like want to play UD.
---
How do shamans tank without taunts?
---
These stats  are flawed though, it's not a "maybe" it's a fact. I'm not saying there isn't a community for it, but these percentages will not be the same if blizzard made one. 
---
The reason it's like this is because more then half of us here have played on private servers and on private servers pvp is the most popular. For that reason we want PVP aswell 
---
Fuckers.
---
What does this aura do? 
---
I’m struggling to follow this convo!
---
You just summon an infernal.....
---
So if we end up having no rp-pvp at launch, we're pretty much forced into going PvP because if they add rp-pvp later on transfers won't be possible from pve to pvp right?
---
I guess the RP was confusing not the pvp. Sorry for the confusion 
---
What Does the Bannish add? 
---
Doesn’t the bannish stop the chaos? 
---
No glancings in pvp, wep skill also give you some crit (0.04%) and decrease chance of enemys dodge, and parry for 0.04% for each point of skill. 
---
Anyway weapon skill isn't really affect in pvp, stone form and escape artist much more valuable. 
---
Essentially, RP-PvP servers are PvP servers that follow the same rules as an RP server.
---
So world PvP will be common like on normal PvP servers, but players will have to follow the same rules as they would on an RP server. For instance, you cant just name yourself "Sup3rSt4b" and call people n00bs; that would result in you getting reported and punished as a result.

Roleplay- player vs player server
---
This is why the optimal Horde defense is a handful of Rogues + Druids in stealth. Alliance defenders don't need stealth because the terrain benefits them.
---
This is great 
---
Your lack of knowledge on this topic is repulsive.
---
You would be surprised. I’ve gone from a 15” laptop in my lap playing wow. To a single 27” for several years. Then last year I got a secondary used monitor so I could YouTube or search info easy while playing. Then last month I bought a 32” 4K monitor. So now my setup is 32” straight on for gaming and my 27 next to it for other things. It covers my desk But honestly I don’t really find my eyes moving as much as you would think for such a large monitor. 
---
Leveled to 32 and power leveled the rest. 
---
How Does the banish help?
---
I keep reading this but I don’t get it! 
---
Totally agree on 24” minimum. 22s are just too small.
---
For Classic WoW I’d say get 144hz only if you want to splurge. They’re quite a bit more expensive, not really worth the extra cost unless you’re hardcore into FPSes or something, imho. 
---
What? How is this pertinent to a game design discussion? Of course I could craft my gameplay experience to exactly how I want if I could somehow coordinate 80 like-minded people, split between 2 factions, to join the same AV \*every time\* I play AV. I could also play on a server where no on uses flying mounts so that we get back the feeling of having everyone interacting with each other on the ground, if I somehow gathered several thousand people onto the same server with that same mentality. That doesn't seem like a likely scenario for me though (and \*of course\* the AV scenario is actually at least feasible in some special occasions, or for a limited burst of time where this stuff interests enough people). I don't know how it speaks to the typical situation people will experience though. 
---
Were all really excited to play but you gotta see it from blizzards point of view, if they say a specif date and end up having to change that date it will piss a lot more people off and make them look bad.
---
Worst case you might not be able to take two weeks off but might end up "sick" for a week.
---
We're technically supposed to remove these kinds of comments as a Rule #2 ("Gate-keeping") violation, but I'm reveling in your downvotes. Way to go, team.
---
Reckoning was never the number 1 dps for paladin aoe, it was always holy shield block damage and retribution aura, then later also consecration. Think about it, if you're pulling 10 or so mobs, you're only auto attacking one anyways. The other 9 are dying from everything else.
---
Yep. This is why I'm so torn between race for my alliance rogue. Like I'm going to be raiding, but that's only going to be like 3 hours max a week, due to quick clear times. The rest of the time will be world pvp/ranking shenanigans you know. And really, each race has it's niche in pvp, but I'm really leaning toward gnome right now due to the 1 minute root removal. 
---
It gets you out of engineering nets, novas, roots, etc. It's so good for melee.
---
I want RP-PvP servers, but I don't think what patch they base the game off is going to be pertinent to their decision. 
---
No hunters are the best class guys let's all play hunters in classic and raid with eachother
---
You lack perspective.
---
There's over 17,000 players pledged to RP-PvP, that's already more than five servers worth of players and we haven't even started considering people that aren't on this Reddit sub.

---
They all stack so regardless of those night elf is still a higher level stealth. Not saying its worth it or not, just that it's higher.
---
Yeah there's this weird view of RP here as a persistent thing and not what I (and most other RPers in modern MMOs) see it as: Basically just either walk-up or scheduled/organized typing theater. 
---
Because it's not that bad and the quests are really close together.  The horde hang out in Lakeshire or where the elites are  
---
So just don't bother with the elite quests and the GY is right across the water from Lakeshire.  You get the same issue in Duskwood, especially if some horde are farming grave moss.
---
Blows my mind that some people think RP-PvP servers didn’t exist in vanilla
---
You use only a single non curved 25 inch?
---
Once you're 40, prot is much much faster. Granted.you need to keep your armor up to date - full plate, good shield. But yeah, aoe grinding as prot pally is actually insanely fast and rivals mages. Problem is 1-40 is like playing as a damn westfall crab auto attacking for days
---
I want to say you are serious because some people don't realize RP-PvP servers came out in Vanilla, but I also want to say you are trolling because you called RP-PvP ruleset a QOL change. 
---

Over at the wow Classic forums I do think IF we can get if not ENOUGH likes Upvotes hearts or whatever have you, Blizzard will AT LEAST respond to this post, in some way shape or forum, if those of you who do want RP-PVP servers see this at least Like, or spread the word. Because I DO THINK blizzard will give us something if enough people ask, they don't seem to be truly unwilling, at least this is what i believe.   
---
EVEN if you hate RP do you really want Roleplayers on your PVE and PVP realms? You lose nothing by support it!
---
Is this confirmed? Iirc it was always most recent. If not, this is interesting and gives more reason (as if needed) to mash that purge ability from the start
---
Seems fair enough. RP-PvP was certainly the most niche of the 4 server options back in vanilla, so waiting to see if there's sufficient numbers of players to support it is a reasonable position. 
---
Been playing Dk since Wotlk and I can't decide between hunter and mage. I used to love how strong Dks were in solo play both pve and pvp. I am kinda lonely wolf in sense that I rather spend my time outside of raiding soloing instances, solo pvping or grinding cash. I never played Vanilla so would love to hear some opinions, which class fits my playstyle better if said things even are possible.
---
Not well  paladins had the same issue 
---
No, but this kind of polling data should be
---
25" 21:9 for main monitor. Secondary is 22" whatever.
---
Rp pve isn’t “a thing”. Rp is just known to be a pve server where people like to role play. 
---
I knew they came around sometime before I quit, but I quit in TBC, so I keep thinking that it started then.
---
No, you're whole post is steeped in emotion bias, you start with it in your first paragraph.
---
Its the most important aspect FOR YOU. You then go onto shit talk the devs for "Not wanting to code a few extra mobs", totally downplaying the amount of work it would take to get it semi accurate. 
---
You're mad because the obvious is happening and you didn't want it to or just tricked yourself into thinking it will be different. You're disappointed and are now coming on to this subreddit to complain.
---
I fully understand the issues with having 1.12.1, but to act like blizzard was going to do anything else is delusional. 
---
If you run in you have one go first who has to be out of range to all others. He soaks two beams one after another and needs to survive both.

In this time all people move to their alloted position.

---
I'll straight up refuse to raid in a loot council situation. It might work okay in retail where loot is largely meaningless anyway, but there's such little loot in Classic, and such competition for it, that trusting some 19-year-old college student GM to judiciously parcel out rewards among 40-60 strangers is a recipe for disaster. Especially in the age of the tiddie streamer. 
---
&gt; Getting rooted is extremely annoying,
---
it can be cleansed with talented sprint tho, right?
---
Good mod. Also, if 1.12 didn't have mods, we should do away with them also
---
If they don't make an RP-PvP server, I'm not playing Classic. Would be nice to know in advance so we can know if we're wasting our time or not.
---
To be fair, the default RP realm should be RP-PVP. The Horde-Alliance conflict is the integral part of RP in WoW. Being unable to attack enemy faction removes a lot of RP possibilities. 
---
Yeah you kinda don't want to use TF as a dps, it gives you a literal shit-ton of unwanted threat. You'd be able to a lot more dps with a shittier weapon overall.
---
Ally suck!! Horde for life!!
---
Ya, I personally believe there's going to be enough interest to at least field a medium pop (if not high) RP-PvP server in NA/EU. Not sure about other regions, but I think the attempt should at least be made. 
---
What isn't a "maybe?" Your statement is very vague. Also pvp private server players doesn't really bode in any way for players who want pve. Fact is 18k were polled and that's a pretty good sample size, and it's clear rpvp is a more popular choice within the community. What 1st timers will want, we can't say yet
---
I think what they should do is release a set number of realms, say 3 PVE, 3 PVP, 3 RP, 3 RP-PVP per region. See which ones fill up the fastest and every month implement 1-2 more depending on que times until stable populations are met.          
---
           
---
We know in the first month or 2 the retail tourists will leave and could lead to some pretty out of whack faction sides and low population (dead) servers.             
---
          
---
Does this mean the first month or 2 will be hell trying to log on and play? Yes. but the over all future health I think far out weighs the immediate aggravation, Blizzard can do surveys and we can do surveys but those numbers are not representative at all of what actual populations will look like.           
---
I cant even lock down what Faction and class i'm going to play but I'm supposed to know which server i'm going to play on?
---
We were all bad, bro.  These were the glory days before everything got simplified.
---
This is extremely upsetting, I must admit. So many of us took it for granted that there would be at least one, if not many more, RP-PvP servers.
---
I don't know how many others are in my boat, but personally I only wanted to play on an RP-PvP server. Without that option I won't be rolling a character on a Classic server.
---
Ahh so an RP server is playing a warrior or mage and staying “in character”
---
For sure. The blizzard a &amp; q kinda sounded like a "you think you do, but you don't" while all of us are like nah dude fr we want it
---
ruh-roh
---
From what I have read from someone thats going to try it, He is going to use earthshock as a pseudo taunt
---
The number of RP servers are just for 'naked nelf erp' comments I see in this sub would leave me to believe it's those losers.
---
...lol?
---
Literally the link you posted says 1200.
---
He's joking. I think?
---
this reasoning is badly flawed, and sums up in a nutshell why loot council is always unfair. 
---
I've had plenty of guildies over the years who haven't been able to socialise much due to having to play in front of their families, disability or social problems, or simply because of an age differential. And many of these guildies are far more loyal than the biggest Discord shit-talkers because they tend to be less dramatic. 
---
Your comment sounds exactly like the self-justifying rationalisation of the insider clique that always profit from loot council systems at the expense of everyone else. 
---
dme lasher is fine without reckoning
---
especially if u already 60
---
Ah, I thought I was missing out on some awesome late pre-tbc patch. Hope you feel better!
---
Thank you to whoever made this pie chart, i will also use it on the blizzard forums in hope we can get a response from them, 
---
What are they reconsidering? Did they announce no RPPVP servers? I can’t find anything in search
---
runes are 9s when honoured, 10s otherwise. 
---
This isn't entirely true. A NE with 5/5 subtlety could play on the edge of the duel if they suspect a perception pop. Then after 30-40 seconds start hunting. Duels were annoying like this, but you're right for the most part, walking at each other human w/ perception wins the opener
---
I would say hunter. They supposedly can solo princess runs in Mara.
---
OK, you're a brother (^^)
---
This survey could easily be false considering people could have selected RP-PvP just to skew the results. This would have been better on the actual wow subreddit. RP servers are more popular to my knowledge than RP-PvP. RP on classic won't be very high in the first place, considering retail have MUCH more RP capability. That means RP-PvP would have an even smaller population. Also, why RP on a server with PvP flagged in the open world. That just invites trolls to go out and kill people trying to RP in peace. You can't communicate cross faction, and if you DID you could just duel the opposite faction to fight. Blizzard already gave their reason in the live stream why they aren't likely at add this time of server. If you seriously want to RP then use the normal RP-PvE server.
---
Exactly, easter egg hints/winks with release dates are perfect since you can delay without actually announcing a delay, just deny the easter egg.
---
Jokes on you, I already started a year ago. 
---
I thought I was so badass for having it at the time lol
---
Well they did come pretty late during vanilla. Good thread though!
---
So coordinating large groups of people on today's tech is insanely ez, even from both factions. I.e. devilsaur mafia.
---
Is there anything technically different about an RP-PVP server compared to PVP server? Is it just the type of moderating the GMs use? (I have never played on an RP server)
---
There's nothing to confirm, dispel has always been random ever since it was [implemented.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dispel_Magic)
---
July 16 would be perfect, just after I finish Uni ^^ 
---
It's from [the second r/classicwow survey/census we held a few months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/)

If you follow that link and click on the goo.gl poll, you can take the survey yourself or click "View Previous Results" to see all the results.
---
Stickied post.
---
I raided on the horde side in retail vanilla, Razorgore was a massive pain.  
---
As my memory serves, the strat involved shamans frost shock and earthbind totem kiting the dragonkin along with hunters, running in circles around the room while everyone else was in the middle trying to burn all the other adds.
---
Well server type should be easy. Either you want world PVP or not.
---
Beyond that, if you can’t immediately come up with a reason to roll on an RP server, then you probably don’t need to.
---
As for faction, there’s the good guys and the Horde 😝
---
That's irrelevant. 8% of 18,000 respondents is 1.4k people. If half of all people who will ever play Classic responded to that surver, which is extremely generous, then that means there is at least 3k people wanting to play on RP-PvP servers. That's enough for a server.
---
That being said, 18,000 players is a very small portion of 1 million players. If actually 1 million people play Classic and the breakdown is remotely as this survey suggests, there will be enough for multiple RP-PvP servers.
---
This was back in WOD. I remember having like 1 totem and a 4 pack with a talent.
---
Everyone's upset about the RP-PvP server but what caught my attention is this: 
---
* The team wants to put the emphasis of community back into WoW.
---
* With that said, they also don't want to make people **feel like they can't play without other people**.
---
That last part... sounds mildly disturbing but maybe I am just overreacting.
---
I mean, it could be flawed, that's true. We also did share this survey around beyond just the subreddit, but we have no way to know exactly who responded.
---
You want an old school AV experience? form a premade of likeminded players and dedicate yourselves to turtling and recreating that. If you're on my NA pvp server alliance side I will happily join you. For the record I also would've preferred an earlier version, but you have to admit, Blizzard wouldn't have changed AV every single patch if people had been playing it in large numbers.
---
&gt;given the news of no RP-PvP servers
---
For at least some small portion of players, this is disqualifying news.
---
&gt;Do you think everyone on the planet will be playing lock?
---
Certainly not as much as the "big 4" of Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Mage. Lock has historically (and even on current classic pservers) not be a super popular choice. Now, it is a class that will attract people who are passionate or hardcore, because everyone knows lock could pwn some serious face in vanilla pvp. And mages will be popular, and spriests might be semi-popular as well, meaning there will be gear competition. 
---
Ty for the link, good to know. Makes this very important to dispel characters preemptively in order to be able to hit the shields
---
The Alliance had no intentions of attacking. Sylvanas' statement was that she felt it was only a matter of time with Genn breathing down Anduin's neck about it but he never really did. 
---
"You call for peace when it suits you" is genuinely the most disgusting piece of dialogue I have ever heard from Blizzard. Anduin barely even wanted to retaliate after the burning of Teldrassil. He's the only person that has been very vocal and active from the START about suppressing a war. 
---
This entire war boils down to Sylvanas having horrible motivations and the rest of the Horde following suit for literally no reason and in contrast to what they have ALREADY been through. It's poorly planned meant solely to advance a narrative that Blizzard got too lazy to deliver naturally. 
---
It's unbelievable. I'd post on the official forums if I had a subscription.

The survey could be very flawed, but if we take it at face value, there's 4x more interest in RP-PVP than in RP. It seems like a no-brainer to include at least one RP-PVP realm per region."
---
- from the Mod
---
I'm really tired, hit the wrong numbers on the calc.  It's over 1,400 people.  My point stands.
---
That's what I am planning to. You can heal 5-15 mans pretty easily as shadow spec too which is nice for finding groups while leveling.
---
So you'd just be a tourist, relying on others and their RP with only rarely feeling like interacting or even be in character, using movie quotes in a fantasy roleplaying scenario
---
Voidwalker still worth it to take a few hits and start pulls while.you finish a mob. It's a health sponge, use it. Nothing really competes until felhunter so you can eat up paladin bops etc
---
You need a break from the internet.
---
I too have done both sides, you have a point with the dungeons, the Alliance don't dungeon nearly as much as horde while leveling because of it, I've noticed.
---
1k Needles is shit except the shimmering flats which no one owns.  Ashenvale is hardly safe with all the high level Alliance characters moving to Felwood and Azshara.  In fact on any established realm there's almost certainly some asshat, level 60 male night elf hunter sitting where guards can't aggro him in Splintertree Outpost or a rogue chilling by the bridge just west.  The Alliance love to kill the flight master and quest givers at Crossroads.  Same goes with the griefing in Stonetalon, either gate keeping the one exit to Sun Rock or camping in the charred vale.  Badlands is shit for the horde, if not for the half dozen quests for Uldaman that originate there, I would never hit it up.
---
Point is there are asshats on both sides.
---
I hate to admit it but I like the Alliance questing experience a little more.  Those cooking quests and also not being stuck primarily in one zone for 30 levels is enjoyable. 
---
Horde do have more quests, so there is less grinding in the 40's and 50's.
---
I downvoted it because the results are going to be hilariously skewed due to asking AFTER the news comes out. People are charged up about this. Of course RPPVP is winning.
---
Also, there was already a 10K+ player census done and it showed RPPVP was nearly 3x as popular as RPPVE.
---
Finally - what good is this post? Couldn’t we have just continued discussing it in the post with the twitch clip? 
---
This is more spam ...so I downvoted it.
---
The best thing about being a moderator here is that I'm fully aware of how much money we're paid by Blizzard to delete anti-Blizzard posts and promote pro-Blizzard posts. It makes it really easy to see the other side of the conspiracy theories.
---
Hint: We don't get anything.
---
I played NE spriest vanilla from day one. (Personally I loved shadowmeld for leveling, arena, mind control drowning / jumping). Mana management is critical though, definitely an issue but also a strength. If someone is dispelling your dots then down rank to level one so their dispel costs way more mana than your spell, combine this with a few mana drains and they are screwed. 
---
Newer version of spriest pvp is more direct. Old version is more of a running battle. Melee is still an issue but pick up tailoring for net or engineering and it will help a bit. Also bubble rage starves warriors more in vanilla. Rogues are still a huge pain in the ass. 
---
What about when Genn attacked Sylvanas unprovoked in Stormheim? During peace, Genn attacked the Warchief of the Horde, destroyed one of the Alliance's best airships, got a bunch of people killed, and got no punishments for it.
---
&gt;which to the layman must mean that Vanilla is the superior game for role-players, right? In reality, the modern game offers much more to facilitate what has always been an incredibly niche meta-game. 
---
I've been roleplaying for a very long time and you have to understand people are interested in Classic RP servers for the very reasons you think make the current ones great. Transmog for me is a mixed bag I personally love and hate but there are other things, things that aren't small, whether we're talking about the old art style, the tone of 'old' world, or just the fact that you won't see someone running around on a pig mount with wings. Kevin Jordan brought up how Chris Metzen sent a MEMO to the devs at the time of WoW's developement basically scalding them, telling them that Tony the Tiger was not the night elves racial mount. The setting is completely opposed to the modern game.
---
Now, I also roleplayed on Defias Brotherhood RP-PVP EU side and largely what you're saying comes across as very sweeping, broad, bitter generalizations. Our server didn't die until Cataclysm and that was when the GM's stopped enforcing the server rules. We had armies of trolls turning up to try and gank us (most of them sucked) but over time it gradually wore people out so they started transferring to AD-EU. There are genuine problems with RP-PVP servers but a lot of what you're doing is speaking in absolutes because you can't see why it appeals to other people.
---
generally also promotes a more calm atmosphere
---
Every thing is hunter gear. 
---
That's what sick days are for ;D
---
In that sense, yeah I agree.
---
This is the correct answer - we would announce key reserved items in advance of the raid tier (usually just legendaries, quest items and certain trinkets), double DKP for progression hours/nights. 
---
Whether it's EPGP, DKP, DKP with auctioning (my favourite, for the entertainment value online) or suicide kings, they all achieve much the same thing - they distribute the loot fast, and minimise whining.
---
A lot of systems fall down because leaders try to contrive complex rule sets in reaction to items being passed over because of supposed DKP hoarding. In reality, 'hoarding' complaints usually amount to little more than untrue whining from rivals. But I remember we had one item in BWL *almost* disenchanted for lack of interest. I announced that in such situations, wasted loot will result in harsh action from the officers for every possible user of that item (an empty threat - no idea what we could've done) and it never happened again. 
---
This stuff isn't hard.
---
In what universe is there good news? Every poll made actually shows RP-PvP server interest on par with, if not *greater than*, interest for RP-PvE servers.
---
Yes please.
---
Thank you once more, sorry i never use Reddit but i will post this also in the OP hopefully it'll help it get more attention from blizzard. 
---
I’m going through it now and it’s looking pretty clean so far 
---
Yeah, I remember our first encounter with it. Same thing, instant death and my death log showed like 33,000,000 damage done lol
---
Absolutely. I don't care if boss resistance values are slightly inaccurate, etc. I get everything I need out of pservers. The only thing missing is the RP community.
---
Without an RP-PvP server I personally have no reason to play Classic. I was really looking forward to it :(
---
There was plenty of RP if you sought it out but it wasn't as required/expected in the RP-PVE servers.  I thought it was pretty ideal and the most authentic way to experience Azeroth if you came from the RTS games.  The player base generally tended to be a little more mature, and included the kind of people who actually liked the more open feel of a less crowded server.
---
I'm probably in a very small minority but the RP-PVP experience was one of the main things I was looking forward to in Classic, and I am not re-subscribing until there is an RP-PVP server.
---
A shadowmelded NE Priest standing by the 1000 needles elevator is a big pain.
---
Easier, but still requires effort to both build up and maintain. I've organized events before, just because it is successful doesn't mean it was easy. The time and energy to do that every time I want to play AV seems a bit crazy, when it would be reasonable to just go with a design that supports the original gameplay strategy I'm talking about. And again, I could play online games in a lot of crazy ways if I decided I wanted to coordinate a lot of people to play a specific way every-time I log on, but it would also be great if some games were just designed to support certain play styles. 
---
Like they just announced RP-PvP servers aren't coming with the launch. Now I could (and I did in 2004) get into a community that wants to RP on PvP servers, but it's a lot harder to advertise that a RP-PvP community exists on our server when we can only tell people about it by constantly advertising outside of the game (I could advertise in the game too, but I'd be missing everyone who hasn't already rolled on the server not knowing we exist there). It kinda helps if the server list just has RP-PvP right on it. This made our community difficult to maintain, and we eventually burned out. 
---
Here's my personal opinion on your post...and it's just that...my opinion.
---
Druid:  You know...during leveling you could more easily tank in feral than worry about using healing gear in a feral spec.  Why not have fun tanking during leveling, then healing at 60...unless you decide you actually like tanking and forget the healing all together....then you can spec feral for pvp and tanking.  Bear tanks can handle all of the dungeon tanking.
---
Also, as cat while leveling, if you have to suddenly step away for a bit, you can stealth and be alot less likely to get ganked while your gone...unless you're going aliance anyway and NE with shadowmeld.
---
As for priest, if you want to pvp as shadow, and heal as holy, you may end up needing to respec alot to actually be good in one or both, unless you are ok with doing a hybrid spec and being mediocre in both.  There may be a Disc spec that does ok for both pvp and pve...not sure personally.
---
You mentioned Warlock as a possible option...Warlock can pvp like a monster, and in the normal SM/Ruin raid spec.  So you could pvp and pve in the same spec.  Plus level 40 mount is free...so you don't have to deal with that, plus if you get good at Warlock, you are very formidable in pvp even in just blues.
---
It's like these guys live in their own little bubble. I know Ion was a hardcore raider in Vanilla...but you do realize one of the great things about Vanilla that has been lost over the years was the fact that the community was much closer and it offered for far more variety of things to do on the realm that didnt in involve just sitting in the city and queuing for dungeons or raids. 
---
Level a warrior and then level another class. You will notice how much easier the leveling experience is.
---
Way too limited of a play style. You're trash at questing, trash at pvp and can only grind certain mobs that will most likely be camped by mages. 
---
The people responding to polls right now are the most hardcore, and the ones who played private servers. The overall population of Classic isn't necessarily best represented by this cross section.
---
Oh my bad, I don't remember the last time I've used arrow keys for anything, so I somehow thought you meant A and D by arrow keys =/
---
But I don't see how the actual arrow keys would be usable though. You cant easily hit space bar to jump over obstacles if you're using them.
---
If you don't trust your guild then why do you play in it? Honestly.
---
Also most guilds don't have 1 player decide all the loot, there's a COUNCIL of officers/classleaders who decide loot, and when done correctly all loot is pre planned on a spreadsheet and you can see what you will get in advance. Can't really complain then can you? :D
---
But like I said, that is for dedicated guilds, if you are just normal guild then like I said DKP(or other point systems) is better because of the simplicity 
---
One of the biggest pia at lvl 10 while also being age 10
---
Lol you don't know what you're talking about. Holy shield is a waste of mana it's 4 charges on like a 10 second cool down. And also it's faster to 2h aoe grind with 4-7 mobs with how reckoining works on current pservers.
---
Decapitate a guy with an axe, and he bleeds for 30 secs.
---
Random is done correctly.
---
No changes.  
---
(No I'm just kidding, there should be an RP-PVP server option)
---
My friends? Oh most certainly. People on the internet, not a chance.
---
I hope that you're not making yet another judgment call on my capabilities based on an internet encounter and your standards of approval. But that's not possibly the case correct, right? I think you're better off just moving on fellow redditor.
---
Was never about you. Also "When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say." 
---
Enjoy Classic being ruined because you helped allow it.
---
Very very very very slightly.
---
I played on a rp-pvp server in wrath I believe. Outside looking in it was a normal pvp server but had so much more life. I'd support at least one but I'm not sure I'd even be playing on it. Depends where my guild ends up
---
I agree. But it is still a large voice that I think does carry a good bit of weight
---
No need to apologize. I appreciate your efforts in getting this passed on to Blizzard!
---
Thanks for fighting the good fight with me brother! :D
---
&gt; so waiting to see if there's sufficient numbers of players to support it is a reasonable position.
---
No it's not, it's not even remotely reasonable.
---
What would "there is interest" be in this scenario? People rolling on RPPvE servers? People rolling on PvP servers? Then what?
---
The release an RP-PvP server some months in, and there's no one left to roll there because everyone already rolled? Or only new people can go there? Absolutely idiotic.
---
The only reasonable thing would be to *release an RP-PvP server at launch,* and if it's underpopulated, merge it with an underpopulated PvP or RP server. That would be reasonable.
---
I guess it's because I believe that good content brings viewers. Having to promote your stream through memes instead of the content makes me think OP doesn't believe in his own content. Unless of course that content is making wow related memes, in which case gj
---
I remember rolling my paladin on Tichondrius day 1, then by the time I got bored of the Paladin, I kind of wanted to try RP, but also wanted to keep PvPing and by that point those realms were out.  I never rolled on any other server type.
---
O man, as a healer, I’ll never forget dragging all of the raid groups out lol
---
Imagine they announce the game and delay it, causing you to have "wasted" your time off. 
---
You're right. I don't know what pserver bugs are optimal, and frankly don't care. I leveled classic and leveled prot for fun on an alt. 4 blocks is 4 blocks is 4 blocks... You take holy shield and then consecrate. Say what you want , that's how it was done and that's how it'll be done in relaunch. 
---
Don't listen to anyone else - the BEST use of this is when you have to go to the washroom in the middle of a contested zone.
---
In order for the enemy faction to respawn at their base, you'd not only have to cap their GY, but keep it and kill quite a few of them while their GY is down. It takes at least 10 geared/organized people to trigger a turtle, more if they are meh geared or not coordinated. You need to be able to kill a significant enough of the zerg raid to screw up their attempts on the final boss. 
---
Alliance gankers usually hit up Stonetalon and grief them succulent lowbies
---
For a powerleveler? This is fine. Grind in off hours.  A pally can definitely hit the niche of powerleveling with the hours put in, and once you get even to like 35 or so you can start aoe but it's way way better at 40. Definitely not for pvp though, and you can still aoe most quest mobs.
---
But all those things you said are true of paladin's in general really
---
What if we want to do world PvP and also have the option to RP?
---
Theres a reason that PvP is at the top of the poll. World PvP is a big part of Classic, something that no expansion since has been able to effectively recreate due to flying or inherit system-wide faction imbalance (such as in BfA).
---
If we want to have world PvP and be able to dip our toes into roleplaying, RP-PvP servers are the only option. Roleplaying on a normal PvP server is next to impossible since immersion would be broken frequently by other players, and world PvP on an RP server is not an option due to having to toggle on. Since nobody else toggles on, there is nobody for you to fight. It completely kills world PvP. 
---
Its a free soulshard on a 1 hour cd and full vw cast time that takes up 1 bag slot when not in use.
---
You better off having just a soulshard in your bag to begin with. The trinket is overrated to hell and you'll nearly never use it and just takes up a bag slot. It isnt even practical, if the cast was instant It could have a cool pvp use but its not.
---
Kick ass scyth all the way.
---
&gt; If you don't trust your guild then why do you play in it? Honestly.
---
because world of warcraft is not immune to human nature. Asking a committee of people, even the best-intentioned people, to act with perfect altruism is unrealistic. It's also fallible in the sense that it not always clear who the 'best' player for a powerful item is - and in those situations, the loot council's tightest cronies will always win out. And that's not unreasonable - cronies can be trusted not to bolt.
---
So it's not about trust and friendship and good vibes, it's about people and their natural fallibilities. No manager in any real world company would recommend loot council, and rightly so.  
---
You are indeed wrong.
---
EPGP.   Nice balance between long timer raiders and newer members.
---
I’m in a similar situation, small child, working shifts, will probably manage to play a few hours a week in the evenings at best. I’m planning on sticking with warlock. The benefits of being a good solo class and free mount so not needing to spend time saving money for the mount seem more helpful to me than choosing based on what will get groups easiest. I’m even considering switching from undead to human for the rep grinding advantage. I feel like since there’s little chance of having time to level alts as well I might as well make my main the class I enjoy playing the most even if it might not be the optimum class for finding groups. 
---
Yup. I have already lost one friend depending on the actual release date. He had to pick a date and went for 3 weeks starting 10 July, he's hoping the 16 July rumor is true... if not then RIP him.
---
This is why we need a release date announcement Blizzard, please!
---
No RP servers would be better, don’t waste time and resources on something only people on Reddit/mmochampion/etc care about. Those servers will be the first to die anyway
---
Queues could already be an issue with BGs, splitting the queue might leave both parties unhappy. 
---
Did we waste a classic question on RP servers?
---
 I really want to play RP-PVP again.
---
 If we are not getting an RP-PVP server at launch, don't leave us hanging with "oh we might introduce them later".
---
 I won't play at launch if RP-PVP is "maybe coming later". I'm not investing in a character just to reroll. I'll just wait and miss out on the launch hype. If they tell us that RP-PVP is never going to happen, I'll just play PvP at launch and be happy enough. 
---
Well last time I played RP because most of the little kids are scared away from it, I dont RP but I always enjoyed watching others do it and not seeing people with retarded names was a giant plus but I'm debating with RP-PvP because I enjoy world PvP but... maybe not all the time so Im flipping back and forth on the 2.              
---
            
---
Faction I was thinking Alliance because I did nothing but Horde my first time through Vanilla so it would be a completely different point of view but then some asshole made a cartoon map of Tauren starting area and I dont think I can bring myself not to play my favorite race. So I got all that going on.                 
---
For Class I'm thinking Troll Mage as main and level Tuaren Warrior with wife to alleviate getting groups + questing on Warrior can be rough. I'm not 100% sold on Mage, I played it to 60 my first time in Vanilla and it would be nice to do something else, I thought maybe Orc Warlock, Orc Hunter or Orc Rouge..
---
These results basically confirm we don’t need anything but PVE and PVP servers. Roleplayers should be grateful they’re being considered at all
---
I would love to see more content designed with classic design philosophies.
---
Realistically I'm expecting TBC-C.  
---
PVP is not very important to me. I might pop in every now and then but I play MMOs for PvE.
---
I'll probably be juggling classic with Final Fantasy XIV so being able to farm on my main is preferred. I am definitely an altoholic but with how slow classic leveling is I want to focus on just one character.
---
I don't know what my preferred kind of healing is. I do like the idea of totems and giving buffs.
---
It sounds like between the healers shaman is the one I should play. Thanks for the help! Still thinking about maybe hunter or warlock though... I'm so indecisive.
---
I didn't say it was about me; I said it's entertaining when people post conspiracy theories about Reddit (which may be true on some subs, but I can assure you aren't true here) as if they know what's going on, but since I'm actually, literally, involved in the running of this subreddit, I can confirm we're not paid off.
---
You're more than welcome to repost this if you take out personal attacks. I'd also recommend you formulate your concerns in a more concise manner to make it more readable and less sounding like someone just venting at a situation they're unhappy with.
---
Ya, what part of no fucking changes do you not get.....jk of course
---
You get used to it. I've been running a 27in 4k curved screen for 3 years now and I really like it.  However, it's not a good choice for 2+ monitor setup since you really need it right in the center of your view.
---
Alright, so that eliminates colorblind mode as well.
---
Unless you are so dense that you seriously think that colorblind mode should be removed, then there is no reason for you to be arguing that RP-PvP servers shouldn't be in at launch.
---
The only people which the option to choose an RP-PvP server affects are RP-PvP players who want it. It's not like changing an ability which can affect raids or PvP battles, it's a server option that you will never even use unless you choose it. Which, considering your comment, you won't.
---
And, by the way, RP-PvP servers were in vanilla. They were added in 1.8, in late 2005.
---
So since you clearly dont know something that was in Vanilla for over half of its lifespan, you have no excuse to act all high and mighty trying to gatekeep and scream "No Changes" for every little thing when you havent even played retail Vanilla.
---
As someone who spent years doing that in retail, it can be a pain to have to seek out people willing to break a meta \*just\* to play the match in a way that actually matches the design of the map (why have all these places to fight over if we're gonna run past each other?). And while I can brush off complaints, it's still not ideal for anyone to be in a weird situation like that. Like I wouldn't want to be in a MC raid where 30/40 of the people were constantly complaining about basic raid content. It's like playing a pick-up game of Basketball with a several guys who complain about having to dribble the ball. 
---
OP isn't asking for advice from people who haven't played the game in 15 years. He's clearly asking about the current meta for leveling paladins
---
&gt;Every video shows people using /sit to gain reckoning stacks to easily kill multiple mobs attacking you
---
I don't think that's too bad of a thing. Not everybody has to spend most of their time RPing. You're still going to be playing the game solo for large amounts of time, grinding/farming and whatnot. But it still affords you the option to stop by a popular RP spot and talk to people in character.
---
I think as long as you participate with other people's roleplay and don't spoil it, I'd be fine with it.
---
Works for enrage or used to on my warrior so much fun sitting just to smash the guys face in. 
---
I think a big part of this is a matter of perspective.  I had a similar "wait, do I just not remember this?" experience when I started reading these "Warrior leveling makes WoW into dark souls" posts (okay, they're not THAT dramatic". Warrior was the first class I got above level 30. I had some unexciting "of the bear " 2 hander until around 34 when a guildie told me about the WW weapon and helped me get it.
---
But I don't remember thinking "wow, leveling this guy sure is painful.
---
Later, I'd level a warlock and a couple druids to 60, and having leveled a vanilla warrior again AFTER those more self sufficient classes that I noticed, yeah, there's a difference. The most noticeable being I'm more likely to die if I over pull. The other major difference being that gear, especially the weapon, matters a lot more. 
---
As an example, I think i used the crescent staff on my priest till I replaced it in ZF. I was aware my weapon was out of date but not largely bothered by it. Using the same weapon as a warrior for roughly 25 levels, however,  would become quite uncomfortable. 
---
I gotchu.
---
A 144hz TN panel is what you want. The response time is fantastic. Here is what I am personally using.

In the outside I’m just a geologist

But in here I am Falcorn defender of the alliance

Pretty awful hot take.

Heres a link to Vanilla Jame’s guide
---
They seriously need to hurry up, I need to tell my company early for PTO too. Can't wait to be getting paid to grind my mage...
---
So you're giving advice on things that won't be? Got it. Anyways, no, reckoning isn't a massive deal for aoe prot farming.
---
/Thread
---
There are quite a few chats where you dont have to stay in character, such as in party chat, raid chat, and trade chat, but essentially yeah.
---
What??? Thay said no RP-PVP??
---
Curved screens are a gimmick unless you're willing to drop some serious money on it. A 144hz tn panel monitor is what you want. 
---
Successful bait
---
Honestly, content bloat.  I get it, a live game needs new content to keep subscribers subscribed - but I remembered logging into MoP and it felt like I was playing one of those F2P games.  It felt like the game was just bombarding me with 20,000 features and gameplay elements.
---
I felt like content in expansions was shoveled in to create mass and half of those systems were never designed to work with what was there.  
---
\*Puts on game designer hat\*  
---
Good design; like really good design, works with systems that exist already and add onto them in ways that create meaningful feedback loops for players.  Take the gated Titanforge system - it's not designed to work with any other game system out there, it's just a whole new layer they piled onto the game.  It circumnavigates a lot of the core systems that are already in place, like loot drops.  
---
Wow expansions added interesting content, but each expansion invariably added some of this bloat content which didn't really do much to add to the game, but did add excess that players needed to learn about.
---
I am not saying it is a good situation, just what one can do. I don't think the actual version of AV matters as much as player intent. It would be hard to make a slow AV appealing to enough people, since it needs 40v40, but if it is not rushable, a lot of the players will just ignore it. It is sad, but true, that players will be more goal oriented, most want to do AV for the rewards only.
---
For the most part. I mean, my guild went out of character in guild chat, instance runs, and raids. Unless it was specified in guild events that it was an IC (in character) run. 
---
No, that is not a given at all. Tier lists are created to communicate meaning along the lines I have suggested. For example, hunters, warlocks and druids are all tier 1 levelers. That still leaves plenty of room for hunters to be the best levelers, ”period” as you like to say. Very few people claim that this is not so, yet putting warlocks and druids in the same tier as hunters is meaningful and conveighs the message, that these classes level quite fast indeed. 
---
For tanking the following tiers are meaningful:
---
Tier 1: can tank raid content consistently
---
Tier 2: can tank dungeon content consistently 
---
Tier 3: can tank low level dungeons
---
Tier 4: can tank situationally
---
Your ranking system is meaningless and does not conveigh much of anything, e.g. 
---
Warriors
---
Druids
---
Paladins
---
Shamans
---
Warlocks 
---
Hunters 
---
Rogues
---
Priests
---
That ranking did not say much at all. In fact, as I originally claimed, it simply says ”warriors are best lol”. 
---
I totally forgot about fear beast too. Hunters have some toolkits to fight druids, but in my experience the hardest part wasn't "winning" the fight, it was actually forcing the druid to stick around long enough to die. 
---
If they really wanted to (and Pallys bubblehearth), they could get away. They usually would do that when they realized they were losing.
---
The numbers on live servers tell a different story though. Blizzard would look to there stats first then take player feed back.
---
The correct answer is still if they ever plan on putting in RP-PVP they should do it upfront.
---
Ditto - I can't imagine why there wouldn't be at least 1 RPPVP server, much less evidence or statements thereof. 
---
Someone else who used emergency meters, nice! 
---
I played Vanilla on private servers on and off until 2017 and I always used CT mod for the emergency meters. Hope there is something similar once Classic drops. 
---
Ugh, so much this. I feel like the win rates are 80/20 for alliance. I mained alliance back in the day, I didn’t really feel the imbalance until I had an alt horde character.  It seemed to balance out decently if you could rally a defence, but most people were content with trying to race for the win to prevent a turtle match. 
---
I’m pretty sure backfiring the alliance side isn’t going to exist in classic. So good luck horde. 
---
No current plans unless people show enough demand, it seems. Check stickied post on this subreddit.
---
In my guild, tanking gear was basically gifted to the MT and OT and no one complained about it because, duh progression.  However, that didn't include DPS gear and neither the MT or the OT who was mostly fury got their DPS gear ahead of the rest of the warriors since they recived less DKP due to the free gear they picking up.
---
Fair enough the time limit or the max number sold is just a number that can be changed.
---
&gt; But I remember we had one item in BWL *almost* disenchanted for lack of interest. I announced that in such situations, wasted loot will result in harsh action from the officers for every possible user of that item (an empty threat - no idea what we could've done) and it never happened again. 
---
The correct action would be to disenchant every item that those possible users wanted for the rest or the raid. 
---
If your gonna be spending that much. The Dell S2417DG regularly goes on sale at $300 and is 1440p 165hz. I've used it for a couple years and it's amazing for the price. 
---
&gt; If they were going to settle with one RP type, one would assume it would be RP-PvP
---
I'm not a heavy RP-er, but it seems to me if I were I would be MUCH more inclined to see RP-PVE of the two, since it allows for consensual, opt-in world PVP in the form of flagging without allowing unscripted PVP to cause havoc when you're trying to roleplay out in the world.
---
Dude, I need +damage for arcane shot.  Duh!
---
Naw dude not really, you mind flay. 
---
I’m not an RP player, so I might be off target here... but why not make PVP, RPPVP and RP-PVE seeing as many players on all realm types engage in the pve content anyway? Like I plan on rolling on a PVE server. If the only options were RP-PVE I wouldn’t mind at all. As much as I understand it, no one is forced into actually RP anyway? 
---
Again, I’ve had no experience on RP realms so please correct me if I’m missing a major point here.
---
I know all the class/race combos I'm going to do, so I'm good there, but I am anxious about picking a good server. One that retains a good population and faction balance. It's kinda just luck-of-the-draw, so the anxiety comes from it being out of my control.
---
There is one downside to rolling a hunter:  No one will value you in groups.  People are so used to huntards and because you don't have a lot of flashy animations like mages &amp; you sit in the back fighting that no one will notice when you do something awesome.
---
I'm not saying there isn't a community for it, all im saying is this pool is the MOST hardcore players, so many players wanna play vanilla wow but dont go here. Only the ones that are "really" hardcore does, for that reason alone the pool doesn't show the real stats, because a pool should be neutral (random people) and not specific. It's like going to a rich area IRL and ask for Dem VS Rep and then 80% is Rep and then saying "80% will vote rep this year".
---
U can't take stats from 1 place, it just doesn't work
---
I wonder if 1,415 responses for RP-PVP server is enough responses to build and maintain a server? Hoping of course that those were unique responses and not from people selecting multiple answers.
---
I think it would go quite a long way in preventing the Zerg matches. I think it would be good for honor gain to be changed to match. 
---
While a lot of the most hardcore pvpers don’t farm AV for honor zerg AV’s were a good alternative for single players who don’t just steamroll the opposite team every game in WSG/AB. 
---
For reference, the first RP-PVP server was launched in 1.8, so yes it was in vanilla. I hope Blizzard just adds an RP-PVP server, I can't image why not to
---
I'm answering the exact questions he asked, did you even read the post? And yes it's a massive deal, with /sit not working reckoning will no longer be the #1 leveling spec. You continue to comment on something you aren't knowledgeable on.  
---
Recapping groups tend to work better than a lot of strong point defenders.  
---
Honestly I'm surprised that Blizzard hasn't polled the playerbase yet to at least get a rough estimator on how many players they will have / the number of servers they will need at launch.
---
Only one choice was allowed at a time, I believe, and required a Google account to login/respond. I doubt people were stacking the deck as the survey was done months ago. 
---
This survey is likely only a fraction of all people that'll play Classic, so I would look more at the percentages than the raw numbers.
---
If you really want to play the best rogue in a rogue v rogue fight, you should be alliance and play Orc (stun resist racial). 
---
The best rogue on the alliance side for "rogue v rogue" is definitely dwarf (can cleanse stuff and vanish). Escape artist is pretty good for gnomes. Shadowmeld doesn't really do much for nelves. 
---
Maybe at dinner then.
---
Only in /s and /y (and /me). Every other chat is considered entirely out of character.
---
Honestly I can't decide wether this is a troll thread or not, either this trinket is very situational or I'm missing something.
---
yessir
---
Idk how you're getting the appropriate levels unless you're grinding mobs.
---
The way I do it (and most I know) is Elwynn-&gt;Loch Modan-&gt;Westfall-&gt;Redridge. 
---
\*draw out my greatsword and strike you across the mouth, silencing you from speaking again\*
---
Yeah for sure. I wouldn't want a major change of honor gains to the point where the out perform running WSG/AB premades, but I think a slight increase in honor gains would definitely encourage longer games as well and be mutually beneficial to both types of players. 
---
The thing about prot is it's op for most people's idea of tanking. I had 2 warr.s in vanilla, the first I barely tanked ever, the 2nd I leveled by doing mostly instances, instance prequests, class quests and the occasional quest that's 'necessary', like skull of impending doom and so forth.  What prot spec (and lots of blue gear from instances) allows: tanking instances 3-4 levels below the level of the final instance boss, eg gnomer at level 30-31.  I think I started gnomer at 30, did it 6 times on that warr (about half the runs thru the back door) and stopped at level 32 or 33, and got every drop I needed.  
---
The knee jerk thing is "leveling in instances is slow" and most people on here will parrot that.  But they don't seem to realize that it depends on how fast you run instances and also at what level you run instances.  I think I had right around 7  days /played on that char at 60. I had some blue experience of course because it was an alt, so not good but not bad.  Another thing, it made it fun and challenging. I was not looking forward to leveling that character at all and it turned out to be ok.  A last thing, obviously on that character, I wasn't worried about the "wow experience", world pvp in stv/hillsbradTM et al, or anything other than getting it over and done with.  If you're not "speed running to 60": playing 20 hrs a day and out ahead of the pack, several zones are going to bottleneck you with through low spawn rates and pvp.  In instances you don't have to worry about spawn rates or getting ganked.  
---
As a sometimes-RPer with a different perspective, I suppose to you: isn't part of the fun of roleplaying out in the world going to be the inherent possibility of some havoc interrupting? The more I've played RPing games, and the older I've gotten, the more I feel that an over-concern with scripted situations and consensual procedure of events tends to neuter things a bit. Which is fine, in some ways and for some folks, but there's something to be said for that touch of tension that comes from lacking easy control over the circumstances.
---
Reckoning isn't the main point of AOE grinding for prot paladin. 
---
AOE damage is generated by: 
---
Ret aura
---
shield spike
---
consecration
---
Blessing of sanc +damage when block
---
holy shield
---
Ret aura is free all the time and honestly a decently high % of overall damage done. consecration as we all know is high mana, moderate damage. 
---
The AOE'ing prot paladin doesn't really take off until about low level 40s when you can get consecrate plus blessing of sanc.  BoS is a big one for reducing a HUGE amount of damage you take (20 off of every hit adds up ridiculous fast).  redoubt means you are blocking all the time presuming you get crit once in awhile.  And every block means a decent chunk (maybe 5% of HP) damage returned to the mob via blessing of sanc and shield spike. 
---
to start the fight judge wisdom and seal light, consecrate, holy shield (if you have it closer into the 50s) and keep autoattacking for procs.  You have to have occasionally use divine shield or BoP to heal yourself and even LOH occasionally to stay alive.  Potions/etc all apply as well.  
---
Reckoning doesn't work AOE grinding.  Even with abusing the mechanic.  If you have a 2h out, the mobs will eat you alive and you don't get any +damage from blocks with a huge part of AOE damage.  single target damage is fine with reckoning, but you won't be able to kill 10 mobs at once with it.  You just won't put out enough damage (despite the big burst of reck bombs) and will take to much, making you use all your defensive CD very inefficiently.  
---
3 consecrates is pretty much a sweet spot.  By the time the third one finishes, some mobs are close to or already dead and you can clean up the rest.  Holy shield is most efficient with no more than maybe 5 mobs alive, otherwise the damage spreads out that much more and consecrate does more damage/mana. 
---
LFR inc
---
If you were a  PvE main you were more than just geared for it lol. Agreed on the specs though for the most part 
---
Thanks, my dude!
---
&gt; For tanking the following tiers are meaningful:
---
&gt; Tier 1: can tank raid content consistently Tier 2: can tank dungeon content consistently Tier 3: can tank low level dungeons Tier 4: can tank situationally
---
Which tanks would you put in each tier then?
---
&gt;That ranking did not say much at all. In fact, as I originally claimed, it simply says ”warriors are best lol”.
---
You are just unwilling to accept Warriors are the only complete tank and clearly superior to Druids.
---
Troll is the superior race for all priests in vanilla, both in PVE and PVP, especially for shadow priests 
---
Mainly because of shadow guard, most players don't realise just how good it is. Its damage scales very well with gear and each of the three charges procc shadow vulnerable as well as having a chance to procc blackout.
---
Unbuffed with my blue pvp gear on a pserver, every charge hits for about 350 damage. Three charges will cause over 1k extra damage to your opponent, without having to do anything since you buff it before the fight. When it runs out during a fight just pop it again for a another 1200+ damage (with shadow vulnerability on your target it does even more damage). It has no Cd and it barely cost any mana either as opposed to undeads devouring plague.
---
Don't be fooled by people telling you to roll undead for pvp. I've had both an undead and a troll spriest at lvl 60 and I would never pick undead over troll because shadow guard is just too damn good. 
---
Even for healing troll is the best choice because of berserking which increases cast speed = awesome for healing. Pair it with a demonic rune for best effect :).
---
This is also the reason why the most hardcore horde guilds on private servers require their priests to be trolls. 
---
So you want Pve, PVP, and RP? Too many P's you greedy sob.
---
Why would you want to play horde tho.
---
You had awesome bags. That was a lot of space.
---
Well fear beast isnt that great, it has a cast time and the druid can go out of form for a sec to avoid it. (It's nice if you can manage to catch him off guard or if he is in a situation where he can't afford to go out of form).
---
But yeah if a druid want to get away, you can't really stop him easily.
---
Because you get to kill all those self-righetous pricks that call themselves "paladins". Isn't that the best reason to roll horde?
---
Another reason is that there are so few Druid’s that you my never encounter one. 
---
I don't get it, can someone explain? It this referring to Classic coming out this summer or is it a corrupt GM joke?

I played Horde. Why is Redridge so bad for ganking?
---
DKP weighted towards from progression raids only with a silent one time bids to avoid people running up the price of items.  Most of the DKP should come from doing new content, not farming the old stuff and is weighted accordingly.
---
I believe in DKP because people deserve to spend what they've earned from raiding. 
---
Im Gonna play av like 15 years ago

Enter, open map and check for Zergs, zerg, and Flame others for not knowing htf2p

You will not be disrupted during your RP events on a RP realm. There will be toxic players who ruin your social events on a PvP realm if you were to declare a PvP realm as an unofficial RP realm.
---
I totally see this happening on a PVP server.
---
/ ESS
---
Mage or warlock? I want to raid mostly and pvp just for fun.
---
So many people haha. Never raided with 40 people so this picture is weird to me haha. Am looking forward to it though. Hope I will find a good guild.
---
Hm, I don't know, at least on EU, all RP-PVP realms had to be connected via cross realm, and are still not the most populated RP server in english. Despite being made up of 4 or 5 realms.  
---
The german one is actually bigger bei roughly 50%, but yet again 6 different realms got merged.  
---
Not to mention that RP in general is unpopular with less than 10% of total players.  
---
So I have to disagree, and the maturatiy argument doesn't hold as well IMO. People can be immature regardless of age, there will be a lot of fresh blood anyway. (I'm not saying the average 25+ is equally as immature as a 14 yr old, but I've seen plenty of negative examples on both sides).
---
From my memory RP-PvP servers in retail vanilla were small but significant for the actual players because of their active choice to play on one. Looking at the discussion here and the LFG thread, the interest seems to have increased as well. Even if the new surge of RP-PvP:ers don't stay loyal I think the core should have their RP-PvP option regardless. It's a ridiculous thing to scrap considering the ease of implementation.
---
I leveled a druid and the primary reason I rarely ganked other druids: A) they were rare and B) the fights lasted forever.  You ever watch 2 pallies duel for 15 minutes and no one is winning?  Druids are not much better and it really wasn't worth the effort.
---
Never played on one but I feel like an Rp-pvp server seems like it's perfect if you want pvp but hate random ganking. As the RP'ing seems like it would control the griefing aspect.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?spell=2053#taught-by-npc This level 10 spell? 75 mana for 135-158 base healing had a high enough coefficient that it was doing 700?
---
Tested on a PS and saw a 430 heal in mostly epic gear, but not raiding naxx level. Maybe that is worth it if you plan on ooming, but I stand by the 13 healing overall being more beneficial to your staying alive scenario than 10 int is to heals much later down the road. Same for 10 stam unless you are topping off completely which is also possibly bad.
---

Who knows it just is

Enh and Demo.. 
---
You have tank / heal / DPS covered and should be able to solo any group quest.  Voidwalker starts with aggro, gets a few heals from shaman.  at some point VW loses aggro but not before a lot of damage is done, and then you can kite it with frost shock or sac VW / feldom another to keep the lock alive.  
---
And for regular pulls, shaman can put out great sustained DPS if they aren't using much mana on heals.  So warlock does the usual "kill 3 things at once very slowly' and the shaman gives a heal to the VW once in awhile and supplements DPS without trying to pull threat.  You'll be able to kill nonstop.  Shaman can catch a drink while lock starts the next pull.. it'll never end. 
---
I think you're misinterpreting me if you think my message is that RP-PvP servers shouldn't be made.
---
Like I said in my post, I wasn't expecting RP servers at all. Some RP servers are better than no RP servers.
---
Prior to today, I thought there wouldn't be any RP servers. After today, I know there are going to RP-PvE servers. That's an improvement.
---
Could it be better? Yes, but it's better than nothing, which is what I assumed we'd get.
---
*n.b.* this turned into *way* too long of a comment but w/e I had some time to kill; I hope at least some of this is useful.
---
One thing that hasn't been mentioned that I would suggest anyone considering a 2 monitor set up is to think about the bezel (ithe bit of plastic "frame" around the outside of the screen).
---
With just one monitor, having a thick bezel isn't really a huge deal, but as soon as you have two side-by-side, if your monitors each have say, a one inch bezel (fairly wide but not unheard of especially on more budget friendly models), all of a sudden you have a 2 inch wide strip of plastic in the middle of your display.  This is less of an issue if you're going to just treat them as two separate displays on your desk, but if you're going to treat it as just one, extra wide display, a thick bezel can be really ugly.
---
As for specific monitors, I have the Dell S2716DG (or S2716DGR, it's the same monitor, just the R is appended depending on the vendor), as my primary gaming/work monitor and I love it.  I do research/data analysis so I do a a good amount of coding, reading, and writing, and having a 27 inch, 1440p monitor is *so* nice for that.  Just look at [this image](https://sarahtherebel.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-estate-chart.jpg) for an idea of how much extra real estate you get with 1440p, and I think 27 inches is the sweet spot for really getting to appreciate all those pixels.  My secondary monitor is just some random HP enterprise piece that I "borrowed" from my dad's home office that isn't the same size (it's some non-standard size/resolution) so I don't have mine set up as a single display, but a nice thing about the Dell is that it has a super slim bezel if you want to go the two monitors as one route.
---
You specifically asked about smaller monitors, though.  Dell makes a 24 inch version of that monitor (S2417DG) that regularly goes on sale for ~$250 (keep an eye on r/buildapcsales for whatever you end up buying).  I don't have any experience with 1440p at that size, but I've heard that's about as small as you want to go with that resolution (and honestly, I think I would have a hard time going back to 24 now anyway, since 27 is such a treat).  The 24 inch has the same slim bezel though, has a max refresh rate of 165hz (versus the 27's 144hz which is probably a negligible improvement but it's not nothing).  If you get two of them, it'll look really clean and I can't imagine you'd be disappointed in the performance.  Note, these are both g-sync monitors, so if you're not running a g-sync compatible GPU, you'll be paying a little extra for tech you won't be able to take advantage of.
---
Obviously I don't know the nature of your work to know if you would benefit from the larger display, but I would recommend at least considering it if budget and desk size allow.  Going from 23 to 27 was so nice for me, and the only downside is that my desk used to feel really big but now it doesn't have room for much other than a few papers, my keyboard, monitor and something to drink.  I still think it's worth it, and if space is an factor, the footprint issue at least can be mitigated pretty easily with a wall mount or a stand, [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Monitor-Standing-Adjustable-Screens-HUANUO/dp/B074K35TJZ) for example, as both Dell options are compatible with the VESA 100x100 standard.
---
The retail price point for the 27 is way too high ($800 lol) but it's always on sale, and as the big sales are often announced a week ahead of time if you buy from Dell, you can buy secondhand gift cards online for a discount.  I snagged mine last summer for $400 from the Dell website using four $100 gift cards that I had bought the week prior for $90 each, and the monitor came with a $100 gift card as part of the promotion, which I then sold online for $85.  It was a little extra work, but I got a brand new (supposedly) $800 monitor for ~$275.
---
tl;dr
---
Dell makes good monitors that you can get for pretty cheap if you're patient, and depending on your use case (and especially if your GPU supports g-sync), either the 24 or 27 inch DG series option would be pretty dope.
---
Back in vanilla I thought that the more towers you had alive when you won the more honour you got. As well as honour for each tower you burned. 
---
&gt;Every tutorial for leveling paladin recommends switching to prot at a certain level to get the 5/5 points into reckoning. Every video shows people using /sit to gain reckoning stacks to easily kill multiple mobs attacking you. Knowing this will not work, will AoE grinding work while leveling, and is gold farming as a prot pally still viable at max level?  
---
&gt;If so, what builds do you recommend that don't use reckoning?
---
Yo, you're pretty dense. You are giving OP information pertaining to pservers exclusively when he is asking about classic. He is misinformed, and you are not giving him any proper information. It seems I'm the only one of the two of us that has *any* experience with vanilla protection pally leveling, or are you purposefully withholding that?
---
If OP asked about frontstabbing and you start giving information about fronstabbing as if it is a part of classic rogue leveling, you're an idiot. Same is true for this.
---
The fact still remains: Prot Pally AoE grinding is superior to every other form of paladin leveling, and superior to many other classes *at level 40* \- prior to that, paladins have a slow, slow life.
---
Holy shield is exceptional because it negates damage aka downtime while continuing to add DPS, albeit small. Add a shield spike and this is even better. 
---
Each block is dealing 80 dmg, so holy shield is adding 32 dps. I may have been wrong to say rushing for holy shield at 40 is optimal, consecration may be better even at 40, but I'd have to refresh on that. 
---
This is good too, if you're living off fat stores you aren't pooping as much.  Still gotta keep the #poopsock# handy though
---
Eh.... to an extent, but I think most RP players are also hardcore, PvE or otherwise, so again, I think this is pretty fair extrapolation. Also, where did this poll take place? A discord server? A forum? Here? I agree, this is still biased towards the more 'hardcore' gamers for relaunch.
---
Even if you're not participating, as long as you're not being disruptive I don't see a problem with it. When I was playing back during Vanilla/BC, I was part of a guild on Kirin Tor (RP server). Fully 1/3 of our ranks were people who weren't particularly interested in RP, but they liked the laid back atmosphere of the server and understood they could just pass by others doing role playing without engaging. I thought it worked out pretty well.
---
Maybe, I can't recall honestly. But honor imo isn't the issue. It's pragmatic minded people fighting between reputation grinding and epic warfare. I say why can't we have both? 
---
Funny guy Brook over here !
---
This is incredibly disappointing and doesn’t even make sense to me. Why not have at least one RP-PVP server? I don’t know much about servers, but is it that hard to make just one, if they already have RP servers and PVP servers. Isn’t the infrastructure and work mostly done? 
---
A poll I saw on this subreddit showed that RP-PVP servers were as popular as regular PVE servers. So the demand is definitely there. 
---
I’m so shocked that they responded as if they had no idea there was a demand. Do they research and spend time in their communities (including this subreddit)? How do we show blizzard that we want this?
---
Imagine gatekeeping an RP server.
---
Wasn't aware of that 10k player census, good to know, thanks for the info.
---
Really, really good points. Thanks for your input. Considering lock now.
---
This is true and there's even more to it..
---
Create a new thread with everything you said and maybe include what the guy replied quoting his "RP-PvP servers die when there are no GMs enforcing RP-server rules"
---
People are fucking delusional if they think blizzard is spending anything to have GMs enforcing RP rules LMFAO
---
Kill this shitstorm overreaction about no RP-PvP already
---
Ty
---
Not even blizzard knows if classic tbc will be a thing, let alone how it will be rolled out.
---
The downside is you have to look like a troll.
---
" I would say the opposite - hardcore players are more competitive, more vocal about perceived bias, and need more intelligent management. Loot council is catastrophic in this situation. "  
---
Well, all hardcore, successful guilds use loot council. So I suppose what you "say" doesn't really matter.
---
New troll here! Who ja wanna kill?
---
When I was leveling in vanilla I did see this, I don't know if it will carry over to classic though
---
I’ve got a Best Buy gift card. The world is mine.
---
I’m sad about this announcement, but I’m more concerned about how disconnected and uninformed they are about their own community. That is more disappointing to me than anything because it shows me that more mistakes like this are likely to follow. I sincerely hope I’m wrong.

Point Based Systems are bad for progression. They cause people to skip loot that would be good upgrades for them because they are greedily holding out for their favorite weapon or something. They make people act in ways that are not conducive to a successful guild. Loot council is best. If you hate loot council, you were in a shitty guild, or you were a shitty player.

A typical sword and board tank wants 6-9% hit. A DW tank wants just as much hit as the DW warrior.  Accuria has tank stats on it, and lets you get 2 hit in one slot, letting you wear more mitigation gear while maintaining your hit.

In my current tabletop group one of the other players absolutely loves to play thoroughly cliched characters. A fat Wagnerian opera singer named Helga, complete with horned helm and conical bronze bra, who thinks she's utterly gorgeous and constantly flirts with just about every man she comes across. A big, dumb ogre barbarian named Ugg Nugg who loves furry critters and little kids. An 80s hair metal rocker bard named Pantera Wolfasbane who chews up the scenery with the worst cheesy puns you've ever heard.
---
He's playing the last one right now in a Curse of Strahd campaign. It doesn't fit the theme of the setting *at all,* which irritates me sometimes, being a world building and setting nerd, but part of participating in a social activity like role playing is coming to terms with the fact other people enjoy different things in different ways than you do. At best you learn to let the things you don't like slide and roll with it; at worst you just don't play with that person.
---
In either case, criticizing them for enjoying what they do is thoroughly unhelpful.
---
So for all other classes, whenever you see a druid, kill em!!! 
---
I know. It was in response to reverting the npc nerfs. The post I replied to.
---
When they announced W3 remaster it's date was December 2019.
---
Its situational to the point that if u actually use it twice during classic you have overused it.
---
If the scyth is in phase 1 you better of getting that as pre bis.
---
Either way people got to do as they prefer but all the guides pushing it as the go to item are just plain silly.
---
If you read your own link you might learn something. 
---
from https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor
---
"Thus, armor exhibits diminishing returns with respect to the total amount of healing needed to keep a tank alive." 
---
and 
---
"However, in terms of absolute time to live with respect to melee attacks, armor has no diminishing return effect."
---
This discussion always halts at the same problematic, where there are two colliding views. While it might mathematically correct to say that the first point of armour is as valuable as the last from eHP but when it comes to dps taken it is not. 
---
This is actually true simply because RP-PvP servers need GMs constantly enforcing server rules or else the trolls take over.
---
There is no way blizz is paying to have GMs constantly enforcing RP server rules and if you think otherwise you're fucking delusional.
---
Heck yes! 
---
I mentioned it in my write up of [the joys of Druids](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i_envy_those_rolling_druid_for_the_first_time/), but it's definitely a phenomenon that deserves its own topic. Druids are the most favorable class in Vanilla IMO, rivaled only by Warlocks. 
---
 You are wrong. You will get "randomly" ganked. But it will be a paladin who kills any undead on sight, and you are playing undead. Or there will be pirates on the theramore boat who won't let you cross. Or a raiding party will be tearing through Stranglethorn. Or your because their guild hates your guild. 
---
 Luckily there will be people you can turn to. The rogue only guild that will hunt your tormentors down for a small fee (shoutout to &lt;Vile Thorn&gt;.  There will be proud members of your faction that will fight with you. 
---
 Of course there will be people playing that "just want to pwn roleplayers". People trying to ruin roleplay events for lulz. Some people are just kill on sight kind of players if they think they can win. A war can break out just about anywhere. 
---
 You will still get ganked.
---
I am not about that troll life, but trolls in shadowform do have a very satisfying appeal for some reason
---
Don't forget you can both shapeshift out of eachothers roots.
---
Why be an offtank then? What is the motivation?
---
Blizzard doesn't tell you a release date unless they are certain it will be released by that date. Be happy you got anything at all. They could have said nothing and people would be wondering what yeat it was coming out not if it's in 2 months or 5.
---
You forgot DODGE &gt; OVERPOWER... Miss... die
---
I leveled on medivh, but later than this. It's a nice pic for everyone who insists there was no pvp on pve servers. I saw a lot of it!
---
&gt; fucking delusional.
---
This entire post is a fevered nightmare
---
You know you, and everyone else who role plays can still RP on a PvP server right? Feel like lots of people have been overly negative the past couple updates.
---
Sure, you can argue that without having a dedicated server for it there will be tons of disruption and whatnot from non-RPers. But let me tell you as someone who’s been playing on Emerald Dream since WOTLK that there will always be disrupters and trolls.. dedicated servers don’t really stop that. That’s what ignore is for right?
---
It’s very possible once servers are out that the RP community (via wow forums or reddit) determine which PvP server to inhabit, and that server will become known for RP. One or two years down the line that server can be known for that community and blizz can simply update that server type to RP-PVP.
---
RP-PVP servers are fantastic, not only because the faction balance is usually close to 50/50 but also cool world events that people can organize happen - leading to mass scale PvP if things escalate. That's Vanilla to me!

&gt; You will not be disrupted during your RP events on a RP realm.
---
That’s just not true... I’ve seen countless disruptions on both MG and ED over the years.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer!
---
Well I have no expertise in this so I wanna be clear I am not correcting you I am asking. Are you accounting for the difference between griefing and ganking. Griefing as I understand it. Is when someone who is far more powerful then you. Kills you over and over again for no discernible reason other then that he is a dick. I feel like if an RP dude kills you. Wouldn't he have some kind of reason? 
---
you can try :)
---
Won't be joining this guild that's all I can say.
---
But that's a report worthy action on RP realms, right?
---
I fully agree.
---
I am one of those that expect myself to be able to play 18h each day for 2 weeks at release. Recently I have started to understand the physical strain this can have on the body. I will actually try to practice playing that much before release; maybe take a friday off and play 18h straight for a couple of days to get the feel of it. Maybe my body is not built for this anymore. (not 19yo anymore lol)
---
Yep they were usually nice to me, until their friends can't along and murdered me and they /cry
---
The ST class quests will highly likely be in Phase 1. Blizzard been very clear, unless specifically stated otherwise they’re using the 1.12 data and will not change it as they consider it sacrosanct. In terms of the posters question, it doesn’t really matter a huge deal not taking the trinket, you clearly think the staff is awesome, which let’s be honest it is. Just take it, be awesome and save your dkp for the MC SP trinket haha 👍
---
Well, that’s the beauty of publishing things now. We can find folks who are a good fit for us . . . and those who aren’t can look elsewhere without wasting their time. 
---
Nightelfs are the best dagger rogues due to highest agi. 
---
Humans are the best sword rogues.
---
Human/NE rogue duels is in favor to human because of racial, but that's of no concern for you in battlegrounds against other rogues. There you will have a constant benefit/guaranteed opener against other rogues, compared to 3min cooldown humans.
---
Gnome/Dwarf each bring other useful racials for battlegrounds though, where gnome is the least useful against other rogues and dwarf can gain immunity to other rogues poisons(blind) if you don't get them 100-0 in one go, which definitely helps.
---
So if you ignore duels with humans, NE rogue is the best and most consistent option against alliance and horde rogues to guarantee an opener.
---
I'm glad to see they're getting push back on this at home as well as here. As someone else said, I'd be voicing my disappointment and advocating for a change of course on this on the Blizz forums if I had an active sub. Since I don't, I just hope the noise we make here gets back to 'em somehow.
---
There was a toggle: xp bar, xp bar hidden, or reputation as xp bar. My memory is a bit fuzzy, though. I think at one point there may have been an xp bar AND a reputation bar option, too.
---
This is stupid on so many levels....  
---
2+2=5 again  
---
ganking ally questers gets me hard
---
we're toying with the idea of "reserve + roll" for everything up until BWL comes out, then we'll re-evaluate.
---
The key difference between loot systems for Vanilla and Classic is that Classic players now know that most of their bis for phase 1 will be dungeon drops. 
---
No one is going to want to spend DKP for loot downgrades.
---
I had a little over +1000 healing at the time
---
I want "VR" in the sense that you are looking into the world, not experiencing it in first person. If you have ever experienced 3DS style 3D, thats the kind of stuff I want to exist. There may be some 3D features associated with graphics cards that i'm unaware of that would achieve that same effect, but that's what I wish was standard.
---
So is harassment on any given server though. If that one unique feature to RP servers was effective I don't think the RP community would have disruption/trolling problems at such a high level for over a decade. If you go to the wow forums and look at the roleplay threads you'll find countless complaints dating all the way back.
---
And even if they aren't questing, there's a good chance they are on their way to Shadowfang Keep or Scarlet Monastery.
---
Spirit tap is bad for PVP. Just get used to drinking when you get out of combat, or just trying to die when you are OOM so you can Rez with full mana. 
---
Profession wise, tailoring is good, you can craft some decent stuff. For making money however, you should do herbalism. Herbs are always in demand, especially as guilds use more consumed for higher content. Skinning is okay for leveling, but you should drop it for herb once you are level 60 
---
Not sure a Dress can qualify as the best looking plate. Them shoulda pads is dope though.
---
Well, you should just go to Darkshore if you dont' want any trouble
---
Isn't that the main motive behind the majority of RP guilds? World pvp!!?!?
---
Ian is really out to lunch.
---
RP-PvP Beta males are truly pathetic. Us chads will be on the PvP.
---
I’m sure there will something, i will look for something to let me separate the tanks for the raids at least. 
---
Knod knod
---
The downside is, you have to be a dwarf (and Alliance).
---
I think he is grossly overestimating the trolls willingness to put out effort to destroy your server.
---
OP, you and I are so similar, you're kinda freaking me out. Same life situation, same class choices, etc. 
---
I think at this point I'm thinking heal instances with Priest [PI spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsMiqobxtMbb) (that can also farm lashers in DME and do some decent smite spamming). 
---
My alt will be a Druid which I hope to PVP, tank, and perhaps heal, with [Heart of the Wild spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxGxsc0dxVxsofo).
---
&gt; Well, all hardcore, successful guilds use loot council. So I suppose what you "say" doesn't really matter.
---
again, perhaps in the current game where loot is meaningless - I genuinely don't know. And perhaps the top 10 guilds in the world, where ranking is all that matters. But for most hardcore guilds, in vanilla? Wrong.
---
I raided in guilds that were ranked 100-250th in the world throughout vanilla, TBC and wrath. I was in 4 guilds total in that time I believe, and none of them used anything besides DKP, nor did any of our rivals. Occasionally loot council would be mooted as an option and a riot would occur. 
---
Seriously, I didn't roll a Human Paladin on Twisting Nether because I liked Alliance, I did it because Blizzard announced that Horde would finally get Paladin in TBC.  I had enough time to level that Paladin and get him into AQ before TBC was released.
---
Elwynn-&gt;Loch Modan first? What? I don't know of anyone who does that. 
---
Well my hope for an Oceanic rp-pvp is certainly dead dead dead...
---
For me it's because the alliance races are really boring (human, small human, even smaller human, tall blue human) so I prefer the beast races. Also the majority of Alliance players go Human, playing Human in a game where you can be a variety of races... boring
---
?
---
Now this is a post. I’m at work and will just say I’m a lawyer so I don’t need fancy graphics or crazy stuff just something that’s good on the eyes and good for both work and play. I’m really hesitant to go beyond 22 although it seems like 24 is optimal so I’m definitely not doing 27 haha.
---
No. I am talking about Vanilla. On Private Servers. All successful guilds use loot council. It will be the same in Classic.  It's just so anti progression to have DKP systems.
---
It was here, i can't say if it has been shared other places ofc, but i remember taking this exact pool on this subreddite (it was a long one with more then just this, might have been 3-5 months ago or so)
---
Balance kek
---
Those were only the Hard-Packed Snowballs that you could find in Alterac Valley. Regular snowballs don't cause a knockdown.
---
Oh lol I figured I must have missed something. Sounds like they are doing it backwards to me. Oh well the game I care about is coming out first at least. Thanks I'm deleting my silly post now : )
---
I cant even imagine 2 druids dueling. It would either last for hours or one would run off because he'd realize it's not worth the time.
---
 He likely would have his reasons. Don't let them kill you over and over and change your plan, or bring muscle. 
---
 I don't think RP-PVP is a good idea if you don't want to get in weird fights all the time. You are no less likely to be corpse camped than on regular PVP realms, maybe more so because people have in-character reasons to want you to stay dead. They'll probably have some kind of battlecry even. 
---
Warrior t3 &gt; any other plate tier set
---
Honestly this massively depends on how hardcore / casual your guild is. For a casual guild, being knowledgable and communicative, and in general having a "leadership" mentality is very helpful, more helpful than min-maxes or bis this or that. Especially for pre AQ40/Naxx content. Because your guild is not trying to be the best, but rather is just trying to get through the content on a reasonable schedule, I don't forsee people caring if you have the optimal profession or race etc. It is a tank with the right attitude that will get his guild through MC/BWL -- this combined with you having first priority on raid gear that's relevant + staying on top of your pre-raid bis gear and enchants is going to make you a great MT for a casual guild. A great MT for a casual / midcore guild is someone who knows how to marshall people to do the right thing - ie, make sure you're fully buffed up, make sure that people understand how aggro works, make sure to communicate out if you're less geared than ideal and will need more heals / more sunders before DPS goes balls in. People won't know to do this, or they'll know but be too lazy, so I think the best MT is one who is communicative and instructive. 
---
Basically, the raid is limited by you and defined by you. Can MT from superguild chain pull the raid and ensure healers need less downtime because he takes less damage in his optimized gear? Yeah, sure, great for him. But if you're in blues, you can't do that, and like it or not, the DPS and healing are going to need to match your level of tanking. It's up to them to adjust to you, because you  don't have the self-reliance and mitigation and self-healing of future expansions, which makes it more important that people understand what you can do, what your capabilities are and aren't, and how they need to adjust to suit you. 
---
dang/10 shitpost
---
The Horde can hardly be blamed for how Alliance blood smells...
---
It was patched in/around 1.10.
---
First of all, you're simply incorrect, at least as far as Nostalrius went. EPGP was by far the most common system for long-term guilds. 
---
But it's also worth bearing in mind that private server raids are heavily nerfed and tend to get cleared very quickly. With accurate damage/mitigation calculations on live, and progressive itemisation, that won't be the case, and the scarcity value of loot will be far greater. So even the casual guilds who didn't care so much about their pserver toons will be more incentivised to use DKP.
---
“Oh boy check out this awesome armor I wear” - guy in the back with 1h/colorful shield
---
This is 2019 not 2004.
---
Perception is a huge bonus, something like +50 or +80, the human will see right through your shadowmeld and MoD talents.
---
Beyond that - none of the NE racials give a rogue benefits in PvE (Like Human / Gnome weapon skill) which would translate into possibly better gear from raids or an in combat CD like Gnome / Dwarf - and in PvP, particularly Rogue PvP - CD's are the name of the game.
---
If you are curious, this pic shows how effective 5/5 MoD is - https://image.ibb.co/kvCi8v/Mo-D-distance.png 
---
So a +5 from NE should represent about 1/3 of that line, which is negligible.
---
Go resto and heal me
---
LOL
---
RP-PVP is what I played in retail Vanilla and would be my preferred realm choice in Classic. I hope they reconsider.
---
Vote with your wallet and don’t pay them if you feel that strongly about it. Ah that’s right it’s not even available yet. 
---
Like I said, retail is a different beast. Loot is pointless and reset every few months, nobody would want to spend DKP on non-titanforged items anyway. I'm not sure how current year applies to vanilla.
---
For 700$ you could build a great pc that will run 60 fps no prob, are you trying to be mobile with it?
---
Damn I was planning to roll on an RP-PvP. Rip
---
If you play balance in PVP, you don't go with oomkin. You just go with a balance spec that grab's nature's swiftness.  
---
The druid specs all play pretty much the same in PVP. Feral? You use everything in your kit but feral a little more than others. Balance? You use everything in your kit but balance a little more than others. Resto? You use everything in your kit evenly.  
---
Well, its branding. Coke makes great drinks. But they still do branding and advertising
---
This was the case, but zerging always outpaced the honor/rep gain of a slower game. It was mostly about capping the enemy flag while leaving your own undefended and hoping for the best. 
---
You can pickpocket the mobs in the mines during AV games for quick cash. Their pockets respawn, and the lockboxes have a chance at having a star ruby.
---
Also if you train your lockpicking, people will accept you to dungeons because they don't want to do the 15 hour quest chain for the key.
---
I got you lol. To be honest I've never RP'd but I get it. From having played classic. I am so invested in my identity as a horde player. I actually get physically distressed when I play Allie. Which I only ever wasted money on one time in TBC I think it was. I know it was soon after then intro'd faction changes I moved my Orc warrior to being a human warrior.
---
Well I did my normal ritual. Took 4 shots of whiskey then logged in to pvp. Got into the bg and super excitedly as I always do. Screamed something along the lines of Kill all the women and R**** all the men. Suffer not a knife ear to live. Was met with deafening silence. This was my first hint I was in the wrong place. 
---
However I tryed to recover. When the BG started I hopped on my mount and started battle calling as I charge into 10 horde... Die instantly, get confused and look in chat. Turns out we have 7 people on defense and they want 1 more. They want 8 people on defense... My puny horde mind shattered. I logged and never played that toon again. 50$ wasted.
---
Yeah I kinda have to be mobile with it as I'll be using it for part time school too and i honestly have no idea how I would build a desktop computer, it sounds cool though 
---
Ragnaros tried to cleanse it with fire... It *backfired*.
---
I've always loved the layout this town, but I also really wish there were even more layers and pathways, it always felt a bit too small for how cool it was.
---
Paladins lost their auras AND their blessings.
---
Are there any other scythes in classic? Because is looks cool as hell
---
I don’t know but druids need a real Rez. 
---
It's not hard at all - boring, and a little slow but not hard, even sub 40 before you get a button to press.
---
If you like conspiracy theories: Warriors complain how hard it is to level them, so they can remain a protected class and treated like queens. (Also see: Tanking)
---
Could you lay down the talents for that build
---
Tldr: you suck at a hunter and/or this is a troll post
---
He's the robot who passes butter. Rebuffs blessings every 5 minutes. 
---
Here's a suggestion... maybe consider another entry along with "Off-Spec" and "Main-Spec" called "Best-in-Slot"
---
For example, there might be an item that is a decent main-spec upgrade for mage that is best-in-slot for a spriest. In those cases, you'd (and the mage) would probably want to know this.
---
It's nice to hear a guild laughing when they die! I'm so accustomed to people getting angry and shouting at each other about whose fault it was.
---
Dude is a tool. Balance pvp is more gear reliant than many other class specs, but 28/11/11 is what I plan to go for wpvp 
---
Nothing is more satisfying than throwing someone [off a cliff into lava](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLSKBZHPqKw)
---
There is no evidence that raids are under tuned on private servers. There is actually some evidence that bosses have too much armor on private servers. 
---
With 1.12 items, everyone's prebis is alot stronger except maybe tanks bc of def nerf. I have not seen a single convincing argument for this whole private servers are too easy nonsense. 
---
Regardless, the good guilds will clear these raids the week they release anyways. There will be no loot starvation as you describe. 
---
The issue is making a viable pvp battleground instead of just a race for marks.
---
As a Druid IRL I wouldn't attack anyone unprovoked, and regardless of faction I would step in to help those in need. Druid isn't just a class, it's a lifestyle. You could really say the same about all of the classes in Vanilla. But for Druids, harmony and balance are the tenets to embody -- take not prospective Druids.
---
no changes Slippery slope is real, it starts with RP-PVP and then it leads to pandas.
---
Paladins wouldn't need to tank... if they just didn't nerf Reckoning.
---
They get tank gear tho? After the MT has gotten it ofc.
---
Right, that's why I'm advocating for a tweak in the reputation gains in such a way that zerging does not outpace longer games. 
---
You don't fight other druids because you will be fighting the same battle until it's time to logoff for the night.
---
People nowadays are aware that DKP is a shit system for a progression guild in Vanilla.
---
You mean they'll just a be a bunch of naked night elves dancing on the Ironforge mailbox with naughty names?
---
Nice 50 talent point build over there champion
---
The upside is; you have brass balls.
---
I keep 1 talent in the back pocket for chumps like you to reee
---
The strat I remember in razorgore was killing all the mages while tanking the melees until the mages stopped spawning. 
---
"Without further ado". I love his content. He is a content creator, not like most of hype surfers.
---
I'm planning on making a heap of meals before classic hits, so I don't have to live totally on junk.
---
The Dr Pepper will still be flowing strong, but might try and break it up with some low cal drinks too.
---
I'm considering the possibility of a quick walk each day, but everything will depend on how much classic sucks me in.
---
I'd recommend getting ahold of a decent sized monitor if you don't have one already. Can get a solid new one for less than $130 or a decent used one for less. A Laptop shouldn't have any issues displaying on a bigger monitor and then you get the benefit of portability with a laptop plus the benefit of a bigger screen from a desktop. There really isn't any magic to it either, just need an HDMI cable and it's plug-in, good to go. Which of course is only relevant when you're playing at home, but I would imagine that would be a majority of the time spent playing?
---
Don't have to, obviously. Just what I do and it's pretty dang nice.
---
&gt; There is no evidence that raids are under tuned on private servers. There is actually some evidence that bosses have too much armor on private servers.
---
Absolutely wrong - all server-side damage and mitigations calculations are based on improvised code, as the Blizzard codebase was never leaked. And invariably, this has made bosses more squishy and their abilities a lot less lethal.
---
&gt; With 1.12 items, everyone's prebis is alot stronger except maybe tanks bc of def nerf. I have not seen a single convincing argument for this whole private servers are too easy nonsense.
---
Visit the MaNGOS forums and look for NPC discussion threads.
---
It was that goddamn centaur in The Barrens with the slowest respawn ever? Gives me a chill.
---
Yeah to be honest the 1.12 AV is still slower and has more space for PvP than current AV. It's going to be more similar to retail AV, but it won't be the same. 
---
Well, when there are piles of corpses blocking the AH, we know who to blame. :V
---
It's 29/11/11. He perhaps got a point wrong. The real point is it took this many replies to get the real answer. Stop being useless people.
---
In no world do you get unemployment for quitting your job.
---
Well said buddy. May the earthmother, and Elune, smile upon you. 
---
That won't happen. Players will always take the path of least resistence, even if that path is bad game design.
---
Because usually you can kind of tell if someone is likely to leave and then not give them amazing loot.
---
On a 5 min cd versus 1 Mon 
---
What if they're off on the release date and push it back?  Who's going to be on the forums screaming about it?
---
Most likely you.
---
I don't think AV would be ever barren if they went with the long battles. Even if you got zero rewards, it's still incredibly fun. You can't say the same about the short zerg to the end version. I mean sure, it's super convenient, but it's not very fun nor engaging to skip 90% of the content in the battleground.
---
Holy shit man you don't have to tear the world down with you.
---
I'm not a roleplayer but I'm also not a ganker/griefer and don't want to waste my time being ganked and griefed. However all my rl friends want to roll PvP servers and I figured the griefing would be less toxic on an RP-PvP server. Looks like it's going to be bobbing and weaving through toxic sludge all my way up to 60. 
---
So the damage calculation is somewhat unknown. That sounds like it could be under calculated or over calculated. Show evidence that these bosses are squishier or do less damage. 
---
\&gt;  you all make it to level 20 in the first night. 
---
That is pretty god damn hardcore right there.
---
Bingo. The 1.12 version just appeals to raiders who have no intention of playing in AV long term. They just want their purples as fast as possible with as little effort required.
---
If you get Improved VW it will hold aggro no problem
---
That should work out just fine.
---
Most RP happens in goldshire anyway, so it doesn’t make much of a difference.  Just make sure to bring your robe and wizard hat.
---
Do you know how to have a conversation without being contrarian? Your post history suggests otherwise.
---
&gt; how populated are this types of servers.
---
Roughly 17 people.
---
Oh how I will miss my 2000 HK AVs from original WoW, but in all fairness I don’t have 7 hours to play a single battleground anymore. It was fun as hell , I didn’t even care about the waste of time that was AV. It was like hillsbrad / south shore with quicker respawns and more people. 
---
Once you've got all those fancy rewards, what fun is there left? At least with the old-school AV, the battle is fun regardless of the rewards, it's not going to die.
---
1.12 AV is the best version imo. Why do you think a bunch of NPCs in the middle of the map will make it more fun?
---
&gt; It was a developer that said it in Countdown to Classic. 
---
Which one? And who was it?
---
In classic WoW, the AV exalted rewards were super-dy-duper good for freshly minted lvl 60s. Not to mention the general pvp blues were pretty damn decent. 
---
This means that some odd 70-80% of players are going to be in AV to just get the damn thing done. Which means zerg. 
---
Part of game design is understanding that you can't just say "well if you dickholes played the game like X instead of Y, you'd get your experience you really want." Doesn't matter -- players are going to chase the carrots on a stick, and in vanilla, AV exalted + pvp gear was a big grind for a big carrot. 
---
Which means the only way we will get the epic 5hr battles is if doing so is the optimal strategy. In 1.7, for example, the optimal strategy to maximize your honor and rep was to just buttblast each other in the middle of the map while a small group of sneaky people did sneaky stuff. So, you got the epic long AV battles. You didn't get it because players WANTED that gameplay, you got it because it was the de facto way to chase the carrot on the stick. 
---
People are for sure going to zerg it. People have changed; the mentality is different now. You can barely get a friendly res out of a healer during a dungeon, you can barely get people to wait for you to drink, people are trained and conditioned to zerg and efficiently try to just get it over with. 
---
There's no point saying "Well if everyone (insert thing that only 20% of players will ever do)" -- people will always try to get shit done as quickly as possible. Yes, there will be people who still run into the middle and buttblast each other for hours on end. But the map will not be played like 1.7, the map will be played like 1.12, because that's what it is, and the motivations for gear and rep are still going to drive players to end it using the default optimal strategy. 
---
Let’s make nochange changes!!
---
[haha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAKOs1Zm5Fo&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Yeah that sounds perfect actually. Will definitely look into a good monitor as well, thanks. 
---
Seems like the first reasonable answer I've seen but apparently people are upset. 
---
I guess RP and redditors are two feathers of the same bird. Most likely there won't be a counter-meme tomorrow white knightnighting Blizzard on this one like there was AV, lol
---
Typical RP stuff + some world PvP events from my experience, I didn't see a point in it. But I only played a day or two at max level before I got bored to be fair.
---
Not to mention, that sort of fun is very artificial, and really annoys everyone else who is expecting a rushed match and quick rewards. It's akin to ignoring LFG and manually grouping up in retail. Like sure, you can do it, but most players aren't when there's an easy method available.
---
I am having a conversation. I'm calling you out for being wrong. My post history has nothing to do with this. There are plenty of instances where I'm very agreeable and certainly plenty of instances where I'm not. You clearly only see what you want to see (like certain posts in my history) and then judge others based on a flawed standard. To summarize, you should probably just move on. I know I will.
---
Awesome just worried about ram a little but 8gb should be plenty right? 
---
That makes sense. I hope a blue sees this and hopefully we get a more agreeable answer.
---
Nothing beats the human CD.  You might beat the  warlock pet felhunter’s paranoia, but not human CD.
---
It’s kind of sad though. Paladin sets peak at tier 2. T2.5 isn’t bad, t3 is just bland. 
---
Best wow meme I've seen. That face at the end. I am cracking up as I type this LOL
---
In blizzard's defense, they DID say that if they saw enough demand they'd do it. For what it's worth blizzard has actually been pretty good about listening to feedback regarding Classic. So it's not as though it's a definite "No.", just a "We haven't reserved space for it."
---
What this tells me is that people who want an RP-PVP server just need to be very vocal about it over the next couple months. I think that if players make their voices heard on this, we'll definitely see RP-PVP servers. I think the biggest concern is that they may not be in time for launch / "phase one".
---
I think following shit streamers onto realms for the chance to be noticed by somebody for once in your life is pretty beta. 
---
For me as a horde player. I hate the 1.12 version. It's a steaming pile of shit to me. It has no real stratagem people will execute. There is literally nothing to do but charge forward and just try to cap a few towers as we wait to lose. Then when the shit week end is over and we have exulted we never come back.
---
Imagine if some one said hey man lets play foot ball it's a fun game. Only I get to wear pads and cleets and you have to play naked. Also the prize for playing is 10000$ win or lose! I mean as the naked guy you will play for that money but, shit if that game is crap from your perspective. 
---
Two can play that game  sir,
---
Shamans wouldn't need to be only healers if they didn't Nerf WF chaining and AP
---
But it is what it is.
---
59 twink :P
---
It's basically the same as a PVP server. The big difference you'll see it that people can have their names reported for not being RP. Sometimes you'll see a small group of players clustered in a group. Maybe they'll be emoting, but usually, they keep it to party chat so people don't bother them.
---
I only joined an RP guild once. I don't personally RP, but a friend was in it. They didn't RP in raids or PVP, but they did RP outside of it. So if someone was getting promoted in the guild to a high rank they'd hold a ceremony and make a big ordeal out of it. If you play on an RP-PVP server you probably won't notice them unless you're looking for them. Most of the RP players I met didn't mind grouping with non-RP players because they had specific characters that they would RP with.
---
It's just easy access from Burning Steppes fp. Horde killing time waiting for their Blackrock instance/raid groups can drop down real fast and ruin people's day, to pass the time, and be back in time for raid.
---
Lol right?
---
Make a character who's persona is a dick. Stay in character.
---
I dont think they can anything about that unless you are griefing somebody, or spamming allies to try to distract from their event.
---
Is there anywhere I can see your build
---
You are the most hostile person I have encountered on reddit.

I'm anxious for a release date too, but Blizzard is under no obligation to provide you with something for the sake of your own personal convenience. You just sound like a child now. Downvote me away!
---
You don't need an active sub to post...

Many people here are saying it is cheap enough to just buy mats from the AH to skill up engineering. Also that mining takes too long and that mining and herb is tedious, or that mining isn't worth it if your just going to drop it anyway.
---
So I propose that herb + a different profession that you drop for engineering makes sense. Herb + skinning, or herb + enchanting for DE, then switch to engineering and just buy the mats.
---
IMO t3 shaman is the best looking set ever.
---
While ironic, it is a change I believe that is necessary to keep the nature of Classic WoW AV unchanged. 
---
Defense in AV was a miserable experience. Nostalgia hard about the fifty year long AVs all you want, they were only fun if the fighting was not happening in your half of the map.
---
Seems legit.
---
Its enough, not plenty but good enough to get the job done.
---
I never got why people need de cursive. When I arena'd in TBC I almost got kicked off my team for it. We got up to about 2347 and when the priest found out I didn't have decursive he shit a brick and asked how I know to dispel shit. I am just sitting their like your whole fucking character panel turns an ugly color when you have a debuff. How the fuck do you need a mod to help with that?
---
I guess what I am asking is what does de cursive actually do? Why do people think you need it?
---
Basically 2h with hit and sp or trinket that summons a pet without soul shard. All guides say go trinkets as the weapon will be replaced but if available at launch it can serve as a very good pre bis because warlocks need hit. Apparently not available at launch but thats what is the topic of discussion 
---
You'll be able to do LBRS and UBRS. You'll also be able to entry level into Molten Core and Onyxia.
---
After a few runs in Molten Core, you can probably start going to BWL but I remember being stuck on the first few bosses for awhile until the guild had MC and Onyxia on farm status.

---
This is what I’ll end up doing. Thanks!
---
Whirlwind weapon damage and WF/HoJ procs from abilities benefit slow MH more. 
---
Get the rank 10 pvp gear
---
It's just a RP server but with the added benefit of being able to experience the full game in all it's glory. 
---
Here's a link to a video that is extremely informative in regards to choosing a laptop. This is 2 months old so it probably still applies. I hope this helps you!

---
is a pretty good start
---
How does a HOJ proc benefit more, if HoJ is a static value, 2% then you'd in theory get twice as many with the mainhand, providing it's exactly half the speed.  
---
Also I'm alliance, so I'm discounting windfury (i should have mentioned that)
---
I love seeing Simsativa's stuff. She did an amazing build of Dalaran too. 
---
Dis.
---
It doesnt consume a shard but consumes a slot in your begs when not used. Might aswell just have a soulshards there.
---
The trinkets has no use unless you run out of shards and its gone take you longer to sum a void and have the void disapear for a shard rather than just kill a mob to get the shard.
---
He’s all funny bones.
---
Feet
---
Thanks hoss!
---
LBRS and UBRS wont be a problem. People run them all day long. Healers are alway welcome, and Druids may are in demand due to combat rez and innervate. If you have another rez (pally, sham, priest), druids will be awesome in LBRS, UBRS and any dungeon.
---
You'll be able to hold your own in the beginning in PVP, but once people get MC, Onyxia, and BWL on farm you'll be out geared in pvp pretty crazy.
---
You might want to go for PVP sets, which IIRC are kind of like a Tier 1.5.
---
Tier 1 in MC
---
Tier 2 BWL
---
Tier 3 was later then I played
---
I don't think it's that nelfs are bad just that people value the other racials more. You'll get opener 9/10 times as a nelf rogue with 5/5 master of deception against horde druid/rogues. If you like night elf rogue you should go for it man. You play this something like this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxboxZhZxMeozGRqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxboxZhZxMeozGRqo) with the engi stealth detection googles and there is no way a horde rogue sees you first, like ever.
---
Man, pubs were such a shit show.
---
&gt;Troll is the superior priest race - Change my mind
---
Its true, so no.
---
If anyone who was planning on rolling on an RP-PVP server would like to call into Countdown To Classic to express their feelings about this news and get some word out then let me know, cheers.
---
Ohhh, yeah wow. That does knda suck. 
---
No deal, going horde.
---
Taz'dingo!
---
Earlier versions of AV are still Alliance favoured, not just 1.12
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla and we still lost sometimes
---
Few weeks ago it was AV weekend on a pserver that I play on and horde won 2 games back to back. I defended ice blood GY and the Alliance ended up turtling in stormpike, After about 20 minutes of slowly pushing over the bridge and taking the bunkers we were able to take the GY and kill Vann
---
I would suggest this laptop over the one you chose, it is the same price, has a better GPU, and double the SSD size and a few more features.
