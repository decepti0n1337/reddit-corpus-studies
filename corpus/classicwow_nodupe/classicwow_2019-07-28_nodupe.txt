I know right?  Some dude actually told me the other day, "Good luck finding a guild to take you as a night-elf holy priest".  What?
---
---
---
Or quit really early for the same reason.
---
Mindnumbing compared to retail WoW. While a lot of things in retail are much more simple and easy than vanilla, healing went the other way. The downranking requires a bit of effort to set up but not to actually play/use.
---
Sul has two green balls floating around it, this is warmonger but still beautiful nostalgia nonetheless
---
My biggest beef is when people say Saki instead of Sake....
---
Entertainment. 
---

---
I have 2 screens one for gaming and one for netflex/twitch/youtube.
---
i had wow sound mutet since tbc when i startet to play melee/tank specs, then i had to find some other sorce of sound. 
---
im not relly watching twitch for the games, more for the entertainment of the steamer
---
entrance
---
Yes. Very much so.
---
This is what I’ll be doing, though I may give up on leveling herbalism and just go back when I get a mount (or travel form since this is for my Druid). 
---
Even if you’re mailing it to an alt or banking it I’d recommend just waiting til you get a mount if you’re playing a class with bag space issues and don’t want to go crazy. Herbs, skinning, random greys and shit you need for your class (food, water, offspec shit if you’re gonna do a dungeon soon and want to heal/tank) take up a loooot of space, and the last thing you want to do in the middle of a questing spree is haul your slow ass back to the town 5-10 minutes away. Try to save your relevant level cloth and make friends with a tailor if possible for extra bag space, or use that skinning gold to buy some bags off the AH. 
---
There are a lot of inventory management addons floating around that can help with keeping your herbs away from the shit that needs to be vendored. I don’t know any off the top of my head but they’re not hard to find, I’m not sure if any are classic ready already though. 
---
Good luck!
---
So it isn’t as a big deal as people make it out to be. It is a contributing factor to why ally warlocks are more rare than horde. But in general warlocks are a rare to see class compared to mages.
---
And it’s kinda hard to say warlocks beat casters or whatever because of their build diversity. It is more accurate to say Sl/Sl beats melee instead of saying warlocks beat melee.
---
If you have grenades and if they pop wotf just chuck a made at them and then re fear them once it runs out.
---
Really good players will pre use Wotf to prevent fear from death coil. Like rogues will use it before a stun lock falls off if they know it won’t kill you so the kill is guaranteed. But imo your dead anyways if that happens regardless of WOTF.
---
Even then if your skilled and have a build for the context, warlocks can beat any class 1v1 assuming BIS gear on both sides and optional play. But the stars have to align in terms of your strategy.
---
Casters really don’t become broken op early game. Melle is the meta in early game because the gear they do get it 200x better than yours. Not until u get naxx gear you will struggle with better geared players.
---
But if you get T3 and ur good. You will be unstoppable.

Tauren are why I started playing WoW. I liked the cute cow people.

Vanillaguide is nice as long as you keep in mind it has xp reward values set a bit high so it will outpace you. The addon itself is really solid but knowing that you may need to jump to a zone not on the addon to keep up.
---
I use a dual monitor setup as well.  I don't really need background noise.  As I like to hear in game sounds and music.  I do have a decent amount of friends that play with all game sound off though.  Don't know how you folks do it.
---
I was this way too, but a couple of my friends talked it up and I got caught in the memories and feels bad enough that now I'm waiting for release right alongside them.

I’d go mining-engi then drop mining for tailoring for bloodvine.

Im like 95% sure im gonna go priest, but I have the feeling that when im in the loggin screen the shaman in me will call

Eh, tryin to price it together on mobile is harder than it seems
---
You can tank dungeons just fine as a DPS spec. Just throw on a lil extra threat gear.
---
It is though. Given that your rotation is spamming one button ur dps increase includes 
---
1)+ spellpower
---
2)crit, the more u crit the more dps u will do compares to someone who isn’t critic as much.
---
3) spell hit
---
4) spell rank.
---
Ze I believe is the new gender pronoun people are using.
---
How do you know at the beginning?
---
Warrior is a real chore to level. But you can rather easily tank all the 5mans until level 60 with a dps spec and a sword and board. You don’t need to level as prot to tank dungeons.
---
&gt;I’ve done like 15 corpse runs so far and I’m only level 7. 
---
You really shouldn't be dying that often, especially that early.  
---
&gt;you won’t be able to do the hamstring kiting in classic either. 
---
Yes you will be able to.
---
I kinda want to level as prot so maybe I’ll have to do less corpse runs.
---
Might have more issues than the class if you really died that many times by 7 lol. Paladin isn’t all that fun to lvl either, although I guess you’d definitely die less.
---
Lost touch with everyone from back in the day over the years, making a new group with some current friends and coworkers who used to play or always wanted to play.  I'm sure some will drop out before 60 but we almost got 40 people.
---
Don’t they take turns on the ignite to control aggro? I didn’t play vanilla so I may be wrong.
---
Ehh on fights like loatheb you HAVE to, or you'll die.
---
On other fights, you're gonna have to snipe my ignite if u want it ;)
---
I measure success by not wasting mine, and 39 other peoples time.  Wiping to simple bosses and spending over 2 hours in MC is a waste of time, simple as that.
---
I too have had plenty of fun wiping all night on bosses we were learning, but I also remember getting extremely angry at certain people when they would consistently make the same mistakes on simple mechanics on farm status fights and cost the raid a wipe/wasted time.  Its less about whether or not bosses die or not, and more about not wasting time on stupid shit we have on farm.
---
You can't stop XP gains, but battlegrounds don't give XP so it's all good.

Maybe he just doesn't want to play with you? (secretly making a character) considering the way you talk about him... doesn't think like you respect him that much xD

For the second time in my 7 years of browsing reddit, I decided to look at that guys post history. In the first 6 comments half of them are talking about Opioid's. I believe the mystery has been solved.

I'm planning on running a pretty standard dw fury spec that should be just fine for dungeon tanking and offtank in a few raids, but won't compromise raid dps. Don't think fury prot is really ideal for dungeons since you'll miss out on tactical mastery, but I'll probably try it out at some point. Gonna be flexible this time around! Definitely excited about seeing more ferals running around too.
---
GOOD WRITEUP DAWG I LIKE YOUR STYLE, THANKS FOR THE ADVICE. HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ENFORCED, IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET ENOUGH HONOR TO BE AHEAD OF MOSTLY EVERYONE BY THE TIME PHASE 2 RELEASES? I THINK I PLAN TO FARM OUT CHOKEPOINTS TO LESSEN THE BURDEN.
---
I tried the game for a month and didn't give it a chance. Never got to experience wow in its glory days. Now I get that chance back.
---
Oh I'm sorry, did i put a stock in your current ego trip? Turns out ppl with issues do the things they do for psychological reasons, which often is partly or even entirely out of their own control. You're not some superior person, you merely don't suffer from a mental illness, and judging by this reaction you haven't been affected by one in your life yet. I hope that continues m8, because it is a brutal life lesson to learn.
---
I don't know if you're planning on extending this beyond your circle, but I'd be interested in filling up some air time if you're open to it.
---
You must have a pre-2012 MacBook. Blizzard switched from OpenGL to Metal which isn’t supported on older Macs. You could probably get a few hundred dollars for your old computer and upgrade to a newer Mac instead of running two machines

I mean I like just sex but having an extended relationship just tying me down to one person isn't a thing I have ever been interested in. Everytime I was "dating" someone exclusively I always felt regret pretty much the second it was established and locked down and always break it off as quick as I can. So I make it clear I only want a casual relationship to avoid hurting the other person. Arguably I haven't met the "right" person yet, but I'm not gunna go out my way to find said person.
---
Tell us your tale!
---
Yeah I wish I had the schedule and friends to do a melee cleave group. I bet a lot of warriors will choose this over questing
---
I don't see how that would be the case  You get to play classic along with retail for the same fee. It could help both games to advertise with that info. 
---
I don't see why advertising classic has any bearing on the state of retail.
---
Not in Vanilla, and won’t be in Classic
---
Beastmastery for leveling. Just standard 31/20/0. Don't need to rush respeccing to Markmanship same day you hit 60, get some gear from dungeons first and join a guild who will let you raid with them before you go 0/31/20. Good luck!
---
31/5/15 or 0/31/20?
---
Haha, I like it. Good thinking about prepping for possible BC alt
---
That's the plan. I hope the mac has value, it's the last year they made the huge screens. I found something that should play classic on high for under 500 already.
---
Dead? It's the exact same as it was in vanilla lol
---
Large scale PvP pro strat: BoP a mage, they blink in, Frost nova, and ice block. Many horde will be stuck in place, easy pickings for your other ranged DPS.
---
You won't be able to earn honor at all until phase 2 begins, so there's no way to "save up" or anything like that. From the first week that the honor system goes online, rankers will be hitting the top standings because they know what it takes. You just have to be among them and put in the same hours. There isn't really any way to game the system.
---
However, in the beginning it isn't totally crucial to be in the very top. There's a maximum possible rank progress per week, and in week 1 the top dawgs will be able to just exactly hit rank 4. You can earn half as much honor and hit 3½, which means there isn't nearly as much pressure to be in the top because the amount you lose by not being in the top is small. You could half-ass it completely and still hit R3.
---
Second week the hardcores will be hitting R6 and the moderately invested will hit R5. After that, it starts to take a lot to make meaningful progress due to the weekly decay. Once you hit about 7-8, you no longer gain a full rank per week and it becomes much more important to maximize weekly gains.
---
Hey already said he enjoys pissing against the wind. Sounds like a vanilla vet to me.
---
If you die during a boss fight you are unable to release until the group wipes or downs the boss, but yea releasing sends you right to the start of the dungeon, inside of it. It was a super jarring change at first, but now it just feels normal. I've always been okay with the change, I hated waiting for people to run back and hearing "where do I go" and then realizing that I suck at explaining directions. But at the same time, i'll be so happy to see it gone and back to the more punishing deaths. Basically it does NOT belong in the modern game due to how people play it and due to how LFG works, but it is necessary in Classic.
---
Just imagine the healer dieing in Blackrock Depths, you have no one that can rez, and the healer asking "how do I get back" then you open your map and see they've ran out of the mountain and are just wandering aimlessly because they have never been to the area before, due to the Dungeon Finder.

We've got loads of news that can be found over at [www.warcraftradio.com](https://www.warcraftradio.com) with some of the archives we'll have. Not only that, but make sure to follow the twitter and Discord for more news as it comes out!
---
around 42-50 as horde I do the Hinterlands,Tarnaris, Feralas split.
---
All three zones have tons of quests that all link to each other.
---
Prior to that, STV and Swamp of Sorrows are a good way to get from ~34-42.
---
No idea what the alliance to tbh.
---
Oops. Missed the part as dps.
---
The T in Tsunami isnt silent tho
---
Grind for rare drops
---
Actually think I only want one class to 60 and to twink the other ones. Gear gap isn't as bad in non 60 battlegrounds.
---
At least crop out the giant retail ad.
---
PvE is literally all about sustaining high dps. Burst isn't really part of the equation because it just doesn't make an impact at all unlike solo, group or pvp.
---
Seal Fate does have more burst, but because its so dependent on being both crit and hit capped to compete with combat daggers, only really works in PvE raids when your gear is over the top insane (i.e. T2.5 - T3 quality raid gear).
---
It does offer more burst for holding their own in pvp and solo play, but it won't be nearly as good an option until much later into Classic's lifespan.
---
1.b3
---
I think they will try to "Cycle" Marketing so that people switch between retail and classic. So they release classic beta, and end it while 8.2 goes out. Then Classic goes out... And since 8.2 is still relatively new they are focusing on marketing that at the moment.
---
But then you have to play a gnome
---
I was 23, once.
---
Wotf doesnt remove or prevent death coil since it's a horrify effect, not a fear.
---
&gt; Generally I avoid any issues by just being in a guild with a similar mentality, simple as that.
---
See there ya go! You avoid the issue by playing with people with different expectations. That doesn't mean what he or his guild are doing is a waste of time, it just has different priorities.
---
If I spend all night with a bunch of drunk friends from college/HS laughing about people being idiots in MC and shooting the shit, I'm not wasting my time. I'm using the game to facilitate a different type of enjoyment than you. Neither person is wrong.
---
Playing rogue because of lockpicking
---
Just to open the boxes and loot a bis item for a guildie is the best
---
Porn
---
Thats still a thing today, gotta hug that wall!
---
39 twink warlock and maybe further down the road a 39 twink druid flag runner.
---
Yeah totally agree. They buffed feral and balance to the point where is was actually viable in the right teams while still keeping their class identity. I’m stoked for classic but if they ever to TBC I’m gonna be so pumped to play druid in that again.
---
You need a few hundred gold to do it and you need to ditch your other profession which might have valuable recipes or you still rely on. Not everyone will have leveled an alt to 60 by phase 4, some may even just have reached 60 by then. 
---
Spamming potions and runes is only really viable for the hardcore raiders who want to top the meters. For the vast majority of warlocks they don't want to spend time and gold for a small dps increase that only really has a big value on short fights. 
---
We've done a lot of theorycrafting since vanilla though and we understand how the stats work much better than 15 years ago. We no longer massively overvalue hit. Some people still claim that you should sacrifice almost anything to get as much +hit as possible, that is definitely not true. Depending on the rest of our gear and rotation we can assign a definite value to +hit. Zephan's testing showed the dps on T2,5 to range between 1418-1379 depending on the boss length while BV without taloring is 1405-1371 and bloodvine with tailoring is 1427-1392. So even at a two minutes boss fight which means very few lifetaps because he's actually using major mana potions, dark runes and mageblood potions, the difference between the two is a whopping 9 dps, or a 0.6% difference between wearing full T2,5 and using bloodvine with tailoring. Is that worth hogging one of your precious profession slots? 
---
[Here is a link to Zephan's comparison.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s2VsY5MmGncl5a2viN41_4Yt7vOptA6fQn-hllm6sEM/edit#gid=0)
---
Ah, my b.
---
Actually speaking of, will the Hinterlands quest hub be available in phase 1 for Classic?
---
That sounds needlessly complex and exhausting but if you enjoy it, I hope you find 39 others to get it done.
---
Its probably not what you want to hear but I simply love the zones in the 40-50 range.
---
Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands, Felwood, late STV is funish, and I like to start Ungoro at 49/50 so I'll toss it in there. I dunno if it's a different mentality but the quests just make this section such a breeze. 
---
25-39 is where i'm like you and get discouraged, mainly because I dislike the zones, no mount, and the quests.
---
Your face is the worst class in the game by far :(
---
Well obviously they wouldn't dare putting recruitment / sign up rewards in vanilla, but they might add it to retail. 
---
I hate to think of the amount of people not getting to play, because of Blizzard failing to advertise it to the masses.
---
Foot pedal to use as a modifier. Maybe my G13, I've always had mixed feelings about it.

Death coil is Horror effect; Wotf doesn't affect it and it's undispelable.

Hm, I've stuck just to  [https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/)  so far and never saw it on there.  That was the first I looked for.

---
Apologies for the late reply - on holiday.
---
Obviously counting ZG enchant on the respective pieces.
---
It's actually 1% (more like 0,8%) crit trade-off versus higher spellpower. 
---
No 3-piece BV set:

---

---
Mageblade
---

---
Above set is 10% hit and 8% crit.
---
Assume same set, swapping in 3 piece BV, AV offhand and ring of spell power. 10% hit and 9% crit and about 20 sp less if my quick maths is correct. In actuality it's about 0.8 crit more, due to higher int from the first set. No way I'd trade 0,8 crit for 20 or so spell power. 
---
Please, if you want - doublecheck the stats and get the exact spell power difference. Writing this on a phone and can't really fact check my maths without spending an hour on my iphone.
---
Have a good one!
---
Dm zg comes out way later. Zg is after bwl.
---
&gt; there's no reason for them to go back to 5 mans.
---
You severely underestimate people who just enjoy running dungeons.  Got a few people who have applied to my guild for Classic who have zero interest in PvP, and just want to run dungeons when they aren't raiding.  Same shit back in the day, never had an issue finding a tank in guild who was down for a 5 man.
---
Granted I rarely had to search outside of gchat for a party member, but still, those people are out there.
---
Is hinterlands a sure thing?
---
So mutigation is not hard in classic, the problem is threat. Good tanks will be threat monsters and know what threat pieces to use and sacrifice some mitigation. Tanking pre AQ is not hard. I think Skarm(not sure about the name) makes some decent tanking videos. Just remeber threat is king not how little damage you take. Also, if you want to main tank for a raid you will need near perfect attendence or be the guild leader, or know them. Most raids will take two offtanks.
---
I may be underestimating how much I actually played back then. I was a neet with nothing else to do.

Playing WoW is already a "waste of time" so wasting time within the game is a completely alien concept, I can't fathom why people want to be inefficient/ineffective with their hobbies.  Do people who like flying drones waste time flying them in bad windstorms?  Do people who like to ski go to the hill in the summer (that may be a bad example because I've definitely seen someone try that)?  Do amateur stargazers stare into their telescopes in the middle of the day trying to find a star that isn't even in their visible skyfield?
---
I get where you're coming from but it just blows my mind that people can have fun actively wasting time.  ...Just like I'm actively wasting time responding to these threads on reddit...

and then afterwards you can go ZF!!
---
You usually lube it up and ram through it
---
Yes considering I have alts to do professions for me.
---
yeah its confirmed in
---
Can this image possibly be any worse?

For my leveling rotation I always  cast PWS-Smite-SWP-Wand. Since Smite has a long cast time.
---
Yes I know this. I never said or intended to imply it.

For the one mage that got the ignite ticks.
---
FYI a *lot* of animations were fixed throughout the life of the beta. Trust in Blizzard, the QA team they have working on this really cares about authenticity.
---
yeah all the quest hubs are in for phase 1, including silithis
---
I loved my Druid in vanilla so much that now even all my D&amp;D characters are druids.
---
I'm doing both :) mage solo warrior duo with my friend the druid
---
&gt; never had an issue finding a tank in guild
---
Right, and that's one of the biggest perks of being in a good guild, people help each other.
---
Now try to find a tank outside of the guild, which is what majority of people does.
---
I usually finish before 40 humps. How is this related to classic wow?!

At those levels it hardly matters, spirits so low. Worth speeding up the bleh levels imo

I think they'll be able to do good business with classic and Live.
---
New patch, play Live, 2-3 months later, hop on Classic.  Eventually maybe we will see classic content, because lbh, why the hell not? especially if its down the road and everyone had their taste.  
---
8.2 was a big step up, pretty big grind, but it got a lot of players playing.  but im also someone who really only plays to Mythic Raid, the journey to that, I don't care too too much about
---
Sounds awful.  I'm also rolling a tank, so I don't plan on having a problem in the first place. :P

You spelled 'Patriots' wrong. It's like rooting for the house at a casino.

---
"Played"
---
Exactly.  Ask me to play any random race and class on Horde and sure.  I can't stand leveling as Alliance.
---
Kill yourself.
---
I know that sounds harsh, but you're going to want to get the quest outside in the central area of the mountain (the room before you climb down the chains) to get the key.  Go back inside to rez, turn left and kill the fire elemental and then go to the hallway with the dwarves - left again.  You should see the big nasty rock boss at the end - you're going to be killing him.  Afterwards, go back to the entrance and take the small hallway into the wide-open area with dwarves and dogs all wandering around.  Through the room slightly turning right to get to a stealthed NPC that will prompt you to kill the bitch in the back of the walled-in area behind him.  After you've killed her, go ahead and go into the hallway behind her and clear the arching area to the left which will lead you back into the wide-open area with the dogs and dwarves.  There will be another arching hallway immediately to your right - clear all of that to get the boss in a room in the back as well as the possiblity of a rare-ish boss that wanders here.  Just before you finish the arch spits you back out into the wide open area, there is a doorway leading into a circular arena area.  Doors will shut on you when you enter.  Finish the event, then leave through the other door (on the left wall as positioned from where you came in).  Go upstairs and hook a U-turn immediately at the top of the ramp to go into the area above the arena - straight through to the back hallway - take a right.  This dead ends into a boss that will have the finish of the key quest at the statue.  Turn around and go the other way at the fork and cross the bridge.  Take a left when you've entered the rooms and go down the ramp to a right that leads you to an open, circular area.  There's a (sometimes) miniboss in the right room of this area.  Go ahead and open up the vaults on the wall.  If you have enough keys from mob drops so far, do the event after you've opened them up.  Leave the room and to the right again, this will spit you into a cavern area that will be dwarves and rock elementals, leading down and to the left.  A boss roams this area and will lead into the bottom part of the circular area you were just in.  After the boss, keep going in the same direction and you'll be met with large double doors.  If they're closed (I can't remember what causes them to close, but it happens), just kill yourself and run back to the entrance to rez.  If it's open, go through and start killing dwarves to get back to the entrance - this is the area you first went through to kill the giant rock boss (Golemagg?  I don't remember his name).  Turn in quests and whatnot, but then head through the first gate as if you were going back to the rock boss, but take an immediate right through the door.  Here you can use your key to open up the door.  In this room, stick to the left of the ramp and clear to the back of the room where there is a large mechanism - looks like a huge gear attached to some sort of oil pump looking lever.  Now go back to the ramp in this room.  You might recognize the arena where you took a U-turn earlier - now head to the left and through the hallways.  You'll pass through a doorway that was opened when you hit the oil pump looking thing moments ago.  This hallway dumps you into a room with dwarves and fire elementals.  There is a downstairs area on the left that has a boss, then an area that has a bunch of gnomes and mechs on the right - there is a small room straight ahead with a boss and some mechs to accompany him.  Afterwards, take the right exit across a bridge with fire elementals into a bar.  You can go into the room on the left in the bar and smash up some kegs for a quest, then also talk to ribbly (is it ribbly?) for another quest.  If it's not ribbly, it's just a specifically named dude just outside the keg room with a couple of cronies.  Call him a jerk and kick his ass.  Then go to the upstairs area of the bar.  Buy the limited supply ale from the bartender and give them to the named dwarf nearby.  You'll give him 2 of these drinks 3 separate times and he'll start messing with the large kegs.  After he's messed with all of them, one of them will blow out the spigot and break open the door in the next area - which should activate the golem boss in the corner.  After killing the golem, go ahead and smash up the bartender - he's a boss, too.  Beware that all of the mobs in the bar will want to kill you after you down the boss.  Head out into the newly opened door and to the left.  There will be a boss in an open room with grates all over the floor on the right.  Take the left afterwards and there is a two level room with a bunch of golems.  There can be a rare boss in here.  Take the lower level on the left, wrapping back to the right and into what looks like a crypt area.  Walk through the room to the NPC on the upper level and tell him that he's a turd.  He'll start calling in dwarves around the room one-at-a-time, ninja style and then attack when you've killed the others.  Loot the big chest just before the newly opened door on the upper level.  In this next area there will be a hallway to the right with an instance door - this leads to molten core.  Don't go in the instance doorway, but you can collect the item needed for molten core attunement if you have that quest.  Then go back out and to the right through a door that opens into an area with a shit ton of dwarves.  These dwarves respawn fast af, so don't dawdle.  You're looking for the dwarves with the red shirts - they carry torches.  You need two, but if you find one start heading towards the far end of this area turning right as if you were standing at the door you used to enter.  There will be a raised area with a fire elemental and a brazier - use your torch.  Find the other red shirt dwarf for a torch and light the other brazier.  Doors open near the brazier that leads into a room with a big golem boss and fire shooting out of the walls.  Try to dodge the fire while killing the boss.  Doors open up behind the boss into the final room.  Kill all of the dwarves here before pulling the boss.  Or don't because that's hilarious, but you'll have to rez and run back.  If you are alliance and have the quest to save the princess, don't kill her when fighting the dwarf.  If you couldn't give a shit about that, make sure to kill her first.
---
That is every-fucking-thing in BRD from memory.
---
&gt;Allowing each form to be competitive alone was the destruction of the Druid.
---
I'd argue that if they'd put in proper hybrid itemisation in Classic, Druids could have been very viable shifting between forms as opposed to focused on one form. One of my goals in Classic is getting the Tier 0.5 set for my Druid as, aside from looking nice, it's  one of the few sets of gear that actually gives Hybrid stats (the other two main ones, the PvP set and Tier 2.5 from AQ are probably outside of my ability to find time for).
---
Way too many people have already called out of work that second half of the week.
---
Yeah but 5-9 is not the starting area. I mean the actual 1-5 starting area. Maybe I'm remembering wrong or it was different in TBC, but I remember running my UD all the way to the blood elf starting zone at level 1 to quest and couldn't accept any of the quests because I wasn't friendly with that faction. I had to grind to level 5 and then start in the next hub.
---
Night elf mohawk is going to make a killer comeback (I hope).
---
When I was a kid, I thought that would be a neat superhero game idea.  You create a character and when it spawned it had random powers.  As you develop your character you unlock more random powers.
---
The most recent beta datamine indicates a 0% scaling on each of those items, although some illegals have programmed them to scale at 100% which ultimately has resulted in 2k+ dps under those circumstances. 
---
The question that remains unknown is whether those items will proc things that trigger "on spell hit" like the Staff of Qiraji Prophets or the Blade of Eternal Darkness. Also, they might operate like Seal of Righteousness and cause a doubling of a weapon's unique "chance-on-melee" proc.
---
Just watched a countdown to classic with Kevin Jordan and he said that effects like this weren't originally intended to have sp coefficients however some got through the cracks and apparently they do. In that podcast he actually discussed these three items specifically
---
Get a laptop. Find a quiet place in the library!

They had us in the first half
---
You can definitely grab furor while leveling. Obviously youre not really going to get as much value from MOTW in lower stages of the game. I guess the caution that I would note is that unless you get furor early, you probably aren't going to get it until late as you will want to get to Leader of the Pack and Omen of Clarity pretty quickly.
---
Wasn’t worth formatting on my phone waiting for gas lol
---
This is a skinner's worst nightmare. It's like, so close, yet so far...
---
Retail is going to make money from Classic because every returning player has to subscribe to Retail in order to gain access to Classic.  
---
Classic on its own will generate no income outside of paid services (like server transfers) when they become available.
---
I was Horde Maelstrom from launch till Cata as well.  I just quit the game altogether in Cata.  My mains name was Malvagito, Undead Shadow Priest. 
---
I really wish Blizz would change their stance onaunch RP-PVP servers.
---
They didn't, at least not in vanilla, there us a shaman video testing then that shows this.
---
However, they changed some stuff during the vanilla to tbc hop and it fucked with how some items were coded, making them count as spells, affecting a wide range of trinkets, and giving those items 43% sp coeff, but whilst it did go unchecked throughout tbc and was fixed during wotlk, the bug occured during tbc and not vanilla.
---
Yes and we will have naxx on farm as soon as the rep requirements are met
---
Dps is a silly metric anyway, eps is the only real measure.
---
Hunter is at its strongest while leveling, which is why it is a very popular class to twink out at 19/29. It is still strong at 60, just nowhere near as broken as it is before that, on top of other classes getting stronger. 
---
Hunter is strong in PVE early on (MC/BWL) but falls off in later tiers due to lack of upgrades and scaling issues. As for PVP, it is always strong because of the utility it brings via tracking, traps, viper sting, flare, and strong burst. 
---
Hunter fares decently well in duels. It wins against melees (though is at a disadvantage when facing a skilled rogue) and can struggle against casters. In a theoretical scenario with unlimited kiting space, hunters could beat anything. Dueling space is limited though. Mages are annoying to fight but a skill matchup. Elementals can kill you in 2-3 casts. Good balance druids are extremely rare but I’ve found them to be annoying. Warlocks are your biggest counter. A single misstep can hurt you massively. You will lose if you try to kite adter you get dots on you and lose if you get too close, as a lock can 100-0 you inside a fear chain, and you have no ways to remove fears. Let’s not even talk about how tanky SL warlocks are, just know that there’s a reason why they’re seen as the strongest dueling spec. Spriests are a very annoying matchup, but more beatable than locks.
---
It didn't really blow up till TBC, christ I could melt faces as balance when TBC opened up, I remember being top DPS in Khara and wrecking shit in Nagrands world PvP
---
I mean, the people who can only play rarely/casually are actually a better profit than those who play religiously. They’re both subbed for the same price, for the same amount of time, only the casual players demand far less resources on blizzards end than someone playing to get their monies worth. So why not market to them?
---
Believe like the other guy said it’s part of the added interface features from the newer client, but if not I know it definitely needed an add on in vanilla I’m pretty sure. In retail there used to be an option in the interface and I believe I heard that it will be added into the new classic, but I have no references. Either way I wouldn’t worry too much if it is needed in an add on I’m sure one will be developed immediately and missing it for the first couple days wouldn’t be too harmful. Definitely understand the annoyance though.
---
Oh crap, does that mean that we're stuck with some of this insane insanity in Classic TBC? Sounds like it could be pretty game-breaking, to the extent that Blizz might want to patch it out even if it goes against "nochanges".
---
Its not a big difference. I would thing more about the active racial you would rather have. Escape artist or the human stealth see thing (name?).
---
5% int if you have like 200 fully buffed is only 10 more int. which is 150 mana and like .3 crit or something.
---
America truly is the future... quick mail a letter back to England and ask them to take us back!
---
mage is def the better class overall unless youre putting a heavy emphasis on MC/BWL dps
---
I'm already planning on playing everything but Warlocks and even I might level one of those for summoning players. NBD. Every class has their moments
---
I'm less annoyed and more running out of ways to prepare for launch :D
---
The hump for me is 20-30 on Horde. Fucking Barrens/surrounding zones. On Alliance, I'm less fond of 30-40. Fucking STV. But 40-50 I love, cause you get to start Tanaris and run ZF, and youre almost to Un'goro so you have something to look forward too :)
---
Yep I remember I was at work when my friend sent me a message that Classic was announced. Jumped up in my chair like a little kid. Had to calm down after I got some looks haha. Went home that day very joyful, one more month let’s gooo.

SL Warlock for 1v1 god

ORGANIZING A GUILD IS HARD! I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT 9 PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SIGN A CHARTER IN VANILLA WAY BACK WHEN; I CAN'T IMAGINE PUTTING TOGETHER A FULL RAIDING ROSTER
---
Troll priest with blackout is so good in pvp.
---
Hunter\*
---
I remember a multi boxer in AV solo wiping 40 people on Van with 5x Starfall
---
that rig probably runs WoW better than most computers did in 2005.
---
Do you mean the delay between pressing /petattack and the pet starting to move (same with /petfollow)? Or is it something hunter specific?
---
This. Every DPS warrior should prepare themselves for also being an offtank.
---
If you're a DPS-only warrior it is less likely I'll recruit you to my guild or even take you to 5mans (since you can just tank your own).

Can't you just skullflame sheild+spike demon forged breastplate afk

---
Alliance: Win at pve (raiding) and AV. Have better looking starting zones, with far more interesting quest items. Closer to end game raids. More room for different healers and/or hybrids in raid.
---
Horde: Better at PvP (save AV) Have great 1~36 leveling paths.
---
I used to play this on an old MX440 64mb card for about 3 years. It constantly over heated and crashed in raids but it ran the game, albeit on the lowest settings. 
---
The MacBook has geforce 750m which should kill it
---
And those filthy warriors would never let him join the lava runs, noooo, precious... Thieves, yes, precious, filthy thieves!
---
My recommendation, regardless of your role, would be to let your group and guild know “hey guys, I don’t know what I’m doing but I listen and follow instructions. I appreciate your patience while I learn the ropes”.
---
I would happily take the time (if available) to run with a guild mate who needs teaching. That investment will return in a solid raid member that I can count on. He admits his mistakes and doesn’t repeat them. He asks for help and provides assistance the next new guy that comes through.
---
Can I listen to the archives now?
---
I'm not even sure what class I'd roll. Maybe a healer
---
This was a 10k player poll for classic wow.
---
Bro that is dead on
---
I remember a Tier 3 warrior was mitigating like crazy.
---
Unpopular opinion: Bal druids are the strongest casting hybrid spec. 
---
You have to use consumables and downrank like a pro. But their total dps out put in NAXX (as they scale well) is higher than most would think. 
---
Issue, its still bad.
---
Channeling skills don't work like that in classic.  You don't start the 5 second rule until you've finished channeling.
---
This was covered in that "21 differences between classic and pservers for AOE farming."
---
Yes, but it works on humanoids, which is the vast majority of enemies in 5 mans.
---
&gt; The fact is most people set up a reoccurring subscription and never take the time to stop it.
---
Yeah, uhh... that is not a fact. I wouldn’t bet on most people not keeping tabs on their credit cards either lol.
---
old raid content is incredibly easier than classic raid content at the highest levels lmao
---
Druid takes dedication to play well. (Resto) druids are the easiest class to reduce in a raid down to 1-2, freeing up more space for shamans and pallies. Feral druids really need to tryhard to be good tanks or barely-passable DPS, and need to put a lot of effort into acquiring their gear from non-raid sources.
---
If you're up for the challenge, more power to you. Good druids will always be fine. But don't complain on the forums if you choose druid and aren't up for the challenge. This time around most people should be aware of what they're in for.
---
Sometimes life happens.  Especially if you are the sort of person who needs to pug a raid instead of go on a schedule with a guild.
---
Him patrolling Desolace was a big surprise. He's a lowkey Fel Reaver. Alliance Beware
---
Hwne are you gonna add circle jerk bingo card to it?
---
&gt;if they postpone the launch a FIFTEEN year old game ?
---
spoken like someone who has no idea what the fuck is going on lmao, I agree that it won't be delayed, but wow you have no idea how software development works
---
Nah, that would be sweet, though. In retail you can reroll them over and over until you get names you like, but I actually prefer the old style of what you happen to pull through the twisting nether is what you’re stuck with.
---
Nothing beats hunter for solo play and your other option for ally hunter would be... ewww. Dwarves are basically honorary Horde members - they smell bad and won't have issues living in mud huts (if beer is provided).
---
Head, ZG, flask, rend is like 50% of your raid dps for a pre-bis toon with 1 or 2 MC pieces.
---
Add the DM buffs and you lose something like 70% in the early days.
---
You're going to have to take warriors due to raid survivability loss to tank domo and harbinger and they get hit the hardest. 
---
Most classes won't be back to pserver scaling level until ZG. By then you're looking at AQ release and people won't even want to run MC.
---
WARRIOR
---
I already know everything in BRD but I actually got lost in your post, got turned around, fell into some lava and somehow ended up back at the entrance. Somehow that made me like it even more.
---
I’m gonna lvl up tailoring/engineering so that I can have the great tailoring items and then have engineers utility for raids. Tailoring will use cloth so I save that instead of doing first aid since warlock don’t really need it as much.
---
I’m also gonna have a lvl 5 alt just for disenchanting greens worth less than a gold. You can make a lot of money selling the de stuff you got leveling.
---
this entire comment chain makes me think the mental age of classic players hasn't changed since 2006
---
Low demand imo.  There will be many retail healers joining for classic.  The only time healers are in demand are when your guild is deep into aq40 and people start dropping like flies
---
That is literally the business motto for most gyms, tanning salons, Netflix, and other subscription based businesses. Keep the price low enough so people say it’s 15 a month and I’ll use it at some point.
---
It’s been mentioned but I typically spammed dungeons after level 45.
---
Guess I can post that next week since that is what I started working on Friday before I left work.
---
if you check the private server population, its roughly 20-25%
---
The gamer would die in days with that rig, 3 vital pieces are made in the USA and therefore likely to break in the first few hours of use.
---
Get the hang of pet control early on. It’ll make you more friends. Also, get an auto shot timer if you can. Auto shot is going to be key in any rotation
---
Convert to raid
---
Probably because hunters can cheese stacking Intel and agi giving them insane ap
---
lmao bro, you’re an M1, you will 1000000000% have enough time to play every day and still crush step next year
---
Sincerely,
---
An m3 who’s gonna play the shit outta classic when I’m not on medicine or surgery
---
In vanilla proper I didn’t know about “revive pet” until level 30. That period taught me well, so though it’s not the mainstream vibe I’m completely on the same page as you
---
Or just farming chests in dungeons pretty op
---
Hunter for a few reasons. I enjoy being underestimated. You can stand out as a good Hunter more than any other class since everyone assumes you're trash. Kiting is a blast. Being a solo group makes leveling a breeze. You can chain pull forever.
---
Stuck between orc shaman or undead priest gonna pvp as dps and plan on healing for pve any tips on which to choose?
---
I agree with you in it makes more sense. However, the masses just do not do it. I do advertisement for any time fitness, so may just a biased opinion. The times of people signing up long term is gone. The focus is mass people for cheaper subscriptions. We may have let’s say 500 people signed up for a gym and only 200 actually use it and that is even most likely a high number and they will continue with that sub because of the I may want to use it factor.
---
What
---
Ive been practicing leveling 1-10 on dwarf hunters in teldrassil, trying to figure out what's optimal.
---
I have not yet seen a gun drop in teldrassil and you can't learn bows until lvl 10. However, you can hit level 10 with your starter gun no problem. If you want it to be a bit easier, level through kharanos and then head over after picking up professions (just remember there are no mining nodes)
---
Fucking ace, got em again.
---
But in all seriousness if that's all from memory, you are the man. That was my favorite dungeon and ran it countless times but it's been so long I hardly remember anything besides the arena and the boss that drops the fiery enchant recipe. Cant wait to rediscover.
---
You straight up can't do the level 1 quests because it's normally race stuff
---
It depends on how focused your guild is. I swear raid nights would drag on forever because people always had some crazy ass reason they had to go afk, computers crashing, ect.
---
No need to advertise because people that became successful in life and not still living at home with parents at 30 yrs old will most likely not come back to play classic..
---
You have a point. Visual bugs are pretty far down the list of bugs to prioritize
---
Oh dear...
---
I'm just going mining-engineering.  I'm not going to be the super duper first speedrunner so I think I'll be able to buy or trade for a wand at the start.

29 bracket rogue with two Torturer's Pokers. One shot ambush

"Rally good players will pre use Wotf to prevent fear from death coil."
---
Are you sure?
---
Same here, so long as you stay above a minimum mana threshold (then you just ease up on the smites for a bit).
---
Yikes lol. So are you saying don't play healer LOL?
---
I'd assume they would implement the WoW map as it was in 1.12 and add the quests in as the phases drop.
---
Thanks for the kind words. I'm glad you enjoyed the guide.
---
I'd love to write a PvP guide but I'm not especially good at pvp.  So I feel I don't have much authority to be giving advice on pvp right now. I might though if a year down the line I improve my priest pvp skills.
---
I dont see the issue here? I didnt say u use WOTF to be immune to death coil. I said you use it to be immune from the spell which is called fear, that is casted after death coil. Death coil isnt a fear, it is a terror effect which is why WoTF doesnt work on it.
---
The beta is over, so right now no one *has* beta access.
---
maybe 1 in the 29 one 39, most twinks should be in the 49 bracket, but if you have any self respect you won't twink in the 19 bracket.
---
Who said bis?
---
IMO engineering items are available almost immediately - simply because bombs exist.  Forget dynamite, it's just damage.  Bombs will disorient mobs and give you some extra survivability.
---
If you end up levelling eng while you level your character - utilize bombs.  They're super helpful.
---
I personally think the 19 bracket is just gimmicky.
---
I'm trying to work out a good shaman for 29 that isn't resto

Ah, thanks.  I'm out of the loop on things, but maybe somebody tried it out.

I was looking at Holy priest, Marksman Hunter, or maybe... I don't know
---
Mother of god....
---
In most leveling guides Priests don't respec to shadow while leveling until like lvl 40 or 41.
---
Though I can only think of Shamans as of having a hybrid heal spec for both raid healing and pvp damage/heal.
---
Go left.
---
No this place is going to be a shitshow. If you think there's a number of repetitive threads now just wait
---
The only issue is that PvP, PvE tanking, and PvE DPS each require different specs.
---
It was brtual during vanilla when we were doing progression raids. Having to respec for raids during the week to tank and then respec arms for PvP on the weekends got super expensive. Luckily I was in a PvP oriented guild, so the guild helped me out.
---
Some classes are at least viable in PvP with their raid spec. Warriors cant do anything as prot in PvP.
---
O.o
---
No disrespect meant, but if you were top DPS in Kara as a Balance druid you had either zero hunters and rogues, or they were utter trash.
---
Me right now. Deciding to main tank for the guild or roll a mage for fun.
---
No, if classic brings a player to the game, it will have generated income
---
You dont think blizzard’s metrics will be able to tell what game you play more of? Its a pretty important factor of whether or not they should invest money into classic, and its a pretty easy metric for them to get
---
You get on your knees and you pleasure them in any way imaginable.   You have been given the gift of memery.
---
I'm planning the same, but for Herbalism/Alchemy instead.  Bank all the herbs and sell the leather to get a mount.  Drop skinning for Alchemy, and level that with the banked herbs.
---
Gonna be my first time rolling druid as well. Going for feral offtank and feral dps. Seeing what can be done recently on pservers has really gave me the drive to try and make this work. Yes ill have to farm my ass off in gnomergan and consumes out the ass. But i have always loved playing meme or underperforming specs.
---
Never tried deep resto, but I am curious about deep resto vs HoTW build for pve healing.
---
You can basically spec anything as a priest and do fine solo as long as you put 5 points in shadow for spirit tap. Wand spec, smite spec, ect are all fine.
---
Entry-level.
---
But that's ridiculous. Plenty of folks could be interested in WoW Classic, without even knowing it's being developed!
---
Could just mean Epics. You also don't need actually pre-raid BiS to raid. No need to get your panties in a twist.
---
Needs a SO square mentioning food/"space" during launch week.
---
Definitely would. I'm up for the challenge. 
---
I may just make a chart and roll some dice. Random everything.
---
let's see: HF-SMITE-(mob gets to you) SWP-MB for max, usually HF-MB/smite-SWP-renew is enough
---
Your guild will manage through BWL, but as you progress into AQ40 its going to become very apparent that meme specs are not great for raiding. I'll bet it'll be inevitable by then, that raiders are going to be getting upset and arguing about the use of meme specs as they get geared.
---
A tryhard feral dps druid can compete top 10 dps through all phases of content
---
Everyone is going to be posting pics of themselves and their friends. With captions about how great a time their having, and this one experience they had. 
---
The Murlocks of Elwyn really are hard!
---
absolutely trial and error. Sometimes you can't afford to downrank until your gear is good enough such that a lower rank is viable. So as you gear up, you have to keep evaluating.
---
As if posting a tweet from their official WoW twitter would affect their budget.

I KNOW RIGHT? I'M EXCITED AND HAVE NO OUTLET FOR IT.

Live WoW is a dessert. Tastes amazing, but after a few weeks of endless dessert, I'm sick and feel empty, bloated.
---
Classic is earthy meat and potato stew. Not as flashy as a chocolate cake, takes a lot longer to really dig into, but it satisfies and nourishes the soul well beyond what sugar can.
---
Any class that can heal can heal any dungeon as any spec although you may be drinking between pulls more if you're not in healing spec.  Raiding has longer fights and will probably require you to spec for healing if that is what you're being brought there to do.
---
40-45 on my various undead chars was torture
---
I’m seriously toying with the idea of rolling a Druid. I really like feral in retail. Granted, I know my life is going to be regulated to healing if I want to do PvE, and you’re not really gonna see any feral druids out there. I feel like I could perform pretty well in PvP, but not sure how they performed. Also, really love me some Tauren.
---
Yes, that's what I mean.
---
On a pservers with too many ppl around I got shadowburn early and it worked amazing for tagging first. Just like mage's fire blast. If you don't have ahadowburn then wanding is your best bet.

macro jump and resource tracking (inc. dwarf treasure hunting) to spacebar, ezpz

&gt; dungeon exp is insane on classic

How is it different than Pservers?
---
1.12 has plenty of quests to get you through those levels so it isn't a problem.  STV, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands, Searing Gorge, Blasted Lands.  There are no level ranges with "quest holes" where you have to grind.

Confirmed Thorium Point FP and questgivers are there
---
I ran out the windows as a NE. This was on a pserver, so not entirely sure it would work in Classic.
---
This looks like some nintendo64 graphics wtf
---
It's my favorite class, and it's been my main in every xpac, but I won't do it in vanilla again, I will totally roll one as an alt, and if we ever get TBC again I'll go back to it, but I'm not going through it again in Classic.
---
Depends on how good your guild is, my guild got MC down to like 25 mins and BWL to like 45, I remember specifically because we would hearth to BWL and then our hearths would still be on CD by the time we downed Nefarian so we would run out and go to MC. (we started doing MC 2nd because of this)
---
If I'm being perfectly honest, I would expect a cleaner and more organized interface if I were to be paying for a guide &amp; maybe things quest or item links to classic.wowhead or classic.db. Not to mention the fact that there is a large selection of free guides that are available, so even if your guide was phenomenal it would be hard to stand apart from the others.
---
I just realized.. Who the hell needs Fear Ward from Dwarf Priests when half your faction has their own fear break lol.
---
 "W/E I WAS GONNA FAIL ANYWAY "
---
this totally brings me back to classic.
---
What OP is referring to is the red spell animation when Warriors charge which was not in Classic and appears to be a Legion based animation.

If this is indeed what you are referencing OP, Im not sure if they have stated this is going to be in Classic or not. I sure hope not.
---
He can accept the quest, but it will send him to Kharanos instead of being able to do it in teldrassil
---
If rather deal with 40 than 0.
---
Tested a dwarf to teldrassil on the stress tests, there were basically no race locked quests there
---
how are you not surprised? It's Blizzard.... Most of the management are inept. Why do you think senior people are quitting left and right
---
That depends entirely on what results I get. I've leveled most classes to 60, and I know which ones I hate.
---
Lol it’s insane. I’m a marketing major, get me a job there smh
---
LOL hardly.  This sub is going to get a new post every 3 minutes.  Memes of every imaginable kind, pics of grouping up with old buddies, their first view of The Barrens, finding Mankrik's wife, first Hogger kill, allocating their first talent point, you name it.  Get ready for a hot gooey sticky circlejerk.
---
If the launch is anything less than perfect and server crashes &amp; errors start knocking everyone offline, this will be ground zero for complaints, jokes, fail memes, I-told-you-so's and general freaking out.
---
Its a forum stuff gets repeated i learned long ago to not get annoyed by it.
---
It didn't work on the last stress test and was patched out before 1.12 so I wouldn't get your hopes up (around 1.9 iirc)
---
i'm 40 and i'm like 10 years away from being figuratively dead.
---
Where is Mankirks wife??
---
You don’t even get shadowform though.
---
Yeah I would still play but I would have less enjoyment if I had to play a Warrior or Druid tho.
---
Yep. Early on the top ranked heals are better hpm in my experience.
---
It’s already in the game, together with cooldown timer and spell queueing. These are actually pretty big changes that nobody mentions ever.
---
This is totally it. Classic wow was made by the old Blizzard. Retail WoW is an Activision product. When Classic WoW ends up being more successful than retail WoW it will show Activision’s ineptitude.
---
I just keep following the guide.
---
Why would you use torturer’s poker? It’s a white item.
---
Yeah it works but it’s not worth doing. As a Warrior in Classic you kill NPCs so much faster than on private servers it’s really not worth it to kite.
---
26th for me.
---
Thanks!
---
For the true vanilla experience the servers must go down on launch day, patch day and maint Tuesday’s. They come back up and go back down.
---
I don’t know what they’re called... i just know the sound they make people make when there aren’t enough of them.
---
Haha BWL a guild killer. Gosh so many people are in for a reality check when Classic launches. I fear that most people won’t accept it and they’ll blame Blizzard for making Classic too easy when no this is really how easy Vanilla was back in the day. Players from 2004 were just freaking awful at the game!
---
I think Jesse still messes around from time to time at least. I know I've seen him do several streams in BFA times at least and he's far enough in where he had the Zandalar allied race unlocked.
---
Im sick of all these kinds of posts too
---
Not that it matters, but they hired 10 full time engineers just for Classic.
---
Is it stronger than a potato?
---
[We all would like to, but... ](https://imgflip.com/i/36on6x)
---
Yea one, things are kinda complicated between us though. Hasn't been on social media in a year so I doubt I'll get a response, not any time soon at least. Another friend...who was initially saying he had no interest and now all the sudden does now that release is close is apparently playing with me, but is really casual and the disinterest he showed before tells me he's likely to not keep playing or will play it very infrequently. The few friends that still play modern don't seem interested. The majority have left years ago and I doubt even know Classic exists nor would likely care. I pretty much intend to start over and make new friends.
---
On the contrary, I think it's going to be crazy for at least a month. 6 months later, we'll see.
---
But if you're able to MASTer them, then your enemies are really CRUISIN FOR A BRUISIN
---
Agreed. WoW launched during my senior year of high school. I started playing the following year during college because I had a ton of time on my hands and no one to tell me to quit wasting my day on a game. Kids who couldn't even read yet at that time are now in college themselves. They can recruit a whole new generation of players with the same experience that made their game huge in the first place.
---
Loot lag is an absolute must. I won't believe I'm truly back unless my troll is scraping his knees across the ground on his way to the next mob...
---
You are going to be the man who brings annihilator and night howl.
---
BOTH HUMAN AND ORC SEEM LIKE SOLID CHOICES, ALTHOUGH ORCS LOOK SLIGHTLY MORE BADDASS IMO. AT LEAST YOU'RE BOUND TO FIND FRIENDS TO LEVEL WITH AS EVERYONE LOVES A GOOD TANK. :)
---
"wow I can't login this is bullshit"
---
26th for us NA players.
---
Does it turn on? If the answer is yes then yes
---
Tanaris, Feralas, and Hinterlands usually gets me from early-mid 40s, then Searing Gorge has an assload of quests and you can start Un'goro at high 40s.
---
Personally for me 30-40 sucks the worst because you don't have your mount yet and STV is a fucking warzone 24/7
---
I fucking LOVED that cave... Back then I turned off bloom because my computer sucked too much so I didn't get the full effect but I loved all the huge crystals. When I came back after a hardware upgrade I was like, holy shit.
---
The first thing i do is hit the vanilla graphics button. We use those graphics on pservers already.
---
Yeah you’re one anecdotal experience is representative of everybody in the entire world.
---
The new client activates spells on key down by default and has done so since mid Wrath. There's a cvar to make it in key up by who the hell would want to do that.
---
The irony is both x amount of days till launch
---
AND I'm annoyed by x post made it on the bingo card
---
That's 2 for 1 baby
---
https://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=RandomClass
---
Built for current wow though.
---
I’m sure it was just my shit realm (Ursin) but I remember there never being any reasonably priced engineering mat.
---
I got a few people coming back. Not as many as I'd like but whaddya gonna do? Even a few is a lot better than none. 
---
But the thing about classic was making new friends, anyway.
---
Lmao that is literally never going to happen.
---
You best believe I'll be shit posting while flying
---
No i wont even read past hear me out you stfu!!!!!!!!!!
---
Warlocks pull like 1000 dps on patchwerk. The same story goes across the board even in dungeons. They're always threat capped with no aggro drop. 
---
They're not weak by any means. I used to farm UBRS up to rend on my lock with my bro back in the day when I was in blues/Mc gear to pay for his nightfall. Locks will not bring hunter damage unless they just ignore the tank and rip aggro every fight.
---
I agree. I see these posts from time to time and laugh. It's obvious these people never set foot in Vanilla WoW. Forsaken is undoubtedly better than Orc. 25% stun resist is nice but there's Free Action Potion which lasts about 30 seconds and it's better than the 25% stun resist. There's no "Free Fear Potion."
---
I doubt they even realize just how strong fear is in Classic. It doesn't break easy and can be spammed. However, Will of the Forsaken is also much stronger in Classic. WoTF doesn't just break fear every 2 mins, it **provides invulnerability for 5 seconds from fear, charm and sleep.**
---
Rogues are already strong against casters, but Warlocks and Shadow Priests are deadly because of their fear spam. These are top tier PvP Specs and WoTF gives Horde rogues an advantage against not only these two specs but also against Warriors.
---
Here's a breakdown for the terrible players who claim Orcs &gt; Forsaken:
---
* WOTF removes charm, sleep AND fear;
---
* WOTF has 2 mins CD, lasts 5 seconds;
---
* WOTF provides invulnerability against charm, sleep AND fear for 5 seconds;
---
* Free Action Potion provides immunity to stun and movement impairing effects for 30 seconds, 2 mins CD;
---
* Rogue PvP Insignia is on a 5 min CD and only removes charm, sleep and fear (does not provide immunity);
---
* Alliance healers will cry.
---
I am not saying Hardiness is bad. It's great when you're fighting melee classes like Warriors and Rogues, but overall it's just not as good as WoTF in Classic for PvP. Especially when you can just FAP ;).
---
Depends on what each person likes to watch imo. I watch streams and play at the same time. One person may find it boring... doesn’t mean everyone else will.
---
Upvote this man
---
you can bottleneck black lotus more effectively so yes that would definitely be a big one.
---
Yes it is.
---
Literally no way to know until release. This sub is a bubble and private servers are a bubble, and there's no way to know how many people from outside that bubble will play Classic and how many will play tanks.
---
Both are good in 5-mans. Locks scale better in high end raid gear.
---
I still have that epic two hander, sul'thraze.
---
I get out of the Navy on the 28th, and start college on the 4th of September so i get a solid week to sit in my underwear all day playing Classic :D
---
It can be useful if you are away from home and wants to use the auction house, use your crafting cooldowns, chat in guild chat, stuff like that.
---
It has an HDMI type d connector so you could use an external display and use a USB hub to connect standard mouse and keyboard if you really wanted, but it would have to be your only option for that to make senses.
---
People are going to start circlejerking against these posts, but I'm all for them. We've made it almost 2 years from the original Blizzcon announcement and we're almost home. I'm excited.
---
32? Get off my lawn junior!
---
- ZERO EXCUSES FOR LAYERING, REMOVE THAT SHIT ASAP!1
---
- NU-BLIZZARD BEING CHEAP CUTTING CORNERS EVERYWHERE. ONE BUTTON SERVER MAINTENANCE, ROBOT GMS, LAZY ASS ITEMIZATION. WILL WE GET A PROPER WEBSITE FOR THE GAME?
---
- PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THINGS HAVE CHANGED!
---
- THERE IS NO LACK OF HEALERS, THERE ARE 25% TOO MANY FKEN HEALERS IN THE GAME AND 33% TOO FEW TANKS ACCORDING TO SURVEYS! WELCOME TANKING SERVICES! GL FINDING A RAID SPOT FOR YOUR PRIEST! NO IT WONT BE LIKE OLD TIMES WHEN EVERYONE WAS LARPING ARAGORN, GIMLI AND LEGOLAS!
---
- ANOTHER THING THAT WILL HAVE CHANGED: BLACK LOTUS MARKET. HOW WILL THEY EVEN SPAWN IN CLASSIC? YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW, BUT MARK MY WORDS YOU WILL KNOW BEFORE THIS IS OVER! THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF FARMING INCOMING! "IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO MAKE AN ALT FOR FARMING"??? YOUR EXPECTATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED TO FUTURE MIN-MAX CRAZONOMICS!
---
- ENGINEERING. YOU HAVE TO PICK IT OR NO ONE WILL TALK TO YOU AND YOU WILL DIE ALONE. (YOU'D DIE ALONE ANYWAY)
---
&gt; RACIST PEOPLE IN COMMS.
---
- THESE DAMN FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPIONS OF MY-BUTTHURTNESS! NO, I'M NOT BUTTHURT THAT THEY'RE BUTTHURT, OR MAYBE A LIL BIT.. NO, I DONT HAVE BLACK FRIENDS, AND THE ONES IVE MET IVE ENCOURAGED TO BECOME RACIST. SURPRISINGLY, MANY HAVE AGREED, IT'S MAINLY THE BUTTHURT LEGION OF WHITES WHO SEE RACISM AS A PROBLEM!
---
On a warrior it's when you finally feel like you have your full toolkit available, so it's pretty smooth compared to 20-40. I just quest, and I'll slowly gain levels, same as any other level range.
---
Same, except Water Temple
---
I literally just watched this movie...wtf
---
God. What the fuck am I going to do this football season.
---
HALT STOP
---
Yup, this is exactly whats gonna happen. Except I think Im gonna go hunter but I will go rogue last second.
---
Thanks for the guide. It's clear you put tons of effort into it. Don't let the haters get you down.
---
From my memory Holy Fire is stronger than Smite in both damage and DPM. It has a bit longer cast time, but since you aren't in combat before the cast finishes, it doesn't matter.
---
You're doing that right now, in real life.
---
Thanks, that was meant to say 'Pursuit of Justice' - updated!
---
Do you know of any studies that were done in Vanilla? I don’t care enough to really go down the rabbit hole myself but I feel like early WoW and people’s’ addictions might’ve been a really unique case study. Given the state of the internet, gaming in general, etc
---
I always welcome those
---
Don't worry, the counter keeps going.  We'll get "365 days ago, WoW: Classic was released" threads.  Just as much as we get "X days ago, WoW: Classic was announced"
---
if you look on the brighter side of the situation, without advertising youll have a playerbase thats much more likely to stick around and play till naxx. Compared to a more newer playerbase that ends up quitting and leaving all the realms with less population on average. Blizz can only predict how many layers they need assigned for each server, if they estimate that wrong then theres lots of low pop servers
---
Not great honestly. It doesn't know what it wants to do. Improved enrage would be better served in resto vs 3 pt in healing touch. You got natural weapons but not shapeshifter in balance. Didn't even look at the feral tree because these two decisions make no sense. Hate to sound like a broken record but don't try to reinvent the wheel. The best specs are already easily available.
---
I didn’t really have to try. My 5-man squad and I figured out our classes and profs before 2017 was over, they couldn’t be restrained.
---
Word.
---
I have an i3 8th gen, Intel HD 620 integrated GPU.  If you have dual channel memory, you're looking at ~60fps in the 1.12 client.  
---
I don't know how that translates to the 1.13 classic client, but really if you're playing 30+, you're more than fine for WoW: Classic.
---
This is also a totally viable way to level!
---
We've cleared all content before. We know what we are in for, but I'm scared to be lower than the tanks lol
---
but then you have to be alliance :s
---
I make vids for undead horde rogues. Your question has a wide range.
---
Uhhhh wow was FAR from low budget back in the day.
---
They had a fucking Mountain Dew advertising campaign *and exclusive WoW flavored beverage*.
---
I'm thinking about playing this as a side game a month or two after Classic launch.
---
Hell yeah I had a shaman with the rage hammer and when it procced with troll berzerking you had a 2 hander swinging at some sub 2.0 speed and proccing windfury crits that could hit that high. I think with ES and all crits with Stormstrike it could do 4k, never got all those crits in a row though. This was TBC I think.
---
Had a 49 hunter during TBC who could aimedshot for 1200 or so with trinket.
---
Potato hardware will only add to the nostalgia factor. :]
---
Based on what you are saying it means, that anyone who does something for long enough, gets the same attention and popularity? Think a bit before writing, its much deeper than that. I can as well start rapping and in 10 years, everyone will know me like they knew eminem
---
Episode 9 didn't come out yet, but I don't think it'll change your mind :)
---
People make videos about WoW? This is shocking news to me.
---
Maybe people enjoy different things? Shocker.
---
Your wand is your greatest ally while leveling.
---
or you could just downvote it
---
Which is why I said the fear AFTER the death coil. 
---
Nice job editing your post, I can do the same. The effect from wotf persists long enough that you can read a death coil and it blankets you from the fear. So they won’t fear you after, or attempt and waste a cast.
---
Well, off the top of my head...
---
Every 2 levels you can learn new skills from your class trainer. If you use a spirit healer to resurrect you suffer from "res sickness" reducing your stats by 75% starting at level 11 for 1 minute, adding 1 minute until level 20 where you will always wait 10 minutes. Before level 10 there is no res sickness.
---
At level 10 and onward every level gives you a talent point.
---
At level 10 you can queue up for Warsong Gulch (Won't be available right away in the game.) And play with people up till level 19. 20-29, 30-39, etc. 
---
At level 40 you can learn your mount skill. Level 60 is the highest level you can get. 
---
Mobs don't drop very profitable grey vendor items till around level 24, but it's still worth picking up. 
---
Level 40 and onward mobs armor ramps up drastically. 
---
People say level 1-45 is half the leveling experience. I say 1-40 since with a mount 40-60 goes just as fast. 
---
You need to be level 35 to learn the last bit of your trade skills. Level 5 to pick up most trade skills, 15 or 20 for journeyman I forget.
---
Gold caps out at 214k. At least, that's what I remember my limit being. Could be changed for Classic. There's no way to test that on the beta.
---
The earliest I recommend doing a dungeon is 13. You CAN do it earlier but it will be difficult.
---
For melee, I recommend upgrading gear through the AH at 30 if you're good with money. Most people aren't. Upgrade at 24 if you are mostly grinding.
---
Quests have very low exp gain if you are 8 levels above it.
---
Mobs also stop giving exp if you are 8 levels above them. They will still drop loot though.
---
Just google my Reddit name. I don't want to break any reddit rules or bust an algorithm / be labeled a shill.
---
Not at all. Many people LIKE the bones sticking out of arms.  
---
I'd NEVER play a human, because they look so fucking plain. But UD's look absolutely amazing in robes and leather. The bones give them a sharp appearance that looks intimidating without being drown out in a single color (like robes often can be).  
---
In addition, OP casting and walking animations.
---
Do you have any better recources for leveling in MM/SV besides the „built“ you have postet? 
---
I mostly agree with the point that playing MM/SV will train you to be a better hunter but it has so few good recources in the web for that. 
---
Maybe you have a good video or written guide for especially LEVELING as MM/SV.
---
well to be perfectly honest it like that now
---
Fury and arms is better for tanking while levelling than prot is. 
---
Tanking 5 mans at 60 is easy as any spec, no need to respec for that.
---
PvE is a bigger deal for anyone that plays PvE and PvP.
---
Also [Mage trinket dispells fear already](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18850) so Undead is only a double-measure. Not to mention that you can get the Blacksmithing Fear Immune Trinket. And/Or Engineering Shadow-Reflector.
---
Alliance has fuck all in feralas, hinterlands, badlands, and don't have the Azshara or late swamp of sorrows quests so that's a strong no.
---
I do hate that “living with your mother” is frowned at all the time. 
---
I’m caring for my mentally unstable mother and little sister after my dad passed away 2 years ago. 
---
 I have the money to leave but I can’t see my mom fall of this world, my little sister needs her..
---
And then paying for your medical bills. USA! USA!
---
LIMITED BAN LISTS
---
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S STILL A THING BUT IT WAS IN ~~CLASSIC~~ VANILLA AND I HAD TO DOWNLOAD A MOD TO FIX IT
---
I was thinking Hunter since I've been maining one since TBC. Was a Warrior in Vanilla but did level a Hunter.
---
What I would advise is make sure you can trap, control your pet, and kite. Learn to tell the area of your deadzone just by looking at the screen. Those mistakes will be amplified on your Hunter since the class already has a bad rep for "Huntards." 
---
There are also no such things as melee Hunters. The point of your melee abilities is to use them in order to get back in Range.
---
FRICK
---
Hey masses of people who have never played an MMO! Do you want to play a 15 year old game that takes a huge amount of time to do anything has pretty crappy graphics by today's standards, and has artificial lag to simulate how crappy the internet was 15 years ago that we had to add to make some crazy fans happy? Well have I got the game for you, for only $15 a month-
---
The dash is there because that's when everyone has stopped watching the ad. Before that, some were probably lost, but not until a subscription cost was mentioned did they finally lose everyone. Seriously, there are plenty of free MMOs out there so when someone hasn't played one before, and doesn't know anybody that plays them, and doesn't engage with social media sites with communities that play them doesn't want to shell out any money for their first try. And if all of the above isn't true, that means they have already heard of classic WoW.
---
The only market they're really missing out on is people who have stopped gaming and might come back for a month or two for the sake of nostalgia. But even that market is way smaller than you'd think. They'll probably throw out some cheap banner ads closer to launch, but it's definitely not worth the money to produce and run actual commercials.
---
ST also. At least for healers.
---
&gt; English speakers just struggle when there is a vowel after ts.
---
I would go so far as to say that so many english speakers struggle that the word has evolved to just be sunami. The T is totally silent now.  
---
Descriptivism vs prescriptivism yadda yadda
---
imagine wanting to play a night elf priest so much that you actually believed this.
---
Pretty god awful.
---
This is what the system prompts me when checking about the Mac:
---
MacBook Pro (Retina 13, early 2013)
---
Processor 2,6Ghz Intel Core i5
---
Memory 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3
---
Grafics Intel HD Graphics 4000 1356 MB
---
it was fucking terrible, we used 2 repair bots.
---
I got Jindo healing mace from it and an enchant, i quit the guild right after the run (more like marathon)
---
I played a lvl 39 warrior twink in TBC era together with my buddy who played a lvl 39 Druid. I would say it is more diverse at 39 compared to 19 (and 29?) and less twinks all together. Never played 49 or 59 but I reckon every tier after 19 or 29 is more fun because of more diversity, more talents, maxed professions etc
---
doesn't get me down at all, I've had requests over the past months to advise if we made any portion free, and so I have done my bit!
---
Dummie
---
Hunter
---
I think you're underestimating how easy "hy" sound is to make. I've never met a native english speaker who couldn't properly pronounce hyundai, hyuna, etc.   
---
Now getting an American to say Seoul as "suh-ool" instead of "soul," that's a good one.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Druid can do the most different play styles. You can cast like a mage, tank in bear form, be a rogue in cat form, heal in resto spec.
---
Easy class for new players would be hunter but pick what you want by the time you hit 60 you will learn what ever class you pick. Pick your proffesions on what will benefit you personally raiding guilds have plenty of alchemists, enchanters and what ever else they need.
---
Very welcome!
---
I thought everyone was confident millions upon millions would be there launch day. Why would they advertise more ?
---
I‘ll still be here since i can‘t start playing straight from the 27 on...  so keep me entertained
---
Unfortunately you are locked to the raid you started it would be nice to be able to help others sometimes even if you could get no loot.
---
LOL you got downvoted for sarcasm. People are angry af on this sub.
---
&gt; too busy with adult life
---
watches 5 hours of Netflix every night.
---
[I googled this in 2 seconds. Seems legit ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/78ifop/an_advanced_and_honest_guide_to_enhancement_pve/)
---
You forgot that they want to know if shadow priest is viable with this amount of play time
---
Yeah I totally prefer DS/Ruin mostly because critting huge shadowbolts is like 90% of the fun of raiding as a warlock.
---
What is the benefit of using WOTF randomly on the offchance the lock might just Coil -&gt; Fear, over simply waiting till you actually get Feared and then using WOTF to break it? Yeah it costs a global to WOTF, but after the Coil, you wouldn’t be in melee range anyway.
---
Oh man you're gonna be pissed off a lot.
---
That said, you have a great way to get people to join your party when you can't find [tank/healer] -- LFM "X" Dungeon CAN SUMMON can entice a whole lot of people to fill out your group quick as opposed to spamming chats / whispering players around your level who can fill that slot. 
---
It's a mixed bag, life tap while you wait.
---
It's like people don't realise that people in hardcore guilds are competitive and play a lot. 70+ hours per week with the intent on gearing hard and fast. It would not surprise me if some guild is doing split runs of MC with alts by the week 6 mark to gear their main raid.
---
I would love to see proof of a Hunter doing 1200 DPS.
---
Lolol you don't remember how much time was spent running and flying between places. That 2nd monitor is what keeps you from being homicidal.
---
Well, I'm not even a native English speaker.
---
I mean in reality it saves an actual wipe. If you blew your soulstone mid-fight I'd lose my shit.
---
A read isn’t random. Say your stunlockong and you know ur going to have an opening. You Wotf and are immune from their fear if they end up death coiling you.
---
And in the server I played you couldn’t use it whole affected by the cc only before.
---
Agreed! 
---
I tried to have my 'oh-shit' CD's on the middle and extra two mouse buttons as well, but it often resulted in a tight squeeze pushing jin the middle plus extra button one and two.
---
I then started running like Z for defensive CDs Macro and X for offensive CD macro. V for interrupts on all classes, so that's bound to muscle memory till the end of time.
---
It will be flooded with hunderds of people crying that they can't play because the login servers are overloaded.
---
Playing a Gnome Mage named Humpygnome would be the worst ever, but I'd still likely play that over nothing. So yes.
---
No, with imp. backstab.
---
Lol totally agree with the 20-30 horse grind.  I get so tired of the fuckin barrens/stonetalon/azsharas
---
I tried to play AH a bit on a pirate server and had 60g at lvl 27. It'll be harder early of course since that AH on that server was already established. But yes, it's very possible to get 2000g while you lvl to 60.
---
A lot of people will sell shit cheap as fuck just to get a quick buck. Just use that to your advantage, purchase and resell. Just like a stock market.
---
I don't know if anyone would agree with me but the GCD from lifetap has always felt like 50% of an actual GCD. 
---
I don't know why, but it just does.
---
Are you sure it's 0%? Classic wowhead also doesn't show a scaling if it scales 100% with spellpower.
---
Possibly the worst feral spec I’ve ever seen. I think it’s best if you stick with the cookie cutter pvp specs which have been perfected by some of the best Druids out there.
---
The worst thing about tanking is when you don't get to tank. Especially when you go DPS just to watch another tank do a terrible job and every little mistake they make is like nails on a chalkboard(far too many people play tanks who have awful awareness).
---
It's one of those things where most people make out it's fine that you effectively get forced out of the role you want to play, but a lot of DPS and Healers wouldn't tolerate it if the same thing happened to them.
---
It is, but I thought he meant that every tick of SW:P added another stack of shadow weaving. It doesn't and he didn't mean that either, just me misunderstanding.
---
Hinterlands is a great zone, especially for horde and if you know people around your level. There are some quests in alterac, do the rest of the quests in stv, tanaris, and maybe ferelas but can't remember that well tbh
---
i feel like they are no where near as bad as people make them out to be, oomkin is be pretty lethal and its super fun(plus imagine dying to a fat owl thats killing you with the moon). theyre insane twinks at all brackets. great dungeon tanks (i dont know much about raid wise as I dont have any experience there).
---
Not only healing for pve, druid is also better tank than warrior for 5 mans
---
I do not no but they were definitely done, as WoW was such a sensation it no doubt scared plenty of soccer moms senseless. As for you’re line of thinking, I believe it is quite clear that gaming nowadays is a lot worse on factors that could influence you psychologically than it was back then. It’s seen quite clearly with the industry’s use of loot box gambling mechanics and the various subtle tricks they use. 
---
What makes you think early WoW was a unique case? Be wary of mistaking a game being an engaging experience for addictive. When something is highly compelling it can certainly make teenagers and others with under developed compulsion systems do odd things, and even have those of us with functional compulsion systems want to choose it over serious matters, but that doesn’t mean it can develop addictions. If you have a functional compulsion system, then fundamentally vanilla wow is no different than caving into or choosing not to buy ice cream at the store.

all the lvl 1-10 character screenshots, elwyn forest is going to blow up the forums, "this is the barrens chat i remember" blowing up the forums  
---
just wait
---
People in this thread are way exaggerating the times. The clear times will be closer to pserver clear times than to vanilla clear times. So after progression you will with a competent group where everyone is on the same page that they want to go quick, but not use the class stacking etc. that speedrunning requires end up with about the following times.
---
MC less than 1 hour. BWL 1-1.25 hours. ZG 1 hour. AQ20 1 hour. AQ40 1.5-2 hours.
---
Naxx is an exception where going faster will require quite a bit more preparation and it will also take quite a bit for it to get to farm status so this can be anywhere from 3-8 hours.
---
next to the entrance to ashenvale in the scout tower
---
This is flawed logic. Sure, the mechanic attributes all that damage to a single Mage in the DPS Meter, but all other Mages are contributing to it and if you want to be completely fair you should divide / at least weigh the damage contribution.
---
I don't know what class you're playing but one trick is to do a full respecc once you get to 40.
---
It might slow you down but it will give you new spells and a new playstyle which will make youe character feel fresh.
---
I am personally going to play enhancement shaman while leveling. But somewhere in the 40-50 bracket i might respec to elemental just to spice things up
---
Its supposed too indeed !
---
All great suggestions, thank you for taking the time to post some thoughts.
---
For now we're going to rest and recover in time to chase launch, then when we have a bit more energy we'll be looking to convert addon etc.
---
There's no other posts to make at this point so just unsub then.
---
Sell portals to UC
---
When you've been ganked into submission at the pirate camp, hearth out and call it a night in the inn.
---
It will be worse here than WW2 if servers fuck up.
---
Pulling tons of trash and aoe it down is so satisfying though.
---
Probably. But do we know are the values of attack, spells and timings correct for Ragnaros on private servers? I'm not sure.
---
and all the DPS.
---
Please leave heretic.

I play warrior cause its nice &amp; straightforward
---
&gt;**Have I gone wrong somewhere**
---
I wonder, how do you expect us to answer that? I mean, you haven't actually shown us any of your calculations, so for all we know you accidentally compared Marksmanship with an Arms warrior in your calculations.
---
If you share your work people could check it.
---
This sub/every major city lol
---
I have decided for priest as well. Now im torn between Undead looks or Trolls Shadowguard, female troll looks decent.
---
With the low armor values having been confirmed for classic I dont see expose armor being used at all but only sunder armor.
---
goddamnit someone open a ticket I died cause I pulled 2 mobs
---
For wow classic, Mankirk will be the wife.
---
The last big pserver launch i played on went to big length to emulate the patch progression of original vanilla.
---
They didn't stop at unlocking raids/bgs in intervalls, they also progressively updated items to reflect their stats in different patch states and also removed quest hubs on launch that got added later in vanilla.
---
Searing gorge for example is a quest hub that was pretty much empty for a good part of vanilla and some private server tried to replicate that for the first few months which led to many people having a quest drought.
---
I'm honestly going to look forward to see the difference in difficulty from pserver to classic.
---
On pservers doing ST as a level 48 would be a very bad time, the huge emerald dragonkin groups around the circle in the groundlevel are so very hard, you'd get rekt hard.
---
For me personally it always was: healer in healing spec with healing items like Cassandra's Grace [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13102](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13102), fine by me to be level 48. But rather level 50 at the least in other cases.
---
DPS level 52, tank level 53-54.
---
Hakkar and Shade of Eranikus are really difficult bosses when I did them.
---
WHY ISNT POKEMON IN THE GAME????
---
Well, yes and know. Since raids will need to be more organized, the kind of people that die in lfr probably won't put the effort to find a guild, get the onyxia attunement etc. So hopefully, the worst of the worst won't ruin raids. A bit like in wod, when heroic dungeons were always quite smooth because the horrible player couldn't beat silver playgrounds.
---
What about the taunt miss chance on 4 Horseman?
---
Excellent shitpost. 
---
Yes I would. It would be an interesting experiment haha.
---
Removing bleeds, poison, diseases etc for a free vanish is quite dope also though. Remember that undead priests devouring plauge is a disease and if yoi cant remove that you are a goner.
---
Nothing comes close to what a warrior is capable of being. Don't change. Warrior is the true Alpha class of WoW. You put in a lot of work and you get a damn good reward for it.
---
lol @ people who bought the ultrawide meme
---
Lol yeah a good friend of mine was giving me the same story the other day.  Dude plays dota2 pretty much every day but doesnt have time? Just say you prefer to play dota you clown lol.
---
&gt;a few of our former colleagues have opted not to make their works public
---
theyll be forsaken by morning, my liege
---
You will be a night elf male warrior and you will like it.
---
Do you have any plans to be Blizzards new PR representative?
---
Priest. Shadow priests are disgusting in pvp and top tier healer in pve.
---
the complexity might be on par, but vanilla raids are much more unforgiving. If you do manage to fuck it up its much more likely to wipe the raid. Also 40 people fuck up more often than 25.
---
BEFORE PODCASTS RADIO WAS HARD!!
---
Also while leveling, I already know exactly how to tank / pvp / deal damage in a professional manner. Hard to give that up :(
---
So it isn't it.
---
On the other hand, the more skilled players the smoother the dungeons, less erroneous need-rolls etc. Basically, people who know what they’re doing &gt; people who don’t know what they’re doing.
---
Just discovered your channel, seems like I have 46 classis video to watch
---
This guide is a mess
---
"B**lackrock Mountain** is a [zone](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Zone) between the [Burning Steppes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Steppes) and the [Searing Gorge](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Searing_Gorge), linking the two regions in the [Eastern Kingdoms](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Eastern_Kingdoms)."- [**https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blackrock\_Mountain**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blackrock_Mountain)
---
It appears to be a zone. I looked it up myself just now, because I wasn't certain.
---
So basically enhance shaman is just for the windfury totem. Its viable to run one of these in the raid. They are also the best class to use the nightfall axe. Basically the shaman dps is low, but you will be raising the dps of the other dps
---
Play with a paladin or shaman.  salvation / tranquil totem.
---
Does anybody actually know when SF daggers starts to get ahead of combat dagger? Some, like you say bwl, others say aq40 and some say naxx
---
I always make my bank character a lvl 39 twink. 
---
19 is too boring
---
Lol
---
Buying lots of gold?
---
This is correct.
---
This is 100% bullshit story.
---
Copy pasta twitch crap...
---
Good point. I have uploaded my sheets with a link in my OP.
---
Bwl 1 hour 30
---
MC 1 hour
---
Aq40 2 hours
---
Naxx if you're going through not willing about 4 hours.
---
Ye I meant that ”jebaited”. What does that mean?
---
Can’t google myself into the stress test
---
how about only 30 days until you stop seeing "only x amount of days until classic" posts?
---
There's a lot of druid hype in this forum... I was druid main back in the days and i think many who fall for it will get tired of the class pretty quickly. 
---
* You will not see big numbers.
---
* You will not melt faces in PVP. 
---
* You will fight incredibly hard to do anything other than healing in raids. 
---
* Your heals in raids will be slower than priests and paladins.
---
You will only shine if you really learn the class to its full extent. All these streamers which are awesome to watch have played a lot on private servers and learned the class 100% and also come up with ingenious ways to utilize its full potential. That was always the case. To beat someone in PVP you have to be way more skilled than them, but as a reward, if you got that good you could beat most anyone. One youtuber said something like: it's the most nuanced class, a bad druid is really bad and a good druid can shine very bright, whereas a bad mage will always do good numbers.
---
27/8, you have your date backwards silly american
---
Why wouldn't it work? The TBC client is 12 years old.
---
Slash wave
---
'*cries in bagspace*
---
You are closer to the truth. People working and expecting to get there in under a month honestly are kidding themselves hugely.
---
These posts build hype for me :) it was technically less than a month on the 30 day point.
---
Oooh, I thought the client was relevant
---
Back in Vanilla I stayed in the 50-59 on my Rogue, up until I hit rank 10. This was in the middle of Vanilla's lifespan and I didn't really fancy ranking up against fully geared Tier 2 characters as a fresh level 60, so stayed at level 59 to fight against similarly geared opponents.
---
There were quite a few of us and we began forming our own premade. One person in our group hit rank 12 (General) at level 59, which I thought wouldn't be possible. She had a massive advantage because the rank 11 epic mounts actually have a level requirement of 40 (although it's impossible to get rank 11 at level 40), so while the rest of us were plodding along on our 60%ers in BGs, she was at 100%.
---
I may do the same thing in Classic. There will be less of an advantage though, as the original blue PvP gear had a requirement of level 58, but Classic will have the updated PvP gear which required 60.
---
But in my experience an alt always stays an alt. You never get as good as if you'd play the alt as long and intensively as your main I suppose.
---
ya im ditching you fuckers immediately
---
FYI it'll be flooded with 'server down' and 'lag' memes
---
That’s not my point. All I’m saying is that parts of vanilla just sucked, including ganking atrocities.
---
It's probably worth it to quest in Silithus for the rep
---
If your smart you can not only skip classes but also make money on the side with some kind of internet hustle. Only do the bare minimum at school. You can't cash A+ research papers. By the time you graduate your internet hustle could potentially be something you actually scale to 1M+/year. Making the degree useless anyways.
---
"check out my battlestation"
---
Feral for pvp?
---
No. That was deliberate. It's because private servers wanted to progress through the original patch history as closely as possible.
---
That meant that it used old mount skins, old tier 2 sets until the visual update and also no quest hubs until the patch they arrive.
---
Someone who hasnt played for 13 yeaes, Barrens is the one I look forward to the most. That and Tanaris.
---
I've never seen a single person provide actual proof of it, be it empirical or theorycrafted. Have you?
---
The files are in the computer! \*Throws computer on the ground\*
---
Absolutely. But i mean if you hated warrior you could make the alt your main. The fact that it's your alt in the first place kind of implies you prefer your main anyways. :p Just play the fucking warrior man xD
---
Prioritizing the good of the whole over the good of the self doesn't imply sacrifice, although it mostly turns out that way. Also, prioritizing the whole over the personal doesn't imply ignoring the personal - we all need to eat and pay the rent. I'd put Joana firmly in the &gt;generous&lt; category.
---
NOW YOU CAN ENJOY THE SOUND OF SLAUGHTERING COWS THO, WAY SATISFYING TBH
---
Yea time stands still out of combat
---
ill show you an eternal palace in about 30 days LOL! FCK BFA
---
Theres a drop down box above the play button on the battle.net client, selected the classic option. (Same way to download the ptr)
---
So classic is out in less than 1 month now and still no word about the final stress test, thats bizzarre.
---
No, go to wow and change client just like you would region. 
---
If you can't find it near the play button...
---
The amount of “oh dear god no” reactions in here to someone having fun with something suboptimal is so cringe.
---
It's in the dropdown menu in the WoW tab.
---
Version &gt; World of Warcraft Classic
---
Well hidden ;)
---
Book of Eli
---
Nuzlock wow haha. That would be interesting.
---
Also this is a fantastic idea if you're out and about. Check in at a starbucks and farm mats for half an hour while sipping a fancy drink and packed lunch for your lunch break
---
As wow aged it got more SOY and Anime like
---
If you are afraid of being bored, maybe.
---
Tough question to answer because it's all up to how your goals with classic factor in.
---
Are they unrealistic or are you confident in how long you'll play / what you'll do.
---
For me my classes 15 years ago was rogue then paladin then finished vanilla with lock.
---
This time around I'd love to players mage, priest, warrior but I doubt I'll put much time into 1 - so my plan is to just get my mage up, do dungeons / mc &amp; ony then I'll probably stop playing until bgs come out, then I'll resub for 1 month, get bored then probably play Cyberpunk and leave classic there just for when the mmorpg itch resurfaces.
---
Eh, it sorts looks to me my parents (both late fifties now) are living their best lives right now, since all the kids are out and my parents can finally use their money on themselves. So I'd say you have lots to look forward to!
---
Happy cakeday!
---
Smoke in my nappy dreads.
---
I'm Mr. T and I'm a night elf mohawk!
---
I'm looking forward to the "Classic lasted XX days before my launch hype died down and now I'm playing fortnite / Apex legends again"
---
It's just a spectator sport. I bike to town every day, doesn't mean I will participate in the tour de France, but riding a racing bike sometimes makes watching it a bit more fun.
---
Oh man, you must be fun at parties, social events and anything else that require humans to interact with you.
---
No it's not
---
Blizzard's having management issues I think. Also too many IP's to juggle. Not enough dedicated teams to finish projects on time
---
What? They stated that numerous times. They only kept 2 versions in 2004 - live and development. When new versions were posted, they were replacing live with development, meaning previous live version was lost. It changed at one point and they started keeping older versions but it wasn't during vanilla.
---
140p
---
swear words dont equal rudeness. you huge pussy.
---
Hmm, WoW should be in the left column of the launcher alongside their other games like Overwatch and D3. Try reinstalling the launcher and see if the WoW icon reappears
---
I'd be happy to have a couple of twinks at 39 if the population is good enough to warrant it. Otherwise 29 + 19 are okay too.
---
ACKTUALLY.............
---
For sure, but like 95% of those are general wipes. 
---
In rare cases I've had healers use their SS pre-wipe to save the party. It's just a butt-clench situation all around.
---
No I menat the Classic Client. I understand how it works now.
---
What the actual fuck is this response. Have you ever played on a private server.
---
The whole point of the shield/smite/sw:p rotation is profiting from 5sec rule and you don't mention it?
---
I sit there stone faced doing absolutely nothing. Similar to what an enhancement shaman does actually.
---
Fair enough! 
---
I guess I internalized a lot of the movement into my brain as a literal child and that's why it felt like the GCD felt lower when life-tapping (cuz I was doing other stuff at the same time). 
---
Cheers mate!
---
For what it’s worth, little me pretty much did the spec you mention raiding enough to kill cthun. Thought slice and dice terrible and figured backstab and evis was the only thing to do. I imagine you can do it just fine in casual guilds, as you’re still a rogue and will do plenty of dmg, but you are definitely gimping your dps and will need to find a guild that don’t mind that.
---
If you are going meme specs you should use stormstrike it will help your elemental shamans and moonkins. As for spec that is harder. You need to get hitt capped and cheaper totems are good so is extra range so resto tre is nice on the other hand extra damage from fire totems and extra critt is good aswell
---
Grinding, lots of Grinding.
---
Hang on I thought we were the Zac galafanakas card counting math meme 24/7. Someone has mis-sold me PPI
---
It is an overstatement(apologies), but it breaks the boredom of grinding without losing much of leveling-speed efficiency. RFD is great for paladins and warriors as you get your first blue plate pieces in there.
---
No
---
I mean most bosses before mythic are really simple even in retail. I did all of Uldir heroic and some mythic before I stopped playing, and most of the bosses there were really simple except for a few. Might have a few more mechanics than vanilla, but even heroic raiders will wipe in vanilla for sure.
---
I powerlevel it at 60.
---
Honestly, only reason you should go to another starter zone at level 1 is if you want their mount. Otherwise just get to level 5 or 10 (next quest hub) and then join up.
---
I'm not really inclined either way. It seems like an extremely mundane story, why are all the replies sure it's bullshit? Do we really think no adults with normal jobs Want to play.... I mean my guilds MT is in law school now and he's coming back...... Isn't that just very normal and not special.
---
It looks like he really doesn't know from this answer, and they're fishing for feedback because they could go either way on that quest hub.
---
I have played this game for 14 years all by myself and it seems this time will not be any different.
---
If you are worried about your guild and your impact on raids, you shouldn't pick a tank, if you don't have that much time for it. I'd chose a generic damage dealer that isn't crucial and can be replaced easily, in case you have no time (e.g. a mage). So don't be the only hunter to be able to dispel frenzy or the only shadow weaver etc.
---
That way, everyone will be happy.
---
I just want to use it for when I'm away from home, I don't think I'll use for any gameplay but just to use the auction house, use my crafting cooldowns, chat in guild chat, stuff like that.
---
Seriously like I can't be the only one who was watching their job postings? What is it with this sub and all the bullshitting?
---
Simulataneously? Or leave an alt gaining rested xp?
---
All great points. Obviously knowing/prediciting the rogue is there in the first place is the deal maker/breaker. I have just never seen any footage/gameplay of it in action (couldnt find anything on youtube). If anyone has an example, please share.
---
&gt;multi-PvP
---
&gt;outnumber
---
Dang, you're right.
---
Arguing sure is a lot easier whenever you pretend like people said things that they didn't, huh?
---
- Skill Shield Slam and improved Shield Bash
---
- Dispell a random selfbuff of a mage and silence him
---
- see him run around in confusion while you do absolutely no damage to him anyway
---
- ~~Profit~~ You die
---
lmao
---
The game will always be there in its state without the fear of your progress being wiped by an expansion. This benefits people with limited time as you don’t need to rush content and over a long stretch you could feasibly level every class to 60. It’s going to be a journey more than a destination.
---
You probably still have more time to play games as a student than you will in the future on a full time job. So don't be sad, take advantage of the free time you can spare :)
---
Maraudon is out phase 1
---
there's no realistic reason to play an enhancement shaman in pve.. it's not even fun. same goes for ret. both just auto attack. atleast with moonkin you're... spamming starfire. and look funny.... yeah no meme specs are fucking terrible
---
I will reroll. A new class makes le discover something new. You can always alt your old main class.
---
&gt; which are the two months people think of when they think of summer
---
That varies between different places. Where I am June/July/August are the summer months. And June is barely summer from a weather perspective (climate change has switched things up lately though).
---
900 iqueue*
---
The humps are when he tells you something like you should be xxx xp away from level up, if not grind until you are.
---
I just did some research
---
The 8 tank strat is still the most common
---
Pservers have the advantages of :
---
Having tons of warriors. Live Vanilla had gimp fury warriors for most patches. 1.12 doesn't. This has resulted   
---
in pservers having FAR more fury warriors in each raid. My guild in Vanilla had exactly 1. Most pserver guilds   
---
have 5-6
---
They know the fight ahead of time. T3 isn't "wasted" on Rogues during early Naxx progression.
---
You know that people that raid hc or mythics wont be in your raid finder right? Duing m0 dungeons and m+ weekles ward much higher gear than raid finder. People who go for raid finder are not the same people that raid
---
Not enough to matter, play what you like
---
Is turps going to be involved? I'd listen to it if he was.
---
It's how they sweat
---
MM &gt; Survival every Phase in the Game even in Naxx. Every gear check, every test so far confirms that. You can do a Repack Test aswell and see the results for yourself.
---
This.
---
Gah I knew someone would pick up on that! I meant after!
---
Psychic Scream every 30 seconds is a killer and I guess you missed the part:
---
&gt;Stuns have longer CDs than Fear, with Warlocks being able to spam it;
---
&gt; no noticeable input lag
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Where do you live? Inside their datacentre?
---
Wow thanks for testing it out! Even if my guild accept it i domt like to not be efficient too. I will play combat then. I was just tried to find an alternative that can be on same dps or at most ~5% worst
---
I guess I'm fine with healing in raids and taking some of the left over gear that I can use for feral. I can get some items in ZG and AQ20 anyway and the  I go do some wpvp. After all, I'm not even sure I will have too much time to raid having a 40+ hour week and an adult life after all :o
---
around 600%
---
After playing D&amp;D a bunch I started opting to roll for race, class, archetype, stats and sometimes even personality (was charts for this in Xanathar's Guide to Everything).
---
It's an interesting concept. I could live with it!
---
What roles are most wanted for 5man dungeons? I would assume tanks, but are healers also harder to find?
---
BRING BACK SLANIK! i remember listening to all episodes of vendor trash♥️
---
50 to 60 on vanilla around release was nasty. There were no quests so it was a straight up grind. I did 50-60 at the first farm in wpl. I spent 4 days there and it was about 6 to 10 hours each level on my rogue.
---
1 or 2%.
---
Nah people will still come here while flying or waiting for dungeon group.
---
6.9%. Non repeating, of course.
---
I hate STV so much... I've done it too many times, and too many competition / PvP going on there, you can't rely on it for questing !
---
You can never be certain if a bug/exploit/hack occurs and someone obtains Thunderfury at phase:1!
---
As the aspiring MT of my own guild, MTs then OTs will get Thunderfury. 
---
Then DPS Warriors and Rogues will be discussed. It's quite hard to get but we have a lot of alchemists so that's nice.
---
24 bosses vs 40 bosses (Legion) is definitely a difference.  I agree there.
---
And pvp isnt nearly as fleshed out... or good.
---
But the classic mmo feel- no time gated drip feed content. You can put as much time as you want doing things, farming, grinding, racing, casino, animal crossing, travel the world playing cards, etc.
---
Does cap your beast quest dailies, but that's about it, as far as I can think.
---
Atm, if I jump on bfa... do my 10, do my islands, do my weekly quest if it's a cache I care about and Raid. Then its kinda just more mythics for titanforging chances. It feels a lil like diablo, which is a good game... but I have diablo.
---
In which order would you put the dps and healer classes in likeness to get invited to pugs or guild runs?
---
Haha couldn't agree more xD
---
Only 29 days till "Only X amount of days until classic" posts end.
---
Hes talking about blizzards public image. Not software developer image lol.
---
I dont think we did. Maybe a private server you once ventured onto? :D
---
Where do you live? In 2016?
---
Down boy, eaaaassy. Make sure you get rest still, plenty of food and water as well. You don't want to get bloodclots by sitting for too long.
---
Tauren or Night Elf Druid?
---
To be honest as my life goes on the hype is settling down for me. The peak was the beta, after that it's just silence. How am I supposed to be hyped if I'm not sure there will be a gigantic launch?
---
Great constructive feedback there champ, keep it up!
---
Just wanna say that I see your comment and that you have my respect.
---
I hope good things come your way!
---
I mean it would be removed if it bugs and they will be banned otherwise so you can know.
---
AFAIK Nelfs have higher base Agility so they actually make better Dagger Rogues in PvE. Humans definitely win out with a sword spec by a couple percent. Remember though that you are going to be competing with Warriors and other Sword spec Rogues for weapons, so if you are one of the few Rogues in the raid using Daggers you'll have a much easier time getting weapon upgrades. 
---
All that being said, it probably won't make the difference between you getting a raid spot and you not getting a raid spot. It might make a difference if you are competing to be the best Rogue in your guild or on your server though.
---
Many who roll warrior will crumble beneath the challenge as their pathetic bodies collapse to the ground every 20 minutes. How will such weaklings ever hope to trade blow for blow with the likes of Ragnaros, or even Nefarian? Failure to take action will result in the deaths of those who depend on you. Will you rise to the challenge, or will you make way for someone more capable than yourself????
---
Nope never played on a private server
---
Basically baited/pranked
---
It's more like 50-60% with ALL quests and killing all mobs inside the instance.
---
What's the date for release again?
---
I wrote a huge wall of text but decided to keep it simple. I’m rolling a Druid this time around because of their versatility. I’m not bothered about the meters - i’m just gonna play what I enjoy to the best of my ability and if people have a problem with that then i’ll find other people to play with. 5 Druid RFC anyone?!
---
Yeah. Just when school starts. Horray...
---
HA, YOU THOUGHT. I ONLY EVER KILLED THEM OR SEND THEM PACKING WITH A BUBBLE HEARTH. THE LATTER IS MORE SATISFYING, HONESTLY
---
Literally doing this right this moment.
---
Seems like it should be the other way around with 5mans, no? Why the hell would you take a tank warrior to dps in your 5man?
---
Oof, someone took a piss in your morning coffee or something, I feel bad for you. Good luck today!
---
How could I forget?
---
GOOD TO HEAR
---
27th August
---
I’m infuriated that no one has mentioned Alterac Valley at all...
---
&lt;insert 3 man strategy&gt;
---
I would've just told you to put "unami" at the end of both "kits" and "kiss", and to then sound it out to hear the difference between the two.
---
that piss taste came from this guide not coffee bye
---
Are you asking about endgame or leveling? If you're asking about leveling, don't sweat it, anything can heal anything up until like, BRD or something.
---
They kill rag in 50 seconds. General strategy was that guilds needed to kill rag before the second submerge, or 6 minutes, and that took weeks for guilds to manage on our casual server.
---
So that video is running a smooth 6 times the damage of a normal guild at that content level in vanilla?
---
I mean they down some bosses in like 10 seconds. 
---
They skip a lot of mechanics that way, which means no target assignment, no strategy discussion, and, since they are over-geared, no loot distribution either.
---
That shit is whack yo
---
Nice observation
---
what does a typical raid schedule look like? i would like to do raids but i don't want to be up late at night playing or playing all day
---
What you gonna play
---
Hmmm weird!
---
ok rogues regardless how skilled always lose to hunters. unless they have impending doom with them, they have no chance
---
Classic won't be canceled, hahaahhaahha.
---
They wouldn't cancel the greatest game ever made? Cancel it like they did with the latest public stress test?
---
They wouldn't break a promise like "an all classic summer", would they?
---
0.0
---
Well it's pretty silly it be advertising a 3 man strategy when all your guides just have that place holder.
---
How much wood could an orc chuck if an orc could chuck wood?
---
I'm about 90% set on hunter. It was my first class back at launch and the nostalgia pull is heavy. Would surely be fun to try something new but I'm sure you know the feeling..
---
Yourself?
---
Raid 7 to 10pm twice a week (probs 3 for the transition to doing naxx in phase 6, though not 100% necessary )
---
Zg aq20 optional extras.
---
That is all.
---
I remember that. I hated the nightelfe zones when I was younger. But I liked playing a Nightelf Hunter (I stopped playing my dwarven hunter at 23) after I saw the Nightsabers the Elves were riding on. So I HAD to make a nightelf. I didnt want a damn stinky goat. But at level 1 or 2 I just felt like running with my nightelf to Dun Morogh. I loved that zone. So I went.. and quested.. and at level 10 I wanted to go to the trainer, tame my boar cat and bear then tame my own beasts. Little did I know I had to walk all the way back. And my hearthstone was already set to Kharanos. And I am not sure if there were no mages close by that wanted to create a portal for me but I remember being mad having to walk all the way back there. 
---
I was really unexperienced back then.. I mean, at level 12 I wanted to join those guys looking for a healer for gnomeragan (asking in general chat of dun morogh) And I whispered them that I could heal with bandages. Because I already got heavy linencloth bandages and some wool cloth. I was super serious back then. The guy took it with humor and explained me what a healer was. At the time I was still a bit unsure, because seriously. 1 heavy linencloth healed me to full. So it should heal them to full too right? Gosh. I was stupid and I loved it.

---
Considering that the dungeon difficulty in Classic will be drastically different than private servers, I think it’s best to wait until we have official servers. A lot of the information in the guide is acting as a placeholder and will be updated immediately. Just getting prepared for Classic and a head start on creating this “3 man dungeon meta”
---
Oh can you actually download them from willitclassic, too? I didn't know that.
---
In Eve Online there is a system where players leave named containers as gravestones when someone from their corporation (guild) dies in real life, there were probably more than a thousand containers floating in space with names dates and short messages.

Yeah maybe you're right. I definitely recall using one but I thought it was just on a private server!

Mage- people love polymorph and CC is bigly important in vanilla. 
---
Rogue
---

Hunter- really under appreciated CC and support because there were a lot of hunters and with large numbers you're going to have a lot of bad ones. But chainchai trapping is the most reliable CC in the game in and out of combat.
---
For me the worst part of leveling is 34-40ish.  After 40 I can get into Tanaris / ZF / Feralis which are all zones I love and I’m good all the way to 60 from there.

So why level an alt for that sweet rested xp? Do you intermittently level 2 levels worth?

---
I'm gonna be a complete beginner. I know nothing about WoW and I'm okay with that, but a friend who wants me to play said I should look at races and clans or something before creating a character because I have a tendency to make/pick a character/class and never truly branch out in MMOs. I'm not too sure how to even start asking questions. Is it really more complex than simply picking a class? If yea, where would I go to learn at least some basic knowledge on this? I wouldn't want help in picking a class or anything, I would just want to read a bit so I can make my own decisions.
---
Also, what is the 'end game' pve content like (dungeons, raids, whatever else there is)? Is it enough to hold someone's interest in the game beyond the first 5-6 clears?
---
A few hours per week sounds like all you have time to do is show up to raids and not play much outside of that. In that case, as a tank you'd basically be relying on your guild to farm all of your consumables for you, and you wouldn't be able to run people through dungeons and do the stuff that tanks can do to contribute to their guild. You'd show up for raids, leech resources off other players, do the raid, log off, rinse and repeat.  
---
I'd recommend joining a casual guild that doesn't require their DPS/healers to have consumables, and play a DPS or healer. Even casual guilds usually require their tanks to use consumables.
---
There's a video from vanilla that confirms this.
---
Its not really dungeon if it is outside.
---
Hijacking the thread, does anyone know a good 2-in-1 that can be gotten for around 300-400 (probably used/refurbished) that can run WoW classic as well as do other tasks easily?  
---
I have a desktop that I'll be playing on, but I want to pick up a thin laptop for doing schoolwork when traveling on the weekends.  It might as well run WoW too.
---
Is that for NA only?
---
I remember hating that my level 60 in Vanilla was a paladin. Think I’m going to do it again.
---
What are you are saying now directly contradicts what you said in your first point.
---
From a financial reporting perspective, yes, subscriber counts are grouped together. 
---
If classic didn't exist, then the hypothetical subscribers would not have resubbed. Hence, classic existing is attracting new subscribers that did not previously sub for retail.
---
Still 5s rule applies once your are done. Also NE &gt; human anyday. Both are trash compared to dwarf. But at least NE has some use in PvP.
---
Imagine telling yourself that 10spirit in mc and 15 in naxx was worth just better abilities.
---
I’m like 90% sure I’m rolling a Druid also... something inside of me telling me to go Warrior, Mage, or Rogue instead occasionally.  Will probably just role one or two of those as alts at some point.
---
Great. One month to decide which healer I'm gonna play. I started in WotLK so not sure. And everyone gives different advice :(
---
Wont be a thing until all bots hit 60.
---
This question should definitely be on the bingo list
---
True, in that 1 second extra castime you are regening outside of 5 sec thus its not time wasted.
---
It's a tradeoff. PvP can change things quite dramatically, having to watch your back a lot and just generally being more aware and prepared out in the wild. 
---
But bare in mind you're most likely going to face repeatedly being one-shot or stunlocked and killed whilst trying to go about your business. Most players won't engage unless they think they can win or kill you outright. It only really becomes fun once you get to 60 and get some decent gear because then you can start defending yourself.
---
He changed it but you should still take his advice :P
---
I STILL CAN’T DECIDE
---
Actually, I live in 2019, you know, the year where latency is still a thing and has been a permanent obstacle for gaming streaming services ever since OnLive. The very noticeable quadrupling (give or take) of latency by using these services is not going away until we figure out how to make light move faster or build datacentres in our backyards.

The bitrate is often terrible aswell and makes it look like I'm watching youtube.

I'm about 90% Shaman myself, simply love the class. Then there's 10% rogue, because I know I'd straight up love the PvP aspect of it while levelling.
---
God I was being facetious
---
False.
---
The loot system rolls between all participants and if it picks someone who’s already loot locked for the boss, it just means one less piece of loot for the entire group.
---
i think there will be a huge amount of complaints threads.  disconnects/lag/layering/trolling/griefing
---
&gt;better and more challenging encounter 
---
Better can be arguable, but more mechanics clearly make it more challenging..
---
Also, why even include the '[Unpopular Opinion]' bs.. Just post without it.
---
That’s not a hump. That just covers the differences that occur, for example quests that require item drops that aren’t guaranteed. Sometimes you kill 5 boars and get all 5 hooves, sometimes you kill 20 and are still missing one. With that volume of people following the guide, someone is going to get lucky and finish those early.
---
Yeah I know, was just talking on how our guild processes the order in case we get multiple bindings. The proc does a shitload of threat and since I'd like 1 OT to be Prot and 1 Feral, if we *do* get lucky as hell, we could get a fury or rogue one of them.
---
It’s not necessarily the only sign of a good boss encounter, but in my opinion, the boss encounters are definitely the one place they have improved the game.  Honestly, I think it’s the only place.  I’ll take complex encounters with learning curves where I feel a real sense of accomplishment for downing them over tank and spank encounters for an entire raid tier if given the option.  
---
I’ll still take Vanilla over Current WoW 100 times out of 100, but it’d be disingenuous of me if I bashed current WoW’s raid mechanics and praised vanilla’s.

I am sorry, but if you don't think Azshara is a more challenging encounter than Ragnaros, you're just willfully ignorant.

Depends on the prices of the mats of course. You can check what items disenchant into online.

Being memorable more than anything makes a good encounter for me, regardless of mechanics

Yes, but still you have to start with your favorite class ;-).

You could buy a character (account) that already has TF. Then change realm/name if possible.

Contrary to belief it's actually harder to join a 5 man dungeon group as a healer then a dps at lvl 60. Most groups won't even bother forming unless they have a healer or tank and you only need one of each, whereas you need 3 dps. When I played healer and would sit in chat waiting for a group to form they almost always formed around a healer and we're just looking for 1-2 dps and a tank. That all being said if you're a healer and form a group for a 5 man your golden. Raids are a different story, you will always be very high in demand since they need multiple healers.
---
Plug in baby. Yea I was one of the Drakedog’s follower.

That is so up to you what you prefer but I love the wpvp so much and having it when lvling makes for so much fun. Yes you get ganked but for me so worth it for the overall excitement. Pvp whilst lvling is one of my favorite parts of the game.

---
I wholeheartedly disagree.
---
I love complex, unique and also weird encounters. Alysrazor in Firelands for example was awesome, having to fly through those rings as a Ranged DPS or fighting a wholly different fight on the ground.
---
I'll be fine with the Classic mechanics as there are more than enough other reasons to play than fun bosses, but I prefer complex encounters to tank and spank.
---
My favorite thing about retail raids is that it feels more like an elite squad of people *damn* good at taking down bosses. 
---
Obviously I feel like retail has lost all of the RPG elements that made me fall in love with WoW, but I think boss fights have only gotten better with time
---
Exactly, that's what I thought also. Hm tough decision.
---
From what I have read, WOD suffered from lack of content. 
---
Cataclysm was a mixed bag of game designs that sucked the life of the expansion coupled with lack of content and stuff to do. 
---
The launch was crap. Having to spend 4 hours to clear heroic Deadminea and Grim Batol. The Zul Dungeons were even worse ans having to run th the same 2 dungeons for months on end. Firelands was okay but then they just threw everything out with Dragon Soul and the End Time dungeons. 
---
WOD saw garrisons for example and free gold. The questing I read was pretty good.
---
Give these two links a read. A friend of mine has never played and these seemed to help him on a direction on classes.

---
https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/news/what-class-you-should-pick/
---
In the end though, these are informational and you should pick a class that you feel you would enjoy.
---
And on your second question, after I've reached a point of raiding it's hard to lose interest in a raid (so quickly) after you've put the effort into gearing and preparing for it.
---
The over-designed crop of modern bosses are a consequence of the devs abandoning resource management as a challenge (which happened around Cataclysm), requiring raid teams to be outright killed by boss mechanics since they no longer run out of steam. 
---
BWL-era healers would OOM themselves after like 5 casts if they didn't obey the 5 second rule, ranged DPS would often be reduced to wanding/auto-attacking. As a result, over time, the raid would die through lack of healing power, adds not being killed, etc.
---
More mechanics *do* add difficulty - the difference is, to create a difficult encounter in 2019 requires vastly more mechanics than were required in vanilla and TBC.
---
Having encounters be difficult because of the sheer amount of people to coordinate just seems like artificial difficulty which really isn't that engaging.
---
Eh, streamers can make or break game launches, Fortnite, PUBG, and Apex Legends being the most popular examples. It probably wouldn’t work for wow, but it is a pretty good marketing tactic.
---
AV won’t be out for quite a while

PvP unless you're absolutely terrible at defending yourself in PvP. Ultimately, only you can answer the question of if you're incapable of dealing with player conflict or not.
---
If we were talking about a competitive Shooter like CS:GO or anything I'd be with you.
---
But this is Classic Wow. People dont need to worry about having 50ms ish ping here.
---
But you have have half the raid basically immune to the fear... It only matters for tanks, but non-feared dps can still dps.
---
In my experience..that's what happens when you really love your main. I am a notorious altoholic and many of them have taken the title of "main" away during my wow years
---
Which I mentioned as being a difference too small to worry about.

---
Jesus, of course his anecdote doesn’t prove there’s an untapped market of millions of potential players who don’t know about Classic WoW, but it’s a bit of a addition to the point that not everyone who would be interested in the old style of RPG that Classic offers is aware that it even exists. You would only know if it’s existance if you actively followed Warcraft-related content and content-creators
---
in normal combat build where you take weapon skill talents too its not big of a difference. Humans usually only take 1 point there since glancing caps at 308 weaponskill but that extra talent spend elsewhere is not gonna change much. No human ever beat me in vanilla because i was a nelf. But it is beneficial in seal fate sword builds since you cant take weapon skill talents from combat tree, so human 5 skill is more important there. Obviously you dont need ever to run seal fate but if you wanted, you'd probably want human there if you wanted to run it.
---
I started a human druid, walked east (I think) and found a wolf and marshal McBride.
---
After I killed the wolf there was nothing there any more. So no looting the corpse and McBride was gone. Even if I walked away and came back.
---

---
Wouldn't a small group encounter (e.g. a difficult 5-man, if they ever were to make something like that) be a better and more challenging encounter, since everybody has to be on point and would be no way to carry anybody?
---
This is pretty accurate, but remember that loot competition is often an even bigger factor. The group leader probably doesn't want anyone that'll roll against him if he can help it.

They were minimal back then or too hard.

due to all the bugs on beta you should roll a different class, if its your first time as a hunter you'll have a hard time
---
tbh if youre not playing on a large ibm (ps/2) keyboard and a rubberball mouse, while sitting on a terrible chair in the living room in front of a 15" CRT and a beige desktop, then you aren't playing this game correctly.
---
Also, make sure you are using ALL the addons (at *least* 3 raidframes. For redundancy, ofc.*)* and run the game in 640x480 with minimal viewing distance for the optimal 2004 gaming experience.

---
Everyone here is going to pull too much or too little aggro on vael and wipe their raid before they go right back to posting about how easy vael is because it has so few mechanics. Some mechanics are harder than others, and 'don't stand in the bad' became a meme because it's the easiest of all. Then they started building the game around it.

Spirit Tap, imo, is even more important than the wand talent. The increased regen is...just incredible

What guild would give an untested player Hand of Rag prio as a *signing bonus*? You're not even a high quality acquisition as an enhancement shaman, so you have no chips to bargain with.

That item will generally go to the most dedicated player in the guild that can use it. Worry about being that, first.
---
&gt; private servers
---
&gt; "legit"
---
It happened during Vanilla aswell, Im sure, but the chance for that is non existant.
---
While I don't really agree with what you're saying in the OP, I do agree with your overall point, I definitely prefer boss battles with fewer mechanics, but where those mechanics are more involved and utilized in interesting ways. 
---
I don't think Vanilla did this though, but there was a sweetspot around Wrath-mid Cata where encounter design was at its best, I think raids like Ulduar and Firelands are the kind of raids they should use as benchmarks. Sometime after that it began feeling like they just threw a lot of abilities on bosses just for the sake of it, even if they had nothing to do with the fight's core mechanic, it just feels like clutter for the sake of having it.
---
So, will you be healing until phase 3? as to build status in the guild? 
---
Because as I understand it, neither Nightfall nor Sulfuras will be in Classic before phase 3, which I can see being 8 months away, give or take. 
---
Tbh, anyone who have put in the work, and have the mats ready for the mace, should get to roll on it.
---
That’s such a trip.
---
Well first things first if you are trying to get HOR your gonna need a fairly hardcore guid and enhance is not a desirable spec for hardcore raidgroups. Enhance is a bad nightfall bot, They have bad uptime, your dps is bad and improved totems is like a 7 dps increase for each melee in your group so its hard to make an argument for that too.
---
That being said HOR sucks for everybody in a raid setting, its all for pvp offspecs, so the person who gets it should be the most helpful, polite, dedicated member/officer you have who wants it for pvp offspec. The guy making spec suggestions, helping people run dungeons for gear, the guy who loaned some gold out to help with epic mounts, whos making spreadsheets to help guildies level, the guy who never misses a raid, is always on time with enough consumables for himself and maybe enough to help out sombody who forgot some.
---
Maybe for a casual?

I think m+ is the best improvement made. Boss fights are definitely better but m+ dungeons are one of the only things added after classic that I could say l am genuinely disappointed didn’t exist in classic. Wouldn’t want to see them added though, it’s just a cool system that would have made for interesting horizontal progression in a world where wow didnt expand with 10 new levels and a new continent every few years.

I found the effect number through Classic Wowhead, which I punched in to the "spell effects" table in the datamine, and looking at Field_1_13_2_30073_008 it shows a value of 0. A spell like Smite, for example, shows a value of 0.71, which indicates its coefficient (which is known to be 71%).

How the hell do I pre-download Classic? I don't have WoW installed (unsubbed sinced WotLK only PServers) so there's no box that you guys talks about to select "Classic", only "Install" which obviously means I am installing the whole BfA which I don't want. Any help?
---
Saying you will only join a guild that would give it to you first. I think that is your first problem. You don't just get given stuff in guilds (not the good ones at least). You have to EARN IT!
---
Farm herbs for consumables, donate them to the guild bank (aka the alt of the guild leader or an officer), help other guildies when they ask for help (Hey guys, I need a BRD run for my Molten Core/Onyxia attunement, anyone able to help?.. and you being the first or one of the first to say yes). Be a team player.
---
Guilds tend to choose people for (insert item here) who it would be best for, for the guild.. or those who help others the most. As a mage, after Dire Maul came out and I did the quest for the new top teir water, and it is summoned only 2 at a time.. I would show up to raids 1hr+ early and just start summoning water (as I was the only mage of the 7-8 mages in any raid that would make water for anyone but themself). Guild leader and officers saw this effort and every time I did this, I got bonus DKP.. Therefore, I got geared up faster than the other mages. I also picked and chose what item I wanted rather than doing bid wars against other mages because (insert item here) looked "cool".
---
Or, just create your own guild, and you being guild leader, decide that you would be best suited to get the item.
---
Waiting for a group as a tank/healer is weird. I never considered it as an option. Make your own and you're good to go within minutes.

I disagree, you really need to engage with other people, which is what MMOs are about

- I made this based on my being an orc hunter, so in the base sheet stats I plugged in the base agility and crit chance of a naked hunter. If I were to improve the sheet, I would make it possible to change race on a whim.

---
started when I was 10 and played HC for 5 years! This is great news for me
---
I'm sorry that you feel that way. Those were my real thoughts and I firmly stand beside them. The PVE aspect of the game nowadays is just not as good as it was back then. I am free to share these thoughts just as you're free to disagree with them. Hence why I wrote "unpopular", because I know most of you think like you do and feel that modern WoW is better in every way.
---
Yet here we are, 15 years later, waiting for the re-release of arguably the best game there ever was, and ever will be :).
---
Leveled druid 15 times, I am coming back baby !!!
---
You guys are literally arguing about nothing and the whole thing is stupid.
---
I don't think a boss fight such as the current Azshara with all the hundreds of things going on is a better and more   
---
challenging encounter than, say, Ragnaros, Onyxia 
---
This is hilariously untrue. You think you need to work together with 39 other people to defeat these bosses, first of all?
---
There are so many valid things you could argue vanilla was better than retail on, but challenging boss fighs ain't it chief
---
I’m pretty sure you don’t have to make a new account to switch regions, just change your region in the launcher. Ping might suck though
---
Please see your other post about this..
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/civ51d/sulfuras_as_an_enhance_shaman/
---
Or in situations where a tank isn't tanking, wars make better NFbots due to their ability to spam HS. You might get a chance to use a real DPS wep on fights where fewer tanks are needed.
---
Helps you know who to avoid, win / win
---
People make pvp servers out to be worse than they actually are. I started late on a pvp server and never felt totally hindered by random higher levels ganking me. It happens sometimes, but its not going to be at "10k pop private server where theres nothing left to do but gank" levels. Roll pvp, you wont be disappointed.
---
I’ve been gladiator as an enhance shaman if that’s not a high quality acquisition than damn guess I just suck
---
Stay in Europe bro
---
PvP. The alternative is unthinkable.
---
Tbh I didn’t think anyone would reply to the other one
---
Wow, the replies to this post are hella toxic. Ya'll need Jesus.
---
Just give it time. One of the good things about vanilla was that they didn't fuck up the leveling experience to get people to the end game quickly. Your friends can still join after launch. Maybe they get some vacation, try it out and realize they can have fun with just a few hours a week.
---
This isn’t unpopular, it’s completely wrong and stupid. Vanilla raiding was fucking EASY, people are going to be very disappointed how much of a step down raiding is in classic. MC could very well be cleared in the first week of release by one of the no life guilds that doesn’t sleep.
---
Enhance has the best nightfall uptime with flurry that’s not some bullshit I’m spewing to get HOR it’s a proven fact
---
Thanks a bunch. That's what I found online as well.
---
Are there different launchers depending on the region you're in? As in an US and an EU launcher? Or is that rather universal?
---
Fuck. It was supposed to be 4, no idea how I messed that up. 
---
Though to be fair even 4 is low-balling it, I guess more like half a year until you first step into MC.
---
&gt; I would only want to join a guild that would give me priority for sulfuras.
---
You could be one of the top 10 dps warriors in the world, but if you were to try to join my guild with that attitude I would kindly ask you to fuck off.
---
Noone is going to prio anything to some random guy, let alone an enh sham rofl...
---
;) survival &gt; marksman
---
The thing is though, you can’t meaningfully engage with 39 people whereas you can with 4-9 other people. I think the reduced raid size was a much better choice for the game in the long run and it also meant they could trim the fat and make raid encounters require more precision and focus.
---
Can you link where nightfall isn’t available phase 1? This is actually news to me
---
You can play any region using the files, but your account is bound to region due to subscription.  
---
The other games are universal accounts and not comparable.
---
I have only calculated the 100 AP as affecting the hunter and its pet, so the benefit of TSA is set to be as conservative as possible.
---
I have been planning on doing similar sheets for both fury warriors and rogues, but my knowledge of those classes pale in comparison to my knowledge of hunters, so I felt like the best to do for now was to just count it as a personal +100 AP.
---
pre-raid is rare, not epic.
---
Definitely possible - in multiple ways too. So depends on what you wanna heal, what you wanna solo, etc. And of course it depends on whether you mean for leveling or at max level. 
---
Druids, for example can AoE farm pretty decently, no matter the spec. Even full resto. But they can also have options to spec either fairly deeply into balance or feral, while still getting essential resto talents, which would make solo- target farming easier :) 
---
Shamans got ele/resto hybrid - BIG burst damage there, great for PVP too. 
---
Priest can just go with into wand and be just fine, they can farm DM:E with just holy nova, etc. 
---
So it depends on how you prefer to solo-play :)
---
TIL vanilla had arenas
---
Ahh yes, I’d almost forgotten that WoW has a subscription. It’s been too long.
---
Trying to have the game cater to everyone is what fucked up retail wow in the first place, and people are already coming in trying to make classic into retail.
---
Take a look at the Oldscool Runescape Community, they know exactly how this shit ends, and they're smart enough to stamp it out as early as possible every time.
---
&gt;In other words, I don't think a boss fight such as the current Azshara with all the hundreds of things going on is a better and more challenging encounter than, say, Ragnaros, Onyxia or the Four Horsemen.
---
Azashara has less going on than it looks. The main difficulty comes from its many phases and execution through the RNG elements that come out. Of course there are DPS checks as well. As a capstone fight it encapsulates all three major systems you use when creating boss encounters.
---
Mechnics, DPS/HPS Check, Execution. Most of the time in classic we get one of these as the thing that must be done. While it starts to ramp up later in the expansion overall. Looking at a game like FFXIV raid, it uses all three for its harder content as well.
---
Personally, i think the middle ground is where i like to raid but there are people that want to have those big three and not only those big three but they add on to it the lowest possible item level to that raid. 
---
While herding 39 other people in Classic is part of the challenge keep in mind that these people who raid mythic love the dance and checks. The whole game for them revolves around doing the most difficult thing. Like people that like bullet hell games or always play on the hardest setting possible as soon as the game comes out.
---
In reality i dont think your opinion is unpopular, just look at the fact the LFR is as popular as it is or the actual numbers of people doing far harder content when it arrives, that is to say while its still relevant or at the item level it was devised at.
---
Enhance actually has horrible Nightfall uptime. Highest Nightfall uptime is a Hunter spamming r1 wingclip or OT Warrior spamming Hamstring.
---
Your account details says something like:
---
World of Warcraft® (xxx)   
---
**Europe**   
---
Starter Edition   
---
Account Status
---
This means you can only access EU realms, you would need a second account for NA and select it in the dropdown options before you start the game.
---
I’m just gonna run black smithing / mining until I get the hammer tbh. I’ll do the rep grind I’m not gonna rely on anyone else for that cuz I understand it’s an enormous pain in the ass. Thank you for the info.
---
He was talking about Black Desert Online
---
HUNTERS HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN A CROSSBOW IN NAXX. THEY ARE TAKING SUCH A DIVE THAT IT WOULD MAKE FELIX BAUMGARTNER RUN AWAY WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN  LEGS
---
It's in the blizzard launcher. I think you need an active subscription to see it.
---
Classic PvE is simple for all classes. I was talking about PvE :(
---
Good answer. I'm glad to see that not everyone around here has forgotten how difficult it was obtaining certain items.
---
https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY
---
There u go
---
Savior!! It goes smth like this: nanan what de colors of her eyes were nanana and this is how she gottem nananaaaa
---
Yea it's a shame it's not just one sub for all regions priced on where you're from but there we go..  :(
---
wat
---
I’ll concede your right but those two classes doing that Bears the burden of providing essentially no dps outside of utility
---
It depends on what you want to do and how hardcore you want to be. 
---
PvE hard core raiding is going to pidgen hole you hard. Every raid takes at least 1 of each class, but if you're Priest you won't be shadow (most likely). If you're shaman, you'll be healing. 
---
In PvP some other specs/classes shine. Warlock isn't great for raid dps, but the survivability makes them great in PvP especially 1 on 1s. Elemental Shaman isn't a great PvE spec but it's a great PvP spec.
---
Boomkin isn't a great spec for anything. Feral druids can tank some stuff, but Warriors are commonly preferred. Druids can also heal, but again they aren't preferred usually. 
---
Every class can kick ass in 5 man dungeons and PUG BG's if you're decent though. If you're casual, I wouldn't worry about how viable anything you do is because everything can be viable enough to have fun. 
---
If you want to hardcore raid, I'd do some research on what specs and classes are optimal and which ones of those sound fun to you.
---
I think you should delete this post.
---
NO MAIN, 3 ALTS. EASY.
---
And you wouldnt call that a non existing chance?
---
Fredsstonedflintstones, would that be copyrighted?
---
AND THEY STOLE IT FROM R/NFL
---
Enhance provides no dps outside of minor utility.
---
My husband has an active sub and doesn’t see it either. But I do. It’s weird
---
2-3 nights a week, 3-4 hours a night.
---
When I played (quit after Cata), a lot of NA guilds (not all) started raids at 7pm EST. Which makes it hard for someone like myself on the west coast, who may not even get off work until 5pm PST (8pm EST). 
---
And if you work a swing shift or night shift, it makes it almost impossible to find a raiding guild that will take you in as a raider.
---
&gt;Otherwise, having people suddenly vanish and appear all around you, sometimes even mid-fight like in gurubashi, is gonna feel so weird
---
They said that people won't disappear around you. 
---
You'll be able to see and interact with anyone in your group regardless of which instance you're in. 
---
Layering will probably only be turned on when the population is so high that there would have been a login queue in classic. 
---
It's not perfect, but it beats having to wait for two hours to get on and play.
---
That is weird. Hopefully it gets fixed closer to the launch.
---
I used to share a battle net account with several people, we had over 5 active wow accounts at a time and shared them all the time. It became a problem when your real name got associated with the account and we asked blizzard to split the accounts. However blizzard made sure to tell us it is what it is and we won't help you (essentially telling us they don't care about acc sharing)
---
It's pretty shit until you get a soul bag which won't be for a while and maybe not until you're 60. 
---
At 60 with soul bags it's really not that bad. Raiding sucks because you have to really load up before hand and going into PvP you'll want extras as well. 
---
As far as dungeons or leveling I usually only keep about 5-10 on me at all times. You only need 1 for SS, 1 for Healthstone (per person) and then a couple for demon summons if you need. If you use one, you're already killing mobs your level so just grab a new one next mob. No one in 5 mans will be upset if you sacrifice dps for a mob here and there to grab soul shards. 
---
Raids and PvP are the only time you need to completely stock up, because there's less mobs in raids to farm shards and in PvP you don't want to be wasting possible dps by drain souling for soul shards.
---
It’s still the same class you just get kited to oblivion more often. Unless the person I’m going against is top tier I’m probably still going to win that fight 9/10 times.
---
Why would you get Night Elf? Shadowmeld? When you go kitty form, you get a stealth that is much better. Tauren, you get a stomp that can stun enemies and do a little damage (thus, breaking stealth of those enemies around you).
---
I think the answer is obvious :)
---
Makes sense, it is quite a lot of work. I did do some simplified calculations once with fury warriors and found that MM was simply superior even with Naxx gear. Fury warrior simply scale so much that adding AP to four of them far out DPS the personal damage boost you could get from LR. The simplifications were mostly done so as to not favour MM, as I initially had the same thoughts as you - that SV simply isn't as good as people make it out to be. While it was simplified calculations, they do add to the whole belief that MM might be better no matter the gear. Still, they were quite simplified since I was lazy, so I won't take them as 100% facts.
---
And just for the record, most people that say SV is better once you get X agility have wildly wrong assumptions. Like, I've seen so many downright laughable "calculations", even people totally ignoring all other talents and just calculated the AP breakpoint for LR compared to TSA. The truth is, the *vast* majority of theory crafters in WoW suck at it. They make either wrong calculations or wrong assumptions. Not to be a dick, but there is a reason why most educations revolving around math takes at least 5 years to complete at a university.
---
How does it work for you?
---
People complaining about layering don't remember that there were login queues in classic. 
---
The zones weren't so overcrowded that it was unplayable because they only let a certain number of characters on each server at once. 
---
Either we have to deal with login queues or layering or the starting areas will be unplayable at launch. There's no perfect solution.
---
Are there any alch only consumables? Or is everything purchasable? Deciding on alch or just double gatherer.
---
Balanced in some ways, imbalanced in others. Played well almost any class shines in pve or pvp, but certain talent builds are lackluster at different things. If you want to tank warrior is the clear top pick at end game, but druid as bear is very good for the entire 1-60. If dps, rogue and mage were the standards, warrior is strong. Warlock is a fun class that also brings utility to raids. Paladins heal at end game primarily, and are said to be quite boring while leveling up. Great healers though. If you want to pvp nearly any class stands out played well, but mage and warlock tend to do well against most other classes in general.
---
Makes sense though, streaming in 1080 isn't demanding on bandwidth
---
Layers are just world instances, not servers... How is this hard to understand? 
---
Layers only open up when the population is too high, they aren't permanent. 
---
This community is deliberately misstating the way they work in order to rage about them
---
On the contrary. Considering "It happened during Vanilla aswell" means all raids worldwide during all Vanilla, I think it actually happened many times.
---
Skarm disagrees with you and says that shamans have the worst uptime on Nightfall.
---
Warriors are the best, but they lose a lot of dps doing it. 
---
He ranks the 4 classes which can use Nightfall like this:
---
1. Warrior 
---
2. Hunter
---
3. Paladin 
---
4. Shaman
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLe0U4KbavE starts talking about it at 4:36, he goes into details at 6:10
---
Oh no you misunderstand me, i did this back when i was ''little me''. As in about 12-14 years old playing vanilla.
---
Not before Naxx.
---
People don't need realism to have fun. I don't know why this is a hard thing for ppl to grasp. I get it, i don't bloody want to play one either, but all the power to those that do. It's a game, not a job about minmaxxing.
---
The racials were total not base on classic, base is from pservers
---
It’s no coincidence that Slipknot is releasing a new album right before Classic wow release.
---
Fair enough. But enhance with nightfall brings a lot more to the table than a wing clipping hunter. I’ll admit an off tanking warrior with nightfall is definitely viable and I would encourage it but he can’t do that every fight consistently. But a shaman with proper totem management is indispensable. If you can play with nightfall and totem twist, ya your dps sucks, but if your in the melee party doing that the warriors/rogues are gaining insane dps because of you.
---
Went feral tank in vanilla and plan to do the same in Classic. Most of the time I let a warrior tank I was disappointed. I'm not saying all warrior tanks are bad, I've met some great ones, just seems when some think they can tank they do a poor job. Me and my spouse, which played Hunter, were sought after to take people through the 45 minute Baron runs.
---
Woa. I have, and yet i somehow forgot what fickle and vulnerable ppl private server plays can be.
---
Oh I dont doubt that, but Im not even sure if that even happened in each region.
---
Ah i see, alright. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I think it boils down to the fact that survival scales better with agility than MM, *which is true*, but according to my calcs, if you had full world/raid buffs, BIS and the whole shabang, even adding an additional 400 agility on top of that would not make survival come out on top. To be fair though, making correct calculations for how much dps you gain from Imp. Aspect of the Hawk is downright impossible in a program like Excel, and would require you to be able to run actual simulations, but you are sacrificing so much for 15% agility, 3% crit and 3% hit (which is not needed once you get raid gear really).
---
I guess that there might be some saving grace for Survival once you get really good at weaving in Raptor Strike due to the +20% crit chance you get, but at that point the comparison it only really useful for Patchwerk and no other fight at all.
---
3-4%, just enough to be noticeable. You’ll always struggle to keep up with Human Rogues on the charts. The only way around this is to go dagger spec which does more dps anyway.
---
I figured that was what was meant, but thought to ask to be sure. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I simply just enjoy it. I'm not aiming for the next lvl, I'm aiming for the quests, gear and gold grind when I find a good spot. I'm a world PvPer and the situations one gets into while levling, especially around lvl 45,which is my favorite lvl overall, are priceless. Yes, it slows my levling significantly but I'm having such a great time I don't notice because time flies.
---
You mean Smelt Elementium.
---
Also the elementium ore itself only drops from trash mobs in BWL
---
I've made a fair bit of gold by making the sulfuron hammer and selling it on AH over the years (since MC became soloable).  Even today, its pretty rough putting those mats together.  Usually the bottleneck is the blood of the mountain.  There was a point in cataclysm when arcane crystals were selling for about 5-20g a pop, and I'd buy them all from the AH from my phone (when you could work the AH using the app).  Then I'd transmute the arcanite on my transmute spec alchemist, ahhh the good ole days.
---
Streamers will get it. Payo will get it for sure, he can easily pug MC every week.
---
Blizzard used to officially announce their subscriber counts. They stopped during Warlords of Draenor when they began to realize they would never recover. [Here's a chart](https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2015/08/wow-subscriptions-historical-2005-2015.png) showing those reported numbers.[ Here's a statistical estimate] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/) that seems to back the official numbers up. At the start of TBC, there are above 7.5 mil subs, by Wrath that number is closer to 12.5 mil.
---
Priest shaman mage rogue are by far the most wanted classes
---
Yeah, Thunderfury is strictly a warrior tank weapon in vanilla, not only because it's so hard to get, but because the proc on it generates a shitload of threat, which is good for a tank...and bad for DPS.
---
Placebo effect ftw!
---
Ironically the hardcore guilds raid like 3h a week
---
[Here is a picture of the comparison](https://imgur.com/gL23McU)
---
Excellent news! I just wish TB was still around :\[ That woulda been so enjoyable. May just give the old eps a listen.
---
Go human fpr that sword bonus
---
If your joining a random guild very unlikely, you could make the case for it if you had the gold to craft it but its insanely expensive. Usually 8kish gold
---
Are mechanical crowd pummelers crucial for bear tanking? Or can I get away with something like staff of the warden? I hate the idea of farming gnomergan constantly.
---
I never really have trouble with 40-50. I usually do:
---
-lower STV
---
-Feralas
---
-Tanaris
---
-Hinterlands
---
with a handful of Zul'Farrak runs.
---
Lifetime Druid here. I’m going to the dark side and being a lock.
---
Makes me wonder how many of those we’ve lost that would love to come back for classic.
---
What? Hunter has by far the best uptime followed by warrior
---
Both solid choices, I'm going priest myself
---
Shrine of the fallen warrior is the first one I ever found. Of course I had to research it when I found it. I thought that was really cool that they did things like that.
---
15% agility is a huge game changer once you hit a certain level. I forget what it is, but it begins to tilt in favor of survival with 20 points in marks.  
---
Also if you’re pvping then deep survival with scatter is better than deep marksman
---
I'm hoping to raid/PvP as Shadow, but I'm planning on healing 5-mans and stuff for my group of friends. I realise I will end up healing in raids to start (And I'm fine/excited to do that), but I'm hoping to eventually switch to Shadow full time (I'll recruit a bunch of Warlocks if I have to).
---
Oh come on, nobody cares about the no-lifer guilds where everyone plays 50+ hours a week. They make up a vanishingly small portion of raiding guilds.
---
No, the bindings drop chance is the limiting factor.  
---
Getting 100 arcanite bars is pretty trivial, albeit time consuming.
---
Wait til you are hitting 50... Ow... it really starts to slide down the ol' Hill then...
---
Vanilla was built that at lvl 55 you group and do dungeons/group quests until 60 so it makes sense the easy solo quests dwindle out.
---
lol
---
What classified as a “good” guild. I’m going to be joining a guild that is definitely in the middle of the pack when it comes to severity.
---
melee hunter
---
I was always a healer on my paladin or shaman and all I did was dungeon grind through 40-50 same with 50-60 for the most part. Best thing I did was make the rod in Mara and did princess runs nonstop
---
Didn't you hear the man? He's certain.
---
Ok cool, thanks
---
Well that's better than we usually do......
---
Awful 
---
Meh
---
Incredible
---
No hunter is running r1 wingclip juat to nightfall proc. Yes you are technically right I completely concede, but in reality no guild has one of those. And no hunter will play that role when classic comes out.
---
If you cook it, most meat and fish gain 5 to 10 levels, and they eat it again ;-)
---
Some people do.
---
[https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/35103-elunes-disciple-33117-night-elf-priest/](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/35103-elunes-disciple-33117-night-elf-priest/)
---
Yeah I am not criticizing it, it's just the way it is. It becomes more difficult/time consuming due to harder quests and need to group up.
---
You can do 5 mans as shadow priest and still heal. You wont really need to respec until raids.
---
Another fun fact no one has mentioned is that counting on that drop is dumb. Our guild cleared every week in vanilla and never got one.
---
Lol at the "I'm just going to create my own guild capable of farming this item!" edit.
---
If you don't think Azshara is more challenging than Rag, Ony and 4 horsemen, you're stupid, plain and simple.
---
Now "Better" is too vague a term to use, since for some, a better encounter is the more fun encounter, for others it's the harder encounter.
---
You still go deep shadow, you just respec at 40 if you want shadowform over want spec, otherwise you could just continue and get shadowform at 45ish.
---
The problem is that these arguments are only good enough to convince yourself, but not the raid leaders wishing their raid to perform it's best. 
---
This game is 15 years old, everything related is already theorycrafted and well-known and generally, it is not in meme spec favor. 
---
It does not mean that you can't raid as enhance, you will just have to find a community pursuing different goals, like a guild run by friends or just casual folks. If you manage to find such a guild and convince that Sulfuras should belong to you because of different reasons they would find acceptable, then you're good.
---
The world needs more people like you tbh. I'm sure they both appreciate everything you do. Keep it up.
---
It's the same as mythic in retail
---
Most of these replies aren’t answering your question.
---
If it’s anything like vanilla and pservers, guilds will find it harder to recruit the desired number of shaman than priests.
---
It sure helps a lot. It allows you to still upfront nuke. Mind blast, sw:p, wand.
---
Its not as noticeable at early levels, since early regen still is quite strong.
---
I love tanaris. My favourite zone by far.
---
Agreed, I’d step back and look at it from a playstyle perspective.  Make a decision based on what you want to play rather than what you think or others say will be desired more because neither of those specs/classes are going to be left out.
---
After AQ40 mages destroy priests 1v1
---
With imp  CS spec it’s not even fair
---
In current meta. Spriests really are not as good as people remember
---
They have two direct damaging attacks and one dot.
---
If they got locked it’s game over
---
Mages can do this 4-5k dmg in 3 globals
---
I raided as shadow in tbc. I could have done it in vanilla, too, but I like healing. Getting a shadow spot isn't impossible but...I'll be honest, shadow is great in duels and in random pug bgs; in premade bgs its lackluster (you will get focused down), and in raids its kinda boring.
---
He's going to start off with the Old Blunderbuss(1.52 dps) and unless you can find an engineer early enough to make a Rough Boomstick(4.13 dps) you should probably just buy a Ornate Blunderbuss(2.95 dps) from any of these vendors [LINK](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2509/ornate-blunderbuss). Then his first quest Gun will be Daryl's hunting Rifle(6.40 dps)  in Loch Modan from this [QUEST](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=257/a-hunters-boast) at level 11 ;)
---
No hunter is gonna spam r1 nightfall in a raid. Find me one when classic launches in a legit progression guild and I’ll delete my account.
---
My onæy problem is that wonterspring is dark and EPL is white as snow 😅👌
---
any time youre getting world buffs and full consumables youll need pummelers basically
---
Thanks for this, very handy!
---
Reminds me of a story about a guild that had a valued member pass away in real life. They held an in game funeral that was sabotaged by the enemy faction even after extensive attempts to inform them what was going on.
---
Tanking was a lot fucking harder in classic than in any later version of the game. 
---
Threat management was such a problem if there was more than one target up. It wasn't like today where tanks never lose anything and you can taunt literally everything. 
---
I remember tanking getting so much easier and less enjoyable over time that I switched to dps in Wrath and never looked back. (I quit during Mists and haven't been back except for short stints)
---
how can i find an oceanic guild?
---
I hadn't thought of that, that's a great plan if you weren't to rely on other players.
---
Try PWS, Holy Fire, Mind Blast, SWP, wand and see what you think
---
It doesn't but I found the menu. I can only pick retail for now, though.
---
Oh, you dont love ICE LANCE?!
---
Order in which a sane guild would hand out TF:
---
- MT
---
- OT
---
- Fury warrior(s) that tank often.
---
- rogue, maybe.
---
Rogue really just brings dps. No water no soul shards. Just show up
---
Pardon? I played mage in vanilla and we were not the strongest class, we were extremely fun but strong? I don't know, maybe if I let everything off in one go you dead but then there were rogues, warlocks and shadow priests. Paladins were annoying but fun, warriors were kited about like toys, hunters pissed me off with their pets. I'm still deciding what to play as I loved and still love my mage but I'm thinking warlock.
---
Hunter is not the only class that can farm "low level Dungeons." They aren't even the only class that can farm DM.

If your only worry without retail raiding is really running the same raid multiple times a week on different difficulties, you might want to give retail a go. Sans the top 10 guilds in the world going for world first, guilds raiding with mythic as the goal will not touch looking for raid or normal difficulty. They'll likely clear heroic for the first month at which point the bulk will not need heroic gear and will be exclusively raiding mythic, with heroic relegated to alt runs.

What will I have to do in order to play with US players as an EU?

Your comment is useless

As a priest mind control stands out the most

You can have someone make you grenades

Remember: Fury warriors should always be considered before rogues because 4-5 of your fury warriors will be tanking ALOT in AQ40 and Naxx.

Paladins, because I love fighting along side my allies and healing them in clutch situations.

CHAT UP A HEALER AND SPLIT THE DROPS. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DPS THAT HAVE BEEN STANDING IN TOWN FOR AN HOUR WAITING TO GET THEIR RUN. TONK DOESN'T HAVE TO BE POOR.  LIVE IN STRAT, EMBRACE THE MONEY.

Haha I did literally the same thing. Grinding undead in WPL as PLD.
---
That edit just ruined any sort of reputation you may have had with this post.
---
Droprate is 2-4%. Very low yes, but two in the same raid is not outside the realm of possibility.
---
As are most.
---
Though i must admit i mistook the right part of the keyboard as an attachment they used to do,
---
Yup, I plan to get it on my hunter. A year or two after classic releases, I'll start leading pugs with it reserved. And then also farm the ungodly amount of gold.
---
This thread is useless
---
iirc one boss during cataclysm, in black rock dungeon had ability where he heals a lot and you  were suppose to purge the buff off of him, so they borrow a shaman during that .. 
---
what stopped them in the end was not able to use bress all the time during encounter.. dunno when it was changed.
---
Dual wield Thunderfury is bis for hunter.
---
Hinterlands as horde is legit the best zone in the game, leveling is ridiculously fast

Making an alt based on t3 lol

I need to try that

Good point, I should have told him the more shaman, the merrier.

Reddit is useless and i don't know why the fuck i try to even help anyone on here

He said non-damage spells, so thought that wouldn't count. But yes, Ice Lance is a great addition to frost.

I love Cata-WoD combustion more though.

Serenity Now

If you were a filthy bastard like me, after raiding you'd take your Zboard into a game of Battlefield Bad Company 2 and use a multi-click macro to empty your entire mag in one go and one-shot other players with the F2000.

Those were the days! They did fix that problem eventually.
---
Working together will allow you two to use new methods, such as melee hunter until bow skill is learned. Raptor strike is pretty good

---
There is one. Someone will link it.
---
Ive always found the Eastern Kingdoms zones much better than the Kalimdor ones to level in. Theyre smaller and have relatively closely stacked quests.
---
There will be less priests than shaman. If you are on a PvP server, even moreso. If you like priest and want to focus on healing, quite honestly go priest.  A lot of people hate priest and shaman is a lot of fun too, in that case go shaman it's fine. But IMO the priest is the better healer for PvE dungeons and raids.
---
I suggest you cheat, instead of risking your health.

I’m thinking warlock but I also don’t want to roll a warlock at the same time. I’m in a weird place with the class choices at the moment.

Classic wow has had advertisement. But what about Warcraft 3 reforged that was supposed to have a beta by first half of the year? that has had art taken back from the main website? Radio silence.

Boars don’t have hooves; then again, they don’t have livers either. It’s Zhevra that have no hooves and raptors that have no heads.

Society is useless and money is a social construction

Yeah. 1080p streaming is usually in the 3-7mbps range
---
I would reevaluate your plan. Doing that, has a real chance of killing you.  Why not instead do 20 hour sessions with 4 hours of sleep in between?

There's going to be so many priests but not shamans

Hope u brought your popcorn as I square off against the myriad of asmongold wannabe rank 1 wing clipping nightfall mains

Stand up and walk around frequently. People in Korean internet cafes have died of blood clots because of sitting for too long.
---
Win win either way
---
From personal experience I do believe this is the correct answer.
---
i do not recommend staying awake for over 100 consecuative hours, at day 3-4 you can start haveing hallucinations. Sleep atleast 4hrs, dont put leveling as a prio over your health.
---
If this is a joke, then haha. If not, please don't do this to yourself.  Don't drink ANY caffeine after 12PM and get at least 6 hours of sleep, drink a lot of water, eat healthy, use a standing desk and/or walk around for a few minutes every hour. Before you start playing, commit to doing 30 minutes of cardio in the morning, get 10 minutes of sunlight on your arms and face, shower, floss, brush your teeth. 
---
I promise, you can do all of this and still burn yourself out on World of Warcraft.  If you don't have your health, then you don't have anything.
---
I dunno what raids you're running in retail but comp has been extremely important for a long time. Especially when it comes to maximizing DPS, but also spells like druid roots and lock banishes are crucial in certain fights. Not to mention making sure you have the right "type" of healers for the dispells necessary for that fight.
---
I remember there was a fight in the first raid of BFA that basically required a priest's Mass Dispell on heroic
---
Adderall.
---
avoid pvp crowded areas. even if you are okay with some gankers, eventually it will kill your desire to log in - there are better games and better things to do than encountering pathetic no-lifers. do all the 30-40 zones green quests, then start with desolate zones, eventually go higher 45+ zones, also always be fully rested and use all affordable buffs and consumables (scrolls, food) to speed things up. dungeon quests experience is another major part, but it will take much more time, maraudon takes about 4 hours...
---
Beer popcorn the whole deal
---
That being said making your own guild is probably wise
---
If you're as good at purging buffs as you are at talking out of your ass, than you've got me worried.
---
If you’re making money from ass-grinding, you rolled a female Nelf. Not sure how you’re getting XP from it, though...
---
With tanks we can't completely neglect quality for quantity, duirng my PS days I encountered plenty of terrible tanks, one of whom was not willing to learn or accept any blame.
---
Works PvP is some of the most exciting memories I have of the game.
---
swapping with rested is a very bad idea, level one, then when you have downtime at 60, level and alt
---
Which ones were bannable?
---
We need to get into the habit of referring to BFA as current wow instead of retail
---
Hey there! How are ya? Ya got my attention.

Please stay out of our hippy zones. They are full.

Don't forget water walking. On private servers (I didn't raid in vanilla) we would take the Zep to Grom'gol and jump off as soon as we zoned into STV so that we could swim to ZG island. It always felt so satisfying throwing out water walking to the whole raid.
---
Certainly not my only worry with retail - there's a million and one things wrong with retail, but boss fights and difficulty have been improved in raids, in the "mythic" difficulty or "heroic" as it was for a while. Even if it were just 1 difficulty I'd still be unlikely to play because of all the other shit you have to wade through while playing.
---
What is the best early pet for horde hunters?  I would really love an owl but I read that they are rare until level 40 or so.   Would it be a cat from barrens?
---
Same thing for Miso or Wasabi... People pronounce the 's' like a 'z' and it's wrong.
---
Rested XP doesn’t add up very well until the later levels. Id put a few hours here and there into the alt but get your main to 60 first. You’ll be able to help your alt our with gear gold and such which will speed your leveling more than waiting in rested xp.
---
What bugs? What do you mean “better classes”. I heard hunters are the pretty good.
---
For a moment I read it as Shahraz. Was thinking "how does that work". Why was Shazzrah his favourite boss? To me it was just one of the small-name bosses between Geddon and Majordomo.
---
Theres literally 0 benefit to crafting a wand yourself. 
---
If you really want a wand before level 10, it's more efficient to just level skinning and buy one with the extra silver you make.
---
Holy nova literally makes you shine
---
Seems like a troll but if not you would be more effective actually taking time off to sleep than playing sluggish on 0 sleep to 60.

Cenarion Hold quests will *not* be released in full for phase 1

AFAIK there is no such thing. There is EZ-Thro Dynamite, but it does not stun.

No that would be just healing in raids.

YOU THINK I WOULD PLAY ROGUE HA. I WILL NEVER JOIN THOSE STEALTHED COWARDS. BACKSTABBING AND THIEVING. PATHETIC!
---
It’s not for speed runners since they’ll be ahead of the pack and have their own strategies for getting Wands easily. This is more for casual players who otherwise would most likely be grinding out mats against the tons of the other players that have the same idea. This way you can just level up normally, get into an almost instant 5 man, and get your wand mats without grinding or any difficulty

so excited for this, I kinda shrugged it off at first but now it's too hard not to be hyped.
---
I'm not expecting anything other than having a good time playing Classic, let's go!
---
I have a feeling that they are planning the next expansion to use the classic game and just continue off on another tangent that isn’t BC.
---
I think I’m just gonna make my own guild. It’ll be better that way than trying to mesh into a guild with differing personalities and perspectives. I think people are underestimating how many people are planning on playing wow classic casually. I think there will be a lot of availability for people like me that don’t suck at the game but have 0 intentions of no lifing content. I’d rather be in a guild that’s funny and cracking jokes than a super serious guild than a guild that’s sole purpose is progression over fun.

This is a discord server that you can use to find a guild.

Classic is part of the retail client unfortunately
---
Druid is fun, no doubt. At 60 though it got really old really fast so I can’t do it again but I twitch thinking at making one at the char creation screen ever time because they’re so neat to level 59.
---
Would you rather have a nightfall bot in a raid or another pleb healer that can be filled by literally anyone.
---
Rag will not be killed with in the first week. I am guessing day 8 or 9 :)
---
But why?
---
I know wands are good, but it's not like you dont have damaging spells to kill mobs with until you can do one of the quests that rewards wands.
---
Am I the only one sick of ""Am I the only one sick of "Am I the only one sick of ...." posts?"" ..... Responses?
---
Now, while I never condone racism and hate running into people you just described, don't you think making a broad generalization about PvP guilds is 
---
&gt;just have a general shitty attitude towards others?
---
kinda being hypocritical and having a shitty attitude yourself?
---
Any online game these days is going to have trolls, feeders, try hards, literally every type of player. Find the ones you like, stick with them, don't bother with the rest. Just like life. 
---
It's fairly simple tbh.
---
I forgot to add in the post that since you have the most important mat to make a wand, all you have to do is buy 1 simple wood and ask in trade for an enchanter to make your wand. I’ll edit the post.
---
Doubt it
---
&gt;There's going to be so many priests but not many shamans.
---
Valid point. I got the luck tho.
---
You tryna join? I’ll ninja you some shit
---
Curious why you want to?  Not throwing shade at either side, jw why you want higher ping and to play with NA? *Insert NA/EU joke*
---
Ravnos you got the positivity bro thank you. Bunch of meanies in this subreddit sad face : (
---
Yeah, stand out of the raid lol
---
Well, this is one of those things you have to find out through experience. The melee weapon users depend more heavily on that one item slot than any caster relies on anything. Its not going to kill you to go rogue main, priest alt, but its going to be a much easier life if you go priest, then rogue.
---
Rake at level 10 in mulgore. My personal favorite is Humar in the Barrens. I think hes level 23
---
Only 30 days left until Classic
---
You have that backwards.  There's less healers than people who can effectively swing nightfall.   So yeah as a raid leader id rather just have the shaman heal and a warrior that isn't tanking that encounter swing nightfall.
---
1h/shield significantly reduces downtime and provides much “smoother” damage output. It’s also less fun. 2h is very inconsistent, but the big RNGesus crits when you occasionally basically oneshot a mob will make your day. 1h with flame tongue is widely considered the most efficient and smoothest method. 
---
Totems are rarely worth the cost when leveling unless you know you can continue to pull mobs back to the totem to take advantage of its duration. Usually searing totem, stone skin, strength of earth, and grace of air seem to be the ones people go to most. Poison cleansing can be nice if you’re fighting mobs that poison frequently (Scorpids for example). IIRC the mana and health totems very slightly outperform their mana cost but generally are not worth it when not grouped.
---
Multibox. No matter how many don't like it, is it by far the most efficient and productive way to level alts.
---
That’s true, but a wand significantly increases your DPS at lower levels, and as someone maining a priest, I don’t want to constantly run out of mana because I have to spam Smite (outside of MB+SWP) to kill mobs. Plus with this strategy you could technically get a wand before getting Mind Blast.
---
Whenever anyone got their final piece, 8/8 in T1 or T2, the ML wouldn’t loot it to them until they performed karaoke to their favourite song.

It was pretty unusual but strangely hilarious, listening to a fat nerd sing “Sweet Home Alabama” to 39 other people on Vent
---
Mezlow what’s your battlepass so we can be friends when wow classic launches
---
Unpopular opinion: even if aoe farming is slightly more efficient, it's boring as fuck and the leveling process will be way better for people who do a mixture of questing, dungeons, and farming.
---
Except that within 5 minutes of launch the "am I the only one" posts continue
---
Play late at night for your timezone. Speak basic English.
---
If you main your Rogue (which is super fun btw), still get your priest to level 5 ASAP and get them to a capital city, learn Enchanting and Tailoring and send them all your crappy greens and linen.
---
That way when do jump on your Priest they’re already got professions up and two kick ass starter wands, you also are making money and supplying mats back to your Rogue for enchants.
---
Basically a bank alt but more. 😉
---
World PvP as non feral can be really good if you’re skilled and bar none beat WSG flag carrier. Problem is in PvE your main heal cast time is very long and you get sniped, and your heal over time doesn’t stack, in BGs you don’t have any burst and that can get annoying even though you can pretty well play objectives (which I think is underrated about druids). You also have to carry a lot of gear if you hybrid PvE such as resistance for tanking plus your heal gear etc. so there’s trade offs that are painful, but “bad” is the wrong word to use- I agree with you.
---
People have died from playing wow nonstop. If you’re serious about this, please don’t

I think that’s the point he’s trying to make. Always be leveling when rested is available
---
That's like said classic fails because it doesn't have something that was added post 1.12
---
Well, yes but actually no. 
---
It won’t be the same, but there are so many other shows that I love and miss that I’m still happy to have it back and I totally look forward to tuning in.
---
Warlock brings Banish, utility curses such as Curse of Exhaustion, Recklessness and Tongues, eating magic debuffs through Felhunter, spell locking through Felhunter, Seduction through Succubus, healthstones, Soulstone.
---
You also have some other niche utility spells like underwater breathing, summon stone and Doomguard/Infernal shenanigans.
---
That's what WoW would look like, if it were a Christopher Nolan movie.
---
WE'RE STILL GETTING LOOT TRADING WHICH WILL BE A BITCH IN PUG RAIDS WITH PEOPLE SNEAKILY ROLLING ON ITEMS THEY ALREADY HAVE TO TRADE/SELL. HOW THE FUCK ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH THIS BESIDES POTENTIALLY MAKING AN ADDON TO SCAN LITERALLY EVERYONE'S GEAR AT ALL POINTS IN TIME SO YOU KNOW WHEN A SCUMBAG TRIES TO PULL THIS OFF. ALL BECAUSE BLIZZARD WANTS TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE TO DEAL WITH THE RETARDS WHO SUBMIT LOOT TICKETS AFTER THEY'VE SAID THEY WON'T DO THAT STUFF.
---
 UNLESS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN TRADE AN ITEM OR YOU CAN TOGGLE THIS SHIT OFF IM PISSED NOONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS. BLIZZARD THREW OUT A TINY BONE WITH DUNGEONS AND THE COMMUNITY COMPLETELY FUCKING BOUGHT IT.
---
Followed you guys on the tweeter, looking forward to hearing more.
---
The ping might put you at a medium to large disadvantage in pvp. Maybe you can test it out during the next stress test whenever that is.
---
I see this *top notch* guild going places.
---
Fuck Oxhorn ! He has revealed himself to be a douche.
---
I played a lot of Rammstein and Apocalyptica back in the day. Others like Soil, Sonata Arctica, AFI, SOAD, Pendulum etc were also played.
---
He means the group xp penalty is higher on pservers, so you get less xp for group kills.
---
1) I'm playing alliance for the first time this go around, so I'm looking forward to the other answers
---
2) Does he want to use a night elf mount eventually? if so, darskshore would be a good way for him to get rep. 
---
3) Check out joana's guide for darkshore
---
4) you answered it
---
5) yes you can afford the second level arrows, no problem
---
6) no. just meat.
---
7) i \*believe\* raptor strike uses the mainhand. so it will have pitiful damage, even if the MH is relatively slow
---
8) at level 52 you can begin using thorium shells (gun ammo) from engineering. these can be turned in as a quest to get thorium headed arrows. 
---
9) here's a [pserver thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightshope/comments/984zax/how_the_devilsaur_mafia_works_from_a_mafia_member/) on the modern version of the mafia. back in vanilla, i don't remember it being as flushed out. who knows what we'll get in classic

Slanik was the best! I still remember being shocked when he banned me from ventrilo for playing Rick Astley, even though he just said he was banning the next person to do so. A life lesson taught lmao :D

Really nice work, thanks for putting this together!
---
While it's correct that you can't use shadowmeld in combat in vanilla - shadowmeld does grant the rogue one extra 'master of deception' stealth level making them harder to detect. There's also the slightly higher base agility.
---
Shadowmeld also can be used as a sort-of backup stealth when your stealth is on cool down, which it frequently can be since it's 10 seconds without talents.
---
Overall I think human is the better race, but don't discount night elves entirely.

I would say that both are equally in demand. Maybe slightly, slightly, a bit more demand for Shamans.
---
Fair point, but from all the videos I’ve watched the general consensus is that spriests are 1v1 champs. Which class do you think would fare better on a PvP server? I’m leaning towards warlock but I don’t want to get the shit yanked out of me by undead rogues nonstop.
---
IM STILL HERE WAITING FOR AUGUST 27TH
---
I guess I never had this problem because I like grinding mobs.  Turning on some music and just mindlessly killing some things for an hour to finish up a level is fun to me.  Then go do all those now yellow quests until you're out or some dungeons to balance it all.
---
I'm pretty sure when I did 1-60 on a private server I got more than half of my levels grinding in Soutshore, 1K Needles, and Tanaris.  So much vendor moneys from leather and greys, I could afford my epic mount at 60 lol.
---
PLAY RETAIL THEN
---
So you're one of those guys who made me do another 15 runs.
---
Lol, it was supposed to be a joke.
---
Some PVP use. Occasionally used in dungeons for shits and giggles. I don't recall it ever being used in raids. 
---
It's short uptime is pretty limiting.
---
But druid and warrior have taunt so how is it unique?
---
Yeah but im paying for ninternet (300mbit)+ interactive tv + hbo films and series 24.50€ a month

---
THANKS I HOPE THEY FUCK ME TOO
---
Ohh nice, but is there also a color version?
---
I care, I'm in one of those guilds, are we going extinct?
---
I shall try to explain the distinction I'm trying to make:
---
Lets take your example. A lot of ppl drink, yet most of them do not develop alcoholism. This is basically it right there, simplified (elaboration to follow) but there are other reasons as well, such as alcohol being a chemical addiction and not a behavioral one. I won't delve into chemical addictions since we're talking about a behavior one, but google should let you know more if you're interested.
---
Lets say 2 people start out gaming. They both do it a lot, and perhaps both a little to much by most peoples reckoning, but while one does put the game down and tend to important IRL factors when necesary, the other forsakes them. It's not that they don't try, that they don't realize they should, its that they genuinely can't. That's what makes it a psychological illness. The game can be a detriment to both of their irl lives to various extends, but the first person (which is the one with a functional compulsion system) is able to make the choice. The second one (without a functional compulsion system) is not able to make a choice. If you or anyone you know, or anyone reading this thinks they make have such a disorder, please feel free to ask any questions you have. That said, seek professional help - you are not alone, and we learn how better to treat and help the people with this issue every day.
---
As a further example, lets now put the same two people in the grocery store. They get an urge to purchase some icecream. The first one can make a choice of caving in, or not, and the second does not have a say and simply follows the urge. That is the difference between them, and this difference carries over and becomes the reason one will an addiction and the other will not.
---
The DSM did indeed add ''Gaming disorder'' to their roster recently, which is not to say that they added gaming addiction to it, but obviously ppl addicted to games do exist and we need diagnostic tools to better take care of and treat them for it. That is a given. The distinction I'm talking about apply to this situation 2, as here again it is the people already vulnerable to developing addiction, due to their compulsion issues (you can think of it as ppl with addictive personalities/tendencies if you wish). The point i am making then, is that a healthy individual will not develop this disorder simply by playing a game.
---
I am sorry you would think that I'm looking to oversimply it. On the contrary, i intend to and have gone very deep with this, having a desire to study it professionals once i finish my studies.
---
As someone new to vanilla playing a NELF in a group full of humans, I was wondering when it’ll be most convenient for us to meet up and begin questing together.  Would it be worthwhile for me to finish the NELF starting zone, or should I head straight for Elwynn right off the bat?
---
Using an enhancement shaman for nightfall isn’t smart. Hunters achieve way better uptime
---
Any suggestions? That's kinda the way I've been leaning!
---
also there's the thing about how much layering will affect it. 
---
It might well be very viable due to layering/layer hopping with groups

It’s conceptually the same, but requires different programming / networking logic which means it will likely need to be fine tuned as time goes on and could certainly contain its own set up bugs different from phasing.

Upvote for massive coffee dump. Now I’ll go read the full post
---
Feral is not weak like people claim, i play on a certain server in blue PVP gear while others play in BIS gear and i still more than hold my own. The only class that decimated me was a SL wlock, i tried to fight him 5 times and he destroyed me with full HP :D
---
Its pserver stats, its confirmed to scale better on pserver compared to classic beta. Its still strong, but might not be AS strong.
---
With its aoe stun, it can have situational uses in pvp. Otherwise it's pretty gimmicky
---
&gt;which class do you predict to be more in demand on horde side in dungeons and raids?
---
Shaman. Shaman will be the most in demand. Horde wants to load up on melee groups with WF totems as much as possible. You'll see a minimum of 6 shamans, more than likely 8-10 in a typical horde raid.
---
In dungeons you'll be equally popular as any healing class. In my experience not even druids get passed down even though they lack a proper ress.
---
hey come join us in TW server. we are making an english guild there. the environment in CN servers are bad. farmers and whatnot.

..Just dont roll on the german servers, mate.
---
The travel time will be rough, but if you can log in and travel there before your friends start it's possible.
---
The other consideration is reputation gain with Darn vs Stormwind. 
---
Generally I recommend completing your race's starting zone then meeting up at either Westfall or Barrens faction dependant.
---
Combat Res! It is awesome in raids and some PvP uses too, including battlegrounds.

most alliance leveling guides say that darkshore is the best place to level somewhere between 13 and 20. so it would probably be best to meet up with your friends there :)
---
when they are human the fastest way to get there is: sw tram to ironforge, do the mountain jump to wetlands, spiritress near menethil, and then take the boat
---
It will probably not be put off. Blizzard will put things off when things are early in development but rarely later.
---
It's a reason why Dwarf Priests are so good, apart from Fear Ward. Stoneskin allows them to remove poisons which they usually can't, which helps massively against Viper Sting and Rogue poisons
---
Orc +25% stun resist baby
---
I also took two weeks off, but it's not going to be a problem to move them so I don't care too much if they move the release. But you will know soon if they move the release the are going to tell you before the name reservations start.
---
It seems like Blizzard is intentionally shifting the focus back on retail while the new content is being finished. The beta drew a lot of eyeballs and my opinion is they will refocus shortly. Also delaying the stress test means more money as apparently a free pass runs out right at the end of July I think, so that would force people to resub just for the test is my understanding.
---
Also while the beta still had issues 1-40 it was nothing game breaking and far smoother and better an experience than I remember originally by far. I spent about 20 hours plus the last few days of beta in the Mulgore starting area. I dare say a lot of the bugs I ran into like looting in a group were originally there and frustrating.
---
I don’t think The release date is changing. They will just release it with bugs if they have too.
---
Blizzard has never delayed a release that they've already set an official release date for.
---
Im getting slight nevrous but only slightly
---
I think that at this point Blizzard would rather release a bugged version and fix it while people were leveling, than push back the release. They must be aware of the hype people are building around that release date.
---
Yes. I'm in the exact situation as you. I even went as far as prepping snacks and stuff for my time off so I have as little down time as possible. Except for the occasional Starbucks or smoothy in the morning. *It's a routine* I've started to notice more and more people becoming worried well have a delay and I'll be dissatisfied by Blizzard if this happens. How ever I have a giant backlog of games so... I wont be bored on my time off and regardless I'm getting paid to play games during my time off. Nonetheless I have hope for them releasing it on time and the stress test will likely follow a couple of weeks before hand. They'll release it buggy if they have to.  I think there would be to much outrage.
---
That's just not healthy.. can't recommend
---
The game might have more bugs than they would like, but I would be completely shocked if they pushed the release back.
---
Ah that would be beyond me then.
---
No. The last stress test happening has no correlation with the release date. They could decide not to do the last stress test at all.
---
In fact, the closer we get to the release date without hearing anything makes it more likely it will be released as planned.
---
/me let you do custom emotes
---
Was this just a fluke or are they reprinting them for classic?
---
You can just google "wow classic discord"...
---
I empathize, as I too, have taken time off work at my retail job for classic. But I don't Blizz will delay. Keep the faith.
---
Only lasted about 3 minutes before my ears started bleeding profusely listening to this video
---
Since noone else mentioned this (afaik). You should look up how to CC in dungeons. It's usually not necessary but you can CC 3 (possibly more) mobs at the same time via Freezing Trap, kiting and pet tanking.
---
Chain trapping a single mob is done by laying a Freezing trap away from presumed path of your next pull. Wait for a tank to pull and shoot your designated CC target to lure it into your Freezing Trap, hide behind a cover if it's a mob with ranged capabilities. Then use Feign Dead as your trap is about to run out to drop out of the combat and lay another one on top of your CC target. It's a handy skill for when you're in a group without any other reliable CC and your group lacks damage to kill mobs quickly enough.
---
*Chain trapping is one of the few skills that distinguishes a decent hunter from a one your should not invite to any dungeon once you find out their inability to pull it off.*
---
Maybe we can get one for retail.
---
Lack of effort?!  Come on!  I got the Tzukiii pleb to say OmegaLuL for Christ sake

What mouse with extra buttons should I get?

Funny, this is another thing that blew me away about  WoW. So common place now but back then when I first logged in w the winter veil update it kind of made me really understand this world was fluid and living like no other game I had ever played... and then they added weather effects.
---
Half Priced Books 👌
---
Everything in life it's possible. Alien invasion, earth being flat, reptilians, Anunaki, ...so, it is possible for Blizzard to delay Classic.
---
However, going back to reality, there are zero chances that Classic is delayed.
---
&gt;you should always go for it
---
Definitely no, at least not always. You can suprise a cloth-wearer with a big crit but trying to melee someone like a warrior is a deathwish.
---
You can easily do that without doing a countdown every second.
---
ME TOO ITS FUCKING CATHARSIS.
---
remember, ladies: every time you hunch over, an innocent baby explodes. please, for the sake of the babies, do not hunch over.

---
Going to be nice when there are group finder chats for realm/faction.
---
That's a tough question, because it depends on how soon you want to play with your friends. At level 1 the trip to Elwyn will be a horror. At around level 12, when you finished Teldrassil, it will be somewhat hard. And if you finish Darkshore at around level 20, the trip to the human zones will easy.
---
(My personal favorite is to level up to 20 in Darkshore, go to Westfall to do the Deadmines questline for awesome quest rewards and then continue leveling in Ashenvale. I even plan to roll a human and level him up in NELF zones from level 1 for the mount reputation.)
---
I am already mentally unstable so i am used to breakdowns.
---
what lol
---
I have played wow for 32 hours before
---
Jeez why was I down voted
---
I know this is a joke. But do it like the Troll Hunter Joana used to do it. Give yourself 4h+ of sleep after a session except the very first where you should take in 5-6 , prep your meals and drink enough. GL :D
---
Yeah, why i prefer HC guilds.. Break is when you fly to onyxia after clearing bwl and MC. And in naxx progression that actualy took longer, everyone took the break at the same time and the downtime was exact 10 minutes. 
---
Go afk unannounced and without a good reason and off you go from the raid group. But i see it good as then the rest of the 39 didnt have to randomly wait for one guy.
---
True, it won't work with the /sit macro. But maybe a deep prot spec (beginning with level 40) for AOE farming is your cup of tea?
---
I'm trying to compile information on the the best druid hybrid builds which is 0/30/20+1. What version of the build did you run, what was your experience with it in pve and pvp? What kind of gear did you use? Do you know of any guides or resources that cover this spec? Thank you
---
Logitech has numerous good mice with multiple buttons. They also have a very good warranty where they exchange your mouse if you run into problems. Other companies don't have such a good warranty and their mice break more easily.
---
Rested xp caps off at 1,5 lvls so visit your alt once a week or something so you don't waste Rested xp:) if the priest is the alt you could heal one or 2 dungeons till youre oytta rested:)
---
Then back to the main
---
How hard would that be for an orc though?
---
Most minmaxing guilds will run raids for 3-4 hours i bet. Just that instead of spending 3 hours in BWL, they will farm MC &amp; ony in the same raid night.
---
All of them.
---
I'm interested to find things like this that I never first noticed whenever I played Classic as a young teenager.
---
Varies greatly based on class. Some experienced hunters can record 1-60 times in the 70-80 hour mark. Most classes are looking at 100+ hours when leveling efficiently.
---
I think level 42 is halfway.
---
Goodnightgetzan
---
I don't see a rogue soloing princess in phase 1 though. Might be possible, idk.
---
Hunter gets that Eagle Eye ability. That's pretty cool.
---
Just mail to a bank alt if you’re not a mage.
---
Link please?!  Or ISBN?
---
If you hate down time don’t play mage. AOE grinding is fun but you drink for like a whole minute to get full mana and then do it again when you rebuff. I’d argue mage is more fun in pvp though.
---
Don't know, I think reactions in party chat when at scholomance headmaster are going to be hilarious!
---
Call of Druid: Travel Form FTW!
---
yea I totally agree :P It was different back then... there were more "tolerance" for "noob" players. I am afraid that the min maxers will be much more now than then though :P But thankfully my guild is a bunch of casual friends, so I wont have problem :P
---
Basically. my favorite build to play would be Sub with Master of Deception, Camouflage, Hemo, Imp Sap... its how I imagine the rogue class to be. But that would never be viable due to debuff limits hehe.
---
Do you really think anyone interested in classic will wanna watch you stream on release? Hell no, they will be too busy playing themselves and the only people gonna watch your stream are the people set on killing you in game. 
---
They're only watching it now because they dont have a beta invite. 
---
Also it is unrealistic to get to 60 like that. It would take you at least a week, the record time is around 3-4 days minimum. Highly doubt youll manage unless layering acts accordingly and you get super lucky to find groups to complete elite quests, considering 50% of all the good quests while leveling are fighting elite zones (which majority of the elites were all taken out in TBC and normalized so you can solo). If you stay up for longer than 2 days without sleep, you might die of a heart attack. And also it wont be fun. A person can stay up for like 20 hours then they lose energy and need sleep.
---
There was terrain glitch back in 2005 which allowed to climb up on the bank roof and gank from there. I wonder if it still works.
---
What do you use it for? Just pvp, or?
---
Gotta go highlander on that shit. “There can only be one”
---
Priest is what I would call one of two finished classes. Mage being the other one. Personally everything about shaman just hits the right spot for me. Chainheal is icing on the cake. Gear looks great utility is high they are durable, purge is stupid op. In pvp a Shaman is more offensive and in raid is pretty basic in its playstyle. Priest has a better toolkit but I dont care much for clothgear. I do like Undead however. I just realized this post was very personal but its my honest opinion.
---
Usually hear min/maxers say NE for PvE for dodge, but tauren definitely more enticing for PvP for war stomp stun and 5% stam.
---
Really though while the stun is nice and useful its pointless if you dont like tauren or how your character looks, since its really just a choice of faction, maybe choose based on what alts you might want?
---
Didn't know the proc causes tons of threat. Always learning something new about Classic
---
god including alts that percent is gonna be fucking low
---
Shaman can’t do all of it at the same time, either. Their healing is kinda pitiful without being specced for it. Their melee damage is extremely lacking, unless you’re both lucky and deep enhancement, and their spell damage, while amazing, is very limited without int gear.
---
Basically just PvP. It's great for seeing how many attackers are on a point before pushing. It's also fun in world PvP to perch yourself somewhere "safe" and watch for enemies innocently traveling along a road from a great distance.
---
It's not really useful at all, but its unique and fun.
---
I mean, it really does feel like that because when I see footage from real vanilla raids they play like shit with bad fps and connections, using the wrong spells etc. Yet somehow they manage to beat these bosses while the private server guilds have enormous problems with them while everyone being min-maxed and using proper talents, rotations, gear etc. We'll have to see on Classic I guess.
---
I do lol. I carry around a spirit set, and a strength set. I talent in savage strikes to give my raptor a 25% extra of being a crit. When i feign death, i set down a fire trap and switch all my gear with an addon. Then cast a raptor strike and spam wing clip. Melee is actually a high hitting attack for a hunter, most people dont know. And agility wont increase melee power, just crit %.
---
Those are the basics for healthy human bodily function.not over protective bullsh1t.if you dont do some of those..you will pay in the long run
---
2 weeks until 2 weeks until classic you mean
---
it's a fucking stress test, as in they really don't "need" to do one, all the bug reporting is done and all they are after here is finding out what the capacity is, something i'm sure they already have a good idea of, it will not effect the release.
---
They've delayed releases for content patches, but once they put a date on something they don't miss it.
---
It is by far the easiest class to do it with. Sure, you can get a rogue to as well, but they arnt a tank. A pet is, and you can heal pet.
---
Ok
---
honestly probably why it's better to find your guild as a group AFTER hitting 60. I personally don't think you'd lose much, cause that guild will probably think, "5 60s on week 1-2, no reason not to take them"
---
No hope needed.
---
What is that and how much does it cost? I don't have desk space, but I need something small to be able to read twitch chat when I start streaming next month
---
Delaying is a massive PR fuck up for Blizzard. They are not going to delay. I'm tired of doomers assuming the worst.
---
Likewise, if you took time off for the game and the launch is delayed, that's not really anyone's fault, just bad luck.
---
Like I said, they aren't going to delay.
---
level one, then do the other
---
Truth be told I dont see why warriors should prio that weap over shaman. 2hand is their pvp spec just as enhance is for sham. Nobody is gonna raid 2hand fury with a mace either. Your question about joining and getting prio sounds retarded. In no way is that gonna happen. Ever.
---
Logitech or Razr. Though my Razr mice have tended not to last as long as my Logitech
---
I really like aoe grinding and I've done some testing with spirit gear on pserver and the downtime doesn't bother me too much. 
---
Any ideas on any other classes with similar farming potential? I know mages aoe is pretty unmatched.
---
and being the only non-healer class that can rez is also nice, implying you play for ele or enh playstyle and dont heal
---
And you can easily hit 60 in half of that. Theorically it shouldn't be that hard there's plenty of longer no-sleep gaming challenges out there
---
Also can recommend getting a Logitech. Very sturdy
---
I don't make any WoW content, but people like you make life a lot easier for those who do. Great work!
---
13 august
---
it's a bit of perspective, but yeah that's not casual by a lot of eyes.
---
fun fact, Shaman's eagle eye can jump from place to place, while hunters cant. 
---
In other words, imagine if you are standing in orgrimmar and cast it in durotar, from there you can cast it again into barrans, and from barrans to thousand needles, and you can keep jumping all over the place while your character is in orgimmar. Hunters cant, but at least it is instant for them.
---
Yeah definitely. I was very much a noob tho, lol. It's okey to say it m8, my ego is not so fragile as that.
---
Yeah i can understand that ! I loved those talents bk in the day. I can't do a dagger work if you paid me to, just doesn't fit the feel of the class (for me).
---
Based on what?
---
Deja vu
---
It's insanely easy to do with a druid too you don't even need the right spec or amazing gear.
---
Need to be added on the bingo then
---
Yeah, I had some friends invite me back to try legion saying it was “like tbc” but they clearly didn’t remember tbc very well. M+ was the only thing worth playing. I tried bfa, i played for about a month or two but all in all retail just feels like a big mess. Too many expansions with a really incoherent story of multiple timelines that seem to exist only to bring back names from the past that people recognised. Every expansion is like a foray into a new theme, almost like fashion, a new colour and a new style, going unworn once the new fashion is out. From what I read of their design intentions on the Azerite system they recognise that vertical progression cannot continue forever (hence stat squish and no new abilities etc). If they could have recognised that with tbc the game might not have gone on a downhill trajectory. If they would have introduced new talent trees instead of new classes and not simplified and made accessible everything they could, I think the retail game would be worth playing. 
---
I just find classic to be better in almost every way, certainly every way that matters and I’m glad they decided to bring it back.
---
No no no, we didnt damage him, we just got him oom. 
---
It was a group pvp battle, and he was their main healer. My hunter wasnt even T1 geared, so i obviously stood no chance to try and kill him. So i was just a viper sting bot to that guy. They are useless if they are unable to heal, might as well be dead. Anyways, it worked and he died shortly after after he went oom, and we kept him oom.
---
Nice stuff, but as I already mentioned it before, it would be nice if the items use ingame font:   [https://i.imgur.com/fi8bjKh.png](https://i.imgur.com/fi8bjKh.png[/img])
---
The headless horsman was added in TBC.
---
 My plan is to buy a lesser magic wand in the AH or get the Darkshore quest wand at around level 12( rolling a gnome warlock). Whichever comes first. Going to try something though, a longshot but worth a try. Here it goes:
---
  I will enter Elwynn at level 10 to do the Voidwalker quest, afterwards I'm going to run into Westfall and grab the flight path and do a couple of the first quests in the zone. The people's Militia questline rewards a very good wand. Quest requirement is lvl 9 and all 3 quests are kill quests so no drops, good for grouping. The final mobs you need to kill are lvl 13-18.  
---
My thinking is this, if you have a full group of low level casters it should be possible to finish this questline even if the resists will be massive. So going to try and advertise in general chat for any casters wanting to join a wand rush group. Probably will not get a group going but seems worth a shot.
---
eh but who wants to play a druid...
---
That's what all the hardcore folks going for R14, world first etc. say.   
---
Get a good rest between each gaming sesssion. 4 hours is mandatory.
---
There are other aspects which you can cut like food preparation, physical activity etc.
---
Sleep really shouldn't be the part which people should cut out entirely.
---
Especially if level 60 isnt a goal in itself, but a cornerstone of starting to run preBiS or farming.
---
If you are awake 100hours, you then will have to sleep for a day and lose all the progress in a way.
---
I actually did not know that. I'm playing a shaman this time around so that's good to know. I actually didn't know Shaman's even had this ability.
---
No? It dropped off geddon because it was left on the table by mistake. What you are thinking of is the oneshot cloak during wotlk.
---
I was 11 too. Didn't know about the talent tree until mid level 40s.
---
And you think druids are somehow better?
---
Think he means he will use up rested xp and then stop till he has enough rested xp again, repeat, all the way up till 60.
---
I think every poll on the sub would disagree with "...not as shamans."
---
  
---
For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c2el2b/here_are_some_results_of_the_survey_from_the/

This is the shit you hear about on the news of somehow someone dying playing video games lol. It will get WoW a lot of publicity, but it’s basically impossible you will actually perish.

You r right

IT’S RANTING, NOT WHINING, I LIKE THE IDEA BUT DUO BOXING TWO DIFFERENT CLASSES IS CONTRADICTING, SORRY TO BURST YOUR VANILLA BUBBLE

Warlock with void tank and dots on everything but I like mage or hunter for grinding. I did a priest on the private servers and it was so boring before lvl 40
---
MY IRL FRIENDS HAVE SAID THEY WILL PLAY BUT I'M AFRAID THEY'LL QUIT AROUND LEVEL 20 AND THEN I'LL BE ON MY OWN. ALSO STUCK BETWEEN TAUREN WARRIOR OR TAUREN SHAMAN. I WANT THOSE SICK 2H WF CRITS.

Mine will be a name that will piss the leftists in eu. I tested it on undocumented server and got a lot hating whispers. Also checked armory both eu &amp; us. No one has made char this name so I doubt anyones gonna reserve it, saving me the 7,5 dollars too.
---
Absolutely. I feel it hard right now. its torture.
---
Shaman is much more in demand. There's never too many. Like paladins, they can be stacked more easily than other healers.
---
I am actually fairly aware. If you wanna bet some money I'd gladly bet it dies before the first reset, assuming of course there's no severe down time on the servers.
---
I'd do it to, I don't carry cash so I'd be out my costco card id go replace, a credit card id cancel, and a movie ticket to Dragonball Super: Broly from a few months ago. I'm willing to make this trade Blizz, hit me up.
---
I like it. Saved. Thanks!
---
Yeah. I've played some mmos, and have been really into some classes, but it sucks when they class you play is weak. I used to play SWTOR. I played a sniper. For some time they were great. Then there were a bunch of nerfs and my playstyle became weak. Still did fine in ops (raids) but I didn't like not doing certain things. Then they nerfed everything so 2 year old babies could play the game and I quit for good.... The classes I listed are those that I like. Id probably be happy with any of them. Tanking is fun but I don't like the rage I get from pug members. Dps is always fun. Ranged dps is a blast. I enjoy rogues too.
---
Thats the places i grind. Tyrs hand and the satyr for cloth. Couldnt remember them, thanks!

A friend I met played daily until he died last year. He was very hardcore, had done every raid, fully geared at least 1 of every class. He would practically drop everything in game to come run with me through dungeons, or give me gear, he always had my back. I remember meeting him as a solo warrior in SS, my first wow friend.  I quit wow years ago, but I'll be back for classic, already subbed. I wish he was here to start it all over with me. I'll be naming my guild after his character. Miss you Tooheys!
---
As someone who wants to start streaming Classic as soon as it releases. This is a godsend for the overlay I'm envisioning.
---
Thank you very much.
---
 BFA just seems so fucking boring, doing the same world quests every day to make your necklace gain maybe 1% increase in stats, then in 2 months or so having it be pretty much pointless that you did it, then finding out that even with catch up mechanics you have guildies that can't even use some of their dps traits even though you're in a mythic guild and that's such an easy increase for overall damage for the raid, and then finding out the same guy didn't remotely listen to the mechanics explanation, and when you're 12 pulls in waiting for this guy to figure out how to do 1 mechanic, he ends up getting a max ilvl titanforge socketed weapon, which obviously he can't trade and he wouldn't (I wouldn't). And then the one thing that's at least somewhat fun being m+ is kind of pointless after you have heroic ilvl gear under your stat priorities and shit.
---
Meanwhile in Classic, I'm around level 54, a mage, with a shaman and a rogue outside BRD (waiting for the other 2 to pick up stuff and get here). A dwarf warrior attacks the shaman thinking he's alone, when I hit him with the instant cast bullshit wombo combo. He dies, and the gnome mage in their party who I don't know about yet is hiding in the ghost quest area. I go and look around for other party members, eventually finding the rest, where I kill the mage, and eventually find a lvl 60 priest who is headed towards our shaman. Rogue joins in and helps DELETE the priest. I notice on the middle bit that there's a night elf hunter who's sitting on the outer ring, waiting to cross with the rest of his group. I wait for my group to come and cross. He jumps and splats on the lower area which leads to BRD. We farm these guys until we eventually have everyone inside with all the quests they need. Later we zone out to reset ring of law cause some of the group members wanna get that loot. We immediately find 10 people outside either camping us or waiting for the elemental quest guy to respawn. Obviously some of us die.
---
I get so much more out of WAITING for a fucking dungeon in classic, than I do in the highest level of content in retail.
---
I mean this isn't really that hard to understand.  Elemental Fury is analogous to Leader of the Pack and PvP druids pretty much all take NS.  You don't blow NS as soon as you enter combat.  It's there in your back pocket to use when you need it and it can absolutely turn the tables on people.  Going 21 points down ele just to make your shocks better is just obviously bad.  You are Enh, you've invested everything into big physical bursts.  Shocks are utility, the damage is incidental.

Pamirn! Of course! We had an amazing time. Twin Emps was awesome and I regret we never got the positioning down for C'Thun, but &lt;Ascend&gt; was great. Main tank was Bosley if I remember right? I transferred to another server after Bosley left us and &lt;Ascend&gt; fell apart, ended up clearing KT about a couple weeks before TBC as one of 8 fire mages rolling ignites.
---
If anyone knows where Tahu is, hit him up too!
---
yikes. another one.
---
You can get carrion bird in place of an owl. They don't have the attack coefficient of owl, but have armor for tank, and have bite ontop of claw. Spending a bunch of time going out of your way for an owl is probably a net loss unless you specifically want that animal.
---
I use deadmines as the ideal meetup point. Since it’s alliance first dungeon and loaded with good quests and blue. Thus, I shoot for arrival in westfall by around level 15. Deadmines ready at 18.
---
Warden staff is pure mitigation, it offers no boost to threat at all so even players farming MCP uses the staff still.
---
It honestly depends on your guild, if theyre hardcore enough, they want you to farm it because it means the dps can push harder.
---
If you dont want to farm MCP and need more threat then the only other option weapon wise is a 1hand+offhand combo like: https://classicdb.ch/?item=21268 + https://classicdb.ch/?item=13385
---
Otherwise once youve gotten enough armor points the go to threat upgrade is the bwl trinket: https://classicdb.ch/?item=19406
---
But these are not upgrades before AQ40 or BWL is on done.
---
With effectivity and productivity, comes a price. But I think most multi boxers, easily got a couple of millions gold from retail on each account. But yeah, if you got no sufficient way of getting gold, can the price of multi boxing get expensive in the long run.

After our launch, we are planning to put up information on how others can potentially participate.

Blizzard should delay if needed. and they will if needed
---
There's some stuff to do in Arathi and Alterac, and at mid 30s you can go to Dustwallow, but I think everyone will probably still have to touch STV at some point. Its honesty an amazing leveling zone it's just that because of that everyone from both factions go there and then it turns into a shitshow
---
Serious question - why are owls so good?
---
BUT WHY CAN'T I JUST CHOOSE MY LAYER, HURR DURR, MY IDEA IS TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM WHAT SERVERS ARE, AND DEFINITELY DOES NOT IGNORE THE FACT THAT LAYERS ONLY SPAN A SINGLE CONTINENT.
---
Me exactly

How long does it take to farm MCPs and how many do I need on a standard raid?
---
are you one of those damn furries
---
Why are you bothering theorycrafting? People figured this shit out 10+ years ago..
---
Are there horde night elves?
---
or a druid, or a paladin, or even a shaman for 5 man tanking if you're a true hero.

Is this whole sub going Horde? I want to play Alliance but also don’t want to end up insanely outnumbered on a PvP server

HELL YEAH!

He's a troll dude. Report the post and move on...

At 28 and 48 you stand around wondering where to go. And the answer is Gnomeregan and Maradon

It would have taken you less time to link the discord...

If you teach it screech then they become super tanky while also dishing out high damage.  I found them really good as leveling pets when I played as NE.
---
Corsair Scimitar
---
Yep, that is so m8. Doesn't mean you somehow know the future and can tell it won't happen again. They certainly would stomp such a bug, i would be screaming at them to do so with the rest of you, but we're not omnipotent.
---
Warrior is very time consuming, very slow to level.
---
But if you manage get some gear, I don't see why you can't do some raids
---
I thought thick hide did scale with bear form?

i main warrior and i dont think he has anything completely unique like for example mage's food and portals. maybe the stances only. i dont think theres spell reflect in vanilla and battle shout isnt anything special. sunder armor? i think rogues had it too lol
---
I remember circling this and the BradyGames guides every time I went into a book store. It got me so damn excited seeing anything WoW related in public when I was a kid
---
Shaman if you know exactly how to use your totems. Really obnoxious having to remind a sham to drop wind fury
---
Nope. And hopefully I can get my main to 60 and an alt to 40 before they start becoming popular.
---
This post sounds deluded AF its a funny read with the addition of your comments section responses.
---
TLDW: Conventional vanilla wisdom. Thunderfury is for tanking not dpsing. This weapon single-handedly (no pun intended) changes a guild. It dramatically increases the MT's threat output, which raises the ceiling of the total dps the raid can put out. So your dps kills stuff faster, so your healers don't oom during long fights, and your tanks don't die. 
---
What it offers for the entire raid in the hands of a tank pales in comparison to the small increase in dps for the single rogue in raid group #5 who will also pull aggro on secondary targets with the lightning proc. And then that rogue will replace it not long after with better dps weapons in AQ40/Naxx. I don't know much about tank weapon itemization late into the raid ladder, but I can't imagine Thunderfury is ever replaced for the maintank.
---
Who doesn’t raid drunk

What’s going to happen with stress tests and betas from now til release?
---
It would've taken him less time to google it.
---
did my BSc and MSc projects with it, i have a soft spot for ol' matlab &lt;3
---
To be honest, vanilla was pretty buggy and unstable at launch too.  As long as Classic is mostly playable, I'm fine with it having uncorrected problems.

I'd give it to a DPS once the MT got one. By the time you get your third binding you should probably throw the rogues a bone.

Hey thanks for your comment and adding to the discussion.

IT’S MY BUSY SEASON FOR WORK AND IM SLOWLY SEEING MY HOURS DWINDLE FOR PLAYING CLASSIC!

i've changed my mind 3 times already, and even though i'm 99% set on hunter i still have a suspicion that on launch day i might just flip out and make something different
---
This was my first character and I am a huge Zelda fan.  Linken's Sword of Mastery was my favorite quest reward and I used it because I thought it was cool and was oblivious that there was stuff that was way better. Cannot wait to go through that quest chain again!
---
Was a shirt :)
---
*look of horror*

this is big dummy move
---
What? You know those jobs pay like 6 figures right? 50k isn’t *that* much lol. You’d have to be insanely stupid to take a job on an oil rig *anywhere* for only 50k, let alone in a remote region like the arctic circle. For the record, it’s distribution, right here in the US. I literally move shit from the back of a truck into stores all day... it’s dumb mindless labor that anyone who can count to 100 and read can do. It’s why it baffles me that so many people on here can’t find a decent paying job... I find it hard to believe that there are this many people on Reddit that don’t meet those basic qualifications.

Whichever RP server I see first unless there actually do add RPPVP servers then I’ll choose the first one of those I see

Sorry, that comment doesn't contribute something constructive.

It was amazing in TBC, which I still think had by far the best overall class balance, and great albeit a bit OP in Wrath.  But yea, I definitely won't play it again in Vanilla.
---
Oh neat, thank you! :)

A fellow Minnesotan, I see.

please enlighten me

How else will you stay pumped while slaying boar #673?

yesir open world pvp
---
Agreed, blizzard has to know the target audience for this is 25+ and a lot of us have scheduled time off of work for this. Would be a massive deal for them to push back release.
---
I think it is this font https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friz_Quadrata
---
i want it for open world solo pvp
---
Bag market is all mine then
---
And theres a limit to how much you can go in terms of big physical bursts, the game was designed with keeping that in mind. 
---
I like to theorycraft that we can maximize dps potential if we use what we know, that physical damage is all dependent on weapon and strength stats + crit chance, while spell is dependent on + spell damage and talents like 100% extra damage for crit. So if we put 2 and 2 together, we might be able to get a shaman that has a good 2hander which does great crit with shocks.  Maximizing output of dmg
---
Thanks mate. This pretty much resonates with what I'm expecting from a PvP server. It basically taking longer to do anything, essentially (and of course the annoyance, but also the glee that WPvP can provide...).
---
I won't have that much time to play, well I guess we all will have less than 15-12 years ago... but it's too tempting to try, particularly with all the positive comments I've seen about it, despite the well-known pitfalls (ganking, etc.). Can always reroll if it gets too grief-y...!
---
Thanks for the honest reply!
---
This is very helpful cheers
---
because i can charge in cat form with another talent right?
---
Yes, but there is a lot of variants and sizes to make it match 1:1, see the links I posted.
---
Enlighten you on what? I don’t have any photo evidence of how bad I was back then just take my word for it.
---
Ok cool. So what would be a “normal” tank weapon? Something with +defense or +stamina?
---
Welp. When i do graduate, i hope I'm not as dead inside as you mate :P Have a good one.
---
Yes I meant I would go spirit tap 5/5, wand specialization 5/5, then straight shadow until 56 or so. Just dont bother respeccing at 40 to get shadowform 5 levels earlier.
---
What bag market, everyone’s saving gold for their mounts
---
Use rested XP on the priest. Save cloth with heavy spirit for your priest and any good wands you pick up.
---
shamans as a class are pretty interesting to me, and i plan on having one as an alt. in the unlikely event that i ever get her to 60... when exactly is it feasible to pvp as elemental? i've heard some people say you can do it with +nature damage greens from the ah as soon as you're 60. others say don't even bother until you get AQ40 gear, so that's a pretty big gap. what is the truth?
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
Ah fair, was too long ago to remember.
---
Yeah I was just wondering if people were planning on agreeing on a server once the list comes out or something
---
Mind blown. Thanks for the reply... definitely helps to see validation for the option I'm thinking of going for...!
---
dont think natural weapons bonus of 10% melee damage is good for cat form?
---
R u me
---
But it's so bad for rogues. They replace it for higher dps weapons later in vanilla. Warrior tanks use it in TBC still
---
If you could get a number of how many that played vanilla rust who are going go play classic as a percentage, and then a number of people who died that played vanilla then I'm willing to bet a lot of money that you could simply use that percentage on the number of people who have died to know roughly how many.
---
Sadly so. The new ones are as capable of error as every other being in human history tho, surely?
---
how about play the game, enjoy it and learn it? holy shit ppl have 0 patience nowadays about anything
---
You should browse this page, its quite the treasure trove of non-video guides and whatnot.
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=1091
---
And being a wage slave in an office cubical would? Okay.
---
You sure Classic is your thing bud? I mean, lashing out in hate and anger...we really dont need that "cool kid" mentality that has ruined WOW as it currently stands. Any twat can be ugly. Takes a better person to be "other"
---
Carry on. You will understand what I mean one day
---
Thanks dawg, will do...! Pretty sure...! :D :D
---
I just hope they pick one server each making it impossible to avoid them.
---
I find myself growing more and more confused by this phase schedule the more I read about it. Perditions blade dropped from ragnaros. Why wouldn’t it be released phase 1? Are they altering loot tables?
---
wouldent natural weapons be good for cat form? 10% more damage is serious no?
---

I’m no artist. But hey.
---
Hunter rolling need for his melee set. Couldn't be more iconic.
---
The PvE server with the coolest name, pretty much.
---
The op comment isnt me, i just didn't know spell steal wassnt in vanilla
---
Does the number of shaman in a raid make it a miserable experience to gear up?
---
of course, though I do believe in Omar and his team, they don't seem to be like the BFA team, so theres that
---
Pretty much. [Warden Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=943/warden-staff) is a pretty damn good early tank weapon.
---
Hopefully private servers are not representative of what Classic WoW will be. Thanks for opinion... good to know that there's always the risk of that... But probably not that bad, generally... (hopefully on Classic servers)
---
Some no life pserver folk are making a coalition on at least one server to prevent that from happening. There's a long post somewhere around these forums. They intend to announce their server selection before launch and that streamers are unwelcome there. Pvp server of course
---
I don’t know why but I love deep prot aoe woth pallys
---
lol i was bad too  how can i be better
---
Lol this fucking guy....
---
I have patience. But do you know what a cheat sheet is? It exists to make life easier, since you can't access everything from your brain immediatly. So there are two options: If I play the game and can't remember what x is and where I can find it / what is it good for, I can stop playing and google for it, or I can have  a neat graphic on my second monitor so I can have a quick look on it without further pausing my gaming experience.
---
I didn't say every fight would be fair or even winnable. Those advantages go both ways though.
---
Keep visible pets with you at all times, Alliance. It shows your friends where you are so you can sneak up on us Horde.
---
&gt; If you are only gearing one tank
---
Not getting TF doesn't mean we're not gearing you.
---
Piggybacking on this. I went through two Razr Nagas in the same amount of time I've had my Logitech and my Logitech is still going strong with no issues.
---
Was it a doomsday post ?
---
Does this also include talent tree icons?
---
Cool, sounds good. Thanks.
---
I believe that is called "doing the Lord's work"
---
I mean I have that suspicion too, but we have no idea if someone comes in here thinking they can just go go go with no repercussions. You may see it as a dumb waste of time comment, but if it makes a difference in someone’s life then I think it’s worth it.
---
No but there are a lot of classes that can.
---
Druid, Warlock, Priest, Hunter spring to mind. Others maybe too?
---
I've only done this for items, but doing so for talents (or spells in general) wouldn't be difficult to do. You mean something like  [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12339/improved-fireball](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12339/improved-fireball)  right?
---
You run 50 raiders, not everyone can make every raid. But what if 45 people show up to raid? Who gets sit? The meme specs get sit. Only have 1 druid? Bring the moonkin. Only 4 shamans, enhance gets brought. Ret pally? He is blessing kings on everyone. Only 2 tanks? Bring the Feral to back up tank, his is the kill target on trash because he should have more threat and by popping barkskin should take less damage.   
---
Any one who is meme spec should be expecting to respec for the raid as well. Not everything is set in stone, you have to be flexible. Running the same number of healers in MC week 5 and week 40 is just silly. Things change over time.   
---
Here is the biggest thing I can tell you about Enhancement raiding. Don't pop Stormstike, Max Rank Earthshock, right off the bat. 90% of all enhance shams do this. You will pull aggro and you will die.
---
I love the colors! Can you post it without "World of Warcraft" in the middle?
---
I remember someone asking a similar question specifically around *non*-class quests in Mulgore, so I dug around for the thread and found it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cfxah7/simple_question_sunday_july_21_2019/eudo2df/):
---
u/Explodagamer:
---
&gt; You can get there without dying. Yeah, I don’t think it’s the best idea. The well quest chain is Tauren only and there are gathering quests too. Sounds a bit slow. You can probably just chill on voice chat for a couple hours until you all naturally meet up. Make sure the Tauren player grabs the RFC quests in TB for everyone.
---
I *assume* this applies to class quests because I cross-referenced this information with all of the class-quest guides from [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/shaman-class-quests-classic-wow), where this text is written specifically for Shamans:
---
&gt; Orc and Troll will be the same since their starting zone is the same, while Tauren has their own quests.
---
According to those guides though, Shamans are the only ones with class quests before level 10 anyway.
---
So, uh, in the end: I don't know, but maybe that information will help you. 😢

Yeah precisely that dude! A rogue is an assasin, and an assasins uses a dagger.

Warlocks and mages are insanely better overall than spriests

Ditto that. Was delighted to hear they managed to revert the idiotic no language server policy. Sadly, them wanting to do right by classic and them being allowed to do so are two terrifyingly different things...

Oh I agree, it was very entertaining, the word 'chalice' will forever remind me of WCR. Lil' wink to the ones who remember that one ;)

But TB was the best part to me and the biggest reason I kept coming back.

It's like Thottbot without the item database function to me. Just not the same :)

You can’t tell me what to do!

If only there was a class that could tank every boss....
---
Hoping this is true
---
This sounds very unhealthy.
---
Take it slow, or you're playing WoW wrong!
---
Based on nothing. I said anticipate, another word for predict, or hope for., or prophesy.
---
5 instance resets per hour 
---
Afaik, the vanilla lock outs work on full hour resets, meaning they don't all 5 reset at the same time, or on a universal clock (it's specific to you and you each run)
---
Example:
---
:00 enter first
---
:10 enter second
---
:15 enter third
---
:24 enter fourth
---
:38 enter fifth
---
The next hour would be 
---
1:00 first reset unlocked 
---
1:10 second reset unlocked 
---
1:15 third reset unlocked 
---
1:24 fourth reset unlocked
---
1:38 fifth reset unlocked
---
Oh god yeah, that’s the biggest of bullshits. No server community. Knowing who people are and forming friendships and rivalries and all of those meta interactions with people is practically non existent in wow retail. Through tbc and vanilla everyone who was worth knowing, you knew. You probably recognised a couple of thousand people by their alias and could assess what threat, if any, they posed. The time commitment of leveling, of gearing of professions and the lack of server transfers and name changes, cross realm, looking for group and even summoning stones. You couldn’t go around being a toxic little shit and you even had to factor in whether ganking someone was a good idea, should you find yourself on a faction wide kos list.
---
My way is the only correct way to enjoy the game!
---
Honestly i resent this stuff and wish it was a ban-able offense :\[ Completely throws me out of immersion to see some dude do some xmen mutant trick and have 5 versions of himself. That and one of the strengths of vanilla is how the design of the games makes it so that you need to interact with others to succeed.  
---
Not trying to say shame on you, shame on your cow, or tell you what to do. Just stating my opinion on it.
---
Can someone explain to me whats so bad about streamers on the servers? Of course i can imagine some the meme dumb shit that will happen.
---
Like does it create some huge underline problem
---
Yeah basically tier 2.5
---
Ele shaman is either you are getting one shotted or you're one shotting entire parties with your chain lightning, there is no in-between
---
Rogue and Mage again as those were my primary two in vanilla. The 3rd being a Priest just because something different.
---
It was not added to Ragnoros loot table till further on in wow so it may not actually be on the loot table at launch.
---
Wasn't added until 1.4 therefore will not be available in phase 1
---
Llol that’d be me when I roll warrior
---
It is. The Sword Mastery / Perception / Diplomacy combo, Stone Skin and Escape Artist are just better. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm saying the other options are just better.
---
Definitely so dude, but more than that 2. As many ppl started to realize in the beta (the sheer amount of youtubers titling their videos ''i was wrong about classic!'' was delightful to see), wow vanilla - independently of our strong nostalgia feelings for it - is a stellar game in its own right. I'm hyped for a stellar game, for nostalgic reasons, and (not to mention) for a game with a design philosophy that pre-dates lootboxes!
---
&gt;Found the pserver player. Because this is bullshit from thinking back to actual Vanilla.   
---
&gt; progression raiding as both a warrior and rogue back in the day 
---
Yes I played a rogue in vanilla as well. Cleared most of naxx. Never had a hope of finishing due to not having enough warriors. Oh well. The thing is, most people in vanilla were BAD. Like REALLY BAD. With knowledge we have now I have no doubt warriors will start off as juggernauts.
---
Thanks, do you know if the reset timer is per character or account?
---
OP sounds like a hardcore neckbeard who will always be right no matter how much research is thrown his/her way
---
It was added to his loot table in 1.4, so it hasn't always.
---
Will be added to his table in P2, based on the Ion tweet.
---
Spot on. Thanks for articulating it better for me.
---
Atta boy
---
So this vid implies your are no longer a Resto-scrub bitch and have finally chosen to go Bear? If so, I’m glad the community have overall gain much from this decision.
---
He was probably hacked
---
But the int scales with buffs.  Also don't forget 60 int is 1% crit, so it's giving you extra crit too, scaling with your gear and buffs.
---
If you think 5% free int isn't good as a mage I don't really know what I can do to help you.
---
There was alot of testing it and it remained the highest TPS tanking weapon up into if not all the way through BC.
---
&gt;PwS before every mob you’ll be drinking as much a mage
---
........no?
---
Have you even played a Priest before? PWS does not use THAT much mana, and you get Spirit Tap too. I literally only drank like once every 20-30 mobs on my Priest.
---
If you don't use PWS, you're going to be re-casting Inner Fire all the time.
---
Please stop saying these things.
---
Fully agree. I’m kind of assuming there’ll be people speed rushing the enchanting profession so they can make money off of people wanting Wands.
---
I play undead so I don't know exactly where the skinning trainer is but I assume the first hub you run into would have a skinning trainer. Undead have one barely off the path in Brill so I assume orcs / trolls would have something similar.
---
I accidentally referred to flurry as fury, a rage dependent chance at 30% faster is not better than flat 33% faster application chance
---
Totally. I just don't want someone to miss out on some cool aspects of WoW. Which is why I made this list to consider.
---
Gadgetzan : goodnight!
---
me: jesus did the city just talk???
---
Imagine using 10 minutes hovering over items and calling it a guide
---
Or just flexing
---
Minimal, at best.  Windows 10 doesn't support it, only 7 does, but 7 is going away soon.
---
Absolutely agree. I've bought every iteration of the Razer Naga from when it first released all the way up to the recent Trinity. I have a box full of old Nagas. But since I've used the Logitech G600 I dont see myself going back. I like the size of the buttons and their angle much more than the Naga. The ring finger mouse button is also incredible. Can't believe more manufacturers aren't using a similar style as a 3rd click.
---
Warrior is literally the best DPS in the game, which is kinda broken, so don't have to choose between the 2 roles per se. However, would play quite a lot for it to be viable to switch between the prot tanking spec and fury DPS spec, if you want to minmax that is. If you are more of a casual player you can tank dungeons as fury, as long as you have some tank gear.
---
Can you link directly to your YouTube channel?  I’d like to like and subscribe.
---
Explain the parry percentage then.
---
aha yeah, that was the thing i picked out as well. melee hunter set lol
---
thank you! this is really useful!

new feature of WoW, the city criticizes you for how well you do at pvp.
---
Not sure, account was never hacked. Maybe I sold it, do not remember.
---
warlock and hunter definitely have the largest sheer # of spells, say what you will about their usefulness
---
what is the strat w/ druid? just bearform and pop out to rejuv occasionally?
---
so every WoW server ever?
---
Grate man on the best choice!
---
How many of the other classes do you have in your raid? Are there any other warlocks?
---
In addition to what the other guy said, wands don't have pushback, which can be important. If you are going to cast as a priest, you need power word:shield up, which is less mana efficient than just healing yourself.  If you are wanding mobs once they reach melee, you don't need to rely on one of your worst "healing" spells just becuse it makes you immune to pushback.
---
Good point, I was also a huge fan of blue pls. RIP TB.
---
It was 1000000% never true on private servers and every first hand account I've had from people who tanked on vanilla with proof have tole me it didn't scale multiplicatively as well. I've done the research and I don't want to argue about it. You're welcome to your own opinions on it, I'll never encourage anyone to waste 5 talent points in an extra whopping 200 armor that doesn't scale with bear form though.
---
Every time they prune abilities I'm scared they'll take away path of frost. Such a damn cool flavor ability and by far the best water walking ability in the game since you can cast it while mounted. It also meant I never had to farm that dumb water strider, which is nice since I didn't play MoP at all.
---
" 1. Most of Classic WoW was developed with pre-60 players in mind."  
---
Yes at start, until people got 60, then it was only 60 content.   
---
Thats not most, we are talking about a handful of lowlevel patches, and half of them was "catchup" to cater to people how was behind
---
It was though. Along with a lot of the other top tier MC loot (eye of divinity, hunter leaf, etc)
---
Alts are still in the cards, but I expect my main will be the only on at 60.
---
A few phases in, I'll see if I need a change of pace.
---
I assume there will be warlocks in any guild the three of us join, yes
---
Yeah man, you can find me here

What would you call it?
---
Awesome thanks for the info. Forgot about there being no nodes in Teldrassil which has basically scrapped this whole idea
---
Ask yourself. Is it going to absolutely crush your soul if your not top 5 of the dps meters? If the answer is yes go mage if the answer is no go warlock. Warlocks still do very respectable dps early on and bring soooo much more to a raid then just dps. You won't be top 5 dps as a lock early on but you will be top 10-15 and be more desired for your utility. Also summon should not be overlooked while lvling, speeds up dungeons immensely.
---
Warrior, then I think Balance Druid ;)
---
Ok? Every single raid tier was available in 1.12, but they're still going to phase them in over time
---
nah from florida but my dad is a vikes fan, so naturally i was raised as one myself. Hope to visit one day tho, seems like such a great state.
---
I got that dummy thicc neck beard
---
Great! T2 is my best set for rogue! I hope i will manage to get it in classic!
---
Thanks so much! This was helpful. Think he’ll be staying in Dun Morogh anyway
---
Be my friend :(
---
My guess is the artist wanted the text and outlines to be light against the dark background, and they accomplished that by taking a color map, converting to grayscale, and then inverting. Side effect is that all the zones look like the wrong shade.
---
Do you have running subscription?
---
I'm starting to worry that shedo and others have made the Druid shockingly fashionable... This is horrible news!! Guess it's time to roll Hunter.!
---
Which pvp trinkets are going to be in classic? I remember at first they only removed specific things.
---
Noice.
---
God I cant wait.. late night hits, everything is dark and you are cozy in your throne, throw in a blanket and some tea 👌
---
If you want a HOR. Farm the mats and show your dedicated to making it. Hand of rag goes to the players capable of building it without having thr guild fund anything but the ingots. Have a sulfuron hammer built or have proof that you have been actively farming for this item.
---
Be open to your guilds needs. If they want you to play resto, do it and show them you deserve the eye above others. Chances are your guild will have 3 to 4 eyes before they have enough ingots to make a hammer anyway so your chances of getting an eye are honestly fairly high.
---
That being said when it comes down to it, who would you give the ingots to? The guy who plays 1 spec and demands an eye, hasn't built his mace and expects the guild to dot? 
---
Or thr guy who has a solid lead on crafting the hammer, even has bought an ingot or 2 himself, plays multiple specs and contributes to thr guild.
---
Warlocks bring plenty of utility with banish, curses, banish, healthstones &amp; summons. Dps doesn’t really matter, just play what you enjoy the most.
---
I can definitely expand the wand section. Look for it soon.
---
But I don't agree with you about renew. 
---
When leveling if you use renew on every pull then yes its mana inefficient but thats not when you use it. You use renew between pulls to top back off if your mana is high and you don't have spirit tap ticking. 
---
And in PvE raiding if you aren't using renew then quite simply you aren't playing correctly; you just need to know when its appropriate to use. As you said, MT healing is a great candidate. So are OT. Warlocks at low mana are another great option. Stabilizing an HP pool to give breathing room for other heals (either from you or others) is another use. So there is plenty of room for renew in PvE.
---
Depends on the market on your server and how much your time is worth to you. Some people only put stuff on AH if it gives them a minimum of 150% of vendor value, others put it on AH even if the profit margin is as low as 1 silver
---
&gt;Delaying is a massive PR fuck up for Blizzard.
---
They're pretty good at PR fuckups.
---
&gt; wish it was a ban-able offense
---
Will never happen. Money talks.
---
&gt; Completely throws me out of immersion to see some dude do some xmen mutant trick and have 5 versions of himself.
---
There are plenty of addons cable of the same stuff as Isboxer do, a multiboxer just do it with 5 accounts. I don't play the game for the immersion, story telling, or to relax. I mainly play it be course of the social aspect...witch might surprise you. 
---
&gt; one of the strengths of vanilla is how the design of the games makes it so that you need to interact with others to succeed
---
Actually would I say, that multiboxers is way more social, then what the average player is. At least, that is my experience with other multiboxers. But then again, some people call LFG/LFR social, since you play with someone else...but you never speak, write or coordinate anything with those players, and the majority of those players, will try Classic and bring addons to do the exact same thing. So what is social, really?
---
&gt; Not trying to say shame on you, shame on your cow, or tell you what to do. Just stating my opinion on it.
---
I don't know what a multiboxer should be a shamed of? It has been a part of the game since day one, perfectly legal, and give a new dimension to the the game. 
---
I'm not telling anyone to play the game a specific way, but I have certainly meet a lot of people, telling me how I should play. In the end, am I only playing the game how I wish, and not how you, or someone else wish.
---
I have. I think the main thing driving me away from rogue or warrior is having to compete with all the human rogues / warriors for sword drops.
---
Agree the wands section could use expansion. Look for it soon.
---
Depends on your goals and your guild... 
---
If you guild is trying to no life and get world first on a 15 year old game, you don't have much of a choice - play either.
---
If it's just about dps, warrior rogue mage. So if you only care about dps you have your answer.
---
And you don't think that one server will have login queue from day 1?
---
That's why you do Mage first so you have the money to funnel gear into alts ;)
---
See, this guy truly understands the plight of *us* alliance players. Its so hard to coordinate with stealth classes when they can't be seen.
---
&gt; You'll see a minimum of 6 shamans, more than likely 8-10 in a typical horde raid.
---
This is an insane exaggeration. You're on some fine drugs if you think the average number of shamans in raids will be 8-10.
---
Rogue competes with the 8 other rogues in the raid. And Rogue doesn’t have any cc in raids.
---
During the character creation in two weeks, will we also chose the looks / class of ouf character, as if we were creating one usine the client? Or will this take place on Blizzard’s website?
---
Imma certainly try to keep to just 1.
---
691 without and 760 with isn't a multiplicative increase. That's less than a 100 armor increase without showing the druids base armor. Either you don't understand what you're talking about or you're attempting to troll. My research on this has been posted on my channel and in my discord if you're interested in it you're welcome to go there but the screenshot you posted doesn't show anywhere near enough information to prove your point.
---
I won't be responding on this topic anymore, it's a closed subject to me and my community at this point, you're welcome to your own opinions but don't shit up the thread if you don't mind, ty.
---
Man I've been doing exactly this, and trying to crop the borders as best as possible.  You're an absolute life saver, thank you so much.  I will be using this and blatantly citing the source!
---
It's BiS.
---
Same with me on sc2 :) - I played rogue paladin and finished with lock in vanilla so I'm leaning towards Mage, priest warrior this time around... but I might be burned out by the time I play my mage a few hundred hours
---
Flurry happens passively on crits, though. My point is that if warriors had the rage to spam hamstring, then they’ll have more uptime, due to a faster attack speed.
---
Mythic+ Azshara went down today, so I expect a blue post within the coming business week.
---
5 minutes per run or so.  It's best to just get as many as you can before you get bored, because you'll always need them.
---
It's not that big of a deal if you plan of leveling a Horde Rogue. You get 2 very fantastic swords early on from Wailing Caverns and Blackfathom Deeps. BfD sword will carry you till mid 30s and there is a very good and easy to get dagger from Gnomeregan.
---
Yup. Gonna roll feral druid.
---
All in one mixed bag so that I can switch it up with ease, save alot of time leveling/questing/dungeon running, and the day I get bored of X spec I'll make a big switch to dedicate the focus on something else.
---
4 in 1 baby. But I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, playing a "pure" class is more gain for less effort.
---
There is a longer cd on hamstring than wing clip, you cannot attack faster with the warrior
---
If anything it's easier to have an alt in classic than in retail. In classic once you are 60 and geared as much as you want to be, you're done. In retail you need to keep doing dailies and farming or you fall behind on any character you don't actively play.
---
Twin imps say hello.
---
Unlike other people who’ve answered I’ll probably choose a streamer sever. As it will almost guarantee a thriving community that communicates well.
---
I am ONLY choosing a STREAMER SERVER 
---
or im not playing at all
---
“Famous On R Classicwow”
---
I’m rolling hunter, and I plan to only be doing PvP at end game. I know Orcs are the go to choice due to their stun resist. Trolls have Berserking. Will I be at a disadvantage choosing Tauren? A lot of guides I’ve seen state you’re going to be a large target, and that will decrease survivability. I didn’t PvP at max level, and any insight is greatly appreciated.
---
First off, chief, I'ma go a head and stop you at "wrong talents," There is not a single 100% correct cookie cutter spec for anything in classic wow. Don't bring your elitist game ruining bullshit to my classic community, it won't be tolerated. Secondly the talents I have are 10000% perfect for tanking and can and will be used. 
---
Thirdly druids with pre raid bis are pretty much literally dr capped with armor after buffs and using a 2000 armor stone shield potion will net you around 4% physical damage reduction but trigger a potion cool down leaving you closed off to the possibility of using a health OR mana pot, which druids need to have access to, especially mana pots.
---
Why makea  post if you have L I T E R A L L Y no clue what you're talking about?
---
This is my plan, level a Mage first for farming / professions then fund my Warrior with whatever it needs and rush that too 60..
---
thats why you skip it all and just make a druid who can do most mage farms anyway
---
Seems they're using some questionable JS there. It works for me in Chrome but not Fx.
---
That wouldnt work since theyll have thousands and thousandsof viewers and one server wont possibly hold all of em
---
How is it bullshit? Do you have a career? People from all sorts of walks of line enjoy gaming, hell one of the road sergeants at my police service is a HUGE anime nerd.
---
It's 2019. Judges and Lawyers today we're playing WoW, Halo and other video games 15 years ago.
---
* For clarity to get the true base armor you would have to subtract the armor from agility. 
---
* In this case he has 36 agility for 72 armor. Thus 691-72 = 619 armor from items
---
* 619 /4.6 = 134.56
---
* 134.56 x 5.06 = 680.8 armor from items
---
* 680.8 + 72 armor from agility = 752.8 (character sheet shows 753)
---
That is the non-napkin math version.
---
They draw huge populations with them, both fans and anti-fans (as believe it or not, the people who hate streamers tend to stalk them just as much or more than fans do) which can be destabilizing for a server, particularly on a pvp server if another streamer doesn't join the opposite faction so one streamer's fanbase doesn't zergrush any opposition. I wouldn't be surprised if their audiences caused more layering to occur than normal.
---
On the polar end, there's also a possibility of how vapid such an audience is, since popular streamers occasionally follow trends. Some big ones probably won't stay in WoW long-term and when they leave, the majority of their fans/anti-fans go with them, leaving population holes which may or not be refilled by new players.
---
These are all just my own armchair conjectures, but one should consider the effects of a single server, for whatever reason, getting an insane spurt of players whom may later uproot themselves in mass exodus.
---
Are most end game weapons swords and maces? Everyone goes nuts for human warriors and I was just wondering if that’s why.
---
It depends on what spec you are, there's clips of people doing it as [NS/moonglow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=213ZPTiFEjU) for example, but there's also plenty of people doing it Feral as it is the easier way.
---
What about Benediction? It was added in 1.11. Which phase should I expect to get it. It would suck to get it at naxx phase...
---
I mean if you are talking about raid dps, but we aren't, and even if we were it hardly matters what spec you are for nightfall botting.
---
Which the entire guild got banned for using.
---
I don't think reporting is going to do much, it does not automatically ban players and they don't have enough people to go through the reports and verify them, at least that used to be the problem.
---
&gt;and continue to hear little to zero Info regarding this mysterious stress test I am becoming more and more concerned that we won’t see classic on the originally planned release date.
---
Not a new IP... relax - they won't change thebrelessebdate for a 15 year old game that has layering and content phases. 
---
You'll be fine.
---
That would be awesome - hope I can get a 10% discount if I buy 9 boosts.
---
So you have no evidence and he has at least one instance of evidence. He is correct and you are wrong then.
---
The new models look like hot dog shit
---
&gt;Launch week is going to suck due to the number of people playing at the same time.
---
Baffles me that people still think this when blizzard has put layering into the game for this sole reason...
---
As u/ILoveD3Immoral said, you probably won’t be able to play in retina mode, but if you bump render scale down to 50% (effectively 1280x800) you should be able to do anything ahort of 40-man content at a reaponable framerate.
---
How is this a pasta? It's a very simple and mundane anecdote.
---
Do people find it hard to believe that Teachers, Doctors, Lawyers, Police, Clerks and other public service fields don't play video games?
---
Go sit in a courtroom in-between matters and listen to the lawyers, clerks and crowns chatting about the latest MCU movie or Game of Thrones episode. 
---
Sure WoW and DnD are pretty niche but that's why even I was surprised when a few of the regular staff mentioned playing them.
---
It's 2019. People at the peak of their careers today we're playing these games 15 years ago and still casually play MMOs and Consoles etc today.
---
Personal experience. My first two characters were priest, followed by rogue. The priest is more consistent, almost no downtime with spirit tap. The rogue would be faster if stealth wasnt so slow, if you had an easier time with multiple mobs, or could heal yourself quickly.
---
Get your main to 60.
---
&gt; He got that necklace because a GM sent it to him accidentally
---
Yeah no it dropped from a MC boss you are mistaken.
---
You people keep forgetting classic will use the same (heavily updated) engine as BfA. Original vanilla will run 60fps on this no problem but Classic won't.
---
Thanks for walking through the math and providing a wide array of sources.
---
There is a lot of misinformation on this particular talent floating around the vanilla community.

If there weren't dor that pvp action that funeral would have been long forgotten...
---
Also depends on if you want to PvP, pvping in either warrior pve build (fury/prot) isn’t great like arms is, fury can work with crazy gear I think, but no MS (or sweeping strikes) is a game changer!
---
Mage first spec for pvp / pve are vaguely similar, can pick a hybrid of both and be 90% effective or commit to one spec and still be viable in the other activity.

&gt; You can easily ding 60, finish attunement, and head right into mc if you farm pre-bis while leveling.
---
That is some heavy ifs and a lot of relying on good drops. You also completely forgot to mention all the stuff you got from the AH that will not exist at launch.
---
Thank you for this comment. :) Yes I totally don't know how the WoW Vanilla community is.
---
Pug MCs with good guilds is a great way for players in non raiding guilds to gear up or to gear up an alt if your guild can't run 2 runs.
---
It's really win/win.  No pug player will ever get TF so reserving bindings is irrelevant to most.
---
Can you stay awake for 5-7 days?
---
Unless you've done speed running routes before and now how to manage the sheer volume of competition when the game is launched, I doubt you will be getting to 60 under 5 days play time.
---
If you haven't done 1-60 before or recently - you won't make it.
---
Being 60 within 5 days of launch is pointless, I rather get good sleep and actually remember/enjoy the game that won't ever launch again - than losing out on sleep and putting my body through so much sitting for dozens of hours straight. 
---
Coffee and energy drinks won't help you.

Setting realistic goals will.

I giggled.
---
That’s true; it won’t be as bad as it could be due to layering. But there’ll be still be numerous people who think that they have to grind to get mats for wands/other good starting gear, and why waste time farming out mats when this strategy eliminates grinding completely.
---
You're joking right ? Blizzard implemented tokens because they couldn't win the fight vs gold selling and they wanted a cut of that huge market. With no tokens we are definitely going back to old school gold farm spam.
---
You can’t eliminate glancing blow damage reduction completely. 308 skill is the soft cap and generally leaves your glancing blows dealing 95% damage. 310 does the exact same as 308.
---
Yes, if you can find a dedicated group that wants to run dungeons back to back, it's not faster if you have 30 min downtime between each run.
---
Lol at launch or in 3 months?
---
Enchanting mats while leveling are valuable at launch but few people will be spending a lot.
---
As far as dis enchanting while leveling for profit? Sure you'll make more than 10 silver... but it's no where near what you'd make with other professions.
---
You can de on a level 5 alt.
---
Benediction and Rhok were added in 1.4 not 1.11.  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0

You're having a rest in the inn when a voluptuous tauren walks in.  She knows she's sexy because there's a group of gawkers following her around just drooling. As a fellow tauren it gives you pride to see one of your own have such a following so you give her a /highfive to show your approval.  Suddenly you get 50 whispers about what a sexist racist POS you are and when you log in the next day your banned for sexual harassment.  This is a silly example but if you did anything to offend a steamer, intentional or not, you can get harassed and reported into Oblivion.

Throwing hordies down the elevator in Southern Barrens/Thousand Needles.

because its a "noobs" guide , go watch skarms video or tipsouts interview with skarm about druid tanking.
---
It’s more raid and dungeon carries then gold in retail
---
What about the bridge into Arithi from menithil? Its a long fall, is broken up a bit and some rubble to conceal yourself with.
---
Considered this but I only want to main my Warrior. The only reason I'd do it would be for professions and farming gold. Then again, I've never played a Mage and suck at playing casters. All those hours poured into a mage could just go into the Warrior.
---
That's the character reservation date, he's asking about the realm lists which should be released BEFORE the reservation date. This is so people can figure out what server they want to reserve their name on ahead of time and as far as I know that date has not been communicated yet.
---
Got it. GMs still aren’t gonna let you run around with Thunderfury in phase 1 if it’s obtainable through a bug, I guarantee you that much.
---
Just like how nobody cares when some youtuber pretends we're all his shitty class.
---
1 character until MC geared then start an alt.
---
I'll only have 2 60s anymore is wasting time and slowing progress.  I want 2 great characters not 4 mediocre ones.
---
wot
---
You'll melt faces
---
Honourable number puzzles? Seppuku maybe? 😂
---
I will be sure to tell them how annoying trade spam is while I’m buying gold from them.
---
You really think these "retail LFG players" are going to make it to 60?
---
Men are not carrots. Celebrate in some other way.
---
50 guilds clearing mc is a lot
---
Plenty of time to level up a farming alt later on. Best to establish your main first imo
---
Lets say they PM 1000 people and 10% right click report it, its 100 reports. That should make Blizzard do something.
---
Any elevators or potals are S tier cause comedy.

The bridge outside the alliance base in AV is funny too..

None of which had an exact release date set when they were delayed.

1. You start WOW.

2. You select a server from the server list.

Holy paladins require the least amount of consumables I think. They need less mana consumables than other healers because they don't go oom as easily. Healers also need less consumables than the other roles. 
---
The worst would probably be melee.
---
Blizzard is much better at catching gold sellers and botters than they were 15 years ago. Reporting does work, it takes a long time to level up a character enough to farm gold fast enough to be able to sell it. Remember many gold sellers would hack into people's accounts to drain victims of everything of value.
---
Nice start!  I’m sure fury warriors will be interested in 1 hand weapons.  I’m on mobile so maybe I missed that option.
---
If you roll gnome warlock, very gimped. Gnomes are gimps
---
The game doesn’t start until 60
---
It's really fun but at first it definitely takes a bit to get used to it. There isn't nearly as much hand holding as wow. People are really friendly to new players though. You get free stuff and buffs are far more powerful in EQ.
---
3% hit and ~15% glancing blow damage reduction for swords and maces as a human in PvE. 
---
If you’re going combat it’s not as important, you’ll take expertise (the weapon skill) talent anyways and you’d then only be gaining ~10% glancing blow damage reduction with some minor hit increase (like .6%)
---
Priests in vanilla hace an additional racial skill: Shadowguard for trolls, devouring plague for UD, starshards for NE Desperate prayer for Dwarf and I cant say if theres was more.
---
ONLY IF THEIR SHOULDER GEAR IS 3x THE SIZE OF OTHER MODELS. I LOVED THAT BUG &lt;3
---
If you aren’t 100% sure you want to play warlock, then go mage.
---
It’s weird because you’re making a claim without including sources but the other guy is making a claim and also providing sources supporting his claim. And now your comments are getting more aggressive which implies that your getting a bit angry. Anger generally stems from self doubt, which leads me to believe you’re beginning to doubt the claims you’ve made.

Currently leaning Orc Warlock. Playtime will probably be anywhere from 15-30 hrs a week initially. I am a 26 year old guy who works from home often as well, so I’ll be online during the daytime hours frequently as well as evenings. I am looking to casually raid 1 to 2 times a week and can consistently make times scheduled 6:30-7pm and later PST.  I would also like to find a guild that has members who enjoy pvping as I’d like to do both. Looking for a group of laid back people who are mature and fun to hang with for extended periods! DM me if this fits with your group please!

+ Timing of shots

At a glance the graph converges (which it should due to scaling % and assuming a greater baseline value for stats) that was mainly to help you though (because if it was perfectly linear and parallel then something would be immediately wrong).

There was a rumour back in vanilla that you do have increased chance for crystals, but I think it’s a total BS rumour! xD
---
Sorry if this is obvious but why would I want to avoid streamers?
---
Same for me. Will focus on one character due to having less time.
---
Dark Iron isn't used for much early on, so it's probably not going to be worth it until at least P2/3.

Yeah I was 6 when vanilla came out. Played since day one because of my dad.

Depends on the person, I've done 3 previous 72 hour marathons and although I had to fight sleep for a while I never automatically fell asleep. I was also fine after getting just 8 hours of sleep when the marathon was done.
---
Yeah but by the time I hit 60, I will be so far behind the pack that my purchased gold won’t matter.
---
The idea of the effectiveness can you grinding in the group especially in dungeons, is that you do it repeatedly, preferably with the same group of people in order to expedite it. The more you play together, the more you get to know how each other plays, and the less you have to communicate and the less you will wipe. So the only difficulty here is how much time you want to put in to getting to know other people, being social, and not pugging. Grinding dungeons repeatedly with people who you know their play styles is effective leveling, joining and leaving different random groups to grind one dungeon at a time is not effective.
---
The other side isn’t the priests. It’s the rogues standing in the fire. xD
---
In AQ the obsidian veins require 305.
---
Would be interesting to test, honestly. That could change mining as a profession! :)
---
Do you want to play against 250 spergs following a streamer around?
---
I have played WoW since vanilla, I only ever had one character in vanilla who is still level 60 and then rolled a new character in tbc who has been my main ever since. I have never got another character past level 30... 
---
I will do the same in classic, one character and a bank alt and that will be that...
---
Time zones or time travel?
---
There is one reason.
---
Fun.
---
oh god NA players are fucked :D
---
The healing requirements in MC/BWL are so low that a full holy spec isn't necessary. You only use that for AQ40/Naxx and even then, only during progression.
---
&gt;MIN MAXER!!!!!
---
Oh, so you're one of those people. Okay. Blocked :)
---
Only 1 or 2 are generally allowed in a Raid.  Everybody with a YouTube account (plus their grandma) is gonna be rollin Druid because suddenly they are this month's tryhard sick dps, sick off tanks and sick heals.  THAT HAS BEEN MY THING SINCE 2004.
---
I only wans have 1 toon and a bank alt
---
in this thread: professional druids kek
---
you're all SO wrong it's horrific
---
The absence of salvation on horde makes the tauren druid's highly desired and is often overlooked because "druids don't get windfury lol"
---
Windfury is a larger threat increase to melee dps than it is for a tank, and windfury on the tank does not make up for lack of salvation on casters (especially warlocks). Sure, windfury brings the warrior closer to a druid in threat, but overall the druid is still king with MCP
---
At least in classic they have to level up a character to be high enough to farm. Enough reports of the botting and all that time goes out the window. They also have to buy a subscription/game to even be able to do it.
---
And all those hours I could have put into other games I decided to put into wow instead. And boy has it been a positive healthy choice that has not at all negatively impacted my gaming experience in general the last 10 years. Hahaha.
---
If you buy 30 days of game time, you will be able to play Classic and retail if you want, for 30 days without any limitations (I'm referring to the retail level 20 limit etc.) Once that 30 days run out, you will need to buy another 30 day to be able to play again. (or you can log in the restricted version fo retail) I personally do not know if there will be a restricted version of classic similar to retail.
---
Crit % is reduced, but armor is too. It'll apparently be feasible to be fighting bosses who, with debuffs, have 0 armor. 
---
Supposedly, this gives melee DPS a much bigger boost than what they lose from the crit-debuff-aura.
---
Don't disagree with any of this. Just want to point out that Druids will be able to use Potions and other items that don't cause a GDC in classic. It was discovered on beta that the new Macro API allows us to powershift and use items instantly.
---
If only guilds had multiple tanks that could be available for what the situation called for...
---
I'd imagine it's there. Not sure if the quests/npcs will be there.
---
Break this into paragraphs and I would gladly read the whole thing.
---
This guide isn't properly beta tested. You have players getting and doing the "Bounty on Murlocs" quest in Elwynn before level 10 when the quest requires level 10 to even be picked up (I know I made a guide for myself based on pservers and ran that guide on Beta to see what was different). I'm also not sure why you'd skip Riverpaw Gnoll Bounty, those gnolls are a great grind spot and there's a named Gnoll that drops a quest item so grinding on them + doing a quest + potentially getting another quest is very efficient (not to mention it should be incredibly easy to get a hogger group near launch)
---
The vast majority of pserver and beta questlines (at least up to 40) are pretty consistent though, the other notable quest that wasn't doable on Beta is "Seasoned Wolf Kabobs" in Duskwood as it requires level 50 cooking to get
---
I think gnomes have a dagger skill
---
Night darkness got fixed in modern WoW a while ago, I want to say at some point during WoD or Legion. Nights in most EK and Kalimdor zones are as dark as vanilla or a touch darker now, and newer zones like Tiragarde Sound have darker nights than any Vanilla zone ever did.
---
Here’s a screenshot I dug up to demonstrate:

It's like a zerg but it doesnt do well in crowds
---
Whoops!  So it is.  Could've sworn it was P2 but it's P1.
---
Yeah this was on Pserver back in like 2015
---
Boss mechanics should be meaningful and effect everyone in the raid. By effect everyone i mean everyone should have to pay attention to what is happening.
---
Even more unpopluar opinion wildstar despite being a dumpster fire of a game had the best raid content of any mmo ever released.
---
Netflix. I just put a show on I like and listen/half watch. Leveling almost becomes muscle memory to a point. Can half watch tv half play. Makes it a bit easier. Unless you want to be super immersed.
---
Sorry.. but questions are getting worse and worse..
---
I can tank.. anything.
---
No Perds blade, no CHT, no Brutality blade, no domo class quest items. But hey lets put 1.12 Bonereavers into the game to make P1 warriors god kings.
---
What the actual fuck Blizzard.
---
It depends on the phase. Early on, raiders will want DI Ore and bars for rep turnins and making Fire Resist gear for Molten Core. It drops off a bit after that, but there’s always a demand for DI.
---
In the early phases, the demand for DI is going to be really high, but there’s not going to be a lot of gold in the economy. By the time the demand drops off, we’re going to start seeing inflation, which will artificially keep the price up.
---
I have no idea how it compares to mage AoE farming. I managed to finance three epic mounts this way, though.
---
They needed to nerf the threat generated by the proc because it outperformed current weapons during TBC.
---
Mages and warriors will be the most played on any server.  So I wouldn't worry about  anything like that in terms of playing a less played class. A prot warrior is basically the lead dog, but really needs to understand that they have to be the main dude each and every raid night. Everyone is always looking for a good tank.
---
The servers will be flooded by DPS warriors. 
---
Mages are just awesome and so much fun to play. They also as I'm sure you know have a good raid rotation that lets you enjoy the fight rather than burn out on a complex one. 
---
If i was you i would play a mage especially out of the gate. You can always start a warrior later and use your mage to help funnel stuff down to him.
---
You sit down your average 13 or so year old in front of classic wow, they will get bored and frustrated. Because it's not the norm. 
---
The norm is 20 minute fortnite/moba matches. 
---
While im sure there are some, of course, classic wow won't be pulling in many new young players.
---
East coast pvp with a cool name!
---
We did back then. Most reports gave no increase chance, including mine (I used to farm a lot of rich thorium veins). Maybe now that the engine is different we will get other results? Who knows.

---
There are 2 versions of it. Cat and Bear. Cat is usually strictly pvp and open world grind or dungeons. The cat build is about applying dots. The bear build is to be more viable in raids so it can be a healer and off tank.
---
Except kids today are used to 20 min fortnite/moba matches, not long sometimes frustrating mmo grinds. 
---
Just b/c we were kids when wow came out and loved it, does not mean today's kids will like it.
---
GL on that
---
Creating character and entering game world are separate things. 
---
So it would be logical to allow creating characters via client and disable entering to the world.
---
Also it solves question of downloading client before the release.
---
When you get 40 you get a mount. Then everything becomes much easier.
---
I think that's a silly and sweeping generalisation.
---
MMORPG wasn't exactly the norm for me when I was 13. 20 minute strategy games of Broodwsr/Age of Empires were. Even Castle Rush custom games etc.
---
I don’t understand what’s the sufferance between rppvp and pvp servers. Enlighten me please.
---
Small streamers won't be a problem though
---
I still wouldn't run the cat talents for PvP. If you know you're flexing between DPS and healing in raids, then by all means get the cat talents, but I'd go bear any day.
---
Well, will play mainly with my GF and we will take our time. We also have 2 kids (one 1y old, and I have a son from an older relationship every other week 9y old), both work etc. So we'll play a lot but it will take a few months to lvl up :)
---
Naah. I'll definetly play my Wariror the most and tank a whole host of stuff, but I'll absolutely roll a Shaman and maybe a Hunter, too - both of which getting Alchemy for Arcanite bars!
---
He could potentially die from a blood clot if he hardly moves for 100 hours. I'd rank that as his most likely COD.
---
No, for the simple fact that you'll spend a ton more gold if you only play 1 character. It's super smart to have your "farming/gathering" character (hunter ftw), and your main character, which usually has crafting professions.
---
You know I needed this.
---
I was on a PvE realm when vanilla was out and always wished I had done a PvP realm.
---
 I read comments about a ne priest mind controlling from stealth at the chains in black rock mountain and I was so excited to try it.
---
But the last month I've had maybe 30 mins a day to play and with a new baby figured i might get more for my money playtime wise if I went pve again.
---
But shit man I really should just bite the bullet and go PvP.  I want to do things like this so bad
---
VERY TRUE, EVEN MY GF IS PLAYING WITH US (SHE GOT ME TO PLAY BFA LOL, SHE WOW NERD) SO I'M QUITE OK WITH IT.
---
well a tank can always be hard to find.. but 
---
warrior
---
mage
---
priest
---
I've watched a dog slowly die after being bit by a snake and this is the  saddest thing I've ever seen.
---
I used the gloves and helm for farming all the time... I assumed it helped, but it's quite possible it was just placebo.
---
Damn... that literally makes me depressed. Picture looks like there's been an apocalypse, and the OP is all that's left of what was once a thriving and lively world.
---
if anything blizzard chooses not to ban them often because the pay for xpacs and subs.

German Realm with highest pop

BECAUSE OUR D&amp;D GM "NEEDS" TO PLAY PALADIN IN WOW CLASSIC AND HE'S KIND OF OUR GROUPS GAME NERD LEADER. MY GF HATES HORDE BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL AND ONLY LIKE GOOD LOOKING RACES (SHE HATES DWARFS) AND MY OLDER BROTHER IS LIKE MENTALLY RETARDED (NOT FOR REAL OFC) SO HE ONLY WANNA PLAY GNOME ETC ETC ETC ETC FUCK THEM RIGHT

You're going to get kicked out of a lot of groups.

There's a lot of posts I'm sick of (tons of "here look at my rig!" or "Here's a picture of an old wow guide/disc I found!" posts) but I've accepted that this forum degenerate into a meme factory a while ago. I ignore most of the posts while looking for informative or relevant topics of discussion.
---
Give me a legit reason and I'll take it down. I don't understand / see what the problem is. I'm just trying to help people. ;_;
---
If you have 4 - 5 warlocks then yes, get a healing priest to spec into Shadow Weaving and keep him healing.
---
Having a shadowpriest is not worth it, but having a healer be slightly less efficient at healing while also buffing the warlocks is worth it.
---
From what I seen from the bigger streamers (like asmon and soda) they mostly intend on playing on the same server. That way their fanbases hopefully cancel each other out and they create more content by being on the same server.
---
I don't think the hunter "issues" will matter much. 
---
The real problem with hunters is their poor scaling. They keep getting worse in raids as time goes on. That was the dealbreaker for me.

PVP is the way to go, man. Even if you're late to the curve and worried about high level gankers, you can always switch to a new zone. There's plenty of zones to level in at most level ranges.
---
I have tested this build on my (horde, private server) druid alt. I mostly use my druid (13/33/5) to tank 5mans/20mans and I've done BWL/MC offtanking on it. I have also healed BWL/MC/ZG/5mans on it in moomglow and deep resto spec. in  My main is a very geared tank warrior (horde) but I have also healed a lot on a paladin (retail vanilla/tbc, private server alt). I do not pvp much but I have used a 1/29/21 build to help out with flag carrying when some guild mates needed one, during that time I also did various dungeons in this spec.
---
In my opinion, this is primarily a PvP spec used for flag carrying. It is good for running away but I found it lacking in actual fights where you want to kill someone or keep someone else alive. If you ever want to kill someone it is quite possible to kill some classes with it, as long as you can outlast them because generally the druid toolkit isn't great for just outright murdering someone. Some things like not having reduced shapeshifting cost or omen of clarity can also be annoying.  
---
It is also a okay generalist spec for not-too serious PvE, depending on your talent asignments. For tanking it lacks the 10% melee damage and omen of clarity. This seriously limits your threat output, which is a massive deal especially on horde side. Generally, tanking is usually the role which is least forgiving to any amount of slack. Furthermore, with the limited number of talent points in feral you'll have to make some very tough choices between tank/dps/pvp talents in the feral tree. If you pick all tank talents you'll definitely be able to tank dungeons or maybe offtank a 20man but your DPS and PvP specialisations will suffer.      
---
For DPS you also lack 10% melee damage and omen of clarity, both of which are very considerable decreases to your already very limited DPS. Even if you focus on cat talents over tank/pvp talents you're miles behind already. Generally, druid DPS is a pretty pointless pursuit in my opinion and this just makes it even worse.  
---
For healing you can heal dungeons with it but you lack both the mana efficiency of the moonglow spec and the sheer healing output and flexibility of the deep resto spec. While the additional int from heart of the wild helps a bit with that, it is far from the miracle cure people make it out to be. My druid in mostly T2 gear and a couple of preraid-BiS pieces gains a whole 53 int from it. That's around 800 mana, which is one to three healing spells. In 5mans you can generally drink up between pulls and your pool will last long enough but if your group is trying to go fast or if anything unforeseen happens you're just lacking the sustainability or flexibility the real healing specs have. As with feral talents you'll have to make some hard choices between PvE and PvP talents in the resto tree as well.
---
Overall I think this spec is more of a PvP gimick spec and there are other specs better suited for specialized pvp tasks such as flag-running or mobile healing. For PvE this is a suboptimal spec that is in reality a lot more constraining than people purport it to be. I would not want someone to bring this to the raid.
---
considering the majority of wow players are pot heads, yeah.
---
There's only a limited number of mobs a player of any level can actually kill, you go beyond that level and you can't kill the mob. Of the total number of killable mobs at launch EVERYBODY thinks they're the smartest and can just rush to X area and kill mobs they for some reason think nobody else thought to kill. 
---
The only way to actually start getting ahead of people is to level faster so the range of killable mobs for you is out of range of killable mobs for most other players.
---
That's why so many people are focused on optimizing the 1-20 route, the funny thing is nobody knows what's going to the most optimal until launch plan (although the last stress test will give an idea) because nobody knows how many people are going to "skip that quest and kill mobs on the way to the next quest"
---
I don’t know what that means.
---
Made by noobs for noobs.
---
THE STRUGGLE IS REAL
---
lmao just don’t be a complete toxic asshole and you’ll be fine
---
Or you can take 31/0/20 or 0/31/20 healing priest using rank 1 Mind Blast on CD for Shadow weaving and save 2 debuff slots and avoid fairly bad DPS in your raid :)
---
Starshards are terrible, can't crit, scale poorly and also take a debuff slot.
---
Oh yes....that's the whole purpose.
---
Bloodseeker is generally the easiest to get with a slow attack speed which works well with the Hunter rotation. How fast you can get Rhok depends if you're in a raiding guild but the leaf drops frequently so it's almost a gaurantee if you're raiding for a few months. The Onyxia part might be harder.
---
&gt; Maybe the world was hit by a giant Blizzard
---
It was
---
Probably shouldn't expect to get it... It's not exactly easy or common...
---
He just gave one.. watch the trailer at 0.003x speed and you'll be fine until classic.
---
That’s the joke
---
The amount of players that are dead, "whom we've lost BROTHERS 😭😭", that would have played classic, is the same as people who aren't dead.
---
I don’t remember the report system, but I am curious what has Blizzard done that makes reporting easier in Classic than vanilla ?
---
Long post is long
---
Shamans are around 13-15 % of the horde population, which makes them one of the most played classes, way more popular than priest. However demand is another thing, and raids bring quite many shammys.
---
You guys will complain about fucking anything...
---
You sell the materials you receive from Disenchanting the item. However, early in a server's life those mats won't be worth as much, though once people start seeing high end recipes drop expect some 60s to have need of enchanting mats. To decide mat value vs item vendor value you will simply need to know what level mats you would receive from disenchanting the item and their average value, versus what the vendor price of that item would be. Someone with more hands on knowledge will probably chime in and give you an idea of how to roughly know that information in advance.
---
Just to clarify, we'll be able to make a character on a server in two weeks, but won't be able to play for a month? When will servers be announced?
---
Go lock my dude
---
This only matters solo. If you have a group your Rogue will be fine
---
Am I going crazy, or weren't Star Shards arcane damage anyways?
---
There are add ons that will help you with that. Enchantrix was a popular add on that gave you a good idea of what to expect from disenchants. If you also had auctioneer you could have a good idea of what dust or essence's sell for. 
---
Remember ending enchant mats cost nothing to put on the AH
---
Very hyped for classic here and have been pleasantly drowning in vanilla videos. Can i ask for the channel name?
---
I'm planning on two, but the alt will be a slow leveler throughout phase 2. I plan to make a cheaper character first like a mage. That way I won't have any super hard bis items I need to farm gold for so I'll have more time to level and alt.
---
I will prob only be playing 1 lvl 60 char, but have a slew of Alts. Some may reach 60, but none of them will ever be as geared (or even close to it) as the main.
---
Skarm?
---
Gimping your guild by giving away the best tanking weapon to a non tank is worse than not gearing your tank. 
---
If an item is BIS for Xclass forever and you give it to another class that will replace it you are making a massive mistake.
---
I guess my biggest gripe with your post is that I think that it isn’t good advice for people to “play a role” when they try to fit in to a community that they want to be part of for a longer period of time. 
---
So your when you advise people to pretend to be someone or something they are not (e.g. a girl then you’re not) it is quite likely that it will come back to bite the person listening to that kind of advice.
---
IMO it is always better to be who you are if you want to build long lasting relationships with the people you chose to play with and Classic WoW is THE game for that kind of thing. I’m still (IRL) friends with several people that I met through WoW back in 2005.
---
Ah good for you man! I really should roll something else but aahh it's hard. xD

Its all about being frost for mc/bwl then going fire for aq/nax when crit becomes wanted!

Ah, I didn't look into the rhok thing enough, didn't realise it required raiding. Do you know what the best ranged weapon is that can be obtained without raids? Other than the rank 14 weps of course.

I’m personally going skinning and herbalism.  Will drop skinning for engineering at 60 and have an alt do the alchemy.
---
Why not? It got like a 40% drop rate from Domo. Nearly every hunter who raiding in my Vanilla guild got it. The quest chain certainly wasn't easy but with a bit of help from friends it isn't that bad.
---
I wish I could upvote more than once.
---
Im playing bfa while waiting for classic and its not the case anymore
---
Just make a character named Sodapoppin on every PvP server in the 13th and when you play for real in the 27th you can just pretend to be him and make fanboys give you gold and help you out.
---
And when Blizzard inevitably renames you because Soda wants his name back you can choose whatever name you want and none will be the wiser.
---
500 IQ move right here.
---
Yeah only got time for one and don't care for alts besides bank.
---
Is it worth it for a priest to put 5-7 points in shadow for the 10% stun and 6 more seconds of SWP to add some utility to PvP As a disc/holy spec? 
---
I want to be a supportive player for premade BGs
---
&gt; That doesn't work when the vast majority are middle-upper class rich folk and you're a ghetto'fied psychopath though. 
---
That strawman doesn't really help anyone. 
---
The vast majority of people are just that... people. 
---
Unless you totally suck at any and all social interaction you will be able to build friendships within the game. After all, the first step of building that friendship is already made: You've got a common interest in the game and if you grouped up for any kind of content you got the same goal for a while as well. Build upon that instead of trying to be someone you are not and you'll be fine.

What happens if you fail to kill the raid boss that spawns when you turn in the materials?  I assume you can resummon him freely without having to gather the materials again?

FECK

They don't actually have any test data for anything beyond +5 weapon skill listed (via the github link). I mean yes they have that table with the Defense/Skill delta, but in the 'test breakdown' section it caps out at +5 weapon skill, where the summary is: Target at +3 levels, +5 weapon skill (n=28063). There are some other notes that seemingly confirm that glancing works on a min/max range (and picks an RNG value within the range) rather than a static damage reduction % but that's still not performed with +8, +10 weapon skill as far as I'm aware.
---
Essentially everything assumes that "Beaza" is right (and people are saying that this is the data, it looks like it matches "Beaza's equations" therefore Beaza must be right). **There isn't a 'blue link' at all on the subject matter.**
---
From the same github (via archived linkes) [there was this post](https://web.archive.org/web/20061024232100/http://evilempireguild.org:80/guides/glancing.php) which apparently was a guild-write-up for warrior PvE, (21 July 2006). Neither (this, or other data) actually give us the sample dataset to work with but this guide has a difference in outcome to "Beaza's formula".
---
Until they actually do a +8, +10 weapon skill test (or a blue post) there's no confirmation on the subject matter and whilst I'm open there being a min/max damage reduction range all of it is still referencing the same wowwiki post and even within the post itself the information is not consistent, e.g.
---
&gt; With +5 hit and +10 skill its
---
&gt; 5.2% block for say 80% damage (depends on a lot of things)
---
&gt; 25.2% crit for 200% damage (impale doesnt work!)
---
&gt; 40% glancing blow for 100% damage
---
Sorry for potato quality.
---
Player skill matters more than anything. I’m the only raiding nelf rogue on my pserver. The rest are human. In my guild only one human rogue can beat me on the meter and it’s not by much. They have better swords than I do because they got luckier than I did. From what I can tell it’s really not a very big difference. 
---
Play what you want. Be happy as a nelf. You will still get to raid.
---
Why? I don’t get this. It’s a city that you no longer have to go to. There’s other major city’s. 
---
Ironforged was packed because it had the only auction house for alliance. Not because there was a “sense of community on the server” or any nostalgia reasons you can think of. 
---
Go to any major city that’s relevant in the expansion and you will see hundreds. Don’t go to a zone that’s over 10 years old.
---
I think it scales better with increased stats

No idea dude. Sometimes if the first couple people downvote because they don't understand the joke, a bunch will follow along.
---
This works i have a female toon that has been carried since MoP
---
It's *far* from perfect, but I did my best. He wanted one that was larger (especially wider) than what he could find online.

Link to where the 4% number is shown? Classic DB shows it at 8% with a full loot table. Given that Spinal Reaper isn't in on launch, there are 3 items in group 7 drops on Rag. Likely it's going to be around a 12% drop rate.
---
My original wow classic rouge still has all his gear from those days even trinkets/regents you cant get anymore. I felt my time with him was locked away if i left him be.
---
FUCK YOUR LIFE DUDE, JUST KIDDING BUT ALSO FUCK THAT SHIT
---
I started in BC so that explains how I didn't know
---
What happened to the ClassiCast podcast?  They were releasing them pretty regularly when we had close to zero info about Classic, pretty much ever since the beta's release it's been dead silence.
---
I will main one character. But level 4-6 characters through out the life span of the game. After farming enough gold and getting done with the raid will level alts. Sadly i want to tank so farming gold will not be easy at all. And i need to keep myself from rerolling after getting stomped in wpvp by everyone
---
Never had a problem finding groups or guilds just do not be a ass and bring some sort of benifit to youre guild besides just showing up on raid nights. Stuff like helping guild members get attuned farming mats or hydraxian rep can go a long way.
---
If you plan on doing mostly healing then blackout isnt a necessity. It really only shines when a target is SWP + Mindflay + Mindblast combo'd.
---
True. I guess it is irrelevant to ignore reasoning for why it’s empty.
---
&gt; If there is a cash shop in classic,
---
There isn't.
---
I prefer guild hordes
---
For Alliance, I usually do a mix of Tanaris, Hinterlands, and Searing Gorge.
---
We have a quest chain or two in the Gorge that are Alliance only. Great experience bump.
---
Then why was Ironforge so populated back in Wrath and Cata, huh? What was the reason to be there when there was Dalaran and new continents?
---
This is a very important point. I'm actually quite surprised that most priest guides don't discuss the issue of push-back and how it affects their leveling process.
---
I always loved brother sister guilds cooperation. It was always super fun for me to do split runs and stuff.
---
Dishonorable kills, yuck
---
I have been playing my same toon since vanilla to this day. It’s kinda hard for me to consider playing classic since me and my toon have been through so much, doesn’t seem right to start over again.  I’m not an alt type person, though I was leveling 2 additional warlocks because you could only be one spec sooooooooo. Now I can be any spec warlock so the other 2 are trapped in time. Decisions decisions....
---
Do you mean USA ? the continent
---
Difference is, this video covers the basics and is relatively short. Skarm's pve bear deep dive guide is perfect, but it's 2.5 hrs long.
---
Thr agility scales with gear better but the 5% ranged damage is good with meh gear.
---
The real problem is trueshot aura
---
That's fair.  I enjoyed throwing out a huge block for the shock value, but here is a cleaner format.
---
I know that sounds harsh, but you're going to want to get the quest outside in the central area of the mountain (the room before you climb down the chains) to get the key. Go back inside to rez, turn left and kill the fire elemental and then go to the hallway with the dwarves - left again. You should see the big nasty rock boss at the end - you're going to be killing him. 
---
Afterwards, go back to the entrance and take the small hallway into the wide-open area with dwarves and dogs all wandering around. Through the room slightly turning right to get to a stealthed NPC that will prompt you to kill the bitch in the back of the walled-in area behind him. 
---
After you've killed her, go ahead and go into the hallway behind her and clear the arching area to the left which will lead you back into the wide-open area with the dogs and dwarves. There will be another arching hallway immediately to your right - clear all of that to get the boss in a room in the back as well as the possiblity of a rare-ish boss that wanders here. 
---
Just before you finish the arch spits you back out into the wide open area, there is a doorway leading into a circular arena area. Doors will shut on you when you enter. Finish the event, then leave through the other door (on the left wall as positioned from where you came in). 
---
Go upstairs and hook a U-turn immediately at the top of the ramp to go into the area above the arena - straight through to the back hallway - take a right. This dead ends into a boss that will have the finish of the key quest at the statue. 
---
Turn around and go the other way at the fork and cross the bridge. Take a left when you've entered the rooms and go down the ramp to a right that leads you to an open, circular area. There's a (sometimes) miniboss in the right room of this area. Go ahead and open up the vaults on the wall. If you have enough keys from mob drops so far, do the event after you've opened them up. 
---
Leave the room and to the right again, this will spit you into a cavern area that will be dwarves and rock elementals, leading down and to the left. A boss roams this area and will lead into the bottom part of the circular area you were just in. 
---
After the boss, keep going in the same direction and you'll be met with large double doors. If they're closed (I can't remember what causes them to close, but it happens), just kill yourself and run back to the entrance to rez. If it's open, go through and start killing dwarves to get back to the entrance - this is the area you first went through to kill the giant rock boss (Golemagg? I don't remember his name). 
---
Turn in quests and whatnot, but then head through the first gate as if you were going back to the rock boss, but take an immediate right through the door. Here you can use your key to open up the door. In this room, stick to the left of the ramp and clear to the back of the room where there is a large mechanism - looks like a huge gear attached to some sort of oil pump looking lever. Now go back to the ramp in this room. 
---
You might recognize the arena where you took a U-turn earlier - now head to the left and through the hallways. You'll pass through a doorway that was opened when you hit the oil pump looking thing moments ago. This hallway dumps you into a room with dwarves and fire elementals. There is a downstairs area on the left that has a boss, then an area that has a bunch of gnomes and mechs on the right - there is a small room straight ahead with a boss and some mechs to accompany him. 
---
Afterwards, take the right exit across a bridge with fire elementals into a bar. You can go into the room on the left in the bar and smash up some kegs for a quest, then also talk to ribbly (is it ribbly?) for another quest. If it's not ribbly, it's just a specifically named dude just outside the keg room with a couple of cronies. Call him a jerk and kick his ass. 
---
Then go to the upstairs area of the bar. Buy the limited supply ale from the bartender and give them to the named dwarf nearby. You'll give him 2 of these drinks 3 separate times and he'll start messing with the large kegs. After he's messed with all of them, one of them will blow out the spigot and break open the door in the next area - which should activate the golem boss in the corner. After killing the golem, go ahead and smash up the bartender - he's a boss, too. Beware that all of the mobs in the bar will want to kill you after you down the boss. 
---
Head out into the newly opened door and to the left. There will be a boss in an open room with grates all over the floor on the right. Take the left afterwards and there is a two level room with a bunch of golems. There can be a rare boss in here. 
---
Take the lower level on the left, wrapping back to the right and into what looks like a crypt area. Walk through the room to the NPC on the upper level and tell him that he's a turd. He'll start calling in dwarves around the room one-at-a-time, ninja style and then attack when you've killed the others. Loot the big chest just before the newly opened door on the upper level. 
---
In this next area there will be a hallway to the right with an instance door - this leads to molten core. Don't go in the instance doorway, but you can collect the item needed for molten core attunement if you have that quest. 
---
Then go back out and to the right through a door that opens into an area with a shit ton of dwarves. These dwarves respawn fast af, so don't dawdle. You're looking for the dwarves with the red shirts - they carry torches. You need two, but if you find one start heading towards the far end of this area turning right as if you were standing at the door you used to enter. There will be a raised area with a fire elemental and a brazier - use your torch. Find the other red shirt dwarf for a torch and light the other brazier. 
---
Doors open near the brazier that leads into a room with a big golem boss and fire shooting out of the walls. Try to dodge the fire while killing the boss. Doors open up behind the boss into the final room. 
---
Kill all of the dwarves here before pulling the boss. Or don't because that's hilarious, but you'll have to rez and run back. If you are alliance and have the quest to save the princess, don't kill her when fighting the dwarf. If you couldn't give a shit about that, make sure to kill her first.
---
Jesus christ how horrifying
---
Hopefully an EU RP/PvP server.
---
Also, is it 12/13th for character pre-registration
---
Now I can't help it but imagine a bunch of huge orc warriors fighting the alliance with giant cheese graters.
---
It was common back in the day for 2 or three guilds to make deals and raid together. This is just people anticipating common problems ahead of time.
---
Gee. Do I really have to explain why people were in IF during cata?😂😂
---
Why didn’t you name tbc, or wod, or mop? Because they had their own major city for that expansion?
---
Of course it's good, but you don't sit in cat form even as full feral. You need the other talents
---
There was a class population survey done back awhile ago here. They have plans on re-doing the server as I remember. Does anyone have information on that?
---
RP-PvP
---
If not, RP.
---
I like when people use their brain. Good job. The only thing better would be if he typed every other letter capitalized to solidify my theory that people that do that are my least favorite people on the internet.
---
Besides crafting alts I will more than likely stick with my Dwarf Pally for as long as I play.
---
This is why I love paladin.  As a true hybrid you can tank (dungeons at least), heal, and fend for yourself in the open world fairly well.
---
Looking for opinions I played vanilla wow a lot, favorite by far. I started out as a rogue then ended it off with arms warrior as main. Want to play a priest from start or another support class but not 100$ as classic leveling is a feat in it self. Also play to play horde as i went ally before with IRL friends. Just looking for some feed back on being a priest or maybe shaman/pally? as heals or would a priest be a better bet. Thing is i never made it pass 41 as a priest, since vanilla.
---
blackout could be worth it if you have the troll racial
---
otherwise i dont think so, 5 points is a lot of investment
---
That is adorable.
---
You are a keeper.
---
Since I'm rolling a druid I have it all covered. I can AoE grind, not 20 mobs though, but the real gold maker will be dancing naked in stormwind fountain. I can stealth around like a rogue. I can tank as a bear. I can do everything. I'm really looking forward to playing my tauren male druid!
---
The standard PvP dagger spec requires you to go deep into Combat to get Improved Sprint, a necessary ability to make rogue viable in pvp, it releases slows so you can get away or in range. 
---
With Gnome PvP dagger I can avoid going deep into Combat and instead get Cold Blood, Full 3 points into Improved Sap and 1 point in Dirty Deeds(reduces energy cost on Cheap Shot). 
---
Escape ability has a 1 minute Cooldown which makes it insane. Also Vanish is usually used agressivelly by top-tier Rogue vanilla players. 
---
For example, Open with Cheap Shot, Backstab, Eviserate(Cold Blood makes it 10x better), Vanish, Ambush, Backstab, Full Kidney. 
---
Most players will die by the Ambush/Backstab and if not you have a 5 point kidney lined up.
---
That's why I picked Blackrock back in the day
---
Gf of the year award
---
interesting. Private servers must be getting it completely wrong then because this definitely is not common knowledge among the feral druid community with all the people thinking this talent is shit. 
---
If true, thick hide is INSANELY good.
---
Its not. 
---
Mythic in retail works the same as other difficulties woth the exception of no cross realms. Your character gets locked to the individual bosses, you can still kill those bosses in another raid but wont get loot.
---
Classic.. if you killed a boss, then you were locked to that raids ID. Meaning you couldnt finish up in someone elses run. 
---
If you pug in classic and plan to finish up on Monday. That pug can tuŕn around, make a group and clear your dungeon.
---
One main for me, and one to lvl with my cousin together
---
Warlock is a farming god though
---
&gt; And then that rogue will replace it not long after with better dps weapons in AQ40/Naxx.
---
Unless I'm totally wrong it's bis all the way to Naxx so that's quite a long time. Of course even then it should never go to dps before MT and even the second one should probably go to OT. Still I'm sure hardcore guilds will run MC with smaller teams to maximize the amount of Thunderfuries and lucky ones will probably get some for their rogues, possibly even furies althouth I'm not sure if retail tanks can do enough threat for the furies to use it for anything other than tanking.
---
&gt; Gee. Do I really have to explain why people were in IF during cata
---
Please do.
---
After all, we still have a month to kill.
---
No imp SWP if you’re a troll since you’ll use Hex to fish for Blackout procs. 
---
I’m considering only putting one point into Blackout as UD. The proc chance is much lower but could still clutch save me paired with Touch of Weakness.
---
I think Blizz has this weird hang up about classic wow, and thinks that if it does well it some how reflects poorly on them as designers because of where the game has gone since then. While I do believe classic wow is better than the new stuff I think a lot of that has to do with the expansions requiring the game to change over time to make it more playable for such a long time. If blizz was smart, they'd just restart wow from classic and keep rereleasing xpacs after a couple years. It would take 14 years to get to BFA. They could repeat the whole thing for an entirely new generation that never played it the first time.
---
How the hell does a priest sneak in.
---
You could BURN the bottom 😲 Idk how that would turn out but oooooo
---
Also it looks amazing and I’m sure this means a lot to him GG
---
Auction house. Most people aren’t engineers, and couldn’t use Dalaran, MoP’s, or current city’s too date really.
---
Also, since SW’s rework in Cata, there were more optimal mailboxes / auction house - banks in SW.
---
Has nothing to do with player count unless you’re on a dead server.  IF is basically dead outside of RP servers because the only reason people need it is for heirlooms vendor.
---
Meanwhile, SW is pretty heavy, and Kul’tiras you can’t move without touching someone. 
---
To top that off, since 8.2 their had been a massive resurgence (and due to classic) for people trying to do stuff NOT related to raid content. (People are having a lot of fun in the mechagon stuff, so a lot of people there trying to get new mounts / toys ect) 
---
Thankfully classic is waking up some people at blizzard. Yes, Activision is bad. But people really need to focus on wanting the game (and classic) to be better, not waste their time needlessly complaining about stuff they don’t even know about.
---
Dude. You can’t say those cities were populated in WoD and then bring up 8 mil as the numbers.
---
We knew the numbers in wod and they were not even close to 8 mil. But sure. Keep talking to me as if I don’t know the game when you think old cities were packed back in wod with 8 mil players.

---
I think they're justifying grieifing by virtue of it being hilariously fun.
---
Yep they can do deeps though, ive seen logs from good guilds with a shadow priest smack dab at the top. They are especially good for speed runs (which is a thing in the vanilla community) because they can just dump mana at that point.
---
Seems a little strange to me, if you all wanted  to play together wouldn't you all just join the same guild? I guess because you have multiple people really attached to the idea of being a guild leader?  
---
Either way it should be fine. Either have a large guild and you have smaller discord channels for groups of friends, or smaller guilds with a large discord channel for organising groups/raids/levelling cross guild.
---
Warlocks are way easier to gear because they don't need tier 2. They're great DPS but are indeed weaker than mages in similar gear. If not being top DPS makes you feel "worthless", roll warrior.
---
By the way, hit on phase 1-2 is just as much of an issue for mages.
---
I got distracted and combined two thoughts.  I meant specifically for tanking.
---
How does stalking around a dungeon solo desperately trying not to aggro anything sound more fun then grouping up packs of things and killing them all at once single-handedly?
---
Not sure why you were downvoted. That’s what I’m likely doing for the same reasons.
---
Delusional
---
NEED A ROGUE?
---
Because some people don’t want to accept that sometimes Tanks need to spec fury to not be useless.

[This dude](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ/videos)
---
&gt; Nobody is gonna raid 2hand fury with a mace either
---
Somebody will. Maybe not in the top percent but someone will. However that somebody is still leagues better for a dps slot than an enhancement shaman.
---
agree to disagree
---
I'm going to see which one has the most girl names
---
That is true. However point stands its a pvp weapon and warrior shouldnt have priority.

In case you haven't found it by now :)
---
You have no idea whats going on in classic LUL
---
I'm sure you'll eventually get over it.
---
If you have some friends or guildies just do a dungeon, or join a group on the same quest.
---
Do pvp....so much interaction and fun cross faction play you would be missing out on...it really is the complete experience.
---
A certain connotation
---
If classic is a big success they will release new content that was intended but never finished.
---
SAME FOR ME BRO.  ITS LIKE THEY KNEW AND THEY JUST WANTED US TO EAT A BIG SHIT BURGER.  WHY AM I GOING TO SCHOOL ANYWAY?  FOR A BETTER LIFE?  I JUST WANT TO PLAY WOW.  SHOULD I QUIT?  THESE ARE QUESTIONS I HAVE.  SOMEONE HELP

Wowhead wasn't created until patch 1.11, the regular site doesn't have data older than that. Every single item in the game will read as added in patch 1.11 or later, so it's not a reliable site to look up those things.

As a 30/0/21 shaman at 60. Which raid will I have to go full resto or can I pretty much run that the entire time and just be put with melee groups? Also how will pvp for me be going in fresh?

---
He, as many others have was using the argument that the fact that you play, no matter the amount of times means you are worth marketing to. Now maybe I’m jumping to his conclusions, but I’m basing that off of the several conversations I’ve had on this same thread addressing that same argument which started with the same type of initial comment. I probably did respond overly aggressive, but I did not start that way and if he had read the other comments then it’s deserved, if he only saw my first comment and hit reply without seeing the rest then so be it, that’s on me. However nobody else that started with this was doing it tangentially, but instead was trying to use this as evidence to back their opinions on the need for mass marketing. And if it’s not addressing me, who would it be addressing? It’s a reply that’s countering my opinion. He’s not adding something, or sharing a different thought or providing a new narrative to a 3rd party reader. He’s directly replying to what I said. 
---
I do appreciate your comment though, we all too often, especially on Reddit, allow other conversations to have an influence on a current conversations and it’s never a bad idea to step back and think am I replying to this person specifically or am I generalizing
---
Depends how you look st it if your goal is to basically have one main then its inefficient. Me i will have my main plus alts that are there to strengthen and feed my main for example my main will be a tailor but i aldo plan on getting several alts lvled up so they can help feed my main a steady supply of mooncloth. So jumping on a alt is still efficient for me.
---
its super low prio so the slow falls off to deep wounds but the channel stays up
---
So, I'm actually not a big fan of guilds itself, because that implies need for social interactions. When I want to play a game I usually have a certain goal and want to meet people that I need to reach them, because I'm already being social with them, it needs no others.
---
This being said, I like cooperations to form Raid Groups. I don't really mind joining another guild for that though. In Classic I'll at least start with a group of 4-8 people which might increase but I don't really care if it does. After reaching 60 we'll go for Raid Prep and maybe find a Raid / Guild on the way.
---
anything before phase 2, you really dont want to lvl a alt when ganking gives honor and theres no bgs

you can look up logs  from recent kills or even for the past few years at the very least its been known that shadow priest can top the meters.
---
its not just %hit they just do shitty dps before having good gear because the coefficient of shadow bolt is super high, but are essential for raids and good in dungeons
---
Yeah it amazes me sometimes. And I even get downvotes for saying that xD amazing.
---
Maybe for nightelves, not particularly necessary for taurens with warstomp.
---
I know that mentality Well. When used to play TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) mod in CS:GO. I'd cause cause chaos from across the map with one good head shot by a silenced pistol, and watch the bloodbath ensue.
---
Nothing more satisfying then 5 people on the same team opening fire on each other in single second of surprise and terror.
---
if your worried about meters dont be a lock.
---
Umm you should look at the math behind hunter damage. 5% damage is INSANELY better at all levels of play in terms of pure damage.
---
At least there will be PvP montages to watch this time around.

I thought they weren't making language-specific realms, but just English ones for EU. Did that change??
---
It's not so much that people are attached to being a guild leader but more so keeping the integrity of the core values your guild lives by and each guild has a different environment. It's kind of like if you have a group of friends that you like to hang out with once in a while but wouldn't want them to live in the same house together.
---
Classic DB is a private server DB, also calm down before you pop a vein.

I will level my alt using mainly rested XP.
---
I'M AWAY ON HOLIDAY FOR LAUNCH. IN FUCKING WALES!!
---
Yeah I've only ever played one character at a time. I can't do the alt thing because I always feel like I'm just wasting time that could be used to advance my main.
---
Are we ever really "geared as you want to be" though? I don't recall ever feeling done with my priest in Classic. Maybe because I was raiding, though.
---
Yeah I'm set on a priest and figured shadow in the open world will be much more fun than a ret paladin was.
---
Why would you take Thick Hide? You will be armor capped in BWL and there are much better things to spend your points on. You could easily go bear/cat picking up all the necessary points while also being more flexible for your raid when they don't need all the tanks. Thick hide is so marginal it's not even funny
---
obviously they're all going to roll on the same server
---
For casters there is a totem called tranquil air totem and it IS salvation. That is why Horde raids run 7 shamans.

Not MC related but trolling, the Dwarf model completely covers the original goblin model
---
A dwarf can completely cover any of the neutral flightpoints leading to many accidental right click attacks even with the horde spending minutes trying to click through the model/camera manipulation
---
This makes my head hurt
---
The true vanilla experience
---
Some items (that are generally VERY strong) got added to the loot tables in later patches, perdition's blade being one of those.
---
Another example is spellweaver's turban from general drakkisath in ubrs, which is BY FAR the best caster head until mish'undare from nefarian in bwl, but that isn't being added until phase 5 since it was added to the game in patch 1.10.

Bubble hearth

Back in Vanilla WoW, I was notorious in my circle of friends for ALWAYS rerolling toons and switching between them. I had to play three times as much as my friends just to keep up. 
---
It wasn't until I FINALLY settled on maining my rogue did I reach lvl 60. Then I switched to Druid so I can tank, pvp, and heal with just one toon. 
---
So I'm going to create the "father" of my old Druid when classic is released lol I've learned my lesson, just one character until he hits cap.
---
The spirit healer is right down the elevator though so they wont have to walk for long
---
&gt;What should i get/do 
---
Get professional help
---
I always thought rushing to max level was the best idea but I just get focused and bored when I'm so far away. I find if I don't focus on level and also on professions even fishing I enjoy myself a lot more and the time to reach cap seems shorter(it's not but I'm doing more than hyperfocusing on that xp bar.
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
Dude youre a good ass girlfriend
---
Yet many of these were not in 1.2 and added as vanilla progressed. As such, hope they only take out quests that are linked to content releasing later and all the new hubs and later added quests are 1.12.
---

Feral bear is not try hard at all lol, you have 3 buttons and an on use weapon. That's it. It's by far the easiest tank to do well with, you just won't be optimal in every situation

Please tell me drugs were involved in creating this.
---
his net worth is probably sub-zero
---
Hopefully we'll get a server list and a straw poll here, I want to play on a fairly popular, but not most popular, Alliance-sided PvP server.
---
Pretty sure you can't server transfer in Classic
---
There's such a thing as too much, and that flag is a good representation of that.
---
I'd say they are good at fights under two minutes and decent at fights under three minutes and pretty trash on fights above that. However very few fights are you continually dpsing for that long, so there usually is some time to recover mana and wait for potion cooldowns. Patchwerk is probably the most obvious example of where spriests are really bad.
---
Nah. It seems a fair amount of them play Alliance. I'll be rolling Horde on a PVP server so its open fucking season.
---
Selling gold became much more rare to be advertised. But still a lot going on. Anyways, you can sell runs well that way. :)
---
Yeah, that's the problem. I know I'll want the best gear, which means T3, which would literally take me 10 years to do on one main char.
---
I think that's enough
---
Wondering why you didn't include the mats that Gloom'Rel requires to teach you Dark Iron Smelting?
---
I heart Azshara.
---
Oh well 😂
---
you're agreeing with him, he's saying shifting in classic is better than future expansions where each spec just stayed in one form all the time.
---
The things I missed most rolling any other class was water and teleport.
---
I can't really add any knowledge here, just kinda sighed out loud over the fact that no comments actually discuss the actual topic of the post, but plenty of comments discuss the viability of shadow...
---
You'll need more then caffeine to do this feat.
---
Especially on a druid, you're looking at non-stop playing for at least 6 days.
---
Plainsrunning.
---
So does MM, Humanoid Slaying is easily accessible regardless of spec.
---
This post hits me in the feels. 29 more days until bliss.
---
I miss the old days.
---
It's clear you actually played the class, I agree with everything here except for one point: You can easily heal dungeons with this spec, I've healed plenty of time just running my cat/bear spec (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxhhsfddtV)
---
You might not be helpful on a Strat Live orb run but that's about it, you could easily heal anything else.
---
Maybe you all just suck at leveling ever think of that? During vanilla I leveled to 60 a night elf rogue, an orc rogue, an undead rogue, a dwarf priest, and an undead priest and the rogues hit 60 a considerable amount faster. This argument is laughable especially since none of you will admit you played on a pve server when I have only ever played pvp like the game was supposed to be played.      
---
Maybe none of our decade old anecdotes matter but I can tell you hwat I will get 60 before you.
---
never experienced those.
---
can someone please explain each of those what it means?
---
what does it do? how long do they last? anything..
---
It will not work out the way you think it will.
---
Unless you are the diabolical mastermind behind this.
---
One guild will field 25+ raiders, and pickup a few players to fill out the roster, this will happen at the earliest possible point in time, because everyone wants to raid right?
---
So the natural consequence is that generally, the most prepared/competent players will be the first one's leveled, geared and attuned appropriately.
---
Now the natural folow on consequence to this will be that your entire guild alliance's best players just formed a raid, and will be locked to it.
---
The alliance will either be entirely unable to field a second raid, or it will likely be a parody raid.
---
Eventually there will be one guild, with  enough people to raid, and it's leaders will be the people running the primary raid.
---
And a few social club guilds.
---
Tbh a lot of guilds did do this. The game always played out the same way. Guild A and guild B would encounter similiar issues and form some sort of alliance to help each other. Both guilds eventually would just say fuck it and merge. The merge guild would then have never ending drama over the span of a month or two. The guild would dissolve and a new smaller guild would form and the rest of the players would be absorbed into other guilds.
---
Form what I remember the gold faming was mostly bots, they would set out a number of them in high level zones like Azshara to grind mobs all day. These would often be hunters, you can spot a bot a mile off and are no match for a player on a PvP servers.
---
Best thing to do when you see one is to kill their pet and leave the bot. It will summon its pet back and you kill its pet again, eventually the bot wont be able to summon its pet any longer and will stand on the spot just whistling as it doesn't have commands to do anything until the pet is called. 
---
Obviously report bots but also try to disable them if you can.
---
30/0/21 is ele/resto, not enhance
---
The game is shit now, I think that is why people are sad
---
I CAN'T WAIT! I'M SO HYPED. AAAAAAARGH I HAVEN'T PLAYED SINCE 2010!! BARRENS CHAT!! BGS!! WORLD PVP!! ANNOYING ALLIANCE GNOMES YOU WANNA PUNT ACROSS A ROOM!! I WANNA MELT FACES!!! FOOOOOOOOOOR THE HORDE!!!!
---
Machine learning tells us retail has under 2m subs so about 200k active players at any time? Very low anyway, no wonder because it’s trash
---
Winter Squid anyone?
---
have you seen the guy that made that blacklist post? /u/BeethovenTheMage? yeah, his reddit account got banned. and he deleted all of his posts outside of the thread. and edited his previous post to say rude stuff about one of the mods here.
---
I'm aware.  I'm telling him his options if he wants to raid.  Ele has 0 chance of happening.
---
Yes, they're in from launch
---
You're forgetting the nightmare of actually getting 40 people to show up. Guilds will probably take anyone who can play for 3 hours without falling asleep at the keyboard unless theyre massive guilds with people to spare.
---
When you decide let me know and I'll play the other. I'm caught in the same decision and for the life of me I can't choose one.
---
They DID give the word it's just not the answer you were looking for. That word was no RP-PVP.
---
I was the complete opposite.  I was the only one that couldn't bring myself to go through the grind of leveling an alt. Until I decided to make a lock twink and the class was so much damn fun I painlessly got to 60. Now I have to face knowing I gotta level two because both classes are part of me.
---
The consensus is the ignite mage(s) will be ahead, then the warlock, then the rest of the mages. So yeah it depends on how you attribute the ignite damage I guess. At any rate it's very close. There's no level at which warlocks definitively stronger than mages.
---
Nice.
---
I think this will make a lot of sense in the first couple of months not everyone is going to sprint straight to 60.   Some guild members are going to be ready for raids before others.
---
Any spec Druid should leverage every form, if you’re going into feral. Feral charge is probably the most powerful pvp move for druids against casters and you’ll be spending a ton of time in bear form, you’ll be in cat to open and to apply bleeds (very rarely burst dps with a MCP). 
---
Perhaps check out Revery, Skarm, powerfulnoun, Shedothedruid or Ebbn’s content on Druid PVP. 
---
Honestly you’re best bet is to HotW/NS for world PvP but if your heart is set on being a poor mans rouge you’ll want to spec into all the cat talents in feral, Furor, omen of clarity and Natural Shapshift and get ready to live in Gnomer farming MCP.
---
You can atleast play 2, even if one is still leveling your playing it.  
---
3 toons it's something else...
---
Yeah it's not just +hit, warlocks have huge mana problems early on, because life tap scales with + dmg. With no + damage gear you have to lifetap basically for every 1.5 shadowbolts, so your dps tanks very hard when you run oom.
---
Overwatch, GTA online, Civilization, Anno 1800
---
I really want to burn it. And maybe wipe my ass on the ashes a little bit. Which means you did a great job!
---
For the Alliance!
---
Listen to him, play other classes
---
15 years ago Alliance seemed to outnumber Horde on practically every server.
---
Guess it depends on your goals. If you want to make it just your second character, you'll never get there until you have actual bis. But if I just wanted a character that could kill random mobs faster than my main then I'd be happy without even getting raid gear.
---
Yea had that same reaction, i was on my 3rd character plan and realized okay maybe just start with the first one and see how much time you have for it.
---
damn, this is too real.
---
Dammn got twice the amount of work to do :P
---
Stellaris
---
If you p'ay feral you'll look to a fat ass bear 95% of the time in dungeon anyway
---
This guy is right, if you want to live in cat form go rouge. The reason to roll Druid is to have a SHIT load of tools for any situation and use the right tool for the job. 
---
From all the comments on here i think the poster is going to be pissed when he gets to 60 and learns that druids spec for cat and not rogues that can heal themselves.
---
Literally every class has something, that was part of vanilla class design. I won't name all, but:
---
- paladin: bubble where you're literally invincible, bubble+heart, lay on hands as a great "panic, save the day" button, seals &amp; judgements rotation, +4 movement speed talent, flash of light
---
- hunter: eyes of the beast, feign death, the whole pet kit, aspects (cheetah, pack)
---
- rogue: vanish, stealth, lock-picking, pickpocketing, poisons
---
- mage: ice block, conjure water, blink, create portals (!), arcane intellect
---
- warlock: summon (!), fear, seduce, banish
---
- druid: innervate, battle res, the whole shapeshifting stuff (travel form, etc.), in general versatility to be any role
---
- priest: idk much, but mind control, physic scream, ressurect, pw: shield and fortitude, shackle undead
---
- warriors: shield wall, last stand, taunt(!), charge, stance dancing, the whole rage mechanic
---
- shaman: idk much, but resurrection and chain heal are pretty unique and awesome, as well as totems
---
&lt;banned from R classic wow&gt;
---
WoD went down to 4-5m later because people realized that it's shit and people made fun of Blizz so they're not releasing sub numbers anymore. I'm pretty sure BfA has MAXIMUM 2.5m players but I'm pretty sure it's not more than that.
---
"Why does Tanaris...look like a lake?" 
---
Yeah exactly this isn't Cata. 
---
...Too soon?
---
Witcher 3, Cave Story, Hollow Knight, Bastion, Age of Empires 2 multiplayer (its still around), Deponia series, Dark Souls, Hyper Light Drifter, Don't starve, FEZ, Oddworld Package, Psychonaughts, Risk of Rain, Papers Please, Transistor, Undertale, Valiant Hearts, Warframe
---
I recommend All of these
---
It's pretty clear this one is being brigaded by people who refuse to do the research and simply assume they're right over someone with years of experience on the matter, thanks to all the people that were decent human beings, I won't be responding to this post anymore.
---
nah just hyper autism
---
:) That's a thoughtful arts and crafts gift for the bf. The handmade feel of it fits in with the Horde honestly.
---
yeah for sure but they're not fun like shaman.  there is no better feeling than purging a mage's shields, absorbing their pom-poly or whatever with grounding totem, and then 2-shotting them
---
For rogue weapons you want a slow main hand (relative to weapon type) for your instant attacks such as sinister strike and backstab, and a fast offhand for more poison procs.
---
Not anymore😢
---
When wow originally came out i played a ton of different games ever since i really do not play console games anymore. The only games i seem to care for is WOW, The elder scrolls games and Civilization.
---
No. I think you misinterpreted what I asked.
---
There are polls / surveys re: class population.
---
Here is link to analysis of main one:

---
I just don’t see it being that profitable at launch though. People wanting to buy/tip are barely going to have any money and it’s almost always better to just level and earn your own money from higher level mobs at an earlier time.
---
Jesus man be happy about 25-30.  I’m lucky trying to get 10!
---
its getting a remake not a remaster
---
All x/2-30/x builds are pvp/5-man builds. Raids want LotP.
---
Perhaps only one parent in the household plays WoW and handles the kids the other nights?  Like a team.
---
Here we go with "girlfriend made me" posts
---
They had to name the class "monk" because Chuck Norris was taken.
---
Just remember, Chuck Norris's boggart is Neville Longbottom.
---
No they didn't? It was asked months ago in a QnA, they said it wasn't planned at the time for launch but welcomed feedback on the matter. How is that a No for you?
---
YOU ARE NOT PREPA.... scratch that, looks like you are.
---
I appreciate this. [https://www.youtube.com/c/galator](https://www.youtube.com/c/galator)
---
Or maybe they both play woW but are on different taid team nights and switch off on kid care.
---
There is a cheese grater in your near future.
---
Did someone say [Chuck Norris, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
I thought the Isle of Q-D was a fun spot, always very hotly contested and lots of random PVP happening, but also great rewards so you were incentivized to try and do it.  At least they disabled flying there otherwise it would have been a total shitshow. 
---
I feel like daily quests added a cool element BUT Blizz went way overboard and made it a huge part of the game.  Maybe a few random optional daily objectives to provide fun gameplay elements, rather than dozens of nearly-required-in-order-to-progress types of grinds.
---
https://i.imgflip.com/36q99v.jpg
---
A lot! Blood Elves are in TBC though. And a lot of people roll horde just because the server is so much more immersive when it comes to World PvP.
---
Also op has missed out on the fact that those keywords means they understand if you have to miss a night.
---
.....and mana totem
---
Servers don't go down for maintenance every Tuesday lol
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
The first thing I saw in beta within seconds of zoning into barrens was a Chuck Norris joke. It was glorious.
---
MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION
---
So when do you want to raid?  Middle of the night? During the day?   
---
Why do you assume both parents raid or the raiding parent is the sole parent and there is nobody else? 
---
Sleeping kids don't really need taking care of either so raiding late is perfect.
---
Family friendly means, if you go afk during the raid because your kid requires attention you don't get gkicked or same with missing a raid.
---
If its like true classic the servers will go down for extended  maintenance and be offline til the evening. 
---
Also several servers will just die for 3 days. Khadgar vanilla launch represent.
---
How do you miss a night when raids always start early and you will always have kids to take care of? That makes no sense
---
Just because someone is raiding or playing does not equate to they are not taking care of the kids you could say the same thing about a parent watching tv or being engrossed in a book. Its not hard to cook dinner before raiding put on a movie for a child or just let them entertain themselves for a little while. There is also other family members siblings that can help.
---
Not sure if it's the right place to ask, but...
---
Would I lose a lot of dps, as a mage, by getting tier sets instead of aiming for bis?
---
I'm not planning to go super hardcore or anything, but I don't want to be a dead weight.
---
Yes because early in one is still early in all.
---
I took another look at the specs. I think you're discounting killer instinct. It's 3% extra crit, then 15% extra agility, and with 20 points in marksman, you're getting the 5% crit chance anyways. Looking at the pro/con of deep survival, if you stack a lot of agility you're seeing a great deal of return when it comes to crit chance.
---
You're the one complaining dude.
---
If I can help it I will only play one.
---
WoW really? I didn’t realize the Discussion flair meant I’m here to complain.
---
Meh, imo the insane rewards were part of Blizzard going overboard. While I agree with you that it served really well as a point-of-interest to revive wPvP the rewards were just so good, anyone who hadn't been to IoQ yet on a given day would feel a lot of pressure to make sure to get it done. I really don't like it when repeatable content becomes like a checklist, even if there's only one item on the list lol. I prefer the feeling of just logging in and asking yourself, well, what do I want to do most?
---
Actually yea now that I think about it including alts would probably mean less than 1%
---
We of the the Horde we don’t want perfection. We want results. Well done.
---
Lok’tar ogar!
---
Luckily the peak of pvp in classic is bgs and there will always be people that don't how to kill hunters around for them to pick on.
---
No the vanilla community has been pretty clear we do not want achievements  or the ability for retail players to farm transmog in classic to use on retail.
---
they have since 8.2 at least
---
Read our lips... No effin achievements!
---
That's the equivalent of saying "No offense but..." and then calling someone fat. You're obviously crying. Its not even thinly veiled.
---
Man its nice seeing people who actually know what they are talking about.
---
I have trying to tell people for raiding you go pure feral, NG/moonglow + Resto, or Hots Resto. 
---
&gt; I would not want someone to bring this to the raid. If you just want to pvp and do a couple of dungeons this will do, however.
---
Yep. Druid is already a weaker class and all these people wanting to HotW heal/tank/dps are just asking to make it even worse in every role. I would never accept one in my guild.
---

Male Night Elf is definitely the worst, i'm a fan of a lot of the female models, it just feels like they gave the male models less attention and work :(
---
Mind control
---
Oh, any comment about weather it will be in the full release or not?
---
SENT INTO BATTLE, CAME FROM THE SKY
---
Seriously, getting body camped? Spirit rez and get a snack or let the dog out. Hell, you can even start flying to another zone first and by the time you are done rez sickness will be over. (repair cost, I know. It is still a better option sometimes)
---
Play on an oceanic server and raid while the kids are asleep.
---
Heal/tank dungos in stealth runs
---
Well, no one is saying it made the game better so nostalgia reasons are completely legit for a brief feeling of depression at the sight. People are used to the city being packed, usually with a couple of cliques hanging around in a circle talking in /s and stuff when they come from vanilla, so it's just a bit jarring and gives an, admittedly shortlived, illusion of the game having died. Of course those players are just elsewhere and the feeling only happens for people who haven't played at all since vanilla (or has spent most recent years on pservers).
---
That’s fair to assume. Maybe another way of looking at it would be enchanters getting easy skill points to level up so they can get their own greater magic wand at 70 skill points. This would be next to no effort for them if all they had to do was receive mats in trade, make the wand, and trade it back.

when i logged for first time since wotlk i saw my full wrathful gladiator warrior and i came. funny thing is i dont even remember being full wrathful... i guess i have been :)
---
Oh yeah....rivers and rivers
---
Except it's the gf
---
I mean just look at the comments here. They are all about how blizzard ruined the game because the main city from 15 years ago is empty.
---
The AH mount costs 5M gold, trust me, it does NOT get used often. I rarely see one, and have to go to Stormwind or Orgrimmar to use the AH very very often
---
Yeah if it's like true classic the game will be unplayable for the first week.
---
respect for making some time for classic :)
---
Because it gives you more options in what items you use, ie not having to use 2 armor rings to get more stats. Also if you're not needed to tank on a certain fights, you're better off just putting on resto gear and healing.
---
Hunters are the same as they were in original vanilla. 
---
So your "that bad now" comparison is a reference to EZ mode private servers?
---
&gt;bosses actually have even lower armor than Pserver values.
---
Already said that.
---
I'm not jumping to conclusions on it because I think we'll find we're missing more info then we currently realize.  The crit reduction is a rather new relevation and we can't even test MC yet.
---
Who the fuck is raiding for 6 hours outside of world first guilds?
---
Druids for being able to shift out of any root, slow, or polymorph.
---
If your argument isn't an assumption whatsoever of what you think/know will happen I would like to hear how it is you've come to your conclusions, is it based on personal experience or hearsay by people you know?
---
Errmm, my kids go to bed at 7. so I really dont understand what you are saying.
---
Its slot based. So chest, weapons, rings, then legs and helms are just worth more to sell. They also typically disenchant into more rare mats (essence and crystals/shards) However, enchanting usually uses more dust anyway. Sell the high value slots and disenchant the cheap ones. On pservers i learned this after hating my poor life like 3 times.
---
That’s an idea. Just wonder if the lag would be an issue or a language barrier
---
Oh my god, I completely forgot about barrens chat. That is definitely the biggest perk of classic
---
posting so I can re-read later. Love these stories!!
---
Yeah what the fuck Blizzard. Gnomes used to be my favorites, now they look like hideous Old God servants or something. Every one of the gnome faces has eyes that scream "I'm going to slice you open from mouth to anus and sleep inside you like a Tauntaun tonight", you took something I loved and you shit all over it for no reason &gt;:(
---
Nostalgia level over 9000!!
---
And we demand NO changes.
---
.I'd like to play some alliance hunter for my first character but the thought about taurens slapping me from 12 yards away(melee leeway or w/e) and that huge new deadzone is giving me nightmares.
---
So you're worried about OG Vanilla mechanics working like OG Vanilla mechanics while you try to relive OG Vanilla cause of mechanics?
---
Perfect for nightshifts at work :)
---
i wish the nights in wow were a bit darker :)
---
Which pieces? Holy paladin list actually looks pretty clean to me.
---
Pretty cool how WoW predicted Iron Man's sacrifice in Endgame so long before Iron Man even came out.
---
Why tho, this content is pointless to farm now on retail.
---
If young, bedtime. If older, they don't need the constant undivided attention of multiple caregivers.
---
I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for here?
---
Raids don't need to take that long. Really 1-2 hours is enough for most classic raids if you get the buffs and are at least somewhat progressed.
---
PVP servers are great.
---
Once a skull starts camping your corpse for 15+ minutes  you get a great excuse to catch up on reading/studying/your shows.
---
Came off as complainy to me
---
I will miss the fishing achievements. That was life.
---
Thanks I edited it
---
I’ve done this on many mmos, you’re mostly playing with people from Australia. Australians speak the same language as us except they say mate a lot, that’s about it. I have a kid as well and I usually can only play between 11pm-5am pst so oceanic server always worked perfectly cause their prime raiding time falls around those hours for us.
---
I love home made things like this
---
Because achievements are the work of the devil.
---
#nochanges
---
I'm going to look for my old vanilla server and see how many old friends do the same.
---
I think up until Black Temple.
---
That's a trick question. Chuck Norris doesn't do push ups. He pushes the Earth down.
---
WoW your times are way worse than mine. I mainly look for the PST based guilds as those that start at 7pm work best but all of those are even starting at 5pm now. Just the times I guess.
---
CHUCK NORRIS' FAVORITE FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM IS VANILLA!
---
I'll probably start with my Human Paladin, but from there I'll start playing on one of my other 8 alts in order to fulfil the childhood dream of getting one of every class to 60 and into my favourite tier gear for each.
---
The gods have given me a second chance with this game!
---
It absolutely is BiS for feral tanks.
---
Very hunters typically beat them.
---
But they scale well (less well now as i think they are the most effected caster by the crit classic changes.) But still should end up 4th highest dps in a short amount of time. 
---
Still They are super fun in pvp, super nice to level, nice to grind. Really great overall class. Most guilds aren't going to do the only 2 locks with no shadow weaving. So probably 3-5 in a raid. Not bad. And in pvp/BGs they are probably over all just behind warriors in impact and solo MUCH better.
---
That was pretty nice.
---
Haha. Thx!
---
Go for a single server. Secure you main, an easy bank alt name, and some cheesy name like "Sirdotalot"
---
Eh, they're a big mix in my opinion. Human females are, in my opinion, an enormous improvement on the whole.
---
That means no ... for now.
---
Pretty sure these servers are separated from Retail and won’t need the downtime right at launch.
---
Of course the millions of people trying to log in to clear MC in that 1st week like they claim they can do just might burn all the servers down.
---
I love my Male night elf. I think he looks epic
---
The new meta is Elon musk jokes about him being a chad, taking your girl and calling you a little bitch
---
If I'm in the human starting zone and I have dwarf friends, can they come straight down to the human zone and get quests? Or do they have to finish the dwarf starting zone?
---
Male Night elf is actually my favourite.
---
Pretty gimped tbh but still a fun class
---
It's a totally binary thing, so learning it is pretty frustrating. You either pull it off perfectly, or you make any mistake, big or small, and it's fucked. As a rookie at it I suggest you start by figuring out where you're going to stop at each pull after nova and distancing yourself. Once you know where you intend to end, you can plan an escape route away from that point so you know where to run if something goes amiss without pulling surrounding mobs unintentionally. I found this helped a great deal for me in Arathi when farming the.. well, farms. The mobs are pretty tightly spaced in the farm itself and the surrounding beasts are a PITA, so I avoided a lot of deaths eventually by having an escape route planned for each of the pulls I was doing. Improved my xp/hr quite a bit to eliminate those occasional death-by-panic situations.
---
Besides that, bring potions and practice a lot. No one got it right on their first, tenth or hundredth try, they just kept at it :)
---
Best to knock out the starting zone, then meet up.
---
Right click reporting will kill it
---
Alliance don't eat cheese, just kale and hummus.
---
Nelf Priests have it best with shadowmeld for ambush cliff throwing, if you time it right you can even break MC and SWP while they are midair to help confirm a kill.
---
on a side note, does anything actually reset weekly in vanilla we could maybe take advantage of?
---
They really shouldn't release phase based items or quest other than those related to the phases. And they did say something to this effect with the TP quest hub being in before it was added in vanilla.
---
Going into the other faction capital to fish 500-1000 fish for an achievement... I was (still am) an achievement whore
---
You mention Alliance Night Elves should use pets, but what about Horde Night Elves?
---
I'm glad you guys are buds. Would've thought you were arguing otherwise.

It wouldn’t be a substantial dps loss, but raids will look for people with BIS pieces with enchants, etc to bring people in. 
---
Won’t be a huge loss, as long as mechanically you do your role. 
---
Also, play how you want! This is how it’s supposed to be played. :)
---
WoW newbie here, what is the context of this?
---
If you keep doing it they will get a res timer
---
Say that to the rogue instead of the OT and BOOM problem solved
---
wow, someone woke up on the wrong side of the fatigue water.
---
There is a lot of rare recipes drops exc that are no longer in retail that will exist in classic. Personally i do not want people rolling on stuff because they need it for transmog in vanilla. Youre achievements in vanilla was the gear you had on youre server reputation that is much more rewarding then kiss all the squirrels of Azeroth.

Tri spec pvp priest is definitely a thing. Blackout, imp scream and silence are all very powerful talents for a support priest, typically you also get holy nova and imp mana burn. Your healing will suffer a lot in pve though.  
---
In a dedicated premade on alliance side the pallies are the star healers and the priests play a more support role with fears/silence/burn so that's where you'll see tri-spec. On horde, shamans aren't great heal bots, so your priests normally spend more time healing.
---
&gt;Just make a character named Sodapoppin on every PvP server in the 13th
---
You can't. You can only reserve 3 names across any of the Classic servers when they let us create them on the 13th, on the 12th for North America.

MAN I'M FUCKING WITH YOU WE ARE JUST ONE MONTH OUT NOW AND ALL I CAN DO IS WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS READ THIS REDDIT AND CHAT IN MY GUILD DISCORD I'M SO FUCKING HYYYYYYYPED
---
Question for someone trying to get a gang of friends together to play:
---
If a friend does not have the base version of the game, do you have to buy the $49.99 Battle for Azeroth base game, or just activate a subscription and download the Classic game client?
---
It was still a very good choice into BT at least to my memory, not sure if it was replacable in SWP.
---
you forgot mein kampf
---
Maybe you planned on never returning and so you sold everything (except your fav sword)- the same way people burn things to move on for good.
---
They can head straight down.
---
I'm so tempted to roll a night elf dagger rogue, the nostalgia is real
---
I guess they all followed the message of the day advice
---
Barrens chat for Horde was one of the more popular chat channels during vanilla.  It was pretty chill usually as people were waiting for WC groups to form or going over to queue for WSG.  It developed it's own culture for Chuck Norris jokes and the usual political/religious discussions that nobody wanted to hear as well.
---
Ha hahahah I took three days off and I fill my script on the 25th
---
When expansions launch on a Monday they skip the weekly maintenance
---
Mage, you don't have to farm like other classes (Warlock shards, Tank consumables, etc.).  You don't die as much as melee (less gold farming for repairs).  You are not vital to the raid (tank/healers), so you can miss raids on occasion without penalty.  You can teleport around the world, saving hours and hours of travel time.  You create your own food and water (see gold farming).

I remember there was a metal show back in the day, lots of Scandinavian bands were featured. Who hosted that? Or am I thinking of something else
---
They ought to be announced before Aug 13th.
---
such a cute little potato &lt;3
---
Suck at playing casters doesn't really mean much if you mainly plan to PvE though. You just watch the threat meter and spam 1 button (depending on what raid, it could be fireball or frostbolt, amazing stuff) and then occasionally chug your mana pot and other consumeables.
---
If playing PvP though, I'd maybe even argue that playing a warrior is more mechanically intense in a 1v1 or 1vX situation than a mage, even though you have a way bigger likelyhood/window to outplay as a mage, as I at least feel you have way more tricks up your sleeves than a warrior.
