That OP did mention in the comments that he missed some of them, including the one [near Zevrim Thornhoof](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dl4728/dire_maul_all_9_dusty_tome_spawn_locations/f4mrzm4/).

I dislike them for PUGs, yes. Reservations should be.. reserved for guild/friend runs without pugging.
---
"I throw balls far. If you want good words, date a languager"
---
In raid you should have wayyy more HKS like 1000 more...but i do feel like small group is still way better considering those hks will be worth 1-4-7 at most
---
Play the game.

---
Save any and everything for your diary
---
I meant queue times won't be 5-10mins. Cross realm is going to make it worse, not better LOL. Horde outnumber alliance almost 2:1 on average.
---
lmao a bunch of back pedalling mages and you're clicking trinkets what is this meant to be?
---
I haven’t participated in the mass kill squads to farm honor. When I PvP, I let the person know I’m in the area (/wave nod salute etc.). I won’t attack if they are engaged with a mob or less than full health. I’ve never been the first to attack just because I believe in consensual PvP. That’s just my play style.
---
What spec are you? I can't really give you an answer but if your tank/drain spec you want to stack shadow damage which I am doing right now. But I think most people will tell you to stack spell damage. Some of the gear for our pre-bis are BoE shadow dmg gear. Hopefully a less stupid warlock can help you lol.

\---- Hordes who died twice while alliance 30min corpse crawl into BRD
---
Which are you killing?
---
I have seen 2 teebu drop in MC
---
I understand what you’re saying but with a player pool of 30k+ it’s by no means small. Just a thought, but I think it would be way more exciting at least starting off against players you know and have fought in the past.
---
This is true though, you can't blow your load to fast and burn out.
---
No as far as I know you would not be able to form a group with someone on another server. You could potentially join discord or something with them and try queuing at the same time to try and get into the same game but would not be able to form a group with them.
---
Blizzard likes this
---
YEAH MAN THATS IT! BIG THANKS :)
---
Im just happy im not playing on such a greedy server now with that self centered retsil mentality
---
Elemental bosses also have specific drops with some being pretty good, and when DMF rolls around they become the primary source of Ace of Elementals for the Elementals Deck (Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom trinket).
---
Do you play the majority or minority faction on your server?
---
I think it's Kirtonos
---
The truth is, classic wow was *never* going to recreate the same experience from 2004. MC getting cleared by PUGs in the first week? People barely even knew MC existed for the first few months in vanilla.
---
Let's pull some of your recent quotes:
---
"On reddit, democratic lives matter. Better dead if they aren't red."
---
"Making fun of people who do stupid things like take social media seriously is fun and healthy for everyone"
---
"Ethics don't have anything to do with laws." (Yikes - Law students study ethics extensively, by the way)
---
"the average redditor is a left-leaning doormat whose only assertive when they have arguments in their showers with themselves. Really not someone I'd want to be associated with."
---
I would say things against your character, but I don't have to. You have enough toxicity to paint your own poisonous portrait of yourself.
---
Why the fuck are you even commenting then? You think someone is going to give you an explanation that somehow makes it funny to you?
---
Classic wow had a several month cooldown on transfers
---
I’m the same way, sometimes I get bored and wish someone would open on me but they never do. Frost mage probs
---
Honestly, I'm totally okay with it being delayed. I'm not okay with the constant muddying the waters and moving the goalposts when they're asked about it. It's actually totally ridiculous that they are claiming that we "haven't had a patch yet, just a phase release and an update". I wish they would just say "Yeah we haven't been able to figure out implementing it but we're working on it." Just another example of blizzard being unable to communicate effectively and feeling the need to cover their own asses over a stupid keyring.
---
So the difference is 3 weeks. The point is, everyone's acting like it's 6 months early. And all of that is ignoring that vanilla didnt have these mega servers we have today. This was probably in their plans all along. They released DM before Phase 2. They'll release BGs before phase 3. I'm positive the majority of people bitching about this play on the dominate faction on their server and are butt hurt they can't get free kills as easily anymore.
---
Finally, it's starting to get good again.
---
I am tired of spending 15-20 minutes to get to BRD. Happy?
---
According to the page linked, the mobs don't despawn once the boss is killed. So you could keep farming them once the boss is dead, you just won't keep getting an endless wave of them.
---
Him and your mom.
---
Why would you ever cheap shot an orc?  Adapt your play style against their strong racial or yes, you will die.
---
Dang you're gonna have do to Ony again. Sucks.
---
We had a rogue stealth into TM while the rest of the group was closer to the lake, and gave the group 2 dishonorable kills. I was lucky and missed one, but then got one on a TB raid.
---
Meanwhile all the rogues have viskag and perds and no caster has mageblade
---
Whats that potrait and enemy nameplate addon called?
---
It's actually not based on the movie but a term for a place you parachute into.
---
The objective experience for minority factions, particularly on high pop servers, was that they couldn't play the fucking game. 
---
That you choose to say that its subjective so you can keep pretendibg WPvP is good is your own issue.
---
As a Warrior that solo levels because my friends have stopped playing, I do not have a  problem with people attacking me.
---
This is sad and sad
---
I am on alliance, horde outnumbers us and during the day time you can not leave without a raid or you expect an hour death drag to anywhere you go.  I understand the pain.  The issue is paid transfers though and trying to lessen the problems that could cause.  Low to high server causing issues with economy.  Low faction leaving to cause balance to be worse than it already is. Those things.  Im complaining about opening transfers that would cause issues is all.
---
without cross realm BGs,battlemasters have no purpose,you'd need to go to the instance zones to zone into the BGs.
---
and as we've seen this past week,gank squads would be ready and waiting,and you might as well sign a servers death certificate,because no one would deal with that type of shit.
---
I was obviously referring to the time between Honor being released and Battlegrounds being released.
---
[removed]
---
Playing an enchanter kind of felt like cheating - you just broke fundamental rules of the game, at great risk to yourself.
---
The perfect time to build a twink has passed. Prices are already inflated, sadly.
---
Vanilla PvP trinkets remove certain effects based on what class you are. Rogue for instance removes Charm, Fear and Polymorph effects.
---
I played on a PVE server during vanilla and I remember BGs mixed with PVP servers.
---
Ah fk I'm so bad.
---
This post clearly isn't about the loot. It's about the player attitudes and their evasion from consequence.
---
because my friends made characters on a PVP server
---
Keep cheap shorting and dying then I guess?  Or I dunno may be change your tactics to deal with the racial....no that’s be silly... just come on to reddit and complain instead!
---
I wish the Mayans had been right and the world had ended in 2012.
---
......everyone else is the problem. Nah, just people like you.
---
Lol?  You a wow dev or some shit?  Or why do you have any internet authority here?
---
So true. i hate orcs. Yesterday i was lagging pretty bad right as i opened on a orc shaman i accidentally hit kidneyshot right after cheapshot. And he resisted both and walked on like nothing happened because he didnt even notice.
---
I don’t see a problem with arena in classic tbh, that sounds dope as shit, maybe some interesting comps could come out of it that aren’t just RMP or something.
---
&gt; I can't use the world to PvP or a GM shows up and tells me to stop. Not a classic experience.
---
This was against the rules according to blue posts from 2005. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
If o my #nochanges really meant nochanges
---
Orcs together = strong
---
I think I remember they were in vanilla. If they aren't certain servers may not get cross realm, ie. Remulos is the only PvE Oceanic server. Without cross realm they wont have anyone to battlegroup with.
---
I haven't complained about anything
---
Ya, FoH were a very inciteful bunch. Afterlife were indeed the better guild.
---
With BGs coming out prior to phase 3, which enchants would be best for a 19 twink rogue since the +15 agi enchants won't be out yet?  Crusader/Lifestealing?
---
Yep they should open up faction changes to see if people that care about their server and server balance are willing to correct it. Blizzard should report the faction numbers per realm so that the players can help restore balance.
---
What a joke.  We finally get to experience world PvP again, and it's in the game for half the time it was in Vanilla.
---
Assuming you are affliction, stack as much spell damage/shadow damage as you can. Siphon Life and Drain Life are already incredibly efficient and additional spell damage only increase their efficiencies. Off the top of my head, look into Dreamweave Gloves, Dreamweave Vest, and the Shadoweave set.
---
I curse the existence of the orc's stun resist racial everytime this happens, then I remember I don't need to deal with Paladins or Perception with this annoying Spy addon... And I realize that'd be much worse.
---
Lol, twice is a lot? Okay.
---
But does it exist? Never seen it
---
I had a great comparison with my friend. I ended up being ranked like 2160 whereas he got ranked 2180, the huge difference though is that he has 1200HK and I had 350HK, but since i did it all in small groups i was awarded far more honor than his Hillsbrad raids...
---
Same.
---
&gt; You are 100% full of shit, because there's no way for you to actually know what the population statistics really are on your server.
---
There's a fair amount of information to draw from to get quite a good view on the census.
---
[Here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) is one for example.
---
No need to knee-jerk say that I'm "100% full of shit". You're literally assuming from a subjective point of view. Might as well say to yourself that you're full of shit as well, as you literally auto-assume that I'm on a "dominant" faction on the server.
---
&gt;Even so, you're just confirming my suspicion that you have absolutely no idea what it's like to be overwhelmingly outnumbered.
---
I've had plenty of experiences where it was 40 vs 5 people.
---
Then again, I'd usually go to a major city and rally up some people to have a good fight and make it more fair at 40 vs 40. This is an online MMORPG. There's plenty of people to play with. If you have the need to not put any effort in the game and always just assume that shit comes flying your way when you need it, you will not have a lot of fun in the end. 
---
The more effort you put in the game yourself, the more equal it will be in the end and the more joy you will get. Even on faction unbalanced servers.
---
&lt;APES&gt; is a great, maybe a little bit of an extreme, example. They put a lot of effort in the game and thus gain a lot out of it. Even when the odds are against them. If you stand in a major city and expect shit to happen you will eventually never go against the odds and literally burry you and your own faction in the ground.
---
But hey man, you do you. Keep assuming what you want to believe.
---
my issue is not the reserving part, but the giving yourself masterloot. you dont trust people enough not to honor their commitment yet you think people should trust you. people who are reserving items shouldn't be giving themself masterloot period.
---
Neckbeard lingo
---
Didn’t the players fuck the game balance? The factions aren’t balanced at all, or on an equal footing when it comes to pve/pvp advantages. A nochanges game with all the information available to min max for 15 years means that people will choose the best option and unbalance the game.
---
After 14 weeks of Molten core we still havnt seen a single Mageblade, our mages/lock are crying so hard it's insane
---
Lul you sure are salty as fuck. The only thing i've admitted is that i'm having fun reading all your bullshit and if you see anything more then you're trying to read between the lines a little too much.
---
Well, in that case you're not wrong. but the entire patch release cadence is being expedited and people are understandably concerned.
---
The perfect time was a month into phase1. Got my 3 twinks fully geared at such cheap price.
---
Is it possible to force a name change on Classic?  I'm planning to reroll and I want my current character's name but I don't want to just delete it since it's at a useful level.  Does the delete/restore/renaming method work on Classic?
---
It's 30% because the 5% base resist chance gets added
---
Exactly. If you joined a pvp server, you did it explicitly because you desired the ability to fight your enemy any time, any where. You actively want to to be hostile. No one rolls pvp unless they specifically want to be a dick to someone. You chose pvp so that you could ruin someone else's gaming experience and you salivate at the thought of kicking the shit out of someone else's toon. You don't join pvp to quest, be diplomatic, or just do dungeon runs. You are lying if you claim so. You weighted the ability to savage and destroy other players as more important than any other aspect of the game. If you joined pvp, you are getting exactly what you deserve for being a terrible person.
---
Oh wow, you went through someone's comment history to insult them? You really are a nice guy.
---
zug zug
---
Orc racial is 25%
---
How long do you think it was in vanilla?
---
They have to be terminally/fatally sick..not just a simple flu :P
---
if you're horde you can get this quest reward:  https://classicdb.ch/?item=12545
---
and Maiden's Circle is a boe that's almost as good as freezing band and costs significantly less.
---
Imo, maiden's circle is better for aoe farming, about the same for raiding, and not as good as freezing band for pvp.
---
If you have 2 level 60s already you should be able to afford a flask for a raid.  If you don’t, you def seem like you have the time and experience to grind it out within 2 hours possibly? 
---
Sucks that’s it’s an absolute requirement exp if you know what your doing and will be carrying your weight anyways. 
---
I’m no expert but the 10 extra people should def outweigh some flasks. Good luck and i hope you make the investment.
---
It may have been against the rules but it certainly wasn't enforced like it is now.
---
Yes you only need 4% more but goint over that 9% is not useless, 1% hit is still better than zero as it counts for white hits and offhand hits so 1% hit is still the same dps as a few ap.
---
If you have weapon expertise talent and are using swords/daggers/fists it lowers the hit required by another 3%.
---
So with the precision talent, and weapon expertise you only need 1% to never miss special attacks against a boss level mob. It’s not a bad idea to get more hit though to lower your miss rate on your off hand.
---
what is AV and what weekend is it on? I'd like to plan ahead
---
Is improved cleave a noob trap? My math here could be wrong but on an arms warrior it seems like it could be alright.
---
Max rank cleave is 50 bonus damage. Imp cleave brings that to 110. Impale increases crit damage by an additional 20 percent so 110x2.2 is 242 bonus damage on a crit. 
---
I'm not 60 yet but that seems pretty decent
---
\*laughs\*   
---
Take good care of yourself, FutureTruth. Perhaps in the future, you truly will know truth &lt;3
---
I’m always stroking.
---
Gold sellers and TSM? Like are you dense?  TSM is such a BS add on lol. I agree the AH needs organizing from its barebones but don't bring up in game economies and pretend like TSM benefits the player base as a whole. 
---
 It's brain dead easy to take advantage of others on it. It's like the spy add on but for the AH.
---
I'm on mobile so I cant link it, but to get mine I used a youtube video that shows you how to kill Zigris with just 2 mages. A guildie and I did like 5 runs and got one to drop. Takes like 20 mins a run, and is actually quite fun if you do it right.
---
They're a business. If opening up more servers was economically and technically viable, I think it's safe to assume that they would have done so.
---
A tailoring recommendation - get to 250 so you can start making Mooncloth. You'll get 10g-15g profit every 4 days by making it, and you'll get tailoring levels for it all the way up to 300.
---
I've been chasing Truestrike Shoulders since I hit 60. One of my last prebis pieces and it's almost sad at this point how many runs I've done not seeing it drop/losing the roll when it does. I've seen Briarwood Reed drop at least 6-7 times. MH once (lost the roll by a few points). I just seen TS drop earlier today for the 2nd time ever and I lost them to the ONLY other rogue that actually needed them since I'm basically the last person on my server with out them. Exretemely demoralizing and discouraging lol.. 
---
UBRS is has basically the rest of my prebis.... I haven't been counting the runs but I wanna say I'm definitely close to 40 if not more.. I got Hoj on my third BRD anger run, I'm convinced I blew all of my RNG then and there :(
---
The dude ran the guild "Elitist Jerks". He's absolutely smirking while saying this. Probably camped outside of BRM afk honor farming too.
---
It goes both ways. Heartseeker is 70/30 alliance.
---
My server (according to reports) only has about 3.5k players and just under 1k being level 60, this is for BOTH sides
---
And there are some servers that are almost completely dead, not having cross-realm BGs would kill the game for a LOT of people.
---
Rockbiter will get you more damage but windfury feels better kinda.
---
P1 was the best time to build them, I have a 19 warr, Hunter, and priest for that bracket
---
Great advice. Thank you!
---
Oh boi id imagine some rich boi warrior is gonna throw crusader on that thing and it will be glorious.
---
Elemental Invasions were added in 1.4. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elemental_Invasions_(Classic)
---
Bro, that was the initial comment I replied to so now we've gone a full circle for you.
---
Or we could all just play on the servers we think would be the most fun?
---
Nah I'm just playin, RP-PvP is for **chads.**
---
If people are 15 manning Ony and 20 man Rag on farm, then yes that is how it works. That means we need more content. Why contradict yourself?
---
Exactly. People think it's complaining, but it's not. It's not "whaa I don't want to pvp" it's "I literally can't leave the city". BGs can only hlep
---
 Nice! Congrats :) what class are you playing?
---
Just study and focus on school man, game at home or at a friend’s house, your future self will thank your current self. I learned this the hard way.
---
I'm a hunter btw*
---
pretty brutal man
---
Risky
---
Just curious, what did you spend your gold on to only have 50? Definitely finish questing for extra gold
---
Throwing your hands up and saying "Whelp we fucked up but what could we have done anyways? Moving on!" is not how business is done, at least successfully.
---
They launched with 3 US East PVP Servers, 0 in South America, 0 in the Central US Timezone, 0 in the Mountain Timezone. So that's 3 servers for everybody in the Americas (north and south) east of Chicago. At the time, we knew that was a horrible mistake. Now, it's become "Hindsight is 20/20" levels of obvious, but it wasn't some unforeseen consequence of a seemingly negligible action as you imply. It was a huge mistake, they were called on it, and they took too long to respond.
---
Hence, population is an issue. Which you agree, I believe, is the main issue at the center of all of this (population).
---
I apologize if the talent-talk made it seem like I was talking about PvP. Was mainly talking about PvE here, but I would still Escape Artist and Stoneform away for Stun-resist, WotF and War Stomp any day of the week.
---
Whitemane looks just like this. 
---
Takes me about 35 minutes and ~20% durability from lava and falls before I can even start BRD.
---
DPS? Healer? Tank? Do you use mana?
---
I would highly recommend using fire protection potions.   The only time i took damage, (Healer here), was during the 12 seconds between my potion wearing off, and me drinking another one.
---
for pvp? WF because when it does hit, it does a lot of damage
---
i do study in classes, i’m playing it when i have nothing to do during my free period
---
The time you spend skinning also starts to add up. I decided it wasn’t worth it on my hunter, but if it’s something people enjoy doing then go for it.
---
Nightslayer shoulders are super good. You should be happy that your rogues are getting decked with that.
---
Oh you've switched to being nice now? Well aren't you wonderfully bipolar. Good luck to your guild!
---
None of these are good ideas. #nochanges.
---
40k gave me 45% into rank 3 on firemaw alliance.
---
I have a 60 warrior on a PvP server and really considering repelling on grobbulus with a new character. 
---
I love warriors, but yeah taking it to 60 was a pain. 
---
I'm torn between playing: 
---
- troll priest 
---
- Tauren warr 
---
- Tauren shaman 
---
- Hunter 
---
- Orc lock
---
I don't bother with Songflower right now. The Horde will stand around the spawns and purge buffs at 4am.
---
They posted a speed limit. Doesn't mean they have to follow it. Relax.
---
In Vanilla the content was there, but for most people it was something to strive towards, and it felt as if we had plenty of time to do so, because there were tons of people in the same boat, including new players who were signing up all the time as the game grew as a cultural phenomenon. There wasn't a sense of falling behind; instead it felt like being a part of something that was growing and becoming more vibrant. It'll be different now, when a lot of guilds on each server kill Nefarion as soon as the raid opens. 
---
I'm not sure what the solution is. Artificially gating it when Ironforge is already full of people standing around in Tier 1 doesn't seem helpful. But if it's so trivial to those people anyway, I don't really see how the content really enriches their experience. They'll instantly have it on farm. If the idea is that they'll have even more fun beating up on the slower people who didn't rush to 60 and farm the hell out of everything, then you'd think they'd be concerned about how the slower people perceive the Classic experience (ie, because we might not be playing anymore by that point).
---
very true, only mitigating factors is a. stupid high schoolers and b. we all HAVE to log in under our accounts so if anyone does shady shit they’d be exposed or would have to have someone else’s login
---
Listen to your class leader, your GM or your raid leader.
---
So it’s not classic it’s a pserver. Connects to different ip’s.
---
On my orc, it is legit once every 10 or 15 stuns.
---
Just like when I poly someone, it lasts maybe 7 seconds before they pop out but I'll for sure eat a full 40 second poly if its cast on me.
---
That looks boring as shit for both factions. You all deserve each other for being scared of "dead" servers.
---
Not to mention sitting in an hr long queue to do so.
---
ty
---
This. My friend group is now scattered due to the exact same thing. We literally just can't do anything, anywhere, at any time. Some rerolled on PVE, some are focusing on alts and twinks, and some are playing other games now. The wpvp was a blast before, sometimes you win, sometimes you die. Now the entire map is shut off from us. Literally. The entire map is unplayable.
---
ha i feel yah

Who?

Maraudon also wasnt in at launch. How many hairs do you wanna split?

Maybe now in classic, but back in the day it didn’t really seem overpopulated with rogues (even though I felt that they were extremely overpowered then)
---
Some people just can't wait for Warcraft 4.
---
Source?
---
I would believe that coming from Kargoz, but I'm skeptical when it comes to Defcamp.
---
Listen to the raid leader, ask the raid or your class leader if you are unsure of something. Better to ask a dumb question before a pull vs wiping the raid by not asking it.
---
Bring a bunch of arrows and food for your pet, make sure you repair before the raid.
---
It's all pretty simple just listen and pay attention.
---
Gnoll skin bandolier, Don Julio Band, Icy Barbed Spear, an epic mount. 
---
Its a hunter's wet dream.
---
How will this affect WPVP on faction heavy servers. Won't the undermanned faction just sit in their city and sit by the battle master 24/7 and queue.?
---
I got mine north on the 5th kill in classic.
---
It's a lot of paladins and Seal of Righteousness and Seal of Command
---
One is just a straight damage increase
---
And the other is a chance at massive damage
---
I've leveled both paladin and shaman to 60 before in the past, and IN MY PERSONAL OPINION, I like going with guaranteed damage increase, Seal of Command And Windfury can be really awesome but also really frustrating, even with a slow weapon I've gone 2-3 mobs without it proccing once...but when it does proc, it's awesome
---
But when it doesn't...it sucks...
---
If you’re going combat I would 100% take it. 5 points in parry feels bad but it actually makes a difference in saving some damage, but riposte makes a huge difference. Not only do you get a lot of dmg for relatively cheap, but you also get 6 second disarm, which is clutch. Rogue leveling is some of the most unforgiving, especially between lvls 20-40 which is when I found riposte most useful.
---
I was always being nice. One can firmly defend one's stance with sound evidence and still not be considered hostile. But if youre assuming I have been hostile - perhaps that is simply a mere reflection of that which you expect of others. Fallacies are so twentieth century. These days you need wit and grit to light the right fires.

Alright well that’s good to hear, I spent an extra 2 years in my undergrad cuz of my wow addiction, it’s very real and does affect a lot of people, the game is just too awesome. Incase you neglect homework because you think you’ll miss out on something I’m wow, you won’t it’ll reset next week and the gear and memories will come, but you got 1 shot in school. 
---
Best of luck dude.
---
If you get many thousands of people to unsub in a single week and tens of thousands more logging only 1/10th of the playtime as the week before, then maybe.
---
I envy your only 30 minutes. I'm about to stick a level 20 warlock in a secret place in BRM and get 2 good friends to do the same.
---
I don't feel bullied, I feel like people that made a bad server choice feel entitled to disrupt other servers without making any concessions themselves.  I mentioned the 3 month cd.  You only need to stock up 1000 black lotus and transfer once so how does a cd help?  There are cheap golden pearls, arcane crystals, leather, elemental fire, different essences.  I didn't think I would need to point out every consumable item for you to get the idea.  Off topic though on that.   So you think it is better to allow people in and disrupt an already healthy economy for 10,000 people instead of the person transferring giving up gold and sellable items that he got much easier and or cheaper on a low pop realm?
---
People can avoid BG's while leveling.  They can't avoid wpvp.
---
&gt; Throwing your hands up and saying "Whelp we fucked up but what could we have done anyways? Moving on!" is not how business is done, at least successfully.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They launched with:
---
All of your suggestions are things they could have done differently at the onset, not things they could have done differently now. Do you have any solutions for going forward?
---
Yes I do. Economies will recover.
---
&gt; AV offhands yay.
---
You mean Lobotomizer?
---
Do you actually think only twinks will be playing PVP? I'm not sure why this would be any different than vanilla? Just because people are nostalgic that play this game and want to max level asap?
---
I'm not sure that's true..
---
And at least I can finish questing to 60.
---
Mages: Fireball or Frostbolt on Azuregos?
---
That's not spy, that's a ton of addons that do that. ElvUI, and I'm sure many others.
---
I mean, I'm there with you. I'd like to see an addon-less WoW. I think it could be refreshing. There are a ton of addons that I would like seeing banned, at least on classic. The point is to play a basic version of the game ? Make it basic then. I'm playing vanilla with a clean-as-fuck 2019 UI, addons that tell me where to go, what to do and how to do it. The one that hurts the game the most, imo, is Questie. Because of it, everyone magically knows where to go and what to do. As few people read quest texts as on retail, and nobody ever has to ask in general or guild chat for help regarding quests. It kills some of the social aspect of the game, imo. Another big one imo is dbm, though I'd say it's more of a problem on retail than classic, since vanilla tactics are much less complex.
---
But I also understand that getting that pristine vanilla experience is just impossible. Can't ban wowhead, can't erase information from people's heads.
---
And when it comes to Spy, of course it also changes how vanilla plays, but imo it just doesn't change that much. I honestly think people exaggerate the effects spy have on world pvp. I think it's just everything. People play differently now, everyone's better at the game compared to 15 years ago, and all of that changes how world pvp plays. I think surprise in world pvp is overrated. I still get surprised with spy, and I'm still able to surprise people. And honestly, I don't think awareness changes that much. The range at which you can see people isn't that huge. If they're on an epic mount, they can reach you in less time than it takes to get 1 food tick off. It's mostly numbers, skill, gear, and health/mana/mobs fighting one party.
---
That RP walk. Move over leeroy
---
The second phase just dropped a week ago dude
---
50/50.
---
Today while farming in the burning steps I got kill 7 times while walking maybe 100 meters by 8 alliance.
---
I still enjoyed it, a lot.
---
Have anything to add ?
---
As opposed to transferring to a dead server where the ques will still be painfully long?
---
At the risk of sounding harsh... these players don't matter when considering the timing of the content roll out.
---
The casual players who are only able to jump into the game a few hours a week aren't raiding. What do they care if BWL just released?
---
Once the 3 battlegrounds &amp; darkmoon are released they won't see any changes in content for the rest of classic... so why consider them at all?
---
So will the person that gives up their gold, with much less impact to the server.
---
Sorry should have specified that I'm a priest, so I just healed him and dpsd.  For gorok specifically he's incredibly easy to just endlessly kite as a priest. Gizzle is the toughest one because he hurts a lot but just using cool downs properly and healing more than dpsing gets him down in time. 
---
I doubt any hunter pet could survive without external healing as the damage gets pretty high on some of the bosses and aoe threat for the first part of arena I would assume is impossible with a hunter pet. Could definitely easily 3 man it with a healer though.
---
Enrage gives you a chunk of rage but also makes it so you take more damage. So you can time it so that you don't have the rebuff that makes you take more damage and you still have the bonus rage :)
---
So you could just FP into SW instead of teleporting? Yeah sure sucks to be a mage and not be able to use your tele shit but eh the rest of us get by just fine without tele. It honestly seems like the problem you are describing really only affects teleporting mages, or those taking a mage portal, and even then it only affects them badly when there are important buffs up.
---
Most of vanilla is not too complicated, there's just a handful of fights where you need to watch out for one ability but it's largely don't stand in fire/don't stand near the boss at this time/run away from the raid if you get x debuff type stuff. If you just mention to the raid leader before the fight you don't know what you are doing/haven't done this boss it'll only take a minute to explain it.
---
Keep in mind precision doesnt help for spell hit so poisons dont get that hit.
---
As a rogue the more hit the better imo. Warriors can get away with a lot less as they can keep up heroic strike in raids almost 100% with world buffs as oppose to rogues who only have sinister strike every so often and white damage is a good portion of your output.
---
Ashbringer
---
My server is sweaty as fuck with pvp. I expected to dominate wpvp encounters with ease using that combo. Instead it's like this: shadow reflector trinkets the death coil, blacksmith trinkets the fears, resists 5 more spells, spams okboomer, dead
---
&gt;Make friends and play the game it's meant to be played.
---
The only reason I am on this pvp server is because I have friends.  We all die together.  I would've easily rolled pve so I could enjoy the game otherwise.  And before you say enjoy the game how it's meant to be played, you're fucking clueless.  Nowhere in vanilla were servers this big, nor did every single fp and path to a dungeon take 20+ deaths to reach.  So no it's impossible to enjoy the game how it's meant to be played on alliance, on my server, until the losers realize they won't hit rank 14 and quit camping tbh.  Which has already started to happen somewhat.
---
&gt;Nobody complains if they get shot when trying to knife people in CS:GO.
---
&gt;Lastly the environment in itself is supposed to be dangerous. Players are part of this environment.
---
I honestly would feel bad for someone with such a rudimentary brain but I'm out of charity and you're probably having a great time ganking alliance so it's on you.
---
Yeah uld, no just stealthing to each boss and each chest room and killing. Generally a good run is 15 minutes and gives 2 large radiant and 3-5 small radiant. Plus whatever you get from the chests or boe blues.
---
I kept swim speed pots on hand when questing there.
---
As a lvl 56 on this server, it takes around 15-25 deaths to get into BRD taking over 30 minutes. But once in I don't come out until all my gear is red.
---
Yeah cuz you don't; it's not a good idea. I'm reading this dude's tips and I'm not agreeing with any of them.
---
I rarely think of pulling rage for the next pull; I don't ever feel the need to with Enrage on a 1min cd.
---
I would never pull with starfire. Moonfire is enough and is also instacast, so it doesn't slow ur dungeon momentum down.
---
I DO use swipe for anything more than 1 target and prefer to start with swipe and tab-maul than just tab-maul, since I play with dpshungry mages, and you need to tag each mob before threat gets established, and the only skill druids have to do that is swipe. So in instances where he's suggesting tab-maul, I'm thinking you do that to establish the tag so your aoe dps can start dpsing, and then -tab-maul to secure the threat. Depending on how ham ur aoe dps is going, you may have to throw in a couple mauls.
---
and yeah. macroing FF to maul is not a good idea if you care about GCD...
---
You shouldn’t call people neck beards when there’s a pic of you in your profile and you look like that.  HHahaha
---
Not for yourself.
---
Proof: I literally just deleted a character and remade it with the same name.
---
I dont think crossrealm bgs was a good idea. Its just reward the horde again.
---
My UI is perfect it’s been this way for 3 weeks. Minimal eye movement
---
How many bosses did they get down?
---
Do you need to respec if you want to heal one dungeon and then tank another?
---
What is 198? I’m out of the loop.
---
Can you explain how they lc makes it transparent that makes it feel safe and good?
---
I'm currently in an lc and want the members to feel like this as well.
---
So you believe horde out number alliance or you just new to math?
---
I think a lot of it has to do with investing time into leveling. Getting to 19 is super quick as oppose to 49. I agree though having a larger pool of spells and mounts make it more interesting.
---
Will take this into consideration. Thanks!
---
You are probably right.
---
However, it's a bit of a strawman argument.  I think the more important question is what the delta is between first guild clear and average guild farm status or pug status.
---
Every serious guild will clear this content immediately.  That's a given and people would be stupid to argue.
---
But I think that Naxx doesn't get pugged as fast as MC got pugged, and I think it's likely that the percentage of guilds who clear it in the first week will be lower than other raid tiers.
---
Two different things.
---
&gt; This is false. You were either in a guild that could do Naxx, or you were in a guild that couldn't. MC was rarely run because everyone had done it already, BWL was forgotten, AQ and Naxx were ran commonly by the big guilds
---
I didn't see this at all. Probably something like 20 guilds were actively trying to climb through MC/BWL during the Naxx phase of the game on my faction alone. Only 3 to 5 were pushing Naxx. BWL was still a pretty prestigious clear for many guilds at the time.
---
how tough/complex is it to do vs zf zombie farm?
---
For enhance leveling, I use 1h with rockbiter and shield. Flametongue if they are higher level than me, and 2h with wf if they are lower level than me.
---
Yes.
---
Will Blizz do anything abut it?
---
No.
---
Sounds like bwl end of january
---
Cross realm or local?
---
Wow. That’s bad. I wouldn’t stay even as horde. Not worth hunting that hard for easy kills with no sense of honor or accomplishment.
---
Someone's got to
---
I dunno, I'm in a pretty casual guild of 'adults with kids'.  A couple hit 60 after 3-4 weeks, but most of us are just now hitting 60 in the last week or two.
---
I don't know the census, but if I had to guess, the majority of players are now 60 or very close.
---
Did you reply to the wrong person?  I didn't mention tsm or any add on, explain your argument please.
---
i think its more than 3 tbh
---
i aoed air ones in silithus a lot with mage+priest
---
Taunt is not for pulling. Taunt is for (temporarily) grabbing the attention of a wayward mob.
---
Taunt does not grant you permanent aggro; if you do not build *additional* threat (maintaining your lead) you will lose the mob again.
---
The server is ~80/20. Showing a screenshot of a 2 40 man raids waiting for ony buff doesn't show or mean anything. 
---
Thinking hurts, huh?
---
I'm sure everyone is very happy for you, knowing that you will choose to spend your boundless free time by killing players with actual responsibilities and accomplishments that aren't rooted in a video game. 
---
Too bad you can't be in multiple zones at the same time. It will be a shame, having so many leveling players not inconvenienced by your spiteful presence.
---
...?
---
Did you read the OP?
---
Good. Hahaha noob!
---
Do you have some addon that randomly rearranges your UI?
---
It's tough but still fun
---
Warmode was a special kind of hell as a resto druid...
---
Kind of fun at first playing on stormrage and beind ahead of the curve but then blizz paired us with every goddamned horde heavy server it felt like.
---
I think you underestimate the amount of difference between a PvE server and a balanced PvP server.
---
Unlike vanilla, Classic started at peak population and its population will only decline for the forseeable future.  That means that guilds will always be looking for new people.  You're obviously a competent player, so once properly geared you would be an asset to a good guild, and they will carry you through the obsolete content so you can be an asset where ever the end game currently is.  These are guilds that rolled on PvE servers - running dungeons and raids is what they enjoy.
---
I think there are also more alts on PvE servers, so it's easier to find groups for low level dungeons. And of course there's more quests available than on a PvP server, and if you're Alliance there's a larger variety of low-level dungeons to easily go to.
---
Thank Christ.
---
Druid talent question at 60. If I'm planning on BG PvP and some dungeon tanking, but not raiding or dungeon healing, is HOTW/NS still the recommended build? I feel like I'm using a lot of points just to get NS.
---
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
---
He got 198 honor from killing him
---
So can you not read or can you not read? He never said anything about whether or not either side outnumbers the other.
---
Please Horde, come to Heartseeker! Everbody wins
---
Lol no you don't.
---
Stop trying to lie.
---
A couple days ago I had 5 lifetime honor kills and was listed at 483 standing . . .
---
I mean if you re log in a major city you should be uncaged, no? Worst case if you wanna preserve your world buffs just have a 2nd client ready to force log your guy in your city.
---
Yea I was  even willing to consider WSG was skewed slightly but he said it was well known. Makes sense now, obviously AV is dumb asymmetrical.
---
Deterrence
---
Good stuff!
---
Time to get started on those robes :D
---
My understanding is that it’s more gear dependant than spec dependant.  I geared/specced as feral and could DPS or Tank easy all the way to 60- however there are hybrid specs that allow you to do both decently.  Again you do need gear but early on you won’t run into any problem.
---

K, if you say so, but that hasn't been my experience, I've had AFK players pop up on spy, I know they are AFK because I kill them and they never move.
---
Ouch
---
There were 4 ally camping jintha alor to revantusk last night for like 4 or 5 hours straight.
---
Maybe his server had a bunch keyboard turning dumbasses? I played on Mal'Ganis, horde won almost every BG...
---
I keep F1-5 for targeting party members (when I'm a healer,) raid markers are Ctrl+F1-8 and Ctrl-F9 is Clear Marker
---
Hot damn.  Interesting
---
yes, because if some1 kills raptor without quest active he doesn't get a drop, still wowhead records this kill and drops from it
---
Oh no, poor you.
---
So, I have 5 honor kills, I'm level 35, and for some reason I'm listed at 483 standing.  Any clue why?
---
I wouldn't touch WoW again with a bargepole, but if I could do BG's only, I'd pop in occasionally
---
I disagree, this is clearly a case of just getting good. Group up with the other 92 alliance not in the zone and just kill the horde.
---
they should remove the guards they added
---
You've had a similar experience in that you think the girls you group with aren't up to par? What kind of horseshit is that. I've played with vanilla and there's no correlation between gender and being a bad player that I've seen. I've yet to see a girl get pissed when criticized either but then again I've never criticized a girl for her gender or in a different way that I would criticize a guy...
---
So odds that Burning Crusade serves comes out / officially launch next Blizzcon? Blizzard seems to not care about content phase or actually keeping to their own states plans. Early Dire Maul and now early battlegrounds.
---
Who would make it? Crytek lost all of their engineers to CIG.
---
&gt;That is literally the opposite opinion of the chain you're replying in to all the way up top before you decided to throw logical fallacies around, for the record.
---
You asked what I would do now, given the past is the past. They have fucked themselves, there is no longer a positive solution, and that is directly because of mistakes that have already been made by people that continue to make important decisions that will affect this game's lifespan and quality. If I'm suddenly the acting God-King of Activision-Blizzard and can make all these decisions unilaterally, I do not believe that makes me also capable of making decisions that will have positive outcomes in this shitstorm of a scenario that is WoW Classic.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; They are doing this. 
---
You quoted half of a solution. They are half-assing what they are doing. It could be argued that offering Faction-specific transfers while making no effort to reduce new players rolling on the overpopulated faction may have an effect that is opposed to the original intention. As a new Alliance player, it doesn't sound appealing to roll on the server with so many Horde they are bussing them out for free. As a new Horde player, if there are that many Horde on the server that they are offering free transfers out, why not try it out, I may enjoy the advantage and I can always leave if I want to apparently.
---
Batching is truely a 2004 concept. Shit is used in warcraft 3 as well and it was used as a tool to combat high latency and shitty computers as to make it more fair for everyone.
---
Its 2019 believe it or not so I dont really understand why it's still a thing. Reminds me of playing aion with all the rubberbanding.
---
59 Druids level as feral and want 60 gear.
---
Most respec resto at 60.
---
I lived on the Archimonde Gadgetzan roof with a pom pyro mage for the first two months of the game and no one ever told me not to.
---
Are you that confident that Blizzard will cross-realm the worlds?
---
or actually do no changes and change it how it was
---
I'm not whining.
---
Wait until your nova has 4 seconds left of its duration before using flamestrike - that way you can flamestrike -&gt; CoC and still have the satyrs be more or less stacked on top of each other.
---
Not sure where you are getting the rage to use your abilities from but in my experience I'd get 30 rage just as Mortal Strike's CD ended. So I'd just be using Mortal Strike every 6ish seconds. You use battle shout and sweeping strikes too if that's what you mean?
---
You realize you probably play with girls all the time and just don't know they are girls?
---
The worlds? Nope.
---
Bgs? Definitely.
---
They are ninja looters, yeah. They took 4 items and the price they paid was leaving the server. You won't deal with them again and they won't face repercussions for their actions if they name changed. 
---
Again, you won't deal with these players on your server another time.
---
AV / WSG - December
---
BWL - January
---
AB- March
---
ZG - April
---
AQ - June
---
Naxx - Oct/Nov
---
This is the fastest I could possibly see them doing it. They'd want to give guilds at least 6 months of Naxx, and frankly AQ will last much longer the MC or BWL do.
---
Yes but at the end of the day there was no way for someone other than the top 200 players to ever actually play through anything whenever they wanted.
---
Druids with moonfire tagging spam is pretty good too. Instant dmg and no CD. Moonfire crits for 600 :D
---
Save some for the rest of us
---
oh yeah i dont even play the game a whole ton, this is mostly just to have a game to play during my free period lul
---
also damn that sounds like it would SUCK
---
You're good dude. You communicated your intentions and formed the group. Your rules go.
---
But the glory of classic is that it's not catered towards casual players:)
---
Windfury is the greatest gift a Shaman can give a warrior. Be kind to your warrior.
---
There's an options under Names in Interfaces to turn titles off I think
---
I can share my spec another time, but it pretty much follows most guides. I’m also not an expert warrior - but my previous comment and spec have worked for me!
---
Good 5 man team can cap/backcap enough shit to change the outcome of most random AV games.
---
&gt; . If I'm suddenly the acting God-King of Activision-Blizzard and can make all these decisions unilaterally, I do not believe that makes me also capable of making decisions that will have positive outcomes in this shitstorm of a scenario that is WoW Classic.
---
So what you're saying is given the bad situation, you'd make potentially unpopular decisions in a best effort attempt to resolve the situation?
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Yeah it's weird, whitemane was pretty balanced in p1. Seems like a lot of alliance transferred off or stopped playing.
---
I'm a warrior, and I am extremely jealous of literally every other classes ability to break cc.  Also, I'm pretty sure the improved trinkets were introduced in TBC, although like you, I had forgotten the original trinkets in vanilla couldn't break all CC until I looked them up a few weeks before honor started.
---
You sound like such a reprehensible person, obviously lying about what you "enjoy" just so you can pretend to share a frame of perspective. 
---
I'm guessing from your comments that you're already 60, geared, and long done with leveling, which you got to breeze through in a relatively peaceful phase 1. 
---
Now you're crying that people should deal with getting corpse camped during *their* leveling experience, because it happens to suit you now. 
---
What you'll be losing out from having battlegrounds is beyond me as well. *Sorry you're getting to enjoy engaging pvp content earlier than it was promised.* You poor thing...
---
Most damage comes vom auto attack, so adding more hit is also more dps
---
I played Alliance on Stormrage, we got stomped by the horde in WSG all the time, but AV was ours about 80% of the time.
---
Imagine making a game so good now, it wins game of the year in 2034.
---
At least you admit the type of person you are.  That's something right?
---
Thanks!
---
Neat UI
---
My server isn't nearly this bad, but by the time I get a group together and corpse run to BlackRock mountain I've lost over an hour. It's really discouraging when I dont have much time during the week.
---
I've sold every single stack of heavy leather on Gehennas ranging from ~0.9g to 1.2g a stack on AH.
---
This is why I always open on Orcs with Ambush.  
---
For plate wearing orcs?  Yeah I'll find someone else.
---
Yea I take it on the chin with regards to raid tanking, that's just the way it is. But in 5 mans we are kings.
---
Yeah, BGs are fine.  In fact, that’s necessary.  Cross-realm world interaction is where my line is drawn.
---
This wont help. The cunt roaming in massive gank squads don't care about honor.
---
If only the players had some way to know their servers were overly full before last Thursday.
---
&gt;The Org to UC zep has been camped by Alliance on my server pretty constantly. No guards spawned at all.
---
Then no one else is either.
---
Please no.
---
I enjoy playing Alliance on a Horde dominated server, there's never a lack of action and PvP is the only real challenge in this game.
---
I was a NE warrior in vanilla. Im a UD rogue now. Its mostly been a completely different experience for me and ive enjoyed it just the same.
---
Well that settles that then doesnt it? No. People got banned back then and they still are now. Not every player but it did happen lol.
---
I too failed 2 years of college due to my wow addiction. Be careful but have fun too.
---
How do you make honorless target show up in ElvUI? I have all my filters off and everything else shows except honorless target.
---
hey feller :)
---
Per the blue post, it's a bug they recently introduced while trying to fix some other performance bug related to Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer. They hope to have it fixed soon, but I'd hold off on using Jujus, Mongoose, or Elemental Sharpening Stones tonight.
---
Umm.. hate to break it to you but this post is wrong. BGs will be cross realm so the wait time will be peanuts.
---
Umm you might want to look at the other comments bud.

If I'm doing 100+ runs of a dungeon for a single item, I'm not leaving anything to chance. Not wasting 100 hours just to have someone ninja loot or "accidentally" click need.
---
Your definition of no-lifing needs an adjustment. Someone with 'no life' might play WoW 10 hours a day. You can easily finish current raid content in 5 days of playtime. So people did it in a week. Yup, that sure is crazy!
---
Except MC/Ony dont last a week. They last months. Figure 5 months if Blizz 'rushes' BWL. If you play less than an hour a day you're going to run out of content. Defining "People with one hour of free time in a day" as "no life" is ridiculous.
---
Meanwhile, my guild full cleared phase 1 in September with a casual group of employed people. Took us ~3 hours. God have mercy on our no-life souls, we dont just have one hour of freetime in a week, we have THREE.
---
stacking for the clip
---
We can venture the guess that most people taking issue with this are statistically more likely to be in the majority faction. The members in the minority faction that would complain about this change are by definition, in the minority.
---
The same kind of players with “actual responsibilities and accomplishments” that flood the forums and this subreddit because they are so “not bound to video games” ?
---
Lol :)
---
dw, I won’t be able to be in multiple places, tho I will be able to be in one place, and this place will be impossible to level.
---
Kisses kiddo :)
---
I wonder if it will drop before Darkmoon is in the game though. That would be odd.
---
The way that the person misinterpreted your post is interesting - the idea that adding BG's early is "ruining classic," and not, as you meant, that everyone rushing to 60 and farming the hell out of everything, and thus forcing accelerated phases, is ruining it. 
---
People think the vanilla experience was huge masses of people in raid gear a few months after release, with nothing to do? 
---
In principle, I'd prefer that Blizzard stuck to their original phase schedule, but I don't think it ultimately matters much, since so many players decided that they'd *play* Classic in a way that's so dramatically different from the way they played Vanilla, and actually in a way that's not suitable for what Vanilla was. It just doesn't really work, rushing through everything and the wondering where the rest of the game is. I don't think BWL will change anything. That, too, will instantly be on farm by lots of guilds on every server.
---
I bet a lot of people thought that they'd be among the few hardcore people with special achievements and gear. But now the cities are full of people in raid gear, and that gear is only special, not self-cancelling, for the purpose of smacking down the people who want to take the game slowly. So those people will quit, and then the gear will be specifial for nothing.
---
I can confirm that this is true
---
[https://wowpop.appspot.com/](https://wowpop.appspot.com/)
---
There's this site too. I prefer it over the OP's one because it's simpler and more straighforward.
---
From an old twink vet from back in Vanilla, go the extra mile and make 29.39.49. Games are better because everyone has more moves and there is less of a power gap between twinks and normals as you go up in brackets.
---
Has anyone tested this that you know of? The DM Tribute chest doesn't require you to be in the instance when the boss was killed.
---
Thank god
---
I did.  The OP is frustrated from a lack of players on his server. Then the reply was that they were happy with a massive queue because it meant their server wasn't dead.  Fully missing the fact that transfers were made to help solve the queues and dead servers.
---
Killing alliance = priceless
---
If saying Org to UC zep has been camped constantly isn't whining then saying Theramore to wetlands being camped constantly isn't whining either. Pretty simple math.
---
Whats the commitment/grind for rank 11 typically? I just want the mount lol.
---
You should have just went to pve server then.  prior to phase2 it wasnt that bad.
---
You have terrible reading comprehension if you interpreted my comment as meaning all rogues would get one of each.
---
It's just a switch they turn on basically.
---
The reason for me making a twink is that i find the lower lvl bgs more fun at times. At level 60 most ppl just want fast honor to get their ranks, and just afk once theres a really challenging game cause it will take too long to finish the game for it to be worth it. I love it when everyone in the wsg is decked out in gear aswell, killing levlers get really boring quick. And in my experience most ppl playing these brackets are twinked aswell. But the thing i like the most is the diffrent meta/speed of the games. And i like  diffrent jumps you can pull off to juke your opponents when its less bursty.

There a good video that goes into detail on what openers rouges should be using on each class and ect
---
Duly noted
---
&gt;Tab target, mouseover, and general awareness all help.
---
So, you are gonna spam tab target and remember everyones HP until you find the one with the lowest HP and then focus that target? Missing A LOT of auto shoots/auto attacks in the process? Doesn't sound very efficient.
---
So weird, You keep calling me bud, as in it impllies that I am your buddy? But I am clearly not your buddy. Pal. Get fucked, idiot.
---
Yea I know you guys are all "stop whining about wpvp" but honestly its a joke. It took me an hour to from thorium point to LBRS at 8 in the morning being corpse camped the entire time. The horde run around in grps of 30, like a pack of hornets who just got their nest kicked. I get it you want honor but how much honor you think youre gonna get when all the alliance quit because we cant do fuck all in the world just because you guys love being horde and outnumber us. A lot of people are actually quitting alliance bc the game is unplayable. Im just saying. Something to think about next time your gang raping your next victim in a 15 v 1. zug zug
---
What are they holding if you don’t mind me asking?
---
I used a bank alt while leveling my first 60 but never had him anywhere near full with decent bags and a few bank slots extra. 
---
Leveling my second character now. I just mail him stuff then immediately post on AH.
---
Ok yeah I’ll probably just wowhead or YouTube it. No worries
---
Sure bud. Let's ignore the context.
---
Weird, I've been questing up and down Felwood and Winterspring on Flamelash the last three days and I've been deathballed by alliance constantly. Today was weirdly dry on death squads but yesterday I spent over 45 minutes riding from Emerald to Jaedenar. They weren't even corpse camping it was a different group every time. Gave up trying to get into Timbermaw Hold.
---
World PvP honor system was introduced 6 months after launch in Vanilla. By all standards this is moving faster than Vanilla. Remember people wanted #nochanges?
---
I'm in one of the most hardcore Guilds on my server and everyone hates the game right now. We have people that have been playing private servers for years that are for the first time ever hating the game. Whe have people where this is their first ever experience with vanilla who loved the game up till the honor system was out now hating the game. Almost every one is having a really bad time and just don't want to play the game. This have been a really trying time for our guild as we know we will get through this when BGs finally comes out but for right now people are avoiding to play the game and when they do it is with much distaste but a bit of "this is the best for the guild" feeling to it.
---
That's the reason I hope the don't announce tbc, not without any sort of changes. We know where it all ends up, and I for one don't want that.
---
I dont get how you think I criticized a girl for her gender but alright there bud. Way to just make up your own shit lmao
---
I too have a 60 and a level 21. Nice.
---
why are you speccing into hemo if you’re using daggers?
---
It's 30 \*additional\* silver per 25 mobs. Skinning will reduce the amount of gold for your first mount that you need to gather from the rest of the game by \~20%. It's huge.
---
* Before you get Faerie Fire(Feral), pull with Moonfire
---
* Wolfshead Mask at 40 is a MUST
---
* If you have excess rage, you can queue up a maul and STILL spam swipe.
---
* Feral Charge and Enrage do not cause a global cooldown. You can immediately use a skill right after. I have a macro that just uses Feral Charge and Faerie Fire (Feral) immediately after and it saves a decent amount of effort
---
* Challenging Roar is an immensely useful aoe taunt. But make sure to use Demoralizing Roar right after
---
Don't post names, good way to get banned on this sub-reddit, also Blizzard has stated multiple times that NOTHING can or will be done about ninjaing on any level

Rule Number 3: No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
Makes sense, but I wonder why they didn't have it follow the horde/alliance flight path for Felwood then.  That would be totally fine.
---
Just create a bank alt to DE stuff. You can DE any item after learning enchanting at lvl 5.
---
Me clapping and standing ovation for you. This is so on point. If i had gold or silver whatever the reddit gbp is I would give it.
---
My issue with the cry babies is this. You choose to play on a pvp server you better expect pvp to happen. In retail if you enable warmode don't be surprised when you get killed. 
---
Don't like it? Go play on a carebear server...Normal or pve server. If not then shut up.
---
The release of BGs a full month before the release of BWL with the playerbase we have is going to further skew the experience, unnecessarily, from the original. That's probably a best case scenario, placing BWL's release around the second Tuesday of January (early 2020 was the announcement, optimistic), into a game that has accessible Honor gear that is already buffed up to its post-Naxx incarnation.
---
It's another half ass solution to a bigass fullon problem.
---
 expansion-wow has never directly attempted to address faction imbalance but instead consistently attempted a multipronged solution to many problems. cross realm battlegrounds, arenas, zones, guilds, cities and sharding. throughout the expansions blizzard hasn't ever done what they have needed to do for about a decade; establish and enforce limitations through intervention.  
---
 the development team, during expansions, hasn't ever attempted to foster healthy communities and has repeatedly opened new servers to be labeled as recommended for new players only to die soon after. new servers reliant on the list of connecting technologies can't establish their social roots when their population is so small that crossrealm everything is mandatory for the game to appear massively multiplayer.
---
 you say that people aren't going to be happy about a queue to log in and battlegrounds so much so that they won't take action to remedy their poor experiences but instead whine. i believe the opposite of this is true because those who actually whine on the forums and or subreddit are the minority. in the event that horde players need to wait to both log onto their characters and get into a battleground, the individual players less connected to their guilds will leave. in this example the alliance are so underpopulated the horde players won't have an enjoyable pvp experience no matter the venue.
---
Wayyy too soon , Activision keeps rushing lol..
---
Q times have gotten worse, if anything more people are logging in, judging off of the queue. we will never find out the exact reason blizzard does anything like this.
---
I believe the time out on flag when logged out is 15 minutes. 
---
Typically the rotation is DM Buffs (2 hour) -&gt; Songflower Serenade (1 hour) -&gt; Onyxia head (2 hour) 
---
Since MC is about an hour long. You need to preserve SF as long as possible. I’ve found that Auberdine accomplished that with 100% certainty of protection when porting to SW for Onyxia drops.
---
&gt;  It requires a lot less effort
---
Except it doesn't. That's my entire point. It's slower *and* more involved.
---
Convince other Hordes to come to Heartseeker with you! Because transfers only go one way and are only open to horde, it's a unique opportunity to have an interesting server.
---
Without phase 3 enchanted, which should I use for a 19 twink rogue in phase of the +15 agi?  Crusader/lifesteal?
---
Yeah they are rushing it and it sucks this isn't vanilla exp many people wanted . "No changes" part has been trashed long ago
---
Dead server
---
mouseover macros for healing ftw. I can't even imagine what healing is like when you have to manually select each target
---
looks more like sunset, imo
---
sunrise often has more of a bluish tone
---
I think with how readily available information is RE: BiS, specs, general play tips etc. That while 90% probably aren't die hard veterans - the general population is definitely better at the game than we were 15 years ago. Hell, i 4 manned most UBRS earlier with no real issues - i remember struggling a lot with 10 back in the day. But 15 years of experience is certainly making life easier!
---
I suggest you stop questing at 55 and spam lbrs / scholo 
---
Really good exp. 
---
Are you horde?
---
I thought that way before too but seeing how badly people price gouge on rare recipes (lion heart helm 200g per craft on my server) I’m not passing something up bc they happened to get lucky.
---
Ofc I let people know beforehand to all need to be fair
---
Plenty of the kills I get in a big raid are 20-50 honor each. It’s about honor per hour, and there’s all kinds of way to get a good rate.
---
There isn't a lot to do VS orcs as a rogue. You should just avoid 1v1ing them altogether. If you open ambush VS any mail or plate class you might as well not bother.
---
wow ur fuckin sick dude
---
damn. I saw that waist drop 4x in a row. made the warrior farming sgc very sad
---
There were a number of battlegroups each with 15-20 servers
---
There are even plenty of people questing in 1-20 zones
---
Join a guild with players around your level.  Join their discord.  Talk to people.  Not feeling them?  Gquit and find another guild.
---
Not as annoying as zap spec resto shamans. Fml m8 I feel like such a scum bag when I 1 v 3. Literslly can't oof and LB does 8k crits.
---
got it, ty
---
Full HP yeah
---
You're acting like failing classes is a big deal, it's not in the grand scheme of things
---
They did open up more servers as demand was shown to be more, they just did it too late. They also made it clear that the servers were not 1 to 1 with hardware and were a lot more scalable. 
---
Keeping the vanilla populations and releasing more servers was completely viable. And the data they wanted about the playerbase was also available.
---
at least BGs are coming relatively soon so the wpvp death-squads will go away
---
XD
---
I think it's contrarian and foolish to thing absolutely nothing will change when BGs come out
---
The only question is the magnitude and specifics of the change. There will be less people in the world when BGs open.. because they'll be in BGs.
---
That BY DEFINITION changes how wpvp is conducted.
---
? How they will have waiting time... alliant wont have. Thats an alliance advantage... or what am i missing?
---
Individual faction queues probs
---
When leveling your highest enhancement is always best. When you hit max level windfury is the only one that scales with weapon damage so it ends up being better.
---
Also whoever told you "windfury for faster" weapons is off their rocker. Windfury is % based not flat, which means your damage is only +% and you can ignore attack speed. In PvP, WF + slower weapons makes your damage more bursty which is kind of the shaman thing.
---
What’s your professions?
---
Gotcha ty
---
It's leveling off to about 60/40 it feels now that horde are being encouraged to transfer over here
---
This is nasty. Heartseeker is like 80:20 in favor of alliance, and the horde has it pretty bad with TP being unusable, BRM filled with stealthed rogues and shadowmelded NEs, and Kargath getting camped, but even then the density of gankers along the way is about 5 times lower than what I'm seeing in this video
---
But that number assumes people aren't bad. If they can't have a proper spec or not stand in fire, a flask will do nothing.
---
And by 80 you mean none, and by PVPing you mean sitting on their mounts.
---
I was young it very possible I didn’t fully grasp everything I played on khaz Modan an korgath
---
25+15=40
---
I mean, it's an option that doesn't involve rerolling. Alliance on those bad servers don't have an option at all.
---
I... don't have a picture of me in my profile?
---
Early 2020 can mean January thru March. I'd call anything in the first 25% of the year early.
---
DM:E jump runs, depending on profession/comp.
---
I use swords, but I have a barman shanker for when a target is sitting at low hp or a CB+ambush will 1shot them
---
Yeah the add on is bullshit. They need to get rid of it fast!
---
Even if you started on day one you'd still be left in the dust by 10+ year veterans.  Just play!
---
I have this issue too, some trinkets disappear
---
I'm not at all convinced camping flight points is the most efficient honour, especially with how many people kill before honourless target goes away
---
build a time machine then cause this is nowhere close to it
---
Things were broken in vanilla too.  Wouldn't be an authentic experience without hotfixes.
---
But really, shit happens and we all move on.
---
Of course not, it takes 15min. aprox.
---
Yeah not even close to 800
---
** spiderman pointing meme **
---
Dope dude. I just started multi boxing for the first time in classic. It’s a blast, and unlike what many people assume, it isn’t making me a ton of money.
---
I’d have my epic mount on my main if I wasn’t also paying for skills for 5 other characters...
---
Have heard that deleting and creating a character with the same name and then undeleting will force a name change...aka free name change after a ninja move.  Haven't tried myself to verify as I don't need a name change but this possibility could have happened if it indeed does work.
---
What is your definition of "for a while"?
---
Ice Barbed Spear, fuck yeah.
---
That was their first attempt as this bug thread indicates https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feign-death-trap-bug/278131/788
---
Blizzard never said they were going to completely 1:1 mirror the original release schedule of vanilla.
---
Also, what next, are you going to cry and whine if C'thun is not bugged and unkillable for 4 weeks? "ree ree #nochanges" ?
---
It's not something you'll see on a character sheet. This is a 'behind the number crunch' type of mechanic
---
You don't need a spy add-on when you outnumber them 20 to 1
---
That gonna happen with or without cross realm bg’s(at least on most servers).
---
anyone who enjoys 100+ vs 100+ zergs needs brain cancer to finish off whats left.
---
Well yeah, how exactly do you want me to quantify it? I don't have player data from within Blizzard.
---
But you actually proved my point for me. Simply change the first variable to 15.
---
Yes, changing the population of a fight from 15 to 5 is a massive change in gameplay.
---
You played yourself
---
Or how small plants will move as you walk through them.
---
You know that you still do mc and ony during bwl right?
---
very unpopular, might as well as not have bgs because the pvp there is now is exactly what you'll get
---
150g in the beginningis unavoidable, 6g for shadowy potion, roughly 225g for AH mats, 45g fee to use another locks summon mats. I however bought my AH mats when DM dropped to save money anticipating they would go up as i just got it other day
---
It's not being expedited by *that* much, and as I said in another comment, it's not like releasing new raids invalidates the previous ones. There are still reasons to keep farming everything from MC to Naxx, even when everything is released. 
---
You need to keep in mind also that players are also clearing the content faster and this isn't new content, either. The original Vanilla patch schedule being compressed by a few months or weeks really isn't the end of the world.
---
That rule doesnt matter on Grobb or Bloodsail. Its pretty awful. For every _passing_ rp name (i mean regular name, not even race aprropriate) theres 20 non rp names like “okboomer”
---
100 percent their fault. They released too few servers. They didn't prevent the huge imbalance between factions. They hid it with layering then all of a sudden turned layers off and pvp on.
---
Savage gladiator chestguard.
---
Real glad I’m not in your guild then lol
---
that's not how 1.12 was. 
---
no changes
---
&gt;I rarely think of pulling rage for the next pull; I don't ever feel the need to with Enrage on a 1min cd.
---
Enrage only gives 10 rage. 1 maul. Keeping your rage high for the next pull lets you have 50+ rage. 5+ mauls. You can generate more than enough threat to keep mobs on you; you don't need to spam abilities nonstop like a warrior does. It's very easy to pool rage at the end of a pull.
---
&gt;I would never pull with starfire. Moonfire is enough and is also instacast, so it doesn't slow ur dungeon momentum down.
---
Oh no, 3 extra seconds on the dungeon run, how horrible!
---
not everyone is trying to speedrun the game, m8
---
also no moonfire is not enough to hold decent threat on pull
---
&gt;I DO use swipe for anything more than 1 target and prefer to start with swipe
---
I think they cross that bridge when they come to it. They need to keep some classic servers without without any expansions forever. Then they need to allow players to copy over characters to servers that launch BC. They can see what happens next when they get there
---
The Horde to Alliance ratio looks about right here.
---
I used to get this constantly, even after my RAM tested good.  I did everything.  Reformatted, checked hardware, updated all drivers, literally everything.  After a particularly bad raid night where I couldn't stay logged in for more than 10 mins I re-did all my driver stuff and it mostly went away.  I crash very rarely now, whereas before it was guaranteed minimum of 5 crashes/night.   It's just a shitty error code that gives no context and when you google it there's a billion different solutions.
---
This is wrong. Both of your weapon swings are 24%. Only yellow swings are 9% (6% with 305 skill).
---
What percentage of the total subs do you think are even lv 60?
---
I’ve absolutely been taking my time and enjoying other games, as well as simply not getting to play as much as I would like or anticipated, but to say everyone is out of content because a 15 year old raid is pug’d?  Pretty sure the first Rag clear on my server in Vanilla was 1/2 guild 1/2 pug.  
---
I agree they should hold up on releasing things rapid fire but to say everyone or even a majority of players are out of content is a bit exaggerated.
---
And why wouldnt you want to have a better slow cancel out a worse slow?
---
There's probably more of an argument for pallies to get mageblade over healers to get choker, at least, but I still would say that it would not be a widely accepted opinion. Not all BiS upgrades are considered equal.
---
I had more than enough to buy all 5 epic mounts before my characters hit 60 because I used my main mage to carry my other characters in stocks &gt; SM &gt; ZF
---
Lucky you
---
Not with my silly 60 mount sadly. I checked.
---
So if 15 people are constantly clearing Ony the other 6000 or whatever on that same server are also bored and out of things to do?
---
cross realm will match pvp with pve alliance dominated servers.
---
sorry to burst your bubble
---
Study at school you fuck.
---
yeah man i played myself 10 less players HUGE change in the way world pvp works, get this guy to blizzard he has brain cancer like the rest of those fucking monkeys. good post man 10/10 contribution
---
I had two 60s on Stalagg too. Decided to reroll and it took me about 6 weeks to get back to mostly preraid bis. Worth it.
---
Absolute trash, go back go back to retail.
---
Awww did u get pwned mother fucker?
---
Now you're all mad bro?
---
Listing out numbers like a hood chick?
---
lol... fucking scrubs
---
30 silver from 25 mobs is not "huge" in the slightest, when you consider that drops from 25 mobs will vendor for 3-5 gold depending on RNG.
---
I would agree about choker.
---
Run around &lt;5 yards next to rogue and be unable to see them unless you have a catseye buff or paranoia because stealth is literally invisibility in this game.  Get sapped by the rogue you're looking directly at and can't see.  Catch a rogue out and fire a dot at them just as they vanish, only to have it be nullified by the immunity frames they get.
---
Sorry rogues have no space to complain when you have everything going for you.  If someone can see you stealth via their combat log with spy and start looking for you, you can just sap them as soon as they get close and walk off.  Thorns/Lightning shield won't even get you out of stealth even though LS loses a charge when this happens.
---
I've played a rogue in classic, it's insanely easy to get away from people.
---
The highschoolers on summer vacation, the unemployed, and a character who is played by two or more people.
---
Hmmmm, so the actual problem is the price of education not failing a class. When you fail you dust yourself off and try again.
---
My main is a rogue so it’s not efficient to use him to carry my team anymore since my team can run SM now. 
---
I’m sure the gold gain will ramp up towards max level but for now it has been painful haha
---
I think he's asking if they ever go away when bwl is released. Kind of like the pre nax  invasions.
---
Guess they don’t know you can toggle walking speed.
---
#RpServerMechanics 4Head
---
Just about got my 19 twink sorted so my body is ready
---
You need exalted, and it's 10g iirc.
---
Riding skill is basically automatic, as long as you have the 20g (18g with honored, 16g with r3) riding skill, you should be able to ride it.
---
This looks depressing af. Luckily I’m on PVE realm but if this was my experience I would honestly just quit the game.
---
Ambush = Squishies  
---
CS = Non-squishies
---
Ahhh the Classic WoW Alliance experience...
---
iT'S comming ladies and gentleman.
---
Well, you definitely wouldn't be, since I've got horde in my flair. It was just an example.
---
What is your pc specs to handle 40?
---
There's certainly people who just nolife hard for the honor grind, but there is/was also a lot of account sharing at the highest ranks. Although Blizzard probably has better detection for that stuff now, so it's probably even riskier than it was in vanilla.
---
Azshara. Good morning and herb zone. Lots of people farming and fishing
---
Stop with your logic and real examples, people need to shitpost and stuff like this hurts their shitposts.
---
Thats nice.  Wheres my keyring?
---
sunders?
---
On my rogue I like to get people to kind of loe health, blind them, then walk away.
---
awww someones numbers superiority is being taken away and you'll actually have to fight in a balanced fight. I feel your pain buddy.
---
40 x 15 = 600 dollars A MONTH.
---
How do you manage this?
---
they need to offer faction transfers and faction lock to encourage horde to change their characters to alliance, simple as that.
---
i mean, possibly, but even on my server (smolderweb, not the largest by a good margin) every guild that raids regularly is sub (or at least close) to 2 hour clears of MC. 
---
the hardest part of MC is getting 40 losers in the raid, and with decend dps who know what they are doing, you can blow past whole mechanics.
---
my guild has never seen ragnaros submerge, for example. 
---
makes the fight rather simple.
---
Right. It’s just a different play style and people don’t like change. Druids are perfectly fine tanks and can tank just about every boss effectively.
---
I mean were not looking to fight non-braindead people. Most of them will be in premades as well.
---
I don’t want to play WoW for the second time over forever
---
Yeah I think he meant to say **8000**
---
Cause the CoC slow has a much higher duration than blizz slow and you use CoC as they approach during your blizzard
---
Thanks !
---
Battlemasters existed in vanilla before crossrealm BGs.
---
Note that a large number of campers aren't really there because they want to be griefing. They need to get honor, this is the only way to get honor. They are competing with each other over the honor too.
---
hide your helm and let them be suprised
---
You telling me that my mage doesnt get any better at casting fireballs as he levels?
---
Nah, I aint buying that, fam.
---
Makes perfect sense that you wouldn’t understand the complaints being on a 50/50 server.
---
Imagine if it were 80/20. Imagine every time you flew somewhere there was a group of 10 waiting for you to land. Imagine never being able to go ANYWHERE without 7 - 10 ganks.
---
That’s why people aren’t happy with the current state.
---
Most welcome :)
---
I'm googlin this stuff and not finding anything. Do you have more details or links? Sorry for troublin you but as a 30/0/21 shaman I'm reeeeeally interested.
---
Nah, I’m good.
---
Hmm.  Time to re-roll shaman I guess.
---
&gt;The only reason BGs weren't in the game at launch was because they weren't ready yet not some progression system or desire to create world pvp. There were always intended to be in the game. 
---
I don't mind BGs coming early, but this could be said about a lot of things. Blizzard has consciously made the decision to include things that existed due to technical limitations or bugs in vanilla.
---
At the start of classic you could seen it everywhere as an advantage that you have instant bgs while the dominant faction have to queu. If you check out older post you can see almost every second response was this (shorter bg ques on alli side) when the faction inbalance was questioned on a server. I think its unfair and just rewarding those players who choose the dominant faction even on a 80-20 server because that have no disadvantage anymore, they are facerolling, farming without any issue and now they can join bgs without any issue too. It will cause a lot bigger problems on a bigger scale.
---
I thought those Discord beeps or whatever were music from the Utopia soundtrack. Got all jazzed up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsJXfkOlCLw  
---
  
---
Anyway, fuck playing in that environment. I'd reroll somewhere else or quit altogether. Actually I tried the former but couldn't keep at it.
---
Thanks! I'll try.

Durotar and Badlands have always reminded me of Utah. The color palette and plateaus just scream it.

My 60 Druid is running this spec:  https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5050501303022151-055023003
---
Sitting at 343 +Healing and decent regen.  Getting a legit 2nd healing trinket would really help but overall healing, once I geared up a bit, has been good.  And getting the gear was really pretty easy.  People are always looking for tanks and you can just scoop up any unwanted healing gear.
---
I've run as DPS too.  Not topping the meters but not terrible either.  And groups like having LotP, GotW, and a brez.
---
Only reason I'm not playing him right now is I'm trying to level a mage so that I can get the next tier of tailoring.  All the excess cloth you get from leveling toons adds up.
---
are the servers down for anyone else? I don't see the usual notification for maintenance or anything
---
DOH!
---
At 10 I was running from Elwynn Forest to Westfall. At level 3.
---
so you deleted a char then created a lvl 1 with the same name and when you restored rhe deleted one it let you name change? If that works imgonna try it tomorrow.
---
Can you dual wield a brutality blade with mirahs song?
---
Oh how new is that? I caught up a week or 2 ago and this arc is just excellent.
---
Why do people get so offended by people pointing out when someone is being a cunt? This is like next level white knight shit.
---
Well i wish i could say im surprised to see blizzard doing the exact same mistake they did the first time.
---
Appeasing the cry babies - they joined a pvp server and got killed and cried and cried and blizzard listened, AGAIN.
---
WPVP is dead and AV while i did enjoy it - im hearing this is the latest which is by far the worst version of it.
---
Great.
---
Unsubbed, was fun while it lasted.
---
bingo
---
Windseeker, you can’t get a group for anything. Been like this for around a month now.
---
The alliance are the same but there are never enough around them to zero, lol

Are you a warrior on skullflame-eu or is it someone else with the name redvelvet?

I've killed atleast 50 players doing the Ringo quest in ungoro. I farmed 4500 gold there so far and I murder every single Ringo quest doer I see. If its red it's dead.
---
Bro I figured out last month that Blizzard is holding back content to keep people paying 15 bucks. Maybe you will get finishing next year?
---
Just curious your screenshot on your web page is during BC, things could be done alot quicker in bc.  Did that have an effect on your speed leveling ?
---
You're right; I'm thinking about this from an optimized tank pov. I like to run quick smooth dungeons.
---
Okay?

The point is that its better to sit through queues than to transfer, so transferring is an absolutely horrible idea.
---
Blizzard has historically not given two shits about dead servers, so there is no reason to think they'll change for classic.
---
Past your bedtime, boomer?
---
Devilsaur and herbs or mining?  Jesus that’s good
---
I don't think the two items he mentioned exist
---
I thought it was 20 plus the base 5 holy shit lol
---
I'm glad I'm daggers now
---
I'm not personally very concerned about it. I will still prob be playing classic years from now if the servers are still up, but I think the undeniable reality is that once the no lifers clear all the raid content they will likely jump ship. The faster the patches come, the faster this will happen.
---
Fishing event comes with ZG in phase 4
---
you think a lot of new players are coming along to start playing a 15 year old game?
---
People went to the extreme with different herbs and ore or anything out where you could get pvped to avoid farming mats instead of honor. Plus trying to farm mats right now is rough.
---
There is no 800g training, you only have a 20g training option.
---
A regular epic mount is 1000g (900g with honored, 800g with r3 + honored).
---
Wouldn't be surprised if the guild leaders have a bunch of flasks on the auction house
---
No XP in BG's (At least any significant amount) otherwise twinks wouldn't exist.
---
Nope. Not in classic.
---
Wanted to play rp in this game. I'm sure it really exists outside of a few people who refuse to give in.
---
the other Darkmoon faire turn ins drop right now.  Seems possible.
---
You can grind in AV
---
Horde now: faction specific queues/transfers are a terrible idea. Just form a raid and roll them
---
Horde servers in 6 months: ugh our servers are empty, there's no Wpvp and I don't want to grind BGS 10 hours a day. THANKS BLIZZARD.

19 bracket will and always be the best bracket.
---
Good post
---
 What is the Mage PvP gear? Is it pretty much a mix of raid and farming gear? Like stats (int/stam) and SP? Or should I go heavily toward stats instead?
---
2-3hr BRD run to save princess, we get to the room and "15 MINUTES UNTIL SERVER SHUTDOWN" is spammed. 
---
Tried to clear the room as fast as possible, with 1-2 packs left we get booted.
---
Grim times.
---
There is also more 18 Hour/day gamer pushing the breakpoints up
---
Yeah I'm really glad I left that shitfest tbh
---
I would love if they took a leaf out of 2007scape and took the game in its own direction, faithful to the original ethos.
---
Thanks for the downvotes, bud.

Scorch

This is why I ALWAYS check their Twitter/Launcher news before doing something I know is gonna take an hour+

official server forums
---
Oh right right I keep mixing that up
---
Yea I thought that might be the case, I am mostly running dungeons at this point as world pvp at &lt;60 makes anything other than farming mats for ROV unbearable atm. Even farming sucks but it is a necessary evil, not complaining am excited to pvp but is not the priority right now. 
---
\+ first time wow player so dungeons are actually one of my favourite parts teamwork and clutch pulls floats my boat. The allure of respecing is getting more points in destro which I sometimes use in 5mans, shadow bolt ROF etc, do you think this is still a good spec if I plan to do dungeons to 60?
---
Caring about points lol
---
Same shit on my server. I'll actually just drop this account at some point and start over somewhere else. Is there any balanced server in EU/Germany? I wanna play for the horde this time but I don't wanna be on a server where the balance is as fucked as in the video.
---
Honestly, it feels there aren't "unholy hours" anymore. I thought going to Silithus at 4 am to farm Rich Thorium in the hives would be a good idea as most people would be asleep. Not only were there a bunch of Rogues already doing that, a Shaman was camping the boat from Menethil to Theramore. 4 am!
---
I'd stick with the lock and occasionally pop back over to burn through the rest on your warrior. This way you get to enjoy your first journey to 60 on the lock, and by the time you hit 60 your warrior will be through the worst part of warrior leveling. Furthermore if you decide you want to go back to maining a warrior you'll have a great farming option via the lock. Endgame Warriors are basically gold trashcans without a lot of great farming options so you'll be happy you have the lock to support him.
---
Totally fine with me
---
HOLD UP HOLD UP HOLD UP. I was under the impression that BG came out with phase 3, which would be several months after phase 2. Are you now telling me BG Comes out dec. 10th? Just BG or all of phase 3????
---
caring enough to downvote people immediately after they make any reply lol
---
do you like your own comments elsewhere too?
---
I always get a chuckle from your art, love your style
---
Yuck. So why even bother logging in?
---
Did you just make this up
---
KNow what you mean! I only few a couple hrs a night if im lucky, so I get pissy when I spend time in black and white
---
&gt; \-Use spy and detect rogues from across the map. 
---
I already do that. I KNOW there is a rogue next to me. The thing is, he can walk away from me thus become stealthed again before my instant-cast dot lands. My spell who is *supposed* to help me fight rogues, is completely useless because their movements aren't subject to lag, but my spells are.  
---
&gt; \-In stealth, rogues are moving 15% to 30% slower than normal walking  speed, use this to your advantage and mount up or have swiftness pots  available to get your spell in during the batch window. 
---
What do you not understand when I say that IM ALREADY NEXT TO THEM. I see the fcking rogue in front of me, I have him in target. A swiftness potion wouldn't make my dot land quicker, wtf ?  
---
&gt; \-Every class has to deal with negative consequences of batching, rogues  can get their vanish batched with an AA and have it do absolutely  nothing, a sap can be missed on an enemy due to them moving out of  range. Heals can go off during the batch where a tick of damage kills a  friendly unit, (even though you had a successful cast and used Mana) 
---
I. Am. Not. Talking. About. Spellbatching. I'm talking about how spellbatching's delay doesn't scale correctly with movements having no delay.  
---
Yes, every class has spellbatching. But classes that rely on certain machanics, notably instant-spells or in duels against rogues, have it worse.  
---
&gt; \-I highly doubt they'll change batching because it's highly engrained into the vanilla system 
---
I don't want them to change spellbatching. I want them to make it so that spellbatching isn't 200ms behind players movements.
---
yeah, faction queues after a particular ratio is reached (pve being alliance majority isn't an issue since horde won't be camped), with a few overflow servers one can transfer to that does not have that restriction (note: they'll be strongly horde with very little wpvp).  So, a new servertype called 'balanced pvp'.
---
There, fixed.  Bliz could do this in a week.
---
He earns more than $600 a month
---
They can take each others names.
---
Maybe 20 minutes? However long it takes you to: leave MC and clear to UBRS, then have a couple of priests grab the Spellbinders and spam buffs on whoever needs it (there's a 40 second cooldown on the buff) - we chose to use it for the first couple of Rag kills since we didn't have an FR capped tank and were struggling to beat the submerge.
---
ahh okay yea you’re good just making sure you aren’t mistakenly speccing hemo in a dagger build
---
Fishing event came out with ZG in vanilla lol
---
Clearly someone else is as well though my man not just me take a hint maybe and just take the L and move on instead of complaining about downvotes?
---
I'm gonna join the game looking to have some casual fun only to be fucked up beyond recognition. They wont be able to ID my body.
---
This is probably why I'll just leave the BGs to the twink honor grinders.
---
Well fuck you.
---
Ah, trying to get everyone to go to YOUR camping spot huh? Less competition? Nice try, bud! I see through your schemes!
---
Are you not supposed to spec into hemo if you're using daggers?
---
&gt; Oh, and also ony buff doesn't grant AP to hunters at the moment.
---
or ever lol
---
This has been posted like 500 times. Just stop it already
---
Both sides do it. One side just does it 6x as often because they have 6x the players. Imagine getting corpse camped 6x as often as you already just complained you do. You'd probably be a little irked yes?
---
I’m still hoping for the day they merge low pop servers or allow for paid transfers. So I’m hanging in for it lol
---
Seriously, no PVE accomplishments will be seriously done on a PVP server.
---
Hord scum!
---
Skeram Alliance PreBis 60. Unsubbed today. Not worth my time.
---
It’ll probably be 20 or 30 when BGs come out. Hell, 10-20k honor a week will probably progress you until you reach r6 or 7 and then it’ll just maintain your rank.
---
&gt;Just seems like a cop-out to blame it on my gender?
---
Are we reading the same screenshot here? they are blaming you for being shit and blaming your bf for bringing someone who is shit into their group who happens to be their gf. I don't know how this even becomes a point of conversation for people to know in the first place but hey ho...
---
phases aren't a thing, content is released as people cry for it
---
So you regurgitated an already stale old meme and thought it would be funny to post here?
---
THEY JUMPED Hahahah
---
Sweet that was an awesome chapter!
---
AV is fun and relatively easy to grind compared to all other BGs
---
You can tank well enough in a feral dps/leveling build, but healing is rough without talents.
---
Ony, and a lot of AP buffs.... Never applied to hunters.
---
That's probably your standing for your level if I had to guess.
---
Yellow attacks are absolutely not more DPS for a sword rogues than white attacks? Do you even play a rogue with damage meters? Auto attacks are more than 50% of overall damage
---
Currently leveling a warrior and thinking of next alt/side leveling. 
---
I'm crossed between
---
Undead priest
---
Undead mage
---
Orc warlock
---
Any recommendations on which one to level? I'm not locked in to being a specific role in dungeons or raids, I'm looking for enjoyment while playing. Which as weird as it is, I've had fun leveling a warrior even tho some claim it's boring.
---
Yeah,
---
Look at it from his point of view too though, you say he is well geared so it's likely he has committed the time to farm his BiS set whereas you are waltzing in having not done that step and then taking gear. It's kind of a slap in the face for some people that they can put in the effort that is helping your guild clear things while others are doing the minimum and relying on the raid to gear them.
---
Personally think he's being a whiny bitch about it but I imagine that's the perspective for him.
---
It is but I've met some really great people and love my guild. It would be hard for me to transfer off since honestly I suck at being social but with my guild things just clicked. If they choose to move off I would follow in a heartbeat.
---
You offering dances? 😏
---
#nochange is not an excuse for bugs; vanish was broken in vanilla too and it took them until wotlk to fix it.
---
is there any difference between lesser invis and invisibility potion? if so, what? other than the 3 second duration difference.
---
Vanilla: WoW up to 1.12, 2006/7
---
Classic: WoW 1.13, released 2019
---
The "current ones" are the Classic servers.
---
I like the theory it did end, we're just all in hell now.
---
dagger specs are generally based on backstab crits primarily, and either on cold blood for additional burst or improved sprint for mobility.
---
hemo is not worth the 4 talent points to pick up in either of these situations, though you should take 2/2 improved sinister strike to hit it and avoid energy capping if you just can’t get behind someone or to build an extra combo point for a kidney shot
---
As a mage, I solo’d Guard Mol’dar in DMN 55x for Sublime Wristguards. Would’ve given up earlier but the gold/hour wasn’t bad.
---
Awesome! I always wanted to do this, but I couldn’t justify the cost lol
---
No PVP server has an 8 to 1 ratio though. The worst Horde dominated is 3:1. Get out there and bust some skulls.
---
Blind, I guess not...
---
No, that means YOU need more content. my guild isn’t doing that. no one on my server is doing that and there are guilds who have 4 MC’s a week. 
---
You play the game for content, I play the game cause I actually like playing with the people in my guild and I would bet more are like me than you. 
---
You can finish the game in 6 months and whine about blizzard, I’ll enjoy this for a few years with some cool people. 
---
My guilds got 10/10 in 2.5 hours and I still log in monday-sunday to chill with my friends.
---
If you can find a lock who already has the last quest items (250g) then 400g should be enough but you'll be left broke. If you can't find anyone to help share their final items you'll need another 250g for that part too.
---
Mining and fire elementals. I have personally farmed 420ish elemental fire, usually sold at almost 6g each. Mining the nodes that spawn there is usually 3 mining nodes an hour with the route I did. Also had a constant offer to kill blazerunner for you, for 5g. About one kill every hour on average.
---
&gt; In Vanilla, yes, some guilds were way ahead of others, but there actually weren't that many guilds on each server that could clear BWL, so just starting MC while the best handful of guilds were killing Nefarion still felt like being in the thick of things.
---
This is spot on and a key difference that people don't really seem to get. In vanilla there was maybe 1-3 guilds per server who could clear the latest content. When Nef was endgame, maybe 1-2 guilds per faction on each server could kill him.  Guilds were working on Rag 2 years after the game came out. People were spread throughout content, and lots of guilds were still farming MC and trying AQ at the same time. The difference between &lt;5 cutting edge raid guilds and half the server pugging ragnaros in greens and blues is huge for the experience you're going to have in most aspects of the game.
---
The solution from vanilla wow was to kill the Honor System and introduce something new, Arenas.
---
A big portion of this will decline over the next couple of weeks, but for those who are going to try to do the grind they have no choice but to engage in this system.  I've said repeatedly the fucking honor system was godawful. but people want their CLASSIC EXPERIENCE.
---
You dont speak for all of us
---
I have a feeling Naxx will be near impossible, IIRc there is a fight that splits into two rooms - another fight involving the postive and negative - headless horseman.
---
If you can complete those by yourself, i’m sure many would tune in to watch.
---
Congrats!
---
You can't buff someone you MC unless you have 2 people for starters.  Secondly, unless two people sat around and waited until right before a lower level headed towards a mob this wouldn't work.  All  that being said a much better way is if you're a hunter.  What you do is you tame an animal in that area.  Next, you use eyes of the beast and put yourself into "walk" mode.  Then you pat back and forth as if you were an npc.  Once a lowbie attacks your pet (with you in control of it via eyes of the beast) that lowbie is now flagged for pvp and you can kill them.
---
Too many OC memes is a bad thing, TIL
---
People who want spell batching to stay or justify spell batching are the people who never played vanilla and dont know that the game never played like shit like this does.
---
Its not an intended outcome, this mechanic was added when people had shitty internet.
---
I went in a pug with like 35 people.  I used no consumables as a healer, and we killed all but 2 bosses, and the reason we stopped is because it was late.  Long story short, you should leave that guild.
---
NAXX US OUT
---
This is how low end raid guilds are, almost all of them. Extremely petty and unorganized players. 
---
In my opinion stick around get some more exp under your belt then look for a way into one of the higher end guilds on your server with organized raiding and dedicated raiders who want progression and team growth over petty shit like loot. 
---
Best of luck.
---
getting this bent over a typo OMEGA yikes
---
Multiboxer cheater! stop being a dick head and talk to some people this is a social game you prick
---
Nice
---
You are wrong on all accounts here.  Yesterday I blinded a rogue at the same time he blinded me, due to spell batching.  This happened in Vanilla, because of spell batching.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
I've seen a few say they have run out of content, so I assume they have the time and lack of content to come on here and find something to complaint about.
---
I just hit level 40 and I'm chugging along at my own pace. I got other shit to do so I play when I can. Doesn't bother me.
---
They were expecting dead servers by now though. Cross realm made more sense back then.
---
Haha no, it'll be
---
&gt;Why are these queues for horde 2 hours! Alliance have a 60 second queue! Allow us to disguise ourselves as Alliance to do Battlegrounds! I don't want to play Alliance.
---
Are you being intentionally ignorant of the fact that Roguecraft was before DR was added into the game?
---
Going over hit cap doesn’t matter you will still be benefiting from white hits and thats where all the rogues damage is usually from
---
morons copying and pasting each others answers, starting to look like copy pasta as many times as I seen this comment today, nearly word for word.
---
Mate, you are in no way a jerk for reserving gear. You’re finding Jed yourself, you’ve gone to the trouble to get the key yourself, and you’re letting everyone know before hand what’s on reserve. 
---
I did the very same thing (for the offhand though)
---
You just need to keep two sets of gear as you level up. Spec mostly feral then dip into resto. Look up the HoTW build. I leveled my druid and tabked, healed or cat dps'd all the way to 60. From dual healing UBRS to tanking dire maul, you can do it all well enough
---
I would not recommend a rogue for pvp or farming.  With how crowded servers are and all the addons everyone has being a rogue/melee is a bit of a nightmare in pvp.  And for farming hunters or mages are better.
---
I would suggest a rogue for raiding.
---
*popcorns in PvE*
---
From my experience this is quite unusual behaviour.
---
&gt; also nuke windows updates and do them manually
---
Oh look, another hearsay fad about fixing your computer, and as usual, it's completely ineffective and ass backwards.
---
I was literally an UD Rogue in Vanilla P2 and no, it was *nothing* like it is on the high pop high imbalance servers.
---
We were outnumbered, but nothing like this and there wasn’t this kind of player density. All my “secret p2 grind spots” have at least 5 mans hitting them regularly.
---
I've unsubed over the balancing issues being on the minority faction, started getting Angry at being overwhelmed all the time and unable to get anywhere, I found it best to move onto other games when shit like this pisses you off and out of your control, I'm voting by taking my money elsewhere.
---
Yep it’s insane that such a thing exists, which gives your character extreme ESP.
---
It depends on your server. Alliance has a huge advantage in the rush strategy so it's possible to lose every single game and then it'll take substantially longer.
---
Well done
---
I believe some mobs also have base spell resistance kinda like how the Fire/Water(ice)elementals are immune to fire/ice spells respectively. Demons= shadow resistance(not necc immune but noticeably lower damage).  I know it’s not much help but just a little tid bit :/ I’ve played the game for a while I’m just not the best at explaining the theory crafting part of the mechanics
---
Right. I didn’t say from the start of vanilla, just that it was that way in vanilla. So reach further next time I guess
---
While he likely did only read the title, his answer is correct though. People are that petty sadly.
---
That makes me want to play alliance on herod now. Shit
---
For the horde!
---
I couldnt get it to load at all
---
To be fair...
---
I love this movie! I came in here hoping for people to quote it like mad but.. I was disappointed :(
---
That I understand as a quality thing. Yeah, all gorillas have coarse hair, but not all of it has the right properties. 
---
Collect 10 Zehvra hooves to prove you killed them? That isn't a quality issue.
---
You mean the pushback? No.
---
The top guilds always tore through everything. Who cares?
---
BWL won't be as trivial as MC and Ony are. People who rely on PUGs or guild alliances full of casuals won't be tearing through things like the suppression room or Chromaggus. Hell, maybe not even Vael. By the time AQ40 comes out, which is IMO the first "modern" raid, there won't be servers full of people clearing the raid in an hour.
---
But still, there is no solution. Its a 15 year old game. Its been done and gaming culture is totally different. We're just getting older.
---
If you are not enjoying a video game but continue to play it, then you're what is commonly known as a moron.
---
Skarm is an absolute legend. The only alliance player i respect ;)
---
instead of actually playing the game all you do is spend your time on reddit posting about how you think people should play and when someone doesn't play the way you think they should they must be lying. 
---
reroll pve bitch boy.
---
Replace i told you so with "switching to retail"
---
In my head canon, i feel like the reason those items don't drop is because while we fight the mob we have damaged those necessary parts that it's not worth looting it.
---
This is a babyrage post to It's full extent  
---
How exactly are you supposed to get gear in this game?  
---
I've ran about 5, 6? Molten Cores so far, and maybe 6 or 7 Onyxia  
---
When pugging, most runs seem to have a +1 rule, and atleast 7 other people of my class, which makes it essentially impossible to win a piece of gear, and If i do on the offchance happen to win something (Hasn't happend so far), I will for sure not win anything else
---
If i do a guildrun, I am not on the loot council, so obtaining gear is also essentially impossible, and I have to spend 250-300g on consumables weekly, 
---
 loot will be defaulted to Officers/long time members - and Yes, I do think this is fair, they have spent even more money due to being in the guild longer. 
---
Do I just bite the bullet and spend 2000\~ gold to have the chance to obtain a piece of gear? or do I join pugs where my contribution does not matter, and spending 2000g would still leave me at essentially no chance of getting gear?  
---
I am very curious what your guys takes on this is, and how you managed to get geared
---
The domicile is like, right before you walk out onto the platform that's on the other side from the bar (towards Warder Stilgiss). Grim Guzzler is of course the bar, and there's the arena, and the one where he spawns right the fuck on top of you. So of the ones I can think of, domicile is the only non-obvious one.
---
So I want to change the name of my main and heard of this method.
---
Delete main &gt; create new lvl 1 character with main's name &gt; restore main and get prompted to come with new name as name is already taken.
---
Does this actually work and will I be breaking the rules, laws, geneva convention etc?
---
Thanks
---
It's definitely making them money. A lot if it.
---
Kind strangers of the internet: do we know if there will be battle-masters in Capitals yet?
---
Wow, I haven’t bought my epic mount yet so that’s nice! I’ve read some old wowhead comments that said farming exalted only takes a couple of weeks too
---
I wonder if blizzard is planning on doing anything about this, its obviously a problem - itll be interesting to see if they leave this unaddressed mostly or if they just wait until BG's come out.
---
On top of that, optimal AV is a PvE race to the boss. Meanwhile, WSG can take hours if neither flag master dies.
---
If the honor wasn't so amazing, I would hardly do BGs.
---
best way to prevent unwanted reboots.
---
There's a lot of miss information about hit especially on this sub.
---
First thing first. We are talking about the YELLOW hit cap. This means all your abiltiies will land. Your auto attacks has an additional +19 miss chance, so getting to the point where everything hits is practically impossible.
---
Yellow cap: The cap depends on your WEAPONSKILL. If you have +5 weaponskill or above, your yellow cap on lvl 63 mobs(bosses) is 6%, if you have less than +5 weaponskill it is 9%. As a rogue you gain +5 weapon skill basically for free. Yes this means your yellow hitcap is 6%, and you already gain +5 from talents, so you only need 1% from gear to never miss abilities.
---
As for hit after that yellow cap: It's still a good stat. Hit in itself is superior to crit due to hits unlocking the potential to crit, but since auto attacks only make up about 55-60% of your dps, hit after yellow cap is weaker than crit. The ratio is around 0.66-0.75 crit = 1% hit. It depends on your other stats obviously. So yeah hit is not that big a deal, but ir is not useless, and the whole system of "downprioritizing hit" is stupid. If you have the option to gain say 1 hit + 10 AP, instead of 1% crit, you do that.
---
you seem very social...
---
Haha funny joke, there's a rogue on the grom'gol zeplin more often than not on kromcrush.
---
I had 24-32 hours a week of work, high school, and after school sports. 
---
I had my pally at R5 (Sergeant Major), my Orc War at R7 (Blood Guard), and a lowbie mage alt at rank 3 (sergeant). For *months*. And I never focused on PvP, it was usually just something to do after dungeon burnout. 
---
My point: Rank 7 isn’t a grind, it’s playing on a PvP server. You *will* have to grind past that, but I suspect even R14 won’t be a horrible experience considering there’s no time limit. Classic (unlike vanilla) won’t end, and everyone that wants R14 should be able to get it provided they’re willing to deal with the “warlord/marshal socialite group”.
---
I wanna be rank 10 and stop there. Would 20k every week get me there?
---
I find it weird already that i got rank 3 with 15k when i've seen people with 90k being only rank 4.
---
Good, glad that doesn't work then.
---
This is wrong.
---
What are you talking about? Blizzard said, “[...we’re also aiming to capture what it felt like to play in a realm community in original WoW. To do that, we’re planning to mirror the approach taken by original WoW].”(https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346) 
---
And why are you being so hostile?
---
I was in the crater farming devilsaur and came across a 52 alliance who had the name of my deceased grandfathers favourite drink..
---
Normally i’d kill for honor but I spent the whole day ignoring him, running up and giving him a /kiss and /hug haha.
---
The next day motherfucker tried to gank me with a friend while I was killing a devil. 
---
I haven’t felt that betrayed in a long time.
---
Will BGs give XP? might be the only way I resub as a level 53 druid.
---
so just fuck every horde player that rolled on a big server? i don't think most of us rolled on these servers so we could dominate alliance or even thought the faction balance would end this bad when we rolled our characters. if i could go back i'd roll aliance but i don't want to lose all my progress.
---
Yes but not completely eliminate it
---
What pvp rankings? Is this a website?
---
Well I do have Necropile set + some other blues with good stats. I think those will do atm. Raid gear will hopefully change it to the better.
---
Maybe I can start questing without getting ganked as much when this drops lol, probably not going to happen
---
Did this exact run as a warlock with no escape buttons, amazing how far you can limp while hamstrung before 3-5 horde kill you.
---
Ya, turns out they don't really care about gpa only that you have the degree lol
---
hahaha thanks for the laugh!!!
---
Did they confirm that BGs will be cross realm?  They weren't in vanilla.,
---
? what's the context.  It's happening to alliance way more anyways.
---
both. problem solved. i'm horde on whitemane and i'd change to ally if i could to help the balance.
---
No, it started off 65/35. It was constant horde tank parties and honor wasn’t even out. Guildies we’re quitting left and right because there was no way to level and that was with layers. We left Skeram and haven’t looked back. Our guild is thriving and so much happier.
---
From your perspective I'm sure it looks that way :)
---
Whitemane Ally here. At around the same standing, ~550, with ~15k honor.
---
You probly killed me at some point. :)
---
Heard Naxx was pretty hard
---
Confirm/deny
---
Be sure to use mind control often!
---
I found my priest to be waaaaay more fun after using MC on people.
---
Bad stuff:
---
Run someone off a cliff.
---
Drown them.
---
Good stuff:
---
MC, then give them fortitude buff.
---
MC to prevent someone on your faction from attacking them.
---
MC mob in a group to weaken itself and another by fighting. Dismiss the mind controlled "pet" before either one dies so you get credit for the kills.
---
I enjoy chasing players of the other faction, telling them to /wait, then MC for the buff. It has led to some weird interactions when someone of the other faction sees me and they'll attack me, only to stop shortly after. Probably because the dude I buffed asked him to! (Then kill them both to remind them that horde is da beeesssss)
---
by data I meant the strongest few weeks or month was pulled. I havent logged on in over 24 days now. How many people actually still play in general?
---
I think there was a bit of competition for best named guilds at launch between Bunnings, Centrelink and my guild Winnie Blues and VB Crew, unfortunately we folded WBVB, our guild leader got too busy with eve online
---
As someone who has played private servers that didn't have battlemasters, I can honestly tell you that battlemasters is a good thing. It doesn't really feel epic to fly somewhere to queue for a BG, and you don't really get those world pvp actions, I mean you do, but it's literally the same as queueing from org and flying to felwood to pvp in queues. Ultimately it only serves to be a huge annoyance to casual players who just want to do a couple BGs for fun, and those are the kind of players the honor system desperately needs.
---
Bye, friend. Didn't have to post it twice in the same thread.
---
Laughed out loud. While on the jobsite. While eating lunch.   
---
Also - it was CFA; so it was mosdef better than okay.
---
I'm in the same boat. Spent last night trying to get an answer from watching some YouTube videos and it sounds like if you don't have NS you will be severely handicapping yourself in pvp. However, if you still want to tank dungeons you can do so with tank gear but for wpvp/bg's you should swap some of your tank gear out for gear with intellect. If you were a serious raider you would need to respec. This is just my take from watching some videos would like an answer too.
---
you're not very good at picking up sarcasm, are you?
---
Then my point still stands that it would be better for the person transferring to be the only one effected.  These people transferring in would make a ton of gold and be at an advantage to the server.  They should leave those things behind and that way their destination server would be very minimally effected.
---
I'm not really sure how to get my point across, I think everyone is missing it by miles
---
&gt;  c) the advance of "meta gaming" between 2005 and 2019. 
---
This will be a big issue for BGs too. AV, for example, is a PvE race when people start playing optimally.
---
Nah but the best memes are from Yojamba (undead comic guy tall frodo is a Yojambro)
---
Yes a semi hardcore guild that uses DKP.  Rolling for gear in raids is asking for bad behavior and dtama.
---
It’s a little sad to see. Very early on Skeram actually had good faction balance, maybe ever so slightly horde favored. Slowly one by one ally guilds started to leave with the free server transfers. We heard rumors from the horde side that guilds knew they would not be able to compete for world bosses with the juggernaut of Onslaught on the other side as well as very good guilds like Rise and Reign competing on the ally side. This caused a cascading effect until it was near exodus of the alliance as their numbers dwindled. 
---
Many players made the choice to leave because they didn’t want to be on the side with a disadvantage. While you can blame the players for making this choice, I still blame blizzard for letting get as bad as it has gotten. They could have stopped the bleeding much sooner. Anyone who looks at Skeram and thinks it has always been this bad and that the horde are to blame have no idea what they are talking about.
---
I have much respect to the ally guilds who have stuck around through it all, especially Reign and Rise. That being said, I look forward to making sure they never make it to MC with world buffs ever again. :)
---
PS let’s start a petition to force Mind Games to transfer off, who says no?
---
This right here is why I'm making a 39 twink. Never done 39s but I'm excited
---
Dont buy every rank of every skill though.  For instance, you dont need more than rank 1 hamstring until 60
---
50g for t2
---
what a piece of shit lol, I paid 150 for baron cape and would happily pay 200 or 300 to a guildie for t2 pants
---
And you didn’t have to post this once :shrug: Visibility for blizzard to make change. GL.
---
Point of zerg ball is to kill more to make up for lower HPK(Honor per kill).  
---
I did small mans with my friends and we run into a few and got some kills and had some fun, but in the 30mins or so I was part of a death ball I had 5x the kill count. Died a few times but still.
---
&gt; 6 week gap between honor and BGs in OG vanilla.
---
8 weeks
---
970 evo worth it over a normal ssd? Been eyeing it off - also do you use a sata or the n.vme (whatever its called PCI) version?
---
What's jeep stuff?
---
It's really not that bad at all. It seems like you gain more rep in AV than any other BG and there a bunch of quests available that make the grind relatively easy.
---
I’d love to see some!
---
I really need to share what Heartseeker is like. I would love for it to be this light for me.   
---
Legit 300 alliance raid corpse camping 100 horde trying to get to MC. Killing anyway near the chain or jumping in to the lava with extreme prejudice.
---
Imagine thinking that what I said is gatekeeping
---
I’m a bit of a noob myself but I’m my personal opinion I would switch to better ping. It only took you a week to hit 25. I feel like 50 ping is worth a week play time.
---
Literally 1HK (65 honor) got me to 183 standing on Ashkandi Horde. PvE servers are just silly.
---
The difference between getting rank 3 and 4 is massive in terms of effort. 
---
Assuming everyone gets the same honor etc. next week and all weeks forward, it is not possible for you to hit rank 10 off this. The absolutely maximum would be rank9 and that would take you a very long time.
---
I'd say go for this until BGs come out, then consider increasing the amount of hours you put in weekly. Try to focus on playing on weekends since BG weekend will mean a signficant boost in honor per hour there.
---
Pretty much. They’re rushing the hell out of things.
---
 Go back to bfa, classic isn't for you.
---
Well yeah. The aoe/cleave leveling meta, the reserving items in dungeons, the selling of BOP items, the abusing of DM for endless gold farm
---
okay now what.
---
yes
---
Hey! I play a Warlock called Phenomenal, I think you and I murdered a bunch of pirates in Tanaris recently. 😮
---
Or let him enjoy the game the way he wants to? He is doing pve content, not insta killing people with 25 moonfires on a boomkin.
---
Was said on reddit that it worked.  Take that for what you will but definitely do not be 100% certain about it.  I never tried was just throwing out a possibility I read on here with no fact checking if it worked, just a possible scenario for this situation.
---
"Hence to fight and zug in all your okey-dokey is not supreme excellence. Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemies dabu without work-work."

Cruz the Peon.
---
But how about head/lets enchant taking up a buff slot D:
---
It’s actually 8 weeks. Sending, then after 4 weeks, it gets autoreturned then another 4 weeks ensues.
---

---
I've already canceled my recurring membership. Bliz will have to really change my mind and show they are ready to listen to their player base to make the game fun for all not just for the hardcore. If they only want a hardcore audience, that's fine. But I'm not paying for that service.
---
This is why PVP servers can go suck a fat one...
---
Oh yeah I'd still die a decent amount, hasted MC would basically 1 shot if I was too close and wasn't ready for the 7 second break lol
---
It's cheaper, but in the time it takes to get the mount, you could've farmed enough gold for several alts to get theirs.
---
Hey bro got stuck at work still here as soon as i get home iam going to help u bud .. Sorry :(
---
When youre twinked, in any bracket, you never have bad games though. I remember doing twink vs twink, lvl 19, in TBC and those were *fun* fucking games. In fact they were a lot more fun than simply blowing out the opponent.  
---
I dont know why people on this sub seem to think that people who want to pvp or twink simply want a huge advantage all the time. The most exciting wpvp is when its a 1v1, especially if its a rematch from a prior day and you *both* remember each other. The same is for BGs. In fact, people want BGs because they dont want the stupid steamroll meta that has been happening currently.
---
Monthsbehind.org
---
Because spamming AV and ignoring the enemy raid gets old fast.
---
Yup, you essentially have to stealth up in the base and walk, great game.
---
I did this, but I think a 2nd person has to take your old name
---
and then you restore the main
---
so should i get 3% chance to hit to reduce it from 96% chance to hit to 99 ?
---
IS it cross realm?  It wasn't in vanilla.
---
Imagine spending 6-8 days played getting your character to lvl 50+ and rage quitting over something so stupid
---
They chose to raid with guild that does rolls for loot...the guild leadership is really to blame here if they didn't tell people beforehand that they can win a roll and not get gear because they decided to change the loot rules in the middle of a raid from Need Rolls to Loot Council. This should have been known before the first pull.
---
Loot council/DKP awards people who put in more effort to their characters.
---
That makes no sense.
---
Even if a person is literally gold capped and transfers, do you really think thats going to impact the economy of a realm? Conversely, if they did it your way, the player's realm of origin could be fucked if he just gives away all his gold and items because hey, can't take it with me.
---
Paid transfers have never and will never severely disrupt server economies. There are just too many people. A huge amount of transfers will be PvP to PvE too, so theres no earthly reason to believe someone on a PvP server with contested resources is going to be at an economic advantage to people who have been able to freely farm.
---
You are genuinely worrying about something that is demonstrably a non-issue.
---
Did you watch the video? This rogue with every avoidance ability available died like 6 times before reaching the gate
---
lmao, really pulled the "I have actual responsibilities and accomplishments" excuse in world of warcraft, we all know dude is a piece of shit that spends way more time posting and bitching about the game he wants to play but doesn't actually play
---
Is having updates enabled and letting them install normally, like when you go to bed, pick "install updates and shut down". W10 does not force reboots unless you postpone installing updates for weeks.
---
Because they didn't advertise the server as a 4:1 ratio?
---
He's the best pirate I've ever seen!
---
It's fun for horde knowing that the alliance people hate themselves.
---
People trying gto get high rank will spam AV races and ignore the enemy raid.
---
No point in consumables there.
---
Frostbrand, be a rebel
---
Someone should make an addon that works in tandem with classiccensusplus and uploads it automagically on each login (since census writes to the file on logout). I try to upload when I remember but it's hit or miss for me, and I'm sure many others.
---
That said, Smolderweb also needs horde census data.
---
Isn't it 100g discount? 800g instead of 900g?
---
Such a shame, the original phase 2 was like 2-3 months
---
This sound too much work imo, it would be almost like if they created somethink we could call, pve. Don't think this kind of server will ever happens
---
Good riddance
---
"Check your privilege."
---
But yes.
---
Just rightclick the hordes portrait ingame and send a battlenet invite
---
&gt; World pvp used to be about small groups facing off, which showcased skill.
---
who the fuck thought this, you? 
---
you don't have to join that 200+ group. there are other places to go, ive been playing on faerlina solo perfectly fine farming honor like it's time to harvest crops.
---
It lets people level up multiple different classes simultaneously, I can get a mage, warlock, warrior &amp; priest all to 60 at the same time while others have to do 1 at a time.
---
Don't move!
---
Don't breath!

Don't do anything except... pray, maybe?

I have played since launch... I try to play every single opportunity I have... I am level 58.   I know 3 rl fiends who play and they all just hit 60... I am baffled and confused about all these players decked out in gear and have been 60 for a while unless they litteraly don't have jobs and a family.  I like watching swifty and Asmond because they honestly do it for a living and are so far ahead so it's kinda cool to see how it would be if you could play more than an hour a day...then log in reddit and everyone seems to play as much as them.
---
I've used both. Horde is definitely peferred because the zones are more organic to go into. Alliance is perfectly fine and works well.
---
I preferred that (appspot) one too, but the one OP linked is made by the same guy who makes the addon and the addon itself prompts users to visit said website.
---
It’s just as bad as this on Incendius. As a mage, most of the time I resurrect, blink and then immediately die, then rinse and repeat until I get to BRD. Stay strong my alliance brothers!
---
"I would like to share data"
---
**Does to not share data**
---
Someone else has to take your name, diff account.
---
When I say try-hards, I'm talking folks spending hundreds of gold trying to min-max because they are scared of actually playing with skilled players at 60. Twinking in WoW is all about trying to get an advantage over what you expect are just bad or casual players not taking BGs too seriously since they are just trying it out while leveling.
---
Aren't AV premades more efficient? 
---
Just completely ignore enemy raid and rush down boss.
---
We could see exactly on our raid today on who was taking the advised fire prot potion and who did not. Everyone who died instantly did not. The ones who survived with a sliver of HP did. We still killed Baron, because we have good people who mostly follow consumable advices.
---
So the av mount is only 20g?
---
&gt; those BGs are going to have a queue probably at least 20 min for horde, and none of them are gonna chill in orgrimmar doing nothing.
---
Yes they will because the honormaster is in Org. Nobody wants to constantly run back to the honormaster.
---
Yeah man it doesn't take 45 minutes for Ironforge to load like WTF
---
I don’t think it exists. 
---
Tons of boots/ second winds tho.
---
44!? What are they priced at on ur server? They go for 350g/ea on gehennas
---
I will definitely try yours out next play through. Speed is preferred but was never really the focus with guides for me. I'm the type of guy that gets distracted and will take forever to level so if I have a guide it keeps me focused.
---
I honestly liked WPvP before phase 2. Experiences encountering opposing faction players felt much more organic: sometimes you tolerate each other's existence and go on about your own business; sometimes you help each other out with quest mobs; sometimes you do silly emotes at each other; sometimes they gank you; sometimes you gank them. Every one of these situations were possible and the "sense of danger" came from not knowing how each counter will player out.
---
Right now I can't land in Thorium Point or Light's Hope without immediately hearing opposing faction rogues go into stealth and stun-lock me seconds later. Doing anything besides roaming in ganksquads is a futile effort and WoW isn't just about that.
---
If your Guild is using flasks on molten core they're doing it wrong in my opinion.  Specially since you say some of the members are stacked.  Personally I would not be flask ing for those runs. Also if I were you I would either find a Guild that does DKP or you need to be the one that organizes a raid then you are in complete control. But if you were in a Guild where many pe.ople aren't geared then you should expect for it to take some time.  It took me 5 runs of molten core before I got a single piece of gear. Make sure you are best in slot in all your other pieces because that will help to influence loot council.
---
K,now do the math using NA launch to BWL instead of eu launch.
---
Same, spent a half hour getting camped by Horde in Searing Gorge on (Not so)Fairbanks. They keep killing you past the point of honor return and then they wonder why the scarce population of Alliance on the server want to bounce the fuck out. 
---
We let this happen in live and it killed PVP servers and turned them lopsided. We need faction favored queues and faction limited character creation for realms at this point otherwise it's going to play out exactly the same way.
---
Druid gets Soulstone for Battlerez.
---
Hunter if you can farm a t1 set and get a leaf, that will last you ages for PvP.
---
Shaman if you wonna be valued more in a group. You can use some set blues, a shield and anyone 1h with spell power and still heal, sustain and burst effectively.
---
Later in the game hunters sort of “die off” in effectiveness, whereas ele shamans kinda pick up with the end game raid gear used for pvp. Issue is you need to heal raids and the set gear gives healing power not spell power most the time. You may be about to get away with a 50/50 build and dps and heal though. Shamans are super useful for pve. Totems trivialise some fights, windfury totem makes warriors and rogues beg to have you in their group, and some of your gear isn’t available to other classes (mail sp/hp/int gear goes to you only).
---
/tar &lt;name&gt;

---
Tell me it's not broken.
---
Ya but you wouldn’t of known I was there if it didn’t tell you
---
IMO we don't have it that bad on Rattlegore. I've just finished questing from 51-52 as an Alliance priest in Un'Goro and was only killed by 60s about 3 times. Granted, it's prime raid time.
---
My guild had only downed Rag twice and haven't killed him before the submerge yet. We still don't flask at all, waste of gold.
---
That's exactly how I feel, which is why I'm so sad that I canceled my sub. That experience is why I rolled on a PVP server. The genuine interactions. Gank squads might as well make it retail, just in a different way. The experience isn't about the people, it's about who outguns who.
---
nah hell no. I am on transcendence and this site says 30/70 and that isnt even close to true I believe! Sure horde is more on that server but never ever 30/70!
---
It is unique but it is really not a part of this games history. Back then we didn't have those numbers of that active players on realms and we also didn't have our modern mindset towards these kind of games. That changes alot.
---
How are you buying power? They can still only get the same stuff you can. They choose to level 5 alts at once.. more power to them, I chose to level all mine separately so I can enjoy it. They don't get access to anything you dont
---
I hate that they are rushing content. I was really enjoying getting 1 quest done every 2-3 hours :(. How dare you blizzard.... How dare you.... lol
---
The tanks in my guild have our own loot rules for tank gears.  
---
Priority to main tank on first gear that's an upgrade, than it goes round robin.  
---
This guarantee main tank is always getting an upgrade, but off tanks still getting upgrades if more tank gear drops.  
---
Once main tank is geared, they'll stop rolling on anything while it's being rolled between the off tanks.
---
Thats not how it works
---
While his behaviour was somewhat childish I consider any person who reserves loot to be scum. If you cant handle the rng go play retail.
---
Goteem
---
I’m level 53 and have played exactly once in the past few weeks. I have a limited amount of time I can play each night, and no I don’t find it fun taking an extra hour to have a full group getting to BRD because everyone literally has to corpse drag the entire way there from the flight path.
---
If you had 2 hours to play a game in a given night, would you want to spend half of that time spirit running? And because you only have 1 hour of alive time, you now don’r even have time to do a dungeon run, ao might as well quest...oh wait you just die trying to quest too.
---
Predictably, WoW Classic has not been fun for sub-60’s since phase 2 launched
---
&gt; "lf tank brd arena chest reserved"
---
My personal favourite is "lf4m need tank healer mage brd anger runs HoJ reserved"
---
Here's my rule of thumb with SSD's:   With a normal hard drive when you're doing something disk heavy your computer may spend 90% of its time waiting for the drive.   With a normal SSD it will probably spend more like 10% of it's time waiting on data.  This means these things will go about 10x as fast.   Now you're only spending about 10% of your time waiting on data so no matter how much faster of an SSD you get, you'll never get things to go more than about 10% faster.   There's more complexity to it than that, but it's a good rule of thumb that the difference between a spinning disk and an SSD is far far bigger than the difference between a good SSD and a great SSD.
---
Theres a whole lot of risk for the 10+ horde camping the flight and dock at feathermoon. Super risky.
---
are you actually gonna set here and tell me how me and my friends play? Sending one person to orgrimmar and summoning them back isn't hard. any optimal premade is going to be playing with a warlock and mage for that reason alone.
---
People commenting in here must have not played back in Vanilla. The batching did not feel like this at all. They artificially tried to recreate it and it really is messed up.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/JpaOqsD) is PvP server.
---
Imagine being such a huge dork loser asshole that you think this is fun or acceptable.
---
The fuck, you've run dungeons with mages who wanted payment for food/water?!
---
yep the second dead on brickman and his response " I CANT HEAL THAT!" WHAT?!?!?!?!?
---
You have the sick staff, pop a shild on him and spam flash heals, AND STAY OUT OF RANGE FROM THAT SILENCE!
---
You're totally right! How could someone possibly deign to do something simply because they enjoy it. The audacity!
---
this was both fascinating and sad to see.  I like wpvp but encountering constant raids like that and with spy on top of that sound awful
---
Nah I'd boot them from the party for that, dps is dime a dozen.
---
And Siphon life! Nothing like dotting up 3 mobs and watching your HP bar fill itself.
---
Rimworld is fun again, hopefully Red Dead Redeption 2 gets cracked soon and can give that a try.
---
It would also be in the tens if not hundreds of thousands even if it only recorded every kill for people who are on the quest.
---
Thankfully, they're ignoring your needs
---
wah.
---
I tried out Everquest a few weeks ago. Took a while to get into because the dated UI and lack of many QoL features that are just common sense nowadays made it hard to play but once I got the hang of it, I ended up loving the game. 
---
WoW is the result of taking the short comings of games that came before it and ironing them out while perfecting what they did right.
---
Everquest was one of the pioneers of the genre, a true major landmark in history. Without EverQuest WoW might have still happened but wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is.
---
Well, Classic anyway. Retail is... Whew... Retail could learn a LOT from EverQuest, actually.
---
Peace be with you, Brad. You were a true hero.
---
Blood is boiled from spells or just splattered all over the place and too hard to collect
---
Alriiiiiiiiiight, time to finally come back.
---
&gt;  which is the majority of the experience of classic wow
---
Huh?
---
Glimmering mithril insignia
---
Is there a good spreadsheet out there that shows what classes should get priority on what raid loot?
---
Have you ever seen a turtle engulfed in a pyroblast?
---
He’s annoyed about how whiny this community is
---
Yeah. Umm, I realized that months ago as well. Look at us, being smart. Totally realizing things... ok, I never realised it. Even after 2 classic characters.
---
Fuk em
---
No, but those bosses would be broken by this stupid change for one.
---
People are so quick to think up ideas without thinking of other stuff too.
---
i'd kick the mage
---
The pop thing says Herod is 39/61
---
Bubble safely removes the debuff, you don't have to run away if you can bubble.
---
Yeah. It's in your bank dude.
---
It never hurts to just grind out a level. You will be surprised at how fast you level and the amount of loot/mats you get. When you're done, some of the orange quests become yellow and things kind of fall into place.
---
If you are in a group to do content together then no you should not be paying.
---
A lock isn't going to turn around and say 1g for a healthstone 1g for a summons, a rogue isn't going to charge to open a chest, a pally won't charge to buff you.
---
I ask myself this everyday
---
Someone should mention tab targeting to OP. 
---
The macro is for when shit hits the fan and you need to mark on the fly. The issue is not targeting the mob to focus. You have to target them to get the FF up let alone the raid mark. I guess the issue is not having to poke around with all of the raid marks that I have carefully tucked to the side for use when not face to face with baddies.
---
Bigglesworth 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
---
great now alliance crybabies can whine that horde premises beat them in bgs all day instead of in wpvp
---
You're spending real world money to buy an advantage over others. Getting hit by a frostbolt sucks. Getting hit by 5 sucks 5x as much. They are able to bypass grouping for elite quests, because they have 5x the firepower that another player has. If youre in a dungeon with 3 of them, and one of the 3 accounts need an upgrade, they have 3 rolls vs your 1.
---
Fuck me that’s frustrating. Will be able to confirm in an hour or so when I’m home *cries*
---
Fuck em
---
Learning opportunity for me then, fantastic- I'm going to be looking in to this one. 
---
Had you picked alliance, Private Parts sounds pretty lit
---
Its not hard, but most people won't bother spending 10 minutes traveling so you can maybe get 10 minutes of PvP before the queue pops.
---
I can confirm that this does NOT work, I was locked out of restoring a character with the same name as a character I already had. Been struggling to figure ot if there is a way around it or if I just have to make one of the characters from scratch.
---
Yeah, I sometimes soulstone my alt with my main by alt f4 closing the game and logging in quickly.
---
There's nothing wrong with reserving gear as long as you're up front about it, which sounds like you were. Dude was a douche.
---
you poor thing =(
---
Yeah guy is just an asshole.
---
With the spirit neck though leveling guides do say to stack spirit to minimize downtime with mana regen, that being said on my hunter no way would i roll need on a blue healing piece a healer needs. It's actually the big thing i hate on my hunter, weapon upgrades can be tough because yeah it'll help me as a stat stick and is a clear upgrade but i just know that warrior/rogue is going to really get more out of it so i pass on it and don't get the upgrades i could get...
---
Is that the collision class computer?
---
It is ONLY blizzard fault one faction is more popular than the other.  Get a fucking grip.  They have better PVP racials and a lot of QOL changes to quests compared to their alliance version.
---
Why do you think most MDI teams were 90% blood elves?  I guess that wasn't blizzard fault either.
---
I feel like you would need to overly communicate  this. I almost had a situation building a group with the item reserved for our tank. It was in the add, then I even whispered  the last guy and there was no response. Finally before going I spelled it out again now linking the item in party chat, at the guy sees it for the same time and leaves.  I'm not sure if he was not aware of the item or wants paying attention but clearly there would've been drama.
---
They are just greedy bastards (usually from retail) who are more in it for the money then helping out people...
---
I've never charged and never will, for tanking, healing, buffs, food/water, etc.. I'd much rather help out my fellow players, guildies, and community in general!
---
I submitted a ticket asking this question. The answer I received was "reroll", and I'm quite serious.

That is a difficulty. But it takes time. 4 piece shadowcraft is also better than the piecemeal stuff however as well. The best way is to start with 6 and still run for the other one off pieces for when you start breaking the set.
---
Holy shit isnt that against tos?
---
Congrats from &lt;Straight outta Orgrimmar&gt;
---
Yeah Siphon is great, after 44 with Shadoweave I just dotted and ran by a mob and pulled more, almost every time
---
Sort of. It was a target transfer server.
---
Man, Blizzard needs to come down hard on this kind of behavior! Did you tell your realm forums about this guild?
---
"most people" don't even bother keybinding so to be honest what you are saying is irrelevant to me.
---
This is one of those mandela effect moments, somehow we've merged 2 timelines where people like you and myself remember playing with various add ons that read combat log info to announce when an enemy faction player was nearby and these other people lived in a time line where these add ons (and in some cases the combat log info itself) just did not exist! More research is needed!
---
I don't ever explicitly charge for water, just hope for tips. Sometimes I expect a tip, sometimes I don't. For 5 man dungeons I don't expect anything. I usually have time to make it while buffing before we start. Pvp I do expect a tip, as I wouldn't be making it without you asking for it. I can only make 3-4 stacks before I run out of mana, even one stack means I need to drink before I go attack something.
---
Nah, leaving a defense squad is a mistake. You risk wiping out the other faction and starting a turtle.
---
Better to just full rush.
---
I love the faction based q's idea!
---
Fer da hord!
---
Not to mention BGs share the same elements that make MOBA games so enticing: teams of equal sizes fighting over objectives. Right now I am either having my experience ruined by deathballs or ruining other people's experience in deathballs. The honor gain is decent when I'm on the winning side, but it gets old really quick because I'm spending 80% of my time spawn-camping solo players.
---
$600/mo to spend all that time just to find out what you're attempting is impossible
---
Is this a gym membership?
---
and the amount of player who do the minimum effort to count are much more. if you tryhard its easier.
---
the problem is there's nothing backing up the abuse when it happens
---
if the people reporting were reverse-banned for false reports then obviously this problem would be solved rather quickly
---
but blizzard lacks a spine, so you're gonna just keep having this shit
---
Or you stealth close enough that they go a bit crazy dropping their flares and spamming aoes, wait for them to calm down then gank them when they've used up more of their mana doing that
---
A solo priest can buff someone they MC as long as it's an instant cast that breaks the MC.
---
If you try it with PW:F  or renew it looks like it falls off as soon as MC ends but that's only because you can't see buffs on enemy players. Pay attention to their health bar or cast MC again though and you'll see it sticks.
---
Yea I gotcha, but not winning rolls in pug group dungeons seems irrelevant to me. And I agree, I’ve put in a lot of time as well and attended every raid at that point. I’ve been running a lot of dungeons with friends and bought some pre-raid BIS pieces as well (DM Tribute sale).
---
The solution is they reroll Alliance. If telling Alliance to reroll PvE is a fine solution then so is that.
---
There’s a section on the drain tank guide describing that saying it isn’t that good:
---
IMPROVED CURSE OF AGONY: Increases Curse of Agony damage, but by a measly 6%. You typically don’t want a fight to last the full duration of CoA anyway, making this talent pretty lackluster. Grab this only if you don’t really like the other options.
---
39 and 49 are the most fun imo, 39 because basically every class has a huge advantage because of the gear availability (there are a lot of BOEs and SM gear) and 49 because most of the classes are pretty fleshed out by then and you can actually capitalize on honor a lot more.  Can’t wait for bgs!!
---
Thank you, usually what is the goal from a 5 man team on Alliance side?
---
That was a WotLK raid correct? Are the releasing it again or something?
---
to follow streamers
---
Nobody is saying that there wasn't spell batching. People are saying its way overturned or at least fees that way. It was pretty rare for two people to sheep each other or whatever where it basically the norm. Its probably systematically correct,  just modern hardware makes it feel so bad.
---
Interesting that may very well be the answer to my problems, have you tried it?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-1853/files
---
Is this enough evidence?  I believe there were other addons similar to this too. There was definitely one built around BG targeting which did basically the same thing.
---
Trade it for print screen functionality
---
The heals probably arent nice tho
---
Plenty of us have 40 manned multibox up to Nax. We did  it on private servers that had more advanced macros. MC should actually be quite  a bit easier with mostly warriors  in the raid
---
Nah.  I don't think I'd ever have the balls to reserve an item--no matter how badly I needed it.  But I have no issue with people doing it if they're honest about it up front.
---
Since it's for a research project, what make you say women are underrepresented in the population? Going off a percentage of total human population or off a known ratio in wow?
---
They said a lot of things they've changed since then.
---
Kirtonos alliance is pretty much identical to this too, level 56 warlock trying to get to BRD takes about 60-90 minutes from thorium point or morgan's vigil.
---
No, the subreddit said 65% of people had reached lvl 60 and 35% had not.
---
It did say that over half of people hadn't cleared any raids though, neither MC nor Ony.
---
You are killing them anyway - and a lot of instances have mobs you can skin. I skin inbetween healing &amp; its a few silver each time. Literally paid for my mount, herb was the real disappointment this time around.
---
R3 on Faerlina cuts off at Standing 1150, and is about 12,000 honor to get R3. R2 cuts off around 2200 honor. 
---
R4 cutoff at about 90,000 honor (100 standing)
---
It requires upfront thinking and deciding, rather than get to boat. Then while swimming (or water walking), you have to micro manage your character to not go swimming deeper. I fully understand why people take the boat every time.
---
But which reality's curse is that linking too? Our reality? Or the reality for people who claim these add ons did not exist. Someone call in the scientists
---

---
Another link, here showing it was working as early as 1.10.
---
I’m working towards it. It’s my first chat since playing about ten years ago. I’ve been studying dive’s guide religiously 😃
---
So, imagine this.  The servers are often quite unbalanced, but horde overall has just a marginal numbers advantage in population.  Your alliance side dominated pvp servers have alliance ques and your horde side dominated pvp servers have horde queues for BGs.  Lots of people sitting around wanting to pvp with no one to fight because they aren’t xrealm.  
---
What are all these bored horde pvpers going to do between games?  Why they are going to go camp the alliance on their realm some more.  So while the alliance get insta bgs on pvp servers, god help them if they want to farm or quest or run to an instance.
---
I played horde on a pve server in vanilla and my server was very very alliance dominant.  I had very short queues, from my understanding alliance had an hour+.  What you want would also punish alliance on pve just because of your bitterness towards horde on pvp servers.
---
I'd be gone lol
---
Pull 1 mob, mostly autoattack to build up rage (obv you wanna dump excess), then pull 2, dump rage, heal up, rinse and repeat. At least you're not autoattacking mobs to death 1 by 1, even if it is painful
---
Cuz $
---
Well quest guy should specify og recipe or extra crispy
---
nah it was easy, my guild cleared it while I was grinding to rank 14
---
A
---
I don't think anyone signs up to be slaughtered like sheep. And I don't think anyone that rolled pvp server minds getting ganked occasionally.
---
Reroll Alliance if you want to pvp
---
Appletini?
---
Being in a guild trying to speedrun is a totally different matter. Being in a guild that expects you to buy flasks for a speedrun but doesn't distribute gear fairly is even worse.
---
It's just luck, then if you are losing pug rolls. That's why people join guilds.
---
People shouldn't get fast tracked for gear because they are long time guildies or friends or on the loot council. That's plenty reason to leave.
---
A typical thing to do with new members is have them do a trial run with the guild, where they won't get any tier gear (but have a chance for off tier like non bis rings when everyone rolls) and then if they perform fine they start at the bottom of the list for gear. If you've run 3+ MCs with the same group with no gear, you should ask when you will be getting gear and if it's not clear or soon, leave.
---
I've done 4 MCs and 4 onys with the same group now and have a nice cloak, and the arcanist gloves and hat as well as a fun item from ony (the off hand book). I won the cape and book by rolling, but that's still 2 pieces of gear I got because it was my turn and that's fair.
---
This is magnificent
---
Some twinks are more dungeon drop geared than others.  A 19 hunter requires remarkably few boes for example.
---
I'm on your side, post these links to the guys claiming they didn't exist.
---
You make no sense.   Effecting one person is better than the whole server no matter how small.  Still no argument against that from the 8 people freaking out downvoting me.   Probably people that want to transfer and abuse the new economy.
---
Well feelings aren't facts.  They know how big the buckets were that spells batch into.  Also it has been changed to be more responsive on retail back in like 4.x or something, so anyone who has played in the past five or nine years or something is going to think it "feels off".
---
Congrats it's my first wow char ever so i'm learning everything as I go, well if by some miracle you are on yojamba then hmu we can do some lockshit.
---
It's classic WoW without the honor because people want to PvP they just don't want people incentivized to PvP and kill them.
---
Rich salt mines with their cancer crystals.
---
i think you're literally the only person, well you and your friends, who will actually sit there and port people to the Battlemasters and whatever the hell you're talking about, no one will do that, literally no one.
---
Ok. And how's that going? What exactly is the incentive to leave? They dominate everything. From being able to go everywhere they want without being hassled, farming gold wherever they want. Imagine having those luxuries. 
---
WHY would you even consider leaving?
---
https://youtu.be/53dcatmqd8U?t=1409 the clip happens at around 24:20 of the other guild talking about how they are reporting him and how he got muted
---
Hah!  You’ve turned wow into a gacha game!
---
Reserving is 100% legit. I have never done it myself and in most instances there are other items for others and those people can join. There is nothing limiting who can make groups so anyone is free to make a reserve-free group.   
---
Group making process is a pain so you have the perk of making the rules. In my opinion there is no such thing as a absurd or dick rule so long as you made it clear from the start, no one is forcing them to join your group. Don't ever feel bad for making a group with clearly stated rules.  
---
If you haven't done so I recommend doing 5 man Jed/Rend runs, if you aren't doing a full run there is no need to have more.
---
Petty enough to make posts about loot i guess.
---
So when i get deathchargers reins from rivendare i can sell it on ah? :D
---
It's not so much a PvP server but the fact that Skeram is 70/30 Horde/Alliance.
---
I made a Druid on grob and have had such a great time already with the community so far
---
Pretty cool concept. Makes the world feel more alive
---
Its a pug
---
The concluded based on their data that women are underrepresented. That is what happened. You realize the word "conclusion" is still valid to use outside the rigid constraints of the scientific method, right?
---
i actually had the exact same thing happen to me. I made a post about it, thinking it was bugged; then ended up just abandoning. I think i went to like 124 before i said fuck this. It was on 9/10 as well. first 9 came in 15 min.
---
Forming a group is always an option, but with multiboxing you are in complete control of all accounts and dont have to rely on others. 
---
And any group that has 3 mages &amp; priest when + dmg/healing gear drops?
---
The real problem with trying to twink our a 19 without a 60, is that you won’t be able to afford to buy your 19 any of the gear it really needs to be competitive with the other geared out 19s that are going to be running roughshod over the BGs. 
---
I think getting to 60 to finance the twink is your best option, but others may feel differently
---
Oh man I wish I had a period to play wow in school I'm jealous start writing down what u hit an  play with the numbers to make a case that ur doing it for math
---
39 FTW!
---
wow i thought it was bad on herod. i would say these horde are pathetic but blizzard is also to blame for this shit. they went through the trouble of adding "layers" so that questing was manageable early on but didn't do anything to prevent faction ratios getting out of hand
---
Would you mind telling me what spec you are please?
---
Grats! But why Comic Sans....?
---
If no one else in your guild acts like this and this person keeps up making you uncomfortable I would bring it to an officer or guild leader.
---
Is it everyday? I was under the impression once you hit rank 10 that’s when the 14 hour grind starts. I think you can pvp “casually” up to 10 then hate yourself for a month
---
I've seen people mention being banned for false reports but i don't know if it's legit, this needs to be send to a GM to review and that guild needs some punishment.
---
I can't believe there are people who'd do this.  If you join my group, I'm dropping a minimum of 60 waters on you literally the second you're in range.  I have never asked for a tip even to a stranger asking for water.  It costs about 5-10 seconds of my time, which is not long enough to even consider a cost.  I would kick anyone from my group that would charge a group member for something that cost nothing more than mana.
---
Your the one that doesn’t understand you can’t balance the pvp player base because people will choose the stronger faction. The game needed balancing changes and possibly some transportation changes (just look at boats and zeppelins and where they go/ how they connect quest hubs) 
---
If Paladin buffs were not brokenly good for endgame raiding, pve servers would have the same imbalance. 
---
I’d love to see a seasonal structure for classic, with changes here and there that allowed blizzard to try to dial in the balance closer.
---
What are you doing going through my comments and replying one by one fucking weird dude. we are going to do what ever gets the most honor and if BG ques are going to be long we arent going to sit and wait on it. sucks this sub isn't competitive at all everyone is so casual.
---
Totally agree. Some horde guilds would do the right thing, for sure. This is the solution. Or at least the only decent shot at a solution. 
---
Faction based queues is good in theory, but it's too late and would have a very insignificant impact. No one's going to abandon their MC-geared characters to roll alliance.  I sure as hell would not.
---
NTA.  Reserving gear is fine.
---
preists are nice to rogues, 
---
They're a bit condescending but they're nice.
---
Mages are dicks to rogues tho
---
beechbone is my guildie. Cool guy :)  
---
G U A N O G A N G
---
If you’re in a group with 4 mages and a priest and dmg/healing gear drops you’re still rolling against 4 other people, 3 of them being controlled by the same person changes nothing.
---
Yeah I'd be good with a mid to late Feb BWL drop, it's a January drop that scares me
---
Big brain.
---
Unfortunately many people like to pretend that clearing works first mythic level raids.
---
How many times did you wipe before the tank started having his gear break? 
---
And yea, this has nothing at all to do with him being a hunter. So idk why you gotta throw us under the bus. 
---
As for FD, its just somethin you gotta get used to as a healer. You can always ask the hunter to make a macro so that he automatically warns you in /p when he's using it.
---
\*Said the rogue\*
---
I did it just fine. And there are no mechanics to MC bosses. Quit acting like this shit is hard.
---
It’ll still be cleared in a day.
---
It's a game based almost entirely around loot. So yes, the answer is yes.
---
they're just getting ready for Shadowlands.
---
Doesn’t that mean ranking is a lot kore competitive on alliance?
---
What mobs drop 3-5g per 25 mobs at level 15????
---
Private server players miffed that someone is making it easier for "casuals" to catch up to them in gear.
---
Soooooooo insecure.
---
Warlocks have huge threat generation via shadowbolt crits he should be wanding if hes getting aggro off you.
---
For you though using shouts/tab sundering mobs min of 2 sunders a mob and taunting on cd is your only prio. 
---
The rest of the threat management is down to the dps
---
It's not MC, it's later content. And yes, it will be hard for people with full time jobs because you're not raiding easy content once a week, you're going to do multiple raids with multiple consumable demands.
---
No. Spy is helping the dominant faction find people to kill.
---
Not a bad idea except for the poor Shaman.
---
Bro just give me your account details. I'll log in no problems and help you out!
---
Hope this TBC meme dies. Do you really want your 40-50 man raid team to be split in half come TBC?
---
I didn't know what rp walking was either :) thanks for taking one for the team.
---
Well the community were the ones asking blizzard to put it in so they could have whacky double cc in PvP and gauging blinks. It wasn't going to be in classic until we asked for it.
---
You can cast it on others too, right? Just had that happen today, saved my life seeing people rush me as everyone behind me died to sappers
---
As I've explained in another reply, we didn't have the same experiences. True, with phase 2 things got a lot worse, but when I was playing there were still those wannabe rank 14 pvpers and their buddies claiming zones/areas and corpse campinf you until you switched zones or logged off. You'd have the usual zones, stv, tanaris, that were pretty much a war zone, which is to be expected. But the same was going on in Desolace, Badlands, and even in the Hinterlands and Arathi. 
---
All this is made even worse by the fact that there are a lot more zones in the game favoring horde than alliance, since horde quests and towns were added pretty late in development.
---
4Head
---
As a mage, I'd say providing water for your party members for free is a must. They will assist you and can't do so without mana.
---
On the other hand, when a random person whispers me in Orgrimmar requesting 5+ stacks of water, I am expecting a tip.
---
I just ragelogged from Incedius alliance because it's far worse there atm than this video shows lol. Far worse
---
IMO, Spy helps people avoiding ganks more than it helps people performing them. The exception is during corpse camping, like in this video.
---
They didn't provide any details about their data. You just assumed a whole bunch of stuff lol.
---
Hope this helps?
---
Why is it going to be 20 minute queue time for Horde? This isn't retail where everyone is playing Horde.
---
If you're 305 swords you only need 1% hit from gear to reach 9%.  The first 5 points of weapon skill = 3% hit chance.
---

It's useful for crafting the ony cloak, so a fair price is whatever people will pay for it. Probably like 30g tops
---
Agreed I've easily had hour long runs into BRD.  I want it out there I'm a staunch defender of Alliance on our server and will argue for anyone else to stay, but I definitely understand why my server seems to have gotten worse.  My friends list has halved over my time in skeram based on people leaving the server.  My guild still tries to throw fishing events and other RP fun times for the other Alliance though to try and make it more fun.
---
This is not down to age, this is down to maturity, which sadly there is very little of amongst the community in general.
---
This is for the special attack hit cap.  Your autos eoll still have 15% miss chance at 9% hit.

&gt; how in the absolute fuck is that fun for them?

It's not, but there are a ton of super try-hards on this server, and they will do anything to rank up.

Now they know where to look for you and other stealthies.
---
Not by you
---
By 50 you should be marking on every pull 3 or larger. Charge in, use both of your instant abilities that generate rage (forgot names), sunder the first mob (the one you marked) and taunt it, sunder the others, then go back to sundering the the marked one.

It's not cheating, blizzard has said they don't care if people multibox. Get over yourself.

---
I loved the psionicist. Never seen a class like that in another game, it was just so cool to me at the time
---
Damn dude, I have some people saying I should hold out for like 350g and some saying it’s only worth like 10g. I’m at the point where I’m just contemplating just leveling tailoring  and using it since I’m gonna need it for bloodvine anyway.
---
I always pay, from vendor you pay 35 silver (?) for 5 waters, mage has better water, and they are most often fine with you only paying 1g for 120 water
---
Yup.  With WF, HoJ and 13% hit from gear and skills it's 60% of my DPS.
---
Is rogues still good at 29 bracket?
---
I can see some people wishing they have more alliance to farm. But not enough to make people who are geared-out to want to give it all up and switch sides.
---
Its fucking brutal. I sure would not. I would honestly enjoy the privilege of being able to farm and go wherever the heck I want at any given moment, and rarely messed with by the opposing faction. Although I wouldn't participate in these ganks, of course I would think its sure nice being able to go to BRM in 3 minutes, any time I want.
---
Yesterday on Fairbanks I spent 45 minutes running into BRM on my warrior, to log close to MC for raid that night. I died somewhere around 12-15 times. And that was hours before primetime.
---
So while it's so one-sided on some servers, and some people aren't getting as much action as they'd like... there is ZERO chance in hell I would trade that for what I'm currently experiencing.
---
Congrats from &lt;Continental&gt; Benediction! We downed Ragnaros for the first time just last week. It’s an awesome experience! Hope to see you guys around.
---
What?! You realize that APES is on a PvP server right?
---
Not Heartseaker, I would say which but I’m in a very mature guild and don’t want to out it on this account due to the history of it, even though I have told the guild of my junkie past.
---
They provided the detail that women are underrepresented in their data! Literally the statement you’re taking issue with in your comment. This could possibly be minimally ambiguous, but their call for more women respondents to answer their original questions leaves little doubt as to what they mean by “underrepresented.” I will continue to assume you’re comically ignorant about statistics instead of being deliberately obtuse because you’re hostile to this question for a reason I’m sure nobody would be able to put a finger on :)
---
Yes lets listen to the company that takes away prize money because you said something they didnt like &gt; Piss off by trying to make this about that greedy corporation. Its a video game designed for one person to play one character at a time, stop lieing to yourself  and wipe that corporate "stuff" off your cheek, its embarrassing.
---
So thankful for my schedule, it completely avoids scheduled maintenance. During BC one of my days off was the same day as maintanence.
---
6 SC plus special hit cap is ideal.
---
Do you plan on selling MC/Onyxia runs?
---
Wotlk
---
Pretty obvious
---
At least your character looks cool.
---
This is objectively false.
---
It's a lot lot lot harder than people expect and typically controlled by the top guild(s). Its not possible to do without coordination of the top ~25 pvpers on the server, you can't just grind it out solo.
---
Pushing out content before moderately-paced levelers are ready to do it. The bulk of the playerbase is already done with DM now.
---
Incentivized world pvp also began at a time when I couldn't really participate - and actually at a time when it incentivized 60's to hinder my progress.
---
Both were released too soon for me.
---
Galaxies is peak MMO performance.
---
I feel like Benediction is perfect. As an alliance player it doesn’t seem unbalanced. Always plenty of people on at most hours. An most importantly no queues. I was only ever in 1 queue for about 5 minutes like 2 months ago.
---
If you are in my group to do something with me id never charge for water, food or portals.
---
If you are not in my group i charge for all of the above. Unless you are leveling, then i give for free if you ask like a normal person.
---
Guildies and people i group with often get all of the above for free and as much as they want.
---
The ones that were created as transfer options only after release.  I wonder why?
---
Because the God of Thunder wants him to be a Strutter!
---
So nervous about starting my first ever protection warrior alt
---
We have streamers playing in EU too, like all method for example.   
---
I don't believe you have 1000 eu player ruining the queues, especially since there is time difference, prime time in US (east or west) is never prime time in EU.
---
But you don't need to lose the race, because you don't need as many to defend. Just a couple rogues/druids/hunters can really tie things up for the scouting parties
---
&gt;  What do they care if BWL just released?
---
Some of them care quite a bit, though I don't know why. Every content release is greeted by hordes of them wailing their displeasure with what they judge to be the too-fast pace. 
---
Not sure why they feel it matters to them. If you're level 40 now you were never going to see the inside of naxxramas no matter how long they waited.
---
This isn't even cheating xD
---
HoJ........ ffs I'm a rogue who can't get it.
---
so many future rank 14 players in one video, dayum  
---
sitting on a boat between two lowbie zone is all the rage
---
We will miss you, signed Twinkies (horde)
---
That's not really a price since free transfers are available and they're exploiting it if they changed their names. Their punishment should be keeping their Reputation intact, and keeping their names public.
---
Naxx was wotlk is an old troll post from Nostalrius. It was super prevalent. Granted you probably didn't know that, but right now you're being trolled.
---
Battlegrounds coming soon, twink community is waking up. Try your luck in sfk for shadowfang, assassin blade etc.
---
Leave those losers.
---
Think about that for a second. At 1,000 gold crafting fee, which is higher than I’ve ever seen, that’s still 200 crafts. No way he made that much lol.
---
Comming?
---
The overwhelming majority of the players in the world will likely however be unwilling to fight.
---
No it's not specific to Alliance, but it is specific to Alliance on Skeram.
---
If someone is beimg an are notify the group to kick him or your leaving. The tank will always get their way. Also dont us hs.
---
Not gonna speak for other classes but white dmg is more than yellow dmg for rogues. Thats why SnD is good. But yeah if you re hit capped you shouldn't be expected to invest ridiculous gold and time buying stuff like devilsaur or trying to get truestrike shoulders for example if you already have say shadowcraft/cadaverous.
---
As dagger rogue especially, for example, HoJ isnt nearly as good as it is for sword rogued so you can just use the DM 2% hit trinket and use SC shoulfer over truestrike or SC pants/gloves over devilsaur.
---
People obsess over pre-bis lists for raids that have been done in green gear instead on focusing on getting consumables like gfpp, arcane prot pot, resto pot for curse, fap for the slows at Garr etc, and ofc getting stuff like e'ko buffs or elixirs/flasks and enchants.
---
What server are you spending 2 hours in queue? Streamer server?
---
Lmao WP GG
---
Imo, unless you are bringing something valuable enough to the group, you don't warrant a reserved item. And I'm not talking about "it's the only thing I need". You better be a fucking geared player who is a serious contribution. Not pre-bis except for that one item
---
That being said, if you make the group with the rules up front, people are free to join and follow those rules.
---
It requires pretty minimal good faith to believe a researcher when they say they need more data than they have in order for their research to be useful.
---
Nah I can't afford that.
---
i mean i seems like confirmation bias. My orc resists some and maybe every now and again RNG gives me 2 resists but its not the most common thing just the thing you would remember most as a rogue.
---
I love that farm, doin it since a week. It's so much easier than the zf farm (which I'm too noobish to do) even skilled herbing up to get even more and loving it. Even with only 1 pack per pull I can do it in ~10 minutes! And I'm really bad with aoe.
---
For everyone struggling with zf or any other farm this is the way to go!
---
Happened to me once. I think it was conflicting with another addon. Idk what it was but i ended up fully resetting the addon.
---
That’s fine. Go play other games. Just don’t come on reddit looking for validation and sympathy posting that you quit. That’s just pathetic
---
I just don’t really like the Tauren forms
---
Last night around 1am server two people in Org did a re-telling of the breakfast scene from Reservoir Dogs. It was worth the wait and the time.
---
The elementals spawn with a 'boss', which has a high chance of dropping an ace of elementals. It's also worth ignoring the boss and killing the elementals, as they have greatly increased chances of dropping essences.
---
Aaaaaaand , guess I'll be resubbing
---
Are you sure it was currently? Im not i understood if it was currently.
---
That's ridiculous honestly, immediately add them on ignore and proceed with or without them is what I'd do. Or better yet make them wait on you to naturally regen mana every pull or leave to go get water somewhere else and blame it on the dick who charges for freaking water
---
Zehvras can parry. They have to parry with something, why not hooves.
---
It's funny because I actually logged into retail the other day to mess around expecting to not see many people around, the servers seemed just as busy as before. Found dungeons instantly and saw tons of people running about doing things, i'm always confused by posts like these and what they are trying to accomplish. Why do people have to get so bitter and bring things up from months ago with these low quality memes all the time.
---
Except when the server is 80/20 in favor of horde the alliance will literally never hold BRM - as it’s impossible due to sheer numbers. So, it is actually specific to alliance for the large amount of the super horde dominated servers. Don’t be dense.
---
I was wondering why the dark portal is such a massive and well-crafted terrain feature but the game does nothing with it. It makes more sense if Blizzard knew exactly what it was going to be for.
---
All but rag.
---
Well Honor Spy is completely different than Spy for one.
---
I mean asking "who's we" to his comment is just weird as fuck lmao. What the hell answer other than "my friend" or "a guildie" are you expecting to get here?? And again, is it in any way relevant?
---
Someone with lots to sell will try to get the boss down asap.
---
Be friendly to healers and invite them to quest with you.  They are probably the classes most receptive to group questing. 
---
Scope out some guilds.
---
&gt;classic players like the current iteration of spell batching
---
according to who/what exactly? I have yet to see anybody, on reddit or elsewhere, actual defend spell batching.
---
Pretty funny to see Blaumeux drama leak into this sub
---
Also "MUH AQ DROPS! WHY CANT WE OPEN THE DAMN GATES!"

Prot is a huge noob bait. Go arms warrior for leveling.

At 60 spam dungeons for prebis, follow Skarm's guides on youtube and such.
---
Do dungeons on your way to 60, decent practice, I wouldn't advice to do them more than once do unless if you spamming them efficiently
---
Except without out info about what defines underrepresented. If a game is 30% women, what good would it be to aim for 51% women polled? 51 is representative of the US but not WoW.
---
The people pointing this out were intending to prevent him from making flawed research.
---
Wait till you meet the guy that says that he will blacklist you for needing a str plate piece while he only needed so he can sell it. Then he will threaten to blacklist you and say that you dont wanna get blacklisted by the gm of "the biggest guild on this server"
---
Dope. What’s the xp/hr like?
---
Well orcs have total 30% resist chance (before talents/gear/etc) so you'd expect the double resist to happen roughly 10% of the time. Which sounds about right with my memory, so yeah it's not like it happens every time, but it's enough to be a meme people relate to.
---
Yeah I'd report that for sure, that's worth a ban - can't even say that on reddit without an admin ban.
---
Hi, /u/DunnoWhyIamHere

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dzeuo9/nsfw_how_it_feels_on_a_horde_dominated_server/). 
---
He doesn't even need to use Shadow Bolt. It's well enough if he dots up all of the 3-4 mobs that are pulled and his clothie ass is sure to get a beating :D
---
I see the rude awakening happening the other way. These "mechanic" are absolute joke in 2019 gaming standards, even normal retail dungeon have more mechanic than those boss fights
---
Hahaha what?? This is the most bizarre interaction I've ever had on reddit. I legit can't tell if you're a moron or are just fucking with me. Experience teaches me to lean towards the former.
---
Can't they lock people out from rolling the way over balanced faction on pvp servers?
---
70-80k per hour. Takes a few hours of practice and dying before you get the hang of it first. Once you get it down you can start selling carries and make some extra cash on the side
---
Sure I could, but as you should already know, documents such as those are typically written using either jargon or purposefully complicated language, so I figure simply asking wouldnt be painful. If it peeves you that much that I'm asking, simply ignore the post, problem solved.
---
&gt; To me it's part of the authentic experience.
---
But it's not authentic at all. Vanilla did not behave like this. Batching does introduce some of the same quirks that happened in vanilla, but at the cost of making a lot of gameplay noticeably worse in order to facilitate those quirky side-effects that we used to experience.
---
righto bucko
---
I only use H a l l o and Go To Re t a i l, in opposite situations though
---
It sucks and they won't change it
---
I understand that, but it really was an inevitability of the structure of the game and its release.
---
The only way I can see to have potentially mitigated that would have been releasing the honour system and BGs simultaneously... then people would've lost their shit about "killing WPVP" anyway.
---
You can't please everyone... so maybe focusing on pleasing those who have invested the least in the game/their characters is the wrong move?
---
If you're affli, there's no reason to have Dark Pact.
---
You have Improved Drain Soul and Improved Life Tap, both providing mana efficiency. In addition to Siphon Life and spell knockback resistance on Drain Life to recover from Taps without having to drink.
---
You can use your VW to pull multiple mobs, fully DoT them, and LT to full mana then Drain Life to fill HP. Kill the one of the mobs with Drain Soul.
---
Dark Pact is useless. And having a succubus just as a mana battery is wasteful when you can have VW as a threat magnet.
---
Also,
---
Add thunderclap to groups. It feels good (imo) and helps.
---
Demoralising shout is good for threat too
---
So, you should be:
---
- Battle stance
---
- Charge
---
- Whilst charging, go into defensive stance
---
- Demoralizing shout
---
- Thunderclap
---
- Sunder each mob
---
- I also use rend as well
---
- Get skull to 10-20% and then move on to the other adds
---
- If you have a full rage bar, use Heroic Strike, if its above 50 rage, you can use it, but don't if it's under 50 rage
---
- If you are fighting humanoids that run, Hamstring them. Also, you may want to hamstring the adds anyway just in case the dps pulls aggro and you want to get to the mob asap
---
PvE server and I'm in the top few players. Dagger/Offhand is the sole reason I'll push for 14.
---
Correction - in *most* instances it's better to swim.
---
But, if you're on the island and the boat is pulling up or waiting, it's faster to take the boat to the mainland. Though it's never better to take boat from mainland to island.
---
As a horde, if they let me choose my destination I'd have left Herod for Myzrael or weeks ago as I have people there. I'm not about to transfer to heartseeker when I know no one on that server.   
---
      
---
Myself and my friends all stuck it out through 3 hour queues for a month after launch to play with each other on Herod. I have zero interest in leaving, unless its on my terms.
---
Is gear for your 19 priest mostly boe?
---
Ya I’m 52 on rattlegore and it isn’t too bad but I fear that it’s gonna get worse as time goes on. Right now it’s a 60/40 horde alliance but as time goes on more are gonna leave i feel like
---
A single person anecdotally not having paid for a tank or healer doesn't have any bearing on whether tanks and healers occasionally charge for services.
---
This is the only answer to listen to. Ready? Battle shout try to keep up but never waste rage on it during the middle of a pull. Never use demo shout its worthless. Idc what you think its worthless. Your combo is charge, berserker stance, berserker rage, whirlwind, defensive stance, spam cleave. If you are Arms tanking with a 2H it's even easier. You do the same thing but sweeping strikes before using whirlwind. You want to hit everything and hit it hard because that's the only way you're holding aggro. Bind your bow to skull target and target the mob you're primarily hitting. If anyone hits another mob for more damage than your AOE has done then they're stupid for not focusing the one you marked with Skull. Tab target that mob and taunt it before it runs away(will need to be quick) and if they pull any more off you then it's their fault. With whirlwind + cleave you hold aggro and if you dont then it's their fault. 
---
If it's just two mobs dont whirlwind. Just target one, spam sunder+cleave after doing your charge+berserker rage opening combo. Make sure the one you sunder is marked with skull. When it's less than half HP switch to the second and start sundering it.
---
Looks like I'll have to wait until we can check the vendor to see if its in.
---
the servers splodin bro but its less about the drama here, more about mass report imo
---
Hell yes, I bought like 40 pieces of twink gear a month ago cuz I’m traveling right now and will be home 17 dec, feelsgoodman
---
I mean, it's either pay 1G for 120 55 water or many gold for 120 45 water.
---
Oh man.  I remember the days where a single AV match took two or three days.  That was the shit.
---
Yeah, with people who know all the fights already. The hard part is taking 40 schmucks who have never set foot in the raid and getting them all to the point they can do the mechanics consistently.
---
You can't judge how hard it is by looking at people who have already been through the learning process.
---
It surprises me that human is the most rolled alliance class. Like, you’re a human 24/7, why go into a fantasy world and choose human? My buddy made funny of me for rolling a dwarf warrior because of the human racials, but I’m a stout of bearded badassness, while he’s a stupid human.
---
You : exploit = intuitive. 
---
Everyone else: no.  
---
You: &lt;large words you don’t actually know how to use properly.&gt;
---
Weird cuz there's been a fuckton of changes, so the whole no changes thing isn't applicable at all
---
Shaman are the Hunters of Classic
---
Basically if you go without gfpp you need everyone to have full fire resist sets. Easiest to just have people pop gfpp and put on gear with actually good stats (tanks will need both though) and things will go way faster
---
First, if a dps is above your level, he needs to be extra careful to not pull aggro.
---
Second, if the dps is bitching about it (and obviously has no clue that in Classic it's not about tank damage but threat-generating abilities, like the Sunder Armor which does no damage), you need to make it clear that he either wises up, leaves or you leave. The last option normally only happens if the there's more than 1 of these toxic people. Generally the group will stay with you cause everybody can do damage, so replacing a DPSer is oh so easier than looking for a new tank.
---
You'll also come off as more mature than just rage-quitting the party and going off your own business.
---
You aren't wrong with I guess I die part. Though from the other end when you don't resist any I feel like i just die haha
---
Killing the opponent in war is fine. Killing innocent civilians isn't. This is the distinction between honorable and dishonorable kills.
---
It doesn't mean we square up and fence. Those are called "duels" and dont involve kills.
---
Someone posted it on here as a joke but it's actually easier to read for me lol
---
Oh look another one
---
How is it not exploiting? It's getting an advantage from doing something that's not allowed. And how can people be surprised about this? This was their policy on this issue all throughout the entirety of vanilla, and somehow people are surprised it's STILL their policy?
---
BGs are cross server so idk why you think this will be an issue. There are plenty of servers with health alliance population.
---
PvP in hillbrad the other day, our hunter Multi-Shots a for a kill (~6 honor each) and a double dishonourable kill.
---
You want a Mage (or possibly Warlock) my friend. Mages are AoE gods like no other. 
---
Druids are good tanks and good healers at endgame, but I wouldn’t recommend them to somebody who’s a DPSer at heart. Feral cat is decent but requires a ton of knowledge, skill and farming.
---
Hahahahahhaa I planned to have a 19,29 and 39 twink, thinking I had a minimum of 2 months to get them ready. Now I find out that the shit show that is blizzard are only giving me about 3 weeks, nice one morons, not possible for me anymore. Why does this company suck so much and make things so much harder than it has to be.
---
The census data is on the site. I looked at all PVP realms and heres what I found (as of yesterday).
---
6 are ally dominated
---
14 are Horde dominated.
---
Most servers are relatively even or hit 40/60, still a far cry from the 4:1 ratio that is claimed (note this would be 20/80).
---
1 is massively Horde dominated, but with 3000 total players. The second most Horde dominated is about 3:1. Alliance has 2 heavily dominated servers. 
---
The front page says 52A/48H right now. Yesterday it was 51A.
---
We are literally showing you right now, on this post. So shut up :)
---
Dw im just joking 💁🏼‍♂️👊🏼
---
Or idk stfu and abide by the loot rules, take your chances and wait your fucking turn?
---
Why would anyone else know if you don't?
---
Shamans become paladins?
---
Saw someone doing this in my realm, laughed my ass off. Had to give em a /salute for creativity
---
They would need to open up for faction change, paid or free, combined with faction queues for the dominant faction. 
---
I know I know, it's not like it was in vanilla but classic is not a 1:1 vanilla anyway and now when they have all these tools they could put them to good use to actually try to counter the imbalance. Since these things are meta anyway it wouldn't affect your experience in-game either more than less/more of the opposing faction to meet so I'd welcome that kind of change tbh.
---
Please be patient I...
---
You chose to stay despite several hour long queues and known faction imbalance.
---
Why would PvP and PvE realms be queued together? They weren't in Vanilla.
---
The only way that changes is if the Horde start doing the "whining" when they realize they have massive numbers on all PvP servers and ask for it.
---
Even then, it may not matter.  Most PvE realms are lower populations and there are fewer PvE than PvP realms.
---
Sure it can be looked that way. Appreciate the feedback
---
Their game, their rules. They define cheating. They have outright said it isn't cheating, those are the facts whether you like it or not 
---
What's sad is how angry you are getting over how somebody else plays a videogame which has zero effect on you.
---
Should be about 300-500 generally
---
fel·la·ti·o
---
noun
---
oral stimulation of a man's penis.
---
I'm not sure how hes sucking any Alliance dicks here.
---
Wow Really cool
---
You can and I know people who have.
---
Elemental Shamans are gods in PvP.
---
&gt;Limiting the play of some players 
---
...is better than completely losing a huge chunk of subscriber base.
---
they offer realm transfers...
---
As a rogue you have 305 weapon skill in pve. Therefore hit cap is 6%. Don't pretend like you know everything when you clearly do not.
---
Yeah, you can be a cow man, or a orc, or a crazy looking troll with bigass tusks, but they choose a undead human. Zombies are cool though.
---
On a server like mine we barely ever hit ques, and even just seeing a 1 min que made people get mad
---
Does it hurt your little feelings?
---
40/60 balance isn't unplayable.
---
They would have two options with shamans:
---
A) Shamans get changed into paladins.
---
B) Shamans get to choose whichever class they want to change into.
---
(Obviously same goes for paladins in the opposite direction.)
---
And then ad MCing priests on top of that. They just MC you back to square 1.
---
Don't listen to this advice. You should be saving every copper you find for your mount at 40. Take up herbalism and alchemy as well. Those will help tremendously as a warrior who is leveling alone. Spending money on gear is a waste as having a mount at 40 will net more profit as you can move more quickly
---
I could easily afford that.
---
What I can’t afford is the time dinking around managing forty different accounts/toons. Plus there’s something just sad about seeing multiboxers play, the way the other characters just kind of lifelessly follow others around. Idk
---
Ok boomer
---
It’s viable but it’s way different. It’s focus isn’t on bubbles or DPS based healing.
---
It’s all about buffs. Disc has great utility but loses some healing power but has Divine Spirit and Power Infusion, powerful buffs.
---
How is 50g and mats free?
---
Start prot at like lvl 57+, level as arms imo
---
Nice!
---
What’s the adding called that shows spells going of cd in the middle of the screen?
---
Well fairbanks had azuregoes spawn right before shutdown, and then disapear on us after the server reset this morning so yeah, that's my answer
---
Most servers ARENT unbalanced. We have census data (yes its incomplete, Blizzard won't release official numbers so it's what we got).
---
&gt; faction queues
---
What discounts do you get for not being able to play the game? Does my character get free stuff because I lost play time that the other faction didnt?
---
iFyOuDoNtLiKpVpWhYuPlAyOnApVpSeRvEr??? /s
---
Only naxx is impossible.
---
I think there will be certain bosses that will be impossible to beat by yourself though. A bunch of aq bosses come to mind such as cthun and twin emp and even some in bwl where the raid has to split up. If you do eventually complete some raids I would like to watch a video of it!
---
Any recommendations for specialities of weaponsmith? Swords, aces, or maxes?
---
The people reporting had a member who was charging 50g + mats for Lionheart.
---
Bam "charges" only mats. No fee. No "tip required".
---
Using a quest guide would be fastest but yes, if a 60were to boost you xp/h would be high
---
Lmao dude
---
Its hard for those still trying to progress while theres a chunky pool of no lifers who have already done 90% of their progression have absurd money and time now to throw at endless pvp/ganking.
---
Spam exorcism?
---
Are you starting them with #showtooltip?
---
I think it’s called MC cooldown pulse? Something like that
---
As someone who has only played a priest and a rogue I am jealous! 
---
Side note: what addons do you use? I set up neat plates and bartender 4, but I can’t find a way to move my own hp bar down to the middle like that. Your setup is very clean, dig the square map too.
---
I am a tank, Ive seen people pay other tanks though.
---
imagine having your head so far up your ass that you think the current state of the game is fine
---
I liked it until I read the guild name 😓. Stop supporting that neckbeard
---
If you think people wouldn't transfer/faction change with 2 hours queues every evening you are sorely wrong. 
---
I did, my friends did, and many others I've bumped into on the new server did. The old server wasn't even that imbalanced but the queues were horrendous and if you didn't log in during work by using remote desktop or similar you would basically either not play that evening or play for an hour or two in the late evening just before bedtime.
---
While I understand their frustration, not being able to let the game lay down for two weeks until the hype blows over while you do something else without publicly declaring that you quit doesn't seem like a very healthy attitude.
---
It does not work if the character is over 30. Tried.
---
I use Elvui and weakauras for my primary interface. I sprinkle in a few others for quality of life stuff, but those are the main two
---
You have to play 12 hours a day for a couple months straight. Can you do that?
---
I use them to communicate to alliance (undead did speak common in beta so it just makes sense)
---
Thats what the other guild is charging
---
I play tank with quite god raidning gear and i farm gold that way. Groups on my server have hard time to finding tanks :)
---
where is a better place for blaumeux drama? I love drama
---
To be fair ostracism and price fixing through shady means are exactly the proper roleplay things for a medieval guild to do.
---
That was basically their whole reason to exist.
---
Honestly just use the ignore feature in game.  That's what it is there for.  Problem solved and you can stay in the guild.
---
If he complains about being ignored, have someone explain to him he needs to grow up.
---
Back in vanilla i used to have a bunch of guildies ignored and muted on vent.
---
I r8 it 8/8
---
Happened to me while ghetto resetting a dungeon.
---
Theres a help section on blizzards website that will move your character outside of org if it's stuck / can't login.
---
What if they could give that cursed keyring first :)
---
find a guild or at least some friends
---
&gt;Swiftness won't go up that much the mats are just too easy to get.
---
and FAPs aren't? You can fish up the mats for like 50 FAPs per hour
---
You get 1 rep point pr kill now, which you didn't get before.
---
Does a comment like this make you cool?
---
Why did he put up a video of the Deathwing fight?
---
My heartrate increased just watching this.
---
Hunter has a high ceiling compared to most classes, but I promise that if you take like, one single evening and just get a few important macros, keybind your stuff, and practice controlling your pet - you're 90% of the way. There's plenty of optimizations in your play that can happen after, and you can learn that over time.
---
Pet stay/follow/attack/dismiss, remember to disable growl in groups, and be *very* careful with multishot - and you're already probably 75th percentile of hunters. Hunter will be as intense but smooth, or as clunky but mindless as you want to be.
---
If the goal is 60/40 then basically there won't be queues.
---
So by your logic if blizzard said buying gold wasn’t cheating you’d agree? 
---
He has a point... multi boxing was not the way the game was intended to be played.
---
Tanaris as a lvl 45 warrior is a shit show. Corpses all through gadgetzan. Horde seem happy to let a guard kill em as long you die first. Add on to that a couple of locks at Max range from the perimeter guards dotting anyone thinking about leaving to death. Formed a 10 man raid just trying to rest one questing area from the hordes grasp. Lasted all on 10 minutes till they flocked and killed us all. ??'s front and center ganking. Fucking cunts ruining a potentially great game.
---
For context. Both groups had 5 people and there was 15 minute delay in stream. Someone happened to know that streamer and his in game name so we checked afterwards what his reaction was as he waved a goodbye to our mage when he was in iceblock
---
Kick them. Or charge for every heal.
---
Skeram is 3:1 at 60. At least per census.
---
Yeah, and honestly loot can be damm frustrating. The worst is when people change the loot rules midraid, and yes,adults can be realy shitty over loot,especially when they doesnt care about it,watching you bis go to a person who doesnt realy benefit from those stats makes your effort just worthless. My current guild deals with this pretty fairly,they have a list before raid on wich loot goes to witch person. Some people forget that this isnt just a vidoe game,its a big time sink,and when you put so much time and effort into something,you are past the point of not taking it seriusly.
---
it's not just the game that changed to make retail what it is, the players changed too. the issue with people stuck on these pvp nightmare servers is 1: Blizz made the servers way too fucking big, 2: they don't release census data so if you started early before community driven ones got enough data to work with, you had no idea if the server you wanted to roll on was super imbalanced. 3: players have the luxury of hindsight and knowing exactly how to level most efficiently, what builds are strongest, what works and what doesnt, and because of that the hardcore players just blasted through ahead of everyone. this effectively means that if you start a little late/have a job/dont feel like devoting every waking hour of your life to the game and couldn't level before p2 hit you just don't get to play the game anymore. sure, maybe we're the fucking idiots for rolling on a PvP server, but nobody thought it would be that bad initially, PvP servers in vanilla were apparently never this toxic, and if you already didn't have enough time to level, how the fuck are we supposed to just throw all our progress away and start over
---
Servers are also way bigger than Vanilla and people no-life way harder than 14 years ago. Could easily be more difficult on a Classic PVE server than the most populated Vanilla PVP server

Not a dick move. Your in the clear

Eye of the storm for pushback immune after taking a crit, and between warstomp, tidal charm, grenades and kiting you have plenty of window to cast.
---
A Resto Druid actually possesses the highest healing parse in all of classic on rag so, that’s not entirely true.
---
Stigma comes from long cast times (so they get sniped easily) and no rez. In terms of HPS and mana efficiency, Druids are very powerful.

52/48 Ally favored on the front page.

---
There's 20+ and Alliance heavily dominate TWO to Hordes ONE. Most servers are 40/60 or better (at level 60).
---
Indeed. And I was really wondering why there is need to recreate "server lag was bad and people had bad internet connections". No one misses Vanilla because of lag. Just let it run smoothly as modern games. There is no need to make it feel more laggy.
---
Or hey if we are onto it then why not just make random disconnects as well? Make everyone disconnect couple times in hour!
---
Yes
---
That's in LFG though - if you have been LF tank for 30+ mins you might bite, but you know about it. It's not like you ever in 1000000 years would invite a mage who is "LF Scholo, water is 50s/stack". Would never happen. Never ever.
---
Because all his friends quit WoW years ago. It's right there in the title, man!
---
You just described Boolean complex perfectly - fitting.
---
OK boomer
---
This is very accurate^
---
AQ40 is not gonna get multiboxxed  
---
BWL is also probably not possible, or extremely unlikely at best  
---
MC would be a challenge (lets just start simple, how are you going to get the bomb out of a raid and avoid inferno at the same time on barron geddon)
---
Yetis in Alterac is the WORST.
---
Sure does not. You might think so if you're 12.
---
If AOE dps is your thing then mage is the best bet, or warlock in second. Mage is very meta/flavor of the month but is a powerful and fairly easy class that is typically the #1 dps choice in most content.
---
If you're feeling the ping, go reroll. If you're changing class might as well go for the better ping too anyway.
---
Yes, it's bad right now. Both Horde and Alliance is hoping for BGs. Alliance so they can get into BRM again and Horde so they can do PvP without spending majority of the time looking for or waiting for Alliance to ress.
---
But the Horde is in for an ugly surprise. All of the (EU) servers have more Horde players - except a few PvE realms, where PvP is not going to be a big topic. Meaning that even with crossrealm BGs, the queues for Horde to enter a BG are going to be painful.
---
I now regret a bit not going Alliance in the beginning. For some reason I believed there will be less Horde in general and I was terribly wrong it seems. Now all my friends are already rooted in and would rather quit than throw away months of work and reroll.
---
So the only solution right now for Blizzard, if they want to keep their subs, is to step away from #nochanges and come up with free Faction transfers to make it even remotely possible to balance the populations. Realm transfers are not going to fix anything (but login queues) when there's so much less Alliance players in general on most of the realms. They have the technology, so it should be doable.
---
Why would you have to go alliance to be a druid?
---
#asmon
---
why wouldn't they? it's a 50/50 split it'd be stupid not to.
---
Sadly welcome to tanking, 90% of the job is dealing with this kind of nonsense from dps :)
---
On your rotation you have it just about right by the sounds of it. From a fellow tank here's my recommendations:
---
- Give revenge higher priority than sunder, way more cost effective source of threat
---
- Heroic strike and cleave less, they're expensive and don't net you much threat. Chuck more sunders out instead
---
- On group pulls you often won't be able to keep all of them on you. Focus on keeping the 'right' ones (usually melee elites) on you and don't chase stagglers unless you absolutely have to.
---
Good luck and keep at it! Tanking honestly gets way more fun at 60
---
If you get offended by reading " K Y S H O M O " i might think you are the 12 year old
---
"Dont PVP me plz"
---
Lolololol
---
Most servers are relatively balanced (40/60 or better at level 60) so empower yourself by using the "invite to group" option.
---
wasn't like this until they opened transfers without faction locking
---
NAXX OUT
---
Yeh in regards to heroic strike, I agree. While it is good threat, when tanking a dungeon you dont normally get enough rage that you should be using it. When you're on a raid boss its a different story, you have an excess of rage most of the time, and thats when dumping some rage with heroic strike becomes the requirement (while not rage starving yourself for a shield slam/revenge/sunder as necessary).
---
That doesn't make it cheating tbf.
---
Too bad Blizzard made "invite to group" a horde only racial.
---
What server you on, ill make you iron feather gear if your healing?
---
I am not, but you're just acting like a kid here.
---
Dude, I’m not the only one that realizes that dudes face looks like a skeleton, thank god.
---
I see all these kids talk about him and all I can do is fantasize about beating his face into a better shape with a crowbar.
---
no one is enjoying but its the whole way to get honor
---
fucking 3 more weeks of this
---
Doesn't affecT me, I'm raid logging till BGs and cancelled alt account already.
---
As for those who say "it's fine", sure it is, it's within the rules. But imagine a winner takes all team sport where one side has triple the players. How long long do you reckon the outnumbered side are gonna turn up to play whipping boy?
---
If you makes groups and push the opposite faction back, yes.
---
What did you think "pvp server" meant?
---

I'd say do what's more fun, but also keep on mind 19 twinks are a very deliberate and expensive process. You may spend hundreds of gold, and getting AGM (arena grandmaster trinket) is very difficult and time consuming. So if that's your goal then having a main to farm is important. You'll need people to run you through dungeons anyway, because you can't turn your XP off in classic.
---
Also, try endgame! It's fun
---
Uh, no.  As a COMBAT rogue you have precision as well so that means you only need 1% hit from gear.   I never said I know everything about the game, just correcting misinformation you keep spreading.
---
It's so easy it requires half the spouses and twice the income of the average citizen of the richest country in the world, anybody could do it
---
C'thun is at least a moderately difficult fight.

What about the goblin in Winterspring who ONLY needs 10 of the THICKEST yeti hides, for her tiny mechanical yeti's to show off to her friends, regardless of the fact that every single one of the 150+ yeti I killed for that quest had skin, and each one clearly had enough for a tiny mechanical yeti, and the mechanical yeti would have looked dumb with really long/thick hair. 
---
After murdering every single yeti in Wintersping 4 times and taking their skin a few times, I finally went back to their goblin, she thanked me for the hides, before saying 'oh could you go get me 2 pristine yeti horns' I went online and saw the drop rate from the mob I had already killed 50 of, knew that I have got these if she had just asked me for them earlier.
---
I curse my paladin nature, as there is no way I could kill this questgiver before the guards got to me.
---
Relax, plenty of people would rather take the gold and hope they get the loot soon enough. There's no harm in asking. Whining and crying about it is bad form, but you can ask politely.
---
Uploading PvP videos nowadays to YouTube is more often than not a copyright strike if you have any music in the video.
---
There is never real risk. It's a game. If you get killed, you just resurrect and go on with what you were doing.
---
But if you want to call it a risk, being solo as horde in Ironforge seems like a bigger risk than roaming around in a party or raid killing players that are leveling up, or trying to get in an instance. Would call that a much "lower move" than the rogue in Ironforge.
---
I get it at level 60 cos some stuff lasts for ages, but when people cry over loot in SFK or RFD or whatever - c’mon!
---
&gt;Battle shout try to keep up but never waste rage on it during the middle of a pull.
---
Wrong, BS spam is a surprisingly decent for AoE tanking.
---
ok boomer
---
bring back everyone that fled to heartseeker and you would have a balanced server.
---
level a few 35s for alchemy and collect 10-40g/day logging in for a few seconds.
---
i only see a tank asshole here.
---
And from yours too since it's objectively true unless you are on one particular server.
---
What am I supposed to see in this video?
---
You cant disable xp gain like in retail. In no time, your toon will be 20 and you have to start over
---
Not true, grey never gave xp unless you mean a beta or alpha phase of the game but on launch day they were zero.
---
Are you downranking? Also don't use the HOTs except in an emergency. They are very Mana inefficient. Downranked healing touch should be a pretty sustainable heal as long as you're wearing some int/spirit gear.
---
Ought to be stored as copper, right? So a max of 2^31 copper, being converted to g/s/c when presented. That's how I'd do it, but no idea how it's actually done.
---
I play on Yojamba and I've been helping a mate run BRD to level up the last few nights, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get into BRD to actually start our run.
---
Yes! I can level again
---
Yea I can see where you’re coming from. I made these to give to friends of mine and wanted to see what else was out there to get ideas. I wonder if that changes your view at all
---
Your job is to keep mobs off the healer. 
---
You can't out threat dps unless you got a thunderfury. Shadowbolt crits and instant Cone of Colds are just better than you in dungeons.
---
Go cry in a corner because you didn't get to hear what you wanted to hear.

Really quite sad how you went for a strawman and straight up ignored my arguments to just go for "yOuR oPiNiOnS r StOoPiD"

I was doing this run as lvl 53 alliance mage on Firemaw yesterday. The rouges was waiting on Max ressurection distance from my corpse... took about 40 minutes of corpserunning to get from thorium point to brd. I thought games were supposed to be fun...
---
&gt; Like, you could have just run it twice.
---
I got to revered with Argent Dawn just from running Strat UD. Saw cape drop once.
---
It tells you on your honor tab when you press H.
---
MC+Ony takes 2-3 hours and the mechanics are near non existent. They can be explained on discord in a minute. Consumables can be bought before the raid for a couple gold. It's more difficult to raid with a full time jobs, but most guilds with a couple hundred members will have 3 or more active raid groups at different time slots.
---
I mean the 30% wouldn't be stuck in queue. Some would reroll and for every one that does that's slightly more than 2 people removed from queue . Would it 100% solve the problem? No, but it would go a long way to alleviating it.
---
 The asshats stuck in q every night would eventually have to choose between rerolling, dealing with it like stubborn jackasses,or quitting. I'm ok with all 3of those options.
---
Trolling is making someone else look like an idiot. 
---
This person asked a question that is perfectly reasonable and received a perfectly reasonable answer. No one got trolled. 
---
Getting attention is not trolling.
---
Someone had a post up elsewhere giving people a rough idea of where they could make it too if they went full on this week and kept it up but I can't find it any more. Rank 11 though is one where it really starts to kick up a notch, many struggled with 9/10. 11 is hassle without a premade in my opinion and you'll be looking at probably 4-5 weeks of good BG premading to get it, maybe slightly more depending on your playtime.
---
If it's just the two of you, you'll both be geared in like 3 weeks.
---
This is the most *first world problem* ever.
---
Try raiding in a group with 12 other people who all want your loot. That's when the real pettiness starts.
---
Similar styled comic came out during vanilla regarding murlok heads for an alliance quest with laughably low drop rates.
---
Blizzard actually *fixed* the drop rate to make sense.  It went from like a 10% chance to 100%.  The wording was such that the quest giver wanted them for proof you had killed the mobs, but didn't want them when the were seen "dripping onto the floor" 
---
At this point I view the quests like this as 'directed grinding' and just go with it.
---
Do this for yeti fur pls
---
They have so much fur
---
Reroll orc warrior, the master race.
---
If it's an upgrade it's an upgrade, he shouldn't have expected you to know his classes BIS
---
upvoted for visibility. fuck Cold Fusion. will be starting guild blacklist
---
I think those numbers were based around server population though at the time right? I feel like I remember when I hit R14 towards the start of the honor system that my guild would run the decay numbers based on roughly how many people it said were collecting honor each week on our server.
---
So if WoW Classic servers are bigger, then it's possible that maybe the top 5 bracket positions wouldn't decay out of R13.
---
Not that it's any real help since you're competing against 5x more players and would feel the same.
---
Oh yeah I'm sure they took over the entire server just to spite me lmak
---
Fuck horde, stay alliance brother. We all hurt together but we have to persevere
---
there are people like that
---
you take armor decay from pvp deaths. how do you think people enter BRD and MC with armor loss?
---
I'm sorry that you became victim for classic's honor system. The system rewards players for killing others while also it's a competition where whole faction is ranked in order depending how many points they got from all those kills that week. That causes mindless killing as everyone is after higher ranks and there aren't any other good way to gain honor than just world pvp
---
Those cranks/forges on the left and right side of the middle path towards brd arnt there for me.
---
I liked rerolling another faction simply for the questline, not a fan of doing exactly all same 800 quests.
---
&gt;Is it unreasonable to expect a ~~new guild member~~ **any guild member** to buy 85g flasks to attend MC?
---
That's really bad for a healer. There's a big healer neck off ramstein
---
You'd be surprised... Really though, if he doesn't get gkicked because people are sick of him, I would expect him to leave just on his own. Either after getting more loot and deciding the guild served it's purpose, or because he lost one too many rolls.
---
I'm not the victem. I don't care for wow at all, if it's unplayable than I'll move on lol. I feel bad for all the others banging their heads against their desks calling it "gaming" lmao
---
Can’t blame the horde means you shouldn’t blame the players as this is a symptom of the disease - we aren’t at fault. What do you think happens on heartseeker where alliance have the huge majority? They roll horde same as this all day.
---
I understand you are upset because it sucks to be alliance and you’ve been struggling for the entire time classic has been out. This isn’t fun for us either running around like junkies trying to get an honor hit.
---
the qq wua wua crowd strikes again
---
&gt;Imagine a money hungry corporation intentionally killing their sub base so 5 devs can feel smug
---
So, pretty much the story behind City of Heroes shutdown?
---
LOL
---
Im rogue and I go for 1o1s or for the 2-3 man groups with another rogue.
---
I’m getting ganked by 3 man ally’s roaming around like retards frequently, too. I don’t need to  do that, I pvp for fun and not to get honor.
---
That’s the whole problem..
---
I rather get the suck out of the open world tho...key part of all this. I can live with premade instances (BGs) sucking. I can’t live with the open world sucking.
---
It's up to you and your playstyle preference.  There are ways to deal with the resists without getting +hit% but if you're struggling with that it may be worth it.
---
Alright thanks! For future reference, where can I view drop rate percentages?
---
LOL sounds like this guy was joking, the amount of salt in this post is pretty funny though
---
Grob mob
---
If they had Spy addon, this would not have been possible.
---
Imagine thinking this is cool. What a fucking melt.
---
Bad for healer yes. But when you respect shadow? Not so bad.
---
Play it like a Paladin for a while.
---
You can also get the death sentence for Jaywalking, and I know people who have
---
This is NOT the way to do it once you hit level 50. You have it about right. Mark a skull and let them focus it. Can normally leave that alone and build threat on others as it will die quickly if, big if, they focus it. As somebody said in a melee heavy group battle shout is a great threat generator. You will not have the rage for heroic strike or sunder spam. Also as others have said revenge is a great threat generator, best TPS/rage by far. I use shield block on cd to generate revenge procs. Go at a speed you and the healer are comfortable with and if dps want to pull for you let them tank what they pull, just keep the healer safe. They will learn or if we are lucky fuck off back to retail. That being said good dps are out there. When you meet one add him to friends and wisp them when you need to fill a group, same with healers. YOU are a rare commodity, dps are not. Never forget that.
---
Asmo-npc
---
Ok, but what is the video for here, I dont understand lol
---
Well, he is in every possible way. Both in game and lore-wise :P
---
I hope they do now! 
---
Shaming people for playing without doing outside research is stupid af.. but if that's what gets you off go for it
---
Its just loot man, it'll drop again. If he's bent out of shape over a blue from a 5 man then its not a guild worth being in.
---
Them assemble 100 more people. The Alliance outnumber the Horde
---
What build would you suggest to utilize my good feral gear ? Do you think also I would miss on any good gear, is T1 any good ?
---
Your actions ( key strokes, mouse clicks etc) are being sent the the server at 50ms but if the server is lagging and not you the response time for server actions will be delayed (death animation, looting etc)
---
Was trying to buy a Rod of the Ogre Magi from a Hunter doing solo tribute runs yesterday. Found one right as I entered Feralas. Told him that I will be there "soon".
---
Soon was 45 minutes in the end. 45 mins of walking 5 meters, dying, rezzing and repeating until I was finally able to enter the dungeon.
---
Gave him 5 gold extra for waiting for me. Nice guy.
---
You guys seem to assume every server is Horde dominant or something. This isn't the case.
---
If you dont want to have random, unexpected PVP, dont roll on a PVP server. It's like buying a van and then asking why it's not a track car.
---
Appreciate all the responses. Only downfall for me now is trying to actually do the quest whilst somehow avoiding relentless waves of horde that seem to have goon squad everywhere. Wish me luck
---
Assuming cross realm BGs will be out on release.
---
I’m betting they won’t be
---
Same happened with my gm on Mograine. People just  jealous :( Open a ticket and he will be unmuted.
---
You dun goofed.
---
Doesn’t matter lol you ain’t getting rank 14
---
Pretty much every server had a shitty high warlord at some point that was probably account shared. Keyboard turning and clicking rank 14s was definitely possible.
---
If only Blizzard GMs weren't scared of punishing players who abuse their report system.
---
Nothing will change, dude. 
---
Blizzard is too damn stubborn whenever they don’t want to accept reality and admit they screwed up. Take a look at retail: it took them two expansions to realize that maybe they went too far with RNG. Also, to this day, they have yet to acknowledge or merge the ever crescent realm graveyard.
---
What will happen is that they’ll keep ignoring the issue because people will keep playing regardless. Once paid transfers are a thing, these same people will transfer off. It’s always been like this and it’s not going to change now.
---
If I were in your place, I’d either reroll if I had the time or straight up quit. I’ve been in the Blizzard loop for too long to know that complaining and writing “feedback” leads to nowhere, it’s like talking to a wall. Wierd thing is when the sub numbers drop, change magically comes.
---
So not even close to the 4:1 people imy is normal.
---
I basically started standing at the edge of my corpse res circle, picking a target in the direction I need to go, ressing, charging at it, intimidating shouting, try to intercept another target on the way.
---
I'm usually dead after the int shout. Then it's repeat until the dungeon portal.
---
Another aplologist for the shit cunt brigade.
---
It’s ok, Heigan will still be a mess to coordinate the dance.
---
Just range pull most of the times, and you already are above average tank
---
Most people are against reserving gear, but at some point its just plain understandable.
---
After running the same dungeon for the x. amount of time, forming the groups themself, explaining it again and again and again for people that have never been there , just to lose roll after roll against them you just get tired of it.
---
Reserve whatever you want, people that dont like it, dont have to go with you.
---
There are more dps wanting to go UBRS that you can imagine.
---
Reserve that thing and get the loot. Also fuck that rogue, he probably thought you take his word for granted that the MH is reserved and hoped you would stick to Need for Greed.
---
He was just pissed his plan on rolling either way blew up because you were smart enough to put masterloot before hand.
---
Special upvote for the "infinite" number of horde.
---
Look at the people saying PvE to PvP transfers are bad because it's easier to get things on a PvE realm. Blizzard must have agreed because those only worked the other way. 
---
Why wouldn't that same logic apply to BGs?
---
That definitely terrible, no doubt about it.
---
But a rogue with 43k honor did his fair share of killing and camping as well.
---
I was also Blackrock Horde in vanilla. Good on ya.
---
Battle shout or demo shout generate the most shit threat there is. Tab targeting cleaves after the opening I said is how to do it. You have 0 clue what you're talking about.  No good tsnk uses Demo Shout unless a second group is pulled by accident.
---
They called us pussies and now they QQ because they experience what WoW's shitty World-PvP is actually like when experienced rather than remembered through rose-tinted glasses.
---
Damn you're fast, came on to say that xD
---
hahaha yea nochanges
---
...except the 1000 changes theyve already done.. lmao :D
---
Pretty sure BGs are being launched cross-realm so queues shouldn't be impossible for horde.
---
Authentic vanilla experience!
---
So,if you have 5 sunder on a mob you dont need to put more on it, use heroic strie instead and refresh the sunder so the stacks doesnt go away. You need to be smart about knowing when to charge in and when to pull. My rotation is usually charge in,thunderclap,berserker stance then the ability wich generates you rage when you are hit,wirlwind and then berserker stance, and you can leave out some stuff based on the situation. Holding agroo on multiple mobs while your dps doesnt focus is imposible,so mark one with skulk and x if its a problem. Also usually there isnt many tanks to chose from,some people waste hours finding one so if someone is a dick you can just leave. Also,i tanked every dungeon in the game as arms(before classic i didnt realy played wow so i was as casual as you can get)
---
Jeez, we're running two groups a week and every Hunter in each has their Leaf. 
---
Pretty sure we've only seen 3-4 Eyes.
---
Since Honor System has come out I spend quite a lot of time thinking about my life and where I want to be in 5 years due to the amount of 60s out on the hunt. I'm doing the normal Combat Sword build on my Rogue, but I'm curious if I should swap to the current PvP build and quest with that just for a possible better experience in PvP.  
---
Any suggestions? Do I just stick it out as Combat and try to grey screen quest my way to 60?
---
Correct money is stored in copper.
---
So if you have 1 gold that’d translate to 10000 copper so that’s the value stored.
---
So what if I want to log in, check the AH and log out? I should get punished based on PVP when I'm not PVPing?
---
That shit looks rough as hell.
---
lol and you just believe anything someone tells you on reddit?  Theres literally no proof supporting he was ever squelched.  This just looks like witchhunting bullshit to me
---
So can I land off a do without 12 horde ganking me immediately then? Fucking losers.
---
Gz
---
&gt; do nothing
---
I agree, doing nothing is a problem 
---
So instead, you guys should use "invite to group" and come kick our asses.
---
I wouldn't say warriors are hard to play. They have some combos you need to learn, but at some point it comes naturally. It's not mortal kombat combos, most of the time just 3-5 buttons but you don't want to fail the stance dance.
---
About the stance dance, it can be intimidating for the beginner to switch through 3 action bars. Luckily you can make the process much easier with a few macros,  plus your class is the slowest to level so you'll get plenty of time for practice.
---
Gear is very important, weapons even more. In terms of dps/tanking/leveling speed, there is a whole world between a green quest gear war and someone who can afford regular gear updates from the ah. So don't be afraid to invest gold on your warrior.
---
I don't recommend prot leveling at all. With a dps spec you can tank just fine until lvl 60 and still be relevant in pvp. Also, 
---
Heroic Strike is the first spell you learn, but it sucks hard until much later and need to be replaced by Sunder Armor ASAP
---
&gt; to encourage more numbers 
---
Oh, having 52% of the population isn't good enough?
---
If he was the only one with it then yeah definitely. Warriors are massively overrepresented in pservers/Classic.
---
Still though, 200k is doubt
---
I mean because the game encourages it. You are rewarded for being an asshole directly with the best items through honor rewards. The most efficient honor grind for most characters other than rogues is to form a small group between 4-8 people to maximize honor per kill and kill everyone you find above level 48 in a zone like WPL.
---
You have trouble winning fights in smaller groups and you rely on fewer but more rewarding kills because you aren't splitting the honor with 30 people in a raid. This means you have to kill even lvl 48's because you still get significant honor when you add up all those lowbie kills.
---
He got the recipe he can do whatever the fuck he wants with it.
---
yikes
---
I did 181 runs for HoJ, as a rogue, so stealthing it and hitting lockout, then working on an alt for 30 mins, then doing 5 more tries. You should probably use a sim spreadsheet and see how much dps you would gain compared to that effort and maybe work on something else, like gold farming so youre fine in later phases lol
---
initially i figured just sticking with a 2h for the reck bombs would be necessary, but now im pretty much forced to switch to 1h+shield against rogues and maybe warriors for the extra survivability
---
\+ if you've seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz4HzuZ8Cs8) , i actually can do more seal damage by switching weapons every once in a while so it's not a huge loss. downside is that i can't really concentrate on reckoning bombs that way
---
I’m end game raid, Shadow days are behind me.

[Looting and many other actions have a batching window](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cdzeoi/looting_items_from_mobs_is_on_a_400ms_batch/), similar to spell batching.

Guide uses later prices when riding was the expensive cost and mount was the cheap one.
---
This is how it feels to be alliance. Good job making the horde realize their IQ levels!!
---
That could have been a joke or not. This is internet, you never know.
---
Rtasdfgzxcv 1-6, shift alt and control on mouse buttons, also use mousewheel for most common like mail swipe etc.
---
Few random keybinds on mouse for less important stuff like food, mount, hearth etc
---
F1-4 for some other stuff less used typically and I use f5-9 for target marking
---
&gt; minority faction
---
Sure, as the faction that has 48% of the players (Horde) I'll take a slight advantage.
---
Whoaa! You can actually reach the boat?
---
Well yes, but what about those hooves? Did my sword mash all four of them?
---
Actually on my 40/60 server with more horde the alliance with a proper scheme survive rather well. 
---
They organize to depart from IF to Chillwind with another Schologroup and suddenly 10 alliance wreak havoc on the 5-10 honor farmers camping the post.
---
If your friends are on a PvP server chances are they want to PvP. I run around in MS spec after raids, so I can actually contribute. Just respec after raid night and your PvP prowess goes through the roof with each and every single character. 
---
If you dont have an epic mount yet, lock yourself into your respective class' dungeon grind method and get one. Take the 3 minute longer path from Redridge to Burning Steppes and you can slip past Morgan's Vigil.
---
Really only carebears who land with their 50% leather geared fury warriors get eaten alive. 
---
Adapt your gear and spec to the PvP server you will do a lot better.
---
DM and wPvP at the same time would be an even larger shitshow. Almost seems self-explanatory.
---
You know what irritates me more than mages being shitty about water/food (yes, they're indeed dicks)?
---
People who don't come to a dungeon prepared and then rant about other members lmfao.
---
I hate it when I die myself all the way through the allies to ubrs, then someone starts crying to not roll in XY.
---
That's so freaking cool, great screenshot
---
I've put together raid groups, but I'm not experienced and the groups always end up falling apart and/or multiple horde groups show up and steamroll.
---
Which servers are those, exactly?
---
Just help him farm the next one and say sorry, you don't have to be his personal slave or anything. You fucked up but you are admitting it and accepting responsibility, that's more than enough.
---
What do you mean by the "nerfed version"?
---
LOL that rogue should delete their character and bnet account.
---
Did you not read my post? Or did you make some dumb assumption based on your own bias.
---
Honestly in classic, the only good paladin spec is holy.  Holy is an absolutely powerhouse spec, it is the most mana efficient healer in the game, and they are pretty indestructible in pvp. However, they are stuck with the worst dps spec in the game (Ret), and the worst tank spec in the game.  Prot pallies are ok tanks,  early levels they are actually super strong (Consecrate, judge, autoattack)  but at max level they will struggle.  They can work, but it's just simply harder to be a pally tank.  Their abilities are far too mana expensive, and the lack of a taunt makes them useless on some content.
---
For leveling, tanking, and pvp. The only choice is arms. It has the most utility, aoe threat, and solo capability of all three specs. Nearly every single talent you will take in the arms tree directly improves your dps, there is no filler like in fury or protection.  Arms has Tactical Mastery, Sweeping Strikes (For huge aoe dps potential), Impale (For large crits), and mortal strike (a good dps ability, and the best pvp ability in the game)
---
Start with  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0230501135001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0230501135001) and build towards  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033050213525100001-05](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033050213525100001-05) (You can swap out Axe Specialization for Swords).  Finally in the end you can go 31/20 Arms/Fury dps spec, or level/swap to 31/5/15 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033050213525100001-05-502301103](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033050213525100001-05-502301103) which is a hybrid dps, pvp, tank spec.  It's not a bad dps spec for lower gear levels and pvp, especially Tier 1, and has most of the strong early tanking talents.
---
Low drop rates + low amount of loot from each boss + high amount of players = low chance of get your target pieces = long gearing process = people losing patience.
---
How do you restore a main?
---
Where's my keyring?! rable rable
---
&gt;New to this meme shit so I guess I’ll start by saying you’re all a fucking boomer. 
---
No.. just no... you would say; you're all fucking boomers.
---
Not; you're all a fucking bomoer
---
lol
---
This is what I worte a few days before classic release back in August:
---
&gt;Take PvP server A on which Horde is in a stronger position. This may be all fun and games for a while but sooner or later, many Alliance players might get tired of getting ganked all the time and then they transfer off to Server B, where Alliance is in a more favourable position.
---
&gt;This is tipping the scales on Server B and now a lot of Horde players say "Screw this, I'm transferring to Server A where I won't get ganked all the time".
---
&gt;Sooner, rather than later, we're back at 9:1 ratio faction ghetto servers where no World PvP can exist.
---
That posting stands at -3, even though I was absolutely right - once again proving that this sub's hivemind is mostly made up of morons.
---
If there were multiple people they could do it for each other's accounts
---
Winterspring boss drops ok-ish frost mage ring. Plus some other loot from other bosses.
---
Look, not everyone has to be knowledgable of the game.
---
But why walk around acting like you are?
---
It’s funny, when I played as horde on private servers that had a very balanced population, people would tell me that horde were peaceful and only alliance gank, when in reality it was probably even....
---
Now that there’s way more horde and they have every zone under control, the same people are saying it’s even.
---
I don't see how someone can fully commit to a higher end guild with a full time job. With world bosses, you literally need to be on call at a moment's notice to battle it out vs multiple other top guilds for up to hours on end. By Naxx, you're looking at hundreds of gold per week in consumables. Flasks alone are well over 100g each on big servers, and we haven't even reached peak demand when flasks are a requirement for just about any guild doing harder content.
---
I don't see anything "easy" about this for the average casual player, especially non-dps classes on non-dominant factions that will have a hard time doing just about anything in the world meaningfully. If "easy" means spending all your weekly playing time just to buy consumes, then you're not lasting in min-max top guilds that care about parses rather than merely clearing content.
---
Bottom right of character-list there's a button that says "Restore deleted characters" or something along those lines
---
It’s only a problem if you use words like homo and other stuff, same rules as any other chat in the game.
---
Maybe you misunderstood that I meant on a per server basis, not game wide. The faction balance is almost meaningless outside of individual servers since cross server you never see the impact of that.
---
I most likely won't raid at all in classic and I'm still fed up with the 374859293 "look we cleared MC/this game looks so gorgeous/I'm playing at my pace and took 3 months to level 14 its so amazing!!!1!" posts...
---
Bad why? Nothing to kill?
---
Could not find it initially, gotta do some digging
---
I've seen an old game made anew and I can tell you your old game is still back where it was, in the past. This new old thing they have given you, it won't last long before it's adulterated.
---
No it’s not. If he can afford it, he can do whatever the hell he wants lol.
---
That just means you cant kill me in a semi-fair fight ;)
---
a realm are more like 3-4k players (at the same time) big, i dont know where you are getting 30k from O\_o
---
Damn I got onwed.... :)
---
probably an unpopular opinion but I think they release stuff earlier to get classic out of the way for shadowlands.  
---
and while shadowlands is out (good or bad) they will go the route of making TBC Servers.
---
Most PVP servers are 40/60 or better.
---
We'll still be congratulating people for hitting 60 8 months from now. Slow people need their props too. Everybody has their own journey and pace.
---
Yeah, I’d watch that stream on twitch!
---
The point is that it didnt die overnight, as claimed. It died like 2 years later due to queue times.
---
Niiiice
---
Cheers
---
Who could have guessed those mass spam trash guilds would have shitty people?
---
Omg but this is so bad. Are they going to do something with this? It cannot be that the modern 1.13 is slower than 1.12 why would they make it like that, the delay is so annoying that everytime i do something i have to doublecheck if i looted/picked something.. i feel like am getting paranoid coz of this lmao.
---
&gt; I’m see equal killings of both factions on my server, Fairbanks
---
You are obviously not playing on the same Fairbanks as everyone else.
---
But why? Is he doing it just purely to be a dick?
---
End game raids tend to bring along one or two shadow priests ~~to act as enablers for warlocks~~ for their *immense* dps.
---
*Dagger rogue stealth sounds*
---
I always forget about mp5. There just isn't much of it honestly until later gear levels.
---
No they don’t, Heigan on retail is a 30 second fight at most.
---
Sir this is a wendys
---
59 lvl ally druid on Shazrahh - got rank 30% Corporal with 60 kills and 2 900 honor. Didn't do any group PvP. Much more fun and technicaly challenging in comparison with the 25 raid running around resulting in even less honor..
---
Top Horde guild on the server is laughable.  Eternal is garbage, mass recruit guild.
---
There's like 50 guilds on this server that are 10/10 1/1.
---
Why are The Horde* such assholes. This is an Alliance-only boat that goes to the peaceful Elvish island city.
---
Oh I’m sure there are new players in this game but I don’t think they will start in December and stumble into BGs. They already started playing and are higher level now.
---
The thing with vanilla back then is that there was a scarcity. You couldn’t just buy it. It was sold out everywhere. And it needed to be spread around with friends and family who showed others how cool it was because paying a monthly fee for a game is a deterrent and was an even bigger one at that time. So people trickled in over the years as the playerbase grew. Classic playerbase won’t grow. Those who want to play it, played it.
---
I played twinks at the time, it basically died overnight, within that same patch you would get 1hr+ queues. If all you have to claim as a playerbase are pre-mades then the scene died. Plus if it died due to queue times that means it still died for the same reasons as stated. It certainly did not last 2 years, maybe the twink guilds you knew lasted 2 years but the twink scene itself definitely did not.
---
haha that was invalid before game started.
---
It's your pvpBis, stats are good and you need +2% spellhit atleast for pvp as a hp, still not an excuse, i assume you're not a pvp player, you didn't know that and will not use it anyway but don't feel that guilty for an item  because he is officer
---
Yep. I'm leveling my paladin slowly as holy/prot.  It does a lot more damage than i thought it would do. But it's still very slow, I just feel indestructable while I do it. Especially after leveling a warrior.
---
Most PvP-servers have always been Horde dominated, even 15 years ago. Horde attracts the gankers and the anti-social. This is not news, so don't act surprised.
---
too bad everyone has spy and will just instantly target you.
---
No doubt about it the dude who is crafting for free is a moron. However there is nothing against the rules for this. He got the pattern he can do with it as he pleases. 
---
Seems like the opposing guild is just salty they aren’t getting anymore fake money.
---
WTF. Kick the mage, there is a lot of em
---
Not your best call I am afraid, but arguably even more idiotic that someone else recommends it as an upgrade. 
---
Strat UD neck is what you want. Took me some 13-14 runs before it finally decided to drop.
---
Just get yourself an Azure Silk Belt, for that sick 15% swim speed! In stock now, on Zandalar Tribe-EU!
---
Excellently played, sir. Not one but two scrubs fell off the boat trying to get you. And they are lame for camping that peaceful boat anyway.
---
I would kill to be on a pve server. Why don’t I reroll then? Because I am a hardcore pve raider and I simply cannot find a guild of the caliber I desire with the raid times necessary for me to be able to raid with 99% attendance on a pve server. A majority of the best hardcore pve guilds are on pvp servers. Yes, there are some highly skilled raiding guilds on pve servers but, unfortunately for me, none that fit my raiding schedule that are as skilled as I’d like.
---
The realm discord?
---
I highly doubt that. Let's see.  
---
RemindMe! One Year
---
That function is not possible to remove without disabling /target macros
---
If you don't get 15 hks they give you a random standing I think. My brother got 8 hks and it says standing 165
---
we do weekly mc/onyxia raids.
---
last week one of the fury warriors got deathbringer from onyxia and was told that he'd be put in the back of the loot council ques because it's so good, he was supposedly fine with that
---
this week comes around, we down rag, Band of Accuria drops and he's so mad that he's not allowed to vote, so he gquits
---
even crazier, our guild bank mage left with him because "loot council was dishonest" even though he got talisman of ephemeral power in that very raid
---
people are crazy over loot
---
&gt; I'm not experienced
---
You dont get experience not grouping. World/large scale PVP does not work like 15v15 BGs. Well, it does, but there's no clear goals of "go to this point and take it". You still have to split the group, flank, make coordinated strikes, etc. 
---
I've won a fair amount of BGs on retail, ones people constantly complain Horde cant win. I have achievements for doing shit like 4 capping EotS. The key is watching the field, and switching up tactics on the fly. Maybe instead of leading yourself, you get a few people that lead smaller groups (maybe 10 or 20). These people have assigned tasks, for instance Group B might be assigned to handle flanking. That leader can work to coordinate when and where that happens. #management
---
I've seen a surprising amount of people horde and alliance two, three or more times. It's pretty cool.
---
Honestly, I'm kinda annoyed that we have BGs coming out crossrealm.
---
These assholes should have to deal with the 3 hour dead server WSG queue times that are a direct result of their shitty behavior.
---
Focus doesn't work in classic
---
Perfect 😍😂
---
Sounds like a dead guild
---
Focus target is disabled in Classic wow.
---
still doesnt help when a lot of people may quit over the next 3 weeks. it hurts both factions and a lot of more casual players wont wait a month for a resolution
---
"lowbie zone" - all mobs were red 😭😭😂
---
Why not? Blizzard seems to agree the fast paced content is the way to go. There's more information out there for w everyone so everything is easier and should be faster, therefore content should come put faster to keep even the average player interested.
---
I stopped watching 1 sec when I saw the guild tag
---
Next step: Horde opens laboratories to breed alliance babies and abort them to farm honor, sortof like *The Matrix*.
---
I love being notified that the Alliance asshole who ganked me, and is now on my KoS list, is in sight.
---
and "your faction NPC" means all factions under alliance/horde as well as alliance/horde forces
---
Why??
---
Naxx was removed in TBC ? Are you sure afaik it was still accessible just fine.
---
How do you differentiate  between unit frames command vs spy commands?
---
Sounds to me like you robbed yourself of a level 60 experience because you told yourself it’s better to stay low level
---
Yea, either no idea how to use it or no interest in pushing their performance.
---
I'm the happiest Christmas tree! Ho-ho-ho! He-he-he!
---
BG's and IMPEACHMENT on the menu for December! Feels GOOD!
---
He got 6 kills and then died... Perfect example of outrage call-out culture right here everyone.
---
This dude wants his twink hat
---
i had 108k honor with standing 51...
---
It was only the 2 of us that raid, right after our class leader quit. It felt like there was some sense of coordination and order. I think he thought since it was just him and a noob he could take advantage.
---
Same thing happened to us horde on anathema. We got the kill and Ally denied for 90 mins. Luckily I left after 5 mins of that bs and went to farm a couple crystals in EPL while everyone was occupied. 
---
From what I was told, the raid lead looted all the items finally and they went to org to distribute. They had to submit a ticket to distribute the loot but I doubt gms did a damn thing. I never followed up on it, nothing dropped that I needed.
---
LOL watch the full clip he doesnt sound like he's joking LULZORZ
---
No alliance is safe
---
There's a rogue on my server who literally spends all day at kargath just rezzing, getting a single kill, dying, and repeating the process. He currently has the highest rank on the server.
---
I don't get it. Are you saying alliance players are dogs?
---
If everyone knows then why were twink only qs basically dead after the change?
---
Probably something to do with multiboxing, from what I’m seeing.
---
I have to know how you do this
---
Who said all my PvE skills had no use in PvP 😂
---
Worng. No sorry, i think you are right
---
Skeram was decently balanced before the mass exodus. Reap what you sow.
---
Cmon, you aren't really this stupid. You know PvE servers exist right?
---
It’s his server though. Skeram is the 2nd most Horde dominant US Server: like 68% Horde, 32% Alliance.
---
I think he meant the anniversary stuff.
---
But tbh. Naxx was hard in Vanilla because people didn't understand how to play the game. Class tuning wasn't was it is now and tactics for those fights were mostly made by the people winging it. Not meticulously theorycrafted videos online.
---
That and needing 8 warrior tanks to all have their set bonus so that taunts wouldn't miss on 4 horsemen.
---
Are you going to transfer from a 45/55 server to a 55/45 server? So brave of you.
---
So, in classic there's no such thing as focus sadly, since the whole macro is written around it, it won't work.
---
ok; byby
---
Lol that's so lame, so multiboxing is okay, but focusing isn't? Lame
---
Three actually 😎 someone gets sort of lost in the first moonfire, but he's the first one off 😂
---
3 weeks...
---
That i can agree with
---
What's the closest I can get to it? Any idea?
---
There's no chance they do anything other than stagger content releases between the games to maintain higher sub uptime from content tourists.  Downvoting reality doesn't change it.
---
So roll something that can counter rogues.
---
Probably a lot more than 25% tbh. They're like the blood elves of classic
---
Looking for an answer for this too.
---
Transfer off it's not worth it
---
Did you down vote the post then?
---
OmniCC can do this.
---
Ive been playing since launch and not once have i experienced this probelms described here unless there has been server instability. Spell batching while still involved in this process, does not cause this type of delay to loot etc
---
IF the server is lagging and OP isnt, the inputs arent being put into the batch you would expect. Say he loots a dead mob. At 50ms his character will immediately perform the loot animation and wait for a server response, but because od the server lag the input hasnt been put into the next batch it has been delayed, causing the loot to not be distributed to his bags at the speed you are used to.
---
Talk about rushing shit. BG's should have released along with the honor system so this whole shitshow wouldn't have happened in the first place but no...they just had to please streamers first.
---
Just do some gdkp/auction runs instead of raiding with your guild or joining the 1+ raids; buy your loot and get paid if you don't get any loot.  
---
You might have to put forth the effort of actually setting up/recruiting for the auction run, though.  
---
Or just stop shelling out for the raids. Your personal damage isn't going to slow down the raid, and if you're not getting rewards for showing up, you shouldn't be expected to fork out any cash. A good guild will have consumables available or offer some sort of compensation anyway.
---
Would be salty too, but would not mass report him or do anything else shady. Still, would be bummed out because my prime source of income would suddenly be gone.
---
Can't get that addon to work.
---
since there are Devilsaur crossfactions mafias, there could be "services" that will for example kill u in Thorium point so you can make it to BRM ... i can see one milion other examples how this can be abused
---
zygors is very inaccurate with its values, some values it doesnt even detect sometimes. i stopped using it as a reference after lvl 50. i found pawn to be far better
---
Cry like a bitch.
---
You guys could outnumber us, just roll PVP. Most PVP servers arent grossly imbalanced either. If you cant take a less than 2:1 disadvantage on average, what the actual fuck guy.
---
no need to get personal. I was just genuinely concerned for your mental health after reading that first comment.
---
Get well soon
---
As a Horde raiding weekly on Skeram, I haven't even bothered with wpvp since the p2 release. Even with the pop differences, when I was doing my rhokdelar 5-6 weeks ago I was endlessly ganked in Ungoro and Burning Steppes. This was when there was no honor system in place, when I am doing a class quest that can already get frustrating.
---
As for Alliance on Skeram, this is just sad. I wish it wasnt like this because it is going to push even more people off of the server or convince them to quit.
---
This cannot actually be much fun for the Horde that are doing patrols outside BRM, it looks so boring.
---
It's insane how few allies play pvp on that realm. Idalein is not even halfway through Corporal with a standing of 341. She has roughly 3.2k rank points, which is roughly top 40%. That means only around 850 alliance players were eligible for ranking on that server.
---
For comaprison, I had a standing of 232 and am 60% through rank 3, so I got 8k rank points, which puts me at the top 6% of the realm, meaning around 3900 people ranked on my server.
---
I’m horde on yojamba. I think our sever is pretty balanced tbh.
---
I mean, it's not like your guild has a great reputation on our server.....
---
So bad, it split into a new guild literally called Collusion.
---
This is how Horde players justify their overpowered pvp racials. If they had a higher IQ they could see how adding all servers (pvp, rppvp, pve) to get an idea of faction balance is literally the dumbest way to do it.
---
Remember guys, when the 3 undead rogues start stabbing when you land in Theramore, think about the people on the other side of the computer. They've been dealt a shit hand IRL and can use a break in game. That's why I never get mad at unfair WPvP.
---
I would highly recommend a priest. They are some of the most efficient levelers in the game. With spirit tap and wand specialization, you can take on 2 or 3 enemies and still leave the encounter with full mana. I only ever need to drink water when I'm in dungeons, never in the open world. Also, shadow priests are fun as hell to melt some faces.
---
I feel like every Undead Rogue PVP is exactly the same, should do something different, like PVP without any gear on or something.
---
all weapons are hunter weapons
---
Read what you wrote again.
---
I know a great salad bar...
---
Because people price gouging deserve to get brought down a peg
---
Levelling during the first weeks of honor release is hell for either side, that’s why most people are levelling in instances exclusively right now.
---
Yeah i guess if its fun then there is that, I couldnt run BRD that much, its a hellhole
---
Almost as much as paladins do in dungeons
---
How do you know they are price gouging, most people just agree that 100g per craft is fair
---
Thanks for this, would I have to change something in the macro if I want to bind it to a key? Or will it recognize my "Q" as button 1 and my "shift Q" as button 2?
---
You're going to be disappointed. Progress cleared Naxxramas hours after it released on Lightbringer. I don't expect it to go differently unless some core aspect of the instance is tuned wrong or horribly broken, but there's some evidence that private servers were actually overtuned and these groups have had over a decade to sharpen their tactics.
---
&gt; Phase 5 is going to roll out in a few months and people will be paying 1g or more for these, or fighting for spawns to farm their own. I already have enough for months of AQ and Naxx raiding.
---
“I scavenged the auction house for hours a day every day so that I can sell items for a profit in one year”
---
sounds like a manchild, just ignore him and move on
---
As a Horde on Skeram, I would prefer a more even split with decent wpvp. Only time I really see alliance for wpvp is on Tuesday nights when we generally move from Kargath to MC as a 40 man unit or get killed in groups of 2 or 3 by other 40 man ally groups.
---
I would rather run into 1 or 2 alliance by myself in Silithus, UC, Plaguelands, etc. And get some actual wpvp going on. The current situation is horrific and boring. I've got my rhok, 2/2 DS and most prebis or GS so wpvp was all I really had to enjoy until Phase3 and now it is worthless.
---
Everyone loses here.
---
He is maybe exaggerating, but you should check the russian server "Wyrmthalak".
---
That's a server with a 100% alliance population.
---
Positive KDR what's the problem?
---
No, if he will not use any ability, and just stand still :)
---
Man I tried to get to brd lol like one of my previous posts says, death run right from the fp to the instance. I rage logged once I saw the horde filled the entire chamber between lava and the portal too.
---
Both are dicks in my opinion, you can easily charge 300g per lionheart + mats, the fact he's doing free though extremely kind, I'd be so fuckin pissed if I had let's say a warrior and leveled BS, got to be one of the chosen few on realm to get the pattern. Then someone do some shit like that. now don't get me wrong I think what the guys that are doing the reporting are fucked up, but I get it lol.
---
That’s what everyone thinks and what everyone will grind. And then you’ll sit on them because the price never reaches the point you want it to reach
---
Thanks :-)
---
I doubt RFK would drop plate.
---
If an officer goes apeshit about a random boss drop with a decent drop rate, I'd consider if that guild is a good thing to spend my time on. A hunter rolled need on Jang'thraze the Protector when I already have the other one and I'm not even mad.
---
Kinda bad that you can do that tbh.
---
Nearly everyone is wrong here.
---
Each ability you have 'levels' internally until the next rank of it comes available. Next time check your rock biter weapon when you level up (not a new rank, judt the next time you level). It will give more AP, and the tool tip will have an i increase in 'level' for it.
---
RB has the most consistent damage of it all across all weapon speeds. WF is statistically similar, but is prone to burst over consistency. It comes out to about the same dps.
---
Watch melderons shaman guides on youtube for some statistical analysis on which weapon buff to use. He breaks it down mathematically and it is clear that RB is always better. He also explains the internal 'levelling' phenomenon for abilities.
---
They never have 2 eyes. Not one murloc.
---
Funny your group wouln't talk about who rolls before anyone actually rolls.
---
No fucking chance in HELL its only 3-4k at a time. Maybe you have a dead ass server.  But firemaw? MUST be atleast 10k on a pretty buisy day.
---
I've seen it several times, I have guild friends who writes to people that lf1m tank for 30+minutes and says he does to for 25g
---
Google "wow classic &lt;itemname&gt;"
---
Website classic.wowhead has a load of good info and user comments on every item in game. Drop rates given are from vanilla though, and blizzard has changed some drop rates for classic, but in general its pretty good
---
I'll take anything that reduces the amount of people camping searing gorge and BRM
---
Would be weird for them to do it in january as that is when the next Retail patch hits. I'd expect they want as many people playing every month, so 'weaving' the patches/phases between classic and retail.
---
I don’t mind reservations at all. If the item I want is reserved, I will simply look for another group or *form my own*. 
---
I’d rather go into an instance knowing something is reserved then have it be ninjad.
---
Hah I think I might have actually been in that group. I'm in Fury.
---
But yeah I mean I don't want to sound like I'm complaining, I only mean to put out there the facts I've observed, and for me that's basically been that no matter how many we get together, there's somehow always more of you soon enough lmfao. The only time we can efficiently kill people is if we hold something like Lights Hope or Blackrock Mountain with a massive raid, and even then there's always more of you guys, it's pretty nuts how much we get outnumbered
---
Top guilds also have more knowledgeable player with better gear (cloudkeeper, stronghold, force reactive), once BWL and AQ40 is out, they do MC + Ony+ BWL in one night and AQ40 in another.
---
This all comes together and increases gold farmed per hour. All mages will make 150g+ with bijous, hunters can do 7-8min DM:N trib run, warriors with BRE will blaze through DM:E in 8 minutes leaving 3 to clear herbs making 100g an hour.
---
The more gear and knowledge you have, the more gold you can piss away. A new player spending 50g a night in BWL progressing through content making 50g when farming has to do the same as a mage farming bijous 150g/hour spending 150g.
---
Apart from world bosses which indeed can be a massive hassle with spying and getting up at 3 in the morning on a tuesday night, you are overselling the time commitment of a top guild.
---
How do you know "most people" agree?
---
Dont complain about being ganked in cities. You can just unflag yourself
---
The logs for then speedrun can be found here:  [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/94yP2W8RFx6wBqK3#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/94yP2W8RFx6wBqK3#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2)

&gt; In original WoW patch 1.4, honor system was released 43 days after Dire Maul.
---
err, what?
---
Dire Maul: 7th March 2005
---
Honor system: 8th April 2005
---
That's 32 days in my book, where do you get 43 from?
---
It does not matter if it gives 2 honor per kill if others get only 1. You only need to get more than others.
---
I'm sure they type of person who gets their guild to report spam is a real great person
---
World pvp in a PVE server? Unlikely to happen. But worry not about raiding, that's effectively the only thing people can do on a PVE server.
---
I know there are battlegrounds, don't argue with me in that part. Cheers
---
Relax. I never said it had to be the exact day. That’s a total strawman from you. Not everyone has time to shitpost on here all day everyday like you. You have a terrible attitude
---
Oh god another guild named nova 🙄
---
As soon as they let you roll for the item, all other loot rules should be thrown out the door.  You won that shit fair and square.  I would have gquit right away.
---
Quick 5 man tanking guide for warriors. Be arms with sweeping strikes.  Charge in with your 2 handers, pop sweeping strikes switch to zerker and whirlwind. Now switch to your sword and board and apply sunders in D stance. Near the end of the pull, switch to battle stance and save rage for the next pull and repeat. This is the most effective way to get initial threat on groups.
---
The exact same thing happened to me. I wouldn't be so mad if it wasn't the hardest dungeon to find a tank for, esp in p2
---
I think Nethergarde Keep Horde only has about 6-10 guilds that have full cleared MC. Not sure about alliance though.
---
I thought matching did exist in vanilla?  I played on ADSL from Oz back then and, playing from Oz again now, it feels much the same honestly.
---
Ony never gave ranged AP
---
Bad
---
do you guys even pvp? 6k honor gtfo...
---
Avg income in usa is 25k??
---
I think he wants to avoid a situation where one faction intentionally locks the other out. For example, alliance guild is doing world buffs for raid and doesn't wanna lose them so all of them make a horde alt and log it in just an hour or two before raid to have hordes sit in a queue instead of BRM ganking them with their buffs.
---
You can hear whoever is speaking instruct everyone "If you see *x* or any of his guild spamming lionheart, report them." So, I'm assuming that this video is the proof op is posting to substantiate their claims that people are abusing the report system and screwing their GM.
---
I remember reading in reddit that some big battles like tarren mill vs southshore still happen on PVE servers and that's kinda what made me decide to reroll on one. I get all the fun PVP without the shitty ganking and inability to quest.
---
I'm not going to specify what guild I'm in but let's just say I'm in a guild with one of the first rag kills and top clear times in Classic. Clearing any vanilla content is not a concern, and the fact you think clearing BWL is some big obstacle reflects what kind of a shitty casual guild and mind state you are in. That's the equivalent of someone telling you to have fun never reaching 60, as if reach 60 is some big accomplishment.
---
This further reflects your projection and how "out of touch" you are with top end guild. You literally have no arguments left, you're exposed as a casual in some shitty guild that's happy to clear MC. So stop talking about top end guilds and how they work as if you've even sniffed it. As if it isn't laughable enough you think our guilds pay for raider's consumes out of the guild bank.
---
The thing is that your post is 9 years old and the BlizzCon2018 is 1 year old - and let's face it, for these two different years we are talking about two different companies, Blizzard and Blizzard/Activision, and two different games, retail (at that time, anyway) and classic. Are the policies, at heart, the same still? I want to believe, but I don't know. This doesn't however look very promising in that regard (from the most recent statement):
---
&gt;Ninja looting does have consequences in the community and those who do it will have trouble getting invited to group. In other words: your reputation will matter. Remember to play nice, play fair folks! 
---
But you can bet your bottom dollar that I will report any ninjalooting that I see, and implore anyone else involved does as well. And make sure that those people are exposed for what they are on the realm.
---
53. I know it won't save me from the gank squads, I figured I might have an easier time with people closer to my level that try. Thought maybe I could burst mobs down while questing to speed things up.
---
Where are you getting the single rogue from my post?
---
My workaround is binding number 6 from mouse's software to a strange keyboard combination and setting game bindings to that one.
---
So is there a reason to why a premade guildgroup hadnt already stated what items they needed?
---
It literally says you need 15 HKs to get a standing if you mouse over it.
---
Wolves and Kodos.
---
Just imagine joining a guild around AQ40 or Naxx and being outbid by everyone on loot because they've ran MC since day 1 and just have shitloads of DKP.
---
Stick with the combat build. The hemo/cold blood specc is great every 3 Minuten. Between those cooldowns your level speed decreases significant.
---
Hahaha beautiful reference!
---
P-servers use the 1.12 client. The 1.13 client is based off the 7.x client, so there's a shit ton of changes that p-servers dont have to deal with. 
---
P-servers also arent the same infrastructure as Classic.
---
Do you call 40-60 decently balanced? That means 50% more horde, that is huge imbalance from the beginning.
---
he probably added in the time to find people.
---
still there is nothing to raid lead in ony. if you are 30+ she doesnt evil get to deep breath just spread and stop dps when she lands literally  0 iq eequired
---
You can prefarm Sapphiron, that's not the biggest issue. I suspect 4 horsemen will be the bigger roadblock.
---
open bid, closed bid, priority to highest person with set prices?  
---
personally i like the open bid because watching people run up the price on the most sought after items
---
My experience of pure:
---
Most of your raiders will use it properly, spending dkp on useful upgrades as they need them, one will bid on everything even though they're already in negative dkp from their last 5 bids this raid alone and can't bid anymore yet still tries and one rogue is hogging 4,271,735 dkp in Naxx waiting for thunderfury wearing full blues.
---
Fuck off you zerging piece of shit
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-3o6Zt45jSpthw6NYHe
---
no both are not dicks. anyone that has lionheart helm recipe can choose to do what he wants with the recipe. cold fusion are the only dicks here. end of story
---
I understand that, but even you are stating that it exists to make the experience more similar to vanilla. It isn't perfect but it is closer to vanilla than retail is, or am I misunderstanding your point? 
---
My memory of Vanilla is that it was quite unresponsive and laggy...
---
AV is by far the easiest faction to hit Exalted with. Not to mention you'll be getting honor while you do it.
---
As ally on Gehennas it’s not like I get to bring the ony buff anywhere near to BRM anyways.
---
I didn’t go to raid bc of IRL plans. Am a warlock.
---
I dont think they get much out of you spamming "GO TO RETAIL" over and over again dude ;)
---
And okay with rogues taking thunderfuries and druids with hand of ragnaros? Not disagreeing with you, just seen those days in person and people got salty fast when loot was bought by classes and specs consensus didn't agree with.
---
Razorgore represent. Push back the zugzug brother.
---
When a soldier drops behind enemy lines, does the opponent let them wall out?
---
That's cool. I haven't logged in for 27 days.
---
If you are running Strath live and Star of Mystaria is an immense upgrade for you, you are not end game raid. Respec shadow, have some fun.
---
Works, and its been around since forever
---
Actually trolling is pretending to be an idiot to get people upset, or make some people look bad.
---
Our mage officer has run Scholo eleventy million times for the wand. Doesn’t drop for him.
---
I was thinking of rolling an alliance on firemaw, but nah. It is said that there is no alliance dominated realm in europe, meanwhile usa has hearthseeker. I just want a big alliance realm with a lot of hardcore raiders.
---
Inferno is easy, just follow on all your guys to a caster, immediately switching to your bombed guy to stop commands, or selectively disabling key maps on that guy.
---
And for living bomb, you just have to know where each character is on your window grid. It'd be pretty easy to click the right instance of wow when you know where they are in the grid.
---
The only other thing that seems like it would be garr, but it'd just be more annoying than difficult.
---
Ad for bwl/aq I'm not familiar enough with the specific mechanics to see if anything would be especially difficult. Honestly a lot of the stuff could probably be cheesed with a lot of damage.
---
I didn't think there would be anything quicker. I was afraid I was going to have to just ride out the grey screen storm lol. Thanks for the help!
---
Meanwhile Alliance thinks I should be punished for simply being a certain race.
---
Everyone knows who cares?
---
All of the raids in Classic are easier than Ulduar normal.
---
Literally all of them.
---
This notion that there can even be a "top" guild is silly. 
---
The only thing that makes a guild top is the number of players because they'll get all the world bosses and even that doesnt matter because the loot will be so split up.
---
Really the top guild is the guild that's most enjoyable
---
You are not a man of just wanting to tell people on boats about how sorry you are about what is going to happen
---
&gt; How do you know they are price gouging, most people just agree that 100g per craft is fair
---
100g per craft is not fair at all when someone is offering for free.  it depends on the server, and how many people are crafting it.  At this point, that's a very unreasonable fee since a lot of people can craft it.  You needed to get on that bandwagon earlier if you wanted to take advantage.
---
No, you need someone else to make the character.
---
Person A deletes character, B makes character with that name, A gets a free name change from what I hear.
---
yea it was crazy tonight lol we managed to push in with another raid down to the entrance before we got overwhelmed hehe
---
Sounds about right.
---
Hard agree. Needs a punishment.
---
quarter in Utah
---
LMFAO. I love how this comment gets 200 downvotes. Alliance are absolutely T R I G G E R E D as FUCK. hahahaha. I've been camping level 20s in duskwood for a while on my 60 mage in skeram. I'm keeping this shit up until every alli quits the game on our realm. They are all absolute scum. zug zug
---
So you don’t play but keep paying, cool
---
Then what the fuck is [this?](https://imgur.com/GHPfz3F)
---
Screenshot your 1 HK standing or you're full of shit.
---
Hey it’s me, your alt.
---
Thoughts on me? Which is funny because now I know what your thoughts on yourself is because of your projection. And I'd love to hear your thoughts on how I can call out your total bullshit thoughts on top guilds and how they operate without being called toxic. Because let's be honest between you and me, I am 100% right about you, and with your projection, I am even more validated. I have a spot in my guild because I have the time to do exactly what I told you raiders do in top end guilds. I get the best gear/buffs/consumes and I pressed my two button rotation. Which is exactly my point about why casual full time workers aren't going to last in guilds like mine once we need to do more than MC/Ony/world bosses per week. Because if you can't no-life like me, why is a guild going to keep you over someone who can? Especially when all top guilds care about is clear times.
---
Then transfer
---
No XP? That is great I think.
---
Sorry if I don't understand this correctly: Why is there a bracket? Isn't it completely random which players are matched together or is there a matchmaking? In my experience one can be lucky, if BGs get played at all, so the level range should be from 10-19 anyways (or does it start at 11?).
---
I don’t like transfer because it can only worsen the situation. Queue is a solution even if it does not ensure the same percentage of people are going to pvp. I definitely think that battlegrounds will solve the problem. There will still have world pvp but at least, in a reasonable way
---
Well zygor guide probably prioritises dps stats as its a levelling guide, hence why it said it was an upgrade. Thats the only reason i can think of.
---
game became shit once everyone got used to dungeon finder. So wotlk was the last good expansion because it was this new exciting feature. Also rereleased naxx, ulduar, trial and ICC were all awesome raids, fight me.
---
You're playing the wrong game if you just want open world PVP.
---
In Retail, when Blizzard gave the minority faction a warmode bonus beyond the majority, Alliance: turned on WM, camped Horde flight masters until they completed the quest, then turned it off. 
---
To act like being Alliance somehow puts you above this type of behavior is a flat out lie.
---
Except this isn’t a war with both sides equally incentivized to kill each other
---
As a level 60, your primary objective is to kill me in my 50’s for your honor points. My primary objective is to try and get quests done to gain xp to hit 60. So you have a double-advantage - you’re literally just playing to kill me AND you have a huge power advantage should I try to fight back because of your level.
---
Sure I can spend time trying to rally a crew to take you down - but this goes against my primary objective, which is to gain xp and level - so it just becomes a game where you’re incentivized to camp me and kill me and I’m incentivized to ... run away and hope you don’t kill me as I try to do quests.
---
My game isn’t very fun.
---
aq has a lotttttt of things that need you to be spread out and individually doing stuff, no way  
---
bwl first boss needs 4 groups for the corners killing adds and a 5th group controlling the boss through the first phase, if you fail for a second you insta wipe
---
Level range 10-19 = bracket
---
Ya, kinda like how firelands was in cataclysm but for some reason it’s the first full raid in classic
---
Embrace it! 
---
But try to level through instances from now on.
---
At 54 you can go BRD until 57.
---
Then hit strath scholo etc.
---
You will have Great gear at 60 and don’t die That often.
---
There's no crit juju?
---
I'm in Liquidated on alliance and know a few members of Eternal. This sounds exactly like something they would do.
---
Yeah absolutly, Ban every single cunt in that guild.
---
BUT, they should also remove the autoban that kicks in when you get to many reports. Because thats a dumb fucking system.
---
No issues with language here.
---
So I'm a bit averse to making (too many) alts, as it takes away time from progressing your main. However, you really should shoot for having fun and doing what you want (in my case, that was getting to do some endgame PvE, which is why leveling alts would be a bit counter productive in my case) and I think anyone playing the game the first time wants to explore some different classes and playstyles. Even at 33, you still have over half of the journey left, and the journey doesn't really end at 60 - it just becomes a different type of journey. 
---
So do what feels most fun, but word of advice - don't get caught up in only leveling alts - there's a lot of fun stuff happening at 60.
---
Welcome to hell of leveling...
---
Get in AH and buy the slowest and highest damage weapon as you can get. Gear is not necessary but always use a good weapon. Staff, 2h mace, doesn't matter. Use slowest and highest damage weapon you can use. When you get to WC, try to get staff from last boss. Living Root. That should carry you to level 30, then you can get carried for Whirlwind quest. 2H level 40 axe that you can obtain in level 30. Next noteable upgrade is The Rockpounder. If you've came to that level, you are doing good.
---
Hahah yeah, I've heard it being something like 65/35 but even still, yeah it can be a bit of a mess.
---
I want to come inside Naxx  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
its a shit drop rate and the best neck till rag neck which has 10% drop rate.
---
the officer anger was very justified him not being gkicked just shows how tolerant the guild is
---
Thanks man
---
one day, those bindings will drop, and on that day, I WILL BE A GOD
---
Well when I'm told the ride is an hour and its 5 minutes, the problem isn't "I cant enjoy the ride" its "I got fucking lied to".
---
"Hey, I don't need anything in return for this, you can have it for free"
---
"OMG WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH A DICK?!"
---
The guy offering for free is fucking over 10+ people trying to sell it legitimately, for no reason
---
Aka you get wrecked and the your 2iq brain rationalizes so you can cope
---
in think we found one of the drivers
---
Yes, you can choose to be a dick. Doesn't make you less of a dick.
---
this has been a long known issue for years on retail. people use this feature to silence their competition. dont expect anything to change, they dont care.
---
there is/was also a method to make enemy players dcs during an arena or rbg match.  technically if you keep doing it systematically with enough people, you can get people banned for a day despite them not doing anything wrong. we used that method to get people banned on the last day of rank1 push to grief people we didnt like and deny them the title.
---
the system is garbage and needs to be reworked, but they wont invest in it. in hots they used the same garbage where you get automatically banned for reaching a certain report threshold despite not trolling, flaming or inting. i tested that with a friend a on a fresh account after he got  banned. they even encourage you to come back and make a new account. :)))) 
---
we both had fresh accs, i didnt type anything at all and only played properly. he asked people to report me. if you have the time and a friend, feel free to recreate it. you will see.
---
honestly, these kind of issues need manpower to be solved, but the costs are too high, so its unrealistic to expect that they fix it. they do the bare minimum, so just hope that A.I. gets developed to a point that we can use that as solution until then we have to endure or move on. tbh, its the same with bots being banned in waves except some bots are going strong for 2+years now.
---
You don't need the consumables to finish the raid, you need it to finish the raid in a reasonable timeframe.
---
All mages between levels 42-60 does this. Why does it need yet Another video?
---
Actually it is true. If you ever played retail you would have known that every single highly populated pvp server became one faction server, even though the crz helped with the faction balance. (Yes you might have 20 horde in a zone and 2 alliance but it is nothing like having 200 hordes and 20 alliances even though the ratio is the same)
---
Life is a thing, and it's sort of taking all my time right now.
---
Ah yes, the dead guild with 80 active raiders every week
---
Oh I am completely open to being wrong, but please, would you and all the people like you replying to me give me a simple number. That is, the number of hours per week you think you need to put into the game to earn a spot in a top raiding guild once the raid contents are all released. Because this is my point: casual full time workers are not going to last in top guilds because they simply do no thave the time. This isn't "hardcore raiding" in 2005 anymore when hardly anyone even knew to get dm buffs.
---
Again, for all you people claiming I am out of touch, that I am wrong, just prove it. Just give me a time commitment number. How many hours do you think you need to earn a spot in a top guild without preferential treatment.
---
So excited for this! WPVP has been both fun and frustrating but you get what you give I guess. Last night I ganked a few allies going into BRM. Then when my friend wanted to go to BRD, we got ganked as well. Swings and roundabouts really. 
---
Super excited for AV again. I love to mini game aspects: collecting scraps and improving the guards etc. 
---
As a resto druid for PVP, can anyone give me some tips for BGs?
---
As someone with a lot of time, I personally dislike p2. After grinding it out throughly, the game play boils down to “roam around and kill any 50-59 that stand no chance”, or “get killed by 2+ 60s roaming around”.
---
It was fine for a day or 2 but I’m over it now. I mainly solo roam as a hunter.
---
&gt;If significantly lower, one shot and spam emotes.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If slightly lower, wait till they are in combat to attack.  
---
&gt;If same level, sheepishly sneak past them.
---
Straight out of a Rogue's Diary, the text becomes visible after heating it up slightly over a candle or near a cooking fire.
---
not only do they lack a spine, they also lack 200 customer service employees that might have been kinda useful in this kind of situation.
---
There are SO many posts crying about "faction imbalance". The best defense Alliance ever has (if they even have one, usually they just call me a liar despite census data) is that ironforge site that uses raid logs (not a good census system). But the census data says Ally is not outnumbered like they claim on PVP servers. 
---
So basically Alliance are endlessly complaining about an issue that only exists because they won't make groups and counter.
---
Glad to see the official site is up. I'll go submit my data later.
---
I prefer loot council. I can focus on killing bosses and when the inevitable bitching comes why my DPS hasn't increased over the last 3 months I can show the logs that my last given piece of loot was a spell power dagger 4 months ago because no one wanted it and no disenchanters so better give it to a dagger rogue hurr hurr hurr
---
Yeah, and you said "to be fair..." empathizing with a guild who initiate false player reports about the guy being nice. 
---
What is fair about that?  Fuck those people giving false reports, they are fuck stains. There is no "to be fair".
---
My server is such a farm heaven right now. Running around as 2man group farming whatever. Literally everything from essence pools to devilsaur are up. Keep logged out and keep crying. Thanks.
---
Nah he just hasn't lost touch with why you might play a game in the first place. To enjoy yourself? Ppl are so caught up in stupid shit it makes me cringe
---
I'm rerolling on atiesh ally if you wanna group up sometime. Pvp wasn't for me either. Nor just dinging 48 lmao.
---
the vocal people are always going to be the whiners, the majority of us are quietly enjoying the game, thats why blizzard doesnt listen to them.
---
Cause it’s about how long you need to repeat it to get the loot, not about how fast the wf players can clear it, which is gonna be 1 day even for bwl.. I personally hope it’s feb, March is a little late
---
Is this a joke or serious? If serious can you explain to me why this would be against ToS?
---
WF does not have an internal cooldown in classic, it just can't proc of itself, but back to back procs with any weapon speed is still possible. 
---
As long as you have flurry specced WF is better.
---
As long as you have a lot of spell power flametongue is better. 
---
If you don't have flurry or spell power the newest spell rank ist the best to use. Additionally, flametongue and rockbiter are more consistent, while WF and frostbite have a rng component to them.
---
Why are you running PuGs if you have a guild? Loot goes to those that attempt regularly on loot council. If that isn't happening it is either because:
---
1) You don't attend enough (because you are doing PuGs)
---
2) The loot council is corrupt.
---
I was watching when they started whispering Soda about the server reset (not sure if true or trolls) did they finish it?
---
Nobody would pay 1000 gold fee for Lionheart lol. 
---
People should stop blindly believing what sb told them.
---
You know those numbers are bullshit right? Firemaw the last week, 28% Horde 72% Alliance. No way that's anywhere near accurate.
---
God damn. The zoomers have invaded classic.
---
The AP doesn't stack either.
---
&gt; so dominant
---
What ratio do you consider the start of "so dominant"?
---
Just a joke lol.
---
/r/woooosh
---
This was a joke on pretty much every vanilla private server in existence.
---
Not agreeing with op but you are wrong. Recent stats was 65% at 60 a week ago. 20% 50-59 and 15% below.
---
In my experience, it has always been to lose.
---
You're prorably right, honestly it's been too long for me to remember
---
In classic you dork.
---
Classic isn't hard. It's a joke. All of it is not even heroic ICC level hard. It's somewhere around raidfinder.
---
Downvote is one of the ways to vent off frustration and anger after being farmed for honor non-stop, I perfectly understand why people do that. It sucks to log off after a pointless frustrating gaming section and then get laughed at on the gaming forum for all your woes: I'd say it's server death squads vs. reddit downvoting brigades at this point.
---
Not worth it. 
---
I've done over 200 DME jump runs at this point checking every spawn location and picking up a tonne of dusty tomes. So far I've gotten a pile of blue books and 3 forors and a total of 0 were from the dusty tomes. 
---
The dropchance is so low from them that it's not worth solo farming for them
---
Did you play on a laggy connection in vanilla? It was not as responsive as retail, but it wasn't laggy or unresponsive unless there were actual reasons for it. If you were in a TM/SS zerg it was very unresponsive. If you were in BWL and the raid servers weren't getting DDOSed, it was quite responsive. It was not noticeably affecting gameplay the way it is in classic. 
---
It exists to make the experience more similar to vanilla and it fails at that. It's not closer to vanilla than retail because the problems introduced because of the low-priority of spells did not exist in vanilla, and most agree that those problems are more detrimental than the quirks it's meant to simulate. Is seeing 2 mages sheep each other once in a while worth having spells repeatedly fail? Are mobs ignoring pulls and wiping groups worth seeing 2 warriors charge each other sometimes? Is it worth frequent and noticeable delays on spells to be able to sheep a warrior who "successfully" pummeled you? The whole complaint people are having about batching is that these "authentic" quirks are overshadowed by the negative and inauthentic problems that their implementation causes, and those problems are much more detrimental to gameplay at a much higher frequency than these quirks that it's supposed to simulate.
---
And I'm pretty sure that's where the USB comes in. You can basically do whatever you want with it
---
And what data do you have to counter this?
---
It's kind of funny.  Looking at your user name makes me realize you're just a troll, but the circlejerk on this subreddit is so strong that they think you're supporting them.
---
So? There have been servers with similar or even worse ratios around in 2005 and 2006, especially after server transfers became available. Plus, it was pretty clear that horde dominance would be even worse this time around because people now know ow the game works so many they went with the apparent winning team (Horde) right from the start.
---
same, i am just chilling and fishing while playing hearthstone battleground atm. i dont mind being behind or getting farmed by hardcore players. there are enough people with similiar gear progress who will give me a good fight once bgs are out.
---
it will be a nice goal to work towards too and i rather enjoy the journey than participate in the current dumb farming thingie.
---
Hunters will cry after full t2 and xbow. AQ+Naxx only pulling and tranqinq. Better respec bois fast.
---
Dreadmist ally here, fully decked in raid gear, unsubbed two days ago.
---
Wont be coming back.
---
Idk man, my top guild would be the one I had the most fun in.
---
I mean isn't that the point of guilds in the game?
---
To have fun with people who have similar goals, to work together towards something?
---
So at the end of the day is the guild with all the achievements/world firsts/highest number of raid clears/etc. really the best if it's not fun to be in it?
---
I am not sure about alliance corpserun time to BG portal but in this regard slaughtering them trying to register is effectively the same as GY reskill farming them on the actual battlefield, so you get an honor while you are on BG and you get honor while you are in the queue. Alliance has it quite hard already, I wouldn't want it to get even harder.
---
so that's why flyers in strat sometimes move 20-30yars to another pack before they aggro from me shooting at them with the bow?
---
That's kinda fucked up considering its just shooting with the bow...
---
Ah, my server had layers removed a while ago so I didn't notice.
---
&gt; So taking 2hours just to get to UBRS is playing?
---
Yep.  That's how you decided to spend your play time.
---
I haven't raided it in vanilla, aren't 4h a nasty gearcheck for t3?
---
How is this fun for anyone? Just a big shit show... BG's cannot come soon enough
---
Elemental is very good dungeon DPS, or specifically, the best AoE burst in the game when specced for it. Single target short fights are also something they excel at. The longer fights go the more they fall behind. 
---
Enhancement does fine dungeon dance but it's very RNG. Without the control you'll have certain fights where you really aren't much help cause you just didn't get WF price when you need them.
---
Only ever seen tanks get close tbh
---
Please post a video so I can live vicariously through the Alliance there.
---
Talk to your GL about this
---
Literally wait 2 weeks more, BGs are out and you can get all the honor you want. What the video shows is simply despicable.
---
Sending mass reports at someone not breaking the terms of service is a bannable offense. We had a player in our guild getting muted because he was advertising Devilsaur a few weeks back and accused of botting. In the end the people who reported him got temporarily banned.
---
I would like to invite you to still rethink your actions here. I am a Lionheart Helm crafter myself and had to buy the recipe for 1500 golds and 10 arcanite bars. Another player just got lucky and got the recipe in a PuG Onyxia. He decided to craft it for free, effectively ruining the market for me. People are free to do what they want with their profession and items, however it does not change the fact that it is an extremely selfish decision that has a minimal impact on the players who get it crafted and a massive impact on the players who bought the recipe.
---
What I am saying is that you are destroying the effort and investment of other people who had to farm gold and buy the recipe, just because you were lucky. In my opinion this is self promotion and seeking gratitude and attention. It is not an act of generosity or if it is, then please, again, rethink your actions.
---
Camp in the Inn, lol i went to winterspring and got killed by an alliance raid camping flight master. Ressed inside Everlook and ran to the Inn, got camped inside the Inn... Logged off while dead was the only thing i could do.
---
Massive, but pretty safe when you realize Blizz doesn't take the integrity of their report system seriously; they'd rather this all snowball into a huge problem at later date.
---
Yeah the problem is that I am a hardcore pve raider and there are zero hardcore pve server raiding guilds that fit my available raid time schedule
---
I mean I didn’t. This is my first experience with wow, classic or retail. So it’s pretty disappointing that my experience with wpvp in other games is incongruous with what’s happening here, in the game all my friends have chosen to play primarily. I was under the impression I was buying a track car. And then looked under the hood and it’s just a bunch of hamsters on wheels. Like I said, “sorry that’s life” is doing nothing which is the solution of choice of the players in control on almost every pvp server with heart seeker I think being the only exception.
---
Oh no an edgy straight boy on reddit talking tuff.
---
Whatever will we do? 😭
---
They literally have nothing better to do if they want to get honor (and if you don't get it, you won't get high rank). The situation is going to be better in 3 weeks after BG release.
---
It's honestly such a selfish opinion.  I can't do this 1 very specific thing, so you shouldn't be able to do anything at all.  When in reality they could do it anyway if they were actually good at the game.
---
This is what its like everywhere
---
What is that "quest turnin" between the 7, lyceum and MC?
---
I just hope it's FEB/March so i don't have to respecc twice a week before being done with rank 11-13.
---
\#nochangessssssss
---
I was very much against LC. And joined a guild who did roll +1 with reset before Domo. 
---
That turned out to be a bad choice. I have bin outrolled by our worst preforming player of the same class as me in every roll. He has bin so lucky. Always getting something before Domo and then after. 
---
He's still way behind the tanks on DPS, i honestly cant see why they even invite him. Must be IRL friends with some officer or something.
---
This always bothered me.
---
&gt; both tilt Alliance
---
So you have not problem exacerbating the problem when it's on your side. Got it.
---
In any group raid its part of the role. But as someone who grinded a bit of PVP it's getting tiresome to been whispered for water without even being offering any tips.
---
Tanking is mostly about DPS management. These are two phrases that might help
---
"It's been fifteen years since I've been in here. Can you give me a heads up if it looks like I'm forgetting something ?"
---
"I'm old fashioned. If the healer dies, it's my fault. If I die, it's the healer's fault. And if you DPS die, it's your own fault'.
---
If DPS does good, and by that I mean "makes your run easier", friend them and ask them to go on more dungeons. Good rogues and mages are worth their weight in Arcanite.
---
Maybe we are just happy with who we are, and don't need to escape reality
---
It's was my first epic mount and remained My mount as long as I wasn't riding, I loved that wolf.
---
I prefer open bid too. It's a surefire way to get what you want. Or if someone snags and item from you then at least the fact that they paid tons for it eases the pain a bit lol.
---
100%
---
Heck i'm not even allowed to roll on items because my raid attendance is 10/14.
---
I work third shift so mornings is when I play. It’s super annoying that every Tuesday and sometime wed or Thursday there’s maintenance. Most of the time it’s only down a half hour or so but still aggravating. 
---
But I do understand the reason upgrading stuff in the AM and not weekends n such.
---
Alliance: I cant play some parts of the game. As a result, players who pay the same money I do should be denied access, even if they won't be PVPing, based on their race.
---
Alliance confirmed for racist bastards, way to go.
---
you downvote and report for harrasment
---
Do you have a source for the herb spawns? We reliably get 2-5 herb nodes (gromsblood, dreamfoil, ghost mushroom in our runs). Never seen more on pservers.
---
Herbalism is the lowest ranking of the professions you want for DM:E. Mining &gt; enchanting &gt; herbalism.
---
I was not talking about the bad lasher farm, sorry for that, but I mentioned warrior, therefore I thought it was clear I meant jump runs. Bad habit I have.
---
We have customers before the run starts in DM:E. We tell them to do whatever, help us, stand back, just be in range of the boss once we kill him. Bow 15g, all other items 10g. Sometimes we have a group of 5, 3 standing next to the wall in the conservatory to be in ML range.
---
Lets see regarding time commitment: 30-45mins MC, 1,5min Onyxia (pure bossfight), 1,5hour BWL on a bad day. 2-3hours AQ40, 4-6hours Naxxramas.
---
10 hours farming consumables a week at 100g per hour. Possibly it's LC, so 150g+ classes may chip in on stuff to increase their loot standing by contribution.
---
Working bachelor? Can totally do it.
---
Family man with 2 kids and 1,5hour commute day who wants to satisfy his wife? Unlikely.
---
You can totally knock the farming requirements out on one weekend day recovering from hangover.
---
CHT has higher dmg, and you need the +5 in your mainhand as a daggers rogue.
---
Well it's a neccesary evil I guess, we need those transfers
---
Huh, yeah you are right. I always thought it was so it couldnt miss.
---
You're probably horde on skeram. Watch that alliance video that's on the front page that cannot be fun for both factions
---
I am also playing horde on a fairly balanced server please read before you post nobody is crying
---
Most PVP servers are 40/60 or better. If you think 45/55 is imbalanced, git gud.
---
This spells of sunken cost fallacy, or whatever else it's called. Doesn't matter if you bought the recipe or got it for free, you're still missing a massive opportunity by crafting it for free.
---
16 debuff slots. Deep wounds from crits is fine, rend is not.
---
Well, depends on whether you're planning to do some pvp. Afaik you'll need 5% hit in PvP so your offensive spells aren't going to miss.
---
I've seen so many mages/warlocks rolling on gear that only has +heal but no +spelldmg just because they don't even doublecheck before rolling that I honestly stopped caring about this a long time ago. If it is an improvement, I roll, except it was agreed otherwise beforehand.
---
Yuup. Still farming it. Haven't been lucky yet. It's a PITA to farm as a priest, too. I'm announcing it in the group and some people still get mad I roll on it. These days I mostly build groups without casters needing it.
---
2 and a half hours before they finally pushed and killed us after tons of attempts.
---
Great fun.
---
GDKP. Gold is bid on for each item, with rare and sought after items going for a lot of gold. All of this is given to the raid leader, which in turn, evenly distributes the gold from all of the bids to all of the members of the raid at the end of the run. Usually end up with 300-400 gold per raid night for each member. 
---
The richest members of the guild distribute their funds across the guild, and eventually get geared first, but they continue to raid after they are decked because there is gold incentive. 
---
It has its flaws but I believe it's the best system around, as long as you have a consistent group and a trustworthy raid leader.
---
Yes, outnumbered faction won't have even a chance in Silithus.
---
Can you post a link of your Talent Tree? Nice vid man, love the tunes too haha love that so many wow players are dnb heads
---
&gt; across all PVP
---
At least 6 PVP servers were Alliance dominated when I looked yesterday 
---
&gt; significant
---
Most PVP servers are 40/60 or better. Do you guys know what words mean?
---
Ehh. Not a shadow item. You want the Scholo or Anastari Heirloom neck. Shadows don't need spell hit.
---
It also sounds like the other guy put in alot more work
---
Rolling in guild runs is shitty tho so it was probably a trash guild anyways
---
Should leave if you feel like it
---
This sub is so bad and full of dad gamers, it's laughable at times.
---
I’ve been farming mats for pvp potions n stuff. Not making a killing but still steady. 
---
Stranglekelp, swiftthistle, lily blackmouths ect are all still selling on my server for 2-5g per stack and none of it is all that difficult to get. 
---
Biggest issue I had is the people undercutting the market in stupid ways. 
---
Yesterday saw like 8 people selling blackmouths for like 3g per stack. And then one dude was selling 10 stacks for like 30s a piece. So dumb. If you sell it that low it’s not worth the time to get it. Trolls imo.
---
No obviously not. But if you had some reading comprehension you'd realise that he made 2 points in his post.
---
1. The servers are gonna shit themselves because having 6k people in 1 zone is gonna destroy Azeroth worse than Sargeras blade.
---
2. 1500 Alliance VS 4500 Horde isnt going to be playable for Alliance, in any way at all.
---
I just did that literally minutes ago. It took 3 deaths to get out of Morgans Vigil and then I've found a path that no horde takes and can reach the ramp. From there it was straight up to the door (normally a 3 death charge run) and if timed correctly I can usually make it to parachute cloak/nifty stopwatch jump in a death but this time it took 2. From there I die in the lava and res. I was able to make it to overseer pyron in 1 death and inside in another. So a 7 death run into BRD. That is like pre phase 2 runs!!!
---
Same, I love pvp, loved arenas and battlegrounds, but the shit show that is world pvp is just irritating.
---
They won't leave until blizzard introduces faction queues. I'm not about to sit a 2 hr+ queue just to not be able to run any instances or farm anything in the world without dying for 30 minutes to the instance.
---
 It sounds as if you're putting in a lot of effort and thought for this; that's encouraging, since there are lots of things to do in order to establish a guild with decent people and a healthy attitude. Commens in *italics.*
---
**Attendance**
---
My plan is to have the expectation that you raid every Monday, and if you cannot attend you notify an officer so that somebody riding the bench for their class can be notified to attend. Ony Wed are less of a concern. How does your guild manage attendance? *As has been covered by others, Monday might not be a great day for MC due to how close it is to the reset. That said, the guild I am in has some variation to the raid days, but it's working OK thus far - I do think set days are better though. Wed/Sun seem to be the main raid days, consider swapping Mon for Sun or swapping around the raids so you head to MC on Wed. Since you're short on douses, you could potentially do Ony+Domo/Rag on Sun, could you not? IIRC anyone who has progressed far enough to get douses can run back to Azshara for a replacement douse, and a Rogue/Druid could even do this during the days inbetween Wed-Sun in that case, or everyone just restocks douses. Pardon me if I got this wrong, I'm yet to pick up the Hands for this week.*
---
**Loot**
---
 this must be **transparent and equitable** to all raiders. What loot system do you use, and do you consider it transparent and equitable? *Your bolds highlight the most important parts here. As was mentioned by a previous user, LC can work great but it may open up a can of worms if people feel side-tracked. Myself, I hate randomness as it doesn't really award activity in any way, and I would choose to steer clear of roll-based systems. Our guild uses DKP (dragon killing points, very old school) where you get an on-time DKP bonus as well as hourly DKP in raids and DKP per boss kill - and if you've signed up for a raid and either arrive late without notifying officers or you don't show up, you get -DKP. DKP is then used to bid on items you want, with every item type (armor of any sort / weapon / jewellery+trinkets) having minimum starting DKP values. People who need an item for MS get priority, if no one needs for MS then OS people may start bidding from ½ of the item's minimum DKP value. The one drawback is that some people might hoard DKP and save it up for 1-2 specific pieces, and bidding against them will be next to impossible or very costly if they are topping the list - but I think it's one of the most fair systems, and it fits my gaming philosophy.* 
---
**Legendaries**
---
We currently have three Officers, 2 Main Tanks and a Rogue, who most appropriately qualify for TF. For Sulfuras, we have a ret pally and fury warriors who would qualify. The GM is a holy pally btw. Who did your guild assign bindings and Eye of Rag to? *Legendary items are an exception to the above; these should be handed out (DKP applies) to the most active, solid and dependable people. TF should go to MT &gt; OT &gt; others, never give your first TF to anyone else than MT. I'd argue that Sulfuras is wasted on a Ret paladin, as warriors should out-perform them in any case - but I play on Horde so that's a decision I would not have to take. I know many Horde guilds give their (first) Sulfuras to Enh shamans though, so go figure.*
---
**Professions**
---
I'm planning to assign profession masters for Leatherworking and Blacksmithing. They will be responsible for being an active player and open resource to players who need items crafted. Their crafting will be supplemented and reimbursed by the guild bank. I will be expecting them to work towards exalted with Thorium Brotherhood and the guild bank will assist in this venture. What does your guild do for what professions? *Our main LW/BS/Tailor/Enchanter are all long-term and well known people in the guild who have been 300/300 for a long time, and these have priority on recipe drops. I'm actually not sure if they've gotten much help other than that, since when I joined they were all already maxed. Giving recipes to people like that seems like a no-brainer, though, rather than a freshly joined member with 283/300.* 
---
**Guild Bank**
---
What gear/materials do you prioritize? What do you prioritize Ony scales/core leather/other raid drops for? Ony scales should be saved for Ony scale cloaks, otherwise most items are just going to the guild bank atm. 
---
**Officers/Leads**
---
*Sounds like a good system; we're having class leaders, some few officers and the guild leader. Most of the time the class leaders are the ones dealing out tank/heal assignments and such for different fights, which makes sense, but we also have guild-specific chat channels for the different roles where assignments can be discussed on an encounter-to-encounter basis. Just try to make sure the class leaders are actually knowledgeable and on top of their game, and people who will stick around.*
---
&gt; everyone rerolling to escape the sub 30 percent ally concentration camp servers has had to lose all their progress
---
Actually most of them had the opportunity to take free server transfers.  They just decided not to, and are now trying to suggest locking horde out of the game because they're selfish.
---
Check DM entrance at your server? I expect it to be slightly lesser shitfest than BRM and it allows you to level just fine along with steady income and resources.
---
Shame, yours was one of the few girls only guilds remaining in pvp servers.. big loss
---
It seems like one guy is trying to screw over the other.
---
We play on 1.12 - so I would guess yes
---
Most enemies in MC don't bleed anyway. For bosses, it takes a debuff slot - but gets overwritten by stronger debuffs. 
---
Long story short, don't use rend and don't worry about your crits. And for purely raiding, respecc and invest the points somewhere else
---
The report function is quite curious.
---
My brother has been trying to change his warrior's name by asking people to report him. I've done that several times. Dozens of reports.  Nothing so far.
---
It took me 10 minutes after rolling Dildobaggins to be reported and ended up having to change my name. 
---
The other day I rolled a new toon on Golemagg only to be harassed in Barrens by this asshole priest who kept fearing my mobs in an attempt to get me killed. Reported him several times. Nothing. Was so frustrated I ended up deleting the toon and running back to my original server. 
---
In the end, I don't, it's just luck I suppose?
---
crafting 0 charge is bm to other crafters
---
Noone cares about crushing blows anymore... almost every war tank is dw fury and competing with dps wars for gear, claiming that its better because of "muh aggro issues...".
---
What if you are a frost mage, you telling me you cant defrost the blood later?
---
It's like that on most of the pvp realms, on Earthshaker EU (one of the newer realms) you get  ganked wherever you turn as alliance.
---
Get 12 or 14 slots ASAP, wait with larger bags if you are saving for mount. 
---
You'll have to either visit vendors more often or throw away vendor trash (which is just another form of gold) if you're waiting with getting bags. It's a great investment and should me made sooner rather than later.
---
I’m a mage and I would not charge group members for water to be used in the group setting.
---
If you're low on bag space and have the money, there's no reason to wait - you'll always need them and 6 or 8 slots are pretty cheap, so you can't really go wrong
---
I never said that, just that 200 crafts isnt unlikely
---
also what/who is sb?
---
How did you even manage to say something that completely wrong?
---
This is why DKP is best done together with preestablished rules for class prio
---
Honestly it wasn't even an issue. He didn't say anything about it, he didn't bitch or moan, he didn't ask for reroll, everyone had the chance to read the "all need" text, ample opportunity. Perhaps he didn't care, it was an alt? Nfi. However, he didn't kick up a fuss so we continued on and finished the instance. All good, no salt
---
Ahh yeah, it was updated when I came home yesterday. Thank you
---
Yep. If I have to spirit regen as a healer inbetween pulls, let the mage explain why the run is going so slow! Can't believe players who would not hand out conjured water to their group exists. Must be a minuscule fraction.
---
Writing it like this doesn't change the fact that its the truth :)
---
They are farming honot, treating you like regular mobs.
---
thanks for that I am on bloodfang and I was always wondering what the faction balance is - always felt kinda balanced  - glad I switched there months ago when the qs on other servers were unbearable
---
Ha ha hopefully
---
No I would suggest this for any pull in any 5 man dungeon. The better your arms/pvp gear is the better. In 5 mans I can easily hold aggro on 3-4 mobs while a mage does a full aoe rotation. The key is to hold rage for the next pull because you cant always charge in.
---
I mean the only thing I remember from vanilla AQ opening is the server crashing
---
It’s funny, I imagine all the people who just instantly say go to a pve server are the ones who camp lv 20’s for 6 hours n brag about how sick they are at pvp. Lol. 
---
The post clearly wasn’t complaining about playing on a pve server, just a solution to an issue with buffs.
---
In a open non regulated world without BGs I think 40/60 ratio is damaging. Luckily, we are getting BGs soon, which hopefully will lead to HKs farmers staying in city’s and queuing for BGs. This will hopefully lead to less pressure in the zones and thereby making it possible to play again.
---
Funny enough I am horde on a PvP server not interested in PvP but with the BG rep rewards I will still end up doing them until exalted likely.  Its just another grind for gear and I imagine PvE server players even if they don't like PvP will feel similarly(and AV might just be PvE anyways).
---
It's an add-on. It's really bad for the game....
---
This. 90% of the community on r/classicwow are braindead fucks who dont know it.
---
When you go into stealth, this shows up in the combat log.
---
    Hatepirate14 casts Stealth.
---
This also contains the location information, to where your character did this.
---
So, there's an addon, called Spy, that presents this information in a nice format to other players.
---
..ive never actually seen a mage charge for water before, especially in a group on my server
---
We cleared MC in 1:30 yesterday, with PvP builds. Our record is 1:02 or something, so having to spend 28 minutes and saving literally hundreds of gold on respecs was definitely worth it.
---
This way, the trivial\easy content is literally a side thing you don't even have to respec for. MC really is that easy.
---
Every top guild is Alliance
---
Also on Fairbanks, it's impossible at all times. I've tried at literally all times of day :(
---
The combat log recognizes a player is stealthed
---
" When fighting angry, blind men, best to just stay out of the way. " \~Mr. Han
---
Razorgore EU, I'm 58 on Alliance side. Alliance honestly doesn't seem too bad, just a bit less organised it seems? Horde tend to flee when an Alliance group stomps them, then they crawl back to kill lowbies at the Plaguelands quest hubs.
---
BRD seems to be an even split, some days Alliance dominate then Horde dominate... It feels way better like this, it's great to be chased by a few horde only to have the cavalry appear of nowhere like saviours.
---
To be on a seriously unbalanced server just be so painful
---
Drop HS and cleave from your rotation.
---
Use Shield Block-&gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; Demo
---
Spam taunt vs grouped enemies or save the cd vs 1 or 2 enemies that you have established threat.
---
Other than that, damage dealers should up their game, not you.
---
For example, a horde mage:
---
Class buffs:
---
- Arcane intellect
---
- Fortitude
---
- Mark of the Wild
---
- Blood Pact
---
- Mage Armor
---
- Mana Tide Totem/Fire Resistance Totem
---

---
- Shadow Protection
---
- Healing Way (shammy talent applied by healing wave)
---
- Ancestral healing (shammy talent that procs on crit)
---
- Regrowth
---
- Rejuvination
---
- Ice Barrier
---
- Fire Ward
---
- Power Word Shield
---
- Clear casting
---
- Arcane resilience
---
Consumables:
---
- Nightfin Soup
---
- Rumsey Rum Black Label
---
- Cerebral Cortex Compound
---

---
- Mageblood Potion
---
- Greater Fire/Frost/Nature/Shadow/Arcane Protection Potion
---
- Brilliant Wizard Oil
---

---
- Spirit of Zanza
---

---
Assorted World Buffs 
---
- Warchief's blessing
---
- Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer
---
- Mol'Dar's Moxie (15% stam)
---
- Slip'Kik's Saavy (3% spell crit)
---
- Songflower Serenade (5% all crit, 15 all stats)
---
There's also item effects such as from trinket activations
---
Mind you that's already well over 32 buffs that will all be competing for your slots and although many are not permanent, they still take slots none-the-less.
---
Then you have a *lot* of equip effects and talents that count toward that cap even though they don't show on your buff bar.
---
Chances are, even if you don't personally use tribute buffs or flasks, you're still far closer to the cap than you realize.
---
And even if you don't personally care about the world buffs and expensive consumables because you don't see the point in bothering for MC, there are many people who *will* want them for pushing Naxx as soon as it comes out or for seeing how high they can parse after they've already gotten all their best gear.
---
That will not happen , when ppl have 20+ waiting times they will still go wpvp between
---
Loot whoring is part of the fun.
---
Part of the game, get better
---
Whirlwind
---
Dude who cares thats just a mage and you are a healer, if you have any problem just tell it to the gm your word as a healer worth a lot more than a dps' word. If thats not helps just find another guild, wont be hard as a healer.
---
Note that emperor will have a much higher drop chance for HoJ, and a lava run doesn't take long at all.
---
then its just bad luck
---
Also love the "im playing at my own pace. Took me 6 weeks to reach level 14. But here's a Screenshot of some random shore because this game is so beautiful!!1!".
---
prot tree is painful for leveling. follow the icy veins arms leveling guide. 
---
you have to spend 17 points in the prot tree before you get a big boost out of it, whereas there just aren't any wasted points in the normal arms leveling progression.
---
There is definitely far more alliance in ZT
---
NOCHANGES !
---
back in the days, the zoen was indeed super laggy :D
---
I threat reservations as information about whats some1 is after. For example, ive been farming truestrike shoulders as i still dont have them but i was lucky enough to get the 1h axe from Ony. Therefore i would be happy to join a party like yours. There is nothing wrong in parties like these. I dont mind parties like Strat living where there is a really well geared tank that reserves 1 or 2 orbs for himself. I mean he doesnt get anything from the dungeon so its legit to reserve an orb or two.  
---
If you put the time to make the group, have the key and make sure there is Jed up then i think you did a lot already and just announce to evryone what youre after. Its not like you reserve TS shoulders, both dalrends, carpace, fel strike and other shit just for yourself. Just the one item and i think you deserve it!  
---
On the other hand you have parties where evrything is reserved and you cant get shit. Like those strat UD i saw reserving mount, cape, sword. Basically all the items that a dps would need and LFM mele dps... like wtf why would anyone go with you if he wont win anything lol.
---
This is why Loot Councils are bulls\*it compared to every other system. In councils, leaders can always make up new bs stories and excuses for why to not give you any specific item. Even when they claim to be "fully transparent", which in reality just means they explain their decisions in a few short words on discord, irrelevant of wether the raid agrees with or even understands their reasoning.
---
Just find a guild that either rolls everything (with +1 and/or MS&gt;OS and optionally prioritizing or excluding specific members on specific drops) or one that uses some form of DKP, everything else is just petty and always ends in drama and greedy corrupted officers.
---
Yes you are.
---
I don't want classic's economy and player base to die off after Naxx has been out for over 8 months, that's the weakest point of any of the expansions, the moment a new content bracket comes out it breathes life into the game again. I'd be happier though if they kept some dedicated level 60 realms for people who wanted to just play classic again or for people who come to the party late, a few realms purely for classic whilst the original ones move on to TBC would be the best solution, and allowing you to transfer your character to one of the only classic realms so people can't complain about their character's items becoming useless.
---
So much jelly horde downvoting here, because they dont have the best pvp healer and his OP buffs
---
A good spot is probably somewhere in the quarry.
---
Maybe you can add to shield bash (not slam) a target now and then if there are no caster mobs in the pulled group. also generates a decent amount of threat.
---
Raptor heads was 100% for me on 3 or 4 characters, it does not belong here
---
If you spend some time in this sub you will find out many do. But as always, some are against it, and some are for it. As long as Blizzard does not ban it, people will use it to their advantage
---
Honestly many player will be a-ok with that. Myself included.
---
If the premades have their partys in battlegrounds and stop raidganking small groups or individual players thus making questing and moving around in the world possible again it is a huge improvement.
---
I believe 12 and 14 bags only cost around 1 to 3 gold each so they're going to always be great. They're not BoE so when you replace them they can go inti your bank bag slots or a alt/bank alt for space there. 16 slot bags are around 19g on my server and 18 slot bags are 295g each. You would probably save time and money with the extra slots. You'll be able to vendor more things and make back a couple gold quickly.
---
Though it's worth it just to have that larger inv and feel better overall.
---
Battlegrounds were implemented just a little over half a year after the game launched.
---
Nice brag
---
same :)

People can just afk out.

Your LFG text is the colour of Guild Chat...this makes me sad
---
YoU rEaLlY dOn'T
---
People don't know what they hell they want if they think they wanted spell batching...
---
from my perspective without degradation is not good.  
---
People just hoarding DKP, untill the item they want drops and they start bidding, like everybody else.
---
This will result in people not have good upgrades and therefore the total raids suffers from this.
---
Now its not that meaningfull, but wait for BWL and AQ
---
They should have never gated all that stuff behind month long phases anyways. I can barely see a point in them gating BWL onward, but stuff like Honor, BGs and the keyring? Sure...
---
A launch with the honor system already in place would have made for a leveling experience much closer to actual vanilla WoW than what we actually had. PVP servers were basically PVE servers because no one ever attacked each other because everyone must get to 60 as fast as possible and if that means sharing spawns with the enemy faction, then so be it.
---
Try getting 24h bans from time to time cause your previous GM is mad at you for leaving the guild. He keeps spam reporting my characters for bad names, usually starts with a whisper "Hello and good bye". 10-15mins later I'm 24h banned and forced to change name. 
---
This wouldn't be too much of an issue if I didn't have so damn many alts and decided to join the guild on all of them. As soon as I log onto one of them I get banned swiftly, recently I lost my name "Bob" and had to change. On the bright side I get free name changes I guess..
---
bc southshore is garbage honor. nobody with a working brain goes there.
---
&gt;1 Release the faction horde vs alliance stats per server  
---
&gt;2Add faction queues  
---
&gt;3Allow the dominating factions the ability to move to the opposing faction.
---
1, would be nice  
---
2. maybe  
---
3. HELL NO !
---
Also not entirely true. Priests are a certain kind of savage at 19, and if a rogue finds you at 19... warrior charge can be tough to escape as well.
---
Wow this must be a lot of salty ass lionheart crafters getting their guilds to report him.  100% should be bannable to mass report for no reason.
---
Hm who could thought bout that on a PvP server
---
I've let my sub lapse until BGs come out, Blizz have lost 2 months out of me now maybe even a third by the time it comes out. I imagine potentially millions of other people have done the same. Last time I logged on there were 9 people on in my guild of 500.
---
Hordes on my server are yelling 'n i g g a'
---
Just like the dude that spent his night ganking lowbies in a lvl60 raid and then comes to reddit to say "YoU rOlLeD pVp NoOb"
---
I think it may be longer than that in the version we will get, but not sure.
---
Either way it is not that different. You can farm money for an epic mount in 1 to 2 weeks. I think AV mount takes longer than that. And it is useful to have a 100% mount for AV.
---
Yeah. We just use a DKP system. Go to raids, earn points. Loot drops, spend them. Really nice item? Spend a lot of them and someone else gets the next few minor upgrades cause you have no more points.
---
Like all systems it's only as good as the people using it but it's very fair. I outbid the GM of my guild for Bloodfang pants last night by one point. I got the item, because those are the rules.
---
Also OP isn't using 40 accounts (yet) and he can opt to pay for 3+ months for the slight discount. I also assume whoever can even afford the set up to multi-box probably has a lot more in disposable income than $600usd a month anyway. Or I dunno, use gold.
---
Pirt if thi gimi git bittir
---
Enhance here. People want you to do mostly one thing. Drop those totems. Unless you get some insane 2 hander your dps wont be as good as other melees but you make the raid stronger.
---
Yeah and honor was released after 9 months not 3...
---
Fireball. Although I have been at Azuregos as mage and our task was always to cast blizzard on the horde raids trying to wipe us.
---
I’m a lvl 52 holy priest with ok gear, can I heal BRD yet? If so could I manage a full run? Don’t want to waste anyone’s time by saying I can go then we wipe loads
---
I wouldn't bother with the vendor bags, at least on my server they're way cheaper off the AH.
---
If you can afford bigger bags then I'd say go for it, you'll buy them anyway in the future so technically it will save you money if you buy them now
---
It could be a 5 min cd for all I care. It's about the abuse.
---
&gt; this website looks at raid logs
---
So it's highly inaccurate 
---
&gt; which I'm pretty sure doesnt work
---
It works just fine. It had to be re-worked because Blizzard made some changes. The difference is that it sends who requests on in game clicks, instead of spamming the fuck out of them. The data collected is largely the same, save the fact that it has to be collected over a slightly longer period of time (a few minutes). 
---
&gt; alliance has the numbers advantage
---
Alliance has more overall characters. Alliance has PVP servers where they dominate. Most PVP servers are 40/60 or better. Alliance is not at some gross numbers disadvantage, that's for sure
---
I like to always start with a demo shout so i make sure i get a bit of initial threat on all of them. Its also not a bad idea to charge in and use thunder clap before switching to Defensive stance. 
---
Then u can start appyling sunders
---
I dont see a money problem, I see a time problem
---
I swear you guys are all on the spectrum. It's a video game you clown.
---
Blues dropping out MC that are equivalent or better than MC drops shaved way more time off the timeline than anything else.  Only reason some of our mages/warlocks even take tier gear is for PvP.
---
Yep, this - 100% the correct solution.
---
I don't want Classic to die off either, I want Classic Plus.  But knowing Blizzard they just want the easy money and they'll go the TBC path.
---
Only have queues on prime time, and its 10min tops. A full and alive server.
---
Dont come to Gandling, its perfect as it is.

---
Theres vastly more PvP realms than Normal realms plus PvP realms have much larger populations. There being more alliance on Normal realms will only alleviate horde queues moderately.
---
Alliance: it's so unfair these Horde just gank us!  
---
Also Alliance: it's fun gank low levels!
---
You guys cant have your cake and eat it to.
---
low pop servers should be pooled into cross server, not those with high population
---
That's the most neckbeard thing I've seen today
---
Did you get really unlucky or is it just rarer then I thought?
---
Yeh that's a nice weapon, but to be properly setup we still need an item that increases the relevant weapon skill, such as Edgemasters Handguards. Just makes the gearing process a bit more frustrating.
---
I enjoy playing my NE warrior, but it's definitely not as straightforward to gear as a human warrior.
---
Haha, yeah, still took a good 20 minutes to get into BRD as alliance yesterday. But I have little reason to complain compared to people from other servers...
---
I'm on Grobbulus, which is pretty damn close to 50/50, maybe even slight Alliance advantage, and it's still like this trying to get into anything as Ally. It's actually impossible to do anything outside of an instance right now.
---
I've made around 70 Dire Maul runs for the Foror's compendium and it never dropped for me. I know every dusty tome location, and always made sure to kill every boss. At some point a guildmate, mostly a casual player, dropped it in its fifth or so run. That was it for me.  I've made a ton of gold during these run and ended up buying the book for 2k3 gold out of frustration, an absolute pain but I just CAN'T run this instance anymore. 
---
In an ironic twist of fate, one of the Windseeker's bindings dropped for me in our MC run yesterday, so luck comes around I guess...
---
You aren't "less cool" in any aspect. PVE servers are just the same part of the game as PVP servers, there is nothing shameful in playing there.
---
Short answer, Yes.
---
Longer answer, still Yes. Which is why you really don't want to join a guild that uses Rolls or Loot Council for their loot system, they're very prone to drama popping up, and just a prime indicator for laziness on the guild leaders part. Sure, some might argue that you've been fine so far with LC, Rolls, or +1s. If you're lucky enough to be in that sort of a guild that is, or the drama just hasn't popped up, yet.
---
Which is why EP/GP or heck, even DKP is much better suited for any sort of long term guild that actually cares about their members.
---
Oof.
---
[Blizzard confirmed cross realm before release](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=750)
---
If step 3 wasn't in place, it would be possible to artificially skew the balance calculation by creating characters on every PvP realm you don't play on. If you were the majority faction, this would help you by allowing more of your faction to log on before getting queued.
---
Plus there's the additional 20 levels they have to go through because epic mounts are 60.
---
Bah, wish I was on a pve server as well. But no friends wanted to be on pvp because "trust me bro, its not like everyone is gonna try and kill you"
---
By transmuting? 
---
My server it's only around 5-10g for an Arcanite Bar transmute and that's every two days
---
Alliance. I think Gehennas is pretty horde favored but I can't find any hard numbers .
---
My guild seems to be avg 25yo+ and the last 2 weeks we seem to have got rid of all the loot drama. First few guild only raids were pretty horrible when talking about the loot. Just gotta find the likeminded people and that can take time.
---
My guess would be the fabled keyring patch will include a large number of bug fixes.
---
At least that is my hope.

You know full well there is, it's posted about here 50x a day.

Yeah you're right mate people on pve servers don't do pve.

i, for one, appreciate the reference. 
---
can't believe the comments here  turned into just another place to whine about pvp.
---
TBF, the fact that your tank cant keep his shit repaired isn't really the Hunter's fault.
---
In fact its entirely not the Hunter's fault. There's 3 other people in the group who also cant take blame.
---
Can you guess who they should be mad at?
---
In raid it's pretty bad. Elemental just goes oom top fast and enhance just doesn't do that much damage and if you get 'lucky' with early WF crits you just die to pulling aggro.
---
In dungeons elemental is quite good if you get the time to drink to full between packs. Most random groups will allow this, but depending on your guild they might want to go faster which leaves you drinking every other pack that they are fighting. Enhance is ok in dungeons just because shamans have very high utility with their totems.
---

I dont have any issue with him personally. Its just cringey and pathetic to run around in a Guild being a fan boy, kneeling down for invites etc. 
---
Asmongold plays somewhat of a character and is technically out there working and I can’t help but respect him somewhat, he has success with what he does, and his hustle is working.
---
The people glorifying him, licking his ball for invites and giving him special treatment because of his name are pathetic. And i wanna ask every single member of the guild if they hate themself or what the issue is.
---
Everyone will have zg fishing trinket negating the necessity of tier 3 set bonus though.

Fits in perfectly for the types that play WoW

Thats fairly easy. If you just tap to the window with the bomb and runs out.
---
Do "spell hit chance" make harder to break a cc?
---
Lmao shut up loser
---
If you want to play while dead, I suggest pre-ordering Shadowlands and going back to retail.
---
PVE server isn't about being casual, PVE server is about having a choice. At least more choice than PVP servers offer.
---
Loot Council basically killed our guild because it was done badly. We started out just rolling for stuff and if you won something you'd pass until the others got something useful as well (we kept a list of who got what).
---
Then the "better" classes started complaining that "bad" classes got loot and healing leather would now go to every single shaman before any druid was allowed to roll on it (because that was "better" for the overall raid performance), etc. So now all the "bad" classes were pissed.
---
Then a bunch of people who are basically unemployed and just play WoW all day felt like the people who would "only" play 2-3 hours each on 5 days every week weren't putting the same amount of effort into their characters and therefore didn't deserve the same amount of loot. So now loot would be distributed based on "activity", i.e. if you have a job you don't get any loot before the no-lifers are decked out.
---
Didn't last long after that.
---
Its better that NPC breaks it down to you before your dungeon group does that. You retridin you!

Mage AoE grind was good, profitable and most importantly POSSIBLE in the first couple of weeks. After that everyone saw all the reddit/forum/Youtube posts. Now every spot is overrun because everyone saw a 3 minute clip and thought "I can spam Blizzard too!". It's not the most complicated thing to do, but you still need to know what to do. That's why most of the times you see people failing and dying at those spots now.

---
I thought you are clear from Spy as long as you don't have any buffs?
---
Is paying attention so hard? 🤔🥴🥴
---
DKP is also asking for bad behavior and drama. It really isn't that better over just rolling.
---
If the enemy faction can keep you from the loot, did you really win it?
---
Ban them all
---
This is mafia type shit and should not be allowed

---
The idea is that you should actually never have to sit in a queue if you really don't want to because a server transfer should always be available to you. And, given what servers would be available for you to move to, transferring would lessen your chance of ever having to queue again.
---
No solution to the imbalance problem (if you agree that there is one) is going to be painless, but it appears to me to be necessary for the health of the game.
---
Think there is a rare grey lion in the barrens some where
---
You don't need consumables to clear it, but the people who play 16 hours every day will use consumables and will try to bully the people who play 2 hours every day into using them as well.
---
125g isn't too bad.  For a long time on my server it was a 400g fee.  Then 3 more people got it the next two weeks and its 100g thanks to competition.
---
Nah you could easily ress outside the walls, run away and maybe die one more time then safely hearthstone and look for a dungeon group for LBRS/Scholo/Strat. Yes you would die on the way there but its not impossible.
---
Its not cheating as it only gives you information what the game tells you in combat log. 
---
However it is bad addon for the game as it makes receiving this information way too easy. Spy is borderline mandatory for world pvp and should be banned.
---
Still not cheating though.
---
Apart from Flying. Fuck Flying.

I still feel bad abot winning that roll
---
Warriors will always get tagged since they have stances. Rogues are the ones that usually don't come up (if they have no poisons applied).
---
Op even mention that he misses a raid and the guy got 4 pieces..either super lucky or it wasn't only one raid that OP missed. It's frustrating when people join a guild, expect to be carried to loot when they decide to show up. MC is super easy but that doesn't mean other people should spend their time to compensate for someone not even making an effort to gear up.
---
I was upset week one that this was phase 4 content.  I couldn't believe it.  Why are we denied fishing?!

They where implemented on 1.12 which is the patch used for itemization and balance.

Fucking sigh. Unless things changed from yesterday there are SIX Ally dominated PVP realms (you know, the ones where Horde dominate Alliance 100:1 on all servers), and most of the PVP servers are pretty balanced (40/60 or better). In fact, Ally has two grossly dominated PVP servers to Horde's one.
---
But since you're literally an idiot, please dont bother replying.

0/10

Which is still a million times better then Retail AV.

blizzard themself stated its somewere in that range

its definatly way below 10k

Me rn. I finally hopped back into Deviate Delight after a few rough weeks.
---
Goodness me, the game can change a lot within a month. My guild's great though, they help me plenty.
---
This is not an LC problem. This is a people problem.
---
I hate DKP because it hugely favors some classes and causes good gear to get dusted for no reason.
---
LC is fine if you have a good, mature guild. In the end what matters is can your guild kill Vael when BWL comes out. 
---
The game has WAY too much drama over loot anyway. Its irrelevant pixels that will be replaced with other irrelevant pixels in 3 months at most.
---
That's what they did to retail and everybody LOVES questing there, right? :)
---
Well everyone knew that mages are the smartest mosst skilled persons ever. There are certain "skill" you have to posses to be able to play as a mage or rog.
---
Sounds like your guild got a **SHITTY** loot distribution system with no structure and weak set of rules.
---
How many pvp servers are there compared to non-pvp?
---
For sure if you will go Ragnaros. Some guild even ask for it on the trashes behind Garr.

What an absolute terrible way to solver faction imbalance. Wpvp and queue dodging are awful things on imbalanced serversThink about what your saying.

It's not really a imbalance problem it's a sheer amount of people  (about 1.000% more in classic compared to vanilla )  problem.
---
It will help on Ragnaros and Baron Geddon.

You could stockpile cheaper Fire Resistance potions, instead of Greater ones.

Yea walls and running mobs seem fucked up. I had one run through a wall, aggro another mob, and then BOTH of them ran back through the wall.

I don't have enough mana.

It's just +5 gold at every reset, with a cap of 50 gold.  
---
And it decay every 30 days for 5 gold, with minimum of 10.
---
Except flying. I agree that everything was better... Except flying. It's literally the reason why wow slowly turned to shit. The world was much more empty after a couple weeks when everyone got their flying mounts. It was cool back then but now we know that the negatives of flying mounts far outweigh the positives.
---
Blizzard acknowledges this by the way. They said around WoD that flying mounts were a mistake which they would love to remove. But they can't, since people will be angry if they can't use their hard-earned flying mounts in the next expansion.
---
I'll be really disappointed if they do bc with flying mounts. It's easily possible to make bc without it, barely needs any adjustments. Someone suggested temporary flying mounts to get into areas that aren't designed for ground mounts, but there's plenty of other ideas. Everything is better than the game being ruined.

Oh I see. The whole problem with the WPVP situation is that they cant count!

Lmao at the people who believe most pvp servers are even 40/60. I would kill for 40/60. Why the fuck do you think they don’t allow transfers for alliance players on most major servers? It ain’t cuss it’s “40/60 oR bEtTeR”
---
Yeah I love running dungeons with elemental shamans. They always pop off on damage and are friendly as fk.
---
Don’t have much love for enhancement tho. While they do have some utility, they do 0 damage and share a lot of BiS with other melees.

Except for AV horde was clearly the better side PVP wise in vanilla.

This is not a pserver bud.

Sometimes we enjoy some light hearted faction rivalry.

You cant trade soulbound items at all in classic, regardless of being in an instance or not. That was added way later (cata?) Only BoE items can be traded and those can always be traded as long as they are not equipped by someone.
---
Everyone who submitted a false report should get a permanent ban. I dont want to play with these filth.
---
The gameplay is just different at every bracket, different classes open up by getting skills/spells/gear that others don't, some classes drop of at some brackets and such.
---
Historically it wasn't about who raised most. Druids for example, generally an underplayed class so they always got their gear for lowest possible price meaning they often had a lot more dkp than people that raided the same or even more in some cases. 
---
Key to winning in a dkp system is to never bid on tier items a long as you need anything else as tier drops are set per clear. So they will inevitably come again with a lot more reliable intervals then say eye of sulferon or askhandi. This means underrepresented classes normally have more dkp to spare than say warriors and rogues that each raid has 10 each of. 
---
My point is they don't need to play more, their class just give them more disposable dkp to use.
---
Every raid/guild run that isn't exclusively MS&gt;OS roll is just an excuse to gear the friends of the master looter.  
---
I'm not saying this is necessarily A Bad Thing, but this is the reality.  MS&gt;OS is the only truly Fair way to distribute gear. It is doubly hilarious for tanks trying to gear up in  guild. The practice of funneling all the tank gear to one or two players is ridiculous and just shows how incompetent any Guild that does this is.
---
Anyways, I'm going off on a tangent.. just don't run with those idiots.
---
Arena/Angerforge/Golem - definitely yes.

Full run - almost on the edge of no. Emperor hit like a truck.

100% no if group decided to keep Princess alive.

Idiots like you are bad for the game. Enjoy your crutch ♿
---
No. Let unique gear have unique looks.
---
oooo.. you're hard
---
Guild leader should've set loot rules. If he did the guy had no reason to whine and guild leader had no reason to change.
---
I was surprised to only have a 800ish queue last night at 17.30 for Gehennas. Where last week it would have been around at least 2k.
---
Its for deciding who didnt loot the Corehound isnt it?
---
You shouldn't care about loot.
---
The whole point of Classic isn't about raiding in my opinion, and if you give it too much importance, you'll be bitter.
---
I'm playing 99% PvP 1% PvE (to get gear I need) but I really don't care if I don't loot what I wanted - I'd rather have fun in PvP than feeling miserable farming a dungeons / raids to get that +4 stam +4 strength upgrade - it will certainly not change my life, while my attitude toward loots will.
---
No flag no logo, a true patriot
---
Can’t read scum talk
---
Same
---
Depends on if you live in the US or EU.
---
You can use them when you have built enough threat and sunder stacks already, or when you are tanking a secondary target.
---
Dragons call ger is pretty ok
---
This is like a green text in the form of a normal reddit post
---
It was the other way around, lower pop faction gets instant queues while the other has to wait for an hour. That is, until crossrealm BGs came into play.
---
*Get off a PVP server
---
*Get off Classic WoW 
---
FTF all you twinkie retail snowflakes
---
Moving unit frames requires less work to look at bluffs. Using any addons requires less work. 
---
All addons are now banned, git gud scrubette.
---
On a serious note, that spy mod seems pretty OP
---
Sounds implausible.. Hordes always travel in packs of 10 and never EVER engage in 1v1.
---
It is almost like people tried to warn everyone about this before classic started!
---
Those numbers only apply to people who got at least 15 HKs fwiw
---
Great, thanks!
---
Sure just stop playing there and make a new character , that's what I do when I get camped , just go for an alt
---
Looks to me like that person will just up and quit to another guild once he has all the stuff he wants.
---
Why show up when you dont need anything....
---
Sick reference bro, your references are out of control.
---
I rerolled PvE (Mirage) ,or, rather, began leveling and alt to see if transfers will be available. Never played on a PvE server before, but looking at the shitfest that the PvP servers are, I enjoy it so much (also horde now instead of alliance to get a change of rhythm).
---
Here's the table:
---
||Alliance |Horde|Total|Alliance %|Horde %|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
| **Total Normal**| 390027| 224463| **614490**|63%|37%|
---
| **Total PvP**| 607463| 795591| **1403054**|43%|57%|
---
| **Total RP+RPPVP**| 111006| 78438| **189444**|59%|41%|
---
| **Total**| 1108496| 1098492| **2206988**|50%|50%|
---
Total alliance across all servers is 1,108,496.
---
Total horde across all server is 1,098,492.
---
In fact there's actually almost 1% more total alliance than horde.
---
Seriously, why do people roll on PvP servers? To be "badass"? The disrupt to natural game flow boggles the mind.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/paranoia/
---
Seems pretty similar mate.
---
Potions\* not flasks. And no, there's little  need for Fire resistance stacking on anyone else than MT. Unless overpriced, buy a few Greater fire protection pots (mats for these are \~4.5 g on my realm) and you can get a stack of cheaper ones, typically \~1-1.5 g each. Our guild doesn't ask for consumable popping outside of Rag, where they're checking that people can be arsed to put in \~5g worth of consumables to down him. No potion, no loot. Someone usually carries 20\~extras for sale in case someone "forgot theirs in the bank".
---
I skimmed through your post. I would give you a gold award but my pregnant 3 year old son held me at gunpoint while his stepdad took my money.
---
I have some advice for you though. Lower your graphic settings to increase fps, it will help you react faster to the opponents moves.
---
Do you have a ryzen cpu?
---
I started WoW (on a PvP server) in TBC. I could never have imagine how bad it would be on a PvP server in this phase. If I would I would have rolled PvE in a heartbeat...
---
Elemental watch is about 95s a piece on my realm.
---
Just sold all mine
---
That's Perl Unitframes
---
People will still gank reds on sight, just won't go out of their way to find some.
---
Just don’t breath, Spy will not detect you.
---
you think this is horrifying? wait for a Sunday to come...
---
Don't do that. Just chill out, it was a mistake, keep your stuff and he will get it again. An upgrade is still an upgrade.
---
Honestly, as horde on Gehennas, my experience mirrors this video.
---
It took me 45 mins to walk from Camp Mojache to Dire Maul yesterday.
---
15 mins to get past the wall of stealthed rogues and druids, another 30 to corpse walk past all the gnomes barricading the road, over the bridge, up the ramp, past the corridors, across the courtyard, die one more time opening the door, and into the actual instance entrance.
---
It's same as in real life - people who "active" will get more than people who just quietly do their jobs.  
---
So answer is "Yes". If you want to get more loot, you need to become "friends" with your officers, chat with them, participate in events like PvP raid that they organize, etc.  
---
Exactly same stuff that you need to do if you want to get a promotion in big company :)
---
Yep
---
It's literally a game about two factions at war. Multiple quests involve this. There are even quests that PVP flag you.
---
You do understand games are basically simulations, right? When you're "in the game" the reality is that the game world. It doesnt matter what the medium was to get there. The only difference is once you're out of the game, you arent at war with the physical humans who played the other faction.
---
Thanks for all the replies, I think I’ll spam Mara/ST until maybe 54 and go in then
---
Can confirm, only horde do this alliance are pure and sacred
---
&gt;It's an add-on. It's really bad for the game....
---
&gt; I'm a rogue and [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19885/track-hidden) thing negates one of my core class mechanics - rendering the gameplay completely broken.
---
Why the fuck did you not just walk away ?
---
Ditto
---
Can confirm Eternal is full of assholes.
---
I raided with a hunter who literally never used feign death until after he pulled agro. Like, i guess he just didn’t understand that you want to feign BEFORE you pull agro - not after.
---
The guild leader defended the hunter too, told the tank he was bad and to do a better job keeping agro.
---
With one exception being DMN tribute AP buff. It's a regular AP buff which actually only increases melee attack power and not ranged attack power.
---
It’s fine, they act cocky because of it then you just grenade them or death coil during wotf and fear again
---
Right now
---
Try this:
---
A /who for any zone, and the capital cities, by level range.
---
Unless you think most people have a 60 AND are leveling alts, it’s going to be heavily skewed for under 60.
---
Full Disclosure: started classic 2 weeks in, currently level 52, “semi-serious” player.
---
Except if you are a 3k hp hunter
---
Although its unofficial, we have data using a relatively solid collection method that backs up my claims. 
---
But since you want to claim these are wrong, please link me to Blizzard's official numbers.
---
I am the alliance Hunter that every horde want to kill. I am being stream sniped by multiple guilds as I am on their KoS list, yet even with no delay on my stream they don't seem to be able to catch me and the only times they have killed me its because they bring 20+ mates to help killing me. Bring it you dirty hordes, I am waiting!
---
That's clearly a case of taking "no changes" too far. There is no way they originally intended us to avoid enchanting gear to make room for more buffs.
---
Wheres the nsfw tag tho?
---
I sont charge for water with folks I'm grouped with...
---
But I definitely expect a tip if I'm stopping what I'm doing to make 4 stacks of water for a guy out in the wild.
---
Your GM/Loot Council is shitty. Find another guild, recommend shroud DKP
---
I do have money to pay 40 accounts per month but I still need friends.
---
Yes, my point is this isn't some Horde only phenomena, despite the multitude of Alliance posts complaining otherwise. 
---
Gank away, that's part of a PVP server.
---
Well, to start I don't participate but got ganked several times now while going to blackrock for instance. And I clearly remember it being this way back thrn, especially before bgs came out. This was a very short period and ppl tend to forget that. While I know we have less players, not all of them are additionally doing wpvp. But in the weeks after wpvp got implemented back then the world was dangerous and I died a lot so foe me it's compareable.
---
but we're melting his face...
---
You do not take durability loss by dying from pvp. [source1](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Durability), [source2](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Durability), [source3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Durability)
---
Also you site an average of 1:3 faction imbalance which you have not source for. The only source we have, which can be inaccurate, is [wow classic population](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/) which shows most server's aren't as skewed.
---
&gt; (mats for these are ~4.5 g on my realm) 
---
On my realm you can choose between a 2.5G portion or 4.5G of mats..
---
On most servers there will be 3-4 orcs joining the fight shortly anyway.
---
Hope you're intentionally exaggerating because 100h/week is rank 14 territory.
---
65/35 for sure. I'm casual af and my gear is shit, but the ratio is not good. If you see Respls rolling around, pls don't kill me xoxo
---
Is there a lore reason behind these invasions, or were they part of a specific patch or story element? Don't really understand why this elemental invasion is happening or why it is coming now.
---
Our server has the same issue. People like to act as if they are the mafia. Told a Lionheart helm crafter that if hed go below 100g fee they would just craft it for free ... and worse (lol). To many people trying to turn classic wow in some wannabe EVE Online. One of our servers enchanters that does free enchants got muted by report abuse aswell. It got overturned though. I always point people towards him even for enchant to fuck over the griefers :)
---
Naxx is not only the only raid thats been out twice, but was the entry level raid during the games peak in popularity.  More people will be familiar with naxx mechanics than for any other raid.
---
I don't like to blow people but 100g is 100g.
---
So asmongold got extra content out of it in the end.
---
He's the fucking Logan Paul of wow
---
Or maybe you just got killed since you award honor and some people want to get their rank up and couldn't care less about how 'good at pvp' it makes them look. All this salt, I love it lmao
---
just like you this is my first time playing WoW, im in my late 20's played a bunch of games eversince i can remember. i am not even level 60 and i experience a lot of greedyness from random people. i have never seen such a toxic community in terms of itemdrops and lootdistribution. that why i do dungeons with a bunch of people in their 40's and 50's. they level at my pace, dont care tomuch about being at the top of the leaderboards and just try to have fun and experience a game like they used to do back in the old days.
---
The guild im in now is split into two groups, hardcoreplayers/addicts and youngsters and a group filled with OG's just enjoying the game.
---
Maybe it is because i am on a PvE server but i enjoy the company of those OG's. they are patient, kind and wise.
---
My item rack addon suddenly didnt show carrot on a stick. But if you hover over the items to give the popup option for the other trinkets, hold alt and it’ll display the hidden trinkets
---
think of the chaffing...
---
Still squeezing here
---
The two room right is not super hard as its FF on pri targets till boss drops. It may give him an adv tbh. 
---
The +/- would be diff as its not everyone but targeted folks and you get 2-3 sec to move your ass. 
---
The one I would be most impressed by would be Saph and KT. Very hard to move that many people to avoid the Blizzard and Ice tomes and splash damage from TKs void pools. 
---
Not saying it cant be done, just saying it will be impressive for one person to do it and kill the boss.
---
I play on blaumeux and I’ve seen this exact guy spamming and it’s no different than all the guild recruiters spamming even bigger paragraphs in world chat twice in a row to fill the chat box. I just ignore them :-) EZ Clap
---
250-300 honor per hour? How do you even get so low?
---
Yes, it is total horde domination. Today i tried to go to Felwood. After i landed in Menethil Harbor i died 3 times before i manage somehow to do HS back to IF :)
---
Baseline spell resist is way more than 10%, you want to use both t3 and the trinket.
---
Oof yeah. Just try getting Ring of Spellpower/Talisman of Ephemeral Power/Choker of the Fire Lord when literally over half the raid needs them.  
---
*cries in shadowpriest*
---
Dont know your class, but 3 weeks is high frequency for fury/mage in my experience
---
No problem. Playing healer myself so can't tell for sure - but I think they do stack. Have a look through this [buff article](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-consumables-list-for-each-class), it's quite comprehensive and might give some insight. There's also the Winter Squid food which gives a +10 agi food buff (pretty insignificant, but it's a nice bonus - and fishing is fun and useful, you should level it) all the same. Some potentially useful miscellaneous consumables listed there as well - if you can get Onyxia or DM buffs before the raid that's going to boost your damage by a nice amount, as long as you do not die. 
---
And make sure you have either BigWigs or DeadlyBossMods addon installed, either one is fine but use one - those raid warnings and timers are gold, and we've had some guild members kill \~1/3 of the raid because they did not have the addon and were slow reacting to Discord yells. It happens, but if you're the cause it's pretty embarrassing. On mechanics with huge, incoming damage it's better to run out 1 second before you "have to" despite losing out on 1 hit - if you die, it's 0 DPS from there on.
---
This thread gave me diarrhea, so technically 'same'.
---
[Sad trombone](https://i.imgur.com/S5qXnEI.png)

Context: The above shows the guide I was reading trying to figure out what my BIS (not pre-raid BIS) weapon for fury warrior is. Considering I will wear "Edgmaster" in the end wouldn´t Deathbringer make way more sense? Its slower, has more base dmg etc. and when I have Edgmaster I basically count like an Orc for BIS, or?
---
If anyone could share some light on what weapon is BIS for Fury warrior it would greatly help me to save up my DKP \^\^ 
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Pretty much, anyone who doesnt think it's an issue is a moron. I'm horde on pvp server also, it's not fun for either side.
---
There was a server shutdown but only lasted for around 15 mins. They had an art contest while waiting.
---
I've heared others say they downed everything except for Ragnaros.
---
Do you happen to be on Razorgore?
---
what prevents casuals from farming dire maul? i don't get it. 
---
the only thing that prevents casuals from anything is the amount of time they are *not* willing to spend on the game.
---
WOW Classic is all about time investment, nothing else.
---
What the hell, if I did this I would get kicked the fuck out and then be forced to pay like $5000
---
&gt; glad you only had to read the title
---
Title could just have been the word loot and the answer would have been yes.
---
Assuming things about someone real life based on how they choose to enjoy their PVP time on a PVP realm. WeirdChamp. Probably another boomer alliance tabbed out while he's waiting on the respawn timer LOL
---
reputation bonus, sword and mace +skill
---
Those bonuses are insane for a serious melee pve player
---
It's going to be one of the top posts of all time on this sub.
---
Ok now wait, is THIS a joke? I gotta just check for sure-zies
---
Had my dm buffs fall off during garr.
---
&gt; I leave guilds with people like that in them
---
Talk to your officers / GM first. We kick people like that instead.
---
It's all dependent on the people running it. I joined a guild running Loot Council, and they have spreadsheets available with a plan for all the loot, who gets what and when. The choices made are completely transparent, and you can bring up issues with the plan if you have them (hasn't been necessary yet).  
---
The only downside for me has been that losing roll RNG makes things a little less exciting!
---
Heh, potions are usually just under 5 g but go up to 6-7 on busy raid nights - but never ever under 4g, elemental fire alone is 4g and dream foil is 50s when on the cheaper side.
---
Managing a 40man roster in 2005 was harder than it is now though. It's easier to have guild cohesion and fill an active roster of 40 players in 2019 due to the many out-of-game tools to manage guilds, such as Discord, well worked out signup functions on guild sites etc, heck facebook groups even. 2005 was an archaic bronze age in comparison.
---
No, but expect to die a few times to trash regardless. Some have AoE stuns and a cleave on top, fire resistance won't save you. 
---
And yeah, fire protection potions for Rag, doesn't hurt for Gheddon either
---
Are u in fusion lol
---
This is slightly worse than Gandling EU but not by much...
---
I was forced to spec shadow so I could at least fight back if it wasn't a raid camping me. I still spend most of my time just sitting in a capital city or on a level 20 alt with LFG open -_-
---
Actually, we (tank/heal/DPS we regularly play with) formed the team so we brought them into our team. 
---
The chat actually disproves your point, given more context. The guy who says it's just a game, towards the end, is a friend of tank, and tank mentioned that they're friends. No mention of their relationship to each other when the mage gave him shit, or that he was just bringing him along because he's a friend.
---
It's time for paid character transfers,  they were in classic and they had a long cd.
---
Use of a program that lets your use multiple accounts in window mode. 
---
You can set up key bindes to do actions via macros on the 2nd account when you do an action on account 1. 
---
Example: 
---
I push key 1 for main account, this will cause account 1 to cast shadow bolt, account 2 has a macro that after I push 1 it will cast a renew on a target named in the macro or some other action that I chose to have it take. 
---
This and turning on some different options for follow and loot allow you to control the other characters from the “master”. 
---
There is some other special options that come up but for the most part the above is the TL:DR.
---
Can confirm using 1.3 speed dagger get 2 or more wf procs in a row
---
Lol reporting priest for that; jesus; youre worse than that priest
---
Why do you dumb shits keep posting the same response? They rolled on pvp servers to pvp. Getting swarmed by 20 members of the enemy faction for an hour trying to get into BRM isn't pvp. I'm Horde on Skeram and this shit isn't fun anymore.
---
my character name is Lendificus on rattlegore, congrats
---
good meme, burger paul!
---
Me neither, haven't heard of them before. I am assuming it's fairly minor
---
Exactly. It's a video game and 80% of this hilarious subreddit is crying about getting killed in it by people that also want to play the game and rank up. And honestly all the vitriol and insulting going around here is making the 'issue' worse for you since it encourages people even more, but hey, good luck, atleast you vented :^)
---
I always loved the rain in WoW.
---
Also just wanted to mention: Edgemaster's skyrocketed in price following P2 for some reason. From 450/500 to 1400g on my server. I presume my server isn't the only one to have that happen.
---
for sure, everyone loses
---
Deathbringer MH, Vis or BB OH
---
Arathi Basin called, wants know why it's being /ignored?
---
Fire resist pots or one or two Arcane prots are fine. And for most, those are enough to clear up to Rag, and completely unnecessary for geared Raids. Our raids still have a few mandatory pots to bring for MC, even when we're already at farm stage at this point, so those are only to make the runs easier and slightly faster, at the expense of 10-20g per person, which is kinda worth it.
---
You really should reconsider being in that guild tbh, making flasks mandatory and having probational periods on a non progression raid is bollocks.
---
Thinking of it logically, it makes a lot of sense. 
---
Some guy is crashing the price on something you've spent a lot of money to optain the right to create, and you have the ability to silence him at no consequence to yourself? 
---
It'd frankly be illogical not to do it.
---
Rolling on a spell hit items as a healer is a big NO. Read the items, don't rely on Zygor.
---
Fuck that.
---
Other guy's a toxic cunt and if the raid leader seriously listens to his whiny shit that's a raidgroup I'd try to avoid in the future.
---
The taking turns on item rolls is totally fine, that's how we did it before we had a fixed roster. But it shouldn't carry over from one raid to another. New ID, new rolls IMHO.
---
Some people are extremely unlucky. I've run UBRS for the past 2 weeks doing 2 to 3 runs on the weekdays and putting in 8 runs on a single saturday (my record for a single day which was abysmal). So maybe not 50 on the nose but mid to high 40s for sure. I literally spend my last 30 minutes of my night corpse running to UBRS so when I get home from work I can get my runs in before doing something else. Think what you must but I know what I've spent my freetime doing. The math behind the probability of my "unrealistic" number of no loot runs is actually frustrating.
---
That's what happens when a multi billion dollar company fires staff to make even more money.
---
Same reason servers are shit.
---
We were here before it blew up.
---
The only way to fix faction imbalance is for players to play on the other faction.
---
So, off you go then.
---
Its fun to stir stuff up, ususally it brings a lot more people into the fight and shit hits the fan. Thats one of the reasons I like to gank and be a dick. :) Like someones friend gets ganked so they bring their friends and we bring more and they bring more :D
---
Why did you post this, clicker.
---
This looks like stock Classic Elvui. 
---
Great all in one addon.
---
I suggested that a week ago and did [not](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dvqd1k/controversial_how_to_fix_faction_imbalance/) get much support.
---
We aren't that high yet, but could be trending that way ☹️
---
I have no problem with reserving gear, my IRL friend who plays a rogue got the mainhand on his 91st run 2 nights ago. from about 50 runs onwards he had reserved the MH only. As a holy paladin i was always happy to come along for the Jed trinket chance. i got that around run 28. but i kept going with him. i felt he helped me get my gear i could at least reciprocate. 
---
in 40+ runs, we never once had someone complain about reserved gear. my feelings are, you know what you're getting into. if you don't wanna join a run where you cant get a shot at the main hand. then don't join it. 
---
we saw countless people come and go, getting the Jed trinket, the truestrike shoulders. even the chromatic carapace. All happy enough to come along.
---
on the fateful run where the MH finally dropped. it was the one and only time he forgot to put ML on, but the two warriors who were with us happily passed (not even a greed roll) as did everyone else.  because we were all there under the same pretense.
---
Our raid leader or officers usually say "the Core Hound dropped an epic!" - it works flawlessly.
---
Yup.. Got level 40 today but I only have 65 gold lol, no mount for me yet.
---
Guess that was his way of establishing dominance.
---
I just rerolled to Horde.. i don't have enough time to justify playing alliance.
---
They don't usually specify though? Thats where the confusion comes from. They are indeed melee only, but often its stated as attack power, not melee attack power.
---
Gehennas also have 2 hours and probably more at peak times. I've dodged the queue boss since we went down to one layer so I'm not sure. No big streamers either
---
you realise that you and ppl like you are the reason skeram is in a bad place? skeram was 45/55 bevor you guys started leaving the server because it was so "unbalanced". not its 30/70
---
thanks for that
---
&gt; You do understand games are basically simulations, right? 
---
No, I understand that they are basically games, you fucking sperglord.
---
&gt;**Game** 
---
&gt;
---
*An activity that one engages in for amusement or fun.
---
"the kids were playing a game with their balloons"*
---
You enjoy your game the way you, but others might have different opinions.
---
Same!
---
Respec or reroll?
---
You alright? Takes a special kind of mood to be this kind of asshole.
---
Pretty similar to Noggenfogger EU.
---
This games a joke anyway who cares.
---
what are we suppost to do. there are no bg s so the only way to rank is find alliance and kill them. alliance on skeram created this problem themself. skeram was a good server. it was 45/55. then they all left cause the server was so "unbalanced" and now the server is a shitshow
---
Gnomes racial +5% int in it's glory. It makes Horde jump off ship yelling "Yo dink u smatta than me, Mon!!"
---
Capitalism
---
Firemaw
---
If you did this to me and were saying sorry, I wouldn’t care.  Especially since your willing to help get it again. 
---
If the mage is a human he will fuck with you a little but just move on about his business.
---
I have this issue where I always seem to click on my group members if in a dungeon and lose my sinister strike combo points on the enemy, or when in solo for example when fighting more than 1 mob I somehow click the corpse and that causes to lose combo points as well. Is there an option somewhere to turn this off or do I just need to be more careful? It's more of an issue inside dungeons since it's a cluster fuck of enemies.
---
I've started leveling a Hunter with lfg open too :) my priest is parked in if
---
Herod tends to have more Ally on than Horde.
---
Just like how WPL is a no go zone for questing, regardless of your faction.
---
Ah, we have a hunter that spent a lot of time multishotting hillsbrad, ended up somewhere in top 10.
---
Of course, bgs are instanced pvp and cross realm
---
lol that wasnt the cap at work that was garr
---
They wont? But why. Well atleast less idiots trashtalking in my BGs then i guess.
---
Grats!
---
Its the little things that make Classic fun!
---
I joined my current guild because they use EP/GP, was tired of all the bullshit with LC, +1, and Rolls on my previous guilds and PUGs.
---
Your parents must be proud
---
Of course it's not impossible. I logged back in a few minutes after and manages to hearthstone away, but still sad story :/
---
Mainly a tank problem.
---
I was so happy a week ago :(
---
Before the honour kicked in I'd had some great fights with Ally, of course there have been some gankings on both sides - but it was all pretty fun and part of the whole experience. It's just awful now, I can't believe how bad it is!
---
I really don't want to Instance level, already done ST 4 times, I can't be arsed to go back!
---
Hope it goes back to normal in a few weeks!
---
Can't believe I had to scroll back up and look at that picture again before I got it. I thought it sounded familiar. And I do to appreciate the reference (once I finally got it).
---
Should be a option in the menu called "Hidden Items" uncheck that.
---
Beer makes you a &lt;One Man Armies&gt;
---
Why is every single pve player spamming about how glad they are to be on a pve server? Just sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.
---
Skill is about the least important aspect of PvP in this game.
---
If you want to pvp get BRE if not, if you are an orc get axes if you are anything else go swords.
---
If you're on EU maintenance isn't til tonight, that's when it will be implemented.
---
Private server players? Come on. The most toxic people I've encountered in this game came over from retail and had never played on a private server, yet I'm not going around saying all retail players are bad.
---
Google, Guides. They're literally everywhere.
---
Wowhead, Icyveins
---
That doesn't make it any less sad
---
4 weeks.
---
Because anything less than a perfectly balanced server is unplayable by Alliance.
---
I'm gonna be pretty mad if they do     
---
I got a toon to like mid 50s on a launch server with an old guild mate friend.. from that time they added more servers and even more servers and our realm's population dipped HARD, I was maybe slightly above casual... friend decided he was going to re-roll on another server, another class.... I wasn't on board, I ended up rolling on the server I initially wanted to play on, same class, same race.    
---
   
---
at 3:15am Thursday I did a /who warrior 60 on the mistake server, 8 results... 1 of which may have been on his way to do ubrs, on the server I'm currently on... 50(the max the /who can report), I see people doing Ony, I see alot of em in blackrock spire(ubrs, lbrs, mc...  ) while I was in ORG at like 2:45am I got a dragonslayer buff because some guild was going after a world boss....      
---
If Bliz offers realm transfers it's going to look like a deliberate cash grab imo, how many launch servers where there vs how many now? the first realm I rolled on was looking good.. had queue time and everything... now it's empty as hell
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
Haha yeah that makes sense, i just thought dm buffs and ony buffs were not dispellable.  Im also a ret paladin so i use both caster and melee consumes.  But keep in mind minibuffs do count too like renew and inspiration and stuff.  So it can get pretty close
---
It's hilarious how bent out of shape a post like this gets people. I thought it was an entertaining shitpost and nothing more, relax people.
---
Luckily I'm in a server that's pretty close in population on both sides. But experienced similar to this trying to get into DM:E from Camp Mojache.
---
Just tons of alliance in small pocket groups along the way insta killing people. Took about 30 minutes before a horde raid group came through and killed them all.
---
Just imagine people crying about something, getting a fix for it and then cry about the fix.
---
who are you really trying to convince: everyone else, or yourself?
---
This "community" never fails to impress.
---
Definetly way more horde. You have camped the boat from menethil-theramore for a week now and there are always hordes camping dungeon entrances. But i would say alliance players are generally better so it kinda makes up for it.
---
omegacringe
---
That is correct, but he asked if it would drop before Darkmoon faire, which seems unlikely since cards aren't dropping yet.
---
Look, as much as I'm tired of the PVP bitching. This is the only way to get honor. Some people will do this until BGs come out.
---
Now's the time for you guys to PVP Horde back and git gud.
---
Talking about the AP
---
both the ones u have referred to have 2hand and dual wield options for BIS and both say its Best
---
Its pretty bad if you’re on a server with high faction imbalance. Searing Gorge and blackrock mountain are pretty much suicide zones. You expect to corpse run to get into most high level dungeons. Can’t speak for the people leveling though. People are out for blood, camping spirit healers and generally running around in death squads obliterating people with inferior numbers
---
Blizzard never designed the game around world PvP. Patch 1.4 to 1.5 was a total of 7 weeks: April 19th (1.4) to 7th June (1.5).
---
This time around the game is 4 weeks. People are crying about 3 weeks?  A whole 3 weeks??? 
---
Blizzard always planned to have battlegrounds in the game and be the center of PvP. If you look back you can find Blizzard talking about battlegrounds before the release of the game in late November 2004.
---
Oh man I see people talking about only seeing 2-3 weapons boy oh boy I wish we did.
---
My guild has cleared MC since week 2 - relatively hardcore. My we’ve seen 0 weapons. 0. Not 1. And we’ve only seen mageblade once. Plenty Staff of Dom’s though. Almost all our casters have one 
---
I’m hoarding dkp so I’ll get the 1st perditions in our raid - but how many more weeks can that be? I feel bad for our fury warriors and sword rogues too - brutality blade is supposed to at least be semi common.
---
Wait, what? Are you serious?
---
In all my years of playing a tank this has never ever happened to me even once. 
---
If this is real then maybe you should consider finding new warriors (if you are in that position), or find a new guild. This is definitely not how things work lol.
---
No. I play on a high pop server and its exaggerated. Time and place matter. You can play around it using dungeons but there will be frustating greifers every once in awhile
---
I love how you immediately resort to bashing horde instead of people who roll on favored factions in imbalanced realms.  I came in right before census died and chose the most even server I could, and WoW has been great.
---
Can you do the math so you can call me a liar here: 43 SM Armory runs and never saw The Ravager drop. I specced elemental after and haven’t touched enhancement because I’m still salty.
---
Find your target, stick to that one and kill it, proceed onto next target.
---
You can google "rogue mouseover kick macro" to set up a macro which can be used to kick a nearby enemy without swapping targets and losing combo points - at least it exists in other versions of the game, so I assume it does here as well. Very very useful for both PvE and PvP.
---
1 HK, 12 honor, 89 standing.
---
On PvP server.
---
&gt; scarce
---
This weeks activity shows H/A looks relatively even.
---
I hope they wait, i have only gotten 1 epic after weeks of raiding. Maybe in 12 months i will have 3-4 epics if im lucky.
---
Play stupid games get stupid prizes
---
Well if you want to try hard get a Treant's Bane to hold you over until you can get either Deathbringer, Bonereaver, or OBE. The Treant's Bane on an orc is dope as fuck for fury dps, you can drop hit for crit. But DONT take a perdition blade over your rogues if you're an orc... dick move imo. Just wait for the Deathbringers. Spend your dkp if you're hoarding on other hard to get stuff... onslaught girdle, quick strike ring maybe, striker's mark. The deathbringer will drop eventually.
---
Pretty much this
---
Good god me too
---
In the comments: hate from people seeing everything through a PUG perspective.
---
I couldn't give 2 shits about your Census uploads. I play on Firemaw, when I check the date for the last week on that website, it says that there 72% Alliance and 28% horde. Anybody who spent longer than 10 minutes on firemaw could tell you that is complete bullshit. I don't feel like Firemaw is horribly unbalanced, but ESPECIALLY not an Alliance majority. 
---
Maybe it will be more realistic when more people upload their data, but right now I can't trust anything on that website.
---
This is interesting. I've been thinking about ways to motivate people to keep raiding when they get everything they want beyond a sense of duty, so this all be something I need to consider.
---
&gt;the dungeon that is notoriously hard to find a tank for.
---
lol 
---
&gt;strat live 
---
Hard to find a tank 
---
I got it around my 400th run, BUT, on only my 8th time seeing Gorosh.  I had a friend that had done about 100 runs and saw gorosh 30+ times and never got the chest, Unfortunately it’s all just RNG. I went over 150 runs without even seeing Gorosh once but stayed persistent and sure enough I finally got it! Don’t give up!
---
It was never balanced, just not absurdly unbalanced.  But when the server is so insanely overpopulated, a small imbalance means there are thousands more horde, which just leads close to the same thing.
---
&gt; waiting for a fix
---
All Blizzard had to do was have PVE servers at launch.
---
Wait so you did a roll off for 100g, but gave him 100g 1st? What the fuck even is this interaction?
---
Yu sim ta spik it thow
---
Wait, you can Reddit elsewhere?
---
As a healer I refuse to heal mages that don't give me water. If there's no mage I won't heal life-tapping locks either.
---
That's why we went loot council. It seems that the best way to be lucky in WoW is to be truly and completely awful at your class/role lol
---
Same here! Every other time I restart the client. Changing stance on my warrior also solves it for me
---
Implement a toggle for PvP in contested zones.
---
&gt;My concern about rolling on a PVE server is that people are more casual and don't raid
---
This has to be a troll.
---
This is exactly how the level 60 human rogues are on my server.
---
PvP related question: Does player level of the victim impact honor gained or is it purely based on rank? I.e. does a lvl 52 rank0 player still net 199 honor to a lvl 60 player killing him?
---
you fucking go through BURNING STEPPES, how hard can it be. go from morgans vigil, die 1, 2 times maximum.
---
You sure?

I think all of us on PvE servers have learned this lesson at some point. I was told the same thing by my friends when I first started playing, and I played through the next 2 expansions that way before finally making a PvE character. Never looked back. PvP servers just aren't for me.
---
BRE is 2h bis (even for orcs) and very competitive throughout Classic. Really boils down to whether you want to play 2h or DW.
---
Regards,
---
Tauren that is crushing anyone in dps with BRE
---
Ya, but then they can camp one spot and just resskill ppl, which gives honor.
---
Keep in mind, that people this time around arent new to WoW and the mmorpg genre, and will therefore minmax and grind whatever it is they do effectively. This means, that organization and efficiency is on a whole different level from what it was in vanilla, leading to this mayhem.
---
This really seems to bother some people. :)
---
Actually it is pvp, its just not the pvp you want to do. If you want to be able to choose what type of pvp you engage in then you shouldnt be on a pvp server.
---
Level of mob vs level of spell used to CC
---
PC lvl also playes a role as looming at logs the mob seems to pop out of CC at 3 sec intervals (almost like a internal check) after they are put into it.
---
If I had 2 hours to play, and I didn't want PVP to be potentially mandatory, I wouldn't have rolled on a PVP server
---
Along? What are you talking about ?
---
Right now it's a better census system than a website that claims that Firemaw  is 78% Alliance favored. At least until more data has been uploaded. You don't need to have 200 IQ to realize that Firemaw is NOT 78% Alliance lol.
---
Pretty sure he’s talking private servers. You’re right on the official launches though.
---
What a bunch of twats, even a noob can make a stutter jump like that
---
Look at the state of this comment section, damn near a fifth of people here just bitching for no reason over an obvious shitpost. Amazing.
---
I really like 40-49, where classes pretty much have all their core components unlocked and can finally shine. 10-19 has more cheese than France
---
Agreed. You miss half the game playing only 1 faction.

Imagine not rolling on a server with your desired rule set the first time.
---
Holy priests don't count
---
/nod
---
Depends on the server. I still get fucked by a raid of hordes when i land in high lvl areas and need to corpserun for 15 mins to get into Blackrock Mountain. 
---
So yeah i'd say it really is that bad.
---
Census is working for a while btw
---
Gauno is not
---
Same, fucking hell. Needing on all boes because they where to lazy to repair.
---
You can use exorsus

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/exorsus-raid-tools/files
---
Or make a weakaura to track the CD
---
Are you the bizzaro me? I am also on Thunderfury, as a holy priest, but I am horde.
---
The alliance make getting into BRD hell, usually takes about 8 deaths.
---
Do the upcoming elemental invasions drop much needed elemental fire?
---
Yeah. I love sitting in a cave for 2.5 hours because i need to drop some kind of staff, wand or whatever that item from the yetis was in hillsbrad, that i obtained after murdering a couple hundred of these. And apparently i was lucky since it's a 0.2% drop... 1/500.
---
Fuck that shit honestly. It doesn't even give money or gear as a reward for a very rare item. And the quest chain pretty much forces you to suicide at least once or twice, and doesn't give anything other than exp anyways.
---
If what you call an addictive gamble was tied to an appealing reward, it would be worth the shot. But if that reward is not mentioning, that's just frustrating to do honestly.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/

Have a look at this.
---
The addon will do a census for you 5-10 minutes with just mouseclickng, and you can upload the results.

---
Also if someone is much higher level than you (&gt;9 levels), you will be seen like you aren't in stealth.
---
So I was explaining the problem about playing Alliance at a horde favored instance. They compare it to how it is nowadays in Retail. Its comparable and if I don't like it I should roll a PvE server if I can't handle it. Any good arguments? 
---
I love PvP but this does not feel like PvP to me. It feels like getting washed away by a Tsunami of Horde. Menithil Harbor, the boats, even IronForge is not safe anymore. Should I really reroll PvE?
---
You will still gain honor in the world. Battlegrounds are ways for people to pvp on que and it's a game mode specifically for that. get honor quicker this way. &amp; less people in the world farming honor on everybody.
---
If you're tanking and setting up the group, I don't see an issue. Even just doing the latter is fine - people don't have to join if they don't like your reservation.
---
Rogues hunters and priests
---
Or duel good players, or 1v2+ and use engi gadgets well, or actually show some skill by vanishing key enemy cds, or show good game sense by predicting what your enemies are gonna do etc.
---
Showing yourself open on someone who cant remove the stun and using tea or cb evisc on cloth/leather wearers is a waste of everyone's time.
---
What we've done is that the loot council decides who is eligible to roll on a piece of loot, based on a variety of factors (attendance, performance, gear that will be replaced, etc). This tends to narrow it down to 3-4 people who then roll for the piece, so we still have that element of ring that adds some excitement to the loot process.
---
I suppose were lucky, because most of our players are fairly good, so it's rare we have to exclude someone for performance, and when we do, we show them the logs that show that they aren't performing and we work with them to improve.
---

Doesn't make you any less stupid. Sorry not sorry.
---
I took a break from LoL to try wow classic. Why did it have to turn into this pvp mess. Ill just stick to lol know, atleast it has some balance
---
Yeah. Not something that should be reported though. These dipshits should be banned.
---
mmhhhhmmm this salt is very tasty!
---
Less pvp edgelords in scuba helmets ganking you off flight paths
---

---
Which is effectively is the same.
---
To be fair, only someone who truly min-maxes will reach buff cap (and maybe some tanks).
---
And if you min-max, then hey, now you can min-max buff caps too so there is more for you to theorycraft about.
---
I'm kind of a noob myself but I'd do Dungeons here and then because you will get some good items. I don't think it's important on lower levels but at 30+ I recommend doing more than one run per Dungeon.
---
This is actually true of our loot council. We've recently got complaints from people because they feel like the leadership shouldn't be the worst geared players in the raid. A good sign ino.
---
That Female Tauren Hunter tho...nice
---
This argument keeps being made and is silly. It’s not like vanilla players were cave men. And flocking in mobs around zones to mow down random noobs isn’t exactly some sort of revolutionary innovation in “organization and efficiency”. 
---
The simple thing is that these servers are packed. And that’s basically it.
---
By some miracle all the horde players are pros and the Alliance are just bad. Yes that must be why no ones playing anymore or getting steamrolled.
---
Nobody's anecdotes matter. Popular "opinion" is fallacious too. What matters is DATA
---
 https://imgur.com/DkN6xfO.jpg
---
 https://imgur.com/l9lYSof.jpg
---
As far as "more people's" this is done with server wide who requests, so more people isn't necessarily the answer, it's how frequently data is uploaded.
---
Tanks are supposed to work together, more than any other role.
---
MT1 and MT2 in a good guild should be fury/prot and deep prot and sharing tasks as the fight will go. Need to DPS fast ? Fury. Boss hits hard af and needs to be moved ? Prot.
---
That's how it basically should be in this phase 1. Both are getting gear almost at the same time, and the DPS warriors ends up getting tank stuff for later phases.
---
I do tank raids and I never taunt out of another tank nor he does. If it's stuck to a tank let the mob be. Just taunt if your mate has very low HP's or something like that...
---
"Currently there is census data from the most Wow Classic realms but this project aims to provide data from all the realms as well. Keep in mind that the data is only as good, as of how many people are uploading their data"
---
My server shows as 53/47 in alliance favor, yet it's 1.7 Horde for every 1 Ally. We have a guy in our server discord with an account for both factions scanning on demand.
---
Depends, if you're trying to level to 60 as fast as humanly possible you're not going to want to do dungeons at all. If you want to experience the game and all it has to offer you should try to do all of them starting with deadmines at level 18-20. 
---
Admittedly it's far harder for alliance to get to some dungeons than horde but they're still worth doing at least once for the experience/loot.
---
It will run at them only if you can already target them for starters. So if they can target you, they will be able to send their pet at you.
---
They could do the same thing by finding your nameplate and sending their pet at you.
---
Second, if you are legitimately stealthed after they send their pet after you, and they lose targeting on you, the pet will leash back after a few seconds.
---
And for the record, I am a druid, I can stealth and I have evaded many a warlock and hunter pet this way.
---
Yes, horde is more dominant on most pvp servers so far.
---
thats not possible
---
The cords are where their own player was at the time. You don’t even know what you’re complaining about.
---
#nochanges
---
He's petty and annoying, sure, but on the other hand he's put significantly more effort into getting geared than you, so in that sense he deserves the loot more than you. This is pretty much why rolling loot sucks.
---
Awesome job! Hopefully you guys and gals got some decent stuff out of the kill!
---
didnt find one that exists, i found one post but when i click on the invite nothing happens..
---
Mouse movements since I broke my wrist (left) so I assume not clicking both left &amp; right click simultaneously and instead it registers left click somewhere else? Idk..
---
Two issues are at play:
---
1. Higher server pop caps than in Vanilla
---
2. Mindset of the PVP Player has changed
---
* On every single Private Server I rolled on, which had PVP enabled, it was a blood bath. Didn't matter the side, if you could be attacked...you were. On site, no mercy. Guess who makes up a sizable portion of the Classic playerbase, and guess where the majority of them rolled.
---
Now, if you were like me, you knew this and rolled PVE. Others thought it was going to be like 'in the movies (WoW Machina Videos)'. With epic **balanced** battles.
---
Also, for those of you wondering. No, BGs aren't going to fix this. You are still going to get ganked by the opposing side "locking down" a zone. - It's like giving a serial killer a gory video game, where they can mass-murder...and wondering why they still pile up the bodies down by the river; **it's the mentality**.
---
Is it possible to do Arena/Angerforge/Golem runs as a three-man at 60 with decent gear? 
---
Asking as a warrior who'd tank the dungeon and probably bring a mage/warlock and priest/shaman. The reason for doing this is less loot competition, of course.
---
5 boys and 4 girl tittys also
---
Wow
---
What interesting, original content
---
I look forward to more stimulating content from you in the future
---
Write a ticket. Report his ass.
---
Lol wrecked
---
Schadenfreude and basic lack of empathy is very far from the same thing.
---
Definitely the reason. I was calling out "/y A N A L" to hordies that were ganking me, got muted by mods and got the same screen.
---
I do recognize the problem that hunters can basically use most gear and therefore feel entitled to many of it. 
---
Was running ZF earlier this weak as a druid tank, when Embrace of the Lycan dropped. Obviously I needed because it’s pretty much the best head piece for feral druids at this level. Hunter got angry with and said I wasn’t allowed to roll on it because it has bonus attack power and therefore it’s a Hunter item.
---
By him, and by everyone having enough gear to get into it. Randoms could easily clear anything, including retail mythic bosses if you give it enough time for Youtube to be flooded with tactics videos so even your mama knows what to do.
---
Chances are if they are even care about world bosses, they are probably decked out in prebis at minimum with only and rag on farm, with nothing to do until raid reset happens other than PvP.
---
It will break my heart when he outrolls me on the hunter leaf, then being too bad to actually complete it. So I have to end up doing it for him.
---
Cool is too subjective.
---
Is he less cool for not spending 50% of his time doing another corpserun after being steamrolled 1:5?
---
Is he less cool for not joining the "ez mode" faction just to be carried by death squads roaming around?
---
PVE people have their freedom of choice and have wpvp on the acceptable scale. Much better than being on alliance side on a lot of servers right now.
---
This is exactly how any player on an unbalanced server is when they have the advantage
---
People bitch about Horde doing it, but go to one of the ally dominant realms and you'll find the same bullshit.
---
None of us are any better, so get off your high horses
---
The music is nice👍😊
---
Imagine their teeth is a T-1000 and your frost spells are the liquid nitrogen that freezes him. Your last frost spells is Arnold shooting him and he shatters. D:
---
Well it really depends on your server. My alt is on server with a big faction imbalance favouring the horde and they can just level fine in some zones. Western Pleaguelands and Ungoro for example is fine for horde but not possible for alliance.
---
When bg's pop it might help out slightly, but it's all on the players to fix it.
---
Most certainly. Some duo it, and well-geared rogues at 60 can even solo Anger from what I've heard.
---
Good, lol
---
They were like revered in Vanilla. I remember always being impressed when I ran across any of their members.
---
You get a standing no matter what.
---
Yeah you have plenty of time.
---
I’m level 60 so that’s not the issue.
---
Collecting 12 Mirefin heads two days ago. For the last head I had to kill more murlocks than for the previous 11 pieces... So I'm feelin' ya :D
---
Spell batching has currently a window of 0.4 seconds. I think people expected at most 0.1 seconds. I think pservers had 0.05s. Its a huuge difference.
---
You can easily do arena/anger forge, but not sure about Golem. If you only trying to farm the epic chest, I would try one tank one heal. Less item competition and u get the chest. Just give the heal the other boss drops. It is a fair deal for both parts.
---
This guy gave you some solid advice. Said almost everything I was going to. Here is one additional tidbit: after you charge in, use whirlwind. Its solid burst threat to glue them to you as you throw out revenge/sunders. Just make sure you have tactical mastery, otherwise it's not worth it.
---
What metric within the addon is he using to determine this?
---
Additionally, the site may have some delay with processing, so if you're looking in game, that may be more accurate. It also depends on how you're filtering the data, you can see that the breakdown for 60s is different than all levels.
---
"I'm not playing so no ones playing".
---
I've been ganking and getting ganked almost constantly, there's almost always pvp every day if you're willing to find it, just because you're bored of it doesn't mean everyone else is.
---
Get leatrix plus and it’ll help you loot faster and a bunch of other quality of life options.
---
If you win the bg do you get a win bonus? Do you not gain any of you lose? Do you lose honor of you lose? Its there mutiple bgs like 1v1 or 3v3? Isn't capture the flag part of it?
---
i see only girls
---
Okay, might be catseye elixir, or depending on the class might be track hidden, or stealth detection provided by a warlock pet.
---
WoW classic will never be the true vanilla experience with it releasing on patch 1.12 It's not that people are farming content as fast as possible, the content right now is just ridiculously easy with itemization and class talents of 1.12. This isn't entirely the communities fault, this is Blizzards too, MC originally wasn't designed with spell damage and healing in mind, so imagine running MC where the healers only heal for half as much per spell. BWL will get steamrolled too. People need a challenge to stay invested, and the current content isn't enough.
---
In reference to wPvP, this is another one of Blizzards choices to release too few servers and then proceed to raise the player server cap. The current wPvP situation coulda definitely been foresaw by Blizzard but they chose not to. BG's imo are also one of the best additions to the game, holding them back just seems silly in light of the fact that classic is not vanilla.
---
after bgs wpvp will be much worse off than p1.  nope.
---
imagine getting cyber bullied. like walk away from your pc
---
No Ally in Searing Gorge because they are too busy mechanically outplaying Horde lvl 40s outside Kargath.
---
3k ? 3000? 
---
Thats fucking embarrasing. Meanwhile northdale held 14k with less lag than batching is here
---
They don't. most alliance just sit in city's now. So the horde have started camping within those same citys. On dreadmist EU there is a 40 man horde raid camping the military quarter of IF at any given time. Even when the alliance actually bother to raid up and clear them out, they just rez and wait for it again.
---
What are we if not slaves to this torment
---
Even if you have no job or school or any responsibilities.... you have to have a fucking depressing and extremely boring life to want to farm people in wpvp 16 hours a day in an old game... especially when there is no challenging aspect to it.
---
You have a gambling addiction
---
pussy
---
I had hoped it would be out prior to Wpvp but no such luck. It’s gonna be wild in my server
---
Communist?
---
on Page southshore vs Tarren mill is happening pretty frequently as well as city invasions.
---
only downside is that Page is majority alliance.
---
LOOT THE DOGS!
---
It's been all over Youtube for 6 months.
---
Can i join. I am a girl. Big promise
---
If you're 60 and still don't have it, ask a 60 healer friend for help and do some duo runs - that way you don't have to compete. Let them have any non-ring drops or throw them some gold for their time, if you feel your gratitude won't be sufficient.
---
So your idea is for the lesser faction to leave? I stayed because if my guild left we would have left the server even more imbalanced. Our raid last night cleared BRM out of two horde guilds. The level 52-60 players were so happy to not die 25 times to get into the dungeons.
---
The faction imbalance needs to be felt or we might as well play on solo faction servers.
---
Honestly? Find a new guild, or even pug MC. A guild that keeps giving loot to horrible players is as bad as a pug, except a pug won't have him in it.
---
Nice; if only the loot would disappear
---
How large will my pet's aggro radius be if it is lower level? Can I bring my level 37 Broken Tooth to level 60 instances and just keep it on passive, without being too bad in terms of aggro?
---
100g a week isn’t much
---
as a hunter, is it a waste to have two pets that you swap in an out and keep them leveled? i do have both slots bought in the stables. i know i should get new pets often as some train my, but my intention was to keep sarkoth for almost ever, and i caught that white tiger in the barrens you need a quest item to summon. they're just unique in appearance is why i want them. of course, play the game how you like is good advise here,  but id like to know some opinions on keeping one pet forever. also, is there an easier way to stable your pet w/out actually visiting a stable. i can't just tame a new pet and push my current pet to the stable slot?
---
It's called being a nice person. Try it sometime. Gold isn't an be-all end-all currency. There is such a thing as "karma". A pretty cool guy that crafts my lionheart for free earns group invites in my book, maybe even priority on a gear drop here or there.
---
Leave now, go to a different server while the transfers are open and free. If they lock the transfers to horde only like they've done to other servers then you'll be stuck there, and horde won't leave a horde dominated server.
---
He's using census to scan for all players.
---
"started 2 census at 6:20PM server time, Alliance side finished 6:30PM with 1006 people online (down by 400 on last week)
---
1932 people online on the horde.
---
Only alliance 60 class/race combo with more than 50 online was Gnome Mage (54)
---
More than 50 Undead Priest, Warlock, Rogue, Mage, Tauren Druid, Warrior, Orc Shaman, Rogue, Hunter, Warriors online"
---
Dude, Horde on Ashbringer is just as bad, if not worse. Both sides’ players suffer if they are not into this kind of action because they enjoy it.
---
I want them to a) not have allowed an already out numbered alliance to leave in droves immediately before pvp dropped because they can’t be bothered to take responsibility for server balance b) reopen those same transfers because if they actually don’t give a shit and want to let one faction servers die then fucking let me out of mine.
---
This was predictable and preventable, they don’t fucking care. They let Blaumeux die on purpose now let me go somewhere else
---
This is not true. They had IRC (boomer discord), vent, team speak, extremely active wow forums, and smaller gaming community forums. They had websites that had plenty of information available. And people were definitely aware that these awards existed and wanted them. 
---
The big key difference is once again servers weren’t packing numbers in the 10’s of thousands per faction.
---
Sorry but they won't suffer: BGs are cross-realm.
---
Ex-horde player from Kurinaxx here. I rerolled alliance on another server with my guild because we had zero interest in taking part in that. It’s fucking brutal and I’m so glad I can help other people band together against this bullshit. Fuck roaming raiders and fuck the people who camp towns.
---
It's 3% for someone in PvP with the same level as you.
---
If you're shadow in PvP, then you have the Shadow Focus talent that gives you up to 10% hit. Mages also get 6%, it's the locks that would probably want it the most since they get none from talents, and even then they may want the shadow SP necklace anyway instead.
---
You don't need much for PvP. If anything, you would need spell hit more for PvE.
---
Youtube is a source nowadays? I was thinking in the lines of a blue post. Thanks though, very helpful.
---
1.12 vanilla BGs were cross-realm. WOW Classic beta had cross-realm BGs. Devs mentioned it in the interview shortly before Classic launch.
---
Will any endgame quests(50+) be added with the elemental invasion?
---
Thanks! That sounds awesome but also OP.  Is it a bannable app (i.e., can you get in some trouble for using it)?
---
I never got to fully play MoP, it looks great honestly. Hope I get the chance to play through it honestly.
---
I also never got to progress Firelands, which is widely regarded as an excellent raid.
---
I know they will be, but I hope they aren't.
---
Yup, I simply can't understand it. I'm a priest healer and have probably made 150g selling my PI for raids. I bet I could have gotten more but I don't want to end up with a reputation of trying to squeeze out as much gold as possible from my guildies. I usually sell it to the first person who asks to buy it. The most I've gotten is a Black Lotus.
---
Is it really that big of an achievement to top the dps meters? I mean, unless EVERYONE actually tries to top the meter, going all out with all the buffs\consumes and perfect rotations, does it even matter that you topped it? 
---
I get competing against your own class to some degree, but some fights certain classes are definitely going to win, no matter what.
---
thats hars dude!
---
Same thing in Sulfuras, but its 2 horde raids camping
---
well i cant roll an undead hunter so here i am
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
roll on pve for these 3 weeks or level alts for arcanite/mooncloth
---
Arena Grand Master. 1% dodge with an active that grants you a 750-1251 hp shield for 20s once every 30 minutes. At 19s it takes a good beating to work this down.
---
Christ in heaven our priests just throw it to whoever is already popping off.
---
Healing it as an enhancement shaman, you will need to have a good tank and even better dps.
---
I found this is a good dungeon to find high skill mages. The only time I've full completed it was at level 57 and our mage and tank (lvl 55 each) were so damn good it was refreshing to run it full and watch a good skilled mage do work.
---
Tldr: yes with a good tank and mage.
---
My point is, you know the situation you are in. You are unhappy about it, but you aren't doing anything to change your situation either. 
---
If you show up to work every day and hate your job but you aren't looking for another one, that's on you. 
---
Either way, no player is to blame for the imbalance. Don't blame the player or punish them. They didn't have control over it. Players on the side of the overpopulated faction likely have good reasons for staying. It just isn't realistic to try and force them to leave. There is a high chance that many would just quit rather than restart somewhere else.
---
That was a choice. Just like rolling on PVP sender too begin with.
---
Have resistences any impact in the 3s check?
---
That's because the Alliance already learn how to deal with 'progress' runs simply by making their way to the instance :')
---
Winterspring could work, plaugelands was camped yesterday at FP. 30 horde.  Thorium is always camped to BRD entrance..
---
Are you doing any herb/fishing/mining aswell? I just run on My route and try to engage with everyone i meet :)
---
Oh snap. I saw you in org last night dude! Rock on
---
Relevant: https://youtu.be/_5QoYZuMILo
---
I see people are quick to instinctively go into the defensive mode at a silly picture depicting the glory of phase 2 even when absolutely nothing has been said lmao
---
That's not even nearly as unlikely as what JaguarDTM claims to have seen. 
---
Ravager drop is ~13,65% so the chance of never seeing one in 43 runs is:
---
0,8635^43 = 0.001817 = 0,1817%
---
Sure, you're unlucky but if it makes you feel any better, every 550th person doing 43 runs encounters the same issue of never seeing ravager in those 43 runs. What Jaguar claims to have happened only happens to every 153.850.000th person so he claims to be 280.000 times more unlucky than you.
---
I just meant it isn't helpful to tell someone to just stop playing and wait for it to die down. It sucks that we have to change the way we are playing and the way we enjoy playing because of new rules that make it more difficult and aren't being used in the fairest way.
---
For the record, this is my first WOW experience and I joined this server to play with more experienced friends. They all levelled much faster than me of course and now it's an extremely frustrating experience for me to try to catch up.
---
Lich-erally
---
well, Raptor head have 100% drop rate. Just finished that with an alt
---
Wow this looks really useful - thanks!
---
I am better tbh.....
---
two days ago was indeed a good time.
---
Pretty much this. As if others were asking money for buffs or whatever. Kick and ignore.
---
i dont think this is the right game for you.
---
doing the same instances over and over and over again is absolute core. ive run scholo, which is absolutely hate, about 45 times without getting my (20%!) drop. to the point i quit running it entirely. you gonna run hundrets of instances. we had people running strat UD over 50 times for the cloak, the robe and many more essential items.
---
and the killing will never stop, with the classic honor system every player is honor and every honor helps. ANY honor. people will forever keep trying to hit ranks, and you, forever, will be the enabling factor for it.
---
i know for sure that i, and my mates, and everyone i know, gonna kill any alliance player ever on sight, no matter the circumstances. thats what pvp server means. you are nothing but a ressource.
---
it will not slow down. its also better to run wpvp solo than doing wsg pugging, because wsg pugging could mean you are struck for an hour killing the same people over and over again hitting the diminishing return way too fast/hard.
---
but people on this sub react all the same and tell me thats bullshit and it will slow down and that i probally didnt even play classic. and it wasnt total war and kill on sight on everything. dont listen to them, thats exactly what we did. in classic and on every private server since then.
---
if you hate being hunted down, fighting for farm/resources (hello next phases) reroll on pve server. it CAN feel the same if/when BGs hits, but you avoid all those above mentioned problems.
---
battlegrounds wont help you.
---
Your point is, in my opinion, stupid as fuck because you offer no solution to world imbalance. If they feel the imbalance they're more likely to change it. One solution? Undo the server transfers. Our server was 60/40 then the alliance (40) decided to go to the free transfer servers because of queues. Now the queues are gone and both servers sit on medium at peak hours.
---
It's actually worse, a lot worse.  86% alliance.
---
https://gyazo.com/673c4bb6af67908c194614d657179fdb
---
oh yeah on the holograms i agree, i really liked that about wildstar, such a shame what happened to it, i wonder if there are some private servers
---
Everything this Warlock said is wrong. Most warriors dont even rank up their defensive abilities. My revenge hits for 4 damage. No way should a levelling warrior much less any warrior not getting monster rage from raid mobs being doing more dmg with abilities. 
---
When I tanked Sunken Temple I found Demo Shout surprisingly effective for keeping aoe aggro. There's too many mobs to tab sunder and some caster is gonna try and aoe dps anyways. At that point I basically just try to position myself and taunt the first mob that turns away from me, concussive blow the next one, and hope taunt is back up. 
---
Piercing Howl can be pretty underrated for aoe tanking too. I doubt it pulls a ton of threat but if your groups are like mine, not a lot of mobs are getting slowed. Slowing all of them intermittently makes it less punishing for ranged party members to who grab aggro.
---
I didn't think that though.
---
TLDR, don’t hate the player hate the game
---
Thanks! Are they worth farming? Make much of an impact? Or just some extra mobs
---
The best you can do is hide all titles on the interface memu
---
Reddit’s audience is mostly north americans, so it’s not all that surprising. ;)
---
I was really hoping to find a Horde player on Ten Storms for data submissions. Please do submit your data too, though. More data is more data.
---
You’re exactly right. The reason the first rag kill was 6 months after launch in vanilla was because there weren’t enough 60s. And now that servers are so ‘packed’ as you put it, we have just enough people to properly play the game the designers intended it all those years ago. This time around rag got killed not even a week into launch on September 1, 5 days into launch. And that’s just a testament to the power of ... wait what is you’re argument?
---
Okay good point!
---
What would you like to be done?
---
20-30 hours is a part time job. Still not casual at all.
---
No, It's the opposite of being a nice person.
---
A nice person just does it, a scummy person advertises that hes doing free crafts, because he is actively fucking over people
---
Run away little girl
---
If it gives honor and isn't massively outnumbering me, it's dead. If it's gray, I either help out or ignore.
---
&gt; ally dominant realms
---
There is like on in us and zero in europe (maybe zandalar tribe, but it is balanced somewhat)
---
i fear BRE warriors so id go with that
---
Im not shocked that wow players have no sense of irony
---
Here: [https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=735](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=735)
---
I like how you didn't ask coaxials for a source, even though he was right
---
Enhancement shamans do okay in our raid. Never top of the board, but they don't drag down the raid. They do have a tendency to just drop dead randomly if they happen to proc some crits at the start of a fight.
---
We had one elemental shaman on a run so far, he did fine. Similar to enhancement but without the dropping dead part.
---
Everyone certainly appreciates the shamans being there because of totems.
---
What about chest spawns? I've noticed a chest spawn near the first book spawn in DM north, but I'm too lazy to run around and check for spawns.
---
Yes: [https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=735](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=735)
---
A lot of people are in your situation. They rolled on PvP servers remembering how it was 14 years ago but now that the spergs from the private server community has decided to ruin the experience for every single person playing the game a lot of people are simply unsubscribing and quitting the game.
---
Not releasing BGs along with the honor system is going to turn out to be a massive loss of income for Blizzard.
---
More important than any element of the game, is you absolutely must look up the faction balance on your server and delete the char if it’s bad because the game is unplayable for the victim faction on these dead servers.
---
Join a better guild, make friends and know your teammates so it's not a "waaaahhhh I want gear fest" and more of a "ok, what outcome best benefits our ability to run this more and faster?"
---
It was genuinely hard. My guild cleared aq40 but never did down a boss in naxx (to be fair activity etc did die down due to TBC). How has this post not been removed by mods for being low effort? They are normally so vicious with that.
---
People dying and BOP going on cool down anyways is also a classic
---
WoW paradox, every server is simultaneously horde and alliance dominated. Both Horde and Alliance outmanoeuvre and dominate the horde and alliance in PvP. Fucking horde and alliance won't ever engage in PvP unless they outnumber the horde and alliance.
---
Me too, still have exactly those. :D
---
Rag was bugged and not mathematically possible to be killed on vanilla launch and was basically killed within days to hours upon him being nerfed/ fixed. This was even done with the pre 1.12 bootleg talents and shitty itemization (spirit on all the warrior gear ect. ) The classic iteration of rag that was killed in a week was done so with the 1.12 trees and tweaked itemization. Lmao please shut the fuck up.
---
Except, they didn't. So it's a big change.
---
Alliance dominated realms? Plural?
---
There is 1. 
---
Cool your tears man, sorry you can’t have all the realms.
---
Finaly someone who gets it.
---
Yeah fuck them for by no fault of their own landing in a disproportionate server!
---
No way?!
---
If your opinion is "well you stayed on the server" for an imbalanced server, and it being their fault, that's a stupid opinion. 
---
The solutions you gave are definitely good solutions, but they need to feel the imbalance for the overpowering faction to actually want change. It's easy for the dominant faction to say "there are no problems" because they aren't swarmed by 10 people for entering a zone, then camped all the way to a guarded camp. 
---
Rewarding people is a good thing yes, but the problem with that is if you only give a kid candy he gets fat on it.
---
City rep + rank 3 gives discounts I think
---
I had all my prebis except rend swords at lvl 59, what's your argument again?
---
Imagine a raid where no one else wants brutality blade. We are months into MC, i've seen Warriors get 5/8 Set pieces in one run because what else. disenchant?
---
Sure, in a normal situation you can expect something like this to reasonably happen.
---
Except the other guilds changed the entire situation for the other guild, so they shouldn't be surprised now.
---
They exclude a guild for weeks from being able to get the LH crafted, even going as far as to pay for a 2nd recipe in order to prevent a specific group from having it.
---
And now people act surprised when the "attacked" party is striking back by fucking over all other guilds? Come on folks, this situation was made by their own hands. If they hadn't decided to be dicks about crafting LH for other guilds, they would've been making more money.  
---
But they didn't, they chose to be sad and pathethic, and then lost the fight. And as a result of losing the fight they are now being sad and pathethic and actually nearing the edge of allowed behaviour. I can't wait for the next few weeks when we're getting a new message "Guild X on server Y mass banned for 'false reports'.
---
Why would he be fucking over people? Are you talking about the people that bought lionheart recipe from someone else for 1000+ gold? How is that the problem of "nice guy"? Nobody forced anyone else to buy these recipes for such exorbitant prices. Maybe don't spend so much on a recipe. It's a free market.
---
If I find the cure for cancer, I'm not going to charge $50,000 for it. I'm giving it away for free. Same difference.
---
But there is already big changes in classic like spellqueue and also way too many people on a server without adjusting spawn times on outdoor resources like mobs/hebs/ores.
---
So the ratio between resources/players is wack making everything way more expensive now when they remove layering.
---
i feel like bg's will not improve the situation much.
---
while ppl wait in que they will still go around in groups killing ppl to max honor gains..
---
It used to be balanced. 60/40, then the servers  split and it went down by 10%, then two more horde guilds moved here from underpopulated horde servers. It is their fault.
---
The game is dead on imbalanced pvp servers. Unsub/uninstall they aren’t going to fix it. It was a nice run
---
Well Ok, is your point not to reserve then? They're free to not join his group.
---
&gt; objectively
---
I dont think you know what that means.
---
This is not the whole truth, and information flow was definitely different back then. Sure, there were forums, and yes, different VoiP options existed aeons before, but information flow was WAY different. So many people were (relatively) clueless compared to now, when there's been 15 years worth of raiding, hundreds of bosses with different mechanics, videos and written guides left and right, min/max theorycrafting done every way possible and god knows how many years of pserver play for some people.
---
Also, "boomer discord", wut?
---
plenty of people make €4000 a month or more.  It's not really weird to have $1000,-   a month to throw around on hobbies.   You can spend it on a sports car or scuba diving, or music or  traveling or...  a video game....
---
You know you can just ghost-run into the instance right?
---
You need to check the faction balance. The game is dead on most pvp servers if you pick the victim faction
---
You need to get talents that increase stealth.  
---
I recently respecced and didn't pickup 5/5 talent that "increase stealth".  
---
Previously I could sneak all LRBS to the last boss without any issues. Now first mob pack detect me from 5 meters and I can't get inside.
---
This was a stimulating response
---
Jaa genau die Gilden kenne ich auch noch :D Schöne Zeit haha
---
I was making a joke about boomer discord. None of these arguments are still relevant to the main counter argument that you don’t need enhanced optimization / communication to flock around in mobs of 20 mowing down people walking to BRM.
---
Pussssssyyyyy :)
---
None! That's a name i used since WotLK
---
Gnomes on mine .They start a fight they can't finish
---
This is top tier content
---
Play dumb games, get dumb prizes. The guy is literally named Sandcasino after the Old School Runescape duel arena which is probably the largest hub of scammers in any MMO in history. Kinda says it all
---
well, why waste time and energy? We are just off to our next "possible" victim.
---
Your servers all sound crazy. Haven’t seen a crafting fee bigger than 20g on mine
---
Nah, it was my network just dropping
---
19 Warrior myself. Should be good fun.
---
Could I solo DM:E with my lock (herbalist), then walk into the same Dungeon ID with my warrior for the rich thorium veins?
---
Hmm, I do jump runs, I shard anything worth more as ingredients. Each boss gives me, what 5-7g worth of loot at best? Once in 10 chance I get a essence of water? A bit more on the last boss? 8 mins? Interesting, you literally have to skip pretty much all you can right? So no loot from trash mobs really, then your other source of gold is a few herbs and the ores. When you factor in chance of arcane crystals and blue sapp, that's what 5g worth of loot from each or AT BEST on average? Yea, sorry, 5 runs an hour that does not add up to 200g or 100g per person. The math doesn't add up. I'm still interested in learning where all that gold you claim is coming from.
---
&gt;invest and if you only make 50g/hour it's still 10times that once Naxxramas comes out. 
---
Yea that's BS. You can get 10x returns when the game was new b/c everything was cheap. That's not happening now on any scaleable measure. I have a few thousand gold, if you think I'm wrong, I'd love to hear what to invest in to get 10x return. I already have bank alts filled with things that WILL sell for more later, assuming blizzard doesn't change spawn rates like my guildies who got burned stockpiling devilsaur leathers. But 10x returns? Lol come on.
---
&gt;If you farm herbs in the open world without BL scouts you are certainly not part of the people who have knowledge of the game. Farming herbs has long gone from being a serious moneymaker combined with mining in the first weeks to pitiful pennies. I'm not talking about the demographic that thinks its a good idea to farm RTVs in EPL on a sunday afternoon.
---
Black lotus on timers on my alt. Obviously.
---
&gt;I'm on Venoxis mass scale PvP like on Gehennas does not happen as often.
---
That explains a lot. What top guilds are there on your server? Where do they place on clear times?
---
&gt;If your people cant manage to get into the game before they are at home, they are not in the crowd that is considered top. 
---
Your whole point is about how some casual full time working guy can sustain in a high end guild. Either you add an extra 2 hours per raid night to your time estimate so they can log in early and not afk out or shut up about people missing raid times due to 2 hour queues. Isn't it interesting how when we dissect the time commitment, it adds up more and more? Now you expect them to remote log in at work and on the drive home? Lol seriously dude wtf?
---
&gt;Some noob didnt get into queue early enough? You have 2-3 people waiting on the bench.
---
Interesting, so it seems almost like people with full time jobs is gonna have some trouble raiding with top tier raids
---
.
---
&gt;Our top raiding guilds raids every two weeks before and after the reset, so they dont have respec for PvP as often. To farm every two weeks for an hour is half an hour a week. 
---
That's standard for pvp. And lol you think when Naxx comes out you're farming an hour and a half a week is going to cut it?
---
Lol there is way more ,most servers are balanced
---
not going to happen, but if you can clear MC that's a nice achievement.
---
sounds pretentious as shit
---
Shit that always happens to me - I gouge a mob (with talents, my gouge lasts 5,5 seconds), and then, after 3 seconds I eviscerate him to finish the mob off, but get hit by that mob before he dies. Basically, the mob should only awaken from gouge due to damage, damage that instantly kills him, so there is no way he should be hitting me, yet this happens every time.
---
I can't say for sure but I seem to have memories of my guild clearing raids before we transferred back in vanilla in order to do them again.
---
I know, it's almost as if it had something to do with tone and the way he worded his reply.
---
Thanks for the reply and linking the source, I've missed this interview. Much appreciated!
---
Average ticket time for me (I just got my reply today) was 2 days 13 hours xD fairly sure it took 3 as well. Poor GMs.
---
I just waited about 60 sec and it was fine.
---
No need for macros, you can keybind every individual mark in the keybindings menu. I have skull, cross, moon and star on keys as I use those most often. Allows me to mark super fast on the fly.
---
Is there a new data for server populaions?
---
actually that's what i ended up doing last time. There was this fresh 60 night elf warrior that always was taunting back mobs from me, I just gave up, let him tank I do'nt care
---
I went instead to help the MT1 and maintained t-clap and demo shout at all times, also saved the sunders stack from dropping quite a few times. I know it helps a lot, but it also goes totally unnoticed, it's a ungrateful job to do
---
To a degree I think it makes sense. Rogues definitely benefit from the element of surprise and don't tend to do AS well in prolonged combat.
---
People are camping flight paths, and important areas of the world to farm honor.
---
They use an addon that basically tracks and alerts them when enemy players get close.
---
Don't leave a guild just for one person... You joined this guild for your friends too.  
---
Address these things with your guildmaster or loot council or whatever you have set up in your guild. Let them handle it. You're saying the rest of the people are fine, but this one dude is messing things up for you. Would be a shame to leave an entire guild because one person is an ass.
---
Servers far from dead, it's still very populated and has some very good pserver guilds on either side.
---
Making people want to move to the server much better than forcing things
---
read the FAQ or you will get banned. don't ask me how, but they will know if you read the FAQ or not.
---
Assassination is "all in the forced crit" with no sustain.
---
Combat is the only spec with sustain, and is the spec worst for pvp.
---
Sorry to necro your post but I had to come here and thank you for the time and effort. This addon is EXACTLY what I needed.
---
Mage here.
---
If you whisper me in the city as a random for some water I expect you to pay. I charge 1g for 4 stacks of lvl55 water.
---
If you are in my party for a shared goal you will get anything you need for free, portals water food. I won't charge you because we are in this together for the same end goal.
---
I agree the expectation of him is absurd and not in line with most mages I encountered.
---
This is completely untrue.  
---
There are several benefits of playing on the lesser populated faction. One of them is having instant queues for battlegrounds in a few weeks.
---
Anything related to PvP gets the shitstorm rolling on this sub. 
---
If you want to light the shitstorm on fire, blame it on the horde (as seen here).
---
Just how I remember it from my pserver. But the good thing is that BG's will be cross-realm, you guys have no idea how lucky you are about this. If the bgs arent cross-realm, the dominant faction on a server will have longer BG queues, since most likely they are more numerous and likely better at pvp, so the less dominant faction will queue less. So to compensate for that the dominant faction will start camping everything or rather continue camping, atleast till a BG pops... Thank Blizzard for cross realm BG's seriously! Can't imagine how bad it feels to be 24/7 camped at chillwind, TP, Menethil Harbour etc... Must suck.
---
Hunter. Can also look into Druid or Warlock.
---
I will be avoiding 39 like the plague. 
---
Everyone and their moms will be in full SM gear so when everyone's a twink, no ones a twink. Might as well not even be thinking. 
---
29 is where it's at. With full engineering, you can use sapper charges and 1 shot people
---
The idea of running around for minutes on end just to find one poor soul and then zerg him down is not what I consider fun, challenging, or even why I enjoy PvP in the first place.
---
There might be merges and paid transfers at some point.
---
This is great.
---
lower level zones are alright, atleast on my server. searing gorge and the likes are just no-go zones if you are on the less populated faction. wanna do lbrs/ubrs/brd? well u better wanna do it more than once cause it'll take you as long to get there as to actually do the dungeon.
---
I make 600$ a month
---
If you havent leveled there yet try azshara. There are typically less allies there than any other zone at that level
---
You luckily can queue to them from the cities.
---
Other then threat always mark your targets with skull and X/cross before pulling. Dps will focus skull but watch for Dps cleave threat.
---
You cant break it into how much its worth. Then wheres the limit? When is it acceptable, at what sellprice? If you press need for BoE for selling it you shouldnt have a problem of anyone doing the same on a BoP.
---
Your bis isn’t really tier I don’t know why all the the drama.
---
This reads like an UberDanger video
---
sapper charges
---
That’s what people keep telling him!
---
The clear answer here, is Paladin. Easy to level, although a bit slower than hunter. Got the possibility of going both tank and healer for you to try out other aspects of the game.
---
Yeah but think of how much he saved by buying a whole year!
---
No, never.
---
So alliance won
---
reroll, my bad. Or respec wingclip build nightfall. As other stated :D

[Blue post from before classic release talking about how batching was implemented](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/spell-batching-in-classic/137118): 
---
&gt;**For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12.** Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other’s original location.
---
They changed implementation of batching to attempt to recreate situations like yours artificially.
---
you can make it tho, you die 10-20 times, get in the dungeon and complete it.  It's like playing the game on hard mode.  Something the horde cannot say they did (except on heartseeker apparently).
---
While you’re right that it won’t fix it completely, there WILL be less WPvP once BGs hit. 
---
As for OP: if you want an experience that is more similar to Vanilla I’d suggest rolling on a medium server.
---
Yea, you are my type of man. This is the TRUE hunter experience!
---
The deadliest weapon of them all...
---

As an alliance player on ashbringer. If you're red. You're dead. Sorry that you were ganked over and over but I assume if you're in ungoro that means you are at least level 48. You're worth honor and a kill on site for anyone. 
---
Horde do it to us. We do it to you. It's the cycle of the pvp system. Don't come here blaming us for the nature of the game.
---
Er sorry?  The 'only' battleground alliance ever win?
---
Idk what I don't like about alliance on my server at least is that they never had the will to fight back. Even when we had even numbers they would rather run away or corpsewalk instead of fighting.  
---
Other than that I just love how orcs look in high level heavy armor/plate.
---
Wiping with right. Scrolling with left..
---
On the other hand he made some good exp and possibly money. So why not.
---
Got another clicker here bois.

I leveled 1-60 on Noggenfogger EU and jumped ship after like three weeks at 60 when I saw how badly the alliance was lagging behind. Can't imagine those guys are having an easy time of it right now.
---
Yeah people don’t seem to get that they’re nothing more than a quest mob to rankers
---
Peoples perspective has already started to shift and 60/40 is being called "balanced"
---
In some languages it translates to "shit".
---
Incendius sounds like the promised land
---
Onixya axe x2 no doubt
---
Interesting, i think you're mainly refering to the deathsquads tho, and these can ofc sadly be found in every zone.
---
I'm mostly referring to simple 1v1 encounters, and unless you find someone farming at sartyrs, you generally dont find anyone.
---
Also, yesterday, the 20.11, i started running in to the squads in felwood at about 17.00, me and the guild Warlords formed a group and ran all the squads out of there haha.
---
tranq tomb should always be loot-councilled because it's needed for progression. If there's enough tranq shot in the raid already, then it doesn't matter where it goes as it's superfluous.
---
If the rules were straight up rolling and the random won it all by rolls, that is honestly fair. But we use roll + 1 to cancel out exactly that kind of luck.
---
I think OP is pointing out that he has much less HKs and honor that other high rankers get on PvP servers, showing that its clearly doesn't require as much grinding, this being a positive.
---
If mobs are higher level than you they will see you easier. Nothing to do with the rank of the ability I'm afraid.
---
I like the current game state.  It's like playing on hard mode.  Something 95% of the horde can not attest to.
---
mAyBE U sHOUld hAVE rOlleD pVe

Anything under epic BoE is a pretty standard limit. BoE epics can range anywjere from 20g-900g depending on what drops (20g if you're lucky for a dogshit epic like icemail jerkin, or 900g for an awesome item like hand of Edward the odd). Anytime a purple boe drops in a pug full of people I dont know, I will always say "all need". Purely because it wont upset anyone because it will ALWAYS be fair.
---
was the first thing I did read and it solved majority of my questions
---
It isn't fun for anybody. This is a trainwreck patch lmao.
---
Play healer in raids, but say you pass on the actual good healing gear if you get prio on Lawbringer instead. That way you have a great set for PvP Reckoning Retribution. When Alterac Valley comes out, you can then grind for The Unstoppable Force with fantastic ret stats.  
---
In BWL, just do the same. Pass on the healer items to the other palas, and go for Judgement armor.
---
It's funny how my observations turned out in practice when only I am using the conclusions of my theorycrafting.
---
Depending on the length of the encounter I'm either 1st or last in HPS. Rarely am I in the middle-field.
---
I'm playing a 24-0-27-Druid, specialized in mana-efficiency of my Healing-Touch. I use Healing-Touch almost exclusively except for when I have to move during healing, where I use Rejuvenation.
---
In some encounters I don't heal at all simply because thanks to "healcom" I can see in advance that it would become overheal.
---
I mostly use downranked casts due to the fact that most people don't even have enough of a health-pool for my biggest heals to fit in. But I usually try to not heal when I think others will and when I think others won't I pick the targets for the biggest heals (I use 4 different ranks so I have a wide selection to avoid overheal).
---
More coordination would surely help but if one or two healers consider themselves as the mana-preserving-backup rather than the ones trying to be the fastest, it usually works out... in MC.
---
I think Druids and Priests are pretty similar in how they can heal. The Hots of both classes, even when specced into, can't really compete with their big-heals and in my opinion are situational tools.
---
I don't have the expertise to talk about shaman-healing, so I won't. But I can talk about Paladins and acknowledge that they work completely differently from Priests and Druids.
---
They have a 1.5-sec-cast spell called "Flash of Light", which has a very low HPS when compared to their big heal and that of priests and druids. But it has insanely good mana-efficiency.
---
This means that for a paladin my findings don't really apply. They actually seem to do best when constantly spamming their tiny, yet very mana-efficient heal.
---
I think that priests are most suitable to take the rule of mana-conservators who only start healing when others have problems keeping the raid up. The reason for that is that they have the best Spirit-Regenration and that they can wand from a long distance to do free damage without risking to get hit by AoE.
---
For Alliance I'd say: Paladins provide the base-healing, as they benefit the least from taking breaks and the most from constantly casting. If paladin-healing ain't enough, druids chime in and if that's not enough either, priests do.
---
For encounters with several tanks, I found you should always have one person who has the responsibility for a tank, regardless of any other concerns. The most frequent reason for sudden-tank-deaths was noone feeling responsible and damage being underestimated.
---
Wont be fair to the guy who actually needs it as an upgrade
---
As a mage, if you're in my group you get 2 or 3 stacks of water for free. Can receive more upon request as long as the group isn't busy fighting or something. 6 stacks of lvl 55 waters is like a mana bar and a half so it's a lot to ask for outside of city. So F that mage making us generous mages look greedy.
---
BG's are a big thing on PvE realms, a lot of PvE players don't hate PvP they just want control of when it happens. I haven't touched southshore fights (they are still a thing but not as big) but I will be spamming BG's tons
---
You can't. It will have aggro radius of level 37 character and will pull half of instance.
---
DBM says im at 58 angerforge kills and still haven’t seen HoJ drop. The guildy healer I run with has seen exactly one trinket off of golem lord in 112 kills and he lost that roll to a mage at about 30 runs in. Sometimes RNG and peoples inabilities to read stack up for major “fuck this” sentiments.
---
You misinterpreted his comment. Once he gets into BRD he just keeps running it over and over and over (until his gear is red).
---
&gt;You get a standing no matter what. 
---
https://imgur.com/GHPfz3F
---
&gt;But he is Alliance, so if he rerolls Horde it will make the problem worse
---
I realize he'll bring his lack of skill to The horde.
---
But he complains about there being too much alliance, so we are where we are.
---
Yeah the first guy making them in Stalagg was charging like 250 and even that was a bit steep for having to press a button
---
Thats literally an article article about layoffs in 2012, dated march 2012.
---
Sweet god the centaur ear quest.
---
Fuck you Ion
---
You do realize they dont kill you for any other reason than that you give honor right?
---
Even with them being CR-BGs. I don't think it's going to stop the dominate faction from roaming around while they wait for their queue to pop.
---
It'll depend, but my experience during Retail-Vanilla, was ~20 minutes to get into AV, ~35 minutes for AB, and damn near an hour for WSG (this was before WSG had a timer).
---
i´m an idiot then ..
---
Seems unlikely.
---
&gt; i loudly screech OwO in real life 
---
lost it
---
Idk, PvE is not my thing I guess. I do want a PvP server, but a balanced one.
---
First dungeon for Alliance players is 18-22. So keep leveling.  
---
Also main quest there start from level 16, IIRC.
---
So it does not look similar to the video for either faction there?
---
I played alliance in vanilla and it was never close to being this bad. You would encounter maybe one or two raids inside BRM trying to get into MC or BWL, but there weren't ten roaming packs of horde.
---
The server population cap is just too high for such small areas.
---
Tracking Hidden doesn't work that way. It increases stealth detection a bit and shows the stealthed entity on minimal ONLY if you already see him stealthed, meaning you gotta be standing just a couple yards away for it to work. It doesn't really make it any more trivial than the Paranoia from Warlock's Felhunter pet...
---
I don't. I pretty much only raidlog now, or log in to farm a dungeon.
---
It's estimated we outnumber alliance 60:40. We own BRM. We own the Onyxia gate. Both sides have roving gank squads patrolling farm zones. I can't farm or run a route for 10 minutes without getting killed by 5+ people. It's the same for Alliance. I have had a single 1v1 PvP encounter since honor was released. 
---
It's not fun. It wasn't like this in vanilla. I played exclusively on PvP servers for years but, if this keeps up, it will make me regret not rolling PvE.
---
The guy who needed it as an upgrade? Literally a zero percent chance he was expecting it to drop. Any BOE epic that is actually someone's BiS is INSANELY rare AND valuable for a reason and you'll never possibly be able to go out and farm it.  If he feels entitled to it, he is LITERALLY saying he is entitled to the gold it brings since he no longer has to buy it like every other class that shares his BiS list.
---
You should enable VODs because if you don't stream often there's no way for most people to see your content

---
Here're a few, enjoy.
---
Source on BG's? People say this but haven't found proof
---
Do you actually believe this?
---
Are you not listening at all?  Nost did not handle more people.  It had 1% of the current player base at best.  This isn't a server to server comparison because the way realms were implemented are not the same.
---
Yes that is possible, just invite a friend, log on the alt and get the friend to inv the alt. That way you can be in party with yourself, and thus get the same dungeon ID.
---
It's a mistake but not the worst one you can make. Your best neck is Animated Chain Necklace off Rammstein in Strat UD.
---
Stupid when there are 2 super simple changes that could eliminate the unworthy bans, while keeping the benefit of right click a name to start a report.
---
- when an auto ban flags, make a GM see it BEFORE the ban happens, rather than reacting to the ban or name change, put the human in much earlier in the process.
---
- fucking punish the people doing false reports. store the account details and after X false reports give THEM the ban.
---
It's fucking crazy that after what, 5 or more years with it in retail that they havn't bothered to improve the system in the slightest. I stand by the idea of the quick report option it's the shitty automation that is the problem. It's ludicrous that people can lose game time and names because of bad tools.
---
I’m sure all of these cry baby posts are going to make the Horde stop killing you. 
---
I hope they see this, bro.
---
Thank you so much, I will enable them just now!
---
I am well aware of that... Thats the reason I made a rogue instead of my usual classes of preferrence. I was, and still against playing on a pvp server since people tend to confuse world pvp with camp everyone and everything that is operated by a human being.
---
Currently reading on toilet
---
Jup
---
Seriously even with faction imbalance the whole point of a PvP server is PvP. Fuck anyone who needs to get to raid, farm gold, or farm gear. You came here to die.
---
Is this a bug ? My buffs are stacking as intended. I check my crit and AP stat before and after buffs
---
Anyone, but not everyone. Most seem to stick to their starting continent.
---
You may not be, but others are. They chose to roll on a PVP server; knowing PVP would happen. Then complain because said PVP isn't going their way. ((Think about it, all these PVP Complain threads. Would they exist if said OP's faction was dominate and/or **they**, personally, were winning most PVP Fights.))
---
I never heard about the pop caps, I still knew a PVP server would be a horrible choice. So....someone with zero on-hand info, still knew it was a bad idea to roll on a PVP Server.
---
Blizzard upped the pop caps to save on needing to merge servers later. Like take SWTOR, they opened up dozens of new servers during 'launch week'....by week 3, most of those servers with "Low" populations and people were complaining "my server's dead".
---
I suppose what they could have done was upped the PVE realm pop caps, but kept PVP caps low. Then just made more PVP Realms.
---
Heartseeker.
---
Exactly how lvl 60 gnome warlocks are in my server.
---
What are you smoking? All +AP items give RAP to hunters
---
Thanks for replying for me. As others have said I was referring to the title which is 100% about its always sunny. 
---
Also, the “generous god” line reminds me of Dennis The Golden God.
---
I agree, nobody who joins a group where reserves were clearly stated has a right to complain. I’m just saying it’s not true that reserves make loot distribution better for everyone. They only directly help the person doing the reserving.
---
Objectively speaking, in my WoW experience, my enjoyment of the game has been much higher through PvE servers than PvP servers except for a few pretty cool moments like large-scale OW PvP that is relatively balanced.
---
I also come from a background of Lineage 2, where PvP can happen anywhere but it has consequences if the other party doesn't effectively "consent" or "flag" for PvP. You can still kill them, but then you risk dropping your items if you get killed before you work off (through EXP or dying in a controlled scenario) your negative karma.
---
I've always enjoyed BG's where the (number) balance is at least enforced and fairness is, while not perfect, more attainable.
---
Yes, not sure which version of the Quest we are getting.
---
There were 2 Versions, 1 was kill Korrak (Spawns after 2 Hour in the middle) the other was win 1 AV.
---
Yes, but no, but technically, yes.
---
I wish I had the 5,000 lockpicking skill to open it.
---
Those character frames are neat, what are those?
---
Is this not a form of exploiting the market or whatever its called. I'm not 100% accurate on all the ToS related stuff so do correct me if I am wrong, but if everyone is charging for Lionheary crafts and then 1 person does them for free is that not exploiting the market?
---
Combat daggers is hella fun.
---
There's actually 100s of horde in BRM camping the instance. 90 showing up on Spy only means 90 casting an ability within range. There are actually 2-300 of them surrounding and infesting BRM inside and out. They outnumber alliance 4-1 on the server. There is no possibility to fight back in any meaningful way.
---
If that's what you want to believe
---
Don't balance the game around people who spend their lives on it. Not our fault you rushed through everything
---
I agree, i think it has the perfect amount of players on it, the way classic was meant to be played.
---
No shame, this is amazing. This is one of those unpredictable advantages of shit PvP right now.
---
similar on kromcrush as well as we at least were more balanced at one point
---
only too 4 deaths to get to UBRS last night as a rogue. the non rogues were closer to 10. 
---
At least we got that damn trinket for the last person who needed it so i never have to go back there unless its a raid night
---
Victim blaming. I like it
---
I have had good experiences doing this exact thing, makes a huge difference SS&gt;WW on pull
---
Probably good gear in your case, I hear people respec around 40 because the damage output is more steady (not random) and the gear is similar to resto, so you don't have to carry around many extra pieces for healing dungeons. 
---
To know what your 60 damage will be like, get relevant buffs and do a dungeon dropping no damage totems and using no spells - only autos + WF, maybe SS. That will be your approximate damage output in a raid, since Mana will be too tight to use ES/FS.
---
cringe
---
As a Zandalar Tribe horde player, I can assure you the server is far from balanced. RP(-pvp) servers always tend to be Alliance heavy, but the balance difference is very noticeable on ZT.
---
I think everyone is equally whiny here man. Hell, even the OP seems a bit salty.
---
He is also the most liked. Popularity is crazy.
---
Update - All of these players have transferred to the realm Earthshaker PVP (you can test this by adding them to your friends list while logged on)
---
I have submitted a ticket to have their items removed so I am hoping a GM gets back to me about this case.
---
why did they bring a non 60 then unless it was an alt run.
---
But it doesn't go deep into combat, atleast for PvP. You typically just pick up imp. sprint for PvP
---
i really love all the people who keep saying shit like "it was like this in vanilla"
---
no, no it was not, i played then and there were never hundreds of 1 faction just camping inside BRM/gorge/steps at nearly all hours of the day
---
&gt; , bolstered by an addon that reports voluntary numbers
---
that addon was killed in like early October tho
---
It shows the coordinates you were at when the player was detected. There is no way for the addon to determine their position through the combat log
---
Darwin awards are for people who die
---
&gt;I assume you are a part of cold fusion
---
I'm not from Cold Fusion.
---
&gt;Also ascendants did not buy it to screw us over, you bought it from them to screw us over. 
---
Originally it was on the auction house and Ascendants bought it from what I heard. Didn't know that they sold it to Cold Fusion, which honestly does sound like Cold Fusion is trying to dick you guys. 
---
&gt;Why would we report the guy spamming he is charging 50 when we literally make it for free. 
---
Considering Bam's reputation of being an incredibly insensitive asshole that flips out over anything, it would honestly not surprise me. Hopefully you guys weren't behind that shit but your guild's reputation of being assholes doesn't help.
---
Again since I'm not directly involved in this shitshow, this is all second-hand information to me and I'm not familiar with who had the recipes, just that Eternal wasn't getting Lionheart Helms because of Bam. Either way I'm not a fan of mass reporting, whether it be towards Karnij or anyone in Eternal. Hopefully a GM does something about this, preferably a mass ban of Cold Fusion.
---
how did this get 800 upvotes
---
im going to try one
---
Haha yeah baffles me too. Go horde woohoo!
---
When i'm wrong i'm wrong, WSG and Alterac Dec 10th just announced in a blue post apparently.
---
Just hover over the macros on the bar with your mouse and the icons should appear
---
Hardly a scam if you got your investment back
---
Pathetic
---
Yeah, alliance roaming gangs will occasionally wipe the horde, but quickly leave before they get swarmed and camped as well.
---
Guy would have been added to my ignore list, guildie or not
---
No, everyone always ganked everyone and always in unfair matchups
---
Hunter pets in Scholo. I still wake up bathed in sweat.
---
With the added benefit of being ganked while attacking a mob, and then letting you get stunlocked so the mob kills you so you take durability damage.
---
But then you won’t have any alliance to kill and you will quit the game out of boredom...
---
copycat
---
exactly doing this comrade. Lok'tar!
---
psure alliance are not able to transfer off the servers where they are the minority
---
Awesome! thank you, really new to classic just trying to get a grip on everything.
---
Never said you couldn't find any topic, just that they were always rare in comparaison of the flood of memes and complain about the popular complain of the month.  I mean you can find post describing the honor system these days and people discussing how to speed run MC.
---
But in the end there's just nothing to talk about: everything has been figuring out and there's no theorycrafting left to be made. People have their BiS list, no PvE content to clear and PvP at the moment is just a matter of who can gather the most people.
---
We could discuss changes, balance or new raids but... people spam "go retail" at any suggestions.
---
Your group your rules.
---
He was an idiot who should learn to read.
---
You won't.
---
Its cross realm queues.
---
Ha, WHOOPS. TY. 
---
There is still a 2-3 value difference between many logs/profiles that I’ve checked but it seems that this is because the log report is comparing only parses from the last 2 weeks while the profile page compares against all historical data.
---
healers too lol
---
Don't worry, the casuals did all the bitching and crying already in order for this to happen.
---
Says the guy who's probably on horde aka pve server 2.0
---
Hahha you’re a reddit troll. 
---
ILL START with the important item here for you: 
---
Paranoia did NOT have click targeting, nor did it tell you positioning. 
---
READ THROUGH THE CHANGE LOG. It shows that nothing even close to the current version of spy existed until LATE into tbc. 
---
I used paranoia in burning crusade for arenas and it was NOTHING close to what spy is today. I didn’t use it when it had click targeting... and CERTAINLY in its original version before it added a ton of features.   
---
It WAS really good for giving you spell casts &amp; telling you that somebody stealthed (no coordinates, no targeting) . That was it’s purpose back once a time. 
---
So you are the idiotic masses. Nice try though. You never had this app in vanilla, probably didn’t even play vanilla, and have no fucking clue what you’re talking about.
---
Meh - I got two or three month's worth of discount for prepaying, so I guess it's a wash.
---
To be met with "corpse not in instance" messages sure
---
Hi, /u/AuditoryCheese

---
Its stupid. Such handholding garbage
---
Why are horde players so god damn edgy lmao
---
I love it, do you have recordings with raids/dungeons? I'd like to see some.
---
The census is shit, nobody uses the extension anymore since blizzard blocked automatic /who api calls and that was more than a month ago. The new version of the addon sends /who commands by binding into your random clicks, but that only works if people thought of going into the options and ticking the boxes, and anyways when the original addon was blocked by blizzard most people just gave up and uninstalled and never gave it another thought.
---
On my server, there is almost no data for alliance and literally no data for horde. Also if you take any random server and look at the population over time you can see some pretty chaotic lines, and that's a pretty good indicator that data is rarely uploaded and thus not very reliable
---
Loot and gold are top priority. I used dkp during wotlk. It worked well since our raid group stayed consistent for 90% of the content so everyone got loot eventually. Guild leadership is everything. If it’s BiS, then previous loot shouldn’t matter.
---
HoJ is a ~4,8% drop. 
---
0,952^58 = 0,05767 = 5,767%
---
So yea, you're a bit unlucky but what's happened to you happens to every 17th player farming HoJ so it's not unusual at all. JaguarDTM's claim for example is 9.050.000 times less likely, which is why I'm saying he's talking out of his ass. Imagine you did 300 runs for HoJ without seeing it drop. That's STILL !!6000!! more likely to happen than what he described.
---
Same with your friend. Sure, he's really, really unlucky but every 387th other person is just as lucky as he is. Once again, comparing to the outragous claim from JaguarDTM, that's about 400.000th as likely as what he claims to have happened to him in UBRS. 
---
I'm well aware that RNG can sometimes fuck with you but a lot of people are just making shit up.
---
This dude Sandcastino has been on my kill on sight list for literally 2 months lmao. I'll avenge you buddy
---
Plot twist: Hunter used feign death!
---
I think that chest you mention and one by the stairs near the frost trap in the next room are the only two ive ever seen in dm
---
Prolly cuz the hordes of people saying that if you're not on a pvp server you're not really playing the game
---
no
---
Pvp isn't the issue; obviously if I didn't want to fight other players at all i woulda rolled on pve; and while I had my frustration from time to time before p2, getting ganked was motivation to get better at the game to have a chance to fight back and score some revenge kills. This isn't that anymore. You don't learn shit from getting fucked by raidgeared people 10 levels higher than you roving around in bands oneshotting any target they see that's not grey, at this point I'm a trash mob in their eyes, something you grind for a marginal reward all day long. You don't have fun, you don't get to quest, you can try running to an instance if you have the energy and time to waste up to an hour staring at a grey screen inching slightly closer to the entrance with each death, but I play video games to unwind after a long day at work, and right now playing on my main feels like more work , what's the point if I'm not having fun, not making progress, not learning how to improve, may as well do something else until this gets better.
---
My irl friends are major asshole. They will host a Ony pug on Gehennas today. Ninja all the loot then transfer off.

Don’t join a Ony pug on Gehennas today. I don’t know if I can post their names here.
---
Oh cry me a river you baby pally :^)
---
Me too
---
Most do group runs, no solo
---
Implying warriors get to tank raids willy nilly. You have to suck metric tons of dick to get a raid tank spot on most servers.
---
it was never like this in vanilla. people are full of shit when they say it was
---
the servers were not large enough to support it.
---
Well, game is about the war between horde and alliance, of course the game was meant to be PvP!
---
Jep, but currently not very active. Most of my friends quit the game and I myself dont have much time on my hands right now :/
---
If you plan to level 100% exclusively in dungeons 50-60 then it will probably be a decent spec but still worse than protection.
---
I find that whirlwind helps A LOT with getting some extra aoe threat as well as solid dps.
---
Maybe 100k a year. I'm around 50k and after bills I can afford like one new game a month.
---
False.
---
Playercap in vanilla was around 3k, but dynamic with a max of around 4500. [Source.](https://i.imgur.com/yNWkujT.png)
---
Faerlina is as i understand, a high pop server with queue.
---
Max of 7.3k and an average of about 5k.
---
[Source.](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4408_Faerlina)
---
Higher than classic? Yes. 3-10 times higher than large realms? No.
---
Depends on the realm, but yes
---
Auto, aimed, auto, multi, feign, aimed. It's the ultimate opener unless 2+ crits and you have to fd early. It's so nice to get 3k threat removed instantly
---
Yep, better AFK 5 min once landing in IF
---
Just quit. If you like the game, reroll in another server (or transfer if able). Not worth dealing with that cancer. Fairbanks is the exact same and I’m about done too. Horde will just cry in several months when the world is empty.
---
&gt;Gear is the only thing that makes you officer material
---
&gt;what's game and class knowledge 
---
&gt;what's being personable
---
You’re wrong. Read my below post. Flat out lying dude it didn’t have click targeting and didn’t have coordinates which are the two MAJOR things that people don’t like about Spy. 
---
You probably won’t read the change log though, like you probably didn’t even play in vanilla and probably just use reddit to incite arguments.
---
Not really. This is the only game I've paid for in 5 years. I think the last game I bought was GTA5, used, at Gamestop. Actually, that's not true: I bought OOTP20 for 75% off in a Steam sale.
---
This costs way less than having a wife and children, and many wow dads can certainly pay for that.
---
Its sad when this passes as RP.
---
Except fury warriors are the top pve dps
---
Lol, what?
---
Luckily they will still have a queue. Horde is heavily populated and in a few weeks it’s going to be the “go back to retail” people complaining. Good. Fuck em.
---
be careful with that advice. As a new lvl 60 tank you still want mostly stamina and def, unless you're somehow a noob tank playing with OP healers, or else you'll just die and whipe the raid
---
Why even bother ninjaing ony loot? Unless you get lucky with weapon drops it's worth nothing, especially if you're hosting because then you can reserve whatever the hell you want.
---
Won't matter. Most servers are horde overpopulated, even with cross realm horde probably have 50% more players and will face bg wait times
---
Right lol, spells largely follow that rule, but gear does not.
---
Nah it did have targeting. It didn’t have coordinates true.
---
First time lvling a pally. Im about lvl 35 and want to ask at what lvl do i change from retry to holy? And which holy build should i follow? 
---
Because i saw lot of guides that put 31 in holy and rest in prot but i dont know why since in my opinion it would be better to put 31 holy and rest in retry so with this when u are not raiding u can farm/quest/pvp without changing specs right?
---
Near the frost trap\the Slip guard guy\next to the goblin guy or?
---
Tell Me When does it too
---
My friend and I d/c'd in a duel in BC in Terrokar Forest.  Both of our characters were online for 20 minutes bugged.  We logged onto other characters because we couldn't get in and took pictures next to ourselves.   It was funny!
---
On Stalagg we had only one guy who could craft it for a long time who was charging pretty steep prices from what I hear. Then right when someone else got the plan he dropped his price to free
---
try a mouseover macro
---
Man this is so funny because of how sad and true it is
---
Because they are saved in MC and wants to transfer this evening. They got most classes covered so someone is getting t2 head, bag etc.
---
Either that or click ur mountbind again. It works I promise!
---
Literally have yet to come across a comment as deserving of "OK boomer" as this one.
---
It's one of the only sorta balanced PvP servers in NA. So it's either that or dog shit massive imbalanced or dead  servers for most. And I ain't rerolling now. It's pretty easy to avoid the streamers btw. Faerlina is one of the better NA servers.
---
The Horde on this server are like a disease destroying this server from the the inside. What fun is there in playing a game you know you can’t lose?
---
You're right, he's wrong. Taunt equalizes your threat with the person with the highest threat, so if you have the most threat on that mob, it does nothing.
---
You mean like college football?   UCLA dresses like 110 guys, some schools they play dress half that.  But the small school gets paid to play the game, so I guess that's something.
---
Twins are so fucking boring, never understood the fun in it. You’ve got a super geared low level and you’re two shotting unequipped low levels, boooring
---
Noo noo, must've only been ~65% horde. Relatively tame, really.
---
Sorry, how did he throw his career away? Because he ninja'd an item? That incident put his average viewers on twitch up...
---
Or because he got dropped form an org that probably wasn't paying him fuck all anyway?
---
Like I don't agree with anyone ninjaing shit but all you people who are acting like this guy fucked his life up because he ninjad a piece of loot need to realise he didn't, and continuing to post acting like he did is mega weird.
---
Search "Mage solo Zf" on youtube and you'll get 1000+ hits
---
It's also useful for when you have to jump small distances
---
"It was great fun" says the guy that had nothing at stake.
---
Sounds like they made a smart choice. Why would they gear a casual player that skips raids and didn't bother to even farm the DM gear? You don't deserve loot priority over someone that puts in more effort.
---
They were four. End of story right there
---
Not G kicking someone over an honest mistake is a fucking low bar to set my guy.
---
Yup.
---
He should get gear before you for putting in more effort. Sounds like you’re getting carried through there with shitty gear.
---
A level 50 alliance hunter?! My hands are shaking. LOL! Thanks for the post man!
---
How did you get it running without admin privileges?!
---
&gt;All this salt, I love it lmao
---
Who hurt you babe?
---
In the same room as the frost trap, there is a group of two ogres to the right of the stairs and if im not mistaken ive seen a chest spawn by the bonfire next to them

flamestrike stacks, just re-confirmed.

My buddy and I are mid mid 40's on Rattlegore and he wants out. Questing in Tanaris and Feralas hasn't been that bad, but I can see where we are headed. I am hoping after BG's come out it calms down a little.
---
Film is "Edge of Tomorrow"
---
I agree. At 56 i have managed to scrounge 1/2 level.
---
On Shazzrah-EU Alliance side there is currently only 2 crafters, thus the high price.
---
i copied my fully installed client to a flash drive and i was all good from there, now to hope the school doesnt block it lul
---
You mean AFK strikes. I saw a rogue in org killing flagged afkers. I killed him twice only for him to vanish permanently.
---
If I had to guess this will shed some light... A memory ACCESS\_VIOLATION is typically a bad stick of ram.  The application is trying to write to memory, and the address the memory manager told it to use was unreadable/writable.  
---
If memtest says you're good(no errors) for about an hr it is very likely your RAM is fine.  Very rarely have I found it reporting good for the first hour only to fail later.  Just my 2cp  GL!
---
There's no reason another human who pays the same sub as you should be in a punitive death queue because of their choices 2 months ago on a character screen.
---
&gt; Kinda annoying that they try to claim moral highground.
---
When I'm out ganking with my alliance friends, if we stumble upon a lowbie, even if they still yield honor, and they attack him, I just stand back because I want nothing to do with it. So I'm going to claim moral highground, but not because I'm alliance, because we obviously (as I've seen my own friends) do that shit as well.
---
Theres a saying that says, “You are who you associate with.” If you associate with people that act a certain way, do certain things, etc, thats who YOU are too.
---
I wouldn’t sent him all the orbs and all that. Just tell him you are really sorry, a guide told you it was an upgrade and it the heat of the moment you needed it. You are willing to put more groups together to help him get it. We ran 3 back to back to back runs for thay for a guildie, it took 80 minutes for all 3 runs.
---
It’s not fun for either side. The problem is most of us rolled on a pvp server because we enjoyed pvp. A lot of us played on 60:40 pservers and assumed this would be the same; turns out it’s not. You can’t shame horde players for wanting to do what they pay $15/month to do. Blizzard should’ve had faction queues day 1.
---
Most honor farmed class+spec combo too.
---
[no targeting ](https://imgur.com/a/hzPsxrR) 
---
It didn’t have targeting until well into BC. Legit used this in arena to know when rogues stealthed &amp; whether to silence certain spells... it did not have any form of targeting.
---
It's just satire.  Chill dawg.
---
BRE
---
Would work better without the quotation marks around "mechanically outplayed", since whole post is satire so no reason to highlight it here, also would make it more seem like you mean it seriously, which is more funny.
---
Otherwise good copy pasta, rate 5/7
---
Yes. Just as many
---
god damn shadowcraft pants are driving me up the walk rn
---
That's pretty neat.  Does the ground dot last long enough to make this practical? Stacking two aoes?
---
No, PvP was a thing during early development of WoW as well. It was far from their focus, but they knew early on that they wanted the option to PvP. Primarily motivated by the fact a lot of the devs had been playing DaOC and EQ.
---
That said, they also experienced how broken pvp was in those games. They didn't expect WoW pvp to play out as well as it did
---
Lmao you seriously downvoted me for that. U mad bro?
---
Lmao no, elixirs and pots are fine. Flasks are a big no no for MC.
---
People say that same shit here and it gets upvoted "most people are not even 60 yet" is such a meme around here.
---
My eyes are bleeding, go easy on that contrast juice my dude
---
60 hunters, what are you feeding your pet? I like to fish for my food, but fish seem to cap out at level 45. Is that good enough to do the job at 60? I'm only high 40s right now, so it's not an immediate problem.
---
It doesn't bother me much because there's literally nothing at stake. From my understanding, the world on PVP servers are a lot more vibrant. There's just more happening everywhere. PVE servers has all the friendly folks though, and everyone is willing to help everyone else.
---
I used to play games like Tibia, RUST, Ultima Online. Dying in those games are a PITA, and it's so frustrating to farm for hours only to lose it all to some fuckface.
---
WoW is forgiving. Dying stings enough to fight to survive, but not enough to rage quit.
---
10/10 guild name
---
Not available for vanilla.
---
Also as I remember they've deactivated it for retail too. I remember logging into armory to sell things, sadly it's not available.
---
Just world PvP in general. Regardless of server size there were still Faction dominate PvP servers and I'm sure this happened just in less numbers.
---
Dreadmist has ~60% horde, according to Ironforge.pro.
---
That's almost twice as many horde as alliance.
---
Horde on skeram are actually pretty depressed about the state of the server from my experience. A good amount (though just a drop in the bucket really) transferred to heartseeker and most were fully in favor of faction specific transfers.
---
for anyone abt to comment to tell me to do my schoolwork, i do. this is exclusively to have something to do during my hour and a half free period i have every other day so i dont just sit there bored on my phone :)
---
Took me something like 20 kills to get it.... And then I saw it the next run I did.
---
We're always watching.
---
o_o
---
Jesus Christ. Sort of sad. You don’t even know these people, yet for 10 years you want to join them? Here’s what you do. Send them money, all you have. Do you have a girlfriend? If so, tell the mage class lead she’ll blow him if he accepts your apology. Then just continue to prostrate yourself publicly for a few weeks. That should do it.
---
I don't see anyone who doesn't understand the satire. They disagree with the intended message.
---
Even better, addons like that lie. Our true numbers come from the people of Azeroth and what I believe I see with my own eyes.
---
I never said that wasn't the case? I was simply replying to your comment that all mages do this.
---
Never seen second wind and I have over 25 kills of this dude
---
this isnt unique to horde, i got squelched for crafting hide of the wild for free as i got the pattern on day 1 and that pissed people off apparently
---
Could you elaborate on the the itemization point? If it's true that there's a lot more spell power and +healing in 1.12, that's a pretty big deal. Can you give examples of significant items that were added during vanilla, and when they were added?
---
I like how no one is owning up to doing his behavior when the majority of you grease balls are horde probably doing this exact thing. This is not what pvp should look like and you fucking know it ya cunts.
---
How is it bias when there’s plenty of posts from people claiming they’re quitting because they’re lvl ~50 after 3 months and can’t handle the wpvp?
---
Then why ask if there was and not asl what was the name?
---
Bonita dated Mar2012 foo! Stop trying to twist stories! O w o
---
Like a lot of people are saying, I don't like reserving loot in a pug. That said, so long as **you clearly state what you're reserving before the run starts, and when you're recruiting group members** it's fine. 
---
Some people won't join. Some will. It's fine really. You're not a bad person for doing it, everyone's got their reasons.
---
I'm pretty sure that macro won't work. There is no way to cast kick at a target other than the one your combo points are stacked on without deselecting your current target.
---
It works in other versions of the game because they changed how rogue/cat combat functions by allowing it to keep combo points when you select another target and return to your original
---
Clearly you don't play on faerlina. The vast majority of Olympus members are just regular players who wanted to join a big guild to get dungeon runs and join raids. Also I think most people thought it would be run better and not such a shit show. The vast majority of them are not there to worship him, that's really just a handful of them that follow him everywhere.
---
If it's a super rare item (SGC) I just 2 man it or three man with my second account and a healer so I don't have to look like a dick.
---
You sound upset.
---
Your link doesn't contradict him, you know. /u/Mchortons is saying those layoffs didn't apply to their customer support department, and nothing in the article you linked says otherwise.
---
Glad my guild transferred off Skeram.  Heartseeker has been a lot of fun.
---
Lol so salty.  
---
I kill level 40s for all the times I was ganked while I was peacefully leveling up.
---
don´t worry, I was just making fun. obvious i don´t care what other people tell me how i should play :) but thx
---
Yes. I know one.
---
This wasnt even tuesday’s Raid night, we were 2-3 alliance guilds walking in from Burnings Steppes side and once you got to the gate above MC entrance we got overrun by horde. Spy got up to 175 horde players, and im sure it was more
---
Best method is to ninja it.
---
it's still valid though that your rotation should aim to maximize threat, and only care about your survival in critical situations, like a boss enrage or your health not being capped off quick enough, in that case you can use more protective spells like shield block, last stand, even shield wall.
---
Upkeeping t-clap and demo shout though should be the job of another warrior.
---
No, you’re full or shit [oh hey - no targeting until late into BC](https://imgur.com/a/hzPsxrR)
---
They started again after reset, spent almost two hours on Rag then called it for the day.  Can probably watch them pick it up again today.
---
O i really did, thanks!
---
I'm sad you cut out the "ON YOUR FEET, MAGGOT!" every time he wakes up. Would've fit perfectly.
---
There was also a post from Blizz stating they fixed fd.. multiple times.  The issues people are having with fd are similar as the clunky issues it had in vanilla so it's pretty much fine the way it is.
---
Is the skill called Frostbolt?
---
I've all but quit and my server (Noggenfogger PvP) is 'only' 64% horde - and I play a druid, so I can generally escape the small horde squads of 2-3 players. 
---
I used to come home from work every day and play this religiously. Raid leading, officer role in my guild, almost got a 2nd char to 60, too. Down to raidlogging and exlusively leveling my alt in dungeons now. Fuck this shit.
---
Backpedaling works and so does standing stationary and then pressing w mid air
---
How is this toxic? If you can't loot the world boss, did you really win the fight? This is directly a mechanic on PvP servers.
---
Spy should have been banned months ago. Kinda late now, game is ruined.
---
I'm correcting, or enriching, his impression of what vanilla was like. My opinion about phases is probably that content "needs" to be released sooner to keep the minmax farmers engaged, but both the minmax farmers and the rushing of content releases ruins Classic for people who are playing the game in a manner similar to how they played Vanilla.
---
Seems very similar to the situation on Herod, glad to know we're not alone over here
---
LOL, good.
---
op confirmed lvl 50 nelf hunter who went AFK in a contested zone on a PvP server
---
I am also reading this on the toilet at work. I promise you.
---
PvE servers is heaven now. Reroll on the side and focus on raids only currently.
---
I would also like to know this
---
They pretty much have too, otherwise horde could never get in.
---
Also not confirmation but in Beta, PvP servers and PvE servers queued togethor.
---
If you have sweeping strikes I have a bunch of macros to make things easier but...
---
If you have rage from last pull, cast sweeping. and charge in. I have a zerker whirlwind macro so swapping over will gen a ton of initial threat just from WW and sweeping.  Then you go defensive and start applying sunders, and using revenge, maybe a cleave if a ton of rage is pooled.
---
 
---
If you want some macros I have a ton of very useful ones I'm willing to share.
---
So if the zebra first kicked the lions teath off, how did the lion bite off the raptors head?
---
You're better off just getting talents that increase your damage. Spending 5 crucial talent points on increasing stealth level will be detrimental to your ability to kill mobs. 
---
Get Improved Sinister Strike and Improved Gouge first, then keep going up combat.
---
I usually just run past these death balls, it just looks so embarrassingly pathetic that I actually cringe and don't want to be seen as part of it. I play on a balanced server, so I get that same feeling when I get deathballed by 10 Alliance, it just looks so lame.
---
I have a 45 alliance warrior on bigglesworth (took a P2 break) basically have to deal with pvp every other mob 1v3 you know the deal. Made a undead priest on Bennadiction, lvl 35 now, and I've been killed 3 times by the enemy faction. The alliance give me a WIDE birth even if I'm outnumbered, only time I pvp is when I actively look for trouble.
---
&gt; WoW is forgiving. Dying stings enough to fight to survive, but not enough to rage quit.
---
Yeah that varies from person to person. I tend to rage quit after the first time I get 1-shotted while I'm doing an escort quest or trying to kill a mob I cleared the way to. PvP servers just aren't for me at all lol.
---
I love how people say this as if they’ve had an epiphany that no one has thought of lol
---
I'm also glad you stopped.
---
Yea you fucked up bad. This is the problem with relying on lists / addons or whatever to tell you what's an upgrade and what isn't. Use your damn eyeballs. Why the hell would you need +hit for casting healing spells?
---
You'll never want for a group if you're a Warrior Tank.
---
Priests are the best healers, but Paladins are perfectly good. Druids are limited by lack of a ressurect (not on cooldown) but good groups won't worry too much about that.
---
Mages are always wanted for sheep, AOE, and frost nova. 
---
***
---
I play a hunter. More common than dirt, 5 mans harder to find, first class to fill up PUG raids, but I've had a great time and a little patience goes a long way.
---
If there was anyone watching him and contemplating throwing money at him for advertisement saw how toxic he was and probably want no association with him.
---
Sure, he's got a stable twitch channel... but he likely kissed away a LOT of sponsorship potential for that Staff.
---
It's ok but it's definitely not bis for pvp
---
A lot of drama over nothing, no ones really impressed by the helm or the numbers it provides...
---
mine do as well, but never fix. I have to go to the macro screen, and click each and every one, this fixes it one icon at a time. /reload, switching stances, entering combat, nothing reliably fixes it (it sometimes does, but not even 50%).
---
the people this game attracts i swear
---
Sounds like a douche. Dps (especially mages) are the least in demand with the highest supply. You can throw a rock into Org or SW and hit 3 of them. 
---
In a group, where everyone being at full capacity makes everything go smoother, charging for water is the dumbest shit imaginable. It's not a trade skill item like a mana pot that has an actual cost tied to it, it's literally just a 2 second cast time spell. Them not wanting to give out free water to the group is just them being a dick.
---
Yes, charging or tipping for water in Cities is perfectly reasonable. You're providing a service to someone who you're not tied to, at a cheaper rate than what that person pays for at an inn keeper.  But in group you're just wasting everyone else's time by not giving people water.
---
If you're killing Rag it's honestly not necessary. More so just for tanks not FR capped or groups just trying to mitigate Fire damage. 
---
It takes anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes. All depends on group coordination. 40 second cooldown before you can cast again.
---
I dunno seems logistically exhausting ha
---
Deep prot has threat issues in 5 man dungeons, this build gives you tac mastery to intercept targets, retain rage for TC going from def&gt;battle stance, it has piercing howl, to help keep the ranger safe when they pull aggro, etc.
---
Another option is looking for a tailor. Instead of buying bags on the market, collect cloth off of enemies then look for a tailor to make you bags. 1 wool bag costs 9 wool cloth and 1 coarse thread i think. So for full wool bags, you need 36 wool.
---
Haha still. Not hard to find new friends online. I’m just saying it’s a monumental effort m. Power to him I’m just impressed at the motivation
---
This is exactly how ~~lvl 60~~ ~~undead~~ rogue are in my server.
---
There, fixed it for you.
---
lol don't do that. Anyway you can't transfer, all you can do is reroll on a pvp server, but seriously don't it. It's not worth it, there is really no upside at all, especially as alliance
---
uhhh, thunderfury? wild growth spaulders? shard of the scale? quick strike ring? band of accuria? robe of volatile power? strokers mark? onslaught girdle?
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/dreadmist
---
Well completely different here, and it also shows Alliance having 1k more lvl 60's than horde.
---
But even assuming it was 60%, how the hell is that "almost double" lmao. The mental gymnastics people like to go through to justify being shit are amazing.
---
Thanks for your thoughts everyone, im think im gonna start up a druid over the next few days. I forgot to mention that i already have a spot in a raiding guild on my rogue, where we have both MC and Ony split on farm so we are looking to start up some alt raids at some point during the next months so im sure to have a spot for raiding no matter what i decided to roll. I like the idea of heart/ns and being an offtank also being able to heal depending on the situation. Again, thanks for your help and see you in Azeroth
---
"We're doing it for the honor" - proceeds to kill honorless targets as soon as they land
---
OP is brain-dead.
---
Sounds like someone doesn't know about Drain Life. **Somehow**.
---
Unless there’s stats that’s a fat naw.
---
As a lvl 60 holy priest with 7 bis items (basically having 0 damage), DM East is where I live. With herbalism I make roughly around 40-50g an hour. Don't really think it's possible to be below lvl 60, because you need 6k mana minimum, I go in with 6,7k and it's good enough. You also want to have around 3,5k HP. You can always respec into disc priest and make it much easier, but for me respeccing before every raid from disc to holy is very expensive
---
Keep it up. Every time I run into BRM, it is gankfest by the alliance. Toxic players are a thing, but the alliance transfers from these servers onto the new servers are the most toxic. Since they've been beaten down, when they get to an evenly populated server, they just find a raid and spawn camp BRM.
---
Yeeeeeees! Exactly. I tried to post screenshots but this was needed.
---
Why? Did McConnel hurt you?
---
2x Deathbringers.
---
I'm at work, not on the shitter, but staring blankly out the window.
---
lol the retardation
---
I still feed my pet level 45 roasted quail. Seems to work fine.
---
It really doesn't take too much to heal, if you really want to be as efficient as possible for solo play I would probably just go straight ret all the way down to 30 points, then at level 40 start going into the holy tree so that by the time you're running BRD you'll have some of the useful holy talents. At max level you definitely can just put the rest of your points in ret, personally I'm 30/21/0 because it's nice having kings and sanc, I'm the only pally in my guild that can buff sanc and tanks always appreciate that. I don't really do any open world solo killing anymore anyway.
---
If you'er offended by this, then you are the person in this post.
---
Bigglesworth
---
This is exactly the way it should work. A great tank team has no ego. We run a Fury Prot, Deep Prot, MS Arms Prot, and a Feral Bear (me). Nobody taunts unless we have to save DPS/Healers, and we pair Fury/Arms and Deep/Feral together so we have one utility and one threat tank per 2 man team.
---
I MT Shazz/Sulf because I run 20% dodge and have a higher health pool, I cat after skull dies or almost entirely on other fights like Mag because they don't need more than 1 or 2 tanks.
---
It's called a tank team for a reason.
---
Farming an instance is just a normal part of the game, but that's typically reserved for level 55+ instances.
---
I like world questing, and I enjoy evading gankers.  What I don't like is just being steamrolled by the wandering groups, there isn't much you can do about that except not being out in the world.
---
According to Ironforge.pro it's 2200 pop and 40/60 alliance/horde.
---
AFAIK Grizzly wipes horde at BRM all the time.
---
Blizzard mentioned they might launch an armory for classic, but that it would not be ready for launch. So since its unclear if they are going to, I've decided to make one myself, it relies on an addon I've made which inspects players on target and then you can choose to export a string ingame that you can copy and then paste on the website in an input window which will then upload the data to the server. To find out more about the project, website and addon checkout it out here: Classic WoW Armory:  [https://classicarmory.org](https://classicarmory.org)
---
Honestly if I was in an officer in the guild and the priest did that he would probably be gone. Don't need people who are braindead rolling on +hit gear as a holy priest.
---
'But the addon yada yada' 'oh maybe hes new', like I get it there's a bunch of different possible excuses but in the end I don't want to have to train somebody from the ground up on the absolute most basics of +hit does or doesn't interact with healing spells.
---
Guy needs to learn the basics before dragging the moral in a guild down by essentially ninjaing the item.
---
&gt;At least 6 PVP servers were Alliance dominated when I looked yesterday
---
The aggregate across all pvp servers is a pretty significant horde bias, it's about 60/40 in favor of the horde.  Individual servers may vary, but the aggregate is what is important.
---
&gt;Most PVP servers are 40/60 or better. Do you guys know what words mean?
---
Having a 50/50 split with 1,000 total people is irrelevant if you have a 70/30 split across 20,000.  You can't weight all servers equally.
---
which is which?
---
Incendius has high population and decent faction balance.
---
How is this not banned? This clearly weakens Stealth classes. The whole point of being in stealth is being sneaky. How can an addon let everyone know I am going into stealth? That seems game breaking to me.
---
Turning in BG tokens gives a bit of XP IIRC, but it would take forever to level this way, and you'd better be prepared to gear up for every bracket if you don't want to get camped by twinks.
---
It is now
---
EU or US? Rp-pvp servers tend to have a high alliance pop and are usually busy because there aren't many of them.
---
Do you know why they were able to ignore it? During Vanilla, the game was growing so fucking fast, they didn’t need to address it. Look at this subscriber growth:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/
---
&gt;BRE is 2h bis (even for orcs) 
---
Is there any simulations? The stats and sword spec for OEB is kinda interesting.
---
What race are you?
---
Bullshit. 
---
1) Before they broke census they said whitemane was slanted horde, census said it was actually balanced.
---
2) Vanilla was ALLIANCE dominated NOT horde. Horde popularity didn’t start till blood elves were added.
---
Fix this blizzard, so many parts of the game just aren't enjoyable with this severely skewed H/A ratio.
---
You shouldn't be using Hemo with daggers at all. 21/5/25 is the standard Hemo/Swords build.
---
Not the same guy but I'm playing with 20+ people from vanilla/TBC on skeram. Could the whole guild transfer? Sure, but good luck convincing 20 people to do that. I've played horde since Vanilla/TBC so it's not like i went horde for the racials specifically. I feel for the alliance but blatantly punishing all horde doesn't seem like the answer.
---
I don't understand why there's not more backlash at blizzard for not doing faction specific transfers earlier. The first 2 waves made the imbalance way worse since so many alliance left at the point of 60/40 or 70/30 and would've been salvageable otherwise. Without server ques, there's far less incentive to switch unless you're tryharding for R1 as horde or just alliance in general.
---
You are 33rd with 6400 honor :D I am 1800th with 50k Honor :D
---
I literally spent hours death-running a level 1 to winterspring so I could visit the vendors there without feeding the rogues endlessly ganking people in town more honor. They still gank me despite the lack of reward because they're shitty people but at least it's wasting both of our times now.
---
That's the beauty of classic. If you are knowledgeable you dont have to be nolife except for pushing ranks to compete in the top.
---
it's already boring being ganked by 60s while trying to level. yeye "should have rolled on pve server" NEXT
---
you know you can jump off the left side and land right in MC right?
---
jumping off the right side is just asking for death
---
Not even close to exploiting the market.
---
Yea elemental is great dungeon dps just keep spamming max mage milk every chance you get. You need that mage in group also because bursting down packs you are quite likely to pull agro on with that first chain lightning but that's where the frost nova hits and you don't have to worry about it. You also need a drinking buddies, because in a group full of warriors and rogues they are just gonna keep going and that feelsbad.
---
&gt; feel the room
---
can't do this sort of thing though, that's why i'm here playing wow in the first place :p
---
If you come to wow classic looking for balance you're gona have a bad time.
---
huh...it's not literally the same ability at all. One is usable after your enemy dodges and does weapon damage + bonus damage. One is usable after YOU dodge block or parry, does a flat amount of damage and causes a ton of threat. There's no reason you can't bind them to the same macro based on which stance you're in though.
---
If you're asking purely from a design standpoint it's more than likely they just used stock portraits/models from the assets they had in place from WC3, a lot of the weapon portraits look nothing like there actual weapon until later into the expansions.
---
Is that easy to do?
---
I mean reserving orbs in Strat because you're a tank is tacky. I like to join as a healer then leave and say "oh nevermind" in protest.
---
You’re speaking to the fantastic mind behind the thought provoking “wow doge” meme you better watch your mouth
---
Who are you to decide what behavior is correct and not? We have a loot system that WE all have agreed on, in OUR guild, which has no bearing on you.
---
Don't try to come and call me childish after coming for me on my post. You started throwing insults around, don't get upset when one comes right back at you
---
You might as well just unsub or reroll. Truly a living nightmare you guys have.
---
This is really only an issue if your leveling up your bs while leveling your first character.  And for that I highly recommend waiting till after you get your level 40 mount, then using the gold you naturally get questing to fund that part of your blacksmithing leveling.
---
I played both games and you're ridiculously wrong.
---
If you are going shadow not at all in my opinion.
---
This thing has a high droprate and drops from Balnazzar and from Datorohan with 17% chance each. If he wants it is is farmable. If you feel bad about it then join your mage as a healer for his farmruns.
---
Very nice art my dude!
---
I'd change his dialogue tough, I think you used an Orcish one "Me not ugly". The troll would rather say something in the lines of "I don't be ugly mon"
---
Our GM has a monopoly on it until a week ago. Made a lot of money charging for combines. Now that the monopoly is broken, he’ll do it for free.
---
Thanks. I was hoping somebody would translate.
---
That's fair. At least ask, it's polite
---
Now just remove the cd fix the stacking bug boom all the guilds that raid suddenly have even better clear times.
---
You going into stealth will be displayed in the combat log. The addon simplifies the combat log by displaying certain things pertaining to enemy actions. 
---
I'm not one of those people who defends Spy to his last breath, but I do understand that it's not breaking a single rule in being used. It's just something people are going to have to deal with until a way to reduce its effectiveness is discovered.
---
Believe me, I play a rogue alt, and I know how much it sucks, but it's not like they can target you with the addon when you do stealth. It just shows a popup that you're there.
---
As a mage, I absolutely love this. 
---
&gt; all aoe farmed in ZF, "mechanically outplaying" all alliance player on the way there of course
---
This line got me the most, because outside ZF last night farming for my alts epic mount and a mage started casting frost bolts at me, I was locked out too many instances so I had my frost reflect hat on just in case this happened. This mage legit killed themselves with reflects.
---
What server do you play where its the alliance who are doing the deathballs?
---
I loved the little /wave there
---
He's saying the Horde will complain come BGs since their queues will be longer.
---
Waaah
---
Horde players create and abuse the imbalance that ends up killing a server..
---
And then whinge when it happens to them...
---
Have fun on your PVP/E server and your 45minute WSG queue.
---
The last two tickets I got were automatically closed before I could even reply. And the automated answers had absolutely nothing to do with what was in the ticket.
---
I already have OEB. It has dropped 5 times for us.
---
Ill wait for BRE even though the droprate is low.
---
Okay
---
&gt;everyone who disagrees with me is a "shitposter"
---
Nice.
---
Yeah, my leveling experience was dodging Horde kill squads (before honor or anything) and seeing a counter gano on Nessingwary once and a Lv 60 AFK on Earth Elemental hill and die to two 40s lmao 
---
Alliance aren’t patrolling, at least where the Alliance level. I can’t speak to after World PvP.
---
The epic boe has the same value to everyone in the party. BoPs have more value to the person equipping it (proven true because hunters will sell BoPs from DM north for 50+ gold even though the vendor value of those items are 1-5g)
---
I'd pay for that.
---
It just takes a bit of time. I don’t think the manual button works, but if you just play the game for a few minutes it will say when its done in the logs. The icon near the map changes to C+ when it's done. I don’t know what C+ is supposed to mean, but that's what the state represents.
---
I think it means somebody
---
Couldn't someone use Honor tanking to figure out server pops?
---
Aq opening requires both factions to chip in roughly equal amounts of resources to open.
---
Servers where horde gank the shit out of alli will have theirs open more slowly. 
---
I personally hope super lopsided servers like skeram, Herod, heartseeker shoot themselves in the foot and are weeks slower than more balanced servers, thus delaying content for themselves.
---
You mean the coal you buy from a vendor for 1s25c?
---
Is this the reason it takes me so long to get back in cheetah form after walking out of a building? Sometimes I'll be 15 metres before it stops telling me "you need to be outside"
---
AV comes out in a few weeks, save dkp and get unstoppable force from that
---
Found the rogue
---
My server was the opposite. There were always ~3 60 Horde rampaging around Kargath before honor was introduced. 
---
But yeah there are gankers on both sides of course
---
Ok I will start a scan and see how it goes
---
They literally do this exact shit. Feralas has been unplayable as Horde on Bigglesworth for the last week. 5 man groups of ally 60s are everywhere outside of Camp M. In Tanaris you have to mad dash away from Gadgetzan and do 2-3 respawns before they finally stop camping your corpse.
---
The real play is to bring a 10 man premade of mages and turtle until the guards are buff enough to extend the game for hours!
---
Addon is still working.
---
It's 50% more people for one side than the other.
---
What's a good PVE server for me to make a Horde on? I've been on a PVP server as an Alliance (Rattlegore) and I am only level 45, but I can see where I am headed.
---
I think I should've started leveling with a rogue. I've just dinged 60 on my hunter and have been barely playing any less, rushing to my rogue because "it does not take 20 seconds to kill something, but rather 3-10".
---
Census addon. You can run for yourself. I did a lot of censuses on Europe Eng realms.
---
I'm sorry, but because it is "concurrent players online" mean that it is because they removed layering?
---
Layering allowed more players per server. So I'd expect that to drop over the cause just being PVP.
---
You could track down and kill the rogue. 
---
Rogue gets a massive graveyard walk back.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_(World_of_Warcraft)
---
People should look at this. The content really isn't being rushed that hard
---
We have a shaman multiboxer camping theramore boat all day, very easy honor if you get a few people to camp him in return, since he can't get out and is forced to keep respawning.
---
Yep, you have to appeal/open a new ticket. Often time the first one is just dismissed out of hand to see if you really care enough about the issue or not.
---
&gt;  I have 9% hit + edgemasters so effectively 12% and it’s pretty good now
---
what race are you, though ?
---
&gt; when fights are so short that you don't run out of mana even without down ranking.
---
If you aren't running out of mana and are pumping more than enough HPS, then stats don't matter. You aren't using your entire efficacy. You already out perform the fight by all metrics, so there's nothing to optimize against. Increasing +Healing or int will both just lead to more overheal and more mana at the end of the fight, both of which are useless to the encounter. We aren't like DPS where we can always push it further; there's only so much damage a boss can put out.
---
&gt; Plus the whole thing about your equation not comparing downranking betweens two different ranks of spells. It doesn compare int and +healing for one specific rank
---
In the example I used, I did the *most* downranked spell with a coefficient higher than it actually is (rank 1 heal gets coefficient penalties). This was all to give +Healing the highest possible weight. Even with all of that though, it turns out int is still at least 1.5x as important. If you rerun the equation with higher rank spells, it will just make int even heavier (`Sh/Sc` is in the numerator).
---
&gt;  It doesn compare int and +healing for one specific rank
---
You keep using the term "compare" but I don't know why. If you want to compare different spells, then plug in their different profiles `Sh/Sc` into the equation, and *compare* how the stat weights change. The math I did here is specifically to optimize your total potential healing while conforming to your spell profile. If you have a target spell profile, then use that instead.
---
If you have a target HpS (`R`), then you can solve for that too:
---
&gt; `R = (Sh/Sc+H)/3.5`
---
For a given spell rank to satisfy a minimum HpS, you must have at least this much `H`:
---
&gt; `H = R*3.5 - Sh/Sc`
---
For a given H to satisfy a minimum HpS, use this spell profile:
---
&gt; `Sh/Sc = R*3.5 - H`
---
From there, use the gradient ascent in the post to maximize your potential healing.
---
"It just shows a popup that you're there."
---
That's what's game breaking. Stealth is supposed to be used to sneak around, get the jump on the enemy. You are breaking a skill by alarming players of it's usage, completely countering it's purpose in PvP. 
---
This addon is warning people, essentially telling them to start AoEing in hope of getting that stealth class out of stealth.
---
The difference here is you have to go with the intention of farming those mats. Anyone with herbalism leveling will naturally get a lot of briarthorn and swiftthistle. At least as horde in the barrens I don't know about ally
---
I'd like to see "no touching Tuesdays" implemented where we just don't kill each other for 1 day per week so we can come out of our dungeon-holes and actually do a quest or two. As a priest I've just been abandoning my quests as they turn grey because anytime I go anywhere in a contested zone I die every 30 seconds (except blackrock mountain which is exactly like the OP video, but I don't have stealth so death every time you hit rez and walk 1 step)
---
Yeeeep. I forgot I was flagged yesterday when leaving Org on Heartseeker. I instantly got swarmed by like 20 Alliance lmao.
---
Wait what? PvP was barely even a thing in EQ, there were PvP servers but they were ghost towns.
---
DAoC had balancing problems between the realms but at least it had a coherent concept for world-PvP, something that WoW doesn't have TO THIS VERY DAY.
---
World-PvP in WoW has alsways been rudumentary because WoW is at it's core a PvE-focused game. The only way to make PvP workable in WoW was to offshore it into BGs and arenas.
---
Yeah, everyone except warlocks, mages, priests, rogues, druids and hunters. 
---
And if you think you won’t run into leather wearers decked out in OP gear like raptor hunters tunic, triprunner dungarees and master hunters rifle you’re in for a bad time.
---
https://www.bootybaygazette.com/
---
It's not like rogues will do this 24/7 for the next months. The Honour system is new, barely here for a week. The novelty will be gone in a few weeks. 
---
People that act like there is no hiding in their capital cities are just over reacting way too hard.
---
Even the exaggeration you made up specifically to make him sound as bad as possible made him sound pretty okay lol
---
The complaints are baseless and irrelevant when the people making them are largely a toxic and entitled group, and have clearly never played on a pvp realm before.
---
I haven't seen a legit complaint yet that warrants a response other than "Go make a character on a pve server if you can't handle it." People are tired of this response, but that's the solution, which is why it's said so much.
---
It's like in BFA when warmode was introduced and people would bitch about getting camped. Well, then fucking turn WM off. 
---
Let's go over the common ones:
---
"A lv 60 shouldn't be camping a flight path!" - well, it happens to all of us. You roll with the punches and deal with it, because that's what you signed up for. 
---
"Well the are MORE people this time!" - sure, then there should be more people on your side as well to help you when you post in general that someone is camping.  
---
"But it's impossible to get to BRD/MC!" - just as it was back in the day. Whether there are 1,000 or 10,000 people on a realm, there are always groups down there happy to murder you and your friends on your way to an instance.
---
Really, all these complaints boil down to "I can't handle pvp." Everyone wanted classic with "#nochanges", got exactly that, and now it's an issue. 
---
You can please everyone, and certainly not these types of people. And it's not going to change, so their complaints are really just incessant bitching that's lost in the ether.
---
I’m 100% certain a server shutdown doesn’t happen every tuesday. I’ve played on tuesdays before at the exact same time without shutdowns.
---
I think he means the rank 11 mount actually
---
You're forgetting the biggest point though...in Vanilla _new players were joining in mass numbers all the time_. THAT is the big difference. 99% of those new players had no idea of pre-bis or any of that shit. MMO's were still new to the mainstream, and min maxing was even newer. Vanilla WoW had something like 1 million new subs every 4-6 months. That's fucking insane growth. So you had:
---
1. General players that were new the genre and gaming 
---
2. Information was available, but the way people used the internet in 2004-2006 was way different
---
3. Everything was new. The raids were all new content, new patches changing talents, etc
---
4. Constant influx of millions of new players that diluted the skill pool 
---
5. Gaming culture was different
---
6. Servers were smaller
---
Those 5 things were what made the game experience in Vanilla so drastically different than Classic
---
"he said, before getting stun fucked to death."
---
Nice civility there. Looks like I was right about you being toxic.
---
Id love to get 700 gold after a raid that I helped clear. Imagine after one raid I have 700 gold to bid for items the next raid. Its just a smarter way to distribute gold from example mage to over other classes in the raid.
---
are fewer\*
---
Cool idea.. I guess you'd prefer pvp didn't exist at all in WoW?
---
Podcasts with Kevin Jordan have him discuss multiple times about how he was pushing hard for pvp to be an important piece of the game from early on in development
---
Strange, People complain when they have more than 100ms but now it's okay for them to play with 400ms because that's how it feels on classic. It feels like you were playing on some cheap, outdated crap server from 2001 made by one person lol. Spell batching okay but everything else is ridiculous i don't think any other games that are at least decent have that kind of delays when you interact with things.
---
4 rogues and 1 mage in this picture.
---
The problem I'm describing is real, regardless of your personal experience.
---
OP isn't having fun like this and you only get to have fun when OP is there to be griefed. If OP transfers or rerolls, you'll have no one left to grief! See?
---
There are 40 people in a raid group, so it is very unlikely you know how each one of them feels. Even if everyone agrees to use the system, that does not make it fair.   
---
You came here to brag about this loot being given to you, so it is only natural for me to react to the content you posted.    
---
Your insults are just empty mockery only meant to pad your ego.  I called you deadweight, which is pretty hard to argue against being true.
---
One of the ones you could transfer to.
---
Hahahahahah wut
---
I sell that coal EVERY SINGLE DAY on the AH for like 4x the price
---
Where you live probably has an impact; I make about that and I have a 750$ / month car. If I didn't love cars, I could easily get a shittier one and get gaming stuff.
---
No it didn't, you're just thinking from the perspective of a buyer and not a seller
---
Do you mean the av mount or the rank 11 mount? AV mount is 720 but I think the rank 11 one is like 10 or so but exalted with av is easier than rank 11
---
Alliance on Skeram here. We made the mistake of going from thorium point last night. Ran into multiple raids of horde lining the entire interior and Gates of brm. Over 100 horde vs our 40. Needless to say we death crawled into MC.
---
“We are a casual hardcore raiding guild”. 
---
Is the word hardcore just thrown about now as if it applies to everybody, just like how everyone was rank 14 back in the day somehow? I’m going to be completely honest, you and your guild are the complete opposite of hardcore. It’s almost 3 months into the game and your guild isn’t even able to fill a full 40 man raid and do all available content. 
---
You are what we call a casual raiding guild. Nothing wrong with that, just don’t mislead people who could be interested with this idea that your guild will be progressing through content at a good pace as it comes out.
---
This is super low effort. I still laughed.
---
^ This is why everyone's unsubbing. Don't want to, but this is stupid when compared to the other video.
---
You will bring down boss armor to zero though with just 1 or 2 out of 3 applications of Annihilator.
---
You play as arms for sweeping strikes. Whereas death wish is kinda useless farming and questing, SS kinda doubles your damage at a 30 rage cost
---
"toilet read" works on many levels for /new
---
I'm playing on a projector so I have the brightness cranked up a little lol
---
But am I Horde :D prolly should have clarified that in my post. What server you from?
---
Lol you're one of those people that there is no helping. Idiot.
---
As a kid, I never, ever received the response of "We have x at home". It was always. "No, be quiet." :(
---
Hunter: “Whoever he is, he is one tough badass”
---
Or pre-WoW Classic, look at how the Horde killed Kronos private server
---
Cause tons of alliance that went pvp, should have gone pve. We need the paid character transfers like original classic had asap.
---
so after ZF all the dungeons would be a must to be holy spec?
---
For sure? If yes, then pls share.
---
I think removing totems isn't possible in classic, but I would be delighted if it is.
---
this is just patently untrue due to the armor values bosses have and the impact weapon skill has
---
The problem is that the honor system wasn't in the game from the start.  This change has come as a shock to the system for a lot of people after a couple months of factions mostly ignoring each other, letting each other level all nicey nice.  They don't know whats hit them now, they can't do  what they want to do all the time because there might be an enemy wanting to fight them on a pvp server in a pvp game... god forbid.
---
Its awesome though, you'll love it, this is how WoW should be.
---
This is totally how it works.  Loot council and round robin means you have situations like this.  DKP solves this, but has other problems as well.  I mean, if that guy has better attendance to raids, it is important to get him geared up.  But yeah, this is exactly the way it was in Vanilla.
---
nearly all servers were without layers way before that.  The few that still had layers went to single layer the week before honor release.  you can notice that slight drop off before honor pvp.
---
I got Savage Gladiator chain and Hand of Justice within 3 days I'm really enjoying classic as a fury warrior. Anyway, does anyone know any spots a warrior could farm gold? Google doesn't yield much.
---
If Horde are smart, they’ll transfer. But a lot of them like queues for some reason.
---
In my experience as a horde most horde won't group with you because thy don't want to share the honor and don't need to group because they can always run a few feet into the nearest other horde of things turn bad. Alliance never travel alone ( for good reason no blame here) so at least from what I've seen horde "solo" play far more.
---
Except in the real world, there are consequences for trying to silence your competitors.  If you can't compete, you lose business.  You don't have the right to attempt intimidation tactics.
---
But he's still casting and he's still getting crits! It's like BOOM crit, BOOM crit, BOOM *crit*!
---
Skeram was still terrible before the transfers opened up. I couldn't even quest in STV. Every quest mob was camped by Horde during prime time. Hell, there were so many Horde that the Horde could barely quest. The servers are just too populated.
---
Do /who 60 warlock/hunter/priest Maraudon and ask them for a boost, costs like 15g
---
My favorite is LF2M Tank/Heals. *All Orbs Reserved*
---
Im not sure what you're calling griefing. 
---
The server was unbalanced way before the honour system. And roaming around killing alliance is not griefing. 
---
In fact most pvp servers were unbalanced before the honour system and i seriously doubt most people transfered away because they got griefed in their own cities but rather because playing against on a server where its 80/20 against you is not fun regardless of the fact that some rogues kill a few people in IF/SW.
---
My group 1 team clears Ony and MC in the same night with world buffs and consumables. Group 2 is equal skill with a relaxed mentality and we do the same content over two raid nights - we downed golemag last and continue later in the week.
---
Preparation makes a big difference but i’m not going to force it down your throat.
---
I understand that it's in combat logs, but no one has their combat logs opened and eyeing it looking out for the stealth. This addon basically says HEY LOOK HERE SOMEONE WENT STEALTH without any work put into it.
---
You would think Blizzard would take stealth off of the combat log.
---
Name another skill that's affected in game as much as stealth is by Spy.
---
I red it wrong
---
Remember my first head god I miss that Subaru
---
Imagine that stank
---
At this level, you don’t have enough mana to blizzard as many times needed to kill the elite mobs. Come of cold is much more efficient
---
I'm not sure if you're just joking or not, but the site linked above says:
---
&gt;You (Horde) say vü a 101 and Alliance will read zu g zug
---
Not gonna lie, that'd momentarily confuse the crap out of me
---
Excuse me, what? Alliance is the easy mode faction. Salvation, immunity buffs, fear ward, snare immunity buffs, AV advantages up ass with the bridge, harder towers and and easy way into the Horde boss. Yeah, no, this has nothing to do with choosing easy mode. I almost went Alliance just to make it easier on myself, but I changed my mind because all the Alliance races look dumb as fuck.
---
I think they mean Mute's 100-0 algorithm that used to be entirely unknown and extremely triggering to 2005 rogues who called it useless since it required cooldowns
---
Nowadays, that combo is standard and every rogue knows it
---
I've been playing since launch, trying a ton of classes with a varying degree of enjoyment. This includes Paladin (49), Priest (43), Shaman (37), Warrior (30), Druid (22), Rogue (19).
---
I've started leaning toward Druid more than anything else. I'm a casual player who wants a hybrid role. I would enjoy being an off-tank who can dps/heal on fights where I'm not needed in my main role. That being said, how do people like Druids at 60? Particularly in that role. I've watched Skarm's videos and see what I want is possible, but I wouldn't mind hearing others echo his thoughts.
---
If you dont get free water for dungeons or whatever simply dont drink and let people die / do low damage
---
when someone asks whats up you say you got no water.
---
its pretty simple to be honest.
---
Bring a mage and then you can sell both summons and ports to major cities (summon then port). I'd absolutely pay for this service if it meant getting into BRM in under 30 minutes
---
"They don't drag down the raid" is factually inaccurate. You could swap that player with literally any "real" DPS class and raid damage would increase. Taking that player is slowing down your raid.  
---
Sure, you can bring someone who spent talent-points randomly. Bring a moonkin. Just don't go around telling people the moonkin isn't slowing you down.
---
This was my guild’s experience last night (A-Skeram) trying to get into MC. We thought we were safe in a 40 man raid, only to run up into a brick wall of Horde over and over again. If it weren’t for the MC lava skip, I don’t even know how we would have got in with the constant AOE damage going to the choke / Belf. 
---
Absolute shitshow.
---
Then tell me who is gonna buy those BoE? People who NEED them
---
Hey I'm working on a 49 warrior too, first twink ever currently at 38. How did you farm your other BoP pieces? I'm planning on just buying Princess runs for Mara, but I'm not sure if I should buy carries for ZF and ST or just get the gear playing through normally. My greatest fear is getting to 49 and still needing dungeon gear.
---
Literally what I’m doing right now haha
---
I'd suggest just using a throw away alt to advertise and reduce risk for your GM.  Something like, "Freelion" or "Yourmats" would be a nice way to stick it down people's throats.
---
Yeah, this isn’t going to end well.
---
that guy plays 20 hrs a day to get ahead, then a casual like you comes and takes his loot. perspective my friend
---
We had guild shirts in Vanilla .... not to sell, just for fun ...
---
O K Z O O M R

2h arms tank. Charge sweeping strike whirlwind. Demo shout for mitigation. Use whirlwind on cd. If taking too much dmg throw in a thunderclap. Dont go prot til 58. Focus on stam and armor. Dont sacrifice your health pool for defense, its not that useful 5 mans and you can even tank raids without it. Use grenades. Search up stance dancing macros.
---
I dont get Blizzard. This is the WoW equivalent to lynch mobs in real life. This is intended? Cool game mechanic. I feel immersed...
---
If I fear a elemental or demon, and after the fear ends I banish him, will the time banished computed to reset the diminishing returns?
---
Could add some kind of temporary invulnerability to enemy faction upon ressurrecting if you get corpse camped like this.
---
We used to queue with PVP, PVE, RP and non-English servers so I'd imagine it would be the same.
---
Currently debating the same thing.  I have 300 skinning/herbalism and want to pick up enchanting for SHoTM.  Pretty sure skinning will be what I drop, but like you I feel like I'm always making some money from it.
---
TLDR: All parties involved have the maturity level of 12 year olds.  Thats my toy, not thats my toy, i just bought all the toys so you cant play.  
---
Downvote the shit outta me but all parties are a bunch of babies.
---
You have like 5 lines of text in that chat window....how do you function?
---
They was originally 2 servers to transfer to. I don't remember the name of the other one. Still glad I'm not on Skeram.
---
Ashbringer alliance is no joke. In Dreams could probably wipe everyone with twice as few players. Alliance almost always roams around in 5 mans. They are really tough and everyone already has Lionheart etc. That said, if they are not In Dreams you can probably 1v2 them. 
---
I am happy the competition is tough. Though I am levelling a rogue for going solo because when I am on my warrior either they are from US or super high on adderall because who goes in 5 mans to farm honor at 2am?
---
there are no GMs, only bots
---
they make you wait 3-7 days so you will think its a person
---
:D
---
There is a reason why we win all fair fights that arent sapper charge ambushes :)
---
You could have Sulfuras, your damage will still be pathetic compared to everyone else. (See: the numerous shaman with Sulfuras.)
---
Nice work!
---
Why would you black out the /say and not the /emote?
---
you severely overestimate the average raider.
---
TIL April 2005 was 9 months after November 2004.
---
Your first mistake was starting at Thorium Point.
---
The site I linked will tell you, just enter what you want translated.
---
37 quartermaster kills for hands of power?
---
Very few were. There was like a mini peace treaty amongst most people. Ofc some ignores that or w/e but it definitely seemed like most just let ppl quest in peace. I even had helped ally and been helped by ally in phase one
---
So, you  guys make a group to go UBRS or LBRS, right? Then process to go there 1 by 1 like ants. Like if you had come with full 10 player it would be another story but nah fuck logic, better go whine on reddit.
---
Warsong Gulch releasing will also likely have a big impact on the price of FAP. If you're the assigned flag carrier in your group, you'll probably need to stock up on FAPs.
---
It's an add-on that scans the combat log for actions from enemy players and puts those players in a list. Some actions (like entering stealth) get a special pop-up and sound.
---
Pretty much any combat action when taken by someone you can't see (maybe they're over a hill, or behind a tree) is affected by the addon. I know that when I was leveling my Alliance druid and going into Redridge, I was thankful of notifications of people buffing one another just up one of the hills.
---
It gave me a chance to run somewhere that might guarantee my survival. Not once did I get ganked by stealthers there. It was always just some random high-level troll shaman or orc warrior just steamrolling everyone they come into contact with.
---
Everyone is affected in one way or another. Stealth classes feel particularly attacked based solely on the fact that it alerts players that it was an *enemy* that has gone into stealth, versus just any old player. And believe me, I sympathize with that. But again, it's also not breaking any rules. 
---
General awareness is all one needs to survive in the game. Not the Spy addon.
---
Honestly, being flagged on a pve server is more stressful than on a pvp server.  Probably because you aren't used to it and view any opposite faction with suspicion.  While pvp servers, you are always viewing the other faction this way so you lose your concern.
---
I guess idiots are pack animals 😂
---
I just started reading Watchmen. Really cool so far
---
Horde racials??
---
So I'm completely new to Classic and WoW in general. The best I've ever gotten is playing through the free trial back in Cata. I'm looking to delve into Classic now. Would I need to buy the current wow expansion to play Classic? Or can I play it with just the monthly subscription even though I've never bought the game or its xpac before?
---
Frankly I'm surprised it didn't end with "Cairne didn't kill himself".
---
Same thing for Alliance on Blaumeaux.
---
Who wants to spend an hour and a half killing a paladin? I've got shit to do, mate.
---
Blizzard, just remove the buff cap if you can't figure this shit out, seriously. Multi-billion dollar company, everyone. Pathetic.
---
U mad bro? Hang in there, they will let you transfer to a PvE realm soon.
---
Not full holy, I think around level 42 I respecced with 18 points in retribution, then put the rest of my talents into holy until I got divine favor at lvl 48 then went back to putting points in ret until 60. Then at level 60 you have all the key talents to heal dungeons and solo/pvp (illumination and divine favor in holy; SoC, crit, movement speed, vengeance in ret)
---
&gt;Alliance aren’t patrolling, at least where the Alliance level
---
Ofc not they are where the horde level...
---
lol this stupid guy with wrong macro "go to rettit"
---
Leader of my sm group got squelched because there were 2 other groups looking for people and they all reported him and got their guilds to report him apparently right click report shouldn’t be there
---
As Kiste233 already said I reached that with zerging at ss/tm. You can basically always find people doing pvp there.
---
I did not record the exact time but I'd say I did around 4 hours of pvp in the whole week.
---
40g Assassins Blades, 25g The Butchers, wild stuff
---
/doubt
---
That’s the longest way to get to MC
---
&gt;I had some confidence at this point that I wouldn't lose a third time in a row.
---
This is literally called the gambler's fallacy.
---
And that's my point. If you remove the consequences it suddenly becomes logical to do so.
---
I argue it's better than BRE on bosses as they have 0 armore after debuffs therefore it reads as follows
---
64DPS
---
84AP (which makes OEB roughly 70DPS)
---
3% hit
---
\+glancing blow damage
---
Whereas BRE only reads 
---
74DPS
---
1% crit
---
OEB is rock solid and only Spinal Reaper for Orc in the 2h department will beat it. 
---
I'd still go all in for BRE if you want to PvP. I premade vs pug PvP BRE is even better than r14 weapons as you have optimal uptime and the proc is up very often.
---
Oh whoops, it sure will. I'm still consuming caffeine, haven't quite woken up yet.
---
You can award loot while an invisibility potion ticks - seems your GM has a few tricks to learn
---
&gt; PvP servers just aren't for me.
---
At least you know that, not like 99% of whining posts on reddit, that they do not know how to pvp so they whine fully knowing they were playing on a pvp server lol.
---
Because you played UO after Trammel expansion, obviously. You weren't there for vanilla UO.
---
* UO death you dropped *everything* and had to find a spirit healer to rez. You couldn't just run back to your body, you were miles away when returned to life.
---
* UO death had *heavy* random skill loss on death if you were near the 300 point cap (max level). You could use a week's worth of Swordsmanship Skill on an unlucky death.
---
* UO had no starter areas or safe zones. If people liked what you were wearing, enough of them could gank you standing right in the middle of town before the guards could kill them all. Then an accomplice would be ready to loot you.
---
* UO had pure thievery, anyone could steal from your pockets. Standing at the bank was always dangerous because rogues were everywhere, and losing your Mage Bag of reagents was an easy pickpocket but worth tons of gold.
---
EQ had a lightweight "drop a few items if I can't get to my corpse in time" system. The XP loss was negligible. EQ had safe zones where you couldn't be robbed/attacked. EQ thievery was shit in comparison.
---
I'm afraid you played some later rendition of UO after EA acquired them, and have no clue what you're talking about.
---
Alliance are just outnumbered 2 to 1 it's not that bad. If you're coordinated you can win 10v20
---
TIL once a week = all the time
---
If you steath at Thorium point and walk to BRM, the addon won't report you to people in BRM. But if someone near BRM spots you just for a milisecond, you will pop up on the addon as a "stealth nearby".  
---
There are several things how to improve stealth detection. Engineering goggles, catseye elixir and buff from warlock are the ones I know about. So most likely someone spotted you in stealth while passing by for a milisecond, which is enough for the addon to register you.
---
Yestarday on Ashbringer i was trying to get to BRD as alliance warrior lvl 60. Died 16 times. 16 freaking times lol, on a path that usually takes what? 4 min walking? Took me 50 minutes to get from thorium point into brd!  
---
So yeah, horde sucks too :P  
---
PS. at least i got mine HoJ in 2 runs finally so im not salty about it anymore :D
---
/u/solidjade what are your thoughts on complaining about people posting memes on this sub while you yourself have posted several? Why did you summon the great elemental hypocnaros?
---
Could be the dmg per Mana is higher, I'm not confident in the math around that with a 44 and his talent set. Entirely possible tho
---
Nice try alliance
---
Exactly lol.  To make it simple, let's say the BoE in question is worth 500 gold. Since he "NEEDS" it, he either wins the BoE when it drops, or has to buy it on the auction house. If he wins it, he literally just won 500g because he NEEDS that item and now he doesnt have to buy it! Pretty shitty to feel entitled to 500g when other classes could use that gold to buy their own BoE best in slot items.
---
The Cheeto dust comment got to this guy lol
---
I'm in a week two rag guild playing enhance and I regularly beat people playing better classes while buffing the other melee. Don't let these morons on here spout outdated stigmas. Be prepared to farm for more consumables than every other class though lol.
---
From a 99th percentile parsing enh shaman
---
as a person\*
---
Nonsense. The time between 1.4 to 1.5 in vanilla was 7 weeks. No way would blizzard have ever gone longer than that in classic
---
He shows the talents in his vid.
---
NICE! Congrats!!
---
How is this a thing. The only people who could make a systematic profit from this are the ones that cheat or steal.
---
DRs don't apply to mobs, but yes, it would
---
Keep in mind that healers aren't the only ones who need water though.
---
&gt;admit that the horde have it fucking easy because they are the more FOTM faction
---
No. This excuse has been regurgitated for 14 years now, and there's no basis behind it. Just because a server somewhere at some point had 80/20 horde, everyone thinks that MUST be the case with them.
---
And it loses its value especially when everyone is using it. The alliance camp the shit out of things, and I hear horde saying, "that's because they have the upper hand with racial passives."
---
Yeah, no, that's not why you're dying. Or when people lose, "Nerf [whatever class just killed them]"
---
The funny thing with people on this topic, it *always* boils down to "Everyone else's fault but mine."
---
YES lol
---
No you just download the game through the blizzard launcher and subscribe to the monthly fee
---
Now we need one about being salty in a PvP server.
---
Huh, heard people claim it was 400 ms. Dunno whst is true. All i know is its either too clunky or too large. But not large enough to get why people complain this much about it.
---
&gt;Fuckin A, is this what it’s always like raiding? 
---
Nope, you just found a lame guild full of kids.
---
34k honor to barely reach rank 3 on golemagg-eu
---
You are the one feeling entitled here, unless agreed to beforehand the common rules are greed for gold need if its an upgrade
---
Thanks for the quick answer!
---
I suspect out guild does something similar, at least i hope so.
---
Personally I wouldnt want to be involved in that side of a guild.  Did it in vanilla and i know how much strife can be caused by the smallest things.
---
A lvl a day isn't too far fetched if you have some measure of free time. Esp as its not his first character.
---
Hi guys, noob question - I am currently only lvl 23 (started late)   
---
Is there some dungeon or location, that I could miss due to not being 60 yet?  
---
I mean, I not sure how the next phases work, will it be only additions, or is something also being removed? Just to know how hard should I push for 60...
---
Yeah less were actively hunting, but to say people "only kill you for honor" is blatantly wrong
---
No sane person honestly expects a healer to be this fucking dumb.
---
Not always.  My guild is pretty chill and we all realize we will eventually get geared up so we try to split things up pretty evenly.  We do sort of an open loot council and decide together who should be rolling on the loot.  Bindings/eye everyone has already agreed to who gets so that's not an issue
---
In their defense (borderline indefensible), what they get out of it is a queue of honorable targets when they rez so the second time (and third and fourth from my unfortunate experience) they kill the player, they do get honor, as opposed to letting the honorless target run until they're honorable again.
---
I'm a lvl 30 druid, i want to lvl with feral but heal in dungeons and occasionaly Tank or dps. Do you guys have some builds for my needs?
---
Exactly. I was on a normal realm in vanilla and I saw plenty of southshore/tarren mill battles and crossroads raids.
---
Let's get the paid character transfers out on December 10th.  Classic had them with a long cooldown and some restrictions, let's go.
---
It’s like being the smartest person in non honors or AP classes
---
Alliance tears got tastier
---
Yes, 100% this.  In classic you will not be able to keep all mobs on you, it is how the game works.  Classic requires some sort of CC for most pulls.  You can have a pet OT, banish, sheep, sap, etc.  It works so much better if the group is using CC.  At most you can keep 3 mobs on you pretty easily.  More than 3 is TOUGH.  If you have some ranks in fury, piercing howl is cheap and good, helps slow down the guys that peel off, especially when you have mobs that flee.  Otherwise, most of the problems are DPS not CC'ing enough or attacking mobs that aren't your main target.
---
IF things are going perfectly, you should just be worrying about heals pulling mobs off of you, and it is much easier to manage heal threat than dps threat.  They should just be doing single target damage on most mobs.  (Some packs work with AoE if you have a good group for that)
---
The complete lack of sheeping from mages is mystifying to me.  Sheeping mobs was something that was done so much in Vanilla. (I am speaking from BRD experience tanking)
---
If you are having trouble get your group to use CC.
---
I Arathi Hifglands, just as you come out of Hammerfall, straight ahead. There are many spiders in a dense area.
---
You have to give up mana tide totem, but it's only 22 points into enhancement. You can very easily spec into IWT and be a capable raid healer. You mostly skip healing wave talents.
---
LBRS?
---
I farmed maybe 5 from the spiders in duskwallow marsh for my lock's shadoweave gear before giving up and just buying out the rest from the AH.
---
It's only worse in parsings as that counts boss DPS.
---
If you go for overall clear time 2handers are awesome, because you fight 2+ mobs most of the time in MC which makes cleaving with a 2hander very good.
---
If you have an overabundance of 2hander lying around because OEB has a rather high drop chance and drops from 4 bosses every warrior should get one for corehound packs, sulfuron and imps.
---
Roaming around killing Alliance is not griefing, no. Camping FPs, GYs, popular questing points is.
---
It feels like griefing to a lot of Alliance players like myself though because we're constantly dead. I'm not paying too much attention to Horde player names because the first roaming group of 5 or 6 is different than the group of 5 or 6 that kills me 2 minutes later.
---
Constantly, and I wasn't on a high pop server. It was still awesome.
---
\&gt;roaming around killing alliance is not griefing.  
---
Dude, it is. I know that it feels like in the spirit of the game, but when that fight is unbalanced in terms of numbers 99% of the time, it's just grief for one side and boring for the other. Pointless.  
---
Rogues camping people in capital cities is absolutely a reason people will switch away from their server. It will turn a 60/40 into a 65/35 into a 70/30 into a 90/10. At some point, you have to ask, "Why not just give the tiniest bit of leeway? Maybe these people I'm playing with don't want to play this way?"  
---
It's like playing chess against a kid, someone disadvantaged from the get-go, like an Ally on a 60-40 server. Maybe at first, you both love it, it can be great fun, you win the first game, now the second, now the third... Okay, so yes, it's clear you can absolutely wreck him every time, no problems, tell him to go back to checkers like a bitch, BUT LOOK, if you never let the kid win, never even let him draw, he's just not going to play chess with you. And now what? You've got nobody to play chess with. Who won here? You? The kid? Seems like a shittier situation all round, doesn't it? Now neither of you get to play the game you wanted.  
---
Maybe if you let the kid win just every now and again, you'll both have more fun. Something to think about.
---
Sartharion 3D was harder than ToC, most of Ulduar, most of ICC, and Ruby Sanctum.
---
Do you know its name?
---
Blizzard banned some addons in vanilla, namely the translation addon from Common&lt;-&gt;Orcish.
---
I think they can take a look at spy as well.
---
If I was on a semi balanced realm, I would enjoy it. Having people run around your own city that you need to hunt down is fun. My favorite memories in wow are killing horde in org.
---
The big problem in classic is most PvP realms have 6000 level 60 horde players. Every single fp is camped. Can't go to neutral cities, can't quest, can't go to dungeons, can't farm. Can't roam in PvP groups because you get camped by 40. PvP is massively unfavorable and 100% of the time unavoidable. And you think your ONE safe haven is your most popular main city, but you're dying in there too. There is truly no break from it on some realms, that's why people are mad.
---
The average raider isn't the one getting to world bosses when they're up. These guys are at least a little hardcore and likely don't have any drops they still need outside of raids/world bosses
---
Im alliance on skeram just not a cry baby
---
No,  there will just be less alliance in the world cause they are all afking bgs for bis offhands.
---
i want a spec where i will be able to heal decently in raid and be able to defend myself against enemies in world and be able to kill hordes when the BGs come out
---
for what im looking for do u recommend me 30/21/0 or 30/0/21?
---
so the first one is a good pve/pvp mix but when u say its pvp oriented u mean as a pvp heal right? and why the 30/0/21 is bad for pvp? im 35 right now so i only have 26 pts in retry but with that i can almost win every class around my lvl in world 1v1
---
Are there any massively populated servers with ally dominance? Because afaik all the large servers are horde dominated, those tiny pve servers won't really save the situation.
---
There are no diminishing returns in Classic.  
---
Mobs can be feared forever!
---
Peep the tag in the title. This a /s post.
---
Fishing event doesn't win you anything outside of the BiS 19 twink helm (stam and +5 fishing), some fishing boots (stam and +5 fishing), fishing pole "enchant" (one time use, +5 fishing, does not stack with lures), current BiS fishing pole (with +35 fishing), or a trinket that works like a mount that turns you into a fish (increased swim speed + unlimited breath).
---
So these items are exactly game changing. I wouldn't stress about the playerbase needing to "catchup" because there really isn't anything to CATCH at all (bad pun...).
---
This will probably tank the market but worth it if you have an alt that needs to make the pattern.
---
The solution was paid character transfers that had a cooldown with some restrictions.
---
5 rogues, 0 mages according to Spy.
---
&gt; Put in a GM ticket and they said they can not fix it.
---
Its a bot, there are no real GMs
---
thats why you always get the standard response.
---
In the grand scheme of things you are still starting early. Don’t worry and have fun! Happy leveling. You won’t miss anything :)
---
Its mostly horde that have the faction imbalance in their favor. Neither option is good.
---
This is Blizzard's fault for not taking steps to ensure a more even split on realms at launch.
---
&gt; Acts like this is some big barrier to a new raid tier.
---
That guy actually flasked for onyxia. L O L
---
How? Transfer isn't available.
---
Lucky, I've been TRYING to get my name reported for a change, having my whole guild report it, and the GM said it wasnt inappropriate :(
---
Whats the respawn time on these damn corrupted night dragons in felwood? I was out all last night looking for one.
---
Can you queue as a group in classic??
---
What about this is toxicity? This is...the point of the game. To be at war with the other faction.
---
If you just stay flagged all the time, it doesn't really change anything.
---
Some people sell fresh bread others fresh *peach emoji* I thought this was Azeroth my bad
---
I don't tend to look at specific servers, especially how they are doing individually for pve so I can't help there.
---
Yeah this is the same on Benediction as Alliance.  Super fun.  Very, very cool.
---
The Bob Ross of WoW! Waited for the moment you would say “slam the devil out of it” but helaas!
---
Save Mithril for the blacksmithing quests. But yeah it's expensive, can typically buy 10 iron ores for 1g, then another 40s  vendor for coal. The way I've been combating the costs is mining *everything* when I'm questing. Get tin and copper, sell bronze bars on AH, plus coarse stone is like 20s a pop on my server. So I more or less even out when I craft and need to buy stuff from AH. 
---
Also a pally no mounts to buy :)
---
Bre is a pvp weapon not really fair to compare lol
---
I think based on what some of you said, I'm going to stick it out with elemental shaman since it can still perform consistently with decent gear and has much more group utility. Also, I see it echoed a lot that hunters really drop off towards the end game where shamans continue to scale well.
---
I've also heard from many hunters that there are still tons of bugs, FD+trap for example. I'll probably end up levelling one as an alt though as I focus on the shaman.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
But when you have a full mailbox and bank you need more alts it’s a simple concept.
---
OP PLEASE do not listen to this comment. this kid doesnt know wtf hes talking about. OEB is great.
---
If only guards did shit. A well geared lvl 60 rogue stomps a level 55 guard like a mosquito. Even in Ironforge the guards won't help you enough and it's the best defended Alliance area in the game.
---
We need paid transfers because blizz has no idea what they are doing.
---
this but unironically
---
No idea. We just discovered that mobs poped at the 3 Sec mark consistently. Still gathering info on how much +hit each caster had to look for correlation.
---
A horde lock doesn't have problems with classic, who'd have thought?
---
The guy with the first recipe on Pagle was charging like 250 or 300 a craft and was bragging about having 22k gold in trade chat. Another recipe dropped and he was worried about the price tanking, so he bought all the arcanite bars and other mats off the AH. Dude never has to do another thing and always have enough gold yet he's worried about losing some gold for pressing a button.
---
Imo, just stick with disc. You don’t really lose out on much healing (not enough to have ever been the cause of a wipe), and casters will suck you off when they get a taste of that sweet PI.
---
Assuming there's at least a single warlock there that has any idea what they're doing, all that does is waste a pot and get yourself another free death lol.
---
That mage officer is the most patient guy I've ever heard of, I would've booted you the fuck out of my guild. Stop following these "guides" blindly and start adding a tiny, miniscule bit of thinking about what you're doing. Jesus christ.
---
The front page hows all server not just pvp read what I said
---
No, you are
---
Ha, just wait until you need 34 thorium bars and 2g in gems for a single point.
---
Hardly a scam, you got your investment back, you just didn't receive your winnings. You lost nothing except for a minute of your time, that's not a scam.
---
This is to be expected when you get non-English speaking players on NA servers. Joining groups where people barely speak English, on NA servers btw, is always a fucking blast.
---
I would mention as someone at level 56, anecdotally, I have really dropped off on playing, the PVP server is ... intense right now.  I am logging on to level, but really burnt out on arena/anger runs, and world questing is basically an exercise in frustration.  Last night I spent 2 hours just mob farming in an area I will not disclose here in hopes not to spoil it for myself. Got about 50% the way to 57.  Really looking forward to doing some DM spam soon.
---
Don't worry, the Warrior will grow up to take all the mail and leather.
---
At this point, I'm not sure how one would balance the addon to stunt its effectiveness against certain classes. That's something for the devs to take on with the people who created the addon. 
---
All I meant by my statement is that for as much hate/praise as Spy gets, it's absolutely not required. I haven't found it much more useful than for leveling a lowbie on a PvP server that's overpopulated by the opposing faction. Otherwise in normal PvP, I don't think it alters my mindset or playstyle. I'm just one of those people who's got his head on a swivel and I'm always looking out for that person who's trying to kill me.
---
&gt; This isn't rocket surgery
---
Please be kidding
---
This meme doesn't make any sense if no one ever brings up retail you dolt
---
You find it entertaining, to me, its just thinly-veiled whining.
---
Straight facts.
---
Kudos for the work, but I cant say I'm happy about this sort of stuff coming around. Slippery slope on ending up with 'must have X addon' style stuff.
---
Meanwhile mid-december: "Blizzaro hored bg q tiems 3 hrs too long liturrruhly unplayuhbleew."
---
You aren't missing anything, people will still be doing lvl 60 dungeons and mc/ ony runs a year from now. The only thing you could miss out on by not being 60 crazy wpvp that is happening non stop right now on pvp servers. Also the AQ event is something you could miss out on by not being lvl 60 but that's a very long ways off.
---
Do you have to click inspect on another player or do they just have to be targeted and in inspect range?
---
Also what's the data upload frequency? Does it happen in real time close to when the character is targeted?
---
Also also, does it grab talents? I know some add-ons can display talents if both players have the add-on.
---
Sounds like a cool project and a lot of work!
---
Wanting hard raids to progress true is also a retail thing. The vanilla progresive raiding scene was close to non existing.
---
Reroll/unsub/downvote?
---
Yea, that was back in vanilla too, whats your point
---
IMO 45g at level 35 is right on track to have mount money at 40. It starts adding up much more quickly around 37-38.
---
alliance rogue, with spy addon even stealthing there is an issue now
---
I disagree with your comments about Druid tanks. As a main spec tank Druid currently running MC I main tank Shazzrah because of my increased health pool and feral charge to be able to pull him back to a center location faster than a warrior and Sulfuron because of the same abilities plus 21% dodge makes it easier for me to pick him back up if he runs towards the group to debuff a random member.
---
A Druid Tank can be a main tank for nearly every fight in Classic (minus Nefarian in BWL due to class calling) and is the preferred tank for Grobbulus and Hateful Strikes from Patchwerk. I mitigate 5-7% less damage than a Warrior because I can't block or parry, but I make up for it in full misses due to high dodge from agility (20%+) and a 7-10% higher health pool.
---
If someone wants to be able to heal, or tank, a Druid tank is an excellent choice that will ensure you can get into a group as whatever spec you want to. Cat DPS is not as good as Rogue DPS... but with powershifting you can still output between 250-290 DPS which will put you midrange on the meter in any raid group provided you have the gear for it. Would advise against boomkin until the release of AQ40 which is the feral/boomkin gear heaven.
---
The added utility of a Druid while leveling also makes it much faster than solo leveling a Warrior tank.
---
Funny enough, the raptor heads had a 100% drop rate for me. But those damn zhevra hooves and Plainstrider beaks....
---
Its fun to fight other deathballs, hunting solo players is lame
---
People calling 60/40 balanced is getting old fast
---
Nah, I have left capital twice after p2 launch: once to reach MC and once to reach Ony.
---
You should probably learn how to read before going on the internet.
---
No, you have no idea what you talking about, it was way less frequent than it is now, now its more likely for something to batch than not. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Idk bud, spending gold on “perfectly itemized greens” just seems like a waste but its your money
---
I dont really think it was bragging. It was more a case of "look how easy I got it". If you want your pvp progression to be an impossible uphill that option is there for you. No need to berate people like some kind of asshat.
---
I must have perforated that turtle with too many arrows for its meat to be any good
---
250-400g unless you have friends that help with CD
---
Alchy and herbers are your friends!
---
On my server switthistle is 40s-50s each, super easy to farm
---
Its funny when care bears try to be edgy.
---
I don't think anyone was suggesting this particular guy become a one man army, tracking and killing all the rogues.
---
That's funny because last night we tagged him and posted a message to the Incendious server discord and immediately got a message from a GM confirming that as long as we don't wipe the loot is ours......
---
If only there was some way to quickly find a group to help you kill the invaders in your factions capital city... hmmmm, maybe they should introduce group finder???
---
I'm slightly dyslexic and I prefer comic over Dyslexie
---
So at this point, were talking about a guy who isnt planning to ever buy a valuable and insanely rare epic boe, but somehow is still trying to claim that he needs it when it drops? LOL
---
You fought someone 10 levels below you by yourself? Alone? With no backup? To be honest, I find that a little far-fetched.
---
"WHY NO BLIZZARD?"
---
*My thoughts for the majority of the video*
---
Dont worry about hitting the gold mark for lvl 40. Just keep doing you, and you will see you'll get there not far after hitting 40. Theres a significant income difference pre/post 40.
---
I'm releveling a druid after moving from pvp to pve. Should I skip leveling cooking, first aid, and fishing? Fishing was fun, but l never ate a cooked good or used a bandage. I was level 27, had around 150 in each secondary profession. Did I just not get high enough level for those professions to shine? I dont want to waste anytime getting back to where I was level-wise.
---
How to be "good" pvper: step 1) make sure you pick horde.
---
the audio was a nice touch
---
The GMs on WoW Classic are fucking useless.
---
And if you give out product for free, there will be no buyers and no sellers
---
48g is pretty good. You start earning way more money at higher levels (especially 35+, but there's another spike at 40); and you're over halfway. Just be ultra-conservative about gold spending like abilities/profs, spend a little bit of extra time grinding, and keep an eye for for herbs to AH. At worst you'll need to get your mount at 41 or 42 at your current rate.
---
Look up "Timira hands of power" on YouTube, Zigriss is 2mannable with 2 mages (or even better with a mage and a rogue that needs the belt so you don't have to roll for hands). It's how I got mine last night.
---
It says to do what you specifically said you already tried to do.
---
But the big ones weren't which would lead to a large concurrent player drop still. A few servers have large queue times.

Why did you roll on a pvp server if you dont like pvp?
---
is the holy reckoning spec (25/26/0) decent in raid? or will i be called out because of spec?
---
i think after reading all the comments the best answer for what i want is the 30/21/0. good raid/decent pvp
---
Yay, I can't wait to complain about being farmed at GY by premade.
---
Excellent question. That was an oversight on my part. You shouldn't be taking Improved Sinister Strike if you spec into Hemo.

smh
---
You don't get rogues using their abilities?
---
Sounds like some compelling game play you have going on there. Wait until you see the training dummies they added in WotLK, you'll fucking LOVe them!
---
Found the gnome.
---
Creative complaining.
---
Lol, I swear :D where that armory link @
---
And the best part? All of these horde players are the kind of people who would come to this sub and go "Fucking just get good, wpvp is great"
---
Is it a flex though? Is he trying to convince anyone?
---
I find its usually the PvP server people that's willing to berate and bully people who don't agree with server choices.
---
Live and let live my dude.
---
There is a disparity in faction balance overall.  Cross server doesn't change that.
---
there is so little dmg for melee on Rag, popping bandage is enough to heal yourself back up when you have to go out of melee range.
---
Those pots are a must for ranged because of the Rag bolt deal a lot of regular fire damage, but melee dont get hit by those.
---
How very sad.
---
Same. My chances of reading something correctly the first time are much higher when using comic sans.
---
Well no shit.
---
It's like you all are new and don't understand how the game works.
---
you are a trash human for cheating like this I dont care what activision- blizzard says the game was made for you to interact via one avatar and your a shit human for trying to "do more" people like you and this attitude of cheating "because I can" is what is wrong with the world,
---
That’s not true.
---
Alliance on BfA roam in raids on War Mode because Blizzard gave them a million bonuses and quests since Alliance were under represented. Except now the pendulum shifted into the other direction.
---
I've been asking the same question, I really wish Blizz didn't break the Census addon. I'd like to start up an alt on a PvE Horde server, and eventually transfer my priest over when paid transfers get added.
---
I use zygor and its amazing, i have no complaints
---
Ah I see
---
Dick move to report him, dick move whether you like it or not to crash the market by crafting the helm for free. There are very few ways to make money as an armorsmith, LH Helm is one of them.
---
You're much less deserving of gear than he is. Imagine if someone at your job worked less hours than you, put in less effort, and did less work, but made the same amount of money as you. Would that make any sense? It just seems like 'items in a game' until you realize there are people spending 40+ hours a week farming gold for consumables, getting their prebis, helping out guildies, pvping, and being an active member.
---
In my guild you wouldn't get a single piece of gear unless every other hunter got a piece. While his attitude is shit, he kind of has a point.
---
To answer your original question though, yes people can get petty over loot. That is until you realize some people are putting 40+ hours a week for a shot at that loot just to have it taken by people who login for a raid then don't login until the next raid.
---
RemindMe! 3 weeks laugh at this guy
---
Why are you assuming that OP's crying, more than an hour after he posted this comment? 
---
&gt;I see people are quick to instinctively go into the defensive mode at a silly picture depicting the glory of phase 2 even when absolutely nothing has been said lmao
---
Pretty sure you're projecting your own feelings of the situation onto him, judging by the way you're crying about how terrible it is for rogues to be camping in IF.
---
dont worry if i go full ret no raid will take me XD 
---
i know that for me to be able to raid i will need to put 30 or 31 in holy, but i dunno what to do with the rest 20/21 points
---
its playable if you stay in ironforge and never leave.  
---
wanna farm your pre-raid-bis? expect to be chain ganked from thorium point to the entrance.  
---
expect to die at least 20 times.  
---
i dont see how thats got anything to do with pvp though.  
---
to me its zone disruption
---
No, to get honor. Can't blame people for wanting to stay ahead of the curve. If blizzard implements content that has rewards, people are going to want to get those rewards.
---
Stalagg Alliance posters really love to hype up grizzly on here. To the point that it feels like wartime propaganda. The most ive seen of grizzly is them camping ungoro fp and them occasionally showing up to gadgetzhan then getting wiped by the random horde there.

---
Whenever I use it it just says that it couldn't find a translation. Even to all the confirmed ones people out on here
---
You don't tell people to roll on a item and then distribute it differently when somebody won it already. If they wanted to change loot rules they do it after or before the raid not during and after a roll. lol
---
You forgot about the part where you popped grenades, consumables, on use trinkets, and rocket helm on someone at half HP and mana trying to farm gold.  So many horde wannabe high warlords on my server go into the world with tons of gold worth of consumables throwing all their money at BS PvP items just to gank people that aren't even out there to PvP.
---
Do people really not do this? Fully Open DKP seems absurd. Having rogues bid on bindings or people getting bis denied so someone can have a minor upgrade or what they mistakenly believe is an upgrade
---
Like any system of LC it obviously requires trust but theres a lot of outside sources that can be used to establish prio in a less subjective fashion
---
My guild RUIN is recruiting. We have room for both. We will also help you get BiS. Just mention Gadalica recommended you and you would like some info on raid. We r tues/thurs 730 server to 1030 server. Currently split raiding with another guild because we are short about 15 people. We r netherwind horde.
---
It’s a little far fetched when comparing population data. 6% is a huge difference because it also takes away 6% from the minority faction. 
---
You can say far fetched, but I prefer disingenuous.
---
stop leveling tailoring (throw all ur cloth in your bank) - buying the thread &amp; new patterns adds up.
---
dont sell greens on the ah unless they're valuable (i used an ah addon like TSM to immediately check if the item was worth throwing on the ah) - vendor them instead.
---
loot. everything. vendor it.
---
stop taking slight upgrades as quest rewards - take the item that vendors for the most
---
from level 35-40 you will make more gold than you would have thought. i think i was sitting at like 60g at 35 and asking the same questions as you. made the 90g required *easily* by lvl 39.5ish.
---
after the mount i had 2g.... by level 41.5-42 i had 80g again - from vendoring everything.
---
youll make the gold fast. dont stress
---
Dont know battlegroups would be used if they went that route. From memory it was like, 2-3 battlegroups per datacenter but I dont think Blizzard have datacenters around the country like they used to. 
---
For NA they could have battlegroups for east and west.
---
Tauren, but aiming for edgmaster handguards
---
solo DM and test it on the ogre spirits at the end.
---
I leveled on a pvp realm this time around because I did pve originally. World pvp is pretty lame for the most part, the one exception being fighting a few horde here and there when you get a good 1v1 although rare and sometimes the big fights at Blackrock Mountain when numbers are similar. Overall there is no reason to play on a pvp realm unless you just like to grief people trying to quest, the lopsided server numbers also makes it generally less sport and more griefing as well. Ideally I will spend most of my pvp time in bgs when they drop and have a more "balanced" experience as you stated.
---
You just didn’t have enough reports on the player me thinks.
---
You mean play by the shitty ranking system that they didn't design?
---
Improved sinister strikes really ? nice meme
---
I actually looked it up but failed, lol
---
Boomer salt

I disapprove of loot council, even more behind closed doors. I will see how this pans out, but the ONLY few things I can get are 2h weps, because ofc all the pvp usable gear that has stamina also has +defense and that oBVioUslY iS tAnK GEar onLy. If the loot council loot councils themselves even the 2h from rag to themselves thats it, /gquit
---
Only thing that makes me really worried is that the longer I stay hoping to finally get gear I could have spent somewhere else doing rolls against others :s 
---
Loot council = politics
---
Past guild has disbanded because of loot council and this raid group formed a new one, which uses loot council
---
I've been told this loot council is different (by the loot council themselves ofc). Ofc it is... 
---
Hope BWL releases before I can really play again and I will not have to cry on reddit and /gquit already
---
Does moonlite work better on a shitty connection?
---
Once you get some tank gear you can just tank as full fury and keep aggro in dungeons dual wield on trash and most bosses and in mc slap on a shield and ot trash and adds. Bosses where no 3rd ot is needed just dps and still do top dps, and ony is a joke to tank.
---
GMs are the least paid employees at Blizzard. The amount of time it takes for them to auto-respond to one of those tickets while also simultaneously responding to several other tickets is miniscule compared to the amount of manhours, wait-times and costs linked to patching such a minor thing.
---
It ain’t rocket appliances
---
Does anyone remember if there were any rep Tabards or items you could get to increase your reputation gain for warsong or alterac?
---
You died without using either Ice Block?
---
You simply have to be in inspect range and then target a friendly player. (No need to manually inspect someone)  
---
Uploads are super fast. Upload and see for yourself!  
---
Yes eventually there will be talents.
---
That 50's music just sets the tone :D
---
Fighting deathballs as a mage with invis pots and sappers is hilarious, fighting deathballs as a rogue is lame
---
Good job
---
Mages aren't even the worst offender, I got globaled by a rogue when I was resetting Dire Maul last night, and warlocks will just dot you up in the hopes somebody else kills you.
---
People play rogues because they want an unfair advantage (stealth). When they lose that advantage they turn into the cowards they truly are, and run away.
---
Knowing the full story might?   
---
I don't see anywhere in OP's story that he actually tried to talk about it with the GM.
---
Interesting. I have been farming in the exact same spot. On my second kill, I got one, but since then, not a single one has dropped. I guess I’ll get back on the grind this evening
---
&gt;You'll have a much easier time farming the gold and buying them off AH than farming them yourself
---
This is generally speaking the case for many if not the majority of crafting materials. Especially the ones that are sourced from uncommon mob types.
---

Use markers and focus more on Elites than non elites. Skull (1st DPS target) will almost always end up getting pulled off of you. I usually will charge at skull, cast a sunder, demo shout, the. Tab to the other elites and start building aggro on them. Once skull pulls off you you can use your taunt on it to bring it back and keep focusing on X and other targets. By then skull will probably be dead and you repeat.
---
Trash in dungeons usually does not so much damage and should be able to be handled by your party DPS. If you are prot spec I like to CC monsters I lost aggro in with either concussive blow or revenge stun. 
---
You can use your taunt or rage abilities on the other trash if you have spare rage/cooldown but as long as you are marking and focusing on elites it shouldn’t be a problem.
---
I haven't played Wow in years, rolled rogue because I used to main one in wotlk. Combat daggers,lvl 41. I got itchy to kill a lvl 35 hunter, because Ive got bad history with them. Couldn't stun lock him til it's death, got freezing trapped, tried to catch up, got kited, tried to run away - died. I don't gank greens, but hunters make my question my morals.
---
 Never been this embarrassed my entire wow playtime. And being combat specced I don't believe I will reliably kill anyone until I get adrenaline rush..
---
I'm level 51 but hey i do what i can
---
depends i guess what the battle groups are like.
---
if its is horde dominated battle group then the que time for horde will be longer i feel like i remember having 30 min que's in vanilla as horde.  the horde will 100% turn to open world pvp to fill in that time.  At the same time alliance will have quicker ques so that may take a lot of the 60's out of the open world leaving the sub
---
Basically I think it will be rotating groups ganking in an area area, yes it will be better but if your server and battle group are horde heavy chances are as alliance you will still be getting farmed.
---
It works well for my guild. We do silent bid dkp with a min bid so you don't have people just 1 upping each other. It basically has become round robin. New guys haven't had a problem getting gear unless they're a rogue warrior or mage as those are more competitive. But even then the beauty of dkp is that once people have thebcommin pieces of gear the new guys can come in and grab them for really low bids. And if you were a core raider who had 100% raid participation would you want someone coming in and sniping mageblade after you put all the work getting that on farm?
---
Okay, so you originally brought this hypothetical person up as a guy who needs the item, but prior to it dropping he didnt know about the item.  
---
Now let's bring up a different hypothetical person who does know about the item, so he pretends that he needs it, but really just wants to sell it. We let him roll need while we all greed, now what? He just cashed in on the item in a shitty and unfair way.
---
Cause it's old and we've all seen it.
---
As long as your still in the instance you can trade it.
---
Ok stupid.
---
Simple rule for me: if you are running a dungeon/raid with a group, then everyone should contribute to the common good, so basicly giving water/food is no different than providing a buff, its just dumping mana with no costs for you and benefit for all. If you are doing your business and someone aproches you and aks for water its about to the mage to negotiate or give ir for free. If someone without notice just opens a trade window to a mage without asking then they should expect to pay for it.
---
Also when I am running a rogue and the group gets a locked box drop I always aoffer to open it for teh group without any tips. In groups people should contribute to the common good as long as it has no monetary cost for you. Out of a group its debatable as long as you dont act like an ass.
---
pro-er tip, sending felhunter does not interact with gc, so do both.
---
Fun one  :D
---
Wait for the arrival of battlegrounds, if things don't improve after that either deal with it or reroll PvE.
---
You've not met a bre wielding pally yet?
---
I deleted a character and re-made it with the same name and I had to wait like a minute before I was able to re-make it because it kept saying the name was taken after I'd tried deleting it.
---
There's a dude in my guild who rolls the same class who is incredibly gear whorey.  We have 5 shamans and he's the only one who bitches.
---
I am both!  I dont easily fit into a bracket, I like lots of things young people do and also lots of things old people do.  I party and dance all night sometimes and then sometimes go to be at 10pm. what can you do except you know take me for my words and not try and read to much into it? Lets just ignore the point I made about how the game is designed and focus on me, sounds good.
---
A few times I've tried to pop a health potion (or healthstone) but instead it's removed from my inventory, the cooldown is activated, and I die before getting the HP back. Nothing so far has been more rage inducing.
---
/stopcasting

/cast [target=mouseover][harm] polymorph
---
Are you sure you're not using it during your GCD?
---
How much does horde outnumber alliance by in your server? 3:1?
---
If you are anything else you just go whatever, because edgemasters become mandatory. 
---
Then again you can roll on DB, Viskag etc. as long as your guilds allows you to. 
---
For example my guild has viskag locked for rogues, DB for orcs, brutality is up for grabs for non orc warrior and rogues. 
---
That's why I went with 2handers. Not as much competition even though they arent quite as good.
---
Look at the fish recipes. A ton of fish go for a few copper each and can be made into food quite easily.
---
I have tried for the past 10 minutes, seems like it was grabbed sadly
---
No he simply just equips it after winning the roll.
---
Also you dont need to “plan” on what you need. You can get unexpected upgrades which is exactly what BoEs can be as they often drop random and unpredictably
---
That's not the fucking point. God damn you people are dense.
---
I mean in my experience, not much attention is paid to the DR. "Kill em all and let Blizz sort em out" basically
---
I must've missed the path notes where Blizzard was forcing individuals to camp FPs if they want to farm honor, there must be no other way to get it!
---
This is such a cop-out and just seems to be used by people to try and excuse their own shitty behavior for farming honor the easy way.  The honor system was setup this way during vanilla and outside of very rare instances of griefing, I NEVER remember this happening on any of the PvP servers I played on (which was multiple) prior to BGs launching.  Groups rolling over people in zones and towns?  Sure, it sucks when leveling but that's the way it is and it usually passes but camping FPs is just weak af and if that's the only way you can farm honor you need to git gud.
---
My guild gave me Felheart Robes when I was 58. We had to pug to get full raids so we were free-rolling back then, 60 or not! Feels good to be a gangsta, cheers OP.
---
29 twink druid. Spec into feral and get feline swiftness for 30% move speed increase. Plus bear charge. WSG king.
---
No, that's just the game's tick updates taking a while to trigger the change in location. It feel similar to spell batching but it's a different system. Sometimes you can get a fair distance into a building on a mount before being dismounted.
---
Yea. on my Rogue I didn't think at lvl 34 or so that I would make enough on time then I just start to make more around 37.
---
The key to money is to do quests/grind mobs/farm herb,mineral,skins.
---
I also planned my lvling build when I was lvl 12 and only bought skills that I would use. Im alst 50 and only bough rank 1 crippling poison and up to rank 3 instant poison and haven't bought any other poisons
---
Most of the top honor people on my server are rogues who sit in ironforge all day. Why wouldn't they keep doing it? It's great honor farm.
---
I also have prat installed, but if i disable either quest addon, theres no stutter, even with prat.  Unless the quest addons are conflicting with prat, I'd rather have prat than the quest addons.
---
This applies to the Venture guild on Flamelash-EU a bit too much.      
---
Although I'd also add: 'Now the hunter called in his friends, and sadly their frostbolts were better then mine. I shall now cast portal far away from them, as they're no match for my hardcore PvP soul.'
---
What level was the character you deleted?
---
There's a difference between hiring one upfront and asking for money when the time comes. Generally when a tank or healer sells a run, it's because they don't need anything from the instance, no loot, no quests, etc. If a tank simply volunteers to run a dungeon and doesn't discuss any payment upfront, then it ought to be safe to conclude that he needs stuff from the instance just like everyone else does. Thus, expecting some who need it to have to pay others who need it is an absurd expectation.
---
What if he doesnt though? I obviously brought up that hypothetical person as someone who plans to snake the item so he can sell it.
---
That's super weird. I can't even imagine how a bot could know you deleted your character. Super weird
---

Cool vid Bro. So what you're saying is, **PVP HAPPENED ON A PVP SERVER** ???????????
---
Madness, who would have thought!
---
I'm curious why you think that? Have you had a bad experience with dkp?
---
But but but #nochanges!! Also I just realized that I don't know about this because despite raiding every week for the last two months I've never gotten anything.
---
This one thing that happened 15+ years ago totally justifies the things happening today.
---
Let's hope you don't use that general train of thought in about politics and other issues.
---
It’s all just pixels bro, literally no reason to get upset over not getting loot. You act like MC isn’t going to be around forever.
---
“I don’t want this advantage and it has no place in classic.”
---
That was your point. Delete it, get over it.
---
I'm a warlock, everytime I ask a mage usually like,"Can I please get some water?" they've never had an issue and tip what I can afford.
---
Yikes
---
as per usual for a rogue, you just gotta be patient. Wait for stragglers to leave LoS of their group, snipe'm out. Or wait for the end of the fight when people are dying/scrambling on the enemy side, and start cleaning up.
---
Being one of the first in on a deathball is definitely a fruitless effort
---
Thank you!
---
It probably just spams character names in the character creator with a list of desirable names, hoping one frees up like in this case.

I was exclusively PvP servers back in the day.  Vanilla all the way to Cataclysm.

I don't PvP anymore, so I honestly don't give a shit about racials, I'm just calling it like I see it, and the way I see the Alliance races is as absolute clown looks with insane PvE and PvP advantages due to Paladins and AV advantages due to layout, yet somehow people don't choose Alliance.
---
Fixed the dog is linked to her now

The black widows east of raven hill
---
And the phrase went through several iterations. I parsed through various sound files of troll dialogue and pronoun usage is a bit inconsistent. I still don't really understand the dialect they're going for, but it's cool nonetheless.
---
But yeah, thanks for the input! At this point it's too late to change the dialogue (sparing everyone a repost on this site and others), but in the rare instance I work on more pieces with troll dialogue I'll look into differentiating the various Horde dialects.
---
One thing's for sure though, people gave (and still give) trolls a hard time. They're not that ugly. :(
---
As a lvl 60 MC raiding holy priest considering respeccing to disc with PI, assuming no one player stands out as top DPS, what class should be prioritized as best burst damage for the PI duration?
---
No problem. I love my Paladin, it excels at being a healer in both PvE and PvP and also being a 1v1 god in PvP as Reckoning spec.  
---
Tanking is only for dungeons, but easy to hold aggro and do dmg at the same time - uses a lot of mana though.  
---
Also you have to make it on another server, because you can not have both horde and alliance on the same server :)
---
Piggybacking on that, for the moment there's no recipe which gives more than 12 stamina right?
---
Til PvP is toxicity according to reddit
---
Thought this was Herod-Alliance at first glance. Was only 3 Lionheart Crafters alliance side who all agreed to charge 150g/craft for months.
---
GM of a guild gets the recipe and subsequently starts paying people to let him craft it
---
Life is tedious and hostile, should we all quit that as well?
---
At launch I had to choose between playing with my RL friends on one server or playing with my old guild on another. I chose my guild, which just last week broke up because of stupid drama. I wish I would have chosen to play with my friends.
---
worth noting that you need less hit with OEB because of the +8 swords as well
---
 BG's and ~~IMPEACHMENT~~ on the menu for December! Feels GOOD! 
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Omg...
---
I too am the best at pvp. This morning while I was minning rocks I came across a 60 mage at 50% hp! I quickly popped every cd I had, and 2 shot him with an insta chain lightning then an earth shock. The mage didnt stand a chance! Sometimes I wonder what made me this good at the game.
---
IMO - fishing and cooking can be skipped for now if you wanna grind. First aid can always be leveled while waiting for boats.
---
I say fishing and cooking because they are easy to level together but I have found it wasn’t worth it cause all high level food is quite cheap
---
Comprehension is hard for you.
---
Ahh, the daily dose of alliance screetching :)
---
Be prepared for ups and downs. 
---
Tanking can be very rewarding and extremely fun and engaging. It can also be very frustrating and demoralizing. Just stick with it, do your homework, watch other tanks (streams and youtube), and run tons of dungeons.
---
Archivist Galford has our boots. (next to last boss)
---
The unforgiven has our head (back door is faster run and Unforgiven is on the way via that route)
---
I think you just broke the first rule.
---
Then it isn't spy.
---
Oh no. It's like I said something that makes sense and has roots in logic. Better try to downplay anything about it making sense by assuming I'm lazy or have no skills and I'm triggered by dying. I'm not great, and I rolled warrior who raids so I'm fury. I'm a potato in world pvp and I know it. Doesn't change the fact that pissed off people get revenge when they can.
---
It might become competitive again in BWL as supposedly most bosses in BWL have 4.6k armor. 
---
You're right though that BRE is hot garbage in boss fights in MC.
---
Man, you got downvoted but you're not wrong. I barely grinded honor last week. Maybe 3-4 hours total. I did that instead of dungeons and still ended up with 15k. But I did half solo as a rogue and the other half in a 5 man.
---
It would only count players with 15+ HKs, but yeah you could get pretty close
---
The saying goes change to fury 5 mins before the raid. Replace mortal strike with that garbage ability u get from fury, add deathwish to your hotbar, also heroic strike. 
---
Well done. You have mastered the role of dps warrior!!
---
Oeb sux. Just farm gold for edgemasters so you are more flexible can pick up daggers or swords. F rogues.
---
Arcanite is less than 10g every 2 days, that's nothing really. If you want better gold from transmutes, go grind out timbermaw friendly for earth to water recipe.
---
There's a lot of potions you can make for profit, but prices go up and down all the time so need to catch good timings on when you buy and sell things.
---
Fast queues only to get camped at the gy! I like it.
---
Everyone should have a 9-5. No excuse to be playing this game if you work off-hours!!
---
By downloading it. He claims he doesn't have spy in his add-ons list yet blames spy. It's lying and pandering. Reported for low effort.
---
FYI there's another mage who commented here who said he will happily trade for free, but if someone just opens a trade window and says nothing, he considers that rude and gives them nothing.
---
Since it costs you nothing to be polite and simply ask for water, I think this is completely understandable.
---
Apparently it’s harder for you because you don’t even understand what you said, lol
---
Bro, never WoW and Ambien.
---
It's not how it was in vanilla. Servers in classic have much larger populations than they did in vanilla. Thus world pvp is drastically different.
---
I have no idea what happened to all the hunters. On Grob Horde side I feel like they’re only a myth. We’ve had Mages and Rogues for last boss in UBRS
---
You too, eh?
---
I think pretty much everything works on this internal 3s check.
---
Things like resistances to CC are checked on this timer, so there's a chance you can break long CC's after 3 seconds.
---
Also things like AoE dmg ticks. Blizzard for example can deal no damage to a mob if it makes it through the affected area between these ticks.
---
Adding on: If you are an alchemist as well, all the herbs for elixir of greater intellect drop here too, so easy additional int.
---
Also I saved my devout gear for this, as it offers a lot of raw stam+int and I find the shield proc set bonus goes off at least twice each lasher pack, which is nice
---
Probably because DB will be locked to orcs in most raids and tauren have to get into queue behind them. 
---
Else DB should be better across the board. 
---
Heroic Strike queuing for OH 100% hit chance easier with 2.9 MH, bigger WW, OP and WF hits.
---
Same, I hit 60 during the third or fourth week and was instantly bored. Not interested in dedicating a schedule to raiding, especially since so many guilds seem to do Friday nights which is when I want to go out. It’ll be nice to hop online and queue for a BG, do some other stuff while I wait, and log off whenever I’m done/whenever I please.  
---
I was a day away from ending my sub because I was bored - this announcement saved my interest in the game completely. Can’t wait for December 10th.
---
Nope, not the same thing.
---
I’ve had a lot of good experiences and I think this is a lot of good fun. World bosses are one of the few activities I encourage this behavior for. It’s the only large scale world pvp that makes sense other than raid night battles to MC. If you can’t have the resource that makes you stronger, then you can at least stop the opposing faction from getting stronger. 
---
Agree with the tediousness of classic, but that’s why I love WoW, feels like every decision is meaningful if you’re trying to save time. Makes the few hours a day I play feel important somehow. 
---
If you don’t like the hostility then you should try a PvE realm, in PvP realms this should be expected behavior, it’s why they separated the two. PvE you still get the tediousness but you don’t have to die all the time, would recommend if you’re getting frustrated.
---
It's funny, I see much more alliance killing on site than I do Horde. I'm a PvE spec'd resto shaman, so I basically have no chance in a fight and try to avoid PvP. I'm only on this server because my RL friends are, otherwise I could give two shits about wPvP. 
---
With that being said, it's always rogues and/or mages ripping horde apart. I've seen a lot people complaining about &lt;Synergy&gt; camping Dire Maul lately too.
---
Nothing at all, which is what makes the incessant complaining rather intolerable.
---
You'll have to ask the rest of the sub, but my guess it boils down to "I can't handle pvp"
---
It was fixed a few weeks ago, it doesn’t make the fight that much harder though, just freeze Simone and kitekill her pet first, after that Simone is ez(don’t even need to vs if you don’t want to)
---
Yes, a quick search yields a bunch of results. Such as this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/db4xs0/noisy_mechanostriders_silence_them_with_this/
---
Coming from a Horde player with a massive numbers advantage, of course
---
If you're willing to invest, alchemy has the highest passive gold/day ratio of any profession. Transmitting undeath to water is generally 16-20g profit per day on many servers. That said, the recipe is often 600g or more. It's basically a WoW 401k. If you plan to play for the entirety of classic, it will likely earn you several thousand gold for almost no effort.
---
I can relate they do exist
---
Ohh man got the Reddit police. I bet you think everyone is lying about everything.
---
Lolz
---
You need to farm the correct stuff. Dreamfoil and Gromsblood are worthless to farm in the overworld because of DM East. 
---
Mountain Silversage, Plagueblooms, etc. However have a good amount of worth.
---
It is rarely worth it to sell potions in the auction house, at least compared to the herb costs. Only exceptions are like Wednesday.
---
I'm hoping for a dirty sanchez
---
8 and I have all of my whispers, LFG and my party chat in their own separate windows.
---
It’s every post on this subreddit now. Literally every post is alliance complaining. 
---
I understand OP was trying to be funny but doesn’t change the fact he’s still complaining.
---
That rare scenario does happen though, keeping everything fair like this obviously isnt a perfect system either, just the lesser of two evils I suppose. I'm literally just trying to explain to you the standard that the majority of random pugs will run on, but yeah. Enjoy wasting your roll while your party gets a chance at a ton of gold haha
---
Yes, exactly.  Hit capping for 2h fury for DPS is fairly easy, and the OEB helps even more, so you can better optimize your gear for more AP/crit than focusing on +hit gear.
---
Why play in easy mode if you're so skilled? Go Alliance if you're a real pvper.
---
Aw a carebear support group thread
---
If you don't have a shaman/paladin + priest in your backpack it's your own fault to be farmed.
---
These three can take on groups of 7 easily.
---
One shot the first two, then rape the rest.
---
I honestly almost never have trouble with it when I'm reading comic sans lol its... comical
---
Says the horde player on an imbalanced server.
---
You can't reset the dog anymore.
---
I had to do the quest about 2 or 3 days after the "fix" went live. I still think she might be the easiest boss of the 4.
---
Anyway, just engange her way in the south near the lake and little hill. Put down a freezing trap and open with aimed shot, concussive shot on her. The dog will run ahead and get trapped. Kite her around the lake as shown in almost all the videos and concussive shot the dog should it catch up. Never had an issue with him getting anywhere near me.
---
The amount of people on Herod that won’t leave IF is staggering
---
Times change, we aren't playing vanilla.
---
But guess what, if the ranking system wasn't so bad and was actually based on a rating system within instanced BGs.. then yeah not many people would camp flight paths.
---
They'd be spending their time forming premades to try to rank up
---
It really doesn't matter how much you bitch and moan.. it's not going to change player behavior. Many of them don't like the system either.. but they have to live with it because the nochanges people ruined any chance of having a polished classic experience
---
Don't like people camping a flight path? Well I have good news for you. You can get up off your butt, form a group, take some initiative, and go fight them. This game is an MMO: you aren't going to have everyone bend over backwards to ensure you enjoy the game
---
It should just be r/ZandalarTribe :)
---
We panic looted kaz thinking the same thing would happen to us. Turns out the 2 hour grace window does not apply to world bosses and GM would not restore the loot. I now have the shame sitting in my inventory forever. Warlock pants dropped.
---
Yall need to stop think this dudes career is over because he ninjad loot. Dude was a popular twitch streamer before he joined method.
---
&lt; "Blizzaro hored bg q tiems 3 hrs too long liturrruhly unplayuhbleew."
---
For those that don't speak Orcish, let me translate:
---
&lt; "I regret the situation I myself have created."
---
I wonder if it would be possible to sue blizzard for not shutting down this app. Yes it is ruining the "surprise" element of the game before people bitch about it but hey as long as it benefits you then what the hell does it matter right?
---
The original blink icon was a warden, they redrew it into a dwarf for WoW.
---
Good way to not fuck up again is ez.. 
---
read item description :)
---
im more than sure ur heals wont miss! if u aing got no hit :)
---
TBH these players should be timed out, not banned, for 30 minutes due to griefing. It's prohibiting gameplay and they know to the extent of which they are doing it.
---
I've been raiding as that imp sprint backstab pvp spec, and i sort of feel like pvping as regular combat daggers was better for an overall spec (too cheap for weekly respecs)
---
If you're not focused on maximizing your threat generation then if is fairly widely accepted that you're not a very good tank. Lol, if you don't need high threat generation then your dps is shit in which case your entire guild/raid is full of either casuals or people who don't know how to play. 
---
Hahahaha, deep prot doesn't generate more threat. Deep  prot isn't that great for threat generation. Deep prot is more about mitigating damage, not generating threat
---
Mate, I don't want to tell you it like it is but you don't know what you're talking about, sorry.
---
Congrats!!
---
I am the exact same way. There were a lot of things I wished I did when I originally played, some simple (getting professions to max, obtaining all the keys in the game) some harder (getting all the enchanting recipes, doing every raid). It feels amazing when you knock something off your list...that has haunted you for 15 or so years. :)
---
That's kinda how rogue works though.  They beat you with their opener.
---
It’s really destroyed my classic experience. You used to be able to hide out of site and drink/eat but now I’m getting charged by warriors that are LoS.
---
What server?
---
Alliance Hunter:  * *Is AFK* *
---
Horde Mage: "... So anyway, I started blasting!"
---
Imo it would be fine if when you die in a capital of the opposing faction you have to have another player res you or spirit rez, no 2 minute corpse run just to do it again. Like there is this troll rogue on my server who just attacks someone every 2 mins inbetween IF bank and AH, he maybe gets one kill but then always dies. But he's right back 2 mins later to do it again. There needs to be real risk.
---
He is just trolling with this post. It's the opposite of what he is actually saying. He probably means "Spy is ok, stop complaining about it every day and just pay the game".
---
It's almost like everyone on this sub forgets what a Rogue actually is.
---
Ye it's not during GCD, and I tried your macro but it doesn't even cast poly or show the tooltip (I included the showtooltip at the start).
---
I'm actually on deviate delight, not sure why their guild is named bigglesworth lol
---
You can attack people who flag themselves.
---
There's a difference between no life and top pve raiding.
---
It's sad you think this is an honestly good 'whatabout'ism though
---
Everyone hates asmongold because he makes a ton of money playing wow and that's everyone's dream. I hate him for this reason
---
Definitely stonetalon mountains
---
You can remove the sound file from your game folder.
---
&gt; WoW is forgiving. Dying stings enough to fight to survive, but not enough to rage quit. 
---
Just wait untill you finally reach the mountain after 25 minutes only to be mind controlled back as far as they can bring you before you die.
---
If you die like that, you start losing parts of yourself before you know it, sanity flying out of the window...
---
well well well
---
I'd be interested in knowing this as well.  I can't get binds to work in itemrack.  Every time I use the bind i get a warning about running a custom script or something.
---
I think reddit is just an echo-chamber of complainers.  Kromcrush is really good, I think a lot of servers are much better than you would expect (if you use reddit as your sole source of wow info).
---
Man, I haven't seen an Alliance run mountain in a while! Bizarro you, indeed! Fwiw, know that is not me.
---
That’s fair, I agree I enjoy pvp more, but for different reasons. I just like fighting other players. Feels a lot more “skill-based” than PvE. 
---
Only reason I wish I rolled PvE is because I barely have any time to pvp and I know people are gonna be sweating for those ranks.
---
Alliance have BG advantage imo. Should be us doing the premade gy camping.
---
I think at this point he’s famous for being famous. Just got started into wow streaming at the right time. He does get involved with drama and stuff but I don’t think that’s where his long term success has come from
---
Omg, praise Alliance Jesus!
---
Suing blizzard for an addon made by the community is some of the most boomer shit I’ve ever heard
---
It's about removing an unfair mod genius.
---
Sat here grinding mobs and collecting silk for my shadoweave set. Actually enjoyed the grind.
---
I don't remember good food that could restore a lot of HP.  
---
IIRC best of the best restore 2k HP per 30 seconds. And they require not-so-common fish like Sunscale Salmon or Lobsters.  
---
Food from common fish restore 1.3k HP.
---
Not even vaguely what I said but ok guy
---
same
---
People live vicariously through him as they wish they could sit around and play wow and get paid for it
---
Took 17 hours to reply to ours but they would not restore the loot. Rip warlock pants.
---
This guy gets it.
---
It doesn't matter though they just Rez a couple mins later and do it again. They're like herpes you can't just get rid of them.
---
The ClassicCastbars addon has got to go.
---
I didn't know I had it. Must've come with another addon or something. With that being said, with that being said I just gained an advantage by it telling me an enemy was casting fear. I don't want this advantage and it has no place in classic.
---
Why would he be upset, he totally owned that hunter!
---
I had it done to me when I originally played wow.  I thought it was hilarious.  I eventually went back and did it to a different person myself and then helped him kill some stuff and we were laughing.  I'd see him around when he was max level and we'd /wave to each other.  He's been on my bnet friends list now for years.  I think theres nuance and this isnt a zero sum game.  That's been my experience for the last 15ish years on a pvp server.
---
Username checks out
---
As a rogue theres only 1 thing to do. Wait near uc/if for solo/duo people heading out. Group up with 1 more rogue to ensure the 100% kill. As alliance u could also chill near the entrance to wpl since theres always a steady flow of horde going in. The amount of honor rogues get is insane rn and bgs will balance things more out for a few classes like warrs or healers in general.
---
I just went through the same thing. Had a ton of trouble until I realized the key is to kill her pet, FD to reset her, RUN back and pull her again before her pet respawns. Her pet WILL come back but only after like 5 full minutes. Maybe 10. She's cake without her pet. 
---
Hope this helps!!! Good luck friend!!!
---
Why would that make sense? He was suspended from a different game...
---
You might want to switch to Alliance on Mirage Raceway as it's 60+% of the population, I have characters on both Alliance and Horde there and on Alliance side you find groups way faster.
---
He's good at creating fake drama. He's good at baiting the huge alt-right scene on twitch. He's good at pumping out worthless youtube videos for clicks. He's good at being a "curator" on youtube by reacting to actual good wow videos of others. He's good at acting. He's not good at the game.
---
He has played and streamed WoW basically every day since streaming services first began. At that point it really doesn't matter how bad at the game he is or how socially stunted he often is.
---
Zerging someone 20v1 isn't difficult. Corpserunning 25 times to get from A to B isn't difficult. 
---
Neither are particularly fun though ;) Imagine people discussing flaws in a game they play!
---
If you have no weaponskill racial it's *mandatory* to get edgemasters.
---
No other gloves save much later come close. +3% hit, +increased glancing blow damage, +0.28% crit blows everything out of the water.
---
If you pick a non-meta class to DPS, you need to go the extra mile to get edgemasters, else you will not compete in a well structured guild.
---
:Hunter rezzes just to /salute the mage:
---
Blizzard doesn’t care. They won’t the pop to go down and it’s only an issue on a few servers. Re roll while the game has meaningless raids or just don’t play till BGs because it’s not getting addressed.
---
You hit the square nail head on, apply directly to the forehead.
---
It kinda is :)
---
Kinda sad if that's true.
---
dude, how many corpse runs do  YOU experience to get to any dungeon on a daily basis?   
---
dying 15 to 20 times at least just to get NEAR the entrance is unreasonable.  
---
40man raids camping entrances to different dungeons at the same time additionally to the chain ganking at, for example, dire maul.youll encounter the first grp at the ramp, the second around the first corner and so on. and if you successfully died your way to the entrance (took 10 deaths to get to the first corner), you have to be lucky enough to revive and actually making it in before you get feared just to die further away from the entrance.  
---
and all this isnt happening cause alliance doesnt like to pvp. it happens cause there are so many more players on horde side who are trying their best to act as shitty as they possibly can.  
---
chain ganking people who just want to get to a dungeon or raid camping dungeon entrances isnt pvp, its preventing alliance players from playing the game.  
---
alliance doesnt have enough people to casually 40-man camp all dungeon or raid entrances simultaneously all over the map.  
---
how does a city raid indicate that theres no underpopulation???? thats a very weak argument. even a population of 100 could organize one.  
---
you see more alliance farming? how dare they trying to farm in grps in horde claimed territory!   
---
are you really serious about not noticing alliance getting slaughtered 24/7???  
---
the imbalance is 30/70 almost and you really think thats not much difference? its a difference of thousands of players.  
---
additionally, there are lots of alliance who just stopped playing, but still count. more than 30 people in my guild of around 200 (alts included) havent logged in for nearly a month and that similar for a lot of guilds.
---
Please don't PI a hunter.
---
He's horde, he just failed to mention his 19 friends that helped.
---
Appreciate the feedback! Keep in mind - in the description is states the clips are from the past couple days! Just wanted to release a little edit on some good crits and hopefully save some nice 2v1, 3v1 scenarios for a much better video!
---
I would expect them to resemble videos from vanilla WoW. Nothing to really mix up besides making some intricate intro. Keep in mind, content is a bit dry atm with no BGs and honor system just releasing...
---
Stampi bae
---
It can't be banned.
---
You won't miss anything until WotLK and they add levels 71-80. This is where first instance would be removed - Naxxramas 40.
---
Reported for what?
---
It's PvP on a PvP server and Blizz has already stated it's ok. It's intended (and opt-in via rolling on a PvP server) gameplay.
---
This was meant to be a fun edit because I enjoy making videos. Saving some of the better clips you mentioned for a longer/much better video.
---
well that's too bad because top tanks in the world agree with me. So it's probably you who don't know what you're talking about :/ sorry
---
Yaaaasssss
---
Care to link that statement?
---
Water elementals in EPL and azshara satyr farming are good spots. With p2 out, I would suggest the latter
---
So true. Most won't even queue up though tbh. People who play alliance are afraid of pvp.
---
Hell I recently tried to make a ticket and I was just stuck in a loading screen for FAQ answers. It never loaded so I couldnt make the ticket.
---
I'm sorry but this is what you signed up for. WoW pvp was never about skill, it's gear and level based and skill only comes into play when people are the same level with similar gear which is a rare match up. I doubt most of these people even think they're skillfully out playing people. They just do it because they can and the whole "fuck the alliance" or "fuck the horde" mentality.
---
Definitely not the case on mine. It just recently started averaging 80g on my server down from 120g. But I talked someone into selling it for 55g so I finally just bought it.
---
As someone that plays both factions, there seems to be a difference in demographics. Ngl. I say that preferring horde.
---
It seems a bit more common to find a „red is dead“ mentality among horde.
---
Classic is a big deal for these ppl who have only played p.servers for the past decade, they know nothing else, and if somebody does something thats "against" what they mean is the correct way to play Classic, they go REEEE
---
(Assuming he is 1 of those shitlers that only played p.servers the past decade)
---
I enjoy this song a lot actually. What kind of genre's do you like to see in PVP videos?
---
Yep!
---
It wouldn't surprise me either way if activision/blizz allows or disallows any particular word that might possibly be translated into something "offensive" in any language.
---
Earth elementals in Silitus. Fire elementals in Un'Goro.
---
Only worth 1 honor point? 1 more than I had!
---
Yeah, I too think he has good opinions from what I've watched. Thanks for the positive reply.
---
&gt;Some guy is crashing the price on something you've spent a lot of money to optain the right to create
---
Obtain the right to create? I'm going to disagree as it's not a *right* per se.  Nor is real money spent to obtain the *ability* to *craft* it. And that's just it, it's the *ability* to *craft* it and nothing more.
---
What I'm seeing is that greed drove the reporting. Greed is a feeling, the choice to report, being based on such a feeling is thus illogical. At the end is the day they were emotionally upset that someone was giving away for free what they were hoping to make game currency on. 
---
This happened to me and due to the amount of reporting in this case too, those who were selling it on the AH were working together to keep the prices high.
---
On my realm, a warlock chest piece quest makes locks obtain [Robes or Arcana](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5770/robes-of-arcana). They were selling for 11G to 12G on the AH! I spent a weekend farming for and obtained the recipe to craft it.  I them spent the next weeks evenings farming Spider's Silk to make them. I made 18 of them and sole them on the AH for 1G each. 
---
The level of hateful/threatening messages I had received were absurd. These individuals also reported me for absurd things, like an offensive username... It literally reads 'Lilith' but it's spelled differently.
---
Luckily a GM responded within a day of me opening a report for the backlash, as they were falsely reporting me, and nothing affected me directly. The GM I worked with informed me they found these players worked together to inflate the AH price. I know they were punished but unsure what transpired.
---
&gt;  I struggle to understand how this is fun for either side.
---
New to wow pvp I take it?
---
There's an ebb/flow with this. One day you're the one getting camped, the next day you're the one camping.
---
It's why I love playing on pvp realms. I do get a kick out of these new players who make these videos like "OMG this isn't fair!" 
---
I do think wow pvp is a good remedy for the participation trophy generation 🤣🤣
---
Spirit stat is actually of higher value than str/agi while lvling in classic as a warrior. Got to reduce that out of combat time.
---
This so going to be really hard for you to grasp, but I’ll open with a question: who really fucking cares?
---
Is the addon extremely effective and should it probably not be a thing? Sure, why not. Probably not as much of a big thing as what people are making it out to be, but whatever. But right now it is a thing, bitching and whining on Reddit isn’t going to change that. I also don’t spend every second I’m in game thinking “man I’m getting screwed by people using this addon.” I’m just playing the damn game.
---
Secondarily, complaining about “I don’t want this advantage” while using the addon is about the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard in my life. Just stop using it. Nobody is making you.
---
Inb4 “omg but then I’m at a disadvantage.”
---
Don’t know what to tell you, either you really don’t like it and don’t want to use it or you actually just want every advantage possible.
---
Never downloaded it, never used it, never thought about people using it, never felt like I was at a disadvantage. I’m having more fun than OP is.
---
While this may be useful for top tier Guilds who care to micromanage their members gear, overall this is the kind of add-on that I think creates an negative contribution to the community. Mostly because outside of guild usage it will likely just be a whole bunch of outdated info on players that others can use to be exclusionary towards them. Having some sort of purging system for old data might partially alleviate that
---
The horde may think that they’re winning right now, but in the long run they’re going to be the ones sitting in long PUG battleground queues only to get smashed by alliance premades.
---
&gt;Horde flair
---
I think not.
---
My experience with PvE servers is everyone sitting in Stormwind or Ironforge spamming trade for instances because there’s nothing to do outside of instances. 
---
Not making fun, that is literally my experience.
---
&gt; is there a way to mute the sounds the gnome mount makes?
---
Reach exalted with Stormwind :)
---
The one where you are bitching like a child? Yeah, I did
---
I wonder if the restriction is tied to the chest itself, or the fact that master looter is being used? You're probably right though, it's likely that the domo chest is treated like a lootable corpse, and not a chest, but I wouldn't be completely surprised if they overlooked it and setting loot to FFA before the fight allowed anyone to loot it.
---
This isn’t what happened. They couldn’t distribute loot because they changed master loot mid kill and the original leader dipped, leading to nobody getting the 1% spellpower dagger. I had a friend on discord in the rag group it was hilarious. This is why alliance don’t deserve nice things
---
Not from food no. 
---
There is a rum (Rumsey Rum Black Label) that gives +15 stamina and stacks with food buff, for a total of +27 stamina between the two of them. I normally use the Gordok Grog though, because I haven't been able to fish since Phase 2 came out so I ran out of Black Label this week unfortunately.
---
Literally had to form a 2 guild group last night to get into MC its just sad honestly the horde are terrible there but it's a 33% to 67% server
---
Do you think it will actually change anything? I quit before p2 even started since even then you were getting camped everywhere on horde servers. Since that was even without gaining honor, how does BG change anything?
---
Besides, 3 weeks is too long. By then, most players will have unsubbed. Maybr a few come back, see that nothing has changed and then leave again. The only solution is faction balance.
---
?
---
he?
---
I wanted to roll on a PvE but chose PvP to appease my shitty friends who 95% of quit the game at like level 20. It is most definitely not the same as 2005. Back then everyone was bad, just kind of doing whatever and there was way less people. Now you literally have groups of 10 plus guys who are all min maxers just patrolling the end game zones at all times. I haven't been in 1 fight since Phase 2 dropped that wasn't just a completely unfair gank. It's shit. Luckily I'm mostly dungeon focused right now.
---
Your tears sustain me.
---
Hunter, there's 4 of us and a lot of pieces dropped but it's Mc I'll get that shit eventually
---
And that's the reason for the small amount of warriors doing strat live. One orb on my server is 18-25g. 
---
Who would fly to EPL, run to the dungeon,  fight his way through for 30-45mins, have his gear get trashed by getting hit (I'm a point that 10% is 1.4g repaircost) for 20g and maybe some crappy stuff that's dropping making an hour of effort worth 25g. 
---
25g for a geared tank? Nah, fam. Better level a hunter and do solo trib runs if people want to carry them for peanuts.
---
They do that because they can. Same with mages. As soon as they realise their cheap 3 button combo doesn't work they blink away real fast.
---
Hunter Vs Warlock - Which class is better specifically in terms of making money soloing dungeons and battlegrounds pvp?
---
&gt;I'm keeping this shit up until every alli quits the game on our realm. They are all absolute scum. zug zug 
---
Why are you rping in comments? Fucking weirdo.
---
You need to be level 20 for expert engineering.
---
Hmmm, I never have this problem in pagel. Idk why, I just walk right into MC.
---
Sounds like a salmon run and the bears have picked there spots on the river to feed.
---
Either Lobster Stew or the pre-made Roasted Quail/Alterac Swiss from dungeons (DM N and Strat UD in particular). 
---
Lobster Stew just because I had a million and a half lobsters after finishing 300 cooking. I sold like 5 stacks of it and still haven't run out yet.
---
The number of triggered, overly defensive horde in this thread is hilarious.
---
This is awesome.
---
Shouldve worded it better. Its imo “the best thing” rogues can do. Few of my guild mates and and some other rogues who im friends with all doing this and they got rank 4 pretty easily aswell as top 150 rank. Ofc you should just do whatever you want but from what ive seen/heard most top ranked rogues so far been doing this.
---
But they could also bring you as a resto and you could bring pretty much the same buffs. The enhance talents for improved weapons and buff totems add very little damage even to four warriors because it's a flat AP boost, so it's equivalent to something like 16-20 extra DPS for the raid if you're in a group with four warriors, ie. a less than 1%DPS increase. There's some evidence from some private servers (but not all, e.g. Nostalrius) and perhaps from TBC that the AP buff lingers for 1.5s, which makes it slightly stronger, ie. it will also apply to a special attack in that window. But to my knowledge no one has collected data on this in classic yet, and it would still not be something that scales dramatically. 
---
However, if you farm for all the consumables you can you don't bring terrible DPS - very comparable with a main spec not popping consumables, especially in current content. With AQ / Naxx much more of a scaling disparity opens up, and the gap can't be bridged with consumables because there aren't that many new ones added.
---
&gt; Why do so many items and abilities have the same icon? 
---
Because it's hard to create thousands of unique small pictograms, so Blizzard reused them here and there.
---
&gt; I really wish Blizz didn't break the Census addon 
---
I don't know the addon but I'm assuming it's a population addon that shows %'s of players?
---
If I am correct in thinking that, it's great that blizzard disables them. Right now the exodus of players is already happening, addons that allow you to see %'s on both sides will only enforce this problem further. You can just quickly make a character, notice the % being 45-55 and then going "oh, there are horde servers with even more then 55% players, so I'll go to one of those instead".
---
And then you would truly end up with 80/20 servers, or at the very least that would be my assumption.
---
i would think its kinda cool if you wouldnt have gone on a ganking tour. even a 60 cant do anything about getting ganked by 30 40´s.
---
Good thing you'll unsub in 15 days then. Bye loser.
---
At the beginning I thought pvp could ruin your armor too (don’t ask, I’m a newbie) 
---
So I would take off my clothes to run to a dungeon (wouldn’t be able to defend myself even with armor on) 
---
And let me tell you. Most people rather kill a fully geared warrior than a naked, female night elve 😂
---
I believe he works for Blizzard now. Well deserved. His trailers are fucking amazing.
---
Or you know you could just move to a pve server and not wish harm to someone who's just playing pvp on a pvp server.
---
Just wait, this mass of goobers that rolled horde is gonna wait in 30min queues just to get farmed by alliance premades.
---
Leatrix possibly?
---
I don't have to buy salt anymore, just come here and say "horde bad, they take it really personal.
---
No idea, i followed him for 2 weeks and there was just a constant stream of different fake drama
---
Best shitpost in a while, 9/10, could've used less punctuation
---
Yes, of course, because it's us going 120v1 right?
---
No, epidemic.
---
For what reason? It's hardly a desirable name either. I don't think I've ever seen a char called Cc.
---
Lol addons are a crutch. Crazy how my guild is doing so well for being an idiot.
---
Lol bgs are cross realm.
---
Adults can be just as whiney. I personally hate round robin, and from your story it seems like you weren't 100% aware of these types of rules. 
---
Talk things out with your GM/officers, but it sounds like there are some fundamental problems in how they are doing loot (or at least communicating it to you since it seema you are a tank).
---
I'm an officer and I dont have a lot of Drama with the about 150-200 who are in our guild.
---
I actually enjoy watching the YouTube clips of him sometimes. I think he’s pretty entertaining.
---
Stalagg is 12% alliance O.O
---
Toilet pasta
---
I don't know the respawn timer, but I normally ask around zone chat to find them. I have to use them for my Arcanum quest, so I had to find several until I had 8 Night Dragon's Breath. It's a little annoying, but if you get the zone to help you it can go faster.
---
Please.
---
ma man, thnks so much.
---
i was rly thinking it would something related to my alt level but rly couldnt find a answer anywhere.
---
thnks for the fast reply  m8
---
On Herod Horde.
---
&gt; I don't know the addon but I'm assuming it's a population addon that shows %'s of players playing certain classes or factions?
---
It showed the player count, broken down by faction, for each server.
---
Tanking is the most exhausting job in the group and if he needs no gear from strat anymore that’s more than fine in my opinion.
---
He’s essentially boosting the group through it and is taking the orbs as compensation. 
---
You’re not forced to group with him, I feel much worse about terrible tanks reserving literally anything that could be decent for melee and creating all caster groups that then in return have to roll against each other.
---
The orbs that would drop divided by 5 is the least of my problems.
---
AP juju is only for melee isn't it?
---
It’s only roughly 50-60 +healing in close to bis gear, which unless you are spamming only renews, you only make use of about about 65% of that through a fight. That can be made up for on healing just through pure luck of having a few casts get better efficiency. Imo, not worth a minimum requirement of 2 hours of farming just to afford the respect.
---
To each their own, I guess.
---
Horde do that on literally every single server except heartseeker.
---
Git gud /s
---
Haha love it. Horde do it too but we need to educate them. It's better to leav him free xp until 48 lmao
---
Probably an automation addon like Leatrix.
---
Though, honestly, that owuld be an option to disable immediately. Even without pvp, this could rezz you in terrible spots.
---
Hunter sinew in winterspring for my 2% attack speed increase on my quiver (lol) 35-40 hours total farming it so far.  I've basicly given up with the release of p2 but I'll go every now and then and put an hour in to keep the hope alive.  I also don't expect to get an azuregos kill anytime soon (100% drop rate here).  I'm not online enough to luckily be on when it spawns &amp; enough people on my guild are able to head over.  And then even then I'd have to win the roll vs other hunters
---
Lol too bad I’m not. Addons are a crutch. Addons don’t make someone a bad player.
---
Grizzly and other stalagg alliance guilds do plenty in wpvp scenarios, and that’s worth getting excited about occasionally. But 90% of the time alliance is getting killed on fp landing spots and popular thoroughfares like the run up to any instance without any way to fight back.
---
No one guild fixes that.
---
Interesting. I had just assumed they were the same since its only a very small difference. without looking at a blown up version you wouldn't even notice it.
---
Mr. good at math man. We saw Omnicast boots from golem 40 times in a row while farming Nagerling for a tank. We're convinced this is almost impossible and that someone at blizzard was trolling us (obviously not really, but how the fuck does the same exact item drop 40 times in a row).
---
Yeah no... anything to do with asmon i refuse to give a view.
---
Absolutely. I’ve rerolled like 6 times and on two different servers. I’d probably have two 60s by now if I had just stuck with those. I regret it a lot. I’m way behind all my friends but I’ll catch up eventually.
---
Not gonna lie this was funny as fuck
---
It toggles off automatically but you still need to wait 5 minutes.
---
Our tank (a prot warrior, obviously) goes to Arathi to farm the elementals there. He says with Phase 2 out it's been surprisingly empty for competition there, so that may be worth a shot. I don't know how much he makes per hour.
---
Throw on some music or some movies, it’s pretty easy money for a healer
---
Please tell me dynasty won. Good way to destroy your rep as a guild when you kick PUG like that and show you dont understand how loot rolls work. Kinda something you learn while in dungeons.
---
My friend, wait.Dont reroll just yet!
---
Remember, remember the 10th of december.
---
wPvP will die down, and i mean, WILL die down. (atleast from the degree that it currently is, we will still see the BRM camp and gank, but thats only cuzz all raid content is there). 
---
wPvP will always b there but to a much less degree.
---
That one
---
I've never had issues with the AV map as horde in the earlier version or the revised
---
Game released in late November. Honor came in early April. BGs came in early june.  
---
5 to 6 months, if we're generous (because the 23rd to the 6th isn't a month).  
---
Classic came late August, honor came mid november, bgs are coming early december.  
---
3 to 4 months.  
---
Faster, but not 9 months.  
---
Then consider Europe, where the game came out in February. For us, things are actually coming later than in 2005, where we had Honor 2 months in, BGs 3 months in.
---
Yeah I should play a game that isn't full of whiney, carebear, bitches. Do you know of any?
---
Honestly I have no clue.
---
Depends a bit. If horde uses the jump to avoid the bridge then horde is favored. 
---
[Video of jump done on the classic demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pRkN0vFCmE)
---
I see what you did there.
---
Yeah, same here.  Now my friends have lost interest and went to other games and here I am, bad at pvp and stuck on a pvp server lol
---
This is literally horde on Zandalar Tribe EU. Alliance dominated the whole world despite the server being pretty even in terms of numbers (53-47 in ally favour).
---
Asmongold's stream is really strange sometimes, Like you click on it to watch something for 10 min and before you know it, you have been watching for 2 hours. I can't explain it.
---
This but unironically. If you're someone that things Spy is unfair, then how the hell do you explain ClassicCastbars, Big Debuffs, DBM, auto-dismount, etc... Almost every add-on in the game gives you an advantage over people who do not have the add-on.
---
They don't have to be beautiful to be cool! My two characters are both trolls. They have a great dance and I like their voice. The rogue also performs a roundabout kick sometimes when I interrupt. They're also the tallest race (when they stand up straight).
---
If you want to look for troll sounds, Warcraft3 should have some too!
---
Enjoy your time away from the game and come back whenever. And stay away from da voodoo!
---
Could you advise me what to do when I bring a group of 10 and there are 200-300 raid geared level 60 horde corpse camping from the flight path to the instance entrance? 
---
I'm really frustrated but if there is a way around it that you know of, please share your strategy. I can't think of one
---
It wasn’t a guildie it was a shit addon
---
&gt;ake a direct comparison between Questi
---
trying to make a comparison between granny smith and red delicious isn't going to work, ones a green apple, ones a red apple.  thank u, next
---
As a lvl 56 holy pally can i do any instances other then brd?
---
Good for you, I never did cooking or first aid. Finally max leveled them after 14 years
---
Don't let shamans transfer, not a big deal if they picked a class they knew was faction specific as they knew there would never be a chance to faction switch.
---
676 is not THAT rare.
---
From what I remember didn't Blizz put a Name Lock into place?
---
Are you trying to create that character Name on a different Account?
---
You know of free character restoration. When you delete it accidentally or get hacked. You can restore your character.
---
People used to abuse this to get a free Name Change.
---
Delte main character - create new one with old "Mains" Name - restore their main.
---
This way they used to get a free Name Change.
---
I'm quite certain Blizz put something in place to avoid that. You probably have the Name locked to your account or the Name is locked in General for like 2 weeks (I think that is the time you have until you can't restore the character anymore)
---
I understand the reason that it's done, but I can certainly blame people for doing it just like they can remove themselves from blame because "Blizzard implemented the system and didn't say not to".  
---
Your example is a nice one, but let's go the other way and talk UnGoro.  I landed and died in about 3 seconds, then have a 4-5 minute walk back to my body, die upon rezzing, another 4-5 minute walk back, die again, etc.  This happened for over 30 minutes before I spirit rezzed and ran to Gadgetzan to go to another zone.  It's also hilarious that you think people will stop killing players when the honor stops, as that has not been my experience.
---
I think BGs coming sooner will help a ton with all of this, but I just am trying to say world PvP doesn't have to be people camping FPs, you can roam and get plenty of honor that way.
---
Is there much action in silithus right now? I suppose maybe people are farming elementals, but I'd guess it's one of the least populated zones at your level.
---
I'm only 39 and haven't even been through tanaris yet, so I'm just guessing about silithus.
---
Good luck out there.
---
\#BanAllAddons
---
\#wowhardmode
---
\#NoAddons
---
bring it on
---
I see you never encountered a rogue gank squad.
---
Sure they don't. But the healer could say something before he rolls when someone tells him its an upgrade. Especially guildies.
---
Top fucking kek.
---
For pure farming it Depends 100% on your skill. If you want to increase further gold making it also factors how good of a salesman you are and server econ. Potentionally you could sell some lucrative items like the arena chest (hunter) for I don't know how much (never seen anyone do this because it's a crazy idea that I just got). Also you could sell the Tribute loot, HoJ, Satyr's Bow.
---
If you wan't consistent, less RNG dependent then Mage is a really good option.
---
Omg, same
---
So if a guild decides to transfer, they'd have to leave a part of their roster behind and recruit a bunch of paladins on the other side. There's no way Blizzard would let that happen.
---
I enjoy pvp, but not this nonsense that people are calling pvp. This is just winning through sheer numbers with so many people sweating it to make rank. Maybe rerolling on a pve sever is a good alternative since we have a definitive answer for when BGs come out. That way i can still get stuff done in the world and participate in PvP and get a closer than what this currently is classic experience.
---
To be fair, you need a very high IQ to roll a Mage 😎
---
Looks pretty cool.  I see someone on curse asked if you could right click to dismiss a buff in combat and it seems like you can so thats really neat.  Is it able to sort buffs by time?  I really want my buffs ordered by time left and the default blizz either doesn't do it, or when I zone it does it in reverse order of what I would want.
---
I would assume so, I had tribute and ony and it appeared correct in the character sheet. 
---
I'm thinking it was visual display only.
---
I don't watch him on twitch, just on youtube occasionally. He's just stupid and funny. He obviously says things to trigger people, and when people actually get mad about it, it's even more funny. People that don't know he's putting on a show are the real fools.
---
This is gonna depend on the boss fight. Like for Garr I would do a mage since warlocks have to focus on banishes.  But on other flights where mages have to decurse I would get a warlock.  Whatever your choice though make sure you coordinate with them so that they don't blow all their cool Downs prior to the PI.
---
retail is fucked beyond rescue since cata, I just want to play classic forever
---
we all know where the road is heading (loooooong time of naxx raiding ((not that I have a problem with that))) so why not take our time and enjoy each phase? imho dm should be released around now, honor around christmas and bgs not before summer bwl somewhere late '20
---
The leveling experience past lvl 55 is quite bad. I suggest you to run BRD Arena/Anger xp runs. Its smooth and really fast xp. Theres are some pre-raid BiS in BRD too. Once you hit lvl 58, you can start looking for Strat Live/UD groups to 60.
---
I am impressed you got your 100g back, giving him the 100g was just dumb in the first place.
---
He also said a blue PvP set is what he's willing to farm. A blue PvP set on an elemental shaman will still compete against Naxx classes simply because of the toolkit in a shaman.
---
Thanks for liking my low quality shitpost I give you a whole reddit point
---
I mean I understand that rogues share gear with the other melee dps specs but the one thing none of them should ever really be rolling on are daggers. It’s like half the reason I switched to a dagger spec, so I would have less competition on the rolls.
---
Just because you don’t know anything about twinks doesn’t mean they don’t exist. 39 warlocks, rogues and druids are extremely popular. 
---
While you may think one shotting everyone is  fun (which you won’t do anyway because everyone and their mom will be making 29 twinks, especially rogues and hunters) some people actually enjoy the competitive aspect of PvP.
---
Suppose I was unclear, I'm referring to mods that make exclusion easier. DBM, spy, and even weakauras are about improving your gameplay rather than creating a means of excluding.
---
Explained it more in a different post, but some mods have the mans of creating an experience akin to 'entry lvl job requires 5 years experience'.
---
Two warriors in MokGora, someone was supposed to cheat, but how as a warrior?
---
"***Addons are a crutch***.", Says terrible WoW player, defending themselves from not being a terrible WoW player.
---
Farming Elementals is not super crazy good g/h, but it is decent. All of them are immune to a specific damage type, but as a Warrior you couldn't care less.
---
If you're the kind of person to go out questing for long periods of time, consider investing in bigger bags. Everything you have to delete since your bags are full is lost money.
---
That doesn't work until you've been in the friendly zone for at least 5 minutes. Hence why they are camping the FP/Portals to exploit it.
---
No GM’s are all evil bastards that never side with the righteous (me). 
---
Anyways this doesn’t seem like it’d be an issue at all. The other player is now geared so all the loot will go to OP, assuming the raid stays together. I would still talk to the gm about it because if he allowed a roll, he should get the loot. You can’t decide after rolls what happens.
---
Free Hong Kong
---
This guyblubes his anus, listen to jim.
---
That shit is exactly why I despise Rogues. The ability to permanently lock down another player is ludicrous and never should have existed in the first place. I will always be convinced Rogues were designed by someone who was really bad at PVP and wanted something they could easily win with.
---
Are you seriously crying right now? Lol.
---
Here's how all this complaining looks: https://youtu.be/YersIyzsOpc?t=17
---
Nothin to really say other than... suck it up, buttercup! You wanted the classic experience, you got it! #nochanges, remember?
---
My constant browsing of the 'new' has finally paid off!
---
That is also something that not enough people do imho:
---
If you are a Warrior, grab yourself a Paladin friend and farm yourself some Strat!
---
What is that, 15 minutes a day? Or do you spend all your time doing non xp gaining activities
---
This place is such a salt mine.
---
The spy addon gives an unequal advantage that disadvantages a class' kit. The spy addon makes PvP ambushes significantly more difficult to pull off.
---
It's false equivalency, they aren't changing gameplay in the same way. And they're not changing gameplay in a way viewed as negative.
---
I thought you said unfounded though.
---
If the rest of your group is level 60 and experienced, you could feasibly run pretty much all of them. The healer is the one party member that can afford to be a little underlevel.
---
Except they haven't banned ClassicLFG addon?
---
This is what I see happening aswell. 
---
5 Man premades with all of their hearthstones at the BG entry point (Not sure if this version of classic is going to have the ones in the cities or only at the outposts).
---
One person starts the queue, the rest is just fucking around camping places untill nr5 rejoins them.  
---
30 Min later their queue pops, they dissapear. If people are lucky they are the only horde group camping the area (At that time) and get a \~20-30 minute window to do some things, after which the BG ends and said group inmediatly gets placed outside again, with an area that has probably repopulated slightly, people may have just started doing things again and then it gets ruined again.
---
Yes, the game loop is going to be fun.
---
thats more like not playing at all lol
---
Thanks I’ll check it out
---
Sadly this will go right over most people’s heads
---
No one is forcing guilds to transfer in this scenario. Blizzard is partly to blame for the faction imbalance on some servers as they allowed open transfers for both factions, making the imbalance even worse. If paid transfers do become a thing, they should make a free option on servers where the imbalance is massive and only the dominating faction can change to the minority faction.
---
The announcement said "The week of Dec 10th". Let's not make the same mistake as with Phase 2.
---
Terrible WoW player defends terribleness by stating his guild is doing well, more terrible WoW player moments like these brought to you by ***Rozencrantze***.
---
wow that's cool
---
&gt; Making a functional FD trap macro is impossible  
---
Let's just leave this here and wait until 2004 comes around again and we can finally trap and die

Don't give up, skeleton
---
Same! I'm intrigued.
---
I would say he's semi casual. I have a level 56 druid and I play 1 hour a day on the weekdays and 3+ hours on the weekends at night. It's all about efficiency when you play, min max your play time so by 2020 you can be level 60.
---
As prot warriors our options are relatively limited is part of the problem.
---
If you just ignore how op ally is at pve then sure anything is comparatively easier
---
I am sorry for you being bad at world of warcraft classic.
---
Anyway for a person to opt out of this?  
---
If people want to upload their characters, that's well and fine, but uploading the stats of other players is very intrusive and I for one do not want that.  
---
Good job on the project, though, looks really well done.
---
You just said insta killing?
---
Prices wont plummet, at least i dont think, the people who did it have an expectation for how much their items are worth.
---
Prices will probably stagnate and slowly drop until the weak hands get bought out and supply slowly dries out.
---
Well, I'm in raid group 2 in apes, we have it abit more chill.
---
But isnt this point moot, because as soon as you dont have a specific weapon skill by race, the #1 priority for your play time is to get edgemasters. Your next 400g you farm are directly going to your edgemasters fund. 
---
Yes, on paper daggers due to their 58DPS might be highest, but you will get edgemasters before your epic mount, before your lionheart if you are a raiding as non-orc/human. 
---
The second you can buy them, you do.
---
Because there is absolutely no way to camp a long thin bridge with 0 cover or objects on it.
---
That bridge by itself is literally the biggest problem about entering the south side if there is even a small force of opposition.
---
I'm on mankrik , thorium veins rarely last a minute in Un'goro ,I suspect that blasted lands is also farmed to death
---
Well at the moment the game is not very enjoyable for about 40% of the players
---
faps are already over 1g/piece on my server. How much more profit do you want :D
---
It will rise up and down in waves for the next few weeks. As with every consumeable: try selling on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
---
Loot drama is the number #1 destroyer of guilds.
---
You say that loot council / round robin would be fine with you.  It sounds like your leadership is using some form rolls with loot council having the ability to override.  If you are fine with that system, and the real problem is one person whining.
---
You can block individual people so you don't have to listen to them beg you not to roll.  That's what I'd do in your situation.  Block the person diminishing your enjoyment.
---
If your leadership isn't actually doing a good job of keeping track of who gets what loot, and who's "turn" it is, then you may want to find another guild.  There is MASSIVE benefit to being in a guild with people you want to play with (like IRL friends), so don't leave over one bad instance of loot distribution if you are otherwise okay with how it's handled.  Also, if you need some loot and are "allowed" to roll on it, it's always okay to do so.  Ya some people will hope you don't, but if it's an upgrade, it's an upgrade.  (If you know it's a much bigger upgrade for someone else, it's NICE to let them have it, but you aren't required or expected to.)
---
&gt;it just looks so embarrassingly pathetic that I actually cringe and don't want to be seen as part of it.
---
Seriously, imagine having such a soft ego that you feel the need to /spit on someone who was 1v5'ed
---
What discounts do you get for not being able to play the game when you're dead/camped everywhere on the map? Does my character get free stuff because I lost play time that the other faction didn't?
---
I rather stay in queue for 1 hour than corpse run to a dungeon for that time.
---
My guild is about half pre-bis raiders. When the leader suggested we check if the world boss was up we just laughed at him.
---
How can you live vicariously through that which hath no life ?
---
I had a teacher in high school that used to use that one. It really bothers me, because unlike rocket surgery, brain science is actually a thing, so the point of the joke is defeated.
---
My mentality with this is as follows:
---
1. Group / Raid --  HMU free waters
---
2. in semi organized PvP, if you're flagged --- HMU free waters
---
3. When I come back from AFK in IF, and you've HMU 3 times.... --- /wave
---
4. If you're original with your tell, or offer to tip... --- HMU
---
5. Canned BS tell that you've clearly sent every other mage in town ---  /wave  probably but not 100%
---
This is exact reason i camp people 30 levels below me. To incite a reaction just like this one
---
What the fuck is this bullshit?
---
Stop.
---
lol are ppl saying 85/15 now? few days itll be 90/10 then 95/5 then 99/1. all said with a straight face.
---
That's Horde waiting in queues when bgs launch
---
Evanheluim
---
Good
---
I went from axe of deep woods / flurry to OEB and do noticeably better with OEB, even on single target. It has the potential to do some seriously insane dps on all the cleave fights, and still performed well on single target.
---
Rag weapons would be nicer, but they’re each only like a 5% drop chance so better safe than sorry if you can get OEB on the cheap imo
---
nice! congrats :)
---
Any way to combine them into one button?  Would...
---
/cast Berserker Stance
---
/cast Intercept
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
...work?
---
Because they thought the did, but they didn't.
---
It's no different than watching any other form of entertainment with your eyes. Different people enjoy different things.
---
Right?
---
Only thing I can imagine is they don't actually know how to tank AT ALL and just want loot priority, and because the tanking team is good enough to make it look easy, they think it's trivial.
---
Raid tanking **is** almost trivial if you have a good tank team **and** everyone on that team understands why the team works.  If you don't all understand why the team works, it's only easy.  If the people don't understand why it works, and can't follow instructions/are bad, it can be difficult.  Bad tanks are the hardest thing in the game to make up for.
---
Oh, sorry - it's the opposite. Only dwarfs\gnomes could ride mechanostriger.  
---
My mistake.
---
You think coal is expensive? Just wait until you get to Thorium...
---
In Dreams are absolut scumbags. Their Hand of Ragnaros dude ganked me (lvl 52 then) and corpse camped me for like 30min. Trash people.
---
Whats the correct wsg strategy in Vanilla? I was a mere noob back then and never made 60 on a pserver. 
---
I'd assume it's something like 2-3 preferably stealthed defenders, 5-6 in the middle and 2-3 trying to cap flag. Is this true or is there some other method.
---
&gt; It was never the focus of the game and PvP servers were clearly meant as alternate ruleset servers. 
---
Absolutely not and that wasn't the premise of your original post. 
---
&gt; "PvP servers" were an additional ruleset thrown in as an afterthought because some people requested it. 
---
I merely provided the fact that PvP was something that had been in development since early stages of WoW. It wasn't something that was made on a whim because a selected few liked it and wanted it in last second. 
---
The game very, very obviously was (and is) PvE focused. The fact that honor kills and ranks didn't exist until after the launch speaks as much. 
---
They really only started facilitating for PvP when Battlegrounds were released. Honor and honor ranks were merely the incentive to have players actively engage with each other for meaningful rewards.
---
Hey, can you tell the Alliance on Grobbulus that Alliance don't camp? Thanks!
---
Unfair advantage between multiple people using it. Questie helps everyone equally, Spy does not. Further, the "negative impact on gameplay" is really the biggest issue.
---
Your argument is full of shit mate.
---
I, too, poop.
---
How is reporting someone for griefing worse than reporting someone for doing something they're supposed to be reported for? Please explain, I can't follow your mental gymnastics.
---
Fair enough. I've been on servers like that, it's not fun.
---
Wow leveling a profession costs money, who knew. 
---
Btw you chose a terrible time to start leveling blacksmithing, since the same mats are used for engineering which as you might imagine is very popular right now.
---
Elemental Shaman DOES deal damage, ALOT of it in fact. The issue with elemental shamans in raiding is mana management. They simply OOM as fast as a boomkin.
---
Honestly, I'm after it just because it's cool as fuck and my guild asked some Warriors to go with 2H weapons since getting 1H weapons for everyone was going to take ages. We've got MC on farm anyway so DPS is not an issue.
---
Blizzard specifically excluded the armory system. In the past, when people have made addons to imitate features that were specifically excluded, blizzard changes part of the API to disable them.
---
Blizzard did this with several addons that imitated LFG functions. LFG addons are more like fancy chat monitors these days rather than group builders.
---
Farm gold and buy good BoEs. That's how you spoil an alt.
---
You can also ask friends and guildies to boost you.
---
But no way to run two characters on one account at the same time.
---
Another horde cringetage already? I'm full on these.
---
I caught it on the front fuckin page ayyyeee
---
K thanks
---
Are you even reading what Im writing?
---
I NEVER said that you don't need edgemasters. Ofc you will buy edgemasters and WITH those gloves daggers will be your best option.
---
tbh they could just release BGs now and not release a next phase for 10 years for all i care lol.
---
Benediction has entered the chat about 55/45 Alliance&gt;Horde. I play on horde and PVP has been good though I think horde organize better.
---
Crescent Staff (the WC quest chain reward), worth it for a lvl 18 warrior? The stats don't really help but the DPS is really good actually. Right now I'm using the Axe of Orgrimmar. The staff has 20.34 DPS, while the axe only has 11.82 DPS.
---
You definitely can and should run LBRS.  
---
Also you could run UBRS without much issues.
---
K
---
Heh.
---
Alliance have to advantage of much faster queues making it a lot easier to queue check for pug games.
---
[G](https://Wowhead.com)o to wowhead, type in the type of spider silk you need and it will show you every mob that drops it, and what their drop rate is. Be wary of any drop rates that seem ridiculously high, or have low numbers of kills, but in general it's pretty accurate.
---
Also, if you have a lvl 55+ find groups for LBRS and specifically those who are killing the spider boss. The spiders in that area drop all the different spider silks in good quantities.  For that matter, check the AH, that's your best bet.
---
Alliance is going to have almost instant queues. All the horde will be crying on Reddit about their 30-45min BG queues. 
---
I know BGs are crossrealm but if you check the server population most of the servers are heavily skewed towards Horde.
---
It probably won't change as much as people hope. Most of the complaints I've seen involve the amount of times you die running to a dungeon and it's not like people will stop running dungeons once BG's are released. Whichever faction is dominant on your server will still likely be camping the entrance of most dungeons while looking for a group.
---
&gt; The only solution is faction balance.
---
I agree but they don't have any easy solutions now. Their best option is faction based queues which is going to make a lot of Horde players upset and quit. So either way they're going to be losing money trying to balance factions now.
---
My point was just that this sub was never really amazing and "meaningful" discussion always the exception.
---
For every "explain the discrepency between Vanilla and Classic damage" there was 100 memes picture "should I pick dwarf or human#36" discussion and "layers, a 78 page essay"  post.
---
Then I'm really curious: what would you like to discuss? because personally, if I were to submit a post, I really wouldn't know what to discuss if I can't talk about what I would do to fix some problem or share my personal experience (and it wouldn't be that much interesting as everybody do the same)
---
It’s the cliché, but it seems that people think Mages and Warriors are the real idiots this go-around
---
No
---
I´ve been using that spot for almost 3 weeks, everytime I have to go near either SW or any other zone near it, so far with great luck and easy profit.
---
\*Experience may vary. Batteries not included.
---
What's wrong with the speed?
---
You are not missing any content, so why this pace is bad?
---
It's not extreme ESP. It doesn't tell you where anyone is. Just that they're in range. It doesn't tell you a rouge is stealthed. It only tells that the did stealth while in range. It's powerful but not extreme ESP.
---
The biggest PRO to being a DPS sham is you will be the only one in the raid lol 
---
I am Enhancement in about half raid BiS gear and I am usually around middle of the pack in raid DPS, but relative to other shaman, I do decent
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/benediction/shampion
---
My logs from the last few MC runs as Enhancement 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/rPMRpQmcgFXq69Lk/
---
Me compared to everyone else in the raid
---
I die on Ragnaros and Majordomo almost every time from pulling threat. I'll get a crazy WF proc and then just drop. As mentioned previously, we are there for Fire Resistance Totem and Wind Fury, our DPS is not holding anyone back, but you'll never be carry DPS
---
You have to be smart with your mana, hell, you can dump all your mana in 10 seconds if you wanted to as an enhancement. You will only Frostshock and Auto attack as well as place totems. 
---
Also, there is hardly any loot in MC for Enhancement. Maybe 3 or 4 pieces? You will also never get tier gear (except 2.5 or OS)
---
That is the most common one is a a horse orc from alliance. The ok boomer shit is probably the most annoying because it’s not even a insult but the people spamming think its is, act like an adult and use real insults not this shit that sounds like something an11 year old uses on fornite.
---
Okay, I agree with you, was just letting you know that the people camping FP’s are dicks, they’re not doing it because they’re honor starved.
---
I raid as Elemental. My dps is more then fine with around 400-500 on most bosses ( but I got a bit lucky with stuff like ring of spellpower ) 
---
The mana is very exagarrated! With just a major mana pot you can mostly go trough a whole fight , might have to spam some r1 LB to fish for procs but most fights are short enough that you don’t to. Having runes is a big bonus wich makes you last with mana until the end of fights.
---
For me personally I would say go for it! At the start it took people a bit of convincing but you can really make a name of yourself if you do things correctly!
---
Because secretly I wish to have no life
---
I just killed the dog after seeeing it was fixed. He's pretty low hp compared. kite around the lake as usual. Keep cheeta up and rank 1 arcane if your worried about dropping aggro. You can do it without getting hit by any spells if you're far enough. I continued to kite even when 0 ap debuff was out.
---
There are actually 15 different realms(10 US and 5 EU) in which Alli have a 60+% share of raiding 60's.
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers
---
Nope. 
---
Intercept trigger Global cooldown and you can't macro after GCD.
---
Just sounds like a lot of excuses for shitty behavior to me.  
---
I see plenty of 3-5man groups roaming and gaining honor, I see plenty of premades rolling towns/zones/harbors and gaining honor.  I see raid groups invading capital cities and (attempting) kills on faction leaders too.  These are all things that I don't have a problem with, even as someone leveling as I can rez and usually sneak away after a death or two, but camping FPs is substantially harder to get away which is why people are doing it.  You can defend it as working as intended or whatever reasoning you'd like, but it's just plain low effort ganking catering to lazy af players who aren't even good enough to kill lowbies questing or leveling.  
---
And you know what?  You're right, me complaining about it isn't going to change anything which is why I just leave the zones usually and go somewhere else.  You defending the behavior just shows that you have no issue taking advantage of a system you admit is broken, so hope you enjoy those PvP items a week or two earlier than you would've not camping FPs.  It'll definitely be worth it in the long run!
---
nice
---
I asked something as a beginner on the forums and i got an answer within 2 hours with multiple followups from the customer service people. That was the French one though, so maybe it depends where you are ? There are most likely less people asking for help in here, but that's quite a big difference, 2 hrs vs 2 days+
---
More like 4 girls 1 guy. I’ll never understand this obsession with grown men playing female characters. Women used to get raped on the battlefield. Now they depict them as heroes and it’s trendy to include them in everything, even video games. So ignorant of history and reality lmfao.
---
Not sure if that would work. But what you could do is have them stand still at the cave exit - that's not close enough to trigger cleaner, and skeletons will still aggro to him and kill themselves on thorns. Just make sure he doesn't do anything, no heals and stuff (I *think* you can heal him, but not 100% sure).
---
This is the same subreddit that advocated the complete removal of all addons prior to the game's launch btw. The inner workings of top internet minds is beyond mysterious sometimes.
---
Looks like you should have considered paying that much for it, then
---
You will go insane after 1 level
---
Not really, gambler's fallacy is when you lose 9/10 coin tosses and then claim you are "due" on the 10th, or the next roll has better than 50% chance to roll heads because you just rolled 9 strait tails.
---
This guy is just an arrogant moron.
---
Westfall is also a PVE server, if you flag up running to a dungeon you have no one to blame but yourself
---
That add-on will always cast zerker first. So it's not possible to have what you want as you wrote it.
---
I don't know if castsequence macros work in Classic. But they can do what you want.
---
If castsequence works, the following will be the macro to use:
---
&gt;castsequence: Berserker Stance, Intercept, Defensive Stance
---
They really think crossrealm will make it tolerable, ignoring that PvP servers are the most common and Horde have huge numbers on all of them.
---
Pagle isn't making up for Stalagg, Herod, Skeram, Whitemane...
---
Yes there are necessary, since you make claim without any evidence to back this up.
---
It's not because you have a theory which can be possible that it's true. It's a realm of possibility without Intel on how blizzard operate. 
---
Opinion doesn't equals fact. This concept this confusing for 90% of this sub reddit
---
I enjoy his stream because his obnoxiousness seems pretty tongue and cheek tbh. He’ll do things like bitch about Paladins 24/7 and then spend 2 hours trying to get 3 paladins for his raid because no one on his server wants to be a Paladin, which is hilarious to me.
---
It’s also pretty funny when he starts really acting like a dick and McConnell starts giving him a bunch of shit.
---
Streams are entertainment, and his is pretty entertaining imo
---
I hate that DBM wont track the kills for the Dark Iron Arena. The stats show the names of the bosses but they dont register. I know i have done the arena more times than i would care to count but i have seen Garrosh 27 times now and I have vendored every piece and have a set in the bank. Garrosh is a withholding orc.
---
Have you personally used the website? Could you give a short description of how effective you have found it to be for your server?
---
Why do you care that they comment here?
---
Little column A little column B
---
My main is a hunter on grobb Horde and it has been a really weird experience. I actually used to get whispers pretty often asking me to come to dungeons which is the opposite of what I expected.
---
But yeah I made a ton of money farming on my hunter and rerolled fury warrior with all of the fancy BoEs and am trying to switch over to maining him.
---
Re-roll a different class because warrior is the most played one and you’ll be fighting against 8 other warriors in every raid for gear. I can’t even get into guild that raid because of the over flow on my servers. You gotta find a new guild in order to actually be a tank for raids or start your own.
---
That's my plan. Or taking forever to die if its just one or two killing me. As a holy priest I can stay up for a long time if they're not good. Every minute of their time I waste is 1 win.
---
Yes, as funny as it looks, it's actually the best warrior weapon for a while. Possibly until corpsemaker.
---
1 À € 1 1 Ä 2 ‡
---
You don't understand why people gamble?
---
Stone form, escape artist, perception, entire Paladin class. Plus the best priest race In the game. 
---
Seriously pick your poison.
---
Alright since it seems like you have some reading comprehension problems I'm gonna help you out and repost what I said in the other thread
---
I didn't know I had it. Must've come with another addon or something. With that being said, I just gained an advantage by it telling me an enemy was casting fear. I don't want this advantage and it has no place in classic.
---
Try to tell me that classiccastbars isn't useful in pvp pls
---
From him? I died. We were deeeeep in that big ol’ cavey area in Searing Gorge.
---
From the game? I did. I actually took a couple breaks, took a shower and ate dinner, but he never let his guard down.
---
Post this to /r/FaerlinaPvP instead. Most of the classic community won’t care, but the server will. Also contact &lt;Legend&gt; GM, his name is Fury.
---
And spells get knocked back through ice barrier all the time...
---
Depends what you like. Mankrik and Pagle are biggest Eastern normal servers. Mankrik is horde dominated and Pagle is alliance dominated
---
Hunters beat warlocks because of the DM tribute solo runs.
---
I'd say warlocks are much better at PvP though.
---
You've never blown $200 at a casino before?
---
Avoid using DS/Ruin or SM/Ruin for leveling. Both are meant as end-game raid specs and perform pretty poorly in a leveling environment.
---
This [drain tank](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35002405122010051-20400531005) spec is quite popular and should hold you over until you're level 60.
---
Pretty straight forward, dot up a mob, alternate between drain life and dark pact to keep your health and mana high. Use the succubus as your main pet. Don't bother teaching it soothing kiss, that ability is completely useless.
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the hunter. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical taming most of the jokes will go over a typical player's head. There's also Broken Tooth's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from orcish literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about WOW. As a consequence people who dislike hunters truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Broken Tooth's existential catchphrase "rowr," which itself is a cryptic reference to Rexxar's half-orcish epic Traps for Dummies. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as XlegolasX's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
---
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rhok'delar tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the NE ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 levels of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
---
Maybe you could crawl warcraftlogs?
---
Has nothing to do with greed.  If there's a pattern for a highly sought after item that has only been seen twice in 2 months on a high pop server, that pattern has serious value.  How do you recoup the value of a 5k+ gold pattern?  Charging for the craft.  Do you farm essences to just give them away?  Do you pick herbs and just trade them to randoms in your capitol city?  There's an opportunity cost for crafting an item for hundreds of players as well.  Time you could spent farming is instead waiting to meet up with hundreds of players to craft. 
---
You see a high gold amount and shout "GREED!" without thinking of everything else that goes into it.  Creating mafias and striking deals to keep prices high might be considered scummy, but if you're literally the only person able to craft it for over a month you're wasting time and gold not charging a premium for it.
---
I've had this in my head too, rofl.
---
I feel your pain, I am currently an Ele shaman but am going to respec to resto(was my plan at 60 anyways) and dungeon grind the rest of it. Last night i was met by a lovely lvl56 rouge who seemed to think I gave infinite honor no matter how many times he killed me.
---
Damn, can you give me your secrets?
---
This assumes they add TBC and Wrath at all.
---
Another good day!  
---
Luckily I'm years away from the blackest, I outgrew it all. I have however this idea that there's always been something to save me, and I piled those all over the years. In time, the statement "I woke up alive today aswell" I wore and carried as a bleak joke became one of my happiest catchphrases. 
---
So let me thank you today too, because  I woke up alive today aswell, and today is easier thanks to you too.
---
Lmfao holy shit I actually walked by you the other day while you were taking this screen shot and said to myself " can't actually be one dude"
---
cut to: getting insta-ganked by one or two rogues as soon as you hearth to IF...
---
Sounds like a salty alliance player to me
---
I had a main on Magtheridon (Alliance side) and remember it happening too, but nowhere near the extent it does now nor for the length it does now.  Even before P2 I had it happen to me in Gadgetzan but I wasn't being camped for over 30 minutes, nor do I ever remember that happening before either.  You don't even get honor past what, 4 kills?  So the excuse of "we're just maximizing our honor through a broken system" doesn't hold up, they're just being shitters.
---
ctprofiles says hello from 2005
---
Umm. Sir - please stop submitting photoshopped imagery displaying the A(ngel)lliance as the bad guy. Only the horde attack others when they are disadvantaged. Everyone in the A(ngel)lliance faction is extremely honorable^(tm).
---
Shaman and warrior both heavily buff rogue dps. (battle shout, sunder, wf, strength totem).
---
Druid benefits from bs, contributes lotp, but cant take advantage of wf (although both a druid and warrior benefit from agi totem).
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I’ll look into them. I need to streamline my corpse walking experience lol
---
That was my exact experience in vanilla. I did not let it repeat this time around. I talked them into following me, and now of course they are actually still playing. I don't understand it, but I'm glad.
---
Yea the priest is obviously braindead. He said he was fucking ambien.  Like just what I want in my guild, some dude zonked out on fucking ambien without a fucking clue in the world what hes rolling on. Sure that will go over great in raids.
---
I think it's just that we have better means of communicating and we're a very outraged people in this day and age.  I remember being ganked mercilessly over and over back in the day and it was just known to be part of the game.
---
&gt;Are you seriously crying right now? Lol.
---
You could have just said "Yes" and saved yourself some typing.
---
Lmao forgot just putting on ice armor wins against melle
---
How? Taking away the entire combat log?
---
No actually it was alliance Ad Nauseam that had the first pull
---
Guild leader of mine never even got a message. Back then they used to at least show you that your ticket is pending. You cant even see this.
---
So its only gonna het worse. Guess im not resubbing
---
I mean, I do that as ally.
---
Noob.
---
Hell yeah comrade!
---
It was never amazing but it was a cozy place with moderate amount of everything, say, 10 months ago.
---
I would like to discuss trivial stuff, like spells to skip while leveling, RP items and recipes, 1v1 PvP tactics and tricks, how to be successful at your profession, bugs that people notice (the game is really buggy). I would also want to read people's personal experience with the game, like that guy who was in the streamer's raid when he ninja'd Staff of Dominance. But making over 9k posts with haha look how I'm gangbanged, haha why my screen grey is a low effort post.
---
I would also appreciate videos with someone doing something clever or funny, like that guy who was sapping people on the way to the elevator in Thosand Needles, prompting them to fall to their death, instead of looking at low quality screenshots with x person casting y spell. Memes and shitposts aren't bad when they're in moderation.
---
Lol, how is he "impersonating"" his audience? Could you please give some examples instead of an irelrvant two page essay which for some reason contains a really bad history of toxic lol streamers. Cuz all the toxic lol streamers like Iwilldominate and TF Blade are dead, right? (I suppose the 8k+ viewers for TF are all bots or something lol.
---
You're just a different market and that's fine. Some of us really enjoy the pvp, either for pure competitive skill, lore reasons of really feeling like you're in a faction war, the added engagement and danger it adds to the world, or all three. You do your thing on the pve servers, we'll do our thing on ours
---
In order for there to be more in the open world, there would need to be alliance players in the open world, and seeing the current exodus, unless a lot of people return I dont see that happening
---
There are some misconceptions and flat rubbish being thrown around here. This thread is the reason I don't do customer support. 
---
* Retail still batches. 20ms, not 200ms. Batching is a common solution to this kind of problem. At a push you could call eventual consistency the evolution to batching. 
---
* Bandwidth does not change the fundamental laws of nature that affect latency. It does, however, change bottleneck times. However, beyond the amount of messages queued, this does not change the behavior of the mechanic. 
---
* Ye olden hardware required the main server loop to process server ticks, player messages and spell batches synchronously (one after the other) in a single routine. The new engine almost definitely does not. I don't think anybody with large pop count does anymore.
---
[Blizzard already spoke about the batching mechanic](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/spell-batching-in-classic/137118) which reveals some interesting tidbits.
---
Specifically note this part:
---
&gt;It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
That implies Blizzard (correctly) opted to not go back to a single threaded model. 
---
TL;DR
---
Spellbatching is not the problem. Processing spellbatching **outside** of regular server ticks is. Original Classic used to that, the new engine does not. No, going back to a single routine for **all** client traffic is not a great fix. Some work is required from the devs to bring player state and spell processing closer to how they were done in a single routine. Can be done, will be some effort though
---
Im on a 30/70 horde dominated server. They wont pick a fight with you unless its 3v1 in their favor and when they do, they'll taunt and emote on you as if somehow they've achieved the impossible?
---
I warrior charged a mage once, just to have a rogue cheap shot me and /chicken me WHILE I'M STUNNED like oh???
---
Dude, you can't compare the stealth alarm that spy provides to racial detection or game sound lol.
---
Spy alerts you of a stealth player from way further than any in-game mechanic can provide you.
---
But to do so he'd need to play 12 hour days. So, it's kinda an issue if their play time is limited.
---
I doubt it. They will probably link PvP and PvE servers together to try to make the queue as short as possible. Horde are more active PvPers so they will probably have a longer queue but it'll probably be around 5-10 minutes like it is on retail.
---
I paid 1k for Netherwind Pants so not that delusional
---
Slow and grindy leveling (and lack of quality of life things) is a part of wow classic/vanilla appeal for people like your friends. 
---
Mage is one of the easiest/fastest classes to level.
---
Troll bots best bots. Thanks census add-ons LMAO
---
Idk, something todo with casting Corruption, weaving in some Fears and jumping. Oh, and don't forget to /rude and a n a LKILL
---
Ahahah this comment managed to be funny and depressing at the same time
---
Did you... did you drop this: /s?
---
That and the fact that you mad your schedule/life around wow
---
There’s also a large difference in the type of content. Punkrat and MadSeason typically do a lot of lists, similar to watchmojo and WhatCulture YouTube channels. When Asmon did YouTube, he had more discussion stuff akin to preach (though much more bias than preach)
---
You aren't honestly trying to compare a Hunter Ability to an Add-on any class can use...
---
Well, I sure hope they’ll be grouped by types (PvP and PvE). They don’t allow transfers between these two, so makes sense to not group them in BGs. 
---
How did they do it in Vanilla?
---
i’m a r druid on herod- druids usually run a mix of balance and resto at 60. You can also offtank really well with the heart of the wild setup, but that’s exactly what it is— getting assigned to trash groups while the warriors get to have all the fun. Druids struggle with dps and gold farming primarily (especially r druids, feral can mitigate some of these weaknesses)
---
Most peoplem enjoy having 1 or 2 druids for endgame content, as you get very large diminishing returns the more you bring (hots don’t stack from other druids, other classes perform better, druids run oom very fast, etc etc). With that being said, i enjoy having a big role so druid fits me well- i serve as our guilds top heals for our MT, and the flag currier in bgs
---
I can’t speak for feral, but as a balance/resto hybrid i love pvp on this class. I usually play alts for raids, but i always log into my druid for pvp- there’s just a fluidity and level of utility that no other class can match
---
He also doesn't understand that weapon dps is far better than his greens. You can practically level naked if you have a solid 2 hander and spec appropriately
---
I think they’ll link them also, but what most people don’t realize is those horde majority servers have like 10k players.  Alliance majority servers only have like 5k or less.
---
I just started playing again since BC. Why has alliance always been shit at PvP in vanilla? I remember playing Alliance back in vanilla and we always got wiped.
---

---
also recognize how bad the average player is, this is far beyond their capability
---
6% hit.
---
Everything is odd about that paint job
---
Sir, this is a Wendy's.
---
What a perfect comparison. A game is exactly like real life.
---
I'm just a little perplexed by it all. People are blowing their wads and begging for more to be released. They're gonna be through all the content before this time next year at this rate.
---
I didn't say there would be more open world though. Just that that's what I'll do inbetween bgs. People are still going to run the same dungeons they run now and farm the same things they farm when BGs come out, so no, I don't expect my open world pvp farm to change much. That's not even the point anyway.
---
It makes you a whining bitch; getting you killed is not griefing
---
Old Blanchy is 1:1 according to ironforge.pro (or was, it's now slightly horde) and before census was broken it was only slightly in favor of Alliance. It's a west coast PVE server, come join us :)
---
Mak’Gora! Mak’Gora! Mak’Gora!
---
Holy shit are you serious? That’s not how things work dude. Good luck in your lawsuit lol.
---
That's not how battlegroups were segregated in vanilla. You had servers of each type in each group.
---
Not magic, not cheating
---
what did you fucking expect
---
Why do people watch Sunday football?
---
Missed opportunity to call it "Stairway to Heaven: Entering UBRS as Horde on Skeram"
---
I mean most guilds usually require a few addons in order to attend raid. At least the good ones do.
---
lvl 38 priest, going to re spec shadow at 40 but still like to heal dungeons. I will probably be solo question a majority of the time leveling with a few dungeons thrown in for quests and gear. I got the illusionary rod from SM lib but have been seeing that the hypnotic blade+off hand is better? Unfortunately i already took the neck from the quest instead of the prophetic cane, is it worth running the library and graveyard a bunch more till i win the blade and the orb of the forgotten seer?
---
fury is really strong in pvp if you have aq and naxx offgear and everybody else dont.
---
the broadcast range of stealth in the combat long is so much further than the audio sound for stealth.  It's not a fair comparison at all.
---
You misread what i typed, i said mass audience persona. He acts the way people want him to, over what he really is.
---
And yep i specifically said that this kind of attitude was short lived as we could see from other streams like that
---
Im in the same boat, i was prot spec since 53 started farming dungeon non stop to 60, pretty much got all the good pre-raid bis tank gears, then my guild doesn’t need anymore tanks, so i switched to 17/34 full fury at 60, with the tank gear i have, i can still tank every dungeon with no problem. So yeh, like others have said, you don’t need a single point in prot to tank dungeons, you just need some tank gear.
---
they probably aren't going to quit the game, just your server. You may not feel anything for these people now, but in a few months/a year when the AQ event on your server is taking longer then it should you are going to miss these folks.
---
To add another data point, I was able to do this as holy specced with roughly 6.3k mana. I would downrank my holy nova at the end so that I used up as much mana as possible and only occasionally would have to wand anything down. 
---
The upside to going disc spec is if you don't have enough mana from gear or you want to pull off double pulls with inner focus + PI. However, doing double pulls means you're likely to max out your instance limit. I would reset the instance by having my alt in my party and leveling the alt while waiting for the 12 minute instance.
---
thats a...totally different...nvm im not gonna explain this
---
Fair
---
Yeah that's more the experience I'm used to. Someone else mentioned last night was more even, but I didn't play. I'll see how it goes tonight.
---
I kinda feel bad when our raid is standing in front of MC summoning and all the alliance die trying to get through. Then I see the nice little honorable kill numbers and I immediately feel better.
---
I would feel bad for you but you’re one of the rogues that just sits outside orgrimmar and cherry picks people with 1hp after a duel
---
Dont be a whinny bitch; you think irl ppl would love to see you complain about crap like that youve just described?
---
Nah, it's ok as a rogue. Circle to the back and delete the healer before the front of the deathball notices :D
---
Bro control your emotions
---
Yeah you gotta watch out don’t want that paladin healing you to death
---
8/11/32 has enough damage to kill 1v1 with current gear levels.  Druids will only get weaker as time goes on in regards to killing other players as your methods of damage (dots, bleeds, kiting) do not scale as well with spell power as other player's damage and health scales with their upgrades.  The more base damage your spells do in relation to another player's life pool, the more powerful you'll feel.
---
How are you expecting to participate in pvp skirmishes as 30/0/21?  Aside from healing of course. Druids are attrition killers, not burst damage dealers.  You'd be more of an asset in a group setting healing, interrupting, debuffing, and rooting than you would chain casting anemic starfires.
---
If you're worried about grinding with a pvp healing spec, don't be.  Collect as many cloth/leather pieces as you can with spell damage from 58+ dungeons and you can grind just fine as 8/11/32.  I used to grind all the time with a moonglow spec that didn't grab any damage increases.  You rely on starfire, insect swarm, and hurricane to "aoe grind" 3 - 4 mobs at a time.  Nothing in the balance tree matters enough to help you in any appreciable way grinding like this.
---
i hope you guys disinfect your phones
---
[I pointed this out a week ago but everyone downvoted me](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dwqvn5/now_thats_its_clear_the_servers_cant_handle_1/f7l7ejm/) because everyone wanted to call blizzard cheap and make fun of their server tech. Only just now the sheep stopped whining and are looking up to just how crowded into the paddock they are. 
---
Hopefully the community can use the immense amount of energy it has to identify a solution instead of kicking each other in the ass again.
---
Especially as a bs/miner...anvil/forge is right there too
---
If you want to play this game I can.  I dislike spy because of what it does, but I can accept that it is here to stay.
---
The issue comes down to purpose of information.  Caster bar mods do give information the player doesn't have, but the concept isn't the same.  The caster is very clearly casting.  Them casting is not a secret and the existence of them casting is not paramount to what they are doing.  The information of their cast time is not itself going to assist in their ability to "win".  Big Debuffs is not protecting some secret.  There aren't magical debuffs which are kept hidden from the player as a core mechanic of the game.
---
Spy negates actual game mechanics, not just give information.  The entire purpose of stealth and hiding visually is to avoid detection, and spy negates this.
---
I can accept it is here, but whenever I hear someone say "It just tells you what is in the combat log" I know they are full of shit.  No one is sitting there parsing their combat log in the middle of pvp to see if someone stealthed behind a tree in the middle of a larger battle.
---
What it comes down to is Spy works to directly counter a designed information disadvantage whereas shit like cast bars is not an inherent information disadvantage.
---
You might get a kill or 2 making it worth it.
---
This but unironically.
---
In guild is less of an issue. Mods like this have more potential to hurt pugs and community
---
Most clips you see are points when he’s playing up the character more than usual. He is often fairly chill and less obnoxious, but no one clipsvit because it’s not as inflammatory and doesn’t fit the whole “hurdy dur, streamers bad! Plague of earth!” agenda.
---
Tibia was SAVAGE back in the day.
---
but they pick a pvp server lolll
---
Faction based queues when?
---
I'm sucking it up.  That will be nice for sure.
---
Ah. Figured it may be that combo. Fear is great, when it works. Last night a level below me rogue was "immune" to it and still destroyed me while questing.
---
Also for Artisan Engineering (up to 300) you need to be lvl 35, so have info about the following step as well :)
---
&gt;I currently play on Stalagg as alliance
---
Dude, you had it coming. It was extremely obvious things were going to end up like that.
---
if you're suicide ganking people going from the AH to the bank in a capital city you aren't doing it for the honor you're doing it to be an asshole
---
Ret aura will widdle you down
---
When an ally makes a post about how he is getting ganked, redditors laugh.
---
When an hordie makes a post about how he is getting ganked, redditors be nice and rage over allies.
---
Lmao
---
this, so many Sheeple who dont think why is this good they just accept something/someone said it was good.
---
If they removed res timers on PVP combat, so I could corpse drag and not wait for my timer, that'd be great.
---
Nahh, there is more happening on my server. Groups of both factions roaming high level zones. People grouping up to farm Timbermaw rep, so they can fight back against opposite forces, etc.
---
At this rate we’ll have classic pandaria before the shadowlands lol
---
That you still curious why im not rank 14 already
---
Same boat man. I just got tired of Horde, too. I have a mage with my warrior who is like 26. So I may just do mage/warrior on one server and rogue/paladin on another to support eachother with gold and professions
---
I'd love to hear your precautions.
---
Best solo grind available for priests at the moment in my opinion. If you're low level or low on gear then stick with lashers (be careful that if they attack you in the back they will crit, so keep them in front of you).
---
If you're really ballin you'll do half the lashers, Hydro, Zev, hit the other half lashers on the way back, then kill or do the skip reset on Alzzin and hit the Rich Thorium Veins. All of these bosses are possible solo as a discipline priest (of course you'll move through it faster as shadow) if you know how to abuse the pathing mechanics. Depending on how lucky you feel with book drops or Essence of Water prices on your server (and having mining or herbing), you can decide if it's worth it to kill Hydro and Alzzin or skip to reduce time or risk of death. Bring Nightfin Soup and prioritize Mp5 gear over intellect once you hit 6,5k mana
---
K.
---
it was because allan adham played daoc on mark kern's request and realized how important pvp was for the alliance and horde conflict.  before that they were just races with different capitals that were not truly at war and just celebrating a tenuous peace. at least that what was brought up in one of those early esfand and tipsout interviewing john staats and mark kern.  I used to watch those when no other classic news or content was around.
---
Back in my day they taught people how to read in school, man I must be getting old.
---
" I encourage those players to play in their environment and have as much  fun as they can, WoW is a great game and caters to multiple playstyles  and multiple players. But it's the players own choice if they make a bad  selection and Blizzard should not intervene in these cases. It's like  rolling on a RP server and complaining there's too much roleplaying. "  
---
Never saw bad faith arguments like these outside the toxic cesspit of basement fungus that is the official forum. Back in your cave, Gollum.
---
You thought you did, but you didn't.
---
Whitemane is definitely not balanced, not even close.  Getting into BRM as an alliance, at any time of day, is literally the exact same as this video shows.
---
But maybe that will be an update, not a patch. Maybe the NPCs are already there but are invisible and can't be targeted like the rabbits in Onyxia's lair.
---
That's completely untrue. There was a book written about the creation of vanilla wow, in it they talk about how PvP came to be.
---
Anybody that needs to use spy deserves to have a bad time.
---
Oh sorry! I was thinking on the orc racial.
---
I prefer not to wear headphones if I don't have to, just like to have my ears unburdened. 
---
That said, if people have to constantly listen to game sounds / hear their echos through your microphone then you are being annoying as hell and need to enable push-to-talk.
---
Players like you make wow classic fun

You don't get xp from bgs

---
HaHa. Hitkazique (Horde) is the name you looking for but wont be free thats for sure :P
---
I don't have the spy addon, unless it came with KOS. Because that addon tells me when players are near.  I'm actually really liking it, since I'm 53 rogue trying to quest.  Lets me know when a Horde deathball is coming, so I can stealth and sprint the hell out of there.
---
So you're suggesting that they split the player base in half and double the required development resources. No one is going to, nor should they, have the game they 'want'. The community needs to realise that any version of this game will die in under 12 months if they don't adopt a policy of change like OSRS did.
---
Loot council removes important aspects about getting loot imo, and is highly likely to be corrupt, dkp is way more fair and incentivizes good players more along with being fun when you bid for stuff
---
I'm not sure I agree with you. There are plenty of games with simpler graphic styles that achieve popularity. Additionally, if the game were released now with all the same gameplay, story, quest, raid, pvp features and it had a new skin because it was developed in the late teens and not the early 00s I think it would achieve popularity. You wouldn't have people lining up to kill mobs because that's a symptom of it being a rebirthed game from from 15 years ago. If it were a new release the encounters would have been designed for a larger player base or the server size would have been limited to what it was originally. I don't know if it would be GOTY, but it would be immensely popular. Everything Blizz does is popular. Overwatch is pretty much trash but there's still tons of people who play it. Now add a loved IP to it and you've got a successful game. Also if WoW didn't exist we likely would have had another warcraft game or 2 by now that would have created a new generation of WC fans who would leap into WoW. I think you're just a little off the mark.
---
The horde players keep posting incomplete stats from census mods that show the overall split is 45-55 allinace/horde, But when you point out that those census mods have blank data pages for several horde leaning servers they just stop posting. Its going to be hysterical when teh BG's drop and the horde are queuing for hours while ally gets to pretty must just insta join whenever they want.
---
Man, I've been pretty much as efficient as I'd hoped in terms of leveling when I play. But I fell waaay behind because I went for like a month in a half playing maybe a few hours a week because of other life stuff, which I'm glad I did - I can't/won't go back to playing the game like I did in high school. Now I'm going out of town for a week and a half and I'm 2 lvls from 60 :(  I feel like I may have missed the window on some of the huge, pitched pvp battles going on which is really my main regret.
---
I mean, if the queues are too long we can always just kill your battle masters and go back to wpvp.
---
Look if advertising that you're crafting for free is scummy, then what do you call camping a fly path? What do you call camping entrances to dungeons? And yet people complaining about those things get told to shut up.

No one is entitled to any profit from their professions, stop defending these people
---
Tbf, as a shadow priest you really don’t have any super big problems
---
It's almost like this player is complaining about the poor way the game chooses to structure it's pvp.
---
Feeling points are the most OP currency on this sub. Collect enough of them and you can rank all the way from Minor Troll to Mega Douche.
---
Sure you can.
---
 `/castsequence Berserker Stance, Intercept, Defensive Stance`  
---
This would work fine.
---
Keep in mind, while you should be able to heal several endgame dungeons good enough at 56, there is the issue of having a bigger aggro range than a level 60. This is not an issue when doing the dungeon with other level 55-59s, but could make you less wanted in a level 60 party.
---
It's not hard to kill simone while kiting Precious. Keep simone silenced through Viper Sting, hit Precious with concussive/scatter/wing clip when it gets too close and just autoshot simone down.
---
Well right now ally are mass quiting. Horde quiting would atleast male servers heatltjy again
---
&gt;I'd probably do the same if I had it though :(
---
Then you have no right to complain.
---
As an AP/Frost Mage (traditional raid spec), is there a good rule of thumb i can use to decide between +spell damage and +spell crit %? Like how much damage is worth giving up for a crit%? For example, I have the [Band of Rumination](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18103/band-of-rumination) from UBRS, as well as the [Band of the Unicorn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7553/band-of-the-unicorn). A guildie of mine told me to use the Unicorn, so that's what I'm doing, but i'm curious as to if that is correct. 
---
In a similar vein, I'm currently using [Rod of the Ogre Magi](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18534/rod-of-the-ogre-magi) - but wondering if it would be worth it to farm for [Witchblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13964/witchblade) and pick up [Spirit of Aquamentas]((https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11904/spirit-of-aquementas)?
---
In the case of the rings, I'm giving up 13 spell damage for 1% crit (and 5mp5, which isnt a big deal right now since i don't have mana problems that i can't gem/pot my way out of). 
---
In the case of the weapons, I'd be giving up 6 int and 1% crit for 11 spell power.
---
Just looking for some theory-crafting advice :D thanks in advance
---
Can someone ELi5? I dont understand what im looking at
---
It really doesn’t matter, i can say in term of lvling speed they are about the same. I went full arm when lvling from start because tactical mastery, this talent make tanking low level dungeon much easier. Ms and bt does same dmg, don’t believe me? Look at ur weapon dmg, then look at ur ap*.45 and compare them urself. Ms only does more dmg at end game when you have purple two hander. Sweeping strike is also a good talent in arms tree. Just make sure nvr use dw, without +hit dw just sucks bad, always use two hander, you will be fine.
---
Grob mob!
---
I can never figure out what kind of responses people are looking for when they make these posts.
---
I am level 53. I have 70 kills and I’m corporal, all of my kills solo last week.
---
That is true, but I meant pvp realm, not pve. , everlook, mriage raceway, nethergarde, pyrewood, hydraxian all of them are pve realms. Not sure or auberdine but i guess it is the french pve realm.
---
no, the campers will more likely go to BGs for a faster rate of honor gain.
---
you still have competition from fury tanks since daggers are really good for it
---
Yeah it was bizarre. Monday and Tuesday night were way WORSE than the video. Couldn't go in either side of BRM as alliance. I am hopeful it will still be clear the next couple nights.
---
Tuesday is likely to always be a shitshow since it is such a popular raid night.
---
The core gameplay is almost the same, its pvp. Objectives and skills are very different ofcourse.
---
Alot of salt in the comments lol. I used to hate the guy tbh I thought he was a total fuckwad even though I never watched his streams, only some reeee highlights in compilations. I guess thats what happens when you livestream pretty much everyday - theres no shortage of content to cherry pick some of the more absurd and ridiculous moments. 
---
He's a pretty smart forward thinking guy actually. Sometimes he panders to his audience with a silly schtick, mostly for silly but inclusive interactions with his chat. The guy is just your average wow player at the core though, and his popularity has, imo, made him a target for those who think he's not deserving of attention (for a variety of nonsense reasons, most notably imo that he's so your average wow player, many people see themselves in him and they see "themselves" succeeding while they are not) . Alot of what he says or does will get taken out of context for a circlejerk of reddit karma or YouTube likes it seems.
---
Assuming 6 days to level a hunter and a generous 2 hours per strat live run.
---
You could level your hunter or you could farm 1656g in the same time.
---
6 days x 24 hours  / 2 hours per strat = 72 runs
---
72 runs  x 25g = 1800
---
Lets say a generous 2g repairs per run 
---
72 x 2 = 144
---
1800 - 144 = 1656g
---
You obviously have a massive ego complex as well if you think being in the group constitutes a carry.
---
No emote comes close to the disrespect cannibalize brings
---
Oh man you're making me miss tanking
---
I'm genuinely shocked that so many people are endorsing the pure pettiness here under the brand of PvP. On a literal level, yes, it is PvP, but it is still genuinely shitty and of no real benefit to the camping faction. "Hurrdurr less loot for them 2 kill me" is ridiculous, as if those few pieces of loot on select few people makes a significant difference. 
---
People seem to constantly be looking for an excuse to be shitty to one another. I have much more respect for the duel-fiend outside Org and such than people acting like toddlers throwing a tantrum because they weren't the ones getting the loot.
---
I've had multiple horde /shrug at me and run away half way through ganking me when I spam /lick at them, the key is to just creep them out
---
Dude everyone feels a bit like that at that level. You're only a third throught the levelling process at 40 😜
---
Unless you rolled on a PvP server.
---
Go to a zone. Do all the quests in that zone, then do the run around quests. Try downloading an add-on like questie to find out where a lot of good places to quest for you are.
---
Or not.
---
thnks man.
---
better stop thinking about leveling only engineer and start actually leveling the alt :)
---
If I use full consumables for a molten core run (because I am top dps, and I have a few people trying to catch me so I have to keep the bar high)
---
It costs like 50g for a molten core run doing this, that's not even an hour of time to prepare. If you can't run full consumables I have no idea what you spend your time doing.
---
I agree with you, this whole large server pop is exactly what the community asked for and now they're bitching about it which is ridiculous. 
---
But the point of having larger server pops in general is that there can be opposing faction players literally everywhere, and because the imbalance is so bad, the outnumbered faction will be countered anywhere. The server pop being increased doesn't mean that there's a faction balance. A smaller population of Alliance can group up and hold out in Winterspring, but because the Horde pop is 3x that, they're going to get a massive Horde counter whether they group up in Winterspring or STV. There's just so many of the opposing side that a sizeable counter can be raised no matter where the underpopulated faction wants to hold out.
---
That’s sorta my point. No one wants to be the hero and help out the imbalanced servers. Whether they’re unbalanced by pure population or by pvp experience people like you want to keep things as they are because they’re on the winning side n
---
Rogue is pretty fun to level if you have gold to buy gear, much harder to get gear at endgame though.
---
I got 12k and standing 65. It's still wack that it requires so little, I don't mind at all though.
---
Of course when you say it in absolutes like that it rings false. 
---
Horde is more active in PvP, per capita. That’s a fact. It’s clearly evident.
---
Never played retail never care to.
---
Classic is not for you my friend.
---
Yeah I’ve done that multiple times.  Thanks though!
---
That would be nice, free farm anytime :D
---
How can it be unfair if everyone can download it?
---
It’s honestly a rough guess. The current meta for MC is flash heal spam, which has less than 50% coefficient. I assume there might be some heals/gheal tossed in to bring the average coefficient. 
---
Odds are, if you use a lot of renew/longer cast heals, you get sniped a lot. So having the extra +healing gets wasted a lot. Same can happen with fheal, but is less likely.
---
Imagine being such a tool that when your GM asks you to report someone out of spite you actually follow orders.
---
Squeeze not too hard tho
---
#3 person on my server had 99k honor last week
---
lmao true true
---
Only ever saw it drop once.
---
Blizzard broke the census add-on so people couldn't report their player numbers publicly, all we need is literally everyone using this addon to get blizzard to break it too
---
The main thing I would say about leveling with a spec like 9/21/21 is that you really want 5/5 suppression, 5/5 Corruption (make it instant), and 2/2 Improved Lifetap and you cant have them all with the 9 points.  Maxing out Suppression is important for leveling.
---
Eh. By the time you run back to the flight path and fly to wherever you want to go the queue will pop within a few minutes.
---
I would imagine this is pretty reliable from discord

---
Blame the prevalence of BiS lists. HOJ has made it on to several site's hunter gear guides.
---
Seriously this game without keybinds is 100x times harder and less efficient. Do yourself a favor man!
---
The buff limit is preventing us from mage tanking Rag. It's an atrocity of imbalance that we can't bandage, power word shield, rejuv, regrowth mages at the same time and expect none of their buffs to fall off. This is hurting the progression of my Gandalf RP guild where we are all physical classes except the one wizard who tanks the balrog.
---
I too want the fishing event, losing catches in Azshara because we can't hit the cap yet hurts.
---
I've only ever noticed crazy performance issues with quests that required items that could drop from basically *any* mob, like a Jade for the mage quest or e.g Silk Cloth.
---
IIRC classiccodex already rolled a fix for it by ignoring items with droprates lower than 2%.
---
HORDE DETECTED, INITIATE PVP
---
one of those if its not bis its trash people
---
Can you source where you found that "there weren't even supposed to be two factions at odds at each other." Because that's literally been warcrafts gameplay since the first Warcraft.
---
Ret is a bit of a meme, but honestly they are a nightmare for other melee to fight 1v1.
---
You have to kill them twice basically, three times if they really decide they don’t want to die and use LoH, meanwhile they are pretty tanks and Seal of Casino change the fight from “haha look at this pally” to “excuse me what the fuck” in a matter of seconds. So yeah if the rogue doesn’t kill you in the opener he’s better off just finding someone else to fight.
---
Sometimes it feels like the ret pally meme went way too far, they really are pretty decent in PvP.
---
Not at all.
---
Vanilla had this
---
Private servers had this
---
Somehow 15 years later people still don't know this is what happens in the world of WARcraft.
---
Maybe FF14 is a better game for you guys? How about some Roblox?
---
Is this Bamx? I was really surprised he was doing it for free and thought it was a scam for mats. He told me he is doing it so horde can pvp better. It's so crap that people are reporting him.
---
Oh we made a huge deal with it. Almost the whole guild opened a ticket with some accusation of the other guild hows got the recipe aswell. We got him unmuted after a day but blizzard "cant" or dont want to deal with those false reports.. Its a shame :/
---
So there I was, I missed the raid train from kargath because I was making water for everyone, I’m on my way with my buffs ready to raid. I’m scared, alliance have been wandering in packs. Nearing the cauldron I see a lvl 50 hunter going about his business, “hm maybe I should kill him” I thought, no, I don’t feel like being a dick. Then suddenly, out of the blue I get sapped, 2 insanely god pvp rogues double team me, I quickly Ice block. Little did they know it was a juke, I quickly cancel ice block because I am god at pvp and frost nova them with a shatter coc and fire blast one. All Crits. I am god. One rogue runs away out of sheer fear while I battle the other one. Cold blood eviscerate  and there goes my hp. It was a valiant fight but he died. I victoriously drink my water and eat my food with my 100hp and there he is. The hunter. We lock eyes and then my worst nightmare came true, hunters mark. Multi shot. I’m dead. My raid buffs gone. My heart broken from the feeling of mutual trust betrayed.”man I should have killed him” I think to myself.
---
Just a little bit of clearing. Even a straight clear to the bar would have been easier, or perhaps *less boring* than five separate waiting sessions.
---
I don't blame OP tho, they were clearly brain-addled by weeks of DIO grinding.
---
Any server where the Alliance population is more than Horde? Crazy that people think this is a faction specific problem.
---
Spoken like a horde player.
---
When was the last time you saw a horde post complaining about Alliance ganking?
---
40 sapper charges.
---
Its such a stupid fucking decision. Hey you guys know how our internet completely sucked dick back in the day? Were gonna bring that back for nostalgia’s sake. 
---
Kill me.
---
I laugh when undead cannibalize me because undead never do anything else. I’d feel disrespected if all of you undead didn’t do the same thing lol
---
Is your GM Vicious on Pagle? Dude's a cunt.
---
I found an equal leveled undead rogue in hinterlands. He was facing away from me, at the other side of a pond, just deep enough to be swimming. He was trying to apply his poisons over and over again. Their cast bar just kept resetting. So I cast water breathing on myself and swam to the bottom of the pond. Sent my pet to attack and dropped all 5 doots on him. Melted.
---
I thought they nerfed the crap out of this.  Are you just making money on herbs and books?
---
I really don't, though. Which is why I specifically reference my server when I mention issues we're experiencing there instead of just stating the issues as though everyone here plays on Incendius.  
---
It does seem to be extremely rough out there for one faction on most servers, though. Very lopsided. Blizzard could resolve this problem if they really wanted to.
---
Lets be real, what are the arguments for NOT fixing this?
---
What did they have at stake? The mob doesnt despawn until 5 hrs later...
---
I was waiting for the Epstein didn’t kill himself line. Disappoint
---
I want to start a gdkp pug once mc isn't guild run, see if some of the richer less geared player want to get some great for gold, and give the geared player a reason to go to molten core and tear it apart
---
I didn't plan at all and just got lucky.
---
I like to level my locks as pure demonology (after getting instacast corruption). It is great for solo and dungeon, if a little slow on grinding if you want your vw to tank for you.
---
Why cause I don't like watching people chase a ball for a few hours? Things I can do in that time.. Or better play
---
Shaman in my opinion the best class for this, though I’m biased. You can level as 30/0/21 and melt faces in pvp along with still heal in raids, without needing gear changes. You can even dps in raids if you wanted to and it was good with your guild.
---
No idea since I m rogue and only ever used it on rogue.
---
how do you like bfa so far?  are you excited for the n'zoth patch coming out?
---
Yep, you're right
---
Wow holy shit my dude, you just assumed a lot from my one question. I asked what server he was on for allaince to be deathballing? At no point did i state this was an issue or even a faction specific issue.
---
haha very funny hahahaha
---
How is blizzard not listening to their player base? We all spammed this subreddit with #nochanges. Back in vanilla, the honor system came out before battlegrounds, which were released 6 weeks later. Not downplaying your frustration, but I would blame the current player base and their delusional expectations to all reach rank 14.
---
I'm at a point where I wish I had just stuck with the first character I made. After I started that character (it was a dwarf priest on a PvE server, which was the only server I could get into), some of my old friends (which were also old guildmates) started playing.
---
So I swapped servers to join them. It was Horde on a PvE server, so not a big deal, I just made an undead priest and played with them. Then they decided to move to Horde on a PvP server.
---
So I joined them on the PvP server. Again, made a priest. After about two or three weeks, they either quit playing or moved to different servers again.
---
So I'm left with THREE mid-20s priests on three different servers, and just wishing I had stuck with the first one. So I made a warrior on the PvP server and have been sticking with it. I've resigned myself to this fate, but wish I had more time to play, because I'm terribly behind.
---
Alliance have Pallies , theyll be fine
---
Was honestly expecting the story to go the other way. Friends quit, guild is better. But that's just from all the neck beards here. Friends always #1 otherwise this game is shit
---
&gt;The population of Classic is not even remotely comparable to pserver populations
---
Never said it was.
---
I'd happily take the 2k gold and get the next one.
---
they were grouped by physical data centre location
---
battlegroups had every type of realm
---
On my server horde is too dominant for alliance to have a chance to kill a world boss. But when deciding over loot our druide stealthed into dead azuregos and skinned him with 40 Horde standing around the dragon 😂
---
Yeah I'd be more concerned with the fact that one my guildies misunderstands itemization so badly than the fact that they outrolled me on am item they don't need.. at all.. any guide sayings it's a huge upgrade is hilarious unless it's talking for a spriest.    You can buy cheap boe amulets better than that one for a healer
---
That addon was fixed in 2 weeks.
---
if you attack them you lose the debuff, they can keep you in poly/sap for 30 sec and just get their 20honor of you xd
---
Yea but the end result is you just saved a few gold on consumables that night, even if you knew about this bug you still would have wanted to get the world buffs as they are more powerful
---
Gavins dad the forgotten.
---
Do you want to PvP as a healer? Or as dps?
---
If you want to PvP as a healer, you'll have your dick sucked if you're a shaman - especially once BG's are out. Deep resto works for both PvE and PvP.
---
If you want to be a hybrid, 30/0/21 works for both raiding (more casual) and PvP as a mostly healing healer with the occasional big burst damage. Keep in mind this spec is fine for now (MC and BWL), but deep resto is almost a requirement once you get to AQ and Naxx as the fights get significantly longer and your mana totem is essential.
---
Sit on my face and let my lips embrace you  
---
I'll sit on your face and let my love be truly  
---
Life can be fine if we both sixty-nine  
---
If we sit on our faces in all sorts of places and play  
---
Till we're blown away
---
I just got my Gnome Warlock to level 60 last night and I'm pretty garbage at PvP. I'm looking for any advice to get better, no matter how big or small. Strategies for certain matchups, gear I should get while I earn honor, items I should be using. 
---
Right now my professions are Skinning and Herbalism for gold as I leveled, but I am ready to change them. I was thinking of going Tailoring to get the Robe of the Void and switching off to Alchemy later. Thanks!
---
You can just test it.  If I remember blue yeti has a directional audio setting so it wont pick up speakers from behind as much.
---
Then just go into audio devices, set your mic to "listen to this device" and just talk normally and see if the background is a huge issue.
---
For anyone not having fun, roll a different CLASS, RACE and faction.
---
I know that back door is faster!!!!  Few nights ago the tank was pissed we went to that door saying that's the long way lol.  I didn't know but I ran both entrances to live side and I was certain when you go through that gate it was quicker. 
---
 We only want them orbs anyways lol. I had 11 drop last 2 runs. Only need 1 more for my bis chest. Plus the pattern but I'll buy the pattern for the 50g lol cheap af for a bis piece.
---
This is honest curiosity, more power to you for taking on a project like this:
---
Given that you're a fullstack developer, have you considered how this data could violate GDPR and how to handle it?
---
Well, shit. Don't blame me for being wrong, it's what the tooltip says.
---
I play on a roughly 2:1 ally:horde PvE server, and we still are vastly outnumbered in the fields. Seems like horde in general is just more interested in PvP antics.
---
I'd say CCB gives an obvious advantage.
---
Spy doesn't update the list in combat (still parses but no name pops up iirc) making it more useful in wpvp for avoiding fights or finding players.
---
While an enemy w/ CCB removes being able to use an item that looks like a cast to burn counterspell or kick ("They're obviously casting a spell"),  making it more useful when you actually get into the combat part, mostly 1v1s.
---
Same here
---
Just inspect the players you invite to your group in game instead same shit
---
Wouldn’t it work as:
---
#showtooltip Polymorph
---
/cast [@mouseover, harm][] !Polymorph
---
Sorry, but that is almost the same is doing away with all of it. It would at the same time get rid of damage meters, decursing aides, etc.
---
How do? All the census data I’ve seen puts it at almost an exact 50/50 split across all the servers.   Unless alliance don’t queue as much?
---
yes it is good, at least until you get through BFD with the quest sword and board from there.  The stats do help a lot, 70 health and 3.5 health per tick is pretty good.  Spirit is probably the strongest stat for warrior leveling, because it reduces your downtime spent regenerating health between combat engagements significantly.
---
Might be good for them but I still don’t think they deserve to roll on it over rogues, but obviously I’m biased. Daggers are also good for Fury Warriors in pvp for spell knock back but that’s not a reason to roll on Perditions. Perditions is rogue BiS until they get Death’s Sting, a 4% drop chance off C’thun. Realistically fury and prot have dar more options than dagger rogue builds.
---
when i chose to make my character on stalagg, the ratio was 45/55. again, i'm ok with how things are, but i know many people aren't. and there are other servers with faction ratio issues as well (heartseeker). there's no reason to not try and brainstorm ways of fixing them
---
No, not in one button.  It's not possible, you would have to separate the stances, use modifiers, or make it a cast sequence.
---
Yeah, I can't say that being dead adds to my excitement lol. Doing quests is sometimes fun, but I also get weird pressure by the virtue of me being so underleveled compared to my friends that we can't really play together
---
I play on a pve server, what's all this about?
---
Nice meme
---
In English it means bat poop, bat shit, bat excrement, phrase it as you will. Some languages don't have so many words for "the stuff that comes out of an anus".
---
Most people won't bother unless the queue is 1+ hour due to travel time.
---
All that shit is amazing for farming Essence of Water. Swimming fast af' to different islands in Azshara? Sign me up. Extra fishing on gear for those pools? Sign me up.
---
Overheard in Ironforge Bank after last night:
---
“He got me,” a level 50 hunter said of Jasrlkane's dominance over him. "That f\*\*\*ing mage boomed me."
---
The level 50 hunter added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.
---
The level 50 hunter then said he wanted to add Jasrlkane to the list of players he kills on sight this summer.
---
For real. Also complaining about Fd? Cmon weak bait.
---
Getting tribute/songflower/ony buff is not that difficult. I'm not even in the main raid of my guild and majority of the people in raid 2 get these.
---
You misunderstood me, nothing should ever be loot councilled, but saying "this is tank priority, only tanks can bid' is definitely helpful for early gearing
---
Having a group decide loot for everyone is just bullshit
---
I use spy to try avoid situations exactly like this. Even with spy 9 times out of 10 when I get a rogue stealth warning I still die because I get CC locked  and he cleanses my 1 CC ability.
---
2 hours farming consumables? Where are you getting this?
---
20-30g for mana pots and elixirs and shit, then maybe 20-30 mins for DM buffs if you are unorganized.
---
Also the idea is you can spread your farming over the week to get mc done faster.
---
Last night my guild had a raid and we rain in with a second Alliance raid. We wiped about 80 horde at the entrance cleared another 20 or so along the chain but then ran into another 70+ at the entrance to MC. I will say it was fun, but it isn't about winning, it's about holding on as long as you can as Alliance.
---
I went from horde to ally in wrath, it was definitely possible before cata.
---
so i played wow for like 12 years doing exactly this
---
Mic + sound through speakers because i really dont like wearing a headset all the time
---
it works perfectly fine, just have a pust to talk activation button
---
They see themselves being made fun of and it hurts their feelings.
---
everything you said i agree with, i RL and i wish more ppl had your POV
---
Not sure if this is a joke or not, but it's accurate
---
It's more along the lines of not feeling appreciated when a mage who can farm 70g an hour on his own is a cheapskate trying to fuck over a tank who already struggles to make gold. 
---
People get a lot more out of the run than the tank with his shitty 20g for an hour of tanking. Who would do that?
---
There is &gt;no&lt; reason for a tank to do strat live apart from gold. So why then would he want to do the most sought after job in the game for 20g an hour? Where is the incentive?
---
A raid geared tank doing strat live for preBiS farming people? That constitutes a carry in my book. Even more so if he wields a 2hander + having a shaman healer buddy who split the orbs. Then the warrior even does 60% of the groups damage and could duo run the dungeon without the DPS to begin with.
---
it's not really fair to assume everyone who is complaining about server pop also wanted higher server pops. i was happy with the pops in vanilla or slightly higher. i never thought it was a good idea to have servers with 5-6k players on them
---
There's a joke here, but I'm not smart enough to find it.
---
"Is PvP what the kids are calling it these days?"
---
I definitely will. I’ll have to look up some recommend priest-specific ones. Any general ones you recommend?
---
Grind all day only to die and lose all progress. That game was definitely savage.
---
You do you dawg, reality’s not for me though.
---
Yeah, I guess you're right. I am still going to get to 60 to see what group content is really like, guess I was just looking for an easy answer
---
You should really find a good leveling guide because it just sounds like you dont know what you are doing.
---
Still a lot of dedication for something so silly as wow; it will be always subject to criticize; be better and quit wow completely
---
Why hello there! It seems kinda useless, apart from a few people, who try to mount some sort of defence, but not good enough.. Short end of the stick I guess, we atone for Horde gankers on all other realm it seems :D
---
How can you solo Alzzin?
---
I always felt like I had a hard time against hunters lvling as a warlock.
---
Thanks for your response, you've confirmed some of my fears about a warrior.  I'm still intrigued by Druid so I'll look into more what pvp at 60 is like.  I played a resto druid in wotlk, but I know classic druid pvp is a lot different without lifebloom, cyclone, etc.  I never really considered hunter but I'll look into that as well.
---
You don't seem to be too short on gold, I think if you just continue playing the way you are and rack up what you can, then reinvest and sell portals at 40 it shouldn't take you too long at all :)
---
Yes, that's what I remember, too. It was something that came up later in developement, it was not part of the initial concept. And they really didn't build a PvP game, they just realized that this element had to be present in some form. So they made it opt-in and later provided BGs and arenas for more consensual PvP. The PvP-servers were just an alternate ruleset option, like they were in EQ (i.e. the game they throughoutly ripped off with WoW).
---
i don't think im 'bitching about classic'--im trying to brainstorm ways to improve it. your response seems unjustifiably aggressive
---
It would be nice if they clustered to minimize queue times, maximize subjective between gear and honor level, and of course minimize the number of servers per cluster so you actually recognize some people.
---
....my god, that be how I get into BRD now.
---
????
---
Warlocks have no cooldowns except if they were lucky enough to get toep.
---
First point is objectively untrue. It's week 2 now and it hasn't even died down a little. If anything, there's MORE people out there camping yesterday.
---
&gt; The second issue is the amount of people who are deadset on starting their rank 14 grind from day one.
---
Completely irrelevant and you can't even begin to make an argument with this assertion.
---
The reality is it's almost 100% fault of the overpopulation.
---
Invis potion
---
I have zero issue understanding your point, it seems to me that your brain is unable to process an argumentative explanation.
---
Maybe I'll use a language you can understand:
---
"YOUR IDEAS ARE NOT FACT, BRUHHHH" 
---
Iam not saying you are wrong, iam saying that you cannot know that the whine is responsible for  the early BG release. 
---
Except if you are working at blizzard HQ you have 0 way to know this, it's just speculative. Or maybe you have acces to all their mail and exchange on the matter? 
---
You can reply if you want it's a waste of time for me, I'll stop there.
---
The loot, because not everyone in the raid group has 5 hours to fight for it.
---
What's the pvp combat dagger build look like?
---
Great drama, I was really invested after reading the forums. Awesome that they resorted to RPing it out.
---
Isn't the cap 420? Which is reachable with the big iron rod and aquadynamic rush attractors. Or am I missing something?
---
I jerk off to my screen everytime I play because of the illusion of elitism I have for not using specific addons -this guy probably
---
Pretty much every single pvp server is 60% horde or worse.
---
Instead of rerolling, what about just leveling an alt? A little while back, I leveled a hunter to 35 and took up leather working and alchemy. Not only did I get a nice change of pace, but now I'm also receiving gold every 2/3 days from transmutes and cured rugged hide.
---
what change?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt;So its only gonna get worse.
---
I'm not sure how you arrived at that conclusion or what you're even referring to.
---
alliance does the same thing on heartseekers. its not faction. its people. People will do this when given the opportunity.
---
It took me no less than 14 weeks to hit rank 14 in Vanilla with a regular WSG group running 12+ hour days and finishing all top ten spots weekly. At the time I had no life. Relax. The odds of getting there if you have a life are slim to none.
---
Yeah exactly rofl
---
“Aww how cute look at this pally thinking he’s actually going to do something to me”. Dead.
---
To those feeling discouraged and those who abandoned us, alliance took Kazzak this morning on skeram! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9Km3D7EF9k congrats to guys putting in the effort to make these things happen!
---
this is honestly exactly what i was looking for, thank you
---
How long is your neckbeard
---
Sartharion 3D was hardmode since you never needed to keep 3 dragons alive to kill him.
---
If we go that route Yogg'saron with 0 keepers is harder than  sartharion 3D...
---
The point is: everything was harder than the entry level raid aka Naxx.
---
Explaining your own joke, dude? Come on I was already cringing pretty hard.
---
Lol, I didnt, either. The only issue I see is if you are a shaman or pally. Maybe pick the class you want? Idk. I would totally faction change if allowed, but I'm not going to level a brand new character
---
Come to Westfall horde.  Imbalance in Alliance favor, but strong horde side.  Groups of people who migrated the days before release.
---
The one I picked, grobb.
---
50/50 pop on a server about the same population as a high pop server from the peak of classic. We have a couple shitty megaguilds, but that's true of any server.
---
#MeToo
---
&gt;Just whine on Reddit obviously.
---
Are you trying to say it's fruitless?  
---
I wonder why bgs were announced to come out early. 
---
Almost as if player feedback helps.
---
If you use logs then reference their casts of their key abilities. I'm caster lead so I mostly look at frostbolt and shadowbolt counts (ignores gear) , and decurse counts on the relevant fights.
---
Idk if it's like this in other servers but being Alliance on Blaumeux is hella discouraging because they don't even try to fight back now, you ask for help in chat and half the time nobody responds, and the other half of the time all you get is some doofus telling you that you shouldn't have rolled on a pvp server
---
I meant your tangent is a little embarrassing.
---
I am new the game and was wondering where the WPVP hotspots are.
---
There’s already someone working on a similar project and when be posted it on reddit not many players liked this.
---
I have a level 56.5 druid that I picked because I play casual and don't want to switch specs between game modes, boy was I wrong. Druid is more for a hardcore player who is willing to farm all these things to make it be viable.
---
So I have decided in the choice of making an ele/resto hybrid. It's an amazing spec that has high burst with healing for sustain, tons of outplay ability with totems and is a good healer in raids. So I'll be able to do my PvE content healing possibly DPSing every blue moon and I'm able to play a ranged burst caster in PvP.
---
Your saltiness just makes us wanna eat you more :)
---
Get it?
---
Because anyone could just edit the addon name (or what ever blizzard would  use to detect the specific addon) and it would work again. Blizzard would not be able to keep up, and the addon would still work.
---
Not my problem.
---
Yeah, NPCs don't cast spells. Definitely a PVP addon.
---
Ave Ventura 2 anyone??
---
[Meanwhile logging in on the Alliance side](https://i.imgur.com/bW7zkGa.jpg)
---
Did you try to click on stealth?
---
 more like roaming as 9 or 10, grab flag find other flag carrier and kill him.
---
I feel like a shell/meat smoothie should count.
---
Its like a 1/6 drop chance. Im a mage and ive been trying to get it. The last prebis for me. Its one of only 2 caster items that have hit on it. Hit is also the most valuable stats for casters vs bosses and its useless as a healer. I would be pissed lol.
---
That's what you get for bringing in your own 60
---
Everyone says that. What do you think they nerfed?
---
There's no behavior to defend. I'm a #changes person.. I wouldn't care if Blizzard added strong guards that take 2 raids to kill at flightmasters.
---
It's just baffling to see you surprised and outraged over behavior that not only happened in vanilla (despite you saying otherwise) but has been predicted forever.
---
If you don't want to be camped at a flight path, walk. If you want to be mad, be mad at the #nochanges dolts that forced Blizzard to give you an authentic vanilla experience with an authentic ruleset. 
---
Or go back to retail where you can turn off warmode
---
Ooked in the Dooker.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills and Blackrock Mountain
---
I agree, it's an OP item to farm Essence of water and to farm tidal charm, but the amount of players that will try to win the tourny (let alone actually win it) is so low that it won't effect the game in a way that makes it a must-have-item. Also, I'd be interested to see the amount of players (probably all lvl 60) that will be farming essence of water in the sea. I'm sure there's better places to farm on land; especially with an epic mount, but I get what you mean that there will be more competition on land so this trinket can help in that regard.
---
The populations of both of those groups are so low that I doubt blizzard would make it a focus of discussion.
---
lol nice name
---
That or just the opposite faction equivalent. Gear would be an issue though, people would hate free gear.
---
Exactly so fuck their "backlash". Stop playing for others entertainment and play for your own. Spam it and if people wanna join they'll join, otherwise ignore the idiots.
---
That sucks. On Incendius I can at least go to a different zone to pvp. Everlook at felwood have a solid ally presence there.
---
Burning steppes and searing gorge feels like being a finding Nemo seagull. Shit isn't fun at all
---
Hey, we have a massive ogre problem, why don't you go and kill 8 of their shamans? Nevermind that the place is full of warlocks and warlords.
---
Yeah it’s just the death squads, single encounters are super rare. They usually patrol the main roads up and down. 
---
Thank you for indirectly helping me hit 59 yesterday, I’m pretty sure you guys were the reason there were no death squads early in the evening.
---
I was just referring to the commentary by OP. I think Reddit is a great platform for player feedback and it’s good to see it being taken into consideration. For any record; I’m alliance on Skeram.
---
Because the variations would appear too fast for them to respond. And it would be hard to make a reliable "Spy detector" because it fundamentally doesn't do anything different from any other addon. It just parses the combat log and produces UI elements. That's definitely not something Blizzard will put development effort into.
---
Dude don't pretend, you know there's a ton more horde. Yes alliance do it, but you know damn well the faction imbalance issues.
---
I don't see how this would violate GDPR
---
If you're saying red apples are PVP and green are PVE, you'd be right! Good job.
---
What's the next upgrade after Staff of Jordan? I've had it since level 37, and the LBRD staff drop still doesn't seem to be as good.
---
Deviate Deligth! RP PVP its basicaly grobbulus but not so crowed, less tryhard guilds and of course not 45 corpse runs
---
It's terrible for those that genuinely value the dynamic aspect of PvP. I have friends considering leaving the server because they can't enjoy the world PvP that is going on. They are waiting until bgs.
---
Exactly... but the quantity of players doesnt matter much if their health pools are 5 times larger. 
---
The mechanics originally were deadly, but if you have 5 times more health then they cant possibly be as deadly anymore. (unless they were designed to instakill, like Sapphiron bomb)
---
Lol suffer the wrath of the horde Mr salt
---
Yeah. Wish I levelled my mage first instead of resto Druid 🤬
---
Sorry, my bad
---
Where is this from?
---
He took the fight 1vs1 and you came back with with a group..... no wonder world pvp is in such a state
---
I've read that the lashers barely drop anything.  Haven't tried it yet because of this.  Maybe I'll give it a go tonight.
---
They get muted, had it happened to a guildie who spammed lfg.  In fairness I think you deserve it if you spam enough to get reported.
---
But salty crafters reporting is another thing entirely.
---
One clear bring a mage lock healer and whatever with you. Have one more member on standby in a raid. Summon you to instance port you to bank.
---
&gt;65/45 
---
Lol bro do you even math
---
I’m Specced for SM/ruin right now at lv 47. All of my points have been affliction and I have like 7 points in destro so far. 
---
Luckily for me I level with a pally 90% of the time so full destro spec was pulling way too much aggro so I switched to affliction. 
---
I use curse of shadow a lot and siphon life, corruption and drain life and it makes you extremely hard to kill when getting beat on. When nightfall procs I’ll throw a shadowbolt and go right back to drain life or wanding.
---
I expect to corpse run, but is it for 45 minutes every single time on Grob? Because that's what it is on my server. And yes I did play Vanilla on a PvP server and it was nowhere near what I deal with in Classic.
---
*Horde players actually believe this*
---
What are the good non-deathball locations?
---
Just learned last night to can’t BoP people who aren’t in my party/raid lol that poor mage
---
I really like MadSeason too and used to like Punkrat but his videos are so clickbaity I stopped watching.
---
Pretty funny they're so defensive over an obvious shitpost.
---
Well they're not wrong. That article with the estimated populations came out and some servers were a bit unbalanced so the minority factions abandoned ship. Skeram wouldn't be like this if everyone didn't leave. It would just be a regular PvP server.
---
Wat?
---
zugzug
---
But aren’t they all trivial atm? ;p
---
Get the 3p T1 set for .1 off fheal cast time and go to town with the paladins. I usually use rank 4 to give me enough longevity for our fights, without the need to pot. But that does depend on the rest of the raids performance.
---
But I agree, I hope BWL offers a bit more for healers. Never raided it when it was current, so I don’t know if those saying it’s not much more than MC are exaggerating or not.
---
Yeah because they can play 110 football players at once. How clueless are people like you?
---
A lot of guilds wont farm naxx, even after naxx vs is out.
---
&gt; I might be back if BC 
---
I like how you think that would fix the problem of grinding, having no money and getting quick groups with PUGs that don't ragequit. Wait for WotLK classic where none of the above matters.
---
He didn't spell anything incorrectly though

Here you go, this should do the trick.

Does pvp rank 3 give a discount on epic mount or riding?
---
&gt; half the spouses
---
This math doesn't work out.
---
Its more Shadowlands than it is Vanilla, Ill say that. And the more people that clamor for TBC, the less hope I have for Classic+. I cant see Blizz pursuing both those options. And TBC is of course already the cheaper of the two. 
---
I just dont get why people want to start this whole crazy rat race again. Its like playing MTG. Eventually you realize that they just make the cards better each set to get you to buy em, the game itself doesnt really get any better or grow laterally.
---
I just need to farm 14 essence of water and that's like 20g per on my server. I'm leveling fishing now. I'm a Holy Priest so I don't have much farm-ability out in the contested water elemental areas. I saw a video somewhere that made it seem like the islands in Azshara were the best way to farm Essence of Water. Any advice on any quicker ways for a healer to farm them?
---
How do I get the UI to look the way this guy has it? Is it an in game setting or an Add On?
---
it's pretty easy to call them out on this in voice...
---
why would they be better off that way? Wouldn't they learn faster if a better player would take the time to actually teach them instead of having to learn with a bunch of other people who don't know what they're doing?
---
Mild? Only 3 deaths?
---
It took me over 15 corpse runs to get into BRS on Fairbanks yesterday. Holy shit I wish it was only 3. 
---
Get out of here.
---
Is your GM... also your ex-girlfriend?
---
Tons of people I know have quit in the last week. P2 really turned folks off
---
What standing?
---
What server are you on? Horde getting camped sounds unusual.
---
World of LettingTheOtherFactionLootTheWorldBosscraft
---
In a group of a billion hordes, one of them is bound to be a warlock, or simply have spy and AoE.
---
What they really should do is group loot. Then anybody just needs to click the dragon and the loot gets teleported to the bags of the winner.
---
Why play at all then? The rat race to be the best is literally 90% of what entices people to play I imagine
---
Do not queue in BGs more than max weekly levels. you cant make more than X levels per week.
---
I support killing elves of any level they aren't real people. 
---
Gnomes however should be spared, they are too precious and few to be hunted.
---
You are part of the problem though. All the alliance that left just made matters worse for the people that stayed. Non faction based transfers exacerbated the issue greatly.
---
I think Blaumeaux (probably spelled wrong) is also almost 50:50 alliance horde
---
Yar
---
&gt;If you quit the game because you got killed a few times in your capital city (remember you can't get ganked 24/7 because of pvp flag in your own city) you can't be helped.
---
I don't think you are comprehending the entire picture. Getting back to a capital city can take a monumental effort of you are getting camped. Finding a safe place to hearth from a group of 20 is no easy tasks and can take upwards to an hour for some people. Then you finally get back and boom you are back to being camped in your own city. Can you see how that would frustrate some? Not only is the world closed to play in but now your capital city is as well.
---
I get triggered every time I see a group reserving DR MH and the party leader doesn’t have the key. If you got the key you can reserve 1 item of your choice. If you don’t have the key you don’t deserve to reserve anything
---
You misunderstand, this is the real classic experience and why you chose a pvp server over pve. Now go enjoy.
---
Maybe not at once but when you can pull talent from a pool twice as large, it's a big advantage.
---
Sunscale Salmon is a nice trickle heal with spirit bond if you are a hunter. Also Greater Sagefish with the m+5 is my favorite. I sell the nightfin soup and squid so don't eat those myself.
---
I tend to cook and eat whatever trash fish I have piles of (lobster, yellowtail ect) and feed the pet the same thing to save bag space.
---
It does have a 30 min cd
---
Pvp literally stands for Player Versus Player.
---
While I do agree with your reasoning, to say that a player killing another player is not pvp is simply just not true. You can say that it’s not fun or not fair because it’s a 60 versus a 51, but it’s still pvp whether you like it or not. This is classic wow, not a different game. This is how blizzard designed the honor system.
---
I personally believe 1v1s and 1vX’s are a ton of fun and would much rather do that than run around with 5-10 people killing solo players.
---
But alas, the wow honor system doesn’t care. Honor is honor and you are competing against the rest of your faction in amount of honor. Take what you.
---
It’s a game design flaw, not a player flaw. So I think it’s perfectly valid for people to be saying “you chose a pvp server”, because you knew how blizzard created the honor system and you should have seen this coming. Should be better when bgs come out.
---
That being said, killing players who don’t award honor is ridiculous. You are an evil person if you kill grey level players just for fun.
---
Brad McQuaid died on Monday. I am not certain that this will end up killing pantheon as there is an entire studio developing it but without Brad it will be compromised. I see the release product being a corner cutting cash grab to fund another project.
---
I don't like it but I do understand I have to accept it and adjust
---
Didn't they do this in retail?
---
This is literally the funniest gif ever, wish the audio worked. I'll supply the background audio  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nax2jwrCS3A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nax2jwrCS3A) from a fellow youtuber.
---
why so many random zooms?
---
Yeah it really comes down to can I farm 14 Essence of Water faster with fishing than I can farming 280g with lashers. If I do lashers 100% efficiently I'm looking at 40g an hour. So 7 hours of straight farming. Do you know the average Water per hour you'd get fishing these spots?
---
Also an elemental invasion? Was this confirmed? Haven't read anything on that. If that's the case Essence of Water prices may drop down to a more reasonable 10g.
---
I would love some pug meetings at work. Would be very productive I guess.
---
Phase 2 WPVP is working as intended, it's completely natural that the game is in an unplayable state right now.
---
You must be on the majority faction on your server, because I don't think you understand what it is like to corpse walk for a minimum of 45 minutes every single time you want to do a dungeon. I played on a PvP server in Vanilla, and it was nowhere near what I experience in Classic. Do I expect to die on a PvP server? Of course I do, but do I expect for the game to be nearly unplayable. HuR dUr SuCk It Up BeCaUsE bGs WiLl MaKe It BeTtEr... GTFOH.

I knew it was getting to me when my mom served my tendies last night and I couldn’t eat couldn’t even guzzle down the side of Mac and cheese.
---
That’s not the question if you can read, which obviously you can’t.
---
I’ve kind of been thinking about Mage some as I haven’t played mage much, my main does tailoring so I can keep the mage decently geared, and for food and water for the party. I know mages have arcane intellect so that would benefit the Shaman, any other mage buffs that will benefit?
---
Rogue is an interesting idea but also I played that back in the day. However, might be interesting to play a rogue again with more information and an adult mind instead of a teenagers LOL. Plus I could do daggers if I’m only going to be playing with them.
---
It is, it’s player vs player
---
What about going into Dungeons?
---
On the server I play: Lakeshire (EU) there are even more Alliance players however the horde is more pvp active so they are most of the time the first to start pvp at hillsbrad foothills.
---
My reply went to the wrong post then because the one I responded to did
---
I am all for changes as well, guards at FPs would be perfectly fine for me or other changes to help with it.  I am not in the #nochanges camp as I actually played vanilla and know the good and bad parts of it.
---
And while I am a bit surprised that is as common as it is, I am far from outraged and more just surprised at the amount of people excusing this as something they almost HAVE to do to gain honor.  I admitted this happened in vanilla, but will stand by my statement that it did not happen at the frequency nor did it happen for the lengths of time that it does now.  It's a PvP server and it's going to happen sometimes, but using it as your primary means of farming honor on horde or alliance just shows you're bad at PvP and good at abusing grey areas.  I also haven't been subbed to retail in probably 6 years so worst case I'll just roll another alt and wait until BGs come out.
---
only enable the module that runs a /who when click around in the world and not in interface and it should work.
---
"Entry level position, must have 5 years experience"
---
The problem isnt being carried or not being good enough/geared enough. The issue is in how io works. Even if you spend time learning them, the scoring on IO, you will still be exculded because you couldnt find people capable of doing the timed runs. Shit like IO is the gaming equivlent to cancer.
---
I would say that classic has just as much of a set finish line as any expansion...get the best gear then use it to be a beast in pvp or for bragging rights once pvp gear becomes cemented. Then it’s just having fun at endgame max gear.
---
Part of the reason daggers are so good is that you can used aged core leather gloves, muggers belt, or distracting dagger to get the same affect as Edgemasters without losing all of the stats from an item slot.
---
I ironically, if I were starting over today without friends to influence my decision, I’d roll on a PvE realm. Maybe I’d hate it once I actually tried it, but I’d at least give it a shot.
---
Didnt even have to click the link to know this was a horde issue. What is it about that playerbase that is so toxic to even their own faction
---
They haven't banned the addon though.
---
I play ally on Mankrik. I agree. Did not mean to make it sound bad or anything
---
Well, level 19 yes. As you go higher up the non-twinks have enough tools to be a bit more competitive.
---
"They banned it"
---
"Wrong"
---
"They banned a function from it"
---
Don't break your back moving those goalposts redditor that needs to be right
---
I never said that. The difference is that you'll have less 40 man gank deathballs, smaller group PvP. 6-10 horde vs 2-5 alliance is a much more manageable than getting starched with a chance to fight back.
---
It's on a respawn timer of "X-Y days" which starts when they die, not when they are looted
---
I was ganked a couple of lowbies in retail a month ago. It was funny how they brought 2 lvl 120s searching for me and I got away mostly. But in retail the pvp is opt in so they choose the reward and risk of world pvp.
---
I am on a PvE server so I am good.
---
it's a bug. there is no rule of thumb because it's inconsistent.....
---
you're saying people contending the world boss that is designed to be fought over is somehow unscrupulous? why wouldn't they try to deny the loot, its apart of the game
---
There are only 2 issues and as a new player they are pretty avoidable. The first is faction imbalance which makes it impossible to enjoy world pvp for either faction. And the second is the servers this time around have a max player cap far higher than vanilla wow, which makes most zones much busier.
---
But if you choose a faction balanced server phase 2 has made the game a thousand times more fun, since phase 2 I've completed all quests in ungoro, blasted lands, feralas and winterspring. Even though I was in the dreaded 48-59 lvl range I was barely hindered by pvp. Sure I had to do a few extra corpse runs when I got jumped or lost to a similar lvled player. But joining in on fights for important chokepoints has been a blast.
---
Try to tank dungeons on your warrior to grind the levels when you’re bored. Like in original post, warriors are hella fun at max level provided you have a good guild
---
It's a game that has a faction war as a component and people are "shitty" for participating in that conflict??
---
15 minute corpse runs into BRD. That would be so great compared to what I deal with everyday lol.
---
That's so cool, I've starting getting really into strat ud runs too at first just for the valor legs, but I'm really good at tanking them now so I kinda wanna keep going for the mount or the sword! 41minutes is my best time with a pug
---
Yeah, especially for rogues. I regularly hear a beep followed by "stealth player detected" while running around. Without the mod I could easily gank all the rogues who do that.
---
If you don't like your job, you should switch in the long term. I know, this is not always feasable..
---
Ok so I guess you also can't read so I'll explain it.
---
You asked if you get to 14 in two weeks will there be items. It doesn't matter, because the minimum time to get there is 12 weeks so as long as they are in by then, it doesn't matter whats in by week 2.
---
Let me know if you need that slowed down as well
---
Wasn't asking you
---
PvP stands for player vs player.
---
Vanilla still had negative armor from armor penetration. That didn't get removed until WotLK. If Classic doesn't model negative armor then it's not accurate to Vanilla. 
---
In other words, you can't ignore BRE's proc just because Sunder+CoR would reduce a mob to zero armor.
---
That matches my experience on an even server.
---
Horde players are constantly hungry for pvp, but alliance only go out when a big guild organized something.
---
it was nerfed, but where else are you going to grind as priest? it's still nice money and outside of open world
---
Raid consists of players though.
---
Same ally kirontos. Takes 30 min to get into BRD. I'm playing on pve servers till it calms down
---
As shadow priest i would consider blade of the New moon(+19 shadow dmg) + aquamentus
---
As it turns out, clearly communicating a common understanding is the key to no drama.
---
Some people choose to challenge themself to keep beating their personal bests and that requires showing up prepared. 
---
Also consider all the mages in the very same pre-raid gear, for example. What can they do to differentiate themself to secure a raid spot for the next tier? You don’t want to be the only mage not using a flask when the GM is looking at parses.
---
Im almost 57, so I say I should be 60 mid december, maybe earlier.
---
Is there an addon or tool online that lets you put in your gear and see detailed character stats?
---
I'm looking to figure out exactly how much spell hit &amp; crit I have, as well as seeing how much of my spellpower is general vs shadow only etc.
---
Haaaaaaa ok. thanks for clarifying.
---
Horde haven't seen frustration until you meet an organized Alliance group with Pallies healers. Frustration galore
---
Farming? This is what pvp is for you? Farming experience? This what its all about...a farming corpse camping experience. I am Private, with 31 kills on my way to MC.
---
I\[rogue\] just got my Devilsaur set at 55.  Any enchant recommendations I should invest in? Maybe Agility and Hit?  Or just throw some armor kits on there?
---
Nothanks.
---
Reck is so easy to counter (any form of cc), and you take 20% more damage while in it.
---
Also lining up a ss / reck / ww bomb is not easy. Usually you get stunlocked before you can pull anything like that off. This is a "stars aligned" type of moment, that many other classes have much more often.
---
They're probably highlighting something, like in the beginning it was showing the mage, then the lock etc. 
---
I'll have to think of some better way I could highlight things 🤔
---
You should save your gold towards an epic mount, and run strat live to get righteous orbs. Get crusader on your mirah's song, as even if you get both Dal'Rends - as soon as you get a raid weapon (Brutality Blade, or Viskag) the best setup will be using that in the main hand, and mirah's in the off-hand.
---
If the druid was able to skin the dragon, the loot had already been distributed.  If this even happened, all your druid did was die stealing 3-6 blue dragon scales from the horde.
---
It's a shitshow to farm for gold/materials too. Going to Felwood to farm Demonic Runes 6AM, got one then I saw a horde on SPY. Guess he saw me and alerted his friends because 3min later he came back with 2 other 60´s.  
---
My alt is low 50s and questing is impossible. Only way to level is either dungeons (good luck even getting to BRD without 10 corpseruns) or hide in Azshara/Northern part of Felwood.
---
This is absolutely not the case on the server I play. The world is full with players almost too full, because you have a hard time finding richt thorium nodes etc...
---
This is what mmos were back in the days, wow was considered quite a casual mmo and it was compared to its predecessors.
---
I used to play tibia where you lost, levels, skills and items upon death, the level of griefing in wow is not comparable. Thats the context you got to view classic in.
---
That being said, there is something fun about such a hostile unforgiving world, it gives accomplishments meaning and forces people to band together for cooperation, which generates it's own content.
---
No I’m saying that there are plenty of other games with similar systems and people find ways to make them fun without just grouping up as 30 people to gank solos.
---
Feels like i'm the only one not yet 60 so i can't find any groups
---
Of course cards aren't dropping yet.  The bosses that drop them aren't in the game yet.  The question is whether the item drops or not before the faire phase.  If it doesn't drop, there is far less reason to kill the boss and allow the elemental invasion.
---
I'm just adding that the faire content phase (patch IF you will) is obviously not a prerequisite for faire related drops.  However, the elemental invasion obviously is for the card simply because the drop is from the event boss.
---
I hope you are correctly understanding what I'm saying.
---
Imagine putting 'Must Read' on this...
---
You won't hit rank 14 in 2 weeks.
---
I accidentally rolled on an east coast sever while living on the west coast. Damn need impossible to find a guild with raid times that work for me.
---
I would kill for paid character transfers because I simply have invested too much to consider rerolling over this mistake.
---
Mmmmmm....ahhhh
---
I wish I made my wife start playing earlier.... She started maybe a month ago. When she started I just got my hunter to 60. We weren't sure if she would be into the game that much, but now she really loves playing it and wants to play whenever were at home or sitting around. So now instead of getting my hunter ready for raiding, I'm leveling an alt with her priest (my alt is a warrior). We've made it to lvl 30 so were half way there. I mean I'm not upset about it since it is very nice to do something together we both enjoy a lot. My problem is my brother is a 60 rogue and wants to run dungeons with me at the same time my wife wants to play with me also. So I'm in a sticky spot having to choose who I play with and make time for both.
---
Still dodging questions, you should be a politician. If you don’t know the answer just say so.
---
"well shit maurice"
---
I fail to understand why you would tho. Sartharion was not the entry raid, especially the hardmode version of it. I dont think  anyone even tried the hardmode immediately  when it first came out.
---
I have thought about this so much. I have played on a PvP server from Vanilla to Cata as Alliance, and always enjoyed the game. I was on Scilla, which had more Horde than Alliance. Classic is not as enjoyable on my current server.
---
Everyone transfered to another server?
---
A lot of people out in the world will switch to afking in capitals waiting for queue to pop.
---
Its a pain constantly traveling back and forth to battle master, so the world will get a lot emptier.
---
similar story
---
so i decided to log onto heartseeker where my gnome mage is. i transferd him over so i could get payback on the horde (zugtards xD lmao) so i go to gadzetgsn an i read on a forum (darknetweb u wouldnt know it) that u can basicaly avoid the guards LOL anyway after a long and difficult flight from themamore (this is where my gf jania lives) i statr spamming forstboalt on the HORDE and they run hahahahaha but they're 2 slow cause my frostbolt is 2 cold anyway i kill a few of them because i want them to know that this is what they signed up for when rolling pvp hhhhhahahaha my and my friends are all transferring over too so we can pwn some scrubs so i join a raid group (theres 6 raid groups but i decide to join the one to pwn some iDIOTS coming out of OGAYMAR and UNDERSHITTY with their PVP FLAGS LOL
---
easiest 200 honor of my life
---
i am the best
---
they should have known this is what pvp servers are all about
---
My honor tab doesn’t have “standing”.  Is that an add on?  Thanks
---
It doesn’t matter who has better racials, just be better at your class. I agree with the min/maxing thing. Also I remember ALWAYS getting stomped playing against alliance, maybe I was just bad?
---
The worst situation you can be in is a 1v3, where if I’m in meta gear I can win in that situation. In wow I can be in meta gear but no shot I beat a raid group.
---
I hear your point, luckily I stocked up on 600 fap's
---
love this movie
---
It's tacky.  People say, the only reason a tank runs strat live is for the orb.  Well the only reason the entire party is there for X item.  Orbs high competition so i don't mind 1 on res.  But all of them? Nah
---
In a game from a company supporting human rights atrocities. Not sure how your brain can separate the two- but mine can’t. 
---
But hey, hopefully those protestors are good at “pvp” too, you know, protestors v police?
---
100% less people are playing. Most of my guild has switched to raid logging or are on alts in uncontested zones. Hoping it jumps with battlegrounds release but it is very much turning into a ghost town.
---
hello my name is [wow player] and I am obligated to min/max my time and get to the top rank of pvp now. do you know who the fuck i am? i must have the best gear otherwise im worthless
---
Mmmmmm...ahhh
---
Cooked high level trash fish (yellowtail ect) gives 35 happiness per tick, think that is max. Combat log shows it.
---
Still can't read, you should get a tutor.
---
If there are no items, then yes you can't buy them. They need to put them in before the first players reach rank 14. Which is 12 weeks.
---
So if you hack the game and there before december then you won't be able to buy anything
---
Not everyone is a fair weather loser. Some people enjoy balance or even being the underdog.
---
Broken Broken Tooth
---
Other census data says it’s closer to 65/35.. the disparity in balance is further exacerbated by the fact that the side that is being dominated often doesn’t leave the cities now or doesn’t log on. So out in the real world, you’re seeing number waaaay worse than 65/35
---
Still more forgiving than dying in tibia
---
Yeah being the 40 in a 60/40 split realm is the best possible experience on a PvP realm imo. Problem is those kinds of ratios never last. I really feel for the people who’ve sunk days+ of playtime into the minority faction on 70/30 or worse realms.
---
why doesnt this enemy play exactly how i need them to so i win???
---
[Priest]
---
Any addon to show me a big alert/notification when I get Focused Casting?
---
I am thinking of rolling a warrior, and having difficulty deciding whether I'd prefer an Orc or Tauren. My focus is PVP because I think that the skill cap is ultimately higher there, so it should be the main concern when min-maxing.
---
Conventional wisdom says that Orcs have better PVP racials. But is that actually true? Intuitively, a good first approximation would be that we should view a stun and a resisted stun as equal in value, which implies that War Stomp is superior to Hardiness except when a warrior is taking four or more stuns a minute - and this actually overestimates Hardiness value, due to the diminishing returns mechanic on CC. Also, except for when fighting rogues, most cases in which a warrior would be taking four stuns a minute are those where War Stomp would hopefully be able to hit two enemies or more.
---
There is certainly value in being able to disrupt people's rotations via a resisted stun, but there's also value in having a highly reliable interrupt. Are Orcs overrated, then?
---
Weapon skill is very nice for flexibility in gearing, but in PVP I am unsure how much it matters. Having several good +hit pieces by endgame is inevitable, since it's stacked for PVE, so the main reason to take it would be to deal with +Defense gear from other players, which seems only very situationally important. Being able to hit them from farther away, however, due to Tauren hitboxes, seems absolutely amazing.
---
Are Tauren Warriors, and to a lesser degree Tauren Shamans, underrated relative to Orcs?
---
If there were a better ratio of alliance to horde then it would be easier to find alliance.
---
They are not. The largest population PvE NA realm is half the population of the largest population NA PvP server. So horde still vastly outnumber Alliance. You will see once BGs are out...
---
Check https://ironforge.pro/servers/ for population data. This is mostly LVL 60's who post logs so not entirely accurate but gives a general idea.
---
Ok so you got a better way to figure it out? I'm all ears!
---
Sry I was unclear perhaps in the title, I don't actually think reck shud be nerfed. It was just a title I added to a play I was proud of
---
It is against the rules, especially if spammed or the chat is abusive. However, under most circumstances they really don't care unless you're spamming, or being a bigot or something.
---
I believe you're correct.  This is the first time in my MMO history (started with UO) that I've rolled in a PvE server.  My guild is drooling for BG's and doing premades for WSG and AV.  Just hoping the AV app to help join as a 40 man raid is still working.
---
Morning crohns shitter checking in
---
I hear you. 
---
My point is that you could have done ONE clear, then held onto the instance and then done all your carrying by inviting any additional friends once the run was over.
---
Thank goodness you won't be doing anything quite so crazy (with such particular hurdles) in the future.
---
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?
---
That's the whole point? Why should someone brand new to the raid get mageblade over someone that has been working toward it for weeks/months?
---
You join a new guild and you have to work your way up. This is how life works.
---
PvP on pvp servers is fine. 
---
The problem is server populations being huge leading to near every zone being camped and unplayable.
---
I'm not sure how past you could possibly have gotten the first hand experience you have now that led you to where you are now.
---
Don't think of it as bad planning. You just made the decision you were able to make with the information you had at the time.
---
Wooooooww
---
Thats how most satire works.
---
Only with the [horde fishing pole from hinterlands](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19022/nat-pagles-extreme-angler-fc-5000) and aquadynamic I've never had a fish get away in bay. Have fished many hundreds of fish if not thousands. Wowhead has the cap listed at 425 for Bay for avoid getting away, which would seem to be the case with my experience. https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/best-fishing-pools-farming-locations-classic-wow
---
Surely you aren't missing that many with just 3 skill missing?
---
:(
---
Same, but I'm straight!
---
Uhhhh not true.. source: trying to get into BRM as alliance last night and the night before that
---
in other words "what about grinding until you almost reach the end game, but only experience a small franction of what you worked for a long time, because if you step out of line and put a foot in a non instanced zone you will get your ass kicked by the rest of the server population"
---
Personaly I knew from the start I wouldnt want to engage in this "rewarding" feature of the game and so I rolled on a PVE server from the start. Just for shit and giggles I decided to roll a new toon on a PVP server and see how long it would take for me to get ganked, and I couldnt even reach lvl 3 before I got a horde of ... horde players (I am so fucking smart with my play of words, I should get a fucking award)
---
Anyone who rolls on a PVP server should expect things like this.  It's part of the immersion.  PVE servers exist for people like you.
---
+7 Agi on the gloves, pants will require a Libram of Voracity (+8 Agi) which are expensive (just to craft the enchant costs 30g + mats, Voracity books are 40-50g each on my server).
---
Keep it up. You're right. Only horde players form gank squads. You caught 'em.
---
The grossness is both real and performative at the same time. His room is genuinely disgusting and would probably be like that even if he wasn’t a streamer. But he also cultivates and plays up the grossness because he knows it generates views and reactions. 
---
Not to get too deep, but no one who is recording and broadcasting themselves for hours every day is truly presenting the “real” them.
---
Yes but there won't ever be. You can't force people to do something they don't to do. Server sizes are something that can be controlled.
---
Yey
---
For everyone asking about server populations check https://ironforge.pro/servers/ it's not entirely accurate as it uses warcraftlogs data but gives a general idea about raiding population.
---
Thats what wpvp is, camping and ganking
---
About 1 hour to get inside, but yeah if everyone has time it works
---
I'm not sure why you have nomod in there.
---
/cancelform [help]
---
/cast [harm] Mind Blast; [help] Greater Heal
---
Try that.
---
Remember this date, fucking tragedy. She was so beautiful.
---
The faction war is a facade for story and PvP gameplay. People who take it to the point of griefing and severely disrupting other systems are, in fact, being shitty, yes. People take the conflict way too seriously/literally. It is actual other people on the other side trying to play and enjoy the game. And yes, that does mean spending all day camping people makes you shitty, too.
---
Can you elaborate on hunters in large-scale PVP? I don't think about large-scale PVP much.
---
its almost like youre saying that everyone must follow the arbitrary moral and honor code of each individual they are ganking.
---
To begin with, everyone will have the same EP, as long as you have the same people in the raid, then you just roll for it, it'll work better later on.
---
We have not had any drama on loot distribution yet, and we're currently doing 4 Ony and Mc raids each week (3 main and 1 alt/social members).
---
People will get items with different GP values, and then you'll start noticing the difference in the PR (Priority), should only take a couple raids.  
---
We used this system from vanilla through TBC, back in the days, and i can't remember any drama then either.
---
I have been first on PR amongst the mages for 2 weeks now, because no upgrades for me has dropped, obviously the mageblade dropped in our other 2 raids... :|
---
I want to believe this is just a parody of all the dumb posts about waiting on everyone who plays one hour a week to hit 60 to release the next raid because they're definitely going to be raiding a ton with that one hour a week play time... but I feel like it might be serious.
---
:o u again
---
Kinda reminds me of a chesty puller quote:
---
“We're surrounded. That simplifies the problem.” “They are in front of us, behind us, and we are flanked on both sides by an enemy that outnumbers us 29:1. They can't get away from us now!”
---
I'm pretty sure pets share the same agro radius as you. Go ahead and level it in instances as long as your group knows your pet DPS will be lacking a bit!
---
Disc priest is meta healer and spriest is the best 1v1 class.
---
My first experience ever in a PVP realm, some weeks ago : I arrive at redridge mountains with my lvl 15 1and decide to log off next to the flymaster. Got the count, and a about 3 seconds to disconnect my character is suddenly dead, and and orc level "skull" named "Udontseeme" is running in the background. Yehhh! ^^
---
Not even a single meals worth from a giant ass turtle?
---
Spelling seems fine, grammar not so good
---
Do you know what master loot is?
---
It’s funny that horde players all over don’t realize they’re just making sure they have less people to fight in PvP.
---
The one where Homer is teaching a class on building a successful marriage.
---
Not sure if they changed it or someone was typing it wrong but the other day some horde kept posting something like that and it wouldnt translate to anything.
---
I'm officer of a casual hardcore guild and yes, a lot of people are this stingy and petty about loot. Trials expecting to get loot after one raid, people ending friendships over items etc. We were these people out as I can't be bothered with people like this anymore, in too old and just want to chill and raid with people that don't suck at the game. Think we've gotten ridd og like 5 players due to stuff like this.
---
Yeah, you can play with them. Just check the box to load out of date addons and you’ll be fine.
---
He was a popular twitch streamer on his race to 60. His viewers have been steadily declining since that day. Once the race was over, people realized he's just not a very interesting person.
---
you can beat my pixels all you want
---
At some point people will start whining, cause rolls are totally random, and some will end up with getting more than others.
---
Sure, everyone has the same chance each time they roll, but we all know it won't distribute the loot perfectly between everyone the way a good dkp system works.
---
&gt;  If you didn't reroll you would still be contemplating switching constantly.
---
contemplating while in 8/8 is better than comtemlating while level 49.
---
tuesday is not raid night for firemaw EU, wednesday is
---
60/40 is about the best you can hope for balance wise.  So yeah, get good.
---
You guys realize that without strict population rules,you're not gonna have a 50/50 server, right?
---
That casual got what he deserved
---
Hmmm... I guess one option would be to delete ur account and play a different server? Shoulda xfered while u could have like the rest of em bro
---
and his guild is super tryhard AND they suck. So it's double funny.
---
So you don’t know the answer!
---
For PVP, stats are king. If you run out of health or mana, you probably lose the fight. Maxing out spellpower isn't really worth losing all the stamina/int required to do so. For aoe farming, aoe abilities have terrible scaling with spellpower (if you ever spec down holy for holy nova dire maul farming) so getting 5 extra casts is way better than increasing the damage by 5%.
---
For raids and better geared dungeon runs, spellpower is king. Every boss but Rag at this point dies before mana becomes a problem even with virtually 0 intellect on gear IF everyone is geared for streight up damage and using resource giving consumables.
---
Min-maxing dishonorable kills out here
---
grats
---
Thank you, this is a good idea.
---
I've noticed horde drop in cities as well, I think the lifers are leveling alts and then raid logging or out Wpvping. Not just alliance.
---
as someone who plays on both factions, i started heavy on alliance and have gradually swapped over.  both factions have crybabies, but team blue seems to be more populated with them
---
QQ I can't exploit!
---
Raids don't let you get quest drops and things like that unless it's a (Raid) quest.
---
And yet my bud was locked out of BRD last night by alliance when he was trying to get it. Both sides are doing the same shit.
---
Top tier guilds can already look at what their raid is wearing with raid logs. Not really sure what the target audience for this is.
---
Damn you are picky
---
Pretty sure OP is either trolling or mentally handicapped
---
No, you don't. You just have to be better and more knowledgeable  than the other warriors. As well as that, you see if you can lead secondary raids in bigger guilds.
---
We've had mageblade drop on all 3 kills we've done. This is for our guild's Group 2; Group 1 which cleared MC every week since week 2 hasn't seen one yet.
---
I know mage is considered a glass canon but my alt feels extremely squishy. Currently 28 and got seemingly one shot by a rogue’s ambush around the same level. I’ll pull a couple mobs to kite and aoe down but take a few hits and there goes 90% of my hp. I have fairly decent gear for my level too. Does it get better later on? Does ice barrier help a lot?
---
You just got used to it. Meanwhile mindless horde shitters on this sub are telling you that you shouldn’t have rolled on a PvP server if you didn’t want to PvP...
---
Asmon is smart and so is McConnel, they both know their chatter turns a “stream” into a “show” with banter and discussion. I’ve seen people label Asmon as “the arrogant one and McConnel as the down to earth one” while I don’t think that is totally wrong. I think they are just trying to do an interesting show, and will just say what they think is funny for the other to respond too. 
---
Also Asmon is the loud talking guy who is wrong a lot, that’s not an act. That’s why Mc is so funny because a lot of that banter between them is pretty genuine. If you listened to Asmon talking about how to make his guild great in his recent guild meeting, he does sound like a very immature and arrogant kid, one of his statements was that if you get unlucky in a raid you are out of the guild, meanwhile he never really runs raids with people to get them gear and has said straight up that he won’t because he is not GM to “Be friends with everyone” it was really cringe to hear, because you knew if McConnel was there and they were doing a show instead of a “meeting” it would have been a cool and interesting debate.
---
I am telling you that there are not enough Alliance on my server to control anything. I get a raid together and we fly/ride around taking back Menethil, Chillwind, Light's Hope, Thorium Point, and Morgan's Vigil. As soon as we take control of one of these, the Horde show up in Huge numbers and wipe us. At one point my SPY addon said there were 86 Horde at EPL FP. When we went out there with our 25ish man raid there were only about 20. Literally 5 minutes later there were 86. We finally get rez'd up and head to the next area and it is rinse and repeat. What do you suggest I do? I spam chat looking for more people to join up with us, but either they are not interested, or there are none.
---
 I have play on vanilla, had 3 lvl 60s on pvp realms and a lot of alts and never seens things like I see on twitch, comments and youtube. Yes we had some pvp, I remember I got ganked sometimes but nothing like 10 ppl roaming against us. Also I played on a balanced server as far as I know and it was high pop I think.
---
SO IT WOULD SEEM.
---
Thats not the question.
---
Was there. 
---
Alliance had it tagged, Horde got aggro with a holy priest but it was still Alliance tagged, and because of noob pug raid Horde didn't reset the fight.
---
Both factions DPSed it, major lag, and Azuregos died on that hill.
---
A Horde guild got blamed for pulling and burning it down, but aren't even visible on the meters. 
---
Everyone decides that if we did not get it, the Alliance won't either and camped the hill.
---
When the Horde saw a non-paladin had master looter, we camped despite us loosing a few people (2-3 hours is long). Alliance kept ressing as a group with paladins bubbling and healing the ML, but kept failing. 
---
Eventually they had a raid gather up and defeat us at 3:00 something.
---
I'd look into getting these.

Then there's Heartseeker that's 15% Horde. :D
---
Our loot council views preraid BIS gear the opposite way and will give raid loot priority to the members who are taking the time be the best they can entering the raids, as they are usually the more active members and also helping others farm dungeons for their gear as well.
---
What's funny is that as a priest who likes to heal dungeons, you won't even have to make running them a lot a goal. It'll happen to you by accident if you don't mind taking care of AOE groups, and it's very fast XP. I just hit 44, but basically up until 42 I was getting regular offers for SM lib/arms/cath AOE groups without even looking for them.
---
Came across an interesting argument the other day that once guilds can reliably clear all bosses they should actually start optimizing their PVE gearing and talents to shred through trash quickly - further bolstering the idea that a healer doubling as situational DPS is useful.
---
&gt;Now I'm forever broke.
---
a 60 hunter and forever broke?
---
It’s used to describe situations where someone gets no benefit from the situation other than pissing off other players. It’s definitely a term that’s been around since early mmo days like Everquest where people would just spawn camp low level mobs to keep new players from leveling.
---
It takes one horde 60 to kill an alliance. It takes 5 alliance 60s to kill 1 horde 50
---
Yea but if they drop BC, it all starts over again! And all that lvl 60 classic gear becomes out-classed by lvl 63 questing greens.
---
The Orcs, Undead, and Tauren collectively have better PvP racials than the Gnomes and Dwarves.  Hence, people preferring horde to PvP.
---
Their point is that cross-realm means that playing a dead server does not result in advantages for BGs.
---
Other way around champ.
---
 "Fun" is not a good reason to fuck over other people. Just look at prank channels who fuck people over in the name of a gag. They are considered assholes. Their "fun" did not validate their actions.
---
And ho is this good fun for? Very evidently a few people, but I doubt even the all of the people there, as they are acting as agents of their guild. I question how this is "fun" in the first place as well. Different strokes for different folks and all, but most of the "fun" here is from dickery.
---
Camping a guild with a massive mob to keep them from getting the fruits of their labor is just as much of a stomp as camping.
---
I assure you it works very well. 
---
You can jack your crit chance up super high if you're an orc since you don't need more as much hit
---
Sounds like they're referring to your desire to "keep your cake and eat it too," or change things that are tied to something else, without losing the something else, then complaining about how it isn't exactly what you want.
---
Noooo, BGs must not release this early!! The crybabies have already started rerolling and reddit posts are still just getting better and better!
---
Go roll Alliance on any PVP server other than Pagel, oh wait, that's not the PVP experience YOU want either is it?
---
Mouse over the trinket you want in your second trinket slot and the  right click :)
---
Possible I suppose but unlikely. Rabbits are everywhere!
---
Sounds to me like an incredibly negative viewpoint of OPs awesome experience.
---
what exactly are you trying to say?
---
Is quelserrar pointless on an orc? (Ignore the gold cost - main is a mage and it's unfair how much gold is generated just by being "there")
---
Anyways, my alt is a 55 orc warrior whom I plan on taking on. I've seen some Foror's running around for 300g or so, is it worth buying on an orc? Excluding annihilator, is the loss in +5 to axes using quelserrar and not using something like the bone-slicing hatchet or serathil make the weapon not worth it since you have to supplement so much more + hit gear? (I am also considering the beautification factor of quel)
---
TLDR: in a vacuum, is quelserrar not worth it as an orc over a blue 1h axe?
---
Fellow razorgore player here. It's even worse when you land at FP. The only time it's safe is when your faction is dominating the region.
---
You need to stealth well before the mountain and make sure you have no buffs apart from stealth. At least, I think that's how it works
---
I wouldn’t say redditors malding about quitting is indicative of a mass exodus
---
You just described a BG and not World PVP bud, there is a massive difference between being outnumbered 4-1 to playing better people.
---
go play classic's BGs. It will be fun, they've said.
---
&gt;  Horde queues would've been insanely long and some would have left for better quues but since it isn't server specific there's no difference between servers for queue times
---
Horde queues will still be very, very long. Theres like 2-3 PvP servers that are Alliance heavy
---
Rogues can also dodge Spy by staying stealthed, in which case Spy will only pick up on them if they’re right on top of their target.
---
Download questie and guidelime.  Pick a guide and follow it, this will help minimize frustration and maximize efficieny.  Just my $0.02 if immersion doesn't matter as much (well, you can still read quests, etc.).  Break up questing with just grinding mobs while jamming out or running instances.  I avoid instances in vanilla because they are inefficient (takes forever to get to the good ones as an Alliance).
---
Literally no one knows the answer to your stupid impossible hypothetical because we don't work at blizzard and we don't know when they are putting the items in. This should be obvious and should not have to be explained to you
---
Seems a bit passive
---
You’ll look like the opposite faction but your name tags will still be red and nothings fooling Spy, it will detect you as normal if not even easier because you’re buffed by the orb.
---
It would have the same amount of points. Tho your idea of maxims xp gain doesn't work that way. You pet will always stop gaining xp on your level. So if you get a lvl 19 pet, it won't get any xp until you hit 20 and so on.
---
Best advise is, to not bother about pet level at all. Just do your thing and use your pet, no matter what level.
---
Not really though but I have an addictive personality so I had to plan WoW Classic out a little bit. Game is boring rn because MC is a snoozefest and world PVP is a pointless AoE fest on a PVE server, which is actually fine by me because work is crazy! Probably gonna play a lot a lot when BGs come out
---
&gt;He made a human rights statement on par with “I wish for world peace” or “I wish no one would starve.”
---
Not even remotely the same thing. The way the contract is worded it essentially says "Don't be controversial on our dime". He was and that's how his contract was broken. Your comparisons are not valid because no one would disagree with those examples. It's like saying, "The sky is blue unless it's gray." Believe it or not, not every Chinese citizen agrees with the protests. It's only clear cut to us because most of us live in the western world.
---
And that's the fundamental disagreement. I view that as selfish and against what i want the game to be. So i think tools that allow people to be exclusionary and elitist aren't useful for the community at large.
---
If people want to be elitist in their guild runs and get crazy xp/hr and loot/hr and whatnot, fine by me. but keep that out of the public space.
---
It's literally just a model change, you still appear as the correct faction in unit frames, so as an attackable target, meaning spy, and anyone with half a brain will be able to see right through it
---
Thinking both factions don’t do the same thing lmao
---
You're not wrong, but I'd argue the problem here is all of the automation Blizz is trying to use for customer service, they let so many GMs go they no longer have staff for stuff like this, no one should be banned, or silenced by a bot.
---
These are 15 year old problems that were around back in the day during Vanilla. Some people will say no it wasn’t on my server but I’m here to tell you it was on mine, and it went both ways. BGs will help but it won’t be server bound like it was but by battle groups, and pretty much anyone going for Rank 13 or 14 will have premades anyways for WSG and Arathi Basin so they won’t have to deal with randoms in BGs which is why I’m hoping to find some folks to do premades with because F dealing with random people in Vanilla BGs,
---
anytime the horde out numbering the alliance on most pvp servers is mentioned:
---
"b..but heartseeker guys!"
---
Blizzard does not want to lose money.
---
Hi!
---
Shadow priest pvp question. How does shadow fair later on in pvp (wpvp bgs duels)when people start getting into T2 T3? Saw that shadow had poor spell coefficients compared to say locks.
---
I'm never going to have the time for naxx. Just curious if sp really falls off later
---
the entire point of this boss is to contest and PVP around it ...
---
its not some quest that everyone needs its a luxury you earn
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
&gt;There are tons of games where the pvp system is based entirely on players respecting each other and looking for fair fights. [...] Dark Souls come to mind, where you emote at someone to ask if the other player is ready to duel, then you both get a 1v1.
---
Ayylmao
---
&gt;It doesn’t matter who has better racials
---
It does when you're trying to attain faction balance. Whichever has the better racials will be slightly favored in population.
---
They are in the game... soooo, yea...
---
It’s such a ridiculous argument. If I order a hamburger with mustard and I get a plate containing a slider and then before I can pick it up a dump truck backs up and pours a hundred gallons of mustard onto it, that’s a reason to complain. Blizzard really should’ve stepped in and done something to address faction imbalance much earlier than they did. 
---
Admittedly, I rolled PvE because I like my PvP constrained to BGs and Dire Maul arena. But I have nothing but sympathy for people who like world PvP and now find themselves *massively* outnumbered and basically unable to play at all.
---
You chose guildies over real friends what the fuckkk you’re the problem
---
NOM NOM NOM
---
what on earth would you do for 15 hours a day in classic unless you are ranking? apes don't do splitruns or anything of the sort.
---
jesus christ...
---
Awesome, thank you very much u/hunterquestions42069
---
There's a lot of reasons to be in a guild. I have no intention of qualifying to be in a guild that has a realistic chance of taking down a world boss.
---
Too much work, most of my friends aren't hardcore enough to come with. In the end I play for my friends more than I play for self gain.
---
You don’t see it as pay to win? 
---
Your options are “pay to transfer or quit”
---
Lol yikes. The classic “some of us have lives”
---
Imagine playing world of Warcraft and complaining you can’t play more because you have a life. Yea. That realllly puts you up on that high horse.
---
Bruh have yu seen the video "What is asmongold was a raid boss?" the trash in his room came as a mechanic lol
---
I'm sorry everyone here seems to be basically telling you to shut up and color, but I think the point is that we don't actually know how dead "dead" servers are.  Medium pop realms in Classic are as populated as vanilla realms so I think thats the source of you being picky.  Without blizzard locking new character creation by faction on larger servers we can't get an accurate picture of how populated a realm is, especially considering balance.
---
That's what u get for speccing spirit of redemption. You have lightwell too, don't ya?
---
You are making the same problem as everyone else and assuming that scaling down the horde doesn't scale down the alliance.  You would have to be like 25% of a person!
---
If they have a 40 person raid, then you should be able to either form a group of your own.  If you don't want to form a group of your own, then you are simply being mad the other people are playing their MMO as a community and paying out in the world while you want to play your single player game.
---
This is the exact fucking shit I heard for YEARS about retail.  No one is out in the world acting like a community!  Now people are bitching because they are getting ganked by people out in the world as a community!  People trying to play alone are mad that others are outnumbering them, but don't want to put in the effort to form their own groups.
---
You want to just go point to point with minimal interaction with anyone.  Yo don't want to have to form groups on your own to overcome obstacles, simply able to avoid them yourself or have a group assembled for you.  The argument is what most people say when bitching about retail.
---
Probably the CEO of papa John's
---
And both, peacemaker and barbarous blade are A LOT better for hunters than the IBS. We have no use for strength, which statpoints were wasted on. The agility is worth just slightly more than the two suggested alternatives and stamina is barely enough to tank an extra hit in both, pve and pvp.
---
At the same time you can pick bloodseeker at 51 and roll with it as a pre-raid bis.  
---
If you really believe 21 agi are that valueable, i think you should reread your guides and sim.
---
Winterspring can be good when you get away from Everlook. I love battles on the bridge down south.
---
I think it gets worse the higher you get, but there is definitely more PVP activity even in low level contested zones.
---
Yesterday on Incindius there was a twink 19 rogue running about being shielded and healed by a skull level priest just having his way with poorly geared teens level players.  I don't know if he was getting anything from that or not other than sadistic glee.
---
I don't know why Redridge is contested.  Horde don't even have anything to do there.  IMO Ellwyn, Westfall, Redridge, and Darkshire should all be Alliance.  That's basically what Barrens is: one giant leveling zone up to 30.
---
Yeah, and people back then didn't have BGs either. BGs are going to have a massive impact on both people who actually want honor and those that just want to PVP. It won't stop grieifers, but again, your idea that a more balanced server will magically stop corpse campers is misguided. It happens everywhere, including on my seemingly well balanced one. I should know, I've camped and been camped enough myself. It's just the game.
---
Yeah this should work. I can remember leveling up a pet, back in tbc and I killed low level mobs to do so.
---
It’s more that the PvE servers are much more strongly skewed toward Alliance than the PvP servers are towards Horde. The average on PvE is at least 75% Alliance where the average PvP is closer to 60% Horde, so you need fewer servers to close the gap.
---
Let me guess, horde player? =))
---
If you truly cared about your time, you wouldn't be playing WoW. Nice attempt at grabbing the high ground though, but turns out you're a fucking nerd like the rest of us.
---
TBH GDPR doesn't apply to anyone outside of the EU so I doubt anyone really cares.
---
and as a result your rank means absolutely nothing, nice try trying to justifying your choices rolling on a pve server (aka remove half of the game) though and flexing on others. Or actually, more in general, everything you do on your server is meaningless.
---
Dude, I’m gonna tell you right now you only have one good option.  Reroll on a balanced realm and transfer your character over once paid transfers are available.
---
Your other two options suck.  Stay and be farmed forever and never see a world boss.  Or quit.
---
Just reroll and forget about it.  You’ll be much happier when you cut off all that baggage.
---
You can't force people to pay for a game so they can be farmed by other players, either they will re-roll away or they will quit. People like yourself defending turning entire servers into alliance no go zones are doing nothing but shooting yourselves in the foot come BG's and AQ event because you will be the ones sitting there crying about how its not fair you have to wait, and why is the server dead?
---
Your response is legit making it impossible for me to reply on mobile. Due to the length i can't see what I'm typing.  I will respond after im done with work.
---
No exploit here. This is classic kiting. Slow the mobs. Stay out of their range. Run away. Rinse and repeat.
---
&gt; I really see this post so often
---
That's because it's a common response to all the whining about player attacking them on pvp servers. It's sorta like when people buy a house next to an airport and complain about airplane noise. 
---
&gt; ganking a solo player as a 30 man raid group isn’t fucking pvp right
---
Is it a player attacking another player? Then it is pvp, whether you like to admit it or not. That you don't like any imbalance is beyond irrelevant. It's still players versus other players. That's *literally* what the acronym stands for.
---
Just learned to craft these on an alt and the first thing I did was send one over to my rogue.
---
True, had a rogue baby rage at me on a different account after he ran away from me in a fight claiming "Hunter pets are bugged and they attack through stealth and that if I actually believed it was possible that a hunter could beat a rogue then I'm even dumber than I look." I then proceeded to kill him about 7 times 1v1 until he rage quit.
---
On pagle horde we're outnumbered 4 to 1, org is being raided literally all day. Hs to org for insta pvp! Nice change.
---
When you jump in lava, you still need to reach the npc, it will take you 2 more deaths just to talk or jump through the window next to him. If you turn right as soon as you enter the mountain and jump right where bridge starts, you will be insta zoned in, since that whole area around the npc room is an invisible portal.
---
Are there websites that list the server populations? All these posts that make these claims are just confirmation bias and I don’t see the point of speculating if we can just look the info up somewhere?
---
What? It's nearly pointless/inefficient to quest till 60 anyway, if you're gonna be camping BRD/LBRS/UBRS for gear you might as well be getting in there ASAP and grinding items before you get 60. It's not a small part of the endgame, it's that you can get started on raid prebis early and it's what takes up your time at 60 before raids
---
This is pretty pathetic. It’s just a game dude.
---
I do a dungeon every once in awhile but I found the best way to level is by questing in peace without having to worry about getting ganked.
---
Trap the dog, then run off kiting simone around the lake. When the dog comes you can just kite them both at the same time.
---
Undead can use their racial ability to cleanse and become immune to fear for a few seconds.
---
quick hunter pet question, i just got a wind serpent at lvl 34, should i teach it bite or only use lightning breath and growl? (don't have dive yet)
---
VanCleef
---
I would suggest hunters, because they are unlike any other class. If mages seem *meh* for you, lock might not be your choice
---
Ice barrier helps a lot. Yea if you run into a rogue that is dagger spec (i.e. ambush / backstab) they can probably 1-2 shot you.  If you are aoe leveling you def. don't want the mob-glob catching you.
---
Enhance can pull pretty good aoe numbers on trash and in dungeons. Magma totem and fire nova are actually decent. Toss in some grenades and you do just fine.
---
I did this all the way through BRD, this is 100% the most effective way to get threat on more than 2 mobs unquestionably.
---
I like how he shoots a double barrel three times
---

Are the PvP ranks separated by faction? I mean, does Alliance compete with horde to R14? And through what I´ve seen some ppl from PvE servers say, it looks a looot easier to reach higher ranks on those servers, is that so?
---
*laughs is druid*
---
I was leveling my pally while waiting for a UBRS to finish, I saw maybe 10 fresh rogues. lol. We're still around, just rerolling rogues. lol.
---
Well, don’t comment on something that you don’t know the answer to and this wouldn’t happen to you.
---
PvE server players are becoming like vegans
---
I do this shit on stalagg. It's super fun, some of the best wow PvP! You get a bunch of honour and then eventually are hunted by a ton of people and it becomes a game to try and evade them and restealth haha. Love it!
---
should have been in at launch
---
Fucking someone over is running mobs to them and trying to get them aggroed to kill them.   This is a PvP server.  Some things are fun, if that's the server you joined.
---
i leveled Eng after relearning it for Goblin in a day for about 100-125g, but i had some mats in the bank, not an insane amount or anything but did help me save some g instead of buying from the AH
---
Raidlogging on Wednesdays and Onyxia days. Leveling a Horde Hunter on another server. I'll try get to 60 by the time BG's release, if it's still a shitshow by then I might just reroll and play horde.
---
Yup, that part is the exploit.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3182/spiders-silk
---
1. You don’t get experience or levels from bgs in classic
---
2. You should learn how the honor system works in classic
---
3. Cross server bgs, you are wasting your time
---
4. If you wanted to just pve, you should have chosen a pve server. You’re also delusional to think all alliance only want to pve
---
This is what yall on those pvp servers wanted. You could have seen this coming.
---
I'm not justifying blizzard's decision but this right here is why personal loot became a thing
---
When I say finished I just mean getting to 60.
---
The fact that he tries to blame a faction proves your point lmao
---
I use ISboxer!! https://isboxer.com/
---
I like to grind them out, because I get to have more XP/levels and the other quests go by faster. A lot of guides have you grinding mobs when you hit certain levels or spots in your leveling path, so you'll want to grind anyway. Better do the grinding when you've got a quest for it imo.
---
Hmm I don't think so. Did you make pvp last week and got a rank?
---
Oh yeah I read about that. I hope you are right as well!
---
Rp servers is where it is at
---
Hunters have the longest range - do consistent burst damage, have high hp and armor values (so they're not juicy rogue targets) and lots of utility (feign death + drink/eat) etc.
---
Hunters will be top damage in 80% of BG's they enter just due to the nature of the class, the more people that are in the BG the more chaotic the battles get and more hunters excel.
---
It was a surprisingly decent movie tbh.
---
peacemaker and barbarous blade ARE better, but they're dependent upon RNG. the IBS is guaranteed. don't underestimate the value of the +sta on the icy barbed spear either; its some nice padding in both pvp and in MC for heavy raid damage fights (your healers will thank you).
---
the gorewood bow i suggested is a guaranteed quest reward for maybe a 2 min fight (although could be 15-30 min to get a group). 
---
now, that all said... the crossbow hits harder thanks to giving you more crit, and its DPS curve is very favorable in shorter fights. 
---
Your final point about getting a great end game weapon at 51 *is* very valid. Most of the population hitting AV will be going in at 60 and really picking based on what gear they've been unlucky with; for a leveling hunter the crossbow will be the obvious choice.
---
I started lasher farming after leveling my herb over the weekend. I've made ~700g in a few days of farming. From my perspective, the gold farm is amazing. I've never had over 100g and now I'm rich! My epic mount, truefaith, eye of shadow and hide are all within my reach now
---
Everyone rolls horde.
---
Now who is your raid group going to kill so you get honor?
---
Yes, and besides I don't smoke and drink so I've got that going for me, which is nice. :p
---
I did not say incendius was worse. I said it was worse "at the moment" that I ragelogged. Biiiiiig difference
---
I don’t. Thanks for rubbing that in.
---
I do, why? Is it because I'm not one of those: "I have 8 kids, 12 wives, 7 husbands, 10 cars, 6 mortgages, and work 700 hours a week. I can only play for 10 minutes every 4 months." type of people?
---
Sword of Omen vs Vanquishers sword for (arms) warrior tanking at 40?
---
Will be using the Aegis of the Scarlet Commander as the shield, and probably slapping a fiery enchant on it to boot. Vanquishers seems really good for threat, but the stats on Omen seem good as well.
---
Leveling as arms and have been tanking most dungeons with the WW axe, but finally starting to feel the hurt a lot more. Just looking for a good set to slap on when I need to be soaking hits. Thanks!
---
cool thats what i figured and honestly i like the aesthetics of carrying a staff much more than a one hander+off hand
---
Some addons are slow to update.
---
Some are slow to push updates to curse/twitch/WoWI or whatever platform they don't prefer.
---
Usually just click load out of date, and run the session with them, Then track down updates and the end of the day.
---
Other than high dps being a glass cannon single target with no form of AOE and little CC ain’t easy. Vanish mechanic is in a tough spot right now and doesn’t work a good amount of the time resulting in death when trying to solo farm.
---
Can you link a guide for the one clicks?
---
Everyone that streams https://www.twitch.tv/team/apes has multiple BiS 60s from what I've seen. Maitoz has a rogue, Monkeynews has multiple warriors, Tribe has a mage, etc.
---
I don't know if you can use keybinds for Itemrack, but as u/Spijker84 said, you can just make a macro to use the item in a certain item slot. Put that macro in your action bar and keybind that. u/Wtbmoonwalking
---
Slot 1 = head, 2 = neck, 3 = shoulder, 4 = shirt, 5 = chest, 6 = waist, 7 = legs, 8 = feet, 9 = wrist, 10 = hands, 11 = top finger, 12 = bottom finger, 13 = top trinket, 14 = bottom trinket, 15 = back, 16 = main hand, 17 = off hand, 18 = ranged, 19 = tabard.
---
    #showtooltip  
---
/use 17
---
That would be the macro to use your off hand. Other useful ones are /use 1 (Engineering helmets), /use 8 (Engineering boots) and especially /use 13 (top trinket) and /use 14 (bottom trinket).
---
I haven't played the game for 5+ years, but seem to remember that transfering or mailing large amounts of gold could result in bad things back then.
---
My point was never saying how good I was. The honor system doesn't reflect this at all. Even a rank 14 can be bad in pvp but simply invested a lot of time.
---
My point was to show how much less time you have to invest in order to rank on a PVE server.
---
So is the issue "players can see that I've stealthed even if they haven't seen me yet" or is it "spy has an audible alarm"? Because it feels like you're moving the goalposts.
---
You're an idiot if you think resource denial is toxic on a pvp game that is 2 factions and named fucking WARCRAFT. 
---
Ya good thing man, all thr pointless comments like yours changed the game into something people dont even want to play.
---
And yet 9/15 top raiding guilds on the server are alliance and we just got a world boss kill last night despite being outnumbered so badly.  The people transferring away from Skeram are the cowards who cant handle a bit of adversity.  The remaining alliance population has been distilled down to above-average players who aren't afraid of a challenge and have the mental fortitude to persevere through such ungavorable conditions, and I think we are stronger and more united as a faction because of it.
---
What are the odds that alliance seriously has instant queues?  Almost worth leveling a new main for that.
---
I think the phrase you are looking for is.. "Bye Felicia"
---
I don't think you could be more of a stereotype with this response.
---
PS I play horde on a horde dominated pvp server, lmao.
---
Not while leveling, tho. Level 60 of course, but if you are 37 and your pet is 36 it doesn't really matter
---
Im a human mage 37. I am specced all in frost at the moment. I'm trying to xp, single and aoe, and I'm constantly ganked. It doesn't matter how many or what class the horde is. I can't seem to do shit. I can't get away once I'm in melee range, and I can't do anything about getting feared. If it is one person, I have a good chance of running away. But 2+ means I'll die. 
---
What am I supposed to do for pvp? I don't think I can stand my ground at all.
---
Same here. Night elf Druid. I have furtivity which can be useful too
---
Yes you can force them. In fps games they have autobalance for teams. They have matchmaking.
---
Those kind of philosophies can be put into wow servers. Like they should have but its too late now.
---
Keep herbalism, it's a good source of revenue when you need it or are farming for supplementary income.
---
Robe of the void is certainly good, but it's not as much of a "must have" like mage or priest robes are. If you don't mind the effort it takes to get, go for it.  Put +4 to stats on it.
---
If you want to be good at pvp, there's no substitute for googling "wow classic warlock pvp guide" and watching hours of guides and pvp. Being good at pvp requires you to not only learn your own class, but also every class you might face in detail, and then getting loads of practice. After you do tailoring and get your robe of the void, engineering is a huge help for pvp as well.
---
You ignored all of his valid points about the combat log just to say "the reason to use it is because you can"? Yes everyone can use Spy, however, it affects certain classes disproportionately than others and has completely removed any sort of hiding as a non stealth class. I dont even understand how people can argue FOR spy when spy gives a distinct instant advantage over using the combat log, which is everyone's main defense about spy
---
Thing is since p2 its not even bis for huntards
---
Level 23 gnome warrior.
---
Love this server.
---
 I come across horde quite a bit. This will eventually be the most balance server
---
\*Jimmy John's.
---
Ah, the skepticism troll emerges. 
---
Unfortunately, “free Hong Kong” continues to be a non political statement, despite your assertion otherwise. 
---
This is the heart of the problem. China is getting a pass for putting this pressure on Blizzard. You’re not even acknowledging that, that pressure is there. If Blizzard didn’t react at all, this never would have been a story. It’s a hearthstone tournament. That’s a low ratings event. Blizzard had to punish them, in accordance with China’s political wishes. 
---
Blitzchung didn’t create controversy here. China’s demands of Blizzard did. This is why Blitzchung didn’t violate his contract.
---
Oh, and brilliant deflection with the out of context Apple joke. Let’s stay focused here though.
---
hahahah alliance sucks
---
There were SO MANY ways to get accurate info in vanilla, wtf are you talking about.
---
I was visiting like two dozen forums.
---
That solves this problem but creates a huge one of pissing off everyone who wants a pvp server.
---
&gt; So, it's kinda an issue if their play time is limited.
---
Which was never specified, which is why I didn't bother to address that. If you don't have free time, then my OP obviously doesn't apply to you.
---
Honestly, wouldn't mind Reck, Wall, and Retal being nerfed..to..
---
* Wall: 5 min CD, Reduce 25% damage
---
* Reck: 5 min CD, Auto crit for 5 seconds
---
* Retal: 5 min CD, retaliate for 25% weapon damage for 15 seconds
---
Basically, I hate these really cool abilities being on such a long CD; that you pretty much use them once per **login**.
---
Obviously, not in Classic....but just one of those wishful things.
---
Finally, that battle log report...jesus christ. Just picture it in your head reading the text. ...pretty much this: [https://tenor.com/view/stickman-fight-wrecked-ninja-gif-12517355](https://tenor.com/view/stickman-fight-wrecked-ninja-gif-12517355)
---
Deleted all comments yikes
---
Free action potion pretty much counters Frost Mages and Druids at least long enough for me to burst them down. Druids can be a bit more tricky with healing and bear form.
---
PvP Trinket is useful for Warlocks. You’ll eat a deathcoil but trinket will break charm or fear (I’m Orc, not UD) and any subsequent fears you can kicked or gouged. If I get the opening on a Lock I can pretty much kill them outright if they don’t have a succubus to charm.
---
I’m not super afraid of other Rogues 1v1 as an Orc. Though against a human they’ll get the opener almost every time.
---
Warriors it just depends, you have to deadzone kite them if not you’re just rolling the dice in dodging and getting overpowered. I’m also PVE combat daggers so kiting isn’t that bad, run in backstab a couple times, gouge and try to bait his enrage, kite, go back in when at full energy.
---
Shadow Priests are just the worst and most of them are Dwarves so Blind is useless.
---
Hunters obviously hard counter Rogues and can kite indefinitely if they want to.
---
Yes Jimmy John's my bad
---
Even as horde on Skeram (one of the worst faction imbalances) I was ganked 20-30 times in 2 hours in WPL. I was tired of doing BRD and tried questing for a bit.
---
Wow is not a mobs lmfao
---
The issue with spy is that it isn't realistic to parse through the combat log while actively doing other things.  What it negates is the information advantage stealth gives to other players.  If am I rogue, I know I am there but the opponent doesn't.  Spy greatly reduces this by pulling information from the log which isn't realistic for someone to do.
---
DBM also gives the player far better information than they should on their own.  The primary difference is DBM doesn't work against other players.
---
If I am playing golf by myself and I fuck up a shot, I'll probably just drop a new ball to play.  If I am playing with someone I wouldn't do it.  It's not out of shame, it's because playing "against" someone is different than playing alone.
---
&gt; pvm
---
Players vs Meters? Excellent take!
---
I’m no changes. As a rogue I have picked up the addon myself. 
---
It is pretty drastic but it isn’t THAT game changing. 
---
I don’t need an addon to tell me that a rogue is near me when I’m in 90% of the zones I go to. That’s always a given. The only thing that is strong, in my opinion, is it alerting you to raid groups before they load in.
---
Im horde in Blameaux, it says 50 50 basically but it feels like alliance has majority. Died six times going from Kargarth to Flamecrest in Burning Steppes and then died again when three ally dropped down from top of cave mouth when i went to fly away..gadget is owned by ally and same with winterspring usually. I love PVP server but i hate the constant haha i killed you haha i killled you again haha i killed you again damn you got into the instance. Its annoying as fuck.
---
Rofl
---
I did.
---
It's nice having the ability to spend my free time doing things I enjoy, sorry to hear about your situation.
---
But its not just reddit. My guild has been reduced to 1/10th of what it was (i left when around half of the guild already quit) is what I am hearing from the last friend I have that is still playing
---
Judging by my gold, Naxx raids me.
---
Das hot
---
Because AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
I sell rc on the AH for 1.5g on my server for 2 hours and I’ve never had it not sell.
---
Why not look for 6 alliance? Are you the only one logged in right now?
---
My guild has been decimated on Grobbulus. They came to Grobb because our RP core really wanted to pvp. But the core consists of 10 people, half of whom have already moved on. 
---
So now 27 people who didnt want to pvp are not logging on.
---
We have no tanks. I am the last healer. 
---
All the rogues and mages are still playing.
---
They dont owe you or your server shit.
---
Since your other q was answered, I just want to add: Pick up songstone of ironforge, it's a quest reward from completing BRD and much better than band of the unicorn
---
Well, to be fair there will be less and less wpvp every single day from here on out. 
---
Ofc, the internet is full of irrational pussies who scream and cry every chance they get, stomping their feet until daddy blizzard steps in and makes the game more casual friendly, sending the game into a downward, decade-long spiral that results in Battle for Azeroth.
---
If only hindsight were 20/20....
---
Haha thank you. After I posted the comment this occurred to me
---
polymorph and pray
---
the true answer us you don't, you just die. make dungeons your friend, imo
---
What do you want with this post
---
I think you're looking for "daft" as daff is a noun?
---
It totally depends on the server. Most of the salt is coming from the Ultra-High-Pop 80% Horde 20% Alliance garbage servers.
---
They have disabled the ability to census since Sept 15th. There are no updated accurate numbers since then.
---
Thank you, I'll be sure to check it out!
---
Currently in a group of friends that just started and want to run dungeons together.  We are in a bit of a bind though now that we are closing in on dungeon level. 
---
 I'm currently playing paladin and the rest of our team is druid, lock, rogue, mage.  I wanted to run Holy spec.  But our group was under the impression that I would tank and the druid would heal.  I don't want to ask the druid to tank as he was our tank in retail, but I know pallys are the worst tanks due to the lack of taunts.  Should switch up to warrior to tank?  Or is there a build where I can spec holy and prot?
---
Tell me what happend later
---
As someone who used the internet in '04-06, we used the internet pretty much the same way. Main difference was good info was in forums, not discords.
---
You'd have a better point if you were talking about 80s-90s internet.
---
Sure but I want to camp them first.
---
CALL THE POLICE
---
Thanks for your reply. I have a couple of quick questions. Do you suggest walking around with my Voidwalker out to protect against Rogues? I was thinking that roaming with my Felhunter would be good for going up against casters for the interrupt and eating spells. 
---
I've also seen a bit about avoiding casting Deathcoil immediately for fear of shadow reflection. Is that something that is actually that common, or should I chalk it up to getting got when that happens?
---
I'm a 57 druid on PvE also and I only have first aid. Been leveling pretty fast with no downtime. I rarely bandage unless I pull an extra mob or something.
---
Guess so
---
Yeah with the amount of time I have to play I think I’ll be better off focusing on a single char for now. Thanks for your input.
---
I too can play street fighter and get a 1v1 everytime.
---
Yes you fucked up
---
Should work. You can filter your combat log with like 20 options in the chat settings. They are already categorized, should be doable to ban only some of them.
---
This is clearly an advertisement for your website.
---
&gt;I do
---
I don't actually believe you, if you think it's possible to level to 60 in 20 days while holding down a job. 10 days /played is 12 hours a day. *12 hours*.
---
If u aoe farm tolvl u can make 100g befor lvl 40 
---
If u dont aoe farm i would look into it 
---
Swifttalon#1285is my btag if u need any info
---
It's a 24 hour mute and usually only if your message has profanity.
---
Just get away from the road man. Reduces probability of encounters like this a lot.
---
You seem fun
---
I just like to sap them, /wave, then run away.
---
So then Patrick Swayze yells, tackles the guy off the motorcycle, "Arrghhh"!
---
Thanks, appreciate it.
---
55/45 from my understanding
---
NO CHANGES remember !!!
---
I'd switch to a PST PVE server and probably finally give Alliance a go. However, my hangup is that I kind of hate all of the alliance cities.
---
Death coil is a 3 second horrify. Corruption, CoA, Siphon life, and then fear will require 6 seconds, ignoring the GCD triggered from death coil. There's no way to cast all those spells and have them feared as soon as they get out of the death coil fear. If you try and put all those dots up before fearing, they will have a 3-4.5 second window to respond before getting feared.
---
Yep, tho you dont need 6.7k mana. I'm at 6.2k and run through it fine, I just dont double pull. If you alternate between PI and Inner Focus pulls you move really smoothly through it.
---
Faction matters because of accessibility, proximity to towns/flight masters, and quests available.
---
Save it for AQ40
---
I personally use that + band of the unicorn, because I don't need the mp5 with greater mana pots, gems, celestial orb, and robes, and unicorn is more dps than 1% crit, but you have a calculator to figure that out for yourself
---
We used to clear in 5-6 minute zergs. It was a sad state of AV in 1.12
---
Nope, try again. 
---
I meant exactly what I said.
---
That's a very good way to look at it!
---
I keep moaning suggestively, but I think it is just encouraging them.
---
I unsubbed a month ago, and still browse and comment
---
No one cares you got killed a couple times as the dominant faction. Roll Alliance or stfu.
---
If you're rolling 1v1, you have a 50.00% chance of winning.
---
If you roll 1,000,000 times, you'll break even.  
---
In short, this is a complete waste of time.  Go farm some stuff.
---
&gt; I think quite a bit of people took the xfer to heartseeker
---
This is definitely part of it. I'm alliance on Heartseeker and the Horde levels are dramatically higher than they were a month ago
---
Not sure as it was randoms following us, i would say around 10 more people, we were probably equal numbers or horde had a few more, but its always to see people panic and not even try for 1 kill
---
Whaddya mean?
---
Ahah same
---
Nice projection, but I dont care about bgs.
---
And being a whiney bitch seems to be an alliance racial so I should be okay
---
Not true. The 70 bracket was poppin.  I spent pretty much all of cataclysm playing there.
---
Yes, only Horde does this. I've never seen allies do this ever. They are innocent, fragile girls just trying to farm gold and mats.
---
Oh let go of your pearls. Here's a secret: Blizzard doesn't give two shits about what Reddit thinks. The reason you're seeing changes is because Blizzard is doing what they need to keep their investment in check. We're already getting reports of Alliance seeing less and less players everyday in the major capital cities thanks to phase 2. Keeping WPVP the shit show it is for more than a few months would absolutely kill subscriptions.
---
I went on Tinder Classic when I was a low level and didn't know any better. I met this chick and ended up fooling around with her a few times. On our fourth date, she told me how she's married and she was going to tell her husband if I didn't pay for her epic mount. I ended up having to murder her and frame some nearby quillboars to cover my tracks.
---
The worst part about the pvp right now is Spy. When you have to download an addon so you WONT be at a disadvantage you know it needs to be gone.
---
I have a large group of friends on Grob, and the 50/50 ratio here makes it very playable, just a little slower than it could be sometimes. I’ll keep your recommendation in mind when I roll my Alliance alt though :)
---
This post is written by a Horde player behind the website listed.
---
Turns out leveling by only RP walking everywhere and spending 9 hours per day on training herbalism isn't the only way to AcTuAlLy EnJoY tHe GaMe and people have fun in different ways. Neat!
---
Sameeee
---
That Psycho barking old man ending was classic.
---
Do you like killing everything except warriors? Or do you like specifically killing melee ?
---
First time wow player currently at lvl 59 with warlock. 
---
Ive only ran SM Dungeon 25 lvls ago and haven't done any of the high level ones. I can't seem to find groups at this level (BRD, Scholo, Strat). I message the person that's LFG saying I haven't run it before and they don't invite me. And I tried keeping it a secret once and I said I need help entering Dungeon since I didn't know how and they just kicked me. 
---
What do I do at this point? Am I just unlucky? 
---
Other question is, I'm mostly going to just run BGs. Can I get good gear without raiding? I still have level 35 - 40 gear as a lvl 59
---
The standard WPVP pet is succubus for charm, which you can use to get off an easy fear. You're right about the voidwalker for rogues and felhunter for casters, but you generally won't be able to pick who you engage with in WPVP, so the succubus is probably the best all around pick.
---
i mean zg isnt even out and not close to being out. Why are people having an issue right now is my question. 99% of the people that bring this problem up will never reach buff limit.
---
These defences are so biased. Very few people would play with combat log open checking for a rogue/druid stealth cast when casually playing if Spy was banned. There are comments in this thread defending spy because going stealth has a sound effect... Blizzard banned the lfg addon for being "not in the spirit of vanilla", how is this any different?
---
Well yesterday before raid i want run DMT for buffs. I died 14 times before i finally reach instance.14 times from Mojache to DMN!!!
---
Lmao, yeah APES arent no life thanks for your input
---
This only validates that the mouseover target is an enemy.  The OP asked that it also checks his current target to be an enemy as a secondary polymorph target (after it fails the mouseover target check)
---
Vanilla had significantly less players on the servers than Classic does because of better technology.  I've noted this in other threads.
---
Using round numbers (I don't have the actual stats) we are in a case where maybe 3,000 players was a server cap back in Vanilla spread across the entire map where in Classic you might have 25,000 or 30,000 players spread across the map.  With the map obviously not increasing in size you can see how packing this many players into one world could have a different feel than it did 15 years ago.
---
It's just too crowded and therefore there is literally almost no safe spot for people to continue questing/progression, etc...
---
Once you become soul link the odds forever change.
---
Classic must be bugged!
---
I think the best approximation you can gather is through AH listings for each faction. If one faction has 40,000 listings, and the other has 20,000 then I believe it's fair to assume there's a 2:1 ratio.
---
How about don’t be a fucking idiot expecting to win a 1v10 and get 9 other dudes to help you out. This game is meant to be played with other people not solo 1v10. Go back to retail if you can’t handle it.
---
3x the competition but 3x the bracket sizes. Plus people know exactly how it works and will stack brackets and rotate out those that got their rank. Though daily updates make it a bit trickier.
---
and they came boooounding over
---
I'm in the same boat as you at Lv 53. I'm just not going to play till Bags come out. Game is unplayable in its current state.
---
I like all the posts saying to wait until BGs. As though the players playing rogues stealth killing all sub-60s are doing it for HKs. Some people just suck, gotta learn that.
---
There is an unfortunate amount of shitposts about this subject.
---
Then I stand by my originals statement that you’ll be so impressed with the training dummies. You don’t even have to risk your life by leaving the city anymore
---
There's probably still a bunch of types of report you could still automate mutes for to lessen this load, but name change and bans should really be reviewed always before actioning.
---
sounds like they're just waiting for people to log in. it doesn't matter if they think he logged out. they'll just wait for new people
---
Yes, we definitely need an official statement about Blizzard being okay with PvP action on a server specifically designed for PvP.
---
People have their pre-raid bis and just don't have much to do outside raids and wpvp.
---
Thanks for the advice, I am new but have won a lot of fights already so thought I was doing fine.  Great to see something to improve upon.
---
These horde players can’t think that far ahead.  I’m going to enjoy it.
---
That is not average at all, I see people spamming trade with offers at 7g or 5g, never higher.
---
Buy the ring off a lock?
---
Can you explain I didn't know you buy it?
---
Dude you're like level 48. 
---
***You*** are the lowbie.
---
That is rubbish. Resistance does almost nothing and is a waste of time.
---
I was talking about the last few words of your comments,
---
&gt;only main/offhand.
---
My server is balanced and I don't even bother logging in anymore except for raids.  Unless you want to zerg around and gank, there's nothing to do...because of all the people zerging around and ganking.
---
Make sure you have the right faction set, each one can say unique things. If you're looking for Horde to Alliance, you choose Horde.
---
Set it to Horde and put in "gotoretail"  
---
Set it to Alliance and put in "okboomer"
---
the older the game gets the better warlocks are
---
&gt;But with your tiny brain
---
What is self awareness?
---
LULW ANY TRUERS
---
Also curious about this
---
Imagine logging out in one of the most active wpvp zones.
---
I like putting myself in situations where only Spy could result in my dying, then when I inevitably die, I snicker to myself at how superior I am as I walk back to my corpse.
---
I simply want a high pop server not a insanely high pop server. It’s not a problem only I am having either. I don’t want to play on a dead server where you can only get groups from 6pm-10pm and I don’t want a server that requires me to be logged in to team viewer every 10  minutes. What personal problems do you contain the cause you to come and complain on a thread that is complaining?
---
I have played so much less since the whole PvP Honor change. I cannot level up because I get steamrolled by a group of 5 horde every minute! When the hype dies down I’ll be playing again!
---
It's the latter. They don't want to.
---
All I seem to see are rogues,  warriors, and UD mages in pvp. Its 99% of the time melee that I come across and melee that are ganking me. Mages my level can 2-shot me with Frostbolt &gt; Cone of Cold shatter combo while under the effects of WOTF, while my dots are ticking for 50 per tick, so it's not like I can kill casters either.
---
Deathball in the center while the druids race the flag and rogues cap nodes. That's not the competitive, serious meta, but that's what you're likely to see in PUGS.
---
Druids run flags, priests cleanse and heal warriors, rogues cap nodes.
---
&gt; have concerns that even using push to talk with something like a Blue Yeti would still have a loud background noise due to it being on the desk next to the speaker. 
---
Correct, a sensitive studio microphone like a Blue Yeti will pick up a keyboard/fan if it's right next to it. It can't cancel external sounds out completely.
---
If the mic is closer to your face, it can reduce the volume of other sounds without killing your voice. Also, microphones will always sound more natural the closer you are to it so sticking a blue yeti on your desk away from your face will generally sound a bit worse than a good headset mic.
---
You could look at a lapel mic that clips onto your shirt. For headset mics, I recommend the V-Moda BoomPro or Antlion ModMic. An external microphone like the Blue Yeti works great if you don't mind mounting it on a BoomArm so it can sit close to your face.
---
Honor drop has decimated servers in general.  You essentially can't play the game right now.
---
warlock is one of the best 1v1 classes at 60
---
Don't worry we got our own Warry with Windfury
---
I cant gear up every class at level 60, only my main.   I can however gear up alt classes quite easily in dungeons and make a twink.
---
Truth, WL's are tanky fuckers and while wotf does make an Ally warlock weaker, they're still very strong if geared and spec'd right. Running into a shadow damage geared Lock in raid spec is much different then a 4.5K+ HP SL lock who will wipe the floor with pretty much any class in a 1v1 scenario.
---
I disagree. The data from several reddit polls showed that pve servers had more interest in BGs. Therefore I think it’s safe to assume that the alliance dominated pve servers would be queuing more. 
---
Combine that with the horde dominated pvp servers where alliance would probably rather queue in a bg to face even odds.
---
It's fixed internally, just waiting for the hotfix to go live.
---
Why are you debating % when there is not even one reliable source available ?
---
Nice humblebrag.
---
PC babies
---
Yes we do because that's how to get the attention of blizzard, it worker with everyone complaining about the pvp now we have BG's.
---
Maybe this question is obvious but I just acquired the vanquishers sword which is in Main Hand, and my Off Hand is either:
---
* Cruel barb
---
* Sword of serenity
---
since the cruel barb has +12 attack power (= +1 dps?) but is lower flat damage (30-57) compared to serenity's (46-86) is it the obvious choice to go with serenity since the DWS talent gives 50% dmg to Off Hands?
---
I'm a healer and have never been charged for mage water. In most cases, the mage will trade me without me even asking and give me like 4 or 5 stacks.
---
Ours is just roll in it if it's an upgrade for your class or if someone wants just ask. One of the officers hangs back and distributes the loot while the raid continues or else wed waste and hour every MC distributing loot. 
---
 I can raid maybe once or twice month unless I choose to further ignore my family for gaming so DKP seems like a flawed system to me.  The parents and workers of the gaming world.
---
I just posted a source.
---
Get 2 birds stoned at one time.
---
I know. That’s what’s so sad.
---
To be fair, 55:45 ratio is about as good as it gets on pvp servers.
---
...sadly
---
bro i got questie i swear i dont know how to use if not for the OPEN MAP AND SEE WHERE SHIT IS AT , i'll google a guide maybe im that oblivious
---
reasonably balanced? what are you talking about, its like 35:65 at best. yojamba is one of the worst servers in terms of balance in classic.
---
Idk I’m liking it so far
---
yea I dont spam anything
---
Whitemane does not look like this. Alliance occasionally form up and counter raid. Whitemane not be balanced, but comparing it to this is disingenuous
---
#Nochanges
---
I’m the GM of my guild, and I’ve had an interaction with the former GM of a couple who joined us a couple of weeks or so ago. 
---
He claimed they were lazy loot whores etc, so I thanked him for the warning. I kept an eye on the pair, but I haven’t seen that yet. 
---
My experience is the complete opposite. The guy is farming consumables and working on his pre-raid bis set. It seems like they were gearing him up to be a healer when he wanted to fill a niche tank position instead.
---
That being said, I detest poaching people whether it be from us or by us, so my standing rules for recruitment are “do not approach members of other guilds”. If they approach us, we’ll happily speak with them. if they want to join us that’s fine, but we don’t approach other guilds’ personnel. 
---
Our new guy is doing an excellent job, so far and I just think it was a case of hurt feelings from his former guild.
---
On alliance, I still have between 20% and 30% war mode bonus. Meaning there is still a LOT more horde outside.
---
There might be "raids roaming", but there's still more horde.
---
I tried IF once with a level 5 and I just didn't like it. It was dark and dreary, yet lacked the creepy charm of Undercity. Now **that's** a proper basement city if I've ever seen one!
---
6% hit if human with swords/maces, orc with axes, or anyone else with edgemaster's. If you're not one of those races, edgemasters are so much better than anything else simply because it's worth 3% hit and some glancing blow damage in just a glove slot. After that, absolutely crit is important. I don't know the AP conversions off the top of my head, but there's a point where x strength/AP will be more valuable than crit so keep that in mind.
---
Crit is limited by the crit cap, and is relative to your hit rating(higher hit chance means you have a higher crit cap). 
---
300 wep skill dual wielding attacking from behind vs lvl 63 boss 100%-26.4%-6.5%-0%-0%-40%+4.8%+hit% = 31.9+hit (-1 if hit &gt; 0)
---
305 wep skill dual wielding attacking from behind vs lvl 63 boss 100%-24.8%-6%-0%-0%-40%+4.8%+hit% = 34+hit
---
Those are the formulas.
---
Bandages, and making loads of runecloth bags for all your alts
---
Every class is valuable. Every class is useful. Yes gear matters, yes scaling matters, but I guarantee you that personal ability will make a more meaningful impact on your DPS than what class you picked. I do not mean to throw shade on anybody, but a poorly played "god tier" dps is going to do worse than a skilled player on a worse class/spec.
---
In random groups there won't be much in the way of strategy. If you are interested in pre-mades, Ohhgee has a couple of videos diving into the competitive meta, here is the WSG one:
---
https://youtu.be/BldVX-FbPos
---
That is not factoring in the dps their buffs provide to their allies. 
---
That is the true value of shamans.
---
I think this is the best approximation we have at this time:
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers/
---
Probably less accurate for smaller servers than large ones, but if you assume the distribution of players interested in logging raids is relatively even across faction and server, then it should be at least directionally accurate.  
---
Anecdotally, it seems to be fairly spot on for my server.
---
It's only because you are level 30ish. Keep leveling and you get stronger. Soul link is good. Void walker sac is good. Curse of tongues the mage is good. He can decurse, but then it's just a mana battle while your dots burn them down. Later you get that spell that causes horror that can't be wotf'd
---
I have the pattern. It's the materials that get me. My gold goes to gambling every week during raid
---
That's what reddit is good for lol
---
This has nothing to do with the buff-cap. You can't stack multiple of the same effect, like I can't use Arcane Intellect + Scroll of Intellect, but there's exceptions to that such as using Onyxia + AP Juju. The exception broke when they made a change to prevent servers from imploding when a billion people are slapped with Dragonslayer. They've already fixed it aswell, before you even made your comment.
---
Juicebox is the only reason we keep Meg around.
---
Priests will target you behind trees etc as soon as you resurect out of ghost and mind vision to see where you are. And hunters will just send pet after you, even though they can't see you.
---
+1 get it on the mirah song
---
no difference between buying the orbs or doing strat live though, just depends if you can make gold faster outside of doing strat live
---
I used mine till Corpsemaker from RFK.
---
As arms, there's nothing you miss out on for using staves until you get to the weapon specs.  Absolutely nothing.  Slow is better is the only rule, and many staves are &gt;=3.0 swing time.
---
Also, strength not being present on the weapon is irrelevant.  Strength coverts to AP which coverts to DPS... the staff has 9 higher DPS?  That's effectively 63 strength if my calculations are correct (1 DPS = 14 AP = 7 STR).
---
I mean it matters to whoever logged off. they'll die less and probably keep some of their sanity lol. But I see what you're saying, it probably won't have a direct impact on the gank squad... but w/e.
---
Odd I got downvoted for just a suggestion. Logging off is legit your best option in that situation.
---
Paladins are god tier AOE Tanks in vanilla. I've had the best time with them in Strat/Scholo. Yes you do not have a taunt, but that sounds like a DPS problem for not watching threat.
---
Go back to....
---
he's gonna use a mirah song for a long time
---
Life must be hard being this stupid
---
You aren't super good at this trolling thing
---
Yeah, true enough. Though, I don't think my heart could handle another hurdle like that lol.
---
2 layers into 1 does not cut it in half.  if the second layer was only using 1/4 of the capacity, then thats just an extra ~2,000 people that the layers were accommodating for, which explains the # in queues
---
It looked like that to me.
---
DPS is 0 though ^^
---
Certainly the case on my server. We almost had to pug people for our raid because people just stopped playing. We had a guy, a rogue on top of that, who just given up on getting to MC and just RQd yesterday, because he only moved 10metres during 5 death.
---
Me im lucky, i could run a whopping 12 seconds every 5 minutes due to bubble, warriors were good too because they could get a charge out to the next horde (and there was plenty to choose from) before they died. Overall took me an hour to get from TP to MC. 
---
I cant even blame the people who has given up.
---
yeah actually i can see using it there for that reason
---
I think some of the unbalance is actually a bit refreshing. It's interesting to have classes that just outright excel at certain roles compared to others- while at the same time no class being completely worthless. That being said It's very surprising that some aspects (like PVP) weren't at least tweaked slightly to accommodate the larger and more prepared playerbase.
---
At least you reach the instance portal. I was in a group for LBRS... Disband cauz impossible to reach the instance. You can't do 1m without getting killed.
---
Most locks run princess for gold farming purposes, so most of them will offer to let you come along and stand at the waterfall while they solo her, if the ring drops you pay them and they loot it to you. Same way hunters sell DM tribute loot, only you have to be in the instance for princess.
---
Did you even watch any of the video?
---
Also, I'd argue its a pretty far jump to call someone a terrible person just for having an opinion on a controversial game mechanic.
---
Why would anyone play on a server this toxic? How much of an actual clown do you have to be to camp the entrance of an instance 10 hours a day
---
How is paladin a hybrid class? Is Priest a hybrid class? Are Warriors a hybrid class?
---
The only true Hybrid I could see is Druid, because they can play all four roles, despite admittedly not very well at them. Priests Heal / DPS, Warriors Tank / DPS, Paladins Tank / DPS / Heal. Paladins are still god tier Healers though.
---
This is why I like dkp systems. If you get outbid on an item, well then you should have valued the item more or attended more raids
---
Maybe find a guild thats looking for members? Theres no shame in never having run a dungeon before and usually people are accomodating
---
Also: try to coordinate with other groups to run in together so that only some of you end up having to corpse hop to the dungeon.
---
If it's Blackrock Mountain, there are often whole raids of Alliance farming honor in there. Talk to them to get some assistance getting to, say, BRD.
---
That’s negated by the alliance majority on the pve servers. Combined across all realms, the census data shows nearly an even split.
---
I'm a tauren on an RPPvP server, so I never attack alliance at all except in defense of another member of the horde. I don't even defend undead rogues, because odds are pretty much 100% that they started it. And I don't kill to defend myself, preferring to run away instead.
---
...despite all of that, I still hit rank 2. Phase 2 is crazy.
---
I dont think there is anything wrong with this, and anyone who does probably shouldn't play on pvp servers.  Nothing that is going on here is against Blizzard tos.  If the Alli want their gear bad enough, they'll find some help from other Alli guilds to come wipe these Horde and get their loot.  If they cant find help or no one is willing to help them, they dont deserve the loot.
---
Imagine a scenario that both factions here are too guilds and denying the other faction loot could benefit your guild getting server first in BWL?  That’s important to some people. Granted I don’t think this situation implies that, but it could have some undertones.  Idk man, I see your point but I don’t think everyone who does what your saying is doing it to be “shitty”
---
2+ hours on Herod.
---
Process of elimination might be your best bet. Either disable all addons and slowly enable them while testing, or enable all and slowly disable one by one.
---
Fear Ward and a Warrior with Blessing of Freedom bashing your head in will feel just as bad for Undead, don’t worry about it. You should’ve been more concerned with Gnome vs Human ;)
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
If you switch to warrior your team would not have a real rez, which can be annoying in dungeons.
---
Alliance.
---
I don’t really see those sorts of guilds around.
---
I see pugs that literally ask and beg for shamans for their utility and buffing ability. 
---
In a perfect world, yeah you might be right. But this is definitely not that.
---
Is it possible to do a full group premade for BGs in classic? I wasn't sure if that was introduced yet, or if being able to queue while in a raid group is possible.
---
Reason I ask is because Blizz announced we're going to have crossrealm BGs, so I honestly think the chance of encountering a full premade, or even a couple of familiar faces, is going to be super super low. I don't think the honor farming is going to be that bad in BGs. (if you can't queue as a full premade) Worst you'll deal with is a coordinated group of 5.
---
I think Orcs look cooler in their gear, and the Stun resist is god tier for PVP. Warriors already have interrupts / stuns depending on their spec, so Tauren isn't a complete necessity. Their HP Buff however is quite awesome.
---
I love pvp and my thoughts were it will be fun but I didn't imagine 1sec this when the open world is hordes everywhere ganking.
---
You’re a GOD
---
You seem upset buddy. Might want to edit that last part.
---
25 warlock meta sounds fun bro
---
Knew it!
---
Cross realm is only between servers of the same type
---
Subscriptions are starting to come up. A lot of the people that have stopped supporting blizzard due to blizzards actions are starting to hit the 3 month point. This will occur again in another 3 months when the 6 month subs come up.
---
The empty bracket isn’t a check for target cast if mouseover isn’t an enemy...?
---
My favorite thing I've seen so far, that goes in line with what OP is saying, was a level *60* raid geared rogue, who was upset that killing the same person 4 times in a day stopped them from giving you any more honour. Where was he upset about this, you may ask? He was in gadgetzan, ganking 48s-52s on their way to farm, and he was *upset* they stopped giving honour after 4 deaths. Fucked up and sad to say he was a horde brethren, but holy fuck is that the epitome of sweaty-living in moms basement-behaviour.
---
A geared 60 complaining 48s don't give him honour after farming them. If that isn't griefing, I don't know what is. So I agree with op. I have yet to see much fair fights, on either side.
---
I 100% agree that it makes a weaker player stronger, by automating a process that would normally have to be done manually and it takes out the human error factor. Much like old decursive,  Details, CCB, DBM, WeakAuras. 
---
My issue is that the people against Spy are typically trying to argue that Spy gives you information that is not available to you unless you use spy. Which is completely false. Personally I say get rid of all logs, get rid of DBM and spy. Get rid of anything that gives you a fancy little UI to make things easier for you.
---
This works, it's just you have to pay attention to your rage.  Make sure you have 10 rage for intercept or you could end up getting lost as to which stance you are and not intercepting.
---
I used a variation of this for Mocking Blow and sometimes I ended up swapping back and forth without using the ability and wasting precious time while my healer was getting beat on.
---
I would personally rather have Intercept and Berserker Stance on 1 button then having another seperate binding i could hit on the way in to change back to defensive.
---
If only it were released!
---
There is a difference, it is 100% acceptable to try to horde a resource by farming it constantly, its is against ToS to use members of the other faction to act as guards via PvP, but that is still minor compared to the 100 or so players that have been mass false reporting 1 player because their guild tells them to, just because he is not charging for something. 
---
no mafia is acceptable, but some mafias are way worse than others
---
TF?
---
I think it depends on faction and server definitely. I’m on a really balanced server so things are pretty stable here it seems.
---
When going to battlegrounds, would you suggest the succubus for versatility? Or perhaps in WSG and AB see what the enemy team consists of and go from there?
---
Maybe on your server. Herod has a queue again and it's \~2hrs long every night.
---
I think people are douches. I ran a dungeon with a level 58 tank in Scholo last night and he did fine. as DPS the only content I would be eh about is 5-man UBRS, but as a 59 lock you should be gravy.
---
If you don't want to seem derpy just watch a youtube video or scout on your own how to get to each of the dungeons. It's not terribly rare to not have the key to scholo / strat UD, so nobody should kick you for that. Just make sure you keep the SM Key for Strat Live.
---
Watch a video on how to run each dungeon, and how to get to the dungeon.
---
The best gear comes from raids. You don't need the best gear to win, but gear matters. 
---
As a warlock, you don't need to tell people you are new for dungeons. Just stack on the healer and banish/seduce when told. There are no mechanics you need to know aside from: stay at max range vs Rivendare; kill the skeletons when Gandling teleports you; keep your back to the wall vs Kirtonos.
---
Huge drop on Herod.
---
Why do people keep blaming the players when its the honor system that is compelling their behavior? 
---
If 1 person stops killing the enemy, 100 others will take their place, and the result is they end up getting a lower rank. Stop pretending that a certain faction houses a concentrated type of person. They're no different than your faction, they're just in different circumstances. 
---
Swap situations and your faction would be doing the same shit because the system encourages you to do so.
---
Don't know much about that add-on. What does it do? What specifically don't you like about it?
---
There's a whole bunch of us that weren't children back in 2006.
---
I bet you're horde.
---
Yes you should be able to que as a premade, just as in vanilla.
---
And ZG.
---
The guys that made the great hunt transfered to heart seeker. They wanted actual competition.
---
I want to play all day but I can’t.
---
Joined a guild which has loot council, which was a part of a larger guild which got disbanded, you guessed it, because of loot council! I am not hoping for items to drop, but for drama!!
---
2006!
---
Pretty much as soon as you can afford them. They'll pay for themselves - you have more space to carry shit in, so you can vendor more crap, and get more money by doing this, without having to waste time to constantly travel between hubs and questing areas, if you don't want to skip/destroy loot.
---
Most BiS lists will have you above 9% hit.
---
Kill a turtle with an axe?
---
[This is an actual video of a live turtle being butchered rather brutally.](https://youtu.be/kb-t5AgLKjE)
---
I disagree here. Fighting the opposite faction at a world boss isn't petty. Petty is when 200 horde corpse camp any alliance having the gall to attempt to get into a dungeon.
---
-skeram alliance player.
---
best league of legends team is NA cus they are the most 4fun
---
Good thing you can mount up while they watch you do it through mind vision. 
---
The addon doesn’t make the game unplayable. Especially since it’s available to everyone.
---
Play retail
---
What can a lock do to a bubbled pally?
---
I haven't ran many dungeons in this phase because it's a terrible idea. We knew when it was coming and what it would entail, I'm happy not dungeoning for a bit. But we have ran a few and it involved some corpse running. Not a single one lasted 45 minutes because if it does you're doing something very wrong, sorry. You can outplay larger groups if you're ready and willing. 
---
That video shows a guy 'trying to get into BRD' by entering through the entrance that is constantly more contested and who actively chooses to pursue PVP instead of using opportunities to slip through. And he's a ROGUE.
---
I’ve been playing a warlock since launch and haven’t stopped playing even to make an alt (other than for banking purposes). Once you get coil, it makes a huge difference. Coil into a fear and then DoT is pretty op. I remember being really annoyed at lower levels in STV being super easy to kill. Now that I’ve been 60 for a while 4/8 Felheart with a few other pieces mixed in, most of the time I dance and wand when I’m fighting a warrior. Shamans and Spriest are the most difficult classes I’ve come across to beat. Just keep leveling and don’t buy into the whole “AoE leveling mage meta”. Make it to 60, you’ll enjoy it. I promise.
---
Honestly my favorite part of leveling as ret was destroying rogues that thought they stood a chance. Didn't matter if I was 50% hp fighting a mob, they'd ambush backstab, pop cool downs, whatever. I'd just bubble after they burned through all their energy and combo points and holy light up to full health and then watch them shit their pants and try to escape as they realize how fucked they are. They try to vanish, I'm a human so I just pop perception and smack them right out of stealth and by that point it's already over for them. Then they get camped.
---
Yeah, that can play a big part. I'm not sure about the final %s of my server since I never checked, but even during levelling we already noticed a heavy horde-favored balance in population, so even before the honor system launched I was already dying between one and three times to get to BRD.
---
I honestly would be shocked to see if the players yelling NOCHANGES were even around in Vanilla. Like, to me, it seems obvious what players want to keep more than anything- slower/meaningful level progression, no LFG, and larger raids. Nobody was asking and begging for Blizzard to bring back a wPVP experience that makes leveling as an alliance pure misery. As long as you keep the fundamental requests in tact I don't see why it's such a big deal to tweak some of the more annoying or gamebreaking issues.
---
my $.02
---
Warrior - Mortal Strike or full purple'd Tank
---
Priest - Chad Shadow or Chad Healer
---
Paladin - Ret or Healer
---
Rogue - DPS (Pref Stunlock)
---
Druid - Everything (BIS Flag Runner for WSG)
---
Shaman - Everything
---
Warlock - I don't know, but afflic is probably good
---
Mage - POM Pyro or Frost
---
Hunter - I don't know.
---
I'm fairly certain battlegroups included all server types. The point of battle groups is to try to fix queue times for unbalanced servers.
---
Is there a modified rotation for rhok'delar and is it actually better (with and without sinew quiver)
---
it's the best by far. It has to be handicapped in 1v1 tournies
---
Yeah, was wondering how I should prioritize crit/spell power in raids. I figures spellpower is best in dungeons as I dot a lot. In raids however, shadowbolt is 90% of the dmg.
---
i was just about to hit the transfer button to this server when i decided to make sure the wowhead pop chart was coreect. is this still the case? i too am on dreamist and i havent been able to play since honor released. i saw that dragonfang was almost 50/50 unlike dreamist at 40/60 so horde just rape us all day.
---
I got about 200 comments of people crying that I was ruining their super secret recipe farm secret
---
Buy bags as you can afford them leveling up. More bag space means less time vendoring and not picking up items. 
---
Invent space is a huge qol thing once you can afford bags. 
---
The two things that are super important for leveling are your crucial skills (those that help you level) and inventory space.
---
Gear comes with quests and dungeons.
---
Yeah, I have to argue with people that me, a 58 fire mage, will do more Dps than most 60s. Most people don't believe me but I'm usually top DPs by the end. I always get the "you're not 60" I've even offered gold to people than can out DPs me just to get accepted into a scholo grp
---
Honestly, yeah I think there's balance within the unbalance.
---
Warriors are top DPS, cool. They're also terrible farmers, they are horrible to farm BiS because it's high competition/low drop, they are one of the slowest levelers, and they have a ton of consumes they need to farm.
---
Hunters are weak raid DPS and lose a bag slot, ok, but also insanely fast solo levelers, very good solo gold farmers, and pretty good in PvP
---
Druids aren't amazing in anything; sure, but they are also the most versatile class and extremely easy to farm BiS while also being fast levelers.
---
Like, classes have their positives and negatives despite not being anywhere near balanced in any one field; and all classes are brought to raids because it helps with loot distribution and they each are needed (at very least in small amounts). No class is objectively the "better" class, it depends solely on what metric you want to use and how you want to play.
---
Yeah, makes sense. Maybe as I get more PvP reps I'll encounter it more and figure out how to deal with it
---
Smart. Thank you!
---
You can absolutely OT or heal as hotw/ns. You can decurse too if needed.
---
The most important thing for either role is gear. You're going to be carrying 2.5 gear sets (tank, heal, and FR tank gear) so make sure to have bag space. It's normal to have shitty gear to lvl 52/53 before you run BRDx50 for arena gear, and you might want second wind too. Don't buy gear off the AH for tanking or healing, but rather buy mats, find a LW and have them craft stuff you need (warbear harness, hide of the wild etc.) And maybe some cheaper upgrades for any particularly bad gear you have.
---
Then just run dungeons until you get a lot of good gear.
---
Around 45ish is  when I really had to stop 2h tanking. Some of the mobs in Uldaman just hit too hard. And I was fully 1h/sh from that point on, except on easy packs.   Vanquishers does more top end damage, so your overpowers, whirlwinds, and mortal strike will be stronger, so I would go with that. But honestly, it should matter that much, especially since im guessing that you dont have an axe for axe specialization.
---
But once the point of camping someone for no honor? I don’t buy this “it’s war” shit.
---
&gt; My ambitious long-time goal is to clear all the raids in WoW Classic by myself!
---
You're going to need to grow some new arms to do this.  I just don't see how it would be mechanically possible, since there are fights that require each raid member to react differently and within a few seconds to dynamic events.  Multiboxing works great when you have all your "followers" doing the same thing as the main toon, but beyond that it's going to be a nightmare to manage.
---
Me, and I fucked it before I left too.
---
I’m betting/hoping they will be across all of classic.  I don’t think their press release indicated anything though. Have to wait and see.
---
&gt;I see pugs that literally ask and beg for shamans for their utility and buffing ability.
---
yes resto shamans are hard to get but that doesn't mean everyoen wouldn't pick them over enhancement.
---
&gt;I don’t really see those sorts of guilds around.
---
Look up the top 50 mc speed clears in say.. the U.S. and look at their composition. this isn't rocket science. the info is all public.
---
That's also the wrong subreddit, it's just a circle jerk for PCs
---
Except personal damage doesnt matter for enhancement shamans. 90% of their purpose is to buff the best melee group with twisting and str totems. WF procs and crits are just an extra. Fast forward to phase 3 and we will  be rocking Nightfall so that others dont have to while still doing all the same stuff as previous.
---
Surprise, you're wrong, I'm the GM and my guild is flourishing because we don't take people that are required to be trained on the absolute basics of the game and we don't have people rolling on gear they don't need. 
---
Depends on the kind of guild your in. If your in a super casual guild you probably let it go and it's not a big deal.
---
If it rubbed this guy the wrong way enough for him to make a reddit thread he's probably in at least slightly more serious guild, in which case why would you want some dude zonked out on ambien rolling on gear they don't need? It's not gona go over well in raids.
---
What we know about PVP today is you need to rank higher than the people around you. Now we have honor trackers (HonorSpy) that can give you a hint at how many HKs you'll need to rank up. - If I'm going to be in a queue for more than 15min; I'll be out doing something. On a PVP Server, that'd be finding opposing faction to murderate.
---
I honestly can't think of a single pServer that didn't allow for 'remote BG' queuing, and all I played on was 'blizzlike' or 'x2 XP' servers. - I think they all ran the same core, though....not sure.
---
You dont have deathcoil yet do you, and im sure theres other things youre missing ability wise. Also your gear at 60 will be drastically different for warlock than while leveling.
---
Use los, silence/charm more effectively and you should beat mages or at least compete with them
---
Everyone here is talking about resistance gear from what they have read. I took the time to put together some SR gear because Shadow Priests cannot fight warlocks, the average warlock will crush every priest they duel. Here is a video showing that at 177 Shadow resist. Nothing was resisted. If I'm lucky maybe it saves me under 100 HP in a fight. That's just not worth anything.
---

---
Huh, don't know it myself but the other time someone posted it when someone wanted help
---
This is just how wpvp was with world bosses.... It's just a shame blizzard ruined it to suit all the casual whiners in later expansions.
---
One look at the comments in this thread is all the reason a person needs to never visit this subreddit. What a bunch of whiny babies.
---
It's a trade-off. I have much less free time than I used to, but I wouldn't want to go back to being single, out of shape, and unemployed.
---
I occasionally get a twinge of wishing for those days back, but it quickly fades.
---
On my server (skeram) it doesnt matter how many alliance we round up to go anywhere. There is always double the horde waiting on us. On our recent raid night my guild, along with another alliance guild running to MC got farmed by 200+ horde near the entrance of black rock mountain. This shit is rough. Ive stuck around because my friends have still been playing on it and the guild they got me in is still there, but on the off chance they allow ally to server swap again, im out. Ive had enough corpse running for one lifetime lol
---
From what I have heard.
---
Mage AoE zone control, such as 2 mages cutting off a road with blizzard. Single target control with polymorph, counterspell, and frost CC against melee.
---
Warrior, wrecking ball or tank, healers keep him up while he cleaves through it all, or useless with weak gear.
---
Rogue, back cap and defender, good at annoyance and getting in the back line for CC and damage.
---
Priest, support, offensive and defensive dispel, healing, and shields. Shadow for good 1v1 potential, but worse the bigger the numbers on both sides are, can spread dots if you have time.
---
Warlocks, single target CC, good 1v1, tanky, lots of utility and buffs. Tankier let's you put up more dots.
---
Hunter, traps, flare to detect stealth, strong consistant range DPS with mana draining shot.
---
Druid, jack of all trades, master of flag carrying. Can fill pretty much any roll. Swiss army knife of utility.
---
Shaman, great offensive support. Totems are great with a ton of utility, good spell dps while still fine at healing. Only offensive dispel.
---
Paladin, great defensive support. Auras, BoP to make casters immune to physical damage, BoF to make melee immune to slows, very tanky, very good healer. Only defensive dispel.
---
This is mostly in a group setting. Obviously classes like Ret paladin, enhance shaman, shadow priest etc are valuable in smaller skirmishes, and healers are less valuable without organization.
---
That’s what I’m saying. Most of my deaths are giving the people that kill me 0 honor. It’s just people that have been online for 10 hours that day that have nothing better to do irl than kill gray levels to piss them off and claim it’s because classic is “war” lol.
---
open world between BGs tho 
---
we aren't gunna just sit around in org waiting for queue lol. my premade will be running around winterspring / felwood / azshera regularly between queues
---
Thank you for the story! We need more people like you on the Horde. We just have these NOOBS who think they are good just because they are "High Warlord's", whatevet that means
---
The administrative and the chained both agree
---
All the addon does is make it easier.  You can still do everything you've mentioned without it.
---
Throw away the barb. 30dps weapon vs 20dps weapon, 30&gt;20.
---
Youre also wrong
---
r/buildapc
---
anyone aware how your rotation changes with rhok delar with/without sinew quiver?
---
Definitely saw some horde names that have killed me camping in Searing Gorge before. Skeram Alliance is like playing as the humans in Metro 2033.
---
If you're going to get Tailoring to 300 for Robe of the Void, you'll probably want to keep tailoring there to craft the Bloodvine set when it becomes available since it's BiS. It depends how much you play really, but personally I don't play nearly enough to consider leveling tailoring to 300 twice.
---
Why do people think that PvE servers are for casuals?
---
You're awful sanctimonious for someone whose screen name is literally SexPervert69.
---
Yeeepp i got everything I need from mc except for accuria and I'm not planning on getting it because I'd rather it go to someone more important.
---
I think your going about this way to seriously lmao.
---
I mean for me it's the alarm bells where it crosses the line, but it's all subjective.
---
Ok thanks. So basically ambush and backstab and talents that boost those two aren't really worth it for PVP unless you come across some crazy good daggers?
---
Seriously this game is full of insufferable man-children.
---
Probably the AV where the meta was 30+ man premades that race the game in 7-10 minutes.
---
The only real shit that can start is when the opposing side makes a concerted effort to squash the race and backcap GYs. That can cause some hour+ AVs.
---
You don't have to get edgies. You can get muggers belt, distracting dagger, or aged core leather gloves for dagger skill.
---
You need to read comments in context. 
---
\&gt; You can award loot while an invisibility potion ticks - seems your GM has a few tricks to learn
---
As an alliance player on skeram, i feel your pain. Luckily i hit 60 before phase 2, but i havent played much since. Every where i go im corpse running. Even in all the major cities there are constantly groups of horde just sitting in safe spots 24/7
---
again. you can do the math for totem twisting. no one is saying shamans don't provide buffs... we're saying the marginal value provided by the buffs of an enhancement shammy or ele shammy to the raid does not counter the loss of dps in simply replacing that shaman with the next worse melee/ranged dps class.
---
On the weekends (only time I got left), for me, it's about 11 hours (off and on; AFKing at the AH). I end up using Retal maybe 3 times.
---
No changes
---
What the hell did I just read.
---
I expected to get grinded for honor, but then once I’m not worth anything anymore people just keep killing you. That’s not min-maxing in 2019 lol, min-maxing would be moving on and finding new targets.
---
impossible sorry
---
Like it or not, the game will require some changes sooner or later.
---
"But private servers lasted for over 10 years, clearly people want to play the same unchanged game to infinity and beyond"
---
Not really. While it's understandable that out of millions of players who played this game there will be a few thousand who love the earlier version and want to play it forever it's also worth noting that Blizzard won't keep the game running for like 20k players. That amount of players also isn't a good representation of what the majority of the playerbase wants.
---
So anyway change is required for most people to keep them engaged. This is also partly why TBC and WotLK were so succesful. If we had this version of the game from 2007 and onward it would die out completely by 2010.
---
I see some high numbers being posted here so I want to throw my 2 cents in in case it's worrying you. I lasher farm as a holy priest with 3000 hp and 6100 mana. I only use interfocus when I mess up or if it's the last pull. Pull the lashers, holy nova until they are dead and wand if a few happen to survive. I can do each run in 10-15 mins.
---
Must have been stressful. I'm sorry for you experience.
---
what's retail?
---
Can't wait for the realization to sink in that their wins have been due to their numbers and not skill.
---
Also, have fun with the long queues, assholes.
---
I love these kind of posts, i don't even play wow.
---
I would argue that SP is not so much about the SP Scaling as it is the giant toolbox of toys to play with. Silence, Mana Burn, Fear on a short CD, Bubble, slow, DoTs. As far as I am concerned SPs are always dangerous.
---
I believe 16 is mainhand and 17 is offhand.
---
are you really trying to convince me that twisting and str totem will make up for the 30-50% dps drop that bringing shaman over a warrior/rogue provides?
---
Jesus and I thought having 56 gold after getting my mount was good
---
Nah, keep working on your warlock skillz. I mean, sure, the timing is a bit tight at the start of the encounter, and if you let the enemy just unload into you, you're fucked, but if you manage to drag out the fight, you can wear down just about anyone. This will also get easier once you get Death Coil.
---
Also, I don't think you appreciate how powerful DoTs are in wPvP specifically. Being able to keep most of your dps going while out of range/out of sight is nasty.
---
I feel like a lot of BiS lists are failing in that department. The current rogue prebis list has you at like 12% hit, meanwhile crit is valued higher, but it has things like tarnished elven ring higher than a quickstrike which will have .5% more crit, stamina, and a lot more AP. I feel like they're decent guidelines, but you should go at them with a mindset of "I need x% to soft cap, after that I should learn conversion rates to truly find out which is best).
---
From my understanding Alliance still vastly outnumber Horde. I think it's like 60/40 or 70/30.
---
My man is using chain lightning on targets *a few yards away from a civilian*
---
„Mooom... get the camera!!!“
---
how do you kill Ragnaros ? He requires heavy healing and  requires you to move your characters all the time because they get bumped into the lava
---
Love that canabalize sound at the end, enjoyed the whole movie actually, well done.
---
Lol I've had the same experience. My favorite was at the BRM entrance from searing gourge. 
---
They had 3 horde outside to engage and retreat into the cracked door, whereupon 70 horde were waiting. 
---
Like, I was heading there anyway? Anyone running up the darn ramp is. Its like they think theyre extremely cunning and innovative by hiding behind a door and mobbing 1 dude. Theyre strategic brilliance knows no bounds.
---
That's a lot of qq, maybe you just play on a really imbalanced server? I play a gnome warrior and I enjoy the wpvp and game in general a whole lot, with mostly solo play on a full server. Leave the poor guy alone lol.
---
Definitely not dead. But definitely died down
---
Thank you for your support it’s kind internet strangers like you that make me think I can make it through this
---
I take issue with your idea that resto shamans can't maintain uptime on the buffs. I also think that this criticism applies far more to totem twisting - in theory enhanc shamans can maintain high uptime on GOA + WF twisting, but in reality from logs people quote this can drop off.
---
I'm not denying that enhance shamans bring something to the raid. We have one in our guild. I'm taking issue with the idea that it's better, and I think people admit that personal DPS is lower but think that the buffs to the group make up for it, but when you crunch the numbers it's often not the case. I do need to find some up to date numbers on totem twisting. But you're having to make up a 40% disparity, so GOA twisting needs to increase each other group member's DPS by 9% - and the paper numbers need to be higher since in reality you are unlikely to have 100% uptime. If you put the enh shaman in the warrior group, GOA buffs crit by 4.5%. That doesn't look like it makes up for a 9% disparity.
---
I have no problem with anyone bringing an enh shaman to a raid - and a lot more factors go into the DPS someone actually does than paper numbers - is the player good, do they run out of fire, do they turn up with consumables, etc. etc. However, the idea that the paper numbers support the argument for enh shamans I don't think is right. The paper numbers support the shaman going resto and another DPS warrior being brought. But you can also look beyond the paper numbers.
---
I don't know if I missed it in your post, but you can use 2 invisibility potions. The lesser and greater are on separate 10 min cooldowns but share the 2 min cool down. Could cut down the time as well. Bringing a healer would have been way better though.
---
Yeah, I think you're safe from this particular kind of hurdle, even the enchanting trainer in Uldaman is a cakewalk compared to this undertaking.
---
It rolls over once a week. Check again next Tuesday.
---
Should I continue questing (for gold) once I hit 60 if I don’t have any other people online to run dungeons with?
---
I’ve cleared pretty much all of Kalimdor but still haven’t really touched EP and WP and I just need to finish up tailoring (at 290) and enchanting (at 275).
---
Or should I start rolling my alt?
---
Faerlina is 50/50 or close to it
---
If I make a shit eating contest and people participate, I'm pretty sure the contest is as shitty as they are.
---
It isn't a question of fair under game rules in my post whatsoever. I'm pretty sure denying people their loot after a kill is very much fucking them over. If you disagree with that, there isn't much to say.
---
i prefer my pvp server, love the feeling of hunting/being hunted in small scale fights, makes it really exciting
---
Some tips that have helped me:
---
* I would recommend using Berserker Rage right before or after you charge in and start your rotation, you'll have a lot more rage to be able to put down sunders
---
* maybe make a stance dance thunderclap macro to have handy to throw down once early on 
---
* I wouldn't recommend using both shouts in a row, just pick one to get all mobs attention because too much time will go by before the second one goes out and your dpsers has already started to unleash hell and you haven't put points on the mobs
---
* Revenge over sunder if it's up
---
* Don't use heroic strike or cleave, heroic strike is for when you have so much rage you don't know what to do with it, and having a stance dance whirlwind macro is a better to go-to instead of cleaving 
---
*Shield slam if it's up for highest threat
---
If you're still in arms and having gone prot yet, still make sure you have macros to dance around. You should have a whirlwind macro, as it's a great way to remind the mob who's boss especially if you're doing this with a 2-hander. 
---
An opener for me in arms that worked was Berserker Rage &gt; Charge in &gt; Thunderclap &gt; Battle or Demoralizing Shout &gt; Start applying sunders &gt; at 25 rage Whirlwind &gt; back to sunders
---
Have a macro for mocking blow. It's practically taunt no.2 and it's just amazing to have that in there in case you need it. 
---
Honestly you should have a lot of macros. Make sure your handy abilities have change stance options in them
---
Warlocks and Spriests are gonna pull high threat just b/c of the class.
---
Only evil people pick mage then start fights with warriors.
---
I agree with this. My understanding is that Paladin tanks really take off once they can consecrate, that they have the best AoE threat of any tank.
---
You won't raid tank on a Paladin, but my understanding is that they are amazing dungeon tanks.
---
that is a very little amount of horde  
---
BRM is Orgrimmar 2 on Firemaw EU
---
This is actually a threat for both sides, no matter how one-sided a server is. The moment the world boss dies, every single member of the winners faction who didn't take part in the winning raid will leave, because they have nothing to gain.
---
Every single member of the losing faction now has something to stay for. Seeing the loot rot. So even if you have 200 horde killing azuregos and 100 alliance failed, five minutes later it might be 40 horde vs 80 alliance.
---
As elemental it can work. You'll use a major mana every fight and people will moan that elemental isn't viable or doing crap dps. If you want totems it can work better than bringing more resto shamans. Damage isnt that bad, it's perfectly passable. I always have aggro on p3 ony when she lands cus of the burst
---
BRM is a joke. I corpse ran from the FP at thorium point twice yday. Once took 30mins the other 25. Only going to UBRS too. It’s tough out there especially when the alliance on our server have an everyman for themselves mentality
---
You're not a jerk. Everyone entered that run knowing that. The only thing you are is someone who may have more trouble getting a full group, but that's it. Hes the idiot to play ignorant and he's the jerk who tried to wipe the group.
---
The guy was definitely in the wrong for asking you to pass on loot but it seems pretty reasonable to me that loot should be generally equally divided between you two.  You shouldn't expect to get 5 peices of loot in a row and him 0 just because you won 5 rolls in a row.  This doesn't excuse his attitude initially though.  And the only reason you're behind on gear now is because you missed the raid.. not because of any other reason.
---
You probably want to chill in Felwood or Winterspring, then. Maybe Ungoro or at Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands.
---
Those are contested farming spots, so people will be drawn to them.
---
Reeeeeeeeee
---
Im only questing from lv 1 and im nearly lv 48 making at least 1 lv per day playing around 4 hours per day and that as holy/prot paladin on a pvp server.Going to only spam dungeons from lv 50
---
Because horde players are pvper. Not alliance player are. So even if the ratio is 50-50, there is way much more pvper on the horde side.
---
And besides 55/45 is already a pretty big difference. That means it's well over 20% more horde than alliance.
---
Yeah that's my worry. I hate the add-on but there are others I like quite a lot that I would like to keep
---
&gt; butthurt
---
Found the zoomer.
---
Your server has less than 1000 players which makes a huge difference for quality of life when you are the outnumbered faction
---
Horde drop in cities can also be partially attributed to them being outside of Alliance cities and every medium to high level flight path in the game.
---
You think you want it, but you don't.
---
Yeah but we're talking about twinking here.
---
pvp trinket?
---
Lame
---
He's clearly answered your question multiple times.
---
The HK/honor counts update daily, only rank points and rank update once a week.
---
http://www.logicalincrements.com/ is a good reference point.
---
Practice without theory is also pointless if you just want to get better, though you'll rank up faster that way from the honor you do get. 
---
Cloth chest pieces from raids are pretty rare, but if you find you mostly use shadow spells robe of winter night isn't a bad robe
---
What do you expect when leveling already took a lot of time in the 50-60 bracket and then honor came out and that time balooned to at least 3× as long.
---
For some reason everybody who is level 60 seems to sync their IQ with their level number and just can't get it through their thick skulls.
---
"Ooh sounds like PvP happened on a PvP server"
---
No bitch what happened was you killed me like I kill a lowbie boar outside Orgrimmar and I couldn't do shit about it. I want to get to 60 so I can kill your sorry ass but I can't because I'm a walking free kill for you honor farmers. I stand no chance and with the current meta of smaller groups nobody wants to take me because I only weigh them down.
---
"Just do dungeon farming" 
---
Whoopty fucking doo. It takes 5-10 deaths to get from Torium point to BRD/LBRS. Even if I have 5 hours to play every day (which I don't) that's one hour gone just assembling the group and getting to the entrance. Then what? Another corpse run everytime the party wants to reset the dungeon. Fucking great.
---
This guy is a rogue that is also a sergeant.  You also spit on people.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say you have done your fair share of ganking, most of which was completely one sided and unfair.  I feel no sympathy.
---
Perhaps. Lie and say you know what to do, then stand in the back and take it slowly. They should be unlikely to kick you once you're underway.
---
People on PvE servers like big world pvp battles, we just don't like being mercilessly ganked while trying to move to an instance. You can pretty much always find a big battle happening in Hillsbrad, and those raids are a great way to farm honor.
---
Say what now?
---
Can you explain the full purple'd tank part? I'm a prot warrior, with pretty decent gear, and I thought we had no place in PvP. We definitely seem to be ultra bad in world PvP. 
---
I'm completely new to WoW, and I thought I had no interest in PvP, but some of the Exalted gear from Battlegrounds are insane, so if they're fun and/or I have a spot in them I may check them out. I just don't know anything about the battlegrounds other than what I've seen on here (or in Atlas Loot).
---
I think it runs way better then Google Remote at least due to the fact that I can lower the bit rate super low when I have a bad signal on my phone. Allows me to move around and see what's happening in game vs a laggy stutter shit show lol
---
Lol Every time i see war with hand of rag shamans and paladins Are going REeeeeEEeE
---
Sunk time fallacy, I guess

Princess twerking.
---
Yea that's actually typical for a Classic PvP server.
---
You can still expect there to be alliance raids in blackrock mountain most nights.
---
I stopped reading your post after you said you died to a warrior your level.
---
If you're losing to a warrior as a warlock then I doubt you'd do much better switching classes. Sounds honestly like you just need to get better at the game.
---
I’m pretty outspoken against Zerg PvP on my realms subreddit (which I see alliance doing VERY often) but go off kid
---
I agree. I tend to look at others getting ganked on the way and I'm happy because it means they aren't coming after me, and I can get 100 yards closer to ubrs.
---
There are evenly balanced large pop PvP servers that you could have a look at if you really wanted. It is the same shit for a horde player, and yes, I saw that video on Skeram. Whether I go to BRD or DM, I have to spend 30 mins corpsewalking to the entrance and see the same group of 7-8 gnomes camping my corpse, killing me even after the 8th time when I clearly don't yield honor anymore. This is more about human behaviour generally (there are shitty no lifers on BOTH factions), than taste (which factions do shitty people usually choose).

Ber
---
Go to Southshore, join a raid. I got 300 hks on accident just by healing for 2 hours.
---
Then i link my BS skelly keys and the shut up real quick.
---
ToS and rules do not mean something is right or wrong, in the same way that law doesn't determine morality. I made no argument this shouldn't be possible. I just described it as I saw it: shitty.
---
We’re all part of the problem haha

---
I just got the quest "the old ways" need to buy 120 coal .....
---
The horde on this server really should do some research on sustainable farming techniques
---
Even so, the world is going to be good again. Ally vs Horde premades are not my concern. Even loss farming AV is okay.
---
9%
---
Nobody really needs NR for ZG lol
---
Yes. That’s how games work. If you think a good game forever goes up in players then I want to know what good game you play.
---
Incendius alliance feels about the same
---
If they're more than 4 levels lower than me, they get to live. It's no fun killing someone that can barely fight back. Otherwise, I'll take any 1v1 and most 1v2's. 
---
The exception to the rule is Paladins. Any Paladin is KoS.
---
Think this should be level 30 - 45 and connect to Blackened Marches to the south. Love all of your map ideas!
---
Wasn't thinking about bg twinks here. But you're right about that. But still a pet lvl should be like 3 or 4 bars
---
&gt; I don't actually believe you
---
That's fine, you don't have to.
---
We struggle to get 3-4 warlocks a raid... We had 2x T2 warlock pants drop and had to DE one :(
---
I joined a guild using CEPGP (which is basically DKP as far as I can tell) and I think it’s fantastic. It just works so well, there’s never been any drama about loot in the raids I’ve been in.
---
I'm going to try that later! Thx in advance :)
---
It’s a MMO*RPG*
---
How?
---
Definitely agree, but doesn't make a 65/35 split any less shitty.
---
It's a perfect example why faction specific transfers aren't working though. Transfer off Whitemane where Horde are dominant, to come to Arcanite Reaper to be totally outnumbered on a Low-Med Pop realm. You can't win, no matter the realm/faction it seems..
---
I mean, FAPs are what make 1vX realistic - and I can tell you a geared warrior with a FAP and reck up should win 1v2s and 1v3s.
---
These posts are more obnoxious then the devs saying this
---
They are a meme in PVE for dps (besides undead/demon), and people naturally brought that over to PVP.
---
Pallys are a support class through and through, so focusing dps just gives them slightly more offensive ability
---
You have a lot of free time on your hands so I'll just let you be.
---
Good luck in life.
---
I suppose heal myself, but it's not necessary.
---
Treants bane in 45 runs is pretty good luck I think based on hunters who have done 100+ tributes. People get one every 150-200 it seems.
---
Im well aware of how dope it looks though, I sold it when I found it on my hunter and kinda regret it now :(
---
Slow weapon speed is better for windfury though, since windfury is a flat 20% chance to proc and so you'd rather have your instant attacks like hamstring, bloodthirst, and whirlwind proc 4.0 seconds worth of attacks instead of 2.7 with treants bane.
---
Here’s a brown post:
---
Fuck off and deal cry baby
---
It dosnt always leash back is the thing I have at a lot just keep going
---
T2 SL locks are like raid bosses
---
Trust me dont do it.A friend of mine is Streaming fulltime for 6 years now and she starts to realy burn out.Its cool and chill at the start but when you HAVE TO play 10+hours a day to pay your bills playing is Not tun anymore because you dont play games that for fun anymore but because YOU HAVE TO.im a gamer myself lifelong but i woud never stream fulltime ever
---
Man you would hate RP-PvP.
---
we need MAX NAXX. It's what the body craves!
---
I love how every Alliance warlock is absolutely brimming with salt towards Forsaken
---
Yea, ofc, and all healing gear should go to main healer first and so on and so on. If you have +10 defense +10 strength +20 stamina already on, I don't see why you should get +10 def +13 str +23 stamina epic, I should just go farm dungeons instead right? Idk man, if it were open discussion then I wouldn't mind but when you have no say, don't know the reasoning and dont see the difference I don't know how long I can keep "hoping my turn comes"
---
I think I'm in the wrong here because loot council is literally made with the idea in mind to gear select individuals while 30 people dont get anything for months
---
I think you're unlucky, yeah. It does kind of depend on what they're looking for, but I've definitely noticed a lot of sub level 60 players and/or new players having a hard time finding groups for content. 
---
If you don't know what to do, then I'd just find good people to run with. I'd never kick someone for not knowing where to go, but I do get EXTREMELY aggravated when they don't listen to me if I tell them where to go, so I'd just go with the group and listen to them and you should be fine. If you're new, don't stop to drink by yourself or immediately after a pull, stick with the group, because as a tank we can't always look after every single player, so if you're by yourself and pull a pat you're probably gonna die.
---
Both are petty/shitty. The goal is the same: benefit (either from honor [which is more excusable, I agree] or to have "fun" being a cockbag because you lost out on loot) from disrupting other's gameplay for hours on end.
---
SELL SELL SELL!!!
---
Haha, if only that was what they said. I'm not sure what you're reading but even your boys are saying it's more about threat management than damage mitigation
---
yes in our premades this will matter in pugs ? you're getting the lolret dont heal or cleanse anyone special.
---
I did watch the video,  and I have 2 60s on Skeram ally,  so I live this situation every day.  I dont run to reddit and bitch about it though.  Instead I adapt my playstyle to minimize the negative effects of the current conditions.
---
The Armory used to be a component of TBC and beyond. It's great for guild applications and other review.
---
There was a 200 IQ alliance MC raid last night that snuck in through the burning steppes entrance, took off all their gear, and then jumped right on top of MC entrance. Only 1 corpse run for them and no honor for horde.
---
hell is endothermic
---
im leveling a druid as feral and most of my gear is agility/stam. At what point should I focus on more int/spell damage for lvl 60 since being Heart of the wild/NS seems the to do a little bit of everything.
---
This is a really good comment and ppl should listen to this guy. 
---
My friend had to explain to me why crit was better than hit after the soft cap because no BiS sites/guides seem to explain that very clearly.
---
I’m going to go ahead and assume you’re a 60 ganker who got killed by two lvl 50ish and are really mad that you got “zerged”
---
NO to everything in your post.
---
True enough, I mean you do you but you've effectively beaten the struggle of wow by throwing money at it, and people complain about buyable cosmetics lol
---
So that's why the alcohol sells so well.
---
And BG's are a 30 sec rez timer (or less depending on when you die) and you spawn with full HP.  When you die in the world sometimes you're waiting TO spawn and its hard to mount a comeback when you spawn and are  already at half health and mana. 
---
Last night I was able to get away sometimes and I ran into people 1v1 and lost, but couldn't help but think that I would have won that if I had full health and mana.  Like, they were clearly not good, but I've got no buffs and already starting with sub 2k health and mana. I'm sure they THINK they are good, which is why I can't wait for BG's where superior numbers means jack shit.
---
Back in TBC and Wrath days I was a tank both on warrior and Death Knight. I would BG all the time and be as annoying as possible. WSG is capture The flag, AB is king of the hill with 5 hills, and AV is a progression raid with PVP defenders, both sides pushing.
---
With tactical mastery, intercept to interrupt heals. AOE fear. Use that shield and armour to ignore melee DPS. Protect healers on your team, conc blow stun rogues trying to gank healers.
---
Pretend you are tanking a dungeon without threat where the DPS are just blasting everything. That's how I did PVP as a tank and i loved it.
---
Don't feel like paying for ghost simulator right now. I have 1-2 hours a day to play and right now I am dead 90% of the time, so I cancelled my subscription until BGs will be released. (Im playing since release and still didnt dinged with my solo char).
---
gay
---
It's not top 2% or top 6% I think your getting confused no  lifing a game with skill. 
---
 The people who can take the most are rank 4 those who play more this week will get rank 6, it had nothing to do with being top of anything.
---
Imagine thinking that your character's stats which are freely accessible by anyone through the game client could be considered private personal data.
---
No one screenshot my equipment or I'm reporting you to the EU internet police.
---
I'm saying the effectiveness of an alliance's 'smack' (particularly a prot warrior's) on the Skeram is as effective as Snoopy's 'smak' on Charlie Brown. You can tell by his expression that the 'smack' is ineffective and worthy of an eye-roll. But since I have to explain it that means that I was ineffective at translating my thoughts via these images and should try better next time.
---
I guess you wouldn't have to worry about Ninja looting
---
Ok . I advise you not to log in on shazz we be back 2x 40 in around 45. Warm greetings shazz horde eu
---
Please share what you find
---
I think it's something about her drunken eyes that are hypnotic.
---
You know it's absurd and everyone else does. Why is this even a question on Reddit? lol the mage is a bitch and should be kick for not providing his roll. Could you imagine me being like, "No stam buffs for my group unless you pay me 10s" no that's not how it works.
---
Luckily warlock can deal 3k in a single cast while being 3 times as tanky
---
Yea so I think this was kind of what I was trying to get at, at least from a dual wield perspective. Should I be concerned about that white hit damage after I hit my hit cap against bosses of 9% (or 6% with edgemasters), or is crit really what I should be hoping to pump out after I've hit that yellow hit range? 
---
A friend of mine who is a DW warrior has been pumping past the yellow hit cap as an orc just to get more white hits to land, but I wasn't sure if that was optimal or not, as opposed to just grabbing more crit gear or AP gear
---
I do lasher farming with about 5600 mana. I usually need to alternate between using inner focus/power infusion and some trinkets if I want to be efficient, since with my mana I'm often short one nova.
---
What if one also made the eastern and northern cliffs overlying the shimmering flats accessible as well. Allows for more questing space and perhaps another access point to Bloodsail Bay.
---
&gt; I wouldn't want to go back to being single, out of shape, and unemployed.
---
I'm actually quite content on my own, plus I got this little [monster](https://i.imgur.com/KS2RCuU.jpg) to keep me company.
---
&gt; out of shape
---
The beast prevents me from getting out of shape, great apartment dog, but she can still go on a walk for hours.
---
WoW grew its population for like the first 5 year until it peaked around 12m.
---
I'll be honest I haven't logged in or played since phase too dropped I could only get to level 44 with other commitments and theres no one for groups, plus I get killed everywhere 2 hits is not fun grave walking atm. Kinda hoping some balance comes back when people get back into normal things.
---
Agreed. Maybe if we form a 20 or 30 man raid we can take back the flight path and go from there. There is no point trying to stand your ground with anything less than 5/10 people.
---
imagine leveling in november lol you had 2 months
---

Wait wait wait. Someone catch me up please. What was announced?
---
Bro when this got posted in September i had the song and video in my mind the moment i woke up for daaaaays, I don't know why I love it so much
---
LFM BRD... SIKE!
---
Another very good point.
---
alliance herod
---
These posts got to go
---
It’s worth doing any and all chains you can find that are 55+. Many of them have dungeon components too which can be good for gearing. The rewards also have solid vendor prices
---
If you don't want to build it yourself you can also checkout /r/buildapcsales. Sometimes a decent prebuilt will show up there, just stick to the ones that are actually upvoted
---
What do you mean, I just explained how
---
Depends on the people. The officers in my guild I trust and they have been doing a good job distributing loot so it isn't inherently a bad system but sure it can be abused. However saying that you as a dps war not getting tier is an abuse is incorrect if that is what you are saying. Raid gear is distributed for pve purposes first and foremost and there are better pieces for dps warriors than tier. Tanks need to optimize threat and mitigation which allows dps to open up more in fights.
---
I think we found one of the Alliance players that killed that Azuregos, boys
---
When you have the 305+ ws, it's 6%.
---
I mean, what's there to do? I'm not particularly enchanted by the idea of farming mats for gold. I finished my pre-raid bis a few weeks ago, and am starting to finish up my raid bis. MC is still fun, and we're trying to polish our run up to get within the top 300 Alliance guilds, but there's not much else to do until December 10th.
---
It's not even really a PvP issue, it's just a content issue. Phase 2 really doesn't offer much content. Hopefully this'll be the first and last content lull for Classic.
---
None of those read enemy actions.
---
Next dumb excuse please.
---
This is probably true.  All I can do is try I guess.  I have worries about it being used in battlegrounds with flags also.  When a rogue goes into stealth or pops out of stealth to try to take a flag in AV or a tower in AV, or a Node in Alteric Valley.  People will get the notification and look at the flag to protect it.
---
And 15 years later the released the same game. And after adding multiple expansions and years of content. 
---
You expect it to have the same growth pattern?
---
That's messed up. Domo for Pres 2020. #skeram
---
cant you only get honor from 8 levels under you, Im 50 and done for now since i just get ganked by 60s all day cant progress at all
---
GL breaking spy and not DBM or a castbar mod
---
Yeah horde players are the most trash people.
---
 \&gt;The simple thing is that these servers are packed. And that’s basically it. 
---
So you take a plausible substantive argument and discard it only to replace it with "there's just more people".  That doesn't sound silly to you?
---
Oops, you are totally right.  I misread the story, I thought he won the first 2 and was feeling lucky haha.
---
Are you running disc? the +10% max mana makes a huge difference.
---
Can't you also lava jump to emp to avoid the full clear?
---
This.
---
So if I said all alliance players were limp twisted butt pirates that would be ok as well?
---
Nope.
---
If youre getting your ass kicked in pvp, dont complain, roll on a different server
---
Better than whining lmao
---
So you felt making the 52nd one would do the job the others failed to do.
---
As a Horde who leveled on Skeram, the early neutral zones really did feel anywhere from 55-45 to 60-40 in terms of population split. Then the free transfers opened and A few Alliance took them. Which made the imbalance worse, and the bank squads harder to fight against, so even more Alliance smartly left, and the cycle continues.
---
My gear breaks from tanking
---
A lot less ally on Skeram
---
A lot of the same one warlocks can do. Mara, dm east (probably?)
---
with mining/herb and the right gear you can do mauradon (not rotgrip though) and you can 2 man DM north tribute with a rogue
---
it depends on what spec you are. 
---
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8I1phbYpzY&amp;t=) is ebbnflow doing maraudon BUT you need to be caster spec to solo the princess. Ebbnflow has made other goldmaking as druid videos
---
Just to clarify, I only want edgemasters on when I'm versing bosses or lvl 63 enemies right? I think I remember reading that the hit% needed for yellow hits between 10 weapon skill against lvl 62 enemies is still around 6%. I have my devilsaur set for the moment, so I assumed I still wanted my bonus from that set on outside of boss fights. 
---
Was about to drop 400g on edgemasters today so I just wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing when buying them
---
Can't fix stupid
---
Orc + warlock = oarlock. I think the answer should be clear. 
---
Ok, for a serious answer, while I haven't palyed warlock, I've heard GREAT things about the class flavor/quests - as in it's some of the best in the game.
---
Dat you Swole Benji ?
---
Mages - how does Tempest Talisman compare to Star of Mystaria? How much +hit from gear does an arcane/frost raid spec mage need for MC/BWL?
---
Username checks out.
---
RIP dude. I think were around 10 clears or so, only seen 1 earthshaker and 1 sulfuras. No spinal
---
Always female Drama! Shattered Hand was littered with these back in the day!
---
I saw a video that I was in from the opposite factions perspective. I had /y Zug Zug in game. And alliance also saw zug zug. It might be a special circumstance that doesn't get turned into gibberish idk.
---
It takes time to recover from dying. No shit, Einstein. 
---
His reponse was equally stupid - a dumb jab at me for having no life (did I provoke him?) since I'm not up in arms about dying by PvP. 
---
My point is that dying doesn't throttle you back a level and/or doesn't make you lose items in your inventory.
---
Of course not!
---
No, I was just answering ur question.
---
Did you watch the video?  He didn't show up prepared, he blew 100g+ on a health buff (Flask of Titans) as a DPS warrior for killing a trivially easy loot piñata that most guilds (or at least ones where a GM would analyze the hell out of parses) 20-man.  That won't help him with a "personal best", it's literally a crutch in case he makes a mistake, which he shouldn't be doing.
---
Meanwhile he's neglecting other consumables and buffs that would help him squeeze out damage if he cared about parses.
---
I wonder what I'm supposed to do when I get ganked by a rogue with trinket on CD.
---
Should I clap that he hit all 3 buttons of his stun-lock rotation in a row?
---
If someone is too stupid to figure out the CoD system I don’t usually count it as a loss to just not do business with them.
---
Important and worth while Change. Not familiar with it but stands to reason
---
Thank you man!
---
The amount of mages that try to sheep me on my druid is disturbing.
---
So what if a server is 60/40 split? You just have the server at 80% capacity and have the other 20% sit in queue?
---
My memory and knowledge is 10 years old. I cannot trust any info I give concerning rep and rankings. As far as gearing goes you want max survivability. If I did a BG as non Mortal Strike I would go max survivability and focus on being annoying, versus trying to kill. If you can hamstring a rogue who is chasing a healer druid or priest, you did your job. DPS will eventually find and nuke them. If you can silence a mage enough that they start spamming you instead of the paladin, you did your job. If you can get a hunter to focus on wing clipping you and recalling their pet you did your job.
---
Tanking a BG is about griefing the opponent until they lose focus on getting rid of the warlock or shaman or who ever is 100x more dangerous than the cockroach tank.
---
Thanks bro I appreciate the link!!
---
I said that already. Just not in a whining tone, but alas, I know nothing of the struggles of the Alliance in p2.
---
That sounds like a bullshit addon tbqh
---
Meg is great! -Krenik
---
Yeah tbh this sounds like a lot of generalities. If everybody wanted this experience in the first place Blizzard wouldn't be pressured to move up Battlegrounds. Fact of the matter is that Vanilla and Classic are not the same experience. Player mentality has changed and we've got servers that are 3-4x their intended capacity.
---
In battlegrounds you will get the notification every 30 seconds. It won't be helpful.
---
Rhetorical question you fking boomer
---
gottem
---
What question did I ask?
---
Can someone use an AI to produce a thread complaining about spy? That might actually be worth reading for a laugh
---

---
Don't use Heroic strike or Cleave, not enough threat per rage. If you want to make your life easier you can use explosives on every pull to add agro, be an engineer and throw them in defensive stance. I personally would not stay with someone who was being such a douche. My playtime is too valuable and tanks are so in demand. I am not saying that you should be a prima donna but you don't need to take abuse
---
You'll need two completely different sets of gear, one for feral and one for healing.
---
Miss classic with this pserver trash
---
fair enough.
---
They do. But the majority of them are afk and don’t fight at all
---
Id say roll ally on Blameaux but you guys are pissing me off and i can't get to BRD/quest in wintersong without swaths of ally rolling through killing everything in their path and no horde backup..
---
If you have mining, id recommend farming it. It’ll save you gold and you’ll pick up other mats along the way that you can sell on the AH. Find a zone you can comfortably do rotations on and you can get 120 in a couple days with one or two rotations a day.
---
Uhhh, not always.  Betting red or black at a roulette table is basically just better on coin flips.
---
horde pvp pool was 4kish, while alliance was 2kish, so 66%ish horde right now
---
considering how heartseeker is alliance heavy, skeram clearly was ***at least*** a 55/45 server
---
Flask of Titans doesn't help a DPS warrior on parses.  Besides, any halfway competent guild (i.e. one that would be "going for parses") is split raiding Onyxia for extra loot.
---
Wow, gottem! Sick reply!
---
I guess it depends on how you set the range.  But yes at max it would be going off all the time.
---
In terms of efficiency leveling first aid once you're 60 is a good idea, even for druid. Fishing and cooking are more for making money or providing mats to your guild for consumables. Some fish are used for alchemy recipes as well.
---
In terms of fun, you'll be fine with any of them. You can make good cash with fishing, and it's kind of neat to live off the land in a way.
---
Don't worry, blizzard is expecting classic to be a dead game by then. Servers will handle just fine for the remaining 1k population on each side.
---
Yeah talking about fair fights on a pvp server is stupid, so is implying people should stop trying to grind honor just because they are on the more populated faction, but when people spit or teabag you after they just 10v1'd you...  I'm not even mad I'm just baffled.
---
Yeah I understand that, I'm mostly thinking if I do a quest and the reward is both an upgrade as feral or upgrade as caster which should I chose at my current level (40)
---
I don’t know if I’d say they are definitely better in PvP.  The issue I’d say is that pretty much every racial for Horde is good in PvP while only Dwarves/Gnomes have good PvP racial abilities.  Humans perception is meh in PvP while NE’s Shadowmeld can be good vs 1v1.  Both the Human and NE racial are somewhat ok in the beginning of a fight.  
---
Still in BG’s I’d take a Paladin over a Shaman any day.
---
Just wondering. Is evading of mobs considered exploiting? Is there any risk if Blizz deciding this is bannable?
---
Blameaux still 50 50 i think, sucks ass i feel as horde though..
---
Just curious how old you are?
---
COD one by one.
---
Why not just use github pages?
---
Yes but you won't be stealthed upon logging in.
---
If the server is 60/40. Only the 40 could be allowed on. Thus leaving out 20 people becaus OP wants balance servers.
---
I don't see how it could be worth it. On my server xmutes go for 10g. That would only be like 20g/ day.
---
thats not that much salt...
---
Sad but true.
---
This is why no changes is dumb. A simple change would make them viable.
---
Watch a video. 
---
If you jump to either side of the right pillar on land when a boss is near in water or in water when in land, they path all around the pond to get you, allowing multiple hits in and you block los so spells don’t go off like that bs from guy upstairs (Zulu jump down into water at boss fight start for him ).
---
This subreddit is full of complainers man. I play on deviate delight, the small rppvp server, and havent noticed anything different. Business as usual plus some extra pvp.
---
With how gear dependent warriors are, I bet they'd be a blast to level if you can funnel dope gear to them consistently. I bet rogue would be, too, to a lesser extent and I've always loved rogue.
---
If you log off while stealthed, it will be on cooldown when you log on. Same goes for shadowmeld and prowl.
---
Well rip lol
---
Level as Arms 31/20/0 till level 55. Always carry a shield and 1her for dungeon tanking and use a 2her while questing and solo leveling.
---
Try to fight the next mob before your leftover rage from a previous fight depletes if your health allows.
---
Solo questing as a warrior is tough. Either find friends, healers, or prepare to run a lot of dungeons to make up for the slow leveling. 
---
Warriors are heavily reliant on gear more than any class and it's no surprise that your weapon is by far the most important part of your gear. Getting a really good weapon early will make solo questing insanely easier. Getting a blue weapon upgrade from an old green can easily double your kill speed and quickly enhance your leveling experience.
---
I suggest using a guide on what weapons to look for around what levels. Always have the best weapon you can get as soon as you can get it.
---
As a tank, you'll have little trouble finding groups and you can often pick your own groups without any other warriors so you dont have to compete for gear. Make good use of this for gearing yourself.
---
Get into dungeons, dont brink other warriors, get great warrior gear and weapons to make your questing a million times easier.
---
Do NOOOOOT put a single fucking talent point into Protection until level 55+. Dont do it. Dont do it. Dont do it. You can tank and DPS in arms spec all the way to 55. Do not purposefully gimp yourself with Prot.
---
TBF those people had to level pally from 1-60 so they deserve SOME fun.
---
Yes, I will give it a proper go, hope blizztards (lmao) will not release BWL tomorrow tho
---
They'll make a better idiot.
---
Yeah ... no ... what?
---
You're always unflagged when landing in a non-contested zone, you are never flagged for PVP while in a flight path.
---
That's not fair to hit me with a second gold joke like that. My poor sides are now stuck with rex sickness
---
I don't know if it would have to be that complicated.  
---
If an opposing faction player is in not in combat with you or a member of your party/raid, limit what shows up in the combat log.
---
so first thing you want to do is reroll to an orc.
---
Then you use axes and only need 6% hit and dont gotta drop 500 + gold on edgemasters.
---
I got first place on windseeker horde side with 27k honor. 2nd place as 20k lol
---
Posted? inaccurate partial numbers months after launch? I know you trash horde need to keep it unbalanced because you couldn't take a 1v1 to save your life but comon, use a least a fraction of logic when you open your mouth. 
---
And if I said that a 60/40 is %50 more on one side you wouldn't be able to comprehend what that means anyway.
---
Coward! /s?
---
Gambling’s bad mmmmkay.  Don’t gambles.
---
The real question for me is:
---
Why does the log broadcast events for all players with such a large range.  If the log didn't broadcast this kind of information from enemy players, then the addon wouldn't work, and damage/threat meters would be unaffected
---
Im just gonna shit on your comment dont mind me if you look at chat logs its what 14:33pm when i log on i then kill him at 15:28pm 
---
Boy you didnt even think when you commented on this get in the bin
---
How would that be accurate?  Genuinely asking.
---
I post 100's of auctions per day of cloth/leather on four different characters.
---
dude, the Cannibalize part... LMAO
---
The main difference being that now alliance will hardly put any effort to kill the horde because all the pvpers will just sit in cities doinh BG's
---
Read my post again, I differentiated between the two.
---
"rather than getting smoked by every class I counter, despite outplaying them." comes across as super cringe btw.  I'm a rank 1 arena player in retail and one of the most important parts of pvp is understanding when you didnt play 100% and learn from dieing.  This applies to wpvp as well (with getting zergged excluded)
---
Nothing personal, but if you're tilted enough from pvp to make a reddit post about it its likely you're not outplaying in most of your deaths.  Carry consumables, get engineering, study your class, watch the wow duel where the warlocks dominate etc.  the general consensus is that a properly skilled/geared/specced warlock is far and above the BEST 1v1 class in the game.  imo stick it out commit to improving and you'll eventually shit on all of the bandwagon mages
---
not sure why you're getting hate. Seems people have trouble understanding other's opinions.
---
I swear, every alliance has a gigantic macro list of these OK BOOMER lines and spit macros. I was doing a fair 1v2 fight the other day against a warlock where I best him 8 times before he stopped trying to kill me. He left and came back about an hour later (I was farming gold) and he must have respecced into a pvp spec and bought consumables because he finally won a fight. Immediately before I could release came the chat log flood of OK BOOMER followed by a torrent of /spit. I didnt even initiate the first fight.
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
I'm in a similar situation, but I also know my friends and their extended friend group are flakey as fuck and some of them are already bored.  
---
So now I'm just stuck not playing at all, because what's the point really.
---
Nah man, ride or die with the cow people
---
I will literally poke your eyes out with my epeen sir
---
My dude, if you really didn't "care" you wouldn't have bothered posting here in the first place.. Like for real tho? You're in subreddit thats totally about the game
---
Exactly.. same reason why orc wars “waste” the money enchanting the boe 1handers that are BiS till raid weps
---
I hope I'm wrong.  
---
My main is on a PVE Server horde side, and I have a toon im leveling on the same server on Alliance side.  Very little interest in BGs in my guild on the Alliance side whereas the guild discord for my Horde toon was full of BG release date announcements and we are planning premade BG nights already.   There are even PVP specific guilds forming on the Horde side.
---
Not to mention historical data and experience backs me up.
---
But I do hope you are right.
---
I literally listen to it every day.
---
Met the creator's character in IF one day :D
---
What does offhand weapon speed matter for FuryW dps?
---
I've seen people say that a faster speed = more rage, but I thought rage gen was normalized to attack speed (otherwise how would two-handers ever get much rage?). It seems logical that faster speed = more crits, which = more Flurry procs, BUT with the faster speed, wouldn't Flurry also not last as long? Does Flurry tend to be up all the time when you're in a well-geared raid scenario?
---
They said early 2020 which I imagine is feb.
---
I got hit with a sapper charge shortly after sitting down to eat and drink when farming. Honestly it's my favorite death. Dude used an expensive ass consumable when I was half AFK while trying to recover. Could have just killed me for free.
---
I'm dumb and don't understand this joke, help? 
---
Also RIP poor kitty
---
Annihilator provides a proc that gives an additional -600 armor ontop of Sunder and Faerie Fire, that's why it's used.
---

There are maybe one or two per a region.
---
So immature.
---
Just a few weeks until you can get your teeth kicked in by premades in BGs. Hype!
---
No changes ^^^^:^^^^)
---
My guild has a bunch of bindings. I do jump runs often but don’t have much luck with crystals
---
What if you want the choice to have a dynamic world where its actually dangerous for everyone all the time and requires you to actually deal with the other faction rather than happily ignore them?
---
I swear PVE players are like vegans.
---
Yes but when you log in you're no longer in stealth.
---
That’s important to know. What’s the full context for what you want the macro to do?
---
will there be pvp to pve?
---
I moreso mean the pvpers will have a better way to honor grind than world pvp.
---
If the point of your guild raiding is for loot, leave that guild. Those are the guilds that will collapse halfway through a tier because all of the whiny bitches have all the gear they want, and they don't wanna raid anymore, leaving everyone else in the dirt until next raid comes out.
---
A good guild raids to prove themselves as the best. They distribute upgrades in order to increase clear times. They raid even when core leadership has gear, because they're in it for the glory. We're currently the fourth best guild on our server, and we're gunning for third. We'll probably try for a server first Nef kill when BWL is out, and we'll likely fail, but the attempt is what matters. Look for those kinds of guilds, because they're the ones that will be friendly and work to build you up, as they understand it's a team effort.
---
Pics online of him recently killing an elephant for sport
---
I agree but apparently even clarifying the display of an information of a feature implemented 3 months ago is meeting resistance by the no change folks and the numerous spergs playing this game.
---
Best thing about it I got the chest on my third arena run and the HoJ two days later.
---
Personally, if you're not enjoying it so far I doubt you'll find things much better at 60. I love this game especially as a fan of previous warcraft games (WC2 was the first computer game I ever played, and WC3 was a huge part of my youth). But for me, it was a blast exploring Elwynn, to taking down the Defias Gang, to fighting back the Blackrock Orcs in Redridge, to EVERYTHING to do with Duskwood (gotta be my favorite zone in the game), to getting geared in Scarlett Monastery (...probably not so easy to get to in P2), to killing and being killed by Horde in STV (probably not recommended in P2), to searing gorge (shit I'm starting to see the problem here) and finally fighting the scourge once again in WPL and EPL and now at 60 taking down Ony and MC every week and getting better at both of those, and so much more. 
---
My point is, getting ganked aside, if you're already not enjoying the game, I doubt that'll change much, so I wouldn't force it.
---
Sure but you don't log in that way. Logging in takes you out of stealth (I think for some reason logging in is an action that breaks stealth) and puts it on cd.
---
Only costs about 50g to level alch to 275. One of my newer alts is 32 and another is 25
---
I would 100 percent have left the guild in support of that shadow priest and I wouldnt want to be in that guild anyway.
---
Ask your brother to run you and your wife through dungeons?
---
&gt; 100g per craft is not fair at all when someone is offering for free.
---
What an insanely absurd logic. So, by your definition, 100 people who live off their crops, putting effort and their entire lives into it, are total dicks when they complain that some guy who has another source of income and won't suffer offering crops for free just for the sake of his popularity and ego, shitting on those other people for whom it's one of the only sources of income? And not just that, it would be 'fair' for those 100 people to go fuck themselves because this one egotistical prick is offering things for free? What kind of backwards logic is that?
---
Especially in Alterac. How easy it is to cap the horde towers, run up and cap. Same with the Horde base, no bridge, dead zones everywhere.
---
True dat
---
&gt;  It might be the case that the new client simply broadcasts way too much than necessary.
---
Bingo.  The logs are likely just too verbose.  I don't see why they can't trim the fat with the goal of breaking only this addon.  OPs suggestion is a good one, but we don't know what other client systems are listening for that broadcasted information or reading the logs.  If there are systems that need that data, then it's just a question of how they can get that data from a source that isn't the logs that addons can read.
---
Then people can just read the combat log and achieve nearly the exact same results.
---
I did the pvp thing in Vanilla.     
---
And while I have some fond memories of that I realized very early on that I can no longer nolife it up like that anymore (job, sociallife, oldmanhealth). So I rolled pve because pvp would be pure aids to my limited playing time.
---
That's the unfortunate reality that I am beginning to accept. Not sure how I'm going to get gold for mount now that I can't farm alone for more than 10 minutes.
---
Your mom's a salty alliance player after she took my load..
---
My bad, thought you were being condescending
---
so we should all roll horde with no alliance to play with?
---
Automated squelching/banning is just stupid. Asmongold made a video about it when it first came out. He said wow is a great and fun game or something like that in chat and then had his viewers spam report him. He was almost immediately squelched due to the number of reports. It's a system that shouldn't exist.
---
Ye
---
You forgot the part where the UD Mage does a /sit /stand emote on the face of the ded alliance hunter.
---
Meanwhile on Zandalar tribe there are more alliance than horde in Undercity at any given time
---
Price is very server dependent, but I think a few general facts will hold true.  
---
The lowest price will yoyo.  Some days and times of days it might be X, another time of day you might see a couple stacks for 20s more, or 20s less.   Since it is a commodity, some people will buy low and resell later high, so price will only yoyo so much, and margins for reselling are usually thin since you pay AH cut.  It's time consuming so the G/hr isn't great, either, so its not a perfectly stable market. 
---
You don't always need to undercut.  If the current low price is lower than general, you can probably post it for closer to normal price minus a tiny bit to give yourself a good chance of selling and not losing deposit. 
---
Auctioneer and Auctionator are both good addons that will help you monitor pricing.  TSM is sorta Duplo to the Lego Technics of the first two mods, so I don't recommend TSM.  I don't use a all the auctionator features, but between auctioneer and auctionator there are good tools.
---
I guess I was considering the time aspect but I'm a more casual, it does sound like a decent long term investment
---
With addon you can see his role in his guild. 
---
If it says CL or officer, contact GM and hang him
---
&gt;He refuses to sell lemonade to you, telling you to fix your own stuff.
---
Except your example is twisting the whole situation. People selling recipe to those who are totally okay paying something for it are not 'refusing' something to customers.
---
Our guild had gotten to the point where there was so much drama under the bridge that we were pretty much close to being done by this point, which sucked, because the guild had a good run, and for the most part, was a great guild, with awesome people, and great rep on our server.  But anyway, but here's how it went down:
---
A little while after ICC came out and people knew strats and had a little gear, our 10man groups were competing with each other for players, esp healers, and the ones from my group were always getting poached by the other groups, so I rolled a shaman and lvl'd etc.  We got a new tank, and he hadn't played since vanilla or something, and was nervous about doing it.  We spent a long time, wiping, letting him learn his class, with some of the rest helping as we went with tips, gearing him out, sometimes waiting an hour for him to log on.  No biggie, my group was very casual and goofy, so, even if we were wiping, we were still progressing and having a lot of fun.  Everyone got pretty geared for 25mans, etc. and we were all close friends on fb and blah blah.  
---
Fast forward to beginning of Cata. That tank, who I'd been pretty close to (platonic), decides to run his own group and asks me if I'd be upset if he ran it, my healer would always have a spot, it would be the same level of casualness, etc etc. Of course I didn't mind.  We were mostly the same people, and none of us was ever any real leader, besides me just putting the groups together, making sure the spots were filled, reading strats so we can improve, etc, which I really would've mostly done if I didn't have my own group.  Well, shaman were pretty suck healers at the beginning of cata, so he sat me on some of the harder to heal fights, and said he would bring me into harder fights when I was better geared and the group was more experienced at the fights, no problem.  I sat in on vent and helped with strats since my main was way ahead of this group.
---
But he replaced me perm w/ a guy he liked, not platonic.  I couldn't even be on a wait list, or even dps! He only took the cute boys that he liked.  This wasn't a secret; the flirting in raid, vent, etc.  (plus, most people in the guild knew who the 'cute boys' were, and they were more likely to get spots/loot, and this is probably one of the things that killed the guild, eventually)   I didn't even try to start or join another 10-man (in that guild/server, my main was elsewhere by that time). He apologized about a year or so later, and I ofc forgave him, but that's the biggest drama I've personally been involved in.  I was fuckin pissed.  Mostly because my feelings were hurt.
---
note: when i say 'cute boys,' I'm talkin about adults, not kids.  guild was 18+ and most of us were 21+.
---
I gave up at 57
---
Oof, well, at least youre honest about it lol
---
Anyone know if the lashers are immune to nature damage?  Wondering if my old Chained Essence of Eranikus would be useful at all.
---
If you log off in stealth, it will be on cooldown and you will be unstealthed when you log back in.
---
Why make this comment without saying the same of the add-on.
---
No, it's not worth it. 
---
Sure, it's a great axe, and it's got probably the best effect of any pre-raid axe you can get, but there's better raid options (Quel'serar) that are the same cost and/or free if you farm the book yourself (and that takes weeks, depends on whether or not you want to do it). I am an axesmith on my server, and I do have the Annihilator recipe, and I've never once made one, if that tells you how popular it is. 
---
Most of those craftable weapons/items that require a ton of Arcanite bars generally aren't worth it. I'm one of the top blacksmiths on my server, and I've made 2 Heartseekers, 0 Arcanite Reaper's, and 0 Annihilators, if you want to get an idea of how in demand they are. You're just better off using Mirah's Song until you get a raid quality weapon.
---
We have 5 tanks in our guild when doing mc, none of has this. And we one shot mc and ony ez. For the mats it’s require? Add a little more you can get a lion heart helm which is bis for fury warrior period no matter what phase. Is the -600 armor good to have? Sure it’s great. Is it needed? Is it worth that much mats? Nah, i don’t think so.
---
Blaumeux is a dead server for alliance. Get over it reroll or quit
---
Heartseeker would like a word
---
Yeah my main can’t really progress behind raiding and I really enjoy the early leveling experience so 1-35 is pretty fun, especially bankrolling OP gear on them. I got my ww axe on my warr at 30 and put crusader on it xD
---
51 threads is way too little since that's clearly a very small percentage of the playerbase.
---
if "100% less people are playing" then that means 0 people are playing. thats wrong
---

I'm alliance on pagle. Still enjoying classic.
---
Who really fucking cares?  Apparently not the people making these posts. This mod throws surprise tactics out the window, if you are dense enough to believe "I haven't been affected, this doesn't affect me therefore this mod is not a problem" then you probably can't see beyond your own nose.
---
If this GM is anything like countless leaders I've played with before he may have just done it to solve the problem fast. Bringing it up as a concern privately later may change things, especially if he's unaware of the private messages sent to OP
---
PVE server players can do wpvp just fine if they want to. And in fact, they do.
---
Blaumeux definitely not 50/50. Just run to BRM as alliance and you’ll see
---
&gt;No bitch what happened was you killed me like I kill a lowbie boar outside Orgrimmar and I couldn't do shit about it. I want to get to 60 so I can kill your sorry ass but I can't because I'm a walking free kill for you honor farmers.
---
LOL, preach brother!!!
---
I remember someone telling me numbers dont matter in this game. Holy shit were they ever wrong.
---
I'm so happy on Sunwell.
---
Except you can target people from the spy list and if you’re a class with a pet you can have your pet attack them so you’ll know exactly where they are. If you can do this as the rogue stealths the pet will just attack them through stealth. I’m pretty sure other ranged classes can cast on you as well from the spy pop-up but can’t confirm but I feel like I’ve had it happen to me before.  It’s completely busted. Can’t wait for it to ruin BGs as well.
---
If you can’t Rez because you are getting spawn camped, when the Rez timer keeps increasing, or when the majority of your play time starts to resemble a ghost running simulator then yes, it does make sense. 
---
You also say that like everyone went into playing on a pvp server with a solid understanding that it can be like it is. People talked up pvp a lot pre-launch and glorified it, blizzard had an opportunity to even out servers from jump and didn’t. At this point it is what it is.
---
1: yes. u dont get exp
---
2: i know you cant make more than X levels per week, according to your level. 
---
3: Cross server, nope. link ?
---
4: No, no, no. This is not pvp. Corpse Camping is not pvp. /noskill /paperchamps
---
It would be a little silly if you "got to target an enemy player ... and you're not targeting them".  You have never needed to be able to see the player to target them.  Try actually pressing your tab key once in a while and you'll see you can target things behind walls.
---
Found the no life that has only one way of gaining enjoyment in life: ruining someone else's fun in WoW because all they have in life is WoW and they are jealous of everyone and anyone they see.
---
You wont dominate everything other than spriest, mages flat out lose to warlocks unless there a huge skill/gear disparity and hunters also give you a hard time.  
---
What you have going on right now is grass is greener on the other side syndrome. Mages are able to outrun gankers, thats true, but I wouldnt say theyre the best pvp class, its easily demo lock in 1v1s and in groups, theyre more annoying than any others because of their cc+dots.
---
No, it's not. You won't have the total server population logging in at the same time. Say, for simple numbers, server max is 100 people, and the queue is 60A and 40H. Currently, there are 60A and 40H logged in. 
---
If an Alliance logs out, the Horde nearest to the front of the queue gets let in. 59A:41H. Keep going until it's 50:50 A/H logged in, and then replace the faction players that log out with the same faction's players in queue.
---
If a horde logs out, let another horde in, ratio stays the same.
---
Longer queue on Shazzrah is the TLDR :)
---
Try adding "Cc" to your friends list and see if it shows up. There's a chance it's on other faction as well, but it's worth a try.
---
&gt;Half the annoying people I wanna kill are on my own faction
---
True
---
Haha
---
Fellow multiboxer! Awesome video and nice too see some of our community here. I have the same setup except I have a warrior instead of Druid.
---
Got a question, though. At 10:45 how did you start Rain of Fire without clicking with your mouse where on the ground to cast it? Cuz it looks like you do it with a single key-bind?
---
Wut ? i just came 2 times today to SW &gt; BRD &gt; SW &gt; BRD. wut wut ?
---
Bullshit, if a burglar can get hurt in your home and Sue your ass and win. Then I don't see how this is "crazy".
---
Should have rolled pve
---
Benediction is suppose to be an even server. I spend 30 minutes trying to get down the road in felwood because every inch was camped. I came from wintersprng where everlook was so thoroughly camped they killed all of the guards. Earlier that same day I left wpl and epl because I was being ganked by teams of 60s every 5 minutes or less. 
---
But you're right, only horde do it lol.
---
Should try to get in the habit of using your 30 min cds more often.
---
Any time there's a good opportunity, hit it.
---
Well then you used a noun as an adjective but whatever
---
&gt; with no clear advantage for you
---
I don't know how you aren't getting this because people have said it already.  Denying them is a win for your faction.  It's a PvP server.  People that opted into this understand the faction war.  I think it's pretty cool to see that faction war in full effect. I normally don't say this, but if this is something that bothers you...then you should just play on a PvE server.
---
no u can see how much honor you made each day.
---
&gt; There's a reason the top speed clears and top performing guilds rarely have enh/ele shamans. i'll defer to them.
---
I'm deferring to them as should you unless you have math to prove otherwise or you can prove your guild is a top speed guild with shamans. Thanks.
---
That’s been said since vanilla. Crazy how things stick lol. 
---
Forums have always been the vocal minority. Which is why everyone was shocked when then listened.
---
I should install it for that alone.  I hate people who put special characters in their names - not because it makes targeting difficult, but because it's not aesthetically pleasing.

On Rag it's gonna vary a lot depending on where they get to stand and if they get knocked around a lot.  I'm guessing other casters in their class know the "good" spots and he's swimming out on his own doing his best impression of a pinball.
---
On Rag I know where to stand such that even if I get hit by a knockback from rag(either on me or anyone around me) I don't even move(my cast doesn't even get interupted).  Other casters that don't would generally do at least half the damage I would.
---
Between 6pm and 10ish PM server
---
I need the extended  version of this
---
U gotta utilize your void walker sacrifice more for a defensive cd
---
&gt; At that juncture, I would honestly recommend a different game for you because this attitude on classic doesn’t hold up.
---
Uh there are tons of classes and specs one can play other than ele shamans/retadins/enh shammies
---
You still have quite a lot of damage. It's bad solo because it's pretty hard to deal with enemies even 1 level higher as well as more than 1 mob at a time (until you get blade flurry from combat tree in your 30s). 
---
Focus on fighting mobs 1-2 levels lower than you. This is especially good for rogues and you'll find it much more efficient unless you have pretty strong gear. This works better because effectiveness of auto attacks both with and against you scale proportional to level. You'll get far less Dodge/miss/party and you'll Dodge more yourself. Most of your damage is auto attacks especially starting around 40.
---
Please show me the screenshot where this add-on is giving you the exact coordinates of a stealthed player. 
---
&gt;This addon is doing something inhuman and automated as all fuck
---
You mean just like nearly all other useful add-ons? DBM, damage meters, auctioneer, etc. all do things that are "inhuman" but I don't see you calling for them to be banned.
---
no worries man, im glad you liked it. Don't forget to give it a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button.
---
I just finished leveling up my cooking and alchemy and had nothing else to do with it....i wouldn't say it makes me a good person, that's pushing it a bit far mate. 
---
I was just looking to brighten someones gaming experience and it seemed to of worked.
---
lōl you r probably too sentimental and keep too much garbage
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. But I have also had fun with wpvp and had some decent 1v1s with other level 60's. I don't like 40 man raid wpvp, because people don't know what to do, get dks and spoil the fun.
---
**Cars have got to go**
---
 I didn't want to have it. Must have came with inheritance or something. With that being said, I just gained an advantage by it getting me to the point of destination much faster. I don't want this advantage and it has no place in life.
---
You can't tab target someone who is far enough behind you that they are not on your screen.
---
BGs end. Corpse camping stops when you log onto an alt.
---
Pallys die every time without bubble. It’s funny how every pally thinks they’re the exception
---
OK, so I crunched the numbers with my monkey math.  I really wanted horde to come out with horrible numbers but it won't be too bad for them.  I suspect they'll have a 10-20 min que while alliance is near instant.
---
per [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) (all level 60 raiders logged to warcraftlogs, so semiserious players)
---
all us realms total - 124,345
---
pvp realms total - 108,223
---
pvp realm horde - 62,539
---
pvp realm alliance - 45,684
---
pve realms total - 16,122
---
pve realm horde - 5,801
---
pve realm alliance - 10,321
---
total horde 68,340
---
total alliance 56,005
---
now if we adjust the numbers by assuming pvp players are 5% more likely to que for BGs and pve players are 5% less likely (which i think is a fair assumption, in fact its probably higher), i come to a ratio of 1.23 horde players queing per alliance player.  so horde will basically have to wait a 1/4 of the length of a BG.  so 5-10-15 min.  somewhere in that range.  they will definitely have a queue.  of course this is all my fat fingered monkey math.
---
I like to imagine the hunter feigned death in this situation
---
This has a very simple fix that most alliance guilds are already strategizing for. Hold AQ hostage until more horde leave the server. Vice versa for the ones dominated by alliance. If you don't think these talks are already taking place I have a bridge to sell you.
---
I’m only bummed I don’t have any more paid time off so i can level an alt lol
---
I planed to play a warlock for a free mount and requested a week off for classic the moment it was announced.

i started a week ago , dont play a lot, and im 26 right now. game is fun, i like pvp , also when 60s pvp in my area i go with them and spectate is funny! i dont want to rush 60 i enjoy playin without even progressing hehe

Cheers buddy! Kind words indeed.

Yeah ive been alliance herod since release and its a massive difference pre honor to post honor release. And those that are on are just sitting on IF cause no one wants to do anything out in the world.

idk how you read my comment and then came up with that as your comment. a hunter will never drink more than you rhealer. if the healers need mana the raid will stop to drink otherwise they won't but you're fine anyways because you shouldn't be using more mana than the healers.
---
&gt;five minutes later it might be 40 horde vs 80 alliance.
---
The guild I'm in bring 3-4 raids of ppl. 1 pulls the other 2-3 deal with pvp
---
That’s not a balanced server
---
No ones hitting 3k shadow bolts in SL unless they’re using crit gear (which is ridiculous) with power infused active.
---
Transfered off skeram because its like 80% horde, not very fun for alliance to be corpse camped by groups of bored players double your level.
---
What? No.
---
People would bail so hard.
---
They're most likely gonna just drop BC onto the current Classic experience, because it's basically free money, very little dev time as they already have all of/most of the content.
---
Shocking i know ! Can you believe they just sent them back because they didn't know who i  was....crazy.
---
Which is ironic because it was the opposite pre-launch.
---
"Oh you'll be leveling *PvE* \*scoffs\* let me tell you about all the benefits and what you're missing out on by not playing PvP and the *true* Classic experience"
---
Hey, that’s my server! And I’ve run some content with Old Men Gaming! Very interesting to watch this play our, I’m sad I wasn’t on last night to see it live
---
When you close your game out of frustration due to being ganked, you suddenly have too much time you happily spend on reddit.
---
You must of been eaten by an undead recently &lt;3 chill have some conjured mage food
---
I just use mana potions
---
Go play on Herod, Faerlina, Whitemane, Skeram, Stalag, etc as alliance and youll be on the complaining bandwagon.
---
Onra, leader of Norrath Classic on Sulfuras here.
---
An Alliance PUG got the tag on Azuregos, but the Horde wiped 99% of the Alliance right before the kill. Most of the Alliance left after that because there were hundreds of Horde still alive. The Raid Leader/Master Looter (Bigmatt) of the raid that got the tag had it set to Master Looter and there were still hundreds of Horde AoEing on top of the body and we attempted to push back to the corpse with \~100 remaining Alliance and were wiped several times. The raid with the tag spent the next 2 hours trying to revive all at the same time and BoP/Heal the Master Looter, but the Horde made /target macros on him and instantly killed him every time.
---
Eventually, a group of Eminence, Bronzebeard, Norrath Classic, and others made a raid force to attempt to push back the 74 remaining Horde on the corpse that were still going strong with AoEs and macros 2 hours later. We pushed in hard and wiped all the dedicated Horde members and allowed the other raid with the tag to finally be able to loot.
---
Great fun all!

---
the amount of drama i've had in my guild since we started classic is unreal. and it's always the older guys that are married with families and shit causing the drama. man-children indeed.
---
Here on my non PvP server Alliance race over to Azuresong to have other Alliance pull mobs into our fight, and then when Horde get there first they actually help each other secure the kill to make sure Alliance don't have a chance to get it.
---
Rhok'delar uses what is referred to as the "Clipped" rotation. Meaning you cast Aimed Shot as soon as it comes off CD regardless.
---
I agree with you
---
The demographic cross-section of World of Warcraft players and Reddit leans very heavily between toxic internet trolls, and people on the spectrum. The truth is you can't take anything on this sub (or any sub really) seriously. Just enjoy the reddit voyeurism :)
---
Agree, we outnumber alliance slightly but alliance is controlling most zones. Oh gee we control BRM, hordes a bunch of pussies from my experience on Blameaux. Disappointing really
---
Sixtyupgrades
---
Are you guys just playing it up or do you think there is some intrinsic property of being bad at pvp for those who chose horde.
---
That’s like having orgasms at the same time. Cool stuff.
---
it's amusing and I liked the post
---
I believe it you who is the bitch
---
classic is not connected to retail at all....you'd need a retail account,which means leveling 1-50,to go to shadowlands.
---
95% of the wpvp experience is just ganks and getting griefed. Now with phase 2 out its worse because the min/max hyper nerds are roaming in packs and camping fps/boats/zepps. Bgs will only divide these people into 10 man premades but at least youll have a chance to play the game again, and still a better chance to have decent pvp fights in WSG.
---
Yes it can. Block add-ons from reading entries in the combat log from players of the opposing faction unless it targets/damages/impacts someone in your raid/party. There. Fixed. Damage meters still work, spy doesn't.
---
well "cute" isn't a word i was expecting to read on this post ! thanks?
---
It will after 5 hours
---
This is why u have group loot on for the outside world bosses. It instantly rewards. You just need to make sure you trust people because you can still do dkp or loot council as long as people have warning about it before the kill happens.
---
Alrighty then.
---
I tried to convince my friends to go Alliance for this very reason.  They wouldn't hear it.  I was literally unkillable on my full t2 paladin back in vanilla when I had a geared warrior to heal.  I cant even imagine how unfair full t3 would have been.
---
It’s not psychology it’s subverting the the functionality of the voting system
---
That'd be a pretty cool experience
---
Unemployment and celibacy exist for people like you.
---
Our group got too far from the master looter as we cleared adds to ragnaros. Epic BoE drops and like usual everyone starts passing so the one of the officers can get it and give it to the master looter. Everyone except one guy who wins and immediately equips. 
---
Rage like none other. He claims he thought it was a free roll (despite being a regular and seeing how loot has worked for month), other players of the same class want him booted, and an all around shitstorm that took way too long to calm down.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I did the rank grind in fucking vanilla wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who did the rank grind ten years ago. Me, not you. The most ranks ever on this game. The guy who did the rank grind. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
&gt; Logging off is legit your best option in that situation.
---
Except if wouldnt have any impact, as other players are still going to be popping in and getting ganked, so the gankers are going to stick around.  So you log off for 5-10 minutes, come back, and nothing has changed.  There really isnt any solution for this situation except to either give up for a loooong while, try calling in help, or roll on a new server.
---
I do not recall what time that stuff updates, but in classic it was always at some irregular, weird time of day. It also isn't relevant as it's not directly reflective of what you'll end up getting on Tuesday. Which is the only day that actually matters.
---
Then go SM ruin, spam corruption and slam kids with nightfall procs.
---
I think SMorc is a big reason for the imbalance. They're a Taiwanese guild, so their play times don't always reflect peak NA play time. There's still an imbalance, but it's not too bad. I like it honestly, because it just means there's more horde to hunt.
---
honestly,i'd let em bail,if people dont like retail who cares. classic was nothing more but a money scheme,and to at least save their IP but its a known fact pirate servers are still alive and kicking. if people want to go back to using illegal content,i say let em and good riddance.
---
There aint much to do in the game.
---
Most Raids are on "farm status", means a 2-3hours per week for loot.
---
What else can you do? Farm gold for what? Farm Honor, okay. 
---
Problem with Honor farming is, there isnt any "PvP Zone" to meet up. Its more about 5v1 ganking players on their way to a dungeon.
---
You cant raid citys cause of dishonorable kills. 
---
I wish there were "Flight-Masters" that could be conquerered by a Faction. Something to fight for.
---
I have 15HKs and spend most of my time fishing or raiding, but yeah okay.
---
I'm still grinding.. took a week off for Sunwell's launch. But will probably sneak back in soon. Lvl 44 lol
---
There are cross server BGs in classic
---
It was around 1am I think server time.
---
you can uninstall it if you dont want to use it. im going through classic without any quest addons. im just finding quests or remembering them from the past
---
Some NE rogue tried to gank me in Hinterlands, wasn't all too stealthy about it, started spamming the 'back to retail' stuff before the fight was over.  I had her almost dead when my wife, a stealthed kitty druid, pulled her opener on her and killed her.  My wife spammed the laugh macro before the rogue released.
---
Something, something ... checks you can't cash.
---
He sounded like he must’ve been salty after getting killed 8 times. He just wanted revenge. But yeah a lot of people are gonna be doing that since it’s the only way to really trash talk cross faction
---
There's some RNG on how many fireballs you eat.  This can either kill you and obviously cut your DPS by a large % for the total fight, or mean you're using time for two full bandages vs others who are just spamming the entire time. 
---
There's not a whole lot for casters to do here, spam bolts, stay alive.
---
they meant the op was 100% correct that less people are playing.....
---
Ppl could just decide to stop playing. Or reroll on a diff server
---
Level 38 Warlock, Alliance on a Horde dominated server (65%-35%) bored of SM, currently questing in STV and AH but looking for somewhere new to explore. Where should I go next? Desolace, Badlands seem like the places to be at this point.
---
Except its really hard to find a brd group because noone wants to waste 1 hour to get there. Thank you for this brilliant advice though.
---
So my point stands. The add-on adds functionality that isn't in the game. 
---
You tried to say I don't understand it's functionality at all, but I do. I just proved to you that I do and all of your paragraph about /tar does not change the fact that the Spy add-on let's you have mouse over targeting that is otherwise impossible to have in WoW and gives an unfair advantage to those that have it over those that do not.
---
That's why they call us "horde" and not "single guy by himself".
---
This is why i dont play classic
---
Yeah I get sad whenever I am running to a dungeon and a lone guy standing outside says he needs a group :( . The other week I felt bad and ran the guy through the dungeon on my 60 lol
---
Isn't that a logical fallacy though? I mean drop chance isn't cumulative is it? So not seeing it drop once in 50 runs isn't impossible, just unlikely. People win the lottery and that's worse odds.
---
&gt;taking NS over EM
---
But you didn't get a chance to do the ultimate combo of fire nova -&gt; iron grenade -&gt; EMCL
---
It will not. Alliance are out - dropping like flies. 200 horde on the ramp this week, probably 400 next.  No point. In a month you'll all just be inspecting each other :P We can only be Blizzard's mistake child while getting abused by grief guilds for so long.
---
That's great! Thank you :D
---
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
---
What's the manly tactic here... dying?
---
&gt; I'm sorry you chose the objectively worse pvp faction due to racials
---
It's becoming super easy to spot the fucking noobs
---
Everytime I see one of these whiny posts I'm like oh no classic is dead. Then I log on and have the time of my life. It's just the whiny ones leaving the game. This is why classic is great because it drives away the unfit.
---
lol what?
---
Thanks all! Your comments have confirmed my suspicion that it’s not a practical use of gold at the moment. I’m going to sell the mats I’ve gathered and put it towards a quel’serrar. 
---
In the short term, Mirah’s song seems like the unanimous pre bis.
---
This doesn't look fun at all. It's just mage aoe while some dork types in caps "AOE THE FUCKING CAVE".
---
I am not positive if it will be like this now, but back in vanilla, you got 50 rep for wins when you queued from cities, and 75 rep when you went to the zones to queue.
---
What’s that cast bar add on? The one going on during cannibalize that factored in latency?
---
You guys should have left that guild ,cant believe you stayed...and that fucker keeps harassing shadow priest who deserved the item ? Awful,just awful
---
the fun is on pve servers
---
&gt;Almost every top post has some hidden or not-so-hidden aspect of heavy alliance bias.
---
Top posts of the past week
---
1: Southpark reference

2: Joke that alliance dies a lot

3: Guy killed popular streamer

I too misread that. xD
---
Anything to level the playing field since you can't compete!
---
Yeah this subreddit is 90% pussies
---
So u want to pvp but u dont want ppl to play alliance hmm makes sense
---
What do you mean? It's still fucking like this.
---
Look at all the comments in this thread calling OP a pussy/ a carebear
---
And to answer your question, yes. With targeted aoe (like blizzard or rain of fire) you can target yourself in a macro.
---
So it would look like /cast \[target=player\] Rain of Fire
---
What PvP said for the first few weeks: LOL. You are gonna be on a DEAD PVE SERVER! IT IS GONNA BE DEAD IDIOT! Dont you understand that it is going to be filled with normies that are going to quit at level 20.
---
This is a huge pain, but I can't lie it also gets your blood pumping.
---
Raid gets UBRS fire res buff, and that small run back to MC can be very tense.
---
Im with ya there.  That is why whenever I see someone obviously trying to quest I leave them alone.  I don't want people throwing up their hands in frustration and just quitting the game
---
You are not even tagged for pvp in the capital wdym.
---
that's cuz Incendius is pretty well-balanced as far as servers go, it's a 55-45 balance horde to alliance
---
60 Undead holy/disc Priest on Blaumeux, being out alone in the world is difficult for our class, but it's nowhere as bad as that video. It's not even bad at all! Our server is pretty close to 50/50 split. Yeah, I'm sure some people are going to say I'm biased since I'm Horde, but I don't understand why people get so flustered at dying to wpvp. It happens to all of us.
---
Noone is unsubbing who wouldn’t have unsubbed anyway.
---
AV is notoriously Ally-favoured.
---
haha this is on point, CHEERS
---
Doubtful the stat still holds true if you limit it to lvl 60s only.
---
thx
---
Really just depends on how you go about leveling and what type of sever you play on. I leveled to 60 Drain Tanking usually fighting mobs equal level or lower so, i could take on 2-3 at once. I regret not putting 5/5 into suppression though since i play on a PVP sever and had a lot of exchanges where a higher level Horde would resist my fear.
---
That's because Stalagg was like a 5:1 Horde:Alliance ratio lol
---
Lmao that’s exactly what I mean, you people are too dull. Link me a video of you “competing” with a 40 man raid solo and I’ll listen to your thoughts on this.
---
This gonna be the horde waiting in queue for bgs
---
I am basically just raid logging until BGs
---
I'm out in searing gorge / burning steppes every night. It's true there are times where alliance guilds can organize but most the time its like 5 different packs of horde roaming around killing 1-2 alliance at a time.
---
My issue with attempting these runs wasn't the bosses, but the Satyr packs in the Hydro room. How do you kill avoid these while using that pathing strat on Hydro/Zev etc.?
---
I've seen a few videos of Spriests doing it, but I really struggled as Disc.
---
/cast Berserker Stance  
---
/cast Intercept  
---
2. You still don’t know how the honor system works. I’ll let you research that on your own.
---
3. “Q: Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live?
---
A: Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you’ll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan.”
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090136/world-of-warcraft-classic-faq-what-you-need-to-know
---
Blizzard confirmed this themselves. It was a patch 1.12 feature so it was in vanilla, contrary to what many people think, and it will be in classic at launch of bgs according to blizzard.
---
Obviously this link isn’t updated to mention that bgs will be released prior to phase 3. But the rest of the information still holds true.
---
4. PVP literally stands for Player versus Player. I never said it was “fair” or “fun” or “honorable”. But it is pvp, whether you like it or not.
---
Judging by pvp pool sizes, it's 55:45.
---
Fuck yeah, cool shit man. Always cool to find someone with similar interests
---
If they can do this and it would have no impact on damage meters or any other important gameplay I'd be all for it.
---
Especially seeing as how I'm a rogue. I can't be the sneaky boi I was hoping I could be.
---
wholesome
---
Tournies are a little different because you can prepare for an opponent with impunity, world PvP you don't have that chance. But yea, a prepared warlock should beat anyone 1v1.
---
@OP, you level 39 and you probably aren't very skilled. Both your character and your skills will improve, and you'll be fine at 60. 
---
Mages are way better than warlock in large scale battles due to their AoE damage and snares, and iceblock. Warlocks are kings of 1v1 and small engagements.
---
"I get dumpstered in world PVP, but there is no way I will get dumpstered by pre-mades in BGs!"
---
Nah, there's been plenty of people justifying it as "I already paid, I'm not giving them more by still playing!" I have friends who got suckered into the 6 month sub who use that justification.
---
Exalted with BG factions is attainable for almost everyone. It's less of a grind than Wintersaber or Bloodsail rep, for sure.  AV rep is probably the easiest, as the BG is basically a quest zone and most of the quests are repeatable and grant rep.
---
You don't need hit%, weapon skill, or threat in pvp. Swap out those items for more stamina, or for resists if you're feeling spicy.
---
/agree
---
COWARD
---
I've played both shaman and paladin as a healer in pvp and I can 100% confirm that paladins are more useful.  They can break all forms of cc on themselves (except charm) multiple times, they have cleanse (which is possibly the most op dispel in the game), and their mana pool is infinite.  Windfury totem is nice, but a caster literally just has to wand it once and its gone...  not to mention it shares the same totem as grounding.
---
No one said I was a unique situation.
---
I was asking how would your method of calculation be accurate when compiling multiple accounts, characters, number of auctions, and those not represented by the AH.  If you have an algorithm or addon that can compile that information accurately, please present it to enlighten us, otherwise, using the AH for faction ratio is like guessing how many fingers I'm holding up, right now.
---
The slideshow that was the server when over 200 people are in the same zone made it almost impossible to know what was happening.
---
She was dragged forever away from the Ally and they still didn't lose the tag because of the lag. Was pretty whompwhomp tbh.
---
I SAID
---
THAT'S JUST MORE TIME TO FARM OPEN WORLD HONOR
---
I think at this point you are just arguing against add-ons in general...
---
I really can't be bothered to look for a decent guild that fits my schedule though, lead's harassing him cause he called his princess a b\*tch or something I think. I dunno man as a spectator this sh\*t's pretty fun to watch.
---
God dammit. This caught me off guard. Thanks for the laugh at work
---
Our first Azuregos was ninjad, people called the guild out, you know the usual "x is a ninja, don't group with them". Anyone who mentioned it would get mass reported, one of our guildies got mass reported and he was muted for the whole day until it got fixed. It's stupid because he couldn't reply to anyone that wasn't in the guild and he was an enchanter.
---
Seduce
---
That one rock elemental spawn for the quest that literally had a constant body guard force of level 60s. What the actual fuck is wrong with my server.
---
I feel like it's only worse bc the dungeons you want to farm for exp are right next to raids aka a hot spot for lvl 60s.  Maybe once aq is out brm will calm down xD
---
Have you even had an original thought on your own? You bootlickers will never get it.
---
Is silithus mining very lucrative? Wondering if I should do that or Mara runs (Warlock)
---
This is flat out not true. Go to any 60 zone. I literally can go afk in the middle of searing gorge for like 10-20 minutes at a time and not die, alliance can't even stealth walk the whole way without dying because horde have the whole zone completely scanned. 
---
The only move alliance have to farm honor atm is really rouge / druid groups outside kargath and on the path from kargath to the mountain. It's really hard to fight against those packs of 5-6 rogues that instagib you
---
We got Kazzak last night on Alliance after wiping 3 raids. Was fun.
---
You would need to constantly stare at your combat log and parse out all the irrelevant noise with just your eyes?
---
Yea, no way you can achieve the same effectiveness as this addon provides just by having your combat log open in a different tab.  As /u/PM-ME-PMS-OF-THE-PM mentioned in one of his comments - you are being disingenuous.
---
Never looked at it that way, that’s a good point
---
Not at all, but when you can't attack the argument attack the person am I right?
---
Pope a note saying "Please be aware that the price is for the TOTAL not per stack!"
---
Idk Horde on Herod completely our number the Alliance, yet the Alliance are completely dominating WPVP and camping dungeons raids etc 24/7
---
Thanks, Stannis.
---
gratz !
---
Is there a way about changing your guild tabard after purchasing it?
---
That's exactly why we did it - half those that stayed were the top guilds on the Horde side to deny the Alliance the loot. The guild that had the tag was Despair, one of the top raiding guilds on the server, so we stayed at it as long as we could. By the end there were only about 15 of us, most of which were from Easy Company.
---
Hi, /u/LiquidBionix
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dzpegj/be_in_elite_pvp_guild/).
---
Threat meters can be done in game by a player in their head, the mitigating factor there is that your brain isn't fast enough to process the information but the functionality to know what has been used against an enemy is there, and if you know the threat they cause (This is listed in plenty of places online) you could theoretically do all of this in your head, so no, this is not impossible without an add-on, not to the extent whereby spy will literally let you do something that is physically impossible to do in the game without it.
---
People seem to forget that WoW predates YouTube.  Arguably *the* place to go for guides and information didn't even exist.  And even after it came out, you didn't really find much in the way of WoW content there, you had to go to Warcraftmovies and download a video and hope that it was a format that Windows Media Player understood because VLC was barely a thing at the time.
---
And on top of that, stuff that is considered basic, essential game knowledge was either not known or not used.  The vast majority of players still clicked and keyboard turned, mods were less sophisticated, epic mounts actually took a long time to get, UBRS was the farthest many went in PvE... the list goes on and on.
---
Anyone that thinks the Classic playerbase is comparable to Vanilla's is insane.
---
Then you have no right to complain about the drama. You're part of the problem.
---
im in the mid 40s on incendius. decided ill just let my sub take a break until bg's are out because it is actually impossible to play
---
It's called Orb of Deception not Orb of Vanity so we're rightfully disappointed.
---
He does here and there but he wants to do end game content. I don't blame him.
---
Seriously *Spy* is basically cheating.
---
I mean by the rules it's not. And it's a MAD problem, if you have it, I need to have it to even the odds, so the other guy needs to have it....
---
I wish they could do something about it.
---
what happens when he gets a crush on a melee egirl
---
You act like there need to be real stakes to partake in a make-believe war. Yikes.
---
No biggie, I saw your post and just so happened to clean up my macros last night and this function was one I used over and over so it was still fresh in my head. How do I code a post here?
---
Horde get all the good stuff to make up for the fact that they are the inferior faction choice.
---
Can you show me where I said that should be the basis for it's removal?  Because I didn't say that.  If that's what I believed then I would want every addon removed because that's literally all they are designed to do - provide additional functionality.
---
Thanks man, means alot!
---
This is hopeful. What spec are you playing at 60 that works against rogues and warriors?
---
Im loving my pvp server. That is all!
---
Mage is really hard especially if you're sword spec combat. Imp Sprint is the best two points in combat vs mage. You can also try to gouge them after cheap shot. I advise you watch Perplexity mage duels for some tricks.
---
Nothing is impossible, good luck man.
---
Imagine asking a question in a non condescending manner and trying to understand the why?
---
It's because I fucking hate leveling other than dungeons and I am horribly inefficient at it. I don't want to start all the way over when I'm so close to 60.
---
OP screenshot is frostmage. Here's another post for you to downvote, enjoy.
---
It's still not worth more than 10g when AQ comes out. 
---
It only has 10 NR no one is going to swap out what is likely an epic dps ring for 10 NR. 18+ NR rings are what costs a bit.
---
Not in this situation. The guy who is now giving it away for free, is doing it BECAUSE the other guilds purposefully didn't make it for their guild. That's what causes this whole situation.
---
Halfway there!  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bfevz2/level\_44\_is\_the\_halfway\_point/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bfevz2/level_44_is_the_halfway_point/)
---
&gt;People take the conflict way too seriously/literally. 
---
I am apart of the Grob Mob. Denying the opposite faction is exactly what Grobbulus does. Just the other day alliance got the tag on the second spawn after horde got the first one. Horde did just what you are decrying, alliance raid leader was forced to bubble loot and hearthed. He was unaware zoning would deny his right to distribute loot.
---
Because multiple items at once at mail was a vanilla thing...
---
But of course if he listens to this, he would in fact be taking socializing advice from reddit.  catch 22.
---
Rogues also seem to get the jump because stealth :(
---
The speed at which you use stealth absolutely makes a difference in this game.
---
&gt; you could theoretically do all of this in your head
---
No, you could not theoretically keep track of 40 players threat in your head.
---
go topve server then crybaby
---
Same.  If I get the notion to pvp, I will join a battleground.

Blizzard already addressed these issues by releasing PvE servers.

---
How do you figure we were only aoe'ing a hill? You're making a ton of assumptions from a simple screenshot there bubba.
---
The main reason people play on a pvp server is to get their character strong so they can shit on other people. Retail died when blizzard start catering to cry babies like you. 
---
This is unfair! I keep getting ganked!!
---
This is unfair! The horde have too many pre-mades in BG!!
---
This is unfair!! I can't get passed 1800 because raid gear!!!
---
This is unfair!!! They shouldn't be able to use trinkets!!!
---
This is unfair!! I still can't get passed 1800 because they still have better stats!! It should be about skill not stats!!!!!
---
So my old guild in Classic used what was called a "Bonus Roll" system, which was basically DKP that you spent on a /roll. The idea was that there was still an RNG element, so that long-time players couldn't monopolize loot over new players, but they were still somewhat rewarded for being there a long time. I thought that sounded like a great system, and decided to join. 
---
So I was hired on as the OT, and everything was good. First week I was level 58/59 in MC, but we still did fine and I wasn't dieing, we cleared 8/10 and Onyxia no problem. Next week rolls around and I was 60, and after Thursday the guild officers approached me and asked me to look at going fury/prot since we didn't need three tanks (there was a second OT as well, who was more geared than me at the time but not by much since I had some purple gear from my first MC week). I said sure, I'd look into it, and that was that. 
---
The following Tuesday rolled around, we hadn't discussed the fury/prot change yet, but I'd tried it over the weekend and decided I didn't care for it, primarily because I was still doing a lot of 5 man groups and not having Tactical Mastery was terrible. The tanks were rolling for gear like normal, and no one said anything. On Garr I rolled for the Drillborer Disk and won it. After I win the roll, I was told "I thought you were fury prot, you can't roll on tank gear anymore". The raid leaders end up pulling me up and basically explain that we have to only gear two tanks because we can't beat Rag if we don't, and then proceed to give the shield to the only one of the three tanks who didn't roll (he was MT, but had already won more loot than the other two tanks combined). I didn't say anything, just because mid-raid raging never works out, but got quite a few messages from others in the guild as they saw it happen. When Thursday rolled around, I thanked everyone and /gquit to greener pastures. 
---
Fast forward 2-3 weeks, I'm obviously in a new guild but still had lots of contacts in the old guild. So I've been hearing how the raid leaders don't log on anymore (after ignoring the posted loot rules to ensure they got Benediction and the Spell Power enchant over anyone else), and how the guild is slowly starting to have some cracks. And then one of the Bindings dropped. Instead of giving it to the same MT that they gave my shield, they instead ask all three tanks to roll on it, and the second OT (who is still fury spec, and was just slapping on a shield) won the roll and was awarded the binding. MT immediately quits and hasn't been seen since. 
---
The guild is still raiding currently, but I have a feeling it's gonna fracture pretty soon, I know a lot of people are relatively upset.
---
Funny you should say that, I am. I am generally not the only skinner there so I get maybe a stack of rugged leather and 3-5 black scales if I'm lucky.
---
If I stick with skinning I'm thinking I should throw enchant on my gloves so I can get those 305 dragons after Rend. Do they drop a higher number of rugged leather at 305/310?
---
Can't you just buy the game time tokens and trade those?
---
Might not be possible its been a while since I've been on retail but I thought I remember those being traded
---
Good point and I am probably not properly geared either. I'm leveling as Affliction. Maybe I should respect to Demonology at 40?
---
Hunter 1 and 2 are doing it wrong if they aren’t using aimed shot.
---
Not true... I am happy on my PvE server... I just cant play at work.
---
Wondering if I should roll a mage or hunter alt. Currently have a 60 warrior and getting the desire to level again, but mainly I want an alt for gold farming. Thoughts on which is better for solo farming? I am on a smaller server, but I'd rather do dungeon farming than open world farming.
---
Should I respec to Demonology at this point?
---
Not really I report people all the time and never been banned
---
You do realize the way it displays now isn't classic either right?
---
This makes me sad....
---
Meanwhile on the Horde side: dEcEpTiOn MoSt Op RaCiAl!
---
Not gonna lie though, it feels to see them just give up after you take away their opener.
---
CONFIRMED: No one cares
---
Sauce?
---
I know I was making a comment about the state of that broken addon, Spy. Even if he was able to stealth right away, the enemy rogue even if he didn't see him, would have been alerted of his presence the moment he went stealth.
---
So it procs 46 times every swing?
---
What do you think about respeccing to Demonology now at 39? Will that help?
---
I like the recent defense of killing honorless targets. Now people are saying that the game is about war and that involves killing any enemy you see. I don't think people know how war works.
---
No, they said you're dead in game for 1 month...
---
All this will achieve is them breaking whatever api would let you do that, if you used a external macro/tool to do this then you'd get banned.
---
Not complaining at all, the whole situation is pretty fun to watch though I do feel bad for the priest since he's a nice guy.
---
Ok well thats most likely the case for both fury prot or any other warrior tank spec as well. They was as fast and high dps as possible in the main hand. So that would probably mean its the same priority no? While I have not checked the loot tables too specifically, rogues and warrior tanks trying to min max want the same weapons.

You confused me so much last night. If you want some friends to play with hmu. (In Classical Wagons)
---
Its a massive pain traveling to and from the battlemaster.
---
Most will just Reddit or watch Youtube between BGs.
---
Can confirm, I log 1 evening a week and raid. When BWL releases I will play more, just nothing to do in game atm.
---
Its funny to me that you use the singular terms why trying to be a smartass, but in fact it makes you look like a dumbass.
---
&gt;hundreds of random players constantly
---
Do you report hundreds of people a day?
---
Yeah but your not processing.  If the split is 60/40 before anyone has even signed into any server, it's impossible to balance without alienating your customer base.
---
All you're doing is forcing one faction to queue longer than the other, and thats your business plan to infinity.  Thats just pissing off your customer, and people will quit.  Never going to happen.  
---
Now if the split was 50/50 to begin with, and some servers had 70/30 splits, then this is something you could work with and try to balance with faction specific queues etc.
---
But an inherent 60/40 split is an unsolvable problem (unless Blizz buffs Alliance, or gives them WOTF, or something drastic like that). 
---
I was foaming at the mouth about the faction imbalances, but now that I understand why, I can understand why this is not solvable.
---
Not the worst idea without Finkle's Skinner.
---
adrenaline rush will still let you thrash people in pvp its just a long cd and can make you feel impotent when its on cd
---
Depends on whether you're from Europe or the US. If US, then yes.
---
My guild is run by a bunch of drunks and druggies. But no drama yet. Had a PUG bomb the raid on Gheddon and that got everyone pretty salty for a while but not much beyond that.
---
2 to 4 reachable herb nodes of dreamfoil/gromsblood per run. Whether or not it's worth it depends on whether or not you reach instance cap per hour and the price of those two herbs in your server.
---
Mods must be pve scrubs as well considering this would’ve been deleted by now
---
It's factually correct however unless you count Paladins as a racial.
---
All you whiney pvp try hards putting down OP should go join the marines if you want to do real pvp. Or can you little bitches only be tough in a video game?
---
Being flagged on a PvE server feels like running around without my chest piece equipped.
---
Maybe a novel challenge, but really I am just handicapping myself for no reason.
---
Please tell me how the fuck to get into BRD with 1,000 horde camping the entire path....
---
Choosing the underdog is not necessarily a bad thing.
---
I for one, will relish in my instant BG queues. 
---
Its just that right now, Horde Players apparently have a lot more time to waste than Alliance Players.  I certainly don't have all day to wait in front of Strat hoping that someone walks by. I mean one of the other posts was horde camping the boat to Feathermoon.  I can't imagine what their honor per hour is. I imagine that it is very low, but maybe I'm wrong.
---
I don't regret rolling PvP. I don't regret choosing Alliance. But I'd rather just play my alt or watch a hockey game at this juncture in time.
---
lol this server was 90/10 alliance. This will never be the most balanced server
---
This system would only apply if the server had already hit capacity, an under-capacity server could potentially have a very unbalanced distribution and the balancing would only begin to take effect once the server hit the full mark.
---
Here are a couple examples to illustrate this.
---
Assumptions:
---
Server capacity: 10000
---
Distribution: 60% Horde, 40% Alliance
---
Scenario 1: 5000 players on server (3000H, 2000A)
---
In this scenario, all players would be on the server
---
Scenario 2: Exactly 10000 players on server (6000H, 4000A)
---
In this scenario, the balancing would begin. If an alliance queues up, they would take the spot of the next person to log off. This would be either a horde, making the ratio 5999H / 4001A, or an alliance, maintaining the ratio of 6000H/4000A
---
Scenario 3: 2000 person queue, 10000 players on server (6000H, 4000A)
---
Here, alliance players would continue joining the server until the current server population balances, or there are no alliance players in queue and the server population drops below 10000. So if a horde logs off, they would be replaced with an alliance, and if an alliance logs off, the ratio would again be maintained. This would push the server towards a scenario where the queue was almost entirely the dominant faction, while the in-game populations would be balanced. Of course, once the server drops below the full mark, the surplus horde would then have space, and so the population would shift back towards horde-bias, but would stay full.
---
servers are 2-3 times larger than what they were back in the day, you got multiple 40 man raids camping every dungeon, flightmaster and high level zone during primetime.   
---
You literally cant go anywhere unless you have perma stealth, and i bet that even rogues and druids have trouble reaching dungeons somehow :P
---
I guess I'm ignorant in this, because I don't recall every reporting people (though I have an extensive ignore list): But, what's the current issue with the system as you see them?
---
G0 TO R3Ta|L
---
I feel that's one of the reasons scams like this work. They don't ask you for your info directly. They just want you to "sign in" to the website.
---
I tried. But they send it back saying "but when I hover each stack, blablabla" :/
---
It was pretty equal, with roughly 100 on each side.
---
Back in the day during vanilla, when I was a wee little lad - I truly had a mindset that the opposing faction was the enemy. My adrenaline would begin pumping at the site of horde, as if they were going to kill my family. I very much remember this game being as hostile as it is today. This phase is bringing that back to life for me, kill them all.
---
I don't know enough about how these things work to evaluate this response.
---
Accurate or not it doesn't change the fact that players do indeed need such an addon.
---
Lol i am going to remember this for surr. Thanks friend. I jist want to do well. I feel like the majority of pugs i play with like me on my dps characters and I often lead the way or the runs. So I want to be a good tank. Learn a thing or two.
---
I leveled 52-60 only in dungeons, mainly BRD. Good time to start getting pre-bis early.
---
Yeah the guy who posted that is delusional and trying to get attention.  Horde seems mainly PvE focused or roam in small pocket groups in EPL/Winterspring/etc to maximize Honor Points.  On raid day we teamed up with another Horde Guild to charge BRM so we could zone into MC with as many buffs as possible.  Lost about 50% of the run's buffs but that's a lot more than 0!  
---
Alliance has control of BRM on Thunderfury almost all of the time.
---
the daily counts seem to fuck up for me... adding a DK when I was logged off once, counting more or less Kills than I got. 
---
Corrects by the time it hits lifetime so I am not worried
---
It's just a bad comment
---
I encountered folks discussing that in my research, but I can reproduce this problem with brand new toon that has zero quests.
---
You should never feel bad for killing the opposing faction.
---
I mean, my point is that Ulduar ended up breaking a lot of guilds because Naxx was so easy in Wrath.
---
My shitty ass guild was stuck on Razorscale for 3 weeks on 25 man because we had an absolute immense amount of dead weight that the leadership didn't acknowledge during Naxx (which we were full clearing since week 3).
---
Lol wow
---
Thanks I'll definitely look into that
---
There were only roughly 30 of us at the end by the body. Everyone left after 2 hours (2:58) cuz it was assumed 2 hours was when the body would despawn. The reason your shits says 74 is there was a horde raid group that was off to the east of the body, but they didn't take part in the actual fight by the body, which is why we got steamrolled so easily on that last push.
---
Just started a shaman after hitting 60 with my druid.  Feel like I want to give healing a try but already put some points into enhacement for 1H/Shield build.  How long can I viable heal instances for before I should respec to resto?  I wanna give it a try or should I just level as resto?
---
Because 3 people are greater than 1 person
---
I am only slightly trolling. You said something that was so factually incorrect I had to say something. Sub counts? Who cares. That was never in the original topic.
---
This is one reason why people wanted honor delayed, so people could actually get to 60 but no we have to rush everything for some reason and so only few casuals got to 60 and they're being hit the hardest in this phase.
---
Yeah people are saying fuck that shit and quitting. That’s the problem.
---
Then what is he saying? Because i've addressed what he said already which you conveniently ignored. don't be bad.
---
Unfortunately... a lot like the naming rules to be honest. Unless you're being racist it seems like you can get away with just about anything in your name these days. I can't complain though, I played a character named Boyardee for years.
---
If you spill the insides of bowels (read: shit) the meat is ruined
---
I don't even think its unplayable, I just want to see the horde that are the majority on PvP servers admit they are just griefing. I am cool with it taking 40 mins to get to the instance, I expected that. But killing the same targets over and over and over beyond the point where they give honor is just scummy behavior.
---
Amen brother. Murder with sympathy means you're not a sociopath. Can't hate the playas, hate the game.
---
Find 9 other people in an MMO?
---
It wasn't that bad because servers were so much smaller - with increased numbers on the same map size - now there's multiple ganking parties across both continents when during vanilla there would only be a few ganking parties at one time.
---
Well currently the unbalance is alienating the minority faction.
---
Fuck all this "it has no place in classic" whining.
---
World PvP is fucking WAR. Any and all advantages are valid (so long as they don't violate add-on rules, tos, etc) and any sense of honor or fair play is entirely personal. Stop projecting that shit onto the rest of us. I see the same crap in Dark Souls with people whining about what's fair or honorable.
---
He's been trophy hunting for years. All sorts of animals.
---
You’re implying they can’t make design choices now with history and perspective.
---
Yet they’ve changed things like goblin attack range just recently.
---
Aka a game design choice.........???
---
We're getting 1.12 AV.  Most of then runs will be 10-20min rush pushes.  However, even on pservers where most of the AVs were 10-20min rushes, there was generally at least one running every night that was a multi-hour stalemate.   This meant if you kept queueing, you'd get some rushes, but eventually you'd get dropped in the long running one...and if that's what you preferred you coudl stay there and try to fight/break the stalemate, and if it wasn't you could just leave and requeue 15mins later.
---
And you can still do those quests post 60 for extra gold instead of exp, which makes it even better to do dungeon grinding for your exp. No problem wanting to play different, but I have really limited time to play so if I were 55 I would definitely do dungeons to avoid getting ganked and then quest later to get more gold after the madness dies down.
---
No, what we need is the community as a whole to whine till they change it, worked fine for getting bg's early so.
---
Last night i landed in morgans vigil where i was ganked immediately. From there, all the way to BRM i was rezzing at the 50 yrd radius limit, only to get ganked immediately. It took me about a half hour to get in the instance and at that point i didn't want to play. Alliance, Sulfuras.
---
I was referring to paid server transfers.
---
All i can see is a suscription for each of the units casting a spell,... pff im jealous i wish i had multibox and could soloparty everything
---
Kek
---
I also believe it needs to be crystal clear. Anyone who may roll on it should get a whisper telling them that the item is reserved.
---
If someone joins late, it doesn't matter that the leader said it was reserved earlier, they need to repeat it multiple times.
---
Partly.  But given the pretty significant differences in gear between the 3, I wasn’t looking at damage done/dps as a factor.  I’m assuming that a geared hunter with a bad rotation will probably still outperform a poorly geared hunter with an optimal rotation.  I could be wrong.
---
Still way better than counting time when they just didn't have the resources to develop new content and half the (eventual) player base couldn't even play the game.  It'd be better to base it off something more like time for the median raider to clear, but I very much doubt those numbers are known, especially for vanilla.
---
If they're using arcane shot and "one aimed shot entire raid" I'd say rotation is important enough for there to be a major damage discrepancy here, even with gear.
---
Was at work had little time to type but thats the gist of it. Check out skarm on twitch as well, he gives good advice and is a great warrior/druid tanking expert, pretty chill dude that doesnt mind answering questions.
---
Yes but ulduar normal wasn't even that hard by todays standards, my point is that Classic raids are several orders of magnitude easier than anything that's been produced in the last 5 years or so, so to talk about a top guild is laughable.
---
Ele is crazy good at creating threat. There aren't any direct threat reduction talents or abilities besides a totem and their burst will easily peel mobs off a tank. Let the tank get good aggro and then for short fights (less than about a min probably) they do as good of dps as anyone else, especially if they get some crits.
---
Then you stop and drink.
---
Got some Midsommar / Hereditary / Witch movie vibes going on here.
---
The manly tactic is being good enough to lock me up and take me out rather than running away. If you lost the fight, the other person deserves the HK. 
---
For most rogues it’s not even enough to stealth/run away, tail-tucked. Rogues will wait until
---
you start farming again, have 3 mobs on you, half health and then re-engage and then have the audacity to /lol or you. If a rogue has to wait for the stars to align to get a kill, maybe they’re just bad?
---
p
---
Since WoW 1.2, if you were in melee and initiated an attack on a mob that was neutral and instantly killed it, you'd receive exactly one melee hit from that mob. It continued to work like that for years after Vanilla as well.
---
Pretty much, yes. Edgemasters (and everything that puts you at 305 skill) makes the lvl 63 mobs act as if they were lvl 62 for hit calculations.
---
You only need 6% hit against a lvl 62 (and 5.5% hit if you’re at 305 skill).
---
i lold
---
This is what we do. Any upgrade for the MT goes to the MT. Contested pre raid BiS between multiple classes is posted with a set order on drops. Everything else is loot council. So far no loot drama.
---
Damn I didn’t think about it!
---
It's not loot council, at best you could describe it as MS&gt;OS, yeah that might be a great pvp item for you, but that's not where loot is going to go first.
---
Loot council is absolutely terrible, even if it isn't corrupt, being at the whim of a couple people on loot is not ever going to work equitably
---
Druids - Jack of all trades, master of none
---
I like the short n sweet :) thank u for the extra info also friend
---
Just found this post :) Thanks for liking my tool!
---
I think naming rules only matter for rp servers, unless your name is offensive. The only guy I've met who's had to change names was a guy named "Allyaregay."
---
For world PVP yes, but BGs will help to fix this.  It's all Blizz has got at this point.  I cant see any other paths to solve this problem.
---
Dont get me wrong, it sucks, but it is what it is.  
---
It's time for Blizz to buff Alliance with a PVP racial.
---
I seriously doubt they are going to basically rewrite several major WoW API's for one addon. 
---
Also, they are keeping the WoW API consistent between retail and classic. This means the change would affect retail. They aren't going to ***EVER*** do this, no matter how much bitching happens.
---
People need to suck it up.
---
They just sit in Menthil now :)
---
I herb or farm essence of air
---
That's not all there is to PvP though. Sure it's a lot of what's happening right now but there's kind of a rush in encountering someone on the side of the road and either escaping with your life or killing them dead. 
---
PvP has a lot of fun to it and it's a lot more than "ganking players and corpse camping" them.
---
That being said, I wish you the best adventures in your realm
---
Gonna go watch this thanks
---
Hotfix should already be live on all realms.
---
Just because i dont have anyone on my kos list you will be my first! :) &lt;3
---
Nah, horde have thicker skin, literally. Except for undead of course who don't have much skin at all.
---
For our guild u have to submit your gear for promotion to a core raider. Avoids the pre raid BiS drama. It's clear cut. Core raider ranks get first crack at loot.
---
Make sure to get as many items as you can in MC with your DKP/ LC, then ditch the guild for the next raiding tier.
---
Then the really juicy items start to drop and the mages and WLs will leave in droves if a healer ninjas Neltharion's tear.
---
Does winters chill stack with shatter?
---
Any target after 4 kills becomes honorless not just the lowbies. I don't know what this argument is.
---
Look, 48+ give honor when killed by 60, that's why the unfair ganking happens. It's not because people really want to kill lowbies (okay, some poor skillless fucks do), but because it still helps advance in ranking. This is just fault of the honor system.
---
Nobodies talking about vanilla tbh. 
---
Old skool guys like me know it was seldom done because it sucked, so anyone saying “nerfed” is talking about pservers. 
---
Now you can be an asshole and argue wether it’s a nerf or not or you can just give them the answer they need - and I’ve done the latter because it’s much more useful info than being a Reddit dick.
---
Rep gains from killing mobs aren’t “quest drops and things like that”. You didn’t even bother with reading the OP.
---
That's called token loot, it works but it doesn't really reward attendance it effort so it can hold you back when the better people move to guilds that reward their efforts
---
Whitemane actually has alliance guilds that work together. Even if the balance was to go to 70/30 horde/alliance we would be just fine.
---
meh
---
This is Warcraft and you would have me remove the war?
---
Nah.
---
Way to deliberately miss the point to push your own agenda, but whatever.
---
PC Part Priorities:
---
GPU &gt; CPU &gt; COOLING &gt; SSD/NVME &gt; MEMORY
---
Here's my suggested parts list for your budget, monitor included:
---
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ywQvf9
---
So the thing you won't have been able to do from release until Dec 10th?
---
Absolutely do not level as resto.  Most people go enhance until early-mid 40s then respec to Elemental.  Personally I went enhance 1-60 and was fine with it, but theres definitely a slow down right around the mid40s because of a lack of weapons.
---
You should be fine to heal any dungeon as enhance or ele until BRD or so.  Just ensure you have a second set of gear with Int/Healing on it.
---
Yeah hate to see it, but these players didn't read a single guide on how to actually play their class at 60.
---
The truth is, most people didn't know or didn't remember what PvP is going to be like, and that includes that kind of people, because PvP even on a balanced server, even for a good player, is 10% feeling good about victories and 90% about the atmosphere of everpresent danger where you're gonna get killed without you being able to do anything about it and then seeking out a revenge that will be just as unfair and probably directed on someone completely unrelated.
---
People who are in extreme minority obviously have it worse right now, but I also pity the few people on the other side who wanted that kind of atmosphere but can't have it because their server pretty much turned into PvE server for them as the other faction pretty much just left.
---
Then why post a cry at all?
---
It’s pretty obvious your cry Harding. 
---
Just stop and adapt.
---
you are volume
---
So you couldn't think of a coherent argument so you resorted to throwing a shitfit?
---
Not even surprised to be entirely honest, lots of you folk around.
---
Does anyone know of a leveling guide that includes dungeons? I have one level 60 and want to level another, but all the guides only have overworld questing, no dungeons included
---
Thank you ALL for your very detailed and thorough info and advice. Like holy shit. If I had awards a handful of you would have gotten em. 
---
I've learned a LOT more than I thought I didn't know lol. 
---
I'll be leveling as arms for sure. Looking out for those bis per level weapons. 
---
Also, for those sayi nf ill need to spam dungeons and look for healer friend, i feel like my realm actually has as many healers as dps now lol. Just no tabks. I'm a pretty solid quester. I know a good bit of tricks and how to stay rdy or ahead. I am very confident in my liking as a warrior. I only want to ensure I can perform as a good tank too lol. Esp in 40+
---
ASAP, runecloth bags are like 2g each and I still use 4 of them at lvl 60, also using 4 on my lv 17 alt warrior. So its night and day comparing my alt with my main from months ago where i needed to get VendorPrice and yet spent so much time dropping the cheapers items. 
---
Comparing both at leveling is night and day.
---
I'm pretty sure you can get them for free if you ask nicely on a friendly guild or maybe even on /4
---
Its not like you run the whole instance for exp runs, its max 30 min per run.
---
Yes I read it, that's why I replied.  Raids aren't groups, they don't have the same rules.  That was my point.
---
You are probably right, I remember the rules *used* to say they applied to anyone, on any server. I'm mostly OK with that though. I wish it was better enforced though because I've seen two different people with really offensive slurs in their names.
---
Both sides are killing overzealously, I don't think it's a horde or alliance specific problem.
---
Theres way more shaman players in classic than in vanilla and people are geared to the teeth.
---
Never has vanilla seen the amount of overgeared Memehancement or Elemental Shamans when BGs released. These 2 specs are literally the blueprint to blow you the fuck up...
---
Interestingly the level 60 data I grabbed last night when it was raid night suggested the server was more balanced Horde / Alliance than in the off-peak data I posted up there (not far off parity), so it's interesting to hear you say that!
---
Herod or stalagg have the best population of good guilds and that’s way more important than faction balance for me
---
His post got removed fast lol
---
Glad you like it :)
---
When the server kicked the bucket, my spy has 200+ horde detected, so they had the alliance doubled.
---
That's how retail works in Europe (but curiously not NA). You get matched on same team with people in your language, but your opponents can be from different languages. That's what the other poster intended by "regions".
---
Nah, the people behind that website left Skeram to go terrorize the tons of alliance on Heartseeker last I checked.
---
Maybe they're all out PvPing instead of LFGing.
---
Sorry I mean porting in and not landing
---
Is that 4am? How is no ally there &gt;.&gt;
---
This is one of my favorite shitposts from my time playing EVE and after reading a ton of posts the last few days it, I was reminded of this over and over.
---
So I updated it.
---
&gt; If you lost the fight, the other person deserves the HK.
---
I mean sure, but come on.  
---
99 percent of rogues are going to evade whenever possible as that is one of the unique features of the class.
---
 I seriously doubt they are going to basically rewrite several major WoW API's for one addon. What you are asking for requires a new combat log API to be written to replace the old one. **THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF ONE ADDON.**
---
Also, since they are keeping the WoW API consistent between retail and classic. This means the change would affect retail. They aren't going to ***EVER*** do this, no matter how much bitching happens.
---
15 year old edgelord confirmed.
---
I couldn't tell you. Around the time Classic launched there was a census addon going around and I think it had the numbers at 60-40 in the alliance's favor but I can't confirm those numbers especially now when the hype has died down and a lot of the flavor of the month players have stopped playing.
---
It was already modified. Jesus. They allowed in August to send many items and COD. But the UI is not clear to many players. Chill the fuck out.
---
&gt;Are we just stating the obvious now?
---
Well, apparently both of us :) From each others' point of view.
---
I don't know who your friend is neither which game he plays, but I will boldly assume that he is not that popular as Asmon (sadly), since just considering wow streamers, Asmon could probably pay his bills playing 1 day per month.  
---
I'm 28 with a wife and a kid and I'd give up my entire developer career to do what Asmon does since I'd earn fat money, but I'd never do it to do what you friend does.
---
I think you can probably get a decent guess at relative server pop from number of auctions as well. Azuresong/Horde has \~8k auctions at any given time, Fairbanks/Horde 26k
---
Marked spoiler my bad
---
i always find posts like this funny
---
you do realize that if everyone rolled horde in this "min max culture" you would have no one to ever kill 
---
you should be thanking these people
---
Classic was always going to be a game that shed a large amount of it's casual player base with how time intensive it is.
---
There's also an "end point", to a large extent, for content, and a lot of dedicated players have already hit that point. Once you get level 60 and all of your pre-raid BIS gear there really isn't much to do aside from logging on to raid. Me and my friends played at least 4+ hours a day launch until end October because the game is so damn fun, but now that we're all level 60 with every piece of dungeon gear we need there's isn't much to do and we all went back to playing Dota. PvP is fun in principle but right now it's just an awful, laggy clusterfuck of 200 people tagging others with damage in arathi.
---
Because you're not a unique situation. There's people on both factions that do the same on your server.
---
Hey man can you keep me updated please! Playing on flamelash as alliance also, no need to further explain my wish to transfer server. 😅
---
You should roll on a pve server
---
I blink in and finish him off, then I kill him* 😏😏
---
"I really like this guy"
---
Lol I’ve thought about paladin actually since they wear plate which is cool and that talent that refunds mana with crit heals is very enticing, I’m just worried I’d get bored of leveling one up :/
---
That is exactly what I just said maybe slightly more then phase one.
---
I see your story. 
---
And I've also read multiple stories of people who complain that no action is being taken for those abusing the reporting system.
---
Of course streamers do, it's their job. Doesn't mean everyone in their guild does.
---
Then it's not accurate.  That's the whole point.
---
To add to this, *super* ruined. Like, you won't be rinsing this shit (literally) or whatever else off and cooking it out.
---
Currently, my friends and i havent enjoyed getting raid stomped as ally as soon as we login.... so we havent been.
---
AND? I'm not even level 60...
---
what there is always reason to run dungeons maybe you need your fire resist set or maybe you need your valor pvp gear or maybe your pre bis or need crusader and have to farm orbs.
---
no one want's to do dungeons because wpvp as horde it's not so bad but for alliance it's hell.
---
This worked for me! Thanks so much &lt;3
---
That one is especially fun if you played  any of th DND Ravenloft modules. I wigged out for a second when I saw am NPC named Madame Eva!
---
I played enhance shaman all the way thru OH vanilla with an arc reaper and then tuf.  Shaman are fun but they aren’t paladins.
---
Nice to see you're moving goalposts when the original post was specifically noting the term 'racials'.
---
To where you somehow decided to coin Paladins as a racial.
---
Besides that, faction with absurdly powerful PvP racials and a very strong Heal/Utility/burst DPS class &gt; faction with weak PvP racials but the best Utility/Heal class.
---
Cause it’s more like 10pvp. Player(with a fat S) vs player. PvP is undeniably only going to be fun when the numbers are balanced.
---
And people are taking your suggestion seriously. We’ll see if you like how that goes when BGs roll out and you have 4 hour queues.
---
Idk about mining, but on ashbringer, I find it pretty hard to gather herbs. At least for leveling. At 190 level right now. Seen some bots going around too and skinning prices keep dropping AFAIK. 
---
I've started to feel like it's better to roll a crafting profession now since so many seem to be gathering.
---
That's only partly true ... CensusPlusClassic still works, if many people per server were using it and uploading numbers we'd have a really good idea of server populations. 
---
That said I ran it for one day on one server and after uploading my data the server ratio went from 50:50 to 65:35 :p
---
Sounds unlucky, what server are you on? When I see a member of my group doing the wrong thing or showing obvious signs of “this is my first time” I always try to take things slower and halt the group to explain a mechanic or a boss fight that is coming up. I don’t want to wipe and a newcomer will be taught the proper method to clear a certain dungeon so I feel like in the long run it will make my server better imo
---
&gt; Except they banned the original way it worked.  Now it just acts as a LFG filter.  So yeah they banned the original add-on.
---
No they didn't. Blizzard said they were going to look into it and then never took any action because the misinformed whining calmed down.
---
A good portion of my wins depend on having improved sprint up. 
---
That being said, Paladins, warlocks and hunters are the hardest for me to kill. In that order.
---
Beautiful commentary on the stuggles one faces today in society ruled by Chads that oppresses gamers. Thanks for sharing.
---
So far the only thing spy is broken with is the whole 'seeing stealthys' eveningthough that information is literally just as available as any of the other information spy uses from your combat log.
---
Are we gatekeeping age now? As if I couldn't possibly have played UO at release. EQ PvP wasn't necessarily worse in terms of death as opposed to UO, but you wouldn't be able to have an entire guild of players potentially quit the game in UO just because they were kept from their gear. 
---
Losing shit in UO, barring the unlucky loss of an important skill, didn't take that long to get back unless you were being careless. Even a week of progress loss is nothing compared to losing all your raid gear in EQ because an entire alliance decided they wanted to make your corpse rot.
---
The point is, it was hardly that much better in terms of consequences if you took proper precautions in both games. You could still get royally screwed over, and the gear mattered more in EQ if you did end up losing it.
---
UO was riskier in general, for sure, but you are severely downplaying EQ.
---
How long till the haters show up to shit on this guy's achievement?
---
I'm with the other dude, get out while you still can.
---
Evidence gets in the way of people's emotions.
---
Glad to hear it! Hope more people find out about it.
---
I think it’s a good feature though, if you want to hide your pve trinkets you can do so easily and it wont clutter up your options in the middle of a fight :D
---
Depends on the guild really. If you bought your epic mount over getting your devilsaur set, I would consider that unfair to the other people who are prioritizing gear so they perform well. However, now that honor is released, wpvp is pretty prevalent so I can see some justification. Do what one guy said, get crusader on the mirah's and continue running UBRS like a mad man. I just threw +3 weapon dmg on my swords when I first started to raid and put crusader my dal rend's set. Try getting a couple righteous orb drops to help with the cost.
---
Whew man, a rogue in my guild got 106k and is only 15th place
---
Can confirm.  Spent an hour last night at prime time and couldn't get a group, attribute it to having to go do BRM.  Almost nobody is up for that right now.  
---
I'm sure there are more reasons than just that, but it's impossible to break down the percentages with any sort of certainty.
---
&gt;Harder to farm honor for dominant faction, easier to farm honor for overwhelmed one.
---
Honor farming is relative to your faction, so it doesn't really matter if its easier or harder to farm.
---
Well depends on what Class you are Strath always needs a tank and you can earn good money tanking it by reserving the first Orb. Getting there is pretty easy it’s more room to run just a lot of mobs in the way but once you land at LHC mount up and bee line to the service gate even if you die at the service gate by horde your ghost can walk through it and spawn right at the entrance.
---
In either case you're playing a game. The main difference is you're playing the training wheels version. Saying people have no life because they play wow on a sub reddit about wow where you are talking about how you play wow is fucking dumb. Do you not see that?
---
Honestly if any of you have a problem with this, play on an Alli dominated server, a PVE server, or better yet, in retail where you can do everything in the game from the capital city.
---
Yeah with 90% if that being horde waiting to get on and "pwn some noobs" lmao... believe me alliance has all but stopped playing. Everyone I talk to basically raid logs.
---
Whether it’s 8.5 or 12 hours a day doesn’t much matter or if you go from 10 days to 7, it’s still a large investment.
---
boringgg
---
I don't play a warrior so I can't really comment on your rotation. Threat is the biggest challenge in classic for tanks and there are definitely situations where it's not realistic for you to be able to hold aggro perfectly, like when dps don't manage their openers properly. It's a noble goal to never lose aggro and it's always good to play to learn to think about what you could've done better but the scramble is a nigh inevitable part of the game. Sometimes the best you can hope for is for a dps to be ready to offtank in a scramble.
---
There it is!!!
---
Classic WoW needs the Karen Addon!
---
Blizzard hasn't broken anything CLFG did.
---
I wish more people listened when us PvE carebears warned about this. This is the exact same situation as even recent private servers showed. It's not a random population problem, it's a systems problem with the game.
---
World PvP is dead and not fun at all around 99% of the time. It doesn't represent any skill, nor does the stupid ranking system. Arenas and rated battlegrounds were the only skillful PvP modes in the game's history even slightly worth bragging rights.
---
Very nice.  Crazy to see some lag even in that small skirmish!
---
Yup, nothing like a 30 min run from MV or TP to get there.
---
this is nothing compared to a lot of other mmos where you can permanently lose more than just 25 minutes
---
perspective, people
---
Bad argument because the game from DAY ONE wasn't like it was originally, and they've made other changes since.
---
Call the police.
---
A) Paladins aren't a racial
---
B) Paladins won't help your human warlock when you're caught in a 1v1 against an undead shadow priest.
---
C) Paladins still aren't a racial.
---
My server was like that but for some reason it didn’t translate to raids. My guild runs 2 40 mans each week and we are a little light in heals and heavy on tanks  🤷🏻‍♂️
---
BRD isn't the only dungeon. Scholo and Strat are much easier.
---
And your a whiney bloke
---
Because of the issue of the video. We are watching a video of a ROGUE. Now imagine you don't have an epic mount yet and only have 3 hours to play. It takes nearly an hour to get into Dire Maul or BRM on my server. That's why its flustering. Dying a few times isn't that big of a deal which is why people were whining WAY less during the earlier phases.
---
They didn't need to because it was against ToS. Spy isn't doing anything against ToS, so how do you expect them to take it down?
---
Raids also have like no warlocks. When you find a raid chances are the other warlocks are already geared so you will get all the loots. Where as mages have competition with like 8 other mages. If horde BG queues are long as fuck I’m re-rolling alliance warlock. Ez to gear due to it not being highly played, ez to level with a pet, incredible 1v1 in PvP, and they only get better with each phase
---
I am starting mine with that and I do also get this problem sometimes, so I don't think that fixes it sadly
---
No it wasn't.
---
It's called a heartbeat resist.
---
Every server tick (typically 2s), a mob has a chance to resist the cc and break it early. This chance increases each time it fails to resist. This chance is also increased by the mob's spell resistances.
---
I started playing with about 6 or 7 friends and one of us got into guild that had a decent amount of 60s the first week or so and got all of us in. Eventually, he became the raid leader of the 3rd raid, which all of us are in. It was me (Hunter), a mage (leader), druid, warrior (main tank), 2 shaman, 2 warlocks, and a priest. We told the guy who played warrior he wouldn't like it, but he'd stuck with it so far even though he complained the entire time he leveled and while 60 about not being able to quest/farm in tank spec and didn't want to keep re-specing. 
---
Over the coming weeks, our raid progressed, we killed Ony, and eventually Rag. Right after we had our cleaned MC+Ony to date with 0 wipes, he quits. He cited frustrations of people micromanaging his tank style when he wouldn't tank something in the right spot along with him not getting priority on certain loot pieces like Core Hound Tooth. 
---
We kinda all saw this coming. Over the weeks of raiding our small group would have discussions about what went right/wrong among each raid night, and frustrations had been increasing with him as threat became a constant topic, which he said he would be fine if he got items like Core Hound Tooth, Accura band, etc. The weekly arguments became daily which became semi-hourly as we hang out in voice chat most of the time. Tonight is our first raid without him, and he just plays PoE now.
---
Don’t worry. Shit memes like this will got deleted by mods anyway :)
---
paid PVP to PVE transfers were a thing
---
i assume that if they allow paid transfers at some point this will happen
---
but thats a big if
---
Most people don't realize they're not getting past 8-9.
---
To be honest I also enjoy wPvP. I just dont think that the casual player-base has had enough time to get to a point where they could participate. The game has only been out for roughly 3 months and it takes approximately 10-14 days of in-game playing time to reach max. Anybody with a career, family, college, etc has probably made it to about 50-59 which is why this is a perfect storm. You've got people that have invested 100+ hours into a character and they don't want to re-roll just to play a game they may have 2-3 hours a day to enjoy. I mean at this point it's not even about getting ganked, that was the norm in phase 1, it's about getting insta-killed at any flight path and not even being able to complete a simple fetch quest. I mean at this point it's just a smart business decision.
---
Because theya re the min max combo. Aoe stun racial and smallest hitbox tauren for both hunter and druid.
---
Sometimes life's more fun with some inconveniences, sometimes it's not.
---
bubble sac is a voidwalker ability, demonic sacrifice voidwalker gives a buff that heals 3% hp per 5 seconds for 30min
---
A N A L K I L L
---
Both sides do it. Regardless of dominant side. Rogues hardly care about that.
---
Bro this is a game. Even making that simile is ridiculous. I can make ony twice a week cause it's like an hour. But MC take more than 2+ hours. People don't have that kind of time every week for video games my guy lol.
---
Just reroll.
---
Check back occasionally onto your old server to see if it's got better, and if it hasn't, then keep having fun on your new server.
---
Hi guys, I have a 30 hunter (first character btw) and am really enjoying it so far. I'm keeping my skinning (around 215) up to date however I'm worried that I won't have enough gold for my first mount at 40. What other profession do you suggest i pick up in order to be good to go at 40. I have around 16g atm. Thanks alot!
---
I quit a while ago, but still have WoW subs on my frontpage. Partly I like the game and want to see cool clips, and partly I want to see stuff like this that reminds me not to resub.
---
I've seen the # of ganks to me personally decrease a lot. First week gadgetzan was a blood bath, this week there might be an occasional gank, but I'm actually to pick up quests and leave relatively safely (no crazy 10+ groups/chasers).
---
I think what you're detailing is probably what a lot of people who don't understand the honor system are doing.
---
I bet it will decrease even more in the coming weeks (and on top of bgs) once more and more people realize how grindy (and how coordinated you have to be) to reach the higher honor ranks.
---
There's no longer gank squads out in Felwood/Un'Goro which reinforces my belief that people are just going for easy kills (BRM/city hubs) and don't want to go out of their way to gank a lowbie here or there.
---
I also bet that people are reducing the time they're on pvp servers because with most adults nowadays having much more limited time to play, they probably don't want to deal with the ganking.
---
I know that some people are even tired of the queues and want it to die down before they play any further. "I just want to be able to log onto Classic without a queue" is what I've heard from a friend.
---
You suck at telling stories
---
Ironforge on Fairbanks is quite full.
---
&gt; I rolled pvp expecting to have pvp fights
---
And here was your 1st mistake.
---
Pick random talents in demonology until you get soul link, the rest doesn't even matter. 
---
I'm only partially joking.
---
But you're drinking right next to the road...
---
&gt; Do guilds still go through all the trouble of doing that, even today?
---
No. Not even when we cleared it first week.
---
If you’re not enjoying the game now, there is a good chance you’re not going to enjoy it at 60.
---
Is this supposed to be a /s? Because I've seen some people with that attitude. It's ludicrous how crazy people can get about faction difference.
---
The launch was a mess, a bunch of people I know all ended up on different servers due to the insane queue times on day 1. Picking alliance on a PvP server in 2019 is a mistake though ngl
---
Was this shot with Frapps? at 1080p and the picture is still shit, time yo upgrade your 486 and and 64 mb graphics card.
---
Which is one of the main pillars of wow classic-- having to interact with others. So is usurping that aspect a good thing?
---
u ͜ʖu
---
Thank you for sharing. I climaxed during the arcane explosion part.
---
You def don’t need it, but it helps if you are light in dps and wanna kill rag before he submerges . If you kill rag in sub 2 minutes then you could absolutely put fire resist gear on and still be ok with room to spare.
---
I'd still say it is. If you can keep a new weapon out of your enemies hands. Its a weapon they can't use.
---
I never said I can solo a raid. I just don't bitch about getting gank. 
---
"You really don't seem to understand that a pre-made bg is still 15v15, and I can just afk in that shit till im kicked and move on to something else."
---
And that just proves my point about you being a shit player.
---
Multi shot should be used on single target as well.
---
For me, I have been watching his parody guides since I started playing wow as a scrub in 2014. His transmog like a badass video was the funniest thing ever I had seen for this game and I would quote it all the time when I was making new t mogs. He never really switched up too much (played up being stupid a lot more) but he’s always been a greasy attic dweller that I relate too and like how he retire to look at things in a hyper realistic way similar to joe rogans podcast where if he is your kind of people you really enjoy the conversation. I do think he is hilarious tho but maybe because I’ve seen all the funniest moments from before he was twitch King.
---
I love you
---
Thank you for the rant and for not formatting your paragraphs ever. Have you considered running NOT-BRD or NOT-BRS? I hear Strat, Scholo, and Dire Maul are lucrative with minimal ganking to get inside.
---
There is a Fall off, but hunters bring lots of needed utility, and their damage is not bad. Cant beat mages/locks/warriors (if they know how to play) but can still pop off some nice damage! I would def recommend!
---
While I might go back and forth on which character to make now as an alt I find personally that every class is fun enough that if i'd reached the 40s i'd just continue on with it. The fun for me is the social aspect and doing things in groups, all the classes have enough cool stuff and gear that that isn't such a big worry.
---
I guess we'll have to find out December 10 in WSG which side has better players then... See you out there, my guild already does honor scrims vs an ally guild and our top 2 premades haven't lost in 6 fights yet
---
Holy fuck our school systems really suck
---
Implying spy would allow this to go unnoticed without a fucking meteor shower of flairs.
---
That's like...a whole semester!
---
This is why HWL can be so crazy.  You have no idea how much honor to grind so you just gotta keep going.
---
I got shit to do in BRD.

He's probably a mage and wants to only fairly fight 1 warrior at a time.
---
There's many more advantages to Spy. Spy gives you a HEY LOOK STEALTH notification rather than you having to look out for it. Spy makes it so you can "see" people LoS that you normally wouldn't be able to target unless you click on them or /target them, which makes a difference in having to type out /target insert name here; giving the player who respawned enough time to be able to mount up and run away, with Spy, this makes it instant as all you have to do is click the name of the person doing ANY combat logged action. How is this not blatantly using an addon for an advantage?
---
You're missing the point, which is that with a large enough population any individuals actions get lost in the noise. You might be an outlier, it doesn't matter.
---
No, I’m just a casual player only lev 28 so far. I enjoy being able to roll up some trees with my uncle and play some wow over the weekends without having to worry about getting ganked :-)
---
Same boat, everyones on alts. Also run into 5-6 people who are rerolls from PVP. Also a lot of bored people handing out bags and gold to those refugees.
---
Dude ppl love it when you go holy. You'll be a healing machine. Plate healing gear is tough to find tho.

classic wowhead has detailed dungeon guides
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/dungeon-guides](https://classic.wowhead.com/dungeon-guides)
---
Looks like I did the right move by ditching my 53 level hunter on Skullflame and rerolling on a PvE server
---
Maybe he was still in half afk mode after login in. I do that often at least.
---
On heart seeker
---
warcraft is not a job.
---
That’s so funny. Hear the same complaints ally side nonstop
---
This is fair enough but RNG can have a big part to play.
---
eg.  Ive run countless runs of Strat.  Never saw the felt hat, never seen the wand, never seen the boots.  A huge amount of scholo.  Finally got the neck after 15+ runs, still never seen the wand from gandling.
---
18-25 - WC/DM
---
25-30 - SFK / BFD
---
28-35 - Gnomer / RFK
---
30 - 45 - SM
---
40 - 45 - RFD
---
45 - 50 - ZF / Uld
---
50 - 55 - Mara / ST / BRD 1st Half
---
55 - 60 - BRD / LBRS / Strat / Scholo / DM:E
---
My rule is it's in a city or open world, I should pay the mage for using their time to make me stuff. But in dungeons? Hell no, it should be expected of mages to give food/water.
---
Stay in school kid
---
alright man, ill wait for your video of you soloing a premade then. what do you do when when your team is getting GY camped in a bg?
---
Yeah i feel a lot of people rolled healers this time around thinking it'd be easier to find groups but not wanting to commit to tanking. It's odd how easy it is to find heals.
---
I like wow lol is a common one even though every alliance knows what kek means
---
Server?
---
I prefer it well done.
---
I tend to disagree... I remember watching asmongold when he was sub 500 viewers and he is pretty much the same guy, being an asshole is just popular on twitch. Who knew.
---
this is false. There are very few differences between blue pre-bis and giantstalker unitl you get 8/8 giantstalker set bonus. Look at the parses. rhok is huge but a good vs bad rotation will make up that difference and more.
---
hunter 1 and 2 are wrong terribly and hunter 3 is right...lol what dps are they outputting and what boss is this?
---
What happens when GM strikes out with priest and starts aiming his cyberdick at a Rogue that competes with you?
---
Classic WoW is an MMORPG that you play and meet people and it rewards the time and effort.
---
Retail WoW is an MOG that sometimes you wonder if there are even other players and it rewards existing.
---
Gave up on retail a while ago (I think during Cata). Still played the game, but for like a month or two (for lore reasons) in every expansion. Its just too hand-holdie for my tastes. I blame the current generation of "gamers", the ones who want fast-paced BS. Thats not what a real MMORPG is, people!
---
&gt; dont sell greens on the ah unless they're valuable (i used an ah addon like TSM to immediately check if the item was worth throwing on the ah) - vendor them instead.
---
TBH just vendor them anyway. TSM only tells you what they've been listed for, not whether they've actually been bought at that price. I've tried auctioning greens and even the ones that were supposedly worth more didn't sell often enough to justify the deposits on the ones that didn't.
---
&gt; loot. everything. vendor it.
---
Some whites sell reliably enough to AH, but yeah, just vendor most of it.
---
Mage is my main and can't decide between hunter/lock for my alt for gold farming/pvp spec. 
---
I am hearing that warlock is better/easier in pvp. I was thinking lock had good gold farming in DME jump runs and might be better / more consistent / easier than DMT and still have high gains. I wasn't sure tho.
---
I play wow and FPS’ to dump on other ppl. That’s what’s fun for me. It’s not about horde or alliance. If you’re on the opposite team than me, I’m going to do everything allowed to ruin your time playing. And if you quit/give up, good.
---
Easy, I sell the stuff I don’t need immediately. Sold all my enchanting gear on the AH. I’ll just buy it again if I need it, at which it’s usually cheaper by then. What exactly do you have 6 bank alts full of that you couldn’t just sell on the AH and re buy later?
---
i like your meme and don’t think it’s a shit meme :)
---
Youtube and google are you friend. No one wants to explain how to get somewhere when its impossible to type out clearly. Honestly a couple weeks ago it would have not been a big deal, but now with world pvp you will spend an hour of corpse running to get wherever you need. My advice, watch a youtube video on it and it will be extremely clear. Also, do not ask to join a group unless you are already inside said dungeon. then no one will kick you out, you won't be pressured about joining a group and you will be waiting on them, not vise versa. People are just pissed about world PVP tbh, I have 2 friends quit because world PVP makes the game so unenjoyable, blizz really fucked up on P2, even the streamers have said the game is no longer fun, P2 killed wow classic.
---
I've done both throughout my WoW career, but always preferred healing. I guess it's time to level that warrior :(
---
Yea i really hope that your comment gets deleted too lol
---
Spy is crap all around. I see some clowns citing it was in Vanilla but having lost my life to that game I don’t remember anyone using the combat log to  the extent Spy does. Then there’s the fools who cite paranoia as if it widely used, makes me laugh. I got jumped on a corner going into DM the other day and my first thought was ‘those guys are probably all laughing and so pleased I don’t have Spy’
---
Yeah my experience has been the complete and utter opposite of yours. I very rarely have a hard time with any class of my level (maybe warlock mirror discluded? I'm UD so I have a massive edge on that matchup..)
---
Stack shadow wrath gear and maybe some stamina if you're getting chunked. I dont want to say you're doing something wrong because I don't know what you're doing, but warlock has seriously been EZ mode for me.
---
Lead with fear. Use your void walker sacrifice early (what are you losing, 23 dmg autos from the void walker? They should be dead by the time your shield wears off.)
---
Lots of folks rolled on PvP servers, and are always-flagged, by virtue of server type. Since many servers are unbalanced, faction-wise, there are a lot of unhappy camp-ees.
---
Yes. When the report hit's blizzard's side, it is ignored if you are on the blacklist.
---
If horde REALLY wanted to PVP they would roll the underrepresented faction.
---
They don't though. They just wanna zerg.
---
But you could do all that with just a HOTW druid, for dungeons at least :)
---
Minmax, that's who. You can re-spec however many times as you want, so some will go Raid spec and then Not-Raid-Spec.
---
your
---
Anyone have that website that shows faction balances
---
You mean like Miss / Dodge / Parry / Crushing / Hit?
---
The point, from my original question, is the accuracy of the data.  Forget my reference all together, there are players that simply DO NOT USE the AH.  As stated above, it's like looking at the stock market to figure out how many people live in a country.
---
It's. Not. Accurate.
---
horde has all of these same macros as well as the go back to retail ones
---
Have you seen his YouTube channel when he just sits and talks. It's like it's two different person. He is for sure playing it up on stream
---
I was part of the shitshow on Tuesday. Have never seen that many skeletons before.
---
Is ret useless?
---
Congrats on 60!  I just started classic last week so I am way behind, and alliance on a pvp server thanks to some friends so its going to a while until I can do a post like this.
---
You do realize that there are things called battlegroups and BG's will be q'd cross server right? PVE servers could potentially be BGing with PVP servers. I'll be sure to update you on the 10th with our Q times.
---
It really is, especially when all the super experienced at PVP SWG players hit Wow and started thrashing people.  We literally brought an entire guild to Wow.
---
How do you dodge? With one guy as a scout? I’m not familiar with how it works.
---
At some point, you have to decide that whether the minuscule gains from those last two pieces are worth the time that you could be making gold for consumes, which often will have a greater impact on a boss fight.
---
If you’re down to bracers (which are horrible to farm) and another slot, I’m just go with gold farm personally. Less discouraging.
---
I sat here like an idiot trying to figure out what OKP-4300 meant for like 5 minutes.
---
&gt;  I just dont think that the casual player-base has had enough time to get to a point where they could participate.
---
The thing is, all of this stuff was well known and not exactly a hidden secret, even the most casual players could find the timeline and look at history to see how it played out if they spent like 30 seconds on google.
---
Instead they went in with a false sense of the game, experienced 1-60 without honor on a PvP server with layering, then were surprised at the amount of slaughter when honor was actually released and cried to Blizzard to fix it instead of rerolling on a PvE server. 
---
&gt;I mean at this point it's not even about getting ganked, that was the norm in phase 1, it's about getting insta-killed at any flight path and not even being able to complete a simple fetch quest.
---
This is a pretty gross exaggeration, sure there are some places you get insta-killed and some places where you can't complete quests, but in general (both at level 35~ and 60~) there are tons of places where you can quest and fly to without problems. 
---
I keep seeing these reddit armchair experts 'predict' how things will go, and always use these gross exaggerations and it's a bit annoying how often they're wrong. After Honor was released people spent the entire week screaming how BRM would be 100% camped on raid night and no one could get in. I play alliance on a horde dominated server and we got together 3 guilds to head to MC from MV in preparation for what everyone expected, then we get there... And there's like 3 horde outside MC, no one else. 
---
It was something I was really looking forward to, a full week of people complaining and predicting turned out to be one of the one of the most disappointing experiences I've had.  
---
&gt;You've got people that have invested 100+ hours into a character and they don't want to re-roll just to play a game they may have 2-3 hours a day to enjoy. 
---
I feel this is the worst argument for not rerolling on a PvE server.
---
If you've invested 100+ hours into a character and had fun doing it, it shouldn't be about the character, it should be about the experience. 
---
If you didn't have fun doing it, what the hell was the point in it?  
---
&gt;I mean at this point it's just a smart business decision.
---
Fair enough, but a smart player decision would have been to roll on a PvE server when you knew you had limited time, didn't want to fight and knew that PvP was the first thing to be released. 
---
Should Blizzard cater for the players that make poor decisions?
---
Yeah.
---
I'll be laughing on my way to r14 when horde players will have to play 18h a day to reach r10 while being farmed by ally premades. Everyone knows paladins brings more value than shamans for pvp.
---
I dont really engage in pvp, unless engaged upon.  
---
Except that one time in tanaris by the wastewater guys where i went to clear an entire camp just to get a chest, and then before the last pull a huntard showed up and looked at the chest. I hesitates for 10 sec then pulled the last mob, and immediately he went to loot the chest. Needless to say i killed him. Looted the chest and then corpsecamped him for 40 min before he went offline.
---
Sounds like they should have rolled on a PVE server
---
Once you hit Mara and beyond, or ZF when NOBODY needs any of the INT gear.
---
To anyone complaining about the current state of things; We knew this was coming ever since Blizzard announced the phase schedule. Go to a dungeon and level. Learn patience. Do not leave capitals alone. Group up with your dungeon group and then head out to your destination. Just assume dirty night elves are out there trying to use you for honor.
---
the gm forms the raid that pulls
---
Lmao scrims
---
So the hunter feigned and the mage didn't realize it and rode off right?
---
Laughs in shaman
---
Do you get mad when you lose, though?
---
As a warlock who does not plan to raid, help me decide the best BG spec. I’m torn between SL/Nightfall and SM/Ruin. I’m open to other specs as well.
---
Haha are you serious right now, or is this just some super subtle trolling?  You think rolling around in a pack of 10 is skill?  You think killing someone 10 levels below you with 2 frostbolts is skill?
---
I agree. When I was a teenager, I didn't invest myself in games with large, mandatory blocks of time which couldn't be exited from without inconveniencing others. I actually quit playing LoL after getting seriously into it because I didn't like HAVING to be plugged into a video game for 45 minutes or else feeling like a dick for leaving. 
---
Even as an adult playing Classic, I double- and triple-check that I really want to tank a dungeon before committing to a group, because I know that I can't bail once I start. And I get real annoyed if others join a group and then leave, or if we spend an hour putting a group together, only to find out that the hunter's gonna pull every mob before I get to them, etc.
---
It’s the only guaranteed all day PvP spot right now. Small or large server it’s pretty much the only place you can go that you know is gonna be an actual fight and not a gank fest. Half the people there have probably been there all day farming honor. There’s not much talk for that reason and the fact that half the people there don’t give a shit and won’t coordinate. Also after day one no one wants group with randoms there because some idiot enviably will kill the civ. Form your own group instead of beg others to take you and you’ll have more fun.
---
Lmao "evidence." Horde on Hearthseeker is just as whiney when it comes to being ganked constantly by Alliance.
---
That's something they changed to in retail
---
You are not the asshole here. If someone is running a dungeon for a specific item then they shouldn't join a group where it's reserve, simple as that. Will make it harder for you to fill the group but once you do there's nothing wrong about enforcing something they provided informed consent about.
---
What sort of guide do you want? Atlasloot will show the level ranges (so will a simple google). If you want guides to the actual dungeons just google "deadmines classic guide" etc. Wowhead has detailed guides on each one listing all the quests.
---
Jesus Christ... who hurt you as a child? Show us on the doll where the bad man touched you. 
---
You need therapy my man, just don’t go shoot up any schools in the meantime.
---
Sometimes, yes
---
If it's the same school that told you that Paladins were a racial then I'd rather take lessons from the local 7/11.
---
Calling Paladins a racial, throwing a shitfit, moving goalposts and then throwing another shitfit when you can't form a coherent argument is the key to success kid. You'll surely go far.
---
because winters chill raid spec is for raids
---
I think you actually just want a normal shatter aoe spec
---
I'm honestly not a knowledgeable warlock player.  I've been a priest/hunter player since classic with priest being my high pvp xp.  But I can tell you that before p2 I was basically buying all cheap "of Shadow Wrath" gear and sending it to my alt.  Now with P2 I'm gonna look at pieces with some more int/stam and look into a solid SL spec.  My goal then is to only die to lvl 60's and be able to beat anyone around my level to hopefully cut my deaths way down even tho killing mobs will be less efficient
---
Ive always wondered what big wpvp looks like in pve realm.
---
I imagine each group have one tagged tank each fighting like in Troy until one healer has to heal then all hell breaks loose.
---
- Except one was built into the game by the Blizzard. (hunter ability)
---
- The other was built into the game by the Blizzard. (chat log)
---
So, what you are saying is that, people who want to quest and play that part of the game, need to only do pvp otherwise they can’t play at all. We got a genius over here folks.
---
True PvPers unbind the S key for an ability 4Head

Grobbulus is a 50/50 and there is a shit ton of both factions online constantly.

Feb layoff aside, it doesn't mean the CS department wasn't lacking before and is now split between games. Automation is cheap and it'll take someone convincing the right exec sponsor that it's worth investing in. Realistically though, people deal with shitty service, unjistified bans, and long wait times...and they almost all probably keep playing
---
The issue is, from what I hear, is that it's like this on most if not all servers. Even mine (whitemane) where the horde and alliance disparity isn't that big.
---
Lmao very creative actually
---
There’s 1,000 RP difference between them. Which is 1/5th.
---
I levelled a priest up to 38 on skeram alliance and realized how out numbered we were, deleted him and started on the horde. Now that I'm 60 I'm glad I made the change. If you can't beat em, join em!
---
Kargoz is a moron. I've watched some of his class guides and they're full of terrible advice, like telling shamans to sit so they can get critted to proc Eye of the Storm, or telling mages that Ice Block isn't important for AoE grinding.
---
I know this is just an opinion, but one of the bigger turn offs for retail for me is that stupid treadmill stuff. I don't want to log on to do chores.
---
&gt;To me the simplest solution would be to allow players to purchase a realm transfer to a PvE server
---
I hate the mentality that Blizzard should fix problems as a result of player mistakes, Blizzard didn't force you to roll on a PvP server, they didn't hide any of the content or history relating to wPvP, they made everything as obvious and plain as possible including a roadmap with Honor included.
---
Yet some people rolled on a PvP server and were surprised when exactly what everyone expected to happen, happened. Then they complained because Blizzard wasn't fixing it. 
---
&gt;Let people that regret rolling on a PvP server transfer off.
---
They can reroll on a PvE server, this is a player solution that a lot of players just don't want to do because for whatever reason the only thing they care about is being 60 on their own terms. 
---
But at this point, if it stops the constant complaints, I'm all for it.
---
Sure other games may have different pvp systems but this is classic WoW. If you didn't know that this is what the PVP system is like in this 14 year old game that's on you. It's not like blizz dropped a flawed system randomly out of the blue, everyone knew this was how it worked, everyone knows people would group up and farm lowest possible honor giving characters. There's no point bitching about it now because this is the PVP system in classic wow and this is what it always was. It's just more extreme now due to the player base min/maxing and the player base being higher on each server. Also remember honor has only been out just over a week, give it some fucking time man.
---
Big brain
---
We only got two total ingot drops across two raid groups, both were loaned out to another guild to craft the server first hammer. They then had bad luck for the next several weeks and was only able to get us one back.
---
We then purchased 4 of them with gold, and worked a loan/trade deal for the rest with other guilds on the server who were kind enough to help out. We crafted the hammer ourselves and ended up using 9 total.
---
I mean, it's not his fault ally sucks at pvp
---
I'm not asking you to format.
---
I'm asking you to press enter / return a few times to make it easier to separate ideas.
---
Like this.
---
Yea man. Or you know, just disable PvP while in the city.
---
Trust me I agree that does/would suck. But joining/being on PVE server still allows you to wPVP, it's just optional, which is what is sounds like you and others are looking for. I think a lot of people just didn't realize what a PVP server in classic really entailed when they signed up for it. I get some servers have out of whack pops and that's partly on blizz and server transfers but getting ganked and having your city and FP's fought over is pretty common for Vanilla wow. PVP servers on Retail vs Vanilla are very very different as well. Now if someone continually griefs you after 1-2 kills and follows your rezzing body across a zone than yeah that is griefing and you should report them. I'm on a horde dominant server and I can tell you I still get camped and still fly into FPs that are hot zones, so people who claim that it's always the dominant faction, it isn't true.
---
Thanks for the suggestions everyone, I've rolled my priest on Grobbulus.
---
I tank a lot of dungeons. Recently I've seen many more 53-59s trying to do dungeons. BRD, Dire Maul, even Strath and Scholo. Sure they aren't the most helpful but I've gone easy on them because I know the leveling is rough now.
---
Classic isn't as social as Vanilla was, in my experience so far. Players are quite insular to their guilds and are mostly focused on min-maxing &amp; efficiency.
---
Talk in general chat and such, group for quests, run dungeons... you're going to have to take the initiative for social encounters in Classic.
---

---
Oh, I didn't know that. That kind of changes the outlook of the situation, I agree. But at the same time, I can still understand why some people here, myself included, without knowing this particular detail would see it the way I described.
---
Going to be doing the same, very unfortunate. I was enjoying it before this started.
---
If we had classic+ it would be the opposite way guarenteed
---
You can list every single reason there could be for a player to need a dungeon but that doesn't always equate to them wanting to do it. Burnout on some items is real, especially if there is super stiff competition for it or it gets replaced in MC/BWL quickly. 
---
My guild is relatively casual and I think there are only a handful of them, that have been 60 for about a month and a half, have full pre-raid bis for their class. The majority of the raiding group basically raid logs anyway though, they may log in once or twice a week for a few hours but mostly just for the raid and the rest of us are leveling alts or still attempting to get a few last drops.
---
I would hazard a guess that most guilds that are only fielding one raid team are probably in similar situations.
---
It sounds like you've had a bad experience, but a well-run loot council is widely accepted as the fairest way to distribute loot, because every system has blindspots for intangible aspects, except when a human is there to consider them.
---
It is not "solely because of why not". It is because they are farming honor and that's how the classic PVP system works. Honor just released. People want to farm for items. It's a means to an end right now.
---
You pretty much complain you experience pvp on pvp server. Sorry but PvP isnt only fair 1 vs 1 duels of equally skilled people who fight in noble fight and then /nod at eachother. You live in a fairytale. If you dont like a lvl 60 rogue corpsecamping you and teabagging you then roll on pve. Many ppl rolled on pve purely because of this reason. Because they either only want to clear pve content or they wanted PvP in controlled enviroment.
---
Soo stop crying, train by dueling in your major city and simply... git gut.
---
As I’ve said in a previous post I am biased as a rogue myself. And while I do agree that is a good approach to take, I don’t think that many guilds will require a tank geared for threat gen to have Perditions. I think it’s unnecessary and still better to give to a rogue but ultimately it is up to the guild/group lead. I do like the point you bring up though. And obviously this is subjective based on perspective.
---
Get bent, you weren't having a discussion, you're just rebutting something I never said. The OP is talking about doing dungeons and PVP. Stay on topic.
---
Fury/prot is  a raid tank spec, and even then, only relevant with excellent gear, and only necessary if your raid is pushing you hard on threat. My raid tanks aren't fury prot and they don't lose threat and we kill bosses just fine, and our healers don't have aneurysms healing them.
---
What about someone that’s completely new to WoW that didn’t know about the shitfest that is phase 2 right now and joined a server with 80/20 horde alliance ratio without knowing that would happen. Also I leveled up to 40 before phase 2 hit and now I can’t level anymore so you are saying I should start fresh and accept that I wasted 1000 hours of my life bc I am new to the game and didn’t understand it would be impossible to play once phase 2 came out. I didn’t even know what phase 2 was until it was released and I couldn’t do anything lmao. You guys really do have small fucking brains holy shit.
---
Moo-tulations.
---
It's only 30/60!!!!! More like 10/90
---
Gen Z thinks 2005 was the stone age.
---
"No benefit"
---
It's a PVP server, just causing the opposing faction to be weaker is literally the point. If you rage quit and can't level up they are helping their faction out.
---
Troll, but orc wouldn't need/use edgemasters cause their racial covers it.
---
Ahhh so good! Lol
---
I know right! The bots take all the best names.
---
I wanted to call my alt SJahfajfaua but it was taken
---
To be fair, Band of Accuria is amazing for tanks if they need the hit (which if you're non-human, you definitely do). But other than that, I know what you're talking about, we had a warrior (who was also an officer) leave for the same reason. And he wasn't even tanking, he was a DPS warrior, he just hated playing warrior.
---
My council gives prio to people who have their pre raid bis to incentivize them to actually go and get it. So for example, someone with full pre raid bis has number 1 priority, whereas if you're missing like 7 pieces, you'll have much lower.
---
seems normal on Grobb. i wanna know if horde grobb are seeing this instead

Hey OP are you able to confirm or deny bosses being immune to the debuff? I just got the dagger myself.

A couple days ago I was leveling my gnome mage in dustwallow marsh. I was doing an AoE pull and was down to 10% health when a tauren druid who was 5 levels higher than me moonfired me from max range until I died. The hunter who I was questing with (8 levels below the horde) goes after him and the guy runs for his life... . I get back to my body rez, and go after him for a bit and he pops everything to get away while I was still at half health with no buffs and less than half mana. Like, the guy probably could have easily killed both of us when we chased him given the level differences, but instead he always just waited until we were very low on health after engaging mobs and then ran as soon as we showed the slightest sign of fighting back. Behold, the “honorable” horde.
---
I leveled my paladin to 60 as prot spec by mostly doing dungeons. There is a lot of negative perceptions towards paladin tanks, but I was usually praised for my tanking ability, especially in aoe farming groups. There is plenty of negatives to paladin tanking though, lack of taunt, Mana dependent, low damage mitigation. If you plan on staying prot at 60 be prepared to have everyone's gear have priority before yours in raids. I won't even mention how bad soloing is.
---
I just hit 57 on my priest today after respecting at 53 to Holy. I REALLY REALLY miss being Shadow and feel absolutely worthless outside of 5 mans. Is it possible to get decent shadow gear to make my Priest a pure PVP/Farm character without raiding? My guild will only take me in raids for Healing so staying shadow is out of the question if I want to raid. I’m prepared to heal 5 mans and I think I can do about 10-15hr/week of battlegrounds once released. 
---
I should also note that I do not want to be that guy that gets raid gear and then just abandon raiding once I’m finished being geared. It just feels selfish to me.
---
What would you do with reps and shaman?
---
You're just a slow leveler, by far the majority of active players are 60.
---
Ironforge isn't accurate, there's no real accurate website. AH listing are a better way to measure.
---
....okay?
---
I think you don't realize there are people who can afford those things.
---
Not sure, most guides focus on the fastest leveling routes and dungeons tend to be slower than questing/grinding for speed leveling. It's also a lot easier to just google a list of dungeon level ranges and know when to go to a dungeon vs being lost and not knowing which zone to move on to next. If your guide is listing specific quests though it's probably due to being a speed run guide.
---
LOL shut the fuck up right now. The guy makes a light hearted thread and shares a moderately entertaining story. You butthurt little bitch.

I had a horde rogue try to gank me outside Morgan's (i'm a spriest) but what he didn't realize is there was a healing pally behind me &amp; a few other alliance. He took off once he saw I was being healed but we hunted him down &amp; killed his ass.
---
I don't think healing is any worse than dps finding groups though, if you enjoy healing heal.
---
While this was cool, why was it even necessary? Was there any doubt that Old Men Gaming was in the wrong here?
---
Actually I'm a software engineer and I've written small bits of UI add-ons so I both know what I'm talking about in terms of software in general and I have a decent idea about UI add-ons. This would be a trivial change.
---
They don't need to change anything major in the API, all they need to do is put in a filter function on the data returned. Using pseudo-code because I'm on a phone all we'd need to do is go from:
---
    def get_combat_log():
---
        eeturn combat_log
---
To
---
        return filter(remove_enemy_actions, combat_log)
---
As for the migration path so blizzard can still access everything it needs, just have 2 API calls. One is the "protected" API call with full results (blizzard already has protected API calls, so this protection already exists) and one is the reduced one for UI add-ons. It's not a lot to ask addon developers to change their function call from "get_combat_log" to "get_public_combat_log". Or if they're super cool they could try to detect if the caller is first party or third party code and conditionally apply the filter that way, but that's needlessly complicated.

Soooo uhh, fuck you for assuming I don't know what I'm talking about.

Have been playing 1 month. Currently level 32 mage spec in frost. Surviving is a chore. Even 1 green mob causes me to need to eat and drink after every fight.

Should I re roll to another class with better survivability? Or am I playing the class wrong?
---
Let me tell you, I enjoyed every single minute of PVP before P2 came out, it was so fun and interesting. Annoying at times, but it was out weighed by how fun and different it was each time. Now it is literally 20 horde camping my flight paths at every single location. It's not even fair, before P2 people would let you rez and drink up before attacking and would allow for fair fights. Now nothing is fair all in the name of 'honor' funny because this whole system has led to less honorable kills than P1 did. Killing someone at 50% hp without mana is soo 'honorable' isn't it.
---
Yeah just hug walls
---
We weren't clueless though. We had forums, which is all reddit is. Chats existed. Ventrilo existed. People figured all of the same stuff out. There were guides, leveling guides, class guides etc etc. Also for right or for wrong, games like wow were limited to a more niche crowd back then and the people playing had a tendency to be more invested in figuring stuff out and optimizing. For the first year or so at least.
---
I agree with this as a long time shaman player.... also flametongue and frostbrand can be situational...
---
due to high armor mobs or mobs that maybe more prone to a school of magic damage.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Dude you don't even realize you're not talking to the same original person (me), because multiple people are calling you out on your inability to read.

For leveling, I would recommend drain tank spec. Almost zero downtime for killing mobs. It's crazy strong for leveling and solo content.

As a Horde player on Smolderweb, yes: I've noticed a drop in Alliance population.
---
Nice I finally got one of these on my boomkin, nice weapon.
---
On Whitemane horde have Morgan’s vigil camped 24/7 and gave roaming squads patrolling between brm and alliance fp as well. Raids have been trying to leave from lakeshire in a full group and still having to corpse hop to instances. It’s unplayable solo
---
I haven't actually looked at this. But I would imagine the function being protected. Aka, add-ons can't touch it.
---
That sounds about right.
---
Nope, it was originally just a joke name when we were just a few people leading MC pugs right after launch. Turns out we ended up really liking a lot of the people we were pugging with and here we are three months later running two guild groups every week.
---
MORE DOTS
---
Nothing to do in game? Lol it’s gonna be hilarious once that AQ patch comes out
---
Tbh we need arenas
---
Yes. But most things that can be shattered are dead before winter's chill stacks. Winter's chill is really a boss killing talent.
---
They’re doing it because he’s taking their profits
---
Oh my god I've lost so many fights because of paladins.
---
You try to take them down fast, you almost kill them then they bubble and heal completely.  Then they heal their friends.  Get a bit of damage in and they bubble and start the whole process over again.  You have to kill paladins at least 3 times over before you can truly kill them.
---
you're hopeless man.  Only one server is alliance dominated.  How you missed that idk. You have to be trolling at this point.  Take a look at this.  https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4398_Bigglesworth
---
NOW, HANDLE IT!
---
I'm on faerlina, pvp isn't completely awful there are good things about it but there are some real fucking broken spells/abilities that can really make the pvp unenjoyable to fucking unplayable at times.
---
I gotta ask though, where the fuck are you solo pvping as a warrior? On my server that would not go well.
---
But almost none of them knew how to play
---
Wtf are you smoking?
---
I think the only reason DHC is considered on par, would be maybe for dwarves. Since dwarves get +5 to guns, you would only need +6 hit instead of +9 for raid bosses. Correct me if I’m wrong.
---
Awesome edit, really liked it :)
---
I'm too busy playing other games or leveling an alt on a new server. I only log in for raids and to re-up my auctions now tbh.
---
P2 has really helped me enjoy other games, I only wanted to play classic and get to 60 but now I find myself wanting to do other things. It's kinda nice actually.
---
He is from Horde, of course there's no issues for him now)
---
Lol
---
Ganking doesn’t allow you to not play. This video is 15 minutes of time wasted.
---
You're STILL missing the point. With a large enough sample size individual behavior is irrelevant. 
---
Let's say you were looking at the stock market to work out how many people were in a country ... you're right that that won't work well but only because different countries have dramatically different demographics. WOW isn't like that, the playerbase is basically homogeneous across factions. 
---
So, in your example, it would be like looking at trading behavior of *worldwide* adults whose names start with 'A' vs. 'L'. Because the two groups are functionally identical (they'll be roughly as rich / interesting in trading as each other) you can assume they'll behave the same way *on average*. So if the 'L's' make 100m trades/day and the 'A's' 500m/day it would be completely reasonable to say there are 5x as many A's as L's.
---
Toilet is where it happens
---
I encourage anyone with the technical knowhow to make addons to check this out.  
---
Classic WoW needs the Karen Addon.
---
It’s almost a quarter*
---
Soft hit cap is 9%, 6% with EG. You can make your OH hit like a yellow by casting and cancelling HS when it’s about to hit, which I think makes the hard hit cap 6%.
---
Don’t think you can have too much crit without raid gear in this phase, although I could be wrong. LOTP, mongoose and world buffs may push you over the crit soft cap but that’s if you’re really pushing it. I wish I could offer more advice sorry.
---
A lot of "good" Horde PvPers are about to gain some humility.
---
Ded
---
I think you're being a bit too harsh. If it's a paid transfer then the player is quite literally paying for their mistakes. At the end of the day the Classic player-base needs to continue to grow and develop- that's not going to happen if players decide to quit all together. I think forcing players to re-roll (doing the same exact quests, grinding the same mobs, scraping together 100 gold) isn't the right way to keep players interested. To act like players have zero attachment to their original characters and they would be thrilled to start a new character on a completely different realm is just being belligerent and it's sending the message that Wow Classic isn't for casual players.
---
Oh, that might be true. I'll edit in that I'm an orc hunter, so this post is not for dwarves
---
Imagine not realizing other players can't see your honorless target.
---
There were plenty of PvP activity on PvP servers before the release of honor system. We just did PvP when we felt like it and ran past each other when we didn't feel like PvPing. Those encounters were organic and spontaneous (thus more fulfilling and fun) unlike right now where everyone exhibits a knee-jerk response the moment they see a player with red names and do things that practically ruin other player's gaming experience.
---
Yes please mods. This would be an amazing touch.
---
reported? he should be sent to prisoon for incurring financial crimes
---
It will get better, hang in there.  You guys rolled us in the big Hillsbrad fights a few nights ago.  Go there and take out some of your frustration on us.  Your side is really organized in that aspect.
---
I think it's time you start tempering your expectations and realize that if you and your team want to raid that building a competent raiding guild is *hard fucking work* especially now that a lot of people have already found a guild they like. Early on it was just a mad dash grabbing up randoms hoping they hit 60. Now all these people are 60 in solid raid slots with teams clearing Ony/MC consistently. They've made friends, formed cliques within their guild, spent *time* with other people on their team outside of raids.
---
Nobody wants to leave a cushy spot they already have with a decent guild for a guild that's core group isn't even 60 yet.
---
If you're not 60 yet you're also probably casual players. Most players will not want to join a guild of casuals if they intend to raid or are already in a raiding guild.
---
There are four types of guilds. PVP focused guilds, Social guilds, Semi-Hardcore Raid Guilds, and Hardcore raid guilds.
---
As of right now, you are a social guild. Your only major draw is "identity" which *every single fucking guild in the game also has.* Seriously. Everyone has a guild name, a guild tabard, a guild identity. Every single person including the small as guilds made up of five people.
---
So you basically have absolutely no reason for anyone to join you, short of enjoying your company when randomly grouping with you for a dungeon. Unless you're their IRL friend, that's unlikely to be *enough* for most players. Being a nice guy who isn't even level 60 yet is not enticing to a player looking to raid.
---
Time for you to learn a hard lesson. *A casual guild master with casual officers will *never* ever form a Semi-Hardcore raid guild successfully unless you're just extremely lucky or stop playing casually.*
---
Players quit the game, players leave, players get in arguements over loot or other shit. Even in a full raid team you need to be on the lookout for recruitment in case anyone gquits. You, and your officers, need to be putting in the ground work to make friends, retain players, and find new ones. Are your IRL friends who are likely officers in your guild doing this? Unlikely.
---
So sorry, but this is a reality check. If you want to raid and be a part of a raid guild, you are very, very likely going to have to merge your guild or disband and join another one.
---
If you are happy getting to level 60 and just running dungeons and doing PVP with your pals than you can keep the casual guild going but turning your casual non-60 guild into a raid guild is going to be extremely tough and require a major commitment of time and effort on your part and the part of your officers.
---
Do you have that time? Do you have that energy? Do you have that *commitment?* Guild leaders tend to lead, and leading takes time and effort. Do you have that time? Doesn't sound like it.
---
Drop the pride, toss aside your ego, get over the fact that you thought up a cool guild name or spent 10G on a well designed guild tabard. It doesn't mean jack, if you want to raid, it's time to look for another guild for your people to fall in line with or accept that you likely wont be clearing raids outside MC/Onyxia with pugs.
---
As an alliance on Kurinnaxx, I can see my death coming... and I am ready for it.

You must be living in 3019 cause this is some big brain shit

It's hardly early. It's on the same schedule that vanilla released it.

He...didn't. He posted a guild drama story. And TBH this is a video game, theres really no moral imperative to do ANYTHING. It's all just pixels.

Maybe. I'm not really a quitter though so I'll probably just play a little less to get rested or when I do stay in brd until gear is red and see how it goes.

Absolute horse shit. Most of the new players in wow, at least for the first year or 18 months were all still gamers. They'd played mouse look games before. Of my 10 friends that played only one of them mouse turned and he gave that up after a short while. People weren't some sort of troglodytes who had never seen a computer game or played an mmo. Everquest DID exist you know, and many of those people went over to wow. You don't need YouTube to learn shit, we had forums, we had IRC. Youtube just has pretty pictures to go along with the data. There are MORE players in the servers now, that's the biggest difference.
---
Phase 2 is killing the game
---
Surprise
---
Yeah yeah yeah enjoy the bg queue (currently death running to ubrs)
---
preposterous
---
Thanks! ;)
---
This is me.
---
Past two weeks Im grinding a remote corner, but I cant even play more than 30min before I have to give wow up for the weeknight.
---
removing layering was a bitch.
---
But if I didn’t stun you for 20 seconds, how would you have the opportunity to /spit on me over and over again?
---
lol... you expect people to wait another year to have BRD calm down?
---
absolutely barbaric
---
Considering you posted this:
---
"You wanna troll higher level horde that kill you when you are worth no honor to them. Go to Gadgetzen in tanaris and unequip everything in your inventory so you dont gold from dying have having to repair, taunt the horde using a translator from alliance to horde to make them angry. Then when they try to attack you inside the city they end up getting aggro from guards and die which ends up costing them gold in repairs and they get no honor while you lose nothing."
---
I don't really care for your sob story anymore lol. Oh boo hoo they are ganking me but I'm posting about how to taunt them. 
---
Since you seem to be so keen on screwing over the horde I'll fill you in on something that may make you feel better. Every 60 who ganks you gets dishonorable kills and that hurts their  PVP rating. By your logic, letting them gank you is hurting them, thus you are winning right?
---
&gt; Actually on my 40/60 server
---
40/60 server is a lot easier compared to 30/70 and below.
---
I already have adapted and completely changed my build.  The game has gotten a lot better since week 1, probably cause all the losers who realize they will never hit rank 14 quit farming kills.
---
Not everyone watches South Park
---
Great idea, every time I see someone posting about their experience in game I always wonder what server they're on, this would make it way easier!
---
Not so helpful for you but I usually take skinning on my first character on a server and spend a few levels grinding good skinning spots. 
---
People complain it's hard to make gold in classic but it's not really, you just need to find which grind you can tolerate and do on repetition. I like throwing on the TV and grinding some stuff while barely paying attention, may not be the fastest but it's solid and consistent if you are the kind of person who can stand it.
---
What Addon do you have for lfg?

People say that the spy addon can even detect nearby rogues that are stealthed. How is that not cheating?

What was your /played? I just hit 50 and I think mine is embarrassingly high
---
Literally every player on Classic.
---
At least on Herod alliance control the inside of the mountain a great deal of the time. It is true that horde always seem to own Searing Gorge though.
---
Lmao that hotpocket part was pretty funny.. and true. The pizza ones are the only good ones.
---
Big time. I had over 20 friends constantly logged on and now I rarely see 3 log in.
---
Go to STV, the guards actually can kill.
---
I’m a mage and I have killed several locks 1v1. It’s all about not letting them fear you and using Iceblock to clear dots. It’s never an easy fight but it’s def doable
---
Is this guy keyboard turning?
---
If you’re already raiding you aren’t behind on gear. Plus what’s the rush if you’re not enjoying it. There isn’t any light at the end of this tunnel. We will all let go eventually
---
14 days and 9 hours!!
---
Is it possible to get to 60 doing this or would they become gray? And if you can, would the xp/hour become too low to be worth it at some point?
---
I just want to say a big fuck you to all the people who encouraged me to take my time leveling. I didn't know I was going to get punished so hard for not being lvl60 at phase 2
---
It was just an example. Raid loggers usually don’t get gear in a good guild.
---
Nah. You should transfer to stalagg alliance so I can quit being camped by the scum fucking horde.
---
Arthas voice: Is .. it over?
---
so butthurt i rolled on an actual server that represents the full game pfft, #gotem
---
&gt;The average player wasn't expected to go out and research all that info.
---
Maybe after a year when the game started to branch out and become played by people who weren't as experienced with games. I poured over forums for information, watched videos on classes, did research for the game extensively. Like I had for every game before wow and like I have since for just about any game, or hobby, etc. Certain things are easier now with youtube and discord and reddit, in regards to niche hobbies but video games always had a huge online presence in forums and videos, because nerds were the majority of gamers and that was our environment. Later on as wow got more popular and the playerbase wasn't dominated by "hardcore gamers" sure, you might have a point, but in the beginning it was played by educated folks. Not a bunch of ignorant sods who had never sat down at a pc before.
---
Wow classic is a bad business decision. Asmon was just streaming one  o his retail transmog competitions, and there's a guy with a $700 blizzard store bought costume. That's 45 people playing classic wow for an entire month, he spent in a micro second. And it would be foolish to think that's all he bought. The people who still play retail wow, are the type of people who do this, there doesn't have to be a lot of them to massively out generate revenue over classic.
---
Yep. rust is down right nasty.
---
Doesn't matter how safe you think your base is... you'll get offline raided and lose all progress.
---
Congratmoolations
---
It isn't exactly complicated to 100-0 with prep, dude. Every single rogue specced that way could do it. It takes what, 30s of reading tooltips to figure out?
---
You'd identify good rogues by how well they handled themselves with cds down or how well they executed things like crip kites.
---
Oh wow you got so triggered you had to search through my history... what does this prove anyway? I can't play the game because I just insta die every time I go out of any city... so I troll horde instead because there is nothing else to do in this shitty game. Instead of actually going after my point tho you look through my post history for a what aboutism to show im some sort of hipocrit I guess? But by doing this you are conceding my first point so I guess you are admiting I am right lol.
---
Are you talking about the original post?  Because I'm not sure I see it as petty in the least bit... quite the opposite. Two factions fought hard over a boss for an hour, and the loser of said fight appears to have had a good time.  That's like calling the loser of a football game petty for trying.
---
What server are you on? Im on Herod and have noticed just barely a difference while leveling below 48
---
Probably 90% of the horde in the video don't think it's fun at all. But the vanilla PvP system incentivizes it.
---
Level 51 is the last time you can receive experience from the lowest of the mobs in here. Once you hit 52, you can start doing BRD exp runs with your friends to avoid the 1,000,000:1 Horde:Alliance ratios in world pvp
---
There are no accurate server populations out there. My server is very balanced and Alliance/Horde both fuck each other over constantly. It's just how it is.
---
You had IRC AND ventrilo. Discord conveniently combines the too, but these services were by no means complicated and everyone was on them. Spy sucks though.
---
Nice. Grats man, first max level in an "old school" mmo setting is definitely an accomplishment
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Can’t you just add in bloodrage before intercept to fix this?
---
Classic is the first time playing classic for me aswell. I would look on YouTube too see each entrance, then just tag along and follow the tanks lead. BRD is the easiest dungeon and you can get a nice belt there, called ban'thok sash
---
If you have bad gear there is some nice pieces you can buy off the auction house: felcloth gloves, felcloth shoulders, robe of winter night, of shadow wrath bracers etc
---
Lmk if you have any questions :)
---
Alliance Skeram checking in here, I have lost the will to play the game flat out.
---
And I have 2 60's on the server already.. too burned out on leveling to go elsewhere.
---
And when I say this the braindead horde on Skeram say "Go retail, you shouldn't have picked a pvp server"  etc.. it's just a bunch of shit man.
---
Wait will they eventually have arenas for sure? Did they say so?
---
I had my fun with it on private servers, but not really in the mood for it this time
---
It's probably not against the rules. They took cross faction communication out of the ToS ages ago and they definitely don't enforce it anywhere. I think it's safe to assume it's not against the rules anymore.
---
Im on yojamba too. I play a 60 ret casually and Ive just been living in SS doing SS vs TM and venturing with a raid to WPL/EPL/SG/BRM when we have the numbers. Had a great night a few days ago. This 52 pally Griff lead a full raid and we cleared SS many times, then cleared WPL, EPl, SG and then decented towards BRM and MC where we encountered a full horde raid . It was a crazy fight right at the entrance. Im pretty sure we won that one too. Was pretty cool. 
---
But yeah, i hear that its rough doing dungeons for alliance. Personally im into pvp more so this is my time to cash in on the fun.
---
its a 10 second cooldown, by the time you get back to the original mob it'll be back up pretty much, it's only to make sure it doesn't run off while everyone is dpsing it while you are generating aggro on the other mobs.
---
Grats my dude!
---
I doubt arenas will be in classic wow but that is my own speculation.
---
Oh, it's definitely great for tanks! It's just the way he went about it all, because honestly if it had dropped he probably would have gotten it. Even as a hunter I know that they need hit more than we do, but
---
You can choose from standard numbers or numpad ones, mine shows NUM1, NUM2, NUM3 or just 1, 2, 3. I assume that is indeed a F12 bound
---
There's not really any way to "improve" to the point of being able to survive against 5 people who are 10 levels higher than you and have epic mounts.
---
She
---
also think of RP servers
---
i wear rp gear chest and helm around cities.
---
From what I've watched of streams, Faerlina does look like a pretty brutal place to play alliance. I'm not sure what the ratio is over there but it seems like a lot of the dedicated pvpers have decided to roll horde, atleast that is my impression. It will surely get better when the BGs come around though, so hang in there man. Also, indeed there are some OP pots etc. I guess you just have to gather what you can and try to take advantage of it also.
---
I play on firemaw EU which is a fairly balanced full server, with moderate queue times during peak hours. I've been playing mostly in winterspring the last week and I try to stay in the outskirts. Sometimes I meet some other alliance and we bang some horde, sometimes we get banged, and sometimes I get some cool 1v1 or 1v2 :)
---
I've asked this before so I'll ask again....
---
Does anyone know how it was like during retail vanilla? Do those tree guys sprint across like they do now or were they super slow like on the pservers? The drop rate and the number of lasher groups the same as retail vanilla? I would like video evidence but I have a feeling that doesn't exist at all so I'll just take your word for it even if it is 15 years ago.
---
Tbh I'm not at all informed on the gear/loot situations for them so I don't really have a good perspective on the specific items they're looking for (rogues and our threat tank) or how much of an impact those items would be for them.
---
I believe you can't. No matter what, that will take 2 button presses. The first button press can change you to beserker and the second button press will cast intercept if you are in beserker.
---
Well you should not pop your bubble immediately when you ser a Horde around ;)
---
Personally I find the alliance yelling 'o k b o o m e r' and 'y o u lo se' funny. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
Why are you so triggered? Need a safespace little boy?
---
They're the same more or less.  Save the 100g.   The only time I would recommend it is if you are a dwarf.
---
FUCK YO COUCH!
---
I can't find anything immediately on the specific function, but all other report and ticket related functions are protected. So it's probably safe to assume this is as well.
---
I always preferred flametongue or rockbiter simply because their bonus damage is consistent. I don't like getting unlucky and struggling with a mob.
---
Yeah the humiliating thing is now I'm not only being ganked by 60s but also by their levelling alts who are tricked out in enchants and AH gear.
---
Most guilds aren’t going to give Mageblade to a pally
---
I sped ran wow classic and I now classic is boring since all I do is raidlog.
---
I felt like I wasted my real life lol.
---
What episode?
---
Sorry to hear you don't like it. However, it seems like you, along with many others have missed the point of this tool. It is stated in several places under the "How it works" tab, and in the "Detailed Overview" of spells how you should interpret the results.   
---
Combat encounters in WoW is not something you can put down in black and white numbers, and every choice of spell/rank is highly situational. I am just trying to facilitate the insight in how your spells work in relation to your gear. Not tell you to always use 1 specific rank, since I thought that was obvious.
---
There is still Battlegrounds. Once they're released.
---
lmao evil
---
I edited the original post and added the full macro.   
---
Also tyvm for taking a look at.  
---
I know nothing about macro's, but am surprised what possibilities there are :D
---
Disclosure: This is my Spec:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhsZfbtccbqxx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhsZfbtccbqxx) 
---
Question: What did you spec to heal?
---
Ideas: A. Respec back to shadow outside of Raids. B. Spec more Hybrid so you don't feel useless. C. Level an Alt
---
My advice: If you go more +Spell damage instead of +Shadow, you can do admirable Smite DPS. I "DPS" in Strat UD and Scholo and do fine with my gear. Scholo and DM have a lot of decent-ish spell damage gear, so you should be fairly decked out especially if you build two sets. Necrophile is great for PVP, as is Devout. I don't mention BRD/LBRS because it's impossible to get there easily as Alliance on my server, but if you run that you can get some decent gear from there too to melt faces.
---
Possible Hybrid Spec for Dungeons/World PVP while not being terrible. I would go this way if I did walk into a raid. Should be perfectly fine for everything that requires less than 20 people. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhoZfotccZxMGucd](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhoZfotccZxMGucd)
---
Clever girl.
---
horde dominated ? try 25%-75% on stonespine EU
---
Hopefully you can stay alive long enough to get that dice roll.
---
the bright side is they've grown tired of wasting mana/time killing me as a 25 leveling ride outside hillsbrad. THe key is to be persistent, the grave is like 15 seconds away from bears/spiders, eventually you will break their will, and you will be leveling right along side ?? gnome scums on robotic peacocks
---
My understanding is that there is a bug with the world bosses that causes the loot to go to someone other than the loot master. In this case, the loot master got the tag on Azuregos, got the kill, received the gold from the kill, could see the loot, but couldn’t pick up the loot. This bug is not related to kicking people during the fight.
---
Most damage will come from auto shot. However aimed shot and multi shot should be used on cool down. Ensuring to not clip off the auto shot. Also sadly due to debuff limitation serpent sting should not be used.
---
Something to consider is the reporting bias. 
---
Meaning, it seems like more people are saying “wPvP is bad because xxx happened” because there’s no real reason for people to post “world PvP is good (or neutral) because xxx didn’t happen”. Same reason for restaurant reviews and whatnot. People are more inclined to vocalize their opinions and experience when they are negative.

I can't tell if you're loony or just shit stirring lol.
---
If you are on a PVP server I'd say go with Dungeon leveling - either in AOE groups or normal
---
If you are PVE it really comes down to what you enjoy more.
---
Have not played hunter, but do slower attacks gain more % of +AP, akin to spell coefficients for casters?
---
You aren’t grasping the bigger picture
---
We have a mage with a half second delay between frostbolts. Is there a macro or something to reduce that or should she just spam the frostbolt button harder?
---
Mostly herbs and consumables. I have dozens of black lotuses, which I bought at ~17g. They're now at 50-70g. 
---
That stuff is only getting more expensive.
---
Risen and cozy always make groups and fight, but other than them, from my perception as horde there seems to be less people to kill each day.
---
would've been better if you had the camera distance the same and the hand position the same

This dude is a pussy asses bitch and we find it funny that he posted a story describing himself as a pussy asses bitch.

He fantasizes about stuff like this knowing the reality: he was easy honor that the mage stumbled upon

Nobody seems to remember what it was like in retail vanilla. I wish someone remembers and would post their thoughts here. I know asking for video evidence from 2004 is asking too much and probably doesn't exist.

Stop spreading this misinformation that equip effects count toward the cap, they never did.

Enchants did count toward it, but it was a bug. Currently, echants originating from items count toward the buff cap, i.e. scopes and head/leg enchants

This was the exact reason I rolled on a pve server after spending all of my time playing wow on a pvp server. people can call me a pansy or say I am only playing 50% of the game, but I am still having fun minding my own business questing in EPL without worrying about a roving group of alliance getting ready to pounce on me(25/75 H/A ratio on my server).
---
Easy -- go instance farm Mara (can look up tons of videos on killing the snakes / turtles). That farm is good all the way through level 52 and no competition, since it's in an instance. Yes, you'd have to respec to a proper AOE spec (with improved blizzard and not frostbite)
---
It’s all about controlling the narrative. What loot?
---
But... honor in groups and raids is already nerfed... you're literally describing something similar to what already exists in the game.

Thanks, I will give it my best shot!!

I don't actually hang on the discord and I didn't watch the movie so whatever is going on here I don't know what to say except fuck me I guess. Just trying to help someone out.
---
Are you using Frost Nova to keep the mob in place? How is your talent tree currently? Mages do have to drink almost after every pull, that's how the class plays, but you shouldn't be taking that much damage. Mages are amazing at killing a ton of mobs and taking no damage (look at AoE grinding strats), so maybe there's something wrong with your approach to the class. However, if you don't like having to drink all the time, maybe do consider a reroll.
---
Is there a reason it should default to pally/shamans over wars? I know shamans cant use swords but that excuse doesnt work with pallys
---
 Horde says 'f j f I ÌÍ € c €', Alliance reads 'a n a l ur m o m'.   best pvp macro
---
Wait, I confused you, how? :p
---
Unless you play at weird hours, just quest.
---
I play on Atiesh and unless it’s 3am est - 9am est every Aoe location is camped... and my server is mid-high pop. I cant imagine AOE grinding is worth it when there are multiple mages camping the same location
---
I'm aliance on a Pvp server, maybe it's different on high pop servers but my experience was only occasionally frustrating
---
Wow as alliance Thunderfury, i got fucked joining my friends on this server. Its more than 2:1 horde favor.
---
Uh huh
---
You should stop playing this shitty game with your shitty guild and your shitty friends and your shitty dog and shitty girlfriend and your shitty attitude. lol.
---
Reading through the replies I haven't seen anyone mention mob tagging with skull/cross symbols. 
---
In the basic interface options you can bind these symbols to keybinds. I recommend doing this and marking enemies for every fight. Sometimes people just need a little visual aid to focus your target.

Prot Warriors are fucking useless in W-PVP unless you have a core group who work extremely well around the fact that you're a tank. W-PVP is typically random, unbalanced, and rarely suited for situations where a tank might be useful.
---
But BG's have objectives. King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, etc. These moments are where Prot Warriors shine.
---
Five dudes barge in and steal your flag? Great, just kill the flag carrier. Oh wait, he's a fucking tank with a priest healing him indefinitely while he mad runs back to his base to cap the flag. Well lets just focus down the tank right? Wrong. Everyone is protecting him and killing you while he runs. So you kill the others instead but now he's basically getting a free run back to base.
---
Or you take the risk and blow all your load on the tank, knowing full well he's got the armor, health, and resistance to potentially survive.
---
A tank with a good healer and a mage can hold a choke point, run flags, push through enemy lines, or hold down objectives. They make decent flag defenders too. You can easily harass the enemy while they try to capture the flag, alert your team, and the enemy may spend too much time trying to kill you which gives your team time to come back and defend the flag.
---
So in short Tanks in W-PVP are fucking useless unless in a really good premade.
---
But tanks in BG's actually have a place and can be quite effective.
---
Against any melee mob, i do ok.  Any ranged mob nearly kills me.
---
Spell batching is something like 400ms and is supposed to combat that kind of latency. Just need to hit your next frostbolt while the previous one is casting. Someone correct me if I'm wrong please.
---
Yea not sure what OP is going on about. Being in Raids for honor is the least lucrative way to rank up. People have already realized this and are PvPing in smaller groups.
---
If it's such a terrible game no one is making you stay... Vanilla WoW isn't for everyone. Asking Blizz to change things in a game that is essentially a historical replay of an old game is hilarious.  I get you are fed up and angry about getting ganked. But I have a really hard time believing that ANYWHERE you go you get insta ganked. I spent 4 hours in STV the other day and only saw one other human player the entire time while I killed/farmed shit.
---
Come Dec. 10th there will be a lot less wPVP
---
I'd like to let someone enchant my weapon with Spell Power , but the mats are really expensive on my server (around 250g) so a thought crossed my mind that what if I trade the mats to a person and he just keeps them. Can people just enchant it through a trade window . Also does it happen often ? I have trust issues . Thank you for the answer
---
Hell yeah, I wish I would have used it from 53 on... I leveled from 59 to 60 in an hour and a half or so doing lbrs xp runs
---
Imp eviscerate is trash for PvE.
---
No I am. There's no posts about improving at fair pvp because fair pvp doesn't exist due to the current setup. Maybe once BGs drop, you will see more posts about improving pvp skill. For now, they are useless because the majority of pvp is getting blasted 10:1.
---
IDK where you've been but honor already is terrible in raids.  If you're in a 40man, kills grant 1-9 honor.  Thats it.  If you're in a 5 man, you get in the 40-80 range depending.  200 per solo kill.
---
I guess my comment was based on the fact that you really could not need anything in that far away picture depicting any horde takeover. A closer shot would have been better showing dead NPCs and horde patrolling the streets..
---
Just spend some time learning more about what your abilities do, when warriors are geared the fuck out in pvp and raid gear, and have shadow reflector, they can have a good chance (equally skilled) killing you especially if they get the charge in, but leveling, a warrior should not have a hope in hell against you. If you have voidwalker on and he engages, sac it, put your dots on him while you're waiting for berserker rage to end, then fear him. from there it's pretty much over for him, especially if you didn't have to burn deathcoil. IF you have succubus, just seduce him 3 times, and in beteen each seduce hit him with a shadow bolt + shadowburn, afte the third time just send it in to attack him (because he'll start resisting the seduce) dot him up them deathcoil or fear him away, take your succubus off of him while hes feared.
---
The worst mobs are those like elementals that are frost resistant.
---
If you typed 411 Healing Power in, the tool will recommend rank 4 Healing Touch. The breakpoint for the default settings is 406 mana. You might benefit from looking at the Detailed Overview I have made for each spell, which gives some general tips, and shows how the different ranks scale with healing power.
---
Its not useless. Ive seen players run ret in BGs...it kind of depends on your play style. You make not like healing and thats cool but dont expect to do the kind of dmg other DPS classes are doing in a BG...if you want to be beefy on the BG then you might look at Prot but I found that build to be pretty boring and kind of slow. If you want to be a productive member and highly sought after for pre-mades holy pally is the way to go.
---
This is already in game, unless you're in a BG you get awarded less honor while in a group lol...?
---
You may wanted to research this before starting a thread :P
---
You finished the water totem quest? Grats!
---
Mage would compliment,as opposed to synergize.
---
Ie a mage would bring ranged dps. Mage could synergize with shaman, but warrior would lose out and vice versa. It rewlly depends what kind of shammy your bud wants to play.
---
That said, mage, healer, tank is a fantastic setup for dungeons.
---
Welcome to the club brother
---
And your rank on a pve server is meaningless, so what's the point in being rank 1 or 14 lmao. You can get it with 30 minutes of 'playing' because everybody on the server is a skillless casual who doesn't engage in pvp and thus reduces the pool to non-existent. Thanks for proving it with this post though; when a weird flex backfires horribly lmao.
---
Just keep backing up dude eventually you will back up all the way to the end of the flat earth.
---
Show me where he touched you
---
Some people are so obsessed with WoW they can't imagine other people quitting.
---
Do not fuckle with Shuckle.
---
So... like macro stance dance onto number 4 and then have intercept also on 4 and then mash 4 to get the same result?
---
Try
---
#show tooktip Intercept
---
/castsequence reset=10/target Berserker Stance, Intercept
---
I usually just get on and run my farming route for 30 minutes before and after work so it doesnt feel like ive farmed a whole bunch or anything. Seems like quite a few people figured out my spot though so im starting to get competition. Thankfully I've hoarded all my thorium and dense stone so im set on my ammunition for a long time.
---
Depends on your play style. Do you want burst or survivability while whittling them down? If the first one then Conflag/Nightfall is so damn fun in BGs/WPvP, if the latter then go with your SL build.
---
Damn congrats on the devilsaur set! I wish I will be able to once afford it too
---
That must be disappointing for the GM to have a bunch of prebis raiders that laugh at the notion of raiding.
---
Should have started on pve server. I regret i didnt.
---
No thank you!
---
For PvE, def humans because of the bonus to swords and maces 
---
For PvP I would say gnome because of the bonus to engineering and also their racial, escape artist
---
It still does
---
Kurinnaxx represent!
---
Let’s be real, Whisp Form  is underrated.
---
do dungeons for bis 
---
it's not the fastest gold ever but you're working on your raiding gear and you'll get money from it, you can do several quests per dungeon that just give cash at 60, and you can help guildies. In particular you'll have to do a lot of ubrs and lbrs for Briarwood Reed and Skyshroud Leggings+Hands of Power respectively, not to mention getting your own UBRS key (and the Robe of the Archmage blueprint if you don't want to buy it from the market)
---
Essence of Water has a 30% drop rate from those spots, so it's been 1 per 3 pools you fish, and then once I got 4 from one spot. The RNG is crazy.
---
On average, though, you do end up with 1 essence per pool.
---
Ahh! Better get that enchant so I hit 425 then. To bad 420 didn't fit that spot lol!
---
gnome's racial is pretty nice for pvp, break roots and stuns.
---
for pvp gnome&gt;dwarf&gt;human&gt;NE, imo.
---
That sounds like a good way to get banned yourself as well as your guildies banned. Something like that would probably be against the TOS.
---
How am I backing up? This is your argument:
---
"I get ganked a lot, so instead of trying to do something about it I go on Reddit and wallow in sadness, then I get back in game and Taunt the other faction that kills me because I'm so tired of them killing me"
---
only if it wasn't crossrealm battlegroups, which they are.
---
Nice dude, you finish water totem quest
---
No don’t do it, the xp is mega nerfed
---
&gt;My thinking is that Blizzard would continually census players above an arbitrary level (5?) who have been active in the past 90 days. These results would then be published next to each individual realm.
---
Publishing such information just makes the problem worse.
---
&gt;Realms which are too far skewed in either direction (60/40?) would mechanically restrict new toons of the offending faction and allow free realm transfers to less biased realms.
---
An absolutely atrocious idea. Sorry jimmy, you can't play with your friends because there's too many horde on this server already!
---
So edgy, you play undead rogue?
---
I personally pick dwarves, since you get remove bleed/poison/disease racial which allows you to restealth.
---
In my experience it seems like a lot of the `LFG` stuff has died down on my server now with random people grouping up to go smash some World PVP.
---
The other day we were trying to get a guild UBRS run together for some fresh 60's to complete parts of the Ony Key quest line, and like 70% of the lvl 60's in guild were like "Can't, doing PVP in Tarren Mill!!!"
---
This is how it was in Vanilla. Its worse now because there's more people.
---
You were warned. I first hand told people on this sub the game would be unplayable after honor was introduced. If you didn't listen or didn't realize that's just on you. I guess people shouldn't downvote stuff just because they don't want it to be true.
---
yes.
---
harder than ya think!
---
Get ring/trinket rewards for bear, there are several that can’t really be replaced by anything else. Healing quest rewards will pretty much all be replaced by other drops. I’m resto, leveled resto, and picked resto rewards - that were good for me at the time - but I regret not picking the bear rewards.
---
I also recommend checking gear on the sixtyupgrades sites.
---
This is a really good write up for OP, except I think it’s perfectly acceptable to roll Dru if you exclusively want to bear tank, resto heal, or Feral PvP. All of those are perfectly serviceable in their roles if you specifically enjoy that spec, even if you don’t particularly care to take advantage of the class’s versatility.
---
Do your eyes work?
---
Thanks for the reply! I’ll look into some hybrid specs. I didn’t know they were feasible for raiding. I’m currently finishing up the cookie cutter 21/30/0 spec.
---
What does it mean?
---
Rogue has sap. Poly is best tho.
---
When every flight path is camped by the opponsing faction because they have more than twice the amount of players online, it stops being wpvp at that point.
---
The world is a little darker.
---
Blizzard doesn't have to fix anything in the game because of #NoChanges. Must be nice for them...
---
Paladin or druid. Paladins are basically unkillable if your spec is even part holy, but especially with prot mixed in. Druids are both easy and hard, with a very high skill ceiling. They also level a bit faster than Paladins, plus you have stealth. Both of these classes also give you the option of tanking if that interests you, but druid is the easier class for that role (pally tanking involves a lot of mana management).
---
Shaman still levels quickly and has some resilience, but not as much as these other two classes. Totem management may also drive you crazy.
---
Priest is an amazing healing class and very sustainable in solo questing, but in PvP you'll get absolutely reamed by melee classes as a healer.
---
Ive spent a few nights trying out kargath to searing gorge to burning stepps, its always underwhelming.  Roaming around for 10 min to only get about 4 kills and there are 20 other vultures running to get your tag as well. Its never been worth it. Blackrock related zones either have few alliance or full alliance raids holding the mountain,  not much in between.  I hate this phase so much because its like a scavenger hunt to find alliance to kill and even when you find some you have 30 other dudes fighting for the tag. Nobody is happy. The #1 standing guy on horde is a rogue literally in ironforge 24/7, never seen them offline
---
Still waiting to see that horde skill, hard to tell when no one will fight you 1v1.
---
theyve never given dates or planned months have they? an you point to a post saying they ever said April 2020?
---
Im on a 50:50 server and Alliance are just as bad as Horde with trying to snowball, then when the fight gets fair their raid goes somewhere else.
---
I hate how as a level 53 I'm seeing me and every other questing ally die by horde death squads, then going to IF and seeing 200 geared up level 60s chilling near AH lmao.
---
That never happened on my server sadly, but it did make for some fun times with mind control!
---
Do your arms get bigger as you level?
---
The BG queues are cross realm so horde times may be slightly longer, but overall won't really matter.
---
We're talking maybe 1-2 minute difference.
---
The flip side of this is the Horde are probably going to have more premade groups which will just farm honor for hours while holding the flag.
---
This is all assumption though, only way to really see is wait until Dec 10.
---
Is it possible to learn this macro?
---
Once in a while is ‘not matter what time or day’ it’s not if it’s when and how bad
---
Nothing to do but honor farm right now for a big portion of level 60's.  Less people lfg because those people already finished getting their gear and/or have a raid group for the week already.
---
can we get a zerg shitpost next for all the alliance on incendius that roll around in a 30 man raid for 2 honor drops per kill. big skill
---
The WoW one... Make Love Not Warcraft
---
Because of AP and Ammo contribution to damage being higher for slower weapons, the crossbow is the one with the higher weapon damage.
---
Get wrektd my dudes!
---
It's the main and only premise of the game, go watch the trailer again if you forgot.
---
If you are mainly going to raid, it's humans.
---
For pvp gnomes are solid bcause escape artist helps support a big weakness for rogues.  Humans' perception is great for countering rogues.  Dwarves stoneform is fine, but less good since it really only affects other rogues.  Night elves should be purged from the game.
---
That's what I was thinking too, but my memory has been so terrible with that sort of thing I've stopped trying to guess.
---
I've seen people get ambushed in org ah on Stalagg. Nowhere's safe.
---
Alliance on skeram isn't that bad IF YOU PLAY FROM 12 TO 4AM SERVER TIME.  I know cuz I play during that time
---
I can post my macro here later. At work now but when i log in i can copy paste it in a reply.
---
There's at least a few pallys on fairbanks with sulfuros, so yeah, they can kill people
---
Most, but imo it won't matter like you think.
---
The Alliance may get quick queues, but it's not like the horde will be looking at 1+ hour long queues. Probably 1-5 minutes for Alliance and 5-10 for horde.
---
Shit tier comments usually get downvoted, yeah that’s how it usually works on reddit
---
I know why he would do it.
---
Kinda stupid to blow trust this early. Obviously smoke him and never let him be #1 again.
---
cheers pal!
---
Depending on which number you believe, the fact that 1 and 2 were different brackets means less than 1,000 or 667 players on your server that got 15+ HKs. Seems a little low but not unreasonable for a PvE realm.
---
Got ganked huh?
---
flamelash eu
---
PvP servers are great. Yes right now you have three weeks of a shitshow but it will be back to normal. Most people on PvP servers are chill, I barely pvped while leveling not now not in private servers not in vanilla and not in beta. If you are not the aggressor and wanna quest most people are like-minded . Right now it's a shit show but this will change in three weeks. And yes it was like this in vanilla too. Not thaaaat bad because of the percentu if people that are 60 now and have nothing to do compared to then but you couldn't quest without PvP killing on sight either. It all changed the day bgs released and it will change this time likewise
---
Or you know, they're out PVPing and enjoying the game. There are shit tons more people out in the world on our server than before, and the cities are still packed even with all the people in the world.
---
*horde if you're on pagle
---
what's the cost in consumables though, like 5g?
---
lol well no shit dude
---
It's a post making fun of lvl 60's who kill low levels that stand no chance against them.
---
Stealing mats is a bannable offense, and blizzard will return your mats if it ever happens. Nothing to worry about
---
Lol typical brain dead horde
---
Main tanks always have something they could be grinding. Comes with the territory lol.
---
\&gt; Just a game
---
\&gt; Words over the internet
---
Pick one.
---
I am still waiting for someone to explain how interacting with a game designed for one avatar at time by controlling many avatars at a time is "not cheating" it sure sounds like a duck to me
---
Mysterious is totally invited to my next party
---
I play alliance on a horde dominated server and I will kill and grief horde any chance I get and I expect nothing less in return. I have no empathy for the opposite faction in a video game that puts us at war with each other.
---
What do you mean ? All of Method is back at playing retail.
---
You can try to sugar coat it all you want, but Paladins are easily more impactful to high level play (particularly group PvP) than any of the Horde racials. Let’s also not try to act like the Alliance racials aren’t good...
---
What's crazy is that you're comparing paying your mortgage or car payment to paying for 40 fuckin World of Warcraft Classic subscriptions to do 15 year old raids by yourself.
---
Pretty much a dead subreddit, unfortunately.
---
why not just ignore them? as long as you don't engage them they can't touch you, if they want to farm DKs let them.
---
In two weeks it will all be back to normal
---
I just mean it's an odd feeling forming groups without LFG tools and having an abundance of healers. At least it is for me.
---
take care of our refuges, maybe one day they will return
---
Snowflakes have entered the chat
---
Ya happens all the time. I was in a LBRS and fire protection pot recipe dropped. The only alchemist was like 10 points away from using, and he rolled anyways. Everyone else got pissed because they wanted to list it on the AH instead of it going to the alchemist. Then someone pulled a bunch of shit and wiped us and the group broke up. Happens all the time.
---
Anything you summon with a engineering trinket, like battle chicken or dragonling will be lvl 63. So its kinda nice in pvp, and for arcanite dragonling for raid bosses
---
That's just... just..... JUST......... brilliant ¬.¬' F'ing gnomes...
---
There is doubt, because Old Men Gaming got the tag, killed the boss, and didn’t get the loot because of a bug
---
What about rogue?
---
Dude ppl enchant with other ppls mats all the time. I've actually never heard of anyone just rolling off with the mats in a "your mats enchant deal"
---
It’s so boring. I did it once for 10-15 minutes because of friends and it was not exciting at all lmao.
---
There is nothing wrong with reserving gear. It makes sense. It's your time playing game and if you don't want to compete for loot it's completely reasonable as long as you state before hand what is going down.
---
The people who are against it, aren't acting rationally. They expect you to play by a standard that is advantageous to them and if you suggest other wise, they get upset about it.
---
&gt; because he only moved 10metres during 5 death
---
Does he not realize you can spawn near your body and not just on it? I think you'd get more than 10 meters off a single spawn.
---
It's a video game bro. One where horde and alliance are at war with each other. Gtfo of here with your morality talk lol
---
I see the Alliance downvote brigade is here. Haha.
---
quartz I believe
---
Fury in WOTLK ? You sure you are not thinking about Cata ? Because that's when Fury became more relevant in pvp.
---
[This is something thats happening on mulitple servers, its not something that was happening on this scale back in Vanilla.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dz8ht5/the_descent_into_hell_entering_brd_as_alliance_on/)
---
&gt; bootlicker
---
Oh you learned a new word. 
---
I'm not advocating that everyone be forced to PVP. For those that dont like the PVP ruleset, there are PVE servers.
---
If your solution to the PVP rule set is "make the servers PVE", youre the authoritarian/bootlicker. You had a choice to not be under the PVP ruleset, nobody forced you to roll there.
---
so if the geared 60 didn't complain, it won't be griefing?
---
The individual server subreddits are dead, so this would be nice to have
---
Yeah I played on a pve server during vanilla so most of my wpvp experience was dumb stuff like fighting in the barrens or south Shore.  I just wish I started with everyone else is all.
---
Or 3) preventing the other side from gaining strength by any means necessary. I know you said it is a facade but that is something I would firmly believe I am doing when I stopping raid loot from being put on the backs of the other faction. That's why I rolled a pvp server, it adds a layer on top of all the other systems in place.
---
But my friend made a druid already, his girlfriend made a lock, so I got a nice leech all the way to 50 pretty easily.
---
Casting aimed shot at the start of new auto shot allows that auto shot to go off at the end of the cast regardless of the auto shot time.
---
I would never not kill any horde, at any level, for any reason, after what happened starting last week.
---
Taking a chill pill is how we ended up with #45. done being silent when I see cheating,
---
Well I'm a rogue so imbalance doesn't effect me quite as much I guess and I'm basically done with dungeons so I don't have to corpse run to them. But from what I've seen it can go back and forth in blackrock and the plaguelands but the horde have Kalimdor camped the fuck out. Gadgetzan was a nightmare when I went to get artisan engineering, fucking Ziqo and his group just running into town aoeing anything target down and running town with the guards unable to do shit. Sucks not having a good capital in Kalimdor there's just no way Alliance can really take the fight there beyond getting into Ony and fighting for Azuregos.
---
Yikes dude
---
Must be nice having useful racial passives lol.
---
when you level up just remember to kos
---
I'm running 30/0/21 currently and I like it. [My build.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55030155000015--5500130100501) I didn't get anything in Eye of the storm and I'm not sure if that was a good move or not yet. There have been times when I'm eating a ton of push back and I wish I had it. If I made a change I might move the shock CD stuff over to EOTS. I don't really pvp at all, so I don't know how this compares to the 30/0/21 pvp build.
---
It's more commonly done for Vael, but I have not heard of anyone needing it for Rag - maybe in the first week or two, when everybody is still coming to raid in partial Green gear.
---
Why would you flag in ironforge?
---
Read it again.
---
&gt;They've never caved so fast.
---
DM and Early phase 2 were the same thing. The second subs start to dip, Blizz is just gonna release the next content patch or phase
---
It was a massive blunder by Blizzard to release honour without BGs.
---
Oooo I didn’t know about this. There’s  a free crusader enchant cause I figured I would be forking out 900g for the mount.
---
Does anyone know I get rank 3, will I digress below to say rank 2 if I don’t pvp for a week?
---
At this point I know of at least 4 other people that have the pattern on our server.  It's not a big deal.  I also don't get wrapped up in guild or server drama.
---
Don't you mean 80-man Zugs?
---
RATTLEGANG...even though you're nasty Horde scum
---
Mage will probably be higher gph grinding lashers or ZF than hunter doing mara or DM:N.  DM:N can be best gph in the game, but you have to get fairly lucky with drops and find buyers that don't take ages to come pick up the gear for the chest.  But really, you can't go wrong with mage, lock or hunter for farming.  They're in a league above all the other classes.
---
I stopped because its impossible to level as an Alliance player on my realm, the population is heavily skewed toward to Horde.
---
What in the PVE server fuckery is this?
---
cant relate, i dont play on bitch servers
---
I don't know who made the video but there was a couple good ones for hunters making gold while leveling. Especially with skinning. Best of luck
---
Even realm forums are dead.
---
100% accuracy is a silly ask, would be like demanding your weather be shown in 0.000001 degree increments, per mm2 of land.  +/- 10% error and the accuracy would still be totally acceptable.
---
Yes. Everyone has to confirm to get into the bg. Scout goes first and checks to see if everyone is from the same server, then signals back to his team. If they dodge then only the scout gets a 15 min penalty from being able to que. The other side has to wait like 5 min for the bg to close.
---
Stupid question can rogue vanish or stealth why in combat?  Like say I'm pvping and I'm running low on hp about to die to this pos horde can I just gouge and stealth and run away from the fight?
---
Hey there. Bosses are not immune but you will never see the buff on the boss as it gets pushed off by everything, even deep woods. So it's totally useable
---
If you've never done a world boss then you probably do not understand the chaos behind it. I was part of the alliance first on my server and can tell you that it is 10-15 minutes of absolute madness. Our guild had no intention of doing the world bosses but this kind of stumbled upon us. We gather what guildies we can while filling in with pugs all while learning boss mechanics on the fly. Oh shit an officer in my guild isn't in here. WTF there's 2 lvl 50s in the raid (kick). We only have 3 healers, we need to make room for more (kick more ppl). I can't speak for these guys and their intention, but it's not even comparable to how a dungeon or raid group works.

It isn’t super fast but check out Vildjharta. The song Dagger is great and heavy as shit. Instrumental version is the best. It screams warrior/death knight.

I personally used to log out in shit gear just to fuck with the people who think it matters what gear you wear around town. Inspect me at the raid if you think I'm wearing shit gear.

But this is true....

But this sub likes to downvote truth and upvote idiocy.

I think alot of people in here are missing an important aspect that makes him that much more popular than other streamers. He is trying to constantly keep the audience entertained. Where other streamers might be have downtime from chatting with other players, finding new songs, taking too many breaks etc. Even if its just for 30 seconds, that will make people go watch somebody else instead. I realize it doesn't mean you can't have these small breaks and still be popular, but it might be a different audience you're catering to then.
---
Yeah just like I thought dude, keep that mind closed.
---
On whitemane it's the alliance spamming O K B O O M E R and go back to retail and all that jazz a hell of a lot more than horde lol. People spam cause it's fun for them, no skin off my back.
---
Same exact that for the castbar addon, which isn’t a part of the game by default. People want to pick and choose what’s allowed because it impacts their particular class more etc. same old wow.

As a Not-Mage and Not-Warlock, I remember in TBC the rotation was 1. Shadowbolt 2. Repeat, ditto Frost. I found for Warrior or Rogue DPS at the time that it was fairly easy to find the 99% ideal DPS rotations. No class should have a very complicated rotation, past "keep buffs/debuffs up, and these are the 3-4 skills and the priority in which you use them."
---
No. Rogue is actually a trash rogue class and you're much better off picking rogue IMHO.
---

im almost on my third 60 rip

Not everyone played OG vanilla or private servers like me, like my rogue has 12/16 prebis and 2/8 nightslayer and I’m running 5 mage multibox through SM GY/Lib repeatedly
---
The imbalance was there, but not nearly as bad, at first. Then they had the first wave of transfers, and a few major guilds left. News spread, panic ensued in the rest of us that didn't want to end up in situations demonstrated in this thread. So more guilds left, exasperating the problem. 
---
Every part of this is Blizzard's fault from botching the name reservations and server roll outs during launch week, to not locking transfers to faction or having any kind of faction based queue, etc. I'm almost convinced they want Classic to fail to try to entice people to play Shadowlands instead.
---
That's still not at all accurate tbh. I'm sure there are a ton of guilds who don't log.
---
We usually have around 4 warlocks, I didn't even think about just keeping them banished, I know that having them banished will trigger Rag to pop up again. I'll bring that up with our raid lead tonight. Thanks!
---
That’s all well and good but once again not at all relevant to what I was saying. I’m not sure where reading comprehension got thrown into a gutter that people aren’t understanding that. This thread is about toxic world PvP. My response as in regards to someone implying world PvP is like it is because of enhanced methods of communication and optimization. This is false. It takes neither to flock around in packs of 20 or camp the flight masters. World PvP is the way it is because server size mostly and maybe a few other minor factors. Which you touched on in number 6.
---
My post wasn’t talking about pve, raids, leveling, or any other content. It wasn’t in response to a post about that. This thread isn’t even about that. I’m not sure how you could possibly misconstrue it.

cool story bro. 
---
btw, you can always add their name as a battlenet friend and chat with them. I've made a horde friend myself after dueling several times outside of Gadget. We both complain about getting ganked constantly.
---
You think the game is just going to up and end in a year? You think that in 2 years time there's not going to be a single player left to run stuff with? 
---
I duno man that seems pretty farfetched to me, how about instead if telling other people how to play or enjoy the game or at what pace they want focus more on yourself and what you enjoy, find a guild who progresses the same speed you want to and ride out classic with a solid group of buddies.
---
If mr monopoly released a set of rules saying the game has to be played the fast way now I wouldnt go telling those people it's too fast or their wrong, I would find a group of friends who enjoyed the slower version and play with them and not give a single care in the world what the faster players are doing. There's enough problems in the world to waste time worrying that people are clearing bosses faster then you are when they'll be available for the next decade, classic isn't going anywhere.
---
Just my 2 cents, opinions tend to get downvoted around here. All the best
---
Saaaaaaaame
---
I believe they're either there or fairly close, we're going to get the buff from LBRS our next attempt since Horde own the mountain on our server.
---
On a rogue it’s pretty damn nice.  The extra swings are extra poison application chances too.  I tried my hardest to justify getting the 2% hit trinket over hoj but it’s just better.  Even without the ap it’s better.  And there aren’t many trinkets you can get.
---
They tried this, we had constant AOE on the spot and everyone was buffed with everything. I think they needed to use a LIP
---
Ask cdew.
---
it's not impossible, do dungeons.
---
Can't get in to BRM?  Do a less camped dungeon.
---
Have leveled my alt from 48 to 57 since phase 2 came out.  Just stop questing and chain dungeons that you can actually get to.  Easy.
---
I feel for the low alliance pop servers but on relatively balanced servers it really isn't a huge problem to avoid the ganks squads for the most part.
---
Look I get that your attempt to tear me down off my high horse of no cheating is to make me question myself but I am resolute on this and I have the moral win here. next
---
A lot of early ones are going to Shamans
---
I'm glad you agree.
---
Is that possible with an early progression guild? We haven't been raiding long.
---
And go where really? Horde is more than 50% for most of them. All that is going to happen is people jumping to an alliance dominates server making it worse for the horde there.
---
You must have missed the part of my post where I said I was using pseudo code because I'm on a phone....
---
I'm surprised you're missing how easy this is to implement. Just create a new event to register that's identical to COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED but with enemy player events filtered out and then block 3rd party add-ons from registering COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED. It's so painfully simple you either are a terrible data engineer or you're intentionally spreading misinformation because you want to keep spy.
---
I think you need to look up the definition and concept of a closed mind.
---
Agreed, the lock is an idiot. I'm barely pre-bis geared and I pull aggro off of fully geared Quel'serar MT's in our guild if I get lucky with crits early on in the fight. In dungeons it's even worse, no tank can hold aggro over me if I spam shadowbolt + apply all DOTs during the fight. Warlocks have the highest threat generation of any DPS class in the game, so much so, that by AQ/Naxx we actually have to respec to demonology for threat reduction.
---
Ayee gratz from a fellow horde kurinnax player ♥.
---
I think our tanks were dying because the MT healers were all stacked up, so a fireball sends them all flying. This is one the changes we're making.
---
Not for MC, it’s better then 2 points in murder

Alliance on Stalagg here. I’ve grown to enjoy the server. It’s absolutely hell at times, but the joy of grouping together and overcoming extreme odds against us is so very rewarding!

Warrior, checks out. Rage level? 100/100. Copypasta level? 100/100

Ruthlessness is amazing for both
---
Lo-fi when questing, Tool when in dungeons/raids/PvP.
---
DM:E and W are pretty easy to get to, sure you might die once or twice but it's not like BRD/BRS.
---
A lot of the complaints are just a case of "I've tried nothing and nothing is working".  You have to adapt to the situation.
---
If you see arena runs posted by 60s it usually is just for arena. Warriors and hunters farming for savage glad chest. Seen them posted as "Brd spellcleave" or "brd leveling runs". 52+? depends on role i guess

Gnomish Cloaking Device, too. Saves on pots, but is a 1hr cd.
---
This is where you give masterloot to a rogue / fearl dr00d. 
---
Send him in and have him loot everything to himself.  once done accept a GY rez,  then do the rolls in raid and trade the loot out as necessary.
---
the secret is to level pally and war together

Pve player likes playing, pvp player likes winning (effects of losing vary).

Gee, I remember *my* first time playing WoW.

Take a break dude... you need it.

I did the exact same thing! Then crafted at least 6 morr to sell.
---
Awesome, thank you for the response. I will grind rep the week before I will have the mount money. 
---
So will it be 800g for the training and mount purchase?
---
Nothing to apologize for, that's a perfectly valid observation to question. I purposely avoided mentioning Stockades and RFC too, but yeah, it's all good.
---
I’m agreeing it’s silly that this would fall under the purview of not changes
---
What I don’t get is they brought back the “original” av for the retail 15 year event. So why don’t they do on classic too.
---
Yeah where's the 900 line soliloque that brings me to tears. No effort, smh.
---
/s
---
Yeah i think this is a better solution. Its not like Blizzard doesnt have the technology to do so.
---
Nobody cares you are on a PVE server

Ah, a man of class

I was amazed you guys managed to get so much coordination at 4am 2 hours after the fact. I was there trying to stop you, but hats off. Well played good sirs.

---
reported to thrall
---
Copying would be a neat feature, and they'd not really lose anything by it. If anything, it would simulate launch conditions for TBC better without crippling classic servers like transfers would.
---
There’s a ton of balanced NA servers....??
---
That only works if you assume that pve players won't play BGs, which I believe is an unfair assumption. Across all servers, faction representation is *mostly* equal. I guess it depends on how the matchmaker works, but I wouldn't expect much of a delay in finding a match between the factions at launch.
---
PvE server means the total pool is likely less than 500 people, so there's only 1 person who can get standing 1 which gives 13.000 ranking points, where standing 2 to X get about 12.000  
---
    
---
Must be absolutely brutal to rank on a pve server at the moment, basically every kill you get is against a person who bluewalls you (an old term for pve server pvp where a person is guaranteed the first hit since they can't be attacked until they enable it or perform a hostile pvp action)
---
Is everyone elixired up and have gfpp? We basically do the same strategy as you and kill him with like 30sec until submerge. If he is submerging at 25% your dps is just too low or they are dying early.
---
My god. Both sides say this *constantly*. 
---
"ThEy NeVeR aTtAcK uNlEsS iTs 3v1!!!1!"
---
Thats just how shitters play. It's not how *that* faction plays.
---
What you are doing is rejecting the objective majority and other concerns in favor of your own experience which is not only inherently biased, it is also further biased because you probably still have a slight faction advantage that isn't heavily noticeable.
---
Haha wow.

Stealth? No. Vanish? Yes.

Same rules apply in Vanish as in Stealth. If you have any Bleeds, Poisons, DoT's, or Faerie Fires on you, you will break stealth.
---
ToC? Whats that
---
Not really - they're just ensuring that there's more competition for the same mob in the future
---
Druid is a good hybrid that can pvp and raid with the same spec
---
I have never ever had a Mage demand payment for Water when grouped and if I did I woyld kick them from thw group.
---
Yeah man. Why can't the players be mature and nice to each other like in dota2 and ow?
---
The issue is Dynasty claiming the kill on the forums. Even if you disagree with Old Men Gaming got kicking, they got the kill.
---
Just a fun little fact. I'm on this guy's servers, and we have 2 HoR on horde side before this and both went to warriors :/ he is the first shaman on our realm with it, which is pretty cool
---
Killing them triggers Rag to pop up. You can keep one or more banished and use that time to let healers Regen and have people bandage/heal.
---
Gotcha! Yea that is pretty broken.
---
That's not so lucky for Horde playing on Alliance heavy servers. I got 7 corpse run as a horde going to UBRS on Zandalar Tribe two days ago, and some people took like 5 more to come in while we had the same start. Definitely not as bad as in this video, but still quite rough, although I must say PvP control jumps from one faction to the next around BRM quite often. Fly paths are camped. Sometimes even cities are camped, like Everlook where Alliance PvP groups simply kill all guards to be able to farm players inside.
---
Like, this is not funny for anybody who plays on a realm with more than a 55/45 active 60s faction unbalance. And now I'll have to wait long for queues too because thy're crossrealm ? Come on ... The other good thing about no crossrealm is that you recognize the names of the guys on the other faction. If you were camped by a bunch of dickheads, nothing better than demolishing them in BGs afterwards. But no, instead we'll have crossrealm ...

I would have loved to play on a PvP server but I started player 2 weeks ago and trying to level now would be awful
---
It's that a lot of our fellow allies arent pvpers and also that it's definitely not 50/50, that shit was regurgitated so much, maybe 2 months ago but once word got out it appears a shit ton of horde rolled here looking for pvp since their servers were super light on rare spawns(ally). Either that or server xfers fucked us and a lot of allies deserted us. All this anecdotal obviously I believe one of these gotta be right.
---
lmao

This was our first sight of BRE but our second Perdition's blade in 5-6 weeks of clearing?

Portal is 18s. Lesser Invis on my server is 30-40s.
---
Light bless you, carry on, Tiny Hawk
---
Because they arent rushing it. They're barely. Bgs will be released a whopping 2 weeks before they were in Vanilla and BWL is on schedule to come out at a similar time to when it did in Vanilla.
---
I was told that having them banished and the un-banished ones dead causes Rag to pop back out. Is that not true? That's what we've been operating on.
---
You can start farming pre raid BIS in late 40s.
---
those many people are maybe 5% of the population and their playtime will NEVER be satisfied by any game
---
Thank you for offering the 80th identical take

What's wrong with ret pallys? (I genuinely don't know, am curious)

That's not so lucky for Horde playing on Alliance heavy servers. I got 7 corpse run as a horde going to UBRS on Zandalar Tribe two days ago, while we literally rushed in with the whole group, and some guys took like 10 more to come in while. Definitely not as bad as in this video, but still quite rough, although I must say PvP control jumps from one faction to the next around BRM quite often. Fly paths are camped. Sometimes even cities are camped, like Everlook where Alliance PvP groups simply kill all guards to be able to farm players inside.

Make an Alt. Find an Online Guildy. Invite your Guildy, log out. Log into your alt, get invited by your guildy. Have your guildy promote your Alt to Leader. Kick your Guildy, he's done his job.

---
It depends on the server, I played horde from vanilla to wotlk and we lost the majority of BGs, then I rolled alliance at some point during wotlk and then the alliance lost the majority of bgs. I think it comes down to what battlegroup you were placed in and how serious your faction is on that battlegroup.
---
I have berserker stance and intercept binded to the same key. Also with deadly boss mods you can just change stance early
---
I've done over a 100 Strat UD runs, here are some stats:
---
I've seen Robes of the Exalted two times with a drop rate of 14.13%.
---
I've seen Cape of the Black Baron once with a drop rate of 13.68%.
---
I've seen Skullforge Reaver zero times with a drop rate of 8.05%. 
---
I should have seen all those items 10+ times. You do understand that drop rates aren't a guarantee after a certain amount of runs, right?
---
Highest applies so totem resist applies, it's only the resist portion though so keep marking!
---
As a mage, personally I shit myself when I realize the shammy im fighting is elemental.
---
As an officer of Old Men Gaming, let me clarify our position. We started the fight with a guild raid of 15 and cycled ppl in and out as our guild chat was going off asking for invites. Trying to secure a world boss is absolutely chaotic and we wanted the kill at all costs. 
---
That being said, our contention is not about the loot. If we fucked it because of our actions that’s fine. The drama is because Dynasty claimed the kill on the forums which is counter to what our video shows. 
---
Even if you disagree with our actions, Old Men Gaming got the kill and lost the Mak’gora afterwards.
---
Most of the raid in mostly pre-BiS is plenty, it doesn't take that much DPS. Just a hair over 200/person if you have 10 healers that don't so much as wand, 180 with 8 healers. I just looked back and my guild's first clear was 2:21 in mostly blues, some greens, and the purples that dropped earlier that run.  
---
Tanks need a ton of FR gear, everyone else should pop one GFR Pot before the fight and another whenever the first gets burned through. Spread ranged out rather than two clumps, fireballs should never hit more than 4 people, usually 2–3.  RDPS should go all-out from the start because they can't pull aggro as long as there's someone alive in melee range.
---
I think we'll adopt that Phase 2 strategy, we're farming up some mats for GFP's this week so hopefully we can get most of the raid 2x at least. Does banish not count as killing them for rag popping back up? We've been operating under that assumption this whole time.
---
I had to do it once. My UH DK was named ispreadstds. For almost a year people lol'd, until someone had a stick far up their ass and reported it. In spirit, my DK will forever be named ispreadstds.
---
Jailbreak runs are minimal bosses with mostly EXP. They're geared for Attunement. Arena/Anger runs are for HoJ and you're a little low but should get something. Maybe a Coffer Run where you clear enough to make the Shadowforge key as well.
---
Not sure if you played warlock as well but what is your spell rotation in dungeons?
---
I drain tanked with succubus to this level so I'm guessing I'd be using different spells in dungeons.
---
Apparently I’m bad at remembering prices
---
The shaman was dumb to fall for it. There's no reason for a mage to use a portal by themselves, except if they wanted to pretend they left.
---
Average horde player
---
kil
---
The problem it seems is your pugging people. How can loot come around when the pug never returns.
---
must be easy on horde
---
Interesting so they just eat the wrath and the subsequent fire damage? What if we have like 8 or so melee?
---
Should be able to do arena/angerforge/golemlord qnd jailbreak runs
---
Nope, almost every guild will keep Atleast one banished while they are getting their first kills.  He only emerges when all the adds are dead or the submerge time is expired. Banish doesn’t count as dead.
---
Just make sure the lock rebanishes quickly during the last 20%. You don’t want it breaking banish and murdering your healers.
---
AFAIK the moment you have killed a boss in a raid you are locked until the next rotation.
---
Im doing great things with my OEB while I farm mats for my Sulfuras. Only two items ive gotten in MC yet since release. Warrior has it hard. +8 swords is stupid good as it lowers hit cap and glancing blow reduction. Its also fairly easy to get. Fighting 20 others for those few one handers is horrible. Without windfury though you are gonna cry. Its just so vital.
---
Congratulations!

#ForTheAlliance

No, it wouldn't.  Not even close.  There are x players, on x servers, and this is their faction.  They could probably show that in real time.
---
You were just sitting in a circle with all the characters akwardly. I didn't realize it was 1 account a first.
---
Which leads me to ask, why did you even ask this question? It is as silly as a healer charging to rez or a Paladin wanting a tip for handing out blessings.
---
I was in the same situation, currently lvl 38. I am playing wow for the first time too, as a druid on an alliance. I got so bored at lvl 35 i stopped playing for a week. I felt like i had no quests for my level. Did some SM runs for xp, and now im back to having fun, once i found quests to do. From personal experience i think you should take a break, come back, clench your teeth and pull through for a few lvls. Youll start having fun again, i hope, cause the game is one of the best mmorpgs.
---
Immune.
---
&gt; none of us have hit 60 yet 
---
Oh yikes.  Time to put the dream of running your own raid guild to bed, I'm afraid...
---
I think BGs will be great for the alliance, while heavily under populated on my server the alliance seem to be very much into the pvp aspect of the game. So I think we could put up a good fight when the horde is forced to play with the same amount of people as we are.

Dude are fucking high! Horde on Blaumeux camp BRM with fifty plus people 24/7?! GTFO

And the horde still won...

It does like 1k dmg, just make sure your MT doesn't have one of the 3 lowest GUIDS and they need to taunt immediately after WoR.
---
Excellent thank you!
---
Stand farther away then what you think the range on coc is, with batching kiting is really wonky especially when you are herding 15 zombies .
---
New characters are irrelevant at this point. 90% of the active playerbase for Classic's life will already have a level 45 (and more than likely a 60) by this point.    
---
Faction specific queues could encourage people transfer (and bg queues themselves will be a 'soft' version of this), but it can't solve the issue because overall horde heavily outnumber alliance across the entire game. You can't make the issue a little less worse on the worst realms, but it will always be a problem.    
---
The only fix now, for Classic's later phases, for TBC levelling, for TBC wPvP, is to have faction specific queues in conjunction with faction transfers. Yes, that means Sham/Paly get a class change. Deep breaths, it's ok.
---
Because grinding random mobs for crafting or leveling is no different than running islands on retail.

Interesting, I think most of us are geared up, but I'll check the dps meter next run.
---
I don't necessarily agree. I know a decent number of Warrior DPS who have some halfway decent Tanking gear and do it because it's quicker to get a group together. Tank in DPS Spec, roll on DPS gear. Healing is tougher because a priest rolling on DPS Gear gets shit on hard, and DPS rolling for "Offspec Healing Gear." seems more socially acceptable from what I have seen.

Same man, my older brother, when I was 8 and he was 16 he showed me laid to rest
---
Damn you are THIRSTY for something to whine about
---
Really? They're all over these boards.
---
Yeah but you just reminded me to listen to Jonathan Coulton's "2600" so it's all good.
---
Maybe they're all rp players? To them it is personal data.
---
No problem! Best of luck on Rag!
---
No, it doesn’t. You have no idea what you’re talking about. 
---
The wow api does not give the player access to exact locations for others. It only will tell you where you are, and if they’re in range for your spells. It’s the big reason there are no addons which tell you exactly how many yards away your target is. That would be really useful for kiting range classes, but it’s not possible. 
---
You seem to feel fully confident in complaining about something you don’t even understand. How about you put in the tease arch to understand something before taking staunch positions on it and complaining about it?
---
Spy absolutely does not report the location of enemies. That’s not even possible. It reports the last location your character was at when they were detected.
---
Yeah, I found the twitch client to be very finicky with spelling. 
---
I was also looking for SCT (scrolling combat text) since I used that in vanilla but couldnt find that in the client as well. I wonder if that's still a thing.
---
THAT'S A FUCKING 50 DKP MINUS!!!
---
Do you have logs up on warcraftlogs?
---
d
---
This ^ I totally feel you bro.
---
Blizzard aren't providing the Classic experience is the problem. Classic did not have this many players crammed into one server.
---
You the one talking about not being condescending? Lol. Get *your* head out of your ass you fucken meme.
---
It did in Vanilla
---
Sorry upfront for pic over screenshot. Couldn't make it work in my MacBook.
---
Depends on what you're playing.
---
People like Grubby stream for a living and his stream goes from \~8:30pm to about 2am. 
---
That's 5 1/2 hours of playing and talking to his audience and he makes good money. 
---
Not everybody needs to play 10 hours a day. Not even Asmongold needs to do that.
---
&gt; roll + 1
---
How does that work?  Not familiar with it.
---
Did you just watch old episodes of jersey shore? You realize that nobody worth a damn uses thirsty this way right?
---
Happens with everything people try and merch or stock up for later. If it's a popular idea that the price will rise then it's the hype that drives up the price not the demand.
---
He's lying. The servers that aren't fully Horde dominated barely exist. If he's getting it bad, it's because someone was being camped and their guild came to help out.
---
That’s the problem. Should never see phase 2 of the fight.
---
Almost always lags a bit when switching zone on the border of badlands/searing gorge. Same with durotar/OG and dun morogh/IF in my experience
---
&gt;Sure, there was PvP and ganking, but nothing you couldn't live with. After all, it was me who started playing ona PvP server and for a good reason.
---
I have 60's on two of the biggest EU pvp servers and let me tell you my experience. 
---
- Log on in IF, Spy(*addon that everyone uses nowadays that lists enemy players in range*) detects multiple rogues, skeletons everywhere.
---
- Fly to TP or Morgans vigil to do an instance. Death to 10 enemy players on landing, skeletons everywhere, Flight master dead. Spend next 30 mins corpse running to instance, trying to hide, being hunted like an animal by multiple groups of enemies.
---
- Today I went to do the UBRS key quest in Dustwallow. 30 enemy players occupying boat. 3 rogues camping in the bay west of Menethil. Ganked by two parties inside the cave meanwhile we're fighting the quest elite.
---
My guess is that the current state of the game is mainly because of two factors:
---
1. Server population cap. 10k pop servers play a lot different than 3k pop server.
---
2. Faction imbalance. Over the 15 years of WoW, Horde has become the faction of choice for "pvp'ers" and overall the most popular faction. It's only natural that you would go Horde in classic if you played Horde in retail.
---
These two factors combined is what creates the current situation on the most populated servers. A 60/40 server with 3k people, gives the underdogs a chance, some room to move, workarounds. 
---
1800 vs 1200 just is not comparable to 6000 vs 4000. There is no room to do anything without getting farmed.
---
I will stick it out, level an alt on a smaller server when I get too tired of corpse running, and hope things become more reasonable. Or just wait for paid character transfers to realm of choice.
---
We don't have the technology
---
My buddies and I tried rolling into LBRS, two of us didn't have the flight path, so we were on horse.  The one friend flew in and got ganked immediately upon landing, and it took him a full hour plus to get out of there (He's only level 48, being killed by level 60's).  
---
We ended up going to Mauradon, but we did kill a few horde around the world.  I hearthed out of the Searing Gorge to Iron Forge, and there were hundreds of Alliance just standing around.  I don't get it, go kill shit instead of just standing in IF doing nothing.  You're not wrong when you say that our fellows aren't PvP'ers, but why join a PVP server then?  The only good Horde is a dead horde!
---
It's also crazy how many people who aren't level 60 are afraid to attack a level 60 horde.  If you outnumber them, you kill them easily, but they Alliance runs away scared.  We need more backbones!
---
Yeah, the loot discussion/arguments should be had before the loot even drops in the first place. If everyone is huddled over a boss corpse for 15 mins while people scream at each other, then that is just a mismanaged LC. Its bad for player morale, you waste flask/food/ony buff, and youre just asking for ragequits in the middle of the raid.
---
I got it in 1 weekend on pserver, spamming premades in av weekend, like 8 hrs friday and saturday and i was exalted, by far the easiest rep grind
---
This. But either was still funny to see it work
---
Microsoft launched XP with minor version 2600... Everyone who knew about oldschool phreaking thought they were being posers.

this is the most tilted post I've ever read.  Congratulations!
---
If you work full time, 40 hours a week, then you still have 128 hours each week to do other things.  If you get a full 8 hours of rest every night (wouldn't that be nice?) you still have 72 hours a week.
---
A full-time job doesn't hinder your time as much as you are suggesting.  Losing 40 hours a week compared to unemployed people sucks, but if you spend your game time wisely, planning ahead and working hard in game, you can certainly be on equal footing in a top guild on a server.  Maybe you wont be in APES or METHOD or whatever, but not every server has a guild that hardcore.
---
Also consider that there are other methods to making gold passively, which will allow you to just purchase raid consumes.  In addition, some weeks you may have more time and you begin to stockpile consumes for later use.
---
So I guess, you tell us!  How much time do you spend on raid consumes per week?
---
H to A ratio would still be the same and the same people would still whine
---
I don't like this.
---
UPDATE!!  Blizzard changes the distance combat log is perceived.

The master looter needs to be chosen before the boss is pulled.

The 3rd option is how most of us are doing it these days.

More like 80-man Siegs at this point.

I mean it's hardly 5%. My guild is pretty casual and we have 2 raid groups with MC on farm. It's just a little awkward situation cus the only substantial raid content atm is ridiculously easy.

2v1 is fine according to you. so how about 3v1? 4v1? where do u draw the line?

again give me the magic number

So can you do this for any dungeon to have it kick you back to the start? What if your doing say princess runs with a group. Is there an easy way to reset it so it spits everyone right outside the dungeon?
---
I don't know, I thought dps was doing fine as Rag clears I did with two other guilds (back when I was a PuG) we got to phase 2 with like 40% health left. So I figured phase 2 was kind of expected. I'll check.

Quality video.
---
Your UI makes me want to kill myself though lol
---
On my server you will die at least 8 times getting to a DM entrance, it's horde territory almost around the clock :p
---
Two possibilities.  
---
One - be part of the raid that killed at least one boss in the instance.  
---
Second - enter the raid that already killed at least one boss. You would be "locked" into that raid instance.  
---
For second option all you need is to enter the raid intanse while in the party with any person who is already locked.
---
Mage overall is a pretty good choice for a gatherer/moneymaker. You have a ton of cc at your disposal, and a very good aoe kit. This makes solo farming instances quite viable, and you have good survivability in the open world via cc and evasive maneuvering. 
---
Hunters have a slightly different approach to dungeon farming in that they can reset aggro with feign death. This allows them to skip a lot of obstacles (mob packs) and get to bosses quickly, which they can then solo (if overleveled or overgeared enough) with their OP tank pet, and loot guaranteed vendor gold (you can choose bosses that specifically drop valuable items). 
---
Both are good choices for solo farming. Mages also have a slight edge in group-finding because of their stellar aoe damage.
---
PvP oN a pVp sErVeR??
---
Oh very nice! Thank you for the help my friend.
---
No I get that but I guess I am just not sure how to actually weight the stats to kind of get what I want.
---
the disagreement was "who got the horde server first" not "who is morally correct"
---
Lol Racials dont matter shit when you are vastly outnumbered. They only come at play in a battleground that is otherwise an even setup skill and gearwise.
---
world bosses are pretty sick so far. if they spawn at 14 they are barely playable but its some good raid fights  late in the end.
---
Let’s be honest, you’re not going outside anytime soon.
---
   That's not true though. People interested in PvP do not go to Horde because of racials or Questing. In fact Horde always had more active PvPers than Alliance, no matter the expansion. It seems that the name, the RP, the races are all more attractive to players who want to do PvP, same as Alliance are more involved in PvE (not necessarily better though). Even if you took Vanilla racials away, Horde would still be a majority on PvP servers, and Alliance on PvE servers.
---
&gt; Why do you think most MDI teams were 90% blood elves?  
---
   It's very easy to level and gear a character from scratch or simply race swap it for Min-Maxing purpose nowadays, it wasn't in Vanilla. According to your logic most PvP oriented rogues/warlocks on the Horde should be Orcs for the racials - yet they're in vast majority Undead. Similarily most PvP oriented Warriors on Alliance should be Gnomes - yet they're humans. Min maxing racials is a thing for Reddit, few people do that in reality because they prefer aesthethics/RP/starting zones. Retail is an other world tbh.
---
   I remember when in Cataclysm the Human racial was so incredibly OP in Arena people kept talking on forums that it's unfair, that they will Race/Faction swap to get it (and many did) etc. Yet at the end of the day, Humans were rather under-represented in top ranking teams, and the min-maxers were lagging behing. Hydra videos from Cata are a testimony to that.
---
Nice! This changes nothing. Long live Spy!👌

Searing gorge for questing. Laughs in pvp server

I know some mobs can stack multiple instances of the same disease on you. The oozes in felwood for one comes to mind.

I'm just here for the comments complaining that spy just takes combat log info and this is against nochanges.

I don't necessarily mind the competitiveness, but I hate how many different mentalities were shoved under one roof by Blizzard. We've got World PVP because it's "difficult" that has translated into nothing but massive deathballs. Your ability to form a group of 40 is *far* more important than your ability to play your class. And it's a *huge* XP tax on anyone who didn't finish leveling. It's a really poor system in general - one that punishes people for things that aren't mistakes. Even people interested in PVP are complaining about how quickly they get ganked. They're blaming server size - the reality is that this is just how the system works. There are some people who are playing specifically to fight unfair battles and screw over other people. Others want a balanced, competitive experience. Others just want PVE. And Blizzard just threw all the different components haphazardly and ended up with the worst aspects of all of the different styles. With the release of Classic, they had the opportunity to implement everything right off the bat so that people weren't suddenly overwhelmed with the introduction of world PVP and so that half the PVPers could stick to arena/battlegrounds. Instead they released everything staggered, but at an increased rate, which punishes all but the most jobless players for not staying on top of things. It's an absolute trainwreck.
---
Looks like a UI bug.
---
Haven’t played on Grobb yet. How’s the pvp balance on that server? Thinking of retooling to there from Deviate Delight.
---
My server and reddit reflect the reality that is all wow relms!
---
Generally avoid them if you can. It can be tricky until you get Ice Barrier.
---
I'll tell our MT, is the advantage that it just keeps the melee DPS going during the fight? I've noticed on my meter that by the end of the fight (I use damage done, I'll swap to dps) it's all of our ranged dps at the top. Keeping melee in will likely expand their contribution.
---
I actually forgot to talk to the spirit before returning to the Barrens and had to make an extra trip to Silverpine. Not. fun.

Ok. Thanks.
---
I’m don’t follow this sub very closely, but I imagine most people who don’t have anything to do just don’t like the game. There is always stuff to do especially now that the honor system released.
---
Hunters- how often are you using your pet in MC
---
Tanaris have quests in ZF and ST, so no point in skipping it.
---
Thanks for the heads-up. See you on the field =)
---
I’m explaining *why* Alliance are outnumbered on most PvP servers, not the effect of the Horde racials once the factions are unbalanced.
---
Ashbringer feels pretty good.
---
Omg was thinking the same hahaha!
---
Census is anything but to be taken seriously
---
You can’t beat a mage for farming. I had 400 gold at level 56 just from cone of cold farming ZF graveyard. You get a ton of do doing that also. You can’t beat a mage when it comes to gold farming.
---
None of them will be perfect. I know my guild isn't on there.
---
&gt; There's a reason STV has the reputation that it does.
---
And it has been glorious leveling there. Just get a group of 2 - 3 mates and its a blast
---
That GM lied. They basically never give out loot rewards. They're definitely not doing it for a world boss.
---
Wholeheartedly agree
---
Yes killing Rag pre submerge is significantly easier than after, this should get you guys there. But if you guys are only getting to 25% with a full 40 you have some problems that need to be addressed at some point.
---
I'm emphasizing the artificial queues that OP mentioned (which I don't agree with at all) while proposing two different caps for each faction instead of a server-wide cap of maximum players.
---
Or just master loot it to yourself immediately. Take rez sickness and distribute loot in Stormwind.
---
doesnt change anything xD
---
No, the GMs are busy going after the worst hackers, like people who stand on rooftops
---
Unless they run out of teleport runes ofc
---
OwO
---
 QQ more you carebear. Why do you get to dictate which way I play the game? If it's available in the game, then it's a proper mechanic.
---
Where can I find the ToS for WoW Classic? There is a rumor going around that "win trading" or "contacting cross faction players" to do Duels is bannable because it could be interpreted as Honor Farming. But no one is providing a Quote or Link to the source, its just heresay. Is there a definitive Post from Blizzard about meeting with Cross Faction ppl to Duel or Honor Trade?
---
They always listen, it's too bad people have to post such hateful things without giving Blizzard time to adjust things.
---
No. I think I was pretty clear.
---
&gt;This is bad for the community.

If he throws the shadowpriest under the buss for her, he will do so with others also.

You and the rest of the guild should not stay with him, heck you should have defended the shadowpriest as well if you had any balls.

officers/gm's flirting with a female healer used to be a very common red flag back in the day for guilds, it's practically  a trope/cliché.

Molten Core raid - How important is fire resist for a Mage? So the question is - does extra 50 fire resist make any difference? Because I have only around 3k health in my gear. Main problems are in the Ragnaros fight. I use greater fire protection potions along with fire ward. Should I add some fire resisit or it won't really make a difference?
---
An average of two hours a day isn't really that much in an MMO.

And their bows and crossbows :-)

Joking aside, all the dialogue in that place was annoying after the first week.
---
On Fairbanks this would just get you reported to the local death ball doing laps and plucking lowbies like flowers. The small scale PvP hasn't happened since last week unless it's a single 60 ganking a low level player, which is more like RPing a mining node than PvP to the lowbie.

Does +hit% or weapon skill matter at all vs equal or lower level mobs? It seems like the only data I ever see reflects a fight vs a lvl 63 elite

Yes I agree, I guess I just dislike their pvp playstyle.

Congratulations! That’s a huge achievement at any point in your gaming career.
---
Same on Heartseeker, but in Orgrimmar. Can't go anywhere without getting mobbed down by a raid or rogues that are littered across the city.
---
The ratio is not the problem. The issue is the number of people actively ganking is just too damn high. Imagine if your Horde-filled server had 1/5 the number of players it has. It would still suck, but it would such much less.

Where are you getting 1000 subs? I feel like a year from now nobody will know who this guy is.

Humans are biased. And so is the loot council. It only leads to fake interactions in the guild by forcing people to be on good terms with the officers.

It’s enough that I have to fake like my boss in real life. Not sure why anyone would do that for some pixels in game.

yeah because no way that worked like that back in the day, i was spotting people in spy before they where even in render distance, and i play with everything on high/ultra
---
Grats on the ring tho that shit is awesome.
---
If you’re level 60 you only get honor from killing level 48+.
---
Eh its pretty easy to collude with silent dkp auctions, classes on the same spec work together to minimize dkp usage while others who dont will never be able to afford cross-class stuff like the mageblade. Even more so when the guy who tallies up the dkp bids is your friend and lets you know how much you need to win or when to holdback to help drain the others dkp.
---
How about an enhancement shaman at 60?
---
Still got rolled tho
---
you have 239 more FR then you need
---
do i have to quote u?
---
"A geared 60 complaining 48s don't give him honour after farming them. If that isn't griefing, I don't know what is. "
---
but all good. with that squared away, what's left is just pvp. it is FUN.
---
Way to prove my point there buddy.

EPIC EDIT!! XD
---
Dirty as hell, I love it.
---
Do people really think Alliance are the only ones getting ganked?
---
Please tell me more of the exploit? 🤔
---
I mean... being the bad guy is kinda the entire fantasy of the class
---
I know it sounds ridicules but the command said command+shift+3 and It overlaped with the game and didnt work, as i had to hover over the eye.
---
&gt; It'd be better to base it off something more like time for the median raider to clear, but I very much doubt those numbers are known, especially for vanilla.
---
I agree with this.
---
I think the important thing to recognize though is that there are always going to be people that feel rushed, and there are always going to be people that are bored and waiting for content. 
---
As long as you don't cater to either group and you land somewhere in the middle you're doing fine. 21 weeks I too fast. 7 months is too long. I think 5-6 months(so feb-march) is about right. 
---
All of the other content thus far has just felt so rushed. We're not even 3 months in and about to be on phase 2.5.
---
Wtf, how are people leveling this fast? It takes me 4-6 hours to get a level and I'm only 50
---
You're forgetting the third type of player, the player that rolls on a PVP server then complains about there being PVP

Tip for those, usually they do frost damage and you can use frost ward and dampen magic to reduce damage and pushback from their attacks.

This is entirely reasonable

Sulfuras Represent! I find Searing Gorge is 100x better because the second you hit the BRM Steps in Burning Steppes, you will go to the graveyard in Searing Gorge. That means all the way across SG, through BRM and around the giant room, and out the other side to your body.

Back in Vanilla there were hunters doing the exact same thing. You can even find videos on youtube of hunters doing this back in Vanilla.

stop trying to bait ppl and go outside and play in the park

You know, the same thing happened in the last game I played. I played a game called Aion which was a PvP focused faction vs faction game. When the game launched there was a population disparity of one faction over the other because of the cosmetic differences between the two.  One faction, the "Elyos", looked like angels while the other faction, the "Asmodians", looked like dark angels with tails and claws. Every server was population imbalanced in the Elyos favor which sucked so much because endgame progression was dictated by your faction being able to control three fortresses in a massive siege based combat system meaning, essentially, that the opposing faction could control your ability to progress and obtain gear. What happened was that Elyos controlled the forts, got all the gear which made it easier for them to keep the forts and the other faction basically just languished. 
---
NCSoft, the developer of Aion, opened up server transfers, and every Asmodian, myself included, eventually transfered to one server called "Vaizel."  All the other servers, up to then, were about 66/33 Elyos/Asmo split, so 2:1, but Vaizel was something like 95/5 Asmodian to Elyos. Massive Elyos guilds transferred onto the server and were utterly demoralized by the sheer volume of players. At one point I recall there being a PvP battle that was some 1800 Asmos vs 180 Elyos and in Aion when you die in PvP you lose your faction rank (think about HK's leeching Honor from the victim so the more you die the more honor you lose and you can derank quite quickly that way). 
---
I was disgusted with it but I needed to be a part of it to actually gear myself out so I could go back to my original server with gear and actually put up a fight.
---
Anyways, long story with no point, just I have seen that before where every server sways one way and then xfers open up and one server becomes masssssivly unbalanced.
---
It's okay though horde on Heartseeker, eventually all the alliance will quit on all the other Horde dominated servers and they will close Heartseeker and merge it with Skeram and there will be one balanced server for great PvP. That is what happened in Aion and it helped alot.
---
We just use gnomes for baiting horde, works every time
---
Sadly it’s all some of these people have to live for
---
Finally people dont run around with wall hacks anymore
---
Part of the game mate
---
How in gods name is this an exploit???? People have been doing this since the beginning of wow, it’s no different than a lvl 20 paying for a deadmines run....
---
My gear is pretty bad, but I'm guess my opponents have bad gear too. I'm just in the usual level 39 quest greens. The Fel Hunter interrupt has allowed me to interrupt a cast, but Mages often ice block it and then proceed with shatter combo me 100-0% during the 5 seconds of WOTF.
---
this was more then likely the combat log fix.
---
Had someone literally get 2 pieces of loot and ragequit when he wasnt allowed to roll on rag loot.
---
what was up with the combat log?
---
God you make a lot of assumptions mate. You dont understand how different a lot of servers are. You are literally doing what you are accusing me of.
---
Still doesn't answer the question
---
very on point.
---
and happy cake day!
---
I think that's what I'm currently leveling as, although I dont yet have Dark Pact since I'm not 40 yet. But is that spec good for world pvp?
---
That's why they released Dire Maul early. Everybody is "done" it so there is minimal PVP there. Wide open run into East, West, or North for all your dungeon needs!
---
Yes absolutely. My guild has 2 raid teams and both defeated Rag in the 2nd week. Neither team attempted Rag more than 3 times before getting a kill and quite honestly should have killed it week 1 (I take the blame for that as I made tanking mistakes). I didn't record logs from those early weeks but our 3rd kill took only 2:20. The other teams first 2 kills took 2:44 and 2:51 (this one with 38 people).
---
We've reached "alt and raid logging" phase of WoW imo.
---
Most of my guild I don't see all week, then 40-60 are on for raid times. With only 10-20 ever logging during the week, and probably a bunch more on alts they havent added to the guild.
---
I think thats probably the same for most. I see a LOT more "lfg deadmines" and SM, ST, Mauradon than I did before.
---
Suck a dick
---
Once the final boss is killed the entire dungeon become friendly, minus 2 packs. The person who kills the final boss becomes the king of the ogres.
---
Any thoughts as to why I'm getting no HK or honor for killing alliance? They are not near flight paths or instances so should not be honorless? I'm rank 4 if that makes any difference..
---
Yeah dude it’s nuts. I’m friend w ally rogue who was first on their side and he had 35k. PvE servers make the grind a bit easier
---
FOR THE HORDE! one more Hand of Rag for Kuri Horde
---
Oh thats my fuck up then, people told me it was per group.
---
You're on kurinaxx right? For the horde!
---
i haven't really played classic and don't remember spy existing in vanilla - can someone explain it a bit more in depth. the gist i get is it reads the combat log of enemy players fighting, so when you're moving forward, new logs will populate as someone enters your radius, so you can kinda figure out when people are in front of you? why are rogues complaining so much?
---
I can tell you it’s at least 8500+ and was increased later.  I was 8700 in queue and a mass server  kick/crash happened booting everyone off.  I got in instantly.  As well as more behind me I’m sure.
---
if it was lower I would have just seen my spot in line go down by the max
---
Finally a fucking mok'gora that didn't end in cheating.
---
Well they just did for ony and rag, enjoy not having working threat meters.
---
Hi, /u/lacii7
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dzs899/it_still_works_d/). 
---
Can u people not read? The people going into the run after it's completed do not have the king buff, and are therefore hostile to the ogres. They should not be able to walk past the mobs.
---
It's gonna be weird replacing that with nightfall
---
so basically details and threat meters will be 50 yards fixed then....well as i said before its a good thing for pve distance does not mean much at all,otherwise this would have been a stupid nerf to PVErs cause rogues cant gank.
---
What is song?
---
Does anyone not have Sulfuras now?
---
What do you mean? At 60 you can finally play the game.
---
It was 2:1. Lol.
---
That all what I can do, full time job, a house and 3 kids. I dont have the same amount of time i used to.
---
Mucho gracias
---
amazing that you were able to realize that pvp was not something you enjoyed and thus decided to play on a pve server
---
something that never seemed to occur to the vast majority of whiners on pvp servers
---
Ok, I wasn't keeping good track of the tank last time to see how many times he got knocked back, I seem to remember like 2-3 times. I remember the healers getting blasted a few times though because we had 3 of them stacked on each other.
---
Unless you are in a hardcore raiding guild, you can easily get raids in each weekend. My server has tons of MC's that start on Fridays and Saturdays. With phase 2 released, world pvp is tons of fun, and they also released world bosses. So there are a couple things. You can start working towards your epic mount if you haven't, or start grinding rep with certain factions that offer you items you need. You could start a new character...let's see...work on your professions and on December 10th, battlegrounds come out! Also, have you put together a solid BIS set for your first venture into Ony or MC? I would suggest doing that if you havent
---
The addon shouldnt even exist in general.
---
It's streamlined "game sense" and gives people information and an easy way to use that information that they wouldn't naturally have the awareness and skill to do on their own.
---
Was not a Tuesday night. And it was the first and probably only time any of us got to enjoy the buff. Even if it was a Tuesday nobody has any special privileges on turning in quests. No guild has the right to think they have any priority over others. No need for them to be petty and rude to others who are just trying to enjoy the game.
---
50 yards is too small. Need at least 100 yards for people who run away from spells like frostbolts and also pve.
---
Its 60/40 horde on the server. When an alliance group gets going, they can't match us pound for pound. We've had plenty of pvp groups win loop sided affairs. Grats to the horde for trying
---
Depends entirely on your realm and the amount of competition you're experiencing. Since battlegrounds are coming in about 2 weeks I'd say the likelihood of getting rank 13 with your time restraints is fairly low.
---
Yeah, this guy totally had like 7 things he could have done to outplay that skirmish. I know cause I do this stuff all the time.
---
That's wild you think greater than 2 horde to every 1 alliance is even close to a fair fight. The horde got absolutely shit on here lmao.
---
But what happened to #NoChanges? Hmmm!
---
Hopefully that does not apply in dungeons
---
yeah
---
There's been some DKP collusion in my guild. Tier pieces have been going for minimum bid... which is totally fine. People don't want to bleed their buddies out of DKP. If everyone bids minimum, it goes to a /roll among those who bid, winner takes piece. Simple. So a mage piece drops Tuesday, and every single mage bids the minimum of 50.
---
Except one, who bids 53.
---
Mages go fucking bananas, one leaves the raid group, Discord was lit up for two days, and I'm really looking forward to some lingering salt on Onyxia tonight.
---
Back in the day Horde whined so hard that Blizz gave them elite lvl 55 guards with sniper rifles.
---
Looool at all the players waiting to gank at the flight paths and getting jipped out of their honour
---
Forgive me if I have no sympathy at all
---
They are max level, if i did the majority of damage to him others who only tagged them would get honor yet i would not.
---
Ofc it does, log out in city and you're good.
---
there is no game sense vs a rogue,the second your stun locked your dead...in vanilla rogues were the grim repeater,once stunned you had no way out
---
And all the 1h epics. And all the weapons in BWL. If i got eye on my warrior i don't even think id craft it.
---
The last three levels for my Priest were actually really quick! If you get in a Stratholme, Scholomance or Lower Blackrock Spire you get a ton of XP.
---
It wouldn' be worth making a 19 rogue without the shadowfang keep weapons, the next drop below is ass. Priests are pretty easy to gear 19, blackstone sceptre, crescent staff both from quests. Other than that just buy the highest stam cloth gear you can afford and get them enchanted.
---
&gt; As long as you play the cool kids faction, then you won’t be disappointed.
---
One mob for every warlock. The buff does wonders for tanks/healers.
---
&gt;they had 3 times as much honor as me despite having half my kills as a solo only player.
---
FWIW this just means you don't actually understand how to farm honor. They're receiving half the honor per kill that you should be.
---
Uh, this is coming from a horde player.. starting Week 2 they were wiping the living hell out of us on popular raid nights (Tues/Wed/Sun).
---
What we perceive as a huge time investment is more common playtimes nowadays than in 05-06, meaning that you're competing with more people for that rank 13-14. Not telling you to do or not do it, just warning you about the unpredictability of your competition.
---
I would recommend raid logging, you can even compare your guilds Dps logs to other people with comparable item levels. 
---
Gear really is not in the equation here at this point in classic. This is 100% player effort / skill / knowledge. If you would like and you have raid logs pm them to me and I can help you weed out the problem.
---
You shouldn't be able to cancel once someone bids.
---
But who got the best head?
---
It’s like people forgot what the satire behind World of Roguecraft was. It was an amazing video and is now more relevant than ever. It honestly brings me joy to not let rogues into groups because there are literally infinitely more rogues scraping for gear than anything else.
---
Most aren’t good, most aren’t geared, when they are geared... most still get out dps’d by fury warriors and most aren’t even enjoyable people to game with. 
---
Really happy with how strict my guild was with recruiting rogues, it just seems to be the class that attracts some of the most unstable players.
---
Ah makes sense
---
Yes, and despite  The enemies appearing to be hostile, they are in fact not since the new king of the ogres is a player other players are also treated with the same respect. This is the same way you rotate people in a raid for party buffs after the tribute run
---
they reduced render distance cause their servers cant handle it fyi
---
Let me guess, you personally take part in this exploit.
---
post says it won't affect raid parses, whatever that means
---
&gt; he ogres is a player other players are also treated with the same respect.
---
fuck off, that isn't how it works.   They respect only the king
---
That ending made me laugh so hard!
---
Raid parsing uses an external text log the game produces
---
Can anyone give me an overview of the honor system? Like, what constitutes an HK, how honor is tallied, what is required to rank up, etc.?
---
from what people are saying in another threat it indeed does,if your in a raid threat wont be detected until its within 50 yards. granted in pve distance means little,so its not that big of a hit...but its a nerf to pve regardless
---
More than once a week. I'd usually see them on popular raid nights like Tues/Wed/Sun. Sorry, I forgot that people on the internet take most comments literally...
---
It usually doesn't lol, its inconsistent as hell.
---
You can’t just walk by. You have to still sneak in and avoid some things until you get the king buff also
---
Same as draw distance for mobs &amp; other players.  Don't know how far that is in yards, but a lot greater than 50.
---
Kurinaxx?
---
Was it called shattered hand because they fapped so much?
---
QQ, I can't take advantage of people's mistakes because of your lousy Cancel option!
---
Remove it!!!
---
I SAID REMOVE IT, GODDAMN IT!!!!!
---
What in the fuck 50k honour is rank 4? I’m not sure that would get rank 3 on my server.
---
everyone should be stacked within 50yds for Ony on phase 1 and 3
---
Every melee should be stacked for Rag. Range cant pull agro on rag.
---
Idk wtf ur on about tbh, this does nothing for threat control on those fights
---
It doesn't have the ability to recognize soft caps on hit. I would give it the stat weight you want it to have for hit over 6% and even then you're probably going to have to tweak the gear recommendations.
---
It also completely fails to get set bonuses right when auto filling gear.
---
You can do custom weights and I do recommend that but only as a tool for exploring options.
---
It means that warcraftlogs will still work the same; however, all the people whining about Spy just broke details!, recount, and every other threat and dps meter.  Rag and especially Ony are going to be shitshows now.
---
What silly logic, there's more to pvp than 1v1 (especially when bgs roll in) and while classic is nowhere near balanced for pvp, the imbalance does not justify what spy does.  
---
That's like someone saying wallhacking is fine in counterstrike because enemy awpers were too hard for them to deal with.
---
The thing is, when I'm logging in my stealth CD is 10sec even tough I'm sub and it's 5sec otherwise. Really weird
---
Claims the other poster is triggered, proceeds to prove themselves the triggered party.
---
Yeah, assuming you just stand there like a wet blanket....
---
I’m gonna be playing a lot of twinks and many of my guildies are doing enough pvp I’m RR to get their trinkets before BGs are out.
---
It’s not a matter of winning or losing. It’s a matter of farming honor. We had no intention of killing them all. Yet we got close to 1,000 honor each and they got less than 150. So I would say we won
---
Dude, being a lowbie in Hillsbrad is heaven compared to being a level 50-59 on the underrepresented faction in WPL. 
---
Hillsbrad skirmishes only happen when there is interest from both factions who decide to create a makeshift "Battleground" between Southshore and Tarren Mill, because the graveyards are nearby. 
---
In leveling zones, you are literally camped 23 out of 24 hours in the day by the dominant faction (generally horde) by max-geared honor farmers. You can't quest or even get the flight path most of the time. It's literally just a horrible manifestation of server imbalance and overcrowding packaged together with a shitty release schedule for PvP.
---
&gt; I hearthed out of the Searing Gorge to Iron Forge, and there were hundreds of Alliance just standing around. I don't get it, go kill shit instead of just standing in IF doing nothing.
---
Orgrimmar is like this on Fairbanks and we *still* have massive amounts of Horde in the world killing Alliance.
---
I’m a 57 hunter, so I’m so close to that sweet 60! But all the levelling zones are full of 60s haha! Have fun!!
---
Why the fuck would you spread this type of exploit. We're only going to see it more now. Lol Jesus fuck op. If you don't wanna PvP don't PvP.
---
Easier to access some zones, more towns, more flightpaths, more quests, while the Alliance has less flightpaths and towns that make traveling harder and less quests even in zones that should technically be more on the alliance side.
---
Badlands is one of the worsts of the bunch, no alliance town, fewer quests and some other quests scattered around the world that need constant traveling between zones just because they have no flightpath there. Meanwhile the horde gets all that and an easy access point to Searing gorge while the Alliance has to first get around and kill a high level mob to get the key for the tunnel to Searing Gorge. The list goes on.
---
Exactly, it's just classics equivalent to wallhacks.
---
A lot of the time it is being spotted by a stealthie whilst you have pvp on and then eventually being jumped on by him and his stealth pals. Sometimes it devolves in to something bigger but mostly you just suck it up and move on.
---
There are already master sergeants running about this week.
---
It's against tos. Dont cheat.
---
Just go deep into the forest and fight boars till 60.
---
50 yards is tiny, you'll outrange that in ony and rag easy
---
It's going to cause trouble for recount and details on fights that have a spread of players like Ragnaros but warcraftlogs uses the text logs and not the in-game combat log so it's going to be fine.
---
Combat log parsing addons may be able to use some synching functionality to make up for the smaller combat log range.
---
Dude you have time to spam the same reply 14 times but where are people supposed to be reading your explanation of why this should qualify as an exploit? You still haven't given one. Also what about when you bring in a lock, and summon the payer past the mobs to mizzle / the chest? Is summoning a bannable exploit too in your universe?
---
It even specifies that this is Classic DKP.
---
It shouldn’t break it. They said in the blue post 50 yards was the intended range like in vanilla, it just means recount will work like it did in vanilla
---
What's their gain from said "exploit"?
---
yeah,someone also mentioned its the log itself...raid addons are 50 yard fixed now...good thing alot of things in pve dont have rogue stealth,so the distance wont be that big of a factor.
---
&gt; Damage meters will no longer be accurate for party/raid members 
---
who gives a shit
---
You know it
---
Same for Herod, most people are prebis so golds the only reason to login and you can’t do anything in the world rn. I’m logged into mara to fish nightfins but thats it. No reason to play outside of raiding rn, horde make it horrible
---
Pretty much mirrors my guild's experience lol
---
Yep in those 50 runs I only saw the pants twice
---
What other professions do you gice these guys, tailoring for mooncloth cd?
---
You make it sound like the logs are never received by the client after this change,  all they are doing is changing what is displayed to the user by the log and that can be modified to be anything at anytime.
---
It wouldnt be hard to limit the filter to non-party/raid member, non-faction players at 50+ yard.
---
I sit in IF as a horde rogue and distract people down there.
---
Yeah even I was on the OP side for a bit but it definitely looks like hes basically raidlogging while the other guy was making sure to be best equipped for dps in the raid fight which in this case looks like Ragnaros. If the OP was putting out 15% parses while the other guy doing 60%+, who is the raid most worried about losing? 
---
Sure the raid should have made their loot rules more transparent but if the OP wants to leave to another guild that raidlogs like him, hes free to do so. Just dont be surprised that everyone is greens because they do try to grind for preraid bis cant kill rag like his current guild can.
---
You can still wear it
---
Fucking hell lol
---
Winterblades plays WoW? Anyone know if they're the same Winerblades from Shadowbane?
---
yeah rag and ony were pretty much mentioned to be effected 100%.
---
Ive done that plenty saved quite a few lowbies in badlands from the pathing ogres even after honor. But ive also drained an ally paladin of his mana and then curse of recklessness the elite mob he was fighting....
---
Faction imbalance on some servers is just so bad, really didnt want to give up on my character but i stopped playing
---
So its broken then.
---
On rag if you're south side ranged you're more then 50 yards away from north spread ranged.
---
This literally broke recount/details
---
No, that's using game mechanics as intended.  This is not.  Your false analogy is shit.
---
Or its not.
---
They can just filter out opposition faction data at a range of 50 yards.
---
I might have exaggerated it a bit but basically yes, he could only go as far as his corpse allowed him to.
---
Balanced because it needs a reagent to work.
---
best healers in the game in both pve (highest throughput marginally above priests) and PvP when geared properly
---
Wow! That actually makes mage very appealing - being able to farm gold while leveling will be really nice while I wait for groups on my main.
---
If anything this is an improvement, because now Spy will be consistant. You won't have targets show up that you cant click or see. So when the stealth tag pops, you know its actually near you.    
---
This makes Spy better, thank you.
---
Sure, but theres lots of fights where people move more than 50 yards apart, twin emps, huhuran, sapphiron, etc
---
if a rogue sneaks up on you,good luck trying to get away.......after that very first stun you are 100% fucked completely
---
Can you show proof of this? I’ll need to see it to believe it’s not working.
---
15 years for Truestrike Shoulders, I suddenly don't feel so bad.
---
Pretty much everyone except for the council were on the shadow priest's side and were yelling at them through chat but he maybe went a bit overboard shouting at discord so eh... we all have jobs so not really much time to go looking for convenient guilds timewise.
---
Oh goodness, prepare to meet King Magni soon.
---
Your lack of understanding of how logging works is amazing.
---
Weapons: Double deadmines
---
Depends on your guild... find one that raids on the weekends.  Aside from that I am just striving to clear my map of potential quests so that takes a bit of time as you are dealing with multiple instance runs.
---
Oh wow, that seems like a pretty good drop rate. Why do they sell for so much if they aren't too difficult to get?
---
And the cycle of hatred continues
---
&gt; This is closer to the original behavior of WoW 1.12, 
---
seems like #NoChanges to me
---
So this is what the alliance does when they're not counting nelf flips.
---
Because as soon as we or druids stealth the addon will notice and everyone get alerts on the middle of their screen that we just stealthed in the proximity. Completely removes any element of surprise. People defending the addon is pathetic.
---
Just did it on my shaman and I gotta say it wasn't as bad as doing the lvl20 paladin quest for the hammer. Though that quest was just for gear, water totem is an essential part of the shaman class.
---
Looks like its time to roll Horde on Skeram to even things out.
---
I use an addon, so no.
---
Regnerus does not care about ranged threat he only carries if there's somebody close enough for him to whack on. Magmadar would be one that came to my mind and onyxia obviously
---
Honestly just calling it how it is lol, everything I said previously is facts. If you cry about dying on a pvp server, play pve, an alliance dominated pvp server, or play the safe retail version of wow. Not hard.
---
Your lack of understanding the difference between the combat log and out of game text logs is astounding.
---
Alliance succubus quest is a joy too. Walk all around the barrons and hope not to get corpse camped.
---
The buyer doesn’t just walk in. The seller needs to get him to the end, it’s obvious you haven’t seen or done this. A lot of mobs aren’t hostile but you still have to kill eyes and get past multiple pods of hostile mobs. It requires a invis potion for non stealth classes
---
"Wait, you're leaving? Fight me, you coward! Watch, I'll stun you for 6 seconds! And... okay, so I didn't procc anything, but that stun had to make you really angry! Just... damn it."
---
Source: I am that Paladin.
---
What professions are you?
---
Aaaand, we're back to BC, where arenas and pvp crybabies started the chain of nerfs to pve.  Fucking knew it wouldn't last.
---
Does that exist in classic? I havent played since phase 2
---
yes, everything is blizzards fault, i dont blame ppl that left. having fucking 4 NA east coast severs ate reservation was the start of the shitshow
---
Starting fresh in a server is also OK for gearing priest?
---
The game has all the data,  the logs have all the data.
---
Placing a filter on the visible logs will not affect anything.
---
BRE isn't that amazing in current content I hear, because bosses don't have enough armor (normal armor debuffs already reduce them to pretty much zero).
---
Honestly wouldnt mind seeing the warcraftlogs and OPs gear.
---
No BRM guild rival skirmishes on the way to raids... would make me sad. That's one of the greatest parts of raiding right now
---
12 corpse runs to get into DM for me.
---
Their auctions show up first if filtered by bid price
---
Classic at 60 is raiding until you are completely BiS until the next new content arrives.
---
If it wouldn't be hard they would have done it. Clearly they don't want to waste the resources developing that feature and have gone for the easy lazy solution.
---
Dungeongroups below BRD are rare due to lack of ppl twinking. And for higher dungeons, groups mostly want lvl 60 only, because its faster. Thats at least my experience. Sitting at lvl 51 for the next 3 weeks i guess
---
Even if you don't get interrupted, it's not as if missing 2-4 frostbolts is going to leave others doing half the damage you do.
---
And if a mage can't ice block or blink to save themself, thats also a problem
---
I like to gank alliance lowbies because they’re 10x more likely to post salty shit like this
---
Alright so locks can sell tribute loot no problem that doesn't bother you, but hunters should be banned for it because it's not as hard as you think it should be for them to do it.
---
Whatever man I see that this is very important to you, way to pick your battles and focus on the important stuff lol...
---
Raid logging uses an external log file. Recount/details use the combat log.
---
I can’t tell what’s worse; the mages that think like this, the hunters that fall victim to them and post stuff like this, or the fact that I will never have a post with 7k upvotes.
---
I'm primarily tanking, which cloak enchant is better? +3 agility or +70 armor?
---
You have the burden of proof. Provide actual documentation from back in the Vanilla days, or a video from back then, which proves your point. Something more substantive than "no u."
---
 The burden of proof is the obligation on a party in a dispute to provide **sufficient** [**warrant**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(philosophy)) **for their position**. 
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden\_of\_proof\_(philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy))
---
All my friends between level 45-60 have quit the game since p2 came.
---
Boooorrrrinnnnggggg
---
They're using the double stack strat which is a problem since when one gets knocked back half their ranged get knocked back with them
---
You said still got rolled though. That statement can only insinuate you fully believe alliance even stood a change. What is it 15-28 vs 40+ ?  "Still got rolled though" lol
---
I agree, but the same players after 4 MCs can be at the bottom every time
---
Tried to be edgy and failed.  How embarrassing.
---
Lmao PERMA BANNED OVER 1 COMMENT.
---
Can't trade world boss loot
---
NOOOOOOOOO.... no more mind vision + spy .... :(
---
Couldn't you get them to craft the hammer for you, to save one ingot?
---
Nope. Dungeons only
---
This is a good primer on it
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview
---
Whats that got to do with the nerf to spy?
---
don't do the grouping/stacking as suggested earlier, our guild was having trouble on rag until we made sure to utilize all the space /range 10   
---
[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626940307996540928/640072339463340032/unknown.png?width=469&amp;height=469](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626940307996540928/640072339463340032/unknown.png?width=469&amp;height=469)  
---
this is the reference picture we used for our first pre-submerge kill (we didn't to the healers on the very outside bits tho, seemed unnecessary)  
---
raid pre-pots with GFFP 
---
ranged dps should know that they don't have to worry about aggro at all and should just go balls to the walls the second the fight starts, no reason for mage downtime between mana ruby + major mana  
---
with dbm your melee should easily be able to time the in+out dance, and if you have any enh shamans they can't dps on this fight at all (you probably already knew that part) no mana users can be in the melee area or it screws them over (important: if a mana user gets knocked into the melee they need to get the fuck out asap, dont even stop to do a single cast, just start swim+jumping back to the outside)  
---
make sure the raid knows all the ramps out of the lava so they don't waste too much time swimming around
---
By the numbers I see horde won and your raid is dead. Fun ro watch but you didn't win
---
So why does it require an invis potion?
---
And muted for 72 hours so I can't ask for a different mod to view this ridiculousness
