This sounds just as interesting as the fire warrior. Thank you for sharing!

Why would that make them dicks? It's a great about 2 warring factions. If you don't want to initiate wpvp that's fine but everyone plays the game for different reasons and enjoyment.

According to survey data here, there will be a greater ratio of healers in Classic than there was in Vanilla. But the reasons for that are more than simply just GUI restrictions.
---
That said, do note that in Vanilla we had 4:3 displays, in addition to smaller displays. So there was less screen real estate to work with. Plus fancy addons that made everything more compact, as well as a better general understanding on how to lay out an efficient GUI, were generally speaking not a thing back then.
---
You know I was previously against anything over 5k max but you may  have just changed my mind.

Follow this guide, its the best! ;) [Shaman leveling guide - Kargoz](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J8y9iJFT_tMU1bsPUNve7F1sNhW33LA-xe1hx0NAa_0/mobilepresent) 
---
Would love to be in a Guild like that one! My main will be a Hunter and my alt a Druid.
---
In this cruel world? You're very optimistic my friend.
---
Dont say 2 hunters.
---
1. Yes human is better, but it would have to be a pretty hardcore guild to care.   
---
  
---
2. Pally is probably more popular, and there will be more pallies in an optimised raid setup too. Won’t be a huge difference though.
---
In many respects vanilla had more powerful addons than retail does, aka decursive and whatever that addon is that heals for you.
---
One of the saddest Cataclysm changes to me was them bursting the damn and flooding Menethil Harbor... that and Southshore. Cataclysm was depressing for the alliance... Horse areas just became approximately 45% more Metal. 
---
hunter/hunter, hunter/druid, hunter/shaman would all be pretty viable and very fast leveling. I would love another hunter to power level with. 2 explosive traps would make aoe grinding on hunters easy.
---
I hope there is I'd like to find someone to play with
---
I will be playing a duo with a warrior and I’m undecided on my healing class :o
---
They will allow some more addons, but I think they said nothing g that will automate things
---
I.e. no decursive 
---
It's because I bet most of us that are over preparing feel like we're going back in time, and finally have a chance to redo all this sh\*t but by being l33t at it, ahead of the herd, instead of the noobs we were.
---
Sort of reminiscent when you're poor, and wish you had the opportunity to have a time machine and make bank, but now you actually have to chance to do it, and want to read up the entire history of the stock market before you go back.
---
I like the eventual removal of melee from 1.
---

---
Ha, I've watched that! I'm just being indecisive and I wanted some advice from someone who has played it.

At least you guys got a magical boat adventure out of that. 
---
It’s something you want for a bit at 60. BiS piece, some resistance items, moo cloth bags. Then after a month or two you drop it for something else, like Engineering or Alchemy.
---
Westfall is close, but nothing can quite match the sheer stupidity and wonder of barrens chat
---
No problem! I love the online guides and they *usually* mention that leveling is fun, but they do tend to gloss over the fact that those guides are mostly intended for people who have played vanilla extensively.
---
Have fun with it!
---
Appreciate you finding it. I don't see much hard evidence in a CM saying "we are listening"
---
[https://youtu.be/RAKvIx6eQpA?t=980](https://youtu.be/RAKvIx6eQpA?t=980) Here is the lead developers saying they have no intention of changing class balance. Video should start around the 16 min mark.
---
I love that you are a mod here, this was an unexpected but not surprising discovery. Love your content Soupa.
---
That was changed over the course of Vanilla, originally there was no limit and you could take a raid into a dungeon, but that was a decision they reconsidered and capped (and rebalanced) them. 
---
If we don't get server battle groups, its essentially a dead bracket.
---
My only gripe with 49 is the time it takes to get a 49 compared to a 29 or 39, and all the DM/BRD runs you need for BiS gear.  Its just a lot more difficult to gear up.  That and mounts.
---
More like [this.](https://s.blogcdn.com/wow.joystiq.com/media/2010/11/kyl-orcp-thrallprison-1290818951.jpg)
---
  Better get ready to spam chain heal.  
---
  ~~kill me~~
---
I'll check it out. I find it really hard to believe they will just allow certain specs to be pretty much unplayable due to poor balancing but I have been wrong before.
---
So they both deserve to be hanged? Really?
---
According to Ion, he is digging in his heels on not not releasing any RPPvP server at launch.
---
Which is a fantastic way to guarantee unhealthy / low populations on any RPPvP server that does launch - a big IF.
---
Please, tweet at Ion, post on the forums. Because RIGHT NOW,  they have NO INTENTION of releasing an RPPvP server at launch.
---
What does that mean? Play on a PvP server and cross your damn fingers that *your* server is offered transfers? Or reroll after months? What about your friends? What about my guild?
---
What about those who don't want to reroll? Those who never play because of a lack of server type?
---
Not having at least one RPPvP server at launch is a perfect way to fragment the community and ruin a lot of people's experience.
---
Please, this reddit thread is great, but tweet at Ion, respond to his tweet, post on the official forum.
---
Because RIGHT NOW, the battle is lost. It still needs to be won.
---
Yeah most people level in Westfall for DM or VC (whatever the fuck you call it) so the population is pretty big and filled with aids comments
---
Yeah it must have been after I finished up with that content on my Alliance guy. I switched over to Horde after about a year but I didn’t do any raiding with my Horde. 
---
was this a pvp tactic or just a soloing tactic?
---
How about using general chat in the zone you are... 
---
I mean it would seem pretty hard to find someone who has the same schedule as you. The game is a mmorpg, that means talking to people in game will get you farther than you think. No need for ressources or addons. /chat /addfriend /invite /profit
---
I'm horde and I agree
---
alliance is generally more popular on most servers. unless there are streamers stacking one side you will usually get a 52/48 split.
---
That freaking titan panel addon. My god where have the days gone.
---
The thing about damage reduction at higher ACs is, there's a reason that the increase goes down, it's because damage reduction increases at a rate such that time-to-live improvement is linear with AC.  So overall, a small increase in reduction at high AC is just as big an improvement as the large increase at low AC.
---
they will absolutely not have straight backs, every race has their original models
---
Aah, the refreshing absolutism of the internet outrage machine
---
It's been so long, but as far as I can remember, classes were pretty imbalanced for PvE in Vanilla. But back then we didn't have massive logs telling us certain classes were bad, so we just brought pretty much all classes anyway. We basically didn't know what we were doing, but we were having fun.
---
Nowadays we have TONNES of theory-crafting. Parses from Classic bosses will probably come out pretty quickly, effectively benching some classes because the differences were SO big if I recall correctly.
---
Doesn't Classic run the risk of becoming extremely class stacked, with like 20 of one dps class, because why would you bring another class that does 50% less damage?
---
We also have foreknowledge of how every class will play in years to come. Not only do we know all raids, we know all the upcoming class changes, because they have been done in the past. Let's say feral druids were shit for the first 2 years, and rogues were good the first 2 years. Why would anyone ever play or bring a druid?
---
they havent announced their plans for PvP but i doubt they will have BGs on launch, so yeah, get your world pvp game on.
---
My plan is doing skinning and herbing until max then dropping skinning. I’ve also looked into how much leather I would need to save to get me from 0-265 in enchanting. This is given I can find a kind leatherworker to craft the most efficient items for disenchanting for me. 
---
It still loses efficiency. Would be more fun and easier, but not as fast. I thought the point of these dues was to find the most efficient leveling combos.
---
I never kill a lowby unless they are attacking a friendly. Also I like to sneak up on lowbies and watch for them to get into trouble and help them, the way they freak out when they hear the cheapshot is delicious. Give them a /nod afterwards. Even lvl guys I live and let live, if they try me I'll kill them twice just so they get the picture, then leave them be.
---
pick whatever you want, both rogues and hunters are necessary in raids. Rogues provide top tier DPS while hunters provide tranq shot and other kiting mechanics for certain bosses. Hunters don't do the greatest DPS but they can be competitive if you do your rotation well and use engi stuff.
---
Regarding Druid tanking, is the best rotation for multiple mobs (disregarding other threat generating abilities) tab-swipe or tab-maul?
---
I do like the fantasy of the orc Shaman, but Tauren shaman is so bad-ass though!  Not to mention Warstomp combos, increased health, and ...the secret passive they never tell you about...
---
**Bigger Shoulder Armor**
---
To me it looks like an exaggeration for dramatic effect and not very damning at all. Youll have to find something better to hate him for.
---
It was just for fun! Wouldn't be great in PvP
---
Seein a lot of horde action in this thread bois. Guess i know my faction now &lt;_&lt;
---
swipe is the go-to with maul added when you've got more rage than you can swipe away.
---
This has become an essential ingredient to old screenshot threads. I'm surprised there's no meme yet
---
If I think I even have a 5% chance to win, I will attack. It’s that simple for me. The only time I will try to avoid an encounter is if I’m completely outnumbered, or they look like they’re a much higher level than me. 
---
Woah, what do you do with 40 chars? Raids? 
---
Ex warlord hunter here. Shoot.
---
The "problem" I see with Classic is that we know everything that's going to happen and that will likely influence our decisions like which class to play.
---
Not only will we know what raids come, we will also know all class changes, because they have been done before.
---
Let's say ferals were shit for the first 3 years of Vanilla. Why would anyone ever create, play or invite a feral when everyone now KNOWS ferals are going to be shit for the next 3 years in Classic?
---
 NO WAY
---
was looking for info on how well it works. 
---
If you're all on at the same time dungeon leveling is going to be good because otherwise the 4 of you are going to be fighting over limited overworld spawns.
---
Waiting to all be on at the same time will be slower than just leveling in the open world when you can, maybe as a duo to help with harder/elite quests.  Too many people and you're going to grind to a halt trying to finish quests and running out of non-elite mobs.
---
If you're having fun grinding in dungeons that would be the best way to level.  Mixing it up by all doing a little questing on the side when others aren't around will speed things up a ton.
---
Honestly staying in dungeons 90% of the time or out 90% of the time is going to cause you to miss out on at least some good content.  mixing it up is best.
---
39 or 49. I'd prefer mounts to no mounts but don't know how much time I wanna put into gearing.
---
Lol. The holocasust didn't need to happen. That's like saying any horrible man caused event happening is good because you believe it to be inevitable. The holocaust didn't need too happen, neither did 9/11 and neither does global warming. We know/knew those were bad things before they happened. Humans didn't need to gas millions of Jews too know gasing Jews is bad. We've commited genocide thousands of times before and the holocaust was just example of it. It didn't teach us killing is bad, we knew that already.
---
Also the supposed science we gained from the holocaust was junk because of the methods it was obtained. The narrative that we gained much scenitific knowledge is false. We learned that subjecting humans to terrible experiences fucks them up, yeah, real new knowledge. Fuck off with this edgy narrative that only sounds good if youre ignorant.
---
I doubt it. If you don’t have a WoW subscription, Blizz wants to funnel you toward retail. They don’t want a fresh player jumping into Classic instead.
---
And if they do implement it, I sure hope it’s not at launch.
---
The classic twink experience, can’t go wrong with that. 
---
&gt;I'd highly suggest having a couple alts just for sanity.
---
Or can just juggle thousands of items in your mailbox, with expiration dates, only be able to see 50 at a time, with no tangible way to track your progress, opt to never use your alt for AH duty, and hope you never go one vacation *puts pants on head*
---
And you won't ever clear it no matter how you set up your keybinds and UI. Do you want him to keybind his carrot on a stick or what?
---
No.
---
Added in TBC, lvl 62.
---
Some changes! 
---
As an Ally player, I tried to be the good guy so many times, but if experience taught me anything is that you should never show mercy, 'cause none will be shown to you, in most cases.
---
So pretty much, kill whenever you have the chance.
---
If only there was a way to join some sort of social group in the game, where people can chat and do things together. We could call it a clan or something. Maybe even where you could get pants with a color/pattern and have a clan name under your character name so everyone recognizes you.
---
What are the 3 dungeons? WC, RFK and what else?
---
It's not two hunters, but it is 2 of the same class
---
More alliance on PVE for obvious reasons. More horde on PVP servers usually. 
---
&gt; everyone who doesnt want an 'ugly' character will go ally
---
LOL
---
i cleared it in 2006, but thanks retard.
---
You had bandages. Warriors were some of the best AH buyers of cloth...the ones with no pocket healer
---
Wrath and Classic differ so much in class balance/development that nearly every class feels entirely different.
---
Go join a guild, there’s plenty of guilds already out there recruiting, both hardcore and not.
---
Priest could farm lashers in DM with Nova.
---
This is a really good question.  Will blizzard stay true and make no changes, or would it be best if they did some class balancing.  I don't think there is a right answer.  
---
I do think that druid will still get played, it's an underrepresented class anyway, but people not min/maxing will play druid.  Druids are a lot of fun!
---
Yeah fr any ssd is faster than that. I saw pcie ssd for 100 500 GB 
---
Might be an unpopular opinion, but leveling is only fun because of the community.  
---
If retail WoW stopped server sharing and didn't make mobs 1-3 hits and dead questing in retail would be amazing.  Vanilla WoW questing was fun because it was challenging and you were forced to engage with people.  But overall questing in retail is a much better design just not implemented correctly.
---
I don't think it healed till wrath though
---
You can say that again.  Threat generation was like 90% of non-raid tanking.  It ranged from incredibly easy to downright impossible and almost always correlated with DPS behavior.
---
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned a specific class as example :P 
---
I'm just worried Classic will be all dps warriors and whatever ranged class was best.
---
As a Mage you want bloodvine ideally, but not required. More importantly, I wouldn’t get Enchanting later — you’re better off starting with enchanting and a gathering spec (probably skinning). Then at 60 dropping the gathering spec for Tailoring, getting what you need over the next month, then dropping it for Engineering. There’s a big benefit to DE’ing all the greens as you level.
---
It's so hard for me to pick a class because *everything* in vanilla has a list of positives and negatives. Warrior/Mage/Rogue are objectively god classes, but have a disadvantage of being too common (loot competition) or gear-dependent in the case of Warrior. Hybrids except maybe Shaman are stuck in healing spec endgame, which means they can't farm efficiently. Hunter DPS falls off in later raids; and I guess Warlock doesn't really have any massive cons other than not being a mage. 
---
All this in mind, I'm leaning towards Warlock. Is there anything in particular a Mage can do that a lock can't that I'd be missing out on? (Besides AoE farming and free food/water)
---
I hope they implement an rp-pvp realm, as I would surely choose it for my realm. I appreciate the invitation. We'll have to see how things out. 
---
You don’t like google, do you?
---
This is the worst video I've ever seen and I recall opening a fake link some years ago to be greeted with a man sitting on a glass jar and then it smashing inside his anus.
---
That's a really good question, but I would come at it from the opposite direction. We know what vanilla was and we've been dying for it for years! Yes, there will be many people who roll a certain class because it's supposed to be top-tier for something, but overall people who played vanilla know what they're getting into and just want to play again. Many of us will play non-optimal classes/specs because that's our old characters and we're playing for the nostalgia rush. Many people will play non-optimal builds because they know that it doesn't matter unless they're aiming for super-competitive guilds trying for server-firsts. 
---
Also, if you talk to people on private servers, I bet they'll tell you of many non-optimal builds in the end-game. 
---
I don't think this will end up being an issue.
---
My point still stands.  I don't think there is a right or wrong answer.  I personally would enjoy some ^small class balancing in classic.  Change some numbers around, no new abilities or anything.  But I also know that would upset a lot of the #nochange group.  
---
Best bet is to just wait and see..
---
I started as an Orc hunter because I borrowed someone else's account to try the game out first and they said to roll horde.
---
But when I got my own account I went straight into Night elf hunter like I originally wanted, was my main for ages. Had the most fun using aimed shot from inside shadowmeld (before they removed it) and also having my stealthed panther pet sneak up on them.
---
very very very tempted to roll the same character again but I'm going to try something different to start with this time.
---
This guy takes montage to a whole new level.  Lol
---
priest?
---
But modern barrens isn't anything like vanilla barrens
---
Nope
---
It’s faster than drinking. Definitely not one of the spells I’d skip while leveling.
---
I mean I'm hoping to do either hybrid balance-resto or hybrid feral-resto. 
---
Hmm... having a "Silver Hand" Adjunct of Paladins and Priests does sound fun. In the end you could probably expand to warriors and rogues as well - Enforcers and Inquisitors. Mages, Druids, Warlocks and Hunters seems a bit antithetical to the theme though. 
---
Is this like the 10th one posted? Is it cause people aren't getting the answers they want? It will be blizzard like being 2.5k-4kmax
---
If all you want to do at endgame is PvP, go for it.
---
I haven't done the deepdive, but evidently fury is very viable for tanks due to the high threat generation and bloodthirst is a decent tool on its own. This will give you pretty good pvp viability but not as much as arms, and you'll be pulling more dps solo and in groups. Check into that because if it is doable for 55-60 dungeons, ubrs, etc, it will be way way worth it over arms
---
I see what you’re saying. Leveling and getting BiS for a 49 is what’s half the fun imo...To each his own.
---
Day one of Burning Crusades I joined "The Sunwell Covenant" - a purely BE RP Guild. Lasted for years - still got some guild members on Facebook. 
---
This isn’t 2007, there’s an achievement tab and the guys xp is seemingly locked?
---
This was a dream of mine - as troll for the Regen in combat of course
---
Dwarf Priest at Vanilla launch, but I don’t even think I got him to lvl 20. Came back months later with a NE priest and got him to 47~.
---
Then I graduated college and dove into the game in the summer of 2006. Leveled a Paladin to 60, but realized Ret was useless in raids, so I very quickly leveled a Mage to 60 and haven’t looked back since.
---
How you feel when you get the windfury one shot proccs

Unfortunately people can't be trusted to go unchecked nowadays... it used to be kind of bad but playful and fun but these days people just take shit to a whole other level.

---
Don't expect to replicate that leveling experience on any class, but especially warrior. Even the classes that can chain pull still have to conserve mana and have much slower kill speed than anything in wotlk.
---
I've never understood why people have separate combat logs on their screen. It's not like you can even read it, since it's scrolling at the speed of spam.
---
If the enemy comes near you, it means they do not respect your space. Attack!! or be prepaired for an ambush. 
---
If they are staying abit away from you and not getting in your way. Just let them be. Unless you want a fair fight. Then do a /ready and start attacking when they have gotten full hp. 
---
Youll learn quickly that there are no hard rules and most of the time you just gotta wing it.

Ah man, people used to flame me on MMO-Champion for wanting Vanilla servers. I can't tell you how many people were "100% certain" or would "bet [their] life savings" that it would never happen lol.
---
When it was announced someone made an "I told you so" post on there and a bunch of haters were like "whoooah why you being so harsh?" lmao same assholes that would shit all over the idea. Some people still insisted that they wouldn't follow through with Classic.
---
It's mage/mage, and if that isn't what he was going for - it should've been. 
---
I've since leveled a Shadow Priest to 120 and have gotten to 351 ilevel... love the playstyle... but can't help to think of my Paladin. I just love plate PVP with burst. I may main a Priest at 120 since they're in better shape PVE right now and then roll a Pally in classic.
---
Yeah uh...that's *REALLY* not how classic warrior is.
---
Wrath and classic are very different experiences, unless you have ultra pimp gear while levelling you'll be slowly trudging through mobs.
---
Deep!
---
Awesome watch. I love a good classic video that stays under 10 mins. Looking forward to watching them all
---
Thanks!

Damn right! I had a BiS Warrior twink at 49, and with some cheap consumables and easy buffs + Orc racial (topping at around 1500 AP), I have seen several 2,000 mortal strike crits on clothies and several white 1000 crits

The weapon skill racial is unknown values on classic some are saying it's too much increased threat/dmg on pservers compared to classic. We won't know how much it will benefit humans/orcs, but it will always be better we just don't know by how mucj
---
Man I keep switching between Mage and Priest and this is swaying further towards Priest 😅
---
I recently discovered that I had a level 19 twink warlock which i had totally forgotten about. He had pretty much best in slot gear even though I know we didn't call it that back in the day.

I might try to do a mage twink or something this time around.

Originally there was no cap for any dungeon, and it was popular to run dungeons in raids of 20+ people, even things like deadmines and SM because it was very quick and easy. Nearly all dungeons were balanced around 5 people but people didn't care they just like getting loot. Strat and Scholo had a couple of bosses/rooms that were hard enough that you wanted 10 people to do them, and ubrs was clearly always intended to be done by 10+ people. Later on (but still early on in vanilla as a whole) they capped everything it at 5 except for UBRS.
---
meeting stones = classic...literally a meeting point where you can wait for people to arrive
---
summoning stones = added in BC, 2 people could click on the stone and summon the others to the dungeon entrance
---
&gt; The silence is a pretty fucking big deal when theres no dungeon finder ect.
---
In what way? You can still join groups, you can still create groups. You can chat in the groups you create, you can still talk in guild chat. And they removed the disconnect. You only get the disconnect now if you are reported for a name violation and a GM decided they want you to change it. You get kicked to login screen and have to rename before playing again.
---
But other than that, why cant you raid or do dungeons while muted? Are you all sure you even understand the system? It stops you only from PM'ing people not on your friends list (or you on theirs) also it stops public channel and /s chat for a limited time, rising each occurrence. But your guild chat is kept in place, as is your ability to form groups and speak in those group chats.
---
&gt; Me and my friends were muted in game many times when selling dungeon boosts for gold

You aren't going to get any sympathy here. You are exactly the type of person most would like to see banned from spamming chat with that garbage tbh.
---
Watching a really well built twink enhance shaman at 39 with a PoD getting a lucky WF and instantly deleting someone never got old.
---
&gt; and dude you told me to "kys" replying to an earlier comment so
---
&gt;    you can fuck right off
---
&gt;    youre the exact kind of person that actually would try to abuse it
---
Yep, every time. Its always people like that trying to undermine this particular system. They are toxic and they can foresee themselves being muted due to their inability to be anything other than an absolute moron in public chat.
---
Tyvm for this! The xp values are extremely valuable to me. I can only imagine how long this took.
---
Imp kidney is invaluable IMO. 
---
It can be the difference between 1 extra backstab (2 ish ss/hemo).
---
Well first off, there are no bans. People are claiming "bans" to make the system sound scarier to whip up support for trashing the system.
---
You should read these threads honestly, then find the posters most vehemently against the system and check their post histories. Take note of how many people they tell to "KYS" and "F OFF Cuck" and all of that.... 
---
It will help you understand why this system is so feared. Those guys are dead meat in a RCR system. They'll be muted before their 10th annoying Political meme and they know it. RCR is like a nightmare to those guys.
---
The thing that sells this the most is that your top dps as sub. Man people did some much random shit back in the day. I was similar status in my guild (12/15 naxx) and raided as 31/8/12 which is awful spec for raiding but was always near top dps.
---
All that running around the zone to different quests means a lot of downtime to chat.
---
I did one Druid for 19 29 39 and 49, and it was tons of fun. Just one of those specs that nags people and runs around being a nuisance. 39 is my favorite for Druid, but I have more fun in AB. 
---
This is why I love pvp servers. All the hardcore roleplayers like this guy are there.
---
Think about it like this, a decent raid will likely have 6+ Warriors in it.  MT/OT/3rd tank, then a handful of Fury Warriors.  Normally, we run with about 8 Warriors.  MT/OT are almost always tanking.  Sometimes the OT will use Annihilator/Nightfall, as will the 3rd tank.  Sometimes the 3rd tank is wearing full Fury gear and DPSing.  The DPS  Warriors will tank on trash, and on some bosses in MC/BWL/AQ/Naxx.  
---
It depends on what role you want to fill.  If you want to be the MT, you generally have to be really good/knowledgeable/a try hard.  The raid will be depending on you.  For any other role, eh, whatever.
---
A mage was my first 19, and lemme tell you considering rogues were the overwhelming class, it was a consistent pleasure getting them with frostbite. Pretty decent flag carrier if you can get a pocket pally to give you freedom. 
---
Around 474 medium, 414 heavy and 528 thick. This is from very simple calculations and you could probably do with a bit less of each. 
---
&gt; Me and my friends were muted in game many times when selling dungeon boosts
---
Good.
---
It seems I made a mistake on my last spec; I can get both. Now I'm wondering exactly what spec I made last time...
---
[This is it, btw.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/BM_EyHAABM_wD3Q) It's swords/maces hemo.
---
Warrior leveling is slow and painful. You'll be using every 2h weapon you can find with a high dps stat, staff? Yes. Polearm? Yes. Anything 2h, higher dps than what you have. 
---
You have cooking and bandages, good luck.
---
That would mess so many people up
---
June 26th is a Wednesday though. June 25th is a Tuesday and a full week before the next FF14 expansion though.
---
Might even use the same program
---
So let me get this straight. A guy annoyed you, and you told him to "Kill himself". And subsequently, you are here whining because the community will be given a tool to mute toxic people in chat?
---
I am.... not surprised this system bothers you. At all.
---
This is a refreshing choice of music for an old pvp video. Also very well edited. 
---
I would recommend taking the time to watch [MadSeasonShow's class picking guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE). Or take a look at [this guide](https://www.classicwow.live/picking-your-class).
---
Mostly though, just pick whichever one looks cool, has the best class fantasy, feels the best, etc. They're all lots of fun fun, they're all raid, dungeon, PvP, and solo viable, except that warriors are particularly gimped solo relative to other classes.
---
It might help to clarify your statement if you don't want a wall of cognitive dissonance between your message and your reader's acceptance.
---
If I'm not botching it, I feel like priests were considered the best blanket healers, i.e. throwing heals widely across all members of the raid (tanks/dps/healers). By contrast, I believe paladins were considered the best **main tank** healers, with the mana efficiency of their flash spam making them the best for longevity healing on the main raid tank. 
---
So paladin is best for deep, narrow heal ranges, priest is best for wide, shallow heal ranges, if I want to view it that way. 
---
private server :D
---
Ceyx from Darkspear? Just curious.
---
I dont remember us playing on darkspear at all but you can ask him if ya just wanna join discord
---
I've got a lot of respect for both Thrall and the tauren. If the general orc population was more like Thrall, I think I'd be more inclined to roll one. I guess I can always RP a Thrall-acolyte shaman type. That could be fun! 😝 
---
It looks good, it’ll be interesting without imp gouge. I love imp gouge 
---
I’m not a lore nerd, it just sounded funny. But thank you! I hate him now too. 
---
This was my plan but you basically have to have eng as one prof so it’s a bit wasted as a prof alt
---
Just arming gold to pay for a couple years of subs so I can solo mc ony zg/aq 20 and maybe bwl come classic hehe
---
THIS. I'm not all in RP as in you can never break character or discuss anything else. I just don't want names like "urdeadfgyt" or people bitching about immigrants in local chat ruining my immersion and connection to the world and other players. Be a dickhead all you want but at least use your brain, make the rivalry fun.
---
my dude that is the majority of casuals.
---
^ This. Find a guild that fits you and you shouldn’t have a problem finding someone to level with.
---
Here’s a resource option for that: https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq
---
Yeah, like I said it's a game about two factions at war. Lowbey or not that player is your enemy from a role play point of view.
---
lol u speak weird xd
---
not a clicker, BTW
---
I'm looking forward to exactly this experience once Classic launches. Except I'll simply be getting up before sunrise rather than pulling an all-nighter. Both because getting up at 4am for work means I do that anyway and (mostly) because I'm not a teenager anymore and I just can't pull crap like that anymore without paying a higher cost than I'd care to.
---
Looking for leveling partner(s)  at launch. 
---
Faction: undecided 
---
Class: Warrior
---
Server: PvP
---
US - Eastern Timezone 
---
Schedule - Work a 9-5pm during the week. 
---
Available most days anytime after 5pm. Likely until midnight - 2am. Weekends mostly free all day / night. 
---
I have extensive experience having been playing vanilla for years. 
---
PM me to talk further 
---
Same.
---
Not sure if you are aware, but the talent Murder in assassination doesn't apply to players.
---
If my Dad knew how to use Reddit his response would probably be, “because seven ate nine”. 
---
19 rogue was fun back then, hard not to do it again 
---
Yea over on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5s5ud/main_tank_discussion/) (s/o Icosiol below for getting me hip) a lot of different people respond with interesting comments. Pretty interesting theory, but looks like we'll have to wait till classic to see if this approach will transfer from private servers. Looks to be pretty contingent on 1) having a reliable healer 2) the exact aggro protection tanks will be able to generate come official release. Decent chunk seem to say it isn't necessary until max DPS, but others say during progression raids you need protection spec. Does seem to be an interesting option for my situation at the very least. Thanks for the response! 
---
I mean yes but not many of us can call upon 40 people to suspend someone for 24 hours, I can't even get 4 other people  to attack the skull tarhet
---
This would benefit me as I actually play on my laptop...
---
If you want to go under represented, human priest is a solid choice hah. 
---
What an amazing time 
---
I wasn't aware of that, actually. Is it confirmed blizzlike?
---
I'm going to make a 29 twink hunter guild, doing premades with 10 hunter twinks. Name &lt;Fighting Against GnomeS&gt;
---
What is that awful racket?
---
I prefer 39 for druids but 29 is still fun AF
---
Been tossing up between orc and tauren shaman for weeks now.  
---
I may end up rolling orc and just running to mulgore to start with lol.
---
Good point.
---
&gt;Wow classic was not about the slow paced leveling, but about player/social interaction. The community. At least for me.
---
Everyone's wrong about this.
---
It means 100,000 things to 100,000 different people.
---
Oh hell yeah man! we're gonna quest when we feel leveling slow down prolly, but we are going to grind the shit out the dungeons, especially the scarlet monastery 
---
I can't comment about retail questing much because I haven't bothered to read the quest text in the little bit of time I have played. But I definitely agree about the community - if it weren't for the community, vanilla would have been ... well, just like retail. One of retail's problems is that there are too many levels and the content is so spread out that you almost never see another player while you're leveling. The world has just gotten too big to allow for player interaction.
---
thousands of items? 
---
It's not that many trust me, also u can eaisly get a few 8 slots bags super cheap. Then u have 44 bag slots. U can use these 44 bag slots to go between ah/mailbox anyway.
---
Also this is what most people do that has a lot of stuff or what someone like Joana does for speedrunning.
---
true, they've come so far they no longer exist 
---
Noo, I was quoting him talking about people being annoyed about someone trying to sell something in game and reporting that person. I was never annoyed by him. I think my downvotes are a result of people missing the quote marks.
---
Jumped the shark and splurged on a gaming laptop already. Gotta be prepared and I always have Total War Warhammer 1 and 2 to tide me over till then. Shit, who I'm kidding. Any and all Total War games
---
Ganking is really over exaggerated. Very few people are going to waste their time killing lowbies who are just questing. If someone is locking down your questing area or corpse camping you just spirit rez, go to a different zone and come back later.
---
Both are sooooo much fun
---
Simple. Be the Guildmaster.
---
It depends on what you want to do. A good combination of "usable for character" and "make decent money" would be tailoring + gathering profession. On my priest, I'll be doing tailoring for Truefaith Vestments (Robe of the Archmage for mages) and skinning so that I have something that gives me some cash while I level. 
---
Another classic combo for clothies is tailoring / enchanting. This is good because you can DE the stuff you make while leveling tailoring so you have the mats to level enchanting. But it takes away a significant source of income while you level which makes it harder to afford your mount at 40. 
---
\&gt; Are we not supposed to bullshit and troll around in chat?  
---
...No lol. Literally no, you're not. Can't wait to right click report people like you and then see you whine about your experience being "ruined" because you don't have free reign to say racist, homophobic, and sexist shit. Barrens chat was iconic in the mid 2000s. We're all 15 years older now. 99% of that stuff is cringey now. Grow up.
---
Even in the OP's link the guy says he was probably reported because of his name but conveniently doesn't say what his name was.
---
Because there's a lot more detail in the newer models than the older ones. And some of the customization features have more options. I was recreating my vanilla dwarf in retail and I was in awe at how many beards and hair styles there were. 
---
Also, my hunter's bear looks like an actual bear and not a giant feral rat.
---
All of classic will be a twink server. 
---
Chuck Norris doesn't have a chin.  Under his beard is another fist.
---
cool but how do you filter this
---
I've leveled two shamans to 60 on private servers. Leveling elemental before say 35ish is simply not worth it, and even after that point (when you get elemental fury/ lightning mastery) enhancement still outperforms it. I see that you don't care about leveling speed, but the rotation for elemental vs. enhancement at lower levels is very similar, the only difference is that you might pull with a lightning bolt or two. Improved ghost wolf, thundering strikes, and flurry are just too good to give up. 
---
If you are intent on leveling as elemental however, my only advice is to always scope the AH for "of Nature's Wrath" pieces of equipment. They are usually pretty cheap and will boost your damage by a decent amount.
---
I see what you're after, but I'm going to second the suggestion to just talk to people in general chat in the zone you're in or in a city before you leave to do some questing / killing / dungeoning / etc. That kind of server interaction between players is most of the reason that we want vanilla back, so take advantage of it and have fun!
---
That's the weirdest place I've ever seen someone put their most important ability.... 
---
We rember events, not the routine. That's why most of our fondest memories are of experiencing things for the first time, like seeing a new zone or beating a new raid boss. Once it becomes routine, it just becomes noise. 
---
A valid correction on the past tense.  
---
That said, it was just a joke. :P  
---
Further -- and this is very subjective -- but I don't trust forum polls for what I'll see in-game. Why? Because Classic is at *least* 2 months away, and many players aren't even remotely interested in the discussion(s) yet.   
---
That said, the basis of what you're saying could still be true. More healers are likely due to monitor sizes/accessibility, etc...
---
Pretty sure there's quite a lot of leather from Argent Dawn/Thorium Brotehrhood that really has no equal outside Raid drops.
---
Flarecore Belt, Dawn Treaders, etc.
---
What happened to Bagjo and Busm? Bagjo disappears around the 40s and Busm seems to have been left behind at 60.

Can anyone recommend a good class for someone that is new to tanking but wants to learn for classic? I was thinking of going pally to also be able to heal but I'm really not sure since I never played vanilla . 
---
we would swap dorm rooms depending on who was doing the most important stuff.  Good times.
---
I'm curious as well.  How is engineering a superior profession.  I've never leveled it much.  Outside of jumper cables I was under the impression that a lot of engineering was cosmetic / fun items.

Thanks for the feedback! 
---
I definitely want to play him as a caster, but the hybrid spec I was thinking about would be something like a spellsword archetype - hit them with spells until they're close and then smash faces with melee! This will be an alt, so I should have some extra funds to grab the occasional bit of gear from the AH. 
---
Perfect or not, that stuff actually happened. Sometimes it was after someone asked in /general for help, but other times it's because you're in a populated area. 
---
And indeed, the social cohesion you spoke of is (or was) real. Seeing that person randomly as you level up or at max level has a neat feeling to it.

---
Literally the only people worried about this are the people who deserved to be banned or muted in the first place. You're not a streamer with thousands of people watching you and no one is coordinating some mass report scheme to get you. If enough people are reporting you for some auto mute to happen it's 100% because you're spamming stupid shit.
---
If private servers are any indication, it blows my mind that people actually think they have some inherent right to spam racist/sexist/homophobic shit with impunity or that this is some fundamental part of vanilla wow. You're just immature. Grow up.
---
I'll suggest something a little different from the others with Shaman.  They're useful at end game (healers), have heals which makes accidentally pulling 4 mobs not a death sentence, good group buffs, and two different non-healer DPS specs that are great in 5 man dungeons + soloing (sans AoE farming).  PvP is nice too, Elemental has enough burst power to burn through most people.  I did a Shaman 1-60 on a private server and it was (relatively) a breeze to level as you can solo almost anything the game throws at you within reason.  I think Paladin is a good alternative if you don't want to play Horde, but a little less versatile.
---
You can also do some dungeon tanking with clever use of abilities and an open-minded party, but I wouldn't 100% recommend that lol.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4&amp;t=) you have a good and "short" video comparing all classes. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTQ5284GiI&amp;list=PLiGcT3dOk5iAZ8woMatxbKvfM1rMzKivz) is a playlist I can recommend you to watch if you have more time and like jokes. I think you should just play which class you find the most fitting to yourself :)
---
CHEATED HARD, totally still not salty from those tower of power matches.
---
Not at all stupid. Warriors have the hardest time solo grinding. This profession combo will help you a lot while leveling since you can buff yourself up with elixirs and heal yourself with potions. Come late game you'll have a great profession combo to make money.
---
Also alchemy consumables are extremely powerful for PvP too, moreso than engineering.
---
funny thing was the home I came from had a wood burning stove for heat, so it probably smelled more like campfire than anything.
---
Remember that Skarm's stuff is based off Private Server code. He is also an elitist and would probably rage quit in an average guild. So he probably gets top quality healers to keep him up.
---
For leveling, whatever you do will likely be fine but I wouldn't take those guides as gospel.
---
They 100% won't be the most popular class. If anything they're fairly underplayed since their only good role in raids is healing.
---
Asking the important questions
---
Why do raptors need silver anyway?
---
but its BoP
---
I think 5k is the sweetspot. 
---
Ok, that would annoy me too if it was in a city. I would definitely answer with a price tag for it then.
---
This is my conundrum as well, though in a different way. WoW was my addiction from its release.  That only worsened once I learned what raiding was, and found a way into it. If my vanilla experience is to be trusted, I can't possibly do what I once did. I can't possibly put in the required effort to get myself raid ready, much less guild mates like I once did (key runs, FR gear runs, herbing, etc.).  I simply don't have the time to commit to it.
---
IMO, 12 hours a week likely won't get you into a permanent raid slot. That being said, being a decent person, and being a decent player who knows your class and how to play it effectively without being a detriment to a group, will likely make you some friends. This can potentially get you a spot as an alternate and lead to some fun adventures if you're willing to help when it's needed. As important as consistent raiders are to a guild, sometimes useful reserves are the difference between a guild raiding and not raiding when regulars can't make it on raid nights. Just bear in mind that some classes are in higher demand than others, and that plays a role in the odds of your seeing the inside of MC/BWL or not, if you're hoping to do so on a casual schedule.
---
Now if your idea of 'playing to its fullest' is just doing things at your own pace and enjoying the game when time allows, how many hours a week you play is irrelevant. I played for a couple of years before I ever bothered with raids, partly because I didn't know about them for a while, and partly because I had to find a way to get in with some people and help build a guild to do it with once I did. I had lots of fun the whole time.
---
Wisp is nice, but ultimately only useful for solo play. You still have to wait on your non-night elf brethren to run back. Where night elf warrior really shines is being able to shadowmeld while you’re afk and avoid being ganked. 
---
I cannot fathom the type of people who think taking a picture of the WoW CD or some random manual is somehow worthy of spamming this subreddit. I'd even prefer the one millionth "Which class should I play?" post.
---
Are you ready? Maybe? IDK? What the fuck is the point of this post?
---
It was a lawless time.  The advent of facebook and myspace allowed everyone to share their cheesy, ridiculous, low quality pics at will.  Never Forget
---
Cool, glad to see.
---
One of the counter-points I'll say is, if you have a good group, being fury *and* being able to hold aggro means you can do more dps. A little. But more. Your dps will need to be on point, and heals. Same argument for bear druids etc - higher dps, less mitigation in many situations. Double edged
---
Past level 26, i think (cat form gets dash) druids don't die in wpvp unless you want to risk it going for a kill. 
---
I just love how kidney shot is on 1 lol
---
You will never be more glad of wisp form than when you die on the run into Razorfen Downs as alliance and have to corpse run from FREAKING RATCHET.  Second place is probably dying at the north side of the ruins
---
Ruins of Alterac and running not just from Southshore but also having to navigate half a dozen impassable walls or mountains in the way of the most direct path.  Northern Feralas is also a beatch, it looks fairly close but you have to travel south quite a ways to then travel north.   
---
I agree, druids are great/amazing tanks in 5 mans. Tank and healer are neither rolls of a warlock though.
---
Yeah the issue is that elemental is weak as hell until you have 2 sec lightning bolts (which is far down in the tree) and you won't be smashing any faces until you've got a decent amount of points in enhancement (at least to flurry). Can't really have both while leveling cause math.
---
On top of that it's kind of impossible to gear for both caster and melee at the same time. 
---
Unfortunately I think the best route for a hybrid leveling build on shaman is basically just level to 40-45 as enhancement then swap when ele gets decent. At which point I have to mention your melee will be much more of a grindy process than a smashing faces one.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Personally I think the 2500 back in the day was too low and this will cause queues which I really don't want.
---
4k-5k is ideal for me since that means the server will be populated with people running stuff for months but won't be over-pop so much that black lotus plants will be camped by farmers.
---
built 5 different 19 rogue twinks before finally nailing the setup to be accepted into a twinking guild. It's all i did in retail vanilla, can't wait to go back.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxGMsfodLVEcooo
---
something like this, you can juggle some points in feral. if not pushing for progression you can also heal in raids with this spec.
---
Do you want to heal or Dps in raids? That should be your answer 
---
&gt;  I really enjoy the idea of a powerful warrior enhanced by the elements. 
---
I presume you want to be enhancement. I'll try to not crush your dream, but: enhancement s\*cks. It used to be sweet before the WF nerf. But enhancement was a weak spec back in the day, because everything was so reliant on WF proccing, and if it doesn't, you haven't got a whole lot of tools to survive for long or to escape with. If you really want to combine magic and melee, I'd suggest a retridin.
---
Resto or elemental will make you a great supporting class though (totems, shocks, purge -- especially purge spam is very underrated). Your only real downfall then is Curse of Tongues. So have a decurser in your group if you PvP.
---
&gt; You will die a lot
---
This is an overstatement, on a PVE realm you can easily (by not being shit) get to 60 with no deaths as a warrior outside of group content.
---
Yeah 39 might be the best of all those, but I feel like 29 is quite fun too.
---
Agreed completely :)
---
It's true, but the system itself had some pretty respectable power regardless.  Decent ram, quick startup, front facing speakers.  100% the best value I'd ever had.
---
This was a defining moment for me. Had an Aussie pally friend who coached me through all of the nuances of completing it. He even sat and watched me fail my way through several attempts of the event he couldn't actually see. Made him so proud when I finally completed it. It's an experience I can never expect to replicate, but it would be on my list if I could. 
---
&gt;some classes and specs unviable
---
Not every single class and spec in this game needs to do top damage in a Patchwerk fight. If you want to do a damage, pick a damage man. If the class you want to play as is capable of casting a healing spell, you better get used to healing in a group content setting, because everyone else is doing what they are BEST at doing in that setting.   
---
This is why the tier gear is secretly way better than people spreadsheet it out to be. They put on these blinders and think of content solely in context of endgame group PvE encounters. Nevermind the entire rest of the game where you'll need to minimize downtime, be ready for ganks, and just generally be able to fend for yourself, I guess.  
---
Every class is viable, every spec is viable. Just not for Endgame, PvE group content where you and only you have done all the damage and everyone is impressed with your chesthair and bulge.
---
Can’t wait for “LFMor’ Ladim”
---
&gt; Warriors were some of the best AH buyers of cloth...
---
Not true at all, maybe runecloth at 60 well after the leveling process.  But there's no shortage of cloth for bandages while simultaneously leveling your character and first aid.  Who's actually buying cloth? Locks/mages leveling tailoring and first aid.
---
Solid video! I like the way you hint at the last boss of RFK without giving it away completely. 
---
This dude hits like a truck xD
---
Cool thanks 
---
Wow the meme was real. You only need weather news.
---
If I had the time, I'd be all about collecting rare hunter pets again. 20 hours sitting under a tree outside ratchet as Gravybeard (my dwarf hunter) to tame a black lion (named it Omen, after by RL black cat I just put down a few weeks ago RIP), and securing it just before I got merked by some pissed of 60s. Good times. 
---
Strat, Scholo and BRD are the only dungeons capped at 5. You can yolo Scarlet Monastery with 10 people if you like.
---
The first time I went through there was legitimately scared of this dude. You would be fighting some other mob then BAM dead.
---
Mor'Ladim sneaky bastard.
---
And he agro leashes like a mother fuck.

&gt;Hello players! We realize you're excited for a Classic server release date - and we are too! We are happy to announce the prerequisites for unlocking the Classic flag on your World of Warcraft account!
---
&gt;First, your account **must** have an active BFA subscription *and* a Classic WoW subscription - both remain at their standard $14.99 per month rate.
---
&gt;Second, your account **must** have earned the "Level 120!" achievement on BFA. Don't worry players - this can be earned on Alliance, or Horde, and on any server you want! If you don't have the patience to level, please look into one of our level boost options available on the store.
---
&gt;And finally, your account **must** have the [Insane in the Membrane achievement](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2336/insane-in-the-membrane) unlocked - true vanilla players should have this done in no time (if it isn't done already), so no sweat for you diehard vanilla players out there!
---
&gt;Once you meet these requirements, you can queue for Classic WoW servers by going to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and using the portal in the middle of the room. Don't worry, we will scale all players down using our newest scaling technology!

Isn't RFD a pretty annoying run for horde too? I thought theirs was in xroads, so it's still like a 10 min run. 
---
yeah i forgot corehound belt. again, not really a rare pattern and also unlikely to be in the game pre bwl. from my experience there is just not much tips to be gained with leatherworking.
---
I've always wanted to give World of Warcraft a try, since I was an early teenager (about 9 years ago). This desire clearly was never strong enough for me to save money to buy it, throughout all these years, but at the sale time it's something I've always wanted to try. Would it be too late to start playing it tomorrow, if I could?
---
This is actually not true. Warrior is faster than rogues after lvl 30.
---
Mor'ladim is 35. What is this abomination.
---
Warrior is the only real tank class in vanilla.   Pally and druid can tank but won't be main tanking raids
---
Yeah, for someone who shouts his birth Mr. Rapeface will catch you on the road quite easily too.
---
But as for the sneakiest... I played Vanilla Horde for the first time in a P Server and the Sons of Arugal in Silverpine as nightmares incarnate. 
---
I see both points. 
---
On one hand, having fun, subjective as that is, is the name of the game. To that effect, "join guilds that are willing to work with you" is the key, and freedom of association is mutual. It's a good suggestion, to find people who will compromise with you and care more about your company and the journey, rather than simply the destination (gear/rank/et cetera). For those who will accept you as you are, embrace them in return, because you have one life to live, limited time/resources, and you shouldn't do something you don't want to.
---
BUT, I also see the perspective of pick-up groups (not guild-mates, but pick-up groups doing you a favor by inviting you.
---
I ran a 60 warrior main in vanilla WoW, second 60 was a feral druid. I'd see LFG for Zul'Gurub or something and apply as a druid. They'd ask if I had heal gear, just like a hundred times I'd been asked before, and I was indignant. I dreamed of doing damage, I didn't want to heal. People would get butthurt about my spec, argue about dps meters, and I dug my heels in at the time.
---
Years later, however (I quit late in WotLK), I considered how relatively weak the limited talents allowed feral to be in Classic. For one, you have a single weapon and not two, and so only one enchant. Regarding that enchant, Crusader and other on-hit proc effects couldn't be triggered in cat form. No poisons compared to rogues, either. I rolled on Shadowcraft gear because it wasn't class specific, even if it aggravated a rogue in a PuG, because it was my dream. I don't even fully regret that, because I put in the work to kill the bosses, and wanted my share of the spoils. The point is, however, that I simply did not want to admit that the rogue was the better damage-dealing class. I imagined, if only I had all of the gear that they had, I'd be competitively viable, that my hybrid class and its utility didn't come at the cost of being the best in the role I desired. Only later was I educated about how a cat likely couldn't challenge similarly-geared rogues more often than not.  
---
In conclusion, there are people who will love seeing you try your best at what you love, and there are people who only love to see you try your best at what trial and error has mathematically demonstrated to be effective over a decade ago.
---
Find the people who are carefree, while trying not to be a burden to the people who are not.
---
The were good ofc but 39 ele shaman with soj was even crazier.
---
I have to disagree. I played warrior all through vanilla. Tanked every piece of non-raid content and off tanked Molten Core and ZG 20. I never once went prot and didn’t gimp the group one bit.  In fact, MC raids would only let 1 tank go prot, otherwise you lost a significant amount of DPS.  So go prot if you want to, but you don’t have to in order to tank pre-raid content
---
Bet a fury warrior ended up on top in the end though
---
It would change my life, again. I'd hope they would do optional character transfers so I can level another warlock &amp; keep my classic one forever.
---
And I will state it again: Nostalrius wasn´t filled with private server vets, but had huge amount of players who were bored with WoD and wanted to try Vanilla.
---
It burns my eyes and I like it.
---
Definitely making one or two 19 twinks. Love the bracket
---
I had a 39 druid twink that I ended up leveling to 60 and I missed it so much I made a new one.  
---
Well, from what you've shared, I'm gonna think priest is your suit. 
---
Rolling shaman in classic is more so about knowing your utility with totems and which group your raid leader puts you in to get the most of them every boss encounter. Totems can also be a pain on patrolling trash if you forget to dismiss them (and there is no totemic recall)
---
If you're wanting to spam heal and not have to worry about the constant time on every totem you have (also not difficult to do) then priest.
---
Isn't that what most PvP videos are though?
---
There’s no time for reverse. Once you see him it’s too late. His agro radius reaches the gates of Stormwind. 
---
Luke drank green goo from an 8 foot tall bipedal sea cow, no one wants that
---
Hah, yeah I always somewhat regretted levelling up my 39 Druid too actually.
---
Hmmm, I didn’t know totems lingering around would be a problem. I’d hate to get blamed for a bad shaman in the group and they assumed it would be me... 
---
“I recasted my totems away from respawns, I swear!”
---
First steps out of darkshire and he's looking your direction 
---
Like another poster said, it depends what you want to do. If you want to enjoy enjoy professions while leveling, you can go with tailoring/enchanting, which provide upgrades while leveling. If you want to focus on making money, you can go with mining/herbalism/skinning/enchanting while leveling. The gathering profs bring in mats and disenchanting greens can sometimes yield higher value mats than vendoring the greens.
---
Engineering is great in that it gives you unique, practical advantages, like grenades, but it's quite expensive to level and use.
---
When you're 60, it's nice to keep the gold-making profs when you're gearing up, you still go out farming and you still get stuff to disenchant. But you probably want to aim towards getting engineering eventually for the advantages. And down the road when ZG comes out, you'll want tailoring for the bloodvine set bonus. But that's late game when it's not the end of the world to switch profs.
---
Don't like it, don't use it is LITERALLY the argument made in favor of every single qol change to the game since 1.0.   it was a wrong, bad, argument then and it is now.  
---
So hear me out, and read before you judge- I hate and despise the style of the new graphics. The Tauren are furries.  The female orcs just look like the old human males.  The cartooniness of the originals was endearing, the horde looked mean, ugly, and menacing, the humans looked like stuck up pricks, the gnomes were determined but laughable and the undead were revolting.  Now they are all attractive and homogenized in the beautiful way Blizzard does things.
---
BUT.   I want to be playing the same game as everyone else.  And this is a freaking fantasy game of which graphics and appearances are a big part.  So if that means that everything is changed to modern graphics, then
---
so be it.  I'm fine with that.  What I really don't want is to be playing a graphically different game than everyone else.  No toggles for life.   I still miss the original original ogre diaper babies. 
---
What's soj
---
obviously
---
real shit lol
---
For real
---
I am vehemently against toggles:  Don't like it, don't use it is LITERALLY the argument made in favor of every single qol change to the game since 1.0. it was a wrong, bad, argument then and it is now.

---
boring ones yeah  
---
videos that show skill are a lot more interesting  
---
Well, the whole thing with raids speed running and all they end up waiting for patrols to go away so they can skip em. And having those lingering totems (that wouldn't be on your conscious with totemic recall) is another thing to keep tab on. 
---
IIRC for the totems to go away, they have to burn through their time, or be recast in a new position. 
---
Honestly not a big difference maker, but the utility of shamans in raid is chain heal and totems. Chain heal is also the only spell I can think of that ignores group priority and can jump through the raid to heal all of the raid. 
---
But I want my AB =\
---
yeah now that i think about it that was asked quite a lot.
---
I want to quest but this one skeleton keeps kicking my ass..
---
I haven't really found warriors too hard to level in vanilla. Between bandages, food, and health pots, your down time isn't too bad. But you have to keep in mind the area you're in and the mob levels. I think it's useful to grind in an area that has mobs with a slight range of levels--some low enough that you can easily build rage without wasting abilities, and some higher to give you enough exp. By alternating between the two level groups, the down time is very manageable. It's well worth being in a slightly lower-level area. 
---
Complete shot in the dark here so forgive me of I'm wrong, did you used to play Call of Duty 2 back in the day?
---
It's one main reason why I can't see myself going alliance.. At least not on my main server. 
---
I think Stitches is the anti-mankriks wife. Instead of people asking where he is to find him, it's usually people warning to stay away from him.
---
Staff of Jordan
---
OBLEETERATED!
---
FTFY
---
Oh good point. 
---
I enjoyed AB but the unique feeling about being the MVP flagrunner of WSG was just unreal. 
---
What did you like about AB?
---
And he can play with the monitor switched off!
---
There’s nowhere to run either. Up the hill? You’re more fucked. Down the hill? Spiders and skeletons. Out of the graveyard ? Wolves. Down the crypt? More undead.
---
Zoinks!
---
AOE'ing and getting top damage doesn't mean you were good. It's like people in overwatch who only play DPS and talk about how they got the gold medal (top score) in damage. Damage means nothing if it doesn't secure kills and objectives at the right place/time.
---
yea you can, I double trapped + wyvren all the time in BC.
---
Yes but there are a very large amount of people that have never touched a private server that will play. Again I will repeat myself from some where else in this thread, you’re under estimating the real life recruiting power of adults that DO NOT want to play this game alone.  I myself have recruited my wife, 2 of my best friends, and my uncle.I know about 15 people across the US and only 3 of us have ever bothered looking up private servers, check forums, look for Blue Posts, etc. 
---
Point being, there is a demographic that is not being represented and these are the people that are the most likely to get sucked into WoW Classic. The people that are excited to be playing with their spouse,family, friends. Id be highly surprised if many on these forums haven’t at least tried to recruit people to play WoW Classic with from their irl.
---
Well, iirc, after you zone in, you pop up at the bottom of the great lift which is very short.   However, if you die on the run in, you have to traverse the barrens, and to add insult to injury, (again iirc) the straightest path takes you basically through the horde graveyard which is halfway through the run next to a hill south of taurajo. I have done this instance as horde but I don't know if I've ever died on the run in since you can't get ganked.  Since, you know, every freaking leveling instance is in horde territory it seems.  Small price to pay for BRM being next to the most major and convenient alliance city I guess.
---
I am resurrecting my day 1 character all over again. Soulfer the Orc shaman. I’ve played him for 13 years and he never gets old! Nothing more bad ass than a wielder of lightning and harnessing the power of the elements.
---
If you plan on going Alliance and like to heal, I'm going to suggest Paladin.
---
They are good in dungeons as any spec, so you can get familiar with all of the roles. Really only holy spec in raids and they are great PvP healers. Solo is great as they have great self-sustain, although they are really slow to kill things with as they don't really have a great damage output solo, but you probably won't die either. They are also beloved for their buffs which are super amazing.
---
This was my thinking as well, trying to find out how to get tailoring/engineering for the Bloodvine crit, and if I can drop tailoring upon completion of the items, going enchanting.
---
Especially as a mage, selling enchants is nice, and a mage being able to teleport from capitol to capitol makes that job easier to perform, as a side note.
---
Get rekt nightfire
---
As a Druid only? Great at getting to the mill or the mine first, unless a hunter beats you to it (ignoring speed buffs)
---
Stealth camping and pinging people trying to cap, and run around self sustaining yourself waiting for backup. 
---
Falling off the mill and shapeshifting into cat to ignore fall damage.
---
Waterform around the blacksmith.
---
Depending on your play Style, Druid has a lot to offer in 39 AB
---
Many people do not like totems. You will be fine. Raids need tons of shamans
---
Now I'm curious on what the agro range is on 60s
---
Not that it's going to affect his imminent but he seems OP for that zone 
---
I'm gonna keep that in mind! I remember waterform around the blacksmith actually, good times there.
---
A skull is more like it. 
---
The morladim issue is that he is the culmination quest NPC for the zone (30) and he is shoved in the same section as the starting quests (18-22).
---
To be honest it adds a nice layer of excitement. 
---
Was chillin just north of lakeshire and watched a *skull* level troll ride into town.
---
Thought to myself "I'll just grind some trash over this way for a bit..."
---
that's actually my favorite star wars scene :/
---
i raided as both and both have strengths and weaknesses. priest is probably easier but shaman more rewarding and harder to actually play well. if you like the idea of placing totems every pull then go shaman. if you like endless mana regeneration and getting whiny whispers from hunters for not buffing their pets go priest.
---
And you can LOS when you're in the water if the hills are in the way. Druids are uber fun in 39, I've even thought about halting my Druid there for a minute but it's my main 
---
Play a priest or pally healing is too much fun to pass up
---
No shit, i went back as a level 30 warlock. He 2 hit my voidwalker and slapped me with his undead dick
---
Wow Classic is now and Epic games Store exclusive
---
Yeah, just like I'm all for the legalization of Marijuana even tho I dont smoke and wouldnt even if it were legal. If it makes people happy and isn't hurting anyone, why not?
---
Do you know what a hyperbole is?
---
Sometimes darkshore can be pretty active too, you'll see lots of races go there to avoid westfall
---
Like the lore. I'm so excited to delve back into WC3 style lore again.
---
You're so write, that's my huge dilemma. Thanks for your input! 
---
The best thing about Cataclysm for me was when they gave Gnomes the Priest class!
---
I agree. I slept by my computer, set my alarm for every 2 hours to get in attempts, and either failing, or The Cleaner would show up. Was the most rewarding feeling when I finally got it. 
---
Imo its better to get the gold from selling the quest rewards and then just farm low level dungeons at 60 for greens, especially dungeons where it's possible to farm twink BoE's to sell.
---
What a long strange trip it's been.
---
19 Priest and Hunter
---
49 druid probably :)
---
&gt; (1) I was considering pushing end-game tanking as Dwarf warrior, however, do competitive guilds often prefer human warriors as MT based on the sword mastery racial? Among competitive players, is that racial often viewed as the most preferable for boosting tank DPS/threat and therefore raid DPS?
---
You misunderstood something here. Hardcore players generally prefer Humans for more threat, when they are in character select. A good guild will want to play with the best players regardless of their race choice however.
---
&gt; (2) My alternative scenario is to play a healer, specifically a priest or a paladin. It's not super important, but I do kinda like to play a less-common class. Were priests somewhat less common back in the day, or is that not the case. Can't remember at all.
---
Paladins who actually want to heal and strive to be good healers are probably rarer than Priests who do the same, even though their population might be higher. A lot of Paladins/Shamans are wannabe DPS/tanks in disguise.
---
If you want to be a true hipster you'd have to go with Druids likely.
---
Isnt it better as a tank to get hit, but for less, then to dodge an attack for rage generation?
---
Why would one wanna avoid deadmines? It's one of my favorite instances!
---
If I remember correctly they changed the way a lot of these attacks scaled midway through AQ. I was somewhat tuned into the PvP scene on my server and there was an Orc Hunter (I was a gnome rogue) who I knew who had put together a full spell power set was legit getting 2k arcane shots on me. 
---
Either him or level 60 horde killing me right as I res over and over for an hour 
---
Are you interested in pvp at all? Shamans pvp spec is more of a ele/retro hybrid where you are capable of burst dmg and off healing. Priest and paladin have specs that are more pure healing pvp.
---
I believe his lvl was nerfed after vanilla. Impossible to check now, of course. 
---
Its like a stone of jordan, but in staff form.
---
That's the joke.
---
Run out of mana stupid fast in 39 tho, but a couple lightning bolt crits for 800 damage is enough to put down anything.
---
Goblin Priest tho
---
I suggest you wait until the summer, when Classic rolls around.
---
I can’t say I’m well versed into the newest expansion (4/9HC this raid tier; combatant this season), but I wouldn’t recommend it since you might get burnt out on leveling
---
Horrible musik,  but nice editing.
---
They are definitely the best flag defense in AB, at both 29 and 39.
---
A good druid with proper gear can last minutes defending a flag even when its 4v1 just because of the mobility and survivability.
---
SLAM UM TONY 
---
I'm planning on resurrecting my Tauren Shaman. Going to find some old pics and see if I can match all the finer details as well.
---
I was a decent healer back in the day, but I was in 8 piece Earthfury. Wondering how much better I can be with mix &amp; match mail/leather/cloth BiS pieces.
---
I'm not you, so I can't really tell if it'll be fun for you. Just sub for that 1st month when it drops and see if you want to re-up by the end. 
---
I really hope WPvP vids see a resurgence with Classic. I know some people sort of kept the flame burning, hansol comes to mind.
---
Depends how much time you have to play and what kind of guild you are in. If you have friends or a guild I would level the warrior with them and play the hunter solo in off hours. At 60 it’s gonna take awhile to gear both, I’d have probably the warrior as main and keep hunter in blues/pre BiS. When you have progressed through a tier and your warrior is good, bring the hunter in on pug runs and play the hunter more, farming mats and gold for your progression runs on the warrior.
---
But if it was me I would just keep hunter as a 29 twink for pvp and main the warrior
---
You won't even see him coming. And if you did, you'd ve slamming reverse gear WAY less casually!
---
I was going to write something to this effect. He horror has stuck with me for 14 years...
---
Stitches roaming the path in Duskwood is an asshole too 
---
Yep. He is a normal mob now. Your pet can kill him.
---
I've played retail quite a bit but only have significant hours on DK and Demon Hunter, obvs both not options for Classic. Between those two I liked DK a lot and did not like DH much.
---
DK is a bit of an odd class but the things I liked about it were Blood was very self sufficient and even with mediocre gear could solo tank stuff you probably should not be able to with ease. Unholy also was sort of a weird rotation, but not very fiddly with timing or positioning and was just reliable steady damage thanks to DOTs. This was all from Warlords and Legion; I've not played BFA at all.
---
I wound up disappointed in DH and dumped it to go back to DK because I never could get the hang of the parkour rotation, and without that certain player skill its performance was very poor, and I always felt like I was putting in tons of effort trying to gear and play it for very mediocre returns.
---
For Classic, I guess the class that seems most appealing is Warlock because it gets some help from pets, has lots of DOTs, and also has both health and mana sustain for more self sufficiency and less downtime when solo (so I understand anyway). And the free class mount also seems like a nice perk.
---
I guess I'm also drawn to Druid as well which I've never played on retail, because I understand that if you learn to make the most of the forms it can be very capable on its own. It's also a "tank" class that can stealth, which is an unusual combination. Plus travel form seems nice.
---
I guess in a brand new game I usually would default to the most bog standard Human Fighter archetype that is available figuring it's the easiest to play and least fiddly by design, but my understanding of Warrior in Classic is that it can be kind of a downer for leveling and only really becomes amazing once you're super well geared way into the endgame, which is not appealing to me. It's also the only real option for raid tanks, but I have no desire to do that, so I feel like it would be a lot of work to never realize the rewards of the class.
---
Theres that dungeon in north west ashenvale though thats good too and near, forget the name.
---
it does
---
Now that I think more about it, you're right.  During Classic, there were rare occurrences where the weird connection you had to the target was literally stuck forever until you relogged to "break" it, but I definitely don't remember that ever happening in later years.  So that really sucks if it did happen then for you, sorry. :(
---
As someone mentioned above, he’s actually lvl 35 which makes it even more insane 
---
This might sound super dumb but without being able to turn off xp, how do you stay that level?
---
Shaman at later gear levels are essentially the best healers in Vanilla. So much so that Horde raids can run less healers total even for the brutal area damage fights that happen later on. Shaman are also usually under represented relative to demand, so finding spots in a raid guild is usually much easier. 
---
Warrior is above-averagely versatile and viable in end-game PvE and PvP. The issue is that the leveling is widely regarded as slow and painful due to being melee instead of ranged, having to sit and eat because you can't heal yourself with magic. 
---
On account of this, my first main will probably be a mage. Later on, once I'm established as a mage, I can not only pass along good lowbie gear to the warrior that I got while leveling or AoE farming, I can have something like Fiery Weapon put on the warrior's melee weapons to make leveling more smooth. Pave the way with a class capable of AoE or speed-farming, then #TREATYOURSELF on your warrior alt later. I don't advise trailblazing on a fresh server as a warrior before professions can be accessed, the auction house economy hasn't been established and so gold for repairs and your alt's mount aren't covered yet, etc.
---
Blizzard can make Fools jokes come real like pandas did...
---
Oh baby, mooove that body
---
Indeed! But I tend to pick the quest up at the grave when it’s available and spam for a group, which iirc is actually 29 but I am generally 30.
---
I like that idea actual! Yeah come classic I'll have a looot of free time lol.
---
Wow...so it's not sad enough living vicariously through online avatars, but now kids want to live vicariously through streamers living vicariously through online avatars?
---
This. Just login and play.
---
No AB in 29 right? It's been too long 
---
Main topic: "Release RP PvP servers please!"
---
Random reply: "why not just flag yourself on a regular RP server?"
---
Me (sarcastically): "why not just flag yourself on a PvE server?" (To highlight the the issue of the less than optimal suggestion above).
---
50-60hours/week get you maybe to r12, r14 is a whole different level.
---
I liked it a lot, though the way you pronounce Agamaggan makes me want to throw my laptop out my window.
---
Getting 60 and pre-BiS is the standard by which one ought to judge warrior's play style, not before you've even reached the halfway mark of exp to 60 and are still in leveling gear...
---
: /
---
I had the same question. I didn't think the ability to turn off XP was in Classic wow. I thought that came later in TBC.
---
Seal Fate by the looks of it, 31/8/12 or 31/12/8 with 5/8 Nightslayer bonus
---
Wow, thank you for that bad boy. 
---
Blackfathom Depths 
---
Real homies had the orc version anyway.
---
If i roll warrior 90% of my time will be spent in dungeons because it is more painful to lvl a warrior. It might be slower but you have people to play with ^.^
---
That’s when it came, you are right. Because BGs give you xp you have to level at some point 
---
Reading all these memories I can hear his armor clanging as I know.. I know without a shadow of a doubt I got to close and hes running toward me..
---
and
---
WHACK..
---
dead
---
No doubt, but my current personal life doesn't really afford to allow maining a Warrior. Too much time commitment required, no matter the pay off.
---
So then......twinking is out of the question, yes? 
---
Bg's didnt give xp back then :) so if you stayed in the capitals not killing anything you never leveled. Be carefull with exploration though, you wouldnt be the first to ding on getting to a new zone and nobody likes a decked lvl 20 twink :p
---
Do you have a link? I'm bored of doing arms leveling for the 5th time so I wanted to give it a look.
---
If I remember right,  you don't get XP from pvp in classic.  As long as you longer kill mobs or complete quests, you are good.
---
Yeah, since the main city was Ironforge. I think Goldshire became the default place for dueling and such from TBC and onwards.
---
Was Kharanos ever a place to hang? I don't think so, not outside Brewfest.
---
That dwarf looks more like ewok to me
---
Also its in fucking Darkshore haha
---
That's like saying everyone should play on high settings. Because my view distance causes me to see more, and I want to play like anyone else. You get the point. And even if it isn't a toggle, people will still find a way to do it, so you'd play different game without you knowing it?
---
No exp for PvP kills in vanilla. So if you only PvP you don't level. 
---
The trick is getting all your gear before or at your think level. If you really want some dungeon gear and your haven't got it at 19.5 you gotta weigh up if doing the dungeon again to get the drop is worth the risk of maybe leveling. 
---
I think the screenshot have been of that rat-resist, actually :D
---
Human warrior.. and I was a god
---
This is the cost of #nochanges. Everything else is the same, but Classic WoW has ewoks instead of dwarves.
---
Ofc, why not? Their super OP and have tons of utility
---
Yeah I mean I think the 39 twink is viable but 19, and maybe 29 doesn't seem doable. It seems you'll just level past it before you get all the twink gear. 
---
I wonder how many are coming back to wow classic thinking... This time I'm going to raid. And to gauruntee a spot they are going priest. 
---
Maybe I'm crazy tho and dont get it. 
---
Damn dude. This brought back some serious nostalgia. I used to have a bunch of photos from back in the day too, but I lost almost all of them, all I have left are a couple from post-vanilla days. 
---
Don't have to sit and drink so much when there's a healer incidentally topping you off, and won't it take a few runs to get that loose set from the Scarlet Monastery, anyhow? May as well run it a ton between 33-40 instead of getting fucked on in Stranglethorn Vale quite the entire time...
---
That makes sense. I wasn't thinking about how far into the tree the reduced cast time for lightning is. Maybe I can gather "of the Gorilla" items to increase both str and int so I can use a fair amount of shocks prior to smashing with a weapon.
---
Or maybe I should just resign myself to enhancement until I can get to 40. 
---
Looking at private servers, there are still a ton of max level hunters, even though hunters are some of the least brought class to raids. There are still a ton of Night Elves, which outside of Shadowmeld Mind Control are the "worst" at pretty much every class they can be. I am willing to bet on classic release even more people are going to roll the fun or appealing combinations over the optimal ones than on private servers (which can sort of be seen from the OSRS mobile release, the newer players essentially brought the value up of a ton of fashion items that had dropped to the essentially vendor value).
---
Now I think they will be fine for a while, the problems will probably start arising later on down the line but I would guess it would be over 3 years before they start happening (which by then I will guess at least new itemization gear will have come out). Overall, we won't really know until whatever happens, happens though, and I think a lot of it will bank on what the larger streamers/youtubers support. People go to streamers for a ton of questions, and just like the official forums and Reddit, it can quickly become an echo chamber for better or worse.
---
Then you start a new character. Half the fun is trying to get your gear at the right level. 
---
Yeah but the min level for that is around 25 whereas deadmines min level is about 17, so there isn't really any overlap there. I could go through westfall and then move over to Ashenvale later if I really wanted to hit up BFD.
---
19 druid for sure and a shaman for either 39 or 49. 
---
Most people have a primary and a secondary. Anything else is just wasted time really.  If you get the secondary to 60 and a 100% mount you'll beat my expectations of how far you'll make it honestly.
---
The 49 bracket was insanely fun, but in the Burning Crusade. Not only could my 70 dual-box me through the proper instances significantly easier, but T.B.C. enchants were permissible on the gear, right? Could run everything from Mongoose to Executioner, couldn't we? Not only the professions, the mounts, mail/plate upgrades from leather/mail, but the enchants and the ease of creation were the sweet spot, for me. I quit partly through Wrath of the Lich King, a few short weeks after they killed twink'ing with battleground experience points.
---
There were several factors, one being I originally thought rogue would be more fun but my friend wanted to play rogue, so I went with something else. I've always loved pet classes so I chose a pet class. Little did I know that eventually only marksman would be considered viable, and I fucking hate marksman. Aimed shot is one of my least favorite abilities in the entire game, and it turns your pet into a little bitch. I just wanted to enrage King B and watch him eat casters.
---
I also really enjoy leveling, especially in vanilla. I like to play and know every class so that I can PvP with and against them better. So leveling a new character really wasn't a big deal. We didn't have a guild or know anything about raiding so it's not like I even realized I was missing out on anything. I was 13 and didn't pay as much attention to that stuff because I couldn't commit to a regular raid schedule anyway when I had school and multiple sports every day. Just wanted to dominate PvP and do some dungeons and see some cool stuff. Rogue is just a class that always seemed incredibly fun with stealth and pickpocketing, no mana requiring drinking, and a sweet sweet spammable high damage attack. 
---
Meh. I don't have it in me to have a bazillion characters this time around. I just don't have that kind of attention span anymore. I'm going to aim for 2 max level Raiders, and 2 twinks and that's probably it for me. So I'll probably aim for level 39 twinkage.
---
Looting changed to master looter 👀
---
It wasn't just that it was that soj hit almost as hard as pod. 
---
It's a little like murdering children.
---
Busm is also there in some of the MC raids, he was with me all the way to wotlk. 
---
Bagjo rerolled.
---
Those two guys are my best friends today &lt;3
---
This can be done but I believe the main problem is controls. I think remote desktop is what people use to do it.
---
The Nost teams visit to Blizzard HQ also had an effect if you are to believe interviews with attendees of that meeting.
---
No I don't find it fun being completely. Overpowered compared to everyone else. That's what noobs do. 
---
Controls would suck, but I think turning on click-to-move just for some grinding wouldn't be too bad as long as I get to the grinding spot before I leave for work. It would basically just be like playing runescape. For a class like Hunter, I probably won't even really have to click my abilities. Just click a mob and they're usually dead, especially if I grind on mobs a couple levels below me.
---
Nicee
---
MSA is powerful AF though due to the proc being "Equip" rather than the usual "Chance on hit". The difference being that "Equip" makes the item work as a trinket rather than a weapon, basically you can have MSA in your OH but you will still trigger procs with your MH swing (no matter what weapon you have in your MH). I never quite understood the reasoning for blizzard to make only this weapon have an "Equip" proc rather than "chance on hit" that every other proc weapon has.
---
Was about to say that.
---
I think it right clicking is usually the problem. I’d love to be able to fish from my phone
---
Not only does Alliance have pretty races, they also have pretty zones. Darkshore, Teldrasil, Elwynn, Ashenvale(although also a horde zone). 
---
From what you're describing, I think you'd definitely enjoy a warlock. They're very self-sufficient in that they can dish out a lot of damage and have a built-in tank to help out if you want to deal with tougher enemies. They have options for demons, so their pet is more flexible than a hunter's (in general, imp for non-tanky DPS in groups, voidwalker for tanky solo, succubus for PvP ... and one or two others). If you keep up your first aid skill (which every class should do, even healers) then your downtime will be very low with health tap + bandage. They can group and solo well and they're good in raids if you ever decide to do that. They're involved enough that you can do some theorycrafting and min-maxing if you're into that, but there are enough guides out there for pretty straight-forward playstyles as well. Consider tailoring as Robe of the Void will last a while and it's BOP.
---
Druid is also a lot of fun. They're a true hybrid, so they can be specced to do anything, though they aren't really the masters of anything. That only matters in a raid environment and, really, not even that much unless the group you're in is pushing new content or aiming for server first records. Feral is a great spec for DPS, tanking, or PvP. Resto is a good healer and is the defacto druid raid spec, though a bear off-tank can work. Moonkin can DPS in dungeons and do fairly well in PvP if used along with the rest of the druid bag-of-tricks, but it's one of the few specs in the game that would have a hard time getting into raids. 
---
Warriors always looked boring to me, so I never tried one. They're the default raid tanks because they have the threat / survival tools to do it well and because the tanking gear is oriented toward them. If you decide to roll one, then consider pairing up with someone to quest / grind mobs (just ask around in general chat, if nothing else you might find someone with a healing spec who would love to pair up to decrease kill times of mobs). Also be aware that repair costs are worst for plate wearing tanks. 
---
Sounds like you might want to watch a few youtube videos about classic warlocks to see if they're what you think you want.
---
If the fight includes an execute phase, you better believe it fam!
---
I had alt fever and went night elf warrior first, night elf druid second, and gnome mage third. All three were in a smattering of late-game blues, and I forget if my main warrior even had a purple or two from getting picked up by random raiders or not. I spent most of my gold, which I did a solid enough job earning, on lowbie twinks. I was for sure going the quantity over quality route. I imagine a main and an alt, each with different roles/professions/etc. is the way to go for quality, but no more, if the goal is getting decked out.
---
If you see it as a problem if players orchestrate that they themselves are banned, sure.
---
Noticing a distinct lack of consumables there... was it the fact that it wasn’t actually necessary to have every conceivable buff or was it just the standard vanilla UI didn’t display them all?
---
Do you really have to right click if you're just grinding or fishing? Just put auto attack on your bar and click an enemy and click autoattack. It's a little more clunky but it's doable I think.
---
Ye? Then go test vs high and low shadow resistance targets and tell me
---
A mix between 2 and 3 seems good. However I wouldn't let a player of my faction die in a PvP fight and I'd help him instead, which sounds a bit unfair but a horde death is better than an alliance death. Plus the player is most likely going to be thankful to you and it creates interaction. Thank you for the advice :)
---
For attacking you would be okay, but you couldn’t loot without right click, and you couldn’t click the bobber without right click (atleast I think, maybe I’ve just always right clicked without having to)
---
You forgot spirit. You regen mana whilst in forms so with enough spirit you don't need as much int. 
---
Once I'm convinced of a solid release date, I'm going to put up recruiting posters on the community board at my job, at the local board game shop, etc., as well as make posts on both this sub-Reddit and my city-specific sub-Reddit (Wilmington, N.C., U.S.A.) in order to gain traction. I plan to re-boot my old casual leveling guild with new faces. As someone who came into vanilla a year past launch, I revel the excitement of being one of the first guilds on a fresh server, all of us requesting one another's help for quests, trading professions and making potions/equipment/enchantments for one another, answering potential questions, and doing instances together.
---
If only they ele/enh were viable outside of PvP.
---
That makes a lot of sense now. I couldn’t imagine how stressful that would be to not be able to go anywhere
---
Iirc there are/have been several Scarlet Crusade themed guilds on Wyrmrest Accord, so that kinda thing isn’t unheard of
---
I never understood why Druid/Warrior isn't named as a good duo set up for leveling. 
---
In general heals on a warrior should be enough to consider it, right? Additional you have the advantage of the heals from the druid which don't disrupt rage generation (unlike power word shield).
---
Damn. All four laptops and both desktops in my house have one.
---
You can tank 5-mans as pally warrior and druid, though the pally is probably the weakest of the three overall as they tend to go OOM quickly. That said, they excel at tanking undead 5-mans (Strat and Scholo anyone?) and can offtank trash in raids in a pinch. Druid would be a good second choice; an appropiately geared pre-bis druid is arguably a better option for main tanking up through MC, until warriors start to accumulate significant amounts of tier 1+ gear. After that point, druids can offtank most any fight and still main tank some fights even through AQ40. I have also heard of druids helping tank the Four Horsemen in Naxx. Warriors are your bread and butter tank class; they can main tank anything and do it well. If you really want to focus on tanking and mastery of the role, pick warrior.
---
If you want backup plans, druids can also DPS (a tryhard feral can be middle of the pack DPS and a super tryhard can be top 5 or greater through BWL) and heal (they tend to be considered the weakest of the healing classes but again, tryhards can shift this narrative. Paladins are mostly valued for the buffs and heals; the ret paladin can do damage, but not as much as an equally tryhard feral druid would, and they (ret pallies) also absorb gear that would otherwise be given to fury warriors, arguably the master class DPS of the game. So I wouldn't expect to get much consideration or gear as a ret pally unless you are established in a guild already. Plan to heal. As I just mentioned, if you roll warrior and decide *not* to tank, you can always DPS as fury warrior, which have some of the highest DPS parses of any class once they get a significant amount of T2 / rank 13-14 gear.
---
Amen bro. I kinda like reading the guides but I am going to roll my own build anyway.
---
Shredding a guitar
---
Personally the idea of starting a Dwarf/Gnomr only guild called Dun Morogh Defense Force (or something to that effect) is something I am very much considering.  
---
Although you did mention more of an RP/Economics kinda thing. Not too sure of how well that could work out if the plan is to try to enforce it on others though, but maybe some kind Traders/Merchant guild kind of thing with regular informal in-person market day events could be popular.
---
I'm really tempted to be the priest to a friend's warlock. 
---
I realize that we're both clothies, but if I snatched all of the healing+/spirit/mp5sec gear while they grabbed all of the spell+/stamina/spell crit/spell hit gear, the wipe/gank prevention of warlock soulstone'ing a priest who can rez just sounds so appealing...
---
Mc, ony, believe can be cleared in one raid night with a proficient group. 
---
You should focus on gearing the first character before you start leveling a second one. After you've got preraid bis gear on your first character you can pretty much just raid log and keep leveling the alt to 60.
---
I'm with Falceon in that to argue that a fury warrior is selfish for not being prot is a slippery slope where one is a logic step or two away from the conclusion that any non-warrior is selfish for being something other than a warrior because they're not "fulfill[ing] a need that [one] could...fulfill."
---
To some, "waiting longer for groups on the average" is a worthwhile trade-off for getting the job they actually want.
---
TL;DR:
---
I would assess the situation first and then go from there.
---
\---
---
In my opinion, everyone is considered fair game.  Ultimately, it will all depend on the situation you are in at the time and what kind of person you are.
---
This is my general approach to world PvP:
---
Usually, if they're not worth any honor then I won't waste my time ganking them.  I like a challenge and ganking players that much lower than you is boring in my opinion.  If I'm in a really, really sour mood...I just may have a change of heart and gank regardless.
---
While I'm questing and going from point A to point B, if I see an enemy player I'll assess the situation first.  Depending on what my goals are at the moment, I may or may not engage...sometimes I may not even have a choice.
---
If I feel like being nice, I won't engage; I may even help the enemy player.  While I'm questing, if I feel like it may benefit me to not engage, I'll leave the player alone.  If I don't think it's a favorable match up, I may keep on moving.  If there's a group and I don't stand a chance, then obviously I won't bother to engage.
---
If I've encountered the player before and they're on my shit-list, I'll engage and kill-on-sight.  Some times, depending on the player, I'll even take it a step further and corpse camp - grieving the player until they either leave the zone, log off, or bring in reinforcements.  If I just want to PvP and want a challenge,  I'll engage.  If I just feel like being a prick, I'll engage.  Sometimes I will even toy with the enemy player...engage, disengage, rinse and repeat.  Sometimes I'll find the enemy player, that I left alone, trying to gank me; so I'll reciprocate in kind.
---
If a group of enemy players is ganking another player, I'll usually jump right in and try to help if I think I can help.  If the enemy group is going on a ganking spree, I'll usually try to group up with the other players to try and even the odds. 
---
Then there will be plenty of times where I'm the one being ganked and there's nothing I can do about it.  There will be times when the enemy player sees me and leaves me alone to my own devices.  There have been times where I've encountered those same players on multiple occasions and then, out of the blue, that same player will engage me for whatever reason.
---
More often than not, you just never know what to expect.  It's why world PvP is so thrilling in my opinion.
---
I think Westfall and Redridge 
---
Yeah - lots of those for sure. 
---
Fuckin' got 'em dude.
---
Sorry I dont.I post to reddit using smoke signals
---
Go dwarf priest. You'll still get the semi-halfling short person experience while also playing what is widely regarded as one of the best race/class combos out there. There is pretty much zero argument to be made against the ultimately utility of dwarf priests in Classic.
---
It ends up being the casual guilds raiding 3-4 times a week and the hardcore guilds raid one night a week (not including 20mans and the occasional onyxia)
---
Your ears don't work.
---
I feel like they have it all, free food and water, fast mobility with blink and teleports, tier 1 damage, amazing kiting, high skill ceilling, one of the best pvp classes, great aoe farming for exp and gold i just feel like theyre leagues above everything else so obviously mage is what im going with for sure
---
Go Holy, put one talent point in Holy Nova, and farm the lashers at the bottom of DME as soon as you have ~6k mana or 5.5k with PI. It's honestly brainless and free money. Priests also have a good amount of CC for NPCs (fear, shackle undead, mind soothe (for humanoids) so I find it really easy as an herbalist to run around high level zones like Eastern Plaguelands and farm plaguebloom/dreamfoil/mountain silversage there -- all three of which are used in consumables in very high demand at 60. Idk what the black lotus situation will wind up being like in classic, but for the reasons I just listed priest is a pretty ideal class to farm those, too.
---
No I mean from lvl 10 and up.
---
I mean apart from hunter no one will wear tier sets. And vanilla rotations are all boring, so i dont care about the 1 button spam honestly.
---
Only losers do that shit. Don't be a loser.

I do absolutely the same or one of us is going to sleep with the fish.
---
Most androids you can plug a mouse into.. so if you can get it to work you can do some clicking but maybe not movement.
---
I think you could loot and fish without right click, but honestly it's been so long I don't even remember. I'm sure there is probably a way to right click on a phone somehow, nowadays.
---
Hell, now that I think about it, I could probably just get a bluetooth keyboard with a touchpad...
---
Why would i need to proof anything here, its MY estimation, based on seeing a lot of launches. Might as well ask you the proof that it ISNT true ?
---
Is there a YouTube video of this? 
---
mod who put that flair: relax. 
---
&gt; So no matter where you go, unless you're ahead of everyone else, there will be people.
---
Depends on the server population and how much time you have to spend at launch. Kinda the point that there will be people, in a MMO...
---
[Ferahgo](https://youtu.be/0DA4x9XWz_A) was godly. 
---
[Rubix](https://youtu.be/DMHufkFUWwU) was another good one I remember from back in the day. 
---
[Nerf Druids](https://youtu.be/xlXOnYi5tAU) and [Swiftmender](https://youtu.be/Mq2I0YyNWuA) series were good. 
---
Click to move :)
---
I think with pretty much any DPS pally build you want as slow a weapon as possible -- which means massive 2H. You might situationally pull out the sword and board if you are trying to aoe consecrate some mobs.
---
You can wand anyone, ranged or melee, so long as they are in front of you.
---
You could also ask innkeepers to set up groups somehow, I think.
---
lmao between that and stitches coming up on you when your walking up and down the path from the cemetery and darkshire
---
Fuck no. You should be leveling at least the rested xp, doesnt take long ... and its super effective. Helps to have some other activities than running that one dungeon 50 times for that one drop.
---
I even remember how it got on 1 in the first place. After getting first level of KS i realized that it was useless to have a dedicated button for "attack", which was default and so it got on 1 button. I also used to have gouge on 4, where slice and dice is on this pic, and swap their places when not raiding. 
---
Not during the progression.
---
I remember we had a tic tac toe addon, and other useless game addons, while waiting for healers to resurrect and buff lol
---
We don't run with spriest; I do play a tri-spec holy weaving build (14/17/20 in disc/holy/shadow) where I apply the shadow weaving debuff to the target, keep it up by casting some shadow spell every 10 or so seconds, and heal in between. 
---
I know most of the other guilds on the server do have a token spriest, so you *can* be that guy -- it's just harder than normal.
---
What is PoD?
---
Clicking carrot on the carrot on a stick, bloodfang gloves with +mount speed enchant (also had immune to disarm when needed) and some shoes with mithril spurs while summoning your mount was an important part of the vanilla experience. 
---
Not sure if there is such guilds out there, most are aiming for 2 raids / week. Because it makes sense regarding the raid lockout rotations.
---
But you could try to get into PUG raids that ppl will host. If you have \~preraid bis items, doing stuff like weekly MC shouldnt be that hard to get into.
---
I can vouch, at least in a local network for Steam in-home Streaming, Which i've used to play wow elsewhere, and they've expanded it to do Stream Anywhere ([instructions](https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/3362406825533023360/)) as long as your internet upload speed at home is good, and your download on your phone is fine. If you've got an android phone I believe it works through the [Steam Link App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink&amp;hl=en_AU).

Yes.

If I was organizing a casual raiding guild I would actually look to have two raid/dungeon events per week and focus mostly on 5mans and later 20mans, while slowly but steadily catching up on the 40mans as long as there are enough people online who are equipped to do so.
---
For casual guilds there is absolutely no need to rush through T1/T2 because of catchup dungoens/raids: DM/ZG/AQ20. Your progression stops at T2/AQ20/ZG if you play casually anyways.
---
Lol, what other way is there to pronounce it? 
---
First phase of Kel'Thuzad was rather unconsistent. As stated in an other thread, I would lie slightly below the other rogues in pure DPS fights, such as Patchwerk. I was on hemo duty due to mace specc and 4 piece set bonus with Bonescythe armor. 
---
Or Sons of Arugal in Silverpine \*shiver\*

Would I have to run WoW through steam or can steam anywhere stream any game to to my phone remotely?
---
Wow + phone...
---
Please dont those 2 words in a same sentence...
---
Fuck em when theyre alive. Fuck em when theyre dead. 
---
Then you use consume corpse like none of it ever happened. 
---
You'd have to add the WoW executable to steam as a shortcut. 
---
Is this from the same era? That editing is amazing
---
The same reason players roll on a PvP servers instead of a PvP server applies for RP players as well. The competition, thrill and it's obviously wierd as shit if a Paladin can't kill an Undead because he's not flagged for PvP.
---
Priests, rogues and (tank) warriors would like to have a word with this statement. They all look awesome. 
---
Also it's not like rogues or hunters for example have a hard rotation, at all, but it's still way more exciting than casting frostbolt over and over. All a matter of opinion though, if you're excited for a mage, go for it. They're still very good farmers and taxis/catering services ;) (also I want you to know that I'm not hating on mages because I *want* to - I've mained one for multiple expansions post wotlk and I loved it, I'm actually sad that they don't seem to attract me that much in Vanilla)
---
My character coming back from the dead is the opposite of immersion.
---
I can generally handle the deaths in PvE because they're usually relatively rare.  (Though deleting characters because they died in PvE is something I do from time to time.  I'm roleplaying that they died.)  If I played on a PvP server, I'd be deleting characters on a regular basis.
---
I'm not going to waste my time leveling characters up to maybe level 30 and deleting them over and over.
---
I don't think victory rush healed in Wrath did it? I just leveled a warrior from 1 to 64 in wrath and victory rush didn't heal. So that's either a glyph/talent or it came in Cata.
---
Stitches!! 
---
I love how your succubus is named Bronanda.
---
 FOOL! YOU ALLOWED THESE INSECTS TO RUN RAMPANT THROUGH THE HALLOWED CORE? AND NOW YOU LEAD THEM TO MY VERY LAIR? YOU HAVE FAILED ME, EXECUTUS! JUSTICE SHALL BE MET, INDEED!
---
***kills Executus with Elemental Fire, instantly killing him and empowering himself.***  
---
 
---
Will I be able to do that even though we'll have to run Classic through the launcher? Or is there an executable that will allow me to play the game without opening the launcher?
---
Top dps with emo spec heh? Unexpected!
---
Why not? It's not like I'm asking for a mobile version of WoW..
---
Its your world, your advanture, be who you want to be.
---
Personally I ( try to ) kill everyone I see atleast once. When I'm questing at an area where there is also an Alliance I keep killing him untill my quest is done.
---
I dont camp honorless targets, but when I see one I kill them once. I do go out of my way to kill them when I see one.
---
If its anything like current retail wow thre will be an executable in the main directory that by-passes the launcher. You have to log-in with your bnet username/password on the login screen, instead of just being automatically signed in to character select, but its there. 
---
I never looked at the swing speed. Holy moly, 3.7 and shamans can wear them by default without learning 2h spec. 
---
This indeed looks quite powerful.
---
You call it honorable to wait untill he is out of combat, I call it a missed oppertunity to let him die by it so he has repair costs.
---
Thanks! This saves me the time I was going to spend doing it myself. I’m going to complete all possible quests that I can (as level appropriate as possible) on my warrior. This’ll help a great deal!
---
Woah awesome! I'll have to try this out sometime. Thank you for the info!
---
I felt especially dumb when I was mindlessly killing the non-elite mobs that look exactly the same and I attack a Son of Arugal and wondered why I was deleted for a moment.
---
My friend actually did this in uni. We would sit together in class as he played his rogue in STV on his HP palmpilot type device with LogMeIn on. I think he could pretty much only run around and press tiny buttons with the stylus, but it was amazing to watch. 
---
Do you have some more of those gems?
---
Cool cherrypicked crit compilation
---
Yeah I think thats te problem. At the end, your character progression requies you to PvP or PvE. No other path has enough content to make you feel an accomplished player if you focus only on that. In EVE you spend years researching mining ships, learning the best set of skills to be a very efficient miner, you can earn a hell of a lot of money by being good in what you are doing, there is nothing in WoW that comes close in terms of professions. So I dont hink many would organise their game time around being the best tailors on the server and ruling the market. 
---
No play warrior
---
Such as botters roaming around screwing the economy.  Bastards.
---
Armor damage reduction is more reliable than dodge and increase your EH. And the damage reduction is higher (if i remember right, it's about 1.5% at 70% dr which is about 5% actual damage reduction).
---
Dps trinket is only a slight increase in tps and don't change that much, usually as a druid you don't even need to focus on tps and if you need you just equip a pummeller.
---
Sure if you only tank MC, it doesn't really matter but the difference is quite huge in higher raid.
---
I'm surprised that you attacked it - usually their aggro range is so huge for appropriately leveled characters int he zone that suddenly one will just be *on you* and you have a few moments of panic before your corpse run. 
---
Then your memory is tricking you :) Early parts on Sunwell you'll most likely were specced Survival and that was far from a one button thing :D
---
MM only got better once you had acquired about half the gear from Sunwell again.
---
And anyhow, none of the speccs were one button things :D Compared to other classes hunter had super fun priority rotations ever since... Since you were in Sunwell, you probably knew how to play so things felt natural and easy to you, but really, they weren't ;)
---
Why not? Do you guys not have phones?!
---
no such thing as steady shot spam for max dps
---
I like both version, but I’m not going to pretend they’re even the same game anymore.  One does not reflect the other.
---
No need to. I will be raiding as resto. And I have a dedicated group of friends for both pve/pvp. :)
---
I am loving these videos and this stokes the Classic flame more than anything! Understanding the history and stories of the WoW universe makes every quest and activity mean so much more.

Not as I remember. Everyone just jumped into lagforge and chatted with their 12fps

You pushed the button to look through the eyes of a dying 90 year old and the button that makes you 20 again doesn't look good anymore? No computo, mi amigo. 
---
I first walked into Duskwood at like 1am in early 2005. I had my headphones on. Was legitimately terrified
---
Loging into bfa and now crying like a 5 year old on a mount? Well grow up 🙄
---
Why would classic be like bfa!? Have you read any of the news...?
---
It's not going to be anything like BfA! Tried playing all the last addons and they all suck for a lot of reasons. The only things I'm worrying about, just as you said, are animations. As much as like enhancing graphics, I feel like the new animations fall out of the warcraft style. They are super weird.
---
However, graphics is not the main part of the game. And all the gameplay features of classic will be there in WoW: Classic.
---
hunter, probably. marksman, cause range.
---
Well I was a healing shaman and am going priest, but not to guarantee a raid spot...just to be a better healer. :P  
---
So you might not be crazy, but I doubt a *lot* of people are doing it. 
---
I did play a hunter when I switched to horde. Good catch!
---
Snarf, we gotta loot the core hound, snarf snarf.
---
8/8 t1 is actually pretty good if youre tank-healing, until you have access (if ever) to t3. This will be my personal goal for classic: To rock full earthfury as an orc shaman. 
---
I played on a RPPVP server back during vanilla-- Emerald Dream. We had some fun world PVP action that's for sure. And I (mostly) avoided Goldshire hehe. 
---
This is BS no changes!!!
---
JK that is fine by me lol
---
Ah; of course. Should have thought of that. 
---
No play holy warrior
---
Wow boring.... 
---
It seems I would need a /s in my post.

Same for me! I logged on during the free weekend too. What killed it for me was someone riding a motorcycle in the valley of trials.... wtf

High school is all about popularity. There's a reason teenagers are obsessed with the latest craze, what's "in", or the trends set by others. It's because not only are they struggling with forming their own identities, but they're also facing the social equivalent of Stranglethorn Vale. For teenagers, socialising is a no-holds-barred jungle filled with traps and pitfalls for the unwary individual. 
---
In such conditions, having your group of friends is essential. Your group helps define your identity, but also provides protection. It helps you blend in and avoid being ostracised or singled out as being different. You don't want to be the teen who doesn't know what the big thing currently happening is, because you risk exclusion and ridicule by other teens who will seize any moment of weakness in order to distract others from scrutinising them. 
---
Streamers, for better or for worse, do define to a large extent what's popular and what isn't, when it comes to video games. Teens watch these streams and don't want to be the kid at school who isn't playing the next big game, because that's a sure fire pathway to exclusion from the social hierarchy. So they check out that game the streamer is playing, which is why when  streamers began to move from Pubg to Fortnite, I saw a distinct shift in the conversations at lunchtimes amongst students switching in turn. 
---
So it's not so much that teens today are any different. They're not. They just want to survive the perils of social interaction. 
---
Thanks for the answer. Do you disagree with me that they are very "gooey" then? Or do the higher level of detail make up for it and still make them preferable to you?
---
leveling just takes forever , if you are on to level you sort of want to level not pvp. its not really mentality its just part of the game , like you want to get whatever zone you are in done asap
---
low level pvp is actually rather fun because its less about gear but personally i never went out of my way looking for it, from time to time fun things do happen like you own a dude but he often comes back over and over to interrupt your questing. 
---
i spent most of my time on pve servers but ive played pvp, its fine ill prob go pvp for classic. like pvp is a huge part of vanilla , i played a lot of battlegrounds and not having the option to really world pvp is a bit of a down side
---
They NEED to add this at release. Adding it later means nothing because it'll be dead on arrival since hardly anyone would want to re roll after putting in work much work on their main elsewhere. 
---
Just one rpPvP server is all we ask :(

woyer
---
Does that mean a non-tauren hunter can be in the taurens deadzone but the tauren wont be in his?
---
IIRC there was a macro you could use to dismiss them easier. Or hell, an addon maybe. With my adventures through p. Servers, folks were still making addons. So im sure there will be an addon to simplify this, somewhere down the line.
---
Im saying go shaman. So much more rewarding . 
---
What is any of this
---
In higher raids i'd take a drake fang talisman over almost any other trinket as a bear tank.
---
You can't use a pummeler every single pull either.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad trinket, i'm just saying that it's not nearly as good as people say it is. I know people take these BiS guides as gospel, and think that if you don't get every single piece of gear on there you're just harming yourself.
---
I've tanked as a feral for the past like 3 years, and in my experience dps trinkets are just as good - i don't tend to die through healing unless something major fucks up. And in higher raids you're gonna be above the armor cap a lot of the time anyways.
---
Guy he said wow mobile get him!
---
You're pronouncing it Agga maggan, but its more like Ah Gomma Gone when Ramtusk says it in game.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
Now *this* is quality content.
---
There won't be any class changes. We are playing 1.12 classes all the way through.
---
Yes, people who are serious raiding minmaxers will tend to roll the exceptional classes, but the problem will self-regulate to a degree when supply outpaces demand.
---
Good. I wish they'd get rid of Boss Mod too. 
---
you don't avoid it, you level in darkshore from 12-17/18 and then go to westfall and do the deadmines quests. 
---
A pally that actually wants to heal instead of being forced to is a plus as well.
---
Dire Maul East
---
Tailoring/enchanting for sure. You'll want tailoring through ZG for Bloodvine.
---
That seems like a lot of travel for a non-NE for what amounts to a day or two of leveling.
---
You really should. As said, you'll be playing it the way you want anyway. Dump mana on spells then melee.
---
Thia guy was the bane of leveling....
---
Ganklethorn vale
---
Sorry but that's a huge waste of time and money for MC and BWL. Sure you can min/max like crazy and use all this stuff but for what? Faceroll bosses? When everyone is doing their job right you will never be in need for mana pots. From AQ40 onwards yes. But not for MC and BWL. Did you ever play Vanilla? Not that privat server bullshit. Real Vanilla. Literally nobody used these kind of stuff back then. I see why you may want to use buff food and pots as a dd but definitely not as a healer.
---
You should totally subscribe to: https://old.reddit.com/r/klassiskwow/

---
Does this work in classic tho ? Can you get starter quests from different starting area ?
---
Westfall equivalent of Barrens chat - “anyone seen the messenger?” “I shot him” *titter titter* 
---
Check out Kargoz's recent stream. He goes over every individual class and gives a realistic overview and expectations of them to help you decide on a character. It's a long watch but well worth it. It's even worth it if you know what you wanna roll in order to at least familiarize yourself with the other classes.
---
https://youtu.be/qCPEjQJxb3M

Had an alt in the cave for a long time. Logging in once in a while to see if something was there. 
---
My hope is that classic will break the FRESH hype a little bit that happens every time a ps gets to about aq patch. There will always be guilds that are clearing as fast as they can, but it would be great for the health of the servers if there are those that chug along at their own pace. It would keep the servers active post naxx and allow late comers to get picked up. If you can get a guild of people on board with one day raiding and can keep numbers and moral up it shouldn't be a problem until naxx. It would help if they had an optional night where they pugged older content or ran with alts just to keep things active, which is more important to the health of the guild. 
---
It was a macro that used steady shot without interrupting auto shots. Not quite sure when it was in, but it was definitely a thing at the time. 
---
it worked in vanilla. i went to durotar with my ud priest.
---
You couldn't get this on retail. It was only available from the hakkari urn, which is a quest reward from ST. The reason you see them on loot tables are because its private server data is messed up. 100% guarantee this won't be available in classic.
---
I had a 19 Hunter and sometime during BC they removed the level requirement for professions for about two weeks. During that time I had my friends help kill the level 63ish beasts in Terrokar to get my skinning up. That's back when skinning gave the crit bonus. Hunter had over 80% crit unbuffed it was insane, lol
---
[You're wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)

I accomplished this exact thing by using the Remotr program. It's a remote desktop program but it works really well if you have good internet, almost no lag at all and the quality is okay!
---
I set up touchscreen binds to play, it's vanilla so the amount of buttons you need to press to kill stuff aren't that many.

EU players don't dislike Russians because they're Russians, just to state that. But from our perspective Russians show up with names in Cyrillic which few in EU can read, they read and write only Russian and tend to not really act like team players in most games.
---
And if you take that into Classic, which is a very community focused game you essentially create a mini faction within a faction since the barriers you have for Horde vs Alliance is almost the same as the Russian community within Horde vs rest of Horde.
---
Based on what you write above I don't think I would have any problems getting along with you just fine. But based on my gaming experience you don't represent the bulk of the Russian community in that regard :).
---
Good one Blizzard
---
Ya but dat dps doe
---
No it won't look like BfA.

Its all part of the adventure, plus I prefer the darkshore leveling experience to the westfall, loch modan, redridge path.

No I just advance in a different direction
---
That's wrong. Battlegrounds granted no experience in both Vanilla and TBC. Then in WotLK they introduced XP rewards for completing BG objectives, and around the middle of the expansion also added the XP Eliminator NPC that allowed you to disable XP gain completely, but doing so would place you in a separate battleground bracket.
---
In classic you'll be able to remain at the same level forever and do as many battlegrounds as you want, as long as you don't kill any mobs or complete quests. 
---
I think the updated graphics toggle might incorporate the new animations but I am not sure, I don't think it's been confirmed though. What we know so far is we will have new/old graphics using old animations.
---
Have I got a deal for you!
---
A guild of all Humans vs a guild of all Orcs. And a legion of warlocks summoning infernals to let loose upon the first two groups to re-enact the Warcraft scene we all know and love.
---
Hemo raiding?
---
Old animations and old models, there was no option to toggle the new ones in the Classic demo, and fortunately the models still used the old animations.
---
The bigliest
---
I'm sorry but why even bother asking such a pointless question. It has as many answers and people you ask it to...
---
So humans will run the same way they ran in Classic???
---
Holy shit thank god. 
---
Did u run the same spec for pvp?
---
New animations suck ass. It would look so jarring in a vanilla setting too.
---
I'm almost certain they will use old animations.
---
More addons means more dps
---
It is known
---
Woah thats awesome! Is it easy to set up?
---
F
---
In practice u look like a hobo
---
Im more then sure they will use old models. At least the game can better on a potato pc. 
---
39 to fuck shit up in STV
---
I hope then don't shard the Barrens or Westfall. IIRC they only talked about sharding the starting zones
---
As a member of the NoChange brigade, I expect you to keep this layout!
---
What weapon? Needs to be a very cool one
---
Kang?
---
19 is a boring
---
Strongly recommend having two characters. Get the 2nd up a little then leave him to build up rested XP. When the slog gets too real on your main, switch over and blast through some levels on the alt. Feels great.
---
I also strongly recommend leveling the hunter first so you can make some easy gold and gear the warrior while he's leveling. Having tested some warrior leveling very recently, a great weapon makes a *world* of difference. 
---
Pvp is orc and a close tie between dwarf and gnome.
---
Pve is troll and human
---
Druid 39 to use the mobility in AB when nobody has mounts
---
I ran one named never twenty
---
Wow the fact that their entire April fool's joke is about *not* including sharding throughout Classic, only to have the punch of the "joke" be about how dumb that is, is extremely fucking disheartening. 
---
Honestly feeling like I don't even care to play if that's their stance. 
---
Afaik there's no addon for it for Classic WoW yet. WoW Classic uses modern addon API (v7.3.5) so someone will need to either make a modern one or port an older version forward. There's a few good guides out there though like Joanas, VanillaGuide and one that was posted on this sub recently. ( [https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/1-11\_Dun\_Morogh](https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/1-11_Dun_Morogh) )
---
Great, thanks. I've yoinked this and will make good use of it.
---
Basically vael and chromaggus are huge bottlenecks
---
I have a poor impression of pug raids
---
Like I doubt a random mc raid in blues actually finishes it
---
Very easy! The program is free as well, so you can just try it out and see how to set up the stuff you need.
---
Remotr will suggest different games that you have installed on your PC. If it doesn't show up you can go on the "desktop" app and then navigate like you would a real PC and start WoW like that.
---
Yes, Warlock is the best class for this hands down of course.
---
Hardiness is really good.
---
Didn’t Blizzard make remote game streaming bannable?
---
From the EULA...
---
Cloud Computing: Use the Platform, including a Game, in connection with any unauthorized third-party “cloud computing” services, “cloud gaming” services, or any software or service designed to enable the unauthorized streaming or transmission of Game content from a third-party server to any device.
---
Play what you want dude. I'm going Nelf Priest even though Dwarves are technically better. With that said, Trolls have Berserking which is great for healing (which you'll probably be doing if you wanna raid).
---
Shamans are like healers with pets
---
Small raids like ZG and AQ20 have few day lockouts so can be raided many times a week with a short run. Bigger raids like MC, BWL at first take some time like 2+ hours but when experienced and geared will fall below 2h (and some guilds then just do MC+BWL with one raid night).
---
But also you don't have to raid everything nor does every class or build benefit equaly from given raid loot.
---

Is there a alive German Community for classic?

Whats the main forum for germans these days for guild recruitment etc.?

Are german servers even confirmed?

I fucking hope not, I'm looking forward to barrens chat and calling out for people I did x thing with earlier.

I see - the Sisters should work fine just nuking down... probably lower armor level also.
---
The big guys are the problematic ones I guess.. should try it myself with a hunter. :)
---
Right... Frost Mages should fine. But probably decent gear needed, otherwise not enough damage / running oom?
---
Because y'all alliance pussies never tasted Son of Arugal in Silverpine at 12.
---
This guy is a joke
---
The need for immersion. ( talking about playing without addons now )
---
You need to look in every house for questgivers. You need to read quests to know what to do. You need proffession to make some gold. You need other people for certain quests. You need to socialize to form groups for dungeons. You need a guild to see the raiding part of the game.
---
Leveling takes way longer but you "feel" power progression all the way to 60 by tallents, new spell ranks and gear upgrates.
---
Ion never actually specifically said which zones would be getting it. He said "for the first few weeks" and "only in a few zones." He hasn't specified what zones those even are, so Barrens and Westfall could potentially be included.
---
Bring back the STVietnam world pvp! 39s lets go - as it is the best Battleground in the end, no objective, just wpvp STVietnam.
---
So.. is streaming on Twitch bannable?
---
4 or 5 k should be good. That way you het rewarded by being leveling in the less populair leveling zones for less competition but not punished by being compleetly alone.
---
Smh...another one giving advice on a game he’s never played.
---
Hunters do great dmg in MC and are up there with the best in the early raids.
---
Also, how will they know if I do that? To the game, it just reads my inputs as mouse clicks.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
You’d be correct, it’s quite obvious to any normal intelligent person that there is demand enough for it. Activision blizzard however does not run on intelligent individuals anymore, it runs on industry analytics and profit algorithms as dictated by a bunch of old money men who don’t play video games. 
---
There is a chance the real people at blizzard manages to push out one for us, but the amount of miracles they can pull is limited.
---
Prot spec makes your tanking more comfortable but is not required for dungeons.
---
For end game dungeons and PVP you can always go with a 31/5/15 build.
---
Yes. 
---
Yea for sure. I guess it just irks people when others think [redacted] was the only PS and the be-all and end-all of the PS scene.
---
Thats quite nice, although I see it more of a personal marketing plan than an actual identity you give to a guild. While it is true that in WoW mastering a profession is not really something that gives you endgame content, when Im talking about a tailors guild (or any merchant guild basically) im talking about a force that actually has influence on the servers economic life. 
---
I imagine scouts always checking for the prices, I imagine haulers who buy all the cloth (and I mean ALL the cloth) from the AH using the massive amounts of wealth their monopoly in cloth brought to their guild, I imagine "sales men" who are constantly advertising in trade chat, etc. Its a bit more than just having an RP-ish focus on being a professional tailor. But maybe its a bit of a stretch.
---
Hi, /u/Bobothelord
---
I just realized I may have understood your comment wrong.. did you mean *stats-wise* they are pretty damn close? Because if that's the case I apologize, you're actually right. 
---
If the PUG is run by competent ppl, it will succeed. If you dont reserve EVERYTHING, even ppl with good gear will come. MC is really easy and example our pretty hc guild has had ppl run a PUG of all content. ~usually all benched ppl use their mains to have a chance to get some upgrades.
---
Im willing to bet that a lot of HC guilds will run split raids, to get more weapons and possibilities of TF's in example MC. Meaning you will have 1 MT, few core healers, few core dps'es carrying the whole raid. Even the most HC ppl it will take time to have alts leveled (and getting pre-bis for it). And a lot of people dont want to play on 2 chars.
---
15 years of experience will help in pugs too.
---
My character in vanilla had that name, maybe it was me.
---
I would play Classic on Mobile as well though if I could. But only if it were actually classic. So click away on those tiny tiny buttons.

It would be cool if they actually added this into classic

Because this fucker kill me each time i run  through the Silverpine!
---
I have played retail since 2008 and I have played emulated vanilla for 4 years.
---
Vanilla is by faaaaaar a better game than the current retail.
---
Especially at server launch. The supply is gonna be low and demand is gonna be high. Especially if you can get to 60 ahead of the curve and prepare for the fresh 60s.
---
Well you can check any of the previous polls, they all indicate that shaman is right after warrior on horde side.
---
Thats not an opinion. Thats a belief.

An opinion would be that the moon is prettier than the sun.

For some reason, my organism "prefers" living at night and sleeping at day. Once I fall asleep during a day, I can sleep all day and work all night.

True. And On the most recent polls shaman was just below warrior, and this was with faction separation.
---
I vagueley recall a rumor about this mount, about a cave in STV somewhere?
---
\#NoChanges   
---
Will only run on Windows ME,2000,XP and 98.
---
I know there will be a spot. But shaman will be still among most played classes on horde.
---
The mass of warriors will only be slighly bigger than the mass of shamans. On horde side, they come up to ~15%.
---
Was it on purpose that Taurens cant ride that? Too heavy?
---
Haha dude was getting kited 
---
looks good to me lol
---
&gt; 90% of your gameplay being running or doing nothing.
---
May I ask, have you actually played Vanilla? I mean I have played for 4 years now and I dont have time to do nothing. What exactly do you mean when you say we spend 90% time running or doing nothing?
---
I remember gnomes and dwarves running to Northshire Abbey to start there instead during Vanilla, so I'd assume so.
---
Best bracket to twink priest healer ?

---
Oh, right. April 1st.
---
1. Probably true
---
2. Very true
---
3. Guides were plenty enough back then. I did very little raiding but I were directed to websites with written guides and videos of raids.
---
4. This is dependent on country. In my country (Sweden) broadband access were fairly common. And even if it's not as high speed as today, it made very little difference in gaming as long as you had at least 10 mb/s.
---
APRIL FOOOOOOLS
---
You tried.
---
Yeah you've got the gist of it. There's no re-doing the past
---
I just passed on the information. How you decide to use that information is up to you!
---
Twitch streaming is not the same thing i guess, since you broadcast your gameplay instead of using a software to play through.
---
Yup, in vanilla Taurens couldn't ride a lot of mounts. If I recall correctly they were pretty much limited to kodos and wolves.
---
[Here's classic wowheads list of mounts](https://classic.wowhead.com/mount-items/side:2) if you want to check specific one.
---
and you wouldn't have it any other way
---
ayo
---
There's already a weekly thread for recruiting you might find more luck there I've already seen a lot of eastern Aussie guilds forming
---
Lol
---
I wasn't level 40 back then, but I bought that one anyway, because I knew they'd be going away
---
Cheers, I'll check it out
---
Sounds perfect for me!
---
I would say yes you are gimping yourself but only a little and Trolls are really cool.
---
Talent-wise, if you don't want to severely limit your capability in both questing and PvP, you really want to be at 31/5/0 by level 45. 
---
From this point, the next 10 talent points are going to be more or less wasted, no matter what you do:
---
* Putting more points into Fury leads to Imp. Battleshout (nice, but not significant) and Piercing Howl (awesome). Enrage is fairly useless, since you won't be able to proc it on demand
---
* The first 10 points in Prot have very little impact even when tanking. The good stuff comes between the 11th and 17th point, but by that time you start taking those, you're lv56 already.
---
So really, it comes down to Piercing Howl vs. Last Stand and a few points in Defiance for tanking. Personally, I would prefer Piercing Howl, but this is close enough to be personal preference I think. Either will perform good enough in the mid-50 instances.
---
Actual Prot specs shine when you do instances with preBiS/raid equipped DPS, while having crappy gear yourself (since Shield Slam etc does great without high crit% or AP). In this situation, 31/5/15 (or 31/3/17) will do better than 31/20/0 as well. This (31/3/17) is your best bet if you want to tank and PvP without respeccing, imo.
---
Amen
---
They only sold alliance version in Europe unfortunately
---
 Not hard enough though 
---
one of my best retail memories was sometime around the end of TBC, me and two friends made a 3-dwarf party.  pala, priest, rogue.  we went to raven hill cemetary to aoe farm with consecration and holy nova (and... slice n dice? lol)
---
i had a lot of fun with those 2 guys, we also 3-manned every instance up to and including some of BRD with warlock+mage+rogue which personally i think is pretty impressive
---
They mentioned working on proper Vanilla lighting. I am sure this is also related to the nighttime brightness. 
---
Hi, /u/Excaliburrover
---
You've just presuposed that the person has a guild. And it still deletes your ability to join any public group for that time. 
---
Yeah absolutely! I suspect the old trend might not continue in the re-release but I'm very intrigued to see how it plays out! 
---
&gt;Reduces the mana cost of all traps and melee abilities by 20% per rank and reduces the cooldown of all traps by 2 sec per rank. (3 ranks total).
---
It's war?
---
I mean, technically you can i guess.
---
It doesn't say that, though, but i guess it is up to Blizz who they decide to enforce the EULA on
---
Affirmative.
---
Was a priest from classic trough wotlk and then left. I didnt even see instances and raids basicly , only raidframes
---
TMI
---
It depends on people's experience and how different the actual 1.12 code is compared to p servers.
---
A lot of stuff on p servers is a best guess on how it works, so things will be different on live classic than p servers. To what degree that makes things harder or easier is yet to be seen.
---
Iirc sharding will be inplace only for the first weeks because it would be impossible to level otherwise
---
Knew it was an april fools troll the moment I didn't see a link.

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Contact kyte#1707 on discord for more information! 
---
Yo is there a tabletop rpg version of WoW and would anyone wanna play? Maybe on Roll20 or tabletop simulator or something?
---
They could ride all the drop-able mounts too from memory. Baron's Deathcharger, Raptor and Tiger from ZG, plus the AQ bugs. 
---
I'm sure I remember xp arriving in battlegrounds in classic - so I think at different points it did and did not give XP.
---
As I mostly pvped back then I remember it being a big boost to my leveling (and there was some money added which was nice as a hunter it about covered my ammo from memory), plus a massive hit to twinks (which I was a glad to see the back of... unpopular opinion in this thread probably). I think the ability to toggle on and off xp was what arrived in wotlk (again unpopular opinion but I was sad they brought that back a no xp option).
---
This is just from memory though so if you can link patch notes or something I'd be happy to be corrected
---
Bro my UI never looked this trashy, this isn't a classic thing as much as your mindset lol
---
Also I wouldn't use rando sites for data vs people who did it.
---
Eg: 1m duration https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=14311
---
And Traps had a shared Cooldown in TBC iirc, though that might have been Wotlk.
---
Racials are not that serious. Play what appeals to you.
---
Eh your taking it to serious m8. Ruthless and merciless pvp is an integral part of vanilla, doing a big part in making it feel like a dynamic world. Likewise faction war and hate has always been integral to Warcraft. You do you by any means, but don’t get that wrong idea - this is the experience.
---
How can I test, classic isn't out yet?
---
You better stay away from Frostadamus videos then. That guy can really bring his own unique take on some words.
---
I’m gonna make a more basic one eventually but, check out Kargoz. He has a really good warrior leveling guide. 
---
NOW FOR YOU. INSECTS. BOLDLY YOU SOUGHT THE POWER OF RAGNAROS. NOW YOU SHALL SEE IT, FIRST HAND.
---
\*BigWigs Boss Warning Sound starts playing\*
---
Race: Not Tauren
---
April Fools or not, this is sadly not far from the truth.
---
Hi, /u/bradpal
---
Huh? The guy is hardly wrong. You on the other hand seem to be throwing a lil hissy fit
---
There’s a picture of some shamans ui that’s worse than this. Wish I could find it. 
---
...and about 1 time every second. His attack speed is incredibly fast.
---
I’ve never understood, if you have to rush to get your name it’s really common and boring! Make a unique name 
---
There's also an elite level 55 bird in Badlands fucking you over if you think it's a normal buzzard.
---
It might be a bit harder, but you can still join public groups. 
---
Surely there will be an Aussie server right? God I hope so...
---
Level 19 hunger with all the fishing items, can basically kill an entire team of non twinks.
---
"To maintain authenticity we will be releasing Classic™  with it's original download client, limited to 125 kb/s as to keep in with the theme of the original client and download speeds people had, at a later date, we will release a patch that prevents people from installing Classic™ on their SSD HDD".
---
Well undead rogue is very much needed in endgame
---
Just for the record, after playing in a top hardcore guild on private servers. 
---
The "min/max elitist types" of players will most certainly help their guildies get gear, because min maxing goes past maximizing your own character. This notion that they'd be more selfish than other players is hillarious. It's a playstyle that dont fit most people for several reasons, but this is some bullshit.
---
Yeah, turns out Hardiness only increases your stun resist from 15% to 18.75%. Not that big of a deal. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSHutO3uS3w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSHutO3uS3w)  :)
---
It's just you
---
Yeah, after the recent updates I started putting more and more faith on the Classic team and I was really confident that they are on the right path. This, however, changes everything. I'm legit worried they gonna fuck it up...
---
Herb + Alch is always good. Good money and you can personally farm the raid consumables.
---
Maybe even Skin + Herb for bonus cash until 60 and then swap out Skin for Alch and powerlevel it.
---
Run head first into stitches 
---
Vanilla windfury was so OP
---
&gt;I think people are overpreparing.
---
I think that is due to the long wait before we can actually get on with it. Nothing else to do then sharpen our knives and hone our skills :)
---
Myself, i am going to take it slow and enjoy what is coming ones it releases but i can understand some will want to get to 60 quickly and start end-game stuff.
---
Btw ive seen enhas use soj as a pod alternative
---
I will do lot of outdoor pvp  so engi it is for me. The other profession will probably be mining. I rather farm my material then buy it from ah. Engi wont bring a lot of money and a lot of people will also do like me. 
---
Level 49 warlock twink checking in, I think I was rank 8, maybe 1 rank off the max at that level? 
---
I didn’t even have that good gear, aff locks just had so much sustain at that level. 
---
As a priest a good wand is basically the most important thing in the game while leveling.
---
U can have a lot of fun fighting open world
---
Like for 49 u can go to tanaris and farm them all

---
**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
-	We are an international group of currently 22 people, consisting of various backgrounds. We have both (very) experienced and (very) inexperienced members.
---
-	We are looking to create a mature gaming community where everyone is valued and people support each other.
---
-	While it wasn’t common back in the day, we are open to hybrids and off-specs if people are willing to make them work.
---
-	Our goal is to clear all the content (again)
---
-	As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values. 
---
**Guild Structure**
---
-	We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
-	Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers. 
---
-	Reasoning for all important decisions are to be made public internally and are open for debate. 
---
**Raid information**
---
-	Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
-	Loot distribution system will be voted on by the majority before launch (leaning towards Loot Council)
---
-	While full optimization regarding buffs, potion etc. is not required, but people who put in the effort and support others will be rewarded accordingly
---
**About you**
---
-	No matter if you are a single person or represent a group, we are always glad to hear from you. 
---
-	Do you want to push damage meters and optimize but don’t have the time like you did 15 years ago? Then you’d find yourself right at home.
---
-	Do you just want to go through the content at your own pace and just want to have a nice community to play with? Then we‘d definitely suit you.
---
-	Do you just want to play something that you didn’t have the opportunity back then while not being treated as a second class citizen? Again, then this project is you’re looking for.

&lt;DOMINATUS&gt; [OCEANIC] [HORDE] [PVP]
---
Time Zone: GMT+11
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+11 (days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Contact: https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX
---
Guild info: Dominatus will be a late-night, semi-hardcore guild with a no-dickhead policy. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+11 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).
---
Join the discord here https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX and feel free to message if you have any questions.
---
Cheers!
---
And you dont oom much
---
Playing a rogue or warrior u pretty much nee a healer cuz everyone shoots u in the middle of the fight like u are glorified cannon fodder
---
Making sure that EU has a truly authentic release.
---
One of my guildmates in vanilla had a 59 twink. Only 59 twink I've ever seen, and as a result he had free reign in BGs. Got to the point where 19 twinks didn't always wreck the opposition because they had 19 twinks on their own team too, but in the 50-59 bracket? Only him.
---
People did that with mining too
---
I saw people with 3k hp holypalas 39

Feel free to send your next message without sending me a message.

&gt; Feral Druids can now be crowd-controlled by throwing a slice of cheese on their head.
---
Rofl
---
Was this the guy who kneels in front of a grave?
---
And it's a woefully inefficient quest chain to do, if you want to level fast.
---
Beast mystery was literally just a macro that varied slightly depending on weapon speed. I dabbled with survival and it was fine but topping meters while masturbating was more fun. My memory's fine.

---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere**
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun 20:00 - 24:00 CET (with Monday an extra raid day for progression)

&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP] 
---
Raidstyle: Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient
---
* Sociable
---
* A team player
---
Intentions:
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Recruiting:
---
Old players
---
New players
---
Casual players
---
Semi-Hardcore players
---
We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
Interested?
---
Feel free to ask questions in the comments or come and join our Discord - https://discord.gg/X4dmVqr
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest.
---
I'd be very surprised if there isnt
---
How adorably naive lol.
---
Raiding will be way easier than it was, because of the reasons you mentioned. These days everything is optimised. People no the best in slot gear every step of the way, the best raid/group compositions, best tactics, best specs, etc. 
---
Back in original vanilla we got all the way to Naxxramas with a whole load of unusual stuff. I was only about 14-15 (remember me and a few of my mates had to lie and say we were 16 on or guild applications), arms warriors, ret paladins, feral druids, balance druids , and all kinds of other weird specs. I'm sure that if we'd known what we do today we probably could have cleared all content.
---
That's wrong though. It doesn't increase by 25% but actually add 25%.
---
There was much less screen real-estate back then. I played a healer and half of my screen was raid UIs. These days on a 1080p monitor there's plenty of room for everything.
---
I'm surprised we are even asking for this; one of the reasons why Classic WoW was adored compared to modern WoW was the sense of immersion. It couldn't get any more immersive than RP-PvP. It was the very server type the game was marketed at toward release, before they decided to create varying server types.
---
I remember that i randomly found his quest while farming some herbs. And as i carried his quest reward sword many ppl asked where i get this neat sword. 
---
&gt;Feral Druids can now be crowd-controlled by throwing a slice of cheese on their head.
---
Lol. I really hope that hunter's "scare beast" will work on druids in Classic.
---
Duskwood was 2spooky4me
---
Yes you're right. The macro varied depending on your weapon speed. You used one version or the other depending on that and your autos weren't wasted.
---
I never went "pvp mode" as pve was time consuming enough. But both combat and hemo performed well in pvp, so I guess rogues were lucky in terms of all around specc. 
---
It was just a private server bug. Those melee spell damage proc builds were way more powerful than any conventional DPS spec, to the point that having them in the game would break both PvE and PvP.
---
He said starting areas, we don't know if it's just the first zones or the whole starting areas, but Barrens and Westfall are NOT starting areas..
---
Great work. However I think it could be improved. I'd like to see some freezing panes and filters.
---
Hey guys. Any casual Romanian guilds around?
---
Shadow priests are awesome except they have mana issues but that won't be a big deal in short skirmishes. 
---
April fools day obviously!  Damn I know it hurt but it had to be done.  
---
A Tauren Druid camped me in the badlands for the majority of a day. It was a hard day of questing and honestly I'll never forget the guy.
---
Always fun to watch some top tier PvP.
---
It's gonna be a loooong day -_-
---
Shamans are in high demand in raids for their totems. They generally spam chain heal and leave tank healing to other classes. Chain heal is super satisfying to spam though so its not as bad as a Druid for example
---
Priests have much more variety in their spell usage which can be more engaging. Plus Benediction!
---
This video might help:

---
I distinctly remember Arcanite Reaper being enormously popular amongst Shammies. Also in the early days of vanilla frostshock was so incredibly annoying to play against 
---
Also, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mD1n4v2JA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mD1n4v2JA)
---
I'm in a close spot. But it is actually harder to solve since I do know what I want, sadly it might become a tough road... again. So it's either get another try (and possibly fail again) or just go for the next best thing sacrificing playstyle in the run. 
---
Damn don’t be a hater on April fools day. Respect the game son!
---
Druid is just keeping the cycle of nature going.  
---
We camp your lowbies because you camped our lowbies because we camped your lowbies and so on and so forth.
---
Cenarius approves.
---
what is the hemo dps spec? its swords right?

We are a New Zealand &amp; Australian based guild, we are being reborn once again for classic. This time round we're looking at a semi-hardcore approach, we will be pushing to clear content as quickly as possible. While our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner while maintaining a relaxed &amp; Fun atmosphere.

Also we fully expect some people cannot raid as hardcore as they used to, and we have kept that in mind and will be allowing casual’s also to join, as long as “if” or “when” they become available to raid they do so by giving their all.

Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!

We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to **clear all raid content**, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
**Our background:**
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
**What we offer:**
---
\-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at GMT 20.00 -23.00
---
\-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
\-          Balanced raid groups
---
\-          For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
**What we require of raiders:**
---
\-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week 40-man raids
---
\-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We **strongly** believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be **“geared and cleared”** of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
**Loot rules:** We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: *https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing*

Same here, night elf female rogue, ahh nostalgia...!!
---
Ranged AoE pulls I presume and also the AoE capabilities from the eng-crafted shield. Even if threat isn't boosted (don't know it either) for dungeons it is handy and for certain bosses reflectors' resistances are nice. 
---
Nice April Fool's.
---
WoW, the territory slayer...!!
---
Yep, Classic demo had only old models and old animations. No "new animations incorporation" at all.
---
Ty for the heartattack. 
---
Hi, /u/Redzy7
---
Thought for sure this was an April fools joke about lfg being confirmed in vanilla. 
---
I'll probably make a level 1 twink and duel creeps in Goldshire. Gotta make use of the fact that any character can wear [Goblin Rocket Boots](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7189#comments) regardless of level or profession.

Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

Orc is pretty good for enh shaman overall, but it's not as big of a bonus as some other race choices (like dwarf priest). I say play whatever you want, there will be differences, but in the grand scheme they will be minor. You still get berserking which is usable for enh, so dont worry. Especially if you dont want to play hardcore, just focus on what you enjoy.
---
I think the most important change is that you know whats coming, so you can prepare. Start progressing in AQ and you didnt know you needed shitloads of nature and shadow potions. You didnt know that ZG enchants would be changed, items have their stats adjusted. You didnt know what buffs (and very importantly DEBUFFS) stack and what doesnt. No real info of stat values, accurate bis lists etc.
---
We were focusing on current content, now you can plan the whole classic in mind. Oh yeah, ill keep these frost resistance items, since i can use them at naxx. 
---
Race isn't going to make any real difference.  No class will be 'rare', but least played healing class will  be Druid if that's what you're looking for.  There will be lots of Paladins and Priests, so pick whichever one sounds like more fun to you if you're set on one of those two.

&lt;Limbo&gt; - Horde / NA / Pvp /Casual to Moderate 
---
Limbo is a guild made because I believe that raid’s can be progressed through and cleared without min maxing every detail and requiring guild members to work in WoW like a second job, it’s a game lets relax a little.
---
-Loot System -
---
Open bid DKP with main spec and certain classes on specific items getting bonus points added to their bid on the item. Very few hard reserve items in raids is the idea.
---
-Raid Times-
---
Wednesday / 6:30 - 9:30 pm est
---
Thursday / 6:30 - 9:30 pm est
---
(Optional Day if people want to progress/finish the weeks raids) Sunday / 6:30-9:30 pm est
---
-Goals-
---
To clear all raids at a moderate pace and make friends along the way in a relaxed guild environment.

Moderate | PvE on PvP server | Based in the UK | Horde 
---
**About us:** 
---
Mok’ra! &lt;Guild&gt; is recruiting new members to join our core group of players in the upcoming Classic WoW. Our team has experienced members spanning across WoW’s timeline and we are looking for enthusiastic players to join us and create a tight-knit raiding community. Becoming part of &lt;Guild&gt; is an opportunity to play with others who share your passion for vanilla and want to be involved in the raiding scene. We’re also rolling up on a PvP server, despite our PvE goals. You might think that you’d rather roll on a filthy PvE server to do PvE, but in the words of a man far wiser than any of us, 
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
**Our Goals:** 
---
\- Upon the launch of Classic, we’ll be aiming to hit level 60 within a couple of months and start gearing up in dungeons. We understand this won’t be possible for everyone, so we will be lenient on this, and help people out where we can. However, we do expect people to be levelling regularly and making progress consistently, even if this is a little slower than ideal. 
---
\- We are planning on progressing through the end-game dungeons, then jumping into Molten Core and going from there, doing raids as they come. 
---
\- We aim to try our best and clear as much vanilla content as possible. The most important part is having fun, but also working as a team. It’s rarely “That one guys” fault every time and we will openly communicate to improve our strategy.
---
**Expectations:** 
---
\- A willingness to learn and do your best. 
---
\- Actually showing up! 
---
\- Putting in the effort to have what you need and turning up prepared. This is really important to ensure nobody is wasting the rest of the player’s time.
---
**Looking for:**
---
We will be showing preferences to melee DPS such as Arm/Fury Warriors, Rouges and also healers
---
**Schedule:** 
---
\- The days will be chosen closer to release. 
---
\- Time will be 7:00PM GMT and include a break for 10 minutes at 9:00PM to keep everyone at their best. 
---
We will be using Discord as our recruitment platform pre-release and as a communication hub throughout the game. Feel free to PM the Guild Leader (Orinus#1430) or Recruitment Officer (Trauzek#7247) for any queries and join our discord server: [https://discord.gg/m2j9mgZ](https://discord.gg/m2j9mgZ)
---
not too much, don't worry about it.
---
playing what race you really feel like is a racial by itself sortof. Since you like your character more, and therefore invest into more time and effort into it, and therefore be more geared :).
---
obviously tauren and orc is better, but its not like torlls are unplayable and you won't be able to succeed with it, play it functinably and have fun.
---
ppl tend to overrate racial in general in vanilla.
---
The problem is that duo leveling is viewed as slower and less efficient than solo leveling in this game by the vast majority of the population.  This causes most people to avoid doing it.
---
Honestly the biggest flaw WoW has IMO.  
---
This was just posted like 2 days ago
---
Took you long enough. I expected more from this subreddit.
---
I’ve had one at each bracket and they are fun.  You do have to plan your gear to take dungeon runs and long quest chains for rewards info account though, but not outleveling your bracket isn’t that hard as long as you have a game plan.
---
Tauren't
---
A priest popping power world shield upon seeing an enemy is like a white person locking their car in a black neighborhood
---
Hmm, april fools, but anyway.
---
I'll be looking for people on PVP realm of Europe. I won't be duo/group-leveling, but will like do chat and dungeon once now and then.
---
I'm a druid, btw, and light RP'er, and also will almost certainly have periods of leveling as balance.
---
rofl i actually fell for this shit
---
I keep convincing myself it’s coming out tomorrow.
---
Default WSG flag carrier. 
---
I think it could be argued that any non-contested zone is within the definition of starting area. Probably before long Barrens will be busier than any other zone in the game anyway. If they think it's necessary for Durotar, I can't really imagine them thinking otherwise about Barrens.
---
Too low effort to be respected

Zzz, didn't even flinch.

Yes, indeed there was some changes with the title and I had to delete it.

I most definitely played AB on my lvl 29 rogue twink.
---
Loving the pumpkin bag, gonna farm alotta them up come Halloween.
---
Exactly when did the WF nerf hit in? This will be a somewhat deciding factor for if i'm going to run very first lvl 60 (troll rogue) or a shaman (late vanilla)

The irony about this April's fools topic is that youtube and twitch accounts with private server footage on them will be a thing of the past in just a couple of weeks
---
Either that or they remove said clips by themselves to avoid the strikes and/or lawsuits.
---
I'm also curious how this subreddit will handle it. I doubt that reddit wants to bother with the fuss. So we may end up seeing a stricter policy in this subreddit soon-ish  
---
Oh man. I spent hours getting up to that cave and waiting. Eventually I gave up and went on a tour of the out-of-bounds areas of EK. Sadly I lost all the screenshots
---
An even bigger asshole
---
The bodies fertilize the ground. It's eco-friendly ganking.
---
I believe the theoretical highest dps assuming everything scales/stacks with fire spec was 3k-3.2k 
---
Will Blizzard allow fire spec? no, especially since its already well known. There are other lesser known weird "exploits" that I dare not even mention because they might get fixed.  
---
Wow...the music...
---
That...sounds amazing. I think you should definitely give it a go. Both being cloth is a bit of a bummer, but man. There's just so much utility between that pairing. How could you not??
---
We were doing it in good manner, not spamming it every 30s when only was possible to click our macro. Were not sitting in LFG tool in LBRS spamming WTS +10 boost. Send 2-3 messages in few minutes get a guy for a carry and go for another one. Idk you want to downvote me only because we were selling a service for ingame currency for people who were disabled enough to do one +10 mythic plus dungeon a week.
---
guess we met someday and we liked your gold :----)
---
I liked having mining on my hunter in vanilla, it was easy gold to [solo farm zg thorium nodes](https://i.imgur.com/3ywUbfU.jpg) in downtime.
---
Gottem!
---
Unless you are good flag carrier, premades will be hard. AB, priests and paladins do a better job healing but you are a far better anchor.
---
would appreciate if it was just 3 months from today, though
---
Worst day of the year to be on the internet. "Hey look how goofy and zainey we are!!"
---
T0.5 Quest is not great. Not a good plot. Same with Benediction.
---
Paladin Mount Q... maybe tied but i don't think so. Just not as good a plot.
---
Dreadstead quest is a heist quest where you still a Dreadsteed from a Nathrezim (few Nathrezim exist in Vanilla)
---
This guy had it all figured out. Except for the news channel. Kinda expected Azeroth Breaking News. 
---
Wait until they realize that they are responsible for the group's health, not to pull aggro, play some defense, and keep the tank alive at all costs.  They will hot-key flash heal, and then whine and cry of "no mana, no mana" when their tank needs to chain pull and/or pulls an extra group.
---
This explains Brexit.
---
These "must-have add-ons" are the reason why people never could get out of the fire, clouds of green smoke and/or see extra mobs.
---
There is no end to the demands I see hehe. Then again I had a blast on Defias Brotherhood.
---
I looked into it, it's not worth the effort.
---
You'll soon realize that by far the more elegant solution is using an ultraportable laptop. 
---
My Thinkpad runs TBC at 60 FPS for around seven hours, six on LTE, and the screen and input devices are just better suited for a game. 
---
Consider this, if you use your phone, you'll use an external keyboard anyway. That's at least 300 grams + whatever your phone weighs, plus a power bank, which you'll definitely need. So just weight wise, you'll lug around a good kilo. Vs. a laptop that weighs 1.3 kilos. 
---
The latency will be noticeably worse, as will the controls, as will the screen size, as will power consumption, as will internet usage. 
---
I try to keep all of my content at 10 minutes, but sometimes that’s just not possible.
---
I love how in the first picture, your friend asks you to give back the bag he sent you if you just quit the game after a week. I guess you can say that you played for a bit more than a week.
---
Pally pally?
---
Dusk Wood was THE best, the atmosphere was on point, I remember getting there with my hunter, which was a NE, so I was to go through a huge road trip to get there. 
---
RIP in peace.
---
I never knew the guy during the WoW days, only found him when he started casting SC2. 
---
Loved his work so much...
---
He's pretty much the reason we have Dark Souls on PC, which I'll always be grateful for.
---
holy fuck i panicked.
---
well played
---
Sadly no Headless Horseman in Vanilla =(
---
PvP as a Druid means utilising everything. You're going to heal, CC, dps at range, tank it up in bear and slink around in cat. You need to constantly switch depending on the situation; keep that warrior rooted at range and try and dps him down a bit before switching to bear and fighting him face to face, but that mage over there, dot him up, get in there as cat and pummel him as hard as you can. But don't forget you're a healer too. We're the only healers that can stealth, which can be crucial to luring the enemy into fights they think they can win. 
---
Always remember that even with the best gear your fights won't be over super-fast (although you can sometimes get some lucky crits in cat that bring down badly geared clothies very quickly).
---
Spec wise, the default for PvP is 0/30/21. Key talents are Feral Charge, Heart of the Wild, Insect Swarm and Nature's Swiftness. Feral Charge is amazing for mobility and for closing with spell-casters. Heart of the Wild is just an all-round amazing talent, buffing everything you do. Insect Swarm is a PvP staple, giving you an instant cast dot that you can toss out everywhere. And Nature's Swiftness gives you an instant heal every 3 minutes, which can completely change the outcome out a fight. You can also heal or tank in dungeons and raids with this spec too, if you feel inclined to do so. A variation on it is 1/29/21, which sacrifices 1 point in Heart of the Wild to get Nature's Grasp, which is an extremely useful PvP talent. 
---
Gear-wise, there's really only 3 sets that support the hybrid style of druid gameplay: Tier 0.5, Tier 2.5 and the PvP gear. Hybrid gear doesn't really exist outside of those areas. Tier 0.5 is costly and time consuming to get, but doesn't require raiding, and if you don't mind tanking, you'll always get groups. Tier 2.5 is AQ40, and you don't want to raid, so that's out. And PvP gear takes a lot of time investment to get. But if you're going to be PvPing anyway, you should be able to get the blue set at least. Getting the epic set is a very different kettle of seafood. 
---
And finally, Druids are not limited to just healing in raids. Guilds on private servers commonly take Feral Druids as off-tanks, and druids can tank perfectly well in all the raid content Classic has to offer. Open-minded guilds will see the benefits of having a Feral Druid tank along for a raid. Check out [Taladril's guide to Feral Tanking](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) and [Skarm's tanking guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo)

**&lt;For Fun&gt; - EU - Horde - PvP Server - Casual Raiding Guild**
---
**Raid Times**
---
Wednesday and Saturday: 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET) 
---
You are not required to make both raid days every week. We respect that you will have commitments in real life and understand that comes first!
---
**Introduction**
---
For Fun is going to be a more casually and social orientated raiding guild as Horde on a PvP server. This means we will raid and aim to clear all content, but on a more relaxed schedule and mindset. This means we accept people of any class or spec, even if it’s considered sub-par. The social aspect of the guild is also very important to us. For too long on retail the sense of community has died in the game and it is a shame. We hope to remake the original sense of community within our guild so even if you don’t raid, you have a home where you can have fun and make friends. There will be social events like hide and seek, fashion competitions, catfish dules and also a Stormwind streaking competition, all with prizes! We also have set up a retail guild on Emeriss Horde if you would like to come and hang there! Most of us rerolled without heirlooms and hope to get to know each other before Classic comes out.
---
**Expectations**
---
A casual and relaxed raid environment.
---
A friendly atmosphere both in and outside of raids.
---
Social events available for all guild members at any level (with prizes!).
---
An experienced and mature leadership team.
---
A “for fun” attitude to everything in the game. That is what games are for after all!

None of this information was hard to find in Vanilla's day. People knew the good gear, the good enchants, and the strategies for fights prior to going into them. You have a point about technological limitations but I think you're overstating how major a factor it was: you weren't getting DCs every fight. 
---
I reckon there'll be more high quality guilds simply because the playerbase on Classic will be older: we were all teenagers back then whereas now I think a substantial portion of Classic's playerbase will be older and more mature. Guild-breaking drama will be less (not gone, but less) than it was back then.
---
I think you'll still end up with stratification with every server having a few "top" guilds per faction and then a vast array of middle-of-the-road guilds who are at various stages of progression.
---
We'll still get at least a couple of years out of "just Classic" before it gets stale, and your guess is as good as mine about what Blizz does at that point: pserver still restarts; TBC servers; OSRS-style "new Classic" content; something else? Blizz themselves probably don't even know yet.
---
RIP
---
About time. Been waiting for some of these fixes. Now I can actually enjoy the game.
---
Not asking top damage. If you cannot get a group or raid because you are a ret pally or some other weak spec then there are fundamental issues with the class balance. 
---
&gt;-Warlocks FelHunter is now sexually attracted to fire. 
---
Call an ambulance for my sides
---
Word bro. 
---
As a healer who grew up from Curse raid frames in MC until some of the better healing add-ons for classic and the expansions -- I chose to simply use those as my group / raid frames.  With the availability of one-click / hover healing, your top, six heals mapped to your mouse buttons -- finally healers actually got to see the game play.
---
It takes awhile to get used to, but once you realize that your raid frames can be far less in size, can be placed on either side of your monitor (for maximized screen view) -- you, too, can 'dance, dance, dance' and keep healing.
---
Well from tbc to wotlk i basicly used only clique + grid . My action bar had only offensive spells and all heals were mouse binded with two extra buttons on my mouse i felt comfortable with all the combos i had.
---
Is there a good source for lore before the more 'modern' take on it by Blizz? I feel like after Wrath it really, really took a nosedive - but trying to read up on it now always has references to new lore and its retcons
---
California hasn't woken up yet. Don't worry, it's coming soon™. 
---
Low enough to get you? Don’t be mad bruh it’s April fools day. 
---
It works when they’re shapeshifted
---
I hated stitches. Someone else would trigger the quest and you’d be walking along and boom dead. 
---
I think he plays shaman.
---
Yes, I was looking forward to April fools jokes about release, but something higher quality than this is all :)

Yea this is really triggering me
---
Surprised by the down votes. I assumed a little humor would be nice. Oh well. 
---
Well yeah, but my previous statement stands, it wasn't very well executed. Had you come up with a date and a good reason for it, and made it look like an authentic blue post... Then that would have been something!
---
So never actually played Vanilla, and not a single argument for why its better. 
---
Yes, and you could see the gameplay.  I'm right-handed, and my health bars were on the right side of my screen, and rather small in size.  I preferred the longer length, not as wide width so I could maximize my view screen.  It was the same for 5-man's or 10-man's, and all I had to do was a small adjustment for those smaller groups.  But I feel ya, staying behind sometimes and concentrating on health bars versus the action can get boring.  But I love it.
---
I can't understand this "kids these days" mentality. Especially, from a sub filled with nerds that heard the same stuff throughout their childhood and teens. Would have loved to have an empathetic teacher like you!
---
Just out of curiosity, what possible benefit is there to having a feral offtank? They don't provide any group buffs and their damage is less than that of a fury offtank?
---
Mate you're not even trying 
---
So you don’t care anything about the actual TCG, you just want the loot cards?
---
Just put them in an online shop if that’s what you want, saves everyone time and money...
---
Will 20 minute save me 20% or more on shoulderpad insurance?
---
It's called a discussion. Why bother posting such a pointless response that doesn't contribute to the conversation?
---
It's low tier but someone somewhere will fall for it
---
As I understand it, a normal WoW sub will get you Classic. Based on that, I seriously doubt there will be a box release or collectors edition. 
---
It just lacks the armor of having a shield, and the damage procs of the pod. Def a good choice tho.
---
Looking for a german guild / community hub 
---
Btw are german servers confirmed?
---
Repost, the orgrinal post was fun as more people posted their drawings. OP, have you got a link?
---
[don't be mad that i fucking got you okay](https://imgur.com/PgZyyYV)
---
you bought a mount that never existed in game?
---
They do provide the group with Leader of the Pack (3% crit) and utility as innervate and battle res. 
---
I want to try the TCG now that I'm older... I was young and didn't care about them *then*
---
I would definitely play it now.
---
It wasn't brought up in the podcast but i have a theory that Deathcoil got the horror effect due to WoR 3/2/1 vids as up until then, warlocks had no way to get someone off of you.
---
The raids themselves were extremely simple. Even the hardest fights are "easy" by todays standards, as long as you are prepared enough.
---
So I doubt it will be even close to as hard as it was during the good old days
---
Perhaps you see it as such. I see it as someone who doesn't understand the simple fact that they themselves are the only ones able to answer the question they've just asked and that they probably fear they won't like the game and in desperation are looking for affirmation from others ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
People love to lie on the internet.  Clearly he didn't get the memo that this was an unavailable mount.  Not sure why people feel it's necessary to lie, especially about virtual pixels in a game...
---
BWL I love the encounters and design
---
No prob 
---
I'm actually convinced it's gonna be July 16
---
Yeah man that’s fair, I think we would all prefer that. I miss seeing the world alive.
---
Just worried it could be an argument between smooth launch or bottle neck zones that’s all 
---
Yes, yes I would. That's why I play on normal servers, not PvP ones.
---
This is 100% genuine. 
---
I used teamviewer to login to my server when there were long ques from work so i didnt have to wait at home.
---
in pvp, druids are good for flag carrying and duels. they suck at everything else.
---
raiding as a druid is the easiest and the most undemanding, noone expect anything from you (since everyone knows druid suck at healing), just buff ppl, half afk the rest of the raid and collect loot.
---
Up until AQ there isn't much of a progression for the more dedicated guilds. Raids will be cleared the day they open or the guilds step foot into them (not counting rep farm). 
---
I wholeheartedly agree with the concept, but in practice after you die for the billionth time to a level 60 camping Sentinel Hill, you learn to just kill lowbies on the off chance they’re an alt of one of those campers lmao
---
I remember having peggel in WoW. Forgot that had existed. Good call. 
---
Leader of the pack, +1dps or healer or decurser when single tank is needed, can dps after your add is dead, different gearing scheme allowing more tanks to be geared and geared faster, higher dps than any prot warrior tank and higher mitigation than any fury tank.
---
No changes! EU launch 3 months after NA.
---
&gt; could you please give me some advice about how you're supposed to handle wPvP?
---
**If it is red, it is dead. **
---
Oh yeah, completely forgot about LotP. I'm curious how that maths out though, if it makes up for the lack of DPS provided. There's probably a fall off curve.
---
I was already toying arround with this.
---
best solution for me was streaming the game via moonlight.  
---
I tried remote desktop aswell, but the results were not satisfying.  
---
bluetooth keyboard + usb mouse and you are good to go.  
---
no real problems except the UI scale. which can be solved easily anyways.
---
It was Kang
---
Smoke signals? Where can I get that technology? I have to use Messenger Pigeons.
---
I have some contacts
---
Well hey, we only get one shot with this! We want to make sure they get it right
---
er du dansk?
---
Yes and? That was The Burning Crusade, this is Classic.
---
This is solid, is there anyway to display reputation with which quest or is that not available?
---
Get that WC staff quest done and you are settled for the next 8 levels!
---
Rolling need (and winning) on an item that you couldn't equip was considered ninja looting, at least on my server.
---
I had the case in the Deadmines, a rogue rolled and won on a nice 2 handed mace, I kicked him out of the group.
---
He later admitted it was because he thought he could sell it at the AH to make gold (didn't understand the concept of bind on pick-up).
---
The secrets of smoke signals are Passed down the mi'kmaq tribal line. I envy your pigeons I have to burn something down in order to check for updates 
---
Mine is AQ40, loved the everything about it: music, design, theme and event. Plus, i hate bugs and i love killing them.
---
&gt; Not being shit
---
You mean, taking your time with zero chances and zero risk, effecting your leveling speed.
---
Are you another one of these people arguing over semantics? It's not overrated, because nobody never dies
---
 Where are all the pics from Stranglethorn Vale?
---
I love the idea when you phrase it like that. Then again I'll be rolling on a classic pvp first anyway - there's people I want to play with!

if it appears, it's gonna be april fools
---
Trying to get my gf to hit me with a lead pipe every morning to keep me unconscious till it comes out.
---
I was maxed out on cooking and more than maxed out on fishing. Will probably max out all three secondary professions again, get Fishing to 314 skill or whatever the max was, and max out two primary professions as well.
---
Split between Rogue, Mage or Warlock
---
Just got 70 on  a pserver, at least the 1-60 part was allot of fun. The old world just feels so much more alive then any other part of the game.

One more reason to listen to it. It.s really something to hear his strong voice again, experience his very special humor and having this strange lead in knowledge of all the things to come. Plus it bridges the time until release.
---
On top of what other ppl said, ferals need on a different loots in many pieces, so your prot wars and fwars gear up quicker. compared to if you had a fwar. needeing on both fwar gear adn weapons and protwar for offtanking.
---
ppl tend to forget, how few loot is in classic, and than you need to gear up a 40man raid.
---
Gonna rebuild my level 1 twink. 
---
You are going to get lost in BRD, even if you explored a cleared dungeon the week before, you will still find yourself in parts unknown the very next run into this maze.
---
You make it sound so simple though. Looking around at different resources tell a more complicated story. 
---
Seriously how weren't EU folks upset af about this back in the day?!

Not at my home PC, but I believe the file was datestamped January 2007 - so right before TBC I guess?

I don't see the achievements tab; I feel like the goblet button is quests? Not sure really, it was 12 years ago!

One day you'll be right... hopefully...

Private Ryan...
---
Gamers weren’t entitled little fuck whits then and releases being delayed by region wasn’t uncommon. 
---
Couole things: I was lucky enough to be in a guild that server firsted every raid. (Minus cthun, noone did it.) Aw bosses we're fun (minus huhu) everything else can die in a fire. 
---
My favorite: bwl. Good mix of difficulty, bosses per hour, theme and interaction.
---
ZG will probably be #1 as it was one of the most accessible raids for casual and hardcore alike.
---
Man totally agree. I have really fond memories of the Shimmering FLats in Thousand Needles for some reason. Just riding my lvl40 mount around in this giant, deserted expanse.
---
Yes you can but you'll need to get the titles on this toon since PvP titles aren't bound to acc
---
Mounting inside was nice too
---
Lel  
---
+1 
---
Not my experience : I was swimming in Myrmidon rings (I got 2 or 3), 2 epic bows (Hurricane I think) and a one handed axe (deep wounds or  deep woods).
---
But I was nolifing pretty bad those 2 years so maybe it's just a matter of playtime (I leveled 3 warriors, 1 mage, 1 rogue, 1 priest to lvl 60 and a lot of lower lvl alts).
---
Now that I think about it , I was complaining about my lack of luck at rolls in dungeons, so maybe unlucky in dungeons lucky with world drops :-)

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---

Hahaha omg the soul shards filling your bags!  Thanks for sharing.
---
The only complication is that people refuse to accept change. Druids behaved in 1.12 differently than in 1.2 and the raid meta changed greatly since then. For good players threat is more important than mitigation, which is where bears shine.
---
People in this forum are surprised that druids can even tank 5mans, which I've done regularly (even endgame ones!) and never felt that I was weaker then the warriors I've healed.
---
Obviously raids are different, but the only negative bears have is no crit immunity, but that is really overblown pre-AQ.
---
Victory Rush exemplifies everything wrong with modern WoW
---
back in the day we called your kind a carebear ;) but if its not your thing then its not your thing!
---
despite the frustrations of ganking i always go for pvp servers, i feel its the way the game was meant to be and it fits the lore and it gives you a sense of danger and excitement, as well as making the world feel alive
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
They don’t present at pax east.
---
It was more that i had tunnel vision on the health bars and my own placement than looking at what everyone else is doing. Grid  was nice thou . Could be made small enough and could track aproximate heals inc and all the info i needed at that time.
---
Polls don't take into account how many people will reroll when the gameplay fails to meet their expectation. 
---
Yeah, your plan to get nice gear (for Shadow, I presume) will probably turn out crappy. In raids, warlocks and mages will be prioritized for drops that you'll consider nice as a Shadow priest. As a priest, you'll be filling in the supporting/healing role, as you say, so there is little incentive for your raiding guild / raiding group to fork over DPS gear. 
---
All else considered, Shadow priest is a great class on a PvP server. The gearing process will be ass, though.
---
There is in fact AB at 29 and 39, just not in 19
---
i dint see the weekly thread
---
ferals need more healing from healers, since they take more damage, so as long as you healers has no problem to pump you up constantly wasting their consumables, ferals are fine. its really more about healers strangth inyour raid and how geared/prepared they are, than tanks.
---
Like my Uncle that works in Nintendo.
---
Because global launches weren't a normal thing back then.
---
No one knew how good the game is in first few months 
---
Yes, this is a good point. There's a quite a bit of otherwise pointless gear if you don't have a feral.
---
If they rerelease Defias I would roll there in a heartbeat make no mistake about it. First server I rolled on. 
---
Good joke.
---
God speed you magnificent bastard.
---
Death to gnomes.
---
FFFFFFFF they got me
---
LFM Aussies
---
Hey everyone, we're looking for more members, we're going to go Alliance on a PvP server, obviously Oceanic servers if we get them.
---
The ultimate goal is 40 man raids and PvP so class balance matters but we are not going to tell anyone what they have to play. With our raiding we're not going to be some hardcore guild aiming for server firsts or raiding every night, probably 2-3 nights a week and these nights and times will be decided upon what is best for the majority.
---
People have jobs, families, social lives etc so we aren't about to crack the shits if someone cant make every raid. Raid loot will probably end up DKP, it seems to be the fairest option. Other options can of course be looked at.
---
 PvP is also something that a fair few of us enjoy and have had some success at in Vanilla and various expansions. So we will be looking at doing regular premade groups. 
---
Regarding Officer/ Recruitment positions etc within the guild these are all up for grabs, be helpful and help promote the guild and you'll be one.
---
 As for the Guild name this will be voted on in the coming weeks. Come check us out on discord if you're keen [https://discord.gg/uEMtvEt](https://discord.gg/uEMtvEt) 
---
Starting a fight at camp Nessy when the BG's won't pop as a druid/shaman/hunter was the best.
---
Never any downtime.
---
Well sure, that is another complication. What I meant was merely that I think it's impossible to say that a feral is always beneficial but likewise ofc, it's not never beneficial.
---
I hadn't read this before but it's a pretty good summary of the topic which brings up both the good and the bad.
---

Maybe see you there!! 
---
They are good in all brackets.
---
OH MY GOD THIS IS A FUCKING APRIL FOOLS JOKE MY HEART JUST EXPLODED MON DIEU BAN THIS MAN 
---
Where is ubrs?
---
You will be surprised how harsh the PVP will be on a fresh server without BGs.
---
Every time you will encounter someone from the opposite faction it will be a fight.
---
If you come home from work and want to get a bit of pexing done and find yourself in the cross-hair of yet another asshole that want to emulate Angwe, prepare to spend some quality time at the graveyard and don't expect to accomplish much this evening.
---
Bring friends.
---
I wonder if there will be some sort of quest helper.
---
I just need to know what area to go to :p
---
Overpowered compared to the enemy team twinks? 
---
Sir, you appear confused 
---
Yeah thats a downside i forgot to mention.
---
The good thing is that if you use bear, he will generate more threat, which is more DPS in a good raid, which means fights are shorter, which means less healer mana consumption.
---
This only happens if your dps is threatcapped ofc, which SHOULD be the case, but not necessarily with a casual raid.
---
It will be between the 3rd week in June and the the 3rd week in September.  Prepare accordingly.
---
I wast eft to teareth thee a new one.  Valorous joketh thee tuck'r
---
No you cant 
---
I know :)
---
1. My understanding is Classic will launch with BGs already available. It's starting at 1.12 but will still play out the AQ and Naxx events, or so my understanding went.
---
2. My memory of levelling on a PvP server wasn't like this. You *did* have the people who'd gank as soon as possible but in many cases people tended to leave each other alone in questing areas unless there was a definite and lasting advantage (eg you're in a group and they're not) because all they do is die, res, and attack you when you pull a mob. The issue was people in quest zones that were there to gank, not quest, but they tended to be temporary and not super common anyway.
---
Skabb means Scabies in swedish so not a great name imo 
---
He was way worse than ladimore, and stronger. 
---
That would explain why I've not hard anything then lol! Thank you!

# &lt;Always East&gt;
---
**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we currently have 85 Discord members. Of those, 69 have identified what class and role they wish to play.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) The leadership has taken years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

The struggle not to give into an April's fools joke and write a long and thorough answer as to why all of your points are invalid is quite real. 
---
Patch 1.4, WF can no longer procs off itself
---
Patch 1.11, WF attack bonus reduced by *half*
---
Classic is permanently set on 1.12
---
Rip enhance shamans.
---
Pretty sure you never could display anything but current rank in vanilla.
---
If it is sharded, then yes. Precisely how it works in retail
---
Unfortunate
---
why that date specifically?
---
Mana dump, then white damage while mana regens is part of the leveling process for my priest, too. I'll just be using an axe instead of the wand.
---
Back in the day we called your kind derogatory assholes, glad that label still applies.
---
Also, Blizzard has come out and said that PvE servers are how the game was meant to be played, and are thusly the "normal" servers, whereas anything else is abnormal. Nice try to retconn and get the world to fit your opinion, though.
---
Oh my bad didn't see it was r/classic thougt it was retail. 
---
Yeah on vanilla it's impossible to show anything else than your actual rank
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you want high damage, not dps? If you have two weapons, lets say an axe and sword: Axe is 3.3 swing speed with high damage and lower dps, sword is 2.7 swing speed with lower damage and higher dps. You should stick with the axe, yeah? 
---
Where is BRD? ;) 
---
Can you give a link to the post? I dont mind waiting a few extra months to play it since I am gonna be a little busy during the summer anyways, but Id like to know more about this :l
---
Is here best bracket for them ?
---
It's hard to argue that a larger community adds to a better MMO experience, at least in terms of grouping &amp; running instances, raiding and PvP. 
---
*The idea that raiding in Vanilla was 40 retards showing up in whatever gear they happened to find themselves in and just throwing themselves at bosses to see what happened is utterly false.*
---
Not all of us obviously but for sure a lot of random crap was going on with people ....and funnier is that nobody was even questioning their stupidity.
---
As a guild that was progressing on C'thun at the time we realized this. We had a rogue always asking for spirit buff from priests...he thought that if spirit was regenerating mana, it must increase energy regeneration as well. He was doing that since ZG days when the guild formed...nobody ever wondered what was going on.
---
We had two guys who always used hearthstone instead of taking mage portals after a raid because they thought they are bugged. Instead of clicking the portal they were trying to run into the portal, thus nothing happening, they must have been broken right?
---
It's kinda cute if you think about it in retrospect...
---
I didn't even used SnD till Nefarian and played a PvP(cb-prep) guild because I seen some rogue on 'warcraft movies'...he did good so if numbers are good it must be good. Till some priest took the time to explain to me you have to play different builds for PvE.
---
We had a mage who had his fireball binded on space bar and on Thaddius he couldn't jump.
---
Fire mages in Molten core.
---
There were a lot of dumb things like this, we laught about it now but back then nobody even knew unless they came out saying something.
---
We got our shit together around AQ40-Ouro-Cthun but still...people were just cluless like that, it was a new game. Most people were not so elitists back then and everything about gaming was kinda casual
---
Damn snowflake, relax.
---
Signed, a fellow carebear
---
BWL easily, chromaggus progression was fun
---
Potions, cooking and bandages. 
---
As a druid I rather enjoyed harassing lowbies. I would  drop out of stealth and unload a moonfire or attack, then  suddenly disengage, leaving them wounded and paranoid but not having to corpse run. Against equal level players I would often get in close to the rear then stealth, leaving them paranoid. Druids play well to guerrilla combat and it was great for inciting hatred without provoking rage quits.
---
Obviously? I straight up ask what makes the game better than the current because I fear it won't be food. If you have nothing to contribute then why bother saying anything.
---
Naxx is WOTLK...
---
Sorry!! Forgot it because i always saw it more like a 10 man dungeon...

---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST, days TBD (likely Tues/Wed or Wed/Thurs, TBD by a guild vote)
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for all roles - even some nontraditional specs if you're an active, dedicated player. Having experience with the content isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary. With that said, there are some key positions we're looking to lock down before Classic launches - if you're interested in **leadership** positions and your overall goals align with ours, contact us.
---
**Contact**: If you want to have fun, clear content and be a top guild on the server, here's how to contact us:

Raid Times: 7-11pm Eastern. Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday
---
With the right group of people, a guild can progress competitively while putting in less time than we did back when we were young. We are actively searching for Raiders to fill out our ranks as we prepare for the launch of Classic servers. Not all of our members have played Vanilla before, but we do have Officers with experience up through Naxx. Unlike 14 years ago, most of us now have additional obligations that weren't present previously. We completely understand that real life comes first, but we do have expectations for all raiders.
---
If you’re applying to us, you’re looking to be an active member in our community. You understand your importance in a raid and will commit to being prepared and reliable. You may not necessarily have previous Vanilla raid experience, but you’ve ideally raided during BC or WotLK if you don’t have Vanilla raid experience. You’re a competitive person who plays the game for fun, but your idea of fun is excelling in all facets of the game. 
---
Some of our long-term goals are hosting 3+ raid groups that are self-managed. The leadership team of this guild is all for distributed authority. We want to serve as a guidance for other leaders and want everyone to hold themselves accountable. We're trying to build a large community of like-minded people. With a large community, we can facilitate fun things like large-scale PvP events and a variety of other things. To start though, we are focusing on building one solid raid group

Ubrs isn't a raid due to how the lockout works. 
---
&gt;This dude hits like a truck xD
---
BERZERKER!
---
There was a Vanilla Naxx released in patch 1.11
---
...should somebody tell him?
---
Beastslaying +2. You didn't get this for the stats, you got it because it made your weapon glow red!
---
My dad works for Microsoft and is going to hack you.
---
Technically not possible though :D It surely could have worked if your weapon speed matched the cast time but otherwise no. Even without interrupting it that wouldn't have been top dps though as steady shot was - at no point - #1 dmg / time 
---
I’m glad you’re so pro at wow levelling. But I guarantee anyone who hasn’t levelled to 60 before (or played classic in general) who picks warrior is going to die a lot. It’s too easy to allow it to happen.
---
REALLY enjoyed ZG &amp; BWL. Though I have to say I enjoyed all of them. Never got to clear AQ40 or Naxx though
---
Meh, Grand Marshall Warrior + Pally vs bunch of less than 60 horde not a great showcase of skill
---
You will be brain dead on WSG weeks, running the flag. This is the literal reason you get invited into the premade. You're meaning is to run the flag.
---
In AB, you will 100% be sitting at a base, defending, which honestly felt like a reward after wsg. SOMETIMES (if you can't break a shitter teams turtle at farm, then you get pulled to sit in bear form while you spam click the capture point, doing nothing else). 
---
That is 100% what you will be doing if you plan on getting the "epic" pvp gear. at least 8hrs a day, 5 days a week. If you aren't good, which honestly being good at a druid requires some insane skill/knowledge/gamesense (probably more-so than the other classes, maybe not rogue), then you'll have a bad time getting the epic pvp gear. Because, there will only be 1 druid in a premade, and he has to carry the premade in WSG. So if you're not carrying your team in WSG, then you will get replaced, because the whole point of premades is to farm extremely efficient honor. Unless, ofc, you make your own premade, but then you have to hope the best players want to play with you.
---
It's much much easier to just get the raid gear. But honestly the bis items come from rank13 and exalted with BG factions, until aq/naxx, and even then some of the items remain bis.
---
Just go watch one of [Stormx's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci5IbZbscaA) videos.
---
Memory most certainly wrong. And beast mastery was certainly more than this because you had to include those kill commands and aimed shots. That is excluding the cooldowns you'd use on top of that.
---
LOL DUDDE you never aim shot. YOUR memory is shit, total shit. Also, kill command was part of the steady shot macro. Literally a one button class. 
---
Yea, you just saw all the stupid rumors this sub posted. Any time there's anything, anywhere, everyone jumps on it assuming we'll get a release date, even if Blizzard isn't there... Just like the 100 posts we've had "I bet Blizzard is gonna announce the release date on April Fools 'as a joke' but then it's the real date! HAHA BRILLIANT BLIZZARD" like... people are just so desperate they stretch for anything.
---
weird flex but ok
---
and you don'T see him because of that Forlorn Rowe fog
---
You would certainly have to get SM cath shield and an offensive melee weapon for hitting (Hand of Righteouness or Ardent Custodian) and one to increase your spelldamage like Hypnotic Blade. 
---
But for when you roam around STV and you come upon a warlock cursing your tongue, meleeing + shocking might actually be quite awesome.

Can't believe there are people who take this seriously
---
Right at the end of my time in Legion I decided to give up on Healbot and try hover+click healing with the built-in frames.
---
Holy good god was it different. I liked it. It felt less like whack-a-mole and more like I was actually making decisions. I’ll be doing the same in Classic.
---
Why play a healer if you don't like to heal ? I have the same beef with the warriors that don't want to tank, roll  a rogue : it's better DPS and nobody expects anything from you :p
---
A healer is the most impactful person in a PVP encounter. If I played alliance and paladins were not so dull at farming mobs I would totally roll a healadin !
---
For the record I mained a warrior in Vanilla, I tanked and DPSed, had a blast healing on my priest alt, enjoyed DPSing on my mage, rogue and hunter alts (yes I had way too much playtime back then ;-).
---
U jelly tho
---
i know it's a great game with my fondest memories when i just cant pick a clear favourite  
---
what is more amazing is that i can't pick any of those that i hated
---
Oh now come on it wasn't that bad. You make it sound like there was a 10-12 minute trip to ride back to the chamber ;)
---
I have a work trip the same week.  We can cry together.
---
This post has really made me wonder what kind of person can actually reach rank 14 and if it’s even possible without account sharing lol. Like honestly it truly seems like it will wreck your life to get r14 and I am realizing I am not about that ha

Hello, my name is Larkonath and I am a Vanilla addict.

I remember when they left Medivh. The server crashing so much around the launch and high population caused a lot of the top progressive guilds to leave at that time.

It was a bug that made 1:1 as/ss powerful iirc. I know it was a thing just not the specifics. Been a long time since then. 
---
Spent the most time in BWL and MC, so I'm split a bit 50/50 there, but I voted MC in the end simply because it was such an overwhelming feeling the first time we pulled the giants at the start and got instantly deleted by them.
---
Onyxia was fine, but nothing too special. Bit too short for me.
---
ZG was pretty fun. Had some interesting bosses, and is a great raid to bond with guildies.
---
AQ20 was just a terrible, terrible raid. Hated it. Worst raid Blizzard have done in my opinion. Annoying and uninteresting bosses, the same boring, depressive, oppressive environment as AQ40 just a bit more open, but still bad.
---
AQ40 always felt oppressive and depressive, really didn't enjoy it at all. Some boss fights were ok, Twins, C'thun, Huhuran, the rest were boring. Really didn't need another gauntlet/suppression room either, it was enough to have one in BWL. AQ40 is almost as bad as AQ20, but it's saved by at least having some interesting bosses.
---
Naxx was the reason I decided to take my first long break from the game, so I can't really claim it was that fun for me, but I really enjoyed the setting and the bosses, but my consumable and repair costs simply were too high and I didn't have enough to farm it back so it stressed me out a lot. Great raid though.
---
I mean for the wipe run to Cthun and back, I can see it.
---
I loved the immersion and suspense of a RP-PVP realm. I’ll be really bummed out if they don’t bring those back.
---
I distinctly remember running through Strangletorn Vale on my level 34 dwarf paladin and fearing &lt;The Second Gurubashi Empire&gt;, a troll only guild, was patrolling the main road as they usually did. Before I knew it, I saw three trolls on their impressive raptor mounts, strawlin' at walking speed. The moment they saw me, they rushed head on towards me. I had nowhere to go.
---
After they were corpse camping me for a while, I got fed up and called in the help of my dwarven brethren of &lt;The Dwarven Rifle Squad&gt;. I still remember the glorious sight of those small bastards on their rams rushing over the hilltop to come to my aid.
---
You just don’t get these situations on either PvP or RP realms… You distinctly need RP-PvP
---
Please blizzard, I beg you, give us a RP-PvP realm (preferably at launch).
---
I couldn’t tell you how many times he killed me. I swear if you even look anywhere near Mor’Ladim’s direction he’ll charge halfway across the cemetery to murder you. 
---
Yeah a genuine april fools joke
---
I fully agree it would be cool! But that wont happen because HS is their TCG now ;)
---
&gt; I have a poor impression of pug raids 
---
I have a poor impression of PUG dungeons groups !
---
Aq40 cos it's a wild detour from the norm.
---
Which is the way most see it. Wouldn't really consider it a raid, since it's on a dungeon lockout.
---
I cant believe I'm saying this, but in a way he is kind of correct even if it was a joke. So many people didn't get to experience Naxx in vanilla, but on wotlk it was the first raid. Obviously it was vanilla raid before that, but most people voting on this for naxx being the best, really have no idea what it actually was. Its just reflection from the other one or just the idea of that raid.
---
Dwarf and what class?
---
Overedited and boring
---
Greetings, Classic Enthusiasts. I signed up over the weekend specifically to post in this thread.
---
**LOOKING FOR GUILD**
---
Region: NA/US
---
Server type: RP &gt; PVE &gt; PVP
---
Faction: Either
---
Raid Window: \~7:30-11:00pm Mountain (Fridays are ideal, plus one other weeknight)
---
About me: 40s, non-practicing attorney, wife and kid
---
General Philosophy: Have fun, kill stuff and the gear will take care of itself
---
What I bring: humor, maturity, stubbornness, above-average intelligence
---
Experience:
---
* Faction: 99% Horde
---
* Vanilla: Mostly warrior tanked 5-mans
---
* BC: Ran Karazhan as frost mage with my little guild before it dispanded (I was loot officer), then apped with a prominent raiding guild and did some 40s with them before deciding raiding wasn't for me
---
* Wrath: Mostly Pally tanked heroics
---
* Cata: leveled a troll druid to cap then got bored and quit the game
---
* MoP: played SWTOR 
---
* WoD: played GW2 
---
* Legion: Warrior tanked mythics through +9
---
* BfA: Completed Pathfinder 1 then got bored and quit
---
* Other: have also played/pugged with a MM hunter sporadically
---
Looking for Guild that:
---
* Is mature and relaxed
---
* Will respect my autonomy in game and out
---
* Has a strong core of friends/family
---
What I would like to do this time around is experience content I missed the first time around (raids) focus on a faction I haven't experienced (Alliance) and take on a roll I haven't played (healer). With that said, for the right guild I am able and willing to take on any role (except melee dps - it's not enjoyable to me and I suck at it) for either faction on any server type (even PVP *yuck*). 
---
If I seem like a good fit, please contact me via Discord: Beorog#0320
---
I remember that, and recently I wanted to recreate the experience of being in a world where there was practically no one around, no one to talk to, limited action, and a bare bones shell of what Classic was, so I jumped into the free BFA weekend.
---
Great threat generation, powerful taunt : he should be a tank !
---
Heh. "I love... hard, punishing things in general" 
---
I'd enjoy trying the TCG while offline.
---
The wonderful Zaricotl, the Mor'Ladim of Badlands
---
EU was, especially after the game was released and all raids and big content patches was released 1 day earlier in US.
---
But we had beta to play, so we could play. So we were that left out.
---
Which nets like 20-25g an hour and isn't what the guy above me is talking about. 
---
Nah it's the "very funny" tags on threads I think. 
---
That would lead to people passing on gear they could use and should probably take in order to stay at 10 point to reserve the really good stuff. 
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
​
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
*P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.*
---

---
We once did mc, bwl, zg, aq20, aq40 and onyxia in a single saturday. It's going to be easier once people get some gear. Strats have been out for so long that people should be able to fly through the content instead of bumbling through it like we did in vanilla. 
---
did not raid in classic, still voted. check mate!
---
You’ll be better in PvE, though.
---
hahaha
---
&gt;That said, do note that in Vanilla we had 4:3 displays
---
I realized the other day that my second monitor was the same 16:10 display that I bought a bit before Vanilla, wondering if those thin screens were durable enough considering the exorbitant price.
---
Yes they are ;-)
---
Stranglethorn: where boys become men. 
---
such a hard choice. love them all!
---
Well it's ok then, no need to argue with you.
---
If you call a MACRO a one button class then every single class at every single point in this game could have been a one button class...
---
And Aimed Shot was a thing if you were going for world top parses. But it's ok if you insist on this being a false statement.
---
We don't really have to argue about a bug that made it possible to basically exploit the game for a couple of weeks when making a general statement, do we?
---
derogatory assholes?  calm down it was just a bit of banter
---
why do you think the game was originally set up so that towns could be captured and overturned to the other faction?  doesn't seem very PvE focused to me.  the whole premise of world of warcraft is that the WAR part is key, otherwise there's no reason for it to exist lol 
---
where do blizz say its meant to be PvE though?  i'm not saying i doubt you, i just never heard that
---
I think the date announcement will be this month with release in July. Any later and they're gonna start testing people's patience on the "summer 2019" date. 
---
June would be just swell, though. 
---
He and the guy inside the house.  
---
(Invuln if you don’t got the sceptre).  Is what’s makes it extra fun 
---
As a rogue who was often top DPS in tbc and wrath with the default UI (id ask others for their charts because i was so confident),  I agree!
---
Thank you a lot for clearing this kind of stuff up for me. I might have to be a healer up to AQ atleast. 
---
I don't have that much of possible gametime anymore so I wont reach BIS gear but I simply want to have enough gear to be able to play PvP/World PvP properly.
---
Oh yeah. I hope the loading times will be as quick as they are on pservers. If you got a kinda good rig, you're looking at loading times of 2-3 seconds at max, even to cities with lots of population. One thing that annoys me like hell on retail. 
---
Also how did you survive that long with only one monitor mate? It's about time! Such a QoL improvement. 
---
Could have been said better, but it's true. Look at your dislikes. Don't tell others how they should play. People will do things because they want to.
---
It depends. If you’re questing in an area and an enemy is nearby, you can attack him if you are bloodthirsty. He will then likely respawn and counterattack you, which will likely to repeat for a while. This can be fun, but will slow down your questing a lot.
---
If you just want to level, do not attack him. If he leaves you alone, you both quest in peace.
---
If you want to get effective leveling and some PvP, be peaceful until you are about to leave the area. Then gank the poor fellow. As he returns to exact his revenge, you are already flying to a different zone. :)
---
They should make at least 1 for US and 1 for EU. Just use the server that would be a RP one and make it RP-PvP. It's not like it take them more money to do so
---
Teleporting to capitals as mage with no loading screen feels very good on pservers.
---
I’ll second the call for eng if you plan to pvp at all or plan to play on a pvp server.
---
i was right about to have my very first nerd rage in like 15 years when i read the title, i loved this day when i was younger. now just please make it end
---
Stay BACK. I've been gotten THREE TIMES TODAY. By my brother, my father, AND MYSELF.
---
(Myself: Slept in thinking it was a Tuesday, was almost late for class.)
---
Wouldn’t it be wild if one day you wake up and they just surprise drop it on us with no warning? I’d actually be so okay with that 
---
My annual leave has just reset. I'm fucking ready for a release date! 
---
Trolls have the best racials for PvE.
---
IF you want to PvP on your shaman, then you'll be picking the worst race of the 3 for sure. But it's not like it will make you lose all your battles.
---
Also, there's no ranked arenas in vanilla so the only ranking you'll be doing is the rank 14 one, and I'm pretty sure no one would kick you from a premade just because you are a Troll.

Like the rank 8 "blue set" isn't BAD or anything, and it is really easy to get rank 8 from casual bgs. And while you're doing that you gain rep towards REALLY good epic/blue items from WSG faction and the AB faction. So you could easily do rank 8, then after that work toward getting exalted with WSG/AB, and then you might hit rank 11 on the way to that, which is actually VERY doable casually pvping, so you could pick up epic mount as well for free.
---
So this! I love how Blizz is going into great detail getting all the game mechanics as they were, but are having the modern UI, especially the raid frames. I have to give them credit for making a built in system that is so good you don't want to use addons.
---
You kill them and hope they cry on the forums/reddit. It makes everything even more fun.
---
Does anyone recall if this ahole is shackleable?  
---
Berserking - more hits= more procs?
---
&gt; 3- 1v1 fair wpvp
---
Why not roll on a PvE server and duel outside Orgrimmar/Ironforge?
---
September really isn't Summer. that's the beginnings of Fall. August is the latest they could release and still say it was Summer.
---
I'd totally be surprised with September.
---
They also have some niche situations where their huge tps is useful.
---
In the last pserver I played we used a feral with a pummelr as the 1st vael tank to speed up the first few seconds and prevent one warrior from losing all world buffs.
---
They also pull faster than warriors, with faerie fire, but that can be solved with a good hunter and decent coordination.
---
They also don't need warrior gear, so your warrior offtanks won't have to split as much gear.
---
Nope, because I can hack PvP at 60 without having a gargantuan gear discrepancy to give me an edge.
---
I’ll be doing 49 twink S on all characters. 
---
Yea i can see the specs issue honestly, but a lot of classes are like that i feel like. And its a lot of fun lto have different play styles 
---
Poor thrall... used to be such a badass til he respecced to elemental and put on a dress.
---
I'm surprised ZG is #1. O\_o 
---
I thought it will be BWL.
---
Yea i get that, what i was saying was that im not at all bothered with spamming frostbolts if auto shot weaving is concidered the epitemy of engaging pve gameplay. But i can see both perspectives honestly
---
Well nobody raids 3-4 times a week just to finish MC or BWL. I believe he meant AQ and Naxx.
---
 **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would be between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Francis was, at least...
---
BRD, UBRS, LBRS, Stratholme... Even deadmines were raids too
---
They just rolled on US servers
---
It will be like in Vanilla. If the new animations are even available, they will be optional.
---
You can still play it. Plenty of places to buy the cards.
---
It’s fun to AoE the mob that they’re struggling with only to kill them too. 
---
You had to do this multiple times.
---
The first week the honor system came out, people thought it was just one week so they did a fuckton of world pvp and it was basically impossible on pvp servers to get anything done (I think this was even before dishonorable kills, I could be mistaken).
---
The most people got to were like rank 3. To get to rank 14 you needed several weeks at the top starting from like rank 6.
---
Thats kinda my point.. that it could be delayed
---
Guess everyone will be playing on us servers then... Easy as that
---
Yeah I’ll be on a PvP server but what is there in the Vanilla Engi toolkit? 
---
I didn’t dable in it until around cata time when I found out you can use the parachute with tour disengage for extra kity goodness 😂
---
AQ20
---
The core aspect of vanilla raiding, which sets it apart from every other expansion, is that it's a numbers game. For every raid from MC through Naxxramas guilds are required to assemble 40 players with decent gear who can put out the necessary numbers week after week after week.
---
Combined with the fact that gear progression is MUCH slower and that grinding consumables is fairly time-intensive, guilds will struggle to keep an active roster for a long time. This is less of a problem for hardcore guilds who clear the raids without wiping and losing world buffs. However, for mid-level guilds who will routinely wipe to whelps in BWL, C'thun and Four Horsemen, this can lead to four+ hour raid nights, exacerbating the strain on raid members.
---
These difficulties have not changed at all, and they are the reason why all decently populated private vanilla servers have dynamic raiding environments. So while server-first BWL clears will likely be 50-ish minutes, no-wipe speedruns by top-server guilds, this does not really impact the longevity of classic raiding for the majority of players.
---
DUH this law might, yeah it only might, start at least two years from now on...
---
lol
---
That's not a guarantee, and isn't possible (without changes) for something like 6 weeks.
---
pug 5mans are so much easier to manage
---
If they plan on delaying, they shouldn't delay it a month. Delays should be seriously considered, and only over either omni-presence of bugs that ruin the feel of the game, or larger design or conceptual issues.
---
The fact that they have doubled down on Summer 2019 AND the fact that delays are big deals, I doubt that we'll see Classic in September. They'd need more time than a month after they can already release the game if the problems are large enough to warrant a delay. Otherwise, they'll just wait until August and tell us in May.
---
Difficult decision between BWL and ZG. I mean I like BWL more but those goblin track packs get fucking tedious especially when you're running BWL twice a week...
---
ZG has the mounts. And nicer scenery and was always an off-day fun-raid for alts in my guild so I enjoy it more because of that. But mostly the mounts :D
---
Would be interested but my group of 12 or so players is heavily EST and we just can't be up until 2 am on a weeknight. Any flexibility in those raid times?
---
You don't really bring a feral dps as an offtank, they don't have the ability to tank effectively in a raid while in their pure dps spec, warriors are way better at that.
---
However they do make decent 2nd or 3rd tanks in full tank build. (Replacing a prot warrior or a fury prot, the guys who are usually there either tanking adds or dpsing in their tank gear just in case, wielding a nightfall to help the raid).
---
Very nice tips here. Appreciate it.
---
I would love to raid, the thing is I don't think I have the time for it. I could maybe squeeze in a day or two a week for raids but I can't have these 4-5 hour sittings anymore.
---
But, since sometime, MC and BWL will go on farm (faster runs) I might be able to follow on those. 
---
I aint aiming for something hardcore, just don't want to be stuck in blues forever.
---
LBRS and UBRS is the same dungeon, with a single portal in vanilla. You either ascend through the opened door for UBRS or descend to LBRS, from the portal.
---
UBRS/LBRS was uncapped, then capped at 15, then capped at 10. And LBRS quests always required a 5 man group to be completed.
---
A good example/counter example is [Qizmo](https://youtu.be/w4NeirAswcU)  who start a fight, as a rank 13 Druid, against 2 undergeared rogues (not even 60), manage to kill them but get finished by an undergeared Druid. Any other class with this gear difference would have killed the 3.
---
In the rest of the video, he is winning.
---
Even tho this sounds alittle bit to easy, I do like it hehe.
---
West fall comes pretty close tbh.
---
“It’s VC not DM...” turning into an argument about politics and the universe, etc.
---
Well I need another wife to be able to play instances .
---
Anything can happen when my phone goes wild.

Looking for Alliance / PvP/ NA East players to level with. My favorite part of vanilla was my server community and I'm looking for other community minded individuals to roll on the same server. I'm taking 2 weeks off work at launch and I intend on raiding as an off-tank but don't need to find a guild prior to launch. At this point I'm just looking for others with a passion for vanilla wow and the community aspect of game. I'm responsible for picking a server for my IRL friend/family group so if anyone is looking for a diverse group (we have hardcore/casual and experienced/noobs in my IRL group) of ppl to play with let me know! When the time comes we will be picking a server with the following traits:
---
* Alliance / PvP/ NA East
---
* Avoiding servers with popular streamers/content creators - we feel like the fanbase behind these individuals will skew the vanilla experience. Our concern is that the fanbase will result in the server being focused around the stream and not around the server community
---
* Avoiding servers with uber hardcore guilds aiming for world first kills - some of our IRL members have experiences with pserver raiding and the win at all cost attitude can really pollute a server
---
Please send me a message if you are an individual or represent a group (not necessarily a guild) that is looking for a leveling group with similar server traits :)
---
This really cannot be understated. Do not even think of a shadow priest if you don’t like the idea of drinking to fill up on mana as much as fighting...more than a mage. If you do want to blow up stuff fast, it can be fun but I seriously recommend Undead or forget it.  Also, you will definitely notice when you get enough healing + magic dmg (not showdow specific) that you’ll be giving up one of the most powerful healers in the game, or spending a metric fuckton of gold to respec. And then, shadow is terrible farming.  If you want to PvP and PvE and be very good at both, go Disc w/ mana burn talents. Raid leaders like the 31 point disc talent to put on mages, it’s a good utility. In PvP you will CRUSH shadow priests as disc. Not even close.  Honestly though, you will like 21/30 the best overall as it does good BG healing, awesome in raids, and decent farming, saves respec money too. 
---
Looking For Guild:
---
* Intended region: NA
---
* Intended server type: PVP
---
* Intended faction: Horde

* Intended raid/play times: 10:00pm-12/1:00am EST Sunday-Thursday
---
Horde Warlock LFG that starts no earlier than 10:00pm EST. I have been raiding on private servers consistently over the last 10 years and have been a part of various server first kills. I have experience in leadership/GM roles on both private servers and retail.
---
I see it as a problem that a group of players can orchestrate the banning of another player.
---
You understand the point completely, so take your candy-ass patronizing "sure" and shove it up your ass.
---
Ah yes the ol' OP Oooops
---
Finally, I was waiting all morning for this!
---
Those people need a calendar.  There are 2 months of summer after july.
---
I'm in love.
---
If you roll priest (really any clothie), BFD has a stupid good wand.
---
You don't get the gear with normal groups. And you get a 60 friend to run the dungeons with you. You are only there for the boss kills, not trash. At least that's the way I did it back then.
---
Because it's a game, and there are other real matters to be mad about.
---
Kill em young so they never grow to be a threat
---
This reminds me of the first time I went to org. My PC crashed.
---
Why bother answering? Equally pointless it would seem.
---
My point is that if you asked this question to everyone on this planet, 99.9% of the answers would be "it's not better, you should do something else". Does that mean it's *not* a better game than retail? Not necessarily, but only you can answer that. If I told you that eating rusty nails is the best thing ever, would that make it fun for you? Of course not. So why would someone saying Classic WoW will be fun affect what you think of it? Well the simple answer is that it won't. You either like it or you don't, for reasons that are entirely your own.
---
I expect there's a massive overlap between the twink community and the classic community. 
---
Definitely bwl. You're raiding a castle, on top of a volcano, fighting dragons. There is no greater fantasy. The tier of sets are the best in the game for looks. It was hard enough to need good focus and prepared people but easy enough it was achievable. MC was amazing too everyone remembers seeing ragnaros for the first time. Wipe a ton on domo only for him to get one shot by rag was a heavy gulp moment for me. Never cared for either AQ the theme and look of everything from bosses to gear isnt my thing and it was stupid out of the way in location. Granted i was ally so bwl and mc were in my backyard and my guild never ended up full clearing anything beyond bwl. Still say bwl was my favorite.
---
wow this brings back so many memories! Haha your journey reminds me of mine so much. Also ran a Human Warlock, had full tier 1 in the end as well. Even seeing that old staffs attached was like "omg I used to use that!" haha. 
---
Ah can't wait for classic.
---
I hear you. I don't know if it's specific to pservers, but even spamming one single spell has a certain technique to it. If you physically spam it, you lose like 0.2 seconds PER cast, which really has noticeable impact (because somehow it registers the spam as "delay"). You need to press the ability exactly after the previous spell has finished to not lose any time. I guess if that is the case on classic as well, it'll just become muscle memory over time though. 
---
I guess how my character will look when he's fully geared matters more to me than the rotation-part. But the class/spec also needs to be *good*, which is why I can't roll a ret pally, even though their t2 looks fucking amazing. But we'll see how serious raiding will turn out in the end. If people are chill since the content is already known, I'll definitely think about going pally at some point. 
---
Choices suck, man. Especially these ones. 
---
I prefer "blue is goo"
---
release the goddamn game before I piss myself
---
Upvoted just for the Miss Cleo tag.
---
Most mages don't know they need to rotate ignite
---
Bit of a side rant, but I can’t get over how many people humble brag in general when they get killed in WPvP.
---
“Oh &lt;opposite faction&gt; can’t 1v1 me, took 5 of them to kill me.”
---
I’ve played both sides extensively and you’re guaranteed to see it on both sides in every PvP hotspot in the world.
---
I don’t understand how people’s egos can’t handle losing and have to assign blame on something.  Beyond that, no one in the zone knows (or cares) that you died.
---
While you're technically not wrong, saying things like "look forward to a Classic summer" kind of implies that you will be able to enjoy it *during* summer, not that it comes out on the last day of the season \^\^
---
Grenades that stun, goblin rocket helm, reflector trinkets, gnomish death ray, gnomish mind control cap, dense dynamite, goblin sapper charge, gnomish net, battle chicken, arcanite dragonling, goblin jumper cables and many more.
---
In all likelihood we will get 1.12 versions. 
---
Druids are good at spinning flags/guarding flags with Rogues.
---
Gnome warlock that I got to like level 5 before switching.
---
I remember being amazed that demon skin lasted thirty minutes. For some reason I thought it was supposed to last like 15 seconds as some sort of oh-shit button.
---
Ah, poor little carebear got his feelings hurt.
---
Ah, okay. At least the payoff is acknowledged, but the grind to the top of the mountain itself is the deterrent. Yeah, it can be a time sink, for sure. The D.p.S. classes have more forgiving gear than the tank or healer.
---
Haven’t seen it mentioned before. Also, not sure when the fishing event will be launched.
---
Well, we sort of got our revenge later when time zones worked in our favour :p
---
STV is a big one like you mentioned. TM often pops with WPvP. Ashenvale and Stonetalon have also given me headaches (both were camped by 60's so probably not right away)
---
After level 40 though your class (read: most classes, qq moar warrior) either has the ability to fight back effectively, or run away in my experience so it's not as big of a deal. Like other people mentioned, stick to your group, play a (slight retch) stealth class, or ignore\\be nice to ally.
---
STVietnam
---
My best guesstimate would say EST time zone for high population servers.
---
I'm so out of the loop with retail. My reaction to this screenshot was: Oh you can play goblins now..
---
You cannot display your lower PvP ranks in Classic and TBC,they added that in Wrath.
---
Oh man. My heart skipped like 4 beats. You almost killed me... 😂
---
I wasn't saying I preferred PUG dungeons to PUG raids, I just hate PUG everything, including PUG BGs !
---
Depending where you live and how you're determining it, but sure, I just mean that if they're going to release it any later than July they should really get ahead of it rather than waiting even longer to let us know. I still believe that "a classic summer" implies we'll be playing it *during* the summer, not at the end of it.
---
Hah! Now clicking this post wasn't entirely worthless. Thanks ;)
---
Naw man, release is in June. I have a work trip 3rd week in June so guaranteed to drop that week, probably like, 6/20
---
Ah, I was just giving a single example snapshot. It's been over a decade since I leveled my vanilla warrior, and preferring a number of Scarlet Monastery runs over being a completionist in Stranglethorn Vale really jumped out in my memory as an example of doing exactly the sort of thing it sounded like you were advocating.
---
Won't be there at launch. In the future you might see slow progress servers, who knows - for now we haven't even got RP-PVP. 
---

---
 Beep Boop, I am a bot!
---
druids can easily tank in raids as well, some bosses even better than warriors. its better on alliance, but also viable on horde.
---
And herbalism for the heal. They also had that brief time where you could get the upgraded leg enhancements. I forget what they were called. 
---
cat durid is 4 fyte
---
I played on a private server, can’t even remember name or time, but this option for rogue was insane in pvp. Don’t remember seeing a warrior. Again.. Private server.. My rogue could kill anything through a cheap shot and a kidney. Fiery would proc every hit, and with slice n dice up the damage was really addicting and hilarious. 
---
The server was constantly based in Alterac Valley, and the alliance and horde would dish it out in the middle open Icy area. Your armor and weapon vendors were at the Alliance first mini boss in AV. Not sure if anyone remembers this server. 
---
I would love this. I had a blast playing the dungeons and raids with friends/family. To this day they are on my bookself with my wow atlas https://ibb.co/9Tjkkx8
---
Agreed,  very much want an RP PvP. Please don’t fork us. 
---
At first, I didn't care all that much because my country isn't in the EU, but the panic attack slowly crept in as I realized that I play in the EU region.
---
I wanted it so I could sell it to a vendor for gold. Vendorstrike

Don't tell this to anyone, but Memestrike actually gives you +9999 on all stats when you equip it. It just doesn't tell you on the card.

A friend and I are looking for a Horde NA PvP guild that focuses on PvP. We both got to high warlord in vanilla and look to do that again. He is going to main Rogue, with a mage on the side. I am currently looking to play lock. He isnt looking to do much PVE content, but I am so I am open to playing another class for raids. preferably heals (I am a big fan of shaman) We are both East Coast. 
---
I would wait. Join the server that fits your time zone. Play the game and interact with the people in it. Join the guild that welcomes you in. It's a much better experience.
---
I recognized your ingame nick, then I saw your reddit name. Checked guild name. Is this Mazrigos EU? 
---
They had plainsrunning instead of using mounts 
---
You miss this when you opened the sub?
---

---
29 preist probably
---
They could use all mounts
---
You're thinking of beta
---
I guess you're right about it not being part of the launch. But, I sure hope they add a few slow progress servers and a few RP-PVP servers as well.
---
Or the weekend before when I'm at a festival. At least it'd be a good distraction...
---
I've flaired this post with my internal feelings.
---
Mazrigos indeed
---
Relatively orc has bigger shoulders than Tauren. 
---
Carebear isn't a term of endearment, it's a derogatory slur.
---
And why do you think PvE realms are called "normal" and PvP realms aren't?
---
June would be amazing but i think it will be later. 16 july still would be Nice 
---
Most fishing pools should be available on launch with the exception of Sagefish (and Rumsey Rum drops) until AQ patch. Specifically, Nightfin should be available on launch and can be fished from 12:00AM-6:00AM. Also, firefin and greater firepower and available but not really desired until AQ because everyone is specced frost before then.
---
Less than 50%, but definitely above 0%.
---
What I did of Naxx would make it my favourate on Mechanics alone. Its just awesome.
---
Otherwise BWL
---
1. run
---
2. stealth
---
And the Black War PVP mounts 
---
No Changes!!
---
AQ really took the atmosphere/ambience to the next level.  Both AQ20 and AQ40 were great, but AQ40's giant corridors and enemies were really intimidating.  The only downside was the linear design made running back a chore -- I think this fed into the wing design of Naxx and later raids.
---
ZG has some of the best boss mechanics and was the most accessible to casuals (despite being harder in many ways than MC and BWL), so I'm not surprised it's leading the poll.
---
Ayyyy buddy 
---
It wouldn't be correct even then. Article 13 concerns content hosts. Blizzard doesn't host addons, they're distributed through 3rd party services.
---
Twitch or WowInterface could be affected, but not WoW
---
Kel'Thuzad specific addon iirc
---
&gt; They don't provide any group buffs and their damage is less than that of a fury offtank?
---
They bring an off-tank that is not going to soak up warrior loot
---
I leveled 3 Rogues in my time playing from late Vanilla through Wrath.  I always went straight to swords as soon as I could.
---
Luckily swords are pretty common while leveling, so it's a safe bet as far as mainhand weapon relevance goes.  For the offhand another sword is great for those tasty Sword Spec procs, but it can also be a nice quality of life thing to use something else there to keep your various weapon skills up.  I'd say run swords, and if you find a significant DPS upgrade for your offhand and want to use it to keep your dagger or mace skill up to date it wouldn't be the end of the world.
---
This is a running joke on vanilla private servers
---
Please don't lose your minds 
---
Well, Stalin, Mao and Hitler preferred living during the night and sleeping throughout the day. Just throwing it out there!
---
Jokes aside (though they're true by the way), I once a long while ago lived like that. It takes a long time to turn that around, if you've lived like that for so long. Like, really long. You've no idea how long until you do.
---
If someone ever grants me the opportunity to do night shift work for much better pay, I will *never* take it. Worst thing I could do for my health.
---
You're right about raids going on farm. A LOT of guilds end up doing AQ -&gt; BWL -&gt; MC in one night, around 3-4hours max. It's kinda one of those things where you put in time up front to save a ton of time later.
---
An avg guild will do MC in 1 1/2 hrs, BWL in 1 1/2 hrs, and AQ in about 3+ hrs. Avg speedy bois will do MC in &lt;40mins, BWL in &lt;1hr, and AQ in &lt;2hrs.
---
You could try to join one of those guilds. Not many druids are in those runs, like maybe 3. But getting 40 people is always a challenge.
---
I dont know about this.  Retail community is shockingly toxic.  Arent these the same folks that will play in Classic?
---
And do they suddenly start behaving themselves in Classic because of the lack of anonymity? 
---
And if thats the only reason they behave themselves, what does that say about the core of the community?
---
Im hoping a 35+ year old crowd will dominate the game and folks have matured and grown up.  End the toxicity.  
---
Otherwise faith in the humanity of the internet is lost.  
---
Ewok is sad because his trombone is being judged by the giant skyface
---
If you actually tried to get top parses you were using a macro, dummy. Otherwise it's like going into a competition where steroids are encouraged and you decide to go natural. Makes no sense.
---
Why put a rumor and speculation on the side bar?
---
July 16th. There you go
---
Suffering leads to a feeling of greater reward.  It's human nature.  
---
wtf is the troll doing at 0:40
---
strafing isnt a thing here lmao
---
You had me.
---
it does not really matter what weapon type you use, cause while leveling the specialisations do not really matter. you just want a slow mainhand for high skill damage and a fast offhand for more poison proccs. normally slow weapons are mace/sword and fast weapons are dagger/sword. 
---
**&lt;ThunderCats&gt;**
---
NA | PvP | Alliance 
---
**Main Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesday: 9-12 EST
---
Wednesday: 9-12 EST
---
**About Us:**
---
ThunderCats is a group of Vanilla veterans aiming to compete with the best raiding guilds in Vanilla.  While we are first and foremost a progression-focused raiding guild, we plan to have fun outside raids with guild premades, open world events, and alts.
---
**Who we are looking for:**
---
* Reliable raiders who can consistently perform at a high level.  This includes preparation such as consumables and enchants.
---
* Players who are willing to accept constructive feedback on performance and make adjustments
---
* Team players who are committed to a fun and productive raiding environment
---
* A transparent loot council system based on raider preference and guild needs, with item priorities published ahead of raids in a viewable spreadsheet
---
* Experienced Vanilla leadership and raiding strategies
---
* ThunderCats theme song before raids
---
* A community for vanilla wow beyond raiding
---
**Join us on discord:** https://discord.gg/3Nbq2g2
---
Daggers are only really useful for backstab spamming and while leveling it's not incredibly easy to get behind your target consistently.  So swords would make leveling easier, yes.
---
It'll be august.
---
Thats technically still summer in Blizzards eyes.
---
It has been the date they've always released "summer" products on in the past as it avoids the school holidays for most country's.
---
I'll throw out a random number: 17th.
---
Any class, really.  
---
Dwarves dominate via their extremly good looking body  
---
Naxx, because of lore, atmosphere and music.
---
Dadzeroth?
---
I think blizzard has very good data on what happens when players run out of things to do in game.  Too long between content releases and sub numbers begin to dip, so I don't think they actually would make more money by stretching out the time line to accommodate the slowest of their players.  But only they have the concrete numbers.
---
As a former MT,
---
ZG - A great 20-man but tanked it so many times I got burnt out fast.
---
AQ20 - Fuck this place - Tanked it every reset for MONTHS trying to get that damn BiS crossbow off Ossirian. Fuck that guy and his shitty drop rate. I am still salty how long I had to grind that shithole.
---
Onyxia- No matter how many times I tanked it (even on two separate tanks per reset), it was always a fun fight especially as MT. You feel like a king and as horde - stance dancing is fun.
---
Molten Core - After nearly a year straight of farming this shit for bindings - I'll never forget when Geddon finally dropped my left binding. If it wasn't for thunderfury, I would never step foot back in here, too burnt out.
---
BWL - Speed clearing this shit was fun as hell. Top those meters boys. DW tanking vael spamming execute was fun as shit to push your TPS through the roof to stay ahead of the fury warrs. Good times.
---
AQ40 - C'thun - no matter how many elite players you have - he can still fuck your shit up because all it takes is one retard out of position to wipe everyone. Tanking Ouro is a bitch tho
---
Naxx - My personal favorite most likely since you run it the least out of everything else so I couldn't get burnt out on it. I love the lore and tanking in there is fun as hell.
---
It is subjective.
---
A lot of servers where not in the very timezone the realm was set to for example.
---
Check out this list for a look at how spread out and varied they where
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas\_region\_realm\_list\_by\_datacenter](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas_region_realm_list_by_datacenter)
---
Still 10% until 80% health . Scales linerly until 20% health which it caps at 30%. 
---
Source: I know things mon
---
Go as soon as possible. Probably before going to barrens.
---
Swords are better if you play solo a lot. Go daggers if you plan on playing with a group a lot.
---
In groups you will be backstabbin a lot more. In solo play your dmg mostly comes from white dmg and sinister strike. Swords have a higher max dmg then daggers.
---
It always pops up that a slow high dmg 1hander is good for mainhand and a fast weapon in offhand. That used to be a thing in vanilla when I leveled my rogue. Dont know if that still applies tho.
---
I used to solo Orgrimmar on my Grand Marshal paladin...
---
Except I just stood on the auction house and RP danced.
---
They won't delay to Fall, just to the last day of Summer.
---
Nice job!
---
You searched? We just talked about this yesterday. Your searchfu needs leveling my friend :)
---
As /u/-Atlan\- said we will most likely be getting the 1.12 version. After the cap was reduced to 5 man.
---
I very much doubt we will see something like that. If one group gets server just for them then what about other groups? People will want racing servers with fast progress, no bgs pvp servers and so on and on. Splitting playerbase to make each group comfy is just a bad idea.
---
10 hours in a month? You’re gunna have to get those numbers up, champ!
---
Surely there has been at some point in time at least *one* April Fools joke that actually killed a person, because this one got very close.
---
They didn’t nerf it, they fixed it. The original version with the insane density was not intended and fixed. We will not see that version in Classic. Besides, nobody wants 7 hour Scholomamce runs (it literally took that long until they fixed it).
---
I see you tucked the BJ card out of site. 
---
Sorry, just joking. You obviously redeemed it straight away.
---
Mining will most likely be a huge pain in the ass in the beginning. I intend to do a similar thing but I'm just going to grind gold at 60 to max out engi.
---
Ok sure, but what if you are a PvE player and you don't have the time to respect your Prot warrior or healer hybrid to PvP?
---
Its fun to be able to play in a different meta of the lower level brackets against other twinks when there are no mounts, 31 pt talents, etc.  
---
Oh for sure, any enhance shaman would have a weapon swap macro ready for a shield when they get jumped.
---
This is true, however you shouldn’t use a dagger mainhand unless you’re using backstab. Assuming frontstabbing won’t work, you really shouldn’t be using daggers to level. 
---
When weapon speed was normalised daggers we’re set to a much faster speed (1.5 from memory, but this could be off), so the bonus you get from attack power when using sinister strike is much less than with swords/maces
---
Oh I intend to use it on her once she thinks she's burned out. ;)
---
Do you know where i can find mankriks wife?
---
Plenty of people level Engi through AH only. Since you're playing a hunter you can get to 60 before most people and quickly farm up some gold. It's still gonna cost you a pretty penny. You alternative, like you say, is to get both, but then you have to constantly flip your node tracker back and forth while traveling which can get old fast. 
---
Can you elaborate on the engineering part? What do you mean you can just skip some boss mechanics?
---
I am fairly positive that they will anounce release date this month for July 16. I don't have any credible source to share but I think that will be it. Any longer than that I will be surprised, unless they shower us with blue posts.
---
Leveling mining amd herbalism would be a pain because you cant track both at the same time in classic, unless there is an addon I'm unaware of.
---
Why not go skinning/mining from the start and save up all the mats to powerlevel engi at 60.
---
As far as cost, that depends on how effectively you farm.
---
Actually the flesh golem guy stitches or what his name is kills more.  As he runs along the road towards town.  And roads are often good places to go. AFK.  ;) 
---
This is me questing on warmode all the time lol
---
This is the route I am going?
---
They’ll present next weekend back in the US. Check their website, Blizzard is a late edition to the lineup 
---
The demo had sharding but the chat wasn't sharded, right?
---
That's a genre I've actually never heard. No melody, no actual lyrics, no sense of rhythm. 
---
Here here!! I had posted something like this but the mod bot flagged it and removed it LOL
---
I have chuckled several times this morning reading the titles then the tags.
---
ok then, ppl can have different i guess
---
A few mechanics I haven't seen discussed yet is that:
---
1.) You only have one "spec" and do not have two pages of talents you can flip between at will
---
2.) Damaging spell power and healing spell power were not consolidated into a single "spell power" stat in the original game, so you will have either weak heals in your shadow gear, or weak shadow in your healing gear.
---
3.) Classic WoW wouldn't let you cast holy spells in shadow form, so you had to leave shadow form in order to access them, so going shadow/holy split with most talents in shadow doesn't seem viable, from my standpoint.
---
Collect gear sets from both shadow and holy, and switch occasionally when you will be doing long grinding sessions of either PvE or PvP, as re-spec'ing your talents increases how expensive the process is each time you do it in a short span (with a decay that eventually returns the process to its base price over real time). This discourages willy nilly re-spec'ing. Shadow is, as people have stated, very viable PvP with the right gear. Please just try to use etiquette and roll on gear only for the role you're presently filling in a party of strangers, i.e. don't heal as holy but try to take damage cloth if you have a mage or warlock in your party who has *only* a damage spec. 
---
Literally the only things they've released in August have been Legion and BfA (and some old Superman game). Some Hearthstone sets too probably. Has nothing to do with when Classic will launch at all.
---
Apply the same logic as with deer hunting: if it’s brown, it’s down! (Don’t make it about race, snowflakes!)
---
I could care less if the other player has full health or one point of health or is questing or whatever... If they are about to kill the mob with a 5 hour respawn time to complete a quest required to move on to the next leveling zone, killing that player just became my priority! I will mass murder level 5’s if I find them PvP flagged and lol at them the whole time! Make no mistake about it, most on the other team would do it to you if they could, WoW is not the place to try and promote tolerance! Lol
---
As a hunter you’re going to quickly hit 60. Just take skinning and engi from the beginning, and ignore engi until 60. Use your speed to 60 as an advantage to farm devilsaur or other in-demand items to power level engi. Don’t waste time with a gathering profession while leveling. Time spent gathering and on AH could be time spent grinding. 
---
Yep. Guilds are the number one way. 
---
Also, and this isn't for everyone, when I heal an instance I can very quickly tell who knows what's going on. I make those people down and send a whisper here and there. Then invite to be friends. Try it a couple times and if it works out great!  You can do this as a dps or tank. Just have to have that situational awareness. 
---
It's a social game and extending the olive branch is usually well received. 
---
The first raid frames were horrendous.  And we were all on those older PC's, frame-rates out the wazoo, and thus the idea of 'healing assignments' was created.  Two priests on the tanks, shammies doing melee healing, RANGE GOT NO HEALS DAMMIT, and the one dr00d (because who in their right mind levels a healing dr00d) would also watch / heal tanks and melee.
---
On Golmagg, we had to pull one of our priests because she was literally using flash heal on the tanks and OOM.  This was the same priest who in a run of Scholo at the exploding corpses said "just run in aoe, die -- we all do."  In UBRS, at level 60, she had no idea that fade would take away her aggro.  Meanwhile, I had learned how to 'ping-pong' the heal aggo with another priest and in emergencies (or just for fun) kept that NPC running the entire length of the room after us.  :)
---
But yeah, I started with healbot, LOVED it as my main UI / group heal, and then moved over to grid.  Healbot was still my fav though, as the configurations were way easier to make and to recall up on your screen -- I remember using it in ZA and able to two-click to change it for certain fights.  :)
---
trash blade?
---
Earliest? Lol...
---
I bet you were one of the "Classic cant be done until 2021" people. 
---
They're close to being done, thats why theyre releasing so many blue posts. 
---
I definitely remember the legacy and your rogue. Don't think we ever played in the same guild but.
---
Cheers! 
---
Healer blinders we used to call it.  So busy healing, YOU don't realize you're in the fire. :)
---
This, I think we're going to get a much earlier release than people are expecting. 
---
What a go getter lol.  This guy is for real
---
I wouldn’t know what to do with my hands.
---
yes
---
I would FLIP out. Get dressed RUSH to all the stores I could find, Buy all the cases I could just at a chance to get that flipping Spectral Tiger!! I WANT ONE!! 
---
But that is the exact reason I suspect they wont release it again. That and didn't the relationship between Blizz and the makes of the cards go sort of sideways?
---
I'm already drinkin' that go juice, you know what I'm sayin'?
---
My leveling guild, &lt;More Scrubs than Brillo&gt;, must rise again!
---
I feel like everyone is missing the obvious. July 16th is the release of the Beta. 
---
Classic isn’t until August. 
---
when you should switch? when you feel like it.
---
fu u/AutoModerator
---
Why you no use dark mode?
---
My eyes!! My Eyes!! 
---
AQ20 is definitely underrated.  Rajaxx, Buru, and Ossirian were among the best boss designs in Vanilla.  Even a lot of the trash mobs were interesting: the first room with the flying patrols, the Anubisath room, etc.  And the token system for loot was new and interesting.
---
As someone who plans to roll shaman, forget paladins and come home. For the horde!

That works fine for me, as long as there is a set date. They know that the majority of the playerbase are people who work and need to book time off in advance, so I think they will give as atleast 2 months before launch.
---
It is?  which was the first patch that they updated the graphics in?  
---
Here's an idea, maybe instead of fucking around with 2 different graphics versions, they could go ahead and focus on getting one right, instead of two halfassed ones.

Small NA/Alliance group looking for a raid guild or leveling group on a RP server. We want to raid seriously but also want to RP! Or if you're an individual looking for some leveling buddies but not wanting to commit to a guild yet, hit us up! 
---
Our group: Currently we have 3 people who will all be taking at least 1 week off for launch to level seriously. Group will be me (Warrior tank) and two cloth DPS who are still undecided on their classes. I am a serious, dedicated player who is interested in MTing raids or at least OTing. I can also DPS on occasion but not interested in doing it full time. The two DPS that I'm with are just as serious and we all have years of MMO experience. 
---
Our raid experience: Two of us played WoW from vanilla through the end of Cataclysm and raided seriously in every expansion. The third will be new to classic WoW but not to retail. We know how much dedication it takes to raid in classic WoW and we're hoping to find a good group that's just as serious as we are. We are also experienced RPers, all of us have played D&amp;D since we were kids and two of us are super nerds with LARP experience!
---
We don't need a hardcore group focused on server firsts, we just want to find a consistent group of players that will get the job done in a reasonable time frame. Even if you just want a group to level with or you want to meet some other RPers, that would be awesome too!

Naxxramas will still kick your teeth in if you don't have your shit together.
---
The rest as they say is gravy.
---
yes sure. daggers can be max 2.0 speed while swords can be 2.8 speed. so when you have a slower sword (which is very likely) than dagger, you should use the sword.
---
No, it isn't. A population larger than intended by developers ruins many aspects of the experience. Getting faster groups is not a good tradeoff for a ruined economy, ruined leveling experience, inability to farm in any reasonable way, tradeskills being overly hard to level (Mining and herbalism are nearly impossible with too many in the world) there is a list a mile long of what it breaks, and another list of hacky nonsense that has to be implemented to try to mitigate those issues. How about instead we just have original caps, the way the game was designed.
---
Considering summer ends 23rd September, you shouldn’t be surprised. 
---
Most PvP videos were that back then, because in the minds of most back then it translated "yes they're lvl 60 and much better geared, but their opponents are with many!". Reality: geared in R14 epics &gt; 3 lvl 60s in blues. Scale that up to R14 Warrior + epic geared Paladin pocket healer &gt; 10 lvl 60 blues.

Damn. Same. Totaly forgot april 1.
---
no u
---
Apparently it does. I tried "Scholomance" and "pre-nerf Scholomance" in the search bar and I couldn't find what I was looking for. To be fair, however, the April Fool's background is crushing my eyesight right now. :)
---
Naxx 2.0 was a joke, though.  We did it with a semi-PUG (multiple guilds) right after hitting max level, and I think we beat the whole thing on the first run with only a handful of wipes.
---
A big part of the original Naxx's atmosphere was the immense difficulty.  Our first time in there (also with multiple guilds, as not everyone had the rep/crystals for attunement yet), it took us a couple hours (and some trash respawns) just to clear to Instructor Razuvious.  We wiped on every new pack of trash mobs.  It was intimidating as hell.
---
It sucks that most people didn't get to experience the original Naxxramas (my guild saw fewer than half the bosses) but succeeding at hard things is much more satisfying than steamrolling easy things, and imparts better memories of the experience.
---
what the fuck is this escalation

I believe that is it for items that have the "Thrash" affect in Vanilla wow.
---
I mean why the fuck would anyone be retarded enough to make that claim on a PvP realm.  Of course when you're worth honor or you're griefable any class is going to die a lot.  I've never seen a rogue, hunter, mage, lock or druid be like "oh I love STV because I never get ganked by a rolling mob of the opposite faction 10 levels higher than me."

If person 1 was arguing "blizzard should work to integrate the conveniences of battle net without impacting the important social aspects of classic"
---
And person 2 said "no I dont want that because they might fuck it up"
---
That wouldn't make a whole lot of sense now would it? Person 1 isn't advocating for a fucked up version, person 1 wants a version that works without impacting classic negatively.
---
You changed my argument. I want a working toggle, not a broken one. Why would I ask for a modern graphics option that breaks the classic option? Literally no one is saying anything about that.

You are taking offense to a really innocent joke.

Blizzard: "It's going to be released in the Summer 2019. Here's a character creation screen with a warlock named JULY. Here's another one with a warlock randomly named Osconty."

I saved this into my porn folder so that Arnold Schwarzenegger can make me feel ashamed
---
The argument is you die more than any other class is which is bullshit.  That leveling a warrior is some ridiculous task because it's not. Anyone who claims it is either shit or has never actually leveled a warrior and is just repeating the meme.
---
I don't know enough about BFA to tell what is right/wrong and I don't want to get bamboozled. Pls explain, OP.

and the only Osconty on YT was a world-first boss kill on July 16th.

---
My friend and I are sending our wives to a mountain yoga retreat for 5-6 when Classic drops.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they were playing with the idea of a level squish. Ion's well aware that leveling in retail sucks, partially because you only get new talents every 15 levels, which feels huge. Now, if that were to be every 5 levels... What is this, expansion 7? Would make Vanilla 1-25 and then each expansion 5 each. Could work given enough attention.
---
You say that, but for some reason people don’t think we’re getting 1.12 items. 
---
I’ve spent years around cars shops and I’ve seen many, many TCGs come and go. They all promise to be the next big thing, but nothing will dethrone Magic, Pokemon, and Yu-Gi-Oh. 
---
The WoW TCG was actually decent. The gameplay took a lot of the normal rules, reduced complexity, and made for shorter and more casual games. I was there at Gen-con when the game had booth-babes and it’s own private tournament area and I was there years later when it was so small that it got thrown in “the pit” - an area with a bunch of empty cafeteria-style tables that get used for a variety of reasons.
---
The biggest problem with that TCG was...loot cards. The entire value of the WoW TCG was in the hopes of getting a pet or mount for the video game. People would buy boxes of cards just to look for scratch-offs and trade in the rest.
---
Compound this by the fact that WoW began declining in popularity AND made a loot shop available in-game, and you can see why Cryptozoic couldn’t keep players invested.
---
Yeah chill out man jesus 
---
This is the correct answer. 
---
Your post is missing a red circle
---
I thought for a second you used that card to gain permission to game 10 hours in 1 month, and thought this was one of those toxic women who try to repackage being controlling as a gift. I was overthinking it.
---
They highly doubt they will release beta so that is unlikely, if July 16 means anything it’s gonna be the release
---
I never understood it either. most WPvP (other than BRM) usually only plays out in the first place because one party knows its one sided and they won't have to do a corpse run. You don't have to be Horde to pick your battles.
---

all of that just with the auction house? Sure on established servers. But on a fresh release with dozens of people doing the same thing? Sounds like someone won in the china farmer lottery
---
Grab mining. It's less of a hustle to grind up herb later on if that's what you really want to do

&gt; so I jumped into the free BFA weekend.
---
Too bad nobody will see this elegantly crafted burn.
---
Oh. My observation was better tho. 
---
When one should learn sword specc as a troll is a good question.  
---
It actually depends on your quest route. Here's the most common weapon progressions after you get Blade of Cunning: 
---
* Elegant Shortsword From Serena Bloodfeather
---
* Claystone Shortsword from Arachnophobia
---
* Slatemetal Cutlass from Torek's Assault
---
* Wingblade from Leaders of the Fang
---
* Outlaw Sabre from Baron Aquanis
---
* Sword of Omen from Into The Scarlet Monastery
---
* Vanquisher's Sword from Bring the End
---
* Zorbin's Mega-Slicer from Zapped Giants
---
* Thrash Blade from Corruption of Earth and Seed
---
Considering these, both Serena Bloodfeather and Arachnophobia are done post level 20. So you can stop at Undercity to learn sword specialization as you make your way to Tarren Mill to get your poison quest done.  
---
Getting the poison quest done as soon as possible is really really good. You should def get a group, even if it takes you a while and try to do it at level 20. Running double instant poison at that level is insane.  
---
There's an argument to be made about going to Undercity earlier, just to learn the sword specialization, if you get Cursed Felblade from RFC, as you'll most likely have to turn in The Power to Destroy quest there as well.
---
look at chat
---
Then calling someone a wetback is also an innocent joke, amirite? Jesus you people are all the same: someone that disagrees with you and doesn't like abuse must need to "chill," right? It doesn't offend you, so they shouldn't care about it, either, right? Everyone should love being bullied, right?

By those timers you pointed down here I just got a hope that I might be able to raid after all!

Thank you a lot!
---
Personally I'm trying to make a dagger rogue with a spec that I can equally pvp and pve with, my only question is can a hybrid assassin/sub keep up with a combat/sword dps or is it possible
---
Classic comes in WoW's sub its not an separate game
---
And we both used the term "on point"!! [What are the odds?!](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AromaticWetArcticduck-small.gif)
---
They've basically said most things will be 1.12, but some items will be held till the later patches because they add a bit too much power compared to the early raids. That's my understanding at least.
---
\#proshardingstartingzones
---
Blade of Cunning is better than most swords you get at that point of the game.  
---
You should def not do that.
---
It's the same with all the threads masterbating over getting to 60 in less than 4 /days played.  Good job, now try it on a pvp server where you actually have to interact with people.  Try running a dungeon or two.  Try actually enjoying the game instead of seeing how fast you can rush through it.
---
It took me a while as well, even though I played BfA for over a month.. I think it's the character screen like the resistances and damage etc. For [comparison](https://i.redd.it/kwecbl05kn211.png) that's how character screens look like in BfA usually. But it might just be an addon or something that displays the old information, so who knows.
---
It's true it did nerf them, but windfury can proc Flurry, and Flurry can proc Windfury, so while it's not as much of a "stars aligning" moment where windfury procs off itself and the other person just dies, it's still very fun!
---
Swords are easier to find and look cool but honestly backstab is a lot of fun, and I feel like daggers will have less competition trying to get them

**&lt;Lakeshire Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance)**
---
What is Lakeshire Guard?
---
Lakeshire Guard is a moderate to hardcore raiding guild with strong PVP ties to Lakeshire and the Redridge Mountains! Though we aren't RPPVP we do immerse ourselves to do what it takes to defend Lakeshire, and maintain a fairly serious attitude about raiding and our strategies as a guild.
---
We will have a 3 part looting system that includes loot council, "wishlist" item for the current raid, and luck.
---
We would like to offer the best in preparedness, but also want to be open to a total of 80+ unique players who want to play the race and class they desire! We will have priority raid group, and secondary raid groups. and sometimes these groups will inter-mix to gear certain players from the main raid.
---
We don't want to exclude any players from progressing so these raid swaps and off groups will only be for progression weeks, months. We want to be as fair and fun to everyone within our Guard! If someone else gets the loot, remember they are a Guard, and what they get benefits Lakeshire and all of our members.
---
Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you at the Inn.

---
I'd say you're exaggerating, but unless they are genuinely willing and wanting to learn, that seems likely. 
---
Yes, gotta get to 60 as fast as possible!  Don't bother crafting anything you could use along the way!  I fucking hate this mindset.
---
I do
---
And you are underestimating niche appeal of Vanilla. As Ion said, 90% of characters did not reach level 10. That demographic you speak of is much less likely to stay than demographic of private servers, because those players know what WoW is about and went on Nostalrius to check the original version of a game they love. Yet 80% of them left.
---
I also recruited my brother when I started on Nostalrius. We played together and he reached level 10. Despite being active and long time WoW player, he stopped, because he did not enjoy the experience.
---
I hope your wife and friends will enjoy the game, but Vanilla is not some magical thing that will automatically hook everyone up. Chances are you will end up playing it alone after starting zone.

my guild only did 5 bosses I think before we gave up because not enough people would show up. By that time (we were not the fastest server) the launch date of TBC was already known and people figured out they would rather enjoy having the best gear on the server in PVP and other adventures, rather than wiping 2 nights  a week for marginal gains. (we knew we would never make it to Kel'thuzad , that also played a part). I can't blame them, and I joined a  pvp guild myself in the last couple of months, having great fun in the role of hitman in premades. (As a pve player I kinda sucked at pvp, but my gear was top notch compared to most pvpers, so I was good at nuking down single targets as fast as possible at the call of the leader. )

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built on a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, while competing with the best guilds in the world is unlikely, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
Looking For: 
---
High Need
---
    Damage:
---
     -  Rogue
---
     -  Mage
---
     -  Warlock
---
     -  Priest
---
    Heals:
---
     -  Druid
---
     -  Paladin
---
Medium Need
---
     -  Hunter
---
     -  Warrior
---
Low Need
---
    Tanks:
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. 
---
While we would certainly prefer that everyone play an optimal class/spec, we care much more about about the person behind the character. We expect, that regardless of class/spec, that all members show a willingness to learn and become exceptional at their role.
---
Looting Policies: 
---
We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. All items of epic quality will be distributed using loot council. Items of legendary quality will be distributed to a preselected player. The person assigned to received legendary items will be selected based on the effectiveness of the item for the class, member contributions to the guild, and future guild considerations. 
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.

Me like
---
Dagger is the superior weapon type.
---
Daggers can stab 90kg targets 300 metres away.
---
They are way better than swords, swords are just imitations, they are bigger weapons that reflect their owner's insecurities.
---
Why would you slash an opponent when you can just stab him multiple times until he dies to all the big crits on the screen.
---
also i dont think it is an addon since this is how my friends screen looks and mine w/ same addons is not like this. meaning it must be server side/blizzard
---
Or weekend after, when I am going out with friends for the entire weekend with no access to internet.
---

---
I'm going rogue and am dead set on this. Maybe skinning just for a few extra G as i level.
---
I'm still 11 hah, I genuinely believe they would leave it in, very obscurely. Knowing Blizz..
---
Simple question simple answer. Can you decurse without relying on addons to target for you? ==&gt; priest
---
Are you one of the wanna be healers from private servers who rely solely on healbot, emergency monitoring and decursive? Shaman
---
Main reason here being that classic will run under the retail subscription. Therefore it's subject to the retail EULA and with that - no automated srcipts or bots will be allowed.
---
The horde needs reliable magic dispeller as priests are their only option (aside from the 8 sec warlock pet cd - and good luck finding warlocks who have enough of a brain to support with decurse during certain fights)
---
meanshile shamans can braindead spam chainheals and rely on the game to find 'smart targets' for them - well at least for the bounces - and still perform decently with totems for group dispel (disease,poison) - and while they can dispel diseases and poisons directly as well - the magic dispell is really the beef for horde when it comes to dispells

I honestly doubt they would shard the Barrens though. That place is massive and can handle a ton of foot traffic
---
In which country exactly? I assume you are from the US, and just a friendly reminder, we're not all from the US, even though a lot on reddit seems to believe that. In Denmark Fall is officially the 1st September. But whatever, im not saying the game wont release the 16th July as many think, just saying it wouldn't surprise me the release will be delayed, theres 3 and half month for that date to happen and we haven't even heard about a beta / stress test.

I think he can spend that card to ask her to play the game herself.

I feel like, how many times has Blizzard said no, but secretly meant yes. Even if they confirmed it's not in the game.

ZG was just such a fantastic raid. Was an amazing breath of fresh air to get out of dungeon like raids and into an open world type setting. Mechanics of the fights were pretty awesome for there time and on top of it the addition of optional and summoned bosses was pretty sweet at the time.

Would love this as a phone app or online application that allows gear customization

I've had 16gb of ram for a while now. My old hard drive died and I replaced it with an SSD. That made the biggest difference in load time by far. If I'm running no addons, there are times where I might miss the loading screen if I blink.

My wife will play with me. As we did with Vanilla!
---
I also have an agreement in place with my wife that if she gives the game a fair try (say, 15-20 hours?) then I will go with her to get a pedicure.  I'm hoping after a few hours she will fall and love and want to keep playing!

I think initially they couldn't ride the Baron's Deathcharger, but it was changed in a patch.

Yeah :). 
---
I have a bad feeling they won’t make a new client and instead you will launch bfa and switch to a server tab that has classic servers.... fuck. Vanillas dead before it’s released again. 
---
Gotta say BWL because those were the best times with my raid. I hated AQ (20 because my Shadow Bolt book never dropped, 40 because it killed my raid). Naxx might have beaten BWL but I'd joined a different raid of folks I didn't really know or care much about so it was just about the gear and prestige at that point.
---
I've convinced mine to at least try the game out!  But it would be an alt that I would set aside to play with her, if she sticks with it.  There's no way she would have been able to keep pace with me for launch week.
---
OP is asking for viability, which I gave the most efficient means to an end.
---
The problem is that Blizzard does so much for their mythic dungeons and raids that they totally forgot about the world.
---
Open world cohesion is a shadow of its former glory. 
---
The game pretty much revolves around pressing buttons to be ported to the content of your choosing. 
---
I honestly think Diablo3 does it better than WoW. They are comparable by now. Just dungeon crawlers.
---
I voted for Molten Core because I love BRM so much.  It is, hands down, the best dungeon ever made for any MMO.  Ever.
---
You’re comparing racial slurs to a joke used by someone regarding the type of server you prefer in a video game from 2004? Get a grip lmao
---
The only boss fight I can think of that's significantly aided by the use of sappers is Viscidus in AQ.  After the raid shatters him, you have a matter of seconds to try and kill as many spawned blobs as you can before they reach the center of the room, and if the majority of the raid times their sapper explosions correctly you'll drop him to 1% immediately, allowing only one more shatter phase to happen before he is defeated.
---
Generally speaking though, any boss fight that involves a lot of adds to kill can be aided with the use of sappers.  Nefarian skeletons at 20%, Fankriss adds, Anub'rekhan scarabs etc are bosses where engineers can help out, and a bunch of trash packs are made significantly easier too.
---
A big one is Viscidus in AQ40. At least 20 members of the raid need engineering and goblin sapper charges. After freezing and shattering viscidus, you group the entire raid in the middle of the room. Just as all of the globs are in range of sappers, but not quite despawned in the middle, the whole raid sappers. Every glob dies in one phase. Then you just freeze viscidus again and you win the fight.
---
Comparing carebear to wetback lmao.

Chill out carebear

Logged in to check. It's gotta be your addons. I don't really use addons and [here is what mine looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/fqwYa1v) Good ol' blizz default.
---
I like the idea of discovering something about Ashbringer. It almost certainly has something to do with Atiesh. I want to try so much stuff with it but I don't play a sword using class.
---
Hahaha this is the best tag I’ve seen so far today. 
---
You could say they get pidgeonholed into behaving. 
---
In retail you can level solo, do point and click adventure LFD and LFR and you now have seen all content without ever talking to another human being. 
---
This won't fly in classic and you will ostracized by behaving like an ass, so you can't. 
---
Well, you can once and then you sit on 5more guilds ignore lists.
---
Yes i'm forced to you buffoon of baboons.
---
You're literally the most stupid person i've ever spoken to, if you go to any link on this profile (circlessss) you'll see that all of them are [removed]
---
I received no warnings, no indications of them being removed. They are SHADOW REMOVED.
---
I HAD TO CHANGE ACCOUNTS TO EVEN SEE THEY WERE REMOVED.
---
Thats how scummy this shill is, he will go to lengths to discredit me when all I did is make some simple nice posts that got shadow removed for no reason.
---
The mods wont answer me, i've messaged the PR team at blizzard.
---
I can't even comment on the account it happened on... You're a very bad person.
---
Noone server firsted C'thun? So he stayed unbeaten and you guys just skipped to Naxx? :D
---
We'd been traveling for a little while at that time and I was unhappy with the quality of my underwear. One of the IOU's she gave me was for... well, just have a look: https://i.imgur.com/KvdureI.jpg
---
After Naxx is cleared, I'll say "What do you mean? Now we can finally start playing the game!"
---
Damnit! Now she's reading this and you're giving her ideas!
---
people seriously need to stop overvaluing the undead shadowpriest, troll is at least as good, if not better. sure wotf is an awesome racial, but shadowguard deals more damage than dp for way less mana and u get so much blackout procs since every charge has its own chance. plus hex of weakness is also the only other spell besides mortal strike that provides healing reduction, super underrated.
---
actually we used to troll horde in pvp having a warrior equip this with full Lightforge gear and switch weapons as it looked like a paladin heal animation
---
C'Thun was pretty much impossible until later in the expansion I think.
---
You are correct when you say that Blizzard will have good data on current players, but the thing is that they won't have any data on players that can't play the game due to lack of time. Therefore I suggest that they make alternative servers with different release schedules so that players like me and others **can** play the game.
---
Otherwise they miss out on a rather large group of **potential** players who will not play the game knowing the time commitment that the current release schedule. By doing so they will gain a bigger player base.
---
[Here's an archive of the AQ war effort rankings.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070101065101/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wareffort/servers.html)  The first two realms *worldwide* to open the AQ gates were both in US East, and the third *US* realm to open the gates was also in US East.
---
This doesn't necessarily mean EST had higher population overall, and populations fluctuated over time -- especially as realm transfers opened up and top guilds left overloaded realms seeking a smoother play experience.  But being on one of these servers (Mannoroth) at the time, it definitely felt like a high-pop realm.
---
any reasons why they wouldn't 
---
I was half joking. I kind of expect it to release in July without a beta/server stress test. 
---
Dude, you have shill written all over your face, LEAVE ME ALONE YOU BUFFOON. All I want is my other account un-shadow banned.
---
What is your problem you psycho?
---
Bank alts.
---
The real solution is that Dads of Azeroth needs to be a guild, not server. A bunch of like minded parents doing what they can when they have the time for it. 
---
Personally, I hope the moms get an board, too!
---
Sorry, yes it is 10%.  It still works though.  
---
However, it is not dodge/parry, it is miss chance.  Being behind the target doesn't matter there.  
---
OP, I brought up a similar topic in the past and the general community doesn’t want seasons or any content after Naxx. They want the game to stay as it was in classic. Nothing more, nothing less. There was some talk on the post about rotating servers that are specifically designed to reset every few years, but as far as that, nothing.
---
When I stopped it was when he was pretty much unbeatable. Pre-nerf. That's around when I quit, not sure who went back eventually haha. Around that time my guild switched servers as well. This was US - Agamaggan.
---
You do realize the use of multiple accounts is against the TOS of reddit. You are getting banned because you post the same shit from both accounts.  You’ve posted about your guild post from both accounts. 
---
That’s why you have been shadow banned. You need to calm down.  
---
Calling it now, they're gonna release it with no warning on a Monday so the servers don't explode.
---
Sorry, I got confused with the BC version of the spell.  That one was pretty great.
---
I understand your point of view that they would be splitting the player base. However, they won't have the same player base if people with time commitments can't play the game. Therefore I suggest that they make alternative servers with different release schedules so that players like me and others **can** play the game.
---
Otherwise they miss out on a rather large group of **potential** players who will not play the game knowing the time commitment that the current release schedule has. By doing so they will gain a bigger player base. 
---
No you don't it's fricking [removed] Stop ignoring me and i'll stop spamming you guys. You need to fix your automod because about 4 of my recent posts are shadow banned and I don't see it banned unless I log out. Which is scummy to say the least.
---
Don't forget that most people playing Classic have never played Classic before.  The hardcore pserver players are a small minority.

Please stop stalking me before I report you for that.

No changes means no lean realm list. Stop cherry picking! 
---
19 twinks for sure.  Definitely a Rogue and a Hunter.  Might try one of the off the wall Priest builds that I've read about and seen videos of.
---
There is a very specific location I camp my 19 Rogue for maximum Alliance salt on PVP servers.  Every kill is glorious in the eye's of the Lord.
---
&gt;The problem is that Blizzard does so much for their mythic dungeons and raids that they totally forgot about the world.
---
Sure, I don't disagree with that, but that's not the question. The question was which game is more fun, and most of Vanilla gameplay consists of running, grinding single mobs, and pressing 1 or 2 buttons. Its easily the lowpoint of WoW's history, but the delusions on this subreddit are too strong.
---
Because it's all we have, OK!?
---
Fiscal year just rolled over, so I had to spend the rest of my vaca last week. Stupid work with no rollover. Got a new stack but has to last 12 months. 
---
So honestly I hope it's coming late summer or in the fall when I'll be itching to take some PTO. Too soon and I'll have a really long stretch with limited PTO left because I used it all early on WoW. :)
---
That’s hard to say. I just recently hit up a server just to do tirisfal glades again. I doubt I’ll be doing it this time around. May roll a night elf for teldrassil.
---
I know. Kind of random. I’ve just done the others a billion times
---
Nobody likes your shill postings.

Tbh I’ve come to accept private servers as word of god so I trust it 
---
Yeah was thinking the same. I usually level undead priest but I got so sick of the barrens I am currently a human priest (I know, not best for min max cuz of many reasons)
---
Someone seize this man! For his UI has caused me to seize.
---
You probably should though, you're a very rude person.
---
Well, turns out I can't use the search function very well. Please ignore me and my silly ways!
---
Except when you’re on a high pop private server then you just run to the 12 mages ape grinding at the crypt entrance 
---
Only when you get mortal strike.
---
I just noticed the flair. 
---
Yes, of course there are many great moms that play WoW too. Too bad I can't change the title to Parents of Azeroth. I tried :(.
---
I'd also like to mention that there are a lot of other people with time commitments beside parents. Many students and athletes also struggle with finding time to play MMO games which demand a lot of time.
---

I remember one time before we all had mounts in there, we had someone running when he almost made it to the end. One of our warlocks zoned in and summoned him. Thinking it was a summon to where the raid was, he took it. It was not. He was summoned right back to the start. He then logged out.
---
1080i CRTs do exist and I have been tempted...
---
Seems odd, I think it would be fun to have different types of servers. (1) The basics - Only the classic game through Naxx, done. (2) Seasonal - allows you to reroll every season for bonus stuff (whatever it is), etc
---
 You need to calm down some. I’m assuming everything that happens to you makes you angry. Good luck with that.  
---
Btw: I was able to see your posts from both your accounts for your guild.  You weren’t banned till you posted in three different weekly lfg thread. So you weren’t banned at that point. 
---
This is my reaction anytime someone mentions a tips video.
---
Need a straw poll on if you're right ;)
---
No. Rank 14 is not assigned to the person who has the most honor in one week. The most honor possible is assigned to that person, but that much honor does not even get you to rank 5 (I think Rank 5, I don't remember people saying they got past 3-4 week 1 but it's been a long long time)
---
I'm currently toiling away on a private server to determine what class I want to roll for Classic.  I have a lvl 58 undead mage currently that I plan on running a few MCs to see if I like the play style of raids as a range dps.  So I'm pro screwing around on a private server before Classic.
---
I personally was never a big raider, so for me personally classic is perfect.
---
The minigame atrocity that supposedly is PvP (arena) does not hold my interest. I like playing games such as Gothic1+2, the Witcher etc. Full blown RPGs. And this is where vanilla simply takes the cake. I do my raids two raidnights to clear MC + Ony + BWL in one night and AQ40 in another. 
---
I hope, I get loot, but most of game schedule does not revolve around raids. 
---
I like to immerse myself in the game and to world PvP and mass PvP to my hearts content and that's what you don't get in todays WoW. The world is pretty much like Call of Duty lobby. You see couple people running around, but in the end its not there to be played in like it was in vanilla.
---
In short: retail lost both its RPG and MMO core strenghts and is more akin Diablo3 which I do not play when I want to play a massive multiplayer online roleplay game.
---
By now comparing retail and classic is basically comparing two different game genres, so comparing is futile.
---
I can't really say if I like Battlefield 3 or the Witcher better, honestly.
---
So here is what you're going to do alright listen closely.
---
You're going to run around a lot. You're going to find an injured warrior, heal him. Then run when people notice the green stuff and chase you. When they give up make sure to heal the warrior again.
---
Yeah I have never raided in classic and wanted to “be ready” in order to get in a good guild etc. I  might get lvl 60 and do some casual raids in order to get the feel of my class, but then again, I also want the first time I hit 60 and step in to a raid to be an important moment .. so conflicted 
---
If it was me, I'd stop now just so I don't get burned out and sick of leveling once Classic actually hits.
---
Technically world of Warcraft isn't a PvP game but I only play games for PvP. My end goal is making other players rage and being competitive as fuck. It's hard for me to even get into single player rpgs anymore. My character becoming maxed is solely to kill yours 
---
That's one point of view. What about the gear difference between slow pace players and those of a ,,no lifer"? Hardly seems fair in PvP. 
---
I too hope that the moms get on board as well.
---
Could ride ZG raptor though, funnily enough, same with the tiger.
---
No, you're right, I was just being silly. Didn't mean to make it an argument like that!

I’m on a pserver with a bunch of lvl 20s and 30s, turns out leveling is fun af in this game, especially duo. But I’ll be quitting pretty soon so that classic feels somewhat fresh. 
---
I'm trying to hit 60 just so I have a general idea of quests and locations.  Leveling is part of the game as far as I'm concerned; those people that think they have to go 0-60 in the least time /played are missing it.
---
Why is that fans of Mindless Self Indulgence always get so upset and defensive? Is it an emo or goth thing? Many many years ago during WoW people used "Mindless Self Indulgence - Straight to Video" in their vids, I commented that they sound like Marilyn Manson, and out of the woodwork came a bunch of Mindless Self Indulgence fans throwing a fit. :)
---
Hey, lack of critical thinking man.
---
I actually did 4. (Because I know I was there)
---
The first week was a self post on accident because I didn't realize there was a lfg.
---
The second week was posted on a week early thread (because the LFG+Monday search broke and I didnt realize)
---
Then the third one was for last week.
---
And I tried to post one for this week (because I keep my recruitment up to date) and it was shadow banned before it was posted.
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with LFG in LFG threads.
---
Are you saying there is a problem recruiting in recruiting threads?
---
If so, maybe get your head checked. You're the one stalking me Mr. Angry.
---
Haha I remember well the one close to that Skittering Dark cave (full of spiders) north of Silverpine Forest, guys level 12 would constantly run into him on Nostr as he was in the middle of nowhere and had a 50 yard aggro radius. The area was full of skeletons. 
---
So funny to stand further away and watch people unvoluntarily aggro him, realize they're in deep shit when he starts rushing at them, then try to run away in the opposite direction only to get dazed by aggroing several bears, and getting smashed by the 23 elite afterwards :P
---
Reading this makes me salivate out of the mouth and want to gank you even more. Maybe I'm a toxic dickhead but it's why I love fps and games like rust. Nothing like me and my friends making the game hell for the enemy 
---
And only WoW accounts created 2004/2005 can log in. Bazinga!
---
Well, I'd say burn-out is a real thing.  One of the later comments (Gorshun) mentions it.  But if you feel up to it, it's a good idea to have a plan of attack for Classic, especially if you want to min-max.  
---
I've been conflicted between Mage and Warrior.. I had an OT Warrior on Nost and it was fun (got good dps gear too) but it's hectic tanking and doing melee dps... I kind of like the idea of being the water b\*tch and just spamming frostbolt from range -- not to mention the ease of farming gold as a Mage.
---

Depends on your personality and what you're enjoying about the game. If you're going to roll the same character on Classic, I'd suggest giving it a break so you're enthusiastic about the experience. If you're unsure about what you want to do play in classic, then take the time to try out some different classes.
---
I mean outside of some rogue duel videos (lol) EVERY popular vanilla video is a crit montage.
---
&gt; ruined economy - subjective. How about getting rid of gold sellers first, they do way more damage to the economy
---
&gt; ruined leveling experience - the ease of finding people for group quests is offset by ganking (if on a PvP server,) and difficulty finding quest spawns. If you are leveling after the surge of new characters when fresh server comes out, it is not a problem.
---
&gt; inability to farm in any reasonable way - this is the main trade-off with a higher population, and it will lead to scarcer max-level resources &amp; drive up prices on the AH. But there are countless ways to farm gold in the world, and people will find the path of least resistance in order to have a successful game experience.
---
&gt; tradeskills being overly hard to level (Mining and herbalism are nearly impossible with too many in the world) - you are correct if the intent is to fully develop tradeskills if leveling in the world during the initial surge of players on a fresh server. 
---
I think many people are willing to live with these hindrances in exchange for a more robust population. In Classic, servers will be regional again so if you expect to farm during prime time you are certainly going to have a slow go  of it. On the other hand, motivated players will find off-times when spawns are more plentiful.
---
The above is true however the damage retail has done to the skill level of it's player base (those of it that still remain) over the years with content such LFR should not be underestimated. Yes mythic raiding is mechanically more difficult than vanilla raiding but only a small minority of players do that content. Over the years blizzard have socially engineered their player base myself included to be worse at the game by making content like dungeons far too easy and all about blasting through and collecting as many mobs as possible. The direction of the game in recent years has taught players (mythic plus being a prime example) to have no patience whatsoever for players who like to take their time moving through things. Players coming from retail won't be prepared for the level of preparation required to enter a raid, they are used to instant gratification with gear and instant queues by clicking a table. Not the fault of the players but the way the game is now. However this will only be a temporary problem I suppose, some of them will adjust to vanilla and find they like it more and those that don't will quit, so probably only MC and BWL will be effected by this, early dungeons will certainly be interesting!

---
It's not a completely horrible farming weapon for a holy paladin who can't be bothered to spend DKP on a good 2H.
---
I quit the game because I couldn't tolerate corpseruns in AQ40. And we never even made it to Cthun.

MC was an epic experience once, maybe twice, but turned out to be a rather dull tank&amp;spank fest.

Never saw Naxx in it's original form.
---
Hard time deciding between ZG and BWL to be honest, but going with BWL.  
---
Honestly, if you are having fun, you should continue. I just would not play it so much that i would burn out on it before the classic servers launch. You can always play the opposite faction on release to get an entirely new experience. 
---
i love you
---
I love you both
---
That would be very exotic and retro. Would be damn sweet if you'd post pics of your setup then if you do. I'm going into the opposite direction. My monitor will be a 49" or 55" Samsung QLED series TV. Ever since they've added FreeSync and significantly lowered input lag, I want one as my primary monitor. I had hoped that they'd come with HDMI 2.1 48 Gbps this year, but I'll have to wait until 2020.
---
This is something that could be addressed in a few years. I am honestly not to worried about how they will change it up. I would just imagine that they will have fresh classic servers routinely(like a new server every 2 stage progressions or something). 
---
But Druids can't.
---
Yeah, he's got nothing else to say. He knows he's a useless shill. Bye canis9459, I hope you never get to play wow-classic.
---
Took AQ40 because Cthun is the best raid fight they've ever created.
---
Improved Blizzard 3/3 may be ok in Classic. Arcane Resillience value is usually low. For raids elemental precision 3/3. And you can farm much more things than just DM:E. As for PvP there is a lot of different PvP - ganking, gank defending, raiding or BGs that may require different sets of talents/responses/engineering/pots.

Can you guys believe this guy wants to run a guild on a rp pvp server ?

Pretty certain Troll is a better Shadow Priest. Devouring plague is removed by all Dwarves (stoneform), Palas dispell it, Mages IB it, and Jungle Remedy cleanses it. Not to mention its terrible Mana cost. Troll's Hex of Weakness is terribly OP in PvP, since no healers (outside of Druids, who are pretty rare in PvP anyway) can dispell it ; it's the only non-warlock curse, and most people don't know that. Shadowguard deals good damage and can proc blackout. Berzerk can be actually quite handy to give you the extra DPS to win a close fight.
---
As for mana issues, Priests aren't that much worse than other classes. Hunters, Druids, Mages, Shamans all suffer heavily from it. Priests stack spirit so their Mana is doing okay in attrition fights anyway.
---
If you’re looking for a source from Blizzard I don’t know of one single source other than their novels and the game itself.
---
Would it be okay to roll on a RP-PvP server for the good and friendly atmosphere, even though I'm probably not going to RP? I'll just be friendly with other RPers and I'll also try to integrate and act with the Lore in mind. Also the thing that interests me the most is the World PvP events. However I know that in some RP servers on retail (Argent Dawn) people don't like you if you're not going straight into RPing. So I wonder if we'd have the same mentality with Classic.
---
I think in Nighthold it was the first time I actually said WoW is hard.

Tech company? Denmarkian? You are o e funny guy. I'm sure Blizzard like all currencies, not just the dollar.
---
So play on a PvE server if you’re concerned about being ganked by players with better gear than you. 
---
If you’re suggesting that it’s unfair for “no lifers” to have a gear advantage in PvP then you might be disappointed with the rank 14 system. 
---
See the difference between you and me is I bet you started all nighters after gaming and shit. I literally found gaming because I was well capable of running into the night. My parents worked night shifts

I don't get it.

Shocked at those results that ZG was at the top. Could these numbers be skewed because there was a small percentage of players in Vanilla that was actually able to raid and clear content?
---
How would we be able to have a “classic summer” if that’s the case?
---
Totally forgot about the single bank.  I remember I used a guild bank for years so all alts could access the same mats in the guild bank without having to remember who had what.  Thanks.
---
Shaman is in my top 8 of classes I consider playing :p
---
And this post made me consider it yet again 
---
By enjoying the beta of course!
---
This was always so confusing because that character exists/posted his armory at the time.
---
Yay go druid
---
Imp Blizz is really not good, because it overrides the slow of Cone of Cold if you skill  3/3 imp blizz. 
---
Thats why you see 2/3 imp blizz in pretty much all mage builds.
---
Not true. June 25th and July 2nd/ are also valid guesses. And unlike the whole July 16th thing it doesn’t involve digging into meaning behind a screenshot and is more based on the idea that Blizz is going to want to have some kind of answer to FF14’s Shadowbringers. June 25th being a full week before the expansion’s launch and 3 days before Early Access and July 2nd being the day of. 
---
As much as I’d love for that too be true, I doubt it’ll be before August
---
You don’t know how fucking hyped I was for this immediately calling my best friend to tell him, then getting a call back 30 minutes later telling me it’s their annual April fools joke.... I never trusted blizzard again
---
That’s not a classic summer, also why would you need a beta for a game that was designed and completed 12 years ago? Blizzard has the actual 1.12 server running live at HQ, if anything needs to be changed you would have to reference that server. 
---
You traded 15-20 hours for one? 
---
You're a master negotiator. 
---
Druid taking another L
---
It's certainly not a bad idea to wait a week and avoid the initial onslaught.
---
With that said, I will personally be stupid and play from t=0 to get ahead of the pack.
---
I was scrolling in a speed-reading blur down the comments and misread this for a second as "Does anyone recall if his ahole is snackable?"
---
Huge "lolwut" moment, for me.
---
I personally am going to log in and see how bad things are. If they are awful, will wait a few days and try again. I don’t want to be frustrated playing the game otherwise I’m not sure how far I’ll get. With sharding on the level 1-20 zones, I think it’ll be just fine honestly though.
---
Time is money, friend.
---
Embrace. You might never get another chance to be on a fresh server like that. Also it probably won’t be that bad. Might as well claim your characters name and try on release week
---
True lies. I love that film so much.

I want my Hobbit Rogue back dammit ! :)

My sword-spec rogue with Hand of Justice approves of this message.

---
Skål! Godt du ikke stoppede efter en uge! ;)
---
I think it’ll August at the earliest. Classic is super hyped so I think we’ll get an announcement at least 3 months before release. It’s April and no announcement, so I’m doubting July
---
Yes, but will it do the same on Classic? Some people point out that this is what it does on private servers - so it seems not everyone is certain that this is the expected outcome.
---
That came up as a point of contention.  My stance was that for a *brand new* player, ~1 hour of Classic WoW is enough to get to like, level 3.  Maybe.  Her gaming experience until now was some Yoshi's Island and Mario Kart growing up, and every now and then she'll dabble in the Sims or Stardew Valley.  So I made the case that to really start to "get" what the game was all about, 15-20 was a reasonable number.  After that, if the game still just isn't clicking with someone, it's fair to say that maybe it's just not for them.
---
Hahahaha
---
Here in Texas summer is from April to January so they're already late
---
Son of a bitch.
---
Let's agree on our disagreement - as we won't come to similar grounds.
---
Rank 14 is all about having a rotation of friends to play the same character ~16 hours or more per day. 
---
It’s one of the few things I actually didn’t like in vanilla but it is what it is. The rank system does work except for at the top. 
---
Ehh? Westfall, Duskwood, Arathi Highlands, Desolace, Dustwallow marsh
---
29 rogue and a 39 mage. No doubt
---
Because it never existed?
---
I need a release date to get that week of staycation reserved. Then after a weeks worth of grinding and only getting to level 35 I can rethink my life's decisions.
---
That era had that comfy, organic, warm sound to it &lt;3
---
as would we all, as would we all
---
My favourite MMO experience was actual SWTOR launch where I got to watch the chaos while stuck inside a mound of bones I had bugged into. I could achieve nothing (apart from try moving slightly and waiting for the /unstuck command to come off cool down) but the atmosphere was worth being there. 
---
I’m not missing launch even if I achieve nothing to progress my character.
---
&gt; In which country exactly? I assume you are from the US, and just a  friendly reminder, we're not all from the US, even though a lot on  reddit seems to believe that. In Denmark Fall is officially the 1st  September. But whatever, im not saying the game wont release the 16th  July as many think, just saying it wouldn't surprise me the release will  be delayed, theres 3 and half month for that date to happen and we  haven't even heard about a beta / stress test. 
---
As a fellow Dane, I can tell we use the simplified version, to determine if it's summer, which is based off   meteorological/traditional reasons (The 1st of June till 1st of September). And not the astronomical reasons (21st of June till 23rd of September), which is what the person above is describing and what is the 'correct' way but not really used that often.
---
One adult telling another how much they can do something. What has this fucking world come to
---
That's how spell effect stacking worked in Vanilla and how it should work with the legion client. The more powerful slow overwrites. If cone of cold is not a stronger slow than imp Blizzard r3 (it isn't) then you trade an 11 second slow for a 4 second one. (Cone of cold CD is 10 seconds so you can farm with just it after getting the damage boost in talents. Maybe toss in a blizzard every frost nova, but the mana efficiency gets insane. You definitely want 2/3 improved blizzard

Looking for more members to our guild, we accept all kinds of specs and players to flesh out the guild :)
---
We will raid 2-3 times a week and try to clear all the content that we can! PM me for the discord info!
---
I hope mid-late July. Completely selfishly, I want to do the Shadowbringers main story before I lose my soul to classic.
---
Honestly, launch chaos is a really interesting and unique experience. I wouldn't necessarily recommend taking time off of work if you value that time off and don't want to risk feeling it was wasted on a cramped, hectic experience. However, playing on the weekend and evenings around launch day? That can be a blast.
---
You can farm dm n also for big money. I feel like every class could farm lashers. 
---
I dunno, I like both Marilyn Manson and Mindless Self Indulgence - however, they do not sound the same.
---
It's like going up to a car person saying that the wankel engine sounds like an inline-four. People will think you're retarded
---
Maybe that's why
---
Fucking got me 
---
Yea I wouldn’t waste your time man. Your perfect level to go out to Hillsbrad foothills and pvp though. I would just go enjoy some low level pvp and wait for classic
---
Yes they can proc from wf.  We are unsure of what the real proc rates will be in classic though
---
No other class will die as much as a warrior on average. The general consensus agrees with this. Get some statistics, or shut up
---
There aren't as many good easily obtainable daggers for leveling, as there are swords. Swords will be your best bet after you get your rogue class dagger at 10. A lot of the good daggers are low drops from dungeons.
---
I'm thinking about doing a dagger leveling spec though, once vanilla releases. Mainly because I'll be duo leveling with a warrior, and we normally do 3 mobs at a time (I aggro one, while warrior tanks 2, backstab down whichever mob the warrior has threat on). So backstabbing might be more beneficial. Swords could probably still be better, especially with swordspec/bf/ar.
---
I sorta tested it on the last fresh, and there were only a handful of people ahead of us about 5 hours in, and they had a lot of early help with mob tagging/killing.

C'thun was top 5 worst progression bosses I ever did in 13 years raiding. That run back was unreal.
---
Embrace the chaos. If the chaos gets boring just throw on some TV or something in the background while you spam tab and your instant cast. 
---
Its April first. That's 91 days till July first. If we dont hear anything by mid April I will start worrying. But as of now I'm holding out hope for the July 16 conspiracy. 
---
In Finland we have this thing called Summer which is usually one nice weekend during Mid-July.
---
Honestly would be a brilliant way to beta test to roll the server for April fools to test classic for bugs
---

---
Didn’t discover Shamans until much later in my WoW career, but I’m planning on being a support cow in Classic. Are Resto Shamans the best spec if you want to give maximum support and totem buffs?
---
I'm a 29yo EU-(rp-)PvP brit bro with enough vanilla experience. I'm looking for an alliance guild of focused peeps who want to progress steadily and enjoy all vanilla has to offer with a real community emphasis.
---
Not interested in loosey goosey guilds who accommodate noobs in order to give them a place to fit in OR guilds who are so focused on progression that they're willing to go through undue stress to attain it. I want to be with high skill level players who don't lose their shit when things go wrong.
---
Will play mage and am happy to raid 2 or 3 nights a week. If I sound like a good fit for your guild hit me up with a pm.
---
I remember this so well lmao I was telling all of my guild mates 
---
I know somebody has the link
---
Woosh
---
Good shit! Proper 12 minute track too, they don't make em like that anymore.
---
0 chance it works out that way, just trust me it'll be War, rogue, mage top 3, every time
---
most of that is true besides the spirit part. spirit is a prio stat for holy, but not for shadow.
---
But are they though?
---
If you are combat leveling remember sinister strike is tied directly to the top end damage of your mh, which should be high if it is very slow.  I may from time to time have a dagger in my OH but by the time I get to sword specialization that idea gets tossed out the door
---
Front stabbing won't be a thing in classic
---
Same, I just want a delicious serving of vanilla during my summer break.
---
As long as you’re not being a huge jerk no one is really going to care. Just don’t name your toon something stupid like “FatNerdz” and make a tiny effort to stay in character when typing and you’ll fit right in!! 
---
They have to shard it if they shard westfall tho or people will flip shit.
---
I have one weekend planned out for a wedding this summer. I swear to \*\*\*\*ing God if it comes out August 3rd I'm gonna go bananas.
---
Wish priests had an instant cast :( 
---
Without sharding on launch (limited in scope), the game would be virtually unplayable.
---
People would get pissy about not being able to take time off work 
---
K-10: "BARK BARK! HELLO ERIC!"

CARTMAN: "SUCK MY BALLS K-10, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD"

Will I get downvoted for being honest? 
---
Always put it duration="Long" as the cheapest by 1c, but use your judgement. ie: If there are four stacks going 25% cheaper than the rest, buy them and relist at your price. I always look for niche items I can control the market value of.
---
I have never in the history of playing and having over 150k gold in TBC listed an auction without a buy it now price set.
---
Use auctioneer.
---
Anything is possible
---
No, sounds like they have until january for you.
---
Yoshi story was a great game and I’ll never forgot that intro music. 
---
The only spec pretty much in PvE.
---
Yeah, I've seen cone + arcane explosion merry-go-round in ZG farming. How much this is more efficient from blizzarding? (aside of avoiding mobs casting if rooted). Arcane explosion can crit so crit gear or world buffs could make it quite good.
---
Backstab generates a lot of threat, just watch for that
---
UD or Troll both have their value. UD for PVP with Will of the Forsaken is pretty good. You'll see far more UD priests than Troll but either work for PVE.
---
I want to like this but ill leave it at 69 :)

Horde |🌎 NA-PVP ⚔ | Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.  
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)

---
Firefins can be used for smaller fire protection potions, while greater firepower is IMHO also released alongside AQ. Normal firepower potion would be from start.
---
I keep trying to get people to play the World of Warcraft boardgame with me. It honestly feels like playing classic. Sadly it takes 4 to 6 hours to play a game, so nobody will play. :(
---
I'd suggest borrowing a friend's acct to practice aoe farming. Assuming that server doesn't have it nerfed 
---
Such respect to all the people making these quests back in the day, i'm sure many of them dont work for Blizzard anymore which is unfortunate.
---
I'm here to play Vanilla. I don't care about retail. How good or bad retail or any other game is has absolutely no impact on how good or bad Vanilla is.
---
*sight
---
Lmao, I like the way this guy thinks!
---
Any girl that requires a IOU for a blowjob is not a great girlfriend. Now an IOU for NOT returning oral sex is another story and pretty cool.
---
Blizzard used to kill it with April Fool's jokes.
---
&gt;So never actually played Vanilla
---
I started to play in TBC.
---
TBC is by faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar a better game than retail.
---
Yeah it was great.  We actually just bought Yoshi's Crafted World for the Switch to play through co-op.  Similar gameplay, if you're a fan!
---
I'm hoping for seasons like they do with Diablo. I want to try all of the class race combos, and I'd prefer to play them on fresh servers occasionally.
---
Lol @ flair 
---
Not sure yet what class im gonna play yet but i dont think im gonna aoe farm, i prefer normal questing.
---
Guilds will start ranking in fastest raid clear while even "casual" people will steadily clear every raid if they want to. If you get the basics and a guild group that wants things done it will be "easy".
---
Isn't base stun-resist 5%? So it's 30%.
---
I'm going to try to play from launch but we will see how it goes.
---
Where do you get 55% from? Where do you get the extra 30%
---
My favorite one was the new orge race.  2 heads, 2 players.  when one player was offline the head was asleep.
---
On the off chance you're from Copenhagen, Denmark my boys and  I will definitely play with you. Always down for 5h+ of boardgaming!
---
No joke... that resource bar thing looks far more interesting and fluent than some of the other "new resources" have been during their launches. Like the Chi-energy shit Monk has or Old DK system.
---
Just a bar with blocks of some "resource" like this would be interesting and could be really fluent and interesting gameplay tbh. With abilities costing different amounts and shit

---
When you a level 14 horde questing at sepulcher and see Son of Arugal 
---
Earlier on in Vanilla you could put any enchant on any weapon--Crusader on a level 19 was insane! I think they phased that out though, so that anybody who didnt have it couldn't get it.
---
Agreed, the chaos is part of the experience, don't miss it.
---
Damn you April fools day!
---
Seems legit
---
I'll take it.
---
Finally, something all of us can agree on!
---
As a western-swede, I gotta ask.. are your summers that bad?
---
We basically have tropical summers from late April to late Sept here. Beast summers.
---
Always embrace the chaos! Since MoP my WoW experience has been basically the same.. Buy the newest expansion play it on launch all the way through the initial content/raid content. Then usually end up shelving the game until the next GOOD content patch comes out or until the next expacs prepatch comes out. 
---
To me, the fresh feeling and everyone being on the same level and going through the content for the first time is what makes the game. Once you are just grinding out weekly resets the game gets pretty stale.
---
Bard seems like a better class idea then the other new classes Blizz has made. 
---
I plan to do what I did at the launch of Mists of Pandaria. Log in, but not level. I'll just chill out and soak up the levelling chat while everybody else fights for spawns.
---
10/10 good stuff all around
---
If only Shaman had dispel. I be going paladin missing out on wf totem. 
---
Judging by the polls there's going to be a lot of us
---
&gt; It takes a long time to turn that around, if you've lived like that for so long. Like, really long. You've no idea how long until you do.
---
That's because night elves are nocturnal creatures :Ð
---
Though, if you've lived in a country where basically night = winter and day = summer, it is a bit different...
---
&gt; night shift work for much better pay, I will never take it. Worst thing I could do for my health and quality of life.
---
even if you will be doing only night shifts, for 3 days a week, paid like full-time work?
---
I miss the old dk runes and stances.
---
I hate today.
---
Fortunately it's a joke.
---
Shill!
---
no if you miss one week you might as well wait for the next classic
---
I farmed POD for hours on end since the % drop was so low. I remember I posted it on the forums and someone offered me $150 bucks for it. I sold it to the guy and bought more wow time. I was only like 13 or 14 at the time lol. 
---
Marriage 
---
Always played horde so take this with a grain of salt:
---
It was my assumption that Pally's were considered the "best PVE healers" due to BoS, allowing your dps heroes to go ham? Vanilla endgame PVE is centered around threat so being able to manipulate it as a support is a huge deal. 
---
Blizzard has seriously dropped the ball here. I would have at least expected a WoW token for all my hard earned work. It's like they are not even listening!
---
You don't really have to dig tho. The character is literally called July. There's no other reason to call a character that unless it's a hint. If they're gonna drop hints into the screenshots, it's not a wild speculation that another one being named Osconty would point to a july 16th release date as well as the level being 16.
---
It's not a matter of efficiency, it's a matter of safety.
---
Let's same a mob resists your Blizzard, and starts beating your face in. If you have 2/3 imp blizzard, you can CoC it + the entire pack, and run a few circles, to re-group the mobs.
---
If you have 3/3 imp blizzard, you have to wait until the pack loses their Blizzard debuff, before you can CoC. It's really annoying to do.
---
What makes you think that?
---
Don’t do the same mistake as I did, by letting her play on your account. Once her mate was 60, she even started raiding on my account, and i had to pex another mage on a different account for her, while she was raising and gaining dkps! Once the new mage hit 60, we farmed the mc and bwl access and she got 6/8 t2, in 1 night, while my Druid was covered with dust!
---
Where do I enter my SSN to see the blue post link
---
Omg.. this sub is seriously going downhill. And not like razor hill. Seriously this content is such low effort. Like Arathi Lowlands bad!
---
absolutely insane
---
Your first sentence makes no sense at all. You can say you believe in God or not. Ultimately that's your opinion if you think God exists or not. 
---
Why are you so sure though?
---
Nah not really that bad. Like you know, theres months of sunlight constantly, but I wouldnt mind a longer period of heat. From may to august its warm and cozy, and during july it gets pretty hot on a nice day.
---
With sharding, the chaos should be manageable.
---
Oh man, no worries there.  I'm an older sibling... my accounts and the P1 controller are mine by right =p
---
Plus she has her own gaming laptop and bnet account.
---
I have an in with the mods let me check.
---
Ok, so basically all these downsides are offset by what, your wish to have the game be easier than it was? The game was designed around a population, increasing that turns the whole thing sideways. Are we not looking to play vanilla wow? The idea that there are some people who want an overpopulated server is no different from the people who would want summoning stones, or a group finder, or all the classes to be rebalanced. These are major changes from what vanilla was, why are we looking to make major changes to core systems?
---
1. The factions are not at war in the Vanilla timeline.
---
2. In this game, you meet plenty of NPCs from other factions, that you can't fight, that belong to neutral organizations.
---
I just want to seek out some world PVP while in the 40-50 level range. I miss the old 2 handed enhancement build and stormstrike and windfury crits. 
---
It’s April fools day so OP is being extra cautious when looking at posts on this sub - not trying to get bamboozled. It’s pretty obvious 
---
worst April fools joke ever. Boooo
---
Haha. I forgot about this...  and it actually sort of happened in Heroes of the Storm!
---
Older brother, unite!
---
&gt; even if you will be doing only night shifts, for 3 days a week, paid like full-time work? 
---
Only in rare circumstances such as there's an emergency at the company, but not consistently no. Would you want to live like that? Most people aren't.
---
How are there 3 different people commenting with the same name?
---
&gt; After they were corpse camping me for a while
---
Wow, look at that RP. I'm assuming you were roleplaying an immortal vengeful spirit, and they were roleplaying being the three charter members of the original Ghosbusters movie?
---
Is that for her to play or for you to play? Gotta tell her you need 10 hours per day
---
Well, if it were to be released the 16th of july, it seems weird that we still haven't seen a release date yet 3,5 months away
---
Blizzard needs to announce a release date. It's getting ridiculous 
---
Thank you sir or madam.
---
Sounds just like our first Rag kill.  It was the first time for probably 35/40 of us.  Nothing beats 40 nerds screaming in to their mics.  Will always be one of my fondest gaming memories of all time.
---
At least you won't have to worry about your TPS when you have Blessing of Salvation!
---
Muh purity!
---
Pservers had way higher populations than the vanilla servers did
---
Weak... lol
---
But that's so sad 😟
---
It's funny, because it's true.
---
I agree the Barrens will be very busy since it will host people from both Durotar and Mulgore, Westfall not so much because Alliance races are more spread out in their leveling paths.
---
Hopefully though the huge number of tourists that Blizzard is expecting will be gone (at least most of them) by the time people reach their second zones so sharding will be gone altogether.
---
HELL YEAH BABY I WANNA ROCK MY SHAMAN RN GODDAMN ASOJIDNHOUISRHGSRGSJIOP

It's an old one, sir.  But it checks out.

I'm never tired of that Raid.

Least favorite AQ20, fucking hell.

That was great :D

My rogue was a 29 troll back in vanilla and very early part of TBC before my group all quit.
---
I remember it was discovered there was a mail glitch where you could apply the level 350 LW armor kits to gear under level 35 through one glitch, and then send it to the twink in question with a mail item glitch that allowed the "soul bound" items to be sent at the same time the kit was applied.
---
He had the +40 stamina / crit kit on his petro spill leggings and the shoulder / helm.  Combined with the +15 agilty on the engineering parachute cloak, he was OP as Hell with the glitched  BiS items.
---
we have a baby due in the 2nd week of August so I told my wife I want to get to 60 before then, and to not expect to see anything except the back of my head for 2 weeks. 
---
She is on board. 
---
I think there's potential for a new type of druid player. The knowledge many of us have obtained over the years I believe will be put into effect, making some new and different styles, perhaps even changing up the meta for some BGs.
---
For instance, I as a rogue (in vanilla) would hate to meet a druid in pvp, because he could bleed me, faerie fire me, CC me, tank my damage etc. I believe in feral druid pvp!
---
Hahaha how nefarious. :)
---
The idea is that I keep telling her I'd like to play together. 
---
Some servers didn't have a Cthun kill till BC. 
---
There are some real gems in there!

let’s vote on if they’re amusing or obnoxious.

Mail juggle
---
Idk why I looked through ur post history but ur app idea nubbl is very smart and just wanted to say nice job. 
---
Going to train swords asap isn't about making op solely use swords. 
---
Blade of Cunning is good, but once you find a better sword it'll be nice not to have to run to UC. You can spend more time levelling your sword skill up instead.
---
Right?!
---
Like, maybe if they didn't want the MADCATZ controllers they should have tried being born earlier.  Blame our parents, not me.
---
Serious question, as i plan on maining a shaman when classic is released and I mailed a rogue in vanilla. 
---
How well do shamans heal when they're not in resto spec? While leveling if i plan on wanting to heal instances is it required that I play resto? Or would being elemental or enhancement be okay if I had a second set of gear to heal in? I would like to avoid having to spend gold all the time when I want to respec if I can. 
---
That actually would've been a pretty interesting experience. Could've been good for couples or parents/kids. I'm sure they had it on the drawing board at some point.
---
Yeah I tried out a private server as well. I had the same response as well. It’s amazing seeing people active in areas that have been empty for years on retail. I’m really looking forward to seeing how it works out on Classic. :)
---
You are too stupid to engage in arguments so never do it again.
---
Cho’gall is extremely fun to play with a buddy in HotS
---
&gt; The direction of the game in recent years has taught players (mythic plus being a prime example) to have no patience whatsoever for players who like to take their time moving through things.
---
Moving quickly in M+ is much harder then moving slowly.
---
Can confirm that 10 MBit broadband was very common in Sweden 2005, heck it was common in 2000.
---
I like it far more than the dumbed down one now but the old one had some significant flaws and wierd issues too since deathrunes were FAR too influential for being complete rng etc.
---
Just unecessarily messy which is why they changed it to this dumbed down thing we have now. 
---
Bet you are real fun at parties...
---
10 hrs? i think i'd spent 20-24 only at the launch day
---
I don't think there's any need to shard Westfall, that's the second zone for humans only, Dwarves and Gnomes have Dun Morogh and Night Elves are in Darkshore that's the other continent.
---
now that’s a funny and original idea!
---
You’d win that bet because I am fun at parties!🎉🎊🎉
---
It really isn't great for reading..
---
Sweet Jesus that was amazing... I may need to change my answer on the "what should the server cap be" poll. 
---
Really? He was telling me the opposite.
---
What's the class you don't consider?
---
A few things. I value vanilla more due to the effort/reward system and the feeling of accomplishment then i do for the quality of the game play. In retail, things just come to easy and class identity is non-existent. It feels really damn good just to get your mount at 40. Even leveling on a private server, I felt more accomplishment from that then how i used to feel doing almost anything in retail. Alot of that has to do with the atmosphere and comparative power levels and strength. Class was dark and dangerous. You knew that if you went into a cave and had bad respawns or pulled two of a mob, you could die. 
---
Interesting. Well our summers are ridicilous these days here on the westcoast tbh. Its super thick air and humid so its insufferable on days where it approaches 30c. So youre not missing out too much 
---
I did the same this weekend, plenty of people adventuring, the grind was just as I remember it. Caves are death. The difficulty is still there.
---
I understood that reference
---
Waaaay better than satanic demon hunter class that glides around the arena and ports through walls in battlegrounds
---
\&gt;be shaman
---
\&gt;See Orc Warrior next to you

---
\&gt;Warrior charges in with WF totem and gets an instant proc off MS
---
\&gt;I dont know where I'm going with this, have erection anyway
---
Yeah its funny how old jokes got turned into actual things by Blizzard. That's the kind of thing I miss about them.
---
I like this guys thinking
---
Sick vape pen bro
---
This is worst then Blizzards April Fools post.

http://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VMZZVAMIRfzAo
---
This is my preferred leveling spec. You can start farming as soon as you get blizzard, but I would recommend waiting until 26 for cone of cold. You can't start farming with only Cone of Cold until 32 (imp CoC 3/3)
---
I filled everything I wanted in frost tree first and then in the 50s move into arcane. Important take away is to rush ice barrier. 40 should look like this http://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZZMhMIRfzAo Never ever ever ever ever ever take frostbite. It's a trap, you don't want some mobs freezing, it will fuck your entire pull.
---
Arcane explosion crit talent is kinda filler. You can go 1 in imp Blizz and max it if you just want to CoC farm. It is far more mana efficient and you can use CoC to farm elites. Arcane explosion is kinda dangerous, so I usually only use it to burst down mobs when they start trying to run away.
---
This spec gives you all you need to raid early and your aoe farming is at peak. If you use Blizzard in your farm (It will kill packs faster and is reccomended. CoC is the safest method and is a million times more mana efficient, so use this on larger pulls and elites.)
---
It's only rng in frost, blood and unholy had 100% death runes
---
Also root melee, charge+stun casters, and DOT+FF everything.
---
Poll source? 
---
Same here! That 40-50 range right after launch will be critical in my wpvp plans.
---
I was surprised as well... SO many players!
---
.
---
Do you guys think it feels this way because the server pop cap is increased, or do you think it'll feel the same with the old server pop caps?
---
Best regards,

Come and join us on the countdown to classic discord friend :) 
---
That mouse clicking was hard to watch for a PvP video.
---
but then we actually got.. [The Arcanite Ripper](https://www.wowhead.com/item=39769/arcanite-ripper)
---
Aye true. Still ridicilous in frost tho
---
HYPEE!!1!!!11!
---
That is exactly how i feel about classic. "Caves are Death" I love it. I remember fearing all caves. 
---
Det var det jeg tenkte. Selv fikk jeg aldri akseptert søknaden hehe. Hadde flere venner i CORE. 
---
Haha I get it “blue post”
---
&gt;  they tell me it won't be fun, that it's nostalgia that is getting me excited. I agree that nostalgia is a factor, but I also still feel that wow classic was a better game. 
---
I hear the same garbage from my friends who play retail - your friends are wrong. Listen to your gut and enjoy Classic. It's that simple!
---
Vanilla servers were capped at 2500. Pservers regularly had 8k+  
---
Your friend is a douche and you should ignore his crap
---
all the more reason why theres no reason to play anything BUT feral druid am i right guys
---
I don't need frostbite, I'll just use two Freezing Bands... oh wait.... :)
---
I created a different bank alt for each kind of mat.
---
One alt for herbs, one for clothes and leathers, one for ores, bars and jewelstuff, one for boe's, one for white mats, etc. 
---
A week or so after reaching 60 I sent all the shit back to my main, leveled both my professions to max skill and sold what was left (which was close to 500g. btw)
---
If they pull through with sharding 1-20, do it. 
---
If not, don't bother if you want to actually play the game.
---
I asked others why they think classic will be better than the current. People have valid answers and opinions. Stop being pathetic and let people have discussions.
---
Sweden isn't on the table I linked, but the table stops at "6000 and up", presumably this is Kbps, so 6Mbps, and in 2005 the highest percentage of people with internet that fast was 3% in Netherlands.
---
From what I recall, 2-3Mbps was about the standard for "fast" internet here in the US at the time.
---
Oof that's eberassing... Getting so hyped over a hard class lol
---
I know it's not critically acclaimed or anything, but I loved (and still love) True Lies.
---
Combat swords is the way to go. 
---
I love that video, but lets be honest for a second it was a pretty unfair comparison.
---
still funny tho
---
There won’t be any chaos. There is sharding. 
---
Yes we were ahead of the curve when it came to broadband. The initiative to bring fiber to the people started in 1998 if I remember correctly.
---
Got my calls ready boys
---
Thats exactly what im thinking I will like about classic, I remember reading how someone put the situation and thinking that they had said it best "In vanilla you were a nobody going on an adventure  to become a hero, now your a hero going out to do his daily chores".
---
and maybe because the rhythm is quite clearly beats on 1 2 3 "and" rest on 4 then "and". I've literally never heard them before so I listened to it just to try and pick out the rhythm, and it was pretty obvious. 
---
Any particular seasons or episodes you'd recommend?
---
When were there improved graphics during classic?  
---
You said, imported graphics are classic, so when were they implemented, or are you making shit up?
---
From what I know there are 2 ways: combat rogue (with swords pref. thanks to sword spec and human passive) or dagger sub with imp. ambush.
---
The 2nd one is riskier in PvE as it relies on you hitting an opener which means when you find yourself with pants down, aggroing 2 mobs by mistake while not in stealth, you might as well start planning your corpse run. But it does give you a nice edge in ganking(especially clothies)
---
Man I wanted that class so bad. lol
---
Yeah, In Vanilla you work from the bottom up and it is about character progression. Also, things were inconvenient. It took a long time to get places and do things. Everything is to easy in MMOs right now. You should be forced to be in the world and explore. 
---
Looks pretty good. But you need 3/3 elemental precision. You can drop a point in improved coc for it. 
---
Also, you want to go 5/5 magic absorption. You should drop magic attunement and arcane resilience. 
---

---
Real talk, I met Chamillionaire at an MWR event. He was super chill. I asked him if he was there because it was his punishment for "riding dirty", and he promptly asked me to leave.
---
Hi, /u/magifek
---
Aren't all the profs available at level 5
---
Good point, I'll look into that too
---
Lionheart Helm, Big Bad Pauldrons, can't place the boots though.
---
i got so tilted on rift , every damn mmo i played mage was the OG of the game, i go once to play a mage in rift when it came out im the joke of the classes 
---
I don't agree with stances. It seemed to step on what made warrior unique, but actually worse because it had 0 drawbacks with what spells you could use in a particular stance.
---
Back round. 
---
Just wait til naxx release.  It'll be way better.  Ive read a lot of success stories about the people that were patient and waited until around 1940 or so to get in on the gold rush.  Just shaking their heads at those suckers in wagons.
---
pvp was dead way before WoD was ever thought of 
---
There was this joke one year about Diablo mobile game so it looks like they still turn jokes into actual things.
---
Rly just depends on what lvling experience you want. Combat swords is good grinding, fast lvling and consistent damage, but pvp specs with daggers are a lot more fun in stv, wpl etc. Pick whatever you think suits your playstyle and goals, is always more fun that way. My 2 cents anyway
---
\&gt;  Druid can solo it 
---
It probably depends on gear level. If you have decent gear/spec it's probably viable, since the payoff at the end is worth the time. Just don't go OOM.
---
Whats the deal with calling expansion packs, "add-ons"? I don't know of any games that call their expansions add-ons.
---
R14 mouse clicking and kb turning. Shows just how bad people were in vanilla and how much it rewarded time over skill lol.
---
I AoE levelled a mage back in BC, but just remember using blizzard most of the time.  I'll have to try the CoC method method to see how it works.  Thanks for the advice.
---
Or Disc. Holy gets benefits of SP from spirit with talents
---
&gt; he basically told me that all my experiences on private servers are completely different than what it was really like
---
That's true.
---
Thing is, Classic will be more similar to Pservers than actual vanilla. 
---
Times have changed, people got better at games, the info is easily available, so even if there will be some numerical changes from Pservers, people will quickly adjust.
---
Any general tips? 
---
let me make one thing clear: youre not going to be warlocking or warrioring your way to victory (this means youre not going to randomly hit them for a 4k enraged/bg berserking buff crit and feel like a champion)
---
i dont even know where to begin with this post. druids can be the slipperiest, most ultra double alpha and omega troll class. theyre so hard to pin down. theres multiple specs that are surprisingly good at dueling, which makes initially encountering them difficult. even within a spec there can be multiple ways to handle a certain matchup, and if they have engineering, things can become even more confusing
---
the capacity to stealth, sprint, root any unwanted threats, pop out an instant stun, leap around with feral charge, do reasonable ranged damage even if melee specced, remove poisons/curses (curse of tongues is op), heal any necessary targets, get away with surprisingly high crits, break out of combat casts (shadowmeld), disable rogues via faerie fire and roots, endlessly break crowd control, and so on is just so radically different from every other class
---
with ingenuity and enough times failing to learn what kind of hilarity you can get away with regularly
---
if youre not willing to be clever, youre in for a bad time. if youre willing to experiment and exercise patience, you might truly enjoy the clever design of the class in pvp
---
I actually do both. If it’s the same as private servers, I do dm n dogs and bugs, then run out the entrance and run to dm e, jump down do lashers, I usually do them in two packs since I’m pretty new to it still, then drink reset /camp repeat. If you are good at it you can do 5 if each within the hour and completely maximize ur gph. I think I was getting around 70g per hour if not more. 
---
I mean a song twisting buffing spec would have been really cool. Rift had a dedicated buff spec that was engaging to play and made a huge difference in raids if you had a good one. 
---
So...priests and paladins can dispel magic including lock DoTs right. Devouring plague is shadow damage and instant cast so it’s pretty good. Compared to something like star shards...well, there is really no comparison.
---
Good points about troll though
---
Today would be the worst day to announce a release date, being April Fool's and all.
---
I think it really depends on how you look at it. 
---
Resisting 1 out of every 3 stuns In PvP (10% passive + orc 25%) will be pretty huge against stun heavy classes / builds like. rogues and druids. However, classes that don’t really do much with stunning (priests, Mages, etc) it’s basically a wastes racial as it won’t ever come into play. Plus, it’s RNG bases. Which means some fights you’ll get crazy lucky and resist every rouges stun and some fights you’ll get shafted and eat everyone. 
---
All this to say, against the right classes, orc stun resist is amazing. And against the wrong classes, it can be straight up useless. 
---
However,  beserking will always have the same potential to be useful no matter what you are fighting. It may not have the game changing swing that resisting three stuns can, but it has better consistency across the board. 
---
In short, play what makes you happy. Racials do matter, but gear and skill matter a lot more.  
---
i  buy a new rig for me and my wife get my old. We play together. She played a holy priest and me prot warrior. :)
---
I kinda wanna make a shaman now, but i find like every class so fun so idk how to decide
---
Unfortunately not. I pulled this from the subreddit style. I'd be interested in the original thread if you find it.
---
Going into the crypt is a bitch because it's part of the main Duskwood questline so it's not really optional unless you want to miss out on some great rewards. Once you come out Mor'Ladim is *always* there... **ALWAYS**.
---
Now we can waste our adult lives!
---
The spec you want to play will be the superior choice.
---
pick whatever you would take if you were going to fully commit to roleplaying basically. it usually ends up being the most enjoyable
---
the money is secondary; you dont even need professions to get gold
---
i do, however, advise taking skinning on everything when youre leveling. it can be brutal to level a gathering profession prior to 60 on a new server just because of the sheer volume of players sucking up resources. however, we dont know what sharding is going to look like nor do we know if resource respawns are going to be static or dynamic yet. skinning is ultra passive free money as you kill everything since half of the creatures you kill in the outdoor world for quests are skinnable. itll make your wallet less strained and make getting your first mount way easier
---
from there, since itll be ages until you get your 100% mount, you can abandon it and go back to get some other profession youd like to keep and take a break from leveling and enjoy the perceptibly mclaren-esque speed of your first mount
---
Night elf female, double flips, low expectations, mailbox dancing, one hand on the keyboard and the other one on the...hey look, I found Rexxar!
---
FYI I'm pissed because I didn't even know this joke was happening and I'm on the damn team.
---
u/spearmints is a bully
---
Half the vanilla creators make videos about nothing in a vain attempt to stay relevant to promote their bland streams.
---
What is this PvE you speak of?
---
/u/spearmints stole my ~~lunch~~ shill money. 
---
Nobody really talked about it on my server. We mostly talked about the Ashbringer a lot. I remember vividly a guy actually started to kill thousands of the slimes in Eastern Plaguelands for days because he was *convinced* that they dropped the Ashbringer!
---
I don't really know how much PvP I'll be doing, since I'll be on  a PVP server there will be a bit of world PvP, and I'll probably run BGs for a few PvP rewards.  I'll see how much I can improve at PvP and see how much fun it is this time around.  Back in vanilla I was a Gnome Warlock scrub in PvP.  I plan on settling on Tailoring/Engineering at 60.
---
oh yeah Cho'Gall!  I forgot about that.  me and a friend were quite good at him despite his gimpness
---
I did too...from a certain point of view

*Are you from Norway or Sweden? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children? Work? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious guild for grownups without any obligations.* 
---
**Guild Information:** Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who’ve matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities. Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids, going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept. Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other way around. It doesn’t matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week, there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members. Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.  
---
**What we expect from our members:** In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.

Vanilla. Lots of weird things happened lol 
---
“I never trusted Blizzard again”
---
A very good mindset to have for the following ten years lmao
---
[This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4zeur/class_breakdown_classic_wow_according_to_large/) and [this one](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics) for example put Shamans at 2nd behind Warrior on Horde.
---
I don't think there's a single survey I've seen that hasn't had Shaman at something similar. Hard to say how many will stick with it or whether the demographics will shift in line with what you see on private servers.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed the hilarious tags today. :)
---
For all those wondering, what this past gem is all about:

I think hes talking about an ass.
---
I used to do AV with 2 other mages, and we would respec Imp Blizz when raiding was done for the week. Two of us would lay down rank 1 Blizzard in choke points and the other would go max rank until OOM, then rotate to rank 1. The CC, damage, and shatter crits was orgasmic -- probably more satisfying that double trinket PoM pyro.
---
Is WSB leaking? Of all places 
---
We still have literally 0 details on this. People all assume sharding means 8 people per shard, when it could be 100.
---
Would leveling in a duo change the choice at all?
---
My favorite was World of Warcraft coming to console with World of Warcraft: The Molten Core. 8 pixel console game :D 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Molten_Core
---
Obviously paladin. 
---
F R E S H
---
paladin?
---
Hahahah this is amazing
---
On the other hand, there were lots of videos like Vurtne ones, sporting a blue geared guy killing noobs in epics. These ones were way more entertaining than those geared clickers IMO
---
Back off, voodoo man!  This one serves the light now and has been bestowed with the blessing of kings.  He's literally 10% better than with you!
---
always played paladins on Pservers, loved the feeling of sometimes being a heavy hitter but most of the time buffing everyone, once classic hits im gonna roll a shaman first tho, gonna be fun to see everyones dmg bump up when i join a group :D
---
Man, seeing this also reminded me of the Wisp April Fools joke Blizzard also did. 
---
If it wasn't 1.12 talents, I would recommend an assassination/sub hybrid focusing on ambush damage optimization. Not because it's good, but because it's fun.
---
In vanilla u had to do each grp individually so id only assume it will be like that, also, no other class can buff spirit (except scrolls) iirc
---
You normally get 1 one priest to spec to pick it up. It’s ok for druids/priests/mages but it isn’t a huge deal. Yes there is raid wide buffs as long as remembered to buy the reagent.
---
Is this the obligatory april fools joke?
---
I work for the us post office. I would have had to of known the launch date back in December to be able to even have a chance to take it off. I'll have to settle for some time after mid September to catch up because that is when the next time off block starts
---
Combat swords or hemo at lvl 40 or so is fine. Daggers are super bad levelling.
---
But does Mark of the Wild override a priest's spirit buff?
---
10 hours in a morning
---
Good thing you're here.
---
Never do what again?
---
True, true! And they don’t have to complain as they played for years with the controller not plugged in!
---
ZG?!?! wtf are people on.
---
meh
---
Nothing wrong with having two, I plan on doing the same. Everyone here is right though - unless you have an ungodly amount of playtime, you’ll pretty much have a primary and secondary. 
---
You’ll want to focus on getting your primary leveled mostly and getting some 60 gear first. But as other people have said, it’s not a bad idea to leave your alt rested in an inn and switching back and fourth every now and then to break up the grinding. 
---
If you stick to the game long enough, you can definitely have two grades characters. Just one will definitely get there before the other. 
---
Still using grid + clique today :)
---
Or just referencing the video.
---
Blizzard’s April Fools jokes are actually great ideas that for some reason they don’t implement ☹️
---
After typing all of that, I remembered your original inquiry was a hybrid raid/pvp/aoe spec. So my bad.
---
Here is what I would run if I truly hated the idea of respec and content was only T2. http://classicdb.ch/?talent#obZVMGzfZVAMI0fzho
---
This drops your only viable AOE farming method to CoC. It will be slower at times, but you can make up for it with massive pulls and only need 30% attention. If you have a second screen just load up a show you enjoy.
---
No winter's chill might turn some heads if anyone notices but your other mages will pick up the slack in raids. 
---
The reason I go less arcane is because in PVP, the only super useful talent after 2/2 Arcane subtly is going to be Imp CS. Arcane Res is another trap, it's like 150 armor.
---
It just isn't worth the extra 15 talents you could put into fire. 5.5 sec CD Fire Blast with 10% stun chance is strong. You open with a frost bolt or CoC for slow and then spam the shit out of scorch as you kite. Pyro for fun, but its mostly to unlock imp scorch.
---
No you cant
---
This is great, thanks!
---
&gt; it's not a story-driven mmo and it shouldn't be tried to make like it.
---
When I leveled my first toon during vanilla, I read every quest along the way (probably why I never hit 60). To me, the game was about continuing through the world that had been created by warcraft 3. It was a story-driven MMO that my character was the main hero to. 
---
However, years later, after playing games like FF14, I can definitively say: You're correct. WoW is not a story driven mmo, but that doesn't mean there isn't a plethora of story in it. Maybe that is why some of us want to play it. Before Blizzard decided to do the standard Blizzard story line of "Hero is now bad guy" (Read: Deathwing, Arthas, Sylvannas, that one girl in Diablo 3, Kerrigan, etc)
---
I don't see why a Warbringer series would be a bad thing, but maybe because I'm interested in the lore I have a different view on it.
---
It's what I dream about too 😖😖
---
Truuuuuuuu .
---
Ah ok thanks.  Are there ANY buffs that override it (pots, food etc)?    
---
Are you serious? Believing in god is by definition a  belief and not an opinion.
---
&gt;Belief  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; an acceptance that something exists or is true, especially one without proof. 
---
&gt;Opinion  
---
&gt;a judgment about someone or something
---
I believe that BfA exists and my opinion is that it's bad and Vanilla is better.
---
I don't know what the server cap was on the one I tried, but it was listed as "full". Each of the starting zones were packed with people, and the major cities had tons of people all over the place, which really made the world feel alive. I don't know if I have a real opinion on server caps, but I would air on the side of making them slightly larger than vanilla. Having a world that is packed with players living out their epic journeys outweighs the downsides of scarcity of quest mobs and resources, IMHO.
---
If you are lucky enough to escape from Mor'Ladim, Stitches gets ya! 
---
Ah you right, my bad.
---
otoh on alliance u dont need as much tps cuz allies have -tps buff for the dps
---
I've never noticed tags before. Only mods can do it?
---
he..uhh.. might be a bit too young for that southpark episode 
---
Max rank: 40(?) spr - single target and group (5 man); in full raid had to buff 8 times.
---
Priests get 1 mp5 per 6 spr while not casting (+8.33mp5 from buff). +10 healing from buff if talent taken.
---
14/34/3 or 14/32/5.

IMHO, NS is a waste of talent points...all for an instant HT every 3 mins.  There's hardly any benefit from any off the other talent points in Resto that you'll be grabbing to get NS, except for Furor and maybe Insect Swarm.  The 15% additional effectiveness from Rejuv isn't worth it either in my opinion.  Those 16 talent points can be better spent elsewhere.
---
where is dagger hunter? 
---
I haven't looked at it that way...but you sort of have a point
---
I considered it, but I feel skinning is almost worthless early on as it's so "accessible" and everyone will be just skinning each thing they kill.  It basically floods the AH with mats and makes them almost worthless.  Ofc you could always vendor it and still make more money than not having it at all.  
---
All that said, I will probably go the Herb/Alch route.  Here's to hoping there's some herbs left.  /cheers
---
No, only spr won’t stack. You get the rest of the stats from MotW
---
Right there with you. I was gonna wait, and had been playing D2 for a while to fill the void. Eventually I broke down and made a Human rogue after having been Horde since about mid Vanilla. So much fun. 
---
Party wide. Not raid wide (I wish tho) 
---
I think that the best class for dwarves is the Warrior Class imo.
---
I think its gonna be very strange for you due to the limited time you had with pre-Cataclysm WoW. Even by the end of wrath they kinda started making changes that were more representative of the modern formula such as balance and taking QOL to a bit of an extreme. I recall a lot of stupid changes at the end of wrath. But starting post-wrath doesn't mean you wont enjoy it, rather you're not the target audience for it. Nothing wrong with trying and seeing yourself. 
---
&gt;  I decided to try a vanilla private server and didn't think id stay long but surprisingly I loved it 
---
Alright, then imagine your experience on private servers except far more accurate and less broken scripts/mechanics, you've got WoW Classic.
---
u dont really need aoe talents for lasher farming ( if it will even be any good now lol)
---
I mean you can simply use the fire aoe and then spam the arcane aoe
---
I agree, which is why he didn't watch any more of it lol. He woke up from his nap without me noticing. I walked in and he was glued to it.
---
Hahahahahaha 😂
---
&gt; Never ever ever ever ever ever take frostbite. 
---
this is the problem with the hybrid build
---
u need it for pvp but for aoe farming it can be a big problem if u got it
---
&gt;Mod's
---
&gt;To this end it has been decided that perhaps allowing people to toggle their realm type on the fly while sharding all available realms may provide the experience our players are after while retaining optimal server capacity and ensuring peak player experience.

---
Thanks.  16 buffs (fort + spirit) every time a wipe, with drinking in between = gsw to the head......!!!!!!
---
Zandalar pot for 50 sta/spr
---
Gotta defend the Alliance-side tanking. You'll enjoy tons of nice Pally buffs, Blessing of Freedom to make you immune to all CC, and those Dwarf Priest Fear Wards to make boss fears a tiny concern.
---
WF is fun but you're gonna love all the benefits on the flip side too ;)
---
Haha, the classic team has earned their April Fools day joke this time. Well played. 
---
daggers wont work now cuz u cant frontstab
---
go for Riposte in the combat tree
---
then whatever u want.. ideally keep going combat or u can branch into subtlety for the hemo way ( especially if playing on a pvp realm)
---
These posts give me flash backs.  
---
I got three day banned from the official Classic forums for replying to a Kralnor post by saying "Kralnor gtfo"  
---
People used to call each other all kinds of names on the old forums without a care in the world.  
---
hahah! thats great! Time to teach him how to farm gold for ya!
---
Really depends on the server. Some legitimately do have lower pop than normal servers. Others have 3-4x the pop of a normal server and account for it by massively increasing spawn rates and resource regeneration rates. 
---
I played around with the talent calculator.  With zero theorycrafting or research (and going off from what I can remember), is this pretty much the go-to build?

Hey I responded to the person above you on accident. Up there is my recommendation for an all rounder spec. I personally would just pvp in the spec I first listed until it was time to switch to fire in ZG. The more you want to all round, the more you give up in each area.
---
I am reasonably sure he was still a burly 35 elite through Burning Crusade, I remember being pretty proud of soloing him at level 30 on my hunter alt by kiting him down the north riverbank of the zone, most of the way to Darkshire. 
---
I only server fisted myself
---
My surface pro will be used to play on the go. I have a Pc for gaming when I’m home. 
---
This is interesting, thanks. I would have never guessed shaman would be so high from my experience in vanilla or private servers. 
---
ok, guys, how simple can you be? ITS A !&amp;$%ING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, if your not a staff user, GET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!

"I know, you've told me!" is the response you get when you remind them that you're going to be no-lifing it.

 **&lt;TBD&gt;   {Alliance PvP}   {West Coast Semi-Hardcore}   {LC}**   
---
**What are our goals?**
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We won't be chasing server firsts but we do intend to be among the top guilds on the server, and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server. Depending on the way classic pvp is released, we may have a ranking pvp group from the start. We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged.   
---
**Why should you join us?**  
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids  to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released.   
---
Raid times are favorable for all NA timezones. They will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST.   
---
**Want to know more?**  
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly. 
---
If they're fighting a mob, you attack and take them down to as low health as you can without killing them, then let the mob kill them so that they take durability and get a repair cost.
---
Or you can just wave and ignore other players and only attack if your defending yourself.
---
But I will say that if you've never played on a pvp server  before, the first time you see the opposite faction and actually get attacked, the adrenaline will be pumping lol!
---
Can't comment much on rogues because the class never appealed to me, but I played a priest all through vanilla. In PvP, you're definitely viable as more than a healer. The rest of the team might want you to heal (and healing in PvP is a lot of fun to me), but healing isn't required as shadow PvP is definitely strong enough to have fun with. If a rogue blows all their cooldowns, they might be able to lock you down long enough to kill you, but you're not nearly as squishy as you think. I rarely had many issues with mana in BGs, but I went disc/holy as PvP. You might have a little issue with mana as shadow, but most bursty caster classes have that problem. 
---
You can also just roll both and try them out. Vanilla was a much slower game, so feel free to invest the time.
---
That’s saying only 1 priest buffing. 
---
You’re likely to have at least 4 priests, give or take some...
---
Yeah I think that's pretty much it, I think some prefer over PW Fort and PW Shield. The good news is Light Well sucks anyways so you're not missing anything there.

Intended raid/play time: 8pm - 11pm PST

Mostly looking to casually lvl and eventually raid, as well as looking for social aspect of being in a guild. Played as a Hunter in 2006 until/through Burning Crusades. Re-rolled as a Paladin during the same time and through WoTL. Stopped playing when I reached lvl cap of WoTL. Just started up again recently on a private server about a month ago and looking forward to coming back when classic hits. This time around, thinking of rolling as Warrior.
---
Alt with big bags. 10g a bank bag slot is a hard pill to swallow vs a new lvl 1 alt with 4, 5g bags. 
---
The title of your post is literally "Will WoW Classic be fun?". That's my interpretation of your question. You don't have to like it, that's fine.
---
Ah yeah. Pally buffs are definitely raid wide to that class, the others might be just party? 
---
I knew it was gonna be this lmao
---
Feral Blade is the best Sinister Strike weapon you can wield as soon as you learn swords at level 10. Playing as horde, you should have three vendors from which to choose:

---
Can't believe he was from Spenny! Only realised this very recently 
---
They wanted Demon Hunter to be in the original version of the game, as well as in TBC. After we killed Illidan they kind of put it on the back shelf until there was an appropriate time to bust them out again
---
No one's forcing you to play like that.

Atlasloot
---
Far too many buttons for modern wow
---
Thank you! Yea I'm glad I have been able to narrow it down to two classes at least. Both spark my interests and I know I'll be happy with either. I don't want to spoil anything on a Pserver so I'll just wait and probably try both to 20!
---
Oh hey, thanks! Still working away on it.
---
Thank you lol
---
That's the worst possible advice to anyone who wants to raid lol.
---
6th twentember?
---
They're refering to items added in that patch and the .5 tier lines including the new bosses. Not items that exist in 1.2 forward that received changes.

Straight up died at least 10 times before hitting 10. Definitely need to adjust to the difficulty curve of Vanilla after playing so much Legion/BFA faceroll. The furbolg caves in Teldrassil were chock full of corpses.
---
I've been playing on a private server and oh boy is leveling rogue difficult. These murlocks are out here kicking my ass at every turn. Of course ganking makes up for all the heartache but I thought I'd commiserate. 
---
No, I said if you don't check the box, your graphics are classic.
---
What are you even talking about? Are you just arguing for the sake of it? Haha i literally don't have any clue what you are talking about.
---
I'd hire you on the spot.

Lets be real. Pedicures make you feel pampered AF. 10\\10 this deal is a win-win

I'm still waiting for this for real

Can Damage over time spells be partially resisted with resistance?  
---
For example if a priest casts Shadow Word: Pain on me and I have high shadow resistance, Will I reduce the damage I take each tick?
---
It was a known troll posting on mmo-champion that started this rumour. He's previously made other wild claims which have all turned out to be wrong (name of upcoming expansions, release dates, etc)...

Thatta boah

Younger sibling here, just reading "MADCATZ" made my hands hurt and gave me PTSD
---
Lmao
---
The whole point of sharding is to prevent the initial chaos. What details do you need?
---
Awesome thanks.  It's amazing how many different specs are viable as mages.
---
There is an enhancement build you can do where you are basically just a totem bot (for melee groups) who auto attacks and off heals. You'd have to talk to raid leader about doing it though
---
You have to remember skill was relative to everyone else's skill
---
"I'd say you're exaggerating, BUT" 
---
It implies that I'm NOT saying it due to the reasons stated after...
---
I would really recommend starting from the beginning. He got very serious about things later in his career and here you can witness him really being silly and finding his tone and you get all the speculation about what will this patch with its new raid or dire maul change in the game. Will this new instanced map that's going to release for pvp-only called battlegrounds, change the ganking behavior. Reading comments about why blizz is going to give no honor when you kill a player that's 10 levels below you. You can relive the hole vanilla time span and it's just great to not only have the perspective of today's content creators that now every single detail inside out.
---
Combat swords is most optimal, but IMO boring as hell. Spamming SS and Evis without relying on stealth just isn't fun to me.
---
Personally, I like daggers. Talented right you can wipe 50% off a mob with your opener. If you aggro something else you either have to CC it wisely or vanish, before getting yourself ready to reengage. It also makes PVP more fun. It makes me feel more like an assassin, which is the kind of character I like playing in any game.
---
You get some great swords via dungeon quests around lvl 40, so combat swords typically shines there; or you can go hemo swords (sub) and have fun with that. Again, not as optimal for grinding but I personally prefer it. 
---
I've mained rogue since vanilla and know what I like about the class. YMMV
---
Paladin Master race. Buffs all of same class in raid. The closest thing in Vanilla
---
Windfury gives you extra threat generation... On your melee swings. But 30% threat reduction makes a bigger impact, overall.
---
Irrelevant. Any half serious player will have an alt to aoe farm brd/diremaul or solo tribute runs. Hat or they will get rare patterns/play the AH very well.
---
&gt; ZG will probably be #1 as it was one of the most accessible raids for casual and hardcore alike.
---
ZG is my favorite raid because it oozed atmosphere, the encounters was varied, both in tactics and composition, you didn't have to do the bosses in any particular order, and it was just plain ol' *fun*.
---
Oh, and you could mount in the instance, and it wasn't Yet Another Dark and Fiery Place.
---
Vendor them and use the money to buy enough water to do a dungeon run.
---
In the US we write: Month/Day/Year
---
^^^shhhhhhhh
---
That and the fact it was a 20 man raid made a big difference. It was very well designed. 
---
Absolutely and he also did not shy away from a controversy or potential shit storm.
---
June would be amazing, but my prediction is July 12th, if it gets released in August, that is way too late for a summer release and not as many people will be playing.
---
But what if you like eating puss?!?!?!?!?
---
Well yeah, but Twins.  
---
Mother. Fucking. Twins!
---
Oh, warlock tanking was fun as hell, but the aggro switching and ability switching got fucked up on practically *every* first try. Screw them twins. &gt;:(
---
Alcor's sunrazor bis hunter weapon
---
Yeah I've listened to most of episode 1 so far. Good stuff!
---
I sharted when I read this
---
That's definitely your best bet! And if you still can't decide between them, call make one your main and one your alt. Or co-level them depending on your mood when you log on. 
---
You didn't sound like you had much desire to heal, but I would suggest you try it out. It's challenging and a lot of fun! 
---
Nope, i dont think any class buff overrides anothers, only exception is threat totem of shamans and blessing of salvation but that can only happen in tbc so
---
Blizzards plans to ease stress on servers.

📜 **&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an **EU Alliance** guild that intends to roll on a **PvP** server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
***What to expect***
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out &amp; play internet games once or twice a week for fun. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server, but we don't plan to raid on it, as it is just there for us to jump on and have some fun now and then, and also test out the classes and make our final decisions until launch.

My personal favorite was the 8 bit MC game.
---
I’m not talking about the added items. Savage Gladiator Chain from 1.2 was 2% Crit and 20 defense, it’s BiS for Prot and Fury warriors. By 1.12 it lost the defense altogether. Not every item was buffed in the scourge invasion. 
---
That’s my understanding as well. 
---
There are changes. No changes ship already sailed. 
---
Ah, the wisp race, that was entertaining as well. 
---
Any Dads/Moms guilds out there already? Very willing to join tbh.
---
Lasher farm is faceroll easy on a mage. By p2 you should be able to do it with no talents at all just nova, flamestrike, coc, maybe an arcane explosion or 2 and gg. No special talents required.
---
Yeah, I vastly preferred 20 man raids.  I was an officer of a large guild and while I have a lot of good memories from MC/BWL overall I would never want to try to manage any of that again.
---
To be completely honest one of the things they brought in later that I really wish my guild had back in the day was the flexible raid.  My guild raided but also didn't *mandate* attendance which means we had to go well over 40 "regular" raiders and it always sucked to have to have some people sit out or have too few, etc.
---
You've gotta include the "Book of Kralnor" alongside it, for others to understand the great wisdom of Kralnor.

The Elder Council is a new and growing group compromised of friends made through my Twitch streaming. We already have an active community, a new D&amp;D campaign, and lots happening, and I'm looking to start this guild as a place to enjoy classic wow with friends and get new friends into the game. 
---
**Faction : ** TBD - I'm leaving this up to a majority vote in the guild. I prefer Horde but would be happy with whatever we end up doing. 
---
**Region/Server :** TBD NA PvP - Likely Eastern NA to accommodate as many time zones as possible, with raiding times certainly evenings in NA timezones. PvP in order to have the opportunity to enjoy the experiences as a community and a highly popular server.

Which server did you join? The temptation is strong for me as well!
---
There will definitely be more than vanilla for sure, HOWEVER, this poll is based off of subredditors not regular players. I can bet there will be TONS of hunters and druids. Most people still don't like totems I Believe
---
The Black Temple attunement joke was so insanely detailed people actually believed it. Nowadays it seems to be on the level of "arrow to le knee".
---
My favorite April Fools joke from Blizz (besides the 2-headed Ogre race) was the /panda command.
---
Type /panda to have it pull up a Panda Express menu, type your address and credit card and voila! Panda Express delivery while you play. I was so frickin excited, then genuinely disappointed. But they got me 2 years in a row.
---
If all the past expansion launch days are any indication, we'll have plenty of time to set up interface preferences while the servers catch on fire.
---
Druids are amazing Dedicated offtanks. 40 man raids are large and a lot of tanks are needed, but not all of the time. For many many bosses you only need 1 tank. So the 1-2 prot specced off tanks will slap on some dps gear and dps. Then sometimes you need a lot of tanks for some bosses or some trash pulls. So some of the fury warriors slap on a shield and go help tank. A Druid will be better dps than a prot warrior offtank who has to dps, and will take less dmg than a fury warrior who has to tank. All the while being able to Heal/Innervate/Decurse/Abolish Poison fights as needed.
---
I will admit a Fury speced (0/31/20) Off Tank brings some of the same benefits. My Guild is planning on running 2 Prot speced Warriors. 1 MT 1 Main OT. Then 1 Feral Druid OT and a Fury OT. So at any one time we can have 4 Tanks speced for tanking to varies degrees.
---
Depends on the meta you are playing in. If everyone is quaffing action potions your gonna hate your life as a rogue especially in large scale pvp where you will get focused like a mofo if you get into enemy lines.  
---
Im doing the same thing with my brother but we playing a little TBC so not exactly the same
---
Like pandaren in wow?
---
why though?
---
&gt; Personally, I like daggers. Talented right you can wipe 50% off a mob with your opener. 
---
and while you're moving slow as hell trying to line up that opener the combat rogue has ran in and got it to 50% already
---
stealth openers are a pve dps loss due to the time lost getting in position its better dps to literally run in and SS SND etc
---
Playable goblins but the only class is DK hit me on a level I cannot describe.
---
never gonna happen
---
arena matchs would be 10-30 seconds
---
TBC added resilience and class overhauls with arena balancing in mind
---
classic has none of this, it would be a giant shit show
---
Why would you need to buy it then? At least lie coherently my dude.
---
I'm gonna be honest man, I genuinely cannot tell whether this one's an April Fools day joke. 
---
Yes, he mentions it down in the comments that it’s just a joke. 
---
There already is an arena, in STV
---
Alts bank.
---
No its BiS for tanks only woth defense version. Cadaverous is better for dps warriors. Savage chain becomes bis for dps warrior only after the patch that removes defense. 
---
such a non-answer. 
---
I’ll buy it if it comes with a phone

Nothing wrong with a hype call to the hype squad

I was blown away by how many people were playing. I thought it was going to be pretty desolate.
---
Ive died in every cave ive come across. I just cross my fingers and hope I can rez from outside. 
---
ok, I will! I definitely want to find some people to play with. 
---
What if they added that in a next patch? Could not do any harm imo
---
Warlocks ride in single file, to hide their numbers... 
---
I still think the hero classes should have been sub classes. Want a death knight? Turn your 55 Paladin into one. Demon hunter? 55 hunter into one. Monk? 55 rogue into one. 
---
I mained a human rogue until Legion! I went with rogue again to not spoil whatever I decide to play in Classic.
---
Haha just curious what other people think about it ;)
---
Abusing the system can lead to repercussions. This is not a very effective deterrent when the supposed "victim" is asking to be reported.

---
This is probably what I will run at 60 for aoe farming and dungeons.  
---
LOL yes! It almost felt like this game was stop motion when I first played. 
---
I am not the one making unsubstantated claims.
---
I was a NE rogue for a while, while I did most of my PvE (through AQ 40) then I quit and rolled a shaman on horse side and focused on PvP, getting up to rank 12 before honor system changed. 
---
Vanilla was a big part of my childhood and while pservers don’t recreate that magic (fully), it’s a hell of a lot better than retail. 
---
Do you mean that warriors or maybe melee more generally needs to be more reliant on healers and less able to self-heal?
---
You don’t want unfixed scholo.
---
It was broken and the loot was rubbish.
---
Awesome! Are you leveling or do you get instant 60 on that server? Either way, i'm sure you're having a blast. 
---
You arn't going to have a build that does everything and pvp well.  You could gut blizzard and do like cone of cold kite spamming if you are really good at it.  Thats about it.
---
username checks out
---
Absolutely right, but ambushing feels more fun to me. I personally would rather be a bit slower and enjoy it.
---
BGs honor is just like getting exp from killing mobs in a dungeon . Proximity; damage doesn’t matter. Being in combat doesn’t matter. Killing blow doesn’t matter. etc...
---
Save your dkp. Commit to your guild. You'll get gear.
---
Doesn't matter what your class is, all that matters is you are in the raid group (or party) of someone who attacks the player who died. amount of honor is the same for the people in the group, as long as you are in the general vicinity. 
---
Nobody remembers Dire Maul.
---
This is, btw, one of the major arguments to NOT cap the server population at 2.5K. The world feels alive in all of its parts and not only in the major cities and starting areas.
---
Omg hehe this one awesome
---
People aren't really accurate. You don't usually get 8, it's more like 5-6 shamans.
---
This. 
---
And diminishing returns on honor per kill on the same player. Literally to the point where you're getting 1 honor
---
Ok thanks.  Not sure how I feel about this.  Wont botting be a massive problem??  
---
Botting truly sucked the soul out of PVP for me around Wrath time frame.  It was RAMPANT.  Blizz was doing absolutely nothing at the time to combat it.  It was a large part of why I quit.  It kills the game if folks are cheating while otherwise are putting in a tremendous effort.  
---
Please tell me Blizz has a plan to combat bots.  
---
Yes, definitely. Difference between 2K and 5K+ is quite big, speaking from my own experience. There’s always something happening on higher populated servers and even less popular zones are actually alive.
---
Honestly you’ll probably be running into a DKP setup. Either that or some other system that people use to try and fairly distribute the gear. Or you could run into a guild that gives all of the gear to vital roles first. Then let’s other people go for it. Either way do your research, find a group, and stick with them. :)
---
This would have been actually fun to play
---
We don’t know how the api is going to work, which means no addons until we do.  This also limits macros.
---
How likely is blizzard to enable the api during beta? If there even is a beta?
---
This interface looks decent, this must be fake, where is all the unnecessary clutter I come to expect from old pictures?
---
Oh man I completely forgot about that. Always bugged me seeing a decked out Warrior with a huge shield rocking a tiny dagger. 
---
Did that allow same faction?
---
Original unholy spec was so OG, fuarkkkkk
---
Loved that nearly unlimited gargoyle and raise dead, spamming death coil, AMS, pet and his stun, plate and still having self healing?
---
Just a BEAST in PvP. 
---
Garona. I was very disappointed tbh. 
---
I agree, I'm leveling one just now :)
---
I’ll be honest, if this was an actual thing in game I’d still be playing to this day. I loved guitar hero and went through three plastic guitars before I finally called it in. 
---
As far as I can tell from most of the pre BIS/BIS lists I've seen for Warlock anyway (I assume Mage is mostly the same stuff), many of the items are crafted.  Now granted most of them are BOE and you can buy off AH, however one of the sets that will be used for a while is Bloodvine and the 2% crit bonus it has as long as you're a 300 Tailor is crazy good.
---
My plan for my Warlock is to level with skinning/herbalism...skinning for instant cash at vendors during leveling...herb for long term cash from end game herbs that will make alot of money later.  During leveling I will bank all of my cloth, and at 60 I will drop skinning and replace it with Tailoring and power level it.
---
I may actually drop skinning early.  To level skinning from 225 to 300, it costs like 5G if I remember right, and I may not spend that.  Once I get to a point that I can no longer skin things as lvl 225 skinner, I may just drop it then and power up tailoring at that point.  At 225 skinning I should be able to skin mobs up to level 45.  Switching to tailoring then should be ok.  Alot of the pre BIS tailoring stuff starts coming online around level 50ish anyway.  Plus at that point I should be able to craft good bags to sell as well.
---
Start dropping fire nova, tremor, grounding and mana tide and try and peel that rogue, hunter pet and ret a paladin off yourself because your warrior just got frost novad and neither of you can do shit about it ;)
---
After having researched the subject more thoroughly today I have seen the benefits for sure. They bring a lot of soft benefits not necessarily obvious at first thought :)
---
Most guilds aren't running that many shamans (or that many healers) and usually only use 3 pieces of t2. You won't be fighting for gear any harder than other healers considering you can use cloth and leather as well.
---
Bro a guild "wants" 8 shamans. Unless it's the top guild on a server good luck with that. Most guilds are going to have 4-6 leaning toward 4. Most people don't want to be a shaman. It's a bit of a "trap" class.
---
That's what alot of people thought it was going to be after the video at BlizzCon 2007 where they revealed WotLK and a Paladin turned into a DK  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2IvDjY3CtQ
---
I definitely feel the server cap is contributing to it. At times I was having to fight for the first hit on mobs. I actually wouldn't mind if there were fewer people because of this.
---
Server cap in vanilla was around 3500 I think. 
---
3500 on a server is quite a lot. Especially at the start when it's all clustered in the same zones.
---
The resilience and class overhauls? Eh in a way it would man. At least to the #nochanges idea. Granted I wouldn’t mind the class overhauls because they started making all of the specs more viable with TBC. But I seriously doubt they’re going to add anything that’s post Vanilla. 
---
As a healer you will generally compete with all the other healers for more or less the same gear anyway since tiered gear in general is not that good for pve and the pre-raid stuff will get pretty far. Keep good attendance and you will be geared in no time.
---
yea actually that's a great idea.
---
You just said, “ this game is really hard to learn... except that it’s really simple.”
---
There is enough gear for everyone, if you stick around long enough. 
---
You don't need full t2 in one night. 
---
Calm down. 
---
And 8 Shamans is wishful thinking. lol
---
I expect it to be 4 or 5.
---

---
I laughed way to hard at that shit
---
fuck this post is so cringe. so many reddit larpers to wade through on here to just get some information about vanilla news. 
---
no shit people who like this game are playing on private servers. we have been for a decade. so excited for the slew of cannon fodder in bgs. 
---
Wow, as someone who only played WoW back in vanilla, and never touched private servers, I'm astonished at how silky smooth that mass pvp was. Back in vanilla that would have been a total lag-fest.
---
Great tps for tanks and rage generation
---
One of the worst things to come out of TBC, Cross Server BGs + Flying + Resilience = No one wanting to fucking PvP
---
&gt;Yikers.  
---
Yikes.
---
\&gt;Yikes.  
---
Yikies.

we can't type specific server names, but I assume it's the most populated vanilla.
---
I cannot wait

["WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?"](https://youtu.be/9E62iA6KCIQ?t=89)  
---
in vanilla I remember experimenting on my warrior with agility/crit. I was leveling in felwood at the time and I farmed a full set of "Of The Tiger" plate gear thinking I would be the ultimate crit warrior.
---
I got my ass handed to me by bears.
---
You can’t help but get in on that action!
---
you should watch south park. Cartman has a tutorial
---
You mean like Rogue? 
---
Welcome to the life of a mage
---
Exactly! However like with the other Hybrid specs allowed in raids, there is only 1 brought. 1 Shadow priest, 1 feral druid, 1 Fury/Prot warrior, depending on faction 1 enhance shaman can be ok for Nightfall. 
---
I can't imagine a raid group rolling with more than 1 Feral Druid
---
So I guess every situation differs from one another. Well that's not a bad thing. If it means that you can't predict what will happen so you get that adrenaline rush that urges you to take action, then I'm down with it!
---
Start saving up those PTO, vacation days and sick time...
---
I'm considering to give it a try. Already theorycrafted all 8 char slots and their way up to 35.
---
Priest will be second and exactly doing what you are asking. I'm going to grind a little more and equip my mage alt (No3) and leveling partner with a wand too. And maybe selling a few. 
---
Thanks for your thought provoking comment. I don't RP, but at the same time I don't judge the people who have fun doing it.
---
Git gud, noob, hope to see you out there.
---
But it is the right one. If you don't like the play style you are going to hate the class.
---
I love Vanilla as much as the next person but I wasn’t a fan of Nost. It’s crazy high population, spawn rates, drop rates, etc were a complete turn off to me. Also after on leveling on some other, older pservers, I knew how it felt to lose all my progress suddenly and vowed to wait for Blizz to re-make it themselves. Not all Pserver vets come from Nost, it was just the most recent and popular.
---
WoW Classic is not nearly as niche as you are and others are trying to imply. Pserver vets come with much higher chances of burning out, we dont know who will stay longer. 
---
If I recruited all my friends that I thought would download it and only play until level 10 that number of people would much higher than the four I listed. Just because you don’t see the lute of the game anymore does not mean others wont. 
---
I think so, yeah.
---
Vanilla certainly rewarded time but skill in Vanilla was real(though relative). Much of it was just learning how to play at a basic level on your own. Players like Namishin played long before Vurtne ever released his first video. And they couldn't even watch other players around them because most people were playing their 1st MMO and sucked. Plus, everyone was playing before Youtube/Twitch began force feeding people information. Players were rewarded for being able to figure things out on their own. The game wasn't just a race to the bottom where the most mechanically skilled players had huge advantages because they could easily draw on the community's years of innovation and experience. And yes, there were truly bad players who played all day and never made it to rank 14, even after many months.
---
Even 2K is a lot at the start. But once people spread all over the world and hit level 60, you’ll really appreciate the bigger population. 
---
Fun story- I was playing WoW and watching South Park simultaneously when this premiered. It opens up with the WoW graphics... I had to triple take.... when I looked back at my WoW screen, chat was exploding with “OMG OMG EVERYONE TURN ON COMEDY CENTRAL”!!!!
---
That aside, I started watching South Park in 4th grade and loved it. Didn’t screw me up too too much :P glad your son enjoys!
---
Yeah, because it fills such a specific niche. Things like this that make Vanilla so magical.
---
Didn’t see this on my server till WotLK
---
That's great! Now let's hope that Blizzard changes their mind about not giving us a RP-PvP server
---
You gotta believe! 
---
Set up macros and binds while auto running to quest adjectives for maximum leveling efficiency. Gotta get ahead of the pack at all cost, even if you have to be a clicker.
---
It was an actual game you could download and play. Idk where you'd get it now but it was pretty simple yet fun.
---
Just a friendly reminder, the last day of summer is September 23rd, so it’s very possible the game is released in September 22nd.
---
Stay strong boys!
---
Idk, there’s something intoxicating about joining in on the madness with everyone else.  I can’t explain it, but it’s a blast starting on a fresh server with everyone else. 
---
But yes, fighting over mobs is a pain in the ass.  
---
Classic.db is the database of an old (but still alive) private server. 
---
That would do a lot of damage to the premise of Classic servers. A lot of people are looking forward to WoW without templates/pvp stats. 
---
That shit was in mop not wod ya pleb
---
somebody finally f-ing said it thank you, everything went downhill from that point on
---
Not as cringe as your shit reply 0/10. News is always pinned at the top if we get any. 
---
I did not really connect with any of the character portrayals from wc3, so I was mostly interested in the characters from wc1/wc2 that were not shown in wc3. Unfortunately most of them were absent until the wod expansion.
---
Wow what a perfect metaphore.
---
\&gt; Minimum 5v2 because Alliance
---
\&gt;Still win because Horde
---
private servers are heaven the only problem is the lack of people playing it, my thoughts on this are , if blizz dares to change vannila in any way possible after release im back on private where i know itl actually be more vannila 
---
Is a 19 pally twink viable? With everyone going rogue and hunter I think it be fun to bring in some heavy heals with some survivability.
---
Wow... this is erie, but I did almost this exact thing (Gnome Warlock) and had almost the exact same experience. This was a test run for me as well and great confirmation that Vanilla is indeed far better than retail.
---
Those trips were brutal but they made the world feel massive as a result. 
---
yep, you could tell they learned this became an 'issue' since in TBC they made soooo many 1.6 speed tanking weapons - compared to the rather lethargic 2.0 Quel'Serrar 
---
Lots? No, Vurtne almost stands alone against the abundance of "newbs in good gear." And, Vurtne didn't release his 1st video until Vanilla was almost 75% over. The majority of Vanilla was not played under nurturing shadow of videos of mechanically skilled players. If you think otherwise I'd like to see links because I've watched—and even uploaded—many videos of top tier players (players in world 1st getting, or at least Naxx clearing, guilds) and they all look like ridiculous newbs compared to today's players.
---
MoP was actually a really good expansion. Questing was good. Zones were fun. Lots of treasure and interesting things to hunt down. Raids were, good-ish. I'd say the problems with the game were not MoP's fault... though it was surely a pandering attempt towards China(no pun intended)
---
I've scheduled my lobotomy for May. The surgically induced childhood will allow me to more fully enjoy Classic. Casuals might disagree.
---
Probably not a bad combo maybe even better than warrior priest. I just am one of those biased guys that doesn’t trust Druid healers with only one red for 5 man. 
---
You won't be able to frontstab, so combat swords.
---
2/10 lads expected better...
---
It's so shocking how much harder it is to learn how to summon an Imp, compared to getting the Legendary Sceptre of Sargeras. 
---
As a former tank and melee DPS I say: WE NEED MORE FERALS

Hahaha

We will have PvP and PvE events; these include - but are not limited to - farming Devilsaur, raid consumables, gearing under-geared guildies and possibly even city raids. We are mostly working adults which may cause us to clear at a slower pace, but our guild is competitive and progression focused - so we will clear content. While we are a raiding guild we also welcome social players to build and take part in our community.

I just love the way Shaman totems glitter and create a special cozy feeling when they're in the group
---
Also Windfury is one of the best ideas in the game
---
will do scrub see you in wsg :)
---
I think it would be terrible. I can understand why others like them, but personally I really disliked the addition of Arenas. I feel like they're really not in the spirit of classic. They're another thing that caused people to be in the world less often. 
---
I think I had 8 days played leveling to 60 in a duo. Also maxed out mining fishing and engineering during leveling so it wasn’t maximum efficiency. I still believe it’s faster than solo leveling a warrior. 
---
Fuck yeah I wanted a belf bard so bad
---
why not 1st april like everyone else?
---
Wow they really did it
---
What you dont have a phone?  Ppl
---
no it’s not. the question was what is the best rogue leveling spec. the answer is combat (with some room for debate based on play style). neither he nor you answered that. 
---
So that's a nice way of saying, "no"?
---
The real reason we need a beta is so that addon developers can create their addons in time for launch. 
---
&gt;The furbolg caves in Teldrassil were chock full of corpses.
---
that's mostly due to dynamic respawns
---
inb4 URGENT UPDATE VIDEO by TipsOut with this info
---
I had 2 60s and only played Vanilla for maybe a year before BC came out. So its doable, but make one your main. When it is pre-raid BiS, if you still have time before your guild starts raiding you can start the 2nd. 
---
You'll probably think eventually it's not with the effort to try and keep 2 top tier toons. Unless in a pserver style speed run guild.
---
"everyone else."  
---
Lots of countries like japan write the date as year month day. Why don't you? Because that's the way we do it. Why do you do it the way you do? Why do you drive on the side of the road you drive on?
---
As a retail player I did not get the joke until reading the comments. I have forcibly learnt to accept any changes blizzard makes however nonsensical in breaking rpg immersion. Luckily i enjoy the gameplay enough to keep playing lol. Can't wait for classic to get back into rpg elements and a change of pace from being bombarded with meaningless rewards!
---
Yes because you were doing half my dps while trying to manually weave kill commands while I was topping the meters while spinning a mouse wheel and reading on my second monitor. 
---
I played one on nost. 
---
They are EXTREMELY good in PvP.  You will melt every class in 1v1 and be able to take on multiple people on your own. You will be doing a ton of dot dmg (as undead with the extra dot, one application of your dots will kill low geared mages by dot dmg alone). You will be randomly stunning people all the time, healing back to full in no time from dmg alone, slow them with your mind flay, shield, dispel yourself and your enemies, while having a fear and being very tanky (lots of HP on the PvP set). It's not uncommon that the enemy won't even get past your shield before you kill them. It's pretty OP. 
---
Only one will be taken to raids. Guilds with a lot of warlocks will definitely want one (huge dps increase). 
---
You will be probably be forced to offheal or dispel for some fights.
---
Raids can get a bit boring, because you will just be there to keep up shadow weaving, but you can still try and beat.
---
The main downside is that mana sucks. You will oom a lot and have to spend a lot of time drinking. Hunters will make your life miserable. 
---
You need at least 3 points in imp Arcmissiles
---
Imp dampen and 1 absorption to Arc explo 3/3
---
Try to max imp cone even if removing 1 permafrost
---
Thats really the only "major" problems all the others seem fine for the mix of the 3.
---
Also depending on your chosen place to aoe frostbite is not a dealbreaker, DM:E is doable and probably faster without blizzard.

Planning on doing what I've always done, heal with my priest. Like most I'm in my 30s, have a mortgage, and a kid. 8pm happens to be when the family falls asleep so I have time to raid/PVP.
---
For years Thrall was the most important character in Warcraft. Playing on Horde, we would always go out of our way to defend him if there was an alliance raid on Org. I don't remember people really caring about the other leaders.
---
Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering
---
People aren't running 16 healers.  It's more like 1-2 druids, 3-5 priests, 4-7 shamans.  
---
8 Shamans you aren't even the most populated class in a raid.  
---
Gearing takes a while in vanilla, get used to it mate.
---
True story, I kinda would.
---
I have ~15 different people I'm trying to wrangle into starting on the same server, and my friend and I are also planning a weeklong yoga retreat mini-vacation for our wives for launch week.
---
I mean, end of the day, I'd be happy to have it sooner rather than later.  It would just be kind of annoying for it to drop like that.
---
Any news today would just be a joke though.
---
But there maybe something that follows the joke.
---
And why would we reference some obscure video from vanilla unless...
---
Especially when the video just happens to be a july 16th..
---
I'm planning to do this as well, healing in raids while tanking the occasional 5/10-man. I think i'll put more points in protection though, and less in ret.
---
Whole comment about wPvP and doesn't mention UO? Your millennial is showing!
---
The mods posted news about post-naxx rewards.
---
First, it's Monday and we don't often hear on Monday. Let them get through some of there meetings to kick the week off.
---
Second, there is no way they will even try to make a serious announcement on April 1'st  But then again.. well.  yea.. makes your head hurt thinking about it.
---
Let's hope for something tomorrow or Wed.
---
Dead link
---
Since frontstabbing isn't possible as far as we know dagger is going to be garbage. Maybe you can get it working in the mid-late leveling with a sick dagger with ambush into gouge into backstab evis, but other than that it prolly won't work.
---
Combat sword is the usual spec people go, I've heard people go Hemo which will allow you to pwn in pvp for not so big a cost.
---
because logic dictates it? the japanese version at least makes sense.
---
That would've been surreal. I was playing Star Wars: Galaxies when it premiered. I can't remember if they had a free trial going, or if I got a key from someone. Needless to say I was hooked from then on.
---
As someone who played a SP, DP is extremely good. Undead is definitely the way to go if you are going to be PvPing. You also get WotF, which is an insanely OP a racial. Undead is better by a large margin. 
---
You’re spreading yourself **really** thin, you might be mediocre at one, but below par on the rest.
---
If you’re leveling, don’t put points in holy.
---
At 60, don’t put points in ret . Pick up King’s and/or blessing of sanctuary.
---
So for PvP purposes:
---
TBC - a handful of PvP items can be beaten by PvE items
---
Vanilla - ALL PvP items can be beaten by PvE items
---
Still a massive improvement on that front. I really don't care if my PvP gear is good for other aspects of the game, I just want it to be the best for PvP itself.
---
&lt;Relapse&gt;
---
NA-Horde (Whichever server is high-pop)
---
Eastern time-zone
---
Relapse is going to be a community guild with a focus on inclusive, fun, guild events. We want to help people level, help people have fun, participate in PvP (both world and BG's), and eventually take part in end-game raiding at a moderate level. 
---
Our philosophy for raiding will be as such: We want an EPGP-esque system where guild helpfulness/participation is rewarded. We want the active players getting their rewards appropriately.  We want to be a focused guild, but we don't want to put forth the mountains of effort akin to multiple maxed characters. 
---
Raiding 2 days in the evening, likely 8pm-12am, EST.
---
Discord incoming. 
---
If this sounds interesting to you, please send me a message on reddit!
---
Turns out putting an arena in the middle of no where except anyone going directly to an instance gets no use and forgotten a lot.
---
Durotar needs it. There are not a lot of quest mobs and the quests are fairly linear, in that you don't have a lot of options about which order to do them in. Most of the quests are packed into the southern half of the zone, with only a handful in the north. This means that you are following around the same zerg of questers from one area to the next with little or no option to avoid it.
---
The Barrens does not need sharding. It is very large and most quest mobs are fairly abundant. There is also a lot of freedom in which order to do the quests which will cause the players to be more spread out, and allows you to do different quests in a different area if one is too densely populated with players. This also introduces the wailing caverns dungeon which will pull a lot of players out of the general questing areas for long periods at a time.
---
I'll be honest and say I really liked Garrisons.  I resubbed for 2 months when WoD launched and had a blast leveling up and building the garrison.
---
The rest of the game just couldn't hold my interest though.
---
I'm going to log in to reserve names but might skip the first day only if the server names are really unstable. I plan on fighting my way through the crowd until I'm high enough for Deadmines and then I can just grind dungeons from there. I don't think it will be too bad since they'll probably do sharding in the lowbie zones but we'll see! 
---
I plan on taking a week or two off work (SO EXCITED!) but I might not start that until the day after launch. The crowd doesn't scare me but server instability does. Other games that I've played have always had some instability on the first day of a new expansion so I'm expecting some here too. We shall see!
---
So, logically it makes sense to write it the way you say it. Logically the day makes no sense without the context of knowing the month. 
---
I'm sure it is, to be honest I've never really cared or played much attention to the 19 bracket.
---
WTF is a back . . round? Is that a tender cut of meat?
---
NOW I want to grill some Back round!!
---
Yeah c'thun was bugged/unbalanced for a while, it just couldn't be beaten. Also, even without this, c'thun is still harder than some bosses from naxx.
---
As I recall, a lot of that stuff went on in the Barrens. I don't remember it in trade chat too much, people were quick to report, and the trade channel was important back then. The Barrens was the wild west for trolly chat for some reason
---
**Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding**
---
**Synopsis:** Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
**Focus:** Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
**Playstyle:** Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. **Wed/Thurs 6pm-10pm(11pm if progression) EST.**
---
**Are we a good fit?** - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.

&gt;Server cap in vanilla was around 3500 I think. 
---
A bit more complicated than that. [Server cap was "more or less" around 3k, but it was dynamic. Hardware could handle up to 3.5-4k](https://i.imgur.com/yNWkujT.png)
---
Although Kern (Grummz in the picture above) did not explain why the cap had to be dynamic, this likely had to do with the fact that Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom ran on different "World Servers", aka both continents had separate hardware. This makes it likely that the dynamic factor was to some extent tied to population bias; Horde has a strong bias to be on Kalimdor due to city placement, and Alliance had similar bias toward Eastern Kingdom. For balanced servers this means they could probably go a bit closer to the hardware cap than for unbalanced servers, since the players (and thus load) would be more evenly spread between the two world servers. 
---
And, though this part is more speculative, it's also unlikely they actually pushed the limit all the way to the hardware cap since the population could easily shift a hundred players or more over to the other continent in case of world boss spawns, raid times, and other such events.
---
It’s just because you are LFG in trade chat.
---
Enough april fools posts ok.
---
Let’s hope they just surprise launch the servers in sick of waiting
---
You are writing this post out as if many people wont play the game since it takes so long time, and that they would play if the game went slower. I think you are wrong. 
---
You have lots of time to get to level 60 and to get decent gear. Maybe you won't have the time to raid in a top guild, but there will be many others with limited time that will enjoy this game anyhow. 
---
Lets say you level 60 once phase two begins.. now you have access to gear from dungeons that are "on par" with gear from molten core. 
---
You should also be able to raid sometimes as its not really too time consuming if you find a guild with likeminded individuals. You dont have to clear the raid in one sitting, you have a whole week to do it. 
---
Also, the game isnt supposed to be fair. You won't get any free loot just because you can't play as much. But there are many other things you can do to get some gear, or simply having fun. 
---
You can't expect blizzard to cater to two different audiences simply because of how much time they have on their hands. 
---
Maybe after the first classic cycle has finished you can raise this post again, or even ask the question if it was a problem. But I really dont think it will be a problem. You have two years of classic wow. You probably won't get to do everything, but most people wont get to do everything even though they might have more time than you. 
---
I can see that. It only drops off a handful of mobs in uldaman and its super rare. Not quite the ZF boe levels of rare, but its by far the best 2h weapon in the 39 bracket.
---
I ran a Druid in vanilla and was a huge PvPer. There’s a lot of weird information here. Let me give my two cents. 
---
Druid PvP can be a lot of fun but can also be very tricky. To do it right, you have to utilize your entire toolkit no matter what spec you are. Catting for damaging and stealth, bearing for mitigating and stunning, caster for healing and CCing, travel for kiting, you use it all. It can be tricky to learn but very rewarding to win with. 
---
Druids aren’t your typical face roll power class. You aren’t going to blow someone up in a few lucky crits like a mage can. You can, however, typically give yourself a lot of windows to out play your opponent. It’s a hard class to master in PvP but can be very good in the right hands. 
---
That said, there’s also some stuff that a Druid just wont ever touch 1v1. A good SL warlock will wipe the floor with you every time. 
---
Druids really shine in group fights. They are great flag runners, but people make it sound like you grab the flag and just sit there until you turn in. While a lot of the times you will be holding down the flag, there’s still plenty of good combat to be had in the flag room. I’d flag run a lot and remember plenty of epic battles holding that flag. 
---
As far as premades go, if it’s a face roll team you’ll be out there facerolling with them to get free honor or they’ll be facerolling so hard you’ll be getting flag and instant capping three times in a row. Either way, you’ll hardly be sitting around doing nothing (with the rare occurrence  of a premade vs a premade. )
---
Druids are more than viable in group PvP - even feral druids. They’re a lot of fun too. 
---
If your rolling alliance just wait to avoid the chaos 
---
yes, rising from the smallest to the bigger scale. there can be arguments made for going vice versa, but going from middle to small to big is just weird.
---
Extra hilarious that Activision bought the company that owned the rights to Guitar Hero in 2006 and then Blizzard in 2008. So in some weird, twisted way this came true (although not in the way that anyone hoped). 
---
True that. An extremely geared 49 with PvP rep gear is stronger than most fresh 60, and iattacked based 49 twinks can easily take on undergeared 60s.
---
They will be a lot easier.
---
Naxx and AQ will probably be a challenge for most people, especially if they haven't done those raids before, but before that it will probably be a bit faceroll like we see on private servers today.
---
[http://lmgtfy.com/?q=calendar](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=calendar)
---
All that 33 minuses, seriously?
---
&gt; Just a thought.
---
Not a good one.
---
it hurts to be banned.
---
Items like that are why I always preferred a bid system... Likely someone can use it for their farming set ect. But if your doing flat values it's getting sharded 100%
---
I mean you'll be fine doing this while leveling. You can slap on some int gear and heal whatever you want. As well as tank most stuff decently. But you're really gimping yourself by not having illumination  for raid healing, you're gonna be the first healer to always be oom. So if you wanna be that guy getting carried through MC then sure. 
---
My recommendation is to spec however you want while leveling, then respec to a holy reck build at 60. 25/27/0 is my favorite as you can pickup blessing of sanctuary as an extra utility for raids + more return dmg for tanking. Then if you want to go farm or do wpvp just slap on a 2hander and have at it.
---
Can confirm, you can melt faces with a shadow priest
---
I'm glad...!! :)
---
This is incredibly reasonable and in no way changes core gameplay or values of vanilla. I used to be a hardcore purist but I really don’t see if this was added later say a year or 2 down the line, how anyone could hate the ability to change hair and facial color/styles 
---
In vanilla I remember this to be a thing at nights. Alongside a shitload of Chuck Norris jokes. Chat went ape shit. When day came those conversations moved to the Barrens though. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kralnor_(alternative)
---
It was a waste of time. 
---
Can you explain further 
---
Was gonna say.. my servers lfg was active. People in trade shouldn’t be spamming lfg. 
---
This is why you quit your job
---
Definitely wrong about pservers not killing C'thun before Naxx release. Lol that'd be something
---
Depending on the build they're rocking they might have the 40% chance to get an extra rage point per attack. Which benefits from a faster attacking weapon, like a dagger.... I was an orc warrior so I was always trying to get my hands on the next best axe personally, but without a racial incentive a dagger was a legit idea.
---
I explained the logic to it. It's weird to you because it's unfamiliar. What would be even weirder though would be to Say "April First" and write it as "1/4"
---
Yeah it was crazy when he contacted me to buy it. I didn't think he would do it haha. Slowest weapon for lvl 39, the crits on that weapon is crazy. This time coming around again, ill be farming it. 
---
I'd go hemo with swords. Better than combat for PvP, even if combast might otherwise be optimal for leveling.
---
I consider shaman to be a trap class because 99% of shamans will never be anything more then a raid healer. Ele is good in pvp but, it requires some pretty hard to reach gear to the average player. So even that won't be accessible to most shamans. 
---
Most shamans see a video on youtube of someones world being ended in a whirl wind of crits and death. In reality shaman life is nothing like that. It's pretty slow and onerous and they're will be a whole crap ton of work before you can explode anyone.
---
At least 50% of the shamans who roll shaman day 1. Will be feeling some pretty hefty regret by day 100. To be clear though. I am not saying shamans are bad. They are amazing. I am just saying they appear to be something they are not to a lot of the initiated. They they are a "trap" class.
---
Arenas were a big part of class identity going to shit.  They have no place in classic.
---
Since it has no impact on actual gameplay and most people wear helmet anyway, this is he one modern feature I'm totally apathetic about.
---
It won't find its way into classic, but in the unlikely event it does I wouldn't care.
---
must be an enhancer thing, my friend had an equally packed ui in wrath :D https://imgur.com/a/gHDulzw
---
dp is a disease, but yes shamans priests palas and dwarves can cure it. also it has this stupid healing part, which is the reason its scaling like shit and why shadowguard will deal more damage once ur a little geared. also its instant cast, true, thats kinda good, but so is shadow guard and you can also precast that.
---
Dude you mean it won’t effect anything or the game play in anyway?! HELL NO DUDE NO CHANGES EVEN IF A TREE HAS AN EXTRA BRANCH I AINT PLAYING!!!!!111!!! NOCHANGDURRRRRRRRRRR
---
Game would be destroyed
---
God, that tier set is so hot...
---
Dagger offhand or dagger tank mh
---
Yeah I feel that. My original server used Trade for grouping it seemed, wasn’t until I traded servers in Tbc that I released that didn’t fly so well.
---
"scrub", the kid who couldn't compete for years on live servers so he farms bg's on a private server .
---
I'll never forget trying to make my way through Stone Talon Mountains, and a druid ~5 levels above me chasing me the entire way. I actually managed to freeze him several times, but there is just no getting away from a Druid. Especially when they can just shapeshift out of your slows/stuns -.-
---
So at 60, retribution isn't really needed to farm and kill what you need in solo pve content, and not get roflstomped in wpvp? Reckoning is that good?
---
Nothing like showing up to Redridge as a level 16 human warrior in almost entirely gray gear and getting 1 shot by some 40 hunter mind controlling his pet for laughs.
---
Lobotomizer was my staple weapon while tanking for quite a while. 
---
They would crush that poor tiger 😔
---
Thanks. Hmm... I think I see, so you’re saying the shaman is a man who must work hard on his path toward enlightenment and powers to defeat his enemy’s, by helping and mending one’s friends wounds for a long period of time? (;
---
If so, I think I’m okay w that, coming from a prof warrior main that’ll be totally different 
---
&gt;If you’re leveling, don’t put points in holy. You can play any healing class without points in holy/rests while leveling.
---
can you still reliably tank 5 mans, before and at 60, without consecration though?
---
the healing part of dp is not a pro, its a con since thats the reason the spell is scaling like shit. that's also why shadowguard deals more damage at something like +500 sd.
---
Exactly this. The hardest fights will just be the gear check fights. The actual mechanics were a joke compared to current raids. Mythic Cenarius for example is miles harder in terms of coordination the raid needs especially when it was progression.
---
Same. I’m going crazy between Reddit and forums.  No other game scratches my rpg itch hard enough 
---
Now they save it for their diablo announcements 
---
The amount of honor you get from kills even without dr on hks is miniscule compared to the amount you get from playing and winning games. There is nothing to gain from botting in vanilla pvp that you can't get by just joining a bg and sitting on your ass the entire game.
---
It's not a con, it heals for a lot in combination with vampiric embrace. Anyway, even if you think shadowguard is better, WotF makes undead the better choice, as you will be feared a lot in PvP. That racial alone makes undead better.
---
I had a friend who legit blocked me on FB in a rage because I got an invite to the TBC beta when he was a hardcore raider and I wasn't. 
---
Grond. Blood furnace 29twink Rogue.  
---
You literally gatekeeping here....
---
The post you reference was not even bashing the OP. There is *clearly* one best spec for leveling, and it is combat, typically with swords. The others are ok, but not as good. What's the problem here?
---
You don't need to be the primary spec to heal or tank in 5 man dungeons.  
---
Keep appropriate stat gear for each role and swap gear when you do the dungeon.  
---
Yes even without abusing the sit mechanic reckoning is really good. The trick to holyreck is to stack proc based items such as Maelstrom trinket and use seal of righteousness. Try to find spellpower plate items. Obviously this will be hard to do in the first patch, and I'll admit it's not as strong as a pure ret build in early gear stages. But you're extremely tanky and can heal yourself out of most situations even with just Lightforge gear. Paladins are way more gear dependent/gear versatile than people assume.
---
Fury Daggers is actually quite legit and the best setup if you're not a Human/Orc and have access to ACLG and good daggers (Perds, Pugio, Death's Sting, Harbinger, Maexxna's Fang).
---
I outline that [here in my guide](https://github.com/ppach/furyguide/blob/master/furyguide.pdf)
---
I think we'll see a lot more druids in Classic than we have in previous iterations of the game, but I have no proof for this. Just a feeling based on my time reading these forums and the official forums.  
---
Not so old school hardcore, huh
---
I was on an RP pvp for vanilla, so that may have changed my experience. Great server. 
---
You see a lot of posts here because people are trying to justify playing one, when they know it's not optimal.
---
&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at A13X#3733 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.(edited)
---
Holy shit that takes me back, I forgot this one existed. I remember the forum discussions when they announced this. 
---
As a tank, you would just be getting the first few chest tokens that drop from 4H over the rogues anyway.
---
Would it work? Sure yeah, but I wouldn't advise ignoring Mana tide, it's yuuuuge.
---
I played on dial up and would have to run backwards in IF, facing my camera away from the crowds or else my game would crash. It was then perma-crashed because it would constantly try to load everyone before I could move and crash again. 
---
I would have to call my friends high speed and have them run me out or wait until night time when population was down to move. Once they added portals between the major cities I did all my hanging out at Darnassus.
---
Bots are cancer and destroy PVP for genuine players (and let's not even get started on the effects on the economy etc)
---
The more I think about this, the more I have to 
---
1) give up on PVPing in Classic (which sucks, because I loved it in TBC)
---
2) just forget about playing Classic in the first place
---
This is how strongly I feel about bots in the game.  Im not going to set myself up for disappointment.  Bots destroyed PVP in Wrath.  Blizz did absolutely nothing about it, and didnt care (no communication with the community etc).  To hell with that.  
---
Hey feel free to hmu on discord at A13X#3733 and check out my post in this thread as well.
---
Any spec in dungeons is possible but if you want to spend your time efficiently you'd save so much time having a tank healer combo who can communicate instead of hoping to find others.
---
Obviously a April fools joke, still annoying flair though...
---
I’m still waiting to hear that Diablo Immortal is just a really bad and early April fools joke
---
They do need to add bards though maybe next xpack?
---
sounds perfect! thanks
---
If you change your mind about playing on an RP server (we will just be on a pvp server) you can check out my guild post in this thread and/or hit me up on discord at A13X#3733
---
ok, we will think about it, thanks
---
That is exactly what I am saying. Thank you for understanding that and not just berating me telling me how good shamans are like most people do lol. I know they are amazing they are my favorite class but, they are not for most people.
---
So you are saying that there are some weeks that no one gets rank 14?
---
Everquest actually did have a /pizza command which you could order pizza with.
---
I'm sure that's where they for the joke from.
---
[Dirge] was tbc wasn’t it. That was fun
---
yeah you explained it, i just can't see the logic. *shrug*
---
I wasn't really expecting to see many characters in-game, but kid me always think that Baron Rivendare was Arthas. I never got to 60 myself back in the day, so it was a self perpetuated rumour that I couldn't answer.
---
When you skin a bear it aggros all nearby bears
---
not looking forward to this honestly
---
I think that would be so awesome because it would undercut all of the people who plan to no-life at release by essentially providing an even playing field for everyone. I can't plan to take off work for four weeks straight to play a game, but damnit I don't want to be power-stomped by no-lifers who are at 60 when I'm still in the 30s!
---
Druid/Rogue seems pretty strong.  Gank-train with a healer.
---
probably may or june
---
I was thinking that myself. 
---
This year was clearly some interns or CMs just mending into a Word document. 
---
Daddy Activision says keep it cheap. 
---
it's bad marketing to do that unless it's on a day with meaning behind it
---
If Blizz doesn't nail the bunny rabbit pathing in Elwynn Forest in not playing Classic.
---
i didn't say undead is shit, wotf is strong as fuck. i just said dp is shit when compared to sg. and imo the value u get from sg is better than the value from wotf, since it helps you in every matchup and not just vs warlocks.
---
The biggest thing I've noticed about pservers are the corpses in the 1-20 zones. Every corpse is someone who said "fuck it, this is hard." 
---
Granted, you are investing nothing but time on a pserver, but it shows how challenging even the starting content is. 
---
That's because trade chat is shared by all capital cities and general chat and looking for group chat channels were not (originally). LFG went global across the capital cities in 1.9, but many of us already used trade chat.
---
Gotteeem
---
Maybe dude works on Classic? Fargo Flintlock became canon.
---
Something is coming this week.
---
I believe we will see weekly updates from here on out.
---
I’m sure they’ll get it right. The wolves in Elwynn chase and eat them. If it were wrong then the wolves might run too far to eat them, and if the wolves run further then so will the players, and if the players have to run further to kill the wolves it’s no longer the same experience as vanilla. Everything is key to the experience.
---
On fresh, I usually go with skinning only and rush for 60 on less than 10 IRL days. Then farm as much gold as you can ans buy stuff from AH for cheap.
---
Last time, it costed me less than 40g to go engi.
---
Play a game called Darkest Dungeon. 
---
Nope. 
---
Yep, that's a joke jumping the shark right there.
---
That games so hard.
---
You can't link items in general chat.
---
in big pvp with rogue u focus particular objectives
---
not fight in the big zerg
---
Correct however, your character needs to be =\&lt; lvl 35 to learn the highest rank of any professional: 225-300 and that’s where most people’s desire is with The profession Cooldowns. Arcanite, mooncloth etc
---
I dunno, I thought it was funny myself. 
---
This is a meme now in my household. Every time YouTube autoplay puts one of his videos on, for the next thirty minutes or more I randomly shout ... Hey guysss... TIPS HERE.. It's TIPSSSS!!! 
---
She's such a good sport.. I'd have dumped my ass so long ago.
---
My entire year has been planned around this launch lol im ready at the drop of a hat. Thats your fault not planning mr.!
---
 Just have to quit work, life will be there after launch. Classic launch however is a once in a lifetime event.
---
Sylvanas is the poster girl for Moms of Azeroth. :V
---
It sure is. But then again classic WoW isn’t a walk in the park either. 
---
The bigger the beast the greater the glory. 
---
We will have a 3 part looting system that includes loot council, "wishlist" item for the current raid, and luck. We would like to offer the best in preparedness, but also want to be open to a total of 80+ unique players who want to play the race and class they desire! We will have priority raid group, and secondary raid groups. and sometimes these groups will inter-mix to gear certain players from the main raid.
---
Play some old classics
---
Off spec healing is perfectly viable on the way to 60. As enhance you'll want to keep a set of int cloth to swap for it you're healing a dungeon. As ele, you'll already be wearing  enough int gear to heal. Endgame dungies are different though, there are plenty of healers seeking pre raid bis gear who will do the job. In raids full resto is mandatory because everyone wants mana tide totem. Sad because some hybrid healing/ele specs which leave out mana totem are super fun in pvp and can heal 5 mans fine.
---
Take 2 out of the improved strength of earth, at max level it gives something like +9 strength not worth it for 2 talent points. Get either the defensive totems for the cooldown reduction on grounding totem, or get 2 points in dodge. 
---
The rest looks good, healing way so you can benefit more from downranking is good. But as the other commenter said, mana tide is pretty big. It can save a group from that big pull where you need to shoot out your best heals all at once and you are left with no mana to finish the fight.
---
Remember when you are healing with this spec to do damage, it's something easy to forget when you are focusing on healing.
---
19 priests are really strong as heals.  Ridiculously hard to kill and strong spells.  Some people do crit wand builds with agi that are ridiculous too
---
&lt;Lakeshire Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance)
---
I played a priest to 51 and a warrior to 60 in vanilla and honestly your spec doesn’t matter until 60. I actually rerolled my priest because of how bad tanks were. 
---
Region: NA
---
Server type: PVP
---
Faction: Alliance
---
Raid times: 7:00pm EST - 10:00pm/11:00pm weekdays whenever weekends.
---
Priority: Raiding Hardcore/Semi Hardcore and PVP
---
Class: Warlock
---
Have some raiding experience from vanilla and plenty from TBC and beyond.  Looking to do the content i was never able to throughout vanilla.  Looking for a cohesive and active guild that takes things seriously but doesn't get too uptight.  Open to criticism and always looking to improve.  Willing to grind out mats,enchants etc.  
---
The truth hurts ://
---
Play apex legends 
---
Consider something like this; http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxibzVZxcfticoo
---
You deserve to be disappointed for believing that
---
Just dig out your copy of Warcraft 3 and play that. Then you'll be in the right mindset lore-wise when Classic is released!
---
I'm not saying garrisons as a whole are bad, I just think they should not be part of a mmorpg like wow
---
Today is not the day when we want big news to drop. Check back tomorrow.
---
&gt; Let’s hope they just surprise launch the servers im sick of waiting
---
NOOOOOOOOooooooooooooo.............
---
My employer requires me to put in vacation requests at least two weeks in advance. I need a head up on that release date.
---
One of the big draws for Raids with Shaman is their Mana Tide. It helps a lot for everyone in range of it. Beyond that you’re also going to be having fun with aggro if you’re healing and DPSing with no threat reduction. I’d say give it a shot though and see how it works out. 
---
Your friend sounds like a retail noob.
---
End game healing you need 20 points min in holy for illumination and that's really all you have to structure your build around. You can ignore the rest of the tree but if your main goal is tanking and healing then you can easily still do that with a full holy build. The real issue is getting plate gear with health stam/int, which is basically just tier gear or bust for most slots. Tanking dungeons without consecrate is nuts, so you either rush consecrate to start tanking at 20 or u wait and do your path which means 33 at minimum. But if you are already waiting I'd just commit to full ret until 41, farm sm for shield, and then switch into a comfy build like [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxzZVGuhcz](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxzZVGuhcz). Make sure to snipe any level 40-44 plate of the eagle gear you can find while leveling and now you are god mode, enjoy pulling 2-3 mobs at a time if not more depending on how beefy you keep yourself.
---
At this point you can choose 20/31/0 or 31/20/0 or 30/21/0 (the try-hard pve sanct buffer spec)
---
Holy Shock is good for single target tanking and world pvp. Holy shield is good for aoe farming and if a melee is dumb enough to attack you.
---
Gog.com has warcraft 1 and 2 for 15 bucks, also a good way to get back into some of the original lore of azeroth and get you even more hyped for classic!
---
Torchlight 2 is a fun rpg you can pick up for cheap.
---
We’re probably close enough to launch that I wouldn’t recommend getting started on a private server.
---
"nolifing it" completely aside, there are people who will treat this as an event. Like a vacation where you don't go anywhere. A staycation, if you will. They cant do that if it's released unexpectedly.
---
IIRC, you could still put the item names up there, there just wouldn't be a link
---
Druids will not be popular. They are not a very good class. Some people just can't let it go though.
---
But retailers will tell you, that nobody gonna play Classic anyway.
---
Do you think 25/27/0 is suitable for before you have gotten much of that spellpower gear, and haven't started raiding yet? [This](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqLzZVG0IcoxZV0xdb) 11/25/15 (points in conviction could go into prot for buffs or imp. conc. aura) seems superior for a leveler / new 60 who isn't raid healing yet, if reckoning is so good.
---
Exactly. If the wolves run too far were legitimately talking an extra 20-30 days of /played to reach max.
---
Hi, /u/Towelliee
---
tfw haven't played wow for so long that I accidentally got a life and won't be able to play classic as much.
---
I miss the real (old) Blizzard.
---
When I dinged 60 for the first time(Holy/Disc Priest), the first thing I did was I went to Duskwood and I ganked Mor Ladim. I hated that mob.
---
The extended Time between SoO and WoD is also a thing that hurt it, but that too wasn’t MoP’s fault. 
---
lol foh
---
Let's agree that they are both strong. I still think undead is a little better, but you've made me more aware of troll's strengths. 
---
Btw, touch of weakness also procs stun and it reduces the dmg melees do to you. Not super strong, but it comes in handy. I've gotten a lot of stuns on rogues who open up on me by keeping it up. Can also use rank 1 again to procc stun if you aren't able to cast anything (will get spell locked). I like proccing stun and getting stacks of SW up with rank 1 dot and ToW. 
---
While damage is nice, I do think survivability as a shadow priest is extremely important in PvP and while sure, having a somewhat higher chance to stun (3 procs vs 1) helps with that, you can't deny the importance of a spell that in combination with SWP and VE can heal you up to full from no life. 
---
I meant on private servers where all the content is already available, not with release schedules. 
---
Same. Just gotta get the kid hooked on it so I can play “with” him. 
---
Seriously, you could reverse this with someone trying to sell enchants and getting blasted with "LF TANK SCHOOLOMANE CAN SUMON"
---
But...Mor'Ladim is level 35.
---
:thonking:
---
James Cameron at his finest.
---
Skip rend. Sunder armor is necessary if you are going to do any tanking, which is likely.
---
You're going to give up on classic because of a problem that doesn't exist yet? nice.
---
I mean daggers aren't bad at all for warriors at low levels. It's not until level 36 that you get your first ability based on weapon damage (other than Overpower or Slam), so really, until level 35ish, you just take whatever weapon has the highest dps number on it.
---
...though, dual wielding is kinda bad since your miss chance goes through the roof.
---
No thanks. I'd rather have a beta / PTR first.
---
Play a pserver 
---
Everyone gets geared up eventually. You just have to stick around long enough. Healers are actually pretty easy to gear up as you’ll found out. 
---
Great response.
---
Does shield specialization suck or something? Why'd you avoid it in favor of armor? I imagine because outside of tanking we are using a 2h, and it's not essential.
---
Sounds like seal of command at later levels isn't actually worth it after god mode is enabled?
---
&gt; you either rush consecrate to start tanking at 20 or u wait and do your path which means 33 at minimum. But if you are already waiting I'd just commit to full ret until 41
---
which one would you do?
---
oh no how will I kill kobolds in elwynn without my addon profiles????? 
---
I suspect right click report will reduce this. Hopefully they don’t go over board though. 
---
Would be horrible. Vanilla pvp is way too unbalanced for arena style pvp. There’s vanilla private servers that have enabled skirmish arena and the average arena match lasts about 7 seconds. 
---
A different hybrid build, obviously, but not sure what your goal is. An enhance hybrid? Wont do as much as regular. Resto for raid and have some dps for farming or pvp? Ele would be better since gear from healing is more optimal.
---
I would be against having it added, just because if person A got their barber shops, person B would feel justified in asking for some other change.  That's the simple truth that keeps me 100% against changes like that.
---
That said, if they did add it and confirmed it was the only change they were doing, it wouldn't be a hill worth dying on.
---
If I play, I'm going to play a mage first this time around.  I like helping people, and I like being useful. And being able to AoE farm doesnt suck either. 
---
Nobody really 'wants' 2h anyway, they're PvP weapons that go to people for offspec. At least that was my experience with them on the last 3 private servers I played through.
---
The only 2h that people would really fight over were things like BRE, Asscandy, Dark Edge, etc. the really really good shit......but still PvP weapons since 2h PvE was not viable unless you were horde.
---
I got around that by saying "WTB X for Scholo," etc...  
---
Didn't need to do it a lot, though, since I joined groups more than make them. 
---
Nah resist the urge to play on p servers. Save your hype for the real thing and it'll be even better.
---
wtf MODS why is this pinned???
---
I'll share some shadow priest PvP movies to make the choice easier for you in case you haven't seen them:

Best shadow priest in vanilla. Raid boss tier. Melts multiple good geared opponents at once.
---

---
The OG shadow priest. Old rank gear and some blues. Earlyish vanilla (after shadow form was introduced). Awesome music choices. Loved this back in day.

Another good SP from vanilla.

Really good geared rank 13 SP from vanilla. Some clips from when you could use two spell dmg trinkets at once.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnyxvyQ0RY&amp;t=473s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnyxvyQ0RY&amp;t=473s) 
---
Extremely skilled SP from private servers.
---
It's not...
---
^^^that's ^^^the ^^^joke
---
&gt; I feel like every class could farm lashers.
---
I mean technically yes, but for most classes it's so slow that it's very inefficient.
---
Paladins, Priests and Mages are really the only classes that can farm lashers at an efficient speed.
---
Either way works. I AoE grinded just fine with 3/3 imp blizzard and almost never used Cone of Cold.
---
Perhaps on a private server.
---
In vanilla, daggers had a worse multiplier for rage generation on damage than other 1 handers. (2h handers had the best multiplier)
---
Just wait for them to release WoW Classic - TBC.
---
Since I don't think most characters will ever reach 60, I don't believe any survey at all. It doesn't matter how many chars you start, but how many hit 60 before classic becomes irrelevant. I mean, do you really believe 18% of the level 60 players will be warriors? They were notorious hard to level and I can guaranty you that 50%+ will just quit before hitting level 35. But druids and hunters, despite the fact they were lacking in the end game, were a pretty chill leveling experience, which means IMO they will be much more popular than expected. Plus, consider the fact that the vast majority of players will not have any alts - even though most people are planning to.
---
Decent DPS  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpCOYsMHorI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpCOYsMHorI) 
---
It wasn't as much as better so much as it was more consistent TPS. 
---
For leveling that's fine. For 60 regardless of your gear that isn't gonna be a great build. You're just not really giving yourself any of the real benefits of ret or holy. 
---
I've been playing 25/27 on ND with almost no spellpower gear and a mixture of t1/Lightforge. Using a vendorstrike with fiery wep. The power in this build comes from how deep you are into prot and holy, not necessarily specific abilities you may pick up (like consecration and reckoning). You're able to efficiently throw out big heals, and get smacked around quite a bit. You're not going to chunk people down like you would with full sp gear + proc wep + lifestealing + shadow oil + maelstrom like you will in bwl/aq. But you can easily 1vX most situations. 
---
I actually want to play that
---
Short answer, no.
---
Long answer, there is a small sample size and a lot of 'I'm going to play druid' posts and that makes them look more popular. Part of it is because it is such a poor (by comparison) class, stating that you're going to be playing one is more meaningful than someone saying "I don't care what anyone thinks, I'm definitely playing warrior.
---
Druids will excel at WSG, and will be great in world pvp. They'll continue to be 50% as effective at everything else.
---
the choice depends purely if you want to tank lower dungeons. I'd personally ret till 41 and heal dungeons with a casual int set. Verigans fist is awsome for this combo too.
---
You actually dont need to use a 2hander after u spec into prot. You sword n board with shield spike + seal of light/wisdom. Mara 1handers will hold you over to 60 better than the 2handers you get at this poiny anyway. The reason I dont go shield spec is because it's 30% of dogshit until you have end game gear.
---
I didn't play classic but bc and wotlk definitely used trade chat for a long time and I found most of my groups successfully through it 
---
i hear you!
---
touch of weakness has a chance to proc blackout. 1 chance, if you dont proc it on first hit you have to recast it to get another chance. shadowguard has 3 chances and deals 500 damage each charge meanwhile.
---
another pro for shadowguard is faster shadow vulnerability stacking.
---
I have a week away from the wife in June so I'm praying its here by then.
---
MC - boring
---
Ony - pretty fun, short quick to the point, not too difficult but not a complete pushover (atleast the nost version was a bit challenging with the added fireballs)
---
BWL - my personal favorite. Not too long, fights are flavorful and present a challenge while not being too overly difficult. Fun theme and flavor. Nefarian fight is one of my favorite in the entire game.
---
ZG - boring. Can be stressful with PUGs and due to the nature of the content you're gonna end up pugging it quite a bit. Never really looked forward to ZG nights past the first few clears.
---
AQ20 - not so bad. The trash here is a lot less tedious then ZG. The runs don't take as long and minus the last boss the instance is overall pretty easy even in pugs. Net positive.
---
AQ40 - I hate this place. The instance is massive so if you die the run backs are extra painful. Too much trash that respawns way too quickly. Progression is a nightmare. If you're in a good guild that can breeze through its tolerable but really not a pleasant experience. Cthun costs an outrageous amount of gold in consumables so if you wipe it can be very frustrating. Major roadblocks usually involve other raid members failing to show up prepared. I still have nightmares about the anubisaths to this day.
---
Naxx - first half of the instance is pretty enjoyable. Neat flavorful mechanics, not too insanely difficult. Second half is a nightmare. Just way too many required consumables. I had more fun in here than AQ definitely, but not a raid I would do simply for fun. I actually think the wotlk version of naxx takes the win here. Tho I did really enjoy the 40 man loatheb encounter. saph+KT are noteworthy as cool fights also.
---
Overall BWL is a clear winner above the rest winning in both the difficulty and flavor departments, finding that sweet spot between not too hard but not too easy. Even if I had a full BIS character running BWL just to try and record a sick log is fun which is something I can't say about other raids.
---
I sharded.  
---
Where is my family? D:
---
We're not flexible about the server type and nobody in our group is really into PvP. Good luck to you guys though!
---
Got me.
---
Is it weird that the Hand of Justice grind is basically what I'm looking forward to the most? 
---
For sure same to u!
---
Y’all need to learn how to eat the box. You can control her entire soul if you know what to do 👀
---
Trade and LFG were unified across the cities at the exact same time, together with the Auction Houses.[[1]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0)
---
We dont have a server list yet.
---
AND RPPVP are doubtful for launch.
---
Imagine actually *talking* to someone using a phone! The idea is so alien to me that I want to call bullshit on this.
---
Really? Are you sure that's not new? Can't remember that being a thing, although I don't know if I've ever tried.
---
Of course shadowguard is better than Touch of Weakness, that was never my point. 
---
Classic *end* of summer 
---
I was here
---
So say the server list is released soon, and it's the same or close to what we have now. What would you recommend. I wanted to join a rp server for the experience of the community
---
I would not skip charge. Rage is gold for a warrior. Sunder/revenge depend on if you are tanking or not.  
---
Really you're only talking about saving 2-3g by skipping a skill, so when a mount costs 80g it's really only slowing you down a very small amount by buying an individual skill. It does add up but personally I'd rather get a mount a level slower and not feel like i'm playing a gimped class for 10 levels. In practice it'll be a decision you make at the trainer every two levels and you'll have a very good idea then about which skills you use or want to level up or not, so there's not too much point getting all obsessed about it now.
---
Your build is split way too thinly, you dont excel in healing, damage, or threat generation, soooo good luck finding groups outside of leveling
---
We have 0 knowledge or information about the servers and server list, they might re-use names or they might not or they might use the names but not have them be the same server type.
---
Nobody can give you the help your looking for such as "Illidan will be a great Alliance PVE server".
---
First they steal err clothes, now urr daggerz
---
Getting flurry axe to drop while leveling my warrior made me fucking NUT
---
Lold pretty hard at the flair
---
So say we have the same list. I wanted to play on an rp server for the community experience. What would you recommend?
---
Not just each other, sometimes also bus shocking cms
---
Someone give this man a gold.
---
if (A) a server list is released before launch I would recommend choosing an RP server to join and maybe coordinating with guilds/friends to choose which one.
---
or if (B) there is no list released, then on launch day pick a random RP server with a name you like and get your friends to choose the same one and roll with it.
---
It will be random beyond being able to pick an RP server.
---
Six THOUSAND damage revenge crit! - Kungen
---
Their "plan" was to not have players autojoin a raid in alterac but form their own raid. Don´t know how much that helped. It was rather annoying.
---
I gotcha. Thanks dude! Tichondrius is such shit these days. The server used to be great. But it's not the same huge pvp server it used to be.
---
What's the point of 3 points into imp arcane missiles?
---
Also increases melee threat too
---
And the july reference is because he works on classic too?
---
Unfortunately, I wrote it all. :(
---
The only one I saw show up before TBC was the Murloc movies.
---
* Me, Myself, and Murloc
---
* Murloc in Manhattan
---
* The Murloc Candidate
---
* Murloc and Commander
---
* etc.
---
Don't skip charge or hamstring. Rank up thunder clap if you aren't broke. 
---
Sunder and revenge are important to rank up if you're tanking. Just one rank of mocking blow is fine. 
---
Mortal strike costs pennies to rank up, don't skip it. And flat damage of any increment is good for an instant attack, it'd be worth even if it cost gold per rank. 
---
You will make more money. Don't worry so much about it that you seriously consider skipping ranks of charge. 
---
Hot tip: Druids who heal love a shadow priest on their friend list. It's always good to have someone around who can rez more than once per 30 minutes.
---
Yup, it was quite common for guilds to have Instructor+Noth+Heigen+Anub down in Naxx before C'Thun or even Twin Emps. Raids were demotivated and not really nerfed by 2.0 so these guilds didn't clear further unless they went back for luls at 70.
---
     Really looking forward to the graph of opportunity cost for weapon swapping in execute phase.  The overpower thing is interesting too, I intuitively stopped stance dancing for execute once I got some more gear, even took one point out of improved overpower, so getting some info on that would be nice as well.
---
     I'm curious about the rage generation of white hits during execute phase, you established that bloodthirst is worthwhile if you have 2k attack power, but in theory it could be true at a lower attack power value to pool a bit more rage for the next GCD's execute.  For this reason I wanted to play dagger fury, that and I really wanted to swap out my Edgemaster's for Aged Core Leather Gloves, of course  you cover that in your dagger blurb near the end.
---
You can go to 60 without spending talent points at all and be an effective warrior tank / priest healer. It doesn't matter at all, and with that combo you'll be making dungeon groups in no time!
---
F that make him grind for you. 100g per night or no dinner.
---
Dial M for murloc
---
I was a pretty hardcore pvp healbot priest and I had a rule that whenever a mage volunteered free food/water to me (happened quite often believe it or not!) I would make it my job to keep them alive. Made two really awesome mage friends this way hah. Something about seeing that trade panel open and piles of food and water coming my way that just made me say “oh this guy...this guy deserves life.”
---
It wouldn't kill my hype, no, but on some level I like the fact that you have to look at that same hair for literal months. In the Vanilla community of old you knew people on your server by name, but also by looks :p
---
Not as hard as my dad though
---
Nah you need it. It's a major pain without and the whole reason why pally tank is so good in 5 mans.
---
Thanks that's a very nice message, I imagine that goes for a lot of men, you just don't hear about it. The best medicine is to have high enough standards for your friends and yourself. I have a feeling classic will have more circles of friends and fewer loners than it seemed to have before, just because everyone is getting excited and talking about it, build an awesome group for your game so you have the best experience from start to finish.
---
It won't be popular because there wont be much demand and 50% of the casual druids wont make it to 60. They're fine healers in terms of HPS, but Priest is better/more flexible and Shaman/Paladin have irreplaceable buffs, so raids will only want 1/2 of them.
---
People who only know Naxx from WotLK would be unlikely to vote for it in any contest IMO.
---
aww
---
yes its better than tow, but that wasn't my intention. its better than dp, and how is better than tow as well. on the other hand wotf is also way better than berserking.
---
if you value the benefit of wotf more than extra stuns, healing reduction and damage thats a valid opinion.
---
i just have to disagree with people advertising ud spriest coz of dp, that spell is not really that good.
---
10% luck
---
20% skill
---
Someone was complaining on the WoW forums that multiboxers are causing giant headaches for people with this right now but because there are no repercussions either due to laziness or greed (multiboxers make blizzard more money) I expect this shit to be a massive issue.
---
No.  Probably not aoe style.
---
The only reason I say not holy is because you spread yourself thin with talents (and honestly I forgot about consecration) . If you’re playing just to have fun, you can level with that and do well. It’s definitely not anywhere close to min max, tho. IMHO, go consecration then go prot to sanctuary blessing. You should have 19 points left(at 60) to spend wherever you want.  
---
One thing about vanilla, you have so many choices and they each affect how you play.
---
For me it´s monk
---
Your question is nonsensical on so many levels. 
---
I´m selling you my roll.. oh wait
---
You say you won't be excited by an extra 6 rage ... but you'll miss it. 
---
I hate to break it to you, but the patch notes are:

8.6.7 Build 5309

[8 6 7 5 3 0 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WsvUBvq14A)
---
April Fools jokes are supposed to be jokes. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=joke
---
Also Palas can tank dungeons which is nice. 
---
Will [The Nicker] be named [Blackrock Slicer] in Classic?
---
Lol I was the exact same way on my priest. I generally tried to keep tabs on who actually did work and helped out, and made it my mission to make them immortal when I could. If nothing else, I figured if they were having fun, they would likely play more. ;)
---
The opportunity cost graph is something that will be in the next update for sure. It is not too hard to make and will hopefully solidify my point.
---
The thing with pooling rage, as we see from the DPR graph, is that the damage efficiency of Execute decreases the more rage you have. Which is to say that Execute is most effective (meaning has the highest DPR) at lower rage levels due to how it scales!
---
By playing Dagger Fury, due to the nature of how much rage you're generating, it turns out that you'll most likely always be able to BT and Execute without consecutively which will, in turn, translate to the most rage to damage conversion.
---
The new meta in raids is less damage mitigation and more threat.
---
Fury-prot warriors that have no shield are huge right now and feral tanks are catching on.
---
This only work with crazy high dps that can shred a boss down in less than a minute. 
---
Basically the tank does a ton of damage so he holds threat no matter what while all the healers spam on him and the dps kill the boss before the healers go oom.
---
In this competitive high-end raid environment druid tanks are very much a thing, including Naxx cleared ones.
---
