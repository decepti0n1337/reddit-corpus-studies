I feel you, but it wont be as bad if they hide their char name/ realm list. At least then, only their guildmats will follow them, not every stupid fanboy.
---
---
---
Vs footage from 2006 yes. I'm hoping that someone can point me in the direction of someone mass AoE'ing on the Classic Demo so i can compare the two.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Source on that though? 
---
True, but I think a lot of people weren't riding the 420 train back in the day. WoW classic will be a lit experience ;)
---
Yeah, Monkeynews, who get 5 days /played on his warrior said he tries to get rank 3 within the first week to speed up his PvP grind. I leveled a character 1-60 going out of my way to PvP and couldn’t even get rank 2. He must devote some time to getting that rank. 
---
I'll be there 9am PDT to test out my (mostly) pacifist 1-10 run (to mimic a crowded launch) - I might stream it, but with 0 followers, etc - I don't expect anyone to watch.
---
And OP, the biggest issue with speedrunning and streaming is it's not really allowed. blizz doesn't allow unofficial servers, so anyone streaming with any kind of audience gets attention, then gets shut down.
---
&gt;  and there are some that are trying to mislead people. Like the videos advising people to explore in the early levels, for example.
---
Wat? I fully support exploration and fedex 1-10. We'll see soon how a paladin rates against other classes on a fresh launch.
---
First you gotta find which realms are in your time zone if you care about that. Then pick the one with the best name haha.
---
&gt;first and foremost is authenticity as our goal
---
&gt;
---
&gt;we want to create an experience that feels just like 2006 World of Warcraft

You're kind of right that sharding doesn't have anything to do with server caps in itself, but it does indirectly. Sharding is the tool they are using to support a higher player cap. They could for instance go with a 6k initial player cap and keep each shard at 2k until the launch has stabilized.
---
Yes that's true. I made that mistake the first time around and dont plan to do it again lol
---
It's a little ungenerous to dismiss Journey's run to 60 considering that it was a legitimate run for that server. Yes there are bugs but everyone had access to them, and he still was first to 60 there.
---
After reading this I'm having trouble understanding *why* this is good. Can someone enlighten me?
---
 if so many people - who are part of this community - want mega servers, should they be the majority then it's the will of the community.
---
Iirc they were on favor of vanilla realm size, outside of the first few months because of tourists but might be mistaken.
---
I don't dismiss him getting to 60 first. I dismiss the /played time he managed to get.
---
Having tested it both ways, the XP boost produces substantial changes to your routing and xp/hr.  
---
There are hundreds of ways pserver values don't match vanilla. Joana will always have the WR for vanilla, and we will have WR for the pservers, and a new WR for Classic.
---
No. It all depends on what you're doing. Running a dungeon with random people? Probably not going to be in character. At an rp event or rp spot? Probably going to be in character.
---
I wouldn't do this because I always somehow got lost in the Kharanos inn and couldn't get out for like 5 mins if I went in too deep. This was probably because I was playing zoomed in and keyboard turning. Good times. 
---
Oh badass. I haven't ever made it to AQ, so some great stuff to look forward to! Cheers
---
The xp from quest turn in is tbc values and not vanilla. That alone is going to add hours upon hours because you will be under leveled for each zone and require much more grinding. 
---
Actually the raid finders and dungeon finders greatly reduced the necessity for people to communicate and form relationships. If you can just jump into a group whenever you don’t have to take the time to talk to people or make friends. Yeah you get into content faster but you miss the part of MMO part of an MMORPG. 
---
And Southshore never really died until BC. Even after the PvP system dropped there was plenty of incentive to duke it out. Especially since you have to physically go to the AV and AB ques in Southshore and Arathi Basin. Ques are never instant and the best way to pass time is to battle it out with the people waiting for the que on the opposing faction. 
---
Even on a PvE server there was plenty of World PvP. Especially once the raid guilds topped out on content. We had guilds like Fires of Heaven and Forgotten Aspects launching regular city raids on Alliance cities. Not to mention all the que camping that happened on both sides of the fence. 
---
I think most people here are going to be really struggling to adjust to how slow Vanilla really was. Not to mention the fact that you can only get to around 55 on just quests. Beyond that it’s pure grind.
---
WF is amazing and all but  blessing of salvation is alliance only and threat is always an issue as a fury warrior with no aggro dump or threat reduction abilities...30% extra threat ceiling is worth it imo.
---
if you do roll alliance just go human, that sword spec racial is amazing
---
"Fixed"
---
Afaik it is a meme made by people from top guilds to remove as much people as possible from the starting zones. MN said as much during his warrior deepdive with tips.
---
I was also on twisting nether horde.  There were 1-2 serious raiding guilds.  Echelon and forgotten legion?  Then there were quite a few large social guilds.  
---
I enjoyed playing on RPPVP.  I noticed most of the RP was on alliance side in goldshire/stormwind.   I didn’t notice much RP but I did organize a raid on an alliance wedding once.  It was one of my most fun experiences.  It was like a slightly scaled down version of serenity now funeral massacre.  
---
Absolutely, and sincerely, as one... I also think we've made it. Maybe not 110% as we discover more (knowing the client even can reproduce spell batching accurately, etc-) but we've got all but sharding addressed for a real feels Classic Client.   
---
Now...   
---
\#Changes  
---
Really. What *would* we change, minutia, miniscule. Let's just consider, if we *are* rebuilding it from scratch... *Let the old tried and true remain*. 
---
Coordinates? Yes. Simple. Cartography, in-game, no reason to not be on the map.   
---
Item values-Knowing what you're holding onto, because everyone else seems to.  
---
People can still find them.
---
You forgot the alternative, they miss their release date and anger the customers.
---
Source that he exploited to get 60? Last I heard his run was confirmed legit by mods.
---
It is odd. I feel like Blizz only announced it to test how many people would be angry online. Some asshole trying to save money said "Come on guys they won't care, no one joins those servers.." So the real devs had to announce something in order to get the community speaking up about it.
---
[removed]
---
They did, it won't be ready by 2018, it won't be ready by spring and it definitely wasn't ready by winter :p
---
Where’s the rng in brood lords head? Was your guild rolling for the head? It should only go to people that have earned it and will actually put in the work to get it since almost no one actually finishes the quest line... rolling for it is almost definitely going to be a huge waste
---
He sure did, and yet, it's inefficient. My route is faster than his and I'm not the only one who gets better times than he does.
---
Shadow Priest. There will be max 1 in the raid. Its a spot every holy priest wants. Only really viable after ZG when you can get hit gear. The one in our raids can make good damage, but he cant keep up with other casters because his spells make way too much threat. He often caps threat and stop casting altogether. 
---
Pretty sure Marksman hunter is just the normal hunter spec? Your scaling sucks and you want the same gear as the melee that scale really well. So noone wants to give you gear. Basically a utility class after MC that is in raid to pull, kite and tranq shot. Still multiple needed for all content but overall seems unsatisfying to play since your gear progression is like non existent
---
Our old GM’s name was ChronicLord and we had a dude that would regularly huff dusters on ventrilo. Plus all of my irl friends would get stoned to the bone and grind BG’s all day. The good ol days.
---
Fury warr 1handed dual wield can be done just fine as any race. 2 handed fury warr, the slam spec, needs the weapon specialisation of human or orc. That’s my impression from a good long while researching anyhow.
---
Keep in mind that there are limits to how many 1handers drop, and rogues need them 2, so some guilds will specifically give 2handers to you, thus wanting you to be human or orc. All depends how up tight they are to be sure tho
---
I think stormwind harbor was added in cata, there wasn't a waterfront  before that
---
I'm guessing twat
---
The company stance was "we're not giving this to you" up until recently. It's not a passion project when that same company finally gives into the demands and gives it to us.
---
Keep retail as it was would have made them less money than making it more casual, which is why they made it more casual over time. If they get pressure to make Classic earn more money, it'll be by making it more casual to widen the demographic it appeals too, especially given that BFA is so bad that even casuals don't want to touch it now.
---
I dont think anyone wants to feel pressured to level to 60 within two months.
---
Joanna mentioned it towards the end of his last stream. It is hearsay, however, I've personally experienced the... lets call it behavior that he described, so I feel like he might not be lying about that.  
---
I'm obviously not going to discuss exploits in detail, even if they're on private servers.
---
Oh man I totally forgot about those caves it was so long ago. One of those last few quests that was in that massive barrow full of enemies was a total nightmare
---
I love them all!
---
&gt;He sure did, and yet, it's inefficient. My route is faster than his and I'm not the only one who gets better times than he does.
---
Questing or grinding mobs? Because there is heavy bugs when it comes to mobs on pservers when it comes to respawn and how they behave.
---
he's getting downvoted because you can't use that method at the start of classic since you won't have a high level character to boost with.
---
So 5% of their fanbase will roll on their server, while everyone else just plays the game how it's supposed to be.
---
Wish I was in Europe but I guess the next best thing is a RP server
---
Let's pretend that wow servers are a daycare and it has a teacher that comes and checks on the class every so often to see what was going on. 
---
You and your friend are in class and you're dueling and you're both casting polymorph on each other. In vanilla, the teacher didn't come by very often, so the teacher left the room and didn't come back until after you both finished casting the spell. Now the teacher doesn't know which one of you finished casting it first, they just know that both of you cast polymorph. So the way it is resolved is that you both get polymorphed! 
---
In modern wow, the teacher checks on the room much more frequently, so the odds you both finish casting at a time when the teacher isn't checking is much less common. 
---
Am I a sinner for wanting auto-organize for my bags?
---
What's up man, I'm going Druid exactly for that- WPvP and fast, strong leveling that can compete vs players along the way.
---
Druids are full casters, so don't mistake yourself between a "healer" and a "caster" at it's truest sense. You're going to be in other forms 60+% of the time soaking damage in bear, mauling &amp; bashing, and dpsing in cat or spreading rakes.  But it's the instant roots, the HoTs, the thorns that all adds in together- not to mention *the* premier restore spell in *all* of classic. *Nothing* stands up next to innervate in it's own niche. Someone oom? Innervate. So own the caster aspects- embrace the strengths of the class, and use all of that. For me, that means 29/11/11. Insect Swarm boasts one of the top coefficients for spell power in all of Classic. Faerie Fire (Feral) is deceptively strong, debilitating Rogues especially. 
---
What really makes it hard is that attitude of yours
---
&gt; i should state that i do not want to heal
---
Then I advise against Druid. The whole reason why Druids are so much fun to play is that they can fill any role. They don't excell at any of those though. If you simply do not want to heal every you are kind of butchering the class and make it only half-fun in my personal opinion.
---
&gt; I've watched a few PvP videos (I'm assuming they're from private servers) and druid looks fun as hell. Tons of utility and mobility is right up my ally.
---
Then you should know that the people in those videos are running a heal spec most of the time. Similar or exactly equal to this one:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVxzoZVEcoxq0o.
---
It is the most surviable spec for PvP Druids which is your primary goal. This way a Druid can survive 1vX fights and outtduel pretty much anyone except for a full PvP Rogue with cooldowns up who is jumping you.
---
The alternative HotW build is also quite strong for PvP:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxgzscMdxVEc0Mo (or similar)
---
This is a hybrid between healing and tanking. Pure feral can be good too since it deals decent damage when opening on someone, but it is not as survivable as either of those PvP healing specs. Your primary strength as a Druid in PvP is survivability.
---
&gt; Also if i want to PvP, do i NEED to do raids for the gear or can i get gear from PvP?
---
No, Druids have it really good when it comes to PvP gear. They can aquire very good pieces that really fit their playstile with just PvP and dungeons and crafting.
---
&gt; Will i get into raids as a feral DPS?
---
A raid that is serious about their composition will raid with maybe 1 Feral who is mostly off-tanking and DPSing/healing when not. Strictly feral DPS is again not very competitive. Again, the beauty of the class comes from fexibility. Feral Druids who earn their spot in hardcore guilds are brought for that, not for just one job. In a casual guild things will be entirely different though. But if you ask for optimal this is your answer.
---
Also again, you focus seems to be PvP but you don't want to heal. Seems like Druid is not really for you to be honest. There are many fun classes in vanilla that might fit you way better. For example if you like tanking and dpsing then Warrior might be exactly what you are looking for.
---
Less fails on high level herbs is a cool benefit.  It also helps at those break points where it's hard to level up on current herbs but you can't quite get the new ones yet.
---
Overall I loved it on my druid for the entirety of my playtime.  Yes it's terrible from a min-max standpoint but I didn't mind that at all.
---
Warrior of all things. But I guess he didnt care since all loot was Tank prio first.
---
This article sums it up for you: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Cultivation
---
maybe makes it less likely to fail picking an herb?  I really don't know, probably just another thing that wasn't fully fleshed out.
---
Basing this on private server data!? Lmao.
---
There's the whole reduced picking time aspect.
---
I've been working on my route for a while now. I'm well aware of the bugs on private servers and you can work around them.  
---
Sometimes you have to suffer through 340p 12 year old videos on youtube, sometimes you have to spend hours digging through archived wowhead and thotbott pages on archive.org, but its still doable, if you're dedicated enough and you have the time. 
---
Yeah, on Classic everything will be different. Most Private Servers are easier/faster than Vanilla was.
---
you cant reduce it. all it takes is one person finding out and going to reddit.
---
Gotta admit i don't see what i my message warranted such awnser u_U
---
Anyway,
---
I remember reading southshore didn't really last past WG / AB / AV but might be mistaken, wasn't around back then.
---
People will allways look for the easy way, and they have enough knowledge to optimise their game time thus it will be different anyway.
---
And when it comes to lfg / lfr... Lfg changed a lot of things when it comes to the social aspect of the game right. But i don't think lfr changed anything, or at least changes anything currently. 
---
Those who do lfr either enjoy it for the content, are desesperate enough to tey to loot this sweet TF item someone photoshoped on reddit (true story here, there was such photo which caused outrage for no reason) or never ever planed to join Guilds or pugs to raid because they don't want to or just can't. 
---
It's  far too easy to spit on them because you judge them unworthy of ever seeing the last raid and these dirty peasents shall not be allowed to taint this holy land of greatness and dedication with their presence. 
---
Am i painting your opinion in a way that couldn't be father from the truth ? Sure, or at least i hope. What you did wasn't that different.
---
skills is really important to mention though as each rank has to be bought and that adds up really quickly when you are spending 6+ gold every two levels. from 40 to 60, that'd be 60g or 20% of your income. Throw in water/food and you're losing probably almost half of what you earned. Now throw in a lvl 40 mount, repairs, etc. You're broke.
---
I was 16 when the Game came out and I remember waking up at fucking 0900 and walked to the Store that opened at 1000 to buy the Game. I ran home as fast as I could and started playing, then the Servers went crazy and everyone got 20.000ms etc... but I powered through it. 
---
To me its more the convenience of having a steady stream of alts generating hundreds of gold weekly from me just logging in and pressing a button every few days.
---
His /played time is legitimate for that server.
---
I grant it's not apples for apples with vanilla for many reasons, however for that server he has the record, no question.
---
Mhm actually vanilla was never really figured out that well and private servers should be referred to with plenty of salt.
---
I remember it being next strike. The only instant hunter melee ability was wing clip iirc
---
Well for me I look at time as an investment in a product. If I play your game for 1000s if hours i am happier when rewarded for that in a less artificial way. In vanilla you know where the drop you want is you just have to invest time into getting it. Yes the gear in vanilla seems simple but it makes a huge impact on your character because hitting for 2k in pvp is half a Heath bar or more. In current wow you can know which dungeon or raid piece you want based on preferred stats for your class but if your using m+ to gear or raids to increase your Ilvl you may get the same piece 3 different times at various power levels. In vanilla you get pre raid set start raiding and spend your time getting loot at a dramatically slower pace than in live. The grind in vanilla is more in the world for resources to fund raiding. The raiding is setup in a tier system where you can’t skip ahead much. Your not raiding nax without having finished everything else first. 
---
The relevant section:
---
Your chance to gain a skill point while picking a herb is based on your base (without Cultivation) Herbalism skill, while the minimum skill required to pick a herb takes Cultivation into account. This means that a tauren player needs the same total Herbalism skill as other players to pick a particular herb, but will continue to gain skill from picking it longer than other players would. For example, if a herb normally requires 100 Herbalism skill to pick and gives skill up to 150 skill, a tauren player would need 100 skill (including Cultivation) to pick it and would continue to gain skill from picking it up to 165 skill.
---
Helpful for leveling and helps reduce failed gathers
---
Well if you want to join the other 70% of horde, go undead
---
Definitely. Moonwalking is so fun. 
---
&gt; The correct way to think of it is 72 straight hours of farming the pieces,
---
phew! I thought it was going to be impossible.
---
I remember playing a level 20 f2p character during Cataclysm. Discovered a site called twinkinfo.com where f2p characters were keeping track of their accomplishments.
---
So I decided to be the world-first f2p to get Exalted with Steamwheedle Cartel. That required me to kill about 18K level-32 goblins in STV, as a level-20. 
---
Now the "world first for a f2p" is just a silly thing, but the point is that I ground out 18K goblins over a week. I figured out a long time ago that I'm kind of an anomaly in this respect. 
---
By the time the AQ patch is out, I'm sure I'll be decked out in BWL, ready to roll up on some bugs.
---
Considering you never know when you mt is gonna bail, you should really be thinking your OT.  You will need loyal tanks for Naxx so look after them from the start.
---
It’s “on next attack”. 
---
Mongoose Bite and Wing Clip are instant but do a set amount of damage. 
---
No problem at all, the data is a bit outdated in terms of real speedlevelers now but as a target for regular players it’s completely achievable with good routes
---
So you think one shouldnt be worried that the OT bails himself because he has a ready TF other guilds will jump after?
---
Give it to the rogue, bro! ;)
---
I leveled both. Druids are faster levelers and you find/build dungeon groups faster since you can fill all roles. But Priests aren't even half as bad as some thing. You'll be doing a lot of wanding, which you can improve with the right spec. But you'll constantly be relatively high on health and mana, so you will have 0 downtime. It is a very steady leveling experience, since you never have to sit down, but you also don't kill stuff very fast.
---
As for later content they are both high skillcap healers for their own reasons, but mostly because they can both maximize the 5 second rule and scale well with Spirit unlike Shamans/Paladins who are more spammy.
---
Legend 
---
Aye sincerely hope they will never allow server changes in classic. It caused so much drama and wrecked so many realms and communities. It had good sides 2 I’m sure, but it just breaks the world feeling to me.
---
Why does this sub care about streamers so much? The only big WoW streamers who can affect server pop will be Soda and Asmon. Other big streamers like shroud, forsen or kripp will quit within 2 weeks. Everyone else is a sub 1k andy who you won't even notice on your server.
---
If you are stacking TF in a guild you are most likely one of the most serious on the realm, and you are unlikely to be losing tanks to guilds that are further in progression.  I honestly think you decide this with your officer core IF you are fortunate enough to be in this situation, EVER.
---
In Vanilla we alternated MT’s so they would not get bored/burned out. And we took care of them. They never paid repairs or for food or pots or anything. 
---
Good point, it's really a hunter weapon anyway. :)
---
Of course they could jump ship, but's its the best option you have.
---
tr*nny
---
You see it just seems things mattered more because there was less to pick from.
---
I think classic isn't a great experiment because ppl will play it for what it was, but i'd like to see a game follow this mindset (less rewards) and see how well player welcome it.
---
Diablo 3 and Anthem managed to raise player engagement and happiness by giving them more gear (was a bug at first for Anthem tho) and Anthem greatest criticism was the slow pace of rewards.
---
I wonder if such system could work on a mmorpg nowadays... 
---
No, I mean if you dont spend any gold on the AH and get by on the bare minimum of skills and buy a mount with rank and reputation discount, you should be looking at close to 300g upon hitting 60. The gold from quests and item drops really starts picking up after 45+.
---
Lol, thanks
---
Okay, this is epic.
---
Correct.  
---
However, this being the Classic WoW subreddit, one can assume that the OP is interested in leveling routs that can be replicated on Classic, rather than routes that abuse bugs on private servers.  
---
I also feel like its beneficial to mention that he used an exploit to get his time. Not because I have anything against him, but because people who are working on their own routes can get discouraged when they inevitably hear about the insane time that he got.
---
Thanks for all this information! Honestly i do not mind the builds you linked. As you say druids can survive 1vX fights and that's what i care about. I think the first one you linked is the one from the videos i have been watching. As long as i can kill people i'm good! Skill cap seems really high though so i got a lot to learn if i do decide to go druid. My main concern was the gear but you say that won't be a problem. Out of curiosity, how would that first build you linked do in general open world stuff? Like farming mobs for mats. Would i be able to kill mobs in a respectable time or will it be a drag? (I understand it won't be as good as a mage with good AoE).
---
My other choice would be Warlock as again they have a ton of utility and can easily fight 1v2. 
---
You assume armory will exist for Classic WoW. Armory wasn't a thing back then so it is likely they will not include it for Classic characters.
---
lol do you remember before TBC launch they made rank 14 gear purchasable by honor? was funny seeing everyone run around in rank 14 gear
---
Yeah certainly to a Warrior, especially OT. Your OTs are also your backups for MT and come Naxx you need as many well equiped *tanks* as you can get. Giving it to a Rogue or Hunter would be completely ridiculous. I hope that I will never end up with a Guild who would even consider that.
---
If it ends up being a one handed weapon, which it wasn't up until 1.12 (I think) then yes. Rogues take priority. Kappa

Might depend on the class, but the route I've made is quite a bit faster than any other option I've tested out on private server launches.
---
Next Swing, not instant.
---
Joanna salty that someone destroyed his time most likely..
---
Hey man I don't think you got the context... I used 'raid finders' just as a way to refer to retail players in general.
---
Joana's Guide is not outdated, considering the only people who beat his time are using Pservers. There are people who got under his time on servers with increased spawns, bugged xp values, bugged mob values etc.
---
Joana's guide is still THE fastest time ever recorded, and I wouldn't ever follow a PServer speed leveling guide (and I've played many pservers).
---
whenever I watch lord of the rings and they get to the elven city of Rivendell when they play the music I always think of teldrassil
---
&gt; DoT/wand/repeat
---
This is not my experience. Even if you want to simplify it like that, it’s Shield&gt;DoT&gt;Mind Flay&gt;Mind Flay&gt;Wand. Or, if you really want to spice it up, Shield&gt;DoT&gt;Vampiric Embrace&gt;DoT&gt;DoT&gt;DoT&gt;Mind Flay&gt;Psychic Scream&gt;Shield&gt;Mind Flay&gt;DoT&gt;DoT&gt;Wand. 
---
The point is, if you think playing a priest is mindless, maybe you weren’t doing enough to keep it interesting. 
---
Angry entitled nerds are the reason you're getting classic servers. Just saying.
---
Does bear form reduce magic damage also or only physical? I love the idea of constantly switching forms for different moments. Do you go OOM a lot with the constant form switching? I can imagine that if innervate is on CD then you could be in trouble, or am i wrong?
---
It probably does, as most things do when it comes to leveling. I'm definitely a stranger to paladins, as I rather kill myself than auto attack to 60.  
---
Don't let me discourage you from following your route though. If you've put thought into it, chances are that you'll be quicker than the majority, as most people will be running around without a clue.
---
Hi, /u/cptsmooth
---
Can I join your guild?  I need a good hearing aid supplier.
---
Yeah, might as well happen that we see the first binding when naxx is out lol.
---
But gotcha, priority to off tank.
---
Seems reasonable and wholesome. I like that.
---
Great Scoh!
---
Considering it will connected to your battle.net I think it's a safe assumption.  
---
IMO the accountability will help, as well as the older demographic who is more in it to enjoy it rather than "win" over all.
---
He has people in his discord that beat his newest 3 days 22 hours time rather convincingly and he's nothing but friendly towards them. So I doubt that, its possible though, who knows.
---
Level to 110 on a couple of different characters.  It'll be far far faster and easier than Classic but give you a good feel for the game.  Just don't expect it to be easy.
---
Indeed i though it was about lfr itself, my bad =\
---
Still, lfr in the current game has next to no impact on the community. The experience isn't that great and those who only do it either don't want to join a Guild or just don't have the time for raiding.
---
The same kind of players existed in vanilla and so will they in classic, and you not liking it does not warrant they shouldn't play either 
---
In actual dungeons, it certainly would of been. Hence why it was specified recently
---
^ this guy appears to believe words that are said by major corporations. Ah, to be young again. 
---
Druid is faster to level than Priest, but both are very efficient. Druid is arguably less boring, seeing as though you can tank/heal/dps dungeons, plus feral is pretty satisfying even just grinding mobs.
---
As for end game, Priest is the winner in my books for PvE. Better healer, more demand for your heals, more presence. Shadow is fun for wPvP too. IMO Druid is the least fun wPvP class, Jack of all Trades (Master at None). There are some videos of highly skilled Druid PvP fights and it seems super boring. Stacking Stam/Int and having to switch forms to do minimal damage and draw out super long fights against Hunters etc seems draining.

Where the fuck did you get the idea that Fury is an off spec? It’s top 2 DPS. 
---
Honestly it was fun. As a Rogue main with LW/Skinning gold never was a problem for me so I loved making sure our Tanks and Heals had all the expendable they needed.
---
Cataclysm was amazing...  until the more casual base got to cap and found out that they couldn't just faceroll everything.  The crying on the forums was epic, and Blizzard caved.  The nerf bat came down...
---
I didn't last too long as a regular sub after that. 
---
As for the killing nameless NPCs thing. In Vanilla, you're a grunt. A simple soldier. Killing random enemies harrassing a town or nearby encampment is exactly what you'd do.
---
In BfA you're a champion. A living legend. You've killed the Lich King, Old Gods etc. And now you're given the task to go kill 10 boars again? Seems odd.
---
In MC, the first 3 tanks are almost constant tanks or at least holding patterns.
---
* Lucifron, starts with 2 adds, needs to be tanked.
---
* Magma Packs - Requires 5 tanks.
---
* Magmadar - If you don't have Dwarf Priests, you need to roll tanks.
---
* Gehennas - starts with 2 adds, needs to be tanked.
---
* Garr - 10 adds.
---
* Barron Geddon - 2 tanks rolling, due to debuffs.
---
* Shazzrah - 2nd Tank waits for the jump to return him to Main Tank position.
---
* Sulfuron - 4 adds
---
* Golemagg - 2 adds, tanked throughout the fight
---
* Executus - 10 adds
---
* Ragnaros - Two tanks rotate so that at least one is always in range of the boss so he doesn't turn on rogues after the explosion bounce.
---
Essentially, everything you know about boss fights from Cata onwards... forget it.  The "off tank" is as busy as the main tank, the "off off tank" is often just as busy, and the 4th and 5th tanks are useful for boss fights but OT on trash and some bosses.
---
What you don't understand is that this is not how it works. Its not like Blizzard has the Releasedate somewhere locked in a Closet...
---
Its not like they have a 1000 Man Devteam working on Classic. They fucking don't know when the Game is ready to be released. They work on it and when the Beta/Stresstest drops they will figure out stuff thats they missed and fix it. Depening on how much stuff needs fixing, a Releasedate will be set. 
---
Affirmative.
---
&gt;People who are going to guild with Esfand JUST to make sure he sets Sulfras or Ashkandi, harming their own progression just so they can boost their favorite streamer.
---
Oh man if that actually happens it's really pathetic the lengths some ppl would travel just to get a shout out from their favorite streamer.
---
i dont think people understand how critical it is to have a rock solid main tank.
---
during actual vanilla our tank had a shitty pc but he made every raid and put a lot of time into the game. loosing a tank can really fuck your progression.
---
warrior will likley be a very popular class so i doubt many non warriors will get tf
---
I was a baller with my Powerade, cheese fries and 2 slices of pizza
---
Fairly sure I read somewhere on FAQ's that because the classic wow server will basically be using the current games infrastructure that we will be using/can use the current addons that are in the game now.
---
Also, if you're a Druid healer, you're useless without speccing healer.  If you're a bear, you have no mana depth or improvements.  
---
My overall advice, Warriors are Tanks, Druids are healers, unless you're in a "we don't care" guild.  In which case, your "optimisation" question would be pointless.
---
A solid guild will be structured around the MT and their needs.  Free repairs and enchants are usually the payment for someone doing the dirty work.  I tanked for a long time, many years, and I will never EVER do it again. Being a MT means upwards of 10hrs a week, possibly double that, online and doing your job.  I have no desire to have that responsibility again, I will wait for my epics like the dirty dps I am :D
---
you also sort of want to gear multiple off tanks over time , you never want to need to gear a tank from scratch
---
I also thank those of you who are insisting that this is done right. It's admirable to stand by principles, especially when being mocked, turned into a #hashtag, and when tempted by *well what if they just changed MY one thing*. 
---
So many things in the last decade have regressed into people being driven by marketing, virtue signalling, peer pressure, and most prominently deconstruction of that which game before. It seems like the majority are resigned to accepting the next shitty thing. This whole thing has been incredibly inspiring for me because it feels like a bunch of individuals who have come together in support of a *genuine* belief that something can be *good*. 
---
True.  Similar to Schrodinger's Sylvanas: when she's resting in the box unobserved, she's in a superposition between genocidal maniac and champion of the Horde.
---
Praying to god I pick a server that doesn't die after people burn out of leveling around level 20. Hoping blizz does server merges. Idk really, it's a total crap shoot. Honestly this is one of the biggest issues I think classic will have.  
---
Mom! More hot pockets!
---
yeah ive been thinking about being an off tank but id never consider main tank 
---
or if not off tank maybe a backup tank that way i get dps gear and the prot drops the tanks dont need so i can make a set over time.
---
i just need to actually try dps warrior ive never played it i prefer to tank
---
there will usualoy be a few oportunities for a a dps to switch to tank but ive never seen a tank switch to dps in a guild
---
Guess private servers really are a totally different world.
---
I took that to mean that our interests are truly aligned: but without necessary pressure painful compromises are inevitable.
---
Yay! I'm still a filthy casual.
---
This sick. Any plans for a Horde version?
---
Joana actually just posted a 3d 22h run on a repack
---
you don't know the half of it
---
almost every top guild on every server is full of [t-word]s and people that orbit them and funnel them gear
---
hehe cant remember that trip 15 years ago :P
---
Yeah ofc, I just feared that that an OT with TF would be more inclined to try to get a MT spot somewhere else; A position a Tank with TF ia clearly welcome in.
---
"even tipsout"... Okay, so he made a 10 min video about a 2 min bluepost. But you didn't have to lunge at him like that!
---
/s
---
Kargoz did a dual leveling Mage+Mage video during the demo. Check his YouTube. 
---
I think you are looking at games that try to emulate mmos without actually being mmos. The reason you need crazy loot drops like that is because they’ve made the gear so random you need it to rain on you to find that perfect piece. Where a true mmo they hand crafted the gear to specifically have stats that you’ll need but give you the freedom to say hey I need a resist set let me work on getting one crafted. Also those games your finished with leveling in 40h or less in wow classic your average player will spend 200ish hours getting to max. When you slow a game down like that people actually come to appreciate the world created. The struggle for improvement etc. in the games you listed you tend to do old content on higher difficulty looking for better rewards. In classic wow after fishing the journey to 60 you begin the journey to pre raid gear. Then you begin raiding and your not skipping tiers you need MC gear to do BWL. You need BWL gear to do AQ etc. items could even become iconic in classic wow things like paladins T2 judgement set always made me envious. Out of looter shooters I can only name 1 iconic item. In modern wow I can’t name a single set of armour or weapon as iconic. 
---
Define: "Lag" (fall behind in movement, progress, or development; not keep pace with another or others.)
---
Actually this is the definition... =P
---
Also, "server tick" is more of what you're talking about. The comment "The game is much more responsive than it used to be" is in reference to the batching loops utilized to process more in less time.
---
It doesn't mean that the game wasn't able to process what it did get, and in fact, many people seem to believe the game actually handled large groups (40+) of players in a single zone in vanilla than it does now.
---
That means that while the game is more responsive now, it is actually more "laggy" now - this is what I am referring to, and one reason why spell batching in a more "classic" manner means a smoother experience...
---
Hope that helps (aside from the sarcasm) xD
---
That's what forums are for.
---
While I agree with a lot of this (cheaper AV mounts being around 600g and they were extremely popular as a result in actual vanilla), where did you get the source for the AV mounts being put in at patch 1.11? The wikis say the mounts were present in patch 1.5, when AV was first released.
---
Not sure I agree. The UD and Worgen stories and starting zones for Cataclysm are significantly better than the DK zone (though I would place that one 3rd).
---
I’m gonna probably pass if there’s an official reddit realm. To many 1% players trying to cut in on my business simulator known as the AH. 
---
I'm fully aware of that - and I will accept that sort of harassment in exchange for a more civil environment and otherwise far more pleasant in-game experience.
---
These "lockouts" you are afraid of, tend to only last 10-15 minutes anyway, until reviewed by a GM. And people who report others without cause may be subject to suspension or ban themselves, which further draws my support.
---
It brings consequences for a lack of civility. Without it, we all sink to a level none of us really enjoy for long...
---
That was a great post!
---
I too mained a druid in vanilla. And I will be maining a druid in classic.
---
Folks who think a druid is a gimped warrior, rogue, or priest are, in a sense, right. If you want to do one thing, and do it best, don't pick a druid.
---
The power of the druid (and the _fun_) is in being the right one at the right time, adapting yourself from moment to moment. This is best experienced in pvp.
---
[https://youtu.be/cJMwBwFj5nQ](Bruce Lee on how to be a druid.)
---
If you think about it, it's down to 6 things :
---
\- The world felt bigger : no flying mounts, no portals everywhere , no summoning stones, etc.
---
\- Class identity existed : not every class had everything just named differently and niche spells that had very specific uses still existed.
---
\- hybrid tax and the utility role : the unspoken 4th role which was "support" often mistaken for CC or healing , but was actually it's own thing.
---
\- Gold mattered: resources were scarce and people had to work for it, these days no one farms  shit anymore and some are just running around with millions cause there really isn't anything to spend much on besides a few vanity items.
---
\- The world was dangerous: all mobs/creatures hit 4-5 times harder than they do in retail wow, no scaling was there either so getting gear upgrades were felt.
---
\- And finally the most important thing, the community: if you add all of the above + the fact there were no catch up mechanics ( barely ) , no LFG/ LFR and the difficulty  of completing the most mundane things FORCED you to seek help , the rest is obvious.
---
At low skill levels, spell batching will come off as wonky game mechanics to players. At higher skill levels, it becomes a mechanic to predict your opponents and abuse. A good example would be an exceptional rogue opening up on a mage. The rogue knows the mage wants to blink and gain some distance, and he needs to keep him shut down as best they can. So this rogue will anticipate exactly when the mage will press their blink key, and at the same moment use his gouge. The result is the mage 20 yards away, blink now on cooldown, sitting in a 4 second incapacitate, allowing the rogue to close the distance once again. There are many “outplays” that exist and takes pvp to a whole new level. You can’t really understand or know how it feels until you practice and begin to pull off these slick moves yourself...and you will find it deeply satisfying
---
I played lots of druid in vanilla. Tried the bear tank and cat DPS thing but it was always forced and always second to a decent warrior or ANY damage class.
---
The cold hard truth is that you need to be restoration to be effective in any PVE raids. I was angry when I came to that conclusion too, but it's better to accept it for what it is and not force something. A square peg doesn't fit into a round hole, it just won't work.
---
In PVP, feral and hybrid specs are definitely viable and as previously stated; druids are the best flag runners by far.
---
Dudes triggered, sounds like he’s passive aggressively telling you to kill yourself lmao 
---
look at you.. Mr FancyPants with vacation
---
Glad I wasnt the only one! 
---
Hey man I have a friend like this but I like what I like. This friend currently isn’t playing any version of wow so fuckem. 
---
July 16th people
---
Are you really thanking the #nochanges people for being super adamant that there are absolutely no changes while also requesting changes? 
---
You do you, boo
---
Motherfucker, you had TWO slices?!
---
Oi. And I was bound to my $2 Free Lunch. Fortunately my friends would always give me a few cents for milk. Another kid spent like $10 on lunch. 
---
&gt; Yet, they made a clear indication "phases 2-6"?
---
Because it's obvious that phase 1 exact release is when the game comes out. 
---
&gt; So, they know when are they releasing phase 1?
---
Yes, when the game is released... 
---
&gt; Would it make sense to "release phase 1 0 days after release"? 
---
Obviously saying that is redundant, as it's perfectly clear to everyone but you that phase 1 is the initial release. 
---
What they don't know is exactly how long after the release of phase 1 they want to start releasing the other phases....it's really not that difficult to understand. 
---
that would actually be a less crashy way to go about things. Smarter? no, they need to build up the HYPE
---
This is hilarious. 
---
I don't think that exists in vanilla.
---
I'd like to think I'm a high-skilled player (or at least I was in Vanilla/TBC) and really excelled with the complexity available as a druid once TBC came along.  But my fear is that in pure-Vanilla, a lot of the multi-spec utility goes away for a druid. I thoroughly enjoy being a healer, so I don't mind losing the variety necessarily, but my recollection of Vanilla for druids was a bunch of big heal, cancel because someone flash healed, innervate, big heal, cancel cause someone flash healed.
---
Ultimately my biggest source of confusion was I loved priest'ing so much in a competitive Vanilla raid environment, and then loved druid'ing in a more casual TBC setting (and perhaps a little more than my priest even).  But I can't tell what the druid looks like in an apples-to-apples setting for Classic.
---
To be clear, I'm definitely a long haul person, for what that's worth. Ugh, serious real world dilemmas..
---
even given enough time, most of the expansions are horrible.  Blizzard lost sight of the core values in WoW.
---
My impression of Blizzard, is that they always give a release date when they KNOW they can keep it.
---
Be patient. If they just gave a release date out based on the fans whinging instead of their own impression there would be two ways this plays out:
---
1. The game isn't ready in time. They either release a buggy product which ruins your holidays, or the product is delayed, which also ruins your holidays.
---
2. They give out a release date with time to spare. The product is finished &amp; sitting there for a while before the release date. If they had chosen the release date without listening to the fans then you would have gotten it earlier.
---
I understand the fanbase yelling about loot trading. It's something that letting our voices be heard can make a difference on. The option wasn't set in stone either way.
---
Getting a release however is set in stone, even if the date isn't. There's no need to yell, it will get here. If they listen to yelling then it will just be bad for us.
---
If you want to do something, look at Blizzards previous release dates &amp; base yourself around that. I highly doubt there are many people that can't plan holidays with 2 months notice (Blizz's minimum that I've seen).
---
Damn what was the comment?
---
Kinda looks like beans from even stevens, man do I miss those days  of playing wow without a care in the world :')
---
Agree. Theres VERY little to gain and a FUCKTON to lose considering the outcries and rage Blizzard has had towards them lately. They want every positive thread they can get on social media.
---
OP I hate to say this... Listen to shitty advice guy.
---
the Devs already have an internal launch date. will everyone just shhhhhhh please
---
Something about “nice nipple can I see more” or some shit like that 
---
Personally even after the removal of hybrid tax through world most classes retained their identity. Also the class designer on the podcast has said he regrets the hybrid tax because it did make so many specs bad. With that said I still preferred dungeons when you had to use CC and group coordination so before WoTLk aoe dungeon fest became wide spread. 
---
Do you guys think Joanna will win the race to 60 when Classic drops? His WR rn is crazy and he still thinks he will shave more time. 
---
I was in my junior year of highschool. I remember Jessa Harper gave me mono the week WoW released. Best sick week I’ve ever had...
---
Warr+Pal is probably the best duo in the game. But honestly, you should pick the class you’re more interested in — it’ll be fun either way.
---
It's negligible. Min/Maxing won't give you much of an improvement. Honestly the +5 axes is the biggest increase, but finding 1h axes is sorta tough in raids.  
---
Don't worry too much about "the best" imo, and don't forget about some other quality points this guy brings up: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8xfs65/best\_race\_for\_horde\_classic\_warrior/e24d7a6?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8xfs65/best_race_for_horde_classic_warrior/e24d7a6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I also agree with you. 
---
I mean you'll kill mobs in a reasonable time if you put on feral gear with this build.
---
Warlock is a cool class too.
---
I just listed those two games because it seems wow took a really similar game system than Diablo 3 &amp; it seems Anthem shares the same flaws at launch than Diablo 3 did, although i didn't play either.
---
It seemed fitting since games are failing because of one of the concepts vanilla was build upon, and one of them was released last month. It looks like the current player base accros all games would rather have fast rewards than slow ones. 
---
Once again it's a trend about complains on another game so it does not target vanilla, but i though it was an interesting concept.
---
And about the items i really tend to think it's more about quantity and quality than anything. Judgement is most likely one of the best set blizzard ever made and imo the best paly set. 
---
There's still sets in game, but you have about 3 of them per patch now, rather than 1. You also tend to replace them faster which makes then less impactful.
---
Differents items share visuals now, but with recolor which makes an item skin less unique too.
---
Unique items are easier to remind tho, like quel'delar, quel'serar or in retail the proudmoore sabre which drops from jaina. Also dunno if that counts but i still remember the dread Gladiator Gear i had early bfa :p
---
Wth. That explains why it got removed. Thanks for the reply!
---
That’s the point, it’s a good time but nowhere near best possible.
---
Minus your threat gen and lack of taunt. Port Paly wont MT past MC and that's if your guild let's you. OT trash tank is the life for you in raids 
---
He right
---
Like I said, I didn't find priest to be mindless in my experience and actually have the opposite concern from an endgame perspective (i.e., I think priest healing is far more engaging than druid healing would be in a raid environment).  I'm talking solely about the leveling process where the most efficient leveling structure for a priest seems like a bit more of a mindless, albeit efficient, grind to 60.
---
You didn't find leveling 1-60 (which I mentioned I never did as a priest for the unique reason) to be a bit on the boring side?
---
Is it tho?
---
I dont get it either.
---
More exploity tricks in pvp = higher skill?
---
I get keeping the game exactly as it is to make classic "authentic". But i was looking forward to these modern server changes so that it does feel less clunky and broken at times. 
---
I guess it's an unpopular opinion. 
---
You're right but you can off heal just fine and or apply night fall better than warriors.
---
Ad hominem in 2019 lol, retard. 
---
Shit, I fucking hope not. There might be a million people ready to play the first week...6 servers would be a nightmare. Join queue Monday, create your character Friday night
---
At the end of the day I think it’s a better system and I like the loot staying rare. Something like 30-40% of the raid could get drops on a good run, when everyone needs stuff from the instance and no junk drops. It’s just when you’re in that other group for too long, it can be quite frustrating any time you miss a chance, so I see how I think you need to take the bad feeling to make it that much better when you do get something.
---
I'm sorry, is there no venting allowed in this venting post? 
---
It wasn't perfect for sure, but neither was the direction wow went in and evolved into.
---
Some things are good, others are bad but the we're all here because we vanilla has something that BFA doesn't , and it's not nostalgia.
---
Yes , always loved the support role so I wanted to think tank my protection pali :)
---
Why are you making me redesign my whole written down layout I took hours designing?
---
If you don’t want to get stranded by yourself, don’t role on a separate server from your friends. Even if you’re nervous about pvp, you’ll have your friends to watch your back. Also, there isn’t going to be a tier two hunter camping your quests in the first week...only gonna have to worry about people your level
---
I just don't believe this is going to translate to Classic. When the best time for speed leveling in classic was 4 days and 20 hours, or something like that, doing it in 3 days and 9 hours means the private server had some generous experience gains that you won't find in classic. Meaning you'll be far short of where you're supposed to be and need to grind to catch up often.
---
So yeah, revising is great, but you're missing at least a day's worth of /played time in this.
---
This basically sums up my opinions exactly.  So the question is a matter of comparison and whether the fact that the "druid is arguably less boring" for 200+ hours of leveling outweighs the priest endgame superiority in a context where I can't play as much (and isn't just, leveling is just an annoying pre-requisite to start really playing WoW)...
---
That's a fair point about being Classic wow subreddit
---
Pserver runs are not reflective of what we expect the experience to be on Classic when it comes out, because pservers don't match vanilla any more than a 'close enough'.
---
Hopefully people aren't being discouraged, because running to 60 should be about doing your best time, not necessarily being better than everyone on the server.
---
You mean after I (the rogue guild lead) got TF the main tank can ofc have it. 
---
I hate to be a downer but prot pallies are kinda a joke in classic, you'd be much better utilised as holy.
---
There's way more issues than just the defense cap. mana, sketchy threat, no taunt, no cooldowns ect.
---
Agreed. It just means non-orcs will have to work a bit harder to match their DPS. Maladath, Cote Leather Gloves or other items with +weapon skill. Because of the easy access to +daggers, Daggers are actually Fury BiS in AQ40 and Naxx (sorry rogues).
---
Fellow 28 year old who played vanilla. Can confirm
---
Yeah man i think you are right. I am in the same boat, its hard to find a few hours in a row of dedicated WoW time without any interruptions. As you well know, sometimes its hard when the game you are playing requires you to be actively loged in haha. I still enjoy my time that i get to play though, and I think thats why i enjoy leveling so much. Anyway I can relate.
---
They are not main tanks just support tanks I know what I am getting into.
---
Yeah, it really helps to increase camera distance, but I have done it many times, just gotta hamstring mob number 2 and run away. 
---
Didn't use that but I do remember Stardock
---
Support tanks? What do you plan on actually tanking?
---
newbie
---
&gt; Varrak is a god and plays hunter so expect double the play time for mere mortals.
---
Varrak plays on a private server with fucked experience gains from quests, so he didn't have to grind and could skip basically anything he wanted while staying in the zones he liked. 
---
1 RP PvE server and 1 RPPvP server isn't that much. Add more as demand is needed.
---
Also helps if you use Thunderclap. 
---
Also, I know some folks who swear the Edgemaster's Handgaurds are BiS for any DPS warrior through everything up to, and in some cases, beyond Naxx...
---
What the hell is up with people downvoting this...
---
Trash
---
yeah idk what this guy is talking about with "moonstrafing" being a thing in pvp. nobody else can see you do it. unless i am completely remembering vanilla wrong
---
I imagine his route would be a lot less impressive if he had to grind for about 15-20 hours along the way to 60 to make up for the experience he wouldn't be getting for quest turn-ins. Would be interesting to see how he adjusts if he tries on a more accurate server.
---
They heal and could tank what about it can't you understand 
---
Any discords I can join? Classic would be so much more fun with a group
---
Erm, I think people would prefer to pick by region, time zone, and realm type - I don't have any desire to choose the same realm as everyone else on this sub. 
---
I’m leveling a Warrior on Pserver right now, using hamstring method, Arms spec, and Spirit gear, and I’m really enjoying it. It’s not mandatory, but I never have to buy more than 5 food at a time, and bandage every 3-5 kills. I’d say it increases my kills per hour by 25? 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdNFdBB3GfA&amp;t=643s
---
Already watched it.
---
Pics or this is all just bullshit.
---
Vanilla was an all-out casual game for the masses. It is surprising to me that people forgot this. The only reason it may appear otherwise is the comparison to retail WoW and mobile games.
---
It is a game that is inherently easy to understand and play. The mechanical requirement especially is really low and the internal economy is very simplified compared to hardcore MMOs.
---
The magic about the game is that it brings many people together and puts them into this weird, huge fantasy simulation. Noone ever accomplished this on the same scale in the western market.
---
Get dial up for the complete immersion 
---
Where do I get this now?
---
I mean, that comparison isn't really fair because neither of those weapons really matter much for progression anyways. I don't care for esfand at all and I dislike the other two losers even more but this is hardly an egregious example. 
---
Your post tells a different story
---
Maybe you can get a dial-up connection somewhere too! Then you could lag to hell on everything!!
---
Lol thanks for that man. 
---
So your plan is to be a "tank" that never actually tanks a boss because you'll never generate enough threat to take aggro and heals worse than all the healers.
---
As I said you'd be better utilised just playing holy as that's the role you'd end up filling anyway.
---
How so? He doesn't even play let alone want to play protection paladin and he even says protection paladins are gimped with itemization and no taunt and can't be main tanks for some boss fights. I understand that and where he is coming from, but protection paladins can be great off tanks and heals.
---
Idk netting a mage after a blink is imo the best feeling as a warrior. 
---
Considering you can't play as much, Druid isn't the worst choice for healing end game. Not sure if you plan to raid at all, but there's less competition for gear, and guilds won't bring many druids anyway. 2 Druids seems to be enough, and all that Leather with spirit/int is easier to get your hands on.
---
Leveling &amp; grinding end game would be fun as feral. You can tank and heal dungeons.

Biggest reason I'm not rolling druid is the wPvP. But you do get the bonus of being a great flag carrier in WSG too.
---
I’m kinda confused about the rotation for prot warrior... currently 24 and going fury but I’m still tanking dungeons occasionally and I know I’m doing the rotation all wrong. Can someone give me the basics of what I should be doing?
---
Not only this, but you're also able to compete for tiny amounts of acknowledgement by giving someone money. It helps people with zero friends delude themselves into thinking they're part of a "community". 
---
but you bring X healers because you need X healers - not because you need Y + 1 off healer.
---
And nightfall is for hunters / wing clip ---- warriors spamming hamstring. Both have better uptime than a semi-prot warrior
---
Slow farming may be a drawback but I think they are pretty dynamic pvp healers.  This is one of my favorite vanilla pvp vids that led me to main a druid for awhile. https:/.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYG8Rp8hNjEM&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1r7H626jhAhVJF6wKHbLwAnYQwqsBMAB6BAgGEAU&amp;usg=AOvVaw0mRU1sZnQsTjJMJ5H7j_rW
---
FWIW, I think tBC's druid pvp heal spec is the one of WoW's best specs of all time (should there ever be a classic tbc server)
---
I’m not a fan of all the gear resets. If I spend 1000 hours to get BiS piece I’d like to use it a while. 
---
It shouldn't be MH only as it's using the 1.12 data
---
I am not a min maxer like you and don't plan on being in a guild that does that anyways. I'd rather have fun than have to be forced into something I don't want to play.
---
send me some cash and I'll acknowledge you for 6 seconds and make you feel like you have friends 
---
Been trying to find out if it's possible, this was via a program called MyColors (stardock) but I can't really find something
---
nope
---
Every early-mid 2000's WoW player knows this feeling. Damn, I remember playing WoW on my friend's crappy computer when they were having a LAN party. (He was at work that night but kept his computer there)
---
The rest were raiding and I was busy not spending talent points (didn't know) and getting lost and dying to "high level" mobs in Teldrassil on a hunter I made on the working friend's account.
---
I got hooked that night, graduated highschool, worked my ass off a month and got a workable computer to run WoW. Been hooked ever since.
---
Actually it might not, I've never leveled a vanilla Tauren.
---
Wrong, seal of righteousness acts like a basic attack in theory you have better up time than warriors and hunters. Also about healers sure there are x healers but there are x tanks. It's better to have an extra healer than a prot warrior.
---
Yeah I don’t get it either honestly. I can appreciate a video like reckful dominating arenas or the world of rogue craft videos. But just watching some guy randomly playing a video game in real time is not interesting. To each their own though
---
'Cause so few people understand druids. my dude.  I can't wait to go back to a vanilla druiding -- and this is post revamp.  The biggest hurdle before us is convincing people we're basically viable.  We're not perfect, but we're not what we launched as, and that stigma never left us during vanilla.
---
I was feral all through Vanilla, had all my gear sets, never raided because nobody thought that we were worth bringing anywhere.  I hope I find a casual guild who lets me play with 'em.  Guess we'll see!
---
Sum baer is for fite!  (#)
---
Troll furywarrior is actually top-end, and is the #1 horde warrior by Naxx.
---
"Increases Melee Attack Power by 30, Armor Contribution from items by 180%, and health by 20. Protects from Polymorph. 
---
Bearform is 55% of base mana, luckily druids do have natural Int progression, so it's about 30% manapool at 10-12. You can easily regenerate this versus 2-3 mobs, the average fight length you want to stay in bear form before popping out and healing. 40-60 seconds is easily 300+ mana for druids "out of combat" aka "haven't cast a spell in 5 seconds." 
---
Innervate is not mandatory at all for Feral Druids. It's icing on the cake, an emergency button when you pulled 3 then another 2 and need to AoE stun + heal to full, and do it all over again. Innervate is best used on a Duo partner (mage, warlock, priest, paladin, anybody really). 
---
It's very, very intuitive to pick up the pacing of swapping forms. Some fights you'll want to just caster blast them (see ranged casters in a dense zone - you can't go in to melee these sometimes).
---
There's a difference between being a minmaxxer and being completely worthless to the raid, you would essentially be playing a healer with less healing talents and wearing bad gear.
---
You would never tank anything except maybe some random trash mobs, which could already be done by your existing raid tanks.
---
It's like a hunter putting on aspect of the monkey and only meleeing saying they are a tank.
---
They reverted loot handling?!
---
Private servers have accelerated XP so ignore any "records" on those 
---
But can you actually damage a warlock in that gear?  I feel like the duel would be more tedious than holy pally v holy pally. 
---
I do plan on carrying shadow resist gear for messing around with stuff like this, but 300 seems overkill. 
---
Don't you think though that the play time (or lack thereof) cuts the other way for raiding?  As in each guild will, as you say, carry 1-2 main druids for raiding and those slots will belong to fully-geared timesink folks.  Whereas, if the raid needs a "healer" to come along and if you have to take a non-BiS healer, the priest gets the nod...
---
Also, by the time I played resto druid at cap, we had an OOC rez so I really can't identify with how much of a hindrance to finding 5-mans that was (which based on my research seems like it was a pretty big issue \[though I always discount the negative-nancy internet\])
---
I do have faint memories. 
---
Couldn’t warlocks use their pets / fire spells and priests switch to smiting you?
---
Your shadow resist gear would gimp your other stats quite a bit.
---
Hell, they could just wand you down...
---
Will I have to roll human to raid?
---
I’d rather go with a dwarf or gnome.
---
It's better to have a tank that can swap to healing gear than have more than enough tanks. And your healing is not gimped at all just put on a healing set. Sure you miss some talents but again why have an extra prot warrior v an extra healer.
---
Check out windows blinds 
---
I remember I once was having a dream about a house party of sorts. 
---
When all of a sudden this dude walks in with full tier 4 pally gear and a big old hammer.
---
In the dream I remember me and my friend commenting that that's a dope ass ret pally, and the party continued like nothing happend. 
---
Luckily he didn't gank anyone. 
---
Classic wowl
---
Good luck bud
---
That's one way of looking at it.  
---
I think of it more like supporting someone's dream. Getting some laughs out of what they do. Chatting with people with similiar interests, occasionally. Albeit, I'm pretty inactive in any discords of the guys I'm subbed to. I do it more because I'd rather my $25.00/mo go to actual people instead of a cable company.
---
I work from home for a living. So I have a stream going on in the background on one of my monitors most of the day. I get more entertainment out of that then I do watching a south park rerun for the umpteenth time.  
---
no wbuffs in raids would alright
---
Nightfall has 3.5 weapon speed. With SoR, that's 34 opportunities to proc per minute.
---
Wing clip has 1.5 sec CD. Nightfall will hit 17 times, wing clip will hit 40 times. That's 57 chances to proc per minute.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but 57 is more than 34.
---
No changes

---
there is less jumping around like that 
---
like there is 40 people inna raid and at least a few spares and some type of dkp system.
---
if you are getting gear chances are you want to stay in the guild.
---
any better guild should have good tanks. 
---
tf is great and all but i think when i started playing vanilla it had already been replaced by other stuff for tanks.
---
stuff like tf will prob come down to an officer decision, they will likley pick someone they know wont bail , you also need both bindings so that will take a while.
---
like if you are an ot and the guild would give you a binding you are prob one of the top players in that guild i guess he could take his chances with another good but most people seem to stay with a guild that can keep shit together.
---
the more likley big deal would be other warriors quitting the guild when they dont get a binding.
---
vanilla has a lot of loot drama because there is just so many people in a raid and so little gear drops. every time 1 person gets anything 5 other people get pissed off. 
---
you just sort of have to think of it like a queue , every item has a queue you can get what you want but its going to take a while.
---
lol i remember letting them de shit that was upgrades for me because u wanted to bud on weapons
---
Right but...you're not a tank, at any point, you're just a scuffed healer, you wouldn't ever have aggro on any boss so what is the point of being prot spec? You gain nothing of value from prot talents as you aren't being hit to proc the effects.
---
I will reiterate, you are better off just playing holy as that is all you would be doing *anyway*.
---
Think small town vs big city. 
---
Small town is always tight knit community, people are more social small talk is common.
---
Big city, why the fuck is that guy looking at me? I just want my burrito so I can go home and play WoW.
---
James Whitmore was a great actor and a bad ass. When WW2 broke out he enlisted in the marines and served in the South Pacific. Also went to Yale and helped start the radio station there. Then went on to act on Broadway and have a 60 year career with in tv and film.
---
wouldn't the other system, 1000g riding, be better for inflation? I feel like warlocks and pallys paying more for riding and everyone buying more mounts since they're cheaper would take more gold out.
---
Because your post tells the story of you main tanking, not being sometimes useful in niche ways.  
---

So yeah, level 56 was slowest and that was because I did the Furblog grind NE in Felwood to become friendly with the Timbermaw, but that slowed me down somewhat.  Next time I will do what I did in the past and just go through the cave instead.  I explained this stuff more in detail on the Twitch video I made yesterday.
---
Is this going to be posted every day until classic launches?
---
Yes, but the damage of their fire spells/smiting will be drastically less because most will be wearing +shadow damage items. Not to mention running oom will be their biggest issue facing someone with that much shadow resistance 
---
I downloaded 1.12 client for a private server.  Then I saw a full vanilla server's worth of characters hanging out in Orgrimmar.  Uninstalled.  Even vanilla isn't vanilla anymore.  Let's hope Blizzard does it better.
---
As a druid yes, even in full resto gear and talented resto cat does decent damage. When it comes to other classes it might not be as useful, or you may need to pick and choose some items.
---
Well everyone gets it once right? So thats 1000g out of the economy for every player. With 100g cost a person would have to buy 10 different mounts to spend another 1000g. That means getting almost all the epicmounts from each faction. Not a lot of people are going to do this for various reasons (one is they would take up 10 bagslots)
---
On the other hand, if even one person buys an extra mount, thats 1000g out of the economy right there.
---
Can WoW be added to your steam library? (Steam lets you add outside games to its library that are on your pc)
---
If so steam link might be a janky thing to test out. 
---
Epic animal reaction pics mate
---
Those long SM runs, from start to finish.
---
Good times.
---
A lot of this is because theorycrafters will base their DPS on static targets, or forget to adjust calculations for boss resistances, movements, damage avoidance, etc.  
---
A lot of "min/maxxers" will blithely fail to acknowledge that their "perfect spec" is not really optimal for a variety of reasons.  
---
I still remember being told in Wrath "if you play an endgame mage then you have to go fire for max DPS on most fights once you have your 4 set gear bonus, because you'll be wasting stats..." blah blah blah - it was nonsense.  
---
I could outdps ANY fire mage on my server on any given boss encounter, and most mob clears as well, while using that "boring" arcane spec - because I did it my way, and my way resulted in non-stop 20-60k crits every gcd, with instant-cast arcane missles critting at 50k (x4) every 3-5 seconds. And no, I didn't go oom, I didn't die, I didn't take aggro (ok that's a lie) and it was FUN. Because I WRECKED my rotation, planned out movements well in advance, so I routinely took less damage than anyone else, and routinely outdps'd everyone else.  
---
If you buy into what all the min/max nerds say, you will nerf yourself. It's why 90% of them are only moderately successful anyway. One of the best pallies I ever played with would frustrate top guilds because of his playstyle, using every. single. possible. spell/rank/manuever you have ever seen used by any paladin in any raid or pvp setting ever imagined. I'm not joking - the guy is lowkey the best pally player literally to ever play the game, and he doesn't even talk about it (no joke, he should be a damn streamer - the guy would make legit money, but he hates the idea of all the unnecessary attention). And all those theory-crafters? Well, they all get mad because he does things they don't expect, and even though it makes their raid smoother and easier, they don't like it, and he gets yelled at (like one of many times when the raid leader called for a wipe at 5% boss health, and he and the remaining 3 players killed the boss anyway - but then he got kicked from the raid for not following instructions).  
---
It's nonsense like that, that makes me enjoy reading what a theory-crafter has to say, and then mindful not to change my playstyle entirely to match what they are doing solely because they "mathed it out" on a stick dummy in IF while using some random mod they downloaded from a site, made by a guy who never read the source-code of the game anyway...
---
Are + shadow damage items really much of a thing? I know there's some decent crafted blue gear but once you get into proper raid gear from what I remember it's all +dmg. Pretty sure the warlock in the clip in T3 would just completely wreck you with immolate and searing pain if they wanted to.
---
OP if you want to tank (as an offtank) you are more then welcome to join our guild. You sound like you will try your best to make it work and we just want friendly players.
---
We would be raiding 2 nights a week and we are definitely not a hardcore guild, our goal is to eventually clear BWL. Anything more is bonus.
---
It’s still a bit early but prot pallys bring buffs and people don’t understand that if you build up aggro as a prot, you aren’t getting a mob taken off you.
---
Send me a message!
---
title. The Golden Age of gaming.
---
So long as he doesn't let it be known what server he's playing on. Only because he's likely to get stream-sniped and other players will tag everything around him to intentionally slow his progress (at least at the beginning until he gets ahead of the pack).  
---
&gt;you need to pvp in order to play feral in pve
---
I would not really say this. I am tanking AQ40 on my Druid just fine without any pvp gear.
---
Later into the game not as much. but up until AQ40 yes. many items from BWL MC are +shadow damage - or locks are still using crafted items or world drops with shadow damage.
---
I'm sorry that hard encounters aren't considered epic. Maybe one-shooting a boss with ez and getting phat lewt with no effort is more up your alley?
---
the fastest way to level up is by not playing   
---
  
---
(Rested EXP)
---
To my night warriors. (Night elf)
---
How much of a game changer is shadowmeld in the leveling process and open world.
---
Really thinking of going with night elf for the shadowmeld capabilities over human or orc.
---
Hell yea brother, cheers from Iraq! 
---
If you are a class with high burst potential it is better to utilize your high AP or high spell damage then to forfeit damage for resistance. As a druid/shaman/pally you win many fights via attrition and slowly wasting enemies cd's mana/hp pools. So resistance stacking is very strong on those classes. At least in my opinion! :)
---
Server ticks were lower freq because they were attempting to alleviate the disparity between clients with different pings/processors.  No one wanted to play an mmo where some guy who shells out 3k for alienware and 100 bucks a month for cable buys GM.  
---
My precious 
---
think you have that swapped. It was my understanding that it was the off-hand hit penalty that made the racials more worth it
---
I suspect 30+ is more likely, but yea, I imagine it’ll be a better community than retail obviously.
---
I don't remember if this is how it actually was in classic or just a pserver thing but I hate that to inspect another players gear I have to be like 2 feet from them and stops working if they r move away at all. The RPGr in me loves it, but the rest of me who loves viewing other people's gear HATES IT. 
---
Wow, there were actually ally players on Gul'dan that late in BC? I am amazed.
---
The only Horde I would have remembered though were Fifo Ungad and Fireace, had a good many fights with them in WSG.
---
Wouldn't it be more immersive since y'know, in real life peoples hair grows and people get haircuts? 
---
I think you may be right in more serious or hard core guilds. In less serious guilds I don't think it's going to matter too much. Pugs will probably take any healer, especially for earlier content. If a Druid does leave a guild and they need a replacement, there will likely be less of them to recruit in general compared to a Priest.
---
No OOC rez isn't that bad. It's annoying if everybody has to run back, but it's not the end of the world.
---
I'm struggling myself to pick my main!
---
How does the DPS compare thou to a normal 1H fury spec? Does 2H fury compete closely with it? 
---
just to remind you two /u/Tardigrade89 and /u/BegaKing
---
Athene got a 2 month bann at the launch of BC for the listed paladin lvl exploit in BC
---
During patch 2.0.10 the ToS and EULA were changed because of it
---
Athene got himself and multiple helpers banned during the launch of wotlk for the 'you 4 go bring mobs to me, I drop one aoe into them - then you finish them for me' abuse. Again forcing blizzard into action with ToS and EULA updates 
---
He found ways to get banned for 1 week and reset back to 90 when he was 24% away from hitting world first lvl 100.
---
bottom line is. As 'creative' as you may want to call the guy. He didn't learn his lesson and blizzard has never played nice with those exploits either
---
This is just wrong. Feral Druids have the largest mana pool in the game thanks to Heart of the Wild. 0/30/21 is a very popular spec for both tanking and healing for that reason.
---
You can heal anything as long as you have Improved Healing Touch, Nature's Swiftness, and Tranquil Spirit. You just need a separate set of gear.
---
This NEVER made sense to me. The logical choice after that is to have a second bid run.
---
Anyone who wants the item rolls and trades the d/e'd gem mats to the guild officer for the item itself.
---
Everyone wins, same system as ususal, people get their mats, no point in rolling to d/e for cash if you already have to pay the mats, people can collect items if they want, ez peazy.
---
In no logical situation should people d/e an item someone can use.
---
MT&gt;OT&gt;Fury&gt;Rogue IMO.
---
I know right! I have some Aus vanilla veterans that I'm starting a guild with in classic. Look out for Murder Everything! So hyped!
---
I’m going to need some TPS numbers, both yours and a Control.
---
I think I remember it being used by hunters and shamans where they could be moving full speed (or almost full speed) away from a target and cast an instant spell like conc shot or frost shock.
---
Say three Hail King Magni's and donate a gold to the Cathedral of Light
---
I think tbc handled this well. They retained most classes' identities and expanded upon them, giving out some more unique things to several of them like bloodlust.
---
Every time I watch this video, it pulls at my heart strings.
---
Classic can't come soon enough boys.
---
I thought about this but as a horde warrior you won't be using heroic strike much at all (hamstring spam) or am I wrong?
---
Also... fuck humans.
---
If I was to ally I'd play a dwarf male.
---
Warrior offtanks usually go fury/prot spec and will take less damage (mainly due to defensive stance's 10% reduction), output more threat, and have great tanking cooldowns to use (last stand, lifegiving gem, shield wall). When not tanking a fury/prot warrior does almost as much DPS as a standard fury warrior. Prot paladins don't have any valuable niche in raids.
---
&gt; I always thought defence cap was a must to tank to get uncritable but that leaves crushing blows on the table still. recently I have learned it's not the case anymore.
---
Where did you learn that?
---
The only reason you wouldn't want to be def capped is if you're a tanking as fury warrior so that the crits could proc enrage for more damage/threat.
---
I dont see how being crittable is beneficial to a paladin tank.
---
&gt; With simple consumes and buffs I believe you can reach 100% avoidance.
---
You need 102.4% avoidance to be uncrushable btw
---
So, take the word of a die hard prot warrior who shits on Pallys.. 
---
K.. Nothing has changed in the warrior camp since 2006.
---
Go for the dream brother /u/redraven_adamw Do your best and if you find a guild that are all little napoleons and wont let you at least try then they can suck it :)
---
I also hope to see some Bear's break the Warrior only tank glass ceiling.  
---
(But in all seriousness.. good luck man. I'm going prot/holy and will probably wait till TBC)
---
When tourists are gone and things start to settle I think we can expect something similar to this sub in terms of people and atmosphere. Lots of newcomers will feel right at home because the kind of breed that will prefer vanilla over retail can be found in all age groups and prior experiences really. I suppose a certain mindset is a critical factor if one will embrace the vanilla universe or not, but what exacly this entail is trickier to pinpoint. OSRS-players will likely fit excellent.
---
This!!! THIS RIGHT HERE!!!
---
Thank you /u/beavertranq (ok, that made me giggle a little bit) You are an upstanding community member!!
---
This is what we need more of.. Uplifting and ok with a I want to try attitude.. Not this.. "shut up and get in a dress" BS that I prayed had disappeared in 2007/2008
---
You can't be over 100% and you don't have to be 440 defence to not be crit just push it off with avoidance.
---
Thanks man a dreamer can change minds.
---
Took the words right out of my mouth. Was going to say this was the golden age. Everything was still so new! So much to explore.
---
Dream brother!! DREAM!!!!
---
I just never understood the problem with hard heroics. They could do normals if they were too difficult. It isn't like the people that couldn't clear hard dungeons needed the gear anyways - the raids would have been way too tough...
---
He definitely must have meant real time not /played
---
yeah its just time and complexity , there are systems like you said.
---
it was my choice to save the points 
---
i think some systems just have a bid roll then a free roll
---
I mean, WC3 certainly holds up by todays standards id say, even if most kids these days would laugh at the graphics, at least theyre amusing.
---
Id disagree somewhat with difficulty though, ToD I didnt find all that difficult at all, like most old RTS, they just had long build up phases. BotDP was harder, but again, more about time than difficulty.
---
WC is pretty hard, but if you know how to exploit the AI, it becomes fairly easy. But yeah, the AI in WC cheats like crazy.
---
oh, you didn't do your research, bucko
---
Skarm has also bear tanked Naxx.  He did a fair evaluation of prot pallies, I;m sorry it doesn't line up with your sad dream.
---
database isnt relevant, its the api that counts... bet on addons being able to work on both retail and classic at the same time
---
I always thought it would be fun to start my warrior with short black hair and slowly grow it out and have it turn grey over time. 
---
&gt; Kael'Thas was SUCH a great character before they just killed him off for no reason 
---
No reason? Wasnt it epic and amazing to be able to experience him as a raid boss as Alliance OR Horde characters? I mean, dont you like killing off characters because theyve been written off as "gone mad"?

I don't remember many people having multiple tho. say locks/pallys make up about 20-25% of population. every 4-5 people would need to buy 2 mounts @1000g to make up for their free mounts. plus the incentive to buy multiple when they're cheaper. I see a lot more people farming rep, which can be a money sink, to buy different mounts if they're cheaper. 
---
He's right you need 102.4% total avoidance. Every level an enemy is higher than you subtracts 0.2% from your chance to be missed, block, parry, and dodge. So 0.2%*4*3=2.4% extra avoidance needed against bosses.
---
Eh it’s not that I don’t think people are worth or something. It’s more along the lines of it removed the need to actually be a decent player to get into a raid. There’s other stuff that went with it as well like prestige and such but I used to complain about not being able to see all of the content myself. 
---
Hell I’ve been using LFR to see all the content since my old raid guild broke up after Wrath. That doesn’t change the fact that it removed part of the social aspect of the game. If you give people a way to quickly and reliably get into a group for content without having to be social they’re going to get lazy about it. 
---
That’s actually part of the problem as well. People stopped really trying to be more social and then complained about the lack of it. Some people may think Classic will be as amazing as they remember but hopefully they’re also willing to put in the effort to make it the way they remember as well. :)
---
Mandatory MX518 as well.
---
Dude, skip the haters. If you wanna prot trash, then you prot that trash.
---
Nothing gets me hard like a CRT monitor with vanilla on it.
---
No, most any guild will take any warrior. The small difference that a human makes is often greatly overshadowed by skill level between 2 players.
---
Yeah I started at 37. Finally had enough for the mount at 41. Took maybe a week.
---
If i had skinning it would have gone a lot quicker. 
---
You literally have no idea what you're talking about
---
How much can you sell the Silithid Carapace Fragments for? Is it a decent way for a player to make some gold?
---
President,   naturally lower than the CEO who is from Activision.    Feels like Activision is winning.
---
What alternative would you recommend?
---
This is exactly why I am playing a priest :)
---
It adds up in respecs though, too.
---
100% this. Thank you!!
---
I also was like woah wtf
---
Cows eat grass. 
---
The thing I like about druids is their diversity (uh-duh).
---
More specifically, there are so many different builds you can use that actually work well. There are absolutely cookie cutter builds, but there are some really fantastic builds as well that you can create to cater to how YOU want to play the class.
---
There is a great WPvP spec that I absolutely love. It's a balance/resto build that goes deep balance and stopping just before moonkin form and going into resto to get that sweet sweet natures swiftness ability.
---
There's the tried and true deep feral/resto build that is great for just about everything, honestly. Probably why it's so tried and true.
---
You can go full resto if healing is your thing (but judging by your post and you clearly stating I don't want to heal, I'm going to assume it's not). 
---
You can go a balance/feral/resto build to capitalize on some of the best perks of each tree.
---
Druid is seriously an awesome class to play, and every time I play the game and try to main a different class, it won't take long until I find myself rolling a druid because I just miss the class so much.
---
Yo, is this the real tips? If so I love your videos man. I have you and all the other guys in the background when I'm working  on this =). No horde version is planned at the moment. I would recommend Joana's guide for horde atm. This is in a wiki format so if some brave soul wanted to use my format and document a speed run for horde I'd be more than happy for them to.
---
Am I old?
---
That's just called running sideways away from your target
---
Alternatively, you can run away normally, jump and spin to hit people with instant cast spells
---
Moonwalking doesn't have anything to do with it lol
---
I played a druid back in vanilla as well and, just like you, went through all the troubles of respec'ing to resto for each raid, being rejected from dungeon groups because 'subpar healer' and I was never able to play feral in raid. I only really enjoyed my time in PvP were I could finally play the spec I wanted. Overall I can't say I had the best of times in vanilla. Thankfully it got better with TBC then LK balance patches.
---
But I'm not going through that rough experience again when Classic comes. This time around I'll be playing a Warrior. As an ex-druid main it pains me to say but they are objectively my last choice of healers when it comes to dungeons and the efforts required to pull off decent damage or threat as a feral these days is ridiculous, farming MCP is just awful. Vanilla is the worst era for hybrid classes.
---
No it's because BFA is trash right now. 
---
Yeah Mulgore just feels so wholesome. Durotar however, I understand why it’s at the bottom. Always hate being there, Echo isles is the only part I like.
---
I’m going ally and I still chose Tirisfal. It’s just got one of the coolest vibes of any zone.
---
Or you can just bring 2-3 tanks and use fury warriors as extra tanks whenever needed.
---
&gt; And your healing is not gimped at all 
---
uhh
---
&gt; Sure you miss some talents
---
Missing "some talants" is being gimped...
---
I would totally just chill in BRS and hang my legs off the bridge ledges. Or BRD and grab a pint.
---
It's hated because the gear is overpopulated. Back in vanilla, seeing someone with thunderfury, as common as it was, still gave a sense of awe, respect and desire, mixed with a little jealousy.  
---
In retail, you pull a monkey lever and receive lewt. Then scream at everyone for being newbs. Also scream at everyone for politics. Also scream at everyone for anything. Then pull another lever for more lewt. Also scream at everyone for having low gs. Also scream at everyone for too few achievements. Also scream at everyone for not doing dailies. Scream about doing dailies. Pull another lever, receive more lewt. Buy more lewt. Buy more gold. Buy more levels. Buy a new name, because people are ignoring you way too often and don't listen to your screams. Always buy more, screaming more, pulling more levers, grinding the wheel because you grind the wheel, and that's all there is to do anymore...  
---
...retail is garbage
---
I mean if we want to go by that logic... wrath loot trading was well received in Wrath, flying in azeroth was well received (minus the world revamp part) in cataclysm, adding time limits to BGs was well received, more changes in AV that were great ect.
---
The whole point of Classic is to go back before that, to before ANYTHING was removed or changed. Yes we will be 1.12 and have a finished questing experience. But although 1.12 AV is better, it's practically Retail AV with more resources required for turnins, lieutenants and commanders, less balanced graveyards and start spots, and sprinkle a few more hours.
---
Were server transfers available in vanilla? I've heard yes. If I roll on a low population server and or find a guild on another server I would like to join, would I be able to transfer the character or were those type of things added later in TBC or later?
---
Realm queue 
---
I would love to see your talent spec for a 49 twink Druid and a 60 Druid if you can. Loved your post too. I’m pumped now. 
---
The valley of trials cave is like novice mode compared to the spider cave in the Teldrassil starting zone. I normally don’t die until level 15 or 20, but I die almost every time in that cave. Especially the part where you’re supposed to jump down for the shortcut out, after the named mob.
---
You're wrong. Having above 102.4% avoidance pushes both crits and crushing blows off the attack table. That's why warriors using shield block can't be crushed/crit while it is up.
---
Well, what was the post about? It also could of been some kind of error on their side mixed with a busy day for tickets
---
Overpopulation and dynamic respawns are horrible. The gameplay is still fun if you can get into BG's and dungeons, but world play and experience is meh.  
---
This is why I support sharding in starting zones for a short period after launch...
---
&gt; learn to enjoy the process
---
This is the absolute most important thing. WotLK -&gt; current WoW taught people to focus on the destination/goal, rather than the journey. If you do that in Vanilla, as I did when I played on Nost... you're going to burn out in a hurry.
---
The memories of getting stuck on the outside of teldrassil after falling down the waterfall.... I felt like a badass as an explorer in a place I probably shouldn’t be, but I felt like a dumbass going the whole way around and not hearthstoning.
---
Druid was my first character, although second to max lvl. I had no clue what I was doing (leveling balance badly). Now I want to see what the class is really capable of. Tanking specifically appeals to me in PVE, as well as the flexibility and dueling potential in PVP.
---
BTW, everyone here should be watching Skarm and Ebbnflow on YouTube.
---
Druid hype! 
---
Last time I pally tanked it was a solid 11.
---
Play what you want. Who cares about a bunch of little gayboy tryhards
---
STI-JEE-EN
---
I need to book my vacation time...
---
And if paladins push crits off the table, their threat and avoidance both go in the toilet. Which is one reason why they're bad.
---
I tried really hard to get into Battle for Azeroth but I didn’t even get to max level. 
---
I just...could not have fun. 
---
I’m playing ESO for now and it’s fun but Classic...that’s the only way to get me back to WoW. 
---
Sadly I get where they're coming from. I used to be the same way, just with YouTube and never the chance to actually see them. I'd obsess over Minecraft YouTubers like AntVenom and SkyDoesMinecraft. Played on the Sky server just hoping to see him.
---
Now I look back like "man I was an idiot" now I see all these young teens do the exact same thing, but with a chance to scratch the itch that is that dream. They'll grow out of it, at least I hope!
---
I didn’t find it boring. The trick to leveling characters in WoW is finding out how to keep it fun even after it becomes 2-4 hours per level. Run dungeons, group, go to a new zone. I find that I only become bored if I don’t like my current zone, Feralas sucks compared to Un’Goro. So, I might skip some quests, run BRD or Mara, maybe find a good grinding spot. Then, I’ll come back later and continue doing quests. But, this goes for every class, not just priest. 
---
This breaks my heart to read - partly why I quit before Cata came out. Wrath was fun, but I felt that the game was going to change for the worse, and rl needed more attention anyway. I tried to come back for MoP, but after two months, I had easily leveled 4/5 characters, and tried a couple raids. Boring. PvP was ok, but everything was cookie-cutter. Do it ONE WAY or get destroyed. Do it that one way, and you just pressed the easy-button for victory, or you get an identical match and luck decides. Maybe gear, if someone is new, or a very skilled player can change it, but other than that, mostly luck. No fun. No immagination. No magic.  
---
...I haven't been back
---
For these reasons I really wish they would release classic, and then treat it as an organic game that requires balancing and adjustments. I know people are afraid of what they may do, but they have TBC as a good example of how to make small adjustments to the Druid to help them keep up with the rest of the classes. Even small changes like moving Insect Swarm over to the balance tree helped so much. 
---
It seems to me, based on what I’ve read here, there isn’t much of a choice depending on what you want to do. 
---
Woah buy it lunch first at least

There's a 100g duel between Finalflash and a warlock streamer where FF secretly tosses on his shadow resist set and resists 3 fears in a row. He wasn't even using as much as this video shows.  
---
Druids are awesome and barely need much more than base level 60 stats + a bit of int/armor so doing stuff like this is not game breaking for them.  
---
It's not really much of a factor at that point. If crits are pushed off the attack table the paladin can't be blocking any more than they already are so redoubt procs become pointless. And reckoning isn't a significant source of threat. There are a lot of reasons why prot paladins aren't good tanks but that isn't one of them.
---
The vocal minority. Have to be loud so others know we are indeed here.
---
When u have server pop of 9k+ because there are few servers to play on.
---
I looked for 1 much smaller and having a much better time.
---
No BS answer. If you don't want to heal, don't play druid.
---
If you don't want to head my warning and stull want to be a feral dps/OT in raids you will effectively need to be unemployed to have the time to do it but it is viable. I have seen feral druids put out over 1k dps in raids and they can often beat out hunters/some shitty rogues on dps meters. Plus they are viable as tank until naxx excluding a few fights. 
---
The problem is though, you are extremely reliant on consumables to do your damage. This means you're gonna have to spend alot of time farming gold on a class that is traditionally pretty bad at farming gold just to be "viable", but not exceptional, in a raid environment. That's also not to mention a mandatory bop consumable that can only be farmed from gnomer that you'll need to spend hours farming before raids. And even after you do all that to get ready for the raid, it's gonna be hard to gear because there really isn't feral gear in vanilla and the pieces you can get you'll have to compete with other classes for, which is further compounded by the fact lc guilds will be reluctant to give you gear in the first place because of your spec/dps. Personally I'd recommend you play rogue if you want to play feral
---
I don't have time to look through every single class, but from what I remember: stamina is prioritized on all classes' PvP sets (except, ironically, Druids, who have an even spread of all stats + bonus armor). Survivability is more important than raw damage for all classes in PvP combat. The PvP gear should be better *in PvP* for every class.
---
As far as the PvP gear in PvE: having the rank 13 set "not much better than T2" is significantly better than the TBC version of PvP gear, which is "Gladiator epics are worse than dungeon blues lol get fucked"
---
Right!?? Talk about #nochanges
---
I think that was the best part of my first character in WoW - I never meant to keep him, just started one to "see what it was like" and I didn't even like the name. But after almost 30 levels of exploring, I couldn't bear to quit, or start over! There was soooo much more to explore and see and experience! And BG's!!!! Sooooo fun - even when meeting up with a "twink" who would easily best me, it drove me to find a way to beat them in return!
---
Yeah, I could see it working on Paladin or Druid. Are you planning to test it out on a private server?
---
you used ad hominem wrong ... yikes
---
Uhhhhh.....ok ? No idea what that has to do with what we are talking about.... Nor would I ever want to play with someone with that kind of mentality. Enjoy your guild picking on "dweebs" lmfao
---
Has a dream that felt like it lasted all night one time that I was slowly making my way through the hallway to the last boss in gnomer but extra things kept getting pulled and we never made any progress.
---
Ahh yeah, I remember watching that at one point. Really strong even with just some shadow resist gear.
---
Now that I think about, you're right.
---
But even then, you cant realistically be at 102.4% avoidance at all times, so you still want to be def capped if you dont want to eat crits.
---
oh, haha. Good to know :)
---
A dreamer can't change how the game works, unfortunately.
---
Yeah I am trying to build a set now. takes a bit of time though!
---
Bloodrage &gt; Shoot &gt; LoS with terrain &gt; Battleshout (this is your AoE threat) &gt; use Revenge every time it’s up &gt; the next part depends on mob life expectancy
---
* mob dies in 6 seconds: Taunt kill target &gt; Sunder each target starting with 2nd kill target (X)
---
* mob takes more than 6 seconds: Sunder kill target twice, then sunder each other mob once
---
If you’re fighting non-elites, mages should AoE them down, don’t try to get threat.  If any mob hits the healer, taunt it off, even a non-elite. 
---
Once you get comfortable holding agro on 4 targets, you can start by using shield block, then revenge on kill target, it’s almost twice as much threat for the same rage cost as sunder. But, learn the basics first. Also, if you’re having trouble tab targeting, then on nameplates, they’re easier to hit. 
---
Those speakers doe' 
---
Boring troll 0/10
---
And the advance! This picture gets more and more trippy
---
Tirisfal Glades. Oh boy... I started around late September '07. I remember levelling Ikrana through Brill as everything was changing over with jack-o-lanterns and candy as the real world was lingering with the air of a crisp Jersey autumn.  
---
I am ready. See you at Gallow's End.
---
Honestly my totally unrealistic dream is to have Vanilla, BC, and Wrath back and just stop there. 
---
There’s more than enough content right there to keep me busy for _years_. 
---
Op why is everyone saying your guide will be wrong? I think it's nice that someone's actually making a guide for Alliance, because when you google leveling guides they are mostly horde or only low level Alliance guides.
---
The gloves that replace Edgemasters drop in BWL. 
---
without redoubt and reckoning they have like 8% block and autoattack, and once every 10 seconds, you have 38% block with a 95 damage proc if you happen to block. If prot pallies had the block of warriors, sanctuary would be a lot more legit. Pallies just fare worse with threat as their survivability goes up. And if if they try to push threat aside from that, they go OOM and then lose even more survivability since they can't spam holy shield to get their block over 8%. Garbage all around. And this is coming from a lifelong paladin since Vanilla. I wish they were legit, but it just ain't a thing.
---
No, he means that you would be unable to loot for 10 minutes and that you'd be sliding on the ground kneeling because you'd be stuck in the looting animation.
---
...hope is dangerous...
---
Maybe the retail developers will realize then people want a game with community, justified rewards, and difficulty. 
---
That's exactly why I made the guide. I found a big lack of them when I myself went looking so I did something about it. On the internet people are generally very negative. Appreciate your support =)
---
That's just regular strafing, moonwalking is 100% client side and nothing more than a neat bug.
---
Only for Horde, and only because of Whirlwind. 
---
Holy fuck. You just gave me the most nostalgia I have ever experienced. 
---
I remembered having this thing, but I could never find it so I just started to think I was misremembering things. Turns out, it did actually exist. 
---
you're not getting into any guild with that attitude chief
---
if I was boring youd ignore me get a life
---
Got it
---
There is a Tauren Quest early on that requires you to get some Earthroot which requires 15 Skill to pick. 
---
good now shape up lil twat
---
You merely said that you were impressed by the guy they are upset with, and also said that you made changes, along with being so giving to the community offering to work on it together.
---
I hope you remain motivated, I find this really exciting and will follow along.
---
4 str 4 stam leather belt 
---
nice one get a life man
---
I usually had 30-50 on Vanilla. I currently get 100-220 on pserver. 
---
I couldn't argue that - I don't have any firsthand knowledge of it, but I do recall many warriors using the handgaurds for leveling in TBC, up until around lvl 64/65.
---
Not to mention Anger Managment will make tanking a million times easier (because it’s easier to pool rage. 
---
Arguably the No Changes crowd that isn't conducive to the feedback that Blizzard needs and specifically asked for, ie spell batching, is entirely unnecessary. 
---
Hmm, it sounds like the thing with Blind and other non-missile attacks is probably a funny combination of the "abort attacks" part of Vanish and spell batching.  Interesting!
---
Heroic Strike costs like 22-23 rage. Don’t bother unless you have 70+ rage. 
---
Correct. 
---
Best scripting I have seen to date 
---
Getting def cap can be good but for a warrior it's questionable whether it's worth shooting for before reaching the cap becomes mostly trivial. For a warrior def cap is definitely not worth it for MC/Ony because almost none of the bosses can get around shield block and the few times it is bypassed getting crushed/crit doesn't really matter. Also it is extremely hard to hit def cap in pre-raid gear and requires wearing garbage gear like the Deathbone set. BWL is a different story because Broodlord, Nefarian, and Chromaggus if he has bronze breath, all are hard hitters that can get around shield block at times. Tanks that don't have a lot of raid gear yet should just accept that they might get crit and prioritize other stats, while raid geared tanks might be able to wiggle their way into def cap without losing too much stats. By the time tanking AQ40 and Naxx getting def cap is generally pretty easy but isn't necessary on many bosses due to shield block.
---
You might want to Bloodrage after your ranged attack hits actually, since it'll generate rage and a static amount of threat to the pack you aggroed.
---
Also I'm pretty sure the debate is still raging on whether Battle Shout should still cause threat if the party members already have the buff.
---
If you’re leveling Arms, you want to stack more Agi than STR, this usually requires some leather armor, exactly why you’d want 2% parry. 
---
Maybe data that isn't completely made up? Lol
---
The current consensus is to either level Arms, or respec between 30 and 40. 
---
Entirely depends on your rage generation. If you have excess rage to dump that Bloodthirst/WW and Hamstring spam won't take care of, then do it. I'm not knowledgeable enough about horde warriors rotation to know whether you'd want to use excess rage on Hamstring for WF procs or HS.
---
I've also learned from a former Dreamstate warrior that you only want to use Overpower at lower gear levels to keep Flurry up. When your gear is better (I'd guess BWL/AQ and higher), you're better off staying in zerker stance and not losing rage from stance dancing.
---
I like what i hear here. I've been looking at builds and i know what you're talking about apart from the feral/resto one. Do you mind linking the spec? 
---
...it's not worth it. I remember one of the best tanks on my server in Vanilla being a night elf, though, so it's not like it's a handicap.  
---
The point of vanilla was to experience the gameplay and lore - and if that's what you want, you will love the night elf, and make full use of everything they have to offer.  
---
But if you really want to min/max, I'm sure about 9,000 people will scream that if you don't have an orc or human you ought to go diaf...
---
Orc for PvP
---
Troll for PvE
---
Tauren for being big and cuddly
---
(charging a PAT or unsuspecting horde out of shadowmeld IS a lot of fun, too)
---
You completely overlook all the abilities unlocked with Tactical Mastery, like disarm, pummel, intercept, whirlwind. Tactical Mastery is the second best PvP talent in the game (second to Mortal Strike). Plus, Sweeping Strikes is to force an enemy healer to decide who lives, excellent for PvP because Warriors are naturally bad at shutting down healers 
---
Hahaha you don’t really see “gay as fuck” on Reddit these days. I lold
---
Yeah no. SoR is neat since you get 2x chances to proc per swing, but it doesn't compare to Hunter or Warrior proc chance.
---
Awesometographer did the math in the comment chain. Now imagine a warrior that does the exact same spamming Nightfall, but on top of that has Flurry up 80% of the time through either melee or Hamstring crits. That's even better than a hunter.
---
True. Basically since less of the warrior's auto attacks are hitting while dual wielding a greater % of their auto attacks are glancing blows.
---
It’s not possible to max a weapon skill at any point during leveling in Vanilla. 
---
100% this - and some guilds love stoneform from dwarves.  
---
The biggest advantage a human tank has over the other two is actually using Presence of Mind to break fear (which happens in quite a few instances as you level up, and in BRD/UBRS, iirc) and get off a taunt to save a healer/squishy before other mobs would otherwise grab them and break their spine.
---
&gt;Shadow Priest. Its a spot every holy priest wants. 
---
Curious what makes you say that? PvE players who pick priest are probably more likely to have healing in mind than paladin, druid and shaman players do. That's from my experience anyways.
---
Yeah I’ve never knew that battleshout generates threat, I was using demoralizing shout and just using battleshout to keep the buff up
---
One final note: the racial 1% NE dodge is phenominal for progression guilds, as long as they don't mind overhealing
---
The artifacts were from legion, BM just has Hati as part of its kit now... And Hati is not why BFA is trash atm. So yeah this sounds like just blind hatred.
---
That's not a very high bar considering how miserably coded most servers are.
---
No Journey will win.
---
Too produce a true to life classic experience OCE players will be assigned to NA realms with 800 ping. 
---
Yep.  Came here to post that.  This guy knew his shit.
---
Oh yeah I agree, I saved the points too haha, just saying the system I saw, used, you used, is silly.
---
Be careful what you wish for.  Jeff might be busy pandering to the OW community, but as VP, he might come over here and fuck things up if he hears us yelling.
---
It doesnt. You are faster than everyone else. You will be the only person in the zone you are in. And if you are not and there are actually other ppl than they are those who are interested in getting fast to 60 aswell so no ganking will happen.
---
Yup used to called it Knee Skiing back in the day. Your toon would stand up enough occasionally to attack but otherwise you looked like you were sliding around in the kneeling animation trying to loot. 
---
Murdering Horde.
---
What ever you think looks cooler
---
Minmaxers should be euthanized 
---
Literally NONE of that has ANYTHING to do with what I was talking about.
---
Like are all of you actually retarded? Because all I was talking about was Hati and the Artifact weapons from Legion. Which are Blizz going back to class specific weapons and class quests with Order Halls and Benediction, Rhokdelar. 
---
Like this is pure cancer, none of you actually read what I posted aside from asking if its blind hatred. Which you two proved it is, you never even realized I was talking about Hati/Thalkiel/Knaifu, you just jumped on me for &gt;Or is this more of the blind hatred on anything that isn’t classic and mass downvote on anyone expressing any like of new stuff?
---
Also your entire post is ironic. 
---
&gt;Then scream at everyone for being newbs. Also scream at everyone for politics. Also scream at everyone for anything.
---
You mean like how you and the other guy are doing to me for liking something from the last few expansions?
---
Gotta love this, your not allowed to like things from old wow AND Modern wow. (Even though Order Halls and Artifact weapons are glorified Benediction and Class quests).
---
Depends on if he can actually get in a server right away and depends on how the starting zones are and whether or not he can get far enough ahead of the curve.
---
Thanks for this dude, must have been quite a bit of work, it's appreciated.
---
&gt; not sure a good example for warrior
---
Every time you parry, it reduces your attack speed by half. 
---
You made zero concrete points and then attacked someone for not understanding you. 
---
No lol, spell batching has nothing to do with frontstabbing. It was possible in vanilla in the sense of a random bug, really nothing to do with the implementation on private servers where you can easily use it to level the entire time.  
---
People didn't mind too much on private servers because it just helps buff rogue and druid levelling, which are two fairly weak classes in vanilla.
---
i love Classic WoW but not *that* much
---
Man my old guild leader was arcane and was the top dps usually in our progression guild. And we were a solid dam grp but ya I remember him trolling others with his logs in trade, the rest thought fire was better.
---
That's no gameboy fam, it's a CELLULAR DEVICE
---
As it should be. Done right, the PvE content complements and drives PvP. Done wrong (too easy to gain ground, too easy to cap GYs, etc.), it becomes solely about rushing Vann/Drek - a heavily PvE experience.
---
At least there won't be reinforcements here, but the beefed up NPCs, trolls at snowfall, lieutenants, etc. would really make it an epic battle.
---
AB and WSG already exist for short BGs. No idea why people who don't even like AV in the first place want it to be a short BG. 
---
Good point asc\_\_, but imo, demo shout &gt; battle shout for threat, and acts as a slight damage mitigation at low levels.

Also, in response to the OP question, you can use t-clap but iirc, you have to stance-dance to do it, so if you don't have tactical mastery, it's not worth the loss of rage, so use cleave on small groups and eventually WW when you get that (lvl 30?). Another t-clap strat is for only when you don't have to pull a group back, and you can charge in, t-clap, then switch to defensive stance, Bloodrage and start smacking things for aggro...
---
Tab targetting will save your group, and the sunder/switch strat with revenge on CD as mentioned by robmax works tremendously well - I would just add that once a mob is below 50% health, simply switch to the next target and break CC to hold aggro if you have the hp's and your healer has mana.
---
On that point, try to get your group to do as much CC as you can - this allows you to focus on holding one or two threats, and makes progressing through a dungeon a little more fun, so long as you keep the tempo fairly constant, in regards to your teams mana regen.
---
Finally, consider points in things you might not normally want, but will be extremely useful - such as Piercing Howl. This is an absolute must for slowing down a mob running after a healer/dps while your taunt is on CD. And don't forget about mocking blow, once you learn that (again, gotta stance dance for it...).
---
In short, to answer your question, as mentioned, revenge&gt;sunder is your best friend. Then if you have the rage, throw in a cleave or HS if you only have one or two mobs. And if you've had enough, intimidating shout and hearth out. Jk, don't do that! (Unless you are using it against a single caster as an interrupt in-between shield-slams, preferrably when the target is rooted/slowed and won't run out of range before you can break fear).
---
A basic melee attack with a 2hander generates 7-8 rage, being hit by a mob while leveling generates 1 rage. ID rtnher take less damage. 
---
Some things have been adapted though. We got class quests again in Legion. We also got quest chains for class only weapons like benediction and rhokdelar (Artifact weapons). Honestly getting stop gaps for grinding instead of infinite like Azerite would be amazing. 
---
Depends on the situation. Pally+Warrior is definitely the safer option and easier for beginners. But in a BG sitation the Shaman can pretty much remove everything the Pally does for his Warrior very quickly, but the allies will it harder to find time to kill totems quickly enough. It then comes down to if the Shaman + Warrior can burst the opposing Warrior with Windfury and Nature's Swiftness before the more efficient heals of the Pally win out. It's a pretty even matchup in that regard if both sides play well.
---
So: Pally + Warrior for more consistency, Shaman + Warrior for more outplay potential.
---
No problem, see you in classic =)
---
The closest thing to that in Modern are removed titles like Of the Black Harvest. 
---
No problem!
---
Getting dial up then eh?
---
At that point, might as well have a little fun with it and make a 49 lock twink.
---
I don't know who hurt you or what kind of shit you've been through to make you think and talk this way, but I give you my best wishes and I pray you get the help you need.
---
You could pick up a sandbox single player RPG like Withcher 3. That could last you until classic comes out if you're a completionist.
---
Yeah I didn’t think of the piercing howl thing... also I didn’t even know that shouts generate threat it doesn’t say that in the spellbook... is there anything else like that that I should know?
---
I remember thorns being so powerful against melee in TBC didn't play Druid in Vanilla. Rogues would jyst die from moon fire and thorns.
---
Orc is going to be the overall "healthiest" choice because they bring a lot to pvp and basically nothing to PVE but that isn't really crucial.
---
Troll is the best PVE race overall because of zerking heals being relevant, zerking can be hit or miss in pvp.
---
Tauren help slightly in PVE with the hp and maybe the stomp rarely. Some say Tauren is the race to go for elemental pvp because of the way you can line up a firenova totem with a stomp as part of a large burst combo.
---
Nailed it. To elaborate a bit, Troll is best for PVE because of Berserking, which enables them to push out better healing or cope with more stressful situations when needed. Orc is mostly good in PVP for that stun resist, but if you want to roll Enhancement that axe racial can give you a slight edge. 
---
Check out Battle Chasers: Nightwar. Great game. 
---
&gt; Minmaxers should be euthanized
---
You're going to be that guy who is always really sad when the best raiding guild on the server is in Org after a raid and you see them in all their epics, but you're still in blues and greens on your balance druid and the only way to cover it up is to shift into Moonkin form, but then you realize that's embarrassing in it's own right.  
---
The minmaxers can get annoying at times, but I think you're being a bit extreme 0.o
---
Thanks for the insight. What is zerking? 
---
His evaluation opens with suggesting that Prot paladins are fine low end tanking, which I believe OP is planning to do. 
---
Also some of the issues he brought up were about paladin's mana being a problem. Skarm clearly plays with top end DPS machines. His guild/groups require an insane amount of threat generation from their tanks to maintain aggro. With less threat needed to maintain aggro for less try hard dpsers paladin tanking is not nearly as mana intensive, because you do not have to spam high ranks of holy shield and conc etc. 
---
Middle to to lower try hard guilds will be able to utilize less than optimal specs.
---
Then they'll use sharding to prevent realm queues until they can open up realm transfers. 
---
Part of hosting on their new infrastructure is that they care a lot less about if you're playing retail or classic the infrastructure is scalable. 
---
Yeah man i feel ya, I am 26 years old, and can not afford more than a few hours back to back of devoted game play. I can still enjoy leveling and professions, as well as battle grounds and world pvp though. My limited amount of time to play has always thrown me behind the curve in terms of raiding and completing content while it is current. Although what i think is inportant if you want to raid as a casual, is stick to one toon, and lvling slow will be find, once you are 60 find a guild that fits into your schedule perfectly (not easy) and you if you can salvage 3+ hrs of uninterrupted gameplay, you can easily manage an mc or bwl raid in the future. Good luck have fun!
---
 
---
I never had that one. It sounds like a GPU driver issue.
---
I did frequently have the issue where trying to pick an herb would cause me to permanently kneel. If I recall correctly I had to log out and back in to un-kneel myself.
---
I can’t fault you at all it can be a burden for sure. Gl!
---
I had that one also haha. I just thought it's really funny. That it was so shiny and bright and you couldnt look at them
---
Isn't the game running on legion means that most current addons would work besides those that rely on newer stuff and additions? 
---
Thats some good advice. Thanks for the kind words stranger. 
---
Druid is well known to be the best thing in WSG, and everyone loves MotW!
---
I played nelf warrior in vanilla and tbc. Shadowmeld was very situational and probably not as good as other racials but it was fun.  I went alchemy (definitely not a min/maxer) so using invis pots into shadowmeld was a fun way to confuse ppl.
---
Few problems I have with what you said:
---
1) It actually IS smaller, and not because of flying. Compare Northrend to Kultiras and Zandalar, the size difference is big. And most of Zandalar is unreachable.
---
2) On class identity they try to fix some of this, visually and story wise and in legion I felt they were successful. Mechanically I’d say Shadow, Demo, Destro and Aff were good identity wise all around. Shadow and Aff didn’t even play similarly and they are the two to most likely step on each other’s toes.
---
Also no ones taking my damn soul stones and cookies from me, If blizzard even thinks about it I will burn down Anaheim in felfire &gt;:(
---
3) TBF Hybrids weren’t supposed to be in as bad a spot as they were in Vanilla. I agree though conceptually they should be a bit behind pure DPS, but at the same time I feel Locks are supports but I don’t like the idea of them doing less damage. Mostly because if we didn’t have to actually waste debuff slots on helping the party we could do kick ass damage. 
---
4) This is the main one I disagree with. If you weren’t rolling in the dough WoD-Legion you are FUCKED in BFA. My farming for a week was enough for M+ and raids for THAT week. If I got a BOE I could fund myself for 2 weeks off that. If it’s not a killer week in M+ Reforging Azerite and buying all the pots was KILLING me.
---
5) I actually don’t disagree with this at all. Unless your in an RP server or on Test realms there’s no community. No one to talk to. It was actually a shock to me when I went on the PTR and saw a bunch of Zandalari having conversations and Meme rping to each other and non zandalar. That was the most fun I had in weeks before some random ass Orc started speaking gibberish and making death threats to us for RPing in Org. Pretty sure he was high on narcotics. 
---
You're giving it to your OT in case your MT bails.. which usually means that the OT would take the main tank's place.
---
You know your first point with the server names got me really hoping they go with more neutral names now. 
---
If it's like vanilla, a dps warrior will nearly be a waste of a raid slot. You can do it, but it's not efficient. And yes, I know, 1,000 people will downvote this, and scream about how they knew this one guy, or how they did it, or post screenshots of them actually doing it (on pservers)...  
---
...but if it's like vanilla, you roll a warrior to tank. Period dot. There's going to be plenty of other DPS classes "gearing up" that will take up those low-ranked dps positions.  
---
That said, a horde warrior tank with a WF totem is the #1 way to progress. It's almost cheating how much extra threat you get. Forget about the human +5 mace/sword skill. Simply organize a group/raid around yourself and a shaman with WF, and you will be considered the best in the game. Doesn't even matter which race you choose, because they all do well as tanks, and WF tanking is godlike. Go ahead, TRY and pull aggro off one. You can't!
---
Not trying to be rude or anything, but in "ye old days", I was dual-boxing with WinEQ. So there were several multiboxing software. 
---
If you were basic to- moderate at programming, you could write your own multiboxing software that requires 250 or less lines of code for it to have basic multiboxing capabilities. A lot of people don't know that all these multibox software just use the built-in WinAPI functions. They are very simple
---
- Resize Windows and position them in a specific spot?SetWindowPos(), MoveWindow()
---
- Rename different World of Warcraft clients to something else? SetWindowTextA()
---
- Send key outputs to different clients? SendInput()
---
There were a lot home-made solutions to multiboxing back then
---
Pick an EST PVP Server near the top of the list ir an edgelord name pretty much. 
---
I dunno we are doing mythic progress and there are no monkey levers in sight.
---
Just wait until Wednesday. There will be a sticky named “Looking For Group Wednesday.” You can post your idea in there and see who bites.
---
Join a guild. Vanilla requires groups for success so there's a vested interest in folks being friendly.
---
Play a tank or a healer. They'll love you even more.
---
Beserking. The troll racial ability.
---
Taking a break from the BGs and the grind of those for rank to engage in some world PvP.  You don’t want your progress in that ruined for a little fun in the field. I don’t know why that’s hard to understand.  I personally was working on ranks, but would have liked some wtold pvp raids without having that damaged.
---
We weren’t there to farm honor, we were there for world pvp for the sake of world pvp.  Why does that have to entail accepting someone screwing with your ranking too?  And why are you so hostile?
---
I’ve been playing retail for a long time. I’ve been with this game since I was a preteen only stopping for a few months hear and there, and honestly imo gear is devalued moreso now. Reason being: I can resub in 8.2 and I know I can quickly get my Lock heroic raid geared by doing some easy M0s and low level keys. Solely because of how they treated Season 2. 
---
Our mt in Vanilla, got the second binding and bailed to another realm, like within the hour.  It stopped for him while we were farming aq and wiping on c'thun.
---
Berserking is the activatable troll racial.
---
Politics like this is exactly why I always despised raiding. I absolutely *hate* it. Because of this, about the only gear-grinding I'll be doing endgame is PvP sets.
---
I get shamed and attacked enough here for liking modern and classic whit, I’ll be sure to avoid anyone from this reddit. So yes, please congregate on one server so I can avoid the toxic elitists. (Not saying you all are but it feels like the majority are)
---
Try some Diablo or path of exile they are fun for a quick 30 mins session or an 8 hour gear grind
---
What?
---
If it like vanilla then you'll have like 5 fury warriors who will all be at the top of dps...
---
So those of us who do Mythic raids and Mythic Plus but enjoy elements of classic and modern WoW are a plague now?
---
You must have been a fearsome pvper! 
---
Upgrades are always nice. And it's fun. Dont speedrun your way to 60 if you haven't experienced much of vanilla, you'll regret it!
---
Not to mention while you're leveling you'll be asked to tank dungeons, and having the points in parry is actually a huge part of damage mitigation as a tank.
---
&gt; Especially since you have to physically go to the AV and AB ques in Southshore and Arathi Basin. Ques are never instant and the best way to pass time is to battle it out with the people waiting for the que on the opposing faction.
---
Dude, it's been more than four hours I think I'm supposed to call my doctor. 
---
I am so fucking stoked for this!
---
No, you won’t be able to frontstab in Classic.
---
I like your points here, but 1h fury (while my personal favorite for the reasons you cite) often frustrates a lot of beginners due to the amount of missed hits. This means less damage done, more damage taken, and longer downtime. But with a healer, and maybe some +hit/+skill gear/racial etc., it starts rockin'
---
We need monkey levers though. Just imagine a random level next to mekatorque. You pull it and suddenly...
---
“WERE GONNA OOK ALL NIIIGHT”!
---
From a purely speed POV no not worth it. To experience the game though and have some fun yes they are.
---
3-4k depending on the server 
---
Dungeons are definitely worth it, Especially if you get the quests. I was watching a Joana stream the other day and someone asked if it was worth it to do dungeons and he said definitely, there actually very good xp and he said the only reason he doesn't do them himself is because if you don't have a good group it's a waste of time and he's usually too far ahead of everyone anyway to get a group for the quests.
---
I think if you grab every quest for Uldamam and do them all, it's like by far the best xp/hour you can do at that level bracket
---
Tauren doesn't have enough maximum mana at level 1 to cast wrath twice. Takes 5 seconds to start regening mana since you casted the first one. So once every 6 seconds until you hit level 2. Now the regen after 5 seconds is high at lower levels, but that does nothing if your total mana is too low to cast...
---
Agreed, #nochange all the way.
---
Raw exp is not that great no.
---
Quest exp and rewards are usually too good to pass up. Even most leveling guides advise at least one run through. 
---
Not to mention you're going to want a break from questing/grinding once in a while for sanity's sake.
---
Also you want to have a decent grasp on how to run with groups and utilize abilities.  You start getting invites to raid guilds in the 50+ dungeon runs if you show you know your class.   If you haven't grouped up at all while leveling up it may show.
---
&gt;hopefully they’re also willing to put in the effort to make it the way they remember as well. :)
---
I think a lot of the guys from pservers will act like starter batch of yeast for a whole new generation of unleavened players. All it takes is good leadership to get the bread rising and I think the whole community will form naturally around this, complete with all its caveats.
---
Do Germans for example, really want to play on a German server with only Germans people and everything in German? 
---
I mean nothing wrong with Germans but as a Swede I would rather kill myself then play on a Swedish only server so thought maybe Germans, who generally speak English well, might feel the same?
---
I actually lost my mind when I learned about batching while watching Tipsout. Soooo pumped!! Rogues will be hella fun!
---
  4. Please don't use questie or questhelper addons because they will moot the magic that should be Classic. If you're going to run around with an arrow leading you, just play Skyrim.
---
I know my kingdom awaits
---
Tanks, always tanks. If we're talking being competitive.
---
You need a lot of (8) geared tanks for Naxx and that means you'll likely not be lucky enough to start passing them to dps. Granted many of these warriors are likely timing DPS more often so they'll get it eventually if you get many of them. The thing is, the 1.12 version isn't that great for fury. It's too fast and the proc generates a lot of threat for which they have no threat dump.
---
If it's available as a one handed (instead of main hand) and you're going to pass it to someone who will never tank then it's best as a Rogue offhand. They can use the faster speed and they have threat dumps to use it most effectively.
---
Thats why they plan on sharding. 6 is temporarily 50 
---
you're almost better off with a shield off-hand (OH) if you get a 1h sword =/&gt; than your current 2h weap. (This happens). Don't lock yourself into two 1-hand weapons if you get one good one, because then you'll miss a lot, but the shield doesn't carry the hit penalty, and gives you an interrupt in battlestance, or some damage mitigation in zerker you otherwise lose w/20% the more damage taken penalty
---
I've asked for exactly this, "Ladder" style rotating servers, since pre-wrath (2006). I always got laughed at and called a fool.
---
I'd do it, every time.
---
Solid plan. My brothers and I are rolling Dwarf alts (Pally-Priest-Hunter trio), so it'll be a fun adventure every Sunday morning or so :P
---
We'll never cap though XD
---
Thanks! \^\_\^
---
I'm really looking forward to trying the Horde quests (more seriously) this time around. Hopefully they're just as good!
---
If you're attempting to get to 55 as fast as possible, most dungeons are a waste of time for various reasons 
---
* Traveling
---
* Waiting for party members
---
* Wipes with punishing corpse runs
---
* Ill-prepared party members
---
* Ragers/Quitters
---
Some classes it's more necessary than others.  
---
* Druids/Hunters - Skip them all*
---
* Warlocks/Priests - BFD for the wand after then never again*
---
* Melee classes are all about keeping your weapons relevant, dungeons are the best way to do so.
---
^* There are some dungeons that come at opportune times with almost a level's worth of quests that are easily acquired like Uldaman.  The other one I usually do is Zul'Farak, after I've completed the scepter in Hinterlands.
---
Haha one day a week? You'll be lucky to hit level 30 before naxx finally comes out. That does sound like a great time though
---
I will be doing 3 dungeons between 20 and 60, and that's IF I can get a group together in a reasonable time, otherwise, I'll be skipping them all. Personally, I'm \#teamnodungeon
---
that being said:
---
&gt;first and foremost, would like to start off saying that I've never played classic
---
**Do them all**. Or at least the most iconic ones / for your faction. (alliance = deadmines, SFK, stocks, gnomer, all scarlet monastery wings, uldaman, ZF, Mauradon, sunken temple, then 58+ dungeons at 60.) each one might "cost" you an hour of lower xp vs questing or grinding, and 'cost' another hour of getting shit put together... but if you've never done them when they're pertinent.... **that's 20 hours well spent**. You've never played vanilla / classic so why rush to the end that you might not like?
---
I've run The Deadmines like 93 times, two dozen or so during OG vanilla. I've had that experience. It was great, but I've been around the block enough times to know I enjoy the raid dungeons 10x more. So I'm comfortable in skipping stuff that's awesome for things I like more. You don't know if you prefer leveling dungeons or progression raids, so do them all.
---
That time spent doing dungeons won't put you behind anyone except the poopsock tryhards that you don't even know if you'll get along with, so just play.
---
Quite a few people who hang out of the wow sub, and tweat at wow devs are.... for lack of a better term, unstable at the best of times.
---
I've levied criticism here and there at questionable features and the motivations behind them, but after watching some conversations that take place over there it's no wonder blizz doesn't talk to anyone.
---
These sorts of people need to be called out and removed from conversations at every step.

When I played vanilla I do not recall anyone being impressed by that kind of no-lifing. I am not saying it never happened, just that I never saw it.
---
Good tanks and good healers and cool people were all well regarded. Nobody cared at all about some no-lifer who got a lot of Thunder Bluff rep or whatever.
---
Imo, escape artist in vanilla is overrated. It's on a cast timer, and cannot be used while moving. Human racials are better, for both PvE and PvP, if you're really min/max'ing.   
---
If you're going alliance, pretty sure Human&gt;Gnome=Dwarf&gt;Elf for "doing it all" - especially if weapon skill, breaking CC, reputation or finding stealthed targets matters...
---
As of right now Tirisfal Glades has 666 votes, perfect.
---
Dungeons are worth it when leveling. Get all of the quests and run the dungeon once. You can do it more times but its not worth it time wise unless you have a group that wants to do it immediately after the 1st run.
---
at 55+, dungeons are usually worth it if you are sick of the grinding/questing. Quests will be more sparse at this point so its beneficial to do them, but again, same with the rule above; do it once at least. Plan to do a lot of lbrs, brd and temple pre-60. A lot of good items in all 3 dungeons. brd even has some good gear for 60's.
---
They would have to be fucking insane to make ONE na and ONE eu pvp server 
---
Came to say this. Jesus.
---
...ok that was funny
---
awesome video!
---
Meh.  Still waiting to know exactly how phasing/sharding is going to work in classic.  I feel like a lot of this info is coming in all sorts of convenient ways.  Don't get me wrong.  It's all great news so far, and gives me some hope that sharding will be handled properly, but I just feel that until specifics are clarified we still cannot rest on this.
---
Most will agree that sharding is most definitely a necessary evil the game must transgress in order to offer the best launch experience, but we still don't know if sharding will be used in other situations.  It's my view that any answer that isn't "absolutely not" is worrying.
---
I will do dungeons.They are fun to do and most have 5+ quests in them. You will find groups easy and you will get better gear which is always nice !
---
They paid Ninja 1 million to stream it. Look it up if you don't believe it. 
---
I hear you. I played in the stress tests and then through The sand while I'm excited for the game, I think a lot of people are hoping it up to be something it can't be. There's a lot to like about the game, but people are already talking and planning how they're going to skip around all the content that made it special the first time.
---
On the other hand, Reddit isn't just one person, so hopefully the people excited for the leveling and forced socialization aren't the same people memorizing leveling guides and BIS lists rolling with full raiding guilds ready to rush through MC.
---
We don't know how macros will work in classic, they are going to be different
---
I am skeptical because the bulk of vanilla WoW leveling time is so skill-insensitive. No amount of skill makes you run 10% faster or makes your pet’s autoattack do 10% more damage. There’s a certain amount of ground you have to cover and mobs you have to kill and no amount of skill reduces that. You might as well try to speed-run watching all the Harry Potter movies.
---
I'm concerned for my health.  I played a lot of games as a teenager, but now that I'm in my 30s I don't know how the lack of sleep is going to affect my focus at work :P  Will need to find balance again.

I loved dungeons. I went for the whole shadowfang then dsrknantle on my rogue before I hit the PvP grind. It's a lot more interactive finding a group in /4 or general and succeding. I didn't do much in rating though
---
You would die of overheat in those places lmao
---
I didn't even see the 20-40 comment. I loved leveling and hitting the dungeons as I go. They all were super unique to me and refreshing as well
---
I'm 26 and plan on playing pretty casually and enjoying the leveling. 
---
I'll be there on a horde toon messing with the Defias Traitor XD 
---
Why play the game if you don't want to see one of the best parts of the MMO?  Yes, you can skip ahead and never play those dungeons, but why are you rushing to level 60 anyway?
---
Why do you care about rushing to 60 if you have never played vanilla?
---
If you like to have shitty gear, not have fun and not make friends through your leveling then I recommend skipping dungeons.
---
You're thinking of the 100% mount, bruh.
---
Oh, man. I'm going all-in on this. I'm gonna drop some PTO on launch and get real weird with it.
---
No, right now they are working on a hacked Legion client. So already you are off
---
It's too purple for me
---
I've always loved mulgore, but after doing Durotar a few times..It's a lot faster simply because mulgore is fucking huge.
---
I am STILL doing a tauren warrior but the path to the barrens I think takes way longer as a tauren...and you die a lot more
---
I'm rolling a druid. Gonna try aoe leveling in bear form. 3 mobs at a time always. Being able to tank OR heal any dungeon means I'll be popular and never have to wait for group. Self healing and survivability is excellent. Also you get stealth, travel form, aquatic and can even rez ppl. Hands down the most versatile class. Also unique gearing in bear form means it's easier to get what you want.
---
Yall talking about the cave and I'm here with PTSD from the cave in mulgore, swoops, and overpopulated gnoll, harpie and wells.
---
God so many fucking mobs grouped together makes warrior leveling even worse for tauren :(
---
I would really like to clear up the misconception of "I do X thing on private servers just fine so it will work."
---
&amp;nbsp;   
---
No private server has had a correct implementation of feral druid itemization that was akin to what was found in vanilla. Every single one has had some clearly busted thing like weapon enchants proccing off kitty auto attacks causing near 100% uptime on them. Weapon damage affecting the auto attack value of kittys. Not to mention a low level weapon with a certain Proc being the BIS weapon for kittys because of a hidden item value that was left unfixed for a certain servers entire life time. If you play on a certain realm named after a chapel don't think its Blizz like in its implementation of druids either.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
To OP: If you want to play pretty casually and raid MC &amp; BWL, a feral druid will serve you just fine only be aware that you will be bottom of the charts on most encounters and may have a hard time getting into pugs but if you're a committed raider most guilds will accept you just fine. MC &amp; BWL were not tuned nearly as tightly as the later raids.
---
If you want to clear AQ40 &amp; Naxx on a feral druid I would strongly advise you to roll something else. Good feral druid gear is far and few in between the later in the game you go, and you will be fighting rogues for some of that gear and it will be hard to convince most guilds to give that gear to a feral druid over their rogues even if both of you put in equal amounts of effort.

If you want to PvP unless you want to dedicate a good portion of your life to getting rank 14 you will need to do some form of PvE to stay competitive in the long run.
---
Cant wait to see how fast that tune changes when Classic The Burning Crusade gets announced...
---
The guide will be very useful. It doesn't matter at all if the XP values are off a bit. It's the path that matters. Always good to have a good leveling guide. Thank you.
---
Best gaming mouse of all time.
---
its worth it for the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fun&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and sometimes if you get all the quests its good xp and you get gear that can make levelling easier.  
---
that wolfshead helmet for druids is bis, cant skip that lol
---
I usually tip if I can but yeah, especially if you're in a guild. You could also trade prof for prof if you're leveling profs while leveling. I'm sure any caster would take a wand for 4 bags or some potions for more efficient leveling.
---
You can try it out with threat meters to be sure (once available), and the shouts thing I learned by tanking VC in vanilla. I needed threat, and once I applied the debuff, they would attack me (very briefly) before going to a healer.  
---
You can also get a... oh... come on brain... there's a "shield spike" I think, gotta google it but I'm at work. It's not great if you don't block a lot, but when you do, adds take damage and it helps improve aoe threat, as long as nobody is attacking them and you're not taking so much damage your healer pulls aggro.  
---
It also stacks with retribution aura, so if you have a pally, instead of devotion aura for mitigation, you may ask for ret aura. Also thorns from druids.  
---
Consider setting up your key bindings so you have useful talents/stances on "Z, X, C, V, B and N" as these are all easily accessed by your left hand while you position/move. Having a mouse with programmable buttons for procs is a must.  
---
For your weapon, "white damage" is a great threat/rage booster - so you want the faster weapons, rather than slower, high dps 1h's. Yes, this isn't flashy, and means you aren't hitting as hard, but you get faster heroic strike/cleave attacks. Just be aware you can rage-starve very quickly this way if you aren't careful.  
---
Finally, in vanilla, never shy away from Agi gear. IIRC, Agi gives an armor boost, +1 attack power, +dodge and +crit. Str gives +2 ap. Agi is a HUGE friend, and many prefer it even over Str. (Myself included).
---
Very nice 
---
Run each dungeon once for fun. Re-run any that have quests you were unable to complete on the first run. After that, go back to regular questing. Some of them might not have the highest xp per hour due to few quests and long group formation/travel times, but it'll be fun and you may luck out and get some dope gear. 
---
Awesome analogy
---
Whet about dungeon quests
---
They played too much retail where the main goal is to boost to max level ASAP 
---
Have fun healing.
---
yeh the cat form quest is great
---
Good gear. Part of the RPG character growth experience
---
Yeah i just looked at the wiki saying these were out in 1.5. I was looking at wowhead and they showed it releasing in 1.11.xx
---
&gt; if so many people - who are part of this community - want mega servers, should they be the majority then it's the will of the community.
---
Yes but should they change the game because of that? If the majority of the community wanted cross realm zones I sure as hell wouldn't want them to implement that change. I think they should aim to recreate the game as closely as possible to the original version.
---
Be grateful if you even get one thunder fury, we raided mc every week from around May 2005 till BC on EU server, and we only ever got 2 lefts, MT got 1st, I got the other (rogue).  Although 2 nd was just put out for DKP and I happened to have the most.

---
all i know is my back doesn't miss moving old school TVs / monitors 
---
What you've described sounds appealing. Is that with or without spell batching? What was the decision as far as what will be implemented in the game?
---
&gt; class balance
---
At the expense of class identity 
---
And yet you disputed me when I commented "Not really" to a guy who claims having access to the source code is the same as not having it
---
Sounds like my kind of guy! I still remember when I had only 2 peices of heroic 25-man LK tier, most everything else was normal 25-man, except my offhand, trinket and rings - those were all heroic 25-man.  
---
I was asked to join a guild run of normal 25-man LK with the top guild on my server, because their DPS were tired of farming 25-man regular LK. Their mage (considered the server best) is there in full heroic tier gear, mocking  this "arcane mage noob" (me) - and so I couldn't help but laugh at each fight as he tried so hard to come up with excuses as to why he couldn't beat my damage output: "I'm not even flasked for this" "I'm not using pots" "I'm not even trying, just don't even care to be here..."  
---
Until he finally "DC'd" after I posted a screen-shot of him, fully flasked, with the pot buff pre-pull, alongside of the DPS chart where I cleanly destroyed his output, and damage taken (I think it was Blood-Queen Lana'Thel, so damage taken can be kinda unfair), but they all swore one of their rogues would finally top the charts on that one. At first it was fun, as the guild went wild calling in their best players to try and beat me, but once he left, the entire chat went silent for nearly a full 15 minutes before someone PM'd me and told me he was a guild officer, and was cussing me out over another ventrilo channel.  =/  
---
At least they gave me the sword that dropped off LK though! (It was the last/only upgrade available for my character in regular LK) =D
---
I though that too.  In retail leveling can be a drag, but in vanilla WoW, it's much better.
---
And you would have thought there was no way blizzard would re-release classic before you saw half life three XD
---
dungeon quests yo
---
That is with spell batching. In our latest update from the classic devs, this is how they want the game to function, similar to how it was in original vanilla
---
It's a fundamental gameplay mechanic that effected many classes in both pve and pvp across two expansions and was unchanged throughout vanilla. It's very hard to imagine how it could possibly 'slip through the cracks'.
---
What does that have to do with dungeons?  
---
Speedrunning to 60 doing no dungeons and nothing outside lvling will make u burnt out of the game faster. Im speaking from experience. Not gonna do the same mistake again.
---
That is correct. But going 
---
From 100 to 105 while leveling doesn’t interfere that mutch as going from 1-105
---
You don’t notice the miss rate /lower damage when your just a level below.   That’s why you should do it organic.  
---
from leatherworking...
---
I don’t think anyone meant actual harm.
---
Nah there are places where they WILL die no matter what.  
---
Private servers love Druids. I don't think I even saw a Feral Druid on retail until TBC. On private servers, I see more Feral than Resto.
---
Is anyone else a little sad/annoyed about the prospect of warriors being a little easier than we remember them this go-around?
---
Yeah but there's going to be a crap load of Undeads. And as someone already mentioned, fighting a Shaman will be a pain because of purge/tremor totem/earth shock.
---
Horde Warlock is way better.
---
oh shit i forgot its crafted, mixing it up with the one that drops from mara.  same model haha
---
Yep, I remember the huge backlash that happened when Nost shut down. It really brought vanilla WoW into the spotlight and got people who never even thought about to talk about it. Blizz may have eventually made Classic anyways, but I have no doubt that Nost gave them that nudge to finally do it.
---
I really hope they change their mind on rp-pvp servers. I've never played on an RP server and was hoping to join an rp-pvp server so I have the highest chance of not being on the same server as popular streamers.
---
We can only hope it never does.
---
It was added in Wrath of the Lich King, boats were added there for Alliance to get to Howling Fjord and Borean Tundra.
---
Dungeons are worth it, but not as a main way to level up. You may need to run the same dungeon a few times to complete all the quests, and you'll get a fair amount of raw XP (I'd advise having some rested xp stored up to maximize leveling). However, I would not continue to run the same dungeon over and over again after you've completed all the quests. If you got a blue from any bosses while completing the quests in there, excellent, but dont continue running the same dungeon in the hopes of getting a blue. You'll just be wasting your time. 
---
The thing about vanilla is that it takes just one single event to make a friend.
---
One dungeon.
---
One quest together.
---
You find someone friendly, you see if they want to do something with you next time as well. If they agree, you have a friend.
---
New servers are where there is masses of people leveling, all looking for new friends for quests &amp; dungeons. Don't be a retard when you're with people and you'll have heaps of great friends in no time.
---
These friends might even be better than real friends for the new server. You and your real friends might log in for different lengths of time. You might end up 15 levels ahead. This ruins the fun. Waiting for your friend all the time also ruins your fun. Making masses of new friends as you level, and then doing stuff together at 60 as you all reach there at your own pace is where the fun is.
---
I'm personally going Human Shaman
---
i remember this being a thing with ret paladins who would weapon swap and heal and it did indeed bypass the weapon swap gcd when macroing the heal cast and weapon swap together.
---
Literally a 30 yr old boomer bedroom
---
When it comes to names, can you be called an object name?
---
Nothing offensive but I'm wondering if it's allowed.
---
Oh hell no. 
---
lol indeed
---
I heard it in his voice. I watched this scene an unhealthy amount of times. 
---
Does that matter for Dire Maul? People really only wanted a phase without Dire Maul to begin with because they were concerned about Dire Maul loot trivializing MC, something which mostly concerns serious raiders who take the time to farm DM loot 12 hours a day for pre-raid BiS.
---
The original Dire Maul opened like 3-4 months after release (europe basically had no time at all without DM), what point does it make to wait 6 months now for something we already know in and out.
---
Keeping content behind phases is a way to keep hardcore players in check so they don't rush to endgame content, it's not meant to make sure all the regular old "I can play 2 hours a week"-players get to see every bit of content before the next phase hits. I don't see the point of keeping DM locked away for very long.
---
Hadn't even considered this wouldn't be in Classic. I quit playing altogether after Wrath ended, so I'm not sure "how it is now" - but like Minkelz said, I can't imagine how it could possibly "slip through the cracks" because for me, this is normal!  
---
In fact, I'm betting that the 1.12 version of character builds already encorporates it, but I'm glad you brought it up, just to be sure!
---
Diaperhead
---
Well put. I am one of those who agree it's necessary at launch. I am also with you on the idea that if it is not shut off at some point, it's wrong.
---
When we were kids yes. We've upgraded to 1440P panels now, larger and nicer desks, much better hardware and worse backs. 
---
I'm actually ok with this - TBC was a lot of fun. But I wouldn't mind if flying mounts were restricted to only a couple zones, and arenas were either cancelled or the PvP sets were nerfed, or required as much effort/time as the vanilla ranking system did.
---
I see he is trying to compete with me. I'm at 3d 17h as a frost mage.
---
They're usually worth it at least once or twice to do the quests, because dungeon quests often come at the end of big chains with large xp rewards and good items. Plus the gear itself will help you out a lot and speed up your levelling process too (remember that generic mobs around the world aren't completely trivial).
---
Perhaps if you're speedlevelling an alt and you can bankroll regular upgrades from the AH for them, dungeons would be slower. Or (on a case-by-case basis) if the dungeon is super far away from wherever you're questing.
---
&gt; Anyone who wants the item rolls and trades the d/e'd gem mats to the guild officer for the item itself.
---
It can be done this way because it can be open to abuse in edge cases.
---
EX I had a guild that if something was going to be D/Ed it went to /roll for offspecs. All the mages decided that they were going to /roll their class gear every time so that they could be 100% sure to get the offset items first instead of all the other classes since they had to use DKP on their class sets.
---
"people who play the game differently than me should be euthanized" ooohhkay
---
I guess they just didn't want to put in any effort...  I don't know, really.   They hated CC and having to coordinate attacks.
---
But I was having a blast, and even teaching new people what to do was fun for me.  Once Blizzard killed that, there just wasn't much left for me.   I had fun in Legion, but it was all a single player experience.  I never came back for more than a month or two, after early Cataclysm. 
---
I think there are perhaps better alternatives to sharding that could be used short term during the launch.
---
I think the method that BDO used is probably much more appealing to most of the classic players.
---
That's my hope as well, but it's a fear; it became an even greater fear after I brought it up on a warrior theory crafting discord server and had one of the addon developers posit that it might not be patched back into the classic client. 
---
Minor changes I wouldn't mind:  
---
Right-click reporting/ignore
---
Wall-hopping (this was innocent fun, ok?)
---
Even travel-distance for Horde/Alliance in AV  
---
Knock-back snowballs! &gt;:D
---
Major changes I (probably) wouldn't mind:  
---
1.5/1.6 AV battles (maybe as an additional option, or seasonal?)  
---
Give ret pallies an otherwise-meaningless threat reduction talent in the ret tree.  
---
Hunters with focus vs. mana (verrrrry tenuously)  
---
Slight druid... something... to make them more endgame relevant (mayyyyyybe)
---
OH! Guild banks!!!! I DEFINITELY want guild banks!!
---
So far I'm on a very strong high relating to my hope in Blizzard's ability and willingness to bring this project to up to snuff.  
---
If they decide to not run a beta, it's going to kill that high because I think a beta is strongly necessary in order for the community to help verify authenticity or at least flag things for authenticity concerns.  
---
I remember this discrepancy in Pandaria. After killing bloody Deathwing you have to go in the valley of the 4 winds to save sheeps XD.
---
I certainly hope it is already in, but this is a trust but verify type post :)
---
Someone who plays what they want because its what he likes versus someone try harding because their worth is measured in purple pixelated swag?        
---
         
---
Im sure he was being hyperbolic with euthanasia even if it was uncalled for but dont throw stones if you live in a glass house, your shit was just as cringey.
---
Failmane if it exists lol (Frostmane)
---
10-4. 'Preciate the response. 
---
What even..
---
10-1K
---
I also had the same poor plant which didn’t know what side to grow because it never got any sunlight
---
Depending on your guild, you'll likely have a shaman or two not specc'd for manatide, and there will only be 2-3 melee DPS groups. I remember having a shaman in every group....
---
Both aren't mutualy exclusive right ? 
---
There's a lot that could be done in this regard which most lively won't ever be done because it's classic and not vanilla where balance / class updates patches were most likely a thing
---
I'm pretty sure a beta is gonna be a thing, however, I'd expect it in a month or so if it's actually happening.  
---
Classic managed the perfect 50/50 split between casual and hardcore. You had parts of the game that everybody could do (1-60 journey and doing pre raid dungeons), but you also had stuff like AQ scarab lord or R14 grind which took months and brutal dedication.
---
Nowadays you have 5% hardcore content in higher level mythic dungeons and mythic raiding. The rest is pushover. You dont have content in which hardcore players and casuals mingle anymore.
---
I did this shit as well and you better believe Im gonna do it again.
---
wait what? thunderfury never gets replaced in vanilla :/
---
it was quite literally so good for tank threat that it was still used early into TBC :/
---
17 comments and 2 had to be removed. Says something... I don't know what, but it bothers me. I think, somehow, in my mind, 90% of kids who looked just like this guy did at that age, were innocent, young and rolled alliance. Probably a night elf, for various reasons.  
---
And again, in my mind, those 2 comments who had to be removed, represent many of the sick-minded horde players who sought out the young, innocent children and joyously slaughtered them in Redridge, laughing and poking fun at them along the way.  
---
This is why, once I made full level, I would stop at NOTHING to hunt and stop anyone I could who mercilessly hunted lower level characters without honor! It was cheesy, but "For the Alliance" became something of message to protect the young and innocent from the horde, and those PoS's like the individuals making lewd comments here.  
---
So whether that was corpse camping an annoying horde player, or making a guild for newbies with no idea what they were doing, so they could progress without the exposure to the explicit profanities of older kids and sick-minded men/women, it made the experience a little more rewarding, just knowing that it wasn't all about me. It was about saving the World. Of Warcraft.  
---
\#Swordofathousandtruths
---
That's honestly part of why I prefer grinding on my warrior than on mage or hunter.
---
Warrio can pull similar gold per hour numbers as hunter if you farm DM:E, but you NEED a healer for that.
---
This forces me to socialize and it's more fun.
---
A bit of an exaggeration perhaps.
---
That's uber cool.
---
Honestly, raiding in Vanilla was so time consuming I don't know why anyone would want to recreate it and have to schedule their life around such things as soon as they possibly could.
---
If they dont work at launch, I wouldn't worry about it. Itll be at least a few weeks before enough people get to 60 to form raid parties, and in that time, I'm sure the addon kings will have figured out how to make them work. 
---
Be water, my friend
---
Looking at this from a pure min-max perspective:
---
Melee classes can easily keep their weapons relevant with quest rewards. The gear dependency of melee classes is generally overblown, especially when it comes to leveling.
---
Warriors especially get their Whirlwind quest that lasts them from the early 30's to their early 50's after which you can aquire AV quest reward or other late game relevant dungeon gear.
---
Even if you really value your weapons you can upgrade greens every 10 or so levels and blues every 20 or so and be completely fine.
---
Dungeon grinding for weapons can be worth it even in terms of gold and XP over solo grinding, but only if, and this is a big IF, you have a good group, don't wipe and keep a good pace.
---
I'm completely unfamiliar with any other alternatives... but you have my attention... (not that it matters - I'm not a dev for Blizzard and my opinion does not hold any weight)
---
Sucks for you guys, I never played classic or TBC, I came in at WOTLK and didnt really pay much attention to where my greatest gear came from, and never really looked that stuff up online since I was always trying to speed level to 80. So everything is going to be euphorically fresh to me, like it was for so many of you over a decade ago. 
---
Stackable shards for locks - wouldn't break the game, would save bag space. Makes sense.
---
Yeah but they are mostly using 1.12 because that's the earliest running build they have at hand =\
---
I wonder how much of AV was changed (spawn and hp are one thing, but the map and assets are harder to deal with i think) and whether it should warrant to build back the old one 
---
Damn that's ingenious. I'm stealing that idea. I have other, more conventional methods to making a few hundred gold quickly, but that's a damn good idea.
---
The problem with this is Dodge works directly against your rage gen. You want Blocks/Parries to produce rage, there are no talents, etc for Dodge to do this.
---
[Run home, Peter! Run as fast as you can!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdmvhDOAv8)
---
Great idea folks. Lets make another failing Blizzard title.
---
They think they've changed their ways. So does the community at large. But that doesn't change the fact that wow is running on a Legion engine. 
---
I feel the exact opposite about Elwynn, lol. I always thought that atmosphere was kinda generic and boring compared to other zones, but I picked it because it's one of my favorite leveling spots. The area's small enough that you don't spend too much time between quests just running around and there's only like two or three spots that can get kinda dangerous (the murlocs in the northeast and the area around Hogger are what come to mind; the kobold mines can also be annoying for some classes). Plus you're already right next to Westfall and Stormwind, which was another favorite leveling area and already being next to a city means you can pick up stuff like a wand/weapon training/etc. right away. It was just convenient and easy lol.
---
ok :((((
---
Seriously bro, if you have never played classic before don’t worry about min/max. 
---
You should do all dungeons at least one time! You can gather up at least 3-5 quests for each, and you would still get a decent amount of xp with the chance of getting some blues on the way. 
---
I don't think internet connection is a gameplay mechanic.
---
Quite amazing, but unbelievably depressing. 
---
10/10
---
BDO effectively added extra servers for given realms.
---
think for example:
---
Blackrock 1
---
Blackrock 2
---
Blackrock 3
---
all of them shared the same naming reservations so unlike merging traditional realms there was no naming conflicts and it was done with the intention of them being merged early on after the initial launch.
---
you could think of it as "static phasing/sharding" where you choose what realm you log into with the knowledge that all eligable realms will be merged eventually rather than it happening in the background without any control.
---
IMO it solves allot of potential issues like intitial launch stability and playability, it avoids the situation where blizzard may make a whole bunch of excess servers while people filter out for whatever reason and then being left with a whole bunch of empty low pop servers.
---
and it also avoids the issue of merging existing realms together to solve population by sharing reserved names to avoid naming collisions.
---
As long as they keep an original classic server, would that really be so bad?
---
aah ye, that old good animation bug, now I remember
---
But, wasn't it a TBC thing?
---
Man... played hundreds of WSG’s running those flags. Grinded unbelievably hard to get Field Marshall in vanilla PvP on my Druid. Was some of the most fun I’ve ever had playing an mmorpg.
---
it was basically a relevent linnk to youtube.
---
Idk, maybe the bot didn'T like that "youtube.como/watch?v=2uSD-10G" style of link? Especially the "2uSD-10G" part?
---
My only priest character was a Male nelf, I didnt realise I was a special snowflake.
---
I absolutely love balance pvp, so much fucking fun with 300 engineering and co sums. didn't really enjoy pve all that much though (+_+)
---
Fully agree with this. New players should always be doing them. Not only for the purposes you mentioned but also because leveling dungeons gradually increase in difficulty and approach variety.
---
This means a new player or someone who didn't play vanilla for a long time will greatly benefit of doing them. They are not only fun but they also teach valuable lessons about pulling, threat control, mob mechanics and boss mechanics.
---
**Highly Recommended**
---
SFK:
---
Everyone *must* do this dungeon at least once. There is quite alot of interesting wipe potential in there including the end boss. This dungeon teaches you to be watchfull of mob mechanics as well. It's an iconic, well designed dungeon with great lore as well.
---
Gnomeregan:
---
A weird ass dungeon with very unique internal quests, mechanics and very interesting loot. Also some really tricky encounters, mob packs etc. If you don't know what they do you can easily wipe there.
---
Scarlet Monastery:
---
A very good test for new tanks and healers especailly. This dungeon is often tightly packed with hard hitting mobs that will punish bad pulls and or bad movement. Fantastic bosses for a leveling dungeon.
---
This is where the true leveling dungeons stop. I count Ulda/ZF/Mara already to lategame relevant dungeons because some classes will already find close to, or even pre-raid BiS stuff in there. This is where everyone should start filling some gaps in their shitty leveling gear because itemization becomes relevant at this point before you make your first steps into ST/BRD+.
---
Plenty of time to RP at 60
---
&gt; What they don't know is exactly how long after the release of phase 1
---
When did Blizzard say that?
---
Push it back so I can play Division 2 for more than 2 months
---
But I was good anyway. I was hiding on na cliff, and massively AoEing them when they coouldn't get to me so easily. I was one of the BG's top DPS.
---
Still, I lost every arena I joined. They just were throwing themselves at me instantly once the timer expired. There were no cliffs or any way to hide for a mage.
---
They make your experience more fun, so yes! Plus you should get the carrot from ZF at some point anyways, might as well do it while you can get XP for it.
---
Man I used WoW as filler between the episodes. 
---
Shame about Ep3. Marc is a great dude. 
---
I have two nerd shelves above my desk currently - one Half-Life and one WoW! 
---
You're right of course but people will downvote here because they don't really understand the gaming industry and why it's so shittt today compared to when classic first launched.
---
This was the golden age. 2004 was right around the time we got the Half-Life 2 updated E3 footage. It came a year later.
---
WoW was obviously making waves back then. We were watching previews for games like Prey - which had seamless portals. It was mind blowing. 
---
It was an amazing time to be a young PC gamer.
---
Rise, Night Elf Druids!
---
Play the game.
---
this...this is actually pretty similar
---
You're missing
---
Server type:
---
Server timezone:
---
I think there will be a lot of people trying to form quilds close to launch, but at this stage there probably isn't enough to form any complete guilds when taking choice of faction, type and zone into account.
---
Personally I will just be going where the in-game opportunity arises. Meet people while leveling, join a guild with them if their guild sounds like one that meets my goals, move to a different one if I'm wrong.
---
Use keybinds instead of clicking. Don’t keyboard turn. You’ll improve a lot with just that. 
---
I'm currently raiding on a private server and with full wbuffs and consumables I reach 45-47% crit and my critcap against raidbosses being also about 45% due to having lots of hit gear to counter.
---
&gt;Then I advise against Druid. The whole reason why Druids are so much fun to play is that they can fill any role. They don't excell at any of those though. If you simply do not want to heal you are kind of butchering the class and make it only half-fun in my personal opinion.
---
Personally the big issue is that, even if you can fill any role, you are a healer first and foremost, especially while raiding. And that ends up with you in ending up with mostly healing gear and scraps for anything else. And druid is the one that feels *better* of any hybrid due to the large amount of PvP-achieved gear used by feral...
---
I'm quite in a similar position to OP as a former tbc player: either I suck up, play the classes I enjoyed at the time the way I hated (mained feral bear, along enh/ele sham and shocka alts in retail at the time, did dislike their pure healing side even if I was forced into it for a long time due to guild matters) or simply sacrificing my playstyle specially in PVP (I'm mostly a melee player, with heavy group utility focus, something the 2 actual melees feel lacking...).  ¿Any advice?
---
It's not about macros. It's just assigning abilities to keys that you can tap faster than clicking. It will feel weird at first but go full immersion and it will become natural before long. Only use macros if you normally have to press two or more keys to do one action. For PvP, duel, a lot. Watch people playing your class and ask them what they are doing differently than you. Some people just panic when they start fighting and just blindly use abilities with no strategy. You need to be able to think in the moment and that just comes with experience. 
---
I did
---
I dont know what that means
---
Were you dropped on your head as a baby?
---
Yea you answered your own question you can’t be a clicker and be efficient and effective. The biggest thing that stepped up my game was getting a mouse with a keypad on the side this allowed me to easily keybind every ability and with practice use them just as fast as you could 1,2,3.
---
I need a new mouse anyway. Any suggestions?
---
Set your A and D keys to strafe left and strafe right. Bind your keys and never click your spells. Once you have your spells mapped you can start focusing on other things.
---
Lol
---
Press buttons on the keyboard instead of clicking spells with mouse.
---
Don’t use the arrow keys to the right of the keyboard to turn, hold down right click.
---
Play it more.
---
A and D keys are automatically set to strafe, I strafe a lot
---
I will
---
Read, pay attention and get used to maneuver your keyboard and mouse quickly.    
---
  Beyond that, being decent or goodish in wow boils down to just knowing what the fuck you're doing.  
---
  It doesn't matters what you're attempting to practice and improve if you're practicing the wrong thing to begin with.  
---
  This means knowing your class, what you can and can't do, how your skills help that and knowing what your enemy can do, be pve or pvp.  
---
  For pve, this means rotations, aggro ranges, threat management, knowing what to do in x situation, etc.  
---
  For pvp, knowing what your and the enemy class can do becomes much more important, for example.  
---
   
---
  I can be a hunter, due to dead zone most hunters want to stay far away from my target so naturally most hunters will just run from everything and stand still.  
---
  However, good and/or experienced hunters know this is often unavoidable and/or sometimes even favorable, if someone used cooldowns to get to you wing clip them, FD, lay a frost trap and get away, sometimes you might even want to charge them for that wing clip, basically ensuring they won't get close, all while squeezing in shots.  
---
  This needs you to know what you're doing and what the enemy is doing, pay attention to his cooldowns, etc, and one of the reasons why hunter is kinda easy to pick up but one of the hardest classes to master.   
---
  Something extra important in classic that wasn't that relevant in wrath is threat management, if you over aggro a boss over your tank that could be a wipe right there, always pay attention to your threat even more if you don't have a skill that can deal with it.  
---
  As for the keyboard/mouse part, practice using keybinds, macros, and learn how to move quickly, moving is CRUCIAL, so many people I've seen, the kind that die to the fire, that just don't quite know how to move well.  They either keyboard turn or they're slow to react or whatever, moving fast and react quickly should be second nature to the point where you don't even think about it, you just do it, this applies for both pvp and pve.  
---
  As for the bosses, know their abilities and read up on them, if a boss starts doing something you don't sit there thinking what to do, you should know by instinct and instantly do it, you get out of the fire instantly, you hug the group, you move away from the group, you get close to something, you have a macro and insta target x mobs, etc.  
---
  So, a basic TL;DR without making a book about it, just read up on rotations, boss abilities and gear and know your mouse and keyboard in an out, know their abilities and know how to move and you will go through a raid boss as it was second nature.  
---
I leveled priest twice past 40 on private servers.  I would have gone further but this was during a time where a cease and desist was imminent as well as after blizzard had released the classic wow announcement. 
---
To make a long story short, I like healing and I've mained spriest on retail from mop-legion. I'm into the priest fantasy (minus the pedophilia).
---
But once I leveled on a warlock compared to priest on retail, I became a changed man. The convenience, power, and efficiency of warlock made all of the negatives associated with old school wow a breeze. Warlock just feels more powerful and well executed imo. While I never leveled to cap on a private, (which probably matters regarding my class choice because I feel I would enjoy raiding as a priest more than a lock) I still feel compelled to now consider warlock my first choice. 
---
What I didnt like about priest is that you're a class designed around being a healer first and foremost, even if it means you're inefficient and inconvenient. Warlock feels like the fastlane whereas priest feels like it has obligatory chores. 
---
Then you must not visit forums of any kind.
---
I seriously doubt it. People would lose their shit.
---
The bar on the bottom of the screen are already set to the first 9 number keys, should I switch those to something else? Also, I use wasd to move, usually.
---
you have a 4% chance to be resisted by on level targets, you need 3% hit to be hit-capped as the last 1% can never be covered, you will always have a 1% chance to miss your pom-pyro.
---
For healing probably troll due to casting increase through berserking.
---
Change A and D to strafe left and right 
---
This weekend.
---
Another system I loved was that of the original guild wars where once a district was full the server would create a "district 2" that players could phase into and out of at will.  
---
The problem is sharding is already 100% an available option on wow servers which makes it not only the easiest option, but also the cheapest option.  Which is also a win for consumers and the studio where saving money and development time is concerned.
---
There are definitely better possible options, but I don't see any way we get out of this without sharding.  The only thing we can do, as community members, is make sure blizz understand that we definitely don't want sharding in any other situations.
---
At the very least they can have the balls to work on servers that go down for one reason or another without flipping the sharding switch at the first sign of trouble.
---
So you want the exact same thing but in a more old and outdated way that will require even more work from Blizzard?
---
I'm sure there were plenty of these around, we had to change from seal Cub Clubbing Club to heal cub hugging Club after getting reported. Wonder if anyone else had this problem..
---
You can reassign all the slots to a key. 
---
You don’t have to change strafe because holding down the right mouse click and a turn key makes you strafe already
---
EU banned memes btw so I think you should reconsider
---
Grouping is more fun.
---
I will never spill the goods on my strat but I had some instances where I could run them very fast for friends, being a mage made it easier. If a mage can solo the boss or kill it with healing they are the defacto best low level dungeon runner due to them having the best aoe in the game, higher level content like Mauradon others will take the lead.
---
You won't have a problem finding a offtank raiding spot in a nice guild as a dedicated Feral with raid experience. I would definitely vouch for a player like you and I know several people who would. People who raided in vanilla or TBC know whats up.
---
I like having to click the targets and outperforming other mages come time to check decurse meter.
---
I was just about to say something along the lines of "no offence... but.. it's not you.. it's me".  I'll go with upvoting yours.
---
id agree on most exept for the pewdiepie part, If you check closely of what he was accused for and what he said you can see media trying to paint him out like a villain, because that gets them clicks, but they are probablt people who would mindlessly follow him if he turned out to be a nazi after all.
---
Yes if we assume 50% are horde then you can multiply it with 2 for your faction. However, if 80% of the answers are horde players, it will be a much bigger multiply. 
---
Let us have the macros we had in vanilla, if you don't like them "trivializing" your experience then don't use them.
---
I quit them when they were released. I see them as a waste of time now.
---
You can also combo shift, alt, ctrl + 0-9/F1-9/[aA-zZ] etc so you can have over 50 different combinations without moving your hand, or a lot more coving the whole keyboard.
---
Like you sort of said, it is a generational issue.  It wasn't just the addition of certain systems to WoW that, for some people, ruined the game.  They were added almost because the newer generations were headed that way anyway.  Blizzard has often enough been surprisingly forward-thinking; sometimes not quite forward-thinking enough, but oh well.
---
That's why Classic in 2019 will be so different from 2005/2006 in my opinion.  It's a majorly new generation of people playing now.  Even if don't end up as the majority of the population, they will be more than significant enough to have a big influence on changing the game.  Even if some of them are literally the same people that played back then, I still count that as part of a generational shift because of how long it's been.  People DO change.
---
Thats a nice thing but i can guarantee you will get behind on leveling in the case of speedleveling. But thats not what vanilla is about so if you just want to have a great time, level as a duo
---
Druid doing druid stuff.  
---
TBC gave us our two most pvp iconic spells aka cyclone and lifebloom. Shapeshifting was also still core of our gameplay in PVP. But to be honest we were quite a bit busted ;) Still very good pvp ERA
---
Yeah I thought about leaving out point 6, but I'm too min-max :D 
---
That is a great point.  Many just want to get in, and poke around just to make sure nothing shady is going on behind the scenes.  Things that marketing would likely mask until after launch when blizz has already raked in millions of sales and subs.
---
The current track record is leaning toward "beta-likely" with all the great recent news, but summer is coming.
---
There's someone on pserver who's arguably better than Joana, forgot his name but he got 1st on last 2 pservers that mattered. 
---
Thanks dad. 
---
Since I've only ever been a DPS, I have gotten very good at PvE. Fighting bosses and knowing what to do is second nature to me, I just struggle a lot with PvP. I think you're absolutely right, I need to know what I can do, and what my enemy can do. I usually treat all enemies the same no matter what class, and just use my PvE rotation on them. I guess I got some learning to do. There's just soooooo much information to take in. Spells, attacks, buffs and debuffs. But I've got a few more months to prepare.
---
&lt;Kampfgruppe Sturmwind&gt;
---
Played a while on them, didn't like it. Too much drama, too many bots, too unsave. It was the only thing we had so it was bearable but with official classic on the horizon? \*insert fuck this shit I'm out meme\*
---
Feral DPS in raiding can be very competitive up until Naxx ([Check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUc70zMFAKI)) but it takes a lot of commitment/effort.
---
However you'd need to spec into full feral which is not necessarily the greatest for PvP where more hybrid builds are generally better. You could still perform well in PvP with a full feral build though!
---
CLOSED beta at best if you ask me
---
What's the tab in the UI that will let me change those?
---
I, and my whirlwind axe, salute you druids.  Keep fighting the good fight, and know we're all cheering you on.
---
99% sure they stack, I saw a troll do this in an AV once and it was like he went super saiyan.
---
Still using one as I'm writing this. 5/5.
---
Yah dodge is for bear
---
It alleviates a lot of frustration when trying to level 50-100. The amount of Bruiseweed you encounter early on is taunting.
---
5 days played on warrior is more impressive than world records.
---
This was very well done, but I feel a bit off comparing how much I miss vanilla to Brook's story, even if it hits the mark.  
---
That's just me, though....again, it hit on how I feel and was really well made. 
---
No but I advise u try a bit harder for consumables and ur preraid gear
---
I'll just leave these here :)

Sounds epic af rolling them ignites
---
Most people who played on private servers simply played on them because there was no official option. We won't see anything like Nost again unless Blizzard actually fucks up Classic, which I highly doubt at this point.
---
Maybe BC private servers will appear more and more.
---
Pick one class and stick with it until you’ve got it. Try mage. 
---
thats what you chose as your response....yikes
---
I'm glad you agree. Hope you solve whatever unresloved problem has led you to become so volatile!
---
Is it weird that the thing I'm looking forward to the most in classic, is getting the triprunner dungarees from the gnomer quest?
---
Esc &gt; Keybinds
---
There is more than just spell slot keybinds. Take time to look through it and see what you can “shortcut”
---
Eh, mages are okay but I love Paladins. I realise a pally dps is considered by some to be a waste of a class, but my first ever character was a ret pally and I loved the fuck out of him. Also, class mount.
---
Got it, thanks 
---
I seem to remember most high rank pvp warlocks favored shadow damage for one reason or another.  To the point that the shaman grounding totem, if used at the proper times, could reduce a warlocks overall combat damage by 30% over the course of a fight.
---
Anecdotal, because those numbers came from an acquaintance of mine long ago, but it makes sense that if most warlocks are speced for shadow in pvp situations then countering that would lead to both classes operating at a disadvantage.  The sway being that the class equiping the resist gear knows what is going down beforehand.
---
Im Norwegian, and I stand by your side in this matter. I don't think I could take a Norwegian server mode serious even if I tried.
---
I used to sit at the tables near the bar.  Unless I had an emergency poo or something and had to log in a hurry.
---
Thanks you so much Ill check it out when i get back onto the pc.
---
Eh. You’ll never be good with a ret pally in classic. But if you want to have fun and that is fun to you, go for it. Don’t worry about being good. 
---
Indeed, Classic WoW itself is shit as a game.  Even for its time, it had some horrible design pitfalls, and yet it was still incomparably better than all, or at least most, other MMORPGs out there.  The genre was just THAT stupid back then.  "Glorified chat room" was not an uncommon insult back then.
---
That said, despite being so much better, it still had some downright awful grinds typical of the genre, though thankfully none (except Runecloth for Exalted repuation) were as bad as the grinds in Korean MMOs.  And that's what you're seeing here and there in the game.
---
As for the board, I've noticed people suffer from quite an addiction to their nostalgia, and that's really what you're seeing most of the time.  I've realized that they see Classic WoW as something very different than I do or you do.  It seems similar to how I feel about the relatively early days of Ragnarok Online, my first MMORPG, so I can at least sympathize some.
---
I'm saying this as someone that played all of Classic WoW from March 2005.  I loved it to death at the beginning and still overall because of, once again, how it really blew away all other MMOs, but then I really hated some parts of it.  I probably only saw how bad certain parts of the game were because of extremely stubbornly playing Druid almost the entire time.  So I have a complicated relationship with Classic.  It's a somewhat fascinating subject to me that I keep being interested in even though I know I should let it go.  When Classic of 2019 arrives, I'm looking forward to finally letting go then, in one way or another.  It'll be fun, lol.
---
I haven't played since wrath, but preach gaming's "get good for christmas" series was a pretty good watch at the time.  At least I felt like it made me a better player, and I don't even play the game lol.
---
The basic idea is start small.  There is no reason to change everything about what you are doing.  Just do one thing, let it go for a week, identify the next change, do that for a week ect...
---
Well, I may never be good in the sense that my class and spec wont be the greatest, but I still want to be good in the sense that I'm at least doing my best to play the game like the pros do.
---
Hahah såhär glad 
---
Yeah, the only thing left to do is to stomp the people who post things like "#nochanges, but 5k would be the sweet spot for server caps". 
---
No, it's either no changes or there is changes.
---
gotta go with dun mo man
---
Good job, bringing this up. I'll be playing warrior in Classic as well so I'm also very invested in seeing this work properly.
---
I highly recommend posting this on the official forums as well for more exposure.
---
Livestreamed?
---
They have a working copy of the original 1.12 code, database and assets - why do you think the community will have better knowledge of what is "authentic" than the internal Dev team?
---
They aren't guessing this shit from memory - they (unlike any other private server) actually have a copy of the game you want to play.
---
They reused Arathi and Darkshore recently but its too little, too late im afraid.
---
Defense cap isn't very important for Warriors/Druid because they have the health pool to be able to be crit and crushed without being one shot. Paladins have much smaller health pools than the other two tanking classes. 
---
This!
---
&gt;Shaman can pretty much remove everything the Pally does for his Warrior very quickly
---
Have you ever played this game even?
---
Shaman can only remove poisons and fears(warriors can do that with base skill toolkit either), can't do anything if he is CC'd. Enjoy seeing your buddy being(Sapped/Polymorphed/Slowed/Kited/rooted) and not being able to do anything about it and having no strong means of survival like bubble. Paladin is capable to clean virtually any kind of CC even including saps and rocket helms stuns with Blessing of Sacrifice, not talking about basic stuff like how strong Blessing of Freedom is. 
---
The argument you are trying to make works if you are fighting bad players or both shaman and warrior have r14 or similar level of gear (without any real guarantee of success, paladin can go machine gun mode with Scrolls of blinding light and Mitigate WF burst with BOP), and totem stomp is never really an issue.
---
Quit playing on them when Classic got announced.  Certainly no point now with many projects announcing they will shutdown come classic.
---
As a former vanilla player I want to recreate the feeling of joining a server "naked" and climb up the ladder by questing with strangers... eventually becoming friends with them and perhaps creating or joining a guild afterwards. 
---
It's such a big part of the vanilla journey. Increasing "efficiency" by preparing a guild might bite a thing for many players but sure not for these who want to recreate the vanilla atmosphere from 15 years ago. 
---
With that said, good luck! 😊
---
I just want a date so I can plan my time better, like when to take days off
---
Totally succulent dude.
---
Imagine being this much of an unironic NPC meme in real life that you think pewdiepie was doing anything other than making jokes of which should be protected speech.
---
As for the n-bomb, he said it while playing a shooter and someone killed his teammate. I think it was pubg and he got surprised and said it, then immediately apologized and was just as surprised as the rest of the viewers(most of which probably laughed). My multi-racial group of friends used to refer to each other by MUCH worse and on purpose. I would be banned if I repeated it.
---
It triggers me to no end the level of snowflakedness some people sink to. I don't even care if he meant those comments in a serious manner, if it wasn't an act of aggression I don't care. You can call me ANY slur you want and short of me failing my principles I would say you are well within your right to do so.
---
"Boohoo this guy said a word I don't like, h..he should pay my hospital bills!"

&lt;We Ran Out of Good Names&gt;
---
Low ranked? You realise fury was one of the best FPS specs right?
---
That’s a good point.
---
I actually did for a short time, good times
---
the ironic thing is can you guess which identitarian group benefitted the most from the media smearing pewdiepie?
---
Didn't really heal that much until now (bwl), mostly tanking and dps but i expect it to change on a few healer intensive fight later. 
---
Sure macros can help but the fact that you say you are a mouse clicker is most likely the biggest reason you "attack slow" and cant keep up with rotations or loosing aggro etc. Take your time with setting up keybinds and spend the hours needed to get used to it.
---
Unless you start there I dont see you going any places in terms of getting better and more competetive (if you want to) be that in pvp or end game pve.
---

Or ya know they give us entertainment / valuable knowledge / content we want, and we have this amazing oppurtunity to directly support the content we want to see created and to continue being made, which we can ensure by givnig what we deem to be fair compensation for the labour utilized to produce said content. Like damn fam not everything has to be about your weird feitsization pertaining to a nerds apperant desperate grasps for social relationships.. projecting your insecurities much?
---
P.s. this isnt coming from someone who has sub/donated to steamers before (besides twitch prime) but someone who has a basic grasp on economics of pertaining to the service era with a basic moral code for the fair compensation of labour.
---
Wow thanks for the detailed reply that is very informative.  Question on 4Horseman ... I have heard that you can get away with a bear tank but it just introduces a bit of RNG on taunt resist so it isnt optimal if you have 8 warriors available instead?
---
Do they have a list of everything that needs to be checked?  
---
Just because they have the reference client doesn't mean they're going to be perfectly thorough in comparing and checking everything. A large crowd-sourced player base might come along and say "hey you guys should take a look at this because you may have overlooked it in your reference checks"  
---
Me and an in-game friend tested this, he did mostly dungeons and I quested, this was done at lvl 20+. We played about the same amount of time and are both experienced vanilla players. I managed to reach lvl 30 while he was still level 28, I was lvl 40 when he was lvl 35. We discussed why my questing was so much faster and the conclusion was that even though he was a experienced player, the group for dungeons would usually wipe atleast one time and you usually have some one that needs to take a small break (remember most of the dungeons took a couple of hours to complete in vanilla). Another interesting thing was about gear, yes he got better gear but not a huge difference, because there are quests that gives as good gear as dungeons or even better some times. But in my opinion if you never played vanilla do the dungeons for fun and get some friends, wipe and have a good time, and in some cases where you don't know exactly what quests to do and which route to take, the dungeons can be even better than questing. But in my personal opinion don't do dungeons between level 20-40 just for the gear because it's not worth the time it consumes when you have to form a group, run to the dungeon, complete the whole thing and then get back to your questing location.
---
In PvE, as a DPS I never have any problems taking aggro from the tank or screwing my healer over by agroing mobs. I know when to back off, and I know most boss fights by heart. I just suck absolute cock at PvP. The only thing in PvE or just in general is optimizing my spec. I used to be a transvestite, wearing tank or healer gear as a DPS because all I cared about when choosing armor was that it had better stats than what I was currently wearing. 
---
If you enjoy playing vanilla it’s not really a waste of time. 
---
I'll be soloing onyxia before you know it.
---
fair enough but no matter your arguement, you have to see through the fact that getting used to keybinds will improve you every area of the game, especially pvp.
---
downvoted cuz you are trying to make us play less classic 
---
Topkek
---
Strongly agreed. I’d add in, if you’re not trying to power to 60 to raid ASAP, I’d highly recommend finding groups for dungeons and elite quests. Vanilla wow is a lot more fun with the social element that you can easily lose if you’re just solo leveling 
---
The Vanilla grinding was social, meaningful, and dangerous: both because the mobs can actually hurt you AND because, at least in the open world, even blade of grass is contested ground.
---
Yep, playing Feral Druid ended up making much of Classic WoW plain hell for me back then, but this time I'll be trying it once again just to see if it was really that bad.
---
It'll probably be fun!  Or I'm just that foolish.  I'll see.
---
Since you missed my answer, I will repeat it: nobody knows.
---
Technically we do have changes
---
Yeah, I was just told early on that macros were what I was supposed to be using, but now I'm learning that keybinding is more important. Macros I cant get to work, but keybinding spells and attacks to keys that I dont have to move my hand to use are more important than trying to get a macro to do your whole rotation for you.
---
This picture will be in a museum some day
---
&gt; Like any class, the class quests for druid are epic and the rewards feel epic. I haven't experienced all the classes in vanilla, but I can tell you for sure that it's a hell of a lot more immersive than mages (and, I would say it beats hunters too). Warlocks are comparable as far as immersive class quest experiences go. It's one of the best parts of being a druid, travelling the world and conquering memorable foes to learning your various shapeshifting forms.
---
When talking about how epic Vanilla class quests were, everyone talks about Druids and Warlocks. Good for me, the only 2 classes I really play.
---
&gt;The desire to get a mount is mitigated quite a lot by being able to zoom around in travel form before anyone else. Especially in Warsong Gulch, where it, and feline swiftness, make you loved by your team mates and feared by your opponents.
---
Level 39 WSG twinking
---
Yes they are normally in the top half of popular classes corrected for faction restriction.
---
depends on which will increase your income, mount if you herb/mine or gear if you grind. (but even then mount overall might make a bigger difference over the 1k gold helm, maybe even devi too)
---
Also mongoose bite, but you had to dodge an attack to use it. 
---
&gt;they will all be high pop at launch
---
some of them being Full pop. That's where everyone will roll. Queues forever.
---
I dont know about macros doing the entire rotation for you. But in general good macros can sure turn the tide of a fight and be a big qol improvement. But for me, those macros wont do you any good if u gonna spend time moving the mouse and clicking them so focus on keybinds first is my suggestion and then develop from there on :)
---
The part about rolling a new character trying to capture that old feeling... That hit home. That's the cycle for me play my main for a while have brief enjoyment of the current game that quickly subsides. Think to myself "but I have so many find memories of this game I can't quit. Maybe I need a change" start an alt enjoy the old world for a while but then while leveling I think to myself. What happens when this character is max level. What am I working towards? What is the point? I then quit wait a few months rinse and repeat. 
---
Imagine running ur own little cult boosting you
---
holy nova dm E when released
---
Cool! Me too. Also shapeshifting for Druids, Death Knight presences (those are still a thing, right?), Hunter aspects, Mage and Warlock armors and probably some others too.
---
What is Joannas record? 4d 20h? Or has he improved it?
---
Just to get it into perspective, regardless if this guide is very accurate;
---
3 days 9 hours worth of /played would be the equivalent of playing at least 6 hours per day for ~14 days straight. Give or take 2 full weeks of 6 hours every day. Granted, most people are a 9-5 jobbers and if you couple that with family, kids, taking care of your own shit etc... You can easily drop down to 1-2 hours maximum per day worth of playtime. So if you can only spend ~2 hours per day, it would take you about 40 real days IRL, playing every day, to complete the guide.
---
This is all rough estimations based on this guide but still.
---
Ikr the fanbases tend to be worse than the icon
---
It's super useful while leveling to save yourself from death If you pull too much 
---
if you grind mobs without questing you should get at least 600 bare minimum from leveling up.
---
I’m sold
---
It was absolutely in Classic, probably from day one or at least 1.4, whenever I started.  I'm almost completely sure it was just pure lag, meaning if there was a lag spike when you looted, the client and server didn't resolve for a very long time.
---
I don't think this'll happen again because this won't be the original client, and the servers won't be lagging nearly as badly as back then.
---
Raid leaders need warm bodies. Filling a 40 man and even a 20 on a weekday is the hardest challenge any raid leader faced. You'll be fine rolling anything you want 
---
I don't want to play on whatever server is out there when i can simply wait for classic. I really don't see the point in playing right now, it's like eating a bag of candy before going out to a great restaurant - sure it feels good now, but you're gonna be less hungry later.
---

I think some sort of BETA or test client should be rolled out prior to launch so we could actually see how this low-level sharding would work, the amount of performance we'd get with thousands of people on the same realm and in general further testing of authentic systems restored.
---
Tauren for ur only hard CC
---
It's useful 1-60 if you want to reduce damage from most mobs because they have much faster swing timers. It's pretty easy to learn how to do it without aggroing other mobs, especially with the camera extra zoomed out. What else are you going to do while you wait 3.6 seconds in between auto-attacks?

Clever

You've never played Classic and you're worried that doing dungeons will take time away from your pre-raid BiS grind?
---
Dude, you are going at this from the wrong angle. Let me just tell you, if you think the best part of Classic is the pre-raid BiS and endgame raiding you're gonna be dissapointed.
---
I know this is a modern thing to do, but i very very very strongly suggest you just chill out and take your time and do dungeons. If you haven't played Classic you don't know what you're missing.
---
I’ve been wondering the same thing.  Not sure what I want to spec into endgame but for leveling Im going to ele/enhance and I leveled a Troll shaman a little bit on a pserver.  Honestly does minmaxing for shaman matter that much?  Maybe I’ll start an Orc shaman Nd a Tauren shaman too just to compare at least leveling.  But it strikes me as largely an aesthetic choice.  Correct me if I’m wrong.  
---
Orc cuz stuns are the nr1 problem.. or even Tauren to cover the shaman weakness of having shit cc
---
Troll sucks in pvp
---
But really unless u wanna try real hard it doesnt really matter
---
Just read your edit now.  
---
It's not possible to fix this with any addon. Asmongold and Mcconnel made a big deal about it and had people try to see if it was possible but it wasnt. Something to do with the cvar limitations.  
---
And no, it's not just about the scrolling combat text or the font. It's the way that it's animated on the screen, i.e crits, wether it's white or yellow, are sticking on the screen for a prolonged period of time whereas in retail / on the demo, a crit would just feel insignificant and fade out instantly just like every other numbers and white hits, in a multiple hit scenario, are filtered out.  
---
It's just such a dull experience.  
---
I use scrolling combat text addons as well but i always keep my dmg numbers intact.
---
Yes but it's not like the game is going anywhere. Leveling on a p.server and starting all over again with your characters gone in a few months sounds like a burn out and a waste of time.
---
mages have more than 3 pvp specs but those are the big 3.
---
I agree with you on this, and I honestly think it could have been fixed differently, if they wanted to prevent poison swapping.  
---
They could have just made poison disappear if the weapon is unequipped, just like it works in retail.  
---
This way you cannot prepare weapons with different poisons, and the issue is solved.  
---
From a class-fantasy perspective, though, poison swapping makes perfect sense, an assassin would go prepared for any eventuality.

What is Presence of Mind? All that’s coming to mind is the mage ability

Playing the druid was the most goddamn fun I've had during my time in WoW, but I only started playing shortly before TBC. Say what you will about TBC, but the changes that were made to some classes were absolutely excellent and I feel that the druid got the best of it. Restoration was a lot of fun (For some reason, I enjoyed keeping everyone's HoTs going and Lifeblooming the tanks during my raiding years) and the fact that you got  your various travelforms for free/earlier than other classes meant that moving around was a lot less painful.
---
Anyway, I have no idea how the druid played at lvl 60 without TBCs changes and Im not sure I'll pick the class again.
---
Dungeons are overall nice and the gear upgrades you get from them are fairly meaningful and fulfilling as long as you're in the same level bracket. Even more so if you go in underleveled and get carried, even if you just pick up the quest reward stuff.
---
The only 'issue' or hard fact with classic dungeons is how long they could take. 1-2 stupid wipes is enough to delay you by quite a lot of minutes. Take into account graveyard distance, running time, potential re-spawned trash, random hunter pet pulls, amount of mana regeneration (drinking) etc...
---
If your group is good and knows the dungeon/encounters, it should be fairly straight forward. I myself have forgotten quite a lot of the dungeons so I'm sure I'll fuck up many times, even though I've done them hundreds of times.
---
It doesn't help that Cataclysm changed a lot of the old dungeon layouts too. But to answer your question: maybe pug a dungeon or two at the start.  Then when you form a nice little group of friends, just try gathering together often and running a dungeon appropriate for your levels. Less chance of ninjas, more fun/banter, and you can carry each other this way.
---
Goddamn this gets me so excited. I can't wait to run SM for that full scarlet set, and then RFD for the glorious Icemetal Barbute!

You have to play wow everyday.
---
Quest rewards are not comparable for warriors and other melee leveling. They are usable and you will still progress, but having a dungeon drop or quest reward will be hugely beneficial for leveling speed. 
---
Warrior whirlwind weapon is not something you can complete without higher level help and/or a full group in early 30s. The elements in arathi level range starts from 37ish. And the boss to kill is 43 elite. 
---
AV quest pole arm will not be available when leveling either, unless you are months behind everyone else, or it’s an alt. 
---
people will always play on them 
---
The mageroyal level sucked for me
---
Its like miners getting stuck at silver
---
that was like 2005, that clock was garbage at that time
---
Definitely warrior offtank. You realistically need 2-3 tanks, and while one is the main, the second will have situations it is important to generate threat. Not even nights when the MT can’t make it, non tauntable bosses requiring two tanks, the offtanks threat generation is hugely important 
---
Yeah just cuz u went minmax doesnt u will magically end up raiding ktz
---
Actually if u watch old naxx videos u see plenty non optimal combos
---
They are worth it because they are fun. Combine the run with a bunch of quests related to that dungeon and you'll get a lot of worth from it.
---
what if there will be a beta and you wont be chosen to participate?
---
Unless you actually enjoy playing the game and leveling &lt;.&lt;
---
I see you pic is now used in /r/boomer too!
---
vanilla pvp is a lot more fun and a lot easier than wrath or cata imo no damn resilience gear to deal with
---
I'm not gonna enjoy it when I know all my progress is gonna be deleted though
---
Feral Druid tanks lol 
---
I have played Vanilla for 4 years and never lost a character. I can still play on my Nost characters today even after a shutdown and muteny.
---
Anyway, when Classic is released I am looking forward to retire them forever ;)
---
I have never owned a cat, but mine seems to always get out at the worst time.
---
everything is viable, I think you would find better responses for class tank viability/optimal.
---
I'm not streaming until Classic launches, Blizz is ban crazy atm - even Joana got a strike for replaying legitimate Vanilla footage.
---
Fair enough, I guess it’s just a matter of opinion then. I’ve enjoyed leveling on half a dozen vanilla servers even though I knew the server will end up shutting down/becoming obsolete inevitably in the future. 
---
I mean, it doesnt remove the counter-playability it just makes it more difficult and more anticipation/reaction based. Instead of having 200ms, you have 10ms. Its more about outsmarting your opponent as opposed to to just mashing vanish when your addon screams DEATHCOIL at you...
---
This is just wrong! I wanted first to say you are painting a very black and white picture of a gray situation, but you are straight up spreading misinformation! Druid is not only viable but it is a top dps class, IF played right and you are using the Pummeler from Gnomeregan.
---
If you decide yo play fereal expect to meet uneducated people like this and you may need to explain this for every pug you try to enter. 
---
It's hard to imagine they would go the extra mile with spell-batching, 1.10 itemisation and all the other little authenticity details and skip over the debuff limitation change in the AQ patch. It's probably the most easy to implement feature of all to create an authentic experience.
---
Why would they be easier?  Also tbh leveling a warrior wasnt that bad in vanilla as long as you lived by the mantras of 1. I shall never fight more than 1 mob at a time unless I am in a group or retaliation is up and 2. I will always have food and/or bandages on me at all times.  Sure it is a bit slower overall and some areas (like just pre-30) is particularly slow but you make it to max level eventually all the same.
---
Please take this in the spirit it is intended - I absolutely salute your dedication to mapping Varrak's route; I realise it's a lot of work. To me, Varrak's run was outstanding in its own right.  
---
BUT: His route will not translate well to Classic. I know when I changed from pserver old values to corrected vanilla ones, I literally had to throw out my times, routes and notes because it just didn't work. I am speaking from experience here over a lot of hours; we don't know exactly how Classic values will pan out, but it definitely won't inherit the issues pservers have thanks to using BC 2.3 data.
---
A small part of me thinks they'll announce the actual release date on April Fools.
---
Aye Im the healer. The warrior is set on my friend. Wf is so fun. On the other hand paladin got such a strong defensive toolkit. Oh the choices. :-)
---
I never got the "read the quest" thing. There are some rich in lore quest chains like discovering Onyxia scheme but most of the quests are generic. Also, you can count of people like Nobbel to tell you the best stories like Defias.
---
This is just the thing i was looking for! I thank you! 
---
I forgot where u get these from but I remember having so many of them. Like 15 of em I think every time I bought sub from physical store this came in the box also

Some classic advocates oppose tbc servers, believing it will pull away too many players from classic. Not saying it's a good or bad argument, but that's the most common sentiment
---
A 40 man raid want 15% palas and 20% shamans so dont worry about raiding (if you are healing).

Hell yeah. The ultimate troll. I'm ready for the chaos on this forum when it happens.

Your nost character is on a server with 20 pop though. Lightbringer is dead. The fresh realms always kill previous ones.
---
This. It would be hilariously Meta if they said they are releasing within a relatively short period of time, say 4 weeks, and just said nothing else.
---
Nothing finds problems quicker than having thousands of people try the product. There's just really no good substitute.

If the server is on board with it, setting up a lfg channel isn’t hard. Private Channels can be made and globally used on the server. If you can spam forums or general chat enough, having a global lfg channel is definitely possible 
---
Dire Maul is not available at the start. 
---
1.10 items won't be available at the start.
---
It would make all the sense to also don't have 16 slots at the start for authenticity.
---
Sounds like I would fit in

When classic comes out, I will probably quit my job.
---
so youre the guy who started the kurzen compound
---
Short answer, yes!
---
Slightly longer answer...
---
Of course they are worth it.  It's a GAME.  If you're just trying to hit 60 as fast as possible, then go grind mobs or follow one of the well-respected speed leveling guides.  If you're trying to enjoy the game, take a few months to get to 60, see the world, do quests, do dungeons, play in groups with other players, and actually have fun.  The game post-vanilla (or at least post-WotLK) morphed into something so unlike the original idea.  It became about getting to level cap so you could start playing the actual game.  That game is not vanilla wow.  90% of vanilla wow is in the pre-60 content.  I say this as someone who loves raiding and plans to raid in classic.
---
So if you are playing the game to be maximally efficient and just rush to end-game to try to be the first person to get a certain piece of gear, skip the dungeons.  I realize that a very small proportion of the overall player base does prefer to play this way.  More power to you.  If you are playing the game to enjoy just that...the game...do every damn dungeon there is, get a bunch of scrubs together and try to kill hogger when you're 3 levels too low, do random quests that take you out into the middle of nowhere.  Because that is why you have so many people on this subreddit and so many other forums with such deep nostalgia and fondness for this game.  And I'd take any chance I could get to experience that for the first time.
---
Because Classic won’t have bots or drama. 
---
They are casual players, in casual friendly guilds. And at least in this sub, it's actually a majority.
---
A computer desk next to a computer desk - forward thinking.
---
“We’re budding paladins and shamans for classic”
---
Not really. I think only Uldaman is worth doing if you can find a competent group. But Ulda is a very tough dungeon and it’s very risky going in there. It might cost you hours. I don’t recommend to do any dungeons if you’re going for fast leveling. 
---
I’ve been speculating this for a couple of weeks now. I feel like they’ll give us a release date but not confirm it wasn’t a joke for at least a week.
---
No, let them do internal beta testing with people who actually know how things are supposed to be. There’s no point in flooding the devs with thousands of bug report from people who played nost for a while and think everything there was accurate. 
---
I hope that this system gets used by Semi-Progress Raids or Progress Raids in Classic.
---
This loot-drama with DKP hoarding yikes, not for me. People never get semi upgrades, because they just hoard DKP for that one Item. It's not what a Teamplayer should do.
---
For sure, public beta will deminish the experience, the release specifically.
---
Sounds a lot better then the usual DKP systems. I would be okay-ish with that.
---
people roleplay
---
its easier to roleplay a human than it is a green skinned orc
---
I feel much better getting some blues while leveling so I do dungeons even if it may not be worth the time
---
Then getting the cheapest enchants that give weapons glows like +2 beastslaying
---
Buy acc with access or watch reddit/forums/livestreams for information
---
It should be an improvement. Subscription = fewer bots, and blizzard in charge = less admin drama
---
It never does. Healers tend to skip minor upgrades for the BWL trinkets. It's so annoying.
---
Now certainly ... in original vanilla ... not so much.  Mechanics for threat/talent reworks had to happen to make fury not trash and then it had to catch on to become mainstream.  Add in the fact you didn't have that many warriors to begin with so your option is have a necessary tank or a leet dps fury warrior and you go with the tank.  Compound that with OTs preferring to be arms/prot so they could still PvP well when not raiding 3-5 nights a week and you get an overall of very few fury warriors existing in vanilla.
---
Note:  I do remember pretty early on most likely after the fury talent rework when one of our guildies was obsessed with fury.  He apparently did pretty good dps although I dont remember the meters.  Only remember it because he face planted ... a lot ... by pulling threat off the tanks.
---
dunno
---
I wouldn't mind if they left in the ability to rearrange your characters in the character selection screen.
---
I like having my main on top of the list, and if I ever change my main it would bug me to no end.
---
If you are worried about min-max, troll for PvE hands down, and they all have benefits in PvP, though most people say the stun resist on Orcs makes them best.
---
Tbh though, unless you are gunning for rank 14 AND need that little extra boost, pick the one that looks the coolest...which is clearly troll.

The joke will be: they announce the date, everybody thinks it‘s a joke, but it‘s actually no joke 😄
---
Myeah u just cant play alts anymore
---
I agree 
---
they better give people that have paid for subscriptions in vanilla access
---
I wish I could upvote more. That series goes through all the what's, the why's, and the how's. All of it is applicable to classic too afaik - so don't let anyone knock it for being a retail-filmed series
---
I hope not, at least not at first.

take your time and dont race to 60...read the quests he says!!

as he zergs by you in levels and gets to all the black lotus and rich thorium ahead of the pack.

My druid is at like roughly 750 in game days played, quit during wrath, mostly played in vanilla literally no lifed the game from day 1 to mid tbc so probably most of my days were spent in vanilla.

I used to smoke a lot of weed that i had to buy illegally.

Now i can buy it legally down the road with my credit card.

I used to play a lot of private servers because wow classic wasnt available.

Now i can buy it legally from and pay with my CC for a finer more tuned product with no gm corruption and a way of dealing with toxic shitheads.

For me, it's gotta be Mulgore. Open plains, easy access to Thunder Bluff, only other Tauren around and Crossroads is right next to your first HS
---
I casually level a mage on one server but plan on quitting when we get a release-date yea.
---
Also the servers are full of bots and overpopulated in general.
---
They'll almost certainly be in there for European regions, and that means they are likely to be enabled in other realms too, but that's just a guess on my part.
---
Yeah, screw those crazy foreigners and their weird languages, right? 
---
Shouldn't have been running around and shouting "BLIZZARD IS MY GOT I LOVE CASH SHOP BECAUSE BLIZZARD I LOVE WORLD QUESTS BECAUSE BLIZZARD I HATE MOBA BUT MOVE HOTS BECAUSE BLIZZARD"
---
Now, once you've scared the sane away, you're left with no choice.
---
so many words, such little substance 
---
I honestly don't think they'd even *joke* about a release date at this point, the backlash would be tremendous, even if it was from a bunch of oblivious idiots. 
---
aah well, was the same when TBC was new... and when WotLK was new... and Cataclysm...
---
So I've been playing on a popular server-group for about a year now. A decently geared mage on one server, and a ~50s druid recently converted to resto... 
---
That latter toon has *really* taken a long time to level. I reckon by the release date of Classic, that toon will be nearly a year old. So it's honestly safe to say I don't play it much, at all.
---
I just don't have the motivation to invest in a character i *know* is going to be abandoned and left to rot, in just a few months... I enjoy the game, so I still spend a couple hours with my characters a couple times per month. I already can't play my sweet 60 mage because that version of the game is dead, so why would i push my druid to the same state?
---
TLDR: I'll play private servers every now and then, a few times a month. But, because I know Classic is right around the corner, I don't feel obligated to be building up my character.
---
Nah you‘re not the only one. I‘ve seen this mentioned in several posts in the last few days. And I hope you‘re all wrong. Don’t play with my feelings. 
---
Idk y ur getting downvoted, seems like a solid response, I honestly dont know alot about the speedrunning community, and yeah I'm excited to see who gets world first goo

Still highly recommended :)

The Blizzard-activision-apologist-dual-spec-wanting-sharding-loving-pliz-change-this-CUCKs hate us, but we are needed if classic is to turn out true to its origin. For we are the shield that protects the realms of men; The watchers on the wall.

You didn't really read what I wrote and are making a strawman argument.

i played during vanilla, got to 56 before i stopped playing due to school (wich i regret doing , i was so close to 60) and went trough a fair bit of guild drama, then played again during the last legs of TBC and then WOTLK

wich guild were you in?
---
I'm using a Razer Taipan, it's pretty much a regular-ass wired mouse that happens to have 2 buttons on the side, where the thumb would rest, left *or* right handed.

It was about 50 bucks. On one hand, you can get almost any mouse that has 2 side buttons for keybinds, and some will be cheaper, but I can say that this one has been pretty reliable compared to most others ive used.

they are not adding rp-pvp servers? that would be such a mistake,those servers are the most community driven servers even to this day

---
Razer and Corsair make similar mouses but as far as I know neither of them have the ring finger click that the G600 does, it's just so damn good for push to talk.
---
They will just announce global sharding and introduce LFR for Classic.
---
Doesn't make a world of difference mate, of course they're going to be in classic. 
---
100%. I don't think a release date is best before the beta is even announced, or even *confirmed* yet.
---
I know Blizzard has come a *long* way since the demo, but I would hate to finally get the launched game in July, and have it full of (slightly) aggravating issues that aren't working right.
---
I was in a similar boat, i dont talk to those negative people anymore, even if i have been gaming with them for 5+ years. There will be plenty of opportunity to find new people to play with.
---
I mean, you can't make asian characters, so it's not like anything goes. It's pretty arbitrary what they allow and what they don't. Even many European languages will have characters that clearly aren't allowed.
---
Are you suggesting that characters from every language should be allowed?
---
I already have quit, whats the point of continuing on them aside from keeping contact with certain people... (who i have on discord now).
---
I'm beating a dead horse here, but please do read what I'm saying. It's fun.
---
Whats the whole point of playing at 60 and getting good gear... to make yourself stronger and to play harder parts of the game right? The same thing is true when you're leveling. Dungeons are difficult, rewarding, and *engaging*. 
---
You say you haven't played Classic, but if you've played even BC, than you know what to expect for dungeon difficulty. However, Wrath and onward, dungeons have been twisted into xp/currency farming operations that have little to no engaging elements. This means you never talk to your group, never clench your butthole in fear of dying, and never have an interesting experience.
---
If you're honestly trying to be the top 1% of people, than, no... skip every dungeon on your way to 60. But if you are comfortable being in the other 99%, than take a minute and enjoy your trip to 60. If you skip every 1-59 dungeon, than you miss ALOT of the game's content.
---
Can’t speak for everyone, but I feel more immersed in my character by reading why I kill X and Y, making it less mundane.
---
A Speedruner, reaches lvl 60 in 80 hours, while playing hunter and knowing literally anything he needed to know.
---
What the fuuuck, this is far longer that I ever expected. 
---
Looking through my steam game time make me realize how long this is. I have like 100hours in For Honor. So, if I invested as much as I did in For Honor, I could be like lvl 45-50. 
---
Daaaaaamn
---
"And yes this isn't reflective exactly of classic wow, when classic launches this will be revised for any differences."
---
I'm just not sure what else I can really say other than that. What extra information are you trying to convey that isn't addressed by that? Do you want to add your notes to the guide? It's a wiki feel free to contribute.
---
The blues are quite handy when levelling. It might not be fastest but it does make things easier, which is important because in vanilla you can actually die and have a tough time in some places while levelling. 
---
There should not be any phasing in Classic as they only started to use phasing for storytelling in Wrath. Phasing is the system where the world changes for each player individually based on quest progess. i.e. you do a quest in which you destroy a tower, on your screen the tower is in ruins and you take a screenshot standing looking at the ruined tower. Then your buddy who didn't do that quest yet makes a screenshot standing on exact the same spot as you are standing. For him the tower is not ruined, but still standing in all its glory. 
---
Joana has a very big fanbase, if you look at this and other threads they instantly downvote any comment that challenges him lol. But hey, best of luck to Joana on getting world first. I know I will be following his guide myself

Basically pet scaling + rework on pet survivability to boss AoEs and mend pet not being channeled made BM top tier DPS in TBC (happened pretty early on).
---
My native language is one that contains åäö. I do not want characters like that in names. It looks retarded.
---
You are totally right on this. A lot of the people that first came to WoW were coming off of a different generation of games. EverQuest, Anarchy Online, Ultima Online, EVE, and Dark Age of Camelot ruled the scene at the time. All of those games tended to be more hard core and very challenging to play. 
---
Compare that to nowadays where it’s less about the experience that the community itself generated and more about creating the experience for us. It’s not that newer players are bad as much as that they have different expectations than the new players to WoW back on release. 
---
Honestly the biggest hurdle that we’ll have to overcome as a community will be in shaking off the mindset that many of us have from playing either on Retail or other modern titles. If we don’t get sharding then it’ll help a lot. Part of what drew us together as a community was that you got to know the people on your server once you hit 60. At least you’d see people and guild names regularly enough to recognize them. 
---
Yes, actually.
---
They're using a backed up database from the time where the changes did not exist. They would literally have to go and write the code to change this FROM the way it worked in Vanilla and then implant it into classic.
---
Ergo; not going to happen.
---
The aspect of having fun. 
---
Guess you could argue that you would be able to skip a zone that you deem unworthy of your time as well.
---
I love your comment and agree entirely. I worry that people who have played WoW post-Wrath have no idea about what the majority of the game entails, and that some may be expecting a game more similar to what they have experienced. 
---
Cata and onwards, any 80-85, 85-90, 90-100, 100-110 experience is just so damn forgettable. Meanwhile, in Classic, I can still remember some dungeon runs from 2005 where I either saved the group, or acted like a dumbass and almost wiped the group.
---
See and this is what I don't quite get. MC and BWL are a TOTAL JOKE. 8 or 16 Debuff slots don't even matter AT ALL. They simply don't.  And in AQ and Naxx we had the full debuffs so ultimately it is quite the original experienc.e It doesn't make MC or BWL that much easier or not because those raids are simple. With players nowadays, once they have been reminded what tactics to use, they will be a breeze. MC - realistically - was tuned to have like 10-15 people knowing what they were doing while the rest could sit idle with auto attacks.... BWL tuned that number up to 20-25 but also no more than that...
---
Are you sure, I thought they were working backwards?
---
It can also create other issues though, like groups of friends getting split between "Blackrock 1,2 and 3 and not being able to play with eachother up untill the realms are merged. It also doesn't the solve the problem where you don't get to know players while playing. If i'm on blackrock 1 and someone else is on Blackrock 2 we can't meet or play together untill the proposed merge. but generally you wan't to avoid merges like that, as "Blackrock 1" will have their own little community and "Blackrock 2" will also have their own little community and the community of "Blackrock 3" will be different again. I actually don't see this "Static sharding" as a solution at all as it doesn't solve the biggest issues, and possibly even makes bigger gaps between communities. 
---
I am just curious, but how is it hella useful? How will you apply the information?
---
Would have totally used the sh\*t out if it; if i would have known about this...
---
be honest man, nobody who can only play 1 or 2 hours a day is gonna sub to wow
---
Just as a side note to this... Leveling in Classic is part of building your character, rather than your character starting *at* max level. 
---
1-60 in Vanilla takes five times as long as 60-70 did. Ten times as long as 70-80, Twenty times 80-85, and so on. 
---
If you haven't played any expansion close to Vanilla, i strongly suggest you don't worry about the endgame. For almost a year, the endgame is going to consist of a fun, but pretty boring 10 boss raid, and then the 1 encounter Onyxia raid. If you miss out on the opportunities to play with other people because you wanted to grind those 6,000 basalisks instead, then you have every right to do that. But you're missing out on so much of the game if you solely tie your enjoyment to your leveling speed, and whether or not you were there for 3 extra lockouts of MC.
---
If you don't like to heal, don't pick druid. Yes you can play feral with some nice gear, yes you can play balance and juke people in world pvp but to get there you will have to play resto. Same thing if you're planning on ranking past rank 10, no premade is going to invite you if you're not a flag carrier. And to answer your question, you don't NEED to raid. If you get rank 10 gear with tier 1 belt and bracers (you get them from AH) and warden staff/unstoppable force is enough to hold your own against everyone until Naxxramas comes out.
---
If a guild sees themselves as individuals and not a communal effort, personal feelings will conflict with "maximizing guild performance". Every system has tradeoffs, with LC prioritizing guild performance while stuff like suicide kings prioritizes "all participants have a similar chance", dkp prioritizes pro-guild actions, etc. You can't have it all
---
From a post a good while ago, they said that classic was only available because they found of it on a hard drive or something. Now one would assume they are just using that and trying to get it integrated correctly with Battle.net
---
The otherside of the coin is, that they take the earliest Battle.net integrated system and as you said work backwards - If that's the case then yes you are right I guess it could happen.
---
cool
---
Earliest running build at hand is a good point, If its too tough to recreate AV we can just skip that part of the Classic Experience, many of us looked forward to getting to see the multi-day long AVs, which they managed to fix by 1.12. But we don't exactly want to wait longer for Classic :P
---
I feel thats a bad arguement. If ppl have the choice between Classic Vanilla and Classic TBC and they choose TBC than thats probably because they either prefer TBC or want to advance the story maybe even up to Wrath or even later expansion to "relive" the whole experience. I think its quite logical that out of all the players that like earlier versions or WoW more than current versions that there will always be a group that prefers Vanilla, while other will prefer the TBC era or the Wrath Era, and while i've never heard any mention Cataclysm as the best WoW era, for example MoP has certainly come up  as being dubbed the best WoW version by quite a lot of players. 
---
All addons will have to be remade and/or ported to a Classic version. The old addons will not work.
---
Yeh I remember it being about that price but I've only been able to find sites that tell me it's 25g each at top tiers.  So I don't know for sure what was the case in vanilla:/
---
Druid was not affected in 1.x. But since 2.x it did as they tied to there weapon in feral form.  
---
Video Unavailable, even if I remove the "o" from "como". But yea "2uSD-10G" does sound like "2 US Dollars for 10 Gold", a bot might mistake that
---
You are correct, the guy is confused about how it's being done. 
---
I'm noticing more and more that the concept of "social" in this subreddit consists in making others life miserable. Interesting.
---
Jokes aside, that's an aspect of the game I don't like and I will play on a pve server,as said in the thread. 
---
I just got to hear the awesome interview yesterday, so I am a little late for this discussion. Can someone please answer me the following:
---
- on what patch was mute playing the rogues and recording the videos?
---
- will this type of (op) gameplay be possible in classic/1.12 ?
---
- when were rogues nerfed and how (during classic)
---
I am sure this has been answered a million times, but I would be thankful if someone is willing to sum it up for me once more!
---
Elitism will be rampant though.
---
That must be from WotLK. Original Vanilla never had DVDs neither did it have 10M Subs.
---
In vanilla pretty much all the best gear was reserved for the top tier raiding guilds ...  Even for PvP the best gear wasn't from becoming GM/HW but from AQ40/Naxx.  So you could play as many hours as you wanted but unless you had 39+ others that let you join them you were always going to be 2nd class at best.  
---
In TBC they actually narrowed it because if you wore full PvE gear you had great DPS but were basically a glass cannon.  Even with access to the best PvE gear for every slot I still wore a mix of arena PvP gear because it was worth the trade off.  Full PvP arena gear wasnt too bad either but a mix turned out to be the best for me (hunter).
---
It doesnt have a vanish mechanic like it's in modern game. You can only use it out of combat.
---
Yes and the same with will happen in Classic. Or what do you think will happen after Naxx?
---
I'm torn between 4 classes, this helps me to visualize the population of the classes. It doesn't play a big role in me deciding a class, but i'd rather play a class that isn't 30% of the playerbase (warrior or rogue).
---
I'm not really minmaxing anything. And i think you're right. But its always healthy to get a second opinion 
---
No, you can play whatever you want. Humans are just for 1% tryhard that will bring all world buffs, consumes etc. 5 weapon skill is pretty good.
---
Fair enough. Hope you will end up a rogue.
---
Thanks for the input 
---
As a rule of thumb, if you have most of the quests for a dungeon and can find a good group for it, it's comparable if not better xp than questing/grinding. Basically try to collect dungeon quests if you have space in your quest log and if an opportunity arises then go for it! Don't bother doing them over and over once you've finished the quests though.
---
I would say depends on the guild. Alliance is easier with salvation, horde is harder because you need to have good tanks who can hold threat. Horde is more fun to play as a warrior though.
---
they both look evil to me
---
BiS for warrior in pve and pvp.
---
Failed picks take up time which could be what that person meant.
---
A beta test would be nice, but ultimately its Blizzard that has the only authentic source as its stands now. By biggest fear from a beta is that a lot of ppl are going "snowball" Blizzard with reports of how stuff is different from their pserver experience and that Blizzard needs to check that. Eating up valuable dev time checking pserver mistakes instead of focussing on Classic. Just how quite a few things of the stuff reported in the Demo were pserver mistakes. 
---
Exaclty. I often wonder why people want to rush through it. I genuinely have trouble understanding it. Rush to 60, rush to pre-raid BiS, for what? So you can spam shadowbolt endlessly for 3 hours a night 2 days a week? It really confuses me.
---
Especially since only MC and Onyxia will be out at the start. It's just so pointless to rush through that, it's not like you can go through all the raids.
---
I think it's because in retail WoW it's all about raiding, so people who never played vanilla take on that mindset and fail to understand what made vanilla great. 
---
r/wowcirclejerk
---
I remember discussions about WotF and Escape Artist being batshit good in pvp back in vanilla times. So there certainly was *some* of it.
---
Mages had specific evocation staffs and wands with lots of spirit and used those when evocating.
---
&gt; Ah, to be young again.
---
Thank you sir! I have almost 2 years left until 40 ;)

---
&gt; Dailies were terrible in TBC. Thats why I pretty much never did them.
---
Myself, I don't even remember where they were.
---
&gt; would do a few outside Sunwell
---
oh hell don't even talk about this island
---
They don't become a grind until end-game, when you need specific items to boost your characters stats.
---
You may find black rock spire to be repetitive for example.
---
While leveling, dungeons are usually worth it, however I'd suggest you have every quest available for the dungeon before you do it, such as Deadmines and the 5-6 quests it has.
---
Damn right , "bfa Bad Activision Bad classic good" is such a great argument.
---
It's funny tho, i though this reddit was a place of discussion rather than trashing people without any argument but i guess you have your reasons to be so grumpy.

Introduction: If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place.Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
What we are looking for: Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
What we are aiming for: Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
What we expect of members:
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids (once a week).
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
Our Raid Schedule: Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot.

Sorry to thread snipe, but how big a keyboard would u recommend or say is necessary? I have a vortex poker 60% so not a lot of keys but I love it. Is it enough to be a good player or would say I'd need a bigger keyboard if I want to be hardcore?

Did that really happen more in Vanilla? I don’t know if it’s the same in the US but on Argent Dawn Ive found people tend to operate on a don’t ask don’t tell policy when it comes to IRL gender.
---
How will that happen in Classic? Blizz will never do fresh cycles.
---
Thatta boy
---
You know, a really common build is to just take the 5% crit in fury and then go arms. I did it and it's damn good. 
---
This is master class shitposting 
---
Intellimouse would like to have a word
---
The n-gage..i wanted this sooo bad when it was released back in the days!
---
I use about 1-5. The others are too far away so only non urgent stuff there. Then all the keys around your hand like q e r f x. Even z c, caps and that thing left of the 1 is pretty ok. 
---
The best part is that Deckard is secretly a Classic Raider.
---
Yes they are among the most played classes for each faction after warrior.
---
1. As soon as you get into game activate a couple extra bars and make them always visible. 
---
2. On the bottom bar find out if you can easily press 1 to 6 or if you should stick with 1 to 5 and then start binding anything beyond those numbers to letters. 
---
3. I don’t know what class you play but for me no matter what game I play I always bind the same buttons for similar abilities.
---
Ex. Any kind of spell kick interrupt gets bound to “r”. I just find this easy to hit but it is still out of the way enough to not hit it on accident and put in on cooldown unintentionally.
---
Ex. Gap closer is always on “f”.
---
You get the point. Find a system you can use in any MMO and keep those binds similar. That is how you develop muscle memory and become a beast.
---
4. Almost always hold down right mouse button while you play. Then you can steer your character while you strafe around. Get better with spinning your camera around to check your surroundings and then going back and forth between that and having control of your character.
---
Once you start doing these basic things you’ll smack yourself and ask why you haven’t been doing them all along.
---
You make a good point. I think a beta just to make sure the product works well under load is essential. The problem is people are inevitably going to report “this isn’t how vanilla was” and that is not what they are looking for. So I’m sure beta will be relatively close to release. 
---
For pvp the orc racial is just too good, for pve it's whatever.
---
The thing you're forgetting is that we're playing on 1.12 come classic, making everything you said pretty much invalid. Try looking it up. 
---
"I've never seen you this happy" - Dad when bringing 9 year old me home in the car with my own copy, didn't have to beg my brothers to play on theirs anymore
---
They're basically using the old copy as a template and recreating classic using the current wow client (or the one that was the most current when they started, at least)
---
I think at the very least Oceania will get 1 of each server lol
---
Hell ya. Didn't the only semi decent one around anymore say they will be closing down if classic is how it should be?
---
Yeah I doubt ion is going to shut down the servers and delete everyone's data because someone ate his doughnut or whatever stupid shit happens on *certain servers*
---
I always did this on warrior but didn't ever think to do it with my rogue. 😬
---
So the majority of players who want vanilla don't get to experience it? Seems backwards but definitely a money maker. 
---
Leveling up and doing dungeons is a large and extremely enjoyable part of the game. Raiding is another part but it only becomes meaningful as part of the whole progression of your character through the game. Why would you play the game and then try and find ways to *not play the game*?
---
It's your time and life, do whatever you want but if you are someone who'd enjoy Vanilla you'd do yourself a *huge* disservice by trying to rush to 60 to "play the game". I highly recommend you forget all the videos, guides, theorycrafting and voices in the back of your mind urging you to "optimize" your gameplay. When Classic releases, log on, take a huge breath and just let the game take you wherever it will. It'll provide you with months and months of exquisite enjoyment, wonder and adventure.
---
If you fear that by taking it slow you'll "get left behind", don't. There will be many people who'll not rush. You'll be able to find new friends playing during your journey or even when you finally reach level 60. Or if you really want to make sure you'll have a place raiding, look for a guild even before Classic launches. There are many forming and lot will be for people who don't rush.
---
Yeah if they thought poison swaps wee breaking the game.but not stance dances that's pretty silly. It seems like the problem was not poisons existing to some mages or priests XD
---
Most pservers operates by the larger, more upstanding members of the community have said they will shut down once classic releases. 
---
Best bet is that unless blizzard fucks up, most of not all will go away. If blizzard do fuck up, this will be a godsend to them: they will have access to correct 1.12 values for all content and will be able to correct everything from proc rates, armor values, weird scaling of abilities/talents, how hit worked with weapon skill increases, drop rates, etc. 
---
They absolutely were not in the game originally. Maybe eu versions and definitely later in the game. But at release it was regular characters only.
---
I've quit a long time ago. Now waiting for release. :)
---
I’ve always read that as needing to have 4% to bridge the hit gap regardless, and that the 1% will always be in affect. Meaning 3% hit = 2% chance to resist in pvp (1% in pve). Did I just overthink it? I don’t play casters tho
---
Not in nilla WoW, I remember having to rebind A and D.
---
It's a game currently in pre-alpha that has taken a lot of inspiration from ye olde Everquest. 
---
Kill you self, download an addon that manages this for all paladins in the raid, all the same
---
You did this very neatly. I love how you formatted it and how you edited the maps.
---
I'm also currently working on a 1-20 Alliance leveling guide, mainly for my own use, so I appreciate your efforts. It's very inspiring!
---
I always love the feeling of feeling really powerful for 6-8 levels after I make something like Phantom Blade or get a really good main-hand weapon. I mean once you hit level 40 leveling can take awhile. Once that happens it's worth it to go out of your way to do specific dungeons for a good primary. Especially if your a Rogue and double-especialy for a Subtlety rogue. 
---
Rupture scales deal well with weapon DMG and can easily do 30-60% of a targets health. It's 100% worth not giving a shit about gouge **if** you are playing subtlety for the extra escape mechanics. 
---
Any more insight you can give us into the thoughts of blizzard? Interesting that you already know what they’re planning. Tell us more please!
---
Isn't classic will be fresh? 
---
If you don't plan on following a leveling guide, crafting gear, and are playing a very gear dependant class (rogue for example) them dungeons are fantastic.
---
Guilds have been forming for a very long time. :) You just have to look around a little.

Half life 2 was released in 2004.

I forgot that. For some reason I thought it hit November 2005, but you're right it was 2004!
---
This is a great metaphor. A reasonably priced legal option is something most people would prefer to pay for.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UixnJI-6n4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UixnJI-6n4) for people wondering.
---
You don't need to farm MCP to pull decent threat or even high threat from my experience. Also times have changed. You'll get invited as a Druid for both tanking and healing just fine. I haven't ever been rejected and I've never seen anyone reject a Druid. Especially melees love when you bring LotP, like they love WF from Shamans. If you play this class around at least semi-informed people you'll be welcome.
---
If you're min/maxing in Classic, you're doing it wrong.  Exactly zero fights require that, even in Naxx.
---
Play what you want, and so long as you're killing things well enough, don't worry about sliding 20 points around for a theoretical gain of 2% damage.
---
Remember having a desk like that, is it swedish?
---
30 years old != boomer
---
that's more or less what I was looking for.  I'm not really planning to speed level so it'll be slower for sure but during actual vanilla when i had no idea what I was doing or what an mmorpg really was it took me months just to get a single character to 60.. I plan to get 3 to 60 this time and was trying to see how much of it was the game and how much was me lol. 
---
I work in SW dev.  There is no way that blizzard don’t have every released source code “somewhere”. It’s been branch standard since before 1990.   It might not have been a fun system to get working and the server code might be designed around a special hardware meaning they might need to change things.  
---
They probably found the source code, spent a few days to get every lib (because thing change over the years). To get it to build. Once it build they have to analyse the code of what state it is in.  That would take a small team 3-5ppl a couple of weeks to even get a grasp of the complexity.  
---
My Anathema is probably still collecting dust in the bank (I haven't played in years). Will be nice to get one on a classic char.
---
Sounds perfect
---
This. Amazing how many people forget this crucial aspect, it makes it *very* situational. 
---
Dorutar is not that bad is it? 
---
Only that you should expect to make some significant changes. 
---
Indeed. Friends, social network is everything in Vanilla.
---
Standard keyboard keys are plenty when adding in shift and Ctrl and alt mosifiers
---
Had a friend who Bought out all the slots, can’t remember how much it cost but it was enough for us to laugh at his expense for a long time given that insta t mail patched about a week later 
---
They likely have a very long list of things they are working on. There's no point in opening a beta just to add hundreds of new things on that list before they fixed the things they already know about. A beta will likely come at some point..
---
What i don't understand is that so many people gunna be playing wow classic who tf is going to be watching someone play it??
---
I'm fairly certain most if not all of this was ad-libbed as well. Mad props to Rutger Hauer 
---
In not too concerned with the leveling process. It’s all an endgame raiding consideration. Obviously the biggest factor is DPS vs. Healer. I enjoy range more than melee and have spent 15 years playing a Mage, more or less. So rogue and warrior don’t interest me much and the decision than lies between the 4th best DPS, which bums me out, or getting a bit crazy and swapping roles to healer. I wouldn’t play shadow (only while leveling).

Just got the Logitech gpro wireless, it's fantastic. Highly rated, wireless is just as fast nowadays. Long charge, no large batteries, easy recharge, light weight, very ergonomic 
---
Yeah it is. You have to run from Southshore as alliance
---
Word of advice, don't expect to be able to raid as a ret paladin. If you do manage to get into a raid, you will be on [Nightfall](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169) duty and your rotation will revolve around autoattacking and using downranked version of Consecration every 8 seconds. Keep in mind that warriors and hunters can use Nightfall more efficiently than you, meaning that many semi-hardcore guilds won't accept you anyway.
---
Yep, exactly actually, started airing 1999 :D
---
I wouldn't participate myself, but I would like to hear from other people.
---
By "To it's fullest" I assume you mean including raiding.
---
Everything else is open to casuals, no matter how much time they have.
---
I think you'd probably be able to get into raids as well, as long as you can commit to one particular night a week. Pick a night that works for you, find a guild that raids that night and is willing to let you in. 
---
If they want to reduce load, they need to add spell snapshotting. (only checks status effects on start of a dot/channel, not every tick trough the duration like it does now)
---
Not sure if anyone's talked about it, but it was a pretty important thing for warlocks in particular
---
Amazing. I imagine this kid rolling need on everything

I'll keep that in mind then

That's probably because that's not how they work, but that's what I thought they were for, because I'm a scrub 
---
Can't speak for the when (in terms of vanilla) or US versions, but I remember having those names during vanilla. EU though, although I don't know why US should have different rules.

you get points for it being an interesting idea, unfortunately it would be a colossal failure

&gt;If you're min/maxing in Classic, you're doing it wrong. Exactly zero fights require that, ___even in Naxx___.
---
Doubt.
---
by mastering the google-fu art
---
I'm sure vanilla was different, but in wrath, my ret pally out DPS'd most hunters, druids, and even some warriors. Are ret pallys just weak as fuck or something in vanilla?
---
The definition of a clicker; he doesn't even HAVE a keyboard! Haha
---
Great picture champ, I'll see you in Azeroth!
---
dunno I think wotlk had peak quality talent tree balancing
---
&gt; I think if you grab every quest for Uldamam and do them all, it's like by far the best xp/hour things you can do at that level bracket
---
That's a very weird exemple as Uldaman is the absolute worst leveling dungeon from my experience. 
---
First off the level span from the mobs inside is ridiculous, ranging from 35 to 45. if you go in there early you're likely to not finish the dungeon because the 42-45 troggs and dwarves in the last part will destroy you. If you go in there at the optimal level you'll fight green mobs that give barely any XP for half the dungeon.
---
7 out of the 9 bosses have a chance to massively troll you because they have white and green items in their loot tables and you're only guaranteed a blue drop on Ironaya and Archaedas which is pretty depressing.
---
5 out of the 6 quests Horde side can be done outside of the dungeon with just a couple players:
---
* Power Stones drop from the dwarves outside
---
* Shattered Necklace drops for the dwarves outside as well
---
* Tablet for Solution to Doom, outside
---
* Chest for Reclaimed Treasure, outside as well
---
* The respawn timer of the shrooms for Reagent Run is awful and 90% of people just skip it
---
Realistically the only benefit you will get from running the full dungeon is the extra Platinum Discs quest from the treasure room past Archaedas and it's not even a quest chain.
---
All in all it's just a very weirdly designed dungeon and a massive waste of time compared to just doing the quests in the cave before the dungeon's portal with a couple players and calling it a day. 
---
&gt;Every single one has had some clearly busted thing like weapon enchants proccing off kitty auto attacks causing near 100% uptime on them. Weapon damage affecting the auto attack value of kittys. Not to mention a low level weapon with a certain Proc being the BIS weapon for kittys because of a hidden item value that was left unfixed for a certain servers entire life time.
---
Care to name the server and particular items? I don't think I've ever seen any private server ferals using items like that.
---
Regardless, the idea that you need PvE gear to raid as feral is totally ridiculous. Those items are great for PvP because they improve your performance in feral forms as well as your spell damage, healing and mana pool. However, if you're going to be a tank or DPS in PvE, those items have lots of wasted stats, making them suboptimal for PvE. 
---
yeah well add ons wont be available at launch so its still gonna suck for a while.
---
You think paladongs care about being efficient, Thats cute

Notice how you can't see his other hand, only the one on his computer mouse. This guy was playing a nightelf female for sure!
---
As long as that keyboard is just missing the numpad and nothing near the WASD side of the keyboard it doesn't matter.
---
I don't really get why I wouldn't or, for that matter, why you wouldn't?+
---
What's so bad about other Swedes?
---
In full pve feral gear you do a lot of damage. Problem is you cant stay cat form very long as you dont have stunlocks or interputs like a rogue does. You need to switch out of form to use your full toolkit as a druid, which will run you oom quickly.
---
In my ~~old~~ young (?) days then ;-)
---
I had a friend using several PCs for Dark Age of Camelot and I was using 3 for WOW, we didn't know about multiboxing software or WinAPI.
---
Mt / Ot are obvious choices but honestly anyone putting that much time and gold in it, I think k anyone dedicated enough should get a shot. By the time you get it, you've got most things on farm. 
---
And to be fair, a paladin with WF is one of the most insane interactions possible. Add fiery weapon to it, and procs alone can do over 60% damage
---
why would it be a colossal failure?
---
is there something for win10?
---
Everyone's posting old pictures from 15 years ago saying they can't wait for summer
---
This shit is hyping me up!
---
29/11/11 is a very strong spec for pvp as well that doesn't focus all it's talents into healing
---
hmm maybe i'm remembering wrong but i really don't remember that as being the case.  I've played about 10 different private servers and to me that doesn't "feel" right
---
what server were you on?
---
Damn! I was only sitting at maybe 2” at that age
---
All good pieces of advice. #4 is a concern right now. I’m in a casual guild, but we’re currently raiding 4x a week for 2 hours. I don’t think I want to streamline like this into Classic, but at the same time, I’m worried if I stop that I’ll lose the WoW bug.
---
I suspect once I know a release date I’ll definitely take a few weeks off before Classic is out though.
---
That’s just not true.
---
Hey, what is barrens.chat / where, and would you mind talking on discord? That is, if you're horde, just seeing more about early levels 1-10 for druid. Pushing past the first bottleneck is the only thing I'm really looking to min max, then I'll probably go along with Joanna's guide
---
They reduced the cost of the 50g and 100g slots to 25g each in tbc.
---
- Yeah, invite my friend Ľēĝőİąş
---
- Excuse me?
---
Yeah, retribution and protection were pretty much useless in Vanilla PvE. You can make ret work in PvP, but you will have to heal in raids in order to get geared. And while ret is not a bad PvP spec, its relative viability is overshadowed by the fact that holy paladin is the strongest PvP healer in the game.
---
Well it depends - for most people, leveling is a big part of the game, it's gonna take longer than most full big single player games to level from 1-60, so people tend to enjoy having a varied, fun, and challenging experience in that time. 
---
The feeling of getting that cool item you wanted is no less amazing at lvl 20 than it is at level 60 - you're still gonna feel super baws for some time. 
---
Whether it's the most efficient way of leveling - probably not, but if you're running each dungeon once, with a good group, and do all the quests, I think that'd actually contribute well to fast leveling. 
---
Running the same instance 5 times because you just want that cool shoulder piece from SM Armory, is probably not efficient though. 
---
I'm sure someone could do some number crunching on the speed gained from e.g. getting a new weapon, vs the extra time it takes running the instance and getting it. 
---
So well, no it's not mandatory - but it's a lot of fun, and it's probably the best way of building the relations that might turn out to be your raiding guild at 60, that tank you always write to run instances, etc. 
---
No FedEx is 1-10, just 1-5 
---
But you are wrong. The french mage who mobtagged never got banned or had any action taken towards him. Athene did not just do regular mobtagging but was doing cheesy plays with a dungeon boss. 
---
Are you slacking on DPS in molten core to take a picture! My raid leader would have screamed. 
---
you dont get split up, you can log between 1/2/3 anytime you like.
---
its also done dynamically as population rises, i.e they dont start with 5 realms a new one will not be available unless the population gets high enough to warrant it.
---
its also a pretty short timeline, i doubt you would notice a split community forming.
---
Dammit, I absolutely hate healing. If I can find a good addon that works, I'll give it a shot though. I just love being in combat more than sitting on the sidelines, keeping the tanks alive.
---
Honestly, there's no such thing as rotation in vanilla for pvp anyways. Macro are used to simplify some tasks usually, like change stance + interception, change weapon + shield bash, etc. Learning to never click an ability again is your first step, macro are not that useful early on. 
---
Early on you could abuse macros and ambush with swords as you started the attack and the macro would swap weapons before it landed. 
---
i mean if you ask me what i want id say let the servers melt, but i cant argue with success, it worked well for bdo and is praised as a successful model.
---
This. You’ll always have a home healing endgame with either. Ideally, a horde raid could use eight Shaman and be happy.
---
&gt; Pick a race/class you enjoy.
---
I'm no expert but I think you nailed with here. Nobody ever talks about this. 
---
Calm down. Calling something "off-spec" is not an evaluation of how good or bad it is.
---
Yeah they definitely have plenty to work on, it just sounded like he said no beta was needed at all, just straight to launch day.
---
It will take longer to get into raids than to port some addons.
---
Also, please don't spread misinformation. For all we know there could be a beta that allows add-ons to be ready the second Classic goes live.
---
As someone who has been playing feral for years I can with certainty say you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Weapon damage in forms were fixed years ago. And the low level weapon? Are you talking about Pummelers? Those work correctly. I am not aware of any other low level weapon that is any good. Weapon procs does NOT work in forms on these server and has not done so for a very long time.
---
&gt;feral druid will serve you just fine only be aware that you will be bottom of the charts on most encounters 
---
Again not true. If you are putting in the effort with consumes, get the gear you need, farm pummelers and use powershifting to its potential you will be able to compete on the meters in anything but the most tryhard pve guilds.
---
Im just a bit fed up honestly with constantly having to explain these things to people who list list a bunch of nonsense which in no way represent private servers.  May I ask if you ever even played on one? I suspect you are just parroting what you were told on some forum years ago and believe it to be true.
---
&lt;EDGE&gt; blood scalp 
---
Only slightly though. The good pieces are the gloves which gives you a very unique effect and some of the set bonuses like the increased run speed in travel form. I do think that the sets could use an upgrade in the late-game. Especially the epic sets because they are quite hard to obtain, whereas AQ and Naxx gear isn't. 
---
On the other hand, it's the imbance and brokenness that gives charm to vanilla imo. Everything is not perfect and that can be good. In fact there's only one thing I would like to change with vanilla and that is hunter dps post-BWL. I like the idea of hybrids having one good role and then 2-3 niche roles that nobody else can do. The hunter though, can only really do one thing; DPS, and come AQ and especially Naxx they really suck because they don't scale well with gear. I've seen many guilds who would rather take a nightfall wielding retri paladin or feral druid than a hunter to Naxx. That's pretty broken imo and it's a very unfortunate situation for the hunter and one of the reasons why I don't play them.
---
Moonwalking is the only reason I always rebind the movement keys after tryharding my key binds - I need to be able to moonwalk as much as I need to have nice key binds. 
---
&gt;  There is no way that blizzard don’t have every released source code “somewhere”. It’s been branch standard since before 1990.
---
They have version control of all the server and client code, but not the actual database values. They found the 1.12.1 data recently by luck. Afaik they don't have any older data than that.
---
/u/TestRoyale
---
They're modifying the [7.3.5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=12m40s) Legion client to process the 1.12.1 data. The old 1.12.1 client is used as a reference frame only.
---
The ability of an add-on to ask the server for completed quests, and display them. So many people lose track of where they are, especially with alts.
---
Warrior and rogue especially can go from feeling straight up bad to two of the most enjoyable classes with some nice blues
---
Why did you steal my clock and my chest of drawers?
---
First_day_on_the_internet_kid.jpg
---
Ah, i'm not sure then
---
Is it wrong that lately I feel the minority, when I was post-college for classic?
---
I feel like I can't get a grasp on the ratio of old-guard returning vs young-old-guard returning. In forums, behind text, I imagine most of us as 35-40, but I think in reality most of you guys are about 25. 
---
I feel like an old fuddy, but it's weird because when I played most of my friends/guidlies/contacts were all my age (mid-20s). Yet everything I see in this sub makes me feel like those people will be the minority come release.
---
I feel like equal geared rogues don't really stand a chance against VW SL warlock. Other specs, sure
---
Oh, is that grey hair?
---
They always had the source code. They didn't have maps, textures, objects and databases, nor the build system.
---
Classic will use a patched modern client and server, not just because of battle.net, but also because of the extensive anti-cheat features.
---
The special characters aren't bad, in fact they are similar to face tattoos. It lets you know people are idiots without having to talk to them.
---
Well that’s just not true but thanks for playing my guy 
---
Bro you had a flat screen in 2004?
---
Maraudon has some good gear for 60 as well. The ring from princess is BiS for Hunter for example, so I intend to potentially run it multiple times while leveling to get it.
---
That’s ok we didn’t need him anyway
---
I agree for the most part, but not ever lock wants to play SL. Many play nightfall/Conflag, DS/Ruin or SM/Ruin. Those specs are significantly more susceptible to rogues stun locking the to death with no way out. 
---
They might make a small one line bullet point that Classic is cancelled. Then later in the post say it’s not cancelled anymore. I’d laugh. I almost just laughed at my own joke. 
---
XP junkies.
---
The demo was the beta. Did they find any zone specifik bugs tho? 
---
I'm really trying to convince myself to main a druid in classic, but I'm always worried I'm going to regret it later.  I don't even mind being stuck as a healer, I like healing, I'm just worried  that I'll get to end game and not be able to make gold or do open world content well.
---
I don't remember, could be from Ikea if it existed at the time.
---
probably because german language etc uses different letters
---
Im playing one a bit right now, that way I can figure out a decent route/ make sure i enjoy playing paladin. (I do so far!) also for me no other game sounds fun right now but classic so it's been nice to get my fix even if it's just a knock off for the time being. Though borderlands 1 hd might give me a good time sync until summer so we'll see! :-)
---
Parents who liked their child
---
You can see where the keyboard sits on a roll out plane slightly under the desk.
---
If blizzard does any sort of beta (closed or otherwise) most addons will be available at launch because the LUA will be distributed.
---
Drain Your Gains? That is truly a miserable way to look at it. 
---
&gt;The cold hard truth is that you need to be restoration to be effective in any PVE raids. I was angry when I came to that conclusion too, but it's better to accept it for what it is and not force something. A square peg doesn't fit into a round hole, it just won't work.
---
The "cold hard truth" (I hate when people say this to try and validate their opinion) is that Druids have two viable healing specs and a very viable tank spec which is arguably better than Prot and Furyprot for a lot of bossfights.
---
In fact the feral spec is good enough that I would even say its optimal to use one. It adds diversity to the tank core. Frees up gear for the prot warriors (You are gearing 2 warriors and 1 druid instead of 3 prot warriors), and any fight where you dont need 3 tanks, the feral druid will always outperform a protwarrior by either going into catform, or decurse/dispel (Chromaggus and Viscidus f.ex)
---
I knew my parents didn't love me enough
---
I think this sub over represents people who (like myself) were younger when classic came out. We have a more profound nostalgia. 
---
Plenty of older people will play, they just aren't generally obsessive enough to cruise a forum for a game that isn't out yet, lol.
---
I had just turned 13 when I started playing around Christmas of '04. Young enough for the whole thing to be magical, old enough that I raided with adults and tanked through BWL.
---
Still worth it at tenfold price. With instant mail.
---
27 and can’t wait haha 
---
&gt;he said definitely, there actually super good xp and he said the only reason he doesn't do them himself is because if you don't have a good group it's a huge waste
---
This is really the issue. The dungeons when you have all the quests give great experience. But you never know if you end up in a group that can clear in 30-40 minutes, or if you will be spending two hours inside after waiting an hour for people to get there.
---
Agreed, more of a caster spec that you want to use for group fights I guess.
---
I assumed that the videos OP mentioned were your typical flag carrier and duel or surviving 1vX scenarios, where people spec deep into resto or HotW for survivability.
---
Too many people are obsessed with efficient levelling and minmaxing... leave that shit until you hit 60 and have fun along the way imo. I get that some have played a ton of vanilla on private servers lately and get their fun from speedleveling etc but if you haven't played classic since back then, try to explore and do everything. You don't have to farm Black lotus or join the devilsaur mafia to make money in 60. Plenty of classes have excellent farming methods. The dungeons in vanilla not only have some great quests but they often give you the best leveling gear and you make friends along the way, which is pretty damn essential when you're trying to find a group without using the dungeon finder like a zombie. You know I'm not stepping out of ZF until I got my vexxing cane. 
---
I was asking myself this question the other day. I wrote a quick and dirty sim to test out how much of a difference it makes. Human did about 2% more threat while tanking a boss, and for fury about 4% more DPS.
---

Not sure about other classes, but Druid tanks will still be using this in Naxxramas. Thats how good it is.
---
You won’t need much dude. 
---
Remember, its a game from 2004. Graphics/what computers can handle these days have improved drastically. I bet there are phones that could run vanilla WoW.
---
Nah it's definitely a phenomenon I've noticed in recent years. Personally I think more of the college crowd that played Vanilla/TBC has moved on than we think.
---
Me too! SpongeBob season 13 is gonna be lit! 
---
They did back in vanilla, several times aswell. Why is it impossible to think they'd do it again 6 months-a year down the path?

This is what I'm using with a few added bits. Currently playing at ultra and having no issues with vanilla what so ever.

You're right. Though keeping a VW out is a very good rogue deterrent / fail safe. I forget what warlock trinkets dispel, but a potion to cleanse stun is a good thing to carry a couple of also, for the tryhards
---
Spending half that would be overkill for just classic.
---
Night elf hunter IRL 
---
Faster weapons don't generate more rage. Rage is based only on damage done. And you won't be in a position to be dumping rage into heroic strike until later in the game, or if you undergear a raid. You'll be able to bleed away all your rage on the much more efficient sunder armor.
---
Agility gives no attack power to warriors, and the armor is pretty negligible. The dodge and Crit are awesome though. 20 agility = 1% Crit and 1% dodge at 60.
---
I might be misremembering but wasn't it called something else before need/greed? Like roll/pass or something really generic?
---
Private servers have NO IDEA what armour values actually were. They are guessing on all mob stats. This has been openly stated by blizzard.
---
Additionally, no one knows how armour penetration was handled in Vanilla. Addative, Multiplicative, were there diminishing returns? Currently sunder armour, CoR etc. Are likely giving a huge and not Blizzlike buff to melee.
---
It’s not the same client though, even without the somewhat improved graphics the requirements are going to be more than a 1.12 pserver client.
---
because Blizzard has already said they're not even adding a basic server type such as RP-PVP, and now you want to go segregating servers based on some wacko criteria?  
---
Usually people recommend about 11 or less healers per raid.
---
åäöü in names where a not allowed. But thésè squiggles where ok on eu english realms. There were so many Légòláds.
---
Based on some simulations I ran, 2% TPS for prot tanking a boss, and 4% DPS for fury warriors.
---
ALOT of people been playing private servers for years. So alot of players will be from there as well. All ages. Even new wow players emerged from the free to play scene. Im 35 now and got 4 kids.. So these privvy players (i played there myself) cant wait to own us dad gamers. 😂
---
Back then I leveled a warrior with no addons so I had to read quest text and I played with low visibility settings. It was more immersive and forced me to remember the geography of zones because I also had no map addon.  
---
I specifically remember leveling being very tedious and not wanting to venture far from Stormwind.  But anyway I think if you are playing for the first time then you should not use quest or map addons. It just defeats the purpose of playing the game and ultimately is what led to retail easy mode that everyone seems to hate.

Please don't make the mistake of buying a laptop.

---
the casters dont scale nearly as good from just weapon upgrades
---
Could be, I've started late TBC and I think it was need greed there already :)
---
Maps and textures they had because that’s part of the client code.  And the client code is well distributed and they (should have had enough versions to handle it).  
---
Db well that’s another problem, they should have the setup scripts and patching scrips also I. The revision history. 
---
If blizzard wanted to boot up vanilla as it was on retail with old db and old server code they should be able to do it in less then three months. But I do agree that the path they took as they tie it to battlenet and anti cheat is important to blizzard 
---
no, but now i want to

People who play more than you are going to have more stuff than you, there is nothing wrong with that.

I managed to get a free 3 day sub to try it out again after missing the weekend. I haven't played since WOD.
---
I've still got a day left but I've already uninstalled it. Stories were good, but the land wasn't interesting. Go to a point in the map, do objective, take nothing in. There were cool hidden areas to find with nice wee rewards, but it was the gameplay and combat that let it down. It felt like I was playing a MOBA,which was fun for a bit but it couldn't keep me hooked. I didn't have to think much at all. Having to stay on your toes all the time is something I'm looking forward to in classic.
---
The graphics and zones were great, and so were the story quests, but the stale gameplay just let it down, which is a shame.
---
They should have setup db scripts to boot up new servers.  Then a patch scripts.   I am amazed if this is the case that they was so careless with the data.  
---

---
It’s not required but I’d recommend an i7 processor and at least some sort of dedicated graphics card. Like nvidea GeForce. The amount of storage doesn’t really matter because you can buy external if necessary. Also I’d Highly recommend going for the larger screen. You will regret buying anything 15 inches or smaller and bring it right back to Best Buy. 
---
Vanilla WoW isn't a race to max level like current retail is. Do the dungeons at least once to experience them, and then if you ever make an alt you can choose to skip them if you want.
---
It’s usually evenly distributed by how many raid spots the classes get. Sure, a server can get 35% warriors but that’s because every raid will need a lot of warriors

Yes might be that they had different rules because of this.
---
No man every raid group will have 8 Dwarf Priests. If you're not doing that you might as well not even play./s
---
You give it to your tanks. A waste for anyone else.
---
Im probably one of the most hardcore vanilla pvp players out there i have played classic pvt since the first ones launched. yet in a cinematic showing a raid wiping through naxx is not what i consider epic. Im sorry i dont share the same enthusiasm towards this cinematic.
---
This has to be the stupidest server classification I’ve ever heard of
---
Thanks for the info man. 
---
I want a huge monitor, maybe 30/40 inches. Do you think that’s overkill? 
---
Wouldn't actually be an issue if we could copy &amp; paste in chat.
---
Nah, I want the real authentic experience. My plan for the summer is to forget half of my English vocabulary so that I can't read quests or communicate with the other players very well and it takes me 6 - 8 months to hit 60.
---
Well, okay, if you know better than Blizzard that's fine by me. A little bit surprising though.
---
They talked about all this a lot, for example during the original Blizzcon announcement.
---
Shadow Ghost and save your money.
---
Its would be like to tell to your kido, You will get icecream and and the end . Ha haa its april fools.
---
Why is that? 
---
It would also make sense to not have the 1.12 talents at start but we're not doing that so why bother with 8 slots?
---
So realms that don't transfer enough get to keep a sharded world? Seems unwise. 
---
Lmfao, chill. I don’t give a shit about the n-word. I just wanted to point out that if Larry David, Tom Hanks, or William Shatner had some exactly the same thing, then y’all would be trying to cancel TF out of them.

I just wish y’all could admit to having a twisted, sick, and racist sense of humor.

If your right I’m amazed at there lack of structure.  Big organisations always try to protect it self from IP losses by marking sure everything is saved somewhere backed up.   (It’s not unheard of.  I have seen it but only in minor .org. ).

Yup, things were way different back then.
---
If you're interested and haven't seen it yet, they're talking about it [here, 4:00-9:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=4m0s)
---
Thanks
---
Perfect analogy! 
---
I commented once that the nostalgia argument for people loving vanilla wasn't valid because most of us were past the nostalgia age when WoW came out. Also, most of the people I raided with were in their 20s at the time.
---
People on this sub were quick to correct me that they were all playing vanilla at 9-14 years old but either never hit 60 or never raided.
---
Anyway, in my mid thirties here and I browse this shit all day long. I think reddit generally is comprised of people in their 20s so that could be the reason.
---
That's pretty awesome you got to clear BWL as a tank at 13.
---
Ultrawides are insane and the new client will support them. I had a Predator X34 34" 100hz for a while (ultimately traded for a smaller panel with higher hz) and WoW was fantastic on it.
---
Slash your system budget and get an ultrawide.
---
It would be a sub division of pvp/pve etc. So if 10 pvp servers, it could be 3-3-4 different pvp servers of different play times.
---
I just ordered one of these for classic. Great price right now!

---
That stun has won me a lot of duels. I feel like it’s underrated. 
---
That is pretty huge and more of a TV than a monitor. If you go that big then a laptop is definitely out of the question. 
---
For what it’s worth I have a laptop with a 17” screen and i7 processor. I think I paid about $1,000 for it. The convenience of being able to sit on the couch and play makes it worth it. I just set my mousepad on the armrest and use a wireless mouse. If I want to I can obviously still set it up at a desk and play like it’s a desktop but I almost never to that.

That sounds pretty cool actually. 
---
Even Horde, they will still require dwarf priests only
---
Are you lumping all hybrids in with "healer" there?
---
Post-college vanilla player here, though barely. I had just graduated, and was still a heavy SWG player at the time. I played some WoW as well, and Eve. I remember watching my flat mate raid in MC, but I wasn’t high enough at the time. 
---
Finally switched over to WoW fully when Sony ruined SWG with the NGE.
---
Yeah, they should, but they are really bad at it. Of course Blizzard always had backups of the live stuff, but they literally pushed the new game data right into production. There was "live" and "next", but no history.
---
It's got a lot better in general though, but mostly because technology has become better. If your infrastructure is somewhat modern, you can snapshot most of it and put it in Amazon Glacier for something like 200$ a month.
---
Still, I don't think that more than 10% of companies are doing their due diligence when it comes to backups. Not that much has changed. I've seen machines that handle tens of thousands of credit cards transactions daily, with no backups. They thought the SAN people did the backups (they did not). Which means that they never tested disaster recovery...
---
Stormx and Finalflash both have videos on YouTube!
---
I’m cool with whatever people want to do, but it was nice to read this post. I’m looking forward to leveling along with people unattached to a guild. Let people take their own roads in the game.
---
The “dig” Jobs are fun, it takes patience and luck and a lot of hard work to then create a rapport with a estimate on time left to get the product out.  
---
Usual dig jobs is ugh our old server died.  And the hard drive died can you fix this ancient machine we got as backup to work.  We got a tape with all data from last week. 
---
I hope only for a stress test. 
---
I made so much gold because of that key. Good times! 
---
Or the night elf male bug where they have their hand stuck up in the air :D
---
That's a sunday, blizzard games always get released on a tuesday so July 26th would be more likely.
---
It won’t happen. Too many quality of life features in retail that people won’t be able to accept. Classic isn’t a game for retail players that haven’t already seen early WoW. The hope is it pulls in other players from different RPGs.
---
no, I don't.
---
I wanted to know why he thought it would be a massive failure.
---
OP did not suggest to segregate more, he suggested to segregate differently. 
---
This would never work because people would never sort themselves out like that. If I had a lot of free time and wanted to dominate I would join the low hour server. Other people would have the same idea and therefore the rationale is ruined. 
---
&gt; what is barrens.chat 
---
Classic wow community, it has a speedleveling thread on there thats relatively active.  
---
I do play horde, however I'm afraid I won't be of much help, as I havent done any routing for Mulgore.
---
Playing a hunter, you fill your bags with ammo that you made engineering... near the end of gnomerangen which took almost 2 hours,  you realize you are out of ammo. 
---
Actually the best memories of playing were some of the worst aspects of classic. Cant wait!
---
Also, Ebbnflow uploads his streams to YouTube.  There's a large disparity between StormX PvP montages and having two Hunters run you down in Silithis on Ebbnflows stream.  It's nice to get a realistic view of what overall gameplay is like.  Would recommend checking them all out of course.  Cheers!
---
stormx is good but prepare to be extremely underwhelmed
---
Yeah TBC was def. need/greed. I just have some very faint memory of need/greed being a new thing at some point in Vanilla.
---
I hired all the Medicine Men
---
Honestly I’m in the mid 30s crowd but never used reddit until a month ago. So I think you may be right. 
---
Hunter?
---
Well, you are faster when you group up, but you gain less xp per mob, and as mob-xp make up a pretty large portion of your leveling it could leave you underleveled with no quests left in a zone, no?
---
I played a shaman in Classic, my roommate played a druid... We'd play as resto, we'd play as crazy hybrids, we'd play as pure DPS... As resto we could join a WSG and absolutely turn the tide of the game. 
---
There wasn't a 5 man either of us couldn't main heal easily. There wasn't a 10 man we couldn't heal together, and in a 20 man we really only needed 1 more healer (a good discipline priest was always welcome) but for 20 mans, we'd gladly take 2 more healers :D
---
He tanked onyxia a few times, I tanked Undead Strath one night, +5% shield block, rockbiter weapon, and earthshock for the win baby, single target agro all night. (Shamans are hilariously bad tanks, but we cleared it.)
---
Druids were one of my favorite classes in all of wow, ever.
---
My current plan is to play a Prot pally, but my secondary character is going to be a feral druid. Like I'm going to make 3 characters immediately upon release. 
---
- Prot Pally
---
- Feral Druid (whenever I get this character to max level, I want to be able to do stealth runs with other druids/rouges)
---
- Bank alt, maybe a mage or something, doesn't really matter, going to be lvl 1 for a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time.
---
Of course Jimmy from Finance is going to want us to let him corner the market.  How else is he gonna become Jimmy the CFO.
---
OP, this isn’t the best place for a post like this and there is some not so great advice. If you are looking to build your own, which you ABSOLUTELY should, as its very easy, check out r/buildapc as they will help you out. I can also throw a build together for you too. Monitor/tower included in budget, anything else? 
---
Literary everyone here is saying this garbage at least a couple of times every week. 
---
At the very least, there are some dungeon quests in vanilla with rare items (which are not easy to come by in vanilla) that are massive power upgrades over anything you're likely to find in open world and will speed up your questing outside. The SM sword and RFD swords for example... once you get those on a melee character, that's a big upgrade to take out of your dungeon and into the world for questing. SFK caster gear. SM armory 2h and mail gear. Etc, etc. 
---
It's not like retail where you just queue into dungeons non-stop to level, but the dungeon experience is good, exp isn't bad, and the gear and quests are well worth it.
---
I’m more for a closed beta also.  I don’t want all the tourists to get their fill then just accept that since they don’t get to keep their characters.  A bigger beta I think will reduce somewhat the number of tourists we’ll be able to convert into actual classic players.
---
Rogues.
---
The 5/8 T1 is really nice in PvP - allows you to do unique combos as a 31/8/12 Rogue, but still great whatever your spec is -, and the 3/8 T2 is quite useful as well.
---
The Immune to Disarm from T2 Gloves is also good in PvP.
---
The 8/8 T1 is specifically designed for PvP and is kinda neat if you have the whole set.
---
I don't know whether the 8/8 T2 is specifically designed for PvP and I don't know its exact proc rate, but I think it's pretty good in both PvP and PvE. Its healing component makes it nice for survivability in PvP and effectively increases your health pool.
---
So.. low pop server vs full/locked server. 
---
"Now with that in mind, we're gonna have loot trading and use the shitty version of AV.  Loktar Ogar motherfuckers!"
---
I'm not gonna pay 50g just to respecc though. I will pick a class and build that can do both. 
---
I'll get downvoted for this, but you could 100% frontstab in the classic demo. Some guy literally asked me to test it for him and it worked. I was fighting the non elite defias mobs in the cavern leading to deadmines. I had it recorded on my twitch, but it's long gone now. I guess twitch doesn't save everyone's videos now. If anyone knows how to get deleted twitch vods, I'll happily repost it on YouTube.
---
But how else will you prepare to min/max and get the edge on the server first crowd. 
---
It would be healthier for a server to have more players with similar times. More time for grouping up and accomplishing similar content.  Just offering a thought experiment that could potentially increase the realm experience for everyone.
---
Same brother. I was 21 and had only a stool to sit in. My back hurt so much after that first weekend. 
---
It is but it’s one of the best atmosphere and flowing lowbie dungeons.  If you’re running a PvE server it’s not a big deal.  If pvp you may want to group up before heading to the dungeon and go as a group.  Hell, that will probably give you a fun pvp encounter along the way too.  Oh the memories.
---
Jesus Christ I am old.  
---
what do you mean ? 
---
Yes I think it’s what was meant here
---
This forum existed way before WoW Classic was even announced.
---
Now that's a real battle station
---
So as a note I play alliance so it might be different, but imo uldaman is worth it not because of the dungeon itself because it's long and shitty, but because of [just how many quests it has](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quests=-2.1517).
---
Yeah you’re right, need and greed came about to make it more clear 
---
Oh jesus the "lmfao chill I'm just accusing people of being gas chamber sympathizers" I have to take the defensiveness as you being blown out of the water here. (you also just project a lot after that)
---
Offense is always taken and never given, following that principle will savs you so much of a headache. You're accusing a lot of people of things you can't prove because of 1 accident and a few jokes. I don't follow Pewdiepie, literally hadn't seen him in years.
---
Now let me demonstrate your own hypocricy, calling him a racist or some kind of nazi is a literal insult to victims of the camps in WW2. You're not only saying they supported one through donations or views, but diluting the meaning of the word itself. It's an insult to say the guy who cut you in line at mcdonalds is a nazi, same thing here. You're crying wolf.
---
yeah, 'greed' wasn't always there, so..  
---
if you didn't 'need', you passed on everything, then /roll in chat. 
---
introduction of the 'greed' button was great, saved some time/bullshit.
---
you dont go affi, you go affli + demo for leveling , SM/Ruin is good at lvl 60, nightfall is quite bad while leveling as you do not want to use shadowbolt at all 
---
Dont worry i've already preemptively ended all the relationships in my life, bought a bunch of adult diapers, and i have 37 spreadsheets setup with optimal gear and routes just ready to go.
---
My goal is to abandon the life i have now in favor of being the first person in the world to reach 60, in order to then get to what we all know is the best part of playing vanilla - spamming healing touch in MC.
---
Ah yes, the keyring. Good times.
---
Miss chance is 17% vs raid bosses, so you need 16% in total IIRC. Easily searchable numbers.
---
Your time would be limited per character to prevent this specifically. Plus you will be solo and no one else would be available to do group content.
---
Not spreadsheet but there are database filter websites that you can filter a certain modifier for all items
---
Légölas
---
So blizzard is going to cap you? So if I’m only allowed to play 20 hours and I’m finishing a dungeon run that goes a little long it just logs me out?
---
Yeah this idea is terrible. 
---
No way of knowing for sure. I'm sure there is a large population that is too busy to play more than 20 hours per week.
---
For Horde warriors ... are undead able to break/prevent all the fears from onyxia/nef if they also have the blacksmithing trinket or do you still miss some occasionally?
---
Here’s the thing, if they royal fuck up classic there is gonna be a massive move into private servers. Classic is the only hope we have. 
---
I'm 26 and this makes me feel 46
---
Yeah I know for sure it’s 96% chance to hit with spells at equal level, so a 60 mob will have 4% chance to resist. But what happens with that 1% base chance to resist that you can’t gear for in pvp I’m not sure about. 
---
I’ve always thought it was 4% to cap with 1% always being base for layers regardless, meaning 3% will leave you with a 2% chance to miss in pvp. This might just be silly pserver math 
---
Sure, but I'm not going to level as fast as these other people. My life is very different than when I was playing this game back in school. I don't expect to be 60 on my first too for several months based on my average weekly gaming time, so the issue is not just the first week or two.

---
Most of the things you said didn't feel like disagreements tbh, more like opinions, I can't really dissuade how you feel about something because it really isn't up for debate.
---
To be fair, the thing I should've renamed was class identity to homogenization instead, that would've been a better choice of words since every time someone mentions class identity people interpret it differently.
---
And although BFA made you use some more gold than WoD-legion , if you had any sort of gold from prior expansions which you should since there wasn't much to spend on you wouldn't have that issue, in fact i think blizz released bfa with those mechanics just to drain a bit of gold from everyone's pockets, still though I don't think it is as severe as you say, i'm very interested in what you were farming for weeks though as I had little difficult making gold or maintaining any requirements in bfa with just professions and the AH.
---
BC servers would be amazing!
---
Same concerns here ;\
---
Even so, WoW does not require an amazing gaming rig.
---
I got to level 70 just before Wrath came out
---
I started playing private when mists was announced. I gotta tell ya that classic feels like it has more content than any expansion they put out.
---
I leveled a paladin mostly through dungeons in vanilla (Eonar EU). I ended up having between 4-5 days /played when I reached 60.  
---
A couple of caveats here: 
---
 \- You'll need a static group that are good, and willing to invest gold to go fast (mana pots for the priest, eg.).
---
 \- Certain dungeons are better than others for leveling: RFD and SM Cath in particular, are great. You'll want dungeons with good density and lots of undead in them.
---
 \- At some levels you will have to do quests, but you need at least a good weapon from a dungeon around your level, to speed up mob kills.
---
 \- Leveling this way is an AoE fest, and sometimes you're always balancing on a knife's edge of life and death based on good judgement on pulls.
---
5) Life is short - play more
---
I was doing herbalism to make money. And I was burning through pots extremely fast thanks to M+. And I never set up the gold farm in legion.
---
So I’d be burning like 3-4 Flasks a day, more if it’s also raid night, and like 20+ pots. Sometimes more for both just because everyone wants to M+.
---
you know, it's all these recent photos of people sharing their first WoW moments that makes me realize how young some of them are...when the game came out I was already graduated with my own apartment, wild to think of being a kid and growing up with it (good thing for my grades I didn't)
---
Honestly, I only saw one set of bindings drop in 1.5 years of farming MC back then.  This likely isn't a problem you'll have to worry about.  That being said, it is definitely best for the guild in the hands of a tank.
---
Totally agree upvote for the other melee. give poisoning weapons a special equip passive or cooldown.
---
Had the most wonderful RP guild experiences on both Defias and Venture Co. Horde and alliance respectively. 
---
okay just made my own comment like this before seeing yours, but yep, same!
---
How come they needed a forum post about batching to implement it? 
---
I’m in your boat! But there are a LOT of people in our age bracket. My whole guild was folks my age and older, but I think a lot of those people just don’t use a Reddit. I bet you’ll see them in game though! :)
---
Yeah, no.
---
Did. Right before I posted.
---
But if he change his mind, keep in mind that noone want rogues in premades, it is about rushing and 2 shoting people, rogues have very long cooldowns and are a shit vs heavy armor like holy paladins, bear druids, resto shamans. Rogue is really a 1v1 class.
---
Just search "min/max" and you'll find a lot of casual hot garbage with hundreds of upvotes. Same old opinions about Vanilla not being like how everyone else remembers it, that anyone who doesn't take a SP or an oomkin to raids is a tryhard min/maxing elitist son of a bitch who will hate playing Vanilla because [insert 20 more minutes of regurgitated bullshit], that everyone else should take it as slow as them and etc.

You had an LCD back in 2004, damn boy you fancy with your rich parents.

I was lvl 55 in vanilla before i tried dungeons xD
---
not making that mistake again, missed out on alot of gear and exp
---
Finding an active guild to dungeon with is very recommended xD
---
Playing a hunter, your group jumps off a wall, you pause knowing if you jump, your pet will run down the hall and take the steps, aggroing everything in its path to join you.
---
Pets should follow you, that would be awesome!
---
Would this be specific to druids or any tauren's?
---
the class is fine when you consider it as a whole but most people just want to know how good they are at killing other players, which is not very 
---
Oh yeah. I was only responding to his questions about T1/2 gear and their adequacy to PvP. But indeed Rogues aren't wanted in premades, you might have 1 in WSG and 1-2 in AB, but it's not even mandatory. And in raids they're great but since there will be a shit ton of rogues everywhere it will be hard to have spots too.
---
Yes it would be limited to one character so alts would have separate hour counters. Also, it's never a surprise when you are near the hour mark. If you have 30 minutes in the week on the last day, you wouldnt join a group for a dungeon. You would instead log into an alt character. Maybe there will be a leneincey thing to give you time to finish or w/e but it wouldnt be an issue solving.
---
If you are truly concerned about time, then you would obviously opt into the unlimited hour/no capped server and play many hours a day as you want.
---
I am not gonna lie that guitar part was fucking great.  Cheers.
---
Bad argument. Retail players used the same against classic. We can´t really do that now. 
---
Hehe, glad you liked it :)
---
Wow that sounds familiar! Do you remember if the 'need' option was actually called 'need' by the way? 
---
don't think so,  it was just roll or don't roll,
---
just a dice picture and a cross i think.
---
Yeah probably IKEA 
---
Point me to the video you watched which constructed your entire invalid opinion about hamstring kiting please. I'm looking for a laugh.
---
Dude i have an unsatisfied appetite
---
Ok, yeah that's pretty much exactly what I'm remembering.
---
If you're pugging with a standard group, ie tank/heal/3dps it can be really slow &amp; painful. Prone to wipes etc..
---
However probably all dungeons before ZF can be done with 5 dps as long as you have utility, offheals &amp; brains. I wouldn't recommend pugging this setup though.
---
I did this with a group on a pserver a couple years ago, we had a fdruid, hunter, retpal, rogue(me) &amp; mage.
---
We had a rotation where the mage would pull with sheep, hunter would take one, I'd cheap+kidney the target &amp; we'd burst it down.
---
It worked really well &amp; we were clearing dungeons in less than half the time a normal pug would.
---
The xp p/h wasn't as good as solo grinding but it was significant enough to be a decent alternative way of levelling.
---
Not K3
---
Your edits were all good and tasteful, and the music was good too even if you aren't into it.  Good job.  Not all people who create montages can have restraint in the edits and sometimes ending being a mess of poor cuts and sound--but you added the right amount of non-gameplay to it too to keep it fun.  Your credit reel was good too where you showed everyone your gear, etc.  
---
Well done!
---
Ive stopped before i started i was there when ND launched and was SOOOOOOO close to playing but i knew it would ruin the REAL DEAL.
---
buy a pc with a ryzen 3 or 5 with a gtx 1050 ti or a rx 470/570 way cheaper

---
Classic releases in Winter  
---
in Australia  
---
just want a release date for vacation time and beg it doesnt change
---
Your kind of contradicting yourself there, first you say i can log on 1/2/3 as i like, but then you say that additional, lets say in this case, "Blackrock"realms will be launched dynamicly as pop rises, which to me sounds like, when "Blackrock 1" is full or near capacity, "Blackrock 2" get launched and so on. 
---
So what happens in lets say the following example. Lets say we have a midnight launch, a mate of mine and myself have a few days off work, we start at midnight on "Blackrock 1", 2 other mates that would be joining us aren't so lucky to have a few days off and have to work so they can only join at 18:00 in the evening, by then "Blackrock 1" is Full and "Blackrock 2" is launched, Then we have our last mate to form our party of 5, since its a summer launch he's on holiday during the launch and will only be back 3 weeks after launch. Can he still roll on "Blackrock 1" or "Blackrock 2" or does he have to log on "Blackrock 3" or maybe even 4 or 5. 
---
Also you say that the timeline will be short, but where is that based on? lets say due to the midnight launch the launch servers like "Blackrock 1" are mostly filled by the more hardcore players and not a lot of tourists. Then population drop off, and subsequent mergers could take a while.  
---
Follow your heart.
---
You will not find any videos of his speed runs. He has a discord of close people who he trusts with any information in regards to how he levels and what routes he uses. A lot of which may not be possible in classic. Simple things like: Mob armor/health values may not be the same on private servers as they are in classic. 
---
elemental is the king spec in pvp, enh is utter garbage imo except at low levels 
---
I think Warlock T2 gets pretty close to the warlord set in terms of Stamina. Thats where all the other sets take a big hit.
---
Yup this works. Haven't done it with Warcraft since probably cata I think.
---
You can use anything that can run steam or steamlink at your tv. Laptop etc, Nowadays I use a raspberry pi running retropi. Just added the steam link port and it's good to go.
---
&gt; However I will not go on some crazy honor-grind to get gear for PvP.
---
while op said this idk if rogue sets fill his standards :D they gonna be hard to get
---
I completely agree with you. That's just not the path I want to follow and im ok with the shortcomings.
---
Unfortunally this Reddit doesn't like this video, and have already shut it down. Which I totally understand! so have to post it on another sub-reddit.
---
Really appreciate that you liked the video I shared to you guys! And good luck on the Launch from Blizzard them selfs!
---
G
---
And everyone who wanted time off from work will be crushed.
---
is it a joke or is it REAL? i must knoooow.
---
&gt;  I would hate to finally get the launched game in July, and have it full of (slightly) aggravating issues that aren't working right.
---
I thought we wanted authenticity? 
---
I had a lot of fun with enh under level 40 in bgs
---
Don't worry there's gonna be tons of us old farts back with you. 41 with 2 kids; my family has been sufficiently warned.
---
If its for classic you should definetely go for a Intel CPU cause of the higher IPC and chock frequenzy. A i3 8350k or perhaps i5 is more than enough and perhaps pair it with a 2060 and a nice 1440p/144hz monitor with a IPS or VA panel.
---
hunters scale well early
---
its gonna be tricky to get into a raid with all the competitions but once done u dont compete with many ( like 3) so u get pieces quicker than others. I think druid and hunter epics are the most disenchanted ones.
---
or play a priest 
---
TBH I loved 2h enhance in vanilla and bc. It was always one of my alts. It is so volatile in PvP, but you have moments where you just blow stuff up. I always had a blast with it. If you end up raiding, you should be able to get a 2 hander pretty easily and run around smashing. If you are ahead of the gear curve, you will blow shit up.
---
The furbolg shaman also plays a big part 
---
God Bless you
---
I'd be ok with that. Why retail has been spiraling downwards I still found it fun sometimes. But bfa has completely gone with the fun part for me.
---
I really hope classic gives blizz a kick in the pants about what an MMORPG is again.
---
Why is Shamans in big demand?
---
Yes, absolutely. 
---
Ahh so your toxic, elitist trash then.
---
I remember on my warlock using most of my T1 and T2 to PVP.  I didn't do the rank 14 grind for the epic pvp.  But my tier sets all had decent +Stam which is what you really wanted.  From there I just swapped in some of my raiding pieces which were dps focused and had the +SP.  So after a couple months of raiding I had a nice ghetto PVP set that was a lot of fun to run around in.  Plus it all matched so it looked good to!
---
I remember vividly, even as a warrior with a pocket healer, getting deleted by those procs. I just want that experience and I wont gimp myself in pve cos Ill go resto
---
Well, they aren't efficient XP to do while levelling after you finish all the quests, but it's still more fun to do them and witness some group drama/hilarity.
---
I wish i knew bout this! i used the wow theme on xfire tho haha this is nostalgic
---
I'm looking more specifically to fine tune the druid route, since the lv 10 quest is a big aspect to plan around. But I'm all for maximizing the efficiency period, so I'm not turning away other classes. It will be helpful to test Duo / Tri grouping in the starting area as well.
---
Blow my mind right now please. How is everything connected? Haha
---
I did post it there, but I think it got buried before catching attention.

---
Exactly.  Most people will pay for a product if it's as nice/better and as easy to use as the illegal alternative.
---
Yeah, 90% of the time, you will feel weak. But, when the stars align, you can one shot anything. As i stated, a huge part of it is being above the gear curve, and it is usually pretty easy to get a 2 hander for offspec since they are usually pretty low demand. Also, most horde raids want at least 1-2 enhance(if you were interested in raiding as enhance primary.)
---
Lmfao bro youre either an amazing troll or brain damaged. Either way im laughing pretty hard at you, so thanks
---
It really doesn't matter what race you play, seriously. A human warrior is objectively better for threat generation, but that's min maxing, all races are fine don't worry about it. If you liked a warrior in wrath, you'll probably like one in classic.  
---
As far as getting to the human starting area, its quite a journey for a night elf. I would strongly recommend doing all the quests on night elf starting zone until you get to darkshore or you will be corpse running like a mad man. If memory serves the journey goes something like this: boat from darnassus to darkshore &gt; boat from darkshore to menethil harbor &gt; run through wetlands &gt; run though loch modan &gt; run through dun morogh &gt; ironforge tram to stormwind &gt; you have arrived at your destination.  
---
Its a long run. I waited until I was around 20 to do it.
---
I think that's the case for all classes, it just affects some more than others. General knowledge is much more widespread now than it was then so I'd imagine that benefits all classes, not just warriors.

Personally, if success is there for classic , I'd rather have them fork and not go TBC, wrath, etc. Keep the original philosophy of vanilla and reuse assets from previous expansion if practical but propose something different without what we realized to be 'mistakes' over time. Rewind to end 2006 before TBC and restart from there. Let's just say classic and retail become two different games with two different paths.
---
That would be awesome.
---
You’re right, I’m stupid. I’m so sorry for being a major hypocrite.
---
No. This sub has a bunch of Toxic Elitist Assholes. They don’t care if you like aspects of modern and classic WoW, they flip their shit and mass downvote you for liking anything from modern WoW. Hell OP is one of them. He talks lesser of Modern Mythic Raiders and High end Mythic Plus runners and calls them LFRers.
---
Yeah I agree I never really use dual wield for leveling, was just making a hypothetical point, I can't think of a circumstance where you would have significantly better 1 handers.
---
As long as you understand the limitations of your spec and don't expect people to carry you through group content, then you do you.
---
Dare I ask what was in the top drawers closest to your pillows ?
---
Do what you want, but 2-3 hours a day is not what you want from your MT when progressing. It’s pretty much the one role that your guild benefit the most from having someone really push it and nolife it. Why not let someone with the time do it and play another role, or OT/MT2.
---
best pic today!
---
Sadly I never played Vanilla before, I picked the game up midway through Wrath. So eagerly wanting to play this since the demo. It'll hopefully be the closest thing to my first time playing WoW which I've never experienced anything like it since. Played a belf paladin and the starting zone was the most immersive thing ever, I got lost in that place for days and it was amazing.
---
Hunter, rogue and priest are the only classes that use full t1/t2 as their pve bis. So itll for sure be useful in pvp as well. From what I've compared the t2 set has as much if not more damage than the epic pvp set, but significantly less stamina. The warlock t2 set is also pretty close to epic pvp set.
---
I recommend just going to  [http://classicdb.ch/?itemsets](http://classicdb.ch/?itemsets)  and comparing piece by piece. Or tally the total bonus of the sets and compare.
---
I know we're all nerds here...but how about we talk about those pants?
---
I quit after classic was officially announced.
---
2-3 hours per day might be an issue if you want raid, especially as a tank.
---
Consumables play a big role in raiding and it takes a lot of time to farm them. And as tank you really don't want to be skipping out on them.
---
But in the end, it really depends on the guild that you join, their raid times and expectations.
---
Memespecs are fun. I'm seriously considering going for the ultimate memespec: Arcane Priest. Essentially, NElf priest optimised specifically for the purpose of spamming Starshards. It's a mediocre DPS ability, it isn't remotely raid viable (even if the DPS was superb, it uses a debuff slot for some reason) but it IS quite mana efficient. And there's a lot of +Arcane damage gear out there with great numbers.
---
Seems kind of limiting with only Swedes. I enjoy playing with people from all over. But mostly for me it's that things in games sound so stupid in Swedish. Maybe it's because we only translate kids stuff so it sounds childish or something.
---
good Post. same here i will have fun and to have tons of gold with 60 i have no need to rush.
---
The cool thing with Enhancement is that you have awesome 2h weapons to strive for and that's fun!
---
&gt; Humans also attach unrealistic positive bias (rose tint) to mundane memories 
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
It's one of the better pvp racials, better than anything that alliance has, but WotF and stun resist are just better overall
---
Is it good for hunters aswell? Asking for a friend.
---
Sure, but the comment I'm replying to talks about improvements in retail. "Class balance" is objectively a good thing, but retail classes suck (lack of class identity due to homogeny). So the class balance in retail isnt necessarily better than the situation in Vanilla (or previous xpacs)
---
I didn't like the impermanence of them - why invest time into something that could get taken down any day. I checked out a private server for a few weeks to relive nostalgia, but sure enough it was shut down shortly after. I'd rather trust in the legit product.
---
Ahah that’s not what I was referring to, I’m just meaning to manage expectation of the repetitive aspects
---
10 mins for lesser blessings 30 mins for greater ones i think
---
Are you thinking of ”Every Man For Himself”? That racial was added in wotlk
---
I'm predicting something containing the words "in-season aprils fools joke", not really connected to classic but still.
---
An undead warrior with BS trinket can prevent 7 fears in a row with certainty. Using Zerker Rage &gt; Wotf &gt; Zerker Rage &gt; BS trinket &gt; Bs trinket often lasts for barely long enough for a second fear &gt; Zerker Rage &gt; Wotf &gt; Zerker Rage
---
Its often not even neccessary to do this though cause you can usually pre-cast zerker rage a bit before the fears expected time and have it up in time for the next one
---
I remember this type of setup back then. Boxy and sweet hehe
---
It’s not really a good analogy. A more accurate analogy is “I used to get weed for free from my friends, but I had to deal with all the shit. I had to kick it with my shady ass dealer, it was illegal, and didn’t feel like I was doing the right thing. Now it’s legal, so instead of getting smoked out for free with shady ass people, I just buy it myself and feel way better about the whole thing”
---
Ahh I'd tried those but I can't find a way of exporting, unless there's some sort of API? If they showed item stats I could copy and paste, but the ones I've seen don't.
---
Regarding 3), I am not human, I am gnome
---
hes talking about 5 mans, not raiding.  Pallies are very poor raid tanks.  The dream is dead.
---
As a multi rank 13, multi glad, rank 1 glad Warrior, I disagree (only with PvP) that escape artist is overrated. For PvE, human is obviously better. For PvP, Escape Artist, as a warrior, is underrated. It is so, so, so, so good. I got rank 1 Gladiator (once) as a Gnome Warrior. Orc is master race for PvP in vanilla, for Warrior, and Gnome is second, in my opinion.
---
Can confirm, almost 21 when I picked up TBC (about halfway through? )
---
I get sarcasm doesn't translate well over text but good lord you people need to work on your reading comprehension.  T'was a joke dude.
---
&gt; The biggest advantage a human tank has over the other two is actually using Presence of Mind to break fear
---
???
---
That's a mage talent. If you're thinking of the racial trinket ”Every Man For Himself”, that was not a thing before LK. You don't seem to know what you are talking about.
---
This guy fucks
---
hunters scale the worst of all classes
---
Bullshit. Nothing showed that was a joke. Infact mass downvotes when ever someone mentions liking anything from modern WoW, including this thread says otherwise.
---
Also your post history is you shitting on modern WoW, so yeah.
---
I quit WoW before WOTLK came out so I cannot say what the population was like past BC but during BC the Alliance had enough people to keep world PvP interesting. I could always fill 1 full 40 man raid and have enough people to fill 1/2 of an overflow raid group.

apart from the PC this pic looks like 70s xD
---
Did you grow up to become Pyromancer?
---
I said early
---
hunters do good DPS in early content
---
myeah t2 with SL is da bomb
---
And just like that I'm transported back to my college days, I had that keyboard!!
---
Call me a noob. What movie is this from?
---
you dont "roll on blackrock x" you roll on blackrock, and you log your character into eligable realms, i.e 1/2/3 etc.
---
think of it more like an alternative to the "Server is full position in que: 3000" scenario.
---
When i say the servers are merged i mean they are never really seperate and realistically its more accurately described as "static sharding" where the sharding happens voluntarily and in the players complete control rather than chasing someone across a zone boundary only to have them disappear.
---
iirc what would happen is that instead of seeing a "Server is Full position in que: 3000" message a second instance of the server would be spun up and you could select between physical server 1 or physical server 2 but both are the same logical "Realm".
---
and when i say short i mean short, its really only there to solve the initial bottle necks of the launch. if your friend is starting on week three its probably an experience he would never know about.
---
I would not expect it to last longer than the first weekly maintenance.
---
The issue i have with traditional sharding is that it sends a message that if needed they will use it to stop servers melting or just putting in ques, and thats a huge issue if they decide to do that for say the gates of AQ/war effort, imagine how retarded it will be if suddenly there a multiple phases with seperate mob spawns while would-be scepter holders and his helpers are farming for carapaces.
---
not rogue then
---
😂😂😂
---
Agreed. Not really an exploit or anything, just crafty marketing imo!
---
I gave up on pservers with the announcement. I lost my characters twice and couldn't be bothered again. With blizz your stuff will never disappear. 
---
Ah, thought you meant that few play Shaman for some reason.
---
Thanks for the answer.  Follow up question ... does CD on zerker rage start when it is used or when the effect ends (therefore ending it immediately after fear hits would be better)?
---
What happens if I buy a 144hz laptop and externally connect it to a 100hz monitor? 
---
golem get ya gone
---
What modern features do you like? I like achievement, but it looks like very unpopular here. 
---
Hi, /u/DarkusHydranoid
---
It is not that great. Best case scenario you get to eat in peace every now and then I guess.
---
There are other PvP racials like Escape Artist and Stoneform that benefit you more.
---
Sure why not?
---
Thanks for your help!
---
What would happen if I bought a 144hz laptop and wanted to connect it to, let’s say, a 60hz monitor? Would there be tearing on the monitor or it would it be the same as the laptop?
---
I played Eve for ages. The main issue was that wow for me was always a schedule, where as Eve had to be a lifestyle for certain playstyles, and since I ran a wormhole pvp Corp.....
---
Yep thats right. Once you cast the ability the cooldown starts and you get 10 seconds of fear immunity
---
Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment. 
---
Oh man, remember when people had PC speakers?! Zaney!
---
WC2 runs like a native W10 program, it's really great. Just had a blast playing LAN with my brother and father. (Polymorphed their dragons with my mages).
---
Battle.net matchmaking doesn't work yet though for some reason.
---
WC1 is DOSbox and runs pretty MEH.
---
I'd go mad from getting to half health every mob because I sat there and took all the damage.
---
By not being a mouthbreathing moron, the game is time consuming not hard.
---
haha, I played vanilla when I was 5 or 6. Now I’M in college coming back to it!
---
&gt; Im probably one of the most hardcore vanilla pvp players out there i have played classic pvt since the first ones launched.
---
lmao
---
If you actually *need* the laptop then its not a mistake. My gf got a $1500 gaming laptop for a college course that required a more powerful one, and its fantastic. It runs any games she play extremely well.
---
That said, if it's solely for gaming, just build a budget rig.
---
Please please have a guild like Taint in Proudmoore. 
---
&gt; Also I'm pretty sure the debate is still raging on whether Battle Shout should still cause threat if the party members already have the buff.
---
Valid point. Also, it causes even more threat when you have a pet class in the party. Another thing worth noting.
---
Yup and it’s always a fun short time. Expect classic to be the same fun short time .
---
Just curious - what people use now, when they are not on their laptops?
---
I don't really play Fury, just echoing what I heard in BiS videos (my last 60 warrior was third tank, so I was trying to learn how to Fury).
---
Not sure exactly what you're referring to?
---
enh can be really fun in world pvp and pug BGs imo. As others have stated it is definitely inferior to ele pvp, but those times when your WF does proc and crit, it doesn't matter how bad the spec is you will destroy people, so if you don't mind the slot machine gameplay, it can be fun. 
---
I really like flying, I just wish they built around it like in WOTLK/TBC and MoP to an extent. 
---
I also love MoP/Legion class playstyles. Modern Demonology is really fun, and MoP Destro is ridiculously fun partially thanks to Kill Jaidens Cunning. 
---
I also like that they voice the major quests for a zone now. I love the Zandalari. I wish they were playable sooner. And some of the modern quests are really good too. Like Ruunas the Shamed.  
---
I love legion M+ BFA M+ is okay. I like the modern raids more than classic with all these crazy mechanics going on. I also like how flashy our spells have gotten. I loved Thalkiel, Knaifu, Hati and Frostmourne 2. The order halls are some of my favorite things.
---
Argus was cool. So was Surrender to Madness. 
---
I love arenas too. I love most of the model updates. The updated armor looks sweet. I love the plague doctor set I have on my Lock and Mage for PVP this season.
---
And I love not being the only warlock so I can be lazy and let someone else get the summons and cookies. 
---
Are you saying swapping between retail and Classic graphics?
---
In that case, there will be absolutely no updated graphics.
---
I just use headphones.
---
He's asking if we will have the option to toggle new or old character models.
---
Yea it would. No changes to me and to a whole lot of other folks means mount price, gameplay, raids and a plethora of other things don't change. However I support not having to look at ugly old T2 models, not deal with old racials and talents, etc.
---
"No changes" is flawed in a sense that either way classic wow is going to have changes as it is going to be a WoW iteration based at 1.12 with selective raid and content releases.
---
So no, it's somewhat more complicated than "there's going to be changes or no changes".
---
Hated the wait times on Kael Thas, sometimes waiting 45 min to log into the server. Loved the friends and guild mates waiting for you to log on.
---
Catch 22
---
Play whatever you want. Racial abilities can help but absolutely are not mandatory. 2-3 hours might be rough but you might find a group where it works. And you won't be able to get straight to the level 1 human zone.
---
Especially given how long it is going to take for AQ 40 to be released. Anything prior to AQ 40 is a complete piece of cake, not just from a gameplay standpoint, but from a numerical standpoint.
---
Play whatever you think is fun or play whatever has the OP pvp racials that actually make a huge difference ;) 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6\_U6rdjbmI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6_U6rdjbmI) Kinda shuts down the argument that hes a nazi or a racist washington post made him to be.  
---
Im not defending the bridge indicent, but man he has had that backlash, severed ties from disney and massive smear campaigns. And yes there are probably edgelords who have far right opinions watching his content but majority of them arent, including me.  
---
What people watch him for is his comedy, not his political opinions.  
---
And if he is the terrible person he is made to belive why would he do so many fund raisers himself donate money to alot of causes, highlighting the issues in the world, and never start drama with any1 unless they started it first.  
---
So no, hes not perfect but thinking that majority of people online are edgelords with nazi, sexist opinions who are out to support far right political movements is very ignorant, belive it or not, most people in this world are decent.  
---
A lot of those people watch the streamer, not the game. 
---
Greater blessings last 15 minutes but are applied to every person of the given class in the raid. Casting a buff spell 8 times every 15 minutes is not something I'd kill myself over.
---
Most are indeed around 25 years old. A while ago there was a survey held, and the ages of 22 to 28 are definitely the majority.  [https://imgur.com/a/p3Jf2#ZuuzuXZ](https://imgur.com/a/p3Jf2#ZuuzuXZ) 
---
4) most raid schedules are 4hours so .. yeah
---
People will downvote but it's true, at least for race and class combos anyway. 
---
There are a lot of things about the future we would never guess in a million years.
---
These last 10 years have been interesting.
---
Came with a pretty decent subwoofer if I remember correctly :)
---
That’s because there are people that know how important a healthy population is. 2.5K just won’t cut it, but you’ll see it yourself a few months after release. Once the majority of people hits 60, you’ll find very few players in leveling areas and the server will feel empty. These are not speculations, but facts. 
---
I connect those little headphones you use on your phone
---
this is weird. totally looks like 10 year old me. are you my long lost twin?

"here's me turning into the hunchback of Notre Dame"

I like flying too!! I haven’t played legion or BFA so I am not familiar with the new updates.

I want to play a gnome warlock in classic wow! Perhaps we can play together ٩( ᐛ )و

What do People want in premades?

---
So instead of reading the scrolling quest text, which you have to wait for anyway, people should spend /more/ time listening to someone else?
---
Quest text in Vanilla also provides useful information, because there no markers/arrows. Same with items you might need to use, or collect, since they arent shiny in Vanilla.
---
The quest text also isnt long. If your excuse is "I'm a slow reader", maybe this is a good way to passively improve yourself :)
---
On my first warrior, started on release  day, it took me 20+ days played top hit 60. 
---
That said,  I wasn't trying to level back then,  gaining levels was more accidental and I spent most of my time ruining dungeons I'd hanging out talking to people. 
---
\&gt; It's probably the most easy to implement feature of all to create an authentic experience.
---
If you have no industry developer experience with distributed applications I would recommend not saying things like this.
---
I also don't have my original account anymore, so I'd be majorly bummed if they restricted it to that
---
Unfortunately i'm a hordie at heart. Been so since WC3. I just can't finish leveling an alliance, theres always some NPC I wanna kill or ~~orphanage~~ building I wish I could light on fire with felfire.
---
The biggest mix up for me this time around will be race. I am tempted to go Orc instead of Forsaken this time.
---
Dat posture though.
---
I mean the weapons were definitely better but what set pieces were better than BWL or comparable AQ40 gear?
---
Still Alliance tho.
---
wut his videos made me want to roll druid just for the pvp, i think it looks awesome
---
Legion client = Legion requirements.

Not the only one that noticed! That mullet, that wallpaper, those lamps, that analogue photo style. The OP has got a black PC though, so definitely post 90s. Can't believe that beige was ever a thing.

MoP final patch. Or well SOO patch I think. 
---
CRTs were dope in the early days of LCD. Better colour, better viewing angles, low pixel response times. And they were all glass, so the colours popped more as well, rather than the matte coating of LCD.
---
Why do you say that MT is a bigger time commitment than OT/MT2? Just curious, I've seen a lot of people say this but I don't understand why. How much time does a MT need to put in per week?
---
To answer your question of why someone who want to rush, the point is to deck out a hero while I am on vacation so that I have my main character set up, and can level an alt possibly when I have only 10 hours a week to play.   I played classic back in the day, was 60 before BWL launched along with 2 lvl 60 alts, and have leveled to 60 on a private server, so the leveling process is a moot point for me.
---
I still do! The sound quality of the second screen TV sucks.
---
Is that one of those cat clocks where the eyes move?
---
This kid was how I imagined about 80% of the server back in the day.
---
Meant official servers being released like Classic.  Private servers are pointless to me.
---
Warriors and healers
---
Mage T2 deserves a mention because its 8/8 is easily one of the most entertaining set bonuses ever. That being said, it's pretty much better to just go for random items with actually good stats, not to mention the difficulty of acquiring 8/8 in the first place.
---
I'll be honest though, you're kind of off in the first place about asking for specifically T1/T2. Those tier sets have questionable stats and most aren't really interested in them for either PvP or PvE.
---
So rather, your question is how well do classes perform in random bits of MC/BWL/ZG gear, basically. I personally think that MC to early AQ40 geared PvP is incredibly balanced and I don't think you need to worry one way or another. Only once classes really start kitting out in full AQ40 gear does balance get a bit off, and Naxxramas kinda screws with it hard, with something like Warlock becoming incredibly busted.
---
hello fellow old person
---
Fuck that. That's the exact same argument retail blizzard used against classic. Only a bunch of hypocrites would deny the rest of us to relive TBC, which to me personally was peak WoW. I know many may disagree. 
---
To my mom's defence this was a temporary place we had whilst moving around. Buuut that mullet and everything else, not so temporary
---
see: warlock pets
---
But they can't ban jokes in chat
---
I'm with you. I know it won't be optimal, but I don't have the time to be a hardcore min/maxer. I'll be playing classic for the nostalgia and the unbalanced PvP shenanigans.
---
They’ve already said they’re using the modern client and working backwards, hence the demo having newer things that weren’t corrected back yet
---
They don’t need to do much, it’s just extremely nice to have a tank who works on getting the best gear possible, as quickly as possible. One who manages to get all his resistance gear and consumables etc. these are things that aren’t necessarily needed, but as I said; extremely nice to have and makes it much easier 
---
I think he wants to keep it secret because he wants to get the world record in Classic. 
---
That doesn't make any sense, there is no buffer hit needed that gets tossed aside.
---
96+3 = 99, and that is all she wrote.

Old PC had to give room for gaming laptop🤭
---
Kid: "the most wonderful thing ever".
---
WoW game copy: "I'm going to ruin your life, yes I will, but you will enjoy it like crack cocaine".
---
Rogues do not use full T1 or T2. There’s far better off pieces. 
---
I really do believe that the core problem was that Blizzard was always evolving and iterating on its philosophy, am attempt to improve the game without a core vision. In other words, without a constitution.
---
I believe that if there was some kind of constitution to follow, a core philosophy where Blizzard aims to add rather than rework, then Blizzard could very easily make new content for classic that everybody would enjoy. 
---
Of course, this is a discussion for the far future. We'd have to see how content starved classic is by the end of the cycle. 
---
I loved the Half-Life series but Valve really ran it into the ground with the nearly endless number of sequels.  Really Volvo, no one wants to play a brand new Half Life game every other year.
---
I'm 35 and still a millennial so...
---
How's your back these days?
---
Well that dashes my plans of doing this 1-10 FedEx route I'm looking at right now.
---
I'm curious, are there more aspects of the game we should change as well because they were flawed?
---
You forget even trash tier shaman is still shaman, and purge + earth shock / frost shock goes a LONG way. Add in grounding, tremor totem, and ghostwolf, you could be any spec and utilizing CD's / counterspell via shock/GT you are gunna do pretty alright.   
---
For as much hate as ENH (and rightfully in many ways) gets, it's still a great pvp spec in that as long as you maintain a good, slow 2h weapon and stack some decent crit %, you can still hold your ground in almost any 1v1 in the game. Warrior, rogue, you can easily contest them with burst, casters will have a nightmare except for SL warlocks / other well geared locks (even then, purge VW bubble is big).   
---
Being kited is real though. 
---
20% to win a slot machine is pretty damn high imo
---
Upgrades lol. We saw an ad in Best Buy and both went to buy that laptop plus WoTLK collectors edition 😃. Before that, I used to get 25 frames a second in Shatt
---
Social network... Vanilla? \*stares into the distance, sees fireworks, hears circus music, sees dollar signs, and hears slot machine jackpot sounds\* Time to seek venture capital for my LinkedIn for WoW startup!
---
The point of #nochanges is to advocate for no changes. If changes are made in spite of that then it's not much we can do but we should not under no circumstances ask for changes to the game like altering the realm caps or rebalance classes.
---
Definitely Hunter. All their tier sets are excellent for pvp. 
---
Some other classes that have good tier sets: 
---
T2 Warlock
---
T1 Rogue
---
T2 Mage
---
It’s important to note that only Hunter aims for full 8/8 Tier sets because the set bonuses are all good. Most other classes only aim for maybe 4/8 tier pieces and the rest being off pieces. 
---
depends on how early you are speaking. If you get t1 before you can get to rank10 than obviously most pieces are good for every class.
---
Well if your experienced in vanilla you’d know dungeon spam was inefficient. Quest do dungeons once when you have quest for them. 
---
Retail really forges this mindset about endgame gear doesn´t it? You will soon know what a real mmo is like. 
---
Did they fix this early BC? Cus I ran pvp with a lock and an enhance shammy as an arms warrior and it was a lot of fun. 
---
Someone should do a poll. At least somewhere before launch.
---
Source? I assume this will be the case but I haven't seen anything concrete.
---
Hyacinth Macaw, I got one and didn't know how valuable it was. After going to Stormwind with it flying around my mismatched noob gear, everyone was whispering me about where I got it etc. I actually don't even remember where... but one was selling in the AH for 6000 gold. If I only knew...I would've been rich!
---
Yes.  I barely remember any details about outdoor zones during leveling but loved running dungeons.  It was a contained experience with clear rewards.  It always felt good to down a final boss after 2 or 3 hours and turn in a few quests, and get a shiny new blue.
---
far be it from me to tell you how to play, but you did ask for advice, so... do the dungeons op!!!
---
there are two important things you need to realize. one, this isn't retail. the leveling is designed to be enjoyable and to be as much a part of the game as endgame content. trying to speed past it as a new player does a huge disservice to both you and the game.
---
two, if you're really worried about ''falling behind'' in leveling, you shouldn't be. the only people you're going to ''fall behind'' are the minmaxers who only care for the endgame, and who have been perfecting their leveling route since private servers were a thing. and you were never going to be ahead of them anyways (no offense intended, as i would be ''behind'' too) this subreddit is mainly for these very passionate people, so you have to take what's said here with a grain of salt.
---
if it's simply that you're worried you'll miss out on endgame content if you take too long getting to max level, that's no problem at all. even if you don't ding 60 until blackwing lair comes out, you won't miss the chance to have fun doing molten core, onyxia, and all the level 60 dungeons, and so on and so forth. there is no ''play the patch, discard the rest'' mentality.
---
but to actually answer your question... yes, they're worth it. the quests will give you plenty of exp, and even if you can't find them all no doubt a group member will share them with you. dungeons are extremely fun to do, give you the opportunity to meet people and make friends, and learn your class. and yeah those sick blues are totally worth it
---
especially in the 20-40 range there are a lot of AMAZING dungeons, like shadowfang keep and scarlet monastery.
---
tldr; yes it's worth it, please don't skip them. please, please, as a new player, do not focus on minmaxing or farming your pre-bis. just play the game.
---
Countdown to Classic and Frostadamous are the only ones I respect and listen to. But yes, they are doing great work.
---
They have said multiple times that they were going for authentic. This wouldn't be authentic. Also we know none of the other updated models will be in classic like quilboars or elementals, so chances are slim/non existent. Thank goodness.
---
Not adding an opinion one way or another, but a lot of people play with the Instant Quest Text option that's in the Interface tab.
---
A voidwalker will help for sure, but the point I was originally trying to make is rogues are hard for warlocks to beat. Humans provide an advantage against rogues so they're a good choice compared to gnomes which don't benefit the lock as much in that scenario. Lock trinket doesn't remove stun. That's one of the reasons orc is so good for warlocks. Human is good for a similar reason, if you can prevent a rogues opener, you're at a significant advantage. 
---
Yea i mean it's fine if people want to do that. To me levelling is by far the best part about vanilla. That and dungeons. I have many 60s, on private servers and retail, but the endgame is always the same for each one, only the journey is different.
---
I think the least developed and fun part of vanilla by far is early raiding. I don't see how anyone could disagree that Onyxia/MC is really not up to par compared to the levelling, dungeons, and overall world. That's why I don't understand why people say they don't like levelling but they like raiding.
---
The face of the Alliance.
---
I think there was a total of 11 of these including the two you do for an actual quest, which probably amounted to something like 15k experience for just running down the beach.  
---
Yeah, the WF procrate is pretty high, but for it to really 1 shot people you need at least some of the hits to crit as well, so while it's 20% chance for WF proc, it's a bit lower for a destructive 1 shot WF
---
Everyone commenting on my posture :)
---
Yes my back is fine. I'm 193 cm so some everyday situations are a hassle. Except for wow and Heroes 3 I just play videogames = couch = least Quasimodo. And I actually stand at my daily job in front of my desk which is better for my back 
---
Thanks for all your worries though
---
Yeah but won't the competition for kills make questing less efficient? 
---
Rogues absolutely use full t2 if swords. And only swap out a couple pieces if using daggers. Which I would argue aged core leather gloves arent as important for pvp daggers since its more about cc and burst than white swings. On top of t2 gloves giving disarm immunity which is pretty big.
---
And in MC they use t1 except for 4 pieces. 2 of which are t2, and again aged core leather gloves. You can easily get away with just going for full t1/t2 as a rogue.
---

---
Yes MC/Onyxia is boring, but the limited time I have once vacation ends can be spent with guildies doing UBRS/LBRS/Scholo/Strat and so on, which are all superior to the leveling dungeons anyways.
---
So just counting soul shards?
---
You poor paladins with your 10 min blessings. Try a shaman.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/items](https://classic.wowhead.com/items)
---
You could also swap in a weapon during a cast or during a GCD to not get affected by the GCD from the gear swap.
---
I gear-swap pretty excessively on my current server. Doing stuff like only switching in a shield for a shield slam or equipping a shield when I drop to low hp while not interrupting my rotation. If used correctly it is a really big power boost and gives a whole new level to melee/tank gameplay.
---
It should definitely be in classic.
---
Yes they've said authentic, but that's not really what I was looking for. They could mean they want authentic gameplay, which wouldn't be effected by say, the Cataclysm added HD textures. It's open to interpretation, and not a solid answer one way or the other. :\
---
I really felt this as a mage.  I almost always had to polymorph in dungeons while leveling 1-70, but barely used it at all in Wrath.  It was damn near impossible to pull threat as well starting with Wrath.
---
It's weird that shaman is so popular, considering totems a b\*tch to manage.
---
At 36, I feel this very much so. I started on a private server about a year ago, and about half the private server people I've played with are under 25. I was old enough to drink legally when Vanilla launched and these kids were still in elementary school. One of my guildies now on a private server is 19 which makes me feel even older.
---
This is pretty silly let me get this straight you only have half your bag space running around just to have some shadow resist gear to (hopefully) equip on when you see a warlock or priest LOL. The warlock or priest if at all knows their class would simply use another type of magic....plus a good lock doesn't even need fear 1v1. 
---
I think they will announce that they are adding in Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans, along with updated player models and LFR.
---
Good question. For some reason I have this memory in my head where they talked about having toggle-able character models in Classic, with the argument: "If you don't want new models, just switch them off".
---
I don't think they've talked about it since?
---
Wouldn’t the latter be preferred? Please don’t downvote but if I’m in pvp and in realistically poly someone first, I’d want them to be polymorphed and not me
---
Sharding players in and out of my world - effectively turning them into anonymous NPCs -  is the most inauthentic experience compared to original WoW, where every realm was a small town and everybody knows your name.  
---
Sharding is one of the reasons I stopped playing WoW. Why should I care about another player I only see for 10 seconds?  
---
I lost my community to sharding (and LFG tool). I stopped caring about this game when I realized I was just another anonymous ghost to other players.  
---
Sharding is inauthentic to original WoW in every way.  
---
Same as finding one of the 'hidden' spy reports in Loch Modan.
---
Used to be my first target when hitting the Loch to grab as many as I could for the XP.
---
No. Wasting 4 hours in WC for 35-50% of an exp bar is not efficient. Competition isn’t a big deal you’ll be fine. 
---
The curvature of the spine, that rat claw grasping at the mouse. This guy could wipe your premade with ease.
---
It would be fine.
---
However now that I have seen you mention at least twice you want to connect to an external monitor, is there any real reason you need or want a laptop? Because like others have said, build a PC for much cheaper with MUCH better performance.
---
\*shits\*
---
Also us oldies don't get upvotes for sharing pictures. And our parents didn't come to our house to take pics of us playing, anyway.
---
IMO for warlocks 5pc T2 is better for PvP because of the added pet resistances. 
---
Tip 4 is me. Havn't played it in a couple years besides logging in to look at spells from trainers. I'm so excited.
---
I legitimately don’t know, but why *does* it matter? Why would I want my CC casted before someone else (even if a fraction of a second) register at the same time as my opponent in pvp?
---
That's just the natural way of things. Now we have far more resources  and almost everyone knows how to access them - at least the people visiting this sub know that. Those resources are far more quanitative in nature and their quality is higher backed by at least a decade of research and data collected via private servers, although that data may not be close to the one of the official Classic servers will be.
---
People know how to maximize threat generation with the given gear. We know every nook and cranny of any dungeon and pull in them. In the end it will always come down to the individual player and how the group members behave.
---
As I said in another thread, I don’t think “instant respawns” or dynamic respawn impacted his final time that much if he did use grinding with dynamic respawn for his route. Dynamic respawn is...dynamic, which means it’s only in effect when there are a lot of people within a certain area. It’s inherently counter-productive to be in an area with a lot of people and if you’re server first 60 you’re getting ahead of the pack/hunter is completely capable of being ahead of the pack fairly quickly (in relation to the overall time of the leveling process) without it. I can’t say for sure what he used/didn’t use so take it as you will but in regards to his time (3 days 7 hours) and seeing what others and myself have done on repack servers (which, just to clarify, is in no way a perfect comparison to a fresh server launch or how Classic launch will be), I think we will definitely see times from Hunters approaching that speed.
---
I plan on hacking the game for my Horde guild to have dwarves.
---
I agree with this sentiment entirely. Leveling your first toon is a bit like college: kind of a chore sometimes but worth enjoying while it lasts.
---
No I'm saying people on the sub will need to converge on a minimum of 6-8 servers.
---
Because then Vanilla PvP wouldn’t be authentic and there’s certain things like gouging a mages blink etc that won’t be possible without it. Also No changes 
---
I actually understand what spell batching is now because of their post.  I'm pretty excited for that!
---
A lot of them are!
---
They haven't really addressed sharding yet but the release announcement should be next month if they keep giving up news every week.
---
My body is ready to face the frostbolts to my face lol. But yeah, I shall tryhard as much as possible :)))
---
Edit:
---
I feel like I should elaborate a bit further.
---
There's nothing wrong with gaming on a laptop , but you will get more bang for your buck with a PC.
---
Differences between a 2k PC &amp; 2k laptop:
---
The hardware in the pc will be 1.5x - 2x times better than in the laptop (it's more expensive to make the hardware "compact")
---
A laptop gets HOT whilst doing heavy tasks (playing WoW at ultra with a few addons in a 40man raid), this means your hardware will detoriate quickly. Lifespan will be 4-5 years until something probably breaks.
---
You can easily upgrade your PC in a few years , want a new gpu? Want a bigger SSD? New RAM? You can buy it , watch a youtube video and install it yourself.
---
Not so evident with a laptop.
---
Me and my gaming group have had this discussion multiple times in the past year &amp; we all ended up buying gaming PCs put together by a pensioner who does it as a hobby. Price range €600 - €2k and everybody is happy as larry.
---
The ONLY reason I would recommend a gaming laptop is if you are a nomad or travel alot for work &amp; want to be there for all the raids. 
---
I guess I don’t understand the concept, but I’m glad everyone is excited about it
---
Yes absolutely, I'm saying the the guy above said "whichever" for this sub, in reality it'd need to be a lot more than 1, even for this subreddit alone. 
---
Never seen this.

Dude you're one stubborn head.. Have you played on a 2.5K server? Have you played on a 5K server? Have you played damn, on a 10K server? You never have so you obviously can't tell the difference, so let me explain. First, there's 10K players. That's a clusterfuck and the game wasn't designed to handle so many players. Then we have another extreme, 2.5K players. During the first month or two, the game feels great! A lot of people are on their way to 60, zones aren't crowded, world PvP is happening. But during those two months, a lot of people quit. You wouldn't notice, because the server feels alive. And after those two months a lot of people are already level 60. People that weren't as fast start to notice how much emptier the zones they're leveling in are. Finding a group for Uldaman suddenly becomes a huge problem. You want to do an elite quest in the area, but there's no one on the quest atm, so you can't. After 1 year the life changes for the 60s as well. In the morning it's impossible to find a group for that 5-man that you wanted to visit. PvP queues are suddenly not instant as they used to be and you'll be waiting 30 minutes for a pop only to get matched against that one premade. You're in for some world PvP? Well, maybe once every 15 mins you'll stumble into a loner passing through BRM.
---
5-6K cap would solve these issues. It is not as much as it sounds, believe me. **Zones will be packed at the release either way, try to think about the future of the server.**
---
This is true
---
speed matters a bit but let's be honest [they're](https://imgur.com/mZganP4) [really](https://imgur.com/bEW5KFN) [not](https://imgur.com/UJF55ir)

Dude, awesome sideburns! Best pic I've seen today
---
A special type of person will continue to play private servers after classic is released
---
You should never ever be looking down at your monitor.  Especially to that degree it must have killed your back.
---
Blizzard are an enigma to me these days. I don't think we'll have a release date any time soon though. 
---
&gt;Level 39 WSG twinking
---
Yeah man that was the best bracket IMO. You rock out your Ardent Custodian and feel like such a boss.
---
Hmm... I am under the impression that as a [H] Warlock, the top challengers are : Other warlocks, shadow priests, rogues, warriors - everything else seems very manageable except maybe a very well geared marks hunter who kites perfectly in owPvP. Rogues are good in that if you don't have soul link, or void out, they can 1 shot you probably. But a little bit of pvp gear, VW prepped out - god forbid you're demon spec - rogues aren't the absolute bane of warlocks. They have their own pretty separate tier in terms of power, not many things actually compete with equal preparation. If you aren't SL, and you don't have VW, you should prob be rocking a succubus to take that rogue off you asap and let you reset via healthstone / bandages.
---
For this reason, I think Undead Warlocks are actually the strongest (also coolest model in my opinion) due to being very strong vs opposing warlocks and priests - which are definitely worth considering.
---
Sooooo ..... EBAY?  Did you just actually say that?  WTF man!! It's 2019!! 
---
They're very worth it for being enjoyable and making some friends so when they are objectively needed to get some decent gear at 60 you have some people to ask to come that may only be semi-interested in that particular dungeon but willing to run it with you because they like you. On the other hand, if you keep rerolling characters I feel pretty unmotivated to do the very early dungeons multiple times because for a lot of classes it feels pretty garbage since your class hasn't hit it's stride yet. Anything like 20's and up might be an xp waste even with quests but it's not that drastic unless your group is horrible and if you're a melee class and you get a blue weapon that is a big help.
---
A lot of vanilla dungeons are just great though and I feel like you're missing out on just refusing to do any of them. I still remember exact runs from a lot of characters from retail vanilla, not all of them but a pretty substantial number. They were just enjoyable.
---
It's not good for DPS hunters because you won't be taking melee hits most of the time.
---
For Hunter tanks it's still not great because you'll be avoidance tanking, so it'll still have poor uptime.
---
The Demo was just  a demo and not a beta. We only had access to 2 zones.
---
It’s all coming back to me, months of UBRS trying to get my lightforge spaulders so I could be a ‘real’ Paladin...
---
it hurts just looking at it
---
Yea, you want about 20% crit rate, and then you're just over 50% of having one crit out of the 3 hits. Pretty solid, and a reason why one WF is often deadly combined with a stormstrike + earth shock (and even better, an added fire nova totem. RIP mana though). 
---
Get a good priest friend for those dispels baby, and a bunch of swiftness potions lol, or free action
---
&gt;You can see where the keyboard sits on a roll out plane slightly under the desk.

---
Nice, had the same chair!
---
i agree with the people saying don't get a laptop unless you want to shell out for a gaming one, but you don't need overkill either. tbh i assume what you have now would play the game fine, but i also understand the urge to upgrade. here are some things i would look out for:
---
-make sure you have 8GB of RAM minimum. if i'm right in assuming that at most you'd have a game and maybe some music and/or a few browser tabs open, 8GB is fine, go 16GB if you plan on using it for heavier tasks.
---
-get a ssd. GET A SSD! most cases will have more than one hard drive bay, it's easy to buy a bigger hard drive for storage and to buy a small, cheap ssd for your os, games, ect. you won't see an improvement just in wow, but in anything you put on the ssd. say goodbye to loading screens.
---
-getting a good graphics card and a good cpu is important, but you don't want one to be massively better than the other. a lot of people will recommend you an i7 processor and something like say, GTX 1060 graphics card. i think the i7 is a little overkill imo. at the moment i can run wow and less demanding games just fine on an i3 and GT 730, but i understand that you want it all to be ultra and totally free of lag. vanilla wow isn't super graphically demanding, so (just imo) i'd recommend an i5 if you want a better cpu. if you can get a 1060 on sale that's great and even better for other games, but you won't be screwed if you get a cheaper card. just read the reviews. 
---
i can't in good consience recommend buying a prebuilt computer as they usually cheap out on important parts, like the power supply. i had that happen to me recently. if you don't want to build it yourself, it's definitely worth it to just buy parts and use a little of that budget to pay somebody to assemble it for you.
---
this was sort of long winded and probably not helpful, but i'd recommend asking the guys at r/buildapc about part/build recommendations, or you can go on pcpartpicker.com yourself to look at parts, it automatically filters out anything incompatible with the rest of your parts which is a godsend tbh. good luck!
---
I would say about 25 is right if not a little bit young. I was just about a teenager in vanilla wow, now I'm nearly 27. Seems very common based on what I've read. Wow was our first MMO. 
---
15 minutes were the greater blessings.  Prior to those they were 5 minutes.
---
And the other all-time BiS trinket for druid tanks is the Mark of Tyranny : https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny
---
It's from a quest in UBRS. Druid tank itemization sure is wonky. I really hated having to skip on blackhand's breadth in order to tank, but if you want to tank as a druid...
---
That decisions will be so guild-specific it's kind of impossible to speculate.  It will come down to whoever the officers think is the most deserving and who will help progression the most.
---
I hated when the added the disenchant option. Like fuck you nibba you don't get  mats just because you puged with an enchanter
---
With a good team most vanilla dungeons can be done in an hour or 1,5 hour.
---
Yes
---
Sharding in Classic
---
Right-Click Report in Classic
---
PvP in Classic
---
(Maybe Crossrealm in Classic)
---
(Maybe 1.5 AV in Classic)
---
(Maybe Loot Trading in Classic) to remove it.
---
Depends on what you want to do.
---
For instance: a mage might have a reason to carry around 5 set netherwind, but it will only be 'bis' for a few situations.
---
This extends into SP vs. stam values. Sure, Stam is generally going to be king for most WPvP and having r13 gear on a mage is going to beat out most gear until T3 for that reason, but throwing on higher spell damage / crit pieces if you're a fire mage for WSG weekend is definitely more effective for the role.
---
That's part of the beauty of vanilla- the actual BiS list (at least for mage) depend so much on the situation.
---
They already addressed loot trading though.
---
Yes enhancement shaman was much better in BC onwards. 
---
Lol, more like I've played other classes after and pretty much never been touched by enhancement because it's dogshit spec. I'm not arguing with you to try to prove you're wrong, but other people who didn't play vanilla and are looking for what class to play and hear false info by people like you saying it's viable to play enhancement and then they find out at 60 it's tied for the worst pvp spec in the entire game along with a prot warrior are going to be disappointed.
---
Maybe to remove it.
---
Yes they can but they aren’t lucrative for exp without quest. 
---
It’s sometimes immersion breaking. Like committing mass genocide because they murdered Mankirk’s Wife. Seems a bit harsh. 
---
Do NOT buy a laptop. I repeat, DO NOT BUY A LAPTOP. I bought a $2500 laptop and it was a huge mistake, laptops suck, they will always suck, they are NOT worth the money, do not try to justify or rationalize it anymore, they are not worth it.
---
Invest in a proper desktop WITH INTEL/NVIDIA HARDWARE and never look back.
---
Thats just dumb though, they already changed their decision once.
---
check out the Walmart (no really) Overpowered laptops...seems like a great deal for them and they look decent as well. Linus Tech Tips (among a number of others) have done reviews on them and recommend them at their price point. 
---
Definitely not warriors, Might and Wrath are entirely PVE tanking oriented
---
I run wow at 144hz on ultra settings with a $600 PC from bestbuy. You are VASTLY overestimating how much computing power you need for what you want. 
---
I think you're right. I remember mine came in the box.
---
We first going into MC as an Orc warrior, is obsidian edged blade bettter than Double Dal rend's?
---
&gt; Have you played on a 2.5K server?
---
Yes, for two years straight between 2004 and 2006 and it was perfect. There is zero reason to make changes to the game based on pure speculation.
---
Full mara (blue, purple, princess if I remember correctly) runs was my favorite pre endgame content. That run takes several hours and youre more than likely to wipe a few times if you arnt careful.

I believe you are referring to graphic-toggle (water, landscape etc.), no? I don’t recall Blizz having confirmed any updated character models.

They kind of addressed it.. said they were doing it in starting zones for launch and for a couple weeks after to ensure every has a smooth experience. Pretty sure that is addressing sharding. I also think the community has adapted to that answer is people will be fine with it

Haven't addressed it properly, we could argue days on what can be considered a "starting zone". 
---
Look at that setup. You had it all figured out
---
It’s funny that computer desks used to generally be smaller than today even though the monitors took up so much more space lol
---
hahaha I was the same but I was Horde so I begged my guild to run me through WC because I thought leveling was such a chore. And I was a druid
---
Man I'm pretty certain the context suggested I was kidding.  Your inability to still figure it out is kind of proving my point.  
---
The only person who brought in the term 'plague that needs to be eradicated' was some criticizing my tone, to whom I explained I wasn't trying to just single out raid finders.  I then ended my post with a "But yes you're right they are a plague that needs to be eradicated.", which was very VERY clearly a tongue-in-cheek remark.  
---
Days? I think maybe 5 minutes. Is it northshore abby,  elwynn forest or through westfall? I'm pretty sure most people agree all of the initial 1-10 zones.
---
They've addressed it enough other than confirming exactly what they're going to do. 
---
The videos were mostly world pvp. I think it was deep resto 
---
Funny thing is i just bought that same 60 day timecard two days ago lool
---
r/battlestations
---
That's precisely how I imagine (undead) warlock players. 
---
If you plan on raiding you will be expected to respecc multiple time a week for different dungeons...
---
&gt; It really doesn't matter what race you play, seriously. A human warrior is objectively better for threat generation, but that's min maxing, all races are fine don't worry about it. If you liked a warrior in wrath, you'll probably like one in classic.
---
&gt; 
---
You can actually swim south at menethil harbor. stay along the coast, and eventually you'll zone into Dun Morough on the outside of the zone. then you can drown and rez inside of it and tram from there.
---
Eu =/= europe
---
I just know whatever April fools joke they say during classic is going to piss me off. Even though I know it's not real lol.
---
Literally nothing you said shows sarcasm, and your post history of just bashing modern wow hurts you more than anything.
---
gurls play wow? if only i’d known sooner /s
---
*Mindcontrols you off a cliff*
---
You don't have Gravity Resist gear
---
getting a blue from a dungeon and feeling how it impacts your character is the best feeling. Blue items are indeed BLUE, not like blues from BFA which has the same stats as green items.
---
1 blue item is a big deal in your character, so it feels great when you get one, even at low lv.
---
Shoot man, I made more female friends through WoW than I did in real life during those years haha
---
I mean, if it's all you have you need them.
---
1. Dont worry about it. Everybody loves tanks.
---
2. Very easy to do. Mojority of guild will fit that describtion. 
---
3. Better to go with a guild and you wont have a problem finding one. Raid PUG is not that common in Vanilla and usualy only for older content.
---
4. Raids can sometime last longer than 2-3 hours but with 14-21 hours a week you have no problems prepairing.
---
5. The difference is tiny for a tank and not worth it. If you are going to DPS the difference is larger.
---
6. No. Dont worry about that.
---
7. Hard to say. 
---
8. Dont do that it will be a pain in the ass to do. 
---
I don't have my original vanilla one, but I still have my current live one since TBC. Also, I'm really confused as to why both me and the person I replied to got downvoted. Either people agree with me or him and that's fine, but, this is strange lol.
---
What do you mean?
---
It's scary how much Blizzard are gunning for accuracy, even to the point of reworking spell batching to how it previously worked in Vanilla WoW.
---
Who do you think owned the houses that 12 year old kids lived in in 2004?
---
At what season was Donna Pinciotti rocking a black hair ?
---
Wait, you had a webcam, TOO?
---
/8 you can have a mage port ya to silver moon at level one. Or have a lock summon you to the human start town. 
---
I’m sorry but the guys voice In this video really bugs me for some reason. 
---
And y'all wonder why it took us so long to get organized in MC, through MC and why when we did TM/SS our screens moved like snails.
---
Ah I see, thanks.
---
You’re definitely correct about that, however we shouldn’t underestimate how much of that inefficiency was due to finding a group, getting to the instance, wiping and having to run back to the instance and then back to where you were. If you’re with a group of friends you’re going to reduce a lot of that inefficiency. 
---
&gt;It's open to interpretation
---
It's not. They said authentic and left it there, which makes the sense, too. Doing anything but that would end in a million people screaming about how they want it to be "their Classic", how "they remembered it". This way it's a common ground for everyone. 
---
This is also why every single change has been debated and screamed about to death (because each and everyone is important). 
---
If you want the new models you can swap in the existing ones (from Retail). 
---
in real what?
---
that's probably true but it's still pretty marginal, then you also have cases like rhok delar being nearly identical to the r14 ranged weapons
---
I think it's pretty apparent at least that even if these items were available at launch it wouldn't disrupt much of anything considering the time investment and natural bottleneck on how many can be obtained. 
---
Questing will still be faster.
---
However I will break from tradition here and say that if there’s five of you and you’re coordinated and you know what you’re doing you’re going to reduce a lot of the historic inefficiencies of dungeons, so I think they’ll be a decent alternative. 
---
If you want absolute top speed though, questing will still be your best bet.

I played enh shaman in classic and tbc. I've tried to talk myself into maining a more viable DPS spec in classic like mage or warlock and I can't bring myself to do it.  There's something about the versatility and feeling like you can do it all.  Whether you're surviving any situation with earthbind totem or stoneclaw, or even off tanking in dungeons.  I love the spec and I can't wait to reroll in classic.
---
Paladin huh? Well fuck you!
---
I was 30 in Sept 2006 when I started. Now I'm 43. Both me and my (now 21 year old) played since then.
---
Def plenty of us old people ready for this summer. My family has been warned as well.
---
This is on a private server with bugs that allow for that type of dps.
---
Awesome setup lol. How did that laptop not overheat??
---
Please have enough latency for front stabs. Thanks
---
I was actually going to mention how many +dagger skill items there are. You can technically get up to 20 dagger skill over cap.
---
You are not alone.  
---
I look at it like this, WoW is their Super Mario World.
---
Well if it is really bad with competing for kills, yes. It is probably 3 times slower to lvl in dungeons so the competition has to be absolutely brutal. 
---
I have never tested dungeon method of leveling but when ever i help a freind do a dungeon my time to lvl increases 3x. 
---
Depends on if it's WSG or AB, but mostly MS warriors and holy paladins, priests and resto or ele/resto shamans if they have the gear for it. Some warlocks and mages and if WSG a druid. In MC/BWL tier reck bomb paladins that have a decent amount of +healing gear is nice too. They just heal with a 2-hander on and try to get stacks off of low crits and just one shot someone and go back to healing and BoF'ing people. Good hunters also, but a lot of times they'd rather bring another equally geared mage if they can find one.
---
People think rogues are pvp-awesomeness in vanilla, but really it was TBC when they were broken beyond all measures. I played one during both in retail and I was just amazed when they gave rogues shadowstep without taking away cloak of shadows or at least putting it in like deep assassination tree. They were so insanely OP in TBC it was a joke lol. You could pull two class specs out of a hat for a 3's team and then just add a shadowstep rogue and at worst it was a tier 2 team comp. 
---
Have fun and enjoy the first days! If questing to more fun then Quest, if not then dungeon. 
---
For exp its questing, but for fun as a Group i guess its dungeon because of items and happiness that your Group getting reward.
---
You look like my elementary school friend Devin who always got in trouble and taught me the word "pecker" lol
---
All these old pics being posted today are fantastic, love it.

Invest in a 12 button Naga MMO Mouse or something similar then get good at using it. I had a Naga mouse for a long time and never really took the time to get good with it but once I did it was like taking the training wheels off my mouse game. It made a massive improvement to my speed and utility, you have 12, 24, 36 buttons available to you under your thumbs if you include Alt, Shift, Ctrl spellbars. This frees up your other hand to funnel Doritos into your mouth. 
---
Mofo my name is Sage too...
---
#gorgeous....talking about that CRT but you’re pretty easy on the eyes too
---
Hunter for sure. T1 with Rhokdelar is really strong. 
---
Yes. IMO 24” or 27” are ideal
---
PVE scaling isn't the same as PVP scaling. Hunters do huge burst, they just don't have the mana to constantly use multishots in raids for 4-5+ min.
---
You shouldn't have issues with warriors. You have enough self healing as a lock to outlast a warrior. Hunter aren't a problem either. They can't do anything to stop your dots, fear or death coil. Spriest is difficult, but there aren't that many of them and you have tools to deal with them unlike rogues. Your trinket dispels fear, you have curse of tongues, mana burn, self healing, purges/dispels, an interrupt and instant cast burst through nightfall, shadow burn and Conflag. Lock v lock, the undead will definitely have the advantage, but if we're talking strictly bgs and WPvP there aren't any undead on the alliance side so you don't have to worry about that. In a lock v lock duel, the undead will have the advantage. The orc stun resist passive is just very strong especially for a class that doesn't have a way to remove stuns. Undead are good too, and like you said they look better, but they're racial doesn't have as much impact against their biggest threat, rogues. 
---
Ok ty
---
My GF bought me that expansion as a gift. If only she knew what she was doing! 😂 
---
The question is early game, T1, and T2. Hunters are very strong then. 
---
Your back must be f*cked! Unless you made it unscathed cause of youth!
---
Will not differ from the experience only means it feels the same
---
Literally supposed to be a rolled back version of the game that has already been live. (And they're having trouble doing that!) They need to take their heads out of their asses and release the game already. 
---
"Authentic" clearly doesn't mean #nochanges, as we've seen before.
---
Druids are really nice in pvp when they and everyone are in like blues or MC-only. After that other classes start doing so much more damage and you have to just peel and heal crazy amounts as you trickle them down so they're just really good for dueling and world pvp at that point. Also they're garbage healers since burst is so high in vanilla and no real HoT protection. At least as a druid yourself you can travel form and LoS peel, other classes you just toss them a regrowth and rejuv and half a second later they are dead.
---
Changes to what exactly? Saying to "vanilla wow" is incredibly vague.
---
That fucked up 90s style posture... awesome
---
People are probably inferring sexism where there isnt any.
---
You look goofy and happy. Did the Draenie make her way to Teldrassil? Or the other way around. 
---
I hope you do that, because that is one of the dumbest ideas i've ever heard, i love it. 
---
Please post the conversation of you trying to convince your raid leader to give you a starshard debuff slot too. Don't settle.
---
Yep good thing for your grades. WoW definitely had an impact on my grades in high school. I'd say I was properly addicted - no homework, no studying was too important to take me away from WoWing. 
---
WSG gods
---
Yup definitely hunter. Rhokdelar is also amazing, and if you happen to get the xbow from BWL you will be set until Naxx for weapons 
---

Hi OP
---
I’m currently building a PC for classic and my budget is basically the same as yours.
---
The best processor I found for our situation is the Intel i7-9700k.
---
From the research I’ve done, it’s more about GHZ per core instead of the amount of cores.

It's the only option really. Blackhand's is good, but there are other options like Earthstrike/HoJ. Tyranny has no alternative.
---
Damn I love vanilla Druid with all my heart, I even consider myself some kind of expert on druid leveling since I leveled SEVERAL Druids (two of them to the 60, another two to 48+ and a few other, like three or four to level 20+/30+) on private servers, but hell, I won't play them again in Classic. I will stick to the Night Elf master race tho, once you play having Shadowmeld you just can't go back to other races, it's just too good. NE Shadow Priest will be my choice this time. Deep respect for all Druid players, it's not an easy path, but for sure a unique one. Also, I loved so much the "druid pact" (don't gank another Druid) or whatever you call it , it's such a sweet and special roleplay feature that surrounds the class. It always seemed to me that the majority of Druid players embraces this pact, countless times I was helped by opposite faction Druids while killing elites or groups of mobs and vice versa. Now that I wrote this I feel like having a Druid alt.
---
You suck at fact checking then.
---
Ah so it's more about dedication. That makes sense, especially at the beginning. I really want to tank too but seeing the comments in here I've been questioning whether I can put enough time in. Thanks for explaining the logic! 
---
My first time in a dungeon was Deadmines and I rolled need on everything because greed seemed like the morally worse option.  3/4 of the way through I finally noticed the very unhappy party chat. 😬

Mmmmm I remember sitting in the front of the line at walmart during release. 
---
Lol. Good one
---
Coefficients. Consecration only recieves 33% of spellpower over 8 seconds. With 800 spellpower, that equates to and extra *GASP* 33dps. All spells have coefficients.
---
Man, that looks COMFY!
---
Hi, /u/Cliansoul
---
The MT will be the best geared tank, will get Thunderfury first and will always be the person the guild invest the most into. 
---
If the MT cant always make almost every raid then that's a complete waste of gear, and the guild should not be investing into that player at all.
---
You've got the gaming stance down pat. 
---
Varrak's back pedaling is so cringe worthy
---
Aw I was 11 or 12 back then :)
---
T2 warlock is an absolute machine. At that point, and if you mix in a little ZG gear when it's out, Warlock becomes a PvP god without the big pvp pieces.
---
He's going the distance. He's going for speeeeed
---
What is up with the ubrs key? What expansion added the equip and use thing? Ehat do they even do? 
---
DENDI?!
---
The MT have to be the best geared tank, get the best consummables and be there for every raid. If the MT isn't here for the last raid out you basically can't do it unless it has been on farm for months. Also until you get both binding (can be fast or can take years depending on how unlucky you are) you have to attend 100% of the MC, if the binding drop while you aren't here there will be lot of drama.
---
The MT is the most important role of the guild so it will be the most reliable and the best tank of the guild.
---
Usually there are quite a few quests for each dungeon. So you enter a dungeon with 5 quests, you are constantly grinding for exp inside, and once finished you get a huge boost from all the quests... Plus you end up with alot better gear, which in return helps you level faster elsewhere.
---
I think its definently worth it to to dungeons, and is better than just regular questing&amp;grinding. 
---
Fury warriors be like the man in the iron mask
---
So you have no idea lol 
---
Happy face, Happy memories! 
---
I am 27 and was 12 during the open beta. The game came out after I turned 13 and I have memories of MS warrior dpsing BWL,  AQ20&amp;40, and getting my Naxx attunement. I was 16 for the beginning of BC and by then had logged 400 DAYS /played. Slept through most of my middle school and Highschool experiences. My memory of teens was pretty much just WoW memories.
---
No, but I remember this one:D 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sug4QLrwk-Y
---
oi m8at
---
Most likely the 1.12 version, the change you are talking about was 1.11.
---
Umm, look at all the vanilla private servers. These people have deliberately chosen to go for the vanilla experience over TBC and Wrath. I don't think there is any reason to believe that demand for classic will dry up once TBC is released.
---
Almost everyone will tell you that dungeon xp is bad but 99% of these people are just repeating what they’ve heard from youtubers or private server giga nerds. 
---
Sure if you are doing dungeons with random people or random classes without a strategy it will be very slow, but if you pick classes and talents specifically for the dungeon strategy you’re going for it can seriously be one of the fastest ways to level. 
---
On my practice runs I’ve seriously been able to get through levels 30-34 faster than Joanas world record just by grinding through Sm graveyard over and over, and that’s while I was multiboxing all 5 group members.
---
It also has that distinct piss stained coloring.
---
On classic you'll find yourself surrounded by people declining group invites because they don't understand fighting for loot is faster than fighting for spawns.
---
I still have and use that Saitek Eclipse keyboard
---
Well thats the game they're trying to replicate as authentically as possible isn't it? 
---
I thought it was a laptop at first, too. Zoom in bruh!

---
Me and my gf back then played wow in same IKEA chairs. 
---
Shawshank Redemption.
---
The Shawshank Redemption.  Really amazing film.
---
Keep in mind you also wont have downtime.
---
Was it a requirement that everyone playing vanilla WoW needed to play on a tiny cramped computer desk?
---
This is solved by just killing extra mobs all the time. With reduced downtime and increased killspeed its really not that big of a problem.
---
Hi, it’s me, your best pally. Guild invite pls. 
---
Is she still your gf?
---
My pserver dungeon experience is as follows
---
Pros:
---
Dungeons are social/fun, which is part of the core vanilla experience.
---
They teach/refresh you on mechanics important for raiding
---
You get to see some of the best thought out dungeon content in wow ever( looking at you ZF)
---
Cons:
---
Putting together a group + getting to the instance takes FOREVER. For things like VC and stocks where people are concentrated in these areas anyway, this isn't as big of a deal, but for something like a Mara full run be prepared to block out an hour or so
---
The gear isn't \*that\* good. Most gear in vanilla has terrible itemization anyway, so where a green "of the X" piece might have +7/+7 to your desired stats, a dungeon piece might have +11/+11, assuming you get it to drop(lol). From a gearing standpoint, you're better off farming gold and hitting the AH
---
Very weak xp/hr compared to questing.
---
My $.02 is as follows. Do the dungeons you **know** you like. I will never level skipping VC, SFK, Stocks, ZF, Strat, BRD because I enjoy them. I will however skip most of the others that I don't enjoy. My enjoyment of the game comes from **meaningful end game character progression** so for me, the leveling experience isn't really a big part of that. YMMV
---
I've never, ever, ever been surprised and said the N word. If it's something you say in surprise, then it's probably something that's in your vocab normally. And as a white guy, why is it in your vocabulary?
---
Not sure what you mean but in general, Vanilla had shared exp gains when killing mobs in a group. It also had turn-loot, meaning if you kill 2 mobs, the first mob's loot is yours, but the next mob's loot is only for the next guy in the group, etc.
---
So, in general, leveling in a group in Vanilla was more time consuming unless you're doing specific group quests.
---
Haha! I tried getting my boyfriend at the time in to WoW. It worked for a while, but *both* people being addicted to a game is a recipe for disaster LOL
---
I remember going to the midnight release of BC, good times.
---
This almost looks like a stock photo and it's really funny.
---
We have high speed internet quite early on here in Sweden so a webcam was useful sometimes...
---
He said 1.12 
---
Short answer: Yes it is worth it if you have several quest for the dungeon. You are able to get like 3-6 quest for most dungeons while leveling. So doing these dungeons one time to complete the quest is very efficient for leveling. Also sometimes these quest reward give good gear, which will make your leveling go much faster. 
---
If I remember correctly my friend made her way to Elwynn Forest. I rolled a human rogue to level with her, but I don't think either character made it past 15. I mained spriest and she mained hunter.
---
The concentration! The focus! I love it.
---
If you use the trinket from the summoned boss in ZG you can guarantee taunts since taunts are spells and the trinket boosts spell hit. So technically you can pull it off that way but it isn't perfect. Warriors will have the benefit of their 4 set bonus from t3 which will allow actual defensive/threat trinkets but in early progression you'd probably have a few with the zg trinket instead anyway(assuming you reach 4h before getting 8 4 set bonuses). You can get away with a druid here technically but due to the trinket issue your threat would lag behind and hold back the group to an extent. I would say that it would work fairly well before 8 4 set bonuses are achieved.

I would have LOVED the pvp Corp battles/system ownership politics when I was younger and had the time. Sadly, with a regular 9-5, I could not spend the late and long hours that required. Great game though. I still log in every few months and do a few missions with a buddy of mine who moved overseas.
---
Nice battlestation. Drinks on the desk and everything!! 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OXRi28W-ENY
---
Uh-huh
---
My main was an orc enh shaman...yes I healed during raids, but 2H PvP was my favourite. This was before people put all their self-worth into PvP games though, so being 'randomly' powerful wasn't a huge deal.   
---
My favourite weapon was the Draconic Avenger. Again, not the best weapon, but it looked amazing on an orc....it's a core reason why I think transmog was awesome at first, but eventually kinda ruined what was special about gearing up.  
---
I'm not going enh shaman (at least right away,) and while I was kinda bad and only raided in a proper guild up to Nef, I don't feel an urge to hardcore progress. Hardcore raided in TBC and that was amazing for the time, but ultimately I'll need to wait and see how I feel at level cap.  
---
Oh also, remember to Grounding Totem that HoJ. ;D
---
You do not need multiple tanks for magmadar ever. Even without a dwarf priest. 
---
Properly timing your berserker rage will prevent being feared for the duration of the fight. I have tanked mag without fearward and have seen others tank it without fearward many times.
---
+33dps to a single spell. Add in seal swings and procs and you're looking at at least an extra 75dps from each paladin, and that's before judgements and sanctity aura.
---
In a world where 300 dps is decent for someone starting to raid, an extra 75 is huge.
---
The good old [bbb.se](https://bbb.se) days :)

The 5 min blessings at launch you spammed over and over ... Oh man :(
---
It's funny how sitting at a computer used to be a thing worth taking a photo of. 
---
And yet I read this... Wondering if you too got fooled by "females" playing the game... Wouldn't that be kind of funny.
---
Yes, the eyes died pretty soon tho.
---
Thank you
---
I don't remember, but the big drawer had all the game boxes that i had. I still have all of them and original install discs somewhere.
---
Won't break, that's for sure. I hope you're ready to use up your whole budget if you want a laptop capable of that output as well as the monitor!
---
There’d be at least a dozen “I can’t believe they’ve done this” posts in here about booking vacation tune they can’t get back.
---
And in America, if we had the webcam running, a browser open, we prayed WoW would run and/or the PC wouldn't crash.  :)
---
ahh good ol shattered hand
---
In my opinion people underestimate the general appeal WoW used to have in those days. It wasn't just nerdy dudes playing. Numerous girls in my class played. Even the cheerleaders. My servers scarab lord was a semi known tv actress. I think the Fantasy genre was just a big deal back then with Lord of the Rings in the cinemas and World of Warcraft was the ideal game to satisfy the demand. 
---
Lmao, back in my wow days the battlestation was amassed with empty beer cans that I stacked. When it finally collapsed I'd recycle them. Thankfully I don't drink anymore. It was a weird synergy because the more I drank the more cans I had to work with, but the drunker I was, the less likely i could stack the cans. Then we moved on to a kegerator in the living room with our 3 PC's, and that was a game changer. 
---
This idea is terrible and you should feel bad.
---
That would be!
---
you will be able to pick whatever you want. 
---
My favorite was getting carried through SM on an alt by a friend's lvl 60 gnome warrior engineer.  For some reason, he attempted mind control on the high inquisitor.  It backfired of course and he murdered the shit out of all four of us.
---
That's impressive! Finally replaced mine with a mechanical a few years ago
---
Thats called TBC
---
I am in awe of people that can play this far away from the monitor. I would be on my stomach straining my neck with this set up. It's like monitors have a gravitational pull that only works on my face. 
---
You were probably older then than I am today, and I started playing during vanilla.
---
Having leveled a warrior to 60 on  pserver, I completely agree with this post. I got my warrior to 40, then had to take a long ass break from the game. Once I got my riding I was so burnt out I didn't play for almost a year. The great thing about a static classic server is you can take a break and just come back to the same game. Got my warrior to 60, got some prebis, did lots of mc, ZG,  aq 20, and quit the moment classic wow was announced. I knew burnout was real, and wanted to be as fresh as possible for the official release.
---
They've said it's only for launch and only for the starter zones.
---
It's a completely reasonable solution to both make launch more bearable and also account for many players leaving and still having a healthy population.
---
It will allow them to overpopulate the server at launch, and this is the best solution vs having a scattershot of dying servers soon after launch and offering free transfers.
---
In r/outside
---
Shaman is such a popular raiding class that is always needed. If you pick a shaman and have a brain your odds of seeing most PvE content goes through the roof compared to other classes. 
---
Undead? But of course
---
Unlikely. Double Dal Rend's are very serviceable well into BWL if you're unlucky enough not to get Deathbringer by then. 
---
There are some spreadsheets floating around that let you sim your character with a specific gear set. I'd try those with pre-raid BiS gear and either set to get a more accurate answer.
---
[TFW you will never be 12 again](https://i.imgur.com/CmNYIYa.jpg)

"Authentic" doesn't equal good. 20 seconds long WotF is "authentic" does that mean it's a good or necessary thing? The only reason why servers were capped at around ~3000 was because of hardware limitations, not due to "design philosophy" as some nimrods claim.
---
Actually humans arnt that much better for threat. You will be mostly converting all you autos into heroic strikes because of all the excesses rage, and yellow hits can be glancing 
---
Everything generates threat. Buffing has a set amount of threat, and rebuffs depend on spell level (that’s why Bloodrage generates threat). Threat, from a mathematical perspective is by and large .8xdamage done for attacks, with defensive stance and bear form being 1.3x damage done. Defiance talent is 1.15x that so it’s multiplicative. Spells that say “cause a high amount of threat” or “very high amount of threat” have multipliers, but I forgot what they are at the moment. 
---
I think I was 19 in this picture, but I started MMOing when I was around 9 (Ultima Online). Still, I'm over 30 now I was a youngin' in this picture, comparatively! 
---
Absolutely not.
---
As a left handed person it always bothered me that your character was forced to have "main hand" be your right hand. Would have preferred to have it in my left hand. For example, be able to toggle shield in right hand, sword in the left.
---
I've never seen a downside to dungeons in general.  You might get a gear upgrade or two and there are usually a handful of quests in each one.  The exception would be something like maraudon for alliance players because it is so far out of the way and often hard to find people for.  If you're at the right level for a dungeon, might as well give it a run once or twice.
---
Oh, I am only 21 now and started playing WoW when I was around 7. Still close though
---
Sick. Never thought of that before.. 
---
No it doesnt

I wish i had a girlfriend who plays CLASSIC wow :(...feelsbadman
---
I don't agree with him, Stormx's videos made me decide that I am absolutely going druid for classic. It just looks so damn fun. :) Give them a watch!
---
That's untrue. The alternatives to Edgemasters are:
---
1. Gauntlets of Annihilation from C'Thun
---
2. Aged Core Leather Gloves if you're running a dagger build with good daggers (Perdition's/Pugio/Death's Sting/Harbinger of Doom)
---
Edgemasters provide the highest DPS increase for any race due to how they impact Glancing Blow damage. The only time you would not use them would be if you're a human with Maladath (+9 weapon skill), in which case Edgemasters would put you over the Weapon Skill cap and not be worth it as much due to diminishing returns.
---
Amen bro, keep fighting the good fight
---
Did you have a fishbowl with a fake leak? That’s pretty damn funny. Got me for a second too.
---
Stealin' another mans bit is a good way to get shanked.
---
Yep. I remember the first time I saw someone wearing a Horde hoodie IRL and I couldn't believe it. Before WoW, playing MMOs had always fealt like such an... uncommom hobby, I guess. It definitely changed the genre.
---
I'm sure it's possible, but unless you're doing something super mindless (like plain grinding as a hunter) the experience is going to be far better if you simple use m/kb.

Though that wouldn't do anything for you. 315 weapon skill is the max and results in glancing blows dealing the same damage as regular white hits. Even 310 weapon skill means your glancing blows deal 90% damage.
---
&gt; The only reason why servers were capped at around ~3000 was because of hardware limitations, not due to "design philosophy" as some nimrods claim.
---
Nimrods like [this guy](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2368) Mark Kern who developed the game?

Now imagining some sweaty neckbeard trying to talk about girl stuff with the OP lol.

I was literally just listening to you explain that on the podcast. Super cool man!!!

Lol. Believe me, it's more flattering than the other 99.9% of the time I spent playing... in PJs, surrpounded by hot-pocket wrappers, and hunched over the like a gargoyle 🙂

Moonwalking is client side, you should be wondering about stuff like jumping in water instead

Eh, most of us talked through vent, so I don't think that was the case

Chiming in here, does anyone have any videos that are... well, helpful?  I watched Stormx and yeah, it's a bunch of montages to rock but I'm wanting to learn HOW to do well, not just watch someone else do it.

---
Thats a healer item?
---
Like I said, just because they were capped at 3000 due to hardware limitations (I was referencing Kern) doesn't mean they should be today. I didn't call Mark Kern a nimrod and he didn't claim the servers - should - be capped at 3000, he just said they were because of hardware.

You all the same posture. You just dont see it lol

I remember Bellular Gaming dojng this a couple years back. I'd be curious if it would work for classic as well?

Have you testet this? Says it's just for xp/vista
---
I going to be playing horde even tho I played alliance in classic. 
---
Personally I'd love the option of switching between classic and modern graphics, similar to how a lot of HD remasters function.
---
It's got edge snapping in firmware. Really good, but not the best.

In England we just prayed the internet worked at all. Cameras and video calling wasnt for another few years xD

And I believe you, it's just you were probably(guaranteed but I'll doubt there) on the other end of the spectrum of when someone finds out that there is a female in your guild and boom chat explodes and the boys, and men, instantly change their tune and want to run dungeons with that girl/woman.

Sadly.. I can't say I wasn't one of those, but a much different time haha

this was my fav pvp spec at 60 https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/Axw8QAPDkcADPzQ0
---
medium damage, decent heals, lots of ktie potential - added up to amazing results
---
my guild let me raid heal with this spec and it would still get the job done in pvp https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AhwMAsORBD80Nyg if you want to tank heal / dungeon id recommend swiftmend tho
---
49 twink i would do: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/Axw8QAPDkcACMxQ or if u hate insect swarm put it in feline swiftness. my usual strat was to keep hots on myself and dots (moonfire insect swarm) on them, lots of bear form.

This was the RS vs wow video I watched from so long ago 
---
What you're describing would not be classic WoW, would it?
---
Or instead they could keep server caps the same since the game was designed around it. No need for hacky solutions.
---
ya in a battleground i could outduel someone at a flag or heal a battle and never get caught. was so fun
---
Interesting. There were only 5-6 in my guild that I remember, but we were a raiding guild in Vanilla so maybe an older collection of people? I loved the women in my guild! The main raid healer mentored me when I started raiding so I wouldn't make a damn fool of myself in MC
---
Although this is clearly satire, it is eerily similar to many posts I've seen. +1
---
I still do unless I’m talking to people on discord. I don’t care how comfy you try to make headphones, they’ll never feel better than just not wearing them at all. 
---
Idk MC was always my favorite dungeon in the game. Many hated the trash mobs and the length of the dungeon but I loved every aspect of it in Vanilla. That being said some dungeons are great and some are just terrible, looking at you Gnomeragan. 
---
My advice is find what you like and don’t rely on the opinions of others. To some the early end game raiding is amazingly fun, to others it’s not. Determine what you like and you’ll be fine. If you are questing and doing dungeons and you love it, don’t rush through. If you don’t, then feel free to rush. 
---
Play your game, not someone else’s. 
---
\^\^ thanks for answering, this one can be bought at a vendor?
---
No exclamation mark after Warcraft? You're a cop. 
---
Doubling the server size is not at all in line with design philosophy. The game was designed around 2500 concurrent online players, there is no reason to mess with that so it can feel more like some pirate server you spent time on. We should be playing vanilla, not official nost.
---
I bought a pre built cyberpowerpc from Walmart online for around $1000 and it’s done me just fine since I’ve had it. 
---
Shaman is kind of a meh class with a lot of issues. Pal is boring as hell to play especially because ret is garbage and blessings suck to rebuff but are overpowered, but it is arguably one of the strongest classes in the game when they spec holy (but the only people who could tolerate leveling one are ret thus refused to play holy.)
---
That's a proper nest

Nooooo, many of those were people from different servers logging in on fresh level 1's, some of them racing to level 10 to gain chat privileges so they could ask us questions.

making gold can be dificult, not the best grinders. But as for open world content, i cant think of a better class? So much versatility and self reliability. it's not for everyone, no hard feelings whatever you decide. all the best

Back in the day, they offered free server transfers to people on high pop servers to go somewhere else for balance.  They may do the same or merge low pop servers as people are suggesting.

Nice pic. But man, all these nostalgia pics show people with CRT monitors, small desks and speakers.

I'd definitely age that group down to 25-35 as the average.
---
What do you think, how much is the extra heal of the passive in '' % increase'' of heal. I dont know anything about classic numbers.
---
its very complicated, managing hots, dots, kiting, mana. id suggest classic pvp videos
---
Is that a napkin for a mousemat I see?
---
Not really unless you're running wsg as a druid or paladin. There aren't really many overpowered healing items in classic. 
---
Pre-nerf [Spirit of Aquementas](https://web.archive.org/web/20041105020259/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=11904) was pretty overpowered.
---
Pre-nerf [Crown of the Penitent](https://web.archive.org/web/20041105030232/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=13216) also was a fairly overpowered starter item.
---
People overestimate quest experience. When speed leveling it's basically just a bonus added to grinding. Many time savings come from efficient routing to reduce travel times, knowing how to get the most out of your class to kill mobs (melee weaving hunters for example) and skipping bad quests.
---
With reduced quest experience it will only slightly increase the amount of grinding or doing some of the bad quests on the way that were considered not worthwhile before. The travel time, which makes up a big portion of the leveling process will remain the same. 
---
Yeah, that table was way too low for your height.  :)
---
I wonder if the removed jokes will be back
---
There will be model edits for sure but officially I doubt it
---
The steam controller is actually really fun and easy to set up to use with classic. It has the ability for 16 simple keybinds using the D-Pad and the “Letters” button pad. You can also program the left &amp; right bumpers, triggers, as well as an additional grip trigger on the lower backsides of the controller. The analog stick is also easily programmed for movement with the mouse track pad for mouse movement. 
---
I typically have around 22-24 keybinds for endgame so while playing with a controller isn’t perfect for that type of gameplay it IS perfect for relaxing leveling that you’ll do in the first couple of months. Towards the end you’d probably figure out ways to keybind more actions as well if you would need them.
---
My understanding is that he first 5 points are the most impactful, reducing damage lost from glancing blows by 1/2. But, from what people have said, the gloves that “increase DPs more” drop in BWL, they just require weapon skill from another source. 
---
Here’s a great video of what not to do

---
I am confused what you mean? The rare pvp set is from rank 7-10 and the epic set rank 12-13?
---
I doubt it. They removed them for a reason, and presumably it wasn't a technical reason. 
---
I remember the tip that was like "If you enjoyed playing with somebody, add them to your friends list!" and thinking it was the dumbest thing ever, I would burst out laughing every time I saw it. 
---
Pretty funny that the weed joke will stay removed after it's become so much more acceptable now
---
Unlikely. Social justice has sunk its claws too deep into society. An old joke may offend someone. 
---
Yeah, nothing big though. More like starring in local daytime program. Similar to UKs EastEnders, you know. 
---
Thanks for the answer first of all :)
---
I wonder if those items will be in the nerf or pre nerf version in classic?
---
Nononono, its the opposite - if you take your time, your sub lasts longer and you're actually playing it longer. OP has the 1,000 IQ plays. 
---
i think you might of missed the part in stormx's videos where he kills other players
---
There are plenty of OW players who insist that it's dying because so many people have quit.  You can still find a match quickly, often in 1-2 minutes.  Not to mention OWL recently broadcast matches live on national TV, so they're doing just fine.  80% of the people making those claims are idiots basing it on little to no evidence.
---
the good ol days
---
Candy Crush doesnt count 
---
The only advice I can give you on this is to remember that:
---
1) Dungeon quests generally aren’t in the dungeon. You usually have to clear a quest chain or 2 in the zone the dungeon is in before you’ll get a quest to go to a dungeon. 
---
2) You don’t get a bonus for killing the main bosses. There is not structure to the dungeons so you’ll need to experiment to see what can be killed the most efficiently and stick to that. 
---
If you put away 5$ a day until the launch of classic WoW you will have enough. If you're looking for an easy way to make far more then 5$ extra a day look into driving for your local restaurant delivery service like Ubereats or just driving passengers for them. 
---
Depends on the spell coefficient. Shorter casting spells get less of the bonus and longer casting spells gain more. Here are some coefficients someone posted here a bit ago for reference. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)
---
Depends on the class. Easy as a paladin (leveling at least)
---
Something like "JoyToKey" 
---
- L3 nub for WASD (and directionals for WA / WD etc)
---
- L1 / R1 for strafe
---
- L2 to tab
---
- X jump
---
- Square for seal
---
- Triangle to judge
---
- Circle for exorcism, consecrate, etc.
---
And you still have R2, R3 nub for 4/8, dpad for 4 (eat/drink macro, self blessings, so the possibility is there.
---
Keyboard / Mouse is 5,000% better... but if you're doing a long grind session, gamepads can technically do the job.
---
What North said. Also keep in mind that itemization wasn’t the best back then so look at the actual stats instead of the rarity of the item. Sometimes you’ll find the better stats on a Blue. 
---
Swapping weapons WHILE casting is very strong in Vanilla.
---
A hybrid class could be in a full melee damage set and still get off a powerful heal in a timely manner thanks to this mechanic.   
---
&gt; But should it continue to be the same after all the content of Classic has been fulfilled?
---
Yes, since that's literally what's going to happen.
---
The first 5 points increase glancing blow damage from .7 to .85, which is correct.  What I have a problem with is the second part of your statement: besides T2 gloves (which are not even DPS gloves), there are no other options for warriors. 
---
There are no gloves that replace Edgemaster's besides Gauntlets of Annihilation from C'thun and ACLG in specific contexts.
---
Most people that use larger screens like that do it because they have a hard time seeing smaller screens. Other than that, the quality won't be great unless you're doing 4k

its so funny how miserable our PC and desk setups used to be hahaha
---
If it's about comfort, I'd recommend getting some sort of lap tray for your mouse/keyboard and some usb extenders. The game will be very cumbersome with a controller because there are so many different spells and abilities to cast.
---
Do what you want to do, but those are my 2 cents.
---
Don't tell me how to play the game, you're not my real dad!

Arh cool, thanks for the information. Will either roll a priest or pala. I think priests are more fun in pve, but paladins seems better pvp-wise. The struggle..

Did you listen? He said that it was a design decision first, later they found out that they actually had a hardware limitation. 
---
There's also [this](https://i.imgur.com/Tfo1QTo.png) little nugget from him (Grummz) where he confirms that it was more or less around 3k and the hardware could handle 3500-4000.
---
So they chose a cap based on design that was lower than what the servers could handle.
---
This has also been confirmed by Kevin Jordan on his stream, he's also one of the original developers.
---
progressing all the way 100 times through BRD, was definitely less boring than Cataclysm daily heroic farm, anyway.

And, waiting 23 hours for new world quests certainly is more boring and time-consuming, than grind.

It's kind of different when it comes to healing gear though, it's just the pre-raid BiS items that is "op" I guess and you have a list of all those items.
---
If they modify the mods to work with whatever api Classic is on it’ll work. 
---
please give us moonwalking! I know i saw some clip from some guy playing bm hunter in bfa where you could moonwalk and ive read that in the patch before bfa you could moonwalk too because of some glitch so just add the same glitch to classic. It's something i do all the time in pvp and it just wont be the same without it :(
---
Nice shadow priests were bomb in BC especially at the beginning. 
---
 You clearly have no idea what you're talking about lol it's spell damage that only applies to holy. You are also forgetting debuff slots. Unless they are purposely stacking paladins, you're not getting 5 slots even if you can stack in classic. 5 slots/paladins to equal pure dps using their debuffs (some aren't even allowed ie mortal strike, serpent sting, etc) at the very beginning of raiding is hardly broken. You've clearly not been seeing warriors and rogues doing 1k+ dps on private servers. If you're not going to even look at things objectively and with facts, I'm just gonna call you a moron. Learn how coefficients work, then try to debate. 
---
Also just to add to this. In Vanillia your weapon wasn't proportional to your size. So you nearly all the 2 handers where twice or more the size of the gnome. Its pretty hilarious seeing a gnome run around with a big-ass sword and swing it around.
---
If you want to play from couch I suggest a lapdog or whatever it’s called. Big cushion thing with a keyboard tray and mouse pad.
---
Yes, let them release a game that likely hasn't have had enough time to be fully rolled back, still have one or two later released things in it, have other things that may still be in discussion stages not make it, and may have some bad bugs that are caused by rolling it back that they would otherwise have time to squash. I'm sure that'll go over well.
---
Ah good to know! I will have a Look

Let's be real though spongebob was probably the best children's cartoon to ever have existed

Raiding in classic WoW is child's play compared to later expansions or FFXIV. Mechanics are minimal and as long as your build, gear, and rotation are semi optimal, it's going to be ok.

They said they want people to notice a difference between the 2006 and 2019 client.
---
The best moment is when you've searched for a group for 2 hours, standing in Ogrimmar, getting frustated, almost giving up. Then suddenly find a healer and get going.
---
The best parts are just being able to play the game after all the shit you've been trough. That is also what being lvl 60 means, that is what your gear represents. The shitness that you've overcome. The farming you had to do for those consumables to get into that raid, etc.
---
Thanks my dude.
---
there are no list, cos pvp gearing was much more creative and flexiable. as it was to accompony your talents, playstyle and the enviroment (for instance group or duel, or wpvp and so on. also against different classes whats optimal is different, and you were swaping some gear around aswell). 
---
so in general you could do a lot of things and be succesful with it. Also getting gear in vanilla is hard and its a continious process, from all the sources, and it depends on what you get. its more of tha tyou guided by the satst you want to hit, certained amount of hp, certain amount of crit , certained amount of mana and so on. and you adjust your gear based on that, managing whatever you got. 
---
overall, as you can see there is al ot of parameters to it, so its just isnt linear, so there are no lists.
---
You won't be generating much threat I think in battle stance. 
---
Main remain rouge.But wanna twink with tankdruid
---
no, I need somebody to heal me in dungeons. If we all played warlock that would be a nightmare to organize. 
---
Lol.  You have no clue what you're talking about.  It's funny, though!  Thanks for the laugh.
---
I know, I was pointing out how much redundancy daggers have.
---
I will get my nostalgia from playing my original faction; the novelty from playing a new class.
---
For your first question: yes, battle shout is generally better and generates more threat. Demo shout has a set amount that gets split up and spread evenly between all mobs, but battle shout has a set amount based on how many people you bugged that multiplies to each mob.
---
I don’t know the actual values but example
---
Party of 5 Vs 4 mobs.
---
Let’s say Demo Shout does 100 threat. 25 split between all mobs.
---
Battle shout does 25 threat per person buffed. 5 people = 125 threat to each of the 4 mobs. 
---
4 mobs = 500 total threat vs 100
---
Again, not the real values, the disparity isn’t this big, and someone can correct me if I’m wrong on the concept, but I believe that’s basically it.
---
Use demo shout once early on to apply it, then only spam battle shout for aoe threat. 
---
Note that demo shout is better against small groups and battle shout is better against large.
---
For a long time you couldnt eat and drink at the same time. They added it in later and made that loading screen tip. I remember when they added it thinking it was a hug QoL change. Seems minor now.
---
Yeah they should have gone under the bed's cross bar instead of over.
---
I’ll be maining a class I never played back then (warlock) and will def be leveling an alt of my former main(priest)
---
Getting 8/8 T2 will not be a casually feasible for a few years. I didn't get it in a guild that pushed 4 horsemen/Cthun and farmed BWL for over a year, got 7/8 and the shoulders just wouldn't drop. Got outbid the one time they did.
---
If you're horde, even though totems are annoying buffs to manage, you still need them because they are good.
---
For sure! Dagger Furies are highly underrated.

Lol I had this exact keyboard for a long time, it was a real cool one, I don't remember what it was called though

Yes it's worth it (and the point of the game IMO).  
---
You get great gear for your level, there's quests in them that give good XP and guaranteed gear, good way to get gold and mats, and I think most importantly it teaches you how to properly use your class and cooperate with others.  
---
To answer your question point blank: there is no reason to not do dungeons while leveling, it will not set you back.

I'm pretty sure when someone says "Yes, absolutely" to an absurd idea about eradicating people as if they were a plague, it's clearly not meant to be taken seriously.  Notice how the context of what I'm saying is the key thing here, not the words themselves?  Like I suggested three posts ago?  Whereas the context of your original post calling me elitist trash did not suggest you were being sarcastic.  Can you tell the difference?
---
I don't really know what's left to argue about man.  My response to you was that you weren't able to tell I was being sarcastic/silly, and I felt it was clear that I was.  You don't think it was implied strongly enough.    We can agree to disagree, but if you find yourself getting in these kinds of conflicts often maybe you should re-evaluate your approach.
---
Rest in peace TotalHalibut. 
---
Interesting. Pretty sure we started leveling a few months after BC's release, so it was probably always an option for us! 
---
I’m 23 and started playing in TBC when I was 12, so definitely one of the youngins. That said, I honestly do get the sense that there’s a tonne of older Gen X players returning, I just think they’re more active on the Bliz forums than Reddit.

*Female NE Hunters
---
I remember that. Struggling to stance dance ony to Main-tanking in aq and clearing the place I inside two years. 
---
Thanks alot!
---
Except people seriously believe that and say that. People also say that and don't mean it literally. Again you showed no signs of sarcasm.
---
&gt; My response to you was that you weren't able to tell I was being sarcastic/silly, and I felt it was clear that I was.
---
And I am telling you IT ISN'T. To the point i'm calling bullshit. Your posts show you hating on Retail, so if anything you were serious till someone took a problem with it.
---
&gt;We can agree to disagree, but if you find yourself getting in these kinds of conflicts often maybe you should re-evaluate your approach.
---
Or maybe use any of the things I listed to show sarcasm. Or you know, don't make a bunch of posts shitting on retail and then claim your not shitting on its players.
---
Bow pull if there's any chance of you using intimidating shout, if there are runners and DPS are not focusing the targets you want, if there's a pat you want to avoid, if there's spellcasters you want to LoS closer for AoE... usually you want to bow pull. 
---
Bow pull &gt; LoS &gt; bloodrage &gt; battle shout &gt; demo shout as enemies come around the corner &gt; taunt skull &gt; revenge or sunder spam

I want someone to make an addon that have joke tips on the loading screen. Like some moders do for fallout 4 and skyrim. There is so much room for some seriously funny "tips."
---
Fuck you and fuck elves 
---
yeah dude i was already 24 back in 05. I got into the game through co workers and nobody I knew that played WoW was a kid lol.
---
If you can't accept the simple fact that people without hunches aren't real people, then I can't help you.
---
I agree... Misses on a 3.6 speed weapon are agonizing. In PvP though, 2h should be more fun as you see chunks of your opponent's health go down (and it's even more effective)
---
PvP = Gnome(Escape Artist is the best PvP racial BY FAR)/Dwarf/Orc  
---
PvE DPS = Human/Orc  
---
Tank = Human/Orc/Tauren  
---
Night Elf/Troll/Undead are useless races for Warrior.
---
Oh man, hearing "StanceSets" brought me through the nostalgia wormhole.
---
Suddenly it's 2007 again and I have my addon set up to where I have my Lobotomizer equipped in my MH when I'm in stealth and my Grand Marshal's Longsword equipped after I ambush and pop out of stealth.
---
Man I was the bomb in Hellfire Peninsula.  Those boars didn't stand a chance.
---
you havent lived if you didnt look like a ghoul raiding til 2AM on a sunday cuz the raid went like shit and the gm wanted to push another hour of effort so we dont all have to come back another day to finish it
---
&gt; Unless they are purposely stacking paladins
---
go back and read the post. im explicitly talking about stacking paladins.
---
2-6 is all mentioned. Any source for what you said about phase 1?
---
That is why they have made improvements to the system over time. However they want as close to vanilla experience as possible, including wonky mechanics (just not outright bugs).
---
It's one of those things where if they never mentioned I never would've realized but now that they have i want it more than anything.
---
Nothing was funnier than two mages sheeping each other or two warriors charging each and you both just sitting there.
---
Where were you in 2006?
---
Illidan. Where the real PvP is at
---
Considering the game is pegi 12 I understand their decision. Many kids that age don't understand the bigger picture of jokes like this, and rationalize them in a way which normalizes drugs etc.
---
Virtually any PC / Laptop will run the game maxed out well within your budget. IMO the sweet spot for price to performance ratio is around $1500 for PCs, and a sub $2k for a Laptop - but again you could get away with much less if all you want to do it play Classic.
---
I'm getting a new laptop at a similar price point for Classic myself, but waiting until the last possible moment to get the most value out of newer tech (hopefully mobile RTX getting cheaper)- in all my researching (been at this for about a year) ASUS's "ROG" line almost always ends up on top for my needs, and I've seen lots excellent 17" laptops that could run modern games for ~$1700.
---
Ok so he is a vanilla veteran. Isuldur would be Blizzard, the ring Activision. Frodo and the fellowship Nostalrius, Aragon the guys who are makimg vanilla now.
---
Esfand is Gimli, Asmongold is Legolas, and we are the army of Gondor.
---
Ah, Hot Pockets, the perfect meal for the 5 minute break the raid leaders give you in a 4-5 hour raid night
---
Just thankin ya for reviving the term “WoWing” from my memory- I had completely forgotten it and used to use it so much.
---
In true diplomacy everyone will be equally disappointed ;)

Highlight to the weirdest shit is:

Medium

And you don't know if that next hour is gonna be one of those where you keep wiping and everyone is gonna start cussing at each other and get their spirits broken, or where you actually down the boss and everyone screams into their mic in celebration.

From the FAQ
---
**How will World of Warcraft differ from other MMORPGs?**
---
World of Warcraft will differ from other MMORPGs in many ways. One of our main goals is to ensure that players can enjoy World of Warcraft without having to invest huge amounts of playtime. 
---
No it will not. 
---
No.
---
Do it. Good luck.
---
&gt; kegerator 
---
had to google this
---
I had no idea how much I wanted this thing
---
Yeah my mom certainly was not interested in taking a picture of me at the computer when she walked into my room at 3am on a school night and I'm hunched over the computer grinding Timbermaw rep.
---
&gt; As part of the Horde, the Trolls have extended their loyalty to the mighty Tauren, but they have little trust for the manipulative Forsaken, whom they believe will visit only misery and strife upon their allies. 
---
The trolls had it right all along!!
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;do you think after Naxxaramas releases they should develop further gameplay changes to make each class spec a viable option?
---
In my opinion this leads to class homogenization and bad forms of class stacking.
---
See TBC: Maybe it would be different with 40 men, but several pure damage classes (mage and rogue mainly) get shafted because they don't bring buffs while ever other spec is viable.
---
This is also less of an issue obviously when the content is as easy mechanically as it is in vanilla- but ask yourself, "Why do we need enchancement shamans or prot paladins to be good in raid environments?"
---
I think the answer is "Because raiding is almost the entirety of the game." Sure, Elemental Shamans and Balance Druids and Shadowpriests might not be hyper optimal, but they dick all over people in World PvP, an aspect of Vanilla that a lot of people would find more important than endgame raiding.
---
I think class identity in part relies on certain specs not being optimal everywhere. And I think that "non optimizied" gameplay leads to the culture that makes vanilla so great.
---
&gt;When playing with other players, a little kindness goes a long way!
---
Haven't seen that one for some time. Guess they removed it sue to sharding and CRZ?
---
This is the dumbest
---
You only get one toon and it's only Hardcore mode
---
How did you do that? Its hard to find someone who has the same hobbies as you and doesn´t live on other end of the world. Btw awesome pic. You look really happy.
---
Yeah man, they are the dream. If you drink a lot of beer it's so much cheaper. 
---
M'lady
---
its not the distance its the low height
---
I will be interested to see if battle shout spam is an actual thing on classic. Back in retail it wasn't a tanking strategy and I was under the impression that the threat only applied when the buff was freshly applied, but not when it was over-written. It's great that they have the 1.12 reference client for stuff like this.
---
I miss classic eng. It was so amazing with some truly fun stuff. It just felt that expansion after expansion eng got worse and worse. Not because the items got worse, but because the restrictions of where it could be used.
---
OOOOOOOOOH, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.  Level 18?
---
We "should" be able to solo farm Dire Maul East and do DMe jump runs with a warrior to kill some bosses and mine in tunnel.
---
If the Lashers have blizzlike drops and don't do bugged shadowdamage from the front you can farm them as resto in green gear and can probably be able to get 40g/h.
---
Until Dire Maul is out you can farm satyrs in Felwood for felcloth and demonic runes and elementals and stuff. You can get 20-30g/h from basically any mobs in the world if you farm them.
---
Fishing is also a ok way to farm gold.
---
Yea it's crazy but back then Vanilla was considered really "Casual" in comparison to how the MMO market was.
---
How times have changed.
---
Im leveling a new one first for a fresh nostalgic experience (probably lock) then I’ll level up a hunter afterwards which was my previous main! 
---
One thing is for sure though! FOR THE HORDE! 🤟🏼
---
If your guild is hardcore, they'll want the enchants. Which take quiet a few runs, and I definitely remember people getting substantial "upgrades" still when we were clearing BWL. 
---
The main draw to ZG was we rolled on gear and often took some friends/people not on th main raid team line. So people got to dip their feet into raiding with it and people who were saving DKP for certain items got to get gear without having to worry about not being on top when Crul'shorukh, Edge of Chaos dropped off Neff :P
---
Having never played a hunter, I recall the few we had in my guild on private server would respec from marks into survival when they hit a certain amount of agility, for it to be worthwhile. They was around AQ or early naxx level of gear, so I assume they were heavy marks before then. 
---
A quick google search will probably find you a few decent pve guides that covers specs 
---
Both Warlock and Hunter have good T1 and T2 sets that are easy to obtain due to raids taking fewer of them (compared to mages, rogues and warriors). Hunter is especially easy to gear as they're given priority on ranged weapons (a hunters biggest upgrade) and only have other hunters to roll against. 8/8 T1 + Rhok on a hunter is bananas. You can tear through most people with Aimed Shot --&gt; Auto Shot --&gt; Multi Shot --&gt; Auto Shot. As a side note, another thing that's nice about hunters is they don't require many consumables so they're cheaper to raid with.
---
no meaning if u use a backstab spec u gonna have to put a sword on to fight mobs
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b3c33i/tanking_school/) is some stuff:)
---
It’s for WoW. A laptop is fine. 
---
Like, if he wants to play PC games in general, sure, definitely spend the money on a desktop. But if you’re just gonna play WoW and intend to travel, a laptop is fine.
---
Pretty sure there was at least one guild who killed hakkar full buffs without killing any of the other bosses. I remember killing him with at least one still up cuz we felt like it, it's not impossible.
---
I wanna go with what I played the first time a nelf rogue
---
I havent played rogues much outside of tbc so I'd like that
---
priest or hunter or even mage also tempt me a lot
---
I'll prolly run them all if classic lives long enough
---
PvP implmentation, Crossrealm BGs, and Right Click Report are the only things on your list that haven't been specifically addressed already. AV will be 1.12, Sharding in Starting Zones for a few weeks, Loot trading only in ML raids (2 hour limit).
---
Shadow Priest from day 1 launch until the day I die. 
---
Just please play on the faction I get to kill. 
---
No, reliable frontstabbing is a private server bug, it was never a thing on retail.
---
Sorry, i'm not dumbing down my posts for the rest of time and putting /s on everything when I feel it's clear from context that I'm being sarcastic.  I've literally explained four times how the sarcasm was indicated.  It's not my job to educate you, you're free to be angry.  I am happy to continue my life upsetting you and communicating my sarcasm successfully to people with adequate levels of reading comprehension.
---
Yes, these have ALWAYS been around. I love OPs idea that this is somehow part of the problem with modern WoW. It doesn’t even matter!
---
Exactly this. I was hording DKP when we started killing Neff cuz I wanted a specific. ZG was a godsend of loot, that we rolled for!
---
Thunderclap is insignificant threat and mainly used for the damage mitigation. It isn’t something that should be used much in tanking 5/10mans. 
---
I see a lot of warriors taunt as soon as mobs get to them after bow pull, which is totally not needed, unless some lock/mage/hunter decides to unload on them as they run to you.  Save your taunt for when/if you lose threat on something. 
---
If the dungeon isn’t a huge risk of you dying and you can safely charge, charging in and popping sweeping strikes before moving to defensive stance helps a lot with threat generation 
---
Fuck you and fuck gnomes
---
Yeah no I still call bullshit on you being sarcastic. Every post has you being condescending and talking shit. Stop lying. Because the only options right now are:
---
1) Your a shit liar and an asshole.
---
or
---
2) Your so brain dead that you can't realize how you showed absolutely no sarcasm in your posts, and your still an asshole.
---
Because it was an obvious thing to do or the opposite?
---
Heroes 3.
---
What a fine lad
---
Are you going to win world firsts? No. But grinding dungeons for a bit to get ahead of flooded zones isn't bad. Plus, for example. If you do Deadmines like 5 or 6 times, you're group will hit the questing zones well ahead of the average gear curve. As you'll have all the loot. Lol and if one of you is a rogue, that's going to be a super happy dude.
---
Okay
---
Saitek Eclipse, it was the absolute best. My spacebar became transparent towards the end.
---
holy shit I want to die
---
Maybe you will die soon.
---
&gt; **Will there be player housing?**  
---
 Yes, we plan to include player housing as soon as possible after the game launches.     
---
 **Will there be monsters that randomly roam in packs from time to time?**  
---
 Yes, and we call this dynamic game play. The plan is to have numerous  dynamic encounters in the game that will be randomly timed and placed.   
---
Well, they certainly had a lot of plans that they never got to or it took 10 more years to implement them...
---
HaHahaha loled at the rat claw. Legit perfect description 
---
Yes but alcohol was legal when this game was released.
---
Has anyone noticed how many more comments this thread is getting compared to similar posts with a boy in the picture? Haha
---
Most people is around this age group i think..Im 31 this year (‘88 model) and wow was a pandemic at our school :) but atleast we are still the same group of friends since 04, most still playing wow every new expansion, and most of us Looking forward to classic
---
Fuck you, bigger 
---
-Gnome/Dwarf gang

what about:

&gt;Every post has you being condescending and talking shit.
---
Just keep proving my point.
---
&gt; dropping the N bomb in a serious manner, IS an act of aggression 
---
No it isn't, not even in law, and if it was in law that would be a bad law. No word ever scratched my skin. Same thing as me being racially profiled wasn't an act of aggression (violation of a law maybe, but not an act of direct violence or imminent threat which is really what I meant)
---
&gt; I've never, ever, ever been surprised and said the N word. If it's  something you say in surprise, then it's probably something that's in  your vocab normally.
---
You haven't, but maybe other people have and do. But I get it, this is the ol' "you're a homophobe, you must be secretly gay!" tactic used to try and push things more to the radical left, where if you say it you are it. I don't know how much we want this to devolve into double standards. This is you [https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/392/438/47f.jpg](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/392/438/47f.jpg) It's because having those rules makes you the "other" and guilty of something you had no part it, no white person alive today had a slave in the 1700's. Many were themselves slaves then or throughout history, and treated far worse. But I guess those kind of slaves don't count, or just aren't part of the status quo today?
---
&gt; And as a white guy, why is it in your vocabulary? 
---
Assuming you mean PDP here, I don't know but my guess is it's in his vocab because it's a highly stigmatized word that more or less means "bad guy" now. We are told all the time not to say it, people hate being told what they can and cannot do. Just think of a kid who loves pokemon, then his parents get involved and the game isn't cool anymore, let this word die like pokemon in south park. It has so much social enforcement that I knew a white person once who told me that they had so much anxiety about the word  that sometimes when they spoke to a black person it would just be in their mind (DON'T SAY THE WORD, DON'T SAY THE WORD, DON'T SAY THE WORD). Any relationship that walks on that much of a psychotic razor's edge is just unhealthy. If you are around people where you have these eggshells, find different people. 
---
The Irish "own" this word as much as black people(just google the posters) but for some reason are not able to say "sup my Irish N". Indians, Arabs, and some others I probably am forgetting have all been called this word in a historical way and the words exist today still. In the USA it is definitely easier for other minorities to talk to each other and say each other's nono-words than exists a bridge for whites.
---
One of my parents was an immigrant and I give anyone I talk to permission to use those words until the anxiety dies down and nobody gives a shit anymore, also the jokes are hilarious. People think trust comes from boundaries that are protected through hostility. Real trust and relationships are formed through openness and vulnerability, I have heard things from my friends that made me fume(bad jokes etc), but I use that constructively against myself because I believe offense can never be given, only taken. 
---
Bottom line is: vanilla servers with north of 5000 players are better than 3k capped servers from 2006, and if you haven't played both, your opinion isn't worth a lot.
---
I'm trying to picture retail models with classic armor sets....some would be...okay. but for the most part, I think it would just look strange.
---
Nobody yet? Alright let me give it a try. First of all till AQ40 you won't need consumables. Sure it's easier but not even close to necessary. You will do fine especially as a healer. Healer don't need as many consumables as other rolles in generall. 
---
When you really want to farm gold you can act as a pocket healer. Search for a good DD and share the loot with him. Another way is gathering in generall. Back then I mained heal druid and had a hunter twink for farming. Hope I could help you a little bit.
---
Always used speakers, always will. Unless when I raided, then I used 15 euro head set. 
---
Did yall know there was an amazing buff for the whole zone before you turned in the head or was it a suprise for everyone seeing that OP buff?
---
&gt;known servers
---
Yeah just check the server name list megathread
---
Black Dragons FTW
---
I took a week off work when wrath of the lich ming came out, and bought a collector's edition for myself and my friend. The day before release out internet shit the bed, so I packed up my PC and went to my friend's house to camp out until it was fixed 4 days later.
---
12 hours a week is enough at 60. Levelling might be slower than others but getting there a few weeks later doesn’t matter in the long run.
---
Once you’re in a guild, if you raid 1-2 nights per week, that should be in the region of 3-9 hours, and the rest can be spent making money, farming, repping, PvP, whatever. Most likely you’ll want to just farm though.
---
Does this also require talent points to deviate from the standard priest builds? Because if not, you could just keep a gear set with +Arcane bonuses and still play the game in a standard way in raids and dungeons.
---
Got it. I must have been confused. 
---
If you gave a fuck about your posture while playing vanilla, you were doing it wrong anyway you filthy casuals lol
---
I started playing midway through vanilla(AQ War effort had just started) and I remember being able to eat and drink on my mage. I assume this is going to be in the 1.12 official servers. 
---
So wait though... mind you I WANT BC and Wrath Classic to be released one day but it’s not a bad argument because if you keep dividing up the playerbase with each release you will undoubtedly see diminishing population across all the expansions. 
---
If they release TBC, and keep up a classic server, that’s three different divisions of World of Warcraft players (retail, classic, BC) and it keeps going until Wrath or Cata or MOP until you’ve divided the playerbase to be split into so many different versions of the game.
---
The last thing I want in ANY version of wow is a dead server or community. If you ask me, I think they should replace the previous game/expansion with the new expansion. 
---
Now yes with that you’ll have the hardcore “Vanilla-Only” characters leaving and going back to private servers, which may hurt the community even more than dividing it up, so what then?
---
So then maybe instead Blizz just needs to merge servers and adapt to population across each expansion. But they’ve never been very good at this. If blizz could merge and adapt servers for BC and WOTLK 6 years from now when they’re released to ensure every server for each expansion has a healthy population and community, I think that would be the best option. 
---
Nope. Your best bet is on launch day to reserve the names you want on as much realms as you can. After a day or so you will know the servers you'll have to avoid.
---
fake
---
Indeed we'll see down the road , I personally would enjoy classic+ or classic TBC but the fresh server thing is not my thing.
---
This is the face of that one hunter who kept camping your alt.
---
OMG right?!
---
1. Something doesn't have to be illegal to be an act of aggression. And no, what tactic are you on about? This is some serious Trump follower paranoia you're going with here. You don't get to tell people what hurts them and what doesn't. End of story.
---
2. It has NOT become a generic term for "bad guy". I have no idea where you pulled that out of.
---
3. You give people "permission" to use the N word? Anyone who says, "COOL! Gonna start dropping the N-bomb now!" is a fucking idiot. You and your friends sound like a bunch of socially maladjusted morons. Enjoy your block.
---
Not so much a bug as it was just taking advantage of bad pings. Even on pservers with 300+ ms ping, it was very wonky and worked maybe 10% of your tries.
---
Exploits will not be exploitable.
---

this is the best vanilla druid pvp video I've ever seem
---
I use a pair of Sennheiser RS-175's while in discord or people are sleeping. I use my Bose Companion 5 speakers for everything else. 
---
I feel that getting the bow will become so much more difficult this time around compared to original days... too many people playing in those areas.
---
Gnomes got kicked out of their capital city by kobolds so fuck them 
---
Says who? I've played on private servers and I played between 2004 and 2006, it's not even close to the same experience. It felt like playing with cross realm.
---
If you want changes to vanilla that's fine but I don't think we should start making changes just because we don't like parts of the game. It's vanilla, not vanilla with sprinkles. #nochanges
---
I mained paladin from vanilla through bfa. I have maybe 100 hours on all alts combined.
---
I see no reason to change. 
---
If you actually check logs and look at raids, you'll realise that unless you are top 0.1% hybrids are perfectly viable. You'll also notice that the massive majority of private server players are entirely garbage at the game.
---
Things like ely shamans and chickens are incredible at nuking, but naturally have their mana issues. Making them great at pushing phases and taking out priority mobs, while not topping the dps meters.
---
If the elitists were correct about their dreams a raid would be warriors, priests and mages. Making you lose out on all the utility and advantages of a varied roster
---
"Bring your friends to azeroth but don't forget to go outside azeroth with them as well."
---
And, "Killing guards gives no honor." are my favorite 
---
No no no. Old animations, old models. They still have all that stuff. New graphical settings may happen, like higher density of objects, further draw distance, and higher resolution models, but they should all be the original assets.
---
Not me! But I bought a gaming chair for the sole purpose of it forcing me to have good posture. The first few days were rough, I was legitimately sore those first few days. 
---
Do you mean stormwind? Silvermoon is the Belf city in TBC.
---
Can't get the quest until level 28. 14 not gonna happen.
---
Any source that they have said that? I agree with you on this matter but IIRC blizzard was silent on this issue since blizzcon and all the conversation was within the community.
---
Don't play then.
---
You create an alternate that's specifically geared, specced, etc. to farm and/or act as a mule.
---
Grimm Total Annihilation is what did it for me. Completely changed how i viewed the game.
---
ATTENTION!! ATTENTION!! EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION INSIDE!!
---
*click*
---
nothing of value
---
To each their own. I just enjoy the thrill of competing with others on a fresh start, getting fast to 60, gear up and clearing the raids fast. I enjoy this for like 2-4 weeks max at that pace, and then relax and play alts and stuff. When new content hits, I play more competitive again. It's just what I enjoy. Actually I started on different vanilla servers on release just to experience the first weeks on a new server.
---
It's like saying "I can’t understand how some people run for x hours straight just to be completely exhausted after the run and didn’t smell the flowers. I enjoy going on a slow walk with my friends and picknick with a beer and enjoy the nature". People like different things, it's that easy. I played with that mindset back in 2004 and I still play games that way in 2019. I don’t want to sound unfriendly or something, just want to make clear that I think it’s okay that there are different ways to enjoy games, including classic wow. There were competitive people back then, there will be competitive people this summer. Go on your pace, play with likeminded people and enjoy classic, just like I will too! :)
---
yeah but im gonna be playing on my main for a while before i make an alt, i just want to chill. Doesnt need to be super efficient money making, just decent.
---
Hah, good try! Everyone knows there are no girls on the internet.
---
Spec 30/0/21 elemental and Farm some DME lashers.  You can do enough runs to hit the dungeon reset cap.  Also, you want to be an herbalist for this because there are multiple dreamfoil and gromsblood nodes near the lashers. 
---
Once you get some nice Resto gear, you can farm the DME bosses with a warrior.
---
Can that spec heal some raids?
---
I mained a warrior through the entirety of vanilla, and switched to priest during wrath.  Haven't played since.  Thinking back on it after the launch announcement I'll be playing warrior again.  There were too many things I just didn't get to do due to poor internet/pc problems.
---
I had lots of fun, and cannot wait for another crack at at.
---
It’s simple. We will have retail subscriptions. If they don’t listen we group up on retail and Zerg major cities crashing the game. That should get there attention!
---
I feel like this is a picture taken by your wife at the time to be used in the future divorce case.
---
I'm strange. I enjoy ret. Lol I like being able to solo shit others cant. And I don't have to worry like rogues and warriors about my pulls. Especially later levels.
---
&gt;Something doesn't have to be illegal to be an act of aggression. And no, what tactic are you on about? This is some serious Trump follower paranoia you're going with here. You don't get to tell people what hurts them and what doesn't. End of story.

Can you give me 3 examples of acts of aggression that involve no physical threat? The definition I was using for "act of aggression" required some type of objective threat to life, property, or health. If you want to expand the definition of a "threat to health" including words that hurt your feelings then I declare all democratic candidates to speak purely words that hurt my feelings, as well as all people who disagree with Trump getting 10 more terms. (using your strawman as an example)
---
&gt;It has NOT become a generic term for "bad guy". I have no idea where you pulled that out of.
---
Typical leftwing tactic, deny with no information, I wrote 5 or so paragraphs and I get 1 sentence denying something but giving no information, you just look nervous. It is an insult like the C word, or B word, or A word. It doesn't mean "I'm going to attack you following this word". Sure it might invoke other historical meanings but so do all the other words, but what it comes down to is it's a "hurt your feelings" word.
---
&gt;You give people "permission" to use the N word? Anyone who says, "COOL! Gonna start dropping the N-bomb now!" is a fucking idiot. You and your friends sound like a bunch of socially maladjusted morons. Enjoy your block.
---
Coward.
---
You are witch hunting now, calling me a Trump follower without knowing me.
---
Mincing words like aggression, cutting in line is violence!! Hate Speech is violins!!! It isn't a tactic, you abusing language is wrong.
---
That’s how it has been working on pservers.  It feels much more situational because of the ‘in combat’.  You basically need to sneak up on someone so they don’t engage before you use it.  
---
I hope he knows I am kidding, better than my fat ass pudding sticks being draped over a mouse.
---
RETRIBUTION?! George, we talked about this!
---
Okay sweet, I was so confused after doing some reading to get a better idea of what is happening.
---
Would it be comparable to playing on a private server or would it be smoother?
---
Please make a video of this lmao. If hunters can solo Scholo with +arcane gear, I see no reason Starshard Arcane Priest can't be closet OP. But if you kill me in classic, I will be so beyond tilted lmao
---
Could you elaborate? I'm having a hard time figuring out what your post is trying to state.
---
There will definitely be more competition for the demon spawns. Hopefully blizzard enforces a strict policy that bans people who intentionally spawn the cleaner. But as far as actually doing the quest; at least this time around we know all the proper strats and consumes for it.

This is a pretty standard PvE spec.  You have to micromanage your pet to avoid getting it killed.  
---
Soooo... Nothing on Friday.  
---
No worries! It happens :)
---
This is the big question for sure.  We just don't know how blizzards infrastructure will handle large numbers of people, and I suspect that it just can't.  If that is the case blizzard need to come out and say it rather than keeping the issue up in the air.
---
You meant Rise of the Runelord right?
---
All the featured World locations are alliance (1 neutral). Feels bad man.
---
Well, probably much smoother.
---
It's using Blizzard's new server architecture which is of course an improvement over what they had before, and probably better than what people have done with their recreations. So, server wise, handling player interactions and lag, it should most likely be better than private servers.
---
In terms of latency though, private servers are often hosted in Europe or Eastern Europe, and who American players playing on those servers are pretty far away. So, latency will surely be better, as each continent and area will have their own dedicated servers.
---
In terms of graphics, because they are using new client programs but with old art assets, there should also be improvements in things like framerate and rendering compared to the Vanilla client that people still use to connect to private servers.
---
So, yeah, it should be much better than private servers!
---
The blizzcon demo back last year had some old animations still in the game, but we can assume they will be taken out before the actual release, as the demo just represented where they were at the time, not what the final product would end up being.

I played lock when wow first came out. Got rolled by a hand of rag enhance once. Ever since I have dreamed of being able to do similar and I'm currently torn between shaman or once again going lock. I have no issue healing since as I aged I kind of shifted to a more support play style anyways.
---
But I have fond memories or warlock and they are also really fun in pvp
---
I'm not sure if this is the only official word on it, [but here's Lore's bluepost](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769548630#post-15)
---
This may not be explicit enough for some, but seems clear to me they only intend to use it at launch, and possibly for some niche reasons to prevent a crap experience.
---
But that post *does* explicitly say they understand the community aspect and towns/etc. so I'm not worried personally.
---
Sharding is a good thing at launch in the starting zones. It sucks, but it's better than server queues or crashes from a business perspective. The amount of players who stop playing classic at launch due to sharding will be dwarfed by the amount of players who stop playing due to queues or crashes. The average player will be so much more invested by the time AQ comes around that server queues are the way to go. When the nost devs went to blizzard for a meeting one of the topics of discussion was how they dealt with such high populations on one server. That alone should tell you that is what blizzard wants. My personal idea is that instead of dynamically sharding during AQ, they should dynamically reduce server afk timers during queues. So if a server has a queue, drop down the afk timer to like 5 or 10 minutes. So instead of implementing a system other than queues, they could create a system that simply lowers queue times, making them less bothersome. 
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
I'm really hopeful because Blizzard has stated that they agree sharding goes against the integrity of Classic but I also know that their server tech runs differently than it used to and takes sharding into account, so it actually struggles with more people in one area than Vanilla did.
---
I'm really hoping they have a solid solution for the long term after the launch. Something like AQ event being sharded in Classic would absolutely ruin it. Even a gigantic 'Hillsbrad vs Southshore' could be a problem if it was implemented for higher loads long term.
---
There will probably be a decent gap between launch and MC Availability for raids, so you will have time. Secondary professions make alot of gold, so you can roll with mining or herbalism and not have to fight mobs very often. Other option is to farm with a group(You can farm specific dungs like Strat for Righteous orbs). Fishing and Herb will both be in higher demand when MC opens and people start raiding. You can level both of those and be pretty self sufficient. 
---
I’ve levelled with frontstabbing to 60 with 300ms and also one in my country with 5 ms. Not sure what you’re talking about.
---
wait they were gathering together to do what? sorry, i never played during classic.
---
Friends are a crutch.
---
Or they just want to deviate a bit from OPs parameters while remaining generally on topic.
---
I have the same grip bro no shame, I workout almost everyday but I’m a nerd at heart
---
There were restricted chat privileges in Vanilla? I played Vanilla and I don't remember this at all.
---
Not saying it wasn't a thing, I just don't remember it. What were the restrictions? 
---
You can have multiple characters, don't worry about it. Make a warlock and whatever else, play them and see what you feel like sticking with. Leveling a character to 60 is a big commitment, but starting the game with a character doesn't force you ro play it until endgame.
---
I was pretty decided on playing resto shaman but now I actually think I'll main the first character I got to 60, which was a druid. I'll only know for sure once I start playing.
---
What’s a reckful?
---
You absolutely can. In vanilla, certain quest chains only required you to be high enough level to accept the first quest in the chain, and continue all the way to the end.
---
Hell, I even have a level 17 hunter in retail that still has the weapon.
---
People can play how they want, i simply said i don't really get it.
---
I don't think if someone has never experienced vanilla WoW that it is a good idea to rush to 60. I really really don't.
---
I'm a fairly competitive person. Like in games like Starcraft i play competitively, and at a pretty high level, i just think WoW is a casual and relaxing game, it doesn't have that competitive aspect, although i know Blizzard have turned it into that with arena and the world first race and all of that. But hey, if you enjoy competiting to be server first MC clear or whatever then that's fine. Again, i'm totally cool with it even though i don't understand.
---
Yes, it's the spec that people who don't want to commit fully to healing run.
---
It would benefit me personally but it wasn't around at the time. Leave things alone. I'm seeing a new rash of "I never played vanilla but..." Cool. You're about to get the chance to. Don't strive to ruin it before you ever even experience it.
---
Not to be rude but you're wrong about basically everything you said.
---
&gt; We just don't know how blizzards infrastructure will handle large numbers of people, and I suspect that it just can't.
---
That's where the language is vague.
---
"Sharding is for server stability"
---
\- Blizzard
---
Most people are translating that as "servers (hardware) can't support more than 14 people at once so they need sharding, the sky is falling"
---
Others interpret this as "servers (the community) can't support low caps at the start due to X, Y which will lose 2/3 of players, so let's up the cap by 3x (and shard the start) so when it's stable, it's normal."
---
Their servers CAN handle large amounts of people at once.
---
Sharding is to stabilize servers (the community) not servers (the hardware)
---
I used this for years!
---
Sure he kills the gnome and then blinds the warrior and edits that part out. /yawn
---
The kind of person who was too impatient to wait for a queue was never going to play Vanilla WoW, and I'm okay with that.
---
My back hurts looking at it, personally.
---
Upvote for Bladerunner meme!
---
If you think rogues and mages get shafted in tbc you're mental
---
Those Altec Lansing speaker sets though. Classic. 
---
Because you're no longer 13.
---
I kill two dwarves in the morning.
---
So am I. The problem is that guy's $15 dollars is just as valuable to Blizzard as ours. So being as inclusive as possible without changes to the actual game is an expected reality. 
---
This is what i really hate. I have my opinions on sharding, and someone people disagree - fine. But Blizzard needs to actually say what the problems are and discuss it.
---
Can their servers not handle it? Have they tried? What does "starting zones" mean? How long will it be there for? Have you considered other solutions? If the servers cant handle starting zones, how will it handle AQ events or massive city raids? Or just xroads raids even? How come private servers have handled all of these things with no sharding?
---
You know, just basic questions that the community could discuss.
---
They've been pretty good lately about communication, they just need trust the community again and just say what's going on.
---
How so?
---
awesome tyvm
---
The MM looks like what I'd build, but the BM 20 and SV 0 pointers surprise me. Not saying you are wrong, I just didn't think the pet would get any talent points spent on it in a MM build. Maybe the pet is a bigger part of the damage dealt than I thought.

For personal DPS survival is the best, but hunters tend to go marks for Trueshot Aura as giving 100 ap to 4 other members of your party is going to result in more DPS overall than you getting 15% extra agility and some 3% crit. I never raided into late AQ or Naxx, so I don't know when that self increase to DPS is superior to TSA. 
---
Yeah but then all the people who take days off for work are going to be pissy when their entire day is ruined by an 8 hour queue, and then the game crashes and they have to wait another 8 hours. 
---
I'm of the opinion that the open weekend was the only beta you're going to get.
---
Best comment in the whole fucking thread :)
---
I'm not convinced that sharding is being implemented because they can't handle a lot of players in an area at once, I was under the impression that it was strictly being used to alleviate competition for mobs/nodes/quest items.
---
Yes, it is.
---
I've had this argument a million times with a million different people who blindly follow the "meta".  Yes, the meta builds are mathematically superior.  They aren't necessary.
---
They've been pretty clear about what the problems are, people just don't listen.
---
The big problem is tourists. If they just fill each server with 2500 people and then put a queue, what happens when 1500 of those people are tourists who quit in a week? The remaining 1000 people are on a dead server. 
---
One thing to note is that if you guys go paladin warrior you may find yourselves competing for gear while leveling. Obviously not so much of a concern once you’re 60. 
---
Yes, make sure you’re not assigned to be the tank healer because it’s more of a chain heal spam spec.
---
The spec would look something like this. 
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hizuVfMqZZV0ek0xo](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hizuVfMqZZV0ek0xo) 
---
The focus is on improved fire totems because that is where most of your damage will come from while AoE farming.
---
Pvp main- paladin
---
Pve main- priest
---
Luckily major events like AQ are a long way off. If Blizzard sees Classic as a massive success with a growing population, then they have time to dedicate resources to alleviating the need for sharding.
---
If it launches and we're at 50k players online during peak hours, they're just going to shard AQ because its not worth the development time to make massive code changes to the core of the game. 
---
As long as you say "No hemo" before you do it its okay.
---
good
---
Fuck yeah dude
---
That doesn't actually make any sense though.
---
Lets say you have 20 servers and 100,000 people who want to play. So make 10 servers with 2.5k cap and let the rest sit in queue. Then when half the people leave you're left with perfectly populated servers.
---
The whole issue stems from the fact that Blizzard, and some people, refuse to let some people sit in a queue and not play at 00:01 on launch day. Yes, if everyone has to play from the start then you may run into the dead server issue. But it doesn't have to be like that.
---
In regard to the starting zones, I'm sure it's a mix of both. No doubt starting zones will have ever mob and node killed and looted within seconds of it spawning, so that's definitely part of the issue.
---
Lots of players in one area at once is still a problem though. The way Blizzards server tech works now accounts for sharding, so the game actually has a *harder* time handling lots of players in one area than it did back in Vanilla.
---
The hope is that they can handle this and won't use sharding as a solution but there's always a chance that they use sharding. 
---
They would probably have issues with stability right at launch. Having all the players in a handful of zones, the game will never be as densely populated as it is in the first few days/weeks. 
---
What was his talent build? I don’t see preparation 
---
You're under a delusion that servers will naturally fill with non-tourists over time. That isn't true. You make a 2.5k cap, it fills up, the queue is still filled with tourists who are going to quit in a week. You could have 10,000 users registered on a server and all 9000 of them could be tourists.
---
The question is how heavily are tourists going to outnumber dedicated players? 
---
lol, he does look like him.
---
And it's no reason to do so since sharding does the exact same thing, is a technology that works simpler and easier and also is something Blizzard already have.
---
People cry for no reason what so ever because they associate sharding with something bad, and don't see why it could be used for something good. 
---
Hi! My best recommendation is to put these questions to the show’s discord! You’ll find the link on the show’s website :)
---
charge pulls depend on it being a safe fight. You will take burst damage from all nearby mobs.
---
if you need to pull a mob to fight somewhere back in an isolated area then u LOS pull and while the mobs are running someone can CC some of them
---
Bro I used to do stuff just like this. 
---

---
It worked on private servers though. 5k cap. 8k queeu. After a month it was like 5k cap, 500 queue. So all the tourists left and it was fine.
---
Classy
---
To see what happened when we turned in the Nefarian head quest. It was kinda disappointing, lmao. Also they just wanted to ask questions and congratulate us.
---
Ok, say that hypothetically, that exact situation happens.  I don't see a problem.  If endless mobs of people are fleeing BfA, then either classic WoW is incredible, or BfA truly sucks.  We the players get to choose and enjoy the best version of WoW, and Blizzard continues to lounge on beds of cash.  They still get our subscription fee no matter what version of the game we play, and they can always try to lure players back with new expansions.
---
We're talking potentially up to 5 million tourists, not 8000. 
---
amazing.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a private server thing to stop level 1s from advertising gold farming websites. You can most definitely make a level 1 and start chatting straight away
---
oh that’s neat. so the quest was a long and difficult one, i’m guessing?
---
Honestly we were disappointed when we found out it gave the exact same buff as Onyxia, lol.
---
DM won't be released until the second patch though?
---
How much would you sell an opening for?
---
That's just a matter of scale though.
---
I believe you had to be level 10 to private message people. I could be remembering things wrong though as it's been 14 years.
---
Bet those speakers were sold as "Stylish" or "Design" types.
---
No
---
Old class for my main. I still play my original warrior from vanilla in BFA, but I kinda fancy recreating her in classic.  
---
More than class, I'm excited to try another faction. During vanilla I was pretty obsessed with faction loyalty (still am, honestly) but I promised myself this time I'd make a Horde character. No promises on hitting lvl cap with it, though. ;)
---
Not really.
---
Good luck trying to hold aggro spamming battle shout.
---
While it does generate more threat overall, reapplying the buff to someone that already has it doesn’t generate threat. That’s how it worked in vanilla, and Pservers do t do it that way.
---
My natural grinding position was laid back in a reclining computer chair with my feet up on one side of the L shaped desk, monitor and keyboard other side of my legs. With my mom dropping dinner off during raids lol. 
---
She tolerated it is the best way to explain her disposition lol. lucky to have that to be honest! No pics unfortunately.
---
The first quest in the chain requires level 16
---
In the environment OP is discussing, the raid environment. There is little reason to bring more than 1 or 2 mages or rogues. Rogues do well post Arp acquisition in sunwell. But for the majority of the xpac..
---
Haha! I know that feel. We had a few blizzards (no pun intended) that would wipe out my entire neighborhood. The cool thing was all my high school friends played, so we would text each other to get the hookup then (to our parents dismay) drag our desktops/laptops to their house to game.

---
Not the Blizzard server source code no, they have their own made-from-scratch reimplementation of a 1.12 server.
---
As it happens I tried 1-12 on a Tauren druid a week ago following Joana's new guide. 
---
It took me 3 hours to ding 10. First time playing a druid and questing in Mulgore since Vanilla.  
---
I think my druid alt was something like lvl 35 back then so I don't have a real depth of experience here, it's just my 2 cents.  
---
Unless I change my mind (which happens about every 30s lol) I don't plan to main a druid at release, I just wanted to see Mulgore again. 
---
It was so tedious to lvl that I explicitly didn't follow the guide and went for bear form as soon as I dinged lvl 10. Killing mobs on a lvl 1-10 druid is clearly not fun.
---
However kudos to Joana he knows what he's doing : I saw that I lost a lot of time traveling between Moonglade, Thunderbluff and the Barrens. The bear quest implies to go back to TB 2 times I think. It seems Joana's way is the right way however that's going to be very very tempting to run for bear form, especially in the cave where you have to kill the goblin boss : very risky without bear form, lots of potential adds that you can't manage in "tauren form".
---
Oh and you have to kill a lvl 12 mob to complete your BF quest. The mob will pop right on you, I died the first time, it was easier the second time since you can engage it from far away (unless if on official server the mob depops).
---
Depending on your objectives, it might not be a good idea to go for a druid (if you want to be server first). I think druids take too much time to reach their true potential, around lvl 30 I think. But you want to be in the first lvl 30 to let the pack of players behind you.
---
Maybe you can find another player to group until you ding lvl 12, I'm sure it would be faster even with half XP from mobs.
---
Rogue, as I never really played them on vanilla or after. Mayhaps a warlock later for same reason
---
Yeah but is it more fun for me (the healer). Pretty much set on paladin though :-)
---
What? You don't know Reckful,how the fuck? He was a really good PvPer until Blizzard banned him.
---
Entirely speaking about the screechers that ramble on about talent changes or any other extremely obvious points that Blizzard will not change.
---
In PvP, paladin is more defensive, priest is more offensive. Shadow is also hard to gear for unless you're going to rank (the cloth raid gear is going to go to mages and locks before you). Paladin is a lot easier to play and is highly effective at what it does. A lot of people enjoy the simplicity. If you do then you should play paladin. 
---
My dudes got that new Nokia to keep tabs on all those webcam chicks he stays slaying
---
I'll say it once, I'll say it a thousand times. Server log in queues are way better than shitty sharding. 
---
thing is I am not a huge fan of leveling and have a lot less time to play than back in the day so whatever I main is going to be a majority of my time haha. Think I am going to go new though I still remember original days but played enough warlock for a lifetime. But could see me changing my mind last minute haha.
---
R/battlestations is still active right?
---
He's also confusing everyone that gets sick of obnoxious queue times with tourists. I would have given up on him 3 comments ago.
---
If you can't be patient enough for server queues you won't be patient enough to even play the game past level 20 
---
This was my first thought, vanilla "blizzlike" servers tend to have the highest populations of any pservers.
---
way to just steal someone else's work
---
That's my position nowadays, I guess a lot more relaxed and easy going than I was 15 years ago
---
Should be Vanilla. You can use the ring on Rend event to summon Vaelastrasz to fight for you.
---
10g is usually the standard fee. 15g If you also have a Jed ID.
---
I get the server community aspect of this, which is why I'm not in total dissent with them implementing sharding for the launch of Classic.
---
However, sharding is still used in retail for instances of high population density in smaller general areas. Part of this is almost assuredly for hardware stability. There have been quite a few examples in recent time where large scale world PvP gatherings have d/c'd people out of the game due to the stress on the server.
---
I know this was possible in Vanilla, especially for massive full server events like the AQ opening, but we're getting major issues in retail with substantially smaller events and gatherings.
---
Hopefully I'm just over concerned and this won't be a problem for Classic at all.  
---
I don't think watching PVP videos are the right way to choose your class.
---
Don't forget that the videos only shows you perfect encounters where they prevail.
---
They don't show you all the miserable failures.
---
And think about your other activities too : you will need to level, farm and run dungeons / raid.
---
I found an instant 60 pserver, I have a trusted farm spot that allows me to judge the possibilities of a class.
---
Rogue was high on my list before running it threw this spot, but it's too damn squeeshy.

I’m not convinced WoW Classic is suddenly going to lose 2/3rds of their player base due to Tourists. That figure is simply too high, and I think unrealistically pessimistic. Take out the “Mass Exodus” theory and all you have is a QoL argument. Sharding isn’t NEEDED, Classic will survive without it.
---
Love this straightforward and detailed guide!    
---
I've been asked to write a similar guide, but I've not wanted to put forth the work that you have done.  Now I don't need to.  Thank you:)!
---
It's both.  I would love your theory to be correct, but it's been proven multiple times that their servers can't handle even moderate populations in the same zone without freaking out.
---
I streamed it too, the demo. I tried for a long time and couldn't make it work, u sure about this?
---
Yes - OEB is very strong. Dal'rends are swords, so you don't get the glancing blow damage increase.

&gt;the fantasy genre was just a big mainstream deal back then with Lord of the Rings in the cinemas and World of Warcraft was the ideal game to satisfy the demand.

And I guess the more recent version of this happening would be Game of Thrones and Skyrim then?
---
Sennheisers and a gaming chair? Is there anything you’ve bought that you haven’t posted in this thread??
---
Absolute gaming warlord holy shit
---
The company stance was that it wasn't cost effective before. They found a way to make Classic where they didn't have to basically remake the entire game, again this is something they explained.
---
First of all, why in the hell would the casual players leave retail (the casual friendly experience) for a casual-esque classic which wouldn't be anywhere near as casual friendly as retail.
---
Second of all, if they go down the casual route for Classic (which is completely idiotic I might remind you) you have a LOT more things to worry about than simply sharding.
---
Man I gamed burning crusade hard in my grandmas computer lol. Once I got mine then I was a mess staying all night but dam was it fun

Nothing meme about bashing skulls with The Unstoppable Force.

Look at all those traveler's backpacks.  You musta been rich!

I roll dwarf priest because dwarf is the superior race in every game.
---
Stats and skills be damned.  If you arent a dwarven rogue, warrior, priest, paladin, or hunter .. you're definitely not the best you could be.
---
I mean ... Come on.
---
Gear I'm not overly concerned with as with my brother being a tank we shouldn't have any issues farming shadow (or ret) gear for myself. I'm leaning towards Priest as I think Shadow is better than Reck Paladins for solo PVP which is mostly what I'll be doing.
---
Having all of those defensice CDs though as a Paladin are awesome and my brother also being plate may make it easier at 60 as once we clear content we can go back and any of the STR gear he doesn't need anymore could go to me for Ret/Reckadin.
---
Hmm.
---
Without fear ward, berserker rage didn't cool down fast enough under the old timings. And feared tanks didn't hold aggro while feared. Not sure what private server you're taking about but Magmadar was always two tanked in progression in Vanilla.

They still had desks back then...

I was actually hoping this would be a thing. Really breaks up the same ole same ole as far as races.
---
We can just browse Reddit during the 3 hour queue.
---
That posture is killing me.
---
No matter what class you're about to pick, it's just tough to turn down that human racial bonus reputation.  With all the different factions to grind, it's hard to pass up.  They also have the sword and mace racial bonus for melee classes.  Also, if you have a thing about being short, then it's night elf or human.  
---
Additionally, the human style of armor and scenery is a nice balance.  Not super high fantasy like elves and dwarves, but still a bit fancy and civilized compared to horde cities.  All in all, humans are a solid neutral balance of good stuff.  
---
Yeah, I installed it on my moms laptop (didn’t have my own PC) back in the day, she got real pissed haha
---
Blizzard hasn’t released a server lost yet so no one can say where they’re going. 
---
It can be a long trip yeah. But it's one of those places that is well worth it. Great loot for every class in there. And because it's so far out, groups usually get together with the idea of doing multiple runs.
---
Quite a bit actually, lmao. I really enjoy quality PC peripherals and have dumped some serious money into it. 
---
This is what peak performance looks like
---
At the end of the day everything you just said is speculation, and while it is probable that it will take place on at least one of the servers as population declines, it certainly wasn't true of all 2.5k servers in vanilla, and it certainly won't be true of all servers in Classic. With games like OSRS outshining their sequels who even knows how many people classic will draw over time. Also with Blizzard's marketing of the game being nonexistent you can almost be certain that a steady trickle of new people will come into the world as word spreads. People seem to think "tourists" will make up half of the realm population and all quit at the same time and kill the world (of warcraft), but that makes no sense. People will come and go at all different times, populations will wax and wane with content buckets, the sky isn't falling, and the answer to future problems isn't drastic changes to game design now. If there comes a day where all the servers are as you described, there are plenty of solutions, none of which need to be implemented now.

I hope she likes cookies xD

---
Holy shiet is that an old dell, I think i had that computer, I recognise the weird AF speakers. 
---
Been over a decade.  I recently jumped on a nostalgic server to kind of see what I remember...  And I cant believe it but I still remembered the run from IF to Auberdine to meet up with Nelf players.
---
I did not remember getting so horribly harassed by the wetlands crocolisks for some reason.  🤔
---
My main character started as human warlock. For some reason I gave my account to a friend since I went to college and was convinced I would just never play WoW again lol. But got it back and warlock was on a different server. Eventually I server transferred him again but then switched to horde (blood elf). Think there was one more server transfer in there. But yea totally know the feeling of playing original character haha.
---
But that's why I think I want to break away from warlock. All i have really played (besides like rogue to level 50 something and druid to 40s). Just have so much memory with that one char, not sure I really want to remake him. But at the same time I kinda want to lol.  My whole thing is I always wanted the Tier 2 (nemesis) warlock helm. I killed Onyxia like... 40 fucking times and never got it and it still haunts me to this day. So kinda want to try again but doubt I would play enough to get back into raiding. Although killing Nef again would be pretty sweet. I actually like rage quit the game and my clan since after killing that bitch for  like a year Nemesis helm finally dropped and the only ones who didn't have it were me and this new person that just joined the clan like couple weeks before. And they gave it to new warlock since they had more DKP or w/e than me lol. I mean.... I get it... but that made me so angry than I just said fuck this game haha. Well I guess I did play after that but then I was an immature shit head in clan and just like.... fucked up our MC raid and shit and tried to join other clans. Never forgave clan for that haha. Petty shit but w/e don't think they knew how bad I wanted that damn helm. 
---
its insta cast
---
No confirmation. They have mentioned HD models in the past as something they *might* do, and there were other modern graphics options in the demo client. The only thing we can say for certain is that the old models will be there.
---
Check out some of the old pics of Quakecon. It’s so white in there it’s blinding. 
---
They specifically mentioned aq40 as a time when sharding would be unacceptable. It's such a stupid example to use.
---
Came here to say this. Great soundtrack and editing for the time!!
---
One thing people forget or miss is that stormstrike debuffs stack. I know I know the precious meta with all 8/16 slots accounted for.

Are you that Gael PvP druid video maker from Feenix times ? If so, love your vid, and hope you'll be there when classic hits :)
---
Nah they had the invasion events they had Halloween rare spawns etc.
---
I feel like so few people have played heroes 3. Always happy when I see more
---
Lasts all day for me. The hair where the band-thing goes over the head, and the hair around the ears gets pressed inwards, and I end up looking like an absolute moron
---
That's just not true, have fun getting dc'd in a raid and your night is over cause you're behind 1000 people. Queues were absolutely hated during vanilla.
---
ya god damn goon
---
dnt care about you role players, you are not actually playing the game just dress up in a fairy costume in real life.
---
A question ofr the ubernerds, where is that location on the screen? It looks familiar but I can't quite put my finger on it. Awesome pic!
---
Magmadar fears for 8 seconds every 30 seconds. Berserker rage gives fear immunity for 10 seconds every 30 seconds. I'm not totally positive how these would have been before 1.12 but we'll be playing 1.12 for classic so I'd say with high confidence that this is how'll they'll be on classic.
---
All you need to do is watch your timers and cast your berserker rage so the tail end prevents your fear. You'll always have it up for the next panic(mag's fear). Therefore, you do not need fearward or multiple tanks as long as you pay attention and time your berserker rage properly.
---
It does have a cast time
---
Its really easy to tell who here has never experienced the launch of an expansion, let alone vanilla.
---
Orc warriors are broken and best race for everything don’t @ me

What?? Not sure what premades you’ve played in but... rofl

This.
---
Classic does have me excited to get out of my comfort zone. I've always been super casual, more interested in RP and lore than PvP or raiding. But I'm really gonna push myself to try new things this time. 
---
private server, but this guy/gal is [sensational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3VZjtX82oU)  I had two twink druids in vanilla/bc and a 60/70 (that I only pvped on a little) and blossom is so fun to watch that it almost makes me want to play druid again.
---
Tror alla hade en sån logitech kamera på den tiden, lol
---
I can't resist a good plug, and the [WoW Speedleveling Discord](https://discord.gg/w8ttZZF) just started a Classic channel, yesterday, that can help you with that.
---
Biletoad it is.

That's awesome. How can you tell if there is a Jed ID?

Oh of course! Plus you can shapeshift out, toss on a regrowth shapeshift back. It's amazing. Plus stealthing in in cat form. And I could go on, it's a great time to be a druid. I reached level 39 and just stayed there for like 6 months enjoying WSG. 
---
I was in your position until recently. It helped me to make a list of every class; you can include pros and cons if you like and/or rank them to your preference or viability in pve and pvp. 
---
Despite reading many online resources that gave me most of the pros/cons etc, I found writing it down myself made making a decision easier. 
---
You’ve got time to make a decision so maybe just try and eliminate classes off the list until you’ve got your class. 
---
&gt;  shapeshift out, toss on a regrowth shapeshift back
---
who needs that? There is alwyas some priest or something in the group, chasing me with instant-cast heals. All I need is Travel Form to clear root, and then once I get slowed in travel form, I cat'n'dash and I'm now even faster.

they just look very majestic and the gear (especially on warrior and paladins) just matches so well. also they have a very straight posture, which most other races dont have.
---
The only person in this thread stating an opinion is you, Embriel has been stating sourced points made by the original designers of the game, all of which you've ignored and said "lol no I know better because I played on a Pserver and it was good". Buddy I played Vanilla-wrath, Nost, K 3, LB, and ND, and while non-blizzlike populations had their benefits, none of it was Vanilla, and Ion and his merry band aren't in the kitchen whipping up chocolate or whatever flavor you seem to want.
---
Damn dude, what ever server you're on, I want to join that one. This is the kind of attitude the community needs!

If I could afford to throw you a gold or Plat I would.

---
Okay, thanks for the feedback.
---
How is that fair to crappy classes then, like to stay OP for 10+ years is just rediculous 
---
hmm, I actually did play on feenix, and even on prismatia and valkyrie. 
---
In fact, I was always googling around, and couldn't find any other server but those three. And I was surprised how there is such little interest about vanilla wow - 100 players online at peak times, on the only English-speaking blizzlike x1 server. Others were instant 60, XP x3, donor, and such shit.
---
Then, after dealing with that and solo leveling into 30s, some news website told me that Nostalrius is closing. Such a pity that it was such hidden and not indexed by google.
---
Repelling my prot/arms warrior. I was 14. Never got to tank a vanilla raid.

I'm still in touch with my female friends I met in raids (even if we got acquainted more than 10 years ago, lol).
---
There’s no time pressure with Classic. Play them all, the server will be there. No fear of missing out. 
---
Spriest and Shadowbolt spam locks made for a devastating combo for raid bosses. 
---
Size of realms and sharding is concerns for me.  
---
When it comes to resource nodes it will create bottlenecks if we allow bigger realms without bumping up nodes (I don’t want that).  
---
Sharding will hit us her also as either we double the spawn 1/shard or we get more spawns on the server.  
---
Black lotus is one of those things that would be worth shard jumping just to get.  Not to mention devilsaurs in Ungoro.  
---
I’m fine with sharding in the &lt;lv30 zones but above no. It will impact to much.  
---
A 90% lose of a population is insane and there is nothing to support this happening. 
---
This message is brought to you by the letter C.
---
They never said they would shard high level zones, and sharding past 20 is pointless. You have more choices of zones at 20 than you do at 10, and realistically most people will quit by that point.
---
Ret paladin here all the way. No holy spec. I salute you my meme spec brother. See you in the guild less bin.
---
There will likely be organized discords for each server, and level bracket LFG channels (and trade, and LFG, etc).
---
It's gonna be all on discord.
---
Legend, thank you 
---
Why?  If you're 26, you would have been either 11 or 12 in 2004 for Vanilla which is roughly as old as OP appears in the photo.
---
Your post got me curious I just tried it out. God bless you if you do it.

Pre lv30 will only affect Lakeshire really.  Ganking lowlevel alliance char is for some the best thing in the world. I just think it shows how bad your at playing your char that you have to kill a lv20 with your 50+ 
---
Dude, it was plain as day. Calm yourself.
---
I mean, if youre asking what classes are able to maximize your time most effectively..
---
Hunters are the fastest to level and they are great at farming.  They do suffer from not having a reliable pve/pvp hybrid spec but you can get the gold for respec pretty easily.
---
Warlocks and Mages have good leveling times and offer (to me) a more engaging experience than that of a Hunter.  Both can farm well but I believe Mage comes out on top over a Lock.  They have much more reliable hybrid specs that you can follow.  
---
The rest of them are noticeably slower, with Warrior trudging along at the bottom, so the above three would be my recommendation.  Druid 
---
To piggyback on this, if you don't know what you want to play, chances are you'll end up making 2-3 alts up to level 20-30 before you finally decide on what you really wanna play.
---
So just go out there, roll something and see how it goes. Don't try to be the fastest; there will always be someone faster than you.
---
There arent enough mobs to kill 2x as much as a solo so that means downtime. I dont doubt it is a good way to level up but its always a bunch of solo dudes leading the pack on fresh servers.
---
Lol you look stressed. “I need...I need soul shards but these gray items vendor for so much.”
---
Man such good times.

MSN o ICQ :)

I think an average of level 15 would be good.

It literally was not "plain as day". And the fact you both keep trying to say that im not calm, makes me think your now Sockpuppeting. 
---
Of course you could just be a retail hater jumping on. Since jumping on people for daring to like ANYTHING modern is  common. And liking anything modern is appearently ground for spam comments and mass downvotes here.
---
The real difficulty in telling Blizz what we want/what is right, is how varied the opinions in WoW are. With each expansion people develop different mindsets and preferences for what "should" be in the game. Kind of like when youre driving, "Anyone driving slower than me is a moron, and anyone driving faster then me is freaking maniac.". I feel like the opinions here are just the same. A new player is going to have wildly different opinions than a Naxx raider, no one can argue with that. What I'm trying to point out, is that most of the people on this sub are in the 98% of people who are WRONG. 98% of you, when discussing things about Classic, are so wrong that I never would have imagined the things you reply with. And I'm a pretty imaginative guy, dont get me wrong. I just really needed to get that out there. Every time you see someone with a stupid opinion, you understand what I'm saying. Everyone with a "newer" opinion than you, is a moron and shouldnt be arguing about things they dont understand.  
---
tldr: Ultra nerds know what is best, and 98% of you have opinions that are not valid for SOME, IF NOT MOST of the big issues being discussed here. (sharding, content phases, pvp, itemization)
---
Search for Skarm Tank on youtube. Best tanking content I came across so far.
---
Saitek Eclipse keyboard. Still have one that works today.
---
I'm really hoping for classic to become nowadays Michelangelo 'David' of (online) gaming industry—statue, reminder of quality, art and people endorsement...cause damn this regressed.
---
Are you basing this on the unfinished demo we had in October ? I have not heard about this at all. Even in the Blizzcon panel [it's was the old style water](https://i.imgur.com/ThNYXVQ.jpg). 
---
Treat Classic as infinity experience. Then the urge of choice becomes nonexistant. 
---
And as a vanilla progression raider, the short window where the tank was feared while clearing the debuff, the off tank held aggro, and they rotated who was holding for that period by starting their berserker slightly early. 
---
On farm, the minor period of fear was irrelevant sure. 
---
Nice sounds like we are similar age. Think  game came out couple months before I turned 15. 
---
Haha Maplestory on the other monitor as well. Another throwback game :). 
---
hunter is easiest to level and farm
---
warrior is hardest to do both
---
other classes are pretty close
---
That spec is mostly for squeezing out dps in MC. Most will go surefooted spec and macro their wolf howl to aimed shot.
---
I agree.
---
However trade will still be full of spam for this stuff too. 
---
So I think a lot of people are misguided when they talk about sharding. This isn't being done because blizzard tech cant ha dle massive amounts of people, but because they want to release a playable game on day one. 
---
I'm going to say it again and I'm sure people have already said it. Nost was not a valid "release" of classic wow. It had thousands of people logging on and doing starter zone quests at the same time. When I logged on back in 2004 I saw maybe 5-10 people around me until I got to ironforge. This was due to queues, bad internet connections or just people's pcs dying. This was the experience 5-10 people around you at a time, not 100. 
---
I think blizzard is much more aware of what you think of them. Ion has already said that the herb believe there should only be one azurgos, 1 lord Kazzak and things of that nature and they intend to keep it that way.
---
If you want to look at massive world pvp events like AQ opening then sure we can talk about it but I'm guess blizzard is already on the same page as us if they're talking about kazzak like they are. The opening of the gates was meant to bring hundreds of players together and make world pvp happen. Leveling 1-10 or 1-20 was not. They will not change their minds on this. If their servers could handle opening AQ back then, they can handle it now and I have full faith that they dont plan on changing anything.
---
They've expressed that they want us to have the authentic classic experience. They are doing their best to provide that for us, all the way down to spell batching. Why does anyone think that they will shard anything else past launch? Doesn't make any sense to me.
---
There wasn't even before they removed World chat.
---
raiding was pretty wild back in the day. A lot of wipes but felt so good when your clan started beating bosses for first time. Plus with 40 people harder to organize etc. Plus the whole idea of it felt sorta new I guess. Took forever to get gear too but when you did it felt great. Getting full legendary was a pain but felt great once achieved. 
---
I never really did a lot of pvp either. Warlock not really my fave to pvp with. Might try more pvp this time and actually like use a build thats good for it. Full Destro luck in pvp was really squish. 
---
I think it's almost inevitable that someone will build something like this.  And it's worrying, because the last thing I want to deal with when trying to join a pug raid is someone whispering me *"pls link WoWLFR.com account."*
---
yea that's the thing. Feel like until I  start playing I am going to change my mind multiple times lol. 
---
Bit later, I'm EU
---
Clearing the debuff? Just cast it in advance so the tail end of the berserker rage prevents the fear.
---
There is no clearing the debuff if you never even got it in the first place.
---
If you're referring to the Magma Spit debuff, the damage from that is so negligible that it is largely ignored other than the fact that you shouldn't face the boss towards the raid.
---
I don't know what type of guild yours was, but these strats were outdated even in actual vanilla.
---
The method I use to determine when I will enter an instance is considered by some to be too conservative, but it has always served me well.  
---
I take the final boss level and minus 2.  
---
For some classes this isn't as necessary and you can minus 3 or maybe even 4, but I would highly suggest this method for a tanking class. I personally use this method no matter which role I am playing.  
---
As an example, Archmage Arugal in Shadowfang Keep is level 26. I do Shadowfang Keep starting with a minimum level of 24.  
---
What old-school MMOs out there right now give you the impression that games like that are in high demand?
---
Assuming a very low-end number of 1,000,000 players around launch, that would leave you with 100,000 active users after a month. For reference, Nostalrius peaked around 15k actives.
---
If it means I get more groups, I'm not gonna complain.
---
Not healing, but shard of fallen star from trash between 3rd and 4th boss of aq40 scaled with SP pretty well. I remember our full judgement pally using it and doing good burst damage. 
---
I remember seeing a video about plains running that was done by I think madseasonshow. The ability had some issues with it like the fact that as long as you didnt take damage a hunter could run at mount speed while shooting enemies. 
---
Big bro got the top bunk hey?
---
What's the book?
---
also, /r/battlestations
---
well, what if we get banned for WTS Gold bar?
---
Does the German client allow more characters, some of those words on the list are super long.
---
God just implement a dungeon browser without a queue. Where is the issue. Jesus Christ...
---
also not rly true. On alot of fights, the druid is a beter tank when compared to the warrior. So they are infact the best in that area. Overall. You are gona see alot of guilds with a main tank druid tbh.
---
those hi rez character models are going to look dope in all that low rez gear right?
---
I’ve been in this position for a while and after playing every class on a pserver to at least mid 20s I think I’ve whittled it down to what I want to play. 
---
Ofc that isn’t fully representative of what it will be like at 60, but I’m guessing that if I like the feel of a class at 25 I’ll like it at 60.
---
I was worrying a ton about my role in raids, rotation, etc, but there’s so much more than raids to do endgame. I decided to drop all that and pick the class that feels the best and seems to fit my playstyle.
---
Its still from the beta. In mages description is still invisibility spell. Really cool site. Thnx for sharing.
---
I mean at the end of the day, if you appeal you're fine. Sometimes it can take a few days, they probably won't respond if they view it after it has already ended. I've never had to appeal personally so i'm not sure how the process goes.
---
If you're worried about your permanent record, submit a ticket about it, ask em.
---
Just be glad they don't perma-ban often like some games do
---
Buddy, my other comment was removed, I played on those servers (am still playing on ND) and vanilla, and you're stating just as much of an opinion as I am. None of this is about "flavor", and you can advocate for 2.5k realms all you want but at the end of the day blizzard spoke to nost developers (not you), and likely aren't going to cap servers at the old number. You can enjoy 2004 visuals and everything else, I like the MMO and RPG concepts of vanilla and I like populated servers.
---
Oh yeah, I don’t think it’s a bad thing. It’s part of the vanilla experience. 
---
That's my mistake then. I don't recall seeing or hearing anyone mention that so, if true, that's a big relief.
---
Still, I think it would serve the community immensely if Blizzard outlined their specific plans for sharding in Classic. 
---
What, you mean like most of the people who bought the game at release?
---
Because I was there, and they were **not** happy. The forums were practically in meltdown. The most common refrain was "Why am I paying $15 a month to wait in a queue?". People quite justifiably were annoyed that they couldn't play the game they paid for. There was even [a website](http://www.leagueofpirates.com/sirvival/queuedance.html) that sprang up that became quite famous at the time. Blizzard ended up gifting people free game time due to all the issues at release. It was terrible press for them at the time, and that was 15 years ago, before social media and Youtube. The outcry today if Blizzard launched an unplayable game would be 10 times worse. 
---
2020
---
mage is quite casual
---
paladin but a bit slow pace
---
druid isnt worth it without collecting different gear types
---
This. They also need to sort out their servers in both classic and retail, the current wow is aids when you have more than 20-30 players in same area, turns into sluggish mess.
---
But the main thing im afraid of, is that they utilize sharding beyond starting zones (1-10) ish.
---
Rogue, Warlock, Hunter
---
Yea. I had a few rl buds that played rogue during vanilla, and didn't have demo, ask about it, so I tested it for them. It's weird because no one has video online of them trying to do it. I didn't make a big deal out of because I figured everyone knew it worked by the time I streamed it.
---
You are stuck playing SM/Ruin warlock or Holypaladin/Hunter then
---
This is false.
---
Very recent proof: https://youtu.be/hQ8lsMZOu_E?t=120
---
Why the /sit wont work in classic wow?
---
I remember scouring every word and bit of media on this website over and over. The first I'd heard of WoW was with a little pamphlet that came in my Warcraft 3: TfT box, I literally mapped out in my head the places I'd go and explore, I used lego to act out stuff I wanted to do. I was maybe 10, fast forward to today and while I may not have the lego anymore I still feel the same excitement and hype for Classic's launch.
---
.. plus he's clearly playing world of warcraft, which was released in 2004..
---
there are addons like it but u gotta make them popular to be worth it
---
You are gollum.
---
That's retarded.
---
It's not even that. If their problems was mana you would see more hunters high on the meter on those 30 second bosskills where you can pop rapid fire on pull and nuke hard, but you dont see that.
---
Sustained hunter damage is just low. The reason they work for PvP is because they can burst hard on a 10 secondish cycle which works out great for PvP between traps and scatter shots.
---
I meant the existing one. That one from blizzard.
---
No. But I've done some digging for you:

Maybe someone can port if for you.
---
I use headset and microphone for most gaming stuff.
---
That too, but the slam spec 2handed did need it - I forget precisely why, or I may be mis remembering. I saw it again in a video some weeks ago tho
---
Yea it's definitely a good and concise guide, there's a couple things that won't work well on launch depending on server populations / sharding - like even some of the level 1 quests.
---
I leveled a warlock on a classic server not too long ago, but I didn't feel like druid was terrible. Moonfire is a very efficient DoT and pulling tool, and when you get to level 6, first thing I buy in bloodhoof is a white staff which carries you hard till the 2h mace from the caves.
---
Thorns is the best buff in a lot of ways, and you should prioritize grinding cats / wolves since they have high attack speed low dmg. 
---
I definitely am going to test and tweak with the route to see.how early I can push the bear form, without going to thunderbluff and back unnecessarily
---
This one we’re currently talking about. WoW Classic is literally being brought back by popular demand. 
---
Your figures are pure speculation, even WoW’s worst received expansions have had a better retention rate than 10%. You absolutely can not base your expectations on Pservers. WoW Classic has more peoples attention than just the Pserver vets. 
---
Yes there will be tourist, and yes a lot will leave. On the other hand we have no idea of knowing what percentage of the populations will in fact end up being tourists. Some of the people “Just trying it out” will stay, and I dont know why I dont see this mentioned more often. It is a very real possibility, and much more likely than a 90% player exodus.
---
*very* soon
---
The Cooldown matched fear exactly.  So tanks would manage their cooldowns and swap.  During progression.  That bit in mid to late 2005, where people were learning it.  And for new progression, people inexperienced with the way it works will do it again.  We're not talking Method taking out bosses on week 4 here.
---
And everything else is valid. Magmadar is one fight.  The OP was asking about how much DPSing he'll be doing.  In late progression/Shaz farm, he'll probably be doing plenty of it, but in the fun part of the progression, there's plenty of tanking, and strategies that maximize the boss kill over speed.  If your tank can stance dance perfectly, sure.  But plenty of progression is learning these skills in Classic since you barely ever need them outside raiding.
---
That's totally garbage... I love it.
---
Real men only have sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation once a month until fertilization occurs.
---
Looking nice. One thing that I think is missing from the guide is using Hamstring to fish for procs (Flurry, WF, BRE). Also spotted one typo (cript cap).
---
Good point on the grenades. I say warrior because same vein as rogues - uninterrupted, they will global a warlock just the same. Non SL warlocks. Warriors can break fears so it's like every warrior has the undead racial.
---
It’s confusing and annoying both aye. I guess they are planning to suffer through it for the rep rewards, like the mount (400g cheaper is it?)
---
[Spirit of Aquementas](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11904) this neat little offhand gave -25 mana cost to all spells making it really OP for all healers. Unfortunately it was changed in patch 1.5 to give spell power, but we might see it if blizzard decide to use older itemizations.
---
Sorry, I figured "too impatient to wait for a queue" would convey that I meant people who would quit the game entirely over a rocky launch. No, I don't mean like most people who bought the game at release, and continued to play/post on forums in spite of the issues. Hell I even support sharding, this isn't an argument against it.
---
Same here. I have to shower if I want to fix it. 
---
That's absolutely something that's missing, thank you so much for pointing that out! I'll definitely add a section for that in the next update.
---
That'd be because this is my first post on this sub. Your ridiculousness actually prompted me to post on a sub I only lurk on, so grats on that. Don't accuse people of sockpuppeting. I personally find "/s" to be awful, because I have almost never found sarcasm difficult to detect in text. It actually baffles me that some people have difficulty with it, especially in cases this obvious. Hell, I remember having entire units in English classes dedicated to discerning tone from writing, so it's not some arcane mystery or me just claiming to have some preternatural sense of intent..
---
But people apparently *do* have trouble with it. You didn't catch his sarcasm. That's fine. It's okay to be wrong, and I'm not saying that passive-aggressively. Instead, you decided to dissect his writing patterns as if you could somehow prove your interpretation correct. And now that someone else is telling you "hey, it was obvious to me," you're accusing the other guy of...inventing support for his own case by sockpuppeting? Because this is that important to anyone but you?
---
are you still hot?( had to be asked , we need to keep traditions )
---
When you kill either Onyxia or Nefarian from either raid Onyxia's Lair or Blackwing Lair they drop a quest item Head of which ever you killed after a very small chain go to stormwind/Orgrimmar and then talk to two people you can hand in the head for loot a small speech is said and everyone in Stormwind/Orgrimmar though i do believe at first it was only players in the trade district of each city got the buff.
---
Nef was a monster to kill.

---
Hunter’s pve spec is also great for pvp. 
---
It's so Vanilla!
---
Camera quality has come a long way in such a short time.
---
Hunters are pretty casual. They’re fast levelers and they’re very easy to gear up at 60. 
---
30 here
---
I was 24 back when i started playing in vanilla. I actually have more time on my hands these days than i did back then since ive long abandoned my party lifestyle.
---
You're saying the CD matches the fear exactly. You're correct but also wrong in interpretation.
---
Casting Berserker Rage grants fear immunity for 10 seconds. Panic causes a fear that lasts 8 seconds.
---
Therefore, if you precast berserker rage, you will offset their cooldown periods and never be feared for the duration of the fight. To your point on people likely making the same misunderstandings on classics release, I would say the average guild and even the average "below average" guilds will have at least someone in the raid that will know this or will look up the fight and learn this. As such, I would make the argument that this mistake will be almost non-existent just as it is on pservers today.
---
You also say everything else is valid. And you'd be right except Baron Geddon is also not a multi-tank fight. It has one debuff that is dispellable and is also resistable with enough fire resistance. That fight does not need multiple tanks at all unless you think you should swap tanks on the off chance the tank gets living bomb but in this case the dps should just stay out til he pops and the healers heal him to make sure he's topped for the landing.
---
In addition to what you've said, I think it's the best solution to allow sharding (only in the starting zones and only at launch) in order to most simply/organically account for the launch surge and then dropoff, while ending up with a healthy server population.
---
Essentially, sharding allows them to overpopulate the server at launch, to then end up with roughly the desired 'perfect' population later, with no intervention required.
---
By using sharding at launch, we shouldn't see any quickly-dead servers, and free transfers needing to be offered.
---
Ironically it should *foster* server communities, rather than damage them.
---
&gt; obvious.
---
&gt; You didn't catch his sarcasm.
---
&gt; Calm yourself.
---
Yeah still pretty sure your sock puppeting. An old account and a brand new one? First comment on this sub, every other being politics. Other account never being on politics? And both of you are ignoring my comment showing common ways to show sarcasm none of which were applied. Yeah bullshit. If you really did know how to show sarcasm and had spent a lot of time on here, youd see theres actual animosity on this reddit for fans of modern wow and would find his comment to be close to the norm. The fact that you say on BOTH accounts that im flat out wrong, is another big alert. 
---
if your not a dwarf warrior , are you really a warrior ?
---
Doesn't agility give 1 ap, and strength 2? 
---
Look cousin, you wait until they aggro some mob, once they get to about 50% HP you PoM pyro their ass 
---
There are ways to make fertilization occur more than once a month... #alpha
---
Is the cat still alive these days?
---
Wait were hunter tanks actually a viable thing? I know its unlikely they did high end content like bwl, but can they do things like Diremaul and ubrs? I've never even heard of the concept when i mained a hunter in vanilla.  
---
then you pick up ice barbed spear at 51 from AV quest and you're golden til 60
---
Sadly Reckful autism can't handle wow leveling, but i hope he give it a try
---
I recommend playing what your main was in classic. I'm playing classic for the Nostalgia so playing the class/race I did 15 years ago is the best way to do that imo. 
---
frost reflector, the eye of hakkar, shadow rune abuse (dark and demonic), anathema/benediction if you're a priest, engineering grenades, skull of impending doom, engineering net, tidal charm, jungle remedy(powerful antivenom/ elixir of poison protection are good as well, restorative potion is the best), limited invulnerability potion, crystal charge/restore, really sticky glue.
---
Naah, you go wand priest and stack agility with the talent.
---
I play WoW with a ps3 controller or my steam controller almost exclusively, i just hop to keyboard/mouse for intense PvP
---
For hunters, rogues, and druids AGI gives 1 AP. for warriors it gives none.
---
I don't know guy, between Embriel's evidence, the literal words out of the Dev's mouths, and the mission statement for this entire project being an authentic recreation of WoW and the community as it was, the evidence seems kind of stacked against your point. Randomly doubling the server population because some funservers did it goes entirely against that. "They talked to nost devs" might make me think otherwise if they were looking at recreating Nost, but I have the sneaking suspicion they might go with the numbers that the guys who literally created the game thought were best.
---
I played vanilla wow at launch. My mom let me skip school that day when I was 14. Queues never bothered me at all
---
This is from TBC btw
---
Its being brought by popular demand of WoW players, it will absolutely not bring any significant number of new players outside of the Blizzard eco-system. Look how badly Wildstar flopped, which is the closest comparison if you don't want to use private servers.
---
WoD at release gained 2.5 million subscribers, and lost 5 million the following year.  New expansion are also that - new. They bring in new content, not bring back outdated gameplay from 15 years ago. There is a reason hardcore MMOs are basically extinct.
---
well shadow priest is the best PvP class in vanilla so.
---
Cozy as fuck
---
Damn bro. I distinctly remember reading this for hours as well fantasizing about playing. I remember thinking how awesome it would be to see the building from Warcraft 3 on full scale, and go inside them. My young me was mind blown.
---
I didnt play during vanilla.
---
shadow priest pretty much uses an identical BiS set to mages.
---
You know you can change spec yeah? You can be any spec you want on any given day. I'll play a warrior and will tank a great deal but I certainly won't be prot the whole time.
---
"Prot" isn't even a single homogenous thing, there are many variations on prot that will get the job done.
---
Gotcha. I'd play what your main was when you did play, getting to play the same class in classic will be a fresh experience but still have some familiarity with the spells and the way the class is played. 
---
It's mostly just tanking 5m dungeons for fun, but some ultra-nerds have tanked Nef. They stack avoidance kinda like druids did before the armor buff and everyone has to watch their threat.
---
HMM, pet names have different list maybe? I remember I could not name my Hunters wolf pet Adolf, but that name is not on the banned list.
---
It sounds like you want to go alliance, but Orc and Tauren are good choices also.  Orc has the +axes, stun resist and beserkering.  This gives you increased threat and damage for PVE while also giving you one of the strongest PVP racials, the stun resist.  Tauren has the extra HP for tanking and my favorite PvP racial - warstomp.  Tauren is not highly rated by most, just by me :)
---
He wants to be feral!
---
Garrisons took a good few years lol, and aren’t even really player housing.
---
sounds weird since everyone said it didnt work and i tried myself and it didnt work, was it consistently working or like 1 time per 4-5 mobs?
---
For starters, Tipsout [H] has confirmed that he, Staysafe [A], and Esfand [A] will be rolling on a PVP server together.  
---
I have *heard* but not confirmed personally that Asmongold is rolling on a PVE server.  
---
That's all we have for now.  
---
The only research we can do is to go to each of their streams and ask them directly, but sadly my family has a slight genetic bias towards cancer, so I'd be at risk.  
---
Any brave souls willing to do some primary research in the field?  
---
Lil bro looks like; when can I play? You are 3 hours already... 
---
You only respec from PVE spec if you want Deterrence/imp wing clip/entrapment/more stamina TBH. You can PVP just fine in PVE spec, since the most important thing is scatter. 
---
as a shaman healer your best bet is probably finding a guild that farms righteous orbs.
---
This is gold
---
What server is that? I want to check out some old model animations.
---
Shard all 1-20 zones for the first week. After that pure vanilla. 
---
He only needed one hand :-) 
---
The release date will be given the last full week of April.  
---
I've heard that the +dodge is less-than-ideal for warriors.  Sure, less dodge is less damage taken, but you don't get rage from a dodge like you do with block/parry etc... I got the impression it was kind of like the Tauren HP bonus - sure a warrior could use that, but there are better choices.  Am I wrong?
---
No, no they weren't. At all. GTFO. I played from launch for fourteen years. Never had any issues like what you're talking about and neither did anyone I raided with. The only time random disconnects were an issue we're at launch, with hardware from the late fucking 90's
---
It's 2019 ffs. Ya'll are dumb af
---
Showed my true colors .... preferred Tauren to be honest
---
its called super ultra mountain climbing.
---
Warstomp is my favorte racial hands down.  I do Feral druid a lot, so having a 2 sec stun for when you are in trouble and pop out of bear form is so so nice.  I've been playing an Alliance druid and my warstomp is replaced by a healing potion in that scenario.
---
Not to be Negative Nancy, but either the OP is still using a CRT and Windows XP, or the cat is dead.
---
good that not the first of April
---
The quest was just a simple turn in but getting the quest item was insanely difficult. It took us 2.5 months, and we were the fastest.
---
So much this. Having shared an account with my older brother back in the day, the ~1 hour of play time I could snatch was literally the peak of my childhood days.
---
This time around I'm gonna rake it in  24 fucking 7 and idgaf.
---
I map my zoom in and zoom out on my keyboard, usually the + and - key on my numberpad.  Ain't nobody got room for that on their mouse :)

Gross. Just vanilla please.

I'm sure there were a thousand times worse thing even back then, we just weren't exposed to it.

Here's a list of them:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loading\_screen\_tips](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loading_screen_tips)

---
Asmongold would be wormtongue
---
There's a whole generation of fools that don't realize how big of an advantage true multi-channel is in a positional shooter. Also, they don't realize how stupid it is to not have their chief entertainment device (PC) not plugged into decent audio.
---
You'd drop $800+ on a 4k Gsync monitor. You'd drop $1k+ on a 2/1080GTX. For the love of god, you can get an amazing home audio setup for less than either. Get a 5.1 or 7.1 AVR like a Yamaha RX-V series and some decent satellites and an active woofer (Polk, etc). 
---
Hell, you can get a budget Onkyo Home-Theater-in-a-Box with starter versions of all this for about $300. This is LIGHT YEARS beyond anything your fancy headset is going to do for you.
---
HDMI from your video card was *made for this shit*.
---
We gave our third set of bindings to rogue, but at that point we were in naxx and it wasn't better than iblis/gressil(if you were lucky to see it and have the dkp). I ended with AQR and iblis and would of liked thunderfury for the aesthetics but if it was early vanilla I wouldn't take it from a tank. 
---
&gt;No, no they weren't.
---
Yeah people loved waiting up to 8 hours to play a game they pay for monthly.
---
&gt;Never had any issues like what you're talking about and neither did anyone I raided with.
---
Are you saying nobody at any point ever had a DC in vanilla? Because that is pretty obviously false.
---
&gt;It's 2019 ffs
---
Heard it here first, disconnects don't happen in 2019. 
---
I don't know how you could have typed any of that out thinking its good contribution.
---
If your a priest, your wand is your best friend. All the time. Even wand in raids when you can
---
Which podcast?
---
Who took the picture and did they appreciate  its historic significance?
---
Just pick the coolest name.
---
Countdown to Classic. It's on Spotify for sure but I think it's on just about everything.
---
Not even potential cycling? Every 3/4 years servers would roll over to continue the cycle as it has up until end of WoTLK? 
---
Bannable offense now btw
---
No thanks. Just vanilla. 
---
Was it literally the 1st, as in world 1st? Server 1st? Or guild 1st?
---
if you didnt have a cousin to play wow with back then you were missin out
---
3 years.... would be perfect
---
.5s cast time with a 60 second cooldown.  It's so strong.
---
Just vanilla with sprinkles please
---
Right?! Enough time to play the different patches and have stuff to do. But also having something new to look forward to? 
---
It would be nice if they added tbc servers 2-3 years later with optional transfer of classic characters
---
This resonated with me lol.
---
Just because the hardcore group brought it back, DOES NOT mean they will be the only people playing. Not everyone that loved Vanilla WoW got online and fought for it, simple because they never thought it would happen. It’s just not in some peoples introverted personalities (that are incredibly common in the mmo scene) to go out of their way to post, comment, or lobby to bring the game back after being told very flatly “No.”
---
Out of the 15 people I know across this country that are going to play WoW Classic. Only 3 of us played private servers, check forums, constantly look for blue post updates, etc. I have no doubt that at least a dozen of these players will raid/pvp rank. Point is, you underestimate the real life recruiting power of adults that DO NOT want to play this game alone. I myself recruited my wife, 2 of my best friends, and my uncle. All of which ask me for updates weekly.
---
Also comparing it to a whole other game and far less successful franchise such as Wildstar doesn’t equate to Classic WoW having a 90% player base lose. Again speculation at best.
---
Anything particular your thinking of with "sprinkles"? 
---
Honestly I would be happy if they brought it up to Wrath. I still consider Wrath to be the real golden era of WoW. It wasn’t until Cata that they really started to hose everything over. 
---
A month old yet you snagged a MW/Battletech username. Niiiice.
---
If you level priest, put shadow word pain on mob, power word shield and then use wand
---
That's completely true.
---
Imagine making fun of people who are actively giving feedback to Blizzard and trying to ensure the game plays just as it did back in 2005.
---
I would really hate myself if I dedicated my time to posting retard posts like this to make fun of people giving feedback.
---
No.. it's not.
---
It's a sub not about sitting at a computer, but about appreciating the computers of other people who have way more money than you
---
Totally agree! However im afraid of how the "optional" would split the community. But then again I can't think of a better solution than maybe restart new classic servers. This would then render the progress made useless. 
---
Thanks for the in depth detail and not flaming me for the question, really appreciate the information.
---
Warriors level slower than other classes.  Find a hunter or warlock friend who is in their high 30's.  If your are both speed leveling it is possible that you are early 30s and they are late 30s as they level faster.  The two of you should be able to do it, bring a healer of any level to be sure.  
---
What do you mean? If you're talking about getting crit for procs on a warrior or paladin, it's because in actual vanilla you took double damage while sitting, not real crits. It showed up as crits, but was counted internally as normal double damage, so it doesn't proc anything that would be caused by getting crit.
---
I never said anything about "nobody at any point disconnected from vanilla".
---
If you could actually read and comprehend English you'd know this. But maybe you can, because at least now I know I'm being trolled. 
---
I raided and PvP'ed alot in Cata. Personally I think Cata was great for pvp and I had loads of fun. Don't know if that i played Rogue, shaman and destro lock had something to do with it. 
---
BR0, Asmongold isn't playing classic.
---
The guy can't even play DS or Bloodborne without crying about difficulty or confusing mechanics. 
---
I think it's safe to say Asmongold will probably only play to level 10 and then shut off his stream and post a Twitlonger and do an AmA on his subreddit before vanishing for months.
---
Hah, I actually got it from a different game. Battlecruiser operational. 
---
"no way you can kill the elementals in Arathi Highlands"
---
"VERY doable at 30 except for the Thundering exiles" 
---
You two are in complete agreement....and yet seem to be arguing about it.
---
One of us
---
Simple search would have resulted in 10 million similar topics.
---
Anyway.
---
New team, old one is gone. New vision and 15 years late.
---
The reason vanilla was relevant all the way, and by this i mean the majority of content was almost always relevant throughout vanilla. Reason for this was the heavy RPG aspect of the game and the &gt;BROKEN&lt; itemization and class balance.
---
How do you add content without breaking this meta? How do you add new items that are so bad done that it actually helps the game? Talking about BiS pre raid green items, and blue items that lasted you all the way up to AQ 40?
---
What if the game turns into WoTLK? By this i mean that for example, once IC and ToC came out, everything else became irrelevant and braindead easy. What if that new content turns to be a simple level to 60, and farm that rep/dungeon and skip everything else?
---
Sounds good but the potential to break the game is incredible. Could it work? Maybe, but it will require IMMENSE dedication, and i don't trust current blizzard.
---
I want vanilla wow. Nothing more, nothing less. I like how Jagex handles things but I dont want that here, if they were to start adding things I would probably just go back to private servers. I understand where you are coming from but look at how serious everyone is about #nochanges and I think the majority of people passionate about classic wow would not be happy about following the OSRS model. 
---
Sorry but he wasnt playing wow at the time of this photo.
---
F
---
6 months per phase, it's the perfect timeline for Classic
---
There were also some other issues -- (my first char was a tauren hunter in beta). The main one I recall is it triggering when you weren't expecting it. Say a slow precise body-pull, let's slowly walk up t--- aaaand you ran into &amp; aggro'd the whole NPC camp.
---
That said, I did really love it. I wish they'd bring it back in some form, even if it has to be a re-skinned mount (like 'running wild' from xpacs, which is basically a mount with casttime except the animation is running)
---
So this is what your kind looked like. Look at that kid, begging for free stuff. No sense of guilt or shame at all for being the blight on the WoW community. I presume you've now chosen the time to confess and repent.
---
Warriors are pretty much a free HK alone. They're susceptible to seduce and are easily kited with FAP depending on the spec you're playing. 
---
You don’t even get to pick your class. 
---
Holy shit that changes the perspective. Now I get a little more understanding of the "Think you do" thing. All this time I've wanted Classic back because I sincerely just wanted the better game back. But saying Super Mario like that makes me realize how the guys that make these business decisions really could have seen it as bringing back Super Mario 2 to some wild, amazing fanfare.
---
With you saying it like that, I think I finally understand the difference in opinion. But the reality is Classic is *both*.
---
haha yea same
---
That's cruel.
---
I wanted to buy the shattered hand server blade but was about 200 short at the time... I really would like to know what happened to it 
---
The mind control cap was fun and all, but it'll never beat priests MCing people into the exit portals in battlegrounds.
---
&lt;Drama&gt; was world first nef kill. Good times on Shattered Hand. Anyone else who played in that server remember Copperfield the racist who would lead marches against Gnomes?
---
Oh god no. That puts us back in the same position we are in now. Where it is impossible to play the genre-changing game known as World of Warcraft. The purpose of this classic WoW is to be able to play pre-BC World of Warcraft. 
---
Randomly? Do you truly think most projected classic wow players want 2.5k servers?
---
BC was awesome I would be down. I already experienced wrath and would prefer the other 2 but I think the trilogy would make sense.
---
Belt? Leather belt?
---
It's a pretty safe bet. 18 months into Classic people are going to be desperate for new content and mechanic/spec balancing. The TBC patch will be sitting there fixing 90% of the issues people complain about and with 2 years of tried and tested content ready to go. All you have to do is add fresh TBC servers, some with Classic transfers open and others completely fresh.

I’m trying to say that 5K would take care of these problems and improve the overall experience and health of the realm in the future. And that is a fact, not a speculation.

He had the shekels

Thank you for including Barrens in the sharing. Certain areas are unplayable on pserver because of overpopulation.

underrated :D

Someone shud tell him before it’s too late 😬

I love seeing photos like this, because time really has flied. And I can't help but to think what these people in the photos are doing right now in life. If they are happy? what direction in life did they take?

I wouldn’t mind if they added some new content to vanilla after Naxx

Perkulator series are also good.
---
I really enjoyed this read! Thank you very much for your dedication in putting this together :)
---
Quick question about the execute switch.
---
If I was using a 2h would I switch to x2 1h to maximise dps  (more executes)?
---
I've never seen anyone cover this detail before!
---
Thanks again.
---
Omg you just ruined my futur life :(
---
I can't see blizzard doing this, classic is one thing, re-release a remastered old game, that happens, but then just continuing the same game they have now but 16 years behind I can't see it.
---
I personally think, it will just keep going, maybe adding a few events, then eventually just close servers one by one, that get low population and giving free transfers. 
---
You didn't get to experience original vanilla and TBC? 
---
Absolutely relatable. 😂
---
My favorite vanilla wow druid pvp vids were Druid of the Claw. So ridiculously good.  Great music in my opinion too.

---
I remember rolling a hunter I didn't understand the concept either. I thought being greedy was bad so I would either pass or need. I figured it out after a while haha.
---
Keep in mind a lot of younger gamers also want a game that will bring them the same thing older gamers want which are fun laughs and good times. My friends and I (me being the only one with mmo experience) found games like fortnite apex etc fun but quickly died on them because you often don't get the same sense as working together. All of us are 20 and are going to be playing and are super excited. 
---
I won't play if they add sharding or cross realm BGs, this is a deal breaker for me.
---
Sadly not
---
No I only did it once, and tried again but couldn't do it. Then went on to a druid. It sucks because I legit had it on my twitch vod that I shared with people, but they all get removed if you're not a partner after a couple weeks.
---
house chores never get done, fridge empty, just general disarray.
---
I want to race to clear kara and get season 1 classic gladiator with rogue in 2s.
---
There is barbershop though.
---
But which episode? If you don't mind me asking. ;)
---
I think sharding on launch is a good thing.
---
My reasoning is simple, so we can all experience launch night.
---
I know it’s not quite 2004 launch night but at the same time a few things have to be taken into account. Wow didn’t hit its peak until about 2009-2010. A lot missed out on “vanilla” I think this time around launch night could have more players than the first time trying to get around it.
---
If sharding means the majority of us can experience “day 1” with no issues until lvl 20 or so then it’s just our own server or even (first two questing zones for each race/faction) that’s fine and to me that’s more important than not having sharding for the first 20 levels.
---
If 40 is the equivalent to half way to 60 you’re saying less than a quarter of our played time is with sharding. You’ll forget about it and be over 20 in the first 24 hours  
---
I’m against sharding in The Barrens.
---
I'll be super happy about sharding on release day, especially on release day.  
---
Camping every mob just to be able to get a kill every 5 to 10 minutes (some unlucky times even 15) is not giving me any Vanilla-Experience-feels at all.  
---
If sharding allows me to never encounter more than an average amount of players in a leveling zone from level 1 on I'll happily welcome it to the launch of Classic.  
---
Later on it won't be necessary and will be left out eventually (my guess but it just sounds reasonable).  
---
My Opinion: please give us a release-days-sharding, if possible avoid it in the cities and fully get rid of it once the numbers have stabilized.
---
Episode #94
---
Haha sorry, but honestly it's a pretty shitty mechanic anyway if it was implemented, because you're just sitting in combat. You could argue it adds more depth but I think it's a kinda hacky exploit, I think it's alright that they're removing it, especially considering it's just a private server thing.
---
I would have strapped it to the bottom of the top bunck and just laid down tbh 
---
Retail can die off. Classic can remain as it is, progressing up to the last content (Naxx). 
---
After that the only realistic thing I could see (and accept) from Blizz is branching off into a WoW 2.0 with new, more serious and logical expansions from Classic.
---
That said, it'd be a ~20 year old game by that time. So maybe Classic *should* be the last thing to do with this game.
---
#controverial opinion but it is what it is.
---
I distinctly remember using an invisibility spell on a mage but I never played the beta. I'm wondering if I'm actually remembering invis potions?
---
I’ve always done it this way, feels really good when you stumble upon a great guild.
---
This is from 2010 when Blizzard hit they’re first big player loss at the end of WOTLK. Which I still blame on how much they had changed the game from it’s Vanilla state, granted this statement is an opinion of mine it was the only reason I have ever heard irl. Along with myself, apparently a lot of people I knew didn’t like welfare epics. 
---
This has been brought up before but I’m not sure how people translate this into a metric for WoW Classic. This was a statistic released years after the opening of the Dark Portal, and the only reason Blizzard brings it up is because that statistic scared them and they were not expecting it. They had previously operated as they were too big too fail until this steep and sudden subscription drop off.
---
To further prove this, when WoW was in its Vanilla stage we never heard anything about it except it’s wildfire like growth. Hell by TBC there were headlines about people being admitted into treatment centers for “WoW Addiction.” An article from a time when WoW experienced its worst changes does not mean 2/3rds of the population will suddenly leave for Classic as well. 
---
Friends first 
---
Instead of dropping a phone on your face you drop a computer monitor 
---
The number of posts that repeat this exact same topic over and over again has driven me to hope TBC never gets launched.   
---
I'm sort of intruiged by this, however I don't see blizzard branch out of vanilla with a completely new storyline
---
Wait something that was a mount warning achievement is now ban able? Ohhh retail
---
[Lei of the Lifegiver](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19312)
---
I remember this one.
---
Night Elves make garbage Warriors.  If you PvP, roll Gnome.  If you PvE, roll Human.  You'll regret being a Night Elf.
---
My back hurts looking at this
---
Anyone who doesnt think TBC should also be released is a hypocrite. All those retail dummies who said for years that Blizzard shouldnt make Vanilla because it sucked had exactly the same argument.
---
If you dont personally like TBC then that's fine, you should still want blizzard to make it. Like i don't enjoy Cataclysm, but if in 5 years Blizzard was thinking about making cata servers i'd be all for it, cause i'm not a selfish asshole, and it's only fair now that i have mine.
---
Oh, and Karazhan was the best raid ever released, and both the dungeons and raiding in TBC was probably the best it's ever been. I canøt wait for TBC.
---
No, it's not.  .5s cast time, 60 second cooldown.  
---
In TBC it was changed to an instant cast with a 1.75 minute cooldown.
---
Go on, I'm unaware on this
---
All this pic did was remind me of that old bug where some peoples names would get REALLTY LARGE and take up your entire FOV... Regular sized person with a gargantuan name running through IF. Probably was a client side error... lol
---
 that brings a big smile to my face :-)
---
How did I not know about this? 
---
Savage. Absolutely savage. Well played Onyxia.
---
Loading screens are gonna be insanely short with modern hardware on SSDs. 
---
Well if there is only one or two on AH like back then, they don't have to undercut really. At this scale that has way bigger chances of happening.
---
ahh man not only vanilla is nostalgic in this picture but the whole set up really, having boxes instead of headphones, having a webcam because we used it with MSN.(instead of not having one or taped cos you know NSA) I am fucking  amazed by a wireless mouse though....... 
---
No gloves drop for DPS Warriors in BWL.
---
Blowing stuff with with that Sulfuras? :V
---
I can smell the virginity through my screen 
---
Not if you tie it up well enough lol. Used to do it with my laptop to watch movies laying down 
---
Yeah i guess it changes the build for pally leveling too! As you play prot and sit on packs from level 34
---
As a Side thought, let's imagine a world where we, the player, get to make tips for loading screens in the vein of Dark Souls. Can you imagine the trolling. 
---
I was 17 when I started in 2004, I thought I was one of the young ones playing at the time. Definitely puts things into perspective.
---
Gnome is the best PvP race.

If i had 4 clones of me we could do it at lvl 10 in greys no wipes and /flex on all bosses. 
---
You are creating the strawman argument that "2/3rds will suddenly leave". Some people will quit for good, others will start playing more casually, some will take a break for the next content phase. The average concurrent player count will drop heavily compared to launch week.
---
Yeah, the only other picture I have of me gaming is from a few years later and I'm wearing sweatpants and hunched over the keyboard. I only have this decent picture because my sister was trying out her new Nikon lol
---
Warlocks, rogues, and hunters tier1 and tier 2 sets are good for pvp.
---
Great question! 
---
The answer is: depends on what weapons you have. If you're using BRE and your two 1h weapons are subpar, than it might not be a good idea. But if you have comparable 1hs to your 2h, then I'd wager that yes, you're most likely going to do more damage by switching to faster 1handers. 
---
Thank you so much for the kind words!
---
Are you the cutie or one of the others?
---
Paladin is easier I think. They have a talent that gives mana back when you crit. Also their heals cast faster so as a priest you have to cancel your spells more to prevent overhealing which is annoying. Also with divine shield it is nice if you accidentally pull aggro. Or you have blessing of protection if a dps accidentally pulls aggro.
---
TBH I'm really annoyed to found out the stupid Wrathgate plot + the Cataclysm on development of the Forsaken was planned all along based on this. Like there's really good tragic writing in Tirisfal Glades but I guess that just slipped through the cracks because the intention was apparently always "They want to kill all life on Azeroth for no reason at all, I guess they're just evil lol."
---
Leave it to Blizzard to take as a cool a concept as a bunch of zombies who've gained free will and take it in literally the most boring possible direction.
---
Thank you. :)
---
I’m voting nipple flasher. 
---
Can you go into further detail about this? I’ve heard it once before, and plan on trying it to play with a dwarf friend, but I can never find info
---
Shattered Hand, right? Rolled first character on Alliance side there in '04, can't remember the names of the guilds I was in outside of MrFixitOnline/MFO. 
---
I remember the seemingly 'big' rivalry between D&amp;T and Drama. Tried to get into one of them but it was too much time commit for me. 
---
This actually made it into the manual.
---
But if one is a blacksmith they can make gear for both of them.
---
Im still trying to find reasons why not roll a mage compared to other classes if im being honest
---
Definetly. Bcs mages had invis and were OP in beta. With the launch of vanilla it was removed. And it was added again in wotlk I think. Not sure. But yes there are invis potions in vanilla.
---
Has this kitten passed away?
---
Wow, Copperfield. That's a name that I've been trying to remember for a long time. There were quite a few notorious PCs that got reputations on that server.
---
No interested in a TBC release personally.  I don’t like the addition of Draenei and blood elves, and I don’t like pally/shaman on both factions. 
---
Date nights disappear, everyone's unshowered and sleep deprived, surviving off of frozen foods. My husband and I are both gamers but we  try to keep it casual now. Except when we both got addicted to swtor... and then ffxiv... 🙃
---
Pick one on release and once u'll be invested you wont want to reroll
---
Between what are you choosing btw? And what are your goals in the game
---
Will we be able to eat and drink at the same time?
---
I have leveled several Warriors to 60.  Fury is okay until you get MS.  Dual wield Fury is so bad while leveling.  You just don't get any +hit items while leveling.  2h Fury is bad, because Bloodthirst hits like a wet noodle due to you having very little Attack Power.  MS is the way to go 40+.
---
But some classes do have tier 1 and 2 sets far better suited for pvp, which makes it easier to gear for pvp when all you will realistically access is early raids, and in some cases tier pieces may even be BiS. Mages tier 1 and 2 sets have crap stam so that’s not a great class to rely on tier 2 rather than pvp gear. Shadow priests will struggle with gearing for pvp if they won’t access pvp gear or AQ. Warlock’s tier 1 and tier 2 sets have great stats for pvp and are not a great class to bother going for rank 13 gear. Hunters t1 is great for pvp, t2 is a slight upgrade, and then t2.5 is shit, and their quest now is so good they can get in phase 1 there’s barely an upgrade in BWL and then no upgrade till naxx, so that seems like a good option for him too. Rogues probably also.Maybe healers too, I’m not as knowledgeable on them.
---
Must be a royal pain in the ass. I had originally though I reached rank 12 in retail Classic, but after looking at the rewards, I'm sure I didn't and only did when the TBC prep patch made ranking easy.
---
I played a ton of pvp and likely only reached rank 10 because I wanted the gear set obviously and I do not believe I ever got the mount, but could have.
---
Not hard at all, just time consuming. 
---
Dueling my friends in front of iron forge
---
Incredibly hard and time consuming imo. Dont forget you're going to also put in some time raiding on top of pvp for gear. Even with premade its not easy.  Good luck mate. 
---
Sitting to get crit and proc Enrage will not be a thing in Classic.  I believe that is confirmed.
---
I used to have the same Harmon Karden speakers when I bought my first Dell computer. They were awesome! I also rolled a Lock main in Vanilla. 
---
No need to shield. Just renew if necessary 
---
Where do I find this? I need it for...reasons.
---
I am actually planning on making my first character a smite priest. So I will be doing a lot of theory crafting on the best way to do damage as a non-shadow priest.
---
Not even saving it for the next raid. Casuals confirmed 😏😎
---
I love seeing the words “creating the strawman” in a sentence lately. Lets me know whos not really paying attention and just regurgitating something they’ve heard recently. The 2/3rds figure I used was a figure I literally pulled from other commentators, one even said he expected a 90% loss I just didn’t mention because that’s completely unrealistic.
---
Yes it will drop compared to launch. The reason most people like to be around for launches is the unmatched chaos at the beginning. It happens, but people are on these forums acting like every sever is going to be dead in a month after opening. These fears are extremely over exaggerated and not fixed with sharding. 
---
That's what I expect. The challenges in vanilla were in big part because we just didn't know how to do this kind of stuff and because there were always some not great players. I expect AQ and Naxx will still be rough for some guilds while being a total cakewalk for others based on skill, but the challenge of figuring out the details is pretty much gone by now.
---
Agreed but I'd prefer they limited sharding to the 1-10 zones.
---
I wouldn't mind the bottle neck when leaving those zones. 
---
Only if you have to copy over a character and still have access to classic and there is enough community for both to stay healthy. Otherwise, just vanilla forever. 
---
Hang on, was that a thing in retail? I thought that was a PS thing 😮
---
You go nice hair mate
---
I think a shadow priest spec that dips into holy for holy Nova enabling aoe farming would be my ideal "meme" spec if that isn't already a tried and true iteration
---
I also was short on cash at the time. Some good memories raiding and whatnot 
---
Dont click
---
Book was "Look and Learn" and it was my roommate's bed. I went to boarding school at the time. They would take our power cables at night so we wouldn't play all night and be tired in school. Of course all of the boys who played WoW had spare ones so we could finish raid nights. It was tense since the staff would sometimes storm in our rooms to check were not on our computers so I usually had my foot ready on the power button and school books nearby to throw on top of my keyboard. Great memories haha
---
that’s awesome.
---
Rip your inbox
---
Yes, but a stand alone server, vanilla remains. 
---
Allow you to copy over your toons from the vanilla server, but once copied they dont affect one another.
---
If there is a 3k cap on launch yes the servers will be dead in a month. The point of sharding is they can have way more than 3k concurrent without affecting gameplay and slowly remove sharding as the pop stabilises
---
Heroic Strike is 15 rage untalented.  12 with talents.
---
This is very good.  
---
Read the entire thing.  
---
Make another post when you finish it plz so I can read the rest.  
---
Same! 
---
Hybrid Shaman. It'll be fun. 95% corpse runs, I'm excited for that 5% 
---
Blizzard’s philosophy these days seems to be that everyone has to be able to partake in all of the content. 
---
The thing that made Vanilla so magical for me though, was seeing people like them -gods in my eyes- and basking in their glory, knowing I would never stand as their equal. 
---
Probably 2/3 hours a day every week. At the minimum 
---
On a high pop bg you can count on at least needing to grind 6 weeks at 6 hours a day. Basically you need to play more than 99.9% of people and only pvp. Have fun.
---
Still happens on private servers. So funny :P
---
I seriously forgot how important the priests wand was.   Ive carried a mace since cata, damn.
---
Leveling enchanting and finally making your next wand was serious caster roleplay.  
---
Thanks! It's Stormwind City :)
---
Ah lol gotcha. Well it turned out to be a valuable pic in the end, im sure! 
---
All these wow pictures might as well be titled "Me and my home school teacher" if I'm going off my own personal experience of how much WoW actually taught me in my teenage years lol. Just from playing WoW I learned how to type in shorthand, and also quit writing in shorthand, and a wealth of new vocabulary and knowledge of topical events (barrens chat) :D
---
Couldnt agree more.
---
Its way too risky, and it puts us in the same spot we were before.
---
A new game with those design principles is better to strive for, vanilla will hopeful stay what it is, vanilla.
---
I just want a release date dont care when, 26th of july, 27th of august, hell even 18th of december is fine, aslong as I get a date!
---
Why not both?!  (Because mana is a bitch, i know)
---
I use this same method.  Level disadvantages aside, its usually the people trying to get into a dungeon too early that are going to wipe and leave anyway.  
---
SL firestone melee lock
---
I used a 2h and Overpower was always worth it, even through naxx
---
yea i use my math book for mouse pad when in bed 
---
After they fixed reckoning, for a while they had it as 5 points and every point gave you 20% chance to counter hit.  They also had a seal I think it was Justice, that gave you a 2 sec stun on hit... I built a damage return set with shield from ud strat and the armor Smith enchantment, plus any other thorn gear I could find... And maxed armor elsewise... I would /afk and sit in populated areas and of course, filthy rogues couldn't resist the backstab. Little did they know, it would do exactly nothing, but it would stun them, I would causally turn around and purma stun them in trade, leaving a rank one concecrate on the ground to weed out pesky vanishes.  It maybe took 25-30 seconds to kill them... It was funny though.
---
I believe the wand is based off of the global timer.  Similar to autoattack, but there is no auto wand.
---
Is this private server memes?
---
Cause if you actually look at WORLD FIRST entire expansion guild nihilum, you might notice their 3 rogues and 3-4 mages.
---
If i recall, they are arcane mages, cause that did stupid dps.
---
If you want some perspective. This robe drops from AQ40.
---
 [http://classicdb.ch/?item=21663](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21663) 
---
Way too old to be coloring, what a dork.
---
If you're pugging, it's rough... If you have premades and treat it like a raid where you at least moderately interview people for gear and general knowledge... Not too bad. But it's still some work without a pvp guild.
---
Yep. From body agro to simply not doing a lot of damage due to missing and resisting.  
---
What sucks is that you think the low level is doing fine at first, but that's only because the beginning of the instance has lower level mobs.  
---
It's not until you reach the end sections of the instance that you start to see really bad body pulls and a rapidly declining DPS.  
---
SM/DS Warlock. Amazing for farming DM:W, horrible for actual dungeons or raids.
---
A creation of my own theory crafting i call "holy bologna and what you dont tell your raid leader
---
Priest0/31/20
---
You take lightwell and spirit of redemption to cheese loatheb and you have the +hit talents to tank razuvius and can do other hilarious things but its only choose this build if you meet 2 conditions:
---
1. You are on naxx patch
---
2. Your raid has slackers who dont want to spend money on consumes.
---
99.999% certain they will be post nerf. Spirit of Aquamentas paired with old Lucifron neck (same effect) would be the most OP combo in the game forever. You would never replace them.
---
Total of -50 mana cost to a Paladin f.ex when max rank flash of light cost 140 mana.
---
That just seems, terrible.  Do you run the mouse on the upholstery? I can't help but think you were a keyboard turner.
---
Thank you! Will do for sure :)
---
They would just let you copy your character over to the tbc server. You'd still be able to play classic lol
---
Not a healer item, but:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=10781](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10781) 
---
It's a level 55 chest item with no level requirement. Drops from Steel Lockbox. You can unlock the box, open it without taking the item out. If the chest is inside, send the box to an alt.
---
Funnily enough I had it on the arm rest which was pure fabric. 
---
Lol.  Sweeping Strikes is really good for leveling.  Getting that initial 30 rage isn't that hard when you Charge and have improved charge.  
---
Where are people coming up with some of the shit they are saying here?  It's like people haven't played a vanilla warrior since 2005 or something.
---
I would be so happy, back to my space goat shaman.
---
Hell yeah dude, no prob.
---
My guild was pve, but two days a week we would stomp wsg and av. The wsg runs I remember to be specially fast. Like 3-4m wins. We would almost never lose, only to actual pvp guilds as opponents... 
---
The kettle I can understand, you might need to refill a tea cup or something. But why the toaster? What were you toasting in the lounge room?
---
I’m pretty sure it was bread. 
---
Then marmite on final product. 
---
Yes there is. It’s just like auto shoot for hunter. 
---
A good short concise comparison to tanking in vanilla versus future expansions is that your focus isn't to pull aggro off dps as a priority, its to protect the healer. Earlier on you won't be able to hold aggro unless you its 1 on 1 with the mob and you get a sunder off or 2 first. You can taunt them off a dps which is usually suggested but don't feel disheartened when aggro is all over the place. It's the dps's responsibility to understand how much threat they're generating and managing it. A good dps player in vanilla will attack the mob the tank is attacking. Effectively the strategy is to wittle down the pack 1 at a time. This is just earlier dungeoning mind you tanking raids is a whole other ballpark.
---
Mom stopping taking pictures of me fapping!
---
I just wanted to say that I used to have that exact headset. 
---
I just looked this up, and I have to say, it's been so long, I forgot about the existence of firestone
---
Which items are you refering to? Are you taking into consideration progressive itemization? Most of the 1.12 greens and blues items on Pservers are in a "catch up" state making them overpowered for all content prior to Naxx, like for example the lvl 48 healing shoulders from Lord Roccor which basicly can last you until Naxx. I don't think that item will be that good on launch at Classic.
---
If your friends will be playing classic, tell them you'd like to go alliance this time around. Perhaps some of them were blood elves and aren't a fan of the pre-TBC horde aesthetics, or they like playing pally. Maybe they'd like to go alliance this time around.
---
If you can't convince them, I'd say go Horde. Vanilla is super social and playing with an established group of friends from the start will probably be very enjoyable and beneficial.
---
But why not do that in the kitchen? Did you also have bread and marmite stored in your lounge room? 
---
Holy shit, you're only a tighty-whitey away from being *that* fat guy sitting on the floor with his desktop.
---
Does that mean no overpower?
---
Sorry, but gnome rogue is best. Attack a tauren and they'll hardly be able to see you!
---
You sure? I thought the 5% crit from fury was quite nice
---
hit 60 and find an e-girl.
---
Depends how much rage you aren’t gaining with that white hit. Usually 7-8 rage with a 2 gander while leveling. 
---
I'm a bit triggered by how messy that inventory is, tbh. If I have more than like... 20 slots filled and I wasn't questing or farming immediately before, something is wrong. Especially as a pure dps class.
---
I hope you remedied the situation!
---
Not really a wow pun but my guild back in the day was &lt;Schadenfreuden Slips&gt;
---
This wasn’t the typical set up every day or anything. Bread and marmite were within reach during this time though yes. 
---
And this picture was taken after my friends had cleared out after a few days of LANing it up. 
---
10/10 troll
---
I believe they were intending to have another horde streamer on their realm to try to balance the factions, but I can’t remember the name of the person?
---
Sounds dope. I’ve thought about it as well after reading some guys RP idea on this sub about a crusader type guild with a ton of smite priests and paladins. Definitely roll Alliance for the paladin synergy of sanctity aura 10% holy damage and judge of the crusader flat extra damage. Multiple ranks stack for some big dick holy damage
---
Ahh okay I thought this was your setup for the year.
---
I thought most macroed it to multi-shot
---
Something I'd definitely be looking into when the time comes. Very interesting stuff, this is why I love vanilla :)
---
That was a hell of a comfy couch so it could of been but I had a large desk in another part of the house where things were a little more ergonomic. 
---
need release date tho
---
Thank You very much:)
---
Hello good Sir,
---
I find myself somewhat in the same boat as you. I too started out Alliance, and after some lots of both realm and faction changes I too ended up with all my characters Horde. And that's where I left them. And just like you I am also "homesick". I almost long for walking into Ironforge, or landing at the flightpath in Stormwind. But out of all I miss Darnassus the most. The calm and serene feeling of Darnassus. Starting a new Night Elf character and going through Teldrassil, the big ol' tree. That said I don't have many friends returning for Classic. So really uncertain what I will end up with..
---
No, there's too much automation, e.g kickbot for PvP. Most of the addons you mentioned can be recreated for the modern API anyways. For intercept/charge just use a modifier macro or nocombat flag.

&gt;Line of Sight functionality implemented to game objects and enviornments, can result in improved gameplay and make the skill cap for casters more equal to melees. But will it be a thing on Blizzards classic servers? Opinions?

There wasn't much else out there besides Korean MMOs and Evercrack
---
Typical Alliance lol.

No, intentionally crowding servers with the intent of destabilising realms is a bannable offence. You're allowed to invade orgrimmar to kill.. Whoever is in charge there now, you aren't allowed to make a million smurf gnomes called Blckrckdwn and nuke argent dawn because your realm is gacked.

I dont believe there was in vanilla.   That or i never knew ro right click lol

This picture is legit as fuck.

I’ve got CFOJimmy username ready for that day.

Gnome has the best PvP racial for a Warrior... by far.  I've been playing a Gnome Warrior on private servers since 2011.  I played a Gnome Warrior in OG vanilla, TBC, Wrath.  If you PvP and you're not a Gnome, you are gimping yourself.

should just drop to all 4 legs on toggle

I am very well aware of the reasons stated by Blizzard. I just don’t buy into it. Excluding sharding from WoW Classic would probably weed out more of the tourists than anything else. 
---
Sharding is  a very wildly hated “Non-Vanilla” system. I’m not sure why people are suddenly okay with it slipping in because Blizz fed us some BS excuse. 
---
There is exactly one reason I can think of that make some people okay with this. That’s because sharding drastically increases the chances of these speed (first-second week) Rag kills multiple big guilds are gunning for. That’s a logical reason to want your early game play simplified/uncluttered. So besides this, we’re back to QoL arguments.

Honestly? Ganking/griefing. Not necessarily low levels.

Them wires putting in the overtime.

Was about to say this. 
---
I used to have that Microsoft travel mouse. 🙂
---
I think this can work with TBC talents but tricky in vanilla.
---
The name was less me but there is a talent that gives free instant cast smite process chance on other spell crit.
---
I’d play where you enjoy the most. In this case it’d be Alliance. I originally went Alliance for a year before I finally went Horde and never looked back. Besides you can always play both.
